<text>Riley B. King (September 16, 1925 – May 14, 2015), known professionally as B.B. King, was an American blues guitarist, singer, songwriter, and record producer. He introduced a sophisticated style of soloing based on fluid string bending, shimmering vibrato, and staccato picking that influenced many later electric guitar blues players. AllMusic recognized King as &quot;the single most important electric guitarist of the last half of the 20th century&quot;.

He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987 and is one of the most influential blues musicians of all time, earning the nickname &quot;The King of the Blues&quot;, and is referred to as one of the &quot;Three Kings of the Blues Guitar&quot; (along with Albert King and Freddie King, none of whom is related). King performed tirelessly throughout his musical career, appearing on average at more than 200 concerts a year into his 70s. In 1956 alone, he appeared at 342 shows.

He was attracted to music and taught himself to play guitar beginning his career in juke joints and on local radio. He later lived in Memphis and Chicago. Then, as his fame grew, he toured the world extensively.

== Early life ==
Riley B. King was born on September 16, 1925, on a cotton plantation in Berclair named Bear Creek in Leflore County near the city of Itta Bena, Mississippi, the son of sharecroppers Albert and Nora Ella King. When he was four years old, his mother left his father for another man, so he was raised by his maternal grandmother, Elnora Farr, in Kilmichael, Mississippi, then in Lexington. As a teen, he moved to Indianola which he referred to as his hometown, later working at a cotton gin.

While young, King sang in the gospel choir at Elkhorn Baptist Church in Kilmichael. He was attracted to the Pentecostal Church of God in Christ because of its music. The local minister performed with a Sears Roebuck Silvertone guitar during services and taught King his first three chords. Flake Cartledge, his employer in Kilmichael, bought him his first guitar
for 15 dollars. Cartledge withheld money from King&#x27;s salary for the next two months until he repaid the debt.

In November 1941, &quot;King Biscuit Time&quot; first aired, broadcasting on KFFA in Helena, Arkansas. It was a radio show featuring the Mississippi Delta blues. King listened to it while on break at the plantation. A self-taught guitarist, he then wanted to be a radio musician.

In 1943, King left Kilmichael to work as a tractor driver and play guitar with the Famous St. John&#x27;s Gospel Singers of Inverness, Mississippi, performing at area churches and on WGRM in Greenwood. He served in the U.S. Army during World War II but was released after being ruled as &quot;essential to the war economy&quot; based on his experience as a tractor driver.

In 1946, he followed Bukka White to Memphis, Tennessee. White took him in for the next ten months. King returned shortly afterward to Mississippi where he better prepared himself for the next visit. Two years later, he returned to West Memphis, Arkansas. He performed on Sonny Boy Williamson&#x27;s radio program on KWEM in West Memphis where he began to develop an audience. His appearances led to steady engagements at the Sixteenth Avenue Grill in West Memphis and later to a ten minute spot on the Memphis radio station WDIA. The radio spot became so popular that it was expanded and became the &quot;Sepia Swing Club&quot;.

He worked at WDIA as a singer and disc jockey where he was given the nickname &quot;Beale Street Blues Boy&quot;, later shortened to &quot;Blues Boy&quot; and finally to &quot;B.B.&quot; It was there that he first met T-Bone Walker. King said, &quot;Once I&#x27;d heard him for the first time, I knew I&#x27;d have to have [an electric guitar] myself. &#x27;Had&#x27; to have one, short of stealing!&quot;

== Career ==
=== 1949–2005 ===

In the late 1940s and early 1950s, King was a part of the blues scene on Beale Street. &quot;Beale Street was where it all started for me,&quot; he said. He performed with Bobby Bland, Johnny Ace and Earl Forest in a group known as the Beale Streeters.

According to King and Joe Bihari, one of the founders of Modern Records and its subsidiaries, Ike Turner introduced King to the Bihari brothers while he was a talent scout for them. Before his RPM contract, King had debuted on Bullet Records by issuing the single &quot;Miss Martha King&quot; (1949), which did not chart well. &quot;My very first recordings [in 1949] were[sic] for a company out of Nashville called Bullet, the Bullet Record Transcription company,&quot; King recalled. &quot;I had horns that very first session. I had Phineas Newborn on piano; his father played drums, and his brother, Calvin, played guitar with me. I had Tuff Green on bass, Ben Branch on tenor sax, his brother, Thomas, on trumpet, and a lady trombone player. The Newborn family were the house band at the famous Plantation Inn in West Memphis.&quot;
In 1949, King began recording songs under contract with Los Angeles-based RPM Records, a subsidiary of Modern. Sam Phillips, who later founded Sun Records, produced many of King&#x27;s early recordings. 

King assembled his band, the B.B. King Review, under the leadership of Millard Lee. The band initially consisted of Calvin Owens and Kenneth Sands (trumpet), Lawrence Burdin (alto saxophone), George Coleman (tenor saxophone), Floyd Newman (baritone saxophone), Millard Lee (piano), George Joyner (bass) and Earl Forest and Ted Curry (drums). King hired Onzie Horne, a trained musician, to be an arranger and assist him with his compositions. By his admission, King could not play chords well and always relied on improvisation.

King supported his recordings by touring across the United States with performances in major theaters in cities such as Washington, D.C., Chicago, Los Angeles, Detroit, and St. Louis, as well as numerous gigs in small clubs and juke joints in the southern United States. During one show in Twist, Arkansas, a brawl broke out between two men and caused a fire. He left the building with the rest of the crowd but ran back in to get his guitar. He said he later learned that the two men were fighting over a woman named Lucille. He named the guitar Lucille as a reminder not to fight over women, or run into any more burning buildings.

Following his first &quot;Billboard&quot; Rhythm and Blues charted number one, &quot;3 O&#x27;Clock Blues&quot; (February 1952), King became one of the most important names in R&amp;B music in the 1950s, amassing an impressive list of hits including &quot;You Know I Love You&quot;, &quot;Woke Up This Morning&quot;, &quot;Please Love Me&quot;, &quot;When My Heart Beats Like a Hammer&quot;, &quot;Whole Lotta&#x27; Love&quot;, &quot;You Upset Me Baby&quot;, &quot;Every Day I Have the Blues&quot;, &quot;Sneakin&#x27; Around&quot;, &quot;Ten Long Years&quot;, &quot;Bad Luck&quot;, &quot;Sweet Little Angel&quot;, &quot;On My Word of Honor&quot;, and &quot;Please Accept My Love&quot;. This led to a significant increase in his weekly earnings, from about $85 to $2,500, with appearances at major venues such as the Howard Theater in Washington and the Apollo in New York, as well as touring the &quot;Chitlin&#x27; Circuit&quot;. 1956 became a record-breaking year, with 342 concerts booked and three recording sessions. That same year he founded his own record label, Blues Boys Kingdom, with headquarters at Beale Street in Memphis. There, among other projects, he was a producer for artists such as Millard Lee and Levi Seabury. In 1962, King signed to ABC-Paramount Records, which was later absorbed into MCA Records (which itself was later absorbed into Geffen Records). In November 1964, King recorded the &quot;Live at the Regal&quot; album at the Regal Theater. King later said that &quot;Regal Live&quot; &quot;is considered by some the best recording I&#x27;ve ever had ... that particular day in Chicago everything came together.&quot;

From the late 1960s, his new manager, Sid Seidenberg, pushed him into a different type of venue as blues-rock performers like Eric Clapton (once a member of the Yardbirds and Cream) and Paul Butterfield were bringing blues music to appreciative white audiences. King gained further visibility among rock audiences as an opening act on the Rolling Stones&#x27; 1969 American Tour. He won a Grammy Award in 1970 for his version of the song &quot;The Thrill Is Gone&quot; which was a hit on both the Pop and R&amp;B charts. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine listed it in the number 183 spot in their 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. 

King was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1980, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987, and the National Rhythm &amp; Blues Hall of Fame in 2014. In 2004, he was awarded the international Polar Music Prize which is given to artists &quot;in recognition of exceptional achievements in the creation and advancement of music.&quot;

From the 1980s to his death in 2015, he maintained a highly visible and active career, appearing on numerous television shows and sometimes performing 300 nights a year. In 1988, he reached a new generation of fans with the single &quot;When Love Comes to Town&quot;, a collaborative effort with the Irish band U2 on their &quot;Rattle and Hum&quot; album. In December 1997, he performed in the Vatican&#x27;s fifth annual Christmas concert and presented his trademark guitar &quot;Lucille&quot; to Pope John Paul II. In 1998, King appeared in &quot;The Blues Brothers 2000&quot;, playing the part of the lead singer of the Louisiana Gator Boys along with Eric Clapton, Dr. John, Koko Taylor and Bo Diddley. In 2000, he and Clapton teamed up again to record &quot;Riding With the King&quot; which won a Grammy Award for Best Traditional Blues Album.

Discussing where he took the Blues, from &quot;dirt floor, smoke in the air&quot; joints to grand concert halls, King said the Blues belonged everywhere beautiful music belonged. He successfully worked both sides of the commercial divide, with sophisticated recordings and &quot;raw, raucous&quot; live performances.

=== 2006–2014 ===
In 2006, King went on a farewell world tour although he remained active afterward. The tour was partly supported by Northern Irish guitarist, Gary Moore, with whom King had previously toured and recorded. It started in the United Kingdom and continued with performances at the Montreux Jazz Festival and in Zürich at the Blues at Sunset. During his show in Montreux at the Stravinski Hall, he jammed with Joe Sample, Randy Crawford, David Sanborn, Gladys Knight, Leela James, Andre Beeka, Earl Thomas, Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin, Barbara Hendricks and George Duke.

In June 2006, King was present at a memorial of his first radio broadcast at the Three Deuces Building in Greenwood, Mississippi where the Mississippi Blues Commission erected an official marker as part of the Mississippi Blues Trail. The same month, a groundbreaking was held for a new museum, dedicated to him, in Indianola, Mississippi. The B.B. King Museum and Delta Interpretive Center opened on September 13, 2008.

In late October 2006, King recorded a concert album and video entitled &quot;B.B. King: Live&quot; at his B.B. King Blues Clubs in Nashville and Memphis. The video of the four night production featured his regular band and captured his shows as he performed them nightly around the world. Released in 2008, they were his first performances in over a decade to be documented with a live album release.

In 2007, King played at Eric Clapton&#x27;s second Crossroads Guitar Festival and contributed the songs &quot;Goin&#x27; Home&quot;, to &quot;Goin&#x27; Home: A Tribute to Fats Domino&quot; (with Ivan Neville&#x27;s DumpstaPhunk) and &quot;One Shoe Blues&quot; to Sandra Boynton&#x27;s children&#x27;s album &quot;Blue Moo&quot;, accompanied by a pair of sock puppets in a music video for the song.

In the summer of 2008, King played at the Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival in Manchester, Tennessee where he was given a key to the city. Later that year, he was inducted into the Hollywood Bowl Hall of Fame.

He performed at the Mawazine festival in Rabat, Morocco on May 27, 2010. In June 2010, he played at the Crossroads Guitar Festival with Robert Cray, Jimmie Vaughan, and Eric Clapton. He also contributed to Cyndi Lauper&#x27;s album &quot;Memphis Blues&quot; which was released on June 22, 2010.

In 2011, King played at the Glastonbury Music Festival, and in the Royal Albert Hall in London where he recorded a concert video.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked him at No. 6 on its 2011 list of the 100 greatest guitarists of all time.

On February 21, 2012, King was among the performers of &quot;In Performance at the White House: Red, White and Blues&quot; during which President Barack Obama sang part of &quot;Sweet Home Chicago&quot;. King recorded for the debut album of rapper and producer Big K.R.I.T. who also hails from Mississippi. On July 5, 2012, King performed a concert at the Byblos International Festival in Lebanon.

On May 26, 2013, he appeared at the New Orleans Jazz Festival.

On October 3, 2014, after completing his live performance at the House of Blues in Chicago, a doctor diagnosed King with dehydration and exhaustion and the eight remaining shows of his ongoing tour had to be canceled. King did not reschedule the shows, and the House of Blues show would be the last before he died in 2015.

== Equipment ==

King used equipment characteristic of the different periods he played in. He played guitars made by various manufacturers early in his career. He played a Fender Esquire on most of his recordings with RPM Records. Later, he was best known for playing variants of the Gibson ES-355.

In the September edition 1995 of &quot;Vintage Guitar&quot; magazine, early photos show him playing a Gibson ES-5 through a Fender tweed amp. In reference to the photo, King stated,
&quot;Yes; the old Fender amplifiers were the best that were ever made, in my opinion. They had a good sound and they were durable; guys would throw them in the truck and they&#x27;d hold up. They had tubes, and they&#x27;d get real hot, but they just had a sound that is hard to put into words. The Fender Twin was great, but I have an old Lab Series amp that isn&#x27;t being made anymore. I fell in love with it because its sound is right between the old Fender amps that we used to have and the Fender Twin. It&#x27;s what I&#x27;m using tonight.&quot;

He moved on from the larger Gibson hollow bodied instruments which were prone to feedback when played at high volumes to various semi-hollow models beginning first with the ES-335 and then on to a deluxe version called the ES-355 which used a stereo option. In 1980, Gibson Guitar Corporation launched the B.B. King Lucille model, an ES-355 with stereo options, a varitone selector, and fine tuners (neither of which he actually used ) and, at King&#x27;s direct request, no f-holes to further reduce feedback. In 2005, Gibson made a special run of 80 Gibson Lucilles, referred to as the &quot;80th Birthday Lucille&quot;, the first prototype of which they gave him as a birthday gift and which he used thereafter.

He used a Lab Series L5 2×12&quot; combo amplifier and used this amplifier for a long time. Norlin Industries made them for Gibson in the 1970s and 1980s. Other popular L5 users are Allan Holdsworth and Ty Tabor of King&#x27;s X. The L5 has an onboard compressor, parametric equalization, and four inputs. King also used a Fender Twin Reverb.

He used his signature model strings &quot;Gibson SEG-BBS B.B. King Signature Electric Guitar Strings&quot; with gauges: 10–13–17p–32w–45w–54w and D&#x27;Andrea 351 MD SHL CX (medium 0.71mm, tortoiseshell, celluloid) picks.

== Blues clubs ==
In 1991, Beale Street developer John Elkington recruited King to open the original B.B. King&#x27;s Blues Club in Memphis and in 1994, they launched a second club at Universal Citywalk in Los Angeles. A third club in New York City&#x27;s Times Square opened in June 2000 but closed on April 29, 2018. Management is currently in the process of finding a new location in New York City. Two more clubs opened, at Foxwoods Casino in Connecticut in January 2002, and in Nashville in 2003. Another club opened in Orlando in 2007. A club in West Palm Beach opened in the fall of 2009 and an additional one, based in the Mirage Hotel, Las Vegas, opened in the winter of 2009.
Another opened in the New Orleans French Quarter in 2016.

== Television and other appearances ==
King made guest appearances on a number of popular television shows including: &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;, &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;, &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;, &quot;General Hospital&quot;, &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot;, &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, &quot;Married... with Children&quot;, &quot;Sanford and Son&quot; and &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot;.

From the mid-1980s until the mid-1990s, he appeared in several advertisements for McDonald&#x27;s. In the early 2000s he also appeared in a campaign for Burger King.

In 2000, the children&#x27;s show &quot;Between the Lions&quot; featured a singing character named &quot;B.B. the King of Beasts&quot; based on him.

&quot;B.B. King: The Life of Riley&quot;, a feature documentary about him narrated by Morgan Freeman and directed by Jon Brewer, was released on October 15, 2012.

His performance at the 1969 Harlem Cultural Festival appears in the 2021 music documentary &quot;Summer of Soul&quot;.

== Personal life ==
King was married twice, to Martha Lee Denton, from November 1946 to 1952 and to Sue Carol Hall, from 1958 to 1966. He attributed their failure to the heavy demands of his 250 performances a year. It is said that he fathered 15 children with several women. After his death, three more have come forward, claiming him as their father. Though neither of his marriages produced children, biographer Charles Sawyer wrote that doctors found his sperm count too low to conceive children, King never disputed paternity of any of the 15 who claimed it and by all accounts was generous in bankrolling college tuitions and establishing trust funds. In May 2016, the 11 surviving children initiated legal proceedings against his appointed trustee over his estimated $30 million to $40 million estate. Several of them also went public with the allegation that King&#x27;s business manager, LaVerne Toney and his personal assistant, Myron Johnson had fatally poisoned him. Autopsy results showed no evidence of poisoning. A defamation suit filed by Johnson against the accusing family members (including his own sister, Karen Williams) is pending. Other children have filed lawsuits targeting his music estate which remains in dispute.

King was an FAA-certified private pilot and learned to fly in 1963 at what was then Chicago Hammond Airport in Lansing, Illinois. He frequently flew to gigs but in 1995 his insurance company and manager asked him to fly only with another certified pilot. As a result, at around the age of 70, he stopped flying.&lt;ref name=&#x27;Reuters/Billboard 2007-06-29&#x27;&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;

King&#x27;s favorite singer was Frank Sinatra. In his autobiography, he spoke about how he was a &quot;Sinatra nut&quot; and how he went to bed every night listening to Sinatra&#x27;s classic album &quot;In the Wee Small Hours&quot;. During the 1960s, Sinatra had arranged for King to play at the main clubs in Las Vegas. He credited Sinatra for opening doors to black entertainers who were not given the chance to play in white dominated venues.

=== Philanthropy and notable campaigns ===
In September 1970, King recorded Live in Cook County Jail during a time in which issues of racism and class in the prison system were prominent in politics. King also co-founded the Foundation for the Advancement of Inmate Rehabilitation and Recreation tying in his support for prisoners and his interest in prison reform. In addition to prison reform, King also wanted to use prison performances as a way to preserve music and songs in a similar way that Alan Lomax did.

In 2002, he signed on as an official supporter of Little Kids Rock, a nonprofit organization that provides free musical instruments and instruction to children in underprivileged public schools throughout the United States. He sat on the organization&#x27;s honorary board of directors.

Diagnosed with diabetes in 1990, King was a high-profile spokesman in the fight against the disease. He appeared in several television commercials for OneTouch Ultra, a blood glucose monitoring device, beginning in the early 2000s. &quot;American Idol&quot; contestant Crystal Bowersox, who was diagnosed with diabetes at age six, would co-star with King in later commercials.

=== Death and funeral ===
The last eight shows of his 2014 tour were canceled because of health problems caused by complications from high blood pressure and diabetes. On May 14, 2015, at the age of 89, he died in his sleep from vascular dementia caused by a series of small strokes as a consequence of his type 2 diabetes. Two of his daughters alleged that he was deliberately poisoned by two associates trying to induce diabetic shock; an autopsy showed no evidence of that.

His body was flown to Memphis on May 27, 2015. A funeral procession went down Beale Street with a brass band marching in front of the hearse while playing &quot;When the Saints Go Marching In&quot;. Thousands lined the streets to pay their last respects. His body was then driven down Route 61 to his hometown of Indianola, Mississippi. He was laid in repose at the B.B. King Museum and Delta Interpretive Center in Indianola so people could view his open casket. The funeral took place at the Bell Grove Missionary Baptist Church in Indianola on May 30. He was buried at the B.B. King Museum.

<text>Hainaut ( , , ; ; ; ; ), historically also known as Heynault in English, is the westernmost province of Wallonia, the French-speaking region of Belgium.

To its south lies the French department of Nord, while within Belgium it borders (clockwise from the north) on the Flemish provinces of West Flanders, East Flanders, Flemish Brabant and the Walloon provinces of Walloon Brabant and Namur.

Its capital is Mons (Dutch: &quot;Bergen&quot;) and the most populous city is Charleroi, the province&#x27;s urban, economic and cultural hub, the financial capital of Hainaut and the fifth largest city in the country by population. Hainaut is the only Belgian province whose capital is not its largest city. Hainaut has an area of and as of January 2024 a population of over 1.36 million. Another notable city is Tournai (Dutch &quot;Doornik&quot;) on the Scheldt river, one of the oldest cities in Belgium and the first capital of the Frankish Empire.

Hainaut province has a rolling landscape, except for the very southern part, the so-called &quot;Boot of Hainaut&quot;, which is quite hilly and belongs to the Ardennes and its foothills Fagne and the Condroz.

The village of L&#x27;Escaillère in the utmost southeastern corner, at an altitude of 365 metres, is the highest point of the province.

In the Boot of Hainaut on the border of Namur province the artificial five Eau d&#x27;Heure lakes are situated, the largest lake area of Belgium.

A well-known region is the Borinage, the old coal mining region around the city of Mons. Also well-known is the Pays des Collines (English: &quot;Hill Country&quot;), a low hilly area forming one natural region with the Flemish Ardennes in the East Flanders province.

== Language ==
In addition to the main language French, Picard is spoken in the western and central parts of the province, while in the eastern part a mixture of Walloon and Picard is spoken (Wallo-Picard).

Some Flemish and Brabantic dialects of Dutch are spoken in the municipalities bordering the Flemish region.

==History==

The province derives from the French Revolutionary Jemmape department, formed in 1795 from part of the medieval County of Hainaut, the small territory of Tournai and the Tournaisis, a part of the county of Namur (Charleroi), and also a small part of the Prince-Bishopric of Liège (Thuin). (A large part of the historical county of Hainaut is now within France and sometimes referred to as French Hainaut.)
== Subdivisions ==
Hainaut province is divided into 7 administrative districts (&quot;arrondissements&quot;), subdivided into a total of 69 municipalities. It has an area of .

==Governors==
== Economy ==
The gross domestic product (GDP) of the province was €34.2 billion in 2018, accounting for 7.4% of Belgium&#x27;s economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was €22,500 or 75% of the EU27 average in the same year. Hainaut is the province with the second lowest GDP per capita.

==Miscellaneous==
The patron saint of the province Hainaut is Saint Waltrude.

<doc id="152611" wikidata="Q210861" url="?curid=152611" title="Cellular differentiation">
<text>Cellular differentiation is the process in which a stem cell changes from one type to a differentiated one. Usually, the cell changes to a more specialized type. Differentiation happens multiple times during the development of a multicellular organism as it changes from a simple zygote to a complex system of tissues and cell types. Differentiation continues in adulthood as adult stem cells divide and create fully differentiated daughter cells during tissue repair and during normal cell turnover. Some differentiation occurs in response to antigen exposure. Differentiation dramatically changes a cell&#x27;s size, shape, membrane potential, metabolic activity, and responsiveness to signals. These changes are largely due to highly controlled modifications in gene expression and are the study of epigenetics. With a few exceptions, cellular differentiation almost never involves a change in the DNA sequence itself. Metabolic composition, however, gets dramatically altered where stem cells are characterized by abundant metabolites with highly unsaturated structures whose levels decrease upon differentiation. Thus, different cells can have very different physical characteristics despite having the same genome.

A specialized type of differentiation, known as terminal differentiation, is of importance in some tissues, including vertebrate nervous system, striated muscle, epidermis and gut. During terminal differentiation, a precursor cell formerly capable of cell division permanently leaves the cell cycle, dismantles the cell cycle machinery and often expresses a range of genes characteristic of the cell&#x27;s final function (e.g. myosin and actin for a muscle cell). Differentiation may continue to occur after terminal differentiation if the capacity and functions of the cell undergo further changes.

Among dividing cells, there are multiple levels of cell potency, which is the cell&#x27;s ability to differentiate into other cell types. A greater potency indicates a larger number of cell types that can be derived. A cell that can differentiate into all cell types, including the placental tissue, is known as &quot;totipotent&quot;. In mammals, only the zygote and subsequent blastomeres are totipotent, while in plants, many differentiated cells can become totipotent with simple laboratory techniques. A cell that can differentiate into all cell types of the adult organism is known as &quot;pluripotent&quot;. Such cells are called meristematic cells in higher plants and embryonic stem cells in animals, though some groups report the presence of adult pluripotent cells. Virally induced expression of four transcription factors Oct4, Sox2, , and Klf4 (Yamanaka factors) is sufficient to create pluripotent (iPS) cells from adult fibroblasts. A multipotent cell is one that can differentiate into multiple different, but closely related cell types. Oligopotent cells are more restricted than multipotent, but can still differentiate into a few closely related cell types. Finally, unipotent cells can differentiate into only one cell type, but are capable of self-renewal. In cytopathology, the level of cellular differentiation is used as a measure of cancer progression. &quot;Grade&quot; is a marker of how differentiated a cell in a tumor is.

==Mammalian cell types==
Three basic categories of cells make up the mammalian body: germ cells, somatic cells, and stem cells. Each of the approximately 37.2 trillion (3.72x1013) cells in an adult human has its own copy or copies of the genome except certain cell types, such as red blood cells, that lack nuclei in their fully differentiated state. Most cells are diploid; they have two copies of each chromosome. Such cells, called somatic cells, make up most of the human body, such as skin and muscle cells. Cells differentiate to specialize for different functions.

Germ line cells are any line of cells that give rise to gametes—eggs and sperm—and thus are continuous through the generations. Stem cells, on the other hand, have the ability to divide for indefinite periods and to give rise to specialized cells. They are best described in the context of normal human development.
Development begins when a sperm fertilizes an egg and creates a single cell that has the potential to form an entire organism. In the first hours after fertilization, this cell divides into identical cells. In humans, approximately four days after fertilization and after several cycles of cell division, these cells begin to specialize, forming a hollow sphere of cells, called a blastocyst. The blastocyst has an outer layer of cells, and inside this hollow sphere, there is a cluster of cells called the inner cell mass. The cells of the inner cell mass go on to form virtually all of the tissues of the human body. Although the cells of the inner cell mass can form virtually every type of cell found in the human body, they cannot form an organism. These cells are referred to as pluripotent.

Pluripotent stem cells undergo further specialization into multipotent progenitor cells that then give rise to functional cells. Examples of stem and progenitor cells include:
* &quot;Radial glial cells&quot; (embryonic neural stem cells) that give rise to excitatory neurons in the fetal brain through the process of neurogenesis.
* &quot;Hematopoietic stem cells&quot; (adult stem cells) from the bone marrow that give rise to red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.
* &quot;Mesenchymal stem cells&quot; (adult stem cells) from the bone marrow that give rise to stromal cells, fat cells, and types of bone cells
* &quot;Epithelial stem cells&quot; (progenitor cells) that give rise to the various types of skin cells
* &quot;Muscle satellite cells&quot; (progenitor cells) that contribute to differentiated muscle tissue.
A pathway that is guided by the cell adhesion molecules consisting of four amino acids, arginine, glycine, asparagine, and serine, is created as the cellular blastomere differentiates from the single-layered blastula to the three primary layers of germ cells in mammals, namely the ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm (listed from most distal (exterior) to proximal (interior)). The ectoderm ends up forming the skin and the nervous system, the mesoderm forms the bones and muscular tissue, and the endoderm forms the internal organ tissues.
==Dedifferentiation==
Dedifferentiation, or integration, is a cellular process seen in the more basal life forms in animals, such as worms and amphibians where a differentiated cell reverts to an earlier developmental stageusually as part of a regenerative process. Dedifferentiation also occurs in plant cells. And, in cell culture in the laboratory, cells can change shape or may lose specific properties such as protein expressionwhich processes are also termed dedifferentiation.

Some hypothesize that dedifferentiation is an aberration that likely results in cancers, but others explain it as a natural part of the immune response that was lost to humans at some point of evolution.

A newly discovered molecule dubbed reversine, a purine analog, has proven to induce dedifferentiation in myotubes. These manifestly dedifferentiated cellsnow performing essentially as stem cellscould then redifferentiate into osteoblasts and adipocytes.
==Mechanisms==

Each specialized cell type in an organism expresses a subset of all the genes that constitute the genome of that species. Each cell type is defined by its particular pattern of regulated gene expression. Cell differentiation is thus a transition of a cell from one cell type to another and it involves a switch from one pattern of gene expression to another. Cellular differentiation during development can be understood as the result of a gene regulatory network. A regulatory gene and its cis-regulatory modules are nodes in a gene regulatory network; they receive input and create output elsewhere in the network. The systems biology approach to developmental biology emphasizes the importance of investigating how developmental mechanisms interact to produce predictable patterns (morphogenesis). However, an alternative view has been proposed recently. Based on stochastic gene expression, cellular differentiation is the result of a Darwinian selective process occurring among cells. In this frame, protein and gene networks are the result of cellular processes and not their cause.

While evolutionarily conserved molecular processes are involved in the cellular mechanisms underlying these switches, in animal species these are very different from the well-characterized gene regulatory mechanisms of bacteria, and even from those of the animals&#x27; closest unicellular relatives. Specifically, cell differentiation in animals is highly dependent on biomolecular condensates of regulatory proteins and enhancer DNA sequences.

Cellular differentiation is often controlled by cell signaling. Many of the signal molecules that convey information from cell to cell during the control of cellular differentiation are called growth factors. Although the details of specific signal transduction pathways vary, these pathways often share the following general steps. A ligand produced by one cell binds to a receptor in the extracellular region of another cell, inducing a conformational change in the receptor. The shape of the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor changes, and the receptor acquires enzymatic activity. The receptor then catalyzes reactions that phosphorylate other proteins, activating them. A cascade of phosphorylation reactions eventually activates a dormant transcription factor or cytoskeletal protein, thus contributing to the differentiation process in the target cell. Cells and tissues can vary in competence, their ability to respond to external signals.

Signal induction refers to cascades of signaling events, during which a cell or tissue signals to another cell or tissue to influence its developmental fate. Yamamoto and Jeffery investigated the role of the lens in eye formation in cave- and surface-dwelling fish, a striking example of induction. Through reciprocal transplants, Yamamoto and Jeffery found that the lens vesicle of surface fish can induce other parts of the eye to develop in cave- and surface-dwelling fish, while the lens vesicle of the cave-dwelling fish cannot.

Other important mechanisms fall under the category of asymmetric cell divisions, divisions that give rise to daughter cells with distinct developmental fates. Asymmetric cell divisions can occur because of asymmetrically expressed maternal cytoplasmic determinants or because of signaling. In the former mechanism, distinct daughter cells are created during cytokinesis because of an uneven distribution of regulatory molecules in the parent cell; the distinct cytoplasm that each daughter cell inherits results in a distinct pattern of differentiation for each daughter cell. A well-studied example of pattern formation by asymmetric divisions is body axis patterning in Drosophila. RNA molecules are an important type of intracellular differentiation control signal. The molecular and genetic basis of asymmetric cell divisions has also been studied in green algae of the genus &quot;Volvox&quot;, a model system for studying how unicellular organisms can evolve into multicellular organisms. In &quot;Volvox carteri&quot;, the 16 cells in the anterior hemisphere of a 32-cell embryo divide asymmetrically, each producing one large and one small daughter cell. The size of the cell at the end of all cell divisions determines whether it becomes a specialized germ or somatic cell.

==Epigenetic control==
Since each cell, regardless of cell type, possesses the same genome, determination of cell type must occur at the level of gene expression. While the regulation of gene expression can occur through cis- and trans-regulatory elements including a gene&#x27;s promoter and enhancers, the problem arises as to how this expression pattern is maintained over numerous generations of cell division. As it turns out, epigenetic processes play a crucial role in regulating the decision to adopt a stem, progenitor, or mature cell fate This section will focus primarily on mammalian stem cells.

In systems biology and mathematical modeling of gene regulatory networks, cell-fate determination is predicted to exhibit certain dynamics, such as attractor-convergence (the attractor can be an equilibrium point, limit cycle or strange attractor) or oscillatory.

===Importance of epigenetic control===

The first question that can be asked is the extent and complexity of the role of epigenetic processes in the determination of cell fate. A clear answer to this question can be seen in the 2011 paper by Lister R, &quot;et al.&quot; on aberrant epigenomic programming in human induced pluripotent stem cells. As induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are thought to mimic embryonic stem cells in their pluripotent properties, few epigenetic differences should exist between them. To test this prediction, the authors conducted whole-genome profiling of DNA methylation patterns in several human embryonic stem cell (ESC), iPSC, and progenitor cell lines.

Female adipose cells, lung fibroblasts, and foreskin fibroblasts were reprogrammed into induced pluripotent state with the OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and MYC genes. Patterns of DNA methylation in ESCs, iPSCs, somatic cells were compared. Lister R, &quot;et al.&quot; observed significant resemblance in methylation levels between embryonic and induced pluripotent cells. Around 80% of CG dinucleotides in ESCs and iPSCs were methylated, the same was true of only 60% of CG dinucleotides in somatic cells. In addition, somatic cells possessed minimal levels of cytosine methylation in non-CG dinucleotides, while induced pluripotent cells possessed similar levels of methylation as embryonic stem cells, between 0.5 and 1.5%. Thus, consistent with their respective transcriptional activities, DNA methylation patterns, at least on the genomic level, are similar between ESCs and iPSCs.

However, upon examining methylation patterns more closely, the authors discovered 1175 regions of differential CG dinucleotide methylation between at least one ES or iPS cell line. By comparing these regions of differential methylation with regions of cytosine methylation in the original somatic cells, 44-49% of differentially methylated regions reflected methylation patterns of the respective progenitor somatic cells, while 51-56% of these regions were dissimilar to both the progenitor and embryonic cell lines. In vitro-induced differentiation of iPSC lines saw transmission of 88% and 46% of hyper and hypo-methylated differentially methylated regions, respectively.

Two conclusions are readily apparent from this study. First, epigenetic processes are heavily involved in cell fate determination, as seen from the similar levels of cytosine methylation between induced pluripotent and embryonic stem cells, consistent with their respective patterns of transcription. Second, the mechanisms of reprogramming (and by extension, differentiation) are very complex and cannot be easily duplicated, as seen by the significant number of differentially methylated regions between ES and iPS cell lines. Now that these two points have been established, we can examine some of the epigenetic mechanisms that are thought to regulate cellular differentiation.

===Mechanisms of epigenetic regulation===

====Pioneer factors (Oct4, Sox2, Nanog)====
Three transcription factors, OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG – the first two of which are used in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) reprogramming, along with Klf4 and c-Myc – are highly expressed in undifferentiated embryonic stem cells and are necessary for the maintenance of their pluripotency. It is thought that they achieve this through alterations in chromatin structure, such as histone modification and DNA methylation, to restrict or permit the transcription of target genes. While highly expressed, their levels require a precise balance to maintain pluripotency, perturbation of which will promote differentiation towards different lineages based on how the gene expression levels change. Differential regulation of Oct-4 and SOX2 levels have been shown to precede germ layer fate selection. Increased levels of Oct4 and decreased levels of Sox2 promote a mesendodermal fate, with Oct4 actively suppressing genes associated with a neural ectodermal fate. Similarly, increased levels of Sox2 and decreased levels of Oct4 promote differentiation towards a neural ectodermal fate, with Sox2 inhibiting differentiation towards a mesendodermal fate. Regardless of the lineage cells differentiate down, suppression of NANOG has been identified as a necessary prerequisite for differentiation.

====Polycomb repressive complex (PRC2)====
In the realm of gene silencing, Polycomb repressive complex 2, one of two classes of the Polycomb group (PcG) family of proteins, catalyzes the di- and tri-methylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me2/me3). By binding to the H3K27me2/3-tagged nucleosome, PRC1 (also a complex of PcG family proteins) catalyzes the mono-ubiquitinylation of histone H2A at lysine 119 (H2AK119Ub1), blocking RNA polymerase II activity and resulting in transcriptional suppression. PcG knockout ES cells do not differentiate efficiently into the three germ layers, and deletion of the PRC1 and PRC2 genes leads to increased expression of lineage-affiliated genes and unscheduled differentiation. Presumably, PcG complexes are responsible for transcriptionally repressing differentiation and development-promoting genes.

====Trithorax group proteins (TrxG)====
Alternately, upon receiving differentiation signals, PcG proteins are recruited to promoters of pluripotency transcription factors. PcG-deficient ES cells can begin differentiation but cannot maintain the differentiated phenotype. Simultaneously, differentiation and development-promoting genes are activated by Trithorax group (TrxG) chromatin regulators and lose their repression. TrxG proteins are recruited at regions of high transcriptional activity, where they catalyze the trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3) and promote gene activation through histone acetylation. PcG and TrxG complexes engage in direct competition and are thought to be functionally antagonistic, creating at differentiation and development-promoting loci what is termed a &quot;bivalent domain&quot; and rendering these genes sensitive to rapid induction or repression.

====DNA methylation====
Regulation of gene expression is further achieved through DNA methylation, in which the DNA methyltransferase-mediated methylation of cytosine residues in CpG dinucleotides maintains heritable repression by controlling DNA accessibility. The majority of CpG sites in embryonic stem cells are unmethylated and appear to be associated with H3K4me3-carrying nucleosomes. Upon differentiation, a small number of genes, including OCT4 and NANOG, are methylated and their promoters repressed to prevent their further expression. Consistently, DNA methylation-deficient embryonic stem cells rapidly enter apoptosis upon in vitro differentiation.

====Nucleosome positioning====
While the DNA sequence of most cells of an organism is the same, the binding patterns of transcription factors and the corresponding gene expression patterns are different. To a large extent, differences in transcription factor binding are determined by the chromatin accessibility of their binding sites through histone modification and/or pioneer factors. In particular, it is important to know whether a nucleosome is covering a given genomic binding site or not. This can be determined using a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay.

=====Histone acetylation and methylation=====
DNA-nucleosome interactions are characterized by two states: either tightly bound by nucleosomes and transcriptionally inactive, called heterochromatin, or loosely bound and usually, but not always, transcriptionally active, called euchromatin. The epigenetic processes of histone methylation and acetylation, and their inverses demethylation and deacetylation primarily account for these changes. The effects of acetylation and deacetylation are more predictable. An acetyl group is either added to or removed from the positively charged Lysine residues in histones by enzymes called histone acetyltransferases or histone deactylases, respectively. The acetyl group prevents Lysine&#x27;s association with the negatively charged DNA backbone. Methylation is not as straightforward, as neither methylation nor demethylation consistently correlate with either gene activation or repression. However, certain methylations have been repeatedly shown to either activate or repress genes. The trimethylation of lysine 4 on histone 3 (H3K4Me3) is associated with gene activation, whereas trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone 3 represses genes

=====In stem cells=====
During differentiation, stem cells change their gene expression profiles. Recent studies have implicated a role for nucleosome positioning and histone modifications during this process. There are two components of this process: turning off the expression of embryonic stem cell (ESC) genes, and the activation of cell fate genes. Lysine specific demethylase 1 (KDM1A) is thought to prevent the use of enhancer regions of pluripotency genes, thereby inhibiting their transcription. It interacts with Mi-2/NuRD complex (nucleosome remodelling and histone deacetylase) complex, giving an instance where methylation and acetylation are not discrete and mutually exclusive, but intertwined processes.

===Role of signaling in epigenetic control===

A final question to ask concerns the role of cell signaling in influencing the epigenetic processes governing differentiation. Such a role should exist, as it would be reasonable to think that extrinsic signaling can lead to epigenetic remodeling, just as it can lead to changes in gene expression through the activation or repression of different transcription factors. Little direct data is available concerning the specific signals that influence the epigenome, and the majority of current knowledge about the subject consists of speculations on plausible candidate regulators of epigenetic remodeling. We will first discuss several major candidates thought to be involved in the induction and maintenance of both embryonic stem cells and their differentiated progeny, and then turn to one example of specific signaling pathways in which more direct evidence exists for its role in epigenetic change.

The first major candidate is Wnt signaling pathway. The Wnt pathway is involved in all stages of differentiation, and the ligand Wnt3a can substitute for the overexpression of c-Myc in the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells. On the other hand, disruption of β-catenin, a component of the Wnt signaling pathway, leads to decreased proliferation of neural progenitors.

Growth factors comprise the second major set of candidates of epigenetic regulators of cellular differentiation. These morphogens are crucial for development, and include bone morphogenetic proteins, transforming growth factors (TGFs), and fibroblast growth factors (FGFs). TGFs and FGFs have been shown to sustain expression of OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG by downstream signaling to Smad proteins. Depletion of growth factors promotes the differentiation of ESCs, while genes with bivalent chromatin can become either more restrictive or permissive in their transcription.

Several other signaling pathways are also considered to be primary candidates. Cytokine leukemia inhibitory factors are associated with the maintenance of mouse ESCs in an undifferentiated state. This is achieved through its activation of the Jak-STAT3 pathway, which has been shown to be necessary and sufficient towards maintaining mouse ESC pluripotency. Retinoic acid can induce differentiation of human and mouse ESCs, and Notch signaling is involved in the proliferation and self-renewal of stem cells. Finally, Sonic hedgehog, in addition to its role as a morphogen, promotes embryonic stem cell differentiation and the self-renewal of somatic stem cells.

The problem, of course, is that the candidacy of these signaling pathways was inferred primarily on the basis of their role in development and cellular differentiation. While epigenetic regulation is necessary for driving cellular differentiation, they are certainly not sufficient for this process. Direct modulation of gene expression through modification of transcription factors plays a key role that must be distinguished from heritable epigenetic changes that can persist even in the absence of the original environmental signals. Only a few examples of signaling pathways leading to epigenetic changes that alter cell fate currently exist, and we will focus on one of them.

Expression of Shh (Sonic hedgehog) upregulates the production of BMI1, a component of the PcG complex that recognizes H3K27me3. This occurs in a Gli-dependent manner, as Gli1 and Gli2 are downstream effectors of the Hedgehog signaling pathway. In culture, Bmi1 mediates the Hedgehog pathway&#x27;s ability to promote human mammary stem cell self-renewal. In both humans and mice, researchers showed Bmi1 to be highly expressed in proliferating immature cerebellar granule cell precursors. When Bmi1 was knocked out in mice, impaired cerebellar development resulted, leading to significant reductions in postnatal brain mass along with abnormalities in motor control and behavior. A separate study showed a significant decrease in neural stem cell proliferation along with increased astrocyte proliferation in Bmi null mice.

An alternative model of cellular differentiation during embryogenesis is that positional information is based on mechanical signalling by the cytoskeleton using Embryonic differentiation waves. The mechanical signal is then epigenetically transduced via signal transduction systems (of which specific molecules such as Wnt are part) to result in differential gene expression.

In summary, the role of signaling in the epigenetic control of cell fate in mammals is largely unknown, but distinct examples exist that indicate the likely existence of further such mechanisms.

=== Effect of matrix elasticity ===
In order to fulfill the purpose of regenerating a variety of tissues, adult stems are known to migrate from their niches, adhere to new extracellular matrices (ECM) and differentiate. The ductility of these microenvironments are unique to different tissue types. The ECM surrounding brain, muscle and bone tissues range from soft to stiff. The transduction of the stem cells into these cells types is not directed solely by chemokine cues and cell to cell signaling. The elasticity of the microenvironment can also affect the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs which originate in bone marrow.) When MSCs are placed on substrates of the same stiffness as brain, muscle and bone ECM, the MSCs take on properties of those respective cell types.
Matrix sensing requires the cell to pull against the matrix at focal adhesions, which triggers a cellular mechano-transducer to generate a signal to be informed what force is needed to deform the matrix. To determine the key players in matrix-elasticity-driven lineage specification in MSCs, different matrix microenvironments were mimicked. From these experiments, it was concluded that focal adhesions of the MSCs were the cellular mechano-transducer sensing the differences of the matrix elasticity. The non-muscle myosin IIa-c isoforms generates the forces in the cell that lead to signaling of early commitment markers. Nonmuscle myosin IIa generates the least force increasing to non-muscle myosin IIc. There are also factors in the cell that inhibit non-muscle myosin II, such as blebbistatin. This makes the cell effectively blind to the surrounding matrix. Researchers have achieved some success in inducing stem cell-like properties in HEK 239 cells by providing a soft matrix without the use of diffusing factors. The stem-cell properties appear to be linked to tension in the cells&#x27; actin network. One identified mechanism for matrix-induced differentiation is tension-induced proteins, which remodel chromatin in response to mechanical stretch. The RhoA pathway is also implicated in this process.

== Evolutionary history ==
A billion-years-old, likely holozoan, protist, &quot;Bicellum brasieri&quot; with two types of cells, shows that the evolution of differentiated multicellularity, possibly but not necessarily of animal lineages, occurred at least 1 billion years ago and possibly mainly in freshwater lakes rather than the ocean.

<doc id="152613" wikidata="Q265131" url="?curid=152613" title="Lee Miller">
<text>Elizabeth &quot;Lee&quot; Miller, Lady Penrose (April 23, 1907 – July 21, 1977), was an American photographer and photojournalist. Miller was a fashion model in New York City in the 1920s before going to Paris, becoming a fashion and fine-art photographer there.

During World War II, she was a war correspondent for &quot;Vogue&quot;, covering events such as the London Blitz, the liberation of Paris and the concentration camps at Buchenwald and Dachau. Her reputation as an artist in her own right is due mostly to her son&#x27;s discovery and promotion of her work as a fashion and war photographer.

==Early life and education ==
Miller was born on April 23, 1907, in Poughkeepsie, New York. Her parents were Theodore and Florence Miller (née MacDonald). Her father was of German descent, and her mother was of Scottish and Irish descent. She had a younger brother named Erik, and her older brother was the aviator Johnny Miller. Theodore always favored Lee, and often used her as a model for his amateur photography. When she was seven years old, Lee was raped while staying with a family friend in Brooklyn and was infected with gonorrhea. In her childhood, Miller was expelled from almost every school she attended while living in the Poughkeepsie area.

In 1925, aged 18, Miller moved to Paris, where she studied lighting, costume, and design at the Ladislas Medgyes&#x27; School of Stagecraft. She returned to New York in 1926 and joined an experimental drama programme at Vassar College, taught by Hallie Flanagan, a pioneer of experimental theatre. Soon after, Miller left home at 19 to enroll in the Art Students League of New York in Manhattan to study life drawing and painting.

==Career==
===Modeling===
Miller&#x27;s father introduced her and her brothers to photography at an early age. She was his model – he took many stereoscopic photographs of his nude teenage daughter – and showed her technical aspects of the art. At 19 she nearly stepped in front of a car on a Manhattan street but was prevented by Condé Nast, the publisher of &quot;Vogue&quot;. This incident helped launch her modeling career; she appeared in a blue hat and pearls in a drawing by George Lepape on the cover of &quot;Vogue&quot; on March 15, 1927. Miller&#x27;s look was what &quot;Vogue&quot; then editor-in-chief Edna Woolman Chase was looking for to represent the emerging idea of the &quot;modern girl.&quot;

For the next two years, Miller was one of the most sought-after models in New York, photographed by leading fashion photographers, including Edward Steichen, Arnold Genthe, Nickolas Muray, and George Hoyningen-Huene. Kotex used a photograph of Miller by Steichen to advertise their menstrual pads without her knowledge. She was hired by a fashion designer in 1929 to make drawings of fashion details in Renaissance paintings but, in time, grew tired of this and found photography more efficient.

===Photography===

In 1929, Miller traveled to Paris intending to apprentice with the surrealist artist and photographer Man Ray. Although, at first, he insisted that he did not take students, Miller soon became his model and collaborator (announcing to him, &quot;I&#x27;m your new student&quot;), as well as his lover and muse. Some photographs taken by Miller are credited to Man Ray.

Along with Man Ray, Miller rediscovered the photographic technique of solarisation through an accident which has been variously described. One of Miller&#x27;s accounts involved a mouse running over her foot, causing her to switch on the light in the darkroom in mid-development of the photograph. The couple made the technique a distinctive visual signature, examples being Man Ray&#x27;s solarised portrait of Miller taken in Paris circa 1930, and Miller&#x27;s portraits of fellow surrealist Meret Oppenheim (1930), Miller&#x27;s friend Dorothy Hill (1933), and the silent film star Lilian Harvey (1933).

Solarisation fits the surrealist principle of the unconscious accident being integral to art and evokes the style&#x27;s appeal to the irrational or paradoxical in combining opposites of positive and negative. Mark Haworth-Booth describes solarisation as &quot;a perfect surrealist medium in which positive and negative occur simultaneously, as if in a dream&quot;.

Among Miller&#x27;s friends were Duchess Solange d&#x27;Ayen–the fashion editor of French &quot;Vogue&quot;, Pablo Picasso and fellow surrealists Paul Éluard and Jean Cocteau. Cocteau was so mesmerized by Miller&#x27;s beauty that he transformed her into a plaster cast of a classical statue for his film, &quot;The Blood of a Poet&quot; (1930). During a dispute with Man Ray regarding the attribution of their co-produced work, Man Ray is said to have slashed an image of Miller&#x27;s neck with a razor.

After leaving Man Ray and Paris in 1932, Miller returned to New York City. She established a portrait and commercial photography studio (with $10,000 worth of backing from Christian R. Holmes II and Cliff Smith) with her brother Erik (who had worked for the fashion photographer Toni von Horn) as her darkroom assistant. Miller rented two apartments in a building one block from Radio City Music Hall. One of the apartments became her home, while the other became the Lee Miller Studio. Clients of the Lee Miller Studio included BBDO, Henry Sell, Elizabeth Arden, Helena Rubinstein, Saks Fifth Avenue, I. Magnin and Co., and Jay Thorpe.

During 1932, Miller was included in the &quot;Modern European Photography&quot; exhibition at the Julien Levy Gallery in New York and the Brooklyn Museum&#x27;s exhibition &quot;International Photographers&quot; with László Moholy-Nagy, Cecil Beaton, Margaret Bourke-White, Tina Modotti, Charles Sheeler, Man Ray, and Edward Weston. In response to the exhibition, Katherine Grant Sterne wrote a review in &quot;Parnassus&quot; in March 1932, noting that Miller &quot;has retained more of her American character in the Paris milieu. The very beautiful &quot;Bird Cages&quot; at Brooklyn; the study of a pink-nailed hand embedded in curly blond hair which is included in both the Brooklyn and the Julien Levy show; and the brilliant print of a white statue against a black drop, illuminating it rather than distort it.&quot;

In 1933, Julien Levy gave Miller the only solo exhibition of her life. Among her portrait clients were the surrealist artist Joseph Cornell, actresses Lilian Harvey and Gertrude Lawrence, and the African-American cast of the Virgil Thomson–Gertrude Stein opera &quot;Four Saints in Three Acts&quot; (1934).

In 1934, Miller abandoned her studio to marry the Egyptian businessman and engineer Aziz Eloui Bey, who had come to New York City to buy equipment for the Egyptian National Railways. Although she did not work as a professional photographer during this period, the photographs she took while living in Egypt with Eloui, including &quot;Portrait of Space&quot;, a desert landscape seen through a torn fly screen, are regarded as some of her most striking surrealist images. In Cairo, Miller took a photograph of the desert near Siwa that Magritte saw and used as inspiration for his 1938 painting &quot;Le Baiser&quot;. Miller also contributed an object to the &quot;Surrealist Objects and Poems&quot; exhibition at the London Gallery in 1934.

By 1937, Miller had grown bored with her life in Cairo. She returned to Paris and went to a party the day she arrived, where she reconciled with Man Ray, and met the British surrealist painter and curator Roland Penrose.

Four of her photographs, &quot;Egypt&quot; (1939), &quot;Roumania&quot; (1938), &quot;Libya&quot; (1939), and &quot;Sinai&quot; (1939), were displayed at the Zwemmer Gallery&#x27;s 1940 exhibition, &quot;Surrealism To-Day&quot;. The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) included her work in the exhibition &quot;Britain at War&quot; in New York City in 1941. No other exhibition would include her photographs until 1955, when she was included in the renowned &quot;The Family of Man&quot; exhibition curated by Edward Steichen, director of the MoMA Department of Photography.

===World War II===

At the outbreak of World War II, Miller was living at Downshire Hill in Hampstead, London with Penrose when Germany&#x27;s aerial bombardment of the city began. Ignoring pleas from friends and family to return to the U.S., Miller embarked on a new career in photojournalism as the official war photographer for &quot;Vogue&quot;, documenting what became known as the Blitz. Because the British Army would not let her accompany them, she managed to be accredited with the U.S. Army instead as a war correspondent for Condé Nast Publications from December 1942. Miller&#x27;s first article for British &quot;Vogue&quot; was on nurses at an army base in Oxford. She took portraits of nurses across Europe, including those on the front lines and prisoners of war.

Following the D-Day invasion of France in 1944, Miller was tasked with reporting on what she was told was the newly-liberated town of Saint-Malo. She traveled there only to find that the town was still being heavily fought over. Miller&#x27;s military accreditation as a female war correspondent did not allow her to enter an active combat zone, but rather than leave she decided to stay, and spent five days on the front lines photographing as much of the Battle of Saint-Malo as she could. Her photographs included the first recorded use of napalm. When the military authorities realized where she was, they put Miller under temporary house arrest and placed strict limits on her movements.

While she was working with &quot;Vogue&quot; during World War II, Miller&#x27;s goal was to &quot;document war as historical evidence&quot;. Her work provided &quot;context for events&quot; and &quot;an eye-witness account&quot; of the casualties of war. Miller&#x27;s work was very specific and surrealist, like her previous publications and modelling with &quot;Vogue&quot;. She spent time composing her photographs, famously framing some from inside the cattle trains that had transported thousands of Jews to Nazi death camps. Miller&#x27;s work with &quot;Vogue&quot; during wartime was often a combination of journalism and art, sometimes manipulated to evoke emotion.

Miller teamed up with American photojournalist David E. Scherman, a &quot;Life&quot; magazine correspondent, on many assignments, including the liberation of Paris, the Battle of Alsace, and the horrors of the Nazi concentration camps at Buchenwald and Dachau. Scherman&#x27;s iconic photograph of Miller sitting in the bathtub in Adolf Hitler&#x27;s private apartment in Munich, with the dried mud of that morning&#x27;s visit to Dachau on her boots deliberately dirtying Hitler&#x27;s bathroom, was taken in the evening on 30 April 1945, coincidentally the same day that Hitler committed suicide. After posing for the bathtub photograph, Miller took a bath in the tub, and then slept in Hitler&#x27;s bed. She was also photographed in Eva Braun&#x27;s bed.

During this period, Miller photographed dying children in a Vienna hospital, peasant life in post-war Hungary, corpses of Nazi officers and their families, and finally, the execution of former Hungarian Prime Minister László Bárdossy. After the war, she continued working for &quot;Vogue&quot; for another two years, covering fashion and celebrities.

At the war&#x27;s end, Miller&#x27;s work as a wartime photojournalist continued as she sent telegrams back to the British &quot;Vogue&quot; editor, Audrey Withers, urging her to publish photographs from the camps. She did this following a CBS broadcast from Buchenwald by Edward R. Murrow, and Richard Dimbleby&#x27;s BBC broadcast from inside Bergen-Belsen. This was in consequence of people&#x27;s disbelief at such atrocities, when these broadcasters urged photographers to do what they could to show the public what they saw.

===Life in Britain===
After returning to Britain from central Europe, Miller suffered severe episodes of clinical depression which her son believes was due to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). He also described her alcoholism and recovery from alcohol abuse in his 1985 biography, &quot;The Lives of Lee Miller.&quot;

In November 1946, Miller was commissioned by British &quot;Vogue&quot; to illustrate an article titled, &quot;When James Joyce Lived in Dublin&quot;, by Joyce&#x27;s old friend and confidant Constantine Curran. Following a list given to her by Curran, Miller photographed numerous places and people in Dublin, many with a connection to Joyce. The article and photographs appeared in American &quot;Vogue&quot; in May 1947 and British &quot;Vogue&quot; in 1950. The photos provide a remarkable record of Joyce&#x27;s hometown and Dublin during that time.

In 1946, Miller travelled with Roland Penrose to the United States, where she visited Man Ray in California. After she discovered she was pregnant by Penrose, she divorced Bey and, on May 3, 1947, married Penrose. Their only son, Antony Penrose, was born on October 9, 1947. In 1949, the couple bought Farley Farm House in Chiddingly, East Sussex. During the 1950s and 1960s, Farley Farm became a sort of artistic Mecca for visiting artists such as Picasso, Man Ray, Henry Moore, Eileen Agar, Jean Dubuffet, Dorothea Tanning, and Max Ernst.

While Miller continued to do the occasional photo shoot for &quot;Vogue&quot;, she soon discarded the darkroom for the kitchen, becoming a gourmet cook. According to her housekeeper Patsy, she specialized in &quot;historical food&quot; like roast suckling pig as well as treats such as marshmallows in a cola sauce (especially made to annoy English critic Cyril Connolly who told her Americans didn&#x27;t know how to cook).

She also provided photographs for her husband&#x27;s biographies of Picasso and Antoni Tàpies. However, images from the war, especially of the concentration camps, continued to haunt her, and she started on what her son later described as a &quot;downward spiral&quot;. Her depression may have been accelerated by her husband&#x27;s long affair with the trapeze artist Diane Deriaz.

Miller was investigated by the British security service MI5 during the 1940s and 1950s, on suspicion of being a Soviet spy.

In October 1969, Miller was asked in an interview with a &quot;New York Times&quot; reporter what drew her to photography. Her response was that it was &quot;a matter of getting out on a damn limb and sawing it off behind you&quot;.

==Death==
Miller died of lung cancer at Farley Farm House in 1977, aged 70. She was cremated, and her ashes were spread through her herb garden at Farley.

==Legacy==
Miller&#x27;s work has served as inspiration for Gucci&#x27;s Frida Giannini, Ann Demeulemeester, and Alexander McQueen. Playwright David Hare comments, &quot;Today, when the mark of a successful iconographer is to offer craven worship of wealth, or yet more craven worship of power and celebrity, it is impossible to imagine an artist of Lee&#x27;s subtlety and humanity commanding the resources of a mass-market magazine.&quot; Mark Haworth-Booth, curator of &quot;The Art of Lee Miller&quot;, has said &quot;her photographs shocked people out of their comfort zone&quot; and that &quot;she had a chip of ice in her heart... she got very close to things... Margaret Bourke-White was far away from the fighting, but Lee was close. That&#x27;s what makes the difference--Lee was prepared to shock.&quot;

In 1932, for the &quot;Poughkeepsie Evening Star&quot;, Miller stated that photography was &quot;perfectly suited to women as a profession... it seems to me that women have a bigger chance at success in photography than men... women are quicker and more adaptable than men. And I think they have an intuition that helps them understand personalities more quickly than men.&quot;

Throughout her life, Miller did very little to promote her photographic work. That Miller&#x27;s work is known today is mainly due to the efforts of her son, Antony Penrose, who has been studying, conserving, and promoting his mother&#x27;s work since the early 1980s. He discovered sixty thousand or so photographs, negatives, documents, journals, cameras, love letters, and souvenirs in cardboard boxes and trunks in Farley Farm&#x27;s attic after his mother&#x27;s death. He owns the house and offers tours of the works of Miller and Penrose. The house is home to the private collections of Miller and Penrose, their work, and some of their favourite art pieces. In the dining room, the fireplace was decorated in vivid colours by Penrose. Her pictures are accessible at the &quot;Lee Miller Archives&quot;.
In 1985, Penrose published the first biography of Miller, entitled &quot;The Lives of Lee Miller&quot;. Since then, a number of books, mostly accompanying exhibitions of her photographs, have been written by art historians and writers such as Jane Livingstone, Richard Calvocoressi, and Haworth-Booth. Penrose and David Scherman collaborated on the book &quot;Lee Miller&#x27;s War: Photographer and Correspondent With the Allies in Europe 1944–45&quot;, in 1992. Interviews with Penrose form the core of the 1995 documentary &quot;Lee Miller: Through the Mirror&quot;, made with Scherman and writer-director Sylvain Roumette. The audiobook &quot;Surrealism Reviewed&quot; was published in 2002, and a 1946 radio interview with Miller can be heard on it.Missing ref.

A blue plaque was attached to Miller&#x27;s and Penrose&#x27;s residence at 21 Downshire Hill, Hampstead, London.

In 2005, Miller&#x27;s life story was turned into a musical, &quot;Six Pictures of Lee Miller&quot;, with music and lyrics by British composer Jason Carr. It premiered at the Chichester Festival Theatre, West Sussex. Also in 2005, Carolyn Burke&#x27;s substantial biography, &quot;Lee Miller, A Life&quot;, was published.

In 2007, &quot;Traces of Lee Miller: Echoes from St. Malo&quot;, an interactive CD and DVD about Miller&#x27;s war photography in St. Malo, was released with the support of Hand Productions and Sussex University.

In 2015, an exhibition of Miller&#x27;s photographs at the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, &quot;Lee Miller and Picasso&quot;, focussed &quot;on the relationship between Lee Miller, Roland Penrose and Pablo Picasso&quot;. 

Two works of historical fiction, that build their stories around Miller&#x27;s life, work, and relationship with Man Ray in Paris circa 1930, were a book written by Dana Gynther titled&quot;The Woman in the Photograph,&quot; published in 2015, and &quot;The Age of Light&quot;, by Whitney Scharer, released in 2019.

Penrose&#x27;s 1985 biography of Miller was the basis for the 2023 film by Ellen Kuras, &quot;Lee&quot;, with Kate Winslet starring as Miller. Most of the movie shows Miller during World War II, depicting the occasions for some of her most well known pictures from the Blitz, the liberation of Paris, and the Dachau and Buchenwald concentration camps, and including a glimpse into the relationships with main characters in her life, such as her colleague photojournalist David Scherman, British &quot;Vogue&quot; editor Audrey Withers, and her husband Roland Penrose.

In the 2024 film &quot;Civil War&quot; by Alex Garland, Miller was referred as a role model for Kirsten Dunst&#x27;s character, Lee Smith, who is a famed war photographer in much the same way as Miller and has the same first name.

<doc id="152618" wikidata="Q509061" url="?curid=152618" title="Christina Vidal">
<text>Christina Vidal is an American actress and singer. She is best known for her roles in films such as &quot;Life with Mikey&quot;, &quot;Brink!&quot;, &quot;Freaky Friday&quot;, &quot;See No Evil&quot; and for her role in Nickelodeon sitcom &quot;Taina&quot;, in which she played the title character (2001–2002), as Gina Perrello in &quot;Code Black&quot; (2015–2016), and as Detective Valeria Chavez in &quot;Training Day&quot; (2017). She has also starred as Drea in the sitcom &quot;Primo&quot; (2023).

== Early life and education ==
Vidal was born and raised in Whitestone, an area in Queens, New York City, the daughter of Manny Vidal, a tax consultant and businessman, and his wife Josie, a secretary, both of Puerto Rican ancestry. She attended the Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School. When she was 17 in 1998, she joined a girl group called Gemstone (along with Jade Villalon and Crystal Grant). Vidal later moved to Orlando, Florida, to proceed with the filming of &quot;Taina&quot;. Her sisters Lisa and Tanya are also actresses and have appeared on TV and in theatre; she also has a brother, Christian.

== Career ==

=== Acting ===
Vidal&#x27;s acting career began when one of her teachers told her there was an audition for the film &quot;Life with Mikey&quot; (1993), starring Canadian actor Michael J. Fox. She auditioned and got the part of &quot;Angie Vega&quot;, becoming the first Puerto Rican child actress to play a lead in a US film. Since then, Vidal has appeared in feature films and television series. She portrayed Taina Maria Morales in the Nickelodeon sitcom &quot;Taina&quot; in 2001 and 2002. The series ran for two seasons with speculation that it would be renewed for more; according to Vidal, the reason for the show being cancelled was likely due to her recording deal with MCA. Scripts for a third season and a made-for-television movie of the series were already written before Nickelodeon canceled the show.

The next year she played Maddie in the film &quot;Freaky Friday&quot; alongside Lindsay Lohan and starred in the short-lived ABC action TV series about police officers called &quot;10-8: Officers on Duty&quot; until she suddenly left after two months on the show. Also in 2003 she guest-starred in &quot;Sabrina, the Teenage Witch&quot; as Paris Fate. In 2006 she did an untitled sitcom pilot with her sisters for ABC (which was executively produced by George Lopez). The show was not picked up, but later that year she starred in the film &quot;See No Evil&quot; and also had a brief stint on the hit sitcom &quot;Girlfriends&quot;. More recently she has made cameo appearances in the films &quot;I Think I Love My Wife&quot;, &quot;Mask of the Ninja&quot;, and the Internet comedy short &quot;Love Automatically&quot;, written by Mylinda Royer and directed by Allison Haislip. Most recently, Vidal played a supporting character in the film &quot;Magic Man&quot;, which was released in 2009.

=== Music ===
When Vidal was in the band Gemstone, she recorded songs with herself as well as bandmates Jade Villalon and Crystal Celeste Grant performing vocals. A few of these tracks would surface many years later on albums consisting of demos, rare tracks, and special songs of Villalon&#x27;s music project, Sweetbox. In 2002, she was briefly signed to MCA Records and in that time she was supposed to release her first single &quot;Tropical&quot; and her solo debut album &quot;White&quot; in the summer of 2002, but never did. She was also presented with the opportunity to be the lead singer for The Pussycat Dolls, however she was uninterested with the groups image. That same year she provided guest vocals on the remix of Will Smith&#x27;s summer hit &quot;Black Suits Comin&#x27; (Nod Ya Head)&quot; from the &quot;Men in Black II&quot; soundtrack. She was a part of Lupe Fiasco&#x27;s 1st &amp; 15th Entertainment. She also recorded a track for the work out cd called &quot;Byou&quot; from Sabrina Bryan of The Cheetah Girls. The song she recorded was &quot;Anything Is Possible&quot;. She also sang the song &quot;Take Me Away&quot; in the film &quot;Freaky Friday&quot;.

<doc id="152622" wikidata="Q1533599" url="?curid=152622" title="God Bless America">
<text>&quot;God Bless America&quot; is an American patriotic song written by Irving Berlin during World War I in 1918 and revised by him in the run-up to World War II in 1938. The later version was notably recorded by Kate Smith, becoming her signature song.

&quot;God Bless America&quot; takes the form of a prayer (with introductory lyrics noting that &quot;as we raise our voices, in a solemn prayer&quot;) for God&#x27;s blessing and peace for the nation (&quot;...stand beside her and guide her through the night...&quot;).

==History==
Irving Berlin wrote the song while serving in the U.S. Army at Camp Upton in Yaphank, New York at the end of World War I, but decided that it did not fit in a revue called &quot;Yip Yip Yaphank&quot;, so he set it aside. The lyrics at that time included the line &quot;Make her victorious on land and foam, God bless America...&quot; as well as &quot;Stand beside her and guide her &quot;to the right&quot; with the light from above&quot;.

Music critic Jody Rosen says that a 1906 Jewish dialect novelty song, &quot;When Mose with His Nose Leads the Band,&quot; contains a six-note fragment that is &quot;instantly recognizable as the opening strains of &#x27;God Bless America&#x27;&quot;. He interprets this as an example of Berlin&#x27;s &quot;habit of interpolating bits of half-remembered songs into his own numbers.&quot; Berlin, born Israel Baline, had himself written several Jewish-themed novelty tunes.
In 1938, with the rise of Adolf Hitler, Berlin, who was Jewish and had arrived in the U.S. from Russia at the age of five, felt it was time to revive it as a &quot;peace song&quot;, and it was introduced on an Armistice Day broadcast in 1938, sung by Kate Smith on her radio show. This song has become the performer&#x27;s calling card. Berlin had made some minor changes; by this time, &quot;to the right&quot; might have been considered a call to the political right, so he substituted &quot;through the night&quot; instead. He also provided an introduction that is now rarely heard but which Smith always used: &quot;While the storm clouds gather far across the sea / Let us swear allegiance to a land that&#x27;s free / Let us all be grateful for a land so fair, / As we raise our voices in a solemn prayer.&quot; (In her first broadcast of the song, Kate Smith sang &quot;that we&#x27;re far from there&quot; rather than &quot;for a land so fair&quot;.) This was changed when Berlin published the sheet music in March 1939.

Woody Guthrie criticized the song, and in 1940 he wrote &quot;This Land Is Your Land,&quot; originally titled &quot;God Blessed America For Me,&quot; as a response. Anti-Semitic groups such as the Ku Klux Klan also protested against the song due to its authorship by a Jewish immigrant.

In 1943, Smith&#x27;s rendition was featured in the patriotic musical film &quot;This is the Army&quot; along with other Berlin songs. The manuscripts in the Library of Congress reveal the evolution of the song from victory to peace. Berlin gave the royalties of the song to The God Bless America Fund for redistribution to Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts in New York City. Smith performed the song on her two NBC television series in the 1950s. &quot;God Bless America&quot; also spawned another of Irving Berlin&#x27;s tunes, &quot;Heaven Watch The Philippines,&quot; during the end of World War II. The Philippines was an American possession since 1898 and recently liberated from Japanese occupation; Berlin wrote it after he heard Filipinos singing a modified version of the song replacing &quot;America&quot; with &quot;The Philippines.&quot;

The song was used early in the Civil Rights Movement as well as at labor rallies. During the 1960s counterculture, the song was increasingly used by Christian conservatives in the US to signal their opposition to secular liberalism and to silence dissenters who were speaking in favor of communism or in opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War.

Later, from December 11, 1969, through the early 1970s, the playing of Smith singing the song before many home games of the National Hockey League&#x27;s Philadelphia Flyers brought it renewed popularity as well as a reputation for being a &quot;good luck charm&quot; to the Flyers long before it became a staple of nationwide sporting events. The Flyers brought Smith in to perform live before Game 6 of the 1974 Stanley Cup Finals on May 19, 1974, and the Flyers won the Cup that day.

==Lyrics==
&lt;poem&gt;
While the storm clouds gather far across the sea,
Let us swear allegiance to a land that&#x27;s free.
Let us all be grateful for a land so fair,
As we raise our voices in a solemn prayer.

God bless America, land that I love.
Stand beside her and guide her
Through the night with the light from above.

From the mountains to the prairies,
To the oceans white with foam,
God bless America, my home sweet home,
God bless America, my home sweet home.
&lt;/poem&gt;

==Notable public performances==

In 1940, &quot;God Bless America&quot; was the official campaign song for both President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and his Republican opponent, Wendell Willkie. At that time, the song represented cultural and religious tolerance.

Irving Berlin personally performed the song on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; on May 5, 1968, during an episode dedicated to him in honor of his 80th birthday.

During a live television broadcast on the evening of the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001, following addresses by then House and Senate leaders, Speaker Dennis Hastert (Republican) and Tom Daschle (Democrat), members of the United States Congress broke out into an apparently spontaneous verse of &quot;God Bless America&quot; on the steps of the Capitol building in Washington, D.C.

On July 21, 2011, Smith&#x27;s version of the song was played as NASA&#x27;s final wakeup call for Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; (STS-135), capping the 30-year Space Shuttle program.

===Sports events===
====National Hockey League====
&quot;God Bless America&quot; has been performed at home games of the National Hockey League&#x27;s Philadelphia Flyers and those of the Ottawa Senators in which the visiting team is from the United States. (The NHL requires arenas in both the U.S. and Canada to perform both &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; and &quot;O Canada,&quot; the Canadian national anthem, at games that involve teams from both countries.)

At some Flyers&#x27; home games, especially during big games and the playoffs, their main anthem singer, Lauren Hart, has sung &quot;God Bless America&quot; alternating lyrics with Kate Smith on a video screen, until 2019. Smith actually appeared in person to sing at select Flyers games, including their 1974 Stanley Cup clinching game against the Boston Bruins, to which she received a thunderous ovation from the passionate Philadelphia fans. Before games whenever &quot;God Bless America&quot; is performed until 2019, Lou Nolan, the PA announcer for the Flyers at the Wells Fargo Center, would say: &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we ask that you please rise and remove your hats and salute to our flags and welcome the No. 1 ranked anthemist in the NHL, Our very own Lauren Hart, as she sings (if the visiting team is from Canada, O Canada, followed by) God Bless America, accompanied by the great Kate Smith.&quot;

At some Senators home games since , if the visiting team is from the U.S., their main anthem singer, Ontario Provincial Police Constable Lyndon Slewidge, has sung &quot;God Bless America&quot; and &quot;O Canada.&quot; An example of this came during the Senators&#x27; home opener during the 2002–03 season, when they were home against the New Jersey Devils.

During Tom Golisano&#x27;s time as owner of the Buffalo Sabres, the team occasionally substituted &quot;God Bless America&quot; for &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; during certain special events. When this occurred, Ronan Tynan was brought in to sing the song while usual anthem singer Doug Allen sang &quot;O Canada.&quot;

====Major League Baseball====
At Chicago&#x27;s Wrigley Field during the Vietnam War, the song was often played by the organist as part of his postgame playlist while fans filed out of the stadium.

Since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, &quot;God Bless America&quot; is commonly sung during the seventh-inning stretch in Major League Baseball games, most often on Sundays, Opening Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, All-Star Game, Labor Day, September 11, and most post-season Major League Baseball games including the World Series. Following the attacks, John Dever, then the Assistant Media Relations Director of the San Diego Padres, suggested the song replace &quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game&quot;, the more traditional 7th inning anthem. Major League Baseball quickly followed the Padres lead and instituted it league-wide for the rest of the season. Presently, teams decide individually when to play the song.

The New York Yankees, at Yankee Stadium home games, is currently the only Major League club to play &quot;God Bless America&quot; at every game during the seventh-inning stretch. The Yankees&#x27; YES Network televises its performance during all games before going to a commercial. During major games, such as Opening Day, national holidays, playoff contests, or games against the Boston Red Sox or New York Mets, the Yankees will often have Irish tenor Ronan Tynan perform the song.

On August 26, 2008, at a Boston Red Sox game at Yankee Stadium, a fan who had attempted to leave for the restroom during the playing of the song was restrained and subsequently sent out of the building by NYPD officers. Part of the resolution of the resulting lawsuit was that the New York Yankees announced that they would no longer restrict the movement of fans during the playing of the song.

On September 15, 2009, three high school teens filed a lawsuit against New Jersey&#x27;s minor league Newark Bears for being ejected from Eagles Riverfront Stadium over their refusal to stand during the playing of &quot;God Bless America&quot; on June 29, 2009. Before being ejected, they were asked to leave the stadium by Bears president and co-owner Thomas Cetnar.

====American football====
At the January 1, 1976, Rose Bowl, to honor the start of the United States Bicentennial, Kate Smith and the UCLA Band performed &quot;God Bless America&quot; for a national television audience.

During the Super Bowl LI halftime show a pre-recorded introduction by Lady Gaga, who headlined the show, featured both &quot;God Bless America&quot; and &quot;This Land is Your Land&quot;.

====Indianapolis 500====
The Indianapolis 500 is traditionally held at the end of May, and &quot;God Bless America&quot; has been sung there since 2003. The song &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; was sung before, but it was switched to &quot;God Bless America&quot; in the post-9/11 era. The song for many years was performed by Florence Henderson, a native Hoosier, and a friend of the Hulman-George family, the track&#x27;s owners at the time. The performance, often not televised, immediately precedes the national anthem. Henderson routinely sang the entire song, including the prologue, and in some years sang the chorus a second time.

==Recorded versions==
Bing Crosby recorded the song on March 22, 1939, for Decca Records.

The song was recorded by New York City&#x27;s &quot;singing cop,&quot; Daniel Rodríguez, and charted for one week at No. 99 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 as a single. Before the 2001 versions, the last time &quot;God Bless America&quot; had been a &quot;Billboard&quot; chart hit was in 1959 when Connie Francis reached No. 36 with her version (the B-side of her Top 10 hit &quot;Among My Souvenirs&quot;).

On January 20, 2017, Jackie Evancho released &quot;Together We Stand&quot;, a disc containing three patriotic songs including &quot;God Bless America&quot;. The song charted at No. 5 on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Classical Digital Song sales chart.

The Violent Femmes recorded &quot;God Bless America&quot; for their 2019 album &quot;Hotel Last Resort&quot;.

=== Celine Dion ===
On September 21, 2001, following the September 11 attacks, Canadian singer Celine Dion performed &quot;God Bless America&quot; during the television special &quot;&quot;. Shortly afterwards on October 16, 2001 Sony Music released a benefit album called &quot;God Bless America&quot;, which featured Dion singing the song. The album debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and became the first charity album to reach the top since USA for Africa&#x27;s &quot;We Are the World&quot; in 1985. Dion&#x27;s version was released as a promotional single in September 2001 and received enough radio airplay to reach number 14 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Adult Contemporary chart. The music video also premiered in September 2001.

Dion performed the song also a few times during 2002. In 2003, she performed it at Super Bowl XXXVII. She also sang it on July 4, 2004, in her &quot;A New Day...&quot; show. &quot;God Bless America&quot; performed by Dion exists in two versions, live and studio. Both included on collections to gather funds for the victims of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and their families. The live version was released on &quot;America: A Tribute to Heroes&quot; CD and DVD on December 4, 2001. The studio version was released on the &quot;God Bless America&quot; album. The song was recorded on September 20, 2001, the day before the telethon. It was meant to be a replacement for the performance in the event something happened and Dion could not appear. The song was produced by David Foster.

=== LeAnn Rimes ===
In 1997, American country music recording artist LeAnn Rimes recorded a cover of the song on her second studio album, &quot;You Light Up My Life: Inspirational Songs&quot;. After the events of September 11, Rimes rereleased the song on a compilation album by the same name. Rimes also released the song on a CD single. Two versions were released on October 16, 2001. Both versions contain the song as the A-side track, but the B-side tracks were different. One released to the general public was released with the B-side track, &quot;Put a Little Holiday in Your Heart,&quot; and the other was released to radio with the B-side track of Rimes&#x27;s rendition of &quot;The National Anthem.&quot; Rimes&#x27;s version peaked at No. 51 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Country Songs chart on October 27, 2001.

==Parodies==
The song has spawned numerous parodies.

* An irreverent version of the lyrics was printed in the book &quot;The Mad World of William M. Gaines,&quot; by Frank Jacobs (1972). &quot;Mad&quot; magazine&#x27;s veteran art editor, John Putnam, had prepared some copy and sent it to the printers; the word &quot;America&quot; was divided, with a hyphen, at the end of one line. The copy was returned to Putnam by the typesetting foreman, who explained that his union had a rule forbidding the splitting of that word. Putnam obliged, rewriting the copy and sending it back with this enclosure:

::Don&#x27;t break &quot;America&quot;;
::Land we extol;
::Don&#x27;t deface it;
::Upper-case it;
::Keep it clean, keep it pure, keep it whole;
::In Bodoni, in Futura,
::In Old English, in Cabell [sic]--
::Don&#x27;t break &quot;America&quot;--
::Or we&#x27;ll—raise—hell!

*In &quot;Temporarily Humboldt County&quot; on The Firesign Theatre&#x27;s first album &quot;Waiting for the Electrician or Someone Like Him&quot; (1968), a group of Native American men briefly and ironically sing &quot;God bless Vespucciland...&quot; to the tune of &quot;God Bless America&quot; as they fade off into the distance. The reference is a play on the name of Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci, whose first name is the source for the name &quot;America&quot; for the New World.
* In the title track of their 1969 album &quot;How Can You Be in Two Places at Once When You&#x27;re Not Anywhere at All&quot;, The Firesign Theatre briefly break into lines based on the song: &quot;Ask the postman. Ask the mailman. Ask the milkman...white with foam.&quot;
* &quot;God Bless America&quot;, a 2011 film written and directed by Bobcat Goldthwait, is a dark comedy that satirizes the present-day American values. The story revolves around a loveless, jobless, possibly terminally ill man and his 16-year-old female companion, who go on a killing spree against what they consider the stupidest, cruelest, and most repugnant members of American society.

<text>Radiology ( ) is the medical specialty that uses medical imaging to diagnose diseases and guide treatment within the bodies of humans and other animals. It began with radiography (which is why its name has a root referring to radiation), but today it includes all imaging modalities. This includes technologies that use no ionizing electromagnetic radiation, such as ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), as well as others that do use radiation, such as computed tomography (CT), fluoroscopy, and nuclear medicine including positron emission tomography (PET). Interventional radiology is the performance of usually minimally invasive medical procedures with the guidance of imaging technologies such as those mentioned above.

The modern practice of radiology involves a team of several different healthcare professionals. A radiologist, who is a medical doctor with specialized post-graduate training, interprets medical images, communicates these findings to other physicians through reports or verbal communication, and uses imaging to perform minimally invasive medical procedures The nurse is involved in the care of patients before and after imaging or procedures, including administration of medications, monitoring of vital signs and monitoring of sedated patients. The radiographer, also known as a &quot;radiologic technologist&quot; in some countries such as the United States and Canada, is a specially trained healthcare professional that uses sophisticated technology and positioning techniques to produce medical images for the radiologist to interpret. Depending on the individual&#x27;s training and country of practice, the radiographer may specialize in one of the above-mentioned imaging modalities or have expanded roles in image reporting.

== Diagnostic imaging modalities ==
=== Projection (plain) radiography ===


Radiographs (originally called roentgenographs, named after the discoverer of X-rays, Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen) are produced by transmitting X-rays through a patient. The X-rays are projected through the body onto a detector; an image is formed based on which rays pass through (and are detected) versus those that are absorbed or scattered in the patient (and thus are not detected). Röntgen discovered X-rays on November 8, 1895, and received the first Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery in 1901.

In film-screen radiography, an X-ray tube generates a beam of X-rays, which is aimed at the patient. The X-rays that pass through the patient are filtered through a device called a grid or X-ray filter, to reduce scatter, and strike an undeveloped film, which is held tightly to a screen of light-emitting phosphors in a light-tight cassette. The film is then developed chemically and an image appears on the film. Film-screen radiography is being replaced by phosphor plate radiography but more recently by digital radiography (DR) and the EOS imaging. In the two latest systems, the X-rays strike sensors that converts the signals generated into digital information, which is transmitted and converted into an image displayed on a computer screen. In digital radiography the sensors shape a plate, but in the EOS system, which is a slot-scanning system, a linear sensor vertically scans the patient.

Plain radiography was the only imaging modality available during the first 50 years of radiology. Due to its availability, speed, and lower costs compared to other modalities, radiography is often the first-line test of choice in radiologic diagnosis. Also despite the large amount of data in CT scans, MR scans and other digital-based imaging, there are many disease entities in which the classic diagnosis is obtained by plain radiographs. Examples include various types of arthritis and pneumonia, bone tumors (especially benign bone tumors), fractures, congenital skeletal anomalies, and certain kidney stones.

Mammography and DXA are two applications of low energy projectional radiography, used for the evaluation for breast cancer and osteoporosis, respectively.

=== Fluoroscopy ===

Fluoroscopy and angiography are special applications of X-ray imaging, in which a fluorescent screen and image intensifier tube is connected to a closed-circuit television system. This allows real-time imaging of structures in motion or augmented with a radiocontrast agent. Radiocontrast agents are usually administered by swallowing or injecting into the body of the patient to delineate anatomy and functioning of the blood vessels, the genitourinary system, or the gastrointestinal tract (GI tract). Two radiocontrast agents are presently in common use. Barium sulfate (BaSO4) is given orally or rectally for evaluation of the GI tract. Iodine, in multiple proprietary forms, is given by oral, rectal, vaginal, intra-arterial or intravenous routes. These radiocontrast agents strongly absorb or scatter X-rays, and in conjunction with the real-time imaging, allow demonstration of dynamic processes, such as peristalsis in the digestive tract or blood flow in arteries and veins. Iodine contrast may also be concentrated in abnormal areas more or less than in normal tissues and make abnormalities (tumors, cysts, inflammation) more conspicuous. Additionally, in specific circumstances, air can be used as a contrast agent for the gastrointestinal system and carbon dioxide can be used as a contrast agent in the venous system; in these cases, the contrast agent attenuates the X-ray radiation less than the surrounding tissues.

=== Computed tomography ===


CT imaging uses X-rays in conjunction with computing algorithms to image the body.
In CT, an X-ray tube opposite an X-ray detector (or detectors) in a ring-shaped apparatus rotate around a patient, producing a computer-generated cross-sectional image (tomogram). CT is acquired in the axial plane, with coronal and sagittal images produced by computer reconstruction. Radiocontrast agents are often used with CT for enhanced delineation of anatomy. Although radiographs provide higher spatial resolution, CT can detect more subtle variations in attenuation of X-rays (higher contrast resolution). CT exposes the patient to significantly more ionizing radiation than a radiograph.

Spiral multidetector CT uses 16, 64, 254 or more detectors during continuous motion of the patient through the radiation beam to obtain fine detail images in a short exam time. With rapid administration of intravenous contrast during the CT scan, these fine detail images can be reconstructed into three-dimensional (3D) images of carotid, cerebral, coronary or other arteries.

The introduction of computed tomography in the early 1970s revolutionized diagnostic radiology by providing front-line clinicians with detailed images of anatomic structures in three dimensions. CT scanning has become the test of choice in diagnosing some urgent and emergent conditions, such as cerebral hemorrhage, pulmonary embolism (clots in the arteries of the lungs), aortic dissection (tearing of the aortic wall), appendicitis, diverticulitis, and obstructing kidney stones. Before the development of CT imaging, risky and painful exploratory surgery was often the only way to obtain a definitive diagnosis of the cause of severe abdominal pain which could not be otherwise ascertained from external observation. Continuing improvements in CT technology, including faster scanning times and improved resolution, have dramatically increased the accuracy and usefulness of CT scanning, which may partially account for increased use in medical diagnosis.

=== Ultrasound ===
Medical ultrasonography uses ultrasound (high-frequency sound waves) to visualize soft tissue structures in the body in real time. No ionizing radiation is involved, but the quality of the images obtained using ultrasound is highly dependent on the skill of the person (ultrasonographer) performing the exam and the patient&#x27;s body size. Examinations of larger, overweight patients may have a decrease in image quality as their subcutaneous fat absorbs more of the sound waves. This results in fewer sound waves penetrating to organs and reflecting back to the transducer, resulting in loss of information and a poorer quality image. Ultrasound is also limited by its inability to image through air pockets (lungs, bowel loops) or bone. Its use in medical imaging has developed mostly within the last 30 years. The first ultrasound images were static and two-dimensional (2D), but with modern ultrasonography, 3D reconstructions can be observed in real time, effectively becoming &quot;4D&quot;.

Because ultrasound imaging techniques do not employ ionizing radiation to generate images (unlike radiography, and CT scans), they are generally considered safer and are therefore more common in obstetrical imaging. The progression of pregnancies can be thoroughly evaluated with less concern about damage from the techniques employed, allowing early detection and diagnosis of many fetal anomalies. Growth can be assessed over time, important in patients with chronic disease or pregnancy-induced disease, and in multiple pregnancies (twins, triplets, etc.). Color-flow Doppler ultrasound measures the severity of peripheral vascular disease and is used by cardiologists for dynamic evaluation of the heart, heart valves and major vessels. Stenosis, for example, of the carotid arteries may be a warning sign for an impending stroke. A clot, embedded deep in one of the inner veins of the legs, can be found via ultrasound before it dislodges and travels to the lungs, resulting in a potentially fatal pulmonary embolism. Ultrasound is useful as a guide to performing biopsies to minimize damage to surrounding tissues and in drainages such as thoracentesis. Small, portable ultrasound devices now replace peritoneal lavage in trauma wards by non-invasively assessing for the presence of internal bleeding and any internal organ damage. Extensive internal bleeding or injury to the major organs may require surgery and repair.

=== Magnetic resonance imaging ===


MRI uses strong magnetic fields to align atomic nuclei (usually hydrogen protons) within body tissues, then uses a radio signal to disturb the axis of rotation of these nuclei and observes the radio frequency signal generated as the nuclei return to their baseline states. The radio signals are collected by small antennae, called coils, placed near the area of interest. An advantage of MRI is its ability to produce images in axial, coronal, sagittal and multiple oblique planes with equal ease. MRI scans give the best soft tissue contrast of all the imaging modalities. With advances in scanning speed and spatial resolution, and improvements in computer 3D algorithms and hardware, MRI has become an important tool in musculoskeletal radiology and neuroradiology.

One disadvantage is the patient has to hold still for long periods of time in a noisy, cramped space while the imaging is performed. Claustrophobia (fear of closed spaces) severe enough to terminate the MRI exam is reported in up to 5% of patients. Recent improvements in magnet design including stronger magnetic fields (3 teslas), shortening exam times, wider, shorter magnet bores and more open magnet designs, have brought some relief for claustrophobic patients. However, for magnets with equivalent field strengths, there is often a trade-off between image quality and open design. MRI has great benefit in imaging the brain, spine, and musculoskeletal system. The use of MRI is currently contraindicated for patients with pacemakers, cochlear implants, some indwelling medication pumps, certain types of cerebral aneurysm clips, metal fragments in the eyes, some metallic hardware due to the powerful magnetic fields, and strong fluctuating radio signals to which the body is exposed. Areas of potential advancement include functional imaging, cardiovascular MRI, and MRI-guided therapy.

=== Nuclear medicine ===
Nuclear medicine imaging involves the administration into the patient of radiopharmaceuticals consisting of substances with affinity for certain body tissues labeled with radioactive tracer. The most commonly used tracers are technetium-99m, iodine-123, iodine-131, gallium-67, indium-111, thallium-201 and fludeoxyglucose (18F) (18F-FDG). The heart, lungs, thyroid, liver, brain, gallbladder, and bones are commonly evaluated for particular conditions using these techniques. While anatomical detail is limited in these studies, nuclear medicine is useful in displaying physiological function. The excretory function of the kidneys, iodine-concentrating ability of the thyroid, blood flow to heart muscle, etc. can be measured. The principal imaging devices are the gamma camera and the PET Scanner, which detect the radiation emitted by the tracer in the body and display it as an image. With computer processing, the information can be displayed as axial, coronal and sagittal images (single-photon emission computed tomography - SPECT or Positron-emission tomography - PET). In the most modern devices, nuclear medicine images can be fused with a CT scan taken quasisimultaneously, so the physiological information can be overlaid or coregistered with the anatomical structures to improve diagnostic accuracy.

Positron emission tomography (PET) scanning deals with positrons instead of gamma rays detected by gamma cameras. The positrons annihilate to produce two opposite traveling gamma rays to be detected coincidentally, thus improving resolution. In PET scanning, a radioactive, biologically active substance, most often 18F-FDG, is injected into a patient and the radiation emitted by the patient is detected to produce multiplanar images of the body. Metabolically more active tissues, such as cancer, concentrate the active substance more than normal tissues. PET images can be combined (or &quot;fused&quot;) with anatomic (CT) imaging, to more accurately localize PET findings and thereby improve diagnostic accuracy.

The fusion technology has gone further to combine PET and MRI similar to PET and CT. PET/MRI fusion, largely practiced in academic and research settings, could potentially play a crucial role in fine detail of brain imaging, breast cancer screening, and small joint imaging of the foot. The technology recently blossomed after passing the technical hurdle of altered positron movement in strong magnetic field thus affecting the resolution of PET images and attenuation correction.

== Interventional radiology ==

Interventional radiology (IR or sometimes VIR for vascular and interventional radiology) is a subspecialty of radiology in which minimally invasive procedures are performed using image guidance. Some of these procedures are done for purely diagnostic purposes (e.g., angiogram), while others are done for treatment purposes (e.g., angioplasty).

The basic concept behind interventional radiology is to diagnose or treat pathologies, with the most minimally invasive technique possible. Minimally invasive procedures are currently performed more than ever before. These procedures are often performed with the patient fully awake, with little or no sedation required. Interventional radiologists and interventional radiographers diagnose and treat several disorders, including peripheral vascular disease, renal artery stenosis, inferior vena cava filter placement, gastrostomy tube placements, biliary stents and hepatic interventions. Radiographic images, fluoroscopy, and ultrasound modalities are used for guidance, and the primary instruments used during the procedure are specialized needles and catheters. The images provide maps that allow the clinician to guide these instruments through the body to the areas containing disease. By minimizing the physical trauma to the patient, peripheral interventions can reduce infection rates and recovery times, as well as hospital stays. To be a trained interventionalist in the United States, an individual completes a five-year residency in radiology and a one- or two-year fellowship in IR.

==Analysis of images==
=== Plain, or general, radiography ===

The basic technique is optical density evaluation (i.e. histogram analysis). It is then described that a region has a different optical density, e.g. a cancer metastasis to bone can cause radiolucency. The development of this is the digital radiological subtraction. It consists in overlapping two radiographs of the same examined region and subtracting the optical densities Comparison of changes in dental and bone radiographic densities in the presence of different soft-tissue simulators using pixel intensity and digital subtraction analyses. The resultant image only contains the time-dependent differences between the two examined radiographs. The advantage of this technique is the precise determination of the dynamics of density changes and the place of their occurrence. However, beforehand the geometrical adjustment and general alignment of optical density should be done Noise in subtraction images made from pairs of intraoral radiographs: a comparison between four methods of geometric alignment.
Another possibility of radiographic image analysis is to study second order features, e.g. digital texture analysis Basic research Textural entropy as a potential feature for quantitative assessment of jaw bone healing process Comparative Analysis of Three Bone Substitute Materials Based on Co-Occurrence Matrix or fractal dimension Using fractal dimension to evaluate alveolar bone defects treated with various bone substitute materials. On this basis, it is possible to assess the places where bio-materials are implanted into the bone for the purpose of guided bone regeneration. They take an intact bone image sample (region of interest, ROI, reference site) and a sample of the implantation site (second ROI, test site) can be assessed numerically/objectively to what extent the implantation site imitates a healthy bone and how advanced is the process of bone regeneration Fast-Versus Slow-Resorbable Calcium Phosphate Bone Substitute Materials—Texture Analysis after 12 Months of Observation New Oral Surgery Materials for Bone Reconstruction—A Comparison of Five Bone Substitute Materials for Dentoalveolar Augmentation. It is also possible to check whether the bone healing process is influenced by some systemic factors Influence of General Mineral Condition on Collagen-Guided Alveolar Crest Augmentation.

=== Teleradiology ===

Teleradiology is the transmission of radiographic images from one location to another for interpretation by an appropriately trained professional, usually a radiologist or reporting radiographer. It is most often used to allow rapid interpretation of emergency room, ICU and other emergent examinations after hours of usual operation, at night and on weekends. In these cases, the images can be sent across time zones (e.g. to Spain, Australia, India) with the receiving Clinician working his normal daylight hours. However, at present, large private teleradiology companies in the U.S. currently provide most after-hours coverage employing night-working radiologists in the U.S. Teleradiology can also be used to obtain consultation with an expert or subspecialist about a complicated or puzzling case. In the U.S., many hospitals outsource their radiology departments to radiologists in India due to the lowered cost and availability of high speed internet access.

Teleradiology requires a sending station, a high-speed internet connection, and a high-quality receiving station. At the transmission station, plain radiographs are passed through a digitizing machine before transmission, while CT, MRI, ultrasound and nuclear medicine scans can be sent directly, as they are already digital data. The computer at the receiving end will need to have a high-quality display screen that has been tested and cleared for clinical purposes. Reports are then transmitted to the requesting clinician.

The major advantage of teleradiology is the ability to use different time zones to provide real-time emergency radiology services around-the-clock. The disadvantages include higher costs, limited contact between the referrer and the reporting Clinician, and the inability to cover for procedures requiring an onsite reporting Clinician. Laws and regulations concerning the use of teleradiology vary among the states, with some requiring a license to practice medicine in the state sending the radiologic exam. In the U.S., some states require the teleradiology report to be preliminary with the official report issued by a hospital staff radiologist. Lastly, a benefit of teleradiology is that it might be automated with modern machine learning techniques.
== Patient interaction ==
Some radiologists, like teleradiologists, have no interaction with patients. Other radiologists, like interventional radiologists, primarily interact with patients and spend less time analyzing images. Diagnostic radiologists tend to spend the majority of their time analyzing images and a minority of their time interacting with patients. Compared to the healthcare provider who sends the patient to have images interpreted by a diagnostic radiologist, the radiologist usually does not know as much about the patient&#x27;s clinical status or have as much influence on what action should be taken based on the images. Thus, the diagnostic radiologist reports image findings directly to that healthcare provider and often provides recommendations, who then takes the appropriate next steps for recommendations about medical management. Because radiologists undergo training regarding risks associated with different types of imaging tests and image-guided procedures, radiologists are the healthcare providers who generally educate patients about those risks to enable informed consent, not the healthcare provider requesting the test or procedure.

== Professional training ==

=== United States ===

Radiology is a field in medicine that has expanded rapidly after 2000 due to advances in computer technology, which is closely linked to modern imaging techniques. Applying for residency positions in radiology has become highly competitive. Applicants are often near the top of their medical school classes, with high USMLE (board) examination scores. Diagnostic radiologists must complete prerequisite undergraduate education, four years of medical school to earn a medical degree (D.O. or M.D.), one year of internship, and four years of residency training. After residency, most radiologists pursue one or two years of additional specialty fellowship training.

The American Board of Radiology (ABR) administers professional certification in Diagnostic Radiology, Radiation Oncology and Medical Physics as well as subspecialty certification in neuroradiology, nuclear radiology, pediatric radiology and vascular and interventional radiology. &quot;Board Certification&quot; in diagnostic radiology requires successful completion of two examinations. The Core Exam is given after 36 months of residency. Although previously taken in Chicago or Tucson, Arizona, beginning in February 2021, the computer test transitioned permanently to a remote format. It encompasses 18 categories. A passing score is 350 or above. A fail on one to five categories was previously a Conditioned exam, however beginning in June 2021, the conditioned category will no longer exist and the test will be graded as a whole. The Certification Exam, can be taken 15 months after completion of the Radiology residency. This computer-based examination consists of five modules and graded pass-fail. It is given twice a year in Chicago and Tucson. Recertification examinations are taken every 10 years, with additional required continuing medical education as outlined in the Maintenance of Certification document.

Certification may also be obtained from the American Osteopathic Board of Radiology (AOBR) and the American Board of Physician Specialties.

Following completion of residency training, radiologists may either begin practicing as a general diagnostic radiologist or enter into subspecialty training programs known as fellowships. Examples of subspeciality training in radiology include abdominal imaging, thoracic imaging, cross-sectional/ultrasound, MRI, musculoskeletal imaging, interventional radiology, neuroradiology, interventional neuroradiology, paediatric radiology, nuclear medicine, emergency radiology, breast imaging and women&#x27;s imaging. Fellowship training programs in radiology are usually one or two years in length.

Some medical schools in the US have started to incorporate a basic radiology introduction into their core MD training. New York Medical College, the Wayne State University School of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, the Uniformed Services University, and the University of South Carolina School of Medicine offer an introduction to radiology during their respective MD programs. Campbell University School of Osteopathic Medicine also integrates imaging material into their curriculum early in the first year.

Radiographic exams are usually performed by radiographers. Qualifications for radiographers vary by country, but many radiographers now are required to hold a degree.

Veterinary radiologists are veterinarians who specialize in the use of X-rays, ultrasound, MRI and nuclear medicine for diagnostic imaging or treatment of disease in animals. They are certified in either diagnostic radiology or radiation oncology by the American College of Veterinary Radiology.

=== United Kingdom ===
Radiology is an extremely competitive speciality in the UK, attracting applicants from a broad range of backgrounds. Applicants are welcomed directly from the Foundation Programme, as well as those who have completed higher training. Recruitment and selection into training post in clinical radiology posts in England, Scotland and Wales is done by an annual nationally coordinated process lasting from November to March. In this process, all applicants are required to pass a Specialty Recruitment Assessment (SRA) test. Those with a test score above a certain threshold are offered a single interview at the London and the South East Recruitment Office. At a later stage, applicants declare what programs they prefer, but may in some cases be placed in a neighbouring region.

The training programme lasts for a total of five years. During this time, doctors rotate into different subspecialities, such as paediatrics, musculoskeletal or neuroradiology, and breast imaging. During the first year of training, radiology trainees are expected to pass the first part of the Fellowship of the Royal College of Radiologists (FRCR) exam. This comprises a medical physics and anatomy examination. Following completion of their part 1 exam, they are then required to pass six written exams (part 2A), which cover all the subspecialities. Successful completion of these allows them to complete the FRCR by completing part 2B, which includes rapid reporting, and a long case discussion.

After achieving a certificate of completion of training (CCT), many fellowship posts exist in specialities such as neurointervention and vascular intervention, which would allow the doctor to work as an Interventional radiologist. In some cases, the CCT date can be deferred by a year to include these fellowship programmes.

UK radiology registrars are represented by the Society of Radiologists in Training (SRT), which was founded in 1993 under the auspices of the Royal College of Radiologists. The society is a nonprofit organisation, run by radiology registrars specifically to promote radiology training and education in the UK. Annual meetings are held by which trainees across the country are encouraged to attend.

Currently, a shortage of radiologists in the UK has created opportunities in all specialities, and with the increased reliance on imaging, demand is expected to increase in the future. Radiographers, and less frequently Nurses, are often trained to undertake many of these opportunities in order to help meet demand. Radiographers often may control a &quot;list&quot; of a particular set of procedures after being approved locally and signed off by a consultant radiologist. Similarly, radiographers may simply operate a list for a radiologist or other physician on their behalf. Most often if a radiographer operates a list autonomously then they are acting as the operator and practitioner under the Ionising Radiation (Medical Exposures) Regulations 2000. Radiographers are represented by a variety of bodies; most often this is the Society and College of Radiographers. Collaboration with nurses is also common, where a list may be jointly organised between the nurse and radiographer.

=== Germany ===
After obtaining medical licensure, German radiologists complete a five-year residency, culminating with a board examination (known as &quot;Facharztprüfung&quot;).

=== Italy ===
Italian radiologists complete a four-year residency program, after completing the six-year MD program.

===The Netherlands===
Dutch radiologists complete a five-year residency program, after completing the six-year MD program.

===India===
In India, one must obtain a bachelor&#x27;s degree which requires 4.5 years of training, along with 1 year internship, followed by NEET PG examination which is one of the hardest examinations in India. Previous rank data shows only top rankers take radiology which means if the score is less, one might get accepted into other branches, but not radiology. The radiology program is a post graduate 3-year program (MD/DNB Radiology) or a 2-year diploma (DMRD).

===Singapore===
Radiologists in Singapore complete a five-year undergraduate MD program, followed by a one-year internship, and then a five-year residency program. Some radiologists may elect to complete a one or two-year fellowship for further sub-specialization in fields such as interventional radiology.

Slovenia

After finishing a six-year study of medicine and passing the emergency medicine internship, MDs can apply for radiology residency. Radiology is a five-year post-graduate program that involves all fields of radiology with a final board exam.

France

To become a radiologist, after having validated the common core of medical studies, one must obtain a DES (Specialized Studies Diploma) in radiology and medical imaging (specialized studies in 5 years), or a DES in advanced interventional radiology (specialized studies in 6 years). At the end of his DES, once validated, the future doctor will have to defend his “practice thesis” in order to validate his DE (State Diploma) as a doctor of medicine (common to all doctors of medicine therefore) and to be able to practice in France.

===Specialty training for interventional radiology===

Training for interventional radiology occurs in the residency portion of medical education, and has gone through developments.

In 2000, the Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR) created a program named &quot;Clinical Pathway in IR&quot;, which modified the &quot;Holman Pathway&quot; that was already accepted by the American Board of Radiology to including training in IR; this was accepted by ABR but was not widely adopted. In 2005 SIR proposed and ABR accepted another pathway called &quot;DIRECT (Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology Enhanced Clinical Training) Pathway&quot; to help trainees coming from other specialities learn IR; this too was not widely adopted. In 2006 SIR proposed a pathway resulting in certification in IR as a speciality; this was eventually accepted by the ABR in 2007 and was presented to the American Board of Medical Specialities (ABMS) in 2009, which rejected it because it did not include enough diagnostic radiology (DR) training. The proposal was reworked, at the same time that overall DR training was being revamped, and a new proposal that would lead to a dual DR/IR specialization was presented to the ABMS and was accepted in 2012 and eventually was implemented in 2014. By 2016 the field had determined that the old IR fellowships would be terminated by 2020.

A handful of programs have offered interventional radiology fellowships that focus on training in the treatment of children.

In Europe the field followed its own pathway; for example in Germany the parallel interventional society began to break free of the DR society in 2008. In the UK, interventional radiology was approved as a sub-specialty of clinical radiology in 2010. While many countries have an interventional radiology society, there is also the European-wide Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiological Society of Europe, whose aim is to support teaching, science, research and clinical practice in the field by hosting meetings, educational workshops and promoting patient safety initiatives. Furthermore, the Society provides an examination, the European Board of Interventional Radiology (EBIR), which is a highly valuable qualification in interventional radiology based on the European Curriculum and Syllabus for IR.

<text>Big-5 or Big5 () is a Chinese character encoding method used in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau for traditional Chinese characters.

The People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC), which uses simplified Chinese characters, uses the GB 18030 character set instead (though it can also substitute Big-5 or UTF-8).

Big5 gets its name from the consortium of five companies in Taiwan that developed it.

==Encoding==
The original Big5 character set is sorted first by usage frequency, second by stroke count, lastly by Kangxi radical.

The original Big5 character set lacked many commonly used characters. To solve this problem, each vendor developed its own extension. The ETen extension became part of the current Big5 standard through popularity.

The structure of Big5 does not conform to the ISO 2022 standard, but rather bears a certain similarity to the encoding. It is a double-byte character set (DBCS) with the following structure:

(the prefix 0x signifying hexadecimal numbers).

Standard assignments (excluding vendor or user-defined extensions) do not use the bytes through , nor , as either lead (first) or trail (second) bytes. Bytes through are used for both lead and trail bytes for double-byte (Big5) codes. Bytes through are used as trail bytes following a lead byte, or for single-byte codes otherwise. If the second byte is not in either range, behavior is unspecified (i.e., varies from system to system). Additionally, certain variants of the Big5 character set, for example the HKSCS, use an expanded range for the lead byte, including values in the to range (similar to ), whereas others use reduced lead byte ranges (for instance, the Apple Macintosh variant uses through as single-byte codes, limiting the lead byte range to through ).

The numerical value of individual Big5 codes are frequently given as a 4-digit hexadecimal number, which describes the two bytes that comprise the Big5 code as if the two bytes were a big endian representation of a 16-bit number. For example, the Big5 code for a full-width space, which are the bytes , is usually written as or just A140.

Strictly speaking, the Big5 encoding contains only DBCS characters. However, in practice, the Big5 codes are always used together with an unspecified, system-dependent single-byte character set (SBCS) (such as ASCII or code page 437), so that Big5-encoded text contains a mix of double-byte characters and single-byte characters. Bytes in the range to that are not part of a double-byte character are assumed to be single-byte characters. (For a more detailed description of this problem, please see the discussion on &quot;The Matching SBCS&quot; below.)

The meaning of non-ASCII single bytes outside the permitted values that are not part of a double-byte character varies from system to system. In old MSDOS-based systems, they are likely to be displayed as 8-bit characters; in modern systems, they are likely to either give unpredictable results or generate an error.

===A more detailed look at the organization===
In the original Big5, the encoding is compartmentalized into different zones:

The &quot;graphical characters&quot; actually comprise punctuation marks, partial punctuation marks (e.g., half of a dash, half of an ellipsis; see below), dingbats, foreign characters, and other special characters (e.g., presentational &quot;full width&quot; forms, digits for Suzhou numerals, zhuyin fuhao, etc.)

In most vendor extensions, extended characters are placed in the various zones reserved for user-defined characters, each of which are normally regarded as associated with the preceding zone. For example, additional &quot;graphical characters&quot; (e.g., punctuation marks) would be expected to be placed in the – range, and additional logograms would be placed in either the – or the – range. Sometimes, this is not possible due to the large number of extended characters to be added;
for example, Cyrillic letters and Japanese kana have been placed in the zone associated with &quot;frequently-used characters&quot;.

===Duplicates===
Big5 has encoded two duplicate characters: &quot;兀&quot; on 0xA461 (U+5140) and 0xC94A (U+FA0C), &quot;嗀&quot; on 0xDCD1 (U+55C0) and 0xDDFC (U+FA0D).

Some encoding mapping also maps the three Suzhou numerals, &quot;〸&quot;, &quot;〹&quot; and &quot;〺&quot;, in the graphical section to ideograph characters (U+5341, U+5344 and U+5345 respectively) instead of CJK Symbols and Punctuation (U+3038, U+3039 and U+303A respectively).

===What a Big5 code actually encodes===
An individual Big5 code does not always represent a complete semantic unit. The Big5 codes of logograms are always logograms, but codes in the &quot;graphical characters&quot; section are not always complete &quot;graphical characters&quot;. What Big5 encodes are particular graphical representations of characters or part of characters that happen to fit in the space taken by two monospaced ASCII characters. This is a property of CJK double-byte character sets, and is not a unique problem of Big5.

(The above might need some explanation by putting it in historical perspective, as it is &quot;theoretically&quot; incorrect: Back when text mode personal computing was still the norm, characters were normally represented as single bytes and each character takes one position on the screen. There was therefore a practical reason to insist that double-byte characters must take up two positions on the screen, namely that off-the-shelf, American-made software would then be usable without modification in a DBCS-based system. If a character can take an arbitrary number of screen positions, software that assumes that one &quot;byte&quot; of text takes one screen position would produce incorrect output. Of course, if a computer never had to deal with the text screen, the manufacturer would not enforce this artificial restriction; the Apple Macintosh is an example. Nevertheless, the encoding itself must be designed so that it works correctly on text-screen-based systems.)

To illustrate this point, consider the Big5 code (…). To English speakers this looks like an ellipsis and the Unicode standard identifies it as such; however, in Chinese, the ellipsis consists of six dots that fit in the space of two Chinese characters (……), so in fact there is no Big5 code for the Chinese ellipsis, and the Big5 code just represents half of a Chinese ellipsis. It represents only half of an ellipsis because the whole ellipsis should take the space of two Chinese characters, and in many DBCS systems one DBCS character must take exactly the space of one Chinese character.

Characters encoded in Big5 do not always represent things that can be readily used in plain text files; an example is &quot;citation mark&quot; (, ﹋), which is, when used, required to be typeset under the title of literary works. Another example is the Suzhou numerals, which is a form of scientific notation that requires the number to be laid out in a 2-D form consisting of at least two rows.

===The Matching SBCS===
In practice, Big5 cannot be used without a matching SBCS; this is mostly to do with a compatibility reason. However, as in the case of other CJK DBCS character sets, the SBCS to use has never been specified. Big5 has always been defined as a DBCS, though when used it must be paired with a suitable, &quot;unspecified&quot; SBCS and therefore used as what some people call a MBCS; nevertheless, Big5 by itself, as defined, is strictly a DBCS.

The SBCS to use being unspecified implies that the SBCS used can theoretically vary from system to system. Nowadays, ASCII is the only possible SBCS one would use. However, in old DOS-based systems, code page 437—with its extra special symbols in the control code area including position 127—was much more common. Yet, on a Macintosh system with the Chinese Language Kit, or on a Unix system running the cxterm terminal emulator, the SBCS paired with Big5 would not be code page 437.

Outside the valid range of Big5, the old DOS-based systems would routinely interpret things according to the SBCS that is paired with Big5 on that system. In such systems, characters 127 to 160, for example, were very likely not avoided because they would produce invalid Big5, but used because they would be valid characters in code page 437.

The modern characterization of Big5 as an MBCS consisting of the DBCS of Big5 plus the SBCS of ASCII is therefore historically incorrect and potentially flawed, as the choice of the matching SBCS was, and theoretically still is, quite independent of the flavour of Big5 being used.

==History==
The inability of ASCII to support large Chinese, Japanese and Korean (CJK) character sets led to governments and industry to find creative solutions to enable their languages to be rendered on computers. A variety of ad hoc and usually proprietary input methods led to efforts to develop a standard system. As a result, Big5 encoding was defined by the Institute for Information Industry of Taiwan in 1984.

The name &quot;Big5&quot; is in recognition that the standard emerged from collaboration of five of Taiwan&#x27;s largest IT firms:

* Acer (宏碁)
* MiTAC (神通)
* JiaJia (佳佳)
* ZERO ONE Technology (零壹 or 01tech)
* First International Computer (FIC) (大眾)

Big5 was rapidly popularized in Taiwan and worldwide among Chinese who used the traditional Chinese character set through its adoption in several commercial software packages, notably the E-TEN Chinese DOS input system (ETen Chinese System). The Republic of China government declared Big5 as their standard in mid-1980s since it was, by then, the &quot;de facto&quot; standard for using traditional Chinese on computers.

==Extensions==
The original Big-5 only include CJK logograms from the Charts of Standard Forms of Common National Characters (4808 characters) and Less-Than-Common National Characters (6343 characters), but not letters from people&#x27;s names, place names, dialects, chemistry, biology, Japanese kana. As a result, many Big-5 supporting software include extensions to address the problems.

The plethora of variations make UTF-8 (or UTF-16 or the Chinese GB 18030 standard, which is also a full Unicode Transformation Format, i.e. not only for simplified Chinese) a more consistent code page for modern use.

===Vendor extensions===
====ETen extensions====
In the ETen (倚天) Chinese operating system, the following code points are added, to add support for some characters present in the IBM 5550&#x27;s code page but absent from generic Big5:

* codice_1–codice_2: 33 control characters.
* codice_3–codice_4: circle 1–10, bracket 1–10, Roman numerals 1–9 (i–ix), CJK radical glyphs, Japanese hiragana, Japanese katakana, Cyrillic characters
* codice_5–codice_6: the characters &#x27;&#x27;, &#x27;&#x27;, &#x27;&#x27;, &#x27;&#x27;, &#x27;&#x27;, &#x27;&#x27; and &#x27;&#x27;, followed by 34 additional semigraphic symbols.

In some versions of ETen, there are extra graphical symbols and simplified Chinese characters.

====Microsoft code pages====
Microsoft (微軟) created its own version of Big5 extension as code page 950 for use with Microsoft Windows, which supports the F9D6–F9FE code points from ETEN&#x27;s extensions. In some versions of Windows, the euro currency symbol is mapped to Big-5 code point A3E1.

After installing Microsoft&#x27;s HKSCS patch on top of traditional Chinese Windows (or any version of Windows 2000 and above with proper language pack), applications using code page 950 automatically use a hidden code page 951 table. The table supports all code points in HKSCS-2001, except for the compatibility code points specified by the standard.

====IBM code pages====
In contrast to Microsoft&#x27;s code page 950, IBM&#x27;s CCSID 950 comprises single byte code page 1114 (CCSID 1114) and double byte code page 947 (CCSID 947). It incorporates ETEN extensions for lead bytes , , and , while omitting those with lead byte (which Microsoft includes), mapping them instead to the Private Use Area as user-defined characters. It also includes two non-ETEN extension regions with trail bytes , i.e. outside the usual Big5 trail byte range but similar to the Big5+ trail byte range: area 5 has lead bytes and contains IBM-selected characters, while area 9 has lead bytes and is a user-defined region.

IBM refers to the euro sign update of their Big-5 variant as CCSID 1370, which includes both single-byte () and double-byte () euro signs. It comprises single byte code page 1114 (CCSID 5210) and double byte code page 947 (CCSID 21427). For better compatibility with Microsoft&#x27;s variant in IBM Db2, IBM also define the pure double-byte code page 1372 and the associated variable-width CCSID 1373, which corresponds to Microsoft&#x27;s code page 950.

IBM assigns CCSID 5471 to the HKSCS-2001 Big5 code page (with CPGID 1374 as CCSID 5470 as the double byte component), CCSID 9567 to the HKSCS-2004 code page (with CPGID 1374 as CCSID 9566 as the double byte component), and CCSID 13663 to the HKSCS-2008 code page (with CPGID 1374 as CCSID 13662 as the double byte component), while CCSID 1375 is assigned to a growing HKSCS code page, currently equivalent to CCSID 13663.

====ChinaSea font====
ChinaSea fonts (中國海字集) are Traditional Chinese fonts made by ChinaSea. The fonts are rarely sold separately, but are bundled with other products, such as the Chinese version of Microsoft Office 97. The fonts support Japanese kana, kokuji, and other characters missing in Big-5. As a result, the ChinaSea extensions have become more popular than the government-supported extensions. Some Hong Kong BBSes had used encodings in ChinaSea fonts before the introduction of HKSCS.

====&#x27;Sakura&#x27; font====
The &#x27;Sakura&#x27; font (日和字集 Sakura Version) is developed in Hong Kong and is designed to be compatible with HKSCS. It adds support for kokuji and proprietary dingbats (including Doraemon) not found in HKSCS.

====Unicode-at-on====
Unicode-at-on (Unicode補完計畫), formerly BIG5 extension, extends BIG-5 by altering code page tables, but uses the ChinaSea extensions starting with version 2. However, with the bankruptcy of ChinaSea, late development, and the increasing popularity of HKSCS and Unicode (the project is not compatible with HKSCS), the success of this extension is limited at best.

Despite the problems, characters previously mapped to Unicode Private Use Area are remapped to the standardized equivalents when exporting characters to Unicode format.

====OPG====
The web sites of the Oriental Daily News and Sun Daily, belonging to the Oriental Press Group Limited (東方報業集團有限公司) in Hong Kong, used a downloadable font with a different Big-5 extension coding than the HKSCS.

===Official extensions===
====Taiwan Ministry of Education font====
The Taiwan Ministry of Education supplied its own font, the Taiwan Ministry of Education font (臺灣教育部造字檔) for use internally.

====Taiwan Council of Agriculture font====
Taiwan&#x27;s Council of Agriculture font, Executive Yuan introduced a 133-character custom font, the Taiwan Council of Agriculture font (臺灣農委會常用中文外字集) that includes 84 characters from the fish radical and 7 from the bird radical.

====Big5+====
The Chinese Foundation for Digitization Technology (中文數位化技術推廣委員會) introduced Big5+ in 1997, which used over 20000 code points to incorporate all CJK logograms in Unicode 1.1. However, the extra code points exceeded the original Big-5 definition (Big5+ uses high byte values 81-FE and low byte values 40-7E and 80-FE), preventing it from being installed on Microsoft Windows without new codepage files.

====Big-5E====
To allow Windows users to use custom fonts, the Chinese Foundation for Digitization Technology introduced Big-5E, which added 3954 characters (in three blocks of code points: 8E40-A0FE, 8140-86DF, 86E0-875C) and removed the Japanese kana from the ETEN extension. Unlike Big-5+, Big5E extends Big-5 within its original definition. Mac OS X 10.3 and later supports Big-5E in the fonts LiHei Pro (儷黑 Pro.ttf) and LiSong Pro (儷宋 Pro.ttf).

====Big5-2003====
The Chinese Foundation for Digitization Technology made a Big5 definition and put it into CNS 11643 in note form, making it part of the official standard in Taiwan.

Big5-2003 incorporates all Big-5 characters introduced in the 1984 ETEN extensions (code points A3C0-A3E0, C6A1-C7F2, and F9D6-F9FE) and the Euro symbol. Cyrillic characters were not included because the authority claimed CNS 11643 does not include such characters.

====CDP====
The Academia Sinica made a Chinese Data Processing font (漢字構形資料庫) in late 1990s, which the latest release version 2.5 included 112,533 characters, some less than the Mojikyo fonts.

====HKSCS====
Hong Kong also adopted Big5 for character encoding. However, written Cantonese has its own characters not available in the normal Big5 character set. To solve this problem, the Hong Kong Government created the Big5 extensions Government Chinese Character Set (GCCS) in 1995 and Hong Kong Supplementary Character Set in 1999. The Hong Kong extensions were commonly distributed as a patch. It is still being distributed as a patch by Microsoft, but a full Unicode font is also available from the Hong Kong Government&#x27;s web site.

There are two encoding schemes of HKSCS: one encoding scheme is for the Big-5 coding standard and the other is for the ISO 10646 standard. Subsequent to the initial release, there are also HKSCS-2001 and HKSCS-2004. The HKSCS-2004 is aligned technically with the ISO/IEC 10646:2003 and its Amendment 1 published in April 2004 by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).

HKSCS includes all the characters from the common ETen extension, plus some characters from simplified Chinese, place names, people&#x27;s names, and Cantonese phrases (including profanity).

, the most recent edition of HKSCS is HKSCS-2016; however, the last edition of HKSCS to encode all of its characters in Big5 was HKSCS-2008, while the characters added in more recent editions are mapped to ISO 10646 / Unicode only (as a CJK Unified Ideographs horizontal glyph extension where appropriate). Additionally, similarly to Hong Kong&#x27;s situation, there are also characters that are needed by Macao but is neither included in Big5 nor HKSCS, hence, the &quot;Macao Supplementary Character Set&quot; was developed, comprising characters not found in Big5 or HKSCS; this, however, is also not encoded in Big5. The first batch of 121 MSCS characters were submitted for inclusion in or mapping to Unicode in 2009, and the first final version of MSCS was established in 2020.

==Kana and Cyrillic==
There are two major Big5 extension layouts for encoding kana, Russian Cyrillic and list markers in the range 0xC6A1 through 0xC875. These are not compatible with one another. They are compared in the table below.

The ETEN layout of kana and Cyrillic is also used by the HKSCS (including HTML5) and Unicode-At-On variants, as well as by IBM&#x27;s version of code page 950, and the ETEN layout of the kana (with Cyrillic omitted) is also used by the Big5-2003 variant. The published mapping files for Windows-950 include neither, and this Big5 range is mapped to the Private Use Area by the Windows-950 implementation from International Components for Unicode. Python&#x27;s built-in codec implementation is using the BIG5.TXT layout. The classic Mac OS version includes neither layout.

<text>Ethnography is a branch of anthropology and the systematic study of individual cultures. It explores cultural phenomena from the point of view of the subject of the study. Ethnography is also a type of social research that involves examining the behavior of the participants in a given social situation and understanding the group members&#x27; own interpretation of such behavior.

As a form of inquiry, ethnography relies heavily on participant observation, where the researcher participates in the setting or with the people being studied, at least in some marginal role, and seeking to document, in detail, patterns of social interaction and the perspectives of participants, and to understand these in their local contexts. It had its origin in social and cultural anthropology in the early twentieth century, but has, since then, spread to other social science disciplines, notably sociology.

Ethnographers mainly use qualitative methods, though they may also include quantitative data. The typical ethnography is a holistic study and so includes a brief history, and an analysis of the terrain, the climate, and the habitat. A wide range of groups and organisations have been studied by this method, including traditional communities, youth gangs, religious cults, and organisations of various kinds. While, traditionally, ethnography has relied on the physical presence of the researcher in a setting, there is research using the label that has relied on interviews or documents, sometimes to investigate events in the past such as the NASA &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster. There is also ethnography done in &quot;virtual&quot; or online environments, sometimes labelled netnography or cyber-ethnography.

==Origins==

The term &quot;ethnography&quot; is from Greek ( &quot;éthnos&quot; &quot;folk, people, nation&quot; and &quot;gráphō&quot; &quot;I write&quot;) and encompasses the ways in which ancient authors described and analyzed foreign cultures. Anthony Kaldellis loosely suggests the &quot;Odyssey&quot; as a starting point for ancient ethnography, while noting that Herodotus&#x27; &quot;Histories&quot; is the usual starting point; while Edith Hall has argued that Homeric poetry lacks &quot;the coherence and vigour of ethnological science&quot;. From Herodotus forward, ethnography was a mainstay of ancient historiography.

Tacitus has ethnographies in the &quot;Agricola&quot;, &quot;Histories&quot;, and &quot;Germania&quot;. Tacitus&#x27; &quot;Germania&quot; &quot;stands as the sole surviving full-scale monograph by a classical author on an alien people.&quot; Ethnography formed a relatively coherent subgenre in Byzantine literature.

===Development as a science===

While ethnography (&quot;ethnographic writing&quot;) was widely practiced in antiquity, ethnography as a science (cf. ethnology) did not exist in the ancient world. There is no ancient term or concept applicable to ethnography, and those writers probably did not consider the study of other cultures as a distinct mode of inquiry from history.
Gerhard Friedrich Müller developed the concept of ethnography as a separate discipline whilst participating in the Second Kamchatka Expedition (1733–43) as a professor of history and geography. Whilst involved in the expedition, he differentiated &quot;Völker-Beschreibung&quot; as a distinct area of study. This became known as &quot;ethnography&quot;, following the introduction of the Greek neologism &quot;ethnographia&quot; by Johann Friedrich Schöpperlin and the German variant by A. F. Thilo in 1767. August Ludwig von Schlözer and Christoph Wilhelm Jacob Gatterer of the University of Göttingen introduced the term into the academic discourse in an attempt to reform the contemporary understanding of world history.

==Features of ethnographic research==
According to Dewan (2018), the researcher is not looking for generalizing the findings; rather, they are considering it in reference to the context of the situation. In this regard, the best way to integrate ethnography in a quantitative research would be to use it to discover and uncover relationships and then use the resultant data to test and explain the empirical assumptions.

In ethnography, the researcher gathers what is available, what is normal, what it is that people do, what they say, and how they work.

Ethnography can also be used in other methodological frameworks, for instance, an action research program of study where one of the goals is to change and improve the situation.

Ethnographic research is a fundamental methodology in cultural ecology, development studies, and feminist geography. In addition, it has gained importance in social, political, cultural, and nature-society geography. Ethnography is an effective methodology in qualitative geographic research that focuses on people&#x27;s perceptions and experiences and their traditionally place-based immersion within a social group.

==Data collection methods==
According to John Brewer, a leading social scientist, data collection methods are meant to capture the &quot;social meanings and ordinary activities&quot; of people (informants) in &quot;naturally occurring settings&quot; that are commonly referred to as &quot;the field&quot;. The goal is to collect data in such a way that the researcher imposes a minimal amount of personal bias in the data. Multiple methods of data collection may be employed to facilitate a relationship that allows for a more personal and in-depth portrait of the informants and their community. These can include participant observation, field notes, interviews and surveys, as well as various visual methods.

Interviews are often taped and later transcribed, allowing the interview to proceed unimpaired of note-taking, but with all information available later for full analysis. Secondary research and document analysis are also used to provide insight into the research topic. In the past, kinship charts were commonly used to &quot;discover logical patterns and social structure in non-Western societies&quot;. In the 21st century, anthropology focuses more on the study of people in urban settings and the use of kinship charts is seldom employed.

In order to make the data collection and interpretation transparent, researchers creating ethnographies often attempt to be &quot;reflexive&quot;. Reflexivity refers to the researcher&#x27;s aim &quot;to explore the ways in which [the] researcher&#x27;s involvement with a particular study influences, acts upon and informs such research&quot;.[Marvasti, Amir &amp; Gubrium, Jaber. 2023. Crafting Ethnographic Fieldwork: Sites, Selves &amp; Social Worlds. Routledge. Despite these attempts of reflexivity, no researcher can be totally unbiased. This factor has provided a basis to criticize ethnography.

Traditionally, the ethnographer focuses attention on a community, selecting knowledgeable informants who know the activities of the community well. These informants are typically asked to identify other informants who represent the community, often using snowball or chain sampling. This process is often effective in revealing common cultural denominators connected to the topic being studied. Ethnography relies greatly on up-close, personal experience. Participation, rather than just observation, is one of the keys to this process. Ethnography is very useful in social research.

An inevitability during ethnographic participation is that the researcher experiences at least some resocialization. In other words, the ethnographer to some extent &quot;becomes&quot; what they are studying. For instance, an ethnographer may become skilled at a work activity that they are studying; they may become members of a particular religious group they are interested in studying; or they may even inhabit a familial role in a community they are staying with. Robert M. Emerson, Rachel Fretz, and Linda Shaw summarize this idea in their book Writing Ethnographic Field Notes using a common metaphor: &quot;the fieldworker cannot and should not attempt to be a fly on the wall.&quot; 

Ybema &quot;et al.&quot; (2010) examine the ontological and epistemological presuppositions underlying ethnography. Ethnographic research can range from a realist perspective, in which behavior is observed, to a constructivist perspective where understanding is socially constructed by the researcher and subjects. Research can range from an objectivist account of fixed, observable behaviors to an interpretive narrative describing &quot;the interplay of individual agency and social structure.&quot; Critical theory researchers address &quot;issues of power within the researcher-researched relationships and the links between knowledge and power.&quot;

Another form of data collection is that of the &quot;image&quot;. The image is the projection that an individual puts on an object or abstract idea. An image can be contained within the physical world through a particular individual&#x27;s perspective, primarily based on that individual&#x27;s past experiences. One example of an image is how an individual views a novel after completing it. The physical entity that is the novel contains a specific image in the perspective of the interpreting individual and can only be expressed by the individual in the terms of &quot;I can tell you what an image is by telling you what it feels like.&quot; The idea of an image relies on the imagination and has been seen to be utilized by children in a very spontaneous and natural manner. Effectively, the idea of the image is a primary tool for ethnographers to collect data. The image presents the perspective, experiences, and influences of an individual as a single entity and in consequence, the individual will always contain this image in the group under study.

== Differences across disciplines ==
The ethnographic method is used across a range of different disciplines, primarily by anthropologists/ethnologists but also occasionally by sociologists. Cultural studies, occupational therapy, economics, social work, education, design, psychology, computer science, human factors and ergonomics, ethnomusicology, folkloristics, religious studies, geography, history, linguistics, communication studies, performance studies, advertising, accounting research, nursing, urban planning, usability, political science, social movement, and criminology are other fields which have made use of ethnography.

===Cultural and social anthropology===
Cultural anthropology and social anthropology were developed around ethnographic research and their canonical texts, which are mostly ethnographies: e.g. &quot;Argonauts of the Western Pacific&quot; (1922) by Bronisław Malinowski, &quot;Ethnologische Excursion in Johore&quot; (1875) by Nicholas Miklouho-Maclay, &quot;Coming of Age in Samoa&quot; (1928) by Margaret Mead, &quot;The Nuer&quot; (1940) by E. E. Evans-Pritchard, &quot;Naven&quot; (1936, 1958) by Gregory Bateson, or &quot;The Lele of the Kasai&quot; (1963) by Mary Douglas. Cultural and social anthropologists today place a high value on doing ethnographic research. The typical ethnography is a document written about a particular people, almost always based at least in part on emic views of where the culture begins and ends. Using language or community boundaries to bound the ethnography is common. Ethnographies are also sometimes called &quot;case studies&quot;. Ethnographers study and interpret culture, its universalities, and its variations through the ethnographic study based on fieldwork. An ethnography is a specific kind of written observational science which provides an account of a particular culture, society, or community. The fieldwork usually involves spending a year or more in another society, living with the local people and learning about their ways of life. Ruth Fulton Benedict uses examples of Enthrotyhy in her serious of field work that began in 1922 of Serrano, of the Zuni in 1924, the Cochiti in 1925 and the Pina in 1926. All being people she wished to study for her anthropological data. Benedict&#x27;s experiences with the Southwest Zuni pueblo is to be considered the basis of her formative fieldwork. The experience set the idea for her to produce her theory of &quot;culture is personality writ large&quot; (modell, 1988). By studying the culture between the different Pueblo and Plain Indians, She discovered the culture isomorphism that would be considered her personalized unique approach to the study of anthropology using ethnographic techniques.

A typical ethnography attempts to be holistic and typically follows an outline to include a brief history of the culture in question, an analysis of the physical geography or terrain inhabited by the people under study, including climate, and often including what biological anthropologists call habitat. Folk notions of botany and zoology are presented as ethnobotany and ethno-zoology alongside references from the formal sciences. Material culture, technology, and means of subsistence are usually treated next, as they are typically bound up in physical geography and include descriptions of infrastructure. Kinship and social structure (including age grading, peer groups, gender, voluntary associations, clans, moieties, and so forth, if they exist) are typically included. Languages spoken, dialects, and the history of language change are another group of standard topics. Practices of child rearing, acculturation, and emic views on personality and values usually follow after sections on social structure. Rites, rituals, and other evidence of religion have long been an interest and are sometimes central to ethnographies, especially when conducted in public where visiting anthropologists can see them.

As ethnography developed, anthropologists grew more interested in less tangible aspects of culture, such as values, worldview and what Clifford Geertz termed the &quot;ethos&quot; of the culture. In his fieldwork, Geertz used elements of a phenomenological approach, tracing not just the doings of people, but the cultural elements themselves. For example, if within a group of people, winking was a communicative gesture, he sought to first determine what kinds of things a wink might mean (it might mean several things). Then, he sought to determine in what contexts winks were used, and whether, as one moved about a region, winks remained meaningful in the same way. In this way, cultural boundaries of communication could be explored, as opposed to using linguistic boundaries or notions about the residence. Geertz, while still following something of a traditional ethnographic outline, moved outside that outline to talk about &quot;webs&quot; instead of &quot;outlines&quot; of culture.

Within cultural anthropology, there are several subgenres of ethnography. Beginning in the 1950s and early 1960s, anthropologists began writing &quot;bio-confessional&quot; ethnographies that intentionally exposed the nature of ethnographic research. Famous examples include &quot;Tristes Tropiques&quot; (1955) by Lévi-Strauss, &quot;The High Valley&quot; by Kenneth Read, and &quot;The Savage and the Innocent&quot; by David Maybury-Lewis, as well as the mildly fictionalized &quot;Return to Laughter&quot; by Elenore Smith Bowen (Laura Bohannan).

Later &quot;reflexive&quot; ethnographies refined the technique to translate cultural differences by representing their effects on the ethnographer. Famous examples include &quot;Deep Play: Notes on a Balinese Cockfight&quot; by Clifford Geertz, &quot;Reflections on Fieldwork in Morocco&quot; by Paul Rabinow, &quot;The Headman and I&quot; by Jean-Paul Dumont, and &quot;Tuhami&quot; by Vincent Crapanzano. In the 1980s, the rhetoric of ethnography was subjected to intense scrutiny within the discipline, under the general influence of literary theory and post-colonial/post-structuralist thought. &quot;Experimental&quot; ethnographies that reveal the ferment of the discipline include &quot;Shamanism, Colonialism, and the Wild Man&quot; by Michael Taussig, &quot;Debating Muslims&quot; by Michael F. J. Fischer and Mehdi Abedi, &quot;A Space on the Side of the Road&quot; by Kathleen Stewart, and &quot;Advocacy after Bhopal&quot; by Kim Fortun.

This critical turn in sociocultural anthropology during the mid-1980s can be traced to the influence of the now classic (and often contested) text, &quot;Writing Culture: The Poetics and Politics of Ethnography&quot;, (1986) edited by James Clifford and George Marcus. &quot;Writing Culture&quot; helped bring changes to both anthropology and ethnography often described in terms of being &#x27;postmodern,&#x27; &#x27;reflexive,&#x27; &#x27;literary,&#x27; &#x27;deconstructive,&#x27; or &#x27;poststructural&#x27; in nature, in that the text helped to highlight the various epistemic and political predicaments that many practitioners saw as plaguing ethnographic representations and practices.

Where Geertz&#x27;s and Turner&#x27;s interpretive anthropology recognized subjects as creative actors who constructed their sociocultural worlds out of symbols, postmodernists attempted to draw attention to the privileged status of the ethnographers themselves. That is, the ethnographer cannot escape the personal viewpoint in creating an ethnographic account, thus making any claims of objective neutrality highly problematic, if not altogether impossible. In regards to this last point, &quot;Writing Culture&quot; became a focal point for looking at how ethnographers could describe different cultures and societies without denying the subjectivity of those individuals and groups being studied while simultaneously doing so without laying claim to absolute knowledge and objective authority. Along with the development of experimental forms such as &#x27;dialogic anthropology,&#x27; &#x27;narrative ethnography,&#x27; and &#x27;literary ethnography&#x27;, &quot;Writing Culture&quot; helped to encourage the development of &#x27;collaborative ethnography.&#x27; This exploration of the relationship between writer, audience, and subject has become a central tenet of contemporary anthropological and ethnographic practice. In certain instances, active collaboration between the researcher(s) and subject(s) has helped blend the practice of collaboration in ethnographic fieldwork with the process of creating the ethnographic product resulting from the research.

===Sociology===
Sociology is another field which prominently features ethnographies. Urban sociology, Atlanta University (now Clark-Atlanta University), and the Chicago School, in particular, are associated with ethnographic research, with some well-known early examples being &quot;The Philadelphia Negro&quot; (1899) by W. E. B. Du Bois, &quot;Street Corner Society&quot; by William Foote Whyte and &quot;Black Metropolis&quot; by St. Clair Drake and Horace R. Cayton, Jr. Well-known is Jaber F. Gubrium&#x27;s pioneering ethnography on the experiences of a nursing home, &quot;Living and Dying at Murray Manor&quot;. Major influences on this development were anthropologist Lloyd Warner, on the Chicago sociology faculty, and to Robert Park&#x27;s experience as a journalist. Symbolic interactionism developed from the same tradition and yielded such sociological ethnographies as &quot;Shared Fantasy&quot; by Gary Alan Fine, which documents the early history of fantasy role-playing games. Other important ethnographies in sociology include Pierre Bourdieu&#x27;s work in Algeria and France.

Jaber F. Gubrium&#x27;s series of organizational ethnographies focused on the everyday practices of illness, care, and recovery are notable. They include &quot;Living and Dying at Murray Manor,&quot; which describes the social worlds of a nursing home; &quot;Describing Care: Image and Practice in Rehabilitation,&quot; which documents the social organization of patient subjectivity in a physical rehabilitation hospital; &quot;Caretakers: Treating Emotionally Disturbed Children,&quot; which features the social construction of behavioral disorders in children; and &quot;Oldtimers and Alzheimer&#x27;s: The Descriptive Organization of Senility,&quot; which describes how the Alzheimer&#x27;s disease movement constructed a new subjectivity of senile dementia and how that is organized in a geriatric hospital. Another approach to ethnography in sociology comes in the form of institutional ethnography, developed by Dorothy E. Smith for studying the social relations which structure people&#x27;s everyday lives.

Other notable ethnographies include Paul Willis&#x27;s &quot;Learning to Labour,&quot; on working class youth; the work of Elijah Anderson, Mitchell Duneier, and Loïc Wacquant on black America, and Lai Olurode&#x27;s &quot;Glimpses of Madrasa From Africa&quot;. But even though many sub-fields and theoretical perspectives within sociology use ethnographic methods, ethnography is not the &quot;sine qua non&quot; of the discipline, as it is in cultural anthropology.

=== Communication studies ===
Beginning in the 1960s and 1970s, ethnographic research methods began to be widely used by communication scholars. As the purpose of ethnography is to describe and interpret the shared and learned patterns of values, behaviors, beliefs, and language of a culture-sharing group, Harris, (1968), also Agar (1980) note that ethnography is both a process and an outcome of the research. Studies such as Gerry Philipsen&#x27;s analysis of cultural communication strategies in a blue-collar, working-class neighborhood on the south side of Chicago, &quot;Speaking &#x27;Like a Man&#x27; in Teamsterville&quot;, paved the way for the expansion of ethnographic research in the study of communication.

Scholars of communication studies use ethnographic research methods to analyze communicative behaviors and phenomena. This is often characterized in the writing as attempts to understand taken-for-granted routines by which working definitions are socially produced. Ethnography as a method is a storied, careful, and systematic examination of the reality-generating mechanisms of everyday life (Coulon, 1995). Ethnographic work in communication studies seeks to explain &quot;how&quot; ordinary methods/practices/performances construct the ordinary actions used by ordinary people in the accomplishments of their identities. This often gives the perception of trying to answer the &quot;why&quot; and &quot;how come&quot; questions of human communication. Often this type of research results in a case study or field study such as an analysis of speech patterns at a protest rally, or the way firemen communicate during &quot;down time&quot; at a fire station. Like anthropology scholars, communication scholars often immerse themselves, and participate in and/or directly observe the particular social group being studied.

===Other fields===
The American anthropologist George Spindler was a pioneer in applying the ethnographic methodology to the classroom.

Anthropologists such as Daniel Miller and Mary Douglas have used ethnographic data to answer academic questions about consumers and consumption. In this sense, Tony Salvador, Genevieve Bell, and Ken Anderson describe design ethnography as being &quot;a way of understanding the particulars of daily life in such a way as to increase the success probability of a new product or service or, more appropriately, to reduce the probability of failure specifically due to a lack of understanding of the basic behaviors and frameworks of consumers.&quot; Sociologist Sam Ladner argues in her book, that understanding consumers and their desires requires a shift in &quot;standpoint&quot;, one that only ethnography provides. The results are products and services that respond to consumers&#x27; unmet needs.

Businesses, too, have found ethnographers helpful for understanding how people use products and services. By assessing user experience in a &quot;natural&quot; setting, ethnology yields insights into the practical applications of a product or service. It is one of the best ways to identify areas of friction and improve overall user experience. Companies make increasing use of ethnographic methods to understand consumers and consumption, or for new product development (such as video ethnography). The &quot;Ethnographic Praxis in Industry&quot; (EPIC) conference is evidence of this. Ethnographers&#x27; systematic and holistic approach to real-life experience is valued by product developers, who use the method to understand unstated desires or cultural practices that surround products. Where focus groups fail to inform marketers about what people really do, ethnography links what people say to what they do—avoiding the pitfalls that come from relying only on self-reported, focus-group data.

=== Evaluating ethnography ===
The ethnographic methodology is not usually evaluated in terms of philosophical standpoint (such as positivism and emotionalism). Ethnographic studies need to be evaluated in some manner. No consensus has been developed on evaluation standards, but Richardson (2000, p. 254) provides five criteria that ethnographers might find helpful. Jaber F. Gubrium and James A. Holstein&#x27;s (1997) monograph, &quot;The New Language of Qualitative Method,&quot; discusses forms of ethnography in terms of their &quot;methods talk&quot;.

# &quot;Substantive contribution&quot;: &quot;Does the piece contribute to our understanding of social life?&quot;
# &quot;Aesthetic merit&quot;: &quot;Does this piece succeed aesthetically?&quot;
# &quot;Reflexivity&quot;: &quot;How did the author come to write this text...Is there adequate self-awareness and self-exposure for the reader to make judgments about the point of view?&quot;
# &quot;Impact&quot;: &quot;Does this affect me? Emotionally? Intellectually?&quot; Does it move me?
# &quot;Expresses a reality&quot;: &quot;Does it seem &#x27;true&#x27;—a credible account of a cultural, social, individual, or communal sense of the &#x27;real&#x27;?&quot;

==Ethics==
Gary Alan Fine argues that the nature of ethnographic inquiry demands that researchers deviate from formal and idealistic rules or ethics that have come to be widely accepted in qualitative and quantitative approaches in research. Many of these ethical assumptions are rooted in positivist and post-positivist epistemologies that have adapted over time but are apparent and must be accounted for in all research paradigms. These ethical dilemmas are evident throughout the entire process of conducting ethnographies, including the design, implementation, and reporting of an ethnographic study. Essentially, Fine maintains that researchers are typically not as ethical as they claim or assume to be — and that &quot;each job includes ways of doing things that would be inappropriate for others to know&quot;. Also see Jaber F. Gubrium concept of &quot;site-specificity&quot; discussed his book co-edited with Amir Marvasti titled CRAFTING ETHNOGRAPHIC FIELDWORK. Routledge, 2023.

Fine is not necessarily casting blame at ethnographic researchers but tries to show that researchers often make idealized ethical claims and standards which are inherently based on partial truths and self-deceptions. Fine also acknowledges that many of these partial truths and self-deceptions are unavoidable. He maintains that &quot;illusions&quot; are essential to maintain an occupational reputation and avoid potentially more caustic consequences. He claims, &quot;Ethnographers cannot help but lie, but in lying, we reveal truths that escape those who are not so bold&quot;. Based on these assertions, Fine establishes three conceptual clusters in which ethnographic ethical dilemmas can be situated: &quot;Classic Virtues&quot;, &quot;Technical Skills&quot;, and &quot;Ethnographic Self&quot;.

Much debate surrounding the issue of ethics arose following revelations about how the ethnographer Napoleon Chagnon conducted his ethnographic fieldwork with the Yanomani people of South America.

While there is no international standard on Ethnographic Ethics, many western anthropologists look to the American Anthropological Association for guidance when conducting ethnographic work. In 2009, the Association adopted a code of ethics, stating: Anthropologists have &quot;moral obligations as members of other groups, such as the family, religion, and community, as well as the profession&quot;. The code of ethics notes that anthropologists are part of a wider scholarly and political network, as well as human and natural environment, which needs to be reported on respectfully. The code of ethics recognizes that sometimes very close and personal relationship can sometimes develop from doing ethnographic work. The Association acknowledges that the code is limited in scope; ethnographic work can sometimes be multidisciplinary, and anthropologists need to be familiar with ethics and perspectives of other disciplines as well. The eight-page code of ethics outlines ethical considerations for those conducting Research, Teaching, Application and Dissemination of Results, which are briefly outlined below.
* &quot;Conducting Research&quot; – When conducting research Anthropologists need to be aware of the potential impacts of the research on the people and animals they study. If the seeking of new knowledge will negatively impact the people and animals they will be studying they may not undertake the study according to the code of ethics.
* &quot;Teaching&quot; – When teaching the discipline of anthropology, instructors are required to inform students of the ethical dilemmas of conducting ethnographies and field work.
* &quot;Application&quot; – When conducting an ethnography, Anthropologists must be &quot;open with funders, colleagues, persons studied or providing information, and relevant parties affected by the work about the purpose(s), potential impacts, and source(s) of support for the work.&quot;
* &quot;Dissemination of Results&quot; – When disseminating results of an ethnography, &quot;[a]nthropologists have an ethical obligation to consider the potential impact of both their research and the communication or dissemination of the results of their research on all directly or indirectly involved.&quot; Research results of ethnographies should not be withheld from participants in the research if that research is being observed by other people.

===Classic virtues===
* &quot;The kindly ethnographer&quot; – Most ethnographers present themselves as being more sympathetic than they are, which aids in the research process, but is also deceptive. The identity that we present to subjects is different from whom we are in other circumstances.
* &quot;The friendly ethnographer&quot; – Ethnographers operate under the assumption that they should not dislike anyone. When ethnographers find they intensely dislike individuals encountered in the research, they may crop them out of the findings.
* &quot;The honest ethnographer&quot; – If research participants know the research goals, their responses will likely be skewed. Therefore, ethnographers often conceal what they know in order to increase the likelihood of acceptance by participants.

===Technical skills===
* &quot;The Precise Ethnographer&quot; – Ethnographers often create the illusion that field notes are data and reflect what &quot;really&quot; happened. They engage in the opposite of plagiarism, giving undeserved credit through loose interpretations and paraphrasing. Researchers take near-fictions and turn them into claims of fact. The closest ethnographers can ever really get to reality is an approximate truth.
* &quot;The Observant Ethnographer&quot; – Readers of ethnography are often led to assume the report of a scene is complete – that little of importance was missed. In reality, an ethnographer will always miss some aspect because of lacking omniscience. Everything is open to multiple interpretations and misunderstandings. As ethnographers&#x27; skills in observation and collection of data vary by individual, what is depicted in ethnography can never be the whole picture.
* &quot;The Unobtrusive Ethnographer&quot; – As a &quot;participant&quot; in the scene, the researcher will always have an effect on the communication that occurs within the research site. The degree to which one is an &quot;active member&quot; affects the extent to which sympathetic understanding is possible.

===Ethnographic self===
The following are commonly misconceived conceptions of ethnographers:
* &quot;The Candid Ethnographer&quot; – Where the researcher personally situates within the ethnography is ethically problematic. There is an illusion that everything reported was observed by the researcher.
* &quot;The Chaste Ethnographer&quot; – When ethnographers participate within the field, they invariably develop relationships with research subjects/participants. These relationships are sometimes not accounted for within the reporting of the ethnography, although they may influence the research findings.
* &quot;The Fair Ethnographer&quot; – Fine claims that objectivity is an illusion and that everything in ethnography is known from a perspective. Therefore, it is unethical for a researcher to report fairness in findings.
* &quot;The Literary Ethnographer&quot; – Representation is a balancing act of determining what to &quot;show&quot; through poetic/prosaic language and style, versus what to &quot;tell&quot; via straightforward, &#x27;factual&#x27; reporting. The individual skills of an ethnographer influence what appears to be the value of the research.

According to Norman K. Denzin, ethnographers should consider the following seven principles when observing, recording, and sampling data:
# The groups should combine symbolic meanings with patterns of interaction.
# Observe the world from the point of view of the subject, while maintaining the distinction between everyday and scientific perceptions of reality.
# Link the group&#x27;s symbols and their meanings with the social relationships.
# Record all behavior.
# The methodology should highlight phases of process, change, and stability.
# The act should be a type of symbolic interactionism.
# Use concepts that would avoid casual explanations.

==Forms==

===Autoethnography===

Autoethnography is a form of ethnographic research in which a researcher connects personal experiences to wider cultural, political, and social meanings and understandings. According to Adams et al., autoethnography

# uses a researcher&#x27;s personal experience to describe and critique cultural beliefs, practices, and experiences;
# acknowledges and values a researcher&#x27;s relationships with others
# uses deep and careful self-reflection—typically referred to as &quot;reflexivity&quot;—to name and interrogate the intersections between self and society, the particular and the general, the personal and the political
# shows people in the process of figuring out what to do, how to live, and the meaning of their struggles
# balances intellectual and methodological rigor, emotion, and creativity
# strives for social justice and to make life better.

Bochner and Ellis have also defined autoethnography as &quot;an autobiographical genre of writing and research that displays multiple layers of consciousness, connecting the personal to the cultural.&quot; They further indicate that autoethnography is typically written in first-person and can &quot;appear in a variety of forms,&quot; such as &quot;short stories, poetry, fiction, novels, photographic essays, personal essays, journals, fragmented and layered writing, and social science prose.&quot;

===Genealogical method===
The genealogical method investigates links of kinship determined by marriage and descent. The method owes its origin from the book of British ethnographer W. H. R. Rivers titled &quot;Kinship and Social Organisation&quot; in 1911. Genealogy or kinship commonly plays a crucial role in the structure of non-industrial societies, determining both social relations and group relationship to the past. Marriage, for example, is frequently pivotal in determining military alliances between villages, clans or ethnic groups.

In the field of epistemology the term is used to characterize the philosophical method employed by such writers as Friedrich Nietzsche and Michel Foucault.

===Digital ethnography===

Digital ethnography is also seen as virtual ethnography. This type of ethnography is not so typical as ethnography recorded by pen and pencil. Digital ethnography allows for a lot more opportunities to look at different cultures and societies. Traditional ethnography may use videos or images, but digital ethnography goes more in-depth. For example, digital ethnographers would use social media platforms such as Twitter or blogs so that people&#x27;s interactions and behaviors can be studied. Modern developments in computing power and AI have enabled higher efficiencies in ethnographic data collection via multimedia and computational analysis using machine learning to corroborate many data sources together to produce a refined output for various purposes. A modern example of this technology in application, is the use of captured audio in smart devices, transcribed to issue targeted adverts (often reconciled vs other metadata, or product development data for designers.

Digital ethnography comes with its own set of ethical questions, and the Association of Internet Researchers&#x27; ethical guidelines are frequently used. Gabriele de Seta&#x27;s paper &quot;Three Lies of Digital Ethnography&quot; explores some of the methodological questions more central to a specific ethnographic approach to internet studies, drawing upon Fine&#x27;s classic text.

===Multispecies ethnography===

Multispecies ethnography in particular focuses on both nonhuman and human participants within a group or culture, as opposed to just human participants in traditional ethnography. A multispecies ethnography, in comparison to other forms of ethnography, studies species that are connected to people and our social lives. Species affect and are affected by culture, economics, and politics.

The study&#x27;s roots go back to general anthropology of animals. One of the earliest well-known studies was Lewis Henry Morgan&#x27;s The American Beaver and His Works (1868). His study closely observed a group of beavers in Northern Michigan. Morgan&#x27;s main objective was to highlight that the daily individual tasks that the beavers performed were complex communicative acts that had been passed down for generations.

In the early 2000s multi-species ethnography took on a huge increase in popularity. The annual meetings of the American Anthropological Association began to host the Multispecies Salon, a collection of discussions, showcases, and other events for anthropologists. The event provided a space for anthropologists and artists to come together and showcase vast knowledge of different organisms and their intertwined systems.

Multispecies ethnography highlights a lot of the negative effects of these shared environments and systems. Not only does multispecies ethnography observe the physical relationships between organisms, it also takes note of the emotional and psychological relationships built between species.

===Relational ethnography===

Most ethnographies take place in specific places where the observer can observe specific instances that relate to the topic involved. Relational Ethnography articulates studying fields rather than places or processes rather than processed people. Meaning that relational ethnography doesn&#x27;t take an object nor a bounded group that is defined by its members shared social features nor a specific location that is delimited by the boundaries of a particular area. But rather the processes involving configurations of relations among different agents or institutions. For instance, such places could be created through an interconnection between the place at hand and the people that live within it and continuously re-create meaning by sharing and changing historic narratives of this place.

<text>The Overwhelmingly Large Telescope (OWL) was a conceptual design by the European Southern Observatory (ESO) organisation for an extremely large telescope, which was intended to have a single aperture of 100 metres in diameter. Because of the complexity and cost of building a telescope of this unprecedented size, ESO has decided to focus on the 39-metre diameter Extremely Large Telescope instead.

==History==
OWL was first proposed in 1998, and at that time was estimated to be technologically feasible by 2010–2015.

While the original 100 m design would not exceed the angular resolving power of interferometric telescopes, it would have exceptional light-gathering and imaging capacity. The OWL could be expected to regularly see astronomical objects with an apparent magnitude of 38, or 1,500 times fainter than the faintest object that has been detected by the Hubble Space Telescope.

All proposed designs for the OWL are variations on a segmented mirror, since there is no technology available to build and transport a monolithic 60- or 100-meter mirror. The operation of a segmented mirror is somewhat more complicated than that of a monolithic one, requiring careful alignment of the segments (a technique called cophasing). Experience gained in existing segmented mirrors (for example, the Keck telescope) suggests that the mirror proposed for the OWL is feasible. However, the projected cost (of around €1.5 billion) was considered too high, so the ESO is now building the smaller Extremely Large Telescope around 39 m in diameter. Also, there appears to be some inconsistency as to the actual construction costs of the OWL, with some estimating its cost an order of magnitude higher (ELT currently at €1.3 billion, equivalent to around $1.3 billion, scaled using D^2.77 proportionality assuming a 100 meter diameter yields $21 billion).

It has been estimated that a telescope with a diameter of 80 meters would be able to spectroscopically analyse Earth-size planets around the forty nearest sun-like stars. As such, this telescope could help in the exploration of exoplanets and extraterrestrial life (because the spectrum from the planets could reveal the presence of molecules indicative of life).

<text>Speleology () is the scientific study of caves and other karst features, as well as their composition, structure, physical properties, history, ecology, and the processes by which they form (speleogenesis) and change over time (speleomorphology). The term &quot;speleology&quot; is also sometimes applied to the recreational activity of exploring caves, but this is more properly known as &quot;caving&quot;, &quot;potholing&quot; (British English), or &quot;spelunking&quot; (United States and Canadian English). Speleology and caving are often connected, as the physical skills required for &quot;in situ&quot; study are the same.

Speleology is a cross-disciplinary field that combines the knowledge of chemistry, biology, geology, physics, meteorology, and cartography to develop portraits of caves as complex, evolving systems.

== History ==
Before modern speleology developed, John Beaumont wrote detailed descriptions of some Mendip caves in the 1680s. The term speleology was coined by Émile Rivière in 1890.

Prior to the mid-nineteenth century the scientific value of caves was considered only in its contribution to other branches of science, and cave studies were considered part of the larger disciplines of geography, geology or archaeology. Very little cave-specific study was undertaken prior to the work of Édouard-Alfred Martel (1859–1938), the &#x27;father of modern speleology&#x27;, who through his extensive and well-publicised cave explorations introduced in France the concept of speleology as a distinct area of study. In 1895 Martel founded the Société de Spéléologie, the first organization devoted to cave science in the world. Other early speleologists include Herbert E. Balch.

An international speleological congress was proposed at a meeting in Valence-sur-Rhone, France in 1949 and first held in 1953 in Paris. The International Union of Speleology (UIS) was founded in 1965.

The growth of speleology is directly linked with that of the sport of caving, both because of the stimulation of public interest and awareness, and the fact that most speleological field-work has been conducted by sport cavers.

== Cave geology, hydrogeology and biology ==
Karst is a landscape that has limestone underneath which has been eroded. Caves are usually formed through chemical corrosion via a process of dissolution. Corrosion has several ways of doing this, it can be on carbonate rocks through chemical reactions, in gypsum and rock salt it can happen physically, and in silicate rocks and warm climate the decomposition of the materials can happen as well.

=== Geochemistry===

====Speleothems ====

A speleothem is a geological formation by mineral deposits that accumulate over time in natural caves. Speleothems most commonly form in calcareous caves due to carbonate dissolution reactions. They can take a variety of forms, depending on their depositional history and environment. Their chemical composition, gradual growth, and preservation in caves make them useful paleoclimatic proxies.

=== Biochemistry ===
Caves have an absence of stable temperature, high relative humidity, low rates of evaporation and limited supply of organic material, which help in creating an environment which is highly favorable for the growth of microbes. Microbial assemblages in caves include archaea, bacteria, fungi and other micro-eukaryotes, these highly adapted microbial communities represent the living-backbone of cave ecosystems and play a key role in shaping structures and sustaining trophic networks.

== Cave cartography ==

The creation of an accurate, detailed map is one of the most common technical activities undertaken within a cave. Cave maps, called &quot;surveys&quot;, can be used to compare caves to each other by length, depth and volume, may reveal clues on speleogenesis, provide a spatial reference for further scientific study, and assist visitors with route-finding.

== Cave biology ==

Caves provide a home for many unique biota. Cave ecologies are very diverse, and not sharply distinct from surface habitats. Generally however, the deeper the cave becomes, the more rarefied the ecology.

Cave environments fall into three general categories:
* Endogean
:the parts of caves that are in communication with surface soils through cracks and rock seams, groundwater seepage, and root protrusion.
* Parahypogean
:the threshold regions near cave mouths that extend to the last penetration of sunlight.
* Hypogean
:or &quot;true&quot; cave environments. These can be in regular contact with the surface via wind and underground rivers, or the migration of animals, or can be almost entirely isolated. Deep hypogean environments can host autonomous ecologies whose primary source of energy is not sunlight, but chemical energy liberated from limestone and other minerals by chemoautotrophic bacteria.

Cave organisms fall into three basic classes:

There are also so-called &quot;accidental trogloxenes&quot; which are surface organisms that enter caves for no survival reason. Some may even be &quot;troglophobes&quot; (“cave haters”), which cannot survive in caves for any extended period. Examples include deer which fell through a sinkhole, frogs swept into a cave by a flash flood, etc.

The two factors that limit cave ecologies are generally energy and nutrients. To some degree moisture is always available in actively forming Karst caves. Cut off from the sunlight and steady deposition of plant detritus, caves are poor habitats in comparison with wet areas on the surface. Most of the energy in cave environments comes from the surplus of the ecosystems outside. One major source of energy and nutrients in caves is dung from trogloxenes, most of which is deposited by bats. Other sources are mentioned above.

Cave ecosystems are very fragile. Because of their rarity and position in the ecosystem they are threatened by a large number of human activities. Dam construction, limestone quarrying, water pollution and logging are just some of the disasters that can devastate or destroy underground biological communities.

== Other areas of cave science ==
Speleologists also work with archaeologists in studying underground ruins, tunnels, sewers and aqueducts, such as the various inlets and outlets of the Cloaca Maxima in Rome.

<doc id="152639" wikidata="Q333050" url="?curid=152639" title="Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh">
<text>Robert Stewart, 2nd Marquess of Londonderry (18 June 1769 – 12 August 1822), usually known as Lord Castlereagh, derived from the courtesy title Viscount Castlereagh ( ) by which he was styled from 1796 to 1821, was an Irish-born British statesman and politician. As secretary to the Viceroy in Ireland, he worked to suppress the Rebellion of 1798 and to secure passage in 1800 of the Irish Act of Union. As the Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom from 1812, he was central to the management of the coalition that defeated Napoleon, and was British plenipotentiary at the Congress of Vienna. In the post-war government of Lord Liverpool, Castlereagh was seen to support harsh measures against agitation for reform, and he ended his life an isolated and unpopular figure.

Early in his career in Ireland, and following a visit to revolutionary France, Castlereagh recoiled from the democratic politics of his Presbyterian constituents in Ulster. Crossing the floor of the Irish Commons in support of the government, he took a leading role in detaining members of the republican conspiracy, the United Irishmen, his former political associates among them. After the 1798 Rebellion, as Chief Secretary for Ireland he pushed the Act of Union through the Irish Parliament. But it was without the Catholic Emancipation that both he and British Prime Minister William Pitt believed should have accompanied the creation of a United Kingdom.

From 1805 Castlereagh served under Pitt and then the Duke of Portland as Secretary of State for War. In 1809 he was obliged to resign after fighting a duel with the Foreign Secretary, George Canning. In 1812 Castlereagh returned to government serving Lord Liverpool as Foreign Secretary and as Leader of the House of Commons.

Castlereagh organised and financed the alliance that defeated Napoleon, bringing the powers together at the Treaty of Chaumont in 1814. After Napoleon&#x27;s second abdication in 1815, Castlereagh worked with the European courts represented at the Congress of Vienna to frame the territorial, and broadly conservative, continental order that was to hold until mid-century. He blocked harsh terms against France believing that a treaty based on vengeance and retaliation would upset a necessary balance of powers. France restored the Bourbons kings and her frontiers were restored to 1791 lines. Her British-occupied colonies were returned. In 1820 Castlereagh enunciated a policy of non-intervention, proposing that Britain hold herself aloof from continental affairs.

After 1815, at home, Castlereagh supported repressive measures that linked him in public opinion to the Peterloo Massacre of 1819. Widely reviled in both Ireland and Great Britain, overworked and personally distressed, Castlereagh died by suicide in 1822.

== Early life and career in Ireland ==
Robert was born on 18 June 1769 in 28 Henry Street, in Dublin&#x27;s Northside. He was the second and only surviving child of Robert Stewart (the elder) and his wife Sarah Frances Seymour-Conway. His parents married in 1766.

=== The Stewarts ===
The Stewarts had been a Scottish family settled in Donegal whose fortunes had been transformed by the marriage of Castlereagh&#x27;s grandfather Alexander Stewart to an East India Company heiress. The legacy from Robert Cowan, the former Governor of Bombay, allowed for the purchase of extensive properties in north Down including the future family demesne, Mount Stewart, on the shores of Strangford Lough. 

As a Presbyterian (a &quot;Dissenter&quot;), rather than a member of the established Anglican Communion (the Church of Ireland), Castlereagh&#x27;s father, Robert Stewart, had an easy reputation as a friend of reform. In 1771, and again in 1776, he was elected from County Down to the Irish House of Commons. In 1778 he joined the Irish Volunteer movement, raising an armed and drilled company from his estates. In parliament and among the Volunteers, he was a friend and supporter of Lord Charlemont and his policy. This favoured Volunteer agitation for the independence of Ireland&#x27;s Ascendancy parliament, but not for its reform and not for Catholic emancipation.

The elder Robert Stewart was created Baron Londonderry in 1789, Viscount Castlereagh in 1795, and Earl of Londonderry in 1796 by King George III, enabling him from the Act of Union of 1800 onwards to sit at Westminster in the House of Lords as an Irish representative peer. In 1816 he was elevated to Marquess of Londonderry.

Young Robert&#x27;s mother died in childbirth when he was a year old. Lady Sarah Frances Seymour-Conway had been the daughter of Francis Seymour-Conway, 1st Marquess of Hertford and Isabella Fitzroy. Lord Hertford was a former British Ambassador to France (1764–65) and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland (1765–66). Isabella Fitzroy was a daughter of Charles FitzRoy, 2nd Duke of Grafton.

Five years later his father married Lady Frances Pratt, the independent-minded daughter of Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden (1714–94), a leading English jurist and prominent political supporter of both William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham, and his son, William Pitt the Younger. The marriages of the elder Robert Stewart linked his family with the upper ranks of English nobility and political elites. The Camden connection was to be especially important for the political careers of the older and the younger Robert Stewart. By Frances Pratt, his father&#x27;s second wife, young Robert had eleven half-siblings, including his half-brother Charles William Stewart (later Vane), Baron Stewart of Stewart&#x27;s Court and Ballylawn in County Donegal (1814) and 3rd Marquess of Londonderry (1822).








=== Education ===
The younger Robert Stewart had recurring health problems throughout his childhood, and was sent to The Royal School, Armagh, rather than to England for his secondary education. At the encouragement of Charles Pratt, first Earl of Camden, who took a great interest in him and treated him as if he had been a grandson by blood, he later attended St. John&#x27;s College, Cambridge (1786–87), where he applied himself with greater diligence than expected from an aristocrat and excelled in his first-year examinations. But he then withdrew, pleading an illness that he admitted to Camden was something &quot;which cannot be directly acknowledged before women&quot;, i.e. something sexually transmitted.

=== Irish MP ===
In the summer of 1790, Stewart was elected as a Member of the Irish Parliament for his family&#x27;s County Down constituency. In a county with an exceptionally large number of enfranchised freeholders, his campaign pitted him in a popular contest against the nominees of the county&#x27;s established Ascendancy families, and on that basis alone he won the sympathy and support of Belfast&#x27;s Northern Whig Club. It had been his conscious strategy to capitalise on strong Volunteer and reform sentiments.

In a letter to the &quot;Belfast Newsletter&quot; he declared for parliamentary reform (reform that would have abolished the pocket boroughs that allowed Ascendancy families, in addition to their presence in the House of Lords, to control seats in the Commons). In doing so, he won the support of many who, later despairing of parliamentary &quot;patriots&quot;, were to enter the ranks of the United Irishmen.

In the House of Commons, Stewart spurned an offer of a place in government and sat as an independent. But otherwise, he made little impression and was judged a poor speaker.

=== Reflections on the Revolution in France ===
In July 1791, having both read &quot;Reflections on the Revolution in France&quot; by Edmund Burke (a family friend) and learnt that in Belfast Irish Volunteers were preparing to celebrate Bastille Day, Stewart decided to judge events in France for himself.In Spa in the Austrian Netherlands he had difficulty in empathising with the wholly reactionary outlook of the French emigres. But after passing into France in November, he conceded that while he did not &quot;like&quot; the government of Ireland, &quot;I prefer it to a revolution.&quot;.

Stewart was not convinced of Burke&#x27;s contention that the revolution would produce a French Cromwell, although he recognised that outside Paris the principles of liberty were not as entrenched. As the revolutionary factions, the Jacobins and Girondins, struggled for supremacy in the capital, it was &quot;the nation at large&quot; that would &quot;ultimately decide between them.&quot;

In &quot;an early example of [his] scepticism about foreign intervention&quot;, Stewart argued it was beyond her neighbours to give government to France. The Austrian Emperor might march his troops to Paris, but unless he was prepared to keep them there, the Ancien Régime restored would again collapse.

Stewart returned to the Austrian Netherlands in the autumn of 1792, but was unable to cross the now military frontlines into France. However, news of the Jacobin triumph in Paris, and, following her victory at Valmy, the prospect of France carrying defence of the revolution beyond her frontiers convinced him that &quot;it would not be long before he had to face his own &#x27;Jacobins&#x27; in Ireland.&quot;

=== Catholic relief, loyalty to Pitt ===
When in 1793 he returned to the parliament in Dublin, Stewart spoke in favour of the Catholic Relief Bill. In doing so he was supporting the policy of British Prime Minister William Pitt who determined that Catholic opinion be conciliated in preparation for the impending war with the new, anti-clericalist, French Republic. While calling for the removal of their remaining civil disabilities, Stewart stopped short of endorsing extension to Catholics of the right to vote on the same forty-shilling freehold terms as Protestants that was provided in the bill. He noted that to now deprive the Ascendancy of their pocket boroughs would result in Catholics forming an overwhelming majority of those represented in the Irish Parliament. &quot;Can a Protestant superstructure,&quot; he asked, &quot;long continue supported on such base?&quot;

However, his loyalty to Pitt now seemed unconditional. In April 1793, Stewart was gazetted a Lieutenant-Colonel in the government&#x27;s new Militia, its replacement for the now proscribed Volunteers. He commanded the Londonderry Militia, being promoted to Colonel of the regiment in 1800.

In 1794, partly as a result of the promotion of his interests by his Camden connections, Stewart was offered the Government-controlled seat of Tregony in Cornwall. In 1796, he transferred to a seat for the Suffolk constituency of Orford, which was in the interest of his mother&#x27;s family, the Seymour-Conways (Marquess of Hertford). He held these seats simultaneously with his county seat in Ireland.

=== Marriage ===
In 1794, Stewart married Amelia (Emily) Hobart, a daughter of John Hobart, 2nd Earl of Buckinghamshire, a former British Ambassador to Russia (1762–65) and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland (1776–80). Her mother, Caroline Conolly, was the granddaughter of William Conolly, Speaker of the Irish House of Commons in the early 18th century and one of the wealthiest landowners in Ireland. Caroline&#x27;s brother, Thomas Conolly, was married to Louisa Lennox, sister of Emily FitzGerald, Duchess of Leinster, whose son and Emily&#x27;s cousin-by-marriage, Lord Edward FitzGerald was a leader of the United Irishmen and one of their martyrs in the early stages of the Irish Rebellion of 1798.

Emily Stewart was well known as a hostess for her husband in both Ireland and London and during some of his most important diplomatic missions. In later years she was a leader of Regency London high society as one of the Lady Patronesses of Almack&#x27;s. She is noted in contemporary accounts for her attractiveness, volubility and eccentricities. By all accounts, the two remained devoted to each other to the end, but they had no children. The couple did, however, care for the young Frederick Stewart, while his father, Stewart&#x27;s half-brother, Charles, was serving in the army.

== Chief Secretary for Ireland ==
=== Suppression of the United Irishmen ===

In 1795, Pitt replaced William Fitzwilliam, 4th Earl Fitzwilliam as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland with Stewart&#x27;s uncle, John Pratt the 2nd Earl Camden. Fitzwilliam had urged that the emancipation of Catholics be completed with their admission to parliament. Camden&#x27;s arrival in Dublin was greeted with riots, and that year Stewart crossed the floor of the Irish House of Commons to join the supporters of the government, the Dublin Castle executive. Stewart became an essential adviser to the inexperienced and unpopular Lord Lieutenant, who was Stewart&#x27;s senior by only ten years.

In August 1796 Stewart&#x27;s father was elevated to the title Earl of Londonderry. As his son, Stewart was henceforth styled Viscount Castlereagh.

In September, acting upon evidence of communication with the French, Castlereagh personally led troops in a series of raids in Belfast and its environs (the &quot;Siege of Belfast&quot;) that netted leading members of the United Irishmen. Among them were men who had supported him in the election of 1790. Originating in Belfast among Presbyterian celebrants of the American and French revolutions, the republican conspiracy had spread rapidly in Ulster and, in league with the Catholic Defenders, across the Irish midlands. In County Down, Castlereagh&#x27;s father had difficulty in raising a loyalist yeomanry among his tenants and eventually, with all rent withheld, Mount Stewart was placed under armed guard.

In December 1796, a large French expedition to Ireland failed to effect a landing at Bantry Bay, but due only to contrary winds. As an officer in the militia, Castlereagh was well apprised of the lack of preparedness to meet a combination of professional French soldiery and the countrywide insurgency it would likely trigger.

In February 1797, Castlereagh was at last appointed to the Dublin Castle administration as Keeper of the King&#x27;s Signet for Ireland. Following a declaration of martial law he was made both a Lord of the Treasury and a Member of the Privy Council of Ireland (1797–1800). At the urging of Camden, Castlereagh assumed many of the onerous duties of the often-absent Chief Secretary for Ireland, who was responsible for day-to-day administration and for asserting the influence of Dublin Castle in the House of Commons. In this capacity, and after March 1798 as Acting Chief Secretary, Castlereagh played a key role in crushing the United Irish rising when it came in May and June 1798.

In November 1798, Castlereagh was formally appointed to the office of Chief Secretary by Camden&#x27;s successor, Lord Cornwallis.

=== Executions of William Orr and James Porter ===
Castlereagh&#x27;s general policy was to offer immediate clemency to the rebel rank-and-file, many of whom were then inducted into the yeomanry, while still focusing on the politically committed leadership. But already before the rebellion, he had begun to earn the sobriquet &quot;Bloody Castlereagh&quot;.

In October 1797 his stepmother, Lady Frances, had petitioned Camden for the life of William Orr. On a charge of administering the United Irish test to two soldiers, Orr had been named on the same warrant that Castlereagh had used in the roundup of the previous September. The judge reportedly broke down in tears as he read the death sentence which the popular journalist Peter Finnerty credited to Castlereagh&#x27;s insistence on making an example in the face of the growing French fever. In 1811, Castlereagh successfully had Finnerty convicted for libel.

After the rebellion, during which Mount Stewart was briefly occupied, Castlereagh was content that leading United Irishmen in the Presbyterian north be allowed American exile. An exception was made in the case of James Porter, executed, again despite the entreaties of Lady Frances, following a court martial before Castlereagh&#x27;s father, Lord Londonderry. Porter, who had been his family&#x27;s Presbyterian minister and, in 1790, his election agent, had become a household name in Ulster as the author of a satire of the county gentry, &quot;Billy Bluff&quot;, in which Londonderry was serially lampooned as an inarticulate tyrant.

=== The Act of Union and the promise of Emancipation ===
In 1799, in furtherance of both his own political vision and Pitt&#x27;s policies, Castlereagh began lobbying in the Irish and British Parliaments for a union that would incorporate Ireland with Great Britain in a United Kingdom. In addition to security against the French, Castlereagh saw the principal merit of bringing Ireland directly under the Crown in the Westminster Parliament as a resolution of what ultimately was the key issue for the governance of the country, the Catholic question. &quot;Linked with England&quot;, he reasoned that &quot;the Protestants, feeling less exposed, would be more confident and liberal&quot;, while Catholics, reduced to a minority within the larger kingdom, would lower their expectations and moderate their demands.

During the campaign for the Act of Union, both Castlereagh and Cornwallis had, in good faith, forwarded informal assurances they had received from Pitt&#x27;s Cabinet to the Irish Catholics that they would be allowed to sit in the new United Kingdom Parliament. However, opposition in England, and not least from the King, George III, obliged Castlereagh to defy what he saw as &quot;the very logic of the Union.&quot;The Union bill that, with a generous distribution of titles and favours, he helped put through the Irish Parliament omitted the provision for Catholic emancipation. A separate Irish executive in Dublin was retained, but representation, still wholly Protestant, was transferred to Westminster constituted as the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.

Pitt had tried to follow through on his commitment, but when it came to light that the King had approached Henry Addington, an opponent of Catholic emancipation, about becoming Prime Minister to replace him, both Castlereagh and Pitt resigned. Castlereagh would long be held personally responsible by many Catholics in Ireland for the breach of promise and the British Government&#x27;s failure to remove their remaining political disabilities.

== President of the Board of Control ==
=== Wellesley and India ===
In the new Parliament of the United Kingdom the tensions within the ruling Tories over Catholic emancipation abated, and after obtaining his desired cessation of hostilities with France (the Peace of Amiens), in July 1802 Henry Addington brought Castlereagh into the Cabinet as President of the Board of Control. His chief task was to mediate the bitter disputes between the Governor-General of India, Richard Wellesley (the brother of Arthur Wellesley) and the Directors of the East India Company, smoothing quarrels while generally supporting Lord Wellesley&#x27;s policies. In 1805, with the renewed struggle against Napoleon in Europe the overriding priority, he presided over Wellesley&#x27;s recall and replacement by Lord Cornwallis, and over the subsequent abandonment of most of Wellesley&#x27;s recent acquisitions in central India.

=== Irish interventions ===
While his British interests and responsibilities took up more and more of his time, and his visits home became increasingly brief and rare, Castlereagh still hoped to do something for Ireland from the government benches. On entering the cabinet he wrote to Addington deploring the role of the Orange Order in fostering sectarian violence and to commend putting &quot;the law rigidly in force against all parties&quot; so that in future wars, &quot;our foreign enemies&quot; would not again find an aggrieved domestic ally. More than this, he won cabinet approval for schemes to ensure that the Established Church was not alone in preaching loyalty to the Crown.

To counter &quot;the democratic party in the [Presbyterian] synod, most of whom, if not engaged in the Rebellion, were deeply infected with its principles&quot;, he proposed transforming the existing &quot;Regium Donum,&quot; which the Presbyterian body had apportioned equally among its clergy, into a discretionary grant for which each minister had to apply individually with proofs and professions of loyalty. His efforts to extend a similar scheme to the Catholic clergy met with stiffer resistance: priests would not accept support from the Crown while it continued to deny their communicants political equality.

=== Loss of home constituency ===
In Ireland, the Anglo-Irish Ascendancy was slow to forgive Castlereagh for the loss of their parliament. The Dowager Marchioness of Downshire broke her family&#x27;s electoral truce with the Stewarts in County Down and in July 1805 forced Castlereagh to defend his (now Westminster) parliamentary seat. In the contest he also faced the hostility of unrepentant United Irishmen—men like William Drennan who were to engage in what Castlereagh denounced as &quot;a deep laid scheme again to bring the Presbyterian Synod within the ranks of democracy&quot;. (In 1810, with Castlereagh out of office, Drennan and his friends secured a government grant for the education of Presbyterian ministers in their new, distinctly liberal, Belfast Academical Institution).

Despite the prestige of a new cabinet position in London, Castlereagh was defeated in a campaign marked by repeated aspersions on his failure to father a child, and by the taunts of those who, otherwise no friends of the Downshires, reminded him of the principles on which he had stood in 1790. News of his discomfiture was met with public celebration in Dublin and Belfast.

On his return to London, the Treasury found him an alternative English seat, Boroughbridge, a government-controlled rotten borough. Having conciliated the Downshires and able to ride the victories of Arthur Wellesley (future Duke of Wellington), the reputed Dubliner he had appointed to command in the Peninsular War, in 1812 Castlereagh avenged his humiliation, and recovered the family seat.

== Secretary for War ==
=== Hanover, Copenhagen and Walcheren ===
After the renewal of the war against Napoleon, at the urging of Castlereagh and other long-time supporters in 1804 Pitt returned as Prime Minister. Castlereagh entered the new cabinet as Secretary of State for War and the Colonies.

While pushing forward reforms of the military, he joined Pitt in endorsing an aggressive expeditionary policy. In October 1805, an army under General Sir George Don was landed at the mouth of the Elbe with a view to liberating Hanover. Following Napoleon&#x27;s triumph over the Russian and Austrian armies at Austerlitz in December, it had to be recalled at great cost.

As the only other member of Pitt&#x27;s cabinet in the House of Commons, Castlereagh became Pitt&#x27;s political deputy, taking on ever more burdens as Pitt&#x27;s health continued to decline. After Pitt&#x27;s death in 1806, Castlereagh resigned amid the chaos of the Ministry of All the Talents. When that Government collapsed, Castlereagh again became Secretary of State for War and the Colonies in 1807, this time in the ministry of the Duke of Portland.

In August 1807, he concurred with Foreign Secretary George Canning in authorising a British bombardment of the neutral Danish capital, Copenhagen. They sought to pre-emptively capture or destroy the Dano-Norwegian fleet fearing that it would fall into French hands. The incident precipitated both the Anglo-Russian War of 1807 and Denmark&#x27;s adherence to the Continental System and alliance with France.

In 1808 Castlereagh had been warned by Dumouriez that the best policy England could adopt with respect to colonies in Spanish America was to relinquish all ideas of military conquest by Arthur Wellesley and instead support the emancipation of the territories. Furthermore, Dumouriez suggested that once emancipation was achieved, a constitutional monarchy should be established with the exiled Duke of Orleans as King.

In 1809, with the Dowager Marchioness of Downshire now manoeuvring against him in London, the debacle of the Walcheren Expedition subjected Castlereagh to particularly hostile scrutiny.

=== Duel with Canning ===

Canning claimed to have opposed the Walcheren Expedition, to have dismissed the landing on the Dutch coast as an ill-advised, ill-prepared diversion of troops from the Peninsular War. Castlereagh had the support of General Wellesley, and evidence later surfaced that the Foreign Secretary himself had interfered with the plan, selecting the Earl of Chatham to command the expedition. The Portland government became increasingly paralysed by disputes between the two men. Portland was in deteriorating health and gave no lead, until Canning threatened resignation unless Castlereagh was removed. When Castlereagh discovered Canning&#x27;s terms had been accepted, he challenged the Foreign Secretary to a duel.

The duel was fought on 21 September 1809 on Putney Heath. Canning missed but Castlereagh wounded his opponent in the thigh. There was much outrage that two cabinet ministers had sought to settle their differences in such a manner, and they both felt compelled to resign. Six months later, Canning published a full account of his actions in the affair, but many who had initially rallied to him became convinced Castlereagh had been betrayed by his cabinet colleague.

== Foreign Secretary ==

Three years later, in 1812, Castlereagh returned to the government, this time as Foreign Secretary, a role in which he served for the next ten years. He also became leader of the House of Commons in the wake of Spencer Perceval&#x27;s assassination in 1812.

=== Treaty of Chaumont ===
In his role of Foreign Secretary, he was instrumental in negotiating what has become known as the quadruple alliance between Britain, Austria, Russia, and Prussia at Chaumont in March 1814, in the negotiation of the Treaty of Paris that brought peace with France, and at the Congress of Vienna. The Treaty of Chaumont was part of the final deal offered to Napoleon Bonaparte in 1814. Napoleon rejected it and it never took effect. However, the key terms reaffirmed decisions that had been made already. These decisions were again ratified and put into effect by the Congress of Vienna of 1814–1815. The terms were largely written by Lord Castlereagh, who offered cash subsidies to keep the other armies in the field against Napoleon. Key terms included the establishment of a confederated Germany, the division of Italy into independent states, the restoration of the Bourbon kings of Spain, and the enlargement of the Netherlands to include what in 1830 would become modern Belgium. The treaty of Chaumont became the cornerstone of the European Alliance which formed the balance of power for decades.

Historian G. M. Trevelyan argues:
:In 1813 and 1814 Castlereagh played the part that William III and Marlborough had played more than a hundred years before, in holding together an alliance of jealous, selfish, weak-kneed states and princes, by a vigour of character and singleness of purpose that held Metternich, the Czar, and the King of Prussia on the common track until the goal was reached. It is quite possible that, but for the lead taken by Castlereagh in the allied counsels, France would never have been reduced to her ancient limits, nor Napoleon dethroned.

=== Congress of Vienna ===
At the Congress of Vienna, Castlereagh designed and proposed a form of collective and collaborative security for Europe, then called a Congress system. In the Congress system, the main signatory powers met periodically (every two years or so) and collectively managed European affairs. This system was used in an attempt to address the Polish-Saxon crisis at Vienna and the question of Greek independence at Laibach. The following ten years saw five European Congresses where disputes were resolved with a diminishing degree of effectiveness. Finally, by 1822, the whole system had collapsed because of the irreconcilable differences of opinion between Britain, Austria, and Russia, and because of the lack of support for the Congress system in British public opinion.

In the years 1812 to 1822, Castlereagh continued to manage Britain&#x27;s foreign policy, generally pursuing a policy of continental engagement uncharacteristic of British foreign policy in the nineteenth century. Castlereagh was not an effective public speaker and his diplomatic presentation style was at times abstruse.

=== Abolition of the slave trade ===

Abolitionist opinion in Britain was strong enough in 1807 to abolish the slave trade in all British possessions—although slavery itself persisted in the colonies until 1833. Abolitionists after 1807 focused on international agreements to abolish the Atlantic slave trade. In 1806, Castlereagh had opposed Wilberforce&#x27;s abolition bills arguing that the slave trade could not be suppressed by Britain alone, but only by broad international agreement. This, as Foreign Minister, he pursued. He concluded treaties with Portugal, Sweden and Denmark, 1810–1814, whereby they agreed to restrict their trading. These were preliminary to the Congress of Vienna whose Final Act included a declaration condemning the slave trade. Wilberforce, himself, allowed that Castlereagh had secured all that &quot;could be done&quot;.

Castlereagh cooperated with senior officials to use the Royal Navy to detect and capture slave ships; the freed slaves were sent to freedom in a new British colony of Sierra Leone. He used diplomacy to conclude search-and-seize agreements with all the countries whose ships were trading. There was serious friction with the United States, where the southern slave interest was politically powerful. Washington recoiled at British policing of the high seas. Spain, France and Portugal also relied on the international slave trade to supply their colonial plantations. As more and more diplomatic arrangements were made by Castlereagh, the owners of slave ships started flying false flags of nations that had not agreed, especially the United States. It was illegal under American law for American ships to engage in the slave trade, but the idea of Britain enforcing American laws was unacceptable to Washington. Lord Palmerston continued the Castlereagh policies. Eventually, from 1842 to 1845, an arrangement was reached between London and Washington. With the arrival of a staunchly anti-slavery government in Washington in 1861, the Atlantic slave trade was doomed. In the long run, Castlereagh&#x27;s strategy on how to stifle the trade proved successful.

=== Nonintervention in European affairs ===
In May 1820 Castlereagh circulated to high officials a major state paper that set the main British policy for the rest of the century. Temperley and Penson call it, &quot;the most famous State Paper in British history and the one of the widest ultimate consequences.&quot; Castlereagh called for no British intervention in continental affairs. He argued that the purpose of the Quadruple Alliance was to contain France and put down revolutions. But the Spanish revolt did not threaten European peace nor any of the great powers. Castlereagh said that in actual practice the powers would seldom be able to agree on concerted action, and he pointed out that British public opinion would not support interventions. He admitted that individual states could indeed intervene in affairs in their recognized sphere of interest, such as Austria&#x27;s intervention in Italy.

== Lampooning by Thomas Moore ==
As a press, or squib, writer for the Whigs, Thomas Moore, better remembered as Ireland&#x27;s national bard, mercilessly lampooned Castlereagh. In what were the &quot;verbal equivalents of the political cartoons of the day&quot;, &quot;Tom Crib&#x27;s Memorial to Congress&quot; (1818) and &quot;Fables for the Holy Alliance&quot; (1823), Moore savages Castlereagh&#x27;s pirouetting with Britain&#x27;s reactionary continental allies.

Widely read, so that Moore eventually produced a sequel, was his verse novel &quot;The Fudge Family in Paris&quot; (1818). The family of an Irishman working as a propagandist for Castlereagh in Paris, the Fudges are accompanied by an accomplished tutor and classicist, Phelim Connor. An upright but disillusioned Irish Catholic, his letters to a friend reflect Moore&#x27;s own views. Connor&#x27;s regular epistolary denunciations of Castlereagh had two recurrent themes. First is Castlereagh as &quot;the embodiment of the sickness with which Ireland had infected British politics as a consequence of the union&quot;: &quot;We sent thee Castlereagh—as heaps of dead Have slain their slayers by the pest they spread&quot;. The second is that at the time of the Acts of Union Castlereagh&#x27;s support for Catholic emancipation had been disingenuous. Castlereagh had been master of &quot;that faithless craft&quot; which can &quot;cart the slave, can swear he shall be freed&quot;, but then &quot;basely spurns him&quot; when his &quot;point is gain&#x27;d.&quot;

This imputation that he had betrayed his country, bloodied his hands in 1798, and deliberately deceived Catholics at the time of the Union all reportedly wounded Castlereagh. Moore learnt from a mutual connection that Castlereagh had said that &quot;the humorous and laughing things he did not at all mind, but the verses of the Tutor in the &quot;Fudge Family&quot; were quite another sort of thing, and were in very bad taste indeed.&quot; For openly casting the same aspersions against the former Chief Secretary, in 1811 the London-based Irish publisher and former United Irishman, Peter Finnerty, was sentenced to eighteen months for libel.

== Decline and death ==

Despite his contributions to the defeat of Napoleon and the restoration of peace, Castlereagh became extremely unpopular at home. He was attacked in the House of Commons by the Opposition for his support of repressive European governments, while the public resented his role in handling the Commons side of the divorce of George IV and Queen Caroline. He was also condemned for his association with repressive measures of the Home Secretary, Lord Sidmouth (the former Prime Minister Addington). As Leader of the House of Commons for the Liverpool Government, he was often called upon to defend government policy in the House. He had to support the widely reviled measures taken by Sidmouth and the others, including the infamous Six Acts, to remain in cabinet and continue his diplomatic work. For these reasons, Castlereagh appears with other members of Lord Liverpool&#x27;s Cabinet in Shelley&#x27;s poem &quot;The Masque of Anarchy&quot;, which was inspired by, and heavily critical of, the Peterloo Massacre:

After the death of his father in April 1821, which &quot;greatly afflicted him&quot;, Castlereagh became the 2nd Marquess of Londonderry. Although ineligible to continue sitting for an Irish constituency, as a non-representative Irish peer he was eligible to sit in the House of Commons for an English seat. Preparations had already been made, and he was able to vacate Down and swiftly win a by-election for his uncle Lord Hertford&#x27;s borough of Orford of which he had been an MP between 1796 and 1797. He also stood in good favour with the new King, George IV, who openly proposed to dismiss Lord Liverpool and appoint Castlereagh in his stead. Castlereagh&#x27;s relations with his colleagues, however, were beginning to break down, possibly under the influence of paranoia. In March 1821, he told his brother he lacked able support on the government benches, and that his parliamentary labours were &#x27;difficult to endure&#x27;.

By 1822, he was showing clear signs of a form of paranoia or a nervous breakdown. He was severely overworked with both his responsibilities in leading the government in the House and the never-ending diplomacy required to manage conflicts among the other major powers. His oratory in the House had never been of the highest calibre, but now he was considered to be practically incoherent. He spoke of resigning his office if matters did not improve.

Castlereagh began confessing to what was at the time criminal activity. He had already told his friend Mrs. Arbuthnot that he was being blackmailed for an alleged homosexual offence; at a 9 August meeting with the King, Castlereagh appeared distracted, said he was being mysteriously watched by a servant, and that he had committed all manner of crimes, remarking finally, &quot;I am accused of the same crime as the Bishop of Clogher.&quot; Percy Jocelyn, who had been the Bishop of Clogher until the previous month, was prosecuted for homosexuality. The King concluded he was unwell and urged him to rest.

The King then sent a message to Lord Liverpool warning him of Castlereagh&#x27;s illness; Liverpool initially failed to take the matter seriously and dismissed the message. Later that day, however, Castlereagh met with the Duke of Wellington, his cabinet colleague. Castlereagh behaved much as he had with the King; Wellington bluntly told Castlereagh he was not in his right mind, advised him to see a doctor, and alerted Castlereagh&#x27;s personal physician Charles Bankhead, as well as Castlereagh&#x27;s friends the Arbuthnots. On the advice of Bankhead, Castlereagh went to his country seat at Woollet Hall in Water Lane, North Cray, Kent, for a weekend stay. He continued to be distressed, and to the concern of his friends and family, ranted wildly about conspiracies and threats to his life. No special watch was kept on him, though his wife saw to it that his pistols and razors were locked away.

Lady Castlereagh wrote to the King informing him that her husband would be unable to continue with official business. The King responded with a note to Castlereagh that his minister did not live to read: &quot;Remember of what importance Your Health is to the Country but above all things to Me&quot;.

At about 7:30 am on the morning of 12 August 1822, he sent for Bankhead, who found him in a dressing room seconds after he had cut his own throat, using a small knife which had been overlooked. He collapsed when Bankhead entered, and died almost instantly.

Retrospective speculative diagnoses vary. At the time, his brother blamed &quot;the intrigues that were carried on by the women surrounding the king&quot; (the king&#x27;s mistress, Lady Conyngham, was not on good terms with Castlereagh&#x27;s wife). George Agar Ellis, on the other hand, concluded Castlereagh was disillusioned by &quot;the nothingness of human grandeurs ... the sad effects which disappointment and chagrin may have on a mind in which religion is not uppermost, for I have no doubt that the sad and apparently irretrievable state of affairs in England was the real cause of ... [his] unfortunate state of mind.&quot; Later verdicts attribute the problem to overwork and mental stress, or to &quot;a psychotic depressive illness&quot;. Other theories link various instances of (at the time) little explained illness to syphilis.

== Reaction to his death ==
An inquest concluded that the act had been committed while insane, avoiding the harsh strictures of a &quot;felo de se&quot; verdict. The verdict allowed Lady Londonderry to see her husband buried with honour in Westminster Abbey near his mentor, William Pitt. The pallbearers included the Prime Minister Lord Liverpool, the former Prime Minister Lord Sidmouth and two future Prime Ministers, the Duke of Wellington and Frederick Robinson. Some radicals, notably William Cobbett, claimed a &quot;cover-up&quot; within the government and viewed the verdict and Castlereagh&#x27;s public funeral as a damning indictment of the elitism and privilege of the unreformed electoral system. At his funeral on 20 August, the crowds which lined the funeral route were generally respectful and decorous, but some jeering and insults were heard (although not to the level of unanimity projected in the radical press); and there was cheering when the coffin was taken out of the hearse at the Abbey door. A funeral monument was not erected until 1850 when his half-brother and successor, Charles Stewart Vane, 3rd Marquess of Londonderry did so.

Some time after Castlereagh&#x27;s death, Lord Byron wrote a quip about his grave:

Some of his opponents were damning in their verdicts. Thomas Creevy defied &quot;any human being to discover a single feature of his character that can stand a moment&#x27;s criticism. By experience, good manners and great courage, he managed a corrupt House of Commons pretty well, with some address. This is the whole of his intellectual merit. He had a limited understanding and no knowledge, and his whole life was spent in an avowed, cold-blooded contempt of every honest public principle.&quot; Sir Robert Wilson believed that there had never been &quot;a greater enemy to civil liberty or a baser slave.&quot;

Others of Castlereagh&#x27;s political opponents were more gracious in their epigrams. Henry Brougham, a Whig politician and later the Lord Chancellor, who had battled frequently with Castlereagh, once almost to the point of calling him out, and had denigrated his skills as Leader, wrote in the week following Castlereagh&#x27;s death:

Modern historians stress the success of Castlereagh&#x27;s career in spite of the hatred and ignominy he suffered. Trevelyan contrasts his positive achievements and his pitiful failures. His diplomacy was applauded by historians. For example, in 1919 diplomatic historians recommended his wise policies of 1814–1815 to the British delegation to the Paris peace conferences that ended the First World War. Historian R. J. White underscores the paradox:
His biographer John Bew writes:
== Styles ==
Robert Stewart acquired the courtesy title Viscount Castlereagh in 1796 when his father was created Earl of Londonderry in the Irish peerage. Upon his father&#x27;s death in 1821, he succeeded as 2nd Marquess of Londonderry, a title to which his father had been raised in 1816. His younger half-brother, the soldier, politician and diplomat Charles Stewart (later Vane) succeeded him as 3rd Marquess of Londonderry in 1822.

He was styled through his life as follows:
*Robert Stewart, Esquire (1769–1789)
*&quot;The Honourable&quot; Robert Stewart (1789–1796)
*Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh (1796–1797)
*&quot;The Right Honourable&quot; Viscount Castlereagh (1797–1814)
*&quot;The Right Honourable&quot; Viscount Castlereagh, KG (1814–1821)
*&quot;The Most Honourable&quot; The Marquess of Londonderry, KG, GCH, PC, PC (Ire) (1821–1822)

== Memorials and tributes ==
*Castlereagh Street in Sydney was named after him in 1810 by Governor Macquarie.
*The Sydney suburb locality of Castlereagh was also named after him by Macquarie in 1810.
*The Castlereagh River in north-western New South Wales was dedicated to him in 1818 by George Evans and explored by John Oxley.
*The New South Wales electoral seat of Castlereagh also carried his name from 1904 until 1991.

<text>A fan or fanatic, sometimes also termed an aficionado, stan or enthusiast, is a person who exhibits strong interest or admiration for something or somebody, such as a celebrity, a sport, a sports team, a genre, a politician, a book, a movie, a video game or an entertainer. Collectively, the fans of a particular object or person constitute its fanbase or fandom. They may show their enthusiasm in a variety of ways, such as by promoting the object of their interest, being members of a related fan club, holding or participating in fan conventions or writing fan mail. They may also engage in creative activities (&quot;fan labor&quot;) such as creating fanzines, writing fan fiction, making memes, drawing fan art, or developing fan games.

==Etymology==
Merriam-Webster, the Oxford dictionary and other sources define &quot;fan&quot; as a shortened version of the word &quot;fanatic&quot;. &quot;Fanatic&quot; itself, introduced into English around 1550, means &quot;marked by excessive enthusiasm and often intense uncritical devotion&quot;. It comes from the Modern Latin &quot;fanaticus&quot;, meaning &quot;insanely but divinely inspired&quot;. The word originally pertained to a temple or sacred place [Latin &quot;fanum&quot;, poetic English &quot;fane&quot;]. The modern sense of &quot;extremely zealous&quot; dates from around 1647; the use of &quot;fanatic&quot; as a noun dates from 1650. However, the term &quot;fancy&quot; for an intense liking of something (a usage attested by 1545), while being of a different etymology, coincidentally carries a less intense but somewhat similar connotation to &quot;fanatic&quot;.

Use of &quot;the fancy&quot; to mean avid sports enthusiasts emerged as an Americanism in the mid-19th century. &quot;The Dickson Baseball Dictionary&quot; cites William Henry Nugent&#x27;s work asserting that it was derived from &quot;the fancy&quot;, a term referring to the fans of a specific hobby or sport from the early 18th century to the 19th, especially to the followers of boxing. According to that theory, it was originally shortened to &quot;fance&quot; then just to the homonym &quot;fans&quot;. &quot;The Great American Baseball Scrapbook&quot; attributes the term to Chris Von der Ahe, owner of the Saint Louis Brown Stockings in 1882. Von der Ahe sold tickets for 25 cents, hoping the many patrons would purchase his beer; the low ticket price helped him lead the stats in attendance. He called the fanatics filling his stands &quot;fans&quot;.

&quot;Supporter&quot; is a synonym to &quot;fan&quot; that predates the latter term and is still commonly used in British English, especially to denote fans of sports teams. However, the term &quot;fan&quot; has become popular throughout the English-speaking world, including the United Kingdom. The term &quot;supporter&quot; is also used in a political sense in the United States, to a fan of a politician, a political party, and a controversial issue.

==Characteristics==

Fans usually have a strong enough interest that some changes in their lifestyles are made to accommodate devotion to the focal object. Fans have a desire for external involvement – they are motivated to demonstrate their involvement with the area of interest through certain behaviors (attending conventions, posting online, displaying team banners outside their homes, etc.). Fans often have a &quot;wish to acquire&quot; material objects related to the area of interest, such as a baseball hit by a famous slugger or a used guitar pick from their musical hero. As well, some fans have a desire for social interaction with other fans. This again may take many forms, from casual conversation, e-mail, chat rooms, and electronic mailing lists to regular face-to-face meetings such as fan club meetings and organized conventions.

There are several groups of fans that can be differentiated by the intensity level of their level of involvement or interest in the hobby (level of fanaticism) The likelihood for a subject of interest to be elevated to the level of fandom appears to be dictated by its complexity. Complexity allows further involvement of fans for a longer period of time because of the time needed to work the subject of interest &#x27;out.&#x27; It also contributes to a greater sense of belonging because of the mental effort invested in the subject.

==Fan culture==
==Types==
===Celebrities===

These fans will often hold a crush on a major movie star, pop star, athlete or celebrity (see teen idol). The groupie is an example, a fan of a particular band or musician, who will follow them on concert tours. The degree of devotion to celebrities can range from a simple crush to the deluded belief that they have a special relationship with the star which does not exist. In extreme cases, this can lead to celebrity worship syndrome or stalking behavior. This can easily switch to hatred of the previously loved celebrity, and result in attempts at violent attacks; one notable incident being the death of Rebecca Schaeffer by a stalking fan, Robert John Bardo, in 1989.

The latter is somewhat related to the concept of parasocial interaction where audiences develop one-sided relationships with media personalities and celebrities.

Not all fans have a crush on their idols. There are also fans who want to become their friends or respect an idol&#x27;s relationship. In fact, there are fans who idolize celebrity couples.

===Gaming===

Gaming fans, or &quot;gamers&quot;, are fans focused on playing non-sport games, usually role-playing games, board games, miniature wargames, collectible card games or video games.

===Music===

Music fans can differ somewhat from fans of particular musicians, in that they may focus on a genre of music. Many of the trade journals around music, such as &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, were created by music fans. A notable music fan was groupie Cynthia Plaster Caster, famous for making numerous plaster casts of rock stars&#x27; penises. Another was Pamela Des Barres, author of the book &quot;I&#x27;m With The Band&quot;. Fans who are not groupies prefer the term &quot;supporter&quot;. In the 1960s, the extreme frenzy of music fans surrounding the Beatles became known as Beatlemania. In 2019, &quot;Billboard&quot; observed that popular musicians such as Tyler, the Creator had leveraged the power of fans to drive digital downloads using merchandise bundles. Similarly, &quot;GQ&quot; recognized Vampire Weekend for their commitment to extensive band merchandising for dedicated fans.

====Musicals====
Popular musicals have their own particular sets of fans. &quot;Rent&quot; has boasted a sizable number of &#x27;Rentheads&#x27; since its Broadway debut. Similarly, fans devoted to &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; have been dubbed &#x27;Phans&#x27;. In 2018, &quot;Playbill&quot; included &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; in its list of the &quot;Top 10 Musical Fandoms&quot; of the year.

===Otaku===
&quot;Otaku&quot; is a Japanese term for people with obsessive interests. In Japan, the term is normally derogatory, a connotation lacking in English, where it generally refers to people in the anime and manga fandom.

===Politics===
People who approve of or associate themselves with certain politicians or political groups are generally called &quot;supporters&quot; rather than &quot;fans&quot;, although there are politicians with official or unofficial &quot;fan clubs&quot;. Intense and organized support for a politician may be referred to as a personality cult, particularly in authoritarian or totalitarian regimes.

===Professional wrestling===

Fans of professional wrestling can be divided into two groups: marks and smarks. Derived from the same term for the prey of conmen, a mark is a fan who believes that everything associated with professional wrestling is real. In contrast, a &quot;smark&quot; is a fan who recognizes that they are witnessing a stage-managed work (&quot;kayfabe&quot;), but appreciates it nonetheless, including its backstage aspects.

===Science fiction===

Since the 1920s, an increasingly elaborate sub-culture of organized science fiction fandom has arisen, initially among correspondents to the letter columns of science fiction magazines. This non-centralized movement has given birth to science fiction fanzines (and amateur press associations), science fiction conventions, the Hugo Awards (and various imitators/derivatives), filk music, &quot;fan funds&quot; such as the Trans Atlantic Fan Fund, and a variety of other institutions, jargon and customs. It has nurtured writers and artists such as Ray Bradbury, Roger Ebert, Lenny Kaye, Michael Moorcock and Trina Robbins; and has generated such spin-offs as comic book fandom, media fandom, the Society for Creative Anachronism, gaming fandom, and furry fandom, sometimes collectively referred to as &quot;fringe fandoms&quot;.

Science fiction fandom developed its own slang, known as fanspeak after the &quot;Newspeak&quot; of the novel &quot;Nineteen Eighty-four&quot;. Fanspeak is made up of acronyms, blended words, obscure in-jokes, puns, coinages from science fiction novels or films, and archaic or standard English words used in specific ways relevant or amusing to the science fiction community. Some fanspeak terms, like fanzine have become standard English. Some fanspeak terms relate to fans themselves:
* An is a fan involved in &quot;&quot; (fan activity), such as producing a fanzine or running a convention. The opposite is a , who enjoys the subject of the fandom and is not directly involved in the fandom.
* A Big Name Fan (BNF) is a fan who has become well known within fandom for their contributions of various sorts, such as chairing a Worldcon or contributing to the genre itself.
* was used in early fandom as a feminine equivalent to &quot;fan&quot;.
* was used within fandom as the plural of the word &quot;fan&quot;, by analogy with &quot;men&quot; as the plural of &quot;man&quot;. This extended to other fanspeak terms, resulting in actifen, passifen, trufen, and so forth.
* A is a very active and dedicated fan.

Specific sub-groups of science fiction fandom are often known by a collection term. For example:
* Trekkies are fans focused on the &quot;Star Trek&quot; science fiction franchise. Arising out of science fiction fandom they, to some extent, have served as a template for other organized fandoms in the science fiction television and film genres. Some &quot;Trekkies&quot; prefer to be referred to as &quot;Trekkers&quot; as they feel the term &quot;Trekkies&quot; was used in the past as a derogatory name for them and they hope to avoid the traditional stigma sometimes associated with being known as a &quot;Trekkie&quot;. Many &quot;old school&quot; fans of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe defiantly, and proudly, refer to themselves, and other &quot;Star Trek&quot; fans, as &quot;Trekkies&quot; rather than the kinder, gentler &quot;Trekkers&quot; name used by many of the newer generations of &quot;Star Trek&quot; fans.
* Whovians are fans of the BBC series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;.

===Sports===

A sports fan can be an enthusiast for a particular athlete, team, sport, or all of organized sports as a whole. Sports fans often attend sporting events in stadiums, in sports bars, or watch them at home on television, and follow news through newspapers, websites, and social media.

The mentality of the sports fan is often such that they will experience a game, or event while living vicariously through players or teams whom the fan favors. This behavior manifests itself in a number of different ways, depending on the venue. At a stadium or arena, sports fans will voice their pleasure with a particular incident, player, or team by cheering, which consists of clapping, fist-pumping, or shouting positive exclamations toward the field of play and ultimately, the favorable object. Likewise, displeasure toward a particular incident, player, or team may be met by fans with booing, shouting of expletives, and sometimes throwing of objects onto the field. This violent type of fan reaction is often called hooliganism.

Lighter, more harmless objects are also occasionally thrown onto certain fields of play as a form of celebration of a favorable sports feat. This is most common when a member of the home team scores a hat trick in hockey. Other, more mild forms of displeasure shown by sports fans at sporting events involve simple groans of disappointment, and silence. These actions often denote that the favored home team is being outperformed by, or has lost to the much less-favored road team.

In North America, extremely enthusiastic fans are often called &quot;superfans&quot;: fans who dress up in outrageous and ostentatious costumes or outfits showing their devotion. Fanbases well known for their tenacious love and undying support are called &quot;rabid fans&quot; or fanatics. These fans often congregate hours before kickoff in what is known as a tailgation or tailgating.

At sports bars, sports fans will gather together, often while consuming food and alcoholic beverages, with the purpose of following a particular sporting event on television as a group. Sports bars often advertise in hopes of drawing fans of a particular player or team to watch together to increase bonds between fans and prevent fights. This can create the sense of unity in a sports bar as all cheers and boos will appear to be synchronized due to similar feelings and reactions by nearly all fans at the fortunes and misfortunes of the favored team or athlete. Due to the level of devotion and intensity of feeling towards the favored team or athlete by sports bar patrons, as well as partially due to the alcohol being served, behavior that would be seen as unruly or fanatical outside a sports bar is generally more common inside of one. The intensity of cheering and jeering at a sports bar by sports fans can often range from equal to stronger than that of fans actually at the sporting event for particularly significant games and matches.

At home, sports fans may have few fellow fans but also more freedom. This is sometimes where the most intense cheering or jeering will take place. In the fan&#x27;s own home, unbridled and lengthy screaming, crying, acts of destruction to household objects, and other manifestations of joy or anguish, are perhaps seen as most acceptable in comparison to the sports bar or sporting venue simply because such acts taken to such an extreme can be seen as disruptive to a large number of fellow fans even if they share the same sentiment if it is of less intensity. The greatest variables of the reaction of a sports fan in their own home are the intensity of the fan&#x27;s desire to see their team win or perform well, and the presence of another: often a wife, children, or friends who may be significantly less ardent sports fans or not sports fans at all, which may significantly temper the fan&#x27;s reaction to a highly positive or negative moment due to the fear of causing a scene or scaring those close to the fan, or alienating themselves from said others. Often sports fans will invite other fans of relatively similar rooting intensity over to their house to experience a sporting event together so that all involved can voice pleasure or displeasure to their heart&#x27;s content and increase shared bonds in the process. It is becoming common for this type of bonding to take place over sports-related social networks.

==Fan psychology and motives==

===Sports===

The drivers that make people fans, and in particular sports fans, have been studied by psychologists, such as Dan Wann at Murray State University, and communication scholars, such as Adam Earnheardt at Youngstown State University.

They attribute people becoming fans to the following factors: One element is entertainment, because sports spectatorship is a form of leisure. Sports is also a form of escapism, and being a fan gives one an excuse to yell at something, an activity that may be constrained in other areas of one&#x27;s life. Fan activities give participants a combination of euphoria and stress (about the potential for their team to lose) for which they coin the name &quot;eustress&quot;. Fans experience euphoria during moments when play is going well for their team, and stress when play is going against their team. This tension between the two emotions generates an unusual sense of pleasure or heightened sensations.

Aesthetics are another draw for some fans, who appreciate the precision or skill of play, or of the coordinated movement of the players during a pre-planned &quot;play&quot;. Family bonding is a reason for some fan activities. Some families watch televised sports on a regular basis and go to sports games as a family outing to watch events and form a psychological bond with one another and as a family. Others with no biological relations may view the team and fanbase as their family as Arsenal fan Maria Petri stated. Going to sports events can create a borrowed sense of self-esteem if fans identify with their teams to the extent that they consider themselves to be successful when their teams have been successful (e.g., as seen in the phrase &quot;we have won&quot;). If a fan identifies strongly with a favorite team, they will respond to the performance of the team as if team success were a personal success and team failure a personal failure.

===Loyalty===

Fan loyalty is the loyalty felt and expressed by a fan towards the object of their fanaticism. Allegiances can be strong or weak. The loyalties of sports fans have been studied by psychologists and have often been reviewed.

Fangirls and fanboys in fandoms sometimes, with various meanings, consider their fandom to be their &quot;family&quot;, and feel very loyal to it, usually.

According to a study by psychologists from Cambridge University, the more that people publicly express admiration for a public figure, the more likely it is that the fans&#x27; faith in the public figure will remain unaffected following &quot;moral violations&quot; by the adored person.

===&quot;Stan&quot; fans===

A stan is an excessively avid fan and supporter of a celebrity, TV show, group, musical artist, film or film series. The object of the stan&#x27;s affection is often called &quot;bias&quot; (or &quot;fave&quot;, although that is an outdated term). The term comes from the 2000 song &quot;Stan&quot; by American rapper Eminem, which tells the story of an obsessive and delusional fan. The term has frequently been used to describe artist devotees whose fanaticism matches the severity of the obsessive character in the song. The word is sometimes described as a portmanteau of &quot;stalker&quot; and &quot;fan&quot;, but this has never been confirmed. A website known as &quot;Stan Wars&quot; or &quot;stanipedia&quot; sprouted up to host discussions and flame wars between rival fanbases. The Korean equivalent for a stan is a sasaeng. Stan culture has been criticized for being toxic and parasocial.

====Usage====

Colloquially, the term can be used as both a noun or a verb. Stans of a particular artist are often given more detailed names, such as &quot;Arianators&quot; for fans of Ariana Grande, &quot;Directioner&quot; for fans of One Direction, &quot;Katycats&quot; for fans of Katy Perry, and &quot;Swifties&quot; for fans of Taylor Swift. Some artists, however, do not have specific titles attributed to their stans; fans of Kylie Minogue have been called Kylie Stans. Even for fandoms with specific titles, the &quot;artist stan&quot; formula still applies.

Some of these monikers are almost universally known and used by fans of the artists as well as outsiders. Other nicknames are not commonly used, neither by outsiders nor by the concerning fan-base, such as Kylie Minogue&#x27;s &quot;Kylie Stans&quot;, Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Madonna Fans&quot;, Maroon 5&#x27;s &quot;Maroon 5 Stans&quot; or Nick Jonas&#x27;s so called &quot;Nick Jonas Fans&quot;, usually appearing on social media networks such as Twitter and Tumblr, The term &quot;stan&quot; is also used to describe fans of K-pop. The term is not to be confused with Sasaeng fans, which are overly obsessed fans who stalk and sometimes bring harm to idols.

The term was added to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; in 2017.

====Celebrity reaction====
Celebrities have positively reacted to their &quot;stan&quot; followings. Notably, English singer-songwriter Jessie J had this to say about her stans, &quot;They support me and buy my albums and singles, and they stand outside hotels, and they come to shows, and they get tattoos of my lyrics and they cut their hair like me. You have to love your fans. That&#x27;s why I call them my Heartbeats, because without them I wouldn&#x27;t be here&quot;. In 2012, after Jessie J broke her leg, a stan broke her own leg to emulate the injury. The fan tracked down Jessie J&#x27;s personal address and sent her a photograph of the self-inflicted injury. The singer was horrified and decided to increase her security.

Singer-songwriter Lorde has a different opinion on the matter of giving her followers a nickname. She discouraged it by saying &quot;I find it grating to lump everyone into a really awkward, pun-centric name&quot; and affirmed she will never name her fanbase.

==Gender stereotypes==
===Societal gender roles===
====Discrimination against females====
Women tend to be &quot;more restricted in their leisure choices and opportunities than men,&quot; and their experiences within fandoms are typically demeaned to a more sexualized, emotional, or bodily experience, as opposed to intellectual interests. For example, in music, women are more predominant, and accepted, within pop music fandoms, which Diane Railton describes as evoking an emotional and physical response, in contrast with the &#x27;masculine&#x27; rock music, which is defined as &#x27;serious&#x27; music with a &#x27;meaning&#x27;, focusing on political, cultural, and psychological discussion. Due to this, women are rarely given space or voice within the intellectual realm of music. According to Frank Zappa, &quot;men come to hear the music and chicks come for the sex thrills,&quot; implying that women&#x27;s involvement in fan communities is purely sexual, and that they are incapable of displaying intellectual or artistic interest in the music itself. Those who do manage to become involved within the world of &#x27;serious&#x27; music are often relegated to the realm of a &#x27;groupie&#x27;. A groupie, according to Cheryl Cline, is

[A] person (a woman, usually), who &#x27;chases after&#x27; rock stars, as my mother would say. But &#x27;groupie&#x27; is also used more or less synonymously with &#x27;girl Rock fan&#x27;, &#x27;female journalist&#x27;, and &#x27;woman Rock musician&#x27;; it&#x27;s used to mean anyone working in the music field who isn&#x27;t actually a Rock musician; it&#x27;s used as an all-purpose insult and a slut on one&#x27;s professionalism; it&#x27;s used as a cute term for &#x27;hero worship&#x27;; and it&#x27;s used interchangeably with &#x27;fan&#x27;.

In other words, the term &#x27;groupie&#x27; (used synonymously with the term &#x27;fan&#x27; or &#x27;fangirl&#x27;) is frequently used to shame women involved within the music community, restricting their involvement to sexual relations with band members or worshipping male rock stars.

This trend can also be observed within other fan communities, such as comic book fandoms, where women are frequently portrayed as &quot;Fake Geek Girls&quot;, only interested in comic books to impress guys or to view the attractive men present within their content, or sports communities, where women are often made uncomfortable at live sporting events due to the overt sexism and aggressive masculinity displayed by male spectators, and then labelled as &#x27;inauthentic&#x27; for viewing the games via television instead. Within hockey, female fans are often called &quot;Puck Bunnies&quot;, defined as,

[S]omeone who hangs around the players, always on the lookout for the chance to get that autograph / photograph / quick pint [drink] / quick knee trem-bler round the back of the Arena from the player or players (or even coach) of their choice, heck let&#x27;s face it even the water carrier is in with a chance here.

Such discrimination against female fans can become violent at times in an effort to police &quot;authenticity&quot;. The recent events known as GamerGate provide a good example of such attacks, whereby multiple women working within the gaming industry were victims of sexual harassment and violent threats, some even forced to leave their homes for fear of a physical confrontation.

The fangirls&#x27;, often stereotyped as female, so-called &#x27;hysteria&#x27; is described as the product of sexual repression. However, while it is expected for women to be involved in certain fandoms for physical or sexual reasons, this is also viewed as undesirable and driven by hormonal changes.

These acts of adoration are societally limited to adolescent youth, or menopausal women, in both instances blaming &quot;these two periods of hormonal lunacy&quot; on the irrational, overtly sexual behaviour. For instance, Cheryl Cline, in her text entitled &quot;Essays from Bitch: The Women&#x27;s Rock Newsletter with Bite&quot;, discusses how women need to keep their interests hidden once they pass adolescence. In her own words, &quot;[i]t&#x27;s a sign of maturity to pack up all the posters, photos, magazines, scrapbooks, and unauthorized biographies you so lovingly collected and shove them in the back of the closet.

These conflicting accounts of fangirl behaviour are due to the belief that women are not supposed to express such sexual fantasies unless influenced by some hormonal induced craziness, while for men it is normal to be sexual regardless of age. As Cheryl Cline summarizes, 
It&#x27;s much easier for a man to be indulgent about the crushes of teenage girls than it is for him to be fair-minded about the sexual fantasies of the woman he loves when they&#x27;re about someone else. And the same guy who&#x27;ll leave &quot;Penthouse&quot; in the bathroom will yell, &#x27;No woman of mine is gonna hang a poster of Prince naked to the waist on the inside of the closet of the spare room where no one will see it!&#x27; […] [U]ntil you reach the age when everybody thinks you&#x27;re crazy anyway, so why not admit to an intense hankering to run your fingers through Willie Nelson&#x27;s whiskers?

====Discrimination against males====
According to Jackson Katz in the documentary &quot;Tough Guise 2&quot;, boys are taught early on that to be &quot;real men&quot; they need to be tough and not to show their feelings.

[Men] can&#x27;t show any emotion except anger. We can&#x27;t think too much or seem too intellectual. We can&#x27;t back down when someone disrespects us. We have to show we&#x27;re tough enough to inflict physical pain and take it in turn. We&#x27;re supposed to be sexually aggressive with women. And then we&#x27;re taught that if we step out of this box, we risk being seen as soft, weak, feminine, or gay.

He later elaborates, stating that, 
Qualities like compassion, caring, empathy, intellectual curiosity, fear, vulnerability, even love – basic human qualities that boys have inside them every bit as much as girls do – get methodically driven out of them by a sexist and homophobic culture that labels these things as &#x27;unmanly,&#x27; &#x27;feminine,&#x27; &#x27;womanly,&#x27; and &#x27;gay,&#x27; and teaches boys to avoid them at all costs.

And, most importantly, they&#x27;re taught that real men turn to violence not as a last resort, but as the go-to method of resolving disputes – and also as a primary means of winning respect and establishing masculine credibility.

In the predecessor to this documentary, &quot;Tough Guise&quot;, Katz also addresses the issue of body image, using multiple movies, such as &quot;Terminator&quot; and &quot;Rambo&quot;, as well as action figures like G.I. Joe, to illustrate how &#x27;real men&#x27; are defined as big, strong, and muscular.

Fanboy portrayals, by definition, do not fit into this mold of a &#x27;real man&#x27;, with the exception of sports fans. In a study by Gerard Jones on comic book fans, he described the comic book fanboys as &quot;small, anxious, withdrawn, and terrified of the opposite sex.&quot; Quite the opposite of the &#x27;real man&#x27; previously described by Katz. Their interests may also be considered as a deviation from societal gender roles, according to Noah Berlastsky, such as playing &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; instead of football. This lack of traditional masculine traits warrants them much teasing from peers, parental figures, coaches, or older male role models for not conforming to these ideas of masculinity. A popular example of such treatment in mainstream media is shown on the sitcom &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;, where, multiple times throughout the show&#x27;s run, the four main characters, portrayed as &#x27;nerdy fanboys&#x27;, are humiliated by larger &#x27;real men&#x27;. For instance, in the show pilot, the two main characters, Leonard and Sheldon, get their pants taken by the main female character&#x27;s ex-boyfriend, who is portrayed as big, strong, tough, confident, and successful with women.

Furthermore, fanboys also deal with issues of gender discrimination in relation to their fandom interests. For example, Bronies, a group of young men enthralled by the TV show &quot;My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic&quot;, a show typically geared towards young girls, are often the target of ridicule. Their interest in a &#x27;feminine&#x27; media item can be the cause of great shame, causing many to become &#x27;private&#x27; bronies, enjoying the show in secret out of fear.

===Fangirl===
Fangirls are often portrayed as teenagers obsessed with something to a frightening degree. The term is often used in a demeaning, derogatory fashion and is said to describe the fans that give &quot;normal&quot; fans a bad name. In fact, the term &quot;fangirling&quot; is used to describe anyone who obsessively follows a certain fandom to the point where it interferes with their daily lives. Such a trend of &#x27;authentic&#x27; versus &#x27;inauthentic&#x27; fan is common within fan communities, and is particularly pertinent to gender discrimination and misogynistic ideals. However, on the other hand of the spectrum, some fangirls have embraced the title, considering it a compliment rather than a derogatory term.

====Immaturity in fangirls====

In terms of their involvement within fandoms, fangirls are typically portrayed as losing all control, fainting, sobbing, and dashing about in mobs. For instance, while describing the phenomenon of Beatlemania, fan activity is described by stating that: 
The appropriate reaction to contact with [the Beatles] – such as occupying the same auditorium or city block – was to sob uncontrollably while screaming, &#x27;I&#x27;m gonna die, I&#x27;m gonna die,&#x27; or, more optimistically, the name of a favorite Beatle, until the onset of either unconsciousness or laryngitis. Girls peed in their pants, fainted, or simply collapsed from the emotional strain.

Furthermore, while discussing Beatlemania and the crazed Beatles fangirl behaviour, Barbara Ehrenreich, Elizabeth Heiss, and Gloria Jacobs mention how the &#x27;only cure&#x27; for what was at the time considered an affliction was age, and that similarly to &quot;the girls who had screamed for Frank Sinatra,&quot; the Beatles fangirls would &quot;[grow] up to be responsible, settled &quot; individuals.

===Fanboy===


Fanboys are frequently portrayed as &quot;angry nerds&quot;, over-aggressive, derogatory, and protective of the object of their obsession, or as bespectacled, geekoid, obsessive fans. The term nerd, defined as &quot;[an] insignificant, foolish, or socially inept person; a person who is boringly conventional or studious; a person who pursues an unfashionable or highly technical interest with obsessive or exclusive dedication,&quot; as well as the term geek, defined as &quot;[a] person […] who is regarded as foolish, offensive, worthless; an overly diligent, unsociable student; any unsociable person obsessively devoted to a particular pursuit,&quot; are often used to describe stereotypical fanboys. In regards to chosen fandoms, they are typically associated with comic books, video games, science fiction movies or television series, or technology (such as computer or smartphone brands).

An exception to this portrayal is the sports fan, who is expected to be overtly sexual, and aggressive. This portrayal is particularly dominant within the sports arena, which provides a legitimate site for people to act in hypermasculinized ways. According to &quot;Many [men] want to be overtly sexist and racist. They need to have this exaggerated sense of their sexuality to defend themselves from potential accusations that they are not real men.&quot;

====Immaturity in fanboys====

Fanboys are often portrayed as quite angry, violent, and offensive while defending the objects of their affection, such as the smartphone fanboys who frequently verbally attack anybody saying anything the slightest bit offensive about their chosen technological product through online anonymous sites.

<text>Rush goalie, also known as a fly goalie or fly keeper and in some parts of the UK, goalie wag or nearest dearest, is a variation of association football in which the role of the goalkeeper is more flexible than normal. The goalkeeper position is taken by any player who can run out of and leave their goal to actively participate in outfield play. However, when defending the player returns to their goal and takes up the role of goalkeeper once again; in rush goalie only one player can be the goalkeeper and handle the ball. Once the danger has passed, that player (the &quot;rush goalie&quot;) returns to normal outfield play. Rush goalie is only played in informal football matches, usually by children, and often when the players want to play a more active role in the game than the position of goalkeeper would normally allow; it can also be applied when the number of players per side is low.

A rush goalie system can also be used as a way of leveling out teams when playing with an uneven number of players – usually, the team with an extra man will be forced to nominate one player to stay in goal permanently (also known as &quot;stick keeper&quot; or simply &quot;sticks&quot;), while the other team is allowed to play &quot;rush&quot;.

==Variations==
A variation of the game is known as Last Man Back, magic rush, Spock (in the West Midlands), spider goalie, monkey rush, rush and veg, scramble (Kent, London, and the South East of England), or butterfly (East Anglia). In Last Man Back no player is chosen as the goalkeeper for a team, and all players participate in outfield play, usually leaving the position of goalkeeper open. However, when the other team is on the attack, the closest player to the net or the Last Man Back is allowed to handle the ball, taking on the role of goalkeeper.

This can create controversy as to who was actually the closest player to the net, so sometimes Nets is played. In this variant, players are only allowed to handle the ball in the area provided they have shouted &quot;nets&quot; or &quot;when&quot; (or other regional variants) before touching the ball.

Another variation, common on schoolgrounds in Canada, includes the ability of multiple players to play the role of goalkeeper, simultaneously. Any player may make a play with their hands as if they were the goalkeeper, as long as they are in the goal area, or &quot;crease&quot;.

<doc id="152643" wikidata="Q193220" url="?curid=152643" title="Hand fan">
<text>A handheld fan, or simply hand fan, is a broad, flat surface that is waved back-and-forth to create an airflow. Generally, purpose-made handheld fans are folding fans, which are shaped like a sector of a circle and made of a thin material (such as paper or feathers) mounted on slats which revolve around a pivot so that it can be closed when not in use. Hand fans were used before mechanical fans were invented.

Fans work by utilizing the concepts of Thermodynamics. On human skin, the airflow from hand fans increase the evaporation rate of sweat, lowering body temperature due to the latent heat of the evaporation of water. It also increases heat convection by displacing the warmer air produced by body heat that surrounds the skin, which has an additional cooling effect, provided that the ambient air temperature is lower than the skin temperature, which is typically about . 

Next to the folding fan, the rigid hand screen fan was also a highly decorative and desired object among the higher social classes. They serve a different purpose to the lighter, easier to carry hand fans. Hand screen fans were mostly used to shield a lady&#x27;s face against the glare of the sun or fire.

==History==

=== Africa ===
Hand fans originated about 4000 years ago in Egypt. Egyptians viewed them as sacred objects, and the tomb of Tutankhamun contained two elaborate hand fans.

=== Ancient Europe ===
Archaeological ruins and ancient texts show that the hand fan was used in ancient Greece at least from the 4th century BC and was known as a (). Fans were also used to keep flies away (like a fly-flapper), this kind of fan was less stiff and was named μυιoσόβη. Another use for a fan was to fan the flame, e.g. in cookery or at the altar.

Christian Europe&#x27;s earliest known fan was the flabellum (ceremonial fan), which dates from the 6th century. It was used during services to drive insects away from the consecrated bread and wine. Its use died out in western Europe, but continues in the Eastern Orthodox and Ethiopian Churches.

=== East Asia ===

==== China ====
There were many kinds of fans in ancient China. The Chinese character for &quot;fan&quot; () is etymologically composed of the characters for &quot;door&quot; () and &quot;feather&quot; (). Historically, fans have played an important aspect in the life of the Chinese people. The Chinese have used hand-held fans as a way to relieve themselves during hot days since the ancient times; the fans are also an embodiment of the wisdom of Chinese culture and art. They were also used for ceremonial and ritual purposes and as a sartorial accessory when wearing . They were also carriers of Chinese traditional arts and literature and were representative of its user&#x27;s personal aesthetic sense and their social status. Specific concepts of status and gender were associated with types of fans in Chinese history, but generally folding fans were reserved for males while rigid fans were for females.

In ancient China, fans came in various shapes and forms (such as in a leaf, oval or a half-moon shape), and were made in different materials such as silk, bamboo, and feathers. So far, the earliest fans that have been found date to the Spring and Autumn and Warring States period. It was suggested by the Cultural Relics Archaeology Institute of Hubei Province that these fans were made of either bamboo or feathers and were oftentimes used as burial objects in the State of Chu. The oldest existing Chinese fans are a pair of woven bamboo, wood or paper side-mounted fans from the 2nd century BC. The Chinese form of the feather fan, known as , was a row of feathers mounted in the end of a handle. The arts of fan making eventually progressed to the point that by the Jin dynasty, fans could come in different shapes and could be made in different materials. The selling of hexagonal-shaped fan was also recorded in the &quot;Book of Jin&quot;.

In later centuries, Chinese poems and four-word idioms were used to decorate fans, using Chinese calligraphy pens. The Chinese dancing fan was developed in the 7th century.


The most ancient ritual Chinese fan is the , also known as , which is believed to have been invented by Emperor Shun. It is characterized with a long handle and the fan looks like a door in shape. This type of fan was used for ceremonial purposes. While its shape evolved throughout the millennia, it remained used as a symbol of imperial power and authority; it continued to be used until the fall of the Qing dynasty.
Silk round-shaped fans are called (), also known as &quot;fans of reunion&quot;; it is a type of &quot;rigid fan&quot;. These types of fans were mostly used by women in the Tang dynasty and were later introduced into Japan. These round fans remained mainstream even after the growing popularity of the folding fans. Round fans with Chinese paintings and with calligraphy became very popular in the Song dynasty. During the Song dynasty, famous artists were often commissioned to paint fans. Lacquer fans were also one of the unique handcraft of the Song dynasty.

Chinese brides also used a type of moon-shaped round fan in a traditional Chinese wedding called . The ceremonial rite of was an important ceremony in Chinese wedding: the bride would hold it in front of her face to hide her shyness, to remain mysterious, and as a way to exorcise evil spirits. After all the other wedding ceremonies were completed and after the groom had impressed the bride, the bride would then proceed in revealing her face to the groom by removing the from her face.
===== =====

Another popular type of Chinese fan was the palm leaf fan (), also known as (), which was made of the leaves and stalks of (&quot;Livistona chinensis&quot;).
The folding fan (), invented in Japan, was later introduced to the Chinese in the 10th century. In 988 AD, folding fans were first introduced in China by a Japanese monk from Japan as a tribute during the Northern Song dynasty; these folding fans became very fashionable in China by the Southern Song dynasty. The folding fans were referred to as &quot;Japanese fans&quot; by the Chinese. While the folding fans gained popularity, the traditional silk round fans continued to remain mainstream in the Song dynasty. The folding fan later became very fashionable in the Ming dynasty; however, folding fans were met with resistance because they were believed to be intended for the lower-class people and servants.

The Chinese also innovated the design of the folding fan by creating the fan (&#x27;broken fan&#x27;).

===== Foreign export =====
From the late 18th century until 1845, trade between America and China flourished. During this period, Chinese fans reached the peak of their popularity in America; popular fans among American women were the fan, and fans made of palm leaf, feather, and paper. The most popular type during this period appeared to have been the palm leaf fan. The custom of using fans among the American middle class and by ladies was attributed to this Chinese influence.

==== Japan ====
In ancient Japan, hand fans, such as oval and silk fans, were greatly influenced by Chinese fans. The earliest visual depiction of fans in Japan dates back to the 6th century AD, with burial tomb paintings showed drawings of fans. The folding fan was invented in Japan, with dates ranging from the 6th to 9th centuries; it was a court fan called the , after the court women&#x27;s dress named . According to the (History of Song), a Japanese monk offered the folding fans (twenty and two to the emperor of China in 988.

Later in the 11th century, Korean envoys brought along Korean folding fans which were of Japanese origin as gifts to Chinese court. The popularity of folding fans was such that sumptuary laws were passed during Heian period which restricted the decoration of both and paper folding fans.

The earliest fans in Japan were made by tying thin stripes of (or Japanese cypress) together with thread. The number of strips of wood differed according to the person&#x27;s rank. Later in the 16th century, Portuguese traders introduced it to the west and soon both men and women throughout the continent adopted it. They are used today by Shinto priests in formal costume and in the formal costume of the Japanese court (they can be seen used by the Emperor and Empress during enthronement and marriage) and are brightly painted with long tassels. Simple Japanese paper fans are sometimes known as .

Printed fan leaves and painted fans are done on a paper ground. The paper was originally handmade and displayed the characteristic watermarks. Machine-made paper fans, introduced in the 19th century, are smoother, with an even texture. Even today, geisha and use folding fans in their fan dances as well.

Japanese fans are made of paper on a bamboo frame, usually with a design painted on them. In addition to folding fans (), the non-bending fans () are popular and commonplace. The fan is primarily used for fanning oneself in hot weather. The fan subsequently spread to other parts of Asia, including Burma, Thailand, Cambodia and Sri Lanka, and such fans are still used by Buddhist monks as &quot;ceremonial fans&quot;.

Fans were also used in the military as a way of sending signals on the field of battle. However, fans were mainly used for social and court activities. In Japan, fans were variously used by warriors as a form of weapon, by actors and dancers for performances, and by children as a toy.

Traditionally, the rigid fan (also called fixed fan) was the most popular form in China, although the folding fan came into popularity during the Ming dynasty between the years of 1368 and 1644, and there are many beautiful examples of these folding fans still remaining.

The (or Japanese dancing fan) has ten sticks and a thick paper mount showing the family crest, and Japanese painters made a large variety of designs and patterns. The slats, of ivory, bone, mica, mother of pearl, sandalwood, or tortoise shell, were carved and covered with paper or fabric. Folding fans have &quot;montures&quot; which are the sticks and guards, and the leaves were usually painted by craftsmen. Social significance was attached to the fan in the Far East as well, and the management of the fan became a highly regarded feminine art. Fans were even used as a weapon – called the iron fan, or in Japanese.

==== Korea ====

Every Dano (May 5 of the lunar calendar) when the heat began, there was a custom in which the king distributed hand fans to his vassals. The vassal, who received a hand fan from the king, did an ink-and-wash painting and handed out white fans to his elders and the indebted people, which has made the practice of exchanging hand fans widely popular. These cultural factors also contributed to the creation of various types of hand fan in Korea.

==== Vietnam ====
The hand fan () is an integral part of Vietnamese culture. According to the Vân Đài Loại Ngữ, a book written by Lê Quý Ðôn, in the old times Vietnamese people used hand fans made from bird feather and , a type of fan made from leaves of the taraw palm tree. The folding fans only started appearing in Vietnam in the 10th century, known as in Vietnamese. Christian missionary Christoforo Borri recorded that in 1621, both Vietnamese men and women frequently held hand fans as part of their daily garment.

Many villages in Vietnam have long-dating traditions of making exquisite hand fans such as Canh Hoạch village and Đào Xá village, with fan-making dating back to the early 19th century.

Simple handheld fans, such as and the are commonly found in the Vietnamese countrysides and popularly used among farmers and working people. The has the simplest design, cut directly from the dried Areca leaf stems, then pressed to flatten. It appears in &quot;Thằng Bờm&quot;, a well-known Vietnamese (a type of Vietnamese folk song). The also has a simple design, made by sewing a half-moon shaped Maclurochloa leaf onto a straight bamboo stick.

=== Re-introduction in Europe ===


Hand fans were absent from Europe during the High Middle Ages until they were reintroduced in the 13th and 14th centuries. Fans from the Middle East were brought by Crusaders, and refugees from the Eastern Roman Empire.

In the 15th and early 16th century, Chinese folding fans were introduced in Europe and later played an important role in the social circles of Europe in the 18th century. The Portuguese traders first opened up the sea route to China in the 15th century and reached Japan in the mid-16th century, and appear to be the first people who introduced Oriental (Chinese and Japanese) fans in Europe which lead to their popularity, as well as the increased oriental fan imports in Europe.

The fan became especially popular in Spain, where flamenco dancers used the fan and extended its use to the nobility.

European fan-makers have introduced more modern designs and have enabled the hand fan to work with modern fashion.

==== 17th century ====

In the 17th century the folding fan, and its attendant semiotic culture, were introduced from China and Japan. By the end of the 17th century, there were enormous imports of China folding in Europe due to its popularity and to a lesser extent, Japanese folding fans were also reaching Europe by that period.

These fans are particularly well displayed in the portraits of the high-born women of the era. Queen Elizabeth I of England can be seen to carry both folding fans decorated with pom poms on their guardsticks as well as the older style rigid fan, usually decorated with feathers and jewels. These rigid style fans often hung from the skirts of ladies, but of the fans of this era it is only the more exotic folding ones which have survived. Those folding fans of the 15th century found in museums today have either leather leaves with cut out designs forming a lace-like design or a more rigid leaf with inlays of more exotic materials like mica. One of the characteristics of these fans is the rather crude bone or ivory sticks and the way the leather leaves are often slotted onto the sticks rather than glued as with later folding fans. Fans made entirely of decorated sticks without a fan &quot;leaf&quot; were known as fans. The fan originated in China. However, despite the relative crude methods of construction, folding fans were at this era high status, exotic items on par with elaborate gloves as gifts to royalty.

In the 17th century the rigid fan which was seen in portraits of the previous century had fallen out of favour as folding fans gained dominance in Europe. Fans started to display well painted leaves, often with a religious or classical subject. The reverse side of these early fans also started to display elaborate flower designs. The sticks are often plain ivory or tortoiseshell, sometimes inlaid with gold or silver pique work. The way the sticks sit close to each other, often with little or no space between them is one of the distinguishing characteristics of fans of this era.

In 1685 the Edict of Nantes was revoked in France. This caused large scale immigration from France to the surrounding Protestant countries (such as England) of many fan craftsmen. This dispersion in skill is reflected in the growing quality of many fans from these non-French countries after this date.

==== 18th century ====

In the 18th century, fans reached a high degree of artistry and were being made throughout Europe often by specialized craftsmen, either in leaves or sticks. Folded fans of silk, or parchment were decorated and painted by artists. Fans were also imported from China by the East India Companies at this time. Around the middle 18th century, inventors started designing mechanical fans. Wind-up fans (similar to wind-up clocks) were popular in the 18th century.

==== 19th century ====
In the 19th century in the West, European fashion caused fan decoration and size to vary.
It has been said that in the courts of England, Spain and elsewhere, fans were used in a more or less secret, unspoken code of messages. These fan languages were a way to cope with the restricting social etiquette. However, modern research has proved that this was a marketing ploy developed in the 19th century – one that has kept its appeal remarkably over the succeeding centuries. This is now used for marketing by fan makers like Cussons &amp; Sons &amp; Co. Ltd who produced a series of advertisements in 1954 showing &quot;the language of the fan&quot; with fans supplied by the well known French fan maker Duvelleroy.

The rigid or screen fan () became also fashionable during the 18th and 19th century. They never reached the same level of popularity as the easy to carry around, folding fans which became almost an integrated part of women&#x27;s dress. The screen fan was mainly used inside the interior of the house. In 18th and 19th century paintings of interiors one sometimes sees one laying on a chimney mantle. They were mainly used to protect a woman&#x27;s face against the glare and heat of the fire, to avoid getting , or ruddy cheeks from the heat. But probably not in the least it served to keep the heat from spoiling the carefully applied make-up which in those days was often wax-based. Until the 20th century houses were heated by open fires in chimneys or by stoves, and the lack of insulation made many a house very draughty and cold during winter. Therefore, any social or family gathering would be in close proximity to the fireplace.

The design of the screen fan is a fixed handle, most often made out of exquisitely turned (painted or guided) wood, fixed to a flat screen. The screen could be made out of silk stretched on a frame or thin wood, leather or papier mache. The surface is often exquisitely painted with scenes ranging from flowers and birds of paradise to religious scenes. At the end of the 19th century they disappeared when the need for them ceased to exist. During the 19th century names like the Birmingham-based firm of Jennens and Bettridge produced many papier-mâché fans.

== Modern day ==

Modern day hand fans are less popular than in the past, but are still used by many.

===Drag subculture===
A large group that continues to use folding hand fans for cultural and fashion use are drag queens. Stemming from ideas of imitating and appropriating cultural ideas of excess, wealth, status and elegance, large folding hand fans, sometimes or more in radius, are used to punctuate speech, as part of performances, or as accessories to an outfit. Fans may have phrases taken from the lexicon of drag and LGBTQ+ culture written on them, and may be decorated in other ways, such as the addition of sequins or tassels.

Folding fans are often used to emphasize a point in a person&#x27;s speech, rather than for express use of fanning oneself. A person might harshly snap open the fan when engaging in &quot;throwing shade&quot; on (comically insulting) another person, creating a loud snapping noise that punctuates the insult. Drag dance numbers also utilise larger hand fans as a way to add flair and as a prop, used to emphasise movements in the dance.

Popular drag comedy webshow UNHhhh has used folding fans as a point of humour, with the sound made by a folding fan unfolding coined onomatopoeically as a &quot;thworp&quot; by the editors.

==Categories==
Hand fans have three general categories:
#Fixed (or rigid, flat) fans (Chinese: , ; Japanese: , ): circular fans, palm-leaf fans, straw fans, feather fans
#Folding fans (Chinese: , ; Japanese: , ): silk folding fans, paper folding fans, sandalwood fans
#Modern powered mechanical hand fans: hand fans which appear as mini mechanical rotating fans with blades. These are usually axial fans, and often use blades made from a soft material for safety. These are usually battery operated, but can be hand cranked as well.

<doc id="152646" wikidata="Q16842586" url="?curid=152646" title="Keepie uppie">
<text>Keepie uppie, keep-ups or kick-ups is the skill of juggling with an association football using feet, lower legs, knees, chest, shoulders, and head, without allowing the ball to hit the ground. It is similar to Kemari, a game formerly practiced in the Japanese imperial court.

==World records==

The record for the longest keepie uppie is 28 hours using just feet, legs, shoulders and head; Victor Ericsson completed the feat, which took place in Sweden, in June 2023. The previous men&#x27;s record was held by Martinho Eduardo Orige of Brazil who kept a regulation football in the air for 19 hours and 30 minutes using only the head, feet and legs. The feat was accomplished on 2 and 3 August 2003.

The fastest completed marathon while ball-juggling was by Abraham Muñoz in the México City Marathon, August 2016. He completed the distance of in 5 hours 41 minutes 52 seconds, without the ball ever touching the ground.

Dan Magness, holder of the longest keepie-uppie, is also the holder of the longest distance gone while doing keepie-uppie. He managed to go without letting the ball touch the ground. He achieved this feat on 26 January 2010 in London and in the process visited all the stadiums of the five Premier League teams in London. He started his journey at Fulham F.C.&#x27;s Craven Cottage and ended it at Tottenham Hotspur F.C.&#x27;s White Hart Lane.

Thomas Ruiz holds the world record for the longest distance covered in one hour while juggling a football ball. He achieved this distance on 30 August 2020, in Saline, Michigan, United States, when he travelled while keeping the ball off the ground.

In 2020, Imogen Papworth-Heidel set herself the goal of achieving 7.1 million touches, one for every essential worker in the UK and performed 1,123,586 over 195 days to raise money for charities. The remaining 5,976,414 touches were &quot;donated&quot; by roughly 2,000 people sending in videos, including professional football players from Manchester United F.C.

The most touches of a football in 60 seconds, while keeping the ball in the air, is 274 by Isaac Wood of Australia, set on 25 October 2017 in Melbourne, Australia.

==In football games==

One of the more famous displays of keepie-uppie was in the 1967 Scotland–England football match, where Scottish midfielder Jim Baxter juggled the ball for some time in front of the English defence, taunting them by keeping possession. This allowed Scotland to keep possession and use up the remaining few minutes, leading to a 3–2 victory for Scotland over the world champions. &quot;That&#x27;s a defining moment for almost every football fan in Scotland irrespective of where their club allegiance lies,&quot; said football historian Bob Crampsey.

<text>Components of an electrical circuit are electrically connected if an electric current can run between them through an electrical conductor. An electrical connector is an electromechanical device used to create an electrical connection between parts of an electrical circuit, or between different electrical circuits, thereby joining them into a larger circuit.

The connection may be removable (as for portable equipment), require a tool for assembly and removal, or serve as a permanent electrical joint between two points. An adapter can be used to join dissimilar connectors. Most electrical connectors have a genderi.e. the male component, called a &quot;plug&quot;, connects to the female component, or &quot;socket&quot;.

Thousands of configurations of connectors are manufactured for power, data, and audiovisual applications. Electrical connectors can be divided into four basic categories, differentiated by their function:
* &quot;inline&quot; or &quot;cable&quot; connectors permanently attached to a cable, so it can be plugged into another terminal (either a stationary instrument or another cable)
* &quot;Chassis&quot; or &quot;panel&quot; connectors permanently attached to a piece of equipment so users can connect a cable to a stationary device
* &quot;PCB mount&quot; connectors soldered to a printed circuit board, providing a point for cable or wire attachment. (e.g. pin headers, screw terminals, board-to-board connectors)
* &quot;Splice&quot; or &quot;butt&quot; connectors (primarily insulation displacement connectors) that permanently join two lengths of wire or cable

In computing, electrical connectors are considered a physical interface and constitute part of the physical layer in the OSI model of networking.

==Physical construction==
In addition to the classes mentioned above, connectors are characterised by their pinout, method of connection, materials, size, contact resistance, insulation, mechanical durability, ingress protection, lifetime (number of cycles), and ease of use.

It is usually desirable for a connector to be easy to identify visually, rapid to assemble, inexpensive, and require only simple tooling. In some cases an equipment manufacturer might choose a connector specifically because it is &quot;not&quot; compatible with those from other sources, allowing control of what may be connected. No single connector has all the ideal properties for every application; the proliferation of types is a result of the diverse yet specific requirements of manufacturers.

===Materials===
Electrical connectors essentially consist of two classes of materials: conductors and insulators. Properties important to conductor materials are contact resistance, conductivity, mechanical strength, formability, and resilience. Insulators must have a high electrical resistance, withstand high temperatures, and be easy to manufacture for a precise fit

Electrodes in connectors are usually made of copper alloys, due to their good conductivity and malleability. Alternatives include brass, phosphor bronze, and beryllium copper. The base electrode metal is often coated with another inert metal such as gold, nickel, or tin. The use of a coating material with good conductivity, mechanical robustness and corrosion resistance helps to reduce the influence of passivating oxide layers and surface adsorbates, which limit metal-to-metal contact patches and contribute to contact resistance. For example, copper alloys have favorable mechanical properties for electrodes, but are hard to solder and prone to corrosion. Thus, copper pins are usually coated with gold to alleviate these pitfalls, especially for analog signals and high-reliability applications.

Contact &quot;carriers&quot; that hold the parts of a connector together are usually made of plastic, due to its insulating properties. &quot;Housings&quot; or &quot;backshells&quot; can be made of molded plastic and metal. Connector bodies for high-temperature use, such as thermocouples or associated with large incandescent lamps, may be made of fired ceramic material.

===Failure modes===

The majority of connector failures result in intermittent connections or open contacts:

Connectors are purely passive componentsthat is, they do not enhance the function of a circuitso connectors should affect the function of a circuit as little as possible. Insecure mounting of connectors (primarily chassis-mounted) can contribute significantly to the risk of failure, especially when subjected to extreme shock or vibration. Other causes of failure are connectors inadequately rated for the applied current and voltage, connectors with inadequate ingress protection, and threaded backshells that are worn or damaged.

High temperatures can also cause failure in connectors, resulting in an &quot;avalanche&quot; of failuresambient temperature increases, leading to a decrease in insulation resistance and increase in conductor resistance; this increase generates more heat, and the cycle repeats.

Fretting (so-called &quot;dynamic corrosion&quot;) is a common failure mode in electrical connectors that have not been specifically designed to prevent it, especially in those that are frequently mated and de-mated. Surface corrosion is a risk for many metal parts in connectors, and can cause contacts to form a thin surface layer that increases resistance, thus contributing to heat buildup and intermittent connections. However, remating or reseating a connector can alleviate the issue of surface corrosion, since each cycle scrapes a microscopic layer off the surface of the contact(s), exposing a fresh, unoxidised surface.

===Circular connectors===
Many connectors used for industrial and high-reliability applications are circular in cross section, with a cylindrical housing and circular contact interface geometries. This is in contrast to the rectangular design of some connectors, e.g. USB or blade connectors. They are commonly used for easier engagement and disengagement, tight environmental sealing, and rugged mechanical performance. They are widely used in military, aerospace, industrial machinery, and rail, where MIL-DTL-5015 and MIL-DTL-38999 are commonly specified. Fields such as sound engineering and radio communication also use circular connectors, such as XLR and BNC. AC power plugs are also commonly circular, for example, Schuko plugs and IEC 60309.
The M12 connector, specified in IEC 61076-2-101, is a circular electrical plug/receptacle pair with 12mm OD mating threads, used in NMEA 2000, DeviceNet, IO-Link, some kinds of Industrial Ethernet, etc.

A disadvantage of the circular design is its inefficient use of panel space when used in arrays, when compared to rectangular connectors.

Circular connectors commonly use backshells, which provide physical and electromagnetic protection, whilst sometimes also providing a method for locking the connector into a receptacle. In some cases, this backshell provides a hermetic seal, or some degree of ingress protection, through the use of grommets, O-rings, or potting.

===Hybrid connectors===
Hybrid connectors allow the intermixing of many connector types, usually by way of a housing with inserts. These housings may also allow intermixing of electrical and non-electrical interfaces, examples of the latter being pneumatic line connectors, and optical fiber connectors. Because hybrid connectors are modular in nature, they tend to simplify assembly, repair, and future modifications. They also allow the creation of composite cable assemblies that can reduce equipment installation time by reducing the number of individual cable and connector assemblies.

==Mechanical features==

===Pin sequence===
Some connectors are designed such that certain pins make contact before others when inserted, and break first on disconnection. This is often used in power connectors to protect equipment, e.g. connecting safety ground first. It is also employed for digital signals, as a method to sequence connections properly in hot swapping.

===Keying===

Many connectors are keyed with some mechanical component (sometimes called a &quot;keyway&quot;), which prevents mating in an incorrect orientation. This can be used to prevent mechanical damage to connectors, from being jammed in at the wrong angle or into the wrong connector, or to prevent incompatible or dangerous electrical connections, such as plugging an audio cable into a power outlet. Keying also prevents otherwise symmetrical connectors from being connected in the wrong orientation or &quot;polarity&quot;. Keying is particularly important for situations where there are many similar connectors, such as in signal electronics. For instance, XLR connectors have a notch to ensure proper orientation, while Mini-DIN plugs have a plastic projection that fits into a corresponding hole in the socket (they also have a notched metal skirt to provide secondary keying).

===Locking mechanisms===
Some connector housings are designed with locking mechanisms to prevent inadvertent disconnection or poor environmental sealing. Locking mechanism designs include locking levers of various sorts, jackscrews, screw-in shells, push-pull connector, and toggle or bayonet systems. Some connectors, particularly those with large numbers of contacts, require high forces to connect and disconnect. Locking levers and jackscrews and screw-in shells for such connectors frequently serve both to retain the connector when connected and to provide the force needed for connection and disconnection. Depending on application requirements, housings with locking mechanisms may be tested under various environmental simulations that include physical shock and vibration, water spray, dust, etc. to ensure the integrity of the electrical connection and housing seals.

===Backshells===
Backshells are a common accessory for industrial and high-reliability connectors, especially circular connectors. Backshells typically protect the connector and/or cable from environmental or mechanical stress, or shield it from electromagnetic interference. Many types of backshells are available for different purposes, including various sizes, shapes, materials, and levels of protection. Backshells usually lock onto the cable with a clamp or moulded boot, and may be threaded for attachment to a mating receptacle. Backshells for military and aerospace use are regulated by SAE AS85049 within the USA.

===Hyperboloid contacts===
To deliver ensured signal stability in extreme environments, traditional pin and socket design may become inadequate. Hyperboloid contacts are designed to withstand more extreme physical demands, such as vibration and shock. They also require around 40% less insertion force as low as per contact,which extends the lifespan, and in some cases offers an alternative to zero insertion force connectors.

In a connector with hyperboloid contacts, each female contact has several equally spaced longitudinal wires twisted into a hyperbolic shape. These wires are highly resilient to strain, but still somewhat elastic, hence they essentially function as linear springs. As the male pin is inserted, axial wires in the socket half are deflected, wrapping themselves around the pin to provide a number of contact points. The internal wires that form the hyperboloid structure are usually anchored at each end by bending the tip into a groove or notch in the housing.

Whilst hyperboloid contacts may be the only option to make a reliable connection in some circumstances, they have the disadvantage of taking up greater volume in a connector, which can cause problems for high-density connectors. They are also significantly more expensive than traditional pin and socket contacts, which has limited their uptake since their invention in the 1920s by Wilhelm Harold Frederick. In the 1950s, Francois Bonhomme popularised hyperboloid contacts with his &quot;Hypertac&quot; connector, which was later acquired by Smiths Group. During the following decades, the connectors steadily gained popularity, and are still used for medical, industrial, military, aerospace, and rail applications (particularly trains in Europe).

===Pogo pins===
&quot;Pogo pin&quot; or &quot;spring loaded&quot; connectors are commonly used in consumer and industrial products, where mechanical resilience and ease of use are priorities. The connector consists of a barrel, a spring, and a plunger. They are in applications such as the MagSafe connector where a quick disconnect is desired for safety. Because they rely on spring pressure, not friction, they can be more durable and less damaging than traditional pin and socket design, leading to their use in in-circuit testing.

===Crown spring connectors===

Crown spring connectors are commonly used for higher current flows and industrial applications. They have a high number of contact points, which provides a more electrically reliable connection than traditional pin and socket connectors.

==Methods of connection==

Whilst technically inaccurate, electrical connectors can be viewed as a type of adapter to convert between two connection methods, which are permanently connected at one end and (usually) detachable at the other end. By definition, each end of this &quot;adapter&quot; has a different connection methode.g. the solder tabs on a male phone connector, and the male phone connector itself. In this example, the solder tabs connected to the cable represent the permanent connection, whilst the male connector portion interfaces with a female socket forming a detachable connection.

There are many ways of applying a connector to a cable or device. Some of these methods can be accomplished without specialized tools. Other methods, while requiring a special tool, can assemble connectors much faster and more reliably, and make repairs easier.

The number of times a connector can connect and disconnect with its counterpart while meeting all its specifications is termed as &quot;mating cycles&quot; and is an indirect measure of connector lifespan. The material used for connector contact, plating type and thickness is a major factor that determines the mating cycles.

===Plug and socket connectors===

Plug and socket connectors are usually made up of a male plug (typically pin contacts) and a female socket (typically receptacle contacts). Often, but not always, sockets are permanently fixed to a device as in a chassis connector , and plugs are attached to a cable. 

Plugs generally have one or more pins or prongs that are inserted into openings in the mating socket. The connection between the mating metal parts must be sufficiently tight to make a good electrical connection and complete the circuit. An alternative type of plug and socket connection uses hyperboloid contacts, which makes a more reliable electrical connection. When working with multi-pin connectors, it is helpful to have a pinout diagram to identify the wire or circuit node connected to each pin.

Some connector styles may combine pin and socket connection types in a single unit, referred to as a hermaphroditic connector. These connectors includes mating with both male and female aspects, involving complementary paired identical parts each containing both protrusions and indentations. These mating surfaces are mounted into identical fittings that freely mate with any other, without regard for gender (provided that the size and type match).

Sometimes both ends of a cable are terminated with the same gender of connector, as in many Ethernet patch cables. In other applications the two ends are terminated differently, either with male and female of the same connector (as in an extension cord), or with incompatible connectors, which is sometimes called an &quot;adapter cable&quot;.

Plugs and sockets are widely used in various connector systems including blade connectors, breadboards, XLR connectors, car power outlets, banana connectors, and phone connectors.

====Jacks and plugs====

A jack is a connector that installs on the surface of a bulkhead or enclosure, and mates with its reciprocal, the plug. According to the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, the stationary (more fixed) connector of a pair is classified as a &quot;jack&quot; (denoted J), usually attached to a piece of equipment as in a chassis-mount or panel-mount connector. The movable (less fixed) connector is classified as a &quot;plug&quot; (denoted P), designed to attach to a wire, cable or removable electrical assembly. This convention is currently defined in ASME Y14.44-2008, which supersedes IEEE 200-1975, which in turn derives from the long-withdrawn MIL-STD-16 (from the 1950s), highlighting the heritage of this connector naming convention. IEEE 315-1975 works alongside ASME Y14.44-2008 to define jacks and plugs.

The term &quot;jack&quot; occurs in several related terms:
* The registered jack or modular jack in RJ11, RJ45 and other similar connectors used for telecommunications and computer networking
* The telephone jack of manual telephone switchboards, which is the socket fitting the original telephone plug
* The phone jack common to many electronic applications in various configurations, sometimes referred to as a &quot;headphone jack&quot;
* The RCA jack, also known as a &quot;phono jack&quot;, common to consumer audiovisual electronics
* The EIAJ jack for consumer appliances requiring a power supply of less than 18.0 volts

===Crimp-on connectors===
Crimped connectors are a type of solderless connection, using mechanical friction and uniform deformation to secure a connector to a pre-stripped wire (usually stranded). Crimping is used in splice connectors, crimped multipin plugs and sockets, and crimped coaxial connectors. Crimping usually requires a specialised crimping tool, but the connectors are quick and easy to install and are a common alternative to solder connections or insulation displacement connectors. Effective crimp connections deform the metal of the connector past its yield point so that the compressed wire causes tension in the surrounding connector, and these forces counter each other to create a high degree of static friction. Due to the elastic element in crimped connections, they are highly resistant to vibration and thermal shock.

Crimped contacts are permanent (i.e. the connectors and wire ends cannot be reused).

Crimped plug-and-socket connectors can be classified as &quot;rear release&quot; or &quot;front release&quot;. This relates to the side of the connector where the pins are anchored:
* Front release contacts are released from the front (contact side) of the connector, and removed from the rear. The removal tool engages with the front portion of the contact and pushes it through to the back of the connector.
* Rear release contacts are released and removed from the rear (wire side) of the connector. The removal tool releases the contacts from the rear and pulls the contact out of the retainer.

===Soldered connectors===

Many plug and socket connectors are attached to a wire or cable by soldering conductors to electrodes on the back of the connector. Soldered joints in connectors are robust and reliable if executed correctly, but are usually slower to make than crimped connections. When wires are to be soldered to the back of a connector, a backshell is often used to protect the connection and add strain relief. Metal &quot;solder buckets&quot; or &quot;solder cups&quot; are provided, which consist of a cylindrical cavity that an installer fills with solder before inserting the wire.

When creating soldered connections, it is possible to melt the dielectric between pins or wires. This can cause problems because the thermal conductivity of metals causes heat to quickly distribute through the cable and connector, and when this heat melts plastic dielectric, it can cause short circuits or &quot;flared&quot; (conical) insulation. Solder joints are also more prone to mechanical failure than crimped joints when subjected to vibration and compression.

===Insulation-displacement connectors===

Since stripping insulation from wires is time-consuming, many connectors intended for rapid assembly use insulation-displacement connectors which cut the insulation as the wire is inserted. These generally take the form of a fork-shaped opening in the terminal, into which the insulated wire is pressed, which cut through the insulation to contact the conductor. To make these connections reliably on a production line, special tools accurately control the forces applied during assembly. On small scales, these tools tend to cost more than tools for crimped connections.

Insulation displacement connectors are usually used with small conductors for signal purposes and at low voltage. Power conductors carrying more than a few amperes are more reliably terminated with other means, though &quot;hot tap&quot; press-on connectors find some use in automotive applications for additions to existing wiring.

A common example is the multi-conductor flat ribbon cable used in computer disk drives; to terminate each of the many (approximately 40) wires individually would be slow and error-prone, but an insulation displacement connector can terminate all the wires in a single action. Another very common use is so-called punch-down blocks used for terminating unshielded twisted pair wiring.

===Binding posts===

Binding posts are a single-wire connection method, where stripped wire is screwed or clamped to a metal electrode. Such connectors are frequently used in electronic test equipment and audio. Many binding posts also accept a banana plug.

===Screw terminals===

Screw connections are frequently used for semi-permanent wiring and connections inside devices, due to their simple but reliable construction. The basic principle of all screw terminals involves the tip of a bolt clamping onto a stripped conductor. They can be used to join multiple conductors, to connect wires to a printed circuit board, or to terminate a cable into a plug or socket. The clamping screw may act in the longitudinal axis (parallel to the wire) or the transverse axis (perpendicular to the wire), or both. Some disadvantages are that connecting wires is more difficult than simply plugging in a cable, and screw terminals are generally not very well protected from contact with persons or foreign conducting materials.
Terminal blocks (also called terminal &quot;boards&quot; or &quot;strips&quot;) provide a convenient means of connecting individual electrical wires without a splice or physically joining the ends. Since terminal blocks are readily available for a wide range of wire sizes and terminal quantity, they are one of the most flexible types of electrical connector available. One type of terminal block accepts wires that are prepared only by stripping a short length of insulation from the end. Another type, often called &quot;barrier strips&quot;, accepts wires that have ring or spade terminal &quot;lugs&quot; crimped onto the wires.

Printed circuit board (PCB) mounted screw terminals let individual wires connect to a PCB through leads soldered to the board.

===Ring and spade connectors===

The connectors in the top row of the image are known as ring terminals and spade terminals (sometimes called fork or split ring terminals). Electrical contact is made by the flat surface of the ring or spade, while mechanically they are attached by passing a screw or bolt through them. The spade terminal form factor facilitates connections since the screw or bolt can be left partially screwed in as the spade terminal is removed or attached. Their sizes can be determined by the gauge of the conducting wire, and the interior and exterior diameters.

In the case of insulated crimp connectors, the crimped area lies under an insulating sleeve through which the pressing force acts. During crimping, the extended end of this insulating sleeve is simultaneously pressed around the insulated area of the cable, creating strain relief. The insulating sleeve of insulated connectors has a color that indicates the wire&#x27;s cross-section area. Colors are standardized according to DIN 46245:

* Red for cross-section areas from 0.5 to 1 mm²
* Blue for cross-section areas from 1.5 to 2.5 mm²
* Yellow for cross-section areas over 4 to 6 mm²

===Blade connectors===
A blade connector is a type of single wire, plug-and-socket connection device using a flat conductive blade (plug) that is inserted into a receptacle. Wires are typically attached to male or female blade connector terminals by either crimping or soldering. Insulated and uninsulated varieties are available. In some cases the blade is an integral manufactured part of a component (such as a switch or a speaker unit), and the reciprocal connector terminal is pushed onto the device&#x27;s connector terminal.

===Other connection methods===
* Alligator and Crocodile clips – conductive clamps used for temporary connections, e.g. jumper cables
* Board to board connectors – e.g. card-edge connectors or FPGA mezzanine connectors
* Twist-on wire connectors (e.g. wire nuts) – used in low-voltage power circuits for wires up to about 10 AWG
* Wire wrapping – used in older circuit boards

<text>Diepholz () is a district in Lower Saxony, Germany. It is bounded by (from the northeast and clockwise) the districts of Verden, Nienburg, Minden-Lübbecke (in North Rhine-Westphalia), Osnabrück, Vechta and Oldenburg, and by the cities of Delmenhorst and Bremen. The most populous municipality is Stuhr at the border to Bremen.

== History ==
From the 12th century to 1585 Diepholz was a sovereign Noble Lordship, later County, within the Holy Roman Empire that was ruled over by the Noble Lords, later Counts, of Diepholz. At the beginning of the 16th century there was great pressure from the powerful duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg, which tried to annex the smaller states. By forming an alliance with the neighbouring County of Hoya and asking for help from the emperor himself the state of Diepholz managed to survive some more decades. In 1585 the ruling family became extinct, and Diepholz was eventually annexed by Brunswick-Lüneburg.

In 1932, the district of Grafschaft Diepholz (County of Diepholz) was established by merging the former districts of Diepholz and Sulingen. The former district of Diepholz was roughly identical to the medieval state, while the Sulingen district had been a part of the County of Hoya.

The present district of Diepholz was formed in 1977 by merging the former district of Grafschaft Diepholz (County of Diepholz) with parts of the former district of Grafschaft Hoya (County of Hoya), while the town Hoya itself became part of the district Nienburg.

== Geography ==
The district extends from the southern outskirts of Bremen to the border of North Rhine-Westphalia. In the south there is the Dümmer, a lake with an area of 16 km2, which is surrounded by fens. Many rare bird species breed in the reeds around the lake. The northern portions of the district are occupied by forests and agricultural lands.

== Coat of arms ==

The lion is taken from the original arms of the Count of Diepholz. The bear claws are from the arms of Count of Hoya. This combination symbolizes the merger of County of Diepholz and County of Hoya in 1977.

<doc id="152659" wikidata="Q11945494" url="?curid=152659" title="Ribagorça">
<text>Ribagorça () or Ribagorza (, ; ) is a historical and natural region of Aragon and Catalonia. Located in the Pre-Pyrenees and Pyrenees area, most of its territory is mountainous. The region has been steadily losing population since mid 20th century.

The Noguera Ribagorçana river is named after this region.

==Geography==
The region is located south of the French border with the Pallars in the east and the Sobrarbe in the west.
The physiography of the Ribagorça natural region includes the Ésera, Isábena and Noguera Ribagorçana river basins with their tributaries. The region also encompasses the mountain ranges spanning the Pyrenees and Pre-Pyrenees area that surrounds the basins of these south-flowing rivers.
===Municipalities===
The traditional capital of the region was Benabarre (); according to the 2014 census, the municipality has a population of 1,153 inhabitants. In present times, however, the most important town of the Ribagorça is Graus with a population of 3,429 in 2014.

===Present-day administrative divisions===

====Ribagorza/Ribagorça====

Ribagorza/Ribagorça is a comarca of Aragon established in 2002. It forms the northeastern part of Huesca Province. It borders the French &quot;département&quot; of the Haute-Garonne to the north, the Aran Valley, Alta Ribagorça, Pallars Jussà, and Noguera to the east, Sobrarbe to the west, as well as Somontano de Barbastro and La Litera/La Llitera to the south. The territory of the modern Aragonese comarca was traditionally known as &quot;Baixa Ribagorça&quot; in Catalan.

====Alta Ribagorça====

Present-day Alta Ribagorça is one of the &quot;comarques&quot; of Catalonia. Its capital is Pont de Suert. Other municipalities are Vall de Boí and Vilaller.

==History==

The County of Ribagorça was a historic county with its own dynasty between 872 and 1017. It became a county of the Kingdom of Aragon from 1018 to 1322, year in which it was joined to Aragon as an appanage or estate. Ribagorça became part of the Spanish Crown in 1591 under Philip II.

==Linguistics==
Ribagorçan (&quot;ribagorzano&quot;, &quot;ribagorsano&quot;) is a transitional Aragonese and Catalan dialect spoken in the area of Aragon and Catalan Ribagorçan (&quot;ribagorçà&quot;) is a Catalan dialect spoken in the Alta Ribagorça, Catalonia. Speakers of Pont de Suert use a Catalan variant transitional to Aragonese with some traits of Aranese Occitan. However, Aragonese and Catalan form a dialectal continuum in the region and it is not possible to draw the geographical limit of both languages in a clear-cut manner.

<text>Nienburg () is a district (&quot;Landkreis&quot;) in Lower Saxony, Germany. It is bounded by (from the west and clockwise) the districts of Diepholz, Verden, Heidekreis, Hanover and Schaumburg, and by the state of North Rhine-Westphalia (district of Minden-Lübbecke).

==History==

From the early Middle Ages to the end of the 16th century this region was the heart of the County of Hoya. The ruling family became extinct in 1582, and the central and southern parts of the county were annexed by the Lüneburg branch of the duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg. In 1705 the area of Nienburg and Hoya became subordinate to Hanover.

In 1866 the Kingdom of Hanover was annexed by Prussia. The Prussian government established the districts of Nienburg and Stolzenau, which were merged in 1932.

The earliest official mention of Nienburg/Weser dates from the year 1025, when Milo, the Canon of Minden, apparently made a gift of his property in Nienburg to the Minden church. Since this early mention spoke of Nienburg (= new castle), some kind sort of fortress must already have existed there for some time, perhaps in order to protect the crossing of the Weser. Under the protection of this fortress the initially insecure settlement became permanent, and was first officially referred to a &quot;civitas&quot; (a town) in 1215.

The castle and the town of Nienburg were the seat of the Counts of Hoya, from whom the citizenry and guilds managed to extract many privileges. When the line of the Counts of Hoya died out in 1582, their property became the line of the Guelphic Dukes of Braunschweig-Lüneburg. Nienburg then remained under the Guelphs until 1866, with a short interruption from 1803 to 1813, when it was annexed by the French. Today only the &quot;Stockturm&quot; remains as a visible reminder of the many centuries of the Middle-Ages history of the town, when the fortress town of Nienburg stood guard over the main Weser crossing between Minden and Bremen. The sarcophagus of the last Count of Hoya, Otto VII, and his wife Agnes von Bentheim, and that of the most important Count in the history of the town, Jobst II (died 1545) and his wife Anna von Gleichen, are both to be found in the &quot;Turmhalle-Martinskirche&quot;. The emblem of the war - like Counts of Hoya - a black bear-paw - still appears today in certificates and documents, and has also been taken over in the arms and seal of the town. The blue lion in the arms of the town refers to the Princes of Guelph who first ruled over the area through the Dukes of Braunschweig-Lüneburg, and then the Electors and later Kings of Hannover until the Kingdom of the Guelphs became a province of Prussia in 1866. The 16th century was the time of the Reformation, which was concluded in the year 1581 by the decree of the Hoya Church. During the 30 Years&#x27; War the town was besieged and destroyed. In 1625 the town was successfully defended by the &quot;Reformed&#x27; forces against the army of General Tilly. From those times the legend of the &quot;Wähligen Rott&quot; derives, a band of defenders who sortied from the town and took a banner and other great booty from Tilly&#x27;s besieging forces a tent. The banner and the tents are still displayed today at the annual &quot;Scheibenschießen&quot; (shooting tournament), a local festival with a tradition of over 600 years. By the end of the 30 Years War, two-thirds of the town were in ruins. Years of rapid reconstruction now took place; during the Seven Years&#x27; War, however, the town again suffered substantial damage, when the French army occupied it in 1757. At the beginning of the 19th century the town of Nienburg had to look after the accommodation of Napoleonic troops, sometimes up to 18,000 men all at once. At that time, an important event for the future development of the town took place: the demolition of the Middle-Ages fortifications. The years of peace after 1815 comprised a period of growth, during which the town could then expand rapidly. The overcoming of the destructions of the Second World War allowed Nienburg to enjoy a dramatic upturn in its fortunes. With its population of around 33,000 people, the town of Nienburg/Weser is today the economic and cultural centre of the otherwise empty area between the two major conurbations of Hannover and Bremen.

==Geography==

The district is roughly located between Bremen and Hanover. The Weser River enters the district in the south, coming from North Rhine-Westphalia, and runs north towards Bremen.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms displays:
* two horses on piles, a typical decoration of farms in the region

<doc id="152664" wikidata="Q739962" url="?curid=152664" title="Loop quantum gravity">
<text>Loop quantum gravity (LQG) is a theory of quantum gravity that incorporates matter of the Standard Model into the framework established for the intrinsic quantum gravity case. It is an attempt to develop a quantum theory of gravity based directly on Albert Einstein&#x27;s geometric formulation rather than the treatment of gravity as a mysterious mechanism (force). As a theory, LQG postulates that the structure of space and time is composed of finite loops woven into an extremely fine fabric or network. These networks of loops are called spin networks. The evolution of a spin network, or spin foam, has a scale on the order of a Planck length, approximately 10−35 meters, and smaller scales are meaningless. Consequently, not just matter, but space itself, prefers an atomic structure.

The areas of research, which involve about 30 research groups worldwide, share the basic physical assumptions and the mathematical description of quantum space. Research has evolved in two directions: the more traditional canonical loop quantum gravity, and the newer covariant loop quantum gravity, called spin foam theory. The most well-developed theory that has been advanced as a direct result of loop quantum gravity is called loop quantum cosmology (LQC). LQC advances the study of the early universe, incorporating the concept of the Big Bang into the broader theory of the Big Bounce, which envisions the Big Bang as the beginning of a period of expansion, that follows a period of contraction, which has been described as the Big Crunch.

== History ==
In 1986, Abhay Ashtekar reformulated Einstein&#x27;s general relativity in a language closer to that of the rest of fundamental physics, specifically Yang–Mills theory. Shortly after, Ted Jacobson and Lee Smolin realized that the formal equation of quantum gravity, called the Wheeler–DeWitt equation, admitted solutions labelled by loops when rewritten in the new Ashtekar variables. Carlo Rovelli and Smolin defined a nonperturbative and background-independent quantum theory of gravity in terms of these loop solutions. Jorge Pullin and Jerzy Lewandowski understood that the intersections of the loops are essential for the consistency of the theory, and the theory should be formulated in terms of intersecting loops, or graphs.

In 1994, Rovelli and Smolin showed that the quantum operators of the theory associated to area and volume have a discrete spectrum. That is, geometry is quantized. This result defines an explicit basis of states of quantum geometry, which turned out to be labelled by Roger Penrose&#x27;s spin networks, which are graphs labelled by spins.

The canonical version of the dynamics was established by Thomas Thiemann, who defined an anomaly-free Hamiltonian operator and showed the existence of a mathematically consistent background-independent theory. The covariant, or &quot;spin foam&quot;, version of the dynamics was developed jointly over several decades by research groups in France, Canada, UK, Poland, and Germany. It was completed in 2008, leading to the definition of a family of transition amplitudes, which in the classical limit can be shown to be related to a family of truncations of general relativity. The finiteness of these amplitudes was proven in 2011. It requires the existence of a positive cosmological constant, which is consistent with observed acceleration in the expansion of the Universe.

== Background independence ==
LQG is formally background independent, meaning the equations of LQG are not embedded in, or dependent on, space and time (except for its invariant topology). Instead, they are expected to give rise to space and time at distances which are 10 times the Planck length. The issue of background independence in LQG still has some unresolved subtleties. For example, some derivations require a fixed choice of the topology, while any consistent quantum theory of gravity should include topology change as a dynamical process.

Spacetime as a &quot;container&quot; over which physics takes place has no objective physical meaning and instead the gravitational interaction is represented as just one of the fields forming the world. This is known as the relationalist interpretation of spacetime. In LQG this aspect of general relativity is taken seriously and this symmetry is preserved by requiring that the physical states remain invariant under the generators of diffeomorphisms. The interpretation of this condition is well understood for purely spatial diffeomorphisms. However, the understanding of diffeomorphisms involving time (the Hamiltonian constraint) is more subtle because it is related to dynamics and the so-called &quot;problem of time&quot; in general relativity. A generally accepted calculational framework to account for this constraint has yet to be found. A plausible candidate for the quantum Hamiltonian constraint is the operator introduced by Thiemann.

== Constraints and their Poisson bracket algebra ==
=== Dirac observables ===
The constraints define a constraint surface in the original phase space. The gauge motions of the constraints apply to all phase space but have the feature that they leave the constraint surface where it is, and thus the orbit of a point in the hypersurface under gauge transformations will be an orbit entirely within it. Dirac observables are defined as phase space functions, formula_1, that Poisson commute with all the constraints when the constraint equations are imposed,

:formula_2

that is, they are quantities defined on the constraint surface that are invariant under the gauge transformations of the theory.

Then, solving only the constraint formula_3 and determining the Dirac observables with respect to it leads us back to the Arnowitt–Deser–Misner (ADM) phase space with constraints formula_4. The dynamics of general relativity is generated by the constraints, it can be shown that six Einstein equations describing time evolution (really a gauge transformation) can be obtained by calculating the Poisson brackets of the three-metric and its conjugate momentum with a linear combination of the spatial diffeomorphism and Hamiltonian constraint. The vanishing of the constraints, giving the physical phase space, are the four other Einstein equations.

== Quantization of the constraints – the equations of quantum general relativity ==
=== Pre-history and Ashtekar new variables ===

Many of the technical problems in canonical quantum gravity revolve around the constraints. Canonical general relativity was originally formulated in terms of metric variables, but there seemed to be insurmountable mathematical difficulties in promoting the constraints to quantum operators because of their highly non-linear dependence on the canonical variables. The equations were much simplified with the introduction of Ashtekar&#x27;s new variables. Ashtekar variables describe canonical general relativity in terms of a new pair of canonical variables closer to those of gauge theories. The first step consists of using densitized triads formula_5 (a triad formula_6 is simply three orthogonal vector fields labeled by formula_7 and the densitized triad is defined by formula_8) to encode information about the spatial metric,

:formula_9

(where formula_10 is the flat space metric, and the above equation expresses that formula_11, when written in terms of the basis formula_6, is locally flat). (Formulating general relativity with triads instead of metrics was not new.) The densitized triads are not unique, and in fact one can perform a local in space rotation with respect to the internal indices formula_13. The canonically conjugate variable is related to the extrinsic curvature by formula_14. But problems similar to using the metric formulation arise when one tries to quantize the theory. Ashtekar&#x27;s new insight was to introduce a new configuration variable,

formula_15

that behaves as a complex formula_16 connection where formula_17 is related to the so-called spin connection via formula_18. Here formula_19 is called the chiral spin connection. It defines a covariant derivative formula_20. It turns out that formula_21 is the conjugate momentum of formula_19, and together these form Ashtekar&#x27;s new variables.

The expressions for the constraints in Ashtekar variables; Gauss&#x27;s theorem, the spatial diffeomorphism constraint and the (densitized) Hamiltonian constraint then read:

:formula_23

:formula_24

:formula_25

respectively, where formula_26 is the field strength tensor of the connection formula_19 and where formula_28 is referred to as the vector constraint. The above-mentioned local in space rotational invariance is the original of the formula_16 gauge invariance here expressed by Gauss&#x27;s theorem. Note that these constraints are polynomial in the fundamental variables, unlike the constraints in the metric formulation. This dramatic simplification seemed to open up the way to quantizing the constraints. (See the article Self-dual Palatini action for a derivation of Ashtekar&#x27;s formalism).

With Ashtekar&#x27;s new variables, given the configuration variable formula_30, it is natural to consider wavefunctions formula_31. This is the connection representation. It is analogous to ordinary quantum mechanics with configuration variable formula_32 and wavefunctions formula_33. The configuration variable gets promoted to a quantum operator via:

:formula_34

(analogous to formula_35) and the triads are (functional) derivatives,

:formula_36

(analogous to formula_37). In passing over to the quantum theory the constraints become operators on a kinematic Hilbert space (the unconstrained formula_16 Yang–Mills Hilbert space). Note that different ordering of the formula_39&#x27;s and formula_40&#x27;s when replacing the formula_40&#x27;s with derivatives give rise to different operators – the choice made is called the factor ordering and should be chosen via physical reasoning. Formally they read

:formula_42

:formula_43

:formula_44

There are still problems in properly defining all these equations and solving them. For example, the Hamiltonian constraint Ashtekar worked with was the densitized version instead of the original Hamiltonian, that is, he worked with formula_45. There were serious difficulties in promoting this quantity to a quantum operator. Moreover, although Ashtekar variables had the virtue of simplifying the Hamiltonian, they are complex. When one quantizes the theory, it is difficult to ensure that one recovers real general relativity as opposed to complex general relativity.

=== Quantum constraints as the equations of quantum general relativity ===
The classical result of the Poisson bracket of the smeared Gauss&#x27; law formula_46 with the connections is

:formula_47

The quantum Gauss&#x27; law reads

:formula_48

If one smears the quantum Gauss&#x27; law and study its action on the quantum state one finds that the action of the constraint on the quantum state is equivalent to shifting the argument of formula_49 by an infinitesimal (in the sense of the parameter formula_50 small) gauge transformation,

:formula_51

and the last identity comes from the fact that the constraint annihilates the state. So the constraint, as a quantum operator, is imposing the same symmetry that its vanishing imposed classically: it is telling us that the functions formula_52 have to be gauge invariant functions of the connection. The same idea is true for the other constraints.

Therefore, the two step process in the classical theory of solving the constraints formula_53 (equivalent to solving the admissibility conditions for the initial data) and looking for the gauge orbits (solving the &#x27;evolution&#x27; equations) is replaced by a one step process in the quantum theory, namely looking for solutions formula_49 of the quantum equations formula_55. This is because it solves the constraint at the quantum level and it simultaneously looks for states that are gauge invariant because formula_56 is the quantum generator of gauge transformations (gauge invariant functions are constant along the gauge orbits and thus characterize them). Recall that, at the classical level, solving the admissibility conditions and evolution equations was equivalent to solving all of Einstein&#x27;s field equations, this underlines the central role of the quantum constraint equations in canonical quantum gravity.

=== Introduction of the loop representation ===

It was in particular the inability to have good control over the space of solutions to Gauss&#x27;s law and spatial diffeomorphism constraints that led Rovelli and Smolin to consider the loop representation in gauge theories and quantum gravity.

LQG includes the concept of a holonomy. A holonomy is a measure of how much the initial and final values of a spinor or vector differ after parallel transport around a closed loop; it is denoted

:formula_57.

Knowledge of the holonomies is equivalent to knowledge of the connection, up to gauge equivalence. Holonomies can also be associated with an edge; under a Gauss Law these transform as

:formula_58

For a closed loop formula_59 and assuming formula_60, yields

:formula_61

or

:formula_62

The trace of an holonomy around a closed loop is written

:formula_63

and is called a Wilson loop. Thus Wilson loops are gauge invariant. The explicit form of the Holonomy is

:formula_64

where formula_65 is the curve along which the holonomy is evaluated, and formula_66 is a parameter along the curve, formula_67 denotes path ordering meaning factors for smaller values of formula_66 appear to the left, and formula_69 are matrices that satisfy the formula_16 algebra

:formula_71

The Pauli matrices satisfy the above relation. It turns out that there are infinitely many more examples of sets of matrices that satisfy these relations, where each set comprises formula_72 matrices with formula_73, and where none of these can be thought to &#x27;decompose&#x27; into two or more examples of lower dimension. They are called different irreducible representations of the formula_16 algebra. The most fundamental representation being the Pauli matrices. The holonomy is labelled by a half integer formula_75 according to the irreducible representation used.

The use of Wilson loops explicitly solves the Gauss gauge constraint. Loop representation is required to handle the spatial diffeomorphism constraint. With Wilson loops as a basis, any Gauss gauge invariant function expands as,

:formula_76

This is called the loop transform and is analogous to the momentum representation in quantum mechanics (see Position and momentum space). The QM representation has a basis of states formula_77 labelled by a number formula_78 and expands as

:formula_79

and works with the coefficients of the expansion formula_80

The inverse loop transform is defined by

:formula_81

This defines the loop representation. Given an operator formula_82 in the connection representation,

:formula_83

one should define the corresponding operator formula_84 on formula_85 in the loop representation via,

:formula_86

where formula_87 is defined by the usual inverse loop transform,

:formula_88

A transformation formula giving the action of the operator formula_84 on formula_85 in terms of the action of the operator formula_82 on formula_52 is then obtained by equating the R.H.S. of formula_93 with the R.H.S. of formula_94 with formula_95 substituted into formula_94, namely

:formula_97

or

:formula_98

where formula_99 means the operator formula_82 but with the reverse factor ordering (remember from simple quantum mechanics where the product of operators is reversed under conjugation). The action of this operator on the Wilson loop is evaluated as a calculation in the connection representation and the result is rearranged purely as a manipulation in terms of loops (with regard to the action on the Wilson loop, the chosen transformed operator is the one with the opposite factor ordering compared to the one used for its action on wavefunctions formula_52). This gives the physical meaning of the operator formula_84. For example, if formula_103 corresponded to a spatial diffeomorphism, then this can be thought of as keeping the connection field formula_39 of formula_63 where it is while performing a spatial diffeomorphism on formula_65 instead. Therefore, the meaning of formula_84 is a spatial diffeomorphism on formula_65, the argument of formula_85.

In the loop representation, the spatial diffeomorphism constraint is solved by considering functions of loops formula_85 that are invariant under spatial diffeomorphisms of the loop formula_65. That is, knot invariants are used. This opens up an unexpected connection between knot theory and quantum gravity.

Any collection of non-intersecting Wilson loops satisfy Ashtekar&#x27;s quantum Hamiltonian constraint. Using a particular ordering of terms and replacing formula_21 by a derivative, the action of the quantum Hamiltonian constraint on a Wilson loop is

:formula_113

When a derivative is taken it brings down the tangent vector, formula_114, of the loop, formula_65. So,

:formula_116

However, as formula_26 is anti-symmetric in the indices formula_118 and formula_119 this vanishes (this assumes that formula_65 is not discontinuous anywhere and so the tangent vector is unique).

With regard to loop representation, the wavefunctions formula_85 vanish when the loop has discontinuities and are knot invariants. Such functions solve the Gauss law, the spatial diffeomorphism constraint and (formally) the Hamiltonian constraint. This yields an infinite set of exact (if only formal) solutions to all the equations of quantum general relativity! This generated a lot of interest in the approach and eventually led to LQG.

=== Geometric operators, the need for intersecting Wilson loops and spin network states ===
The easiest geometric quantity is the area. Let us choose coordinates so that the surface formula_122 is characterized by formula_123. The area of small parallelogram of the surface formula_122 is the product of length of each side times formula_125 where formula_126 is the angle between the sides. Say one edge is given by the vector formula_127 and the other by formula_128 then,

:formula_129

In the space spanned by formula_130 and formula_131 there is an infinitesimal parallelogram described by formula_132 and formula_133. Using formula_134 (where the indices formula_39 and formula_136 run from 1 to 2), yields the area of the surface formula_122 given by

:formula_138

where formula_139 and is the determinant of the metric induced on formula_122. The latter can be rewritten formula_141 where the indices formula_142 go from 1 to 2. This can be further rewritten as

:formula_143

The standard formula for an inverse matrix is

:formula_144

There is a similarity between this and the expression for formula_145. But in Ashtekar variables, formula_146. Therefore,

:formula_147

According to the rules of canonical quantization the triads formula_148 should be promoted to quantum operators,

:formula_149

The area formula_150 can be promoted to a well defined quantum operator despite the fact that it contains a product of two functional derivatives and a square-root. Putting formula_151 (formula_152-th representation),

:formula_153

This quantity is important in the final formula for the area spectrum. The result is

:formula_154

where the sum is over all edges formula_155 of the Wilson loop that pierce the surface formula_122.

The formula for the volume of a region formula_157 is given by

:formula_158

The quantization of the volume proceeds the same way as with the area. Each time the derivative is taken, it brings down the tangent vector formula_114, and when the volume operator acts on non-intersecting Wilson loops the result vanishes. Quantum states with non-zero volume must therefore involve intersections. Given that the anti-symmetric summation is taken over in the formula for the volume, it needs intersections with at least three non-coplanar lines. At least four-valent vertices are needed for the volume operator to be non-vanishing.

Assuming the real representation where the gauge group is formula_16, Wilson loops are an over complete basis as there are identities relating different Wilson loops. These occur because Wilson loops are based on matrices (the holonomy) and these matrices satisfy identities. Given any two formula_16 matrices formula_162 and formula_163,

:formula_164

This implies that given two loops formula_65 and formula_166 that intersect,

formula_167

where by formula_168 we mean the loop formula_166 traversed in the opposite direction and formula_170 means the loop obtained by going around the loop formula_65 and then along formula_166. See figure below. Given that the matrices are unitary one has that formula_173. Also given the cyclic property of the matrix traces (i.e. formula_174) one has that formula_175. These identities can be combined with each other into further identities of increasing complexity adding more loops. These identities are the so-called Mandelstam identities. Spin networks certain are linear combinations of intersecting Wilson loops designed to address the over-completeness introduced by the Mandelstam identities (for trivalent intersections they eliminate the over-completeness entirely) and actually constitute a basis for all gauge invariant functions.

As mentioned above the holonomy tells one how to propagate test spin half particles. A spin network state assigns an amplitude to a set of spin half particles tracing out a path in space, merging and splitting. These are described by spin networks formula_65: the edges are labelled by spins together with &#x27;intertwiners&#x27; at the vertices which are prescription for how to sum over different ways the spins are rerouted. The sum over rerouting are chosen as such to make the form of the intertwiner invariant under Gauss gauge transformations.

=== Hamiltonian constraint of LQG ===
In the long history of canonical quantum gravity formulating the Hamiltonian constraint as a quantum operator (Wheeler–DeWitt equation) in a mathematically rigorous manner has been a formidable problem. It was in the loop representation that a mathematically well defined Hamiltonian constraint was finally formulated in 1996. We leave more details of its construction to the article Hamiltonian constraint of LQG. This together with the quantum versions of the Gauss law and spatial diffeomorphism constrains written in the loop representation are the central equations of LQG (modern canonical quantum General relativity).

Finding the states that are annihilated by these constraints (the physical states), and finding the corresponding physical inner product, and observables is the main goal of the technical side of LQG.

An important aspect of the Hamiltonian operator is that it only acts at vertices (a consequence of this is that Thiemann&#x27;s Hamiltonian operator, like Ashtekar&#x27;s operator, annihilates non-intersecting loops except now it is not just formal and has rigorous mathematical meaning). More precisely, its action is non-zero on at least vertices of valence three and greater and results in a linear combination of new spin networks where the original graph has been modified by the addition of lines at each vertex together and a change in the labels of the adjacent links of the vertex.

=== Chiral fermions and the fermion doubling problem ===
A significant challenge in theoretical physics lies in unifying LQG, a theory of quantum spacetime, with the Standard Model of particle physics, which describes fundamental forces and particles. A major obstacle in this endeavor is the fermion doubling problem, which arises when incorporating chiral fermions into the LQG framework.

Chiral fermions, such as electrons and quarks, are fundamental particles characterized by their &quot;handedness&quot; or chirality. This property dictates that a particle and its mirror image behave differently under weak interactions. This asymmetry is fundamental to the Standard Model&#x27;s success in explaining numerous physical phenomena.

However, attempts to integrate chiral fermions into LQG often result in the appearance of spurious, mirror-image particles. Instead of a single left-handed fermion, for instance, the theory predicts the existence of both a left-handed and a right-handed version. This &quot;doubling&quot; contradicts the observed chirality of the Standard Model and disrupts its predictive power. 

The fermion doubling problem poses a significant hurdle in constructing a consistent theory of quantum gravity. The Standard Model&#x27;s accuracy in describing the universe at the smallest scales relies heavily on the unique properties of chiral fermions. Without a solution to this problem, incorporating matter and its interactions into a unified framework of quantum gravity remains a significant challenge. 

Therefore, resolving the fermion doubling problem is crucial for advancing our understanding of the universe at its most fundamental level and developing a complete theory that unites gravity with the quantum world. 

== Spin foams ==

In loop quantum gravity (LQG), a spin network represents a &quot;quantum state&quot; of the gravitational field on a 3-dimensional hypersurface. The set of all possible spin networks (or, more accurately, &quot;s-knots&quot; – that is, equivalence classes of spin networks under diffeomorphisms) is countable; it constitutes a basis of LQG Hilbert space.

In physics, a spin foam is a topological structure made out of two-dimensional faces that represents one of the configurations that must be summed to obtain a Feynman&#x27;s path integral (functional integration) description of quantum gravity. It is closely related to loop quantum gravity.

=== Spin foam derived from the Hamiltonian constraint operator ===

On this section see and references therein. The Hamiltonian constraint generates &#x27;time&#x27; evolution. Solving the Hamiltonian constraint should tell us how quantum states evolve in &#x27;time&#x27; from an initial spin network state to a final spin network state. One approach to solving the Hamiltonian constraint starts with what is called the Dirac delta function. The summation of which over different sequences of actions can be visualized as a summation over different histories of &#x27;interaction vertices&#x27; in the &#x27;time&#x27; evolution sending the initial spin network to the final spin network. Each time a Hamiltonian operator acts it does so by adding a new edge at the vertex.

This then naturally gives rise to the two-complex (a combinatorial set of faces that join along edges, which in turn join on vertices) underlying the spin foam description; we evolve forward an initial spin network sweeping out a surface, the action of the Hamiltonian constraint operator is to produce a new planar surface starting at the vertex. We are able to use the action of the Hamiltonian constraint on the vertex of a spin network state to associate an amplitude to each &quot;interaction&quot; (in analogy to Feynman diagrams). See figure below. This opens a way of trying to directly link canonical LQG to a path integral description. Just as a spin networks describe quantum space, each configuration contributing to these path integrals, or sums over history, describe &#x27;quantum spacetime&#x27;. Because of their resemblance to soap foams and the way they are labeled John Baez gave these &#x27;quantum spacetimes&#x27; the name &#x27;spin foams&#x27;.

There are however severe difficulties with this particular approach, for example the Hamiltonian operator is not self-adjoint, in fact it is not even a normal operator (i.e. the operator does not commute with its adjoint) and so the spectral theorem cannot be used to define the exponential in general. The most serious problem is that the formula_177&#x27;s are not mutually commuting, it can then be shown the formal quantity formula_178 cannot even define a (generalized) projector. The master constraint (see below) does not suffer from these problems and as such offers a way of connecting the canonical theory to the path integral formulation.

=== Spin foams from BF theory ===
It turns out there are alternative routes to formulating the path integral, however their connection to the Hamiltonian formalism is less clear. One way is to start with the BF theory. This is a simpler theory than general relativity, it has no local degrees of freedom and as such depends only on topological aspects of the fields. BF theory is what is known as a topological field theory. Surprisingly, it turns out that general relativity can be obtained from BF theory by imposing a constraint, BF theory involves a field formula_179 and if one chooses the field formula_136 to be the (anti-symmetric) product of two tetrads

:formula_181

(tetrads are like triads but in four spacetime dimensions), one recovers general relativity. The condition that the formula_136 field be given by the product of two tetrads is called the simplicity constraint. The spin foam dynamics of the topological field theory is well understood. Given the spin foam &#x27;interaction&#x27; amplitudes for this simple theory, one then tries to implement the simplicity conditions to obtain a path integral for general relativity. The non-trivial task of constructing a spin foam model is then reduced to the question of how this simplicity constraint should be imposed in the quantum theory. The first attempt at this was the famous Barrett–Crane model. However this model was shown to be problematic, for example there did not seem to be enough degrees of freedom to ensure the correct classical limit. It has been argued that the simplicity constraint was imposed too strongly at the quantum level and should only be imposed in the sense of expectation values just as with the Lorenz gauge condition formula_183 in the Gupta–Bleuler formalism of quantum electrodynamics. New models have now been put forward, sometimes motivated by imposing the simplicity conditions in a weaker sense.

Another difficulty here is that spin foams are defined on a discretization of spacetime. While this presents no problems for a topological field theory as it has no local degrees of freedom, it presents problems for GR. This is known as the problem triangularization dependence.

=== Modern formulation of spin foams ===
Just as imposing the classical simplicity constraint recovers general relativity from BF theory, it is expected that an appropriate quantum simplicity constraint will recover quantum gravity from quantum BF theory.

Progress has been made with regard to this issue by Engle, Pereira, and Rovelli, Freidel and Krasnov and Livine and Speziale in defining spin foam interaction amplitudes with better behaviour.

An attempt to make contact between EPRL-FK spin foam and the canonical formulation of LQG has been made.

=== Spin foam derived from the master constraint operator ===
See below.

== The semiclassical limit and loop quantum gravity ==
The Classical limit is the ability of a physical theory to approximate classical mechanics. It is used with physical theories that predict non-classical behavior. Any candidate theory of quantum gravity must be able to reproduce Einstein&#x27;s theory of general relativity as a classical limit of a quantum theory. This is not guaranteed because of a feature of quantum field theories which is that they have different sectors, these are analogous to the different phases that come about in the thermodynamical limit of statistical systems. Just as different phases are physically different, so are different sectors of a quantum field theory. It may turn out that LQG belongs to an unphysical sector – one in which one does not recover general relativity in the semiclassical limit or there might not be any physical sector.

Moreover, the physical Hilbert space formula_184 must contain enough semiclassical states to guarantee that the quantum theory obtained can return to the classical theory when formula_185 avoiding quantum anomalies; otherwise there will be restrictions on the physical Hilbert space that have no counterpart in the classical theory, implying that the quantum theory has fewer degrees of freedom than the classical theory.

Theorems establishing the uniqueness of the loop representation as defined by Ashtekar et al. (i.e. a certain concrete realization of a Hilbert space and associated operators reproducing the correct loop algebra) have been given by two groups (Lewandowski, Okołów, Sahlmann and Thiemann; and Christian Fleischhack). Before this result was established it was not known whether there could be other examples of Hilbert spaces with operators invoking the same loop algebra – other realizations not equivalent to the one that had been used. These uniqueness theorems imply no others exist, so if LQG does not have the correct semiclassical limit then the theorems would mean the end of the loop representation of quantum gravity.

=== Difficulties and progress checking the semiclassical limit ===
There are a number of difficulties in trying to establish LQG gives Einstein&#x27;s theory of general relativity in the semiclassical limit:
# There is no operator corresponding to infinitesimal spatial diffeomorphisms (it is not surprising that the theory has no generator of infinitesimal spatial &#x27;translations&#x27; as it predicts spatial geometry has a discrete nature, compare to the situation in condensed matter). Instead it must be approximated by finite spatial diffeomorphisms and so the Poisson bracket structure of the classical theory is not exactly reproduced. This problem can be circumvented with the introduction of the so-called master constraint (see below).
# There is the problem of reconciling the discrete combinatorial nature of the quantum states with the continuous nature of the fields of the classical theory.
# There are serious difficulties arising from the structure of the Poisson brackets involving the spatial diffeomorphism and Hamiltonian constraints. In particular, the algebra of (smeared) Hamiltonian constraints does not close: It is proportional to a sum over infinitesimal spatial diffeomorphisms (which, as noted above, does not exist in the quantum theory) where the coefficients of proportionality are not constants but have non-trivial phase space dependence – as such it does not form a Lie algebra. However, the situation is improved by the introduction of the master constraint.
# The semiclassical machinery developed so far is only appropriate to non-graph-changing operators, however, Thiemann&#x27;s Hamiltonian constraint is a graph-changing operator – the new graph it generates has degrees of freedom upon which the coherent state does not depend and so their quantum fluctuations are not suppressed. There is also the restriction, so far, that these coherent states are only defined at the Kinematic level, and now one has to lift them to the level of formula_186 and formula_187. It can be shown that Thiemann&#x27;s Hamiltonian constraint is required to be graph-changing in order to resolve problem 3 in some sense. The master constraint algebra however is trivial and so the requirement that it be graph-changing can be lifted and indeed non-graph-changing master constraint operators have been defined. As far as is currently known, this problem is still out of reach.
# Formulating observables for classical general relativity is a formidable problem because of its non-linear nature and spacetime diffeomorphism invariance. A systematic approximation scheme to calculate observables has been recently developed.

Difficulties in trying to examine the semiclassical limit of the theory should not be confused with it having the wrong semiclassical limit.

Concerning issue number 2 above, consider so-called weave states. Ordinary measurements of geometric quantities are macroscopic, and Planckian discreteness is smoothed out. The fabric of a T-shirt is analogous: at a distance it is a smooth curved two-dimensional surface, but on closer inspection we see that it is actually composed of thousands of one-dimensional linked threads. The image of space given in LQG is similar. Consider a large spin network formed by a large number of nodes and links, each of Planck scale. Probed at a macroscopic scale, it appears as a three-dimensional continuous metric geometry.

To make contact with low energy physics it is mandatory to develop approximation schemes both for the physical inner product and for Dirac observables; the spin foam models that have been intensively studied can be viewed as avenues toward approximation schemes for said physical inner product.

Markopoulou, et al. adopted the idea of noiseless subsystems in an attempt to solve the problem of the low energy limit in background independent quantum gravity theories. The idea has led to the possibility of matter of the standard model being identified with emergent degrees of freedom from some versions of LQG (see section below: &quot;LQG and related research programs&quot;).

As Wightman emphasized in the 1950s, in Minkowski QFTs the formula_188 point functions

:formula_189

completely determine the theory. In particular, one can calculate the scattering amplitudes from these quantities. As explained below in the section on the &quot;Background independent scattering amplitudes&quot;, in the background-independent context, the formula_188 point functions refer to a state and in gravity that state can naturally encode information about a specific geometry which can then appear in the expressions of these quantities. To leading order, LQG calculations have been shown to agree in an appropriate sense with the formula_188point functions calculated in the effective low energy quantum general relativity.

== Improved dynamics and the master constraint ==
=== The master constraint ===
Thiemann&#x27;s Master Constraint Programme for Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) was proposed as a classically equivalent way to impose the infinite number of Hamiltonian constraint equations in terms of a single master constraint formula_192, which involves the square of the constraints in question. An initial objection to the use of the master constraint was that on first sight it did not seem to encode information about the observables; because the Master constraint is quadratic in the constraint, when one computes its Poisson bracket with any quantity, the result is proportional to the constraint, therefore it vanishes when the constraints are imposed and as such does not select out particular phase space functions. However, it was realized that the condition 

:formula_193

is where formula_1 is at least a twice differentiable function on phase space is equivalent to formula_1 being a weak Dirac observable with respect to the constraints in question. So the master constraint does capture information about the observables. Because of its significance this is known as the master equation.

That the master constraint Poisson algebra is an honest Lie algebra opens the possibility of using a method, known as group averaging, in order to construct solutions of the infinite number of Hamiltonian constraints, a physical inner product thereon and Dirac observables via what is known as refined algebraic quantization, or RAQ.

=== The quantum master constraint ===
Define the quantum master constraint (regularisation issues aside) as

:formula_196

Obviously,

:formula_197

for all formula_198 implies formula_199. Conversely, if formula_199 then

:formula_201

implies

:formula_197.

First compute the matrix elements of the would-be operator formula_203, that is, the quadratic form formula_204. formula_204 is a graph changing, diffeomorphism invariant quadratic form that cannot exist on the kinematic Hilbert space formula_206, and must be defined on formula_207. Since the master constraint operator formula_203 is densely defined on formula_209, then formula_203 is a positive and symmetric operator in formula_209. Therefore, the quadratic form formula_204 associated with formula_203 is closable. The closure of formula_204 is the quadratic form of a unique self-adjoint operator formula_215, called the Friedrichs extension of formula_203. We relabel formula_215 as formula_203 for simplicity.

Note that the presence of an inner product, viz Eq 4, means there are no superfluous solutions i.e. there are no formula_49 such that

:formula_220

but for which formula_199.

It is also possible to construct a quadratic form formula_222 for what is called the extended master constraint (discussed below) on formula_206 which also involves the weighted integral of the square of the spatial diffeomorphism constraint (this is possible because formula_222 is not graph changing).

The spectrum of the master constraint may not contain zero due to normal or factor ordering effects which are finite but similar in nature to the infinite vacuum energies of background-dependent quantum field theories. In this case it turns out to be physically correct to replace formula_203 with formula_226 provided that the &quot;normal ordering constant&quot; vanishes in the classical limit, that is,

:formula_227

so that formula_228 is a valid quantisation of formula_192.

=== Testing the master constraint ===
The constraints in their primitive form are rather singular, this was the reason for integrating them over test functions to obtain smeared constraints. However, it would appear that the equation for the master constraint, given above, is even more singular involving the product of two primitive constraints (although integrated over space). Squaring the constraint is dangerous as it could lead to worsened ultraviolet behaviour of the corresponding operator and hence the master constraint programme must be approached with care.

In doing so the master constraint programme has been satisfactorily tested in a number of model systems with non-trivial constraint algebras, free and interacting field theories. The master constraint for LQG was established as a genuine positive self-adjoint operator and the physical Hilbert space of LQG was shown to be non-empty, a consistency test LQG must pass to be a viable theory of quantum general relativity.

=== Applications of the master constraint ===
The master constraint has been employed in attempts to approximate the physical inner product and define more rigorous path integrals.

The Consistent Discretizations approach to LQG, is an application of the master constraint program to construct the physical Hilbert space of the canonical theory.

=== Spin foam from the master constraint ===
The master constraint is easily generalized to incorporate the other constraints. It is then referred to as the extended master constraint, denoted formula_230. We can define the extended master constraint which imposes both the Hamiltonian constraint and spatial diffeomorphism constraint as a single operator,

:formula_231.

Setting this single constraint to zero is equivalent to formula_232 and formula_233 for all formula_198 in formula_122. This constraint implements the spatial diffeomorphism and Hamiltonian constraint at the same time on the Kinematic Hilbert space. The physical inner product is then defined as

:formula_236

(as formula_237). A spin foam representation of this expression is obtained by splitting the formula_238-parameter in discrete steps and writing

formula_239

The spin foam description then follows from the application of formula_240 on a spin network resulting in a linear combination of new spin networks whose graph and labels have been modified. Obviously an approximation is made by truncating the value of formula_241 to some finite integer. An advantage of the extended master constraint is that we are working at the kinematic level and so far it is only here we have access semiclassical coherent states. Moreover, one can find none graph changing versions of this master constraint operator, which are the only type of operators appropriate for these coherent states.

=== Algebraic quantum gravity (AQG) ===
The master constraint programme has evolved into a fully combinatorial treatment of gravity known as algebraic quantum gravity (AQG). The non-graph changing master constraint operator is adapted in the framework of algebraic quantum gravity. While AQG is inspired by LQG, it differs drastically from it because in AQG there is fundamentally no topology or differential structure – it is background independent in a more generalized sense and could possibly have something to say about topology change. In this new formulation of quantum gravity AQG semiclassical states always control the fluctuations of all present degrees of freedom. This makes the AQG semiclassical analysis superior over that of LQG, and progress has been made in establishing it has the correct semiclassical limit and providing contact with familiar low energy physics.

== Physical applications of LQG ==
=== Black hole entropy ===

Black hole thermodynamics is the area of study that seeks to reconcile the laws of thermodynamics with the existence of black hole event horizons. The no hair conjecture of general relativity states that a black hole is characterized only by its mass, its charge, and its angular momentum; hence, it has no entropy. It appears, then, that one can violate the second law of thermodynamics by dropping an object with nonzero entropy into a black hole. Work by Stephen Hawking and Jacob Bekenstein showed that the second law of thermodynamics can be preserved by assigning to each black hole a &quot;black-hole entropy&quot;

:formula_242

where formula_39 is the area of the hole&#x27;s event horizon, formula_244 is the Boltzmann constant, and formula_245 is the Planck length. The fact that the black hole entropy is also the maximal entropy that can be obtained by the Bekenstein bound (wherein the Bekenstein bound becomes an equality) was the main observation that led to the holographic principle.

An oversight in the application of the no-hair theorem is the assumption that the relevant degrees of freedom accounting for the entropy of the black hole must be classical in nature; what if they were purely quantum mechanical instead and had non-zero entropy? This is what is realized in the LQG derivation of black hole entropy, and can be seen as a consequence of its background-independence – the classical black hole spacetime comes about from the semiclassical limit of the quantum state of the gravitational field, but there are many quantum states that have the same semiclassical limit. Specifically, in LQG it is possible to associate a quantum geometrical interpretation to the microstates: These are the quantum geometries of the horizon which are consistent with the area, formula_39, of the black hole and the topology of the horizon (i.e. spherical). LQG offers a geometric explanation of the finiteness of the entropy and of the proportionality of the area of the horizon. These calculations have been generalized to rotating black holes.

It is possible to derive, from the covariant formulation of full quantum theory (Spinfoam) the correct relation between energy and area (1st law), the Unruh temperature and the distribution that yields Hawking entropy. The calculation makes use of the notion of dynamical horizon and is done for non-extremal black holes.

A recent success of the theory in this direction is the computation of the entropy of all non singular black holes directly from theory and independent of Immirzi parameter. The result is the expected formula formula_247, where formula_248 is the entropy and formula_39 the area of the black hole, derived by Bekenstein and Hawking on heuristic grounds. This is the only known derivation of this formula from a fundamental theory, for the case of generic non singular black holes. Older attempts at this calculation had difficulties. The problem was that although Loop quantum gravity predicted that the entropy of a black hole is proportional to the area of the event horizon, the result depended on a crucial free parameter in the theory, the above-mentioned Immirzi parameter. However, there is no known computation of the Immirzi parameter, so it was fixed by demanding agreement with Bekenstein and Hawking&#x27;s calculation of the black hole entropy.

===Hawking radiation in loop quantum gravity===

A detailed study of the quantum geometry of a black hole horizon has been made using loop quantum gravity. Loop-quantization does not reproduce the result for black hole entropy originally discovered by Bekenstein and Hawking, unless one chooses the value of the Immirzi parameter to cancel out another constant that arises in the derivation. However, it led to the computation of higher-order corrections to the entropy and radiation of black holes.

Based on the fluctuations of the horizon area, a quantum black hole exhibits deviations from the Hawking spectrum that would be observable were X-rays from Hawking radiation of evaporating primordial black holes to be observed. The quantum effects are centered at a set of discrete and unblended frequencies highly pronounced on top of Hawking radiation spectrum.

=== Planck star ===
In 2014 Carlo Rovelli and Francesca Vidotto proposed that there is a Planck star inside every black hole. Based on LQG, the theory states that as stars are collapsing into black holes, the energy density reaches the Planck energy density, causing a repulsive force that creates a star. Furthermore, the existence of such a star would resolve the black hole firewall and black hole information paradox.

=== Loop quantum cosmology ===

The popular and technical literature makes extensive references to the LQG-related topic of loop quantum cosmology. LQC was mainly developed by Martin Bojowald. It was popularized in &quot;Scientific American&quot; for predicting a Big Bounce prior to the Big Bang. Loop quantum cosmology (LQC) is a symmetry-reduced model of classical general relativity quantized using methods that mimic those of loop quantum gravity (LQG) that predicts a &quot;quantum bridge&quot; between contracting and expanding cosmological branches.

Achievements of LQC have been the resolution of the big bang singularity, the prediction of a Big Bounce, and a natural mechanism for inflation.

LQC models share features of LQG and so is a useful toy model. However, the results obtained are subject to the usual restriction that a truncated classical theory, then quantized, might not display the true behaviour of the full theory due to artificial suppression of degrees of freedom that might have large quantum fluctuations in the full theory. It has been argued that singularity avoidance in LQC are by mechanisms only available in these restrictive models and that singularity avoidance in the full theory can still be obtained but by a more subtle feature of LQG.

=== Loop quantum gravity phenomenology ===
Quantum gravity effects are difficult to measure because the Planck length is so small. However recently physicists, such as Jack Palmer, have started to consider the possibility of measuring quantum gravity effects mostly from astrophysical observations and gravitational wave detectors. The energy of those fluctuations at scales this small cause space-perturbations which are visible at higher scales.

=== Background-independent scattering amplitudes ===
Loop quantum gravity is formulated in a background-independent language. No spacetime is assumed a priori, but rather it is built up by the states of theory themselves – however scattering amplitudes are derived from formula_241-point functions (Correlation function) and these, formulated in conventional quantum field theory, are functions of points of a background spacetime. The relation between the background-independent formalism and the conventional formalism of quantum field theory on a given spacetime is not obvious, and it is not obvious how to recover low-energy quantities from the full background-independent theory. One would like to derive the formula_241-point functions of the theory from the background-independent formalism, in order to compare them with the standard perturbative expansion of quantum general relativity and therefore check that loop quantum gravity yields the correct low-energy limit.

A strategy for addressing this problem has been suggested; by studying the boundary amplitude, namely a path integral over a finite spacetime region, seen as a function of the boundary value of the field. In conventional quantum field theory, this boundary amplitude is well–defined and codes the physical information of the theory; it does so in quantum gravity as well, but in a fully background–independent manner. A generally covariant definition of formula_241-point functions can then be based on the idea that the distance between physical points – arguments of the formula_241-point function is determined by the state of the gravitational field on the boundary of the spacetime region considered.

Progress has been made in calculating background-independent scattering amplitudes this way with the use of spin foams. This is a way to extract physical information from the theory. Claims to have reproduced the correct behaviour for graviton scattering amplitudes and to have recovered classical gravity have been made. &quot;We have calculated Newton&#x27;s law starting from a world with no space and no time.&quot; – Carlo Rovelli.

== Gravitons, string theory, supersymmetry, extra dimensions in LQG ==

Some quantum theories of gravity posit a spin-2 quantum field that is quantized, giving rise to gravitons. In string theory, one generally starts with quantized excitations on top of a classically fixed background. This theory is thus described as background dependent. Particles like photons as well as changes in the spacetime geometry (gravitons) are both described as excitations on the string worldsheet. The background dependence of string theory can have physical consequences, such as determining the number of quark generations. In contrast, loop quantum gravity, like general relativity, is manifestly background independent, eliminating the background required in string theory. Loop quantum gravity, like string theory, also aims to overcome the nonrenormalizable divergences of quantum field theories.

LQG does not introduce a background and excitations living on such a background, so LQG does not use gravitons as building blocks. Instead one expects that one may recover a kind of semiclassical limit or weak field limit where something like &quot;gravitons&quot; will show up again. In contrast, gravitons play a key role in string theory where they are among the first (massless) level of excitations of a superstring.

LQG differs from string theory in that it is formulated in 3 and 4 dimensions and without supersymmetry or Kaluza–Klein extra dimensions, while the latter requires both to be true. There is no experimental evidence to date that confirms string theory&#x27;s predictions of supersymmetry and Kaluza–Klein extra dimensions. In a 2003 paper &quot;A Dialog on Quantum Gravity&quot;, Carlo Rovelli regards the fact LQG is formulated in 4 dimensions and without supersymmetry as a strength of the theory as it represents the most parsimonious explanation, consistent with current experimental results, over its rival string/M-theory. Proponents of string theory will often point to the fact that, among other things, it demonstrably reproduces the established theories of general relativity and quantum field theory in the appropriate limits, which loop quantum gravity has struggled to do. In that sense string theory&#x27;s connection to established physics may be considered more reliable and less speculative, at the mathematical level. Loop quantum gravity has nothing to say about the matter (fermions) in the universe.

Since LQG has been formulated in 4 dimensions (with and without supersymmetry), and M-theory requires supersymmetry and 11 dimensions, a direct comparison between the two has not been possible. It is possible to extend mainstream LQG formalism to higher-dimensional supergravity, general relativity with supersymmetry and Kaluza–Klein extra dimensions should experimental evidence establish their existence. It would therefore be desirable to have higher-dimensional Supergravity loop quantizations at one&#x27;s disposal in order to compare these approaches. A series of papers have been published attempting this. Most recently, Thiemann (and alumni) have made progress toward calculating black hole entropy for supergravity in higher dimensions. It will be useful to compare these results to the corresponding super string calculations.

== LQG and related research programs ==

Several research groups have attempted to combine LQG with other research programs: Johannes Aastrup, Jesper M. Grimstrup et al. research combines noncommutative geometry with canonical quantum gravity and Ashtekar variables, Laurent Freidel, Simone Speziale, et al., spinors and twistor theory with loop quantum gravity, and Lee Smolin et al. with Verlinde entropic gravity and loop gravity. Stephon Alexander, Antonino Marciano and Lee Smolin have attempted to explain the origins of weak force chirality in terms of Ashketar&#x27;s variables, which describe gravity as chiral, and LQG with Yang–Mills theory fields in four dimensions. Sundance Bilson-Thompson, Hackett et al., has attempted to introduce the standard model via LQGs degrees of freedom as an emergent property (by employing the idea of noiseless subsystems, a notion introduced in a more general situation for constrained systems by Fotini Markopoulou-Kalamara et al.)

Furthermore, LQG has drawn philosophical comparisons with causal dynamical triangulation and asymptotically safe gravity, and the spinfoam with group field theory and AdS/CFT correspondence. Smolin and Wen have suggested combining LQG with string-net liquid, tensors, and Smolin and Fotini Markopoulou-Kalamara quantum graphity. There is the consistent discretizations approach. Also, Pullin and Gambini provide a framework to connect the path integral and canonical approaches to quantum gravity. They may help reconcile the spin foam and canonical loop representation approaches. Recent research by Chris Duston and Matilde Marcolli introduces topology change via topspin networks.

== Problems and comparisons with alternative approaches ==
Some of the major unsolved problems in physics are theoretical, meaning that existing theories seem incapable of explaining a certain observed phenomenon or experimental result. The others are experimental, meaning that there is a difficulty in creating an experiment to test a proposed theory or investigate a phenomenon in greater detail.

Many of these problems apply to LQG, including:
* Can quantum mechanics and general relativity be realized as a fully consistent theory (perhaps as a quantum field theory)?
* Is spacetime fundamentally continuous or discrete?
* Would a consistent theory involve a force mediated by a hypothetical graviton, or be a product of a discrete structure of spacetime itself (as in loop quantum gravity)?
* Are there deviations from the predictions of general relativity at very small or very large scales or in other extreme circumstances that flow from a quantum gravity theory?

The theory of LQG is one possible solution to the problem of quantum gravity, as is string theory. There are substantial differences however. For example, string theory also addresses unification, the understanding of all known forces and particles as manifestations of a single entity, by postulating extra dimensions and so-far unobserved additional particles and symmetries. Contrary to this, LQG is based only on quantum theory and general relativity and its scope is limited to understanding the quantum aspects of the gravitational interaction. On the other hand, the consequences of LQG are radical, because they fundamentally change the nature of space and time and provide a tentative but detailed physical and mathematical picture of quantum spacetime.

Presently, no semiclassical limit recovering general relativity has been shown to exist. This means it remains unproven that LQG&#x27;s description of spacetime at the Planck scale has the right continuum limit (described by general relativity with possible quantum corrections). Specifically, the dynamics of the theory are encoded in the Hamiltonian constraint, but there is no candidate Hamiltonian. Other technical problems include finding off-shell closure of the constraint algebra and physical inner product vector space, coupling to matter fields of quantum field theory, fate of the renormalization of the graviton in perturbation theory that lead to ultraviolet divergence beyond 2-loops (see one-loop Feynman diagram in Feynman diagram).

While there has been a proposal relating to observation of naked singularities, and doubly special relativity as a part of a program called loop quantum cosmology, there is no experimental observation for which loop quantum gravity makes a prediction not made by the Standard Model or general relativity (a problem that plagues all current theories of quantum gravity). Because of the above-mentioned lack of a semiclassical limit, LQG has not yet even reproduced the predictions made by general relativity.

An alternative criticism is that general relativity may be an effective field theory, and therefore quantization ignores the fundamental degrees of freedom.

ESA&#x27;s INTEGRAL satellite measured polarization of photons of different wavelengths and was able to place a limit in the granularity of space that is less than 10−48m or 13 orders of magnitude below the Planck scale.

<doc id="152671" wikidata="Q222419" url="?curid=152671" title="Z3 (computer)">
<text>The Z3 was a German electromechanical computer designed by Konrad Zuse in 1938, and completed in 1941. It was the world&#x27;s first working programmable, fully automatic digital computer. The Z3 was built with 2,600 relays, implementing a 22-bit word length that operated at a clock frequency of about 5–10 Hz. Program code was stored on punched film. Initial values were entered manually.

The Z3 was completed in Berlin in 1941. It was not considered vital, so it was never put into everyday operation. Based on the work of the German aerodynamics engineer Hans Georg Küssner (known for the Küssner effect), a &quot;Program to Compute a Complex Matrix&quot; was written and used to solve wing flutter problems. Zuse asked the German government for funding to replace the relays with fully electronic switches, but funding was denied during World War II since such development was deemed &quot;not war-important&quot;.

The original Z3 was destroyed on 21 December 1943 during an Allied bombardment of Berlin. That Z3 was originally called V3 (&quot;Versuchsmodell 3&quot; or Experimental Model 3) but was renamed so that it would not be confused with Germany&#x27;s V-weapons. A fully functioning replica was built in 1961 by Zuse&#x27;s company, Zuse KG, which is now on permanent display at Deutsches Museum in Munich.

The Z3 was demonstrated in 1998 to be, in principle, Turing-complete. However, because it lacked conditional branching, the Z3 only meets this definition by speculatively computing all possible outcomes of a calculation.

Thanks to this machine and its predecessors, Konrad Zuse has often been suggested as the inventor of the computer.

== Design and development ==

Zuse designed the Z1 in 1935 to 1936 and built it from 1936 to 1938. The Z1 was wholly mechanical and only worked for a few minutes at a time at most. Helmut Schreyer advised Zuse to use a different technology. As a doctoral student at the Technische Hochschule in Charlottenburg (now Technische Universität Berlin) in 1937 he worked on the implementation of Boolean operations and (in today&#x27;s terminology) flip-flops on the basis of vacuum tubes. In 1938, Schreyer demonstrated a circuit on this basis to a small audience, and explained his vision of an electronic computing machine – but since the largest operational electronic devices contained far fewer tubes this was considered practically infeasible. In that year when presenting the plan for a computer with 2,000 electron tubes, Zuse and Schreyer, who was an assistant at Telecommunication Institute at Technische Universität Berlin, were discouraged by members of the institute who knew about the problems with electron tube technology. Zuse later recalled: &quot;They smiled at us in 1939, when we wanted to build electronic machines ... We said: The electronic machine is great, but first the components have to be developed.&quot; In 1940, Zuse and Schreyer managed to arrange a meeting at the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW) to discuss a potential project for developing an electronic computer, but when they estimated a duration of two or three years, the proposal was rejected.

Zuse decided to implement the next design based on relays. The realization of the Z2 was helped financially by Kurt Pannke, who manufactured small calculating machines. The Z2 was completed and presented to an audience of the (&quot;German Laboratory for Aviation&quot;) in 1940 in Berlin-Adlershof. Zuse was lucky – this presentation was one of the few instances where the Z2 actually worked and could convince the DVL to partly finance the next design.

In 1941, improving on the basic Z2 machine, he built the Z3 in a highly secret project of the German government. Joseph Jennissen (1905–1977), member of the &quot;Research-Leadership&quot; (&quot;Forschungsführung&quot;) in the Reich Air Ministry acted as a government supervisor for orders of the ministry to Zuse&#x27;s company &quot;ZUSE Apparatebau&quot;. A further intermediary between Zuse and the Reich Air Ministry was the aerodynamicist Herbert A. Wagner.
The Z3 was completed in 1941 and was faster and far more reliable than the Z1 and Z2. The Z3 floating-point arithmetic was improved over that of the Z1 in that it implemented exception handling &quot;using just a few relays&quot;, the exceptional values (plus infinity, minus infinity and undefined) could be generated and passed through operations. It further added a square root instruction. 

The Z3, like its predecessors, stored its program on an external punched tape, thus no rewiring was necessary to change programs. However, it did not have conditional branching found in later universal computers.

On 12 May 1941, the Z3 was presented to an audience of scientists including the professors Alfred Teichmann and Curt Schmieden of the (&quot;German Laboratory for Aviation&quot;) in Berlin, today known as the German Aerospace Center in Cologne.

Zuse moved on to the Z4 design, which he completed in a bunker in the Harz mountains, alongside Wernher von Braun&#x27;s ballistic missile development. When World War II ended, Zuse retreated to Hinterstein in the Alps with the Z4, where he remained for several years.

== Instruction set ==
The Z3 operated as a stack machine with a stack of two registers, R1 and R2. The first load operation in a program would load the contents of a memory location into R1; the next load operation would load the contents of a memory location into R2. Arithmetic instructions would operate on the contents of R1 and R2, leaving the result in R1, and clearing R2; the next load operation would load into R2. A store operation would store the contents of R1 into a memory location, and clear R1; the next load operation would load the contents of a memory location into R1.

A read keyboard operation would read a number from the keyboard into R1 and clear R2. A display instruction would display the contents of R1 and clear R2; the next load instruction would load into R2.

== Z3 as a universal Turing machine ==
It was possible to construct loops on the Z3, but there was no conditional branch instruction. Nevertheless, the Z3 was Turing-complete – how to implement a universal Turing machine on the Z3 was shown in 1998 by Raúl Rojas. He proposed that the tape program would have to be long enough to execute every possible path through both sides of every branch. It would compute all possible answers, but the unneeded results would be canceled out (a kind of speculative execution). Rojas concludes, &quot;We can therefore say that, from an abstract theoretical perspective, the computing model of the Z3 is equivalent to the computing model of today&#x27;s computers. From a practical perspective, and in the way the Z3 was really programmed, it was not equivalent to modern computers.&quot;

This seeming limitation belies the fact that the Z3 provided a &quot;practical&quot; instruction set for the typical engineering applications of the 1940s. Mindful of the existing hardware restrictions, Zuse&#x27;s main goal at the time was to have a workable device to facilitate his work as a civil engineer.

== Relation to other work ==
The success of Zuse&#x27;s Z3 is often attributed to its use of the simple binary system. This was invented roughly three centuries earlier by Gottfried Leibniz; Boole later used it to develop his Boolean algebra. Zuse was inspired by Hilbert&#x27;s and Ackermann&#x27;s book on elementary mathematical logic &quot;Principles of Mathematical Logic&quot;. In 1937, Claude Shannon introduced the idea of mapping Boolean algebra onto electronic relays in a seminal work on digital circuit design. Zuse, however, did not know of Shannon&#x27;s work and developed the groundwork independently for his first computer Z1, which he designed and built from 1935 to 1938.

Zuse&#x27;s coworker Helmut Schreyer built an electronic digital experimental model of a computer using 100 vacuum tubes in 1942, but it was lost at the end of the war.

An analog computer was built by the rocket scientist Helmut Hölzer in 1942 at the Peenemünde Army Research Center to simulate V-2 rocket trajectories.

The Colossus (1943), built by Tommy Flowers, and the Atanasoff–Berry computer (1942) used thermionic valves (vacuum tubes) and binary representation of numbers. Programming was by means of re-plugging patch panels and setting switches.

The ENIAC computer, completed after the war, used vacuum tubes to implement switches and used decimal representation for numbers. Until 1948 programming was, as with Colossus, by patch leads and switches.

The Manchester Baby of 1948 along with the Manchester Mark 1 and EDSAC both of 1949 were the world&#x27;s earliest working computers that stored program instructions and data in the same space. In this they implemented the stored-program concept which is frequently (but erroneously) attributed to a 1945 paper by John von Neumann and colleagues. Von Neumann is said to have given due credit to Alan Turing, and the concept had actually been mentioned earlier by Konrad Zuse himself, in a 1936 patent application (that was rejected). Konrad Zuse himself remembered in his memoirs: &quot;During the war it would have barely been possible to build efficient stored program devices anyway.&quot; Friedrich L. Bauer later wrote: &quot;His visionary ideas (live programs) which were only to be published years afterwards aimed at the right practical direction but were never implemented by him.&quot;

<text>Schaumburg is a district (&quot;Landkreis&quot;) of Lower Saxony, Germany. It is bounded by (clockwise from the north) the districts of Nienburg, Hanover and Hameln-Pyrmont, and the state of North Rhine-Westphalia (districts of Lippe and Minden-Lübbecke).

==History==
Landkreis Schaumburg was created on August 1, 1977 within the framework of the Kreisreform (district reform) of Lower Saxony by combining the former districts of Schaumburg-Lippe and Grafschaft Schaumburg. The town of Hessisch Oldendorf was reallocated to Landkreis Hameln-Pyrmont. The communities of Großenheidorn, Idensermoor-Niengraben and Steinhude had already been allocated to the community of Wunsdorf and thereby became part of Landkreis Hanover.

The Landkreis Schaumburg essentially duplicates the borders of Schaumburg at the time of the Middle Ages. Schaumburg was a medieval county, which was founded at the beginning of the 12th century. Shortly after, the Holy Roman Emperor appointed the counts of Schaumburg to become counts of Holstein as well.

During the Thirty Years&#x27; War the House of Schaumburg had no male heir, and the county was divided into Schaumburg (which became part of Hesse-Kassel) and the County of Schaumburg-Lippe (1640). As a member of the Confederation of the Rhine, Schaumburg-Lippe raised itself to a principality. In 1815, Schaumburg-Lippe joined the German Confederation, and in 1871 the German Empire. In 1918, it became a republic. The tiny Free State of Schaumburg-Lippe existed until 1946, when it became an administrative area within Lower Saxony. Schaumburg-Lippe had an area of 340 km², and a population of 51,000 (as of 1934).

Hessian Schaumburg was annexed to Prussia along with the rest of Hesse-Kassel in 1866. After World War II, Schaumburg and Schaumburg-Lippe became districts within the state of Lower Saxony, until they were merged again in 1977.

==Geography==
The district (&quot;Landkreis&quot;) of Schaumburg has its northern half located in the North German Plain and the southern half in the Weser Uplands (&quot;Weserbergland&quot;). The Weser Uplands consist of hilly ridges and include the Wesergebirge, Harrl, Süntel, Bückeberg and Deister. The Schaumburg Forest is a continuous strip of woods running in a direction of approximately 60 degrees along the northern border of the district. Just beyond the northern border of the district is Lake Steinhude a 29,1 km2 shallow lake that is the largest in Northern Germany. The river Weser flows westward along the south of the Wiehengebirge through a broad valley and the town of Rinteln. The landscape is bordered to the west by the River Weser which is in the neighbouring district of Minden-Lübbecke. It flows north through the Westphalian Gap towards the city of Bremen and the North Sea. In the flat North German Plain to the east of Schaumburg district lies Hanover, the capital city of Lower Saxony.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms is almost identical to the old arms of Schaumburg, which had been used since the 12th century. Schaumburg Castle, in mediaeval times the seat of the Counts of Schaumburg, is located on the &quot;Nesselberg&quot; (&quot;nettle mountain&quot;) in Schaumburg, a locality in the town of Rinteln. The nettle leaf in the middle of the arms has become the heraldic symbol of Holstein, symbolising the historical connection between Holstein and Schaumburg.

<doc id="152678" wikidata="Q846683" url="?curid=152678" title="Grantham">
<text>Grantham () is a market town and civil parish in the South Kesteven district of Lincolnshire, England, situated on the banks of the River Witham and bounded to the west by the A1 road. It lies south of Lincoln and east of Nottingham. The population in 2016 was put at 44,580. The town is the largest settlement and the administrative centre of the South Kesteven District.

Grantham was the birthplace of the UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Isaac Newton was educated at the King&#x27;s School. The town was the workplace of the UK&#x27;s first warranted female police officer, Edith Smith in 1914. The UK&#x27;s first running diesel engine was made there in 1892 and the first tractor in 1896. Thomas Paine worked there as an excise officer in the 1760s. The villages of Manthorpe, Great Gonerby, Barrowby, Londonthorpe and Harlaxton form outlying suburbs of the town.

==Etymology==
Grantham&#x27;s name is first attested in the Domesday Book (1086); its origin is not known with certainty. The ending &quot;-hām&quot; is Old English and means &quot;homestead&quot;. The first part of the name may either be the personal name &quot;Granta&quot; or derive from the Old English word &quot;Grand&quot; (gravel), implying either &quot;Granta&#x27;s homestead&quot; or &quot;homestead by gravel&quot;. In the early 20th century, the town&#x27;s name was still pronounced &quot;Grant-m&quot; or &quot;Grahnt-m&quot;; but as people moved more frequently and became more literate, they began to derive the place name from its spelling and the pronunciation shifted to &quot;Granthum&quot; (the &quot;t&quot; and &quot;h&quot; becoming a &quot;th&quot; phoneme). This was already becoming common in 1920, and the later pronunciation is now the norm.

==Geography==

Grantham is a town in the South Kesteven district of Lincolnshire, a non-metropolitan county in the East Midlands of England. Until 1974 it was a borough, but it is now a civil parish and bounded by the parishes of Great Gonerby to the north-west, Belton and Manthorpe to the north, Londonthorpe and Harrowby Without to the north-east and east, Little Ponton and Stroxton to the south, Harlaxton to the south-west, and Barrowby to the west. Its urban area is almost entirely within the parish, though The Spinney housing estate, Alma Park industrial estate and part of the Bridge End Road housing estate are in Londonthorpe and Harrowby Without.

===Topography and geology===
The town lies in the valley of the River Witham, its core at the Witham&#x27;s confluence with the Mowbeck (or Mow Beck). The Witham flows south–north through Grantham. The Mowbeck, which rises from springs at Harlaxton about to the south-west of the town, is culverted behind Westgate and Brook Street until it joins the Witham at White Bridge.

The floor of the Witham valley – 50–60 m above sea level in the town centre – is underlain by mudstone of the Charmouth formation of the Lower Jurassic period (199–183 million years ago). This formation is overlain by Belton sand and gravel laid down in estuaries and rivers in the Quaternary period up to 3 million years ago. The river courses are overlain by Quaternary alluvium and to the north by river terrace deposits. The soil around the route of the Witham is wet, acidic, sandy and loamy; its fertility is poor.

As the ground rises on the town&#x27;s eastern and southern fringes, it is underlain by Jurassic Marlstone rocks of ferruginous sandstone and ironstone formed 190–174 million years ago, and then by Whitby Mudstone of 174–183 million years ago. The land rises sharply to form the Lincoln Cliff that marks the edge of the urban area and start of the Lincoln Heath and Kesteven Uplands, which are capped by Jurassic Oolitic Limestone, mostly overlain by shallow, free-draining, lime-rich soils.

To the west, the town is near the edge of the low-lying Vale of Belvoir but fringed by an escarpment rising in places to over 100 m to form the hills on which sit Barrowby, Great Gonerby, the Green Hill and Earlesfield suburban areas and the business parks off Trent Road. These hills are of siltstone and mudstone of the Jurassic Dyrham Formation, which line the edges of the Witham and Mowbeck valleys and the shallow valley of Barrowby Stream. At its highest the scarp is capped by Jurassic ferruginous sandstone and ironstone rocks of the Marlstone formation. There are some head deposits and pleistocene glaciofluvial deposits of sand and gravel east of Barrowby. The soil in the lower areas is slowly permeable, seasonally wet and slightly acidic, though base-rich. On higher ground it tends to be slightly acidic and base-rich, but freely draining and highly fertile.

Grantham Canal, which opened in 1797, closely follows the route of the Mowbeck from Echo Farm into the town. West of there it cuts through a valley north of Harlaxton into the Vale of Belvoir, eventually reaching West Bridgford near Nottingham.

===Urban area===

The historical core of Grantham is bounded by Westgate, Brook Street and Castlegate, and includes the High Street down to St Peter&#x27;s Hill. This is the town&#x27;s main retail and commercial area. It includes many historic buildings. Between Westgate and the A52 to the west are postwar retail buildings and blocks of flats. North of it is 18th, 19th and 20th-century suburban housing focused on North Parade, which include villas and terraced housing. Further north, off Gonerby Road and Manthorpe Road (A607), these give way to large, low-density, suburban, privately owned housing on estates mostly built in the 1970s and 1980s. Those at the base of Gonerby Hill are known as Gonerby Hill Foot and lie west of the railway line, to the east of which developments are contiguous with the historical core of Manthorpe village.

South of the town centre, suburban housing takes the form of late-Victorian and Edwardian brick, terraced and villa houses in grid-plan layouts, initially built for industrial workers and now largely owned or let privately. Alongside some housing in Harlaxton Road (A607), most of these streets cluster round the railway station and nearby retail and industrial units in an area known as Spittlegate (also spelled Spitalgate or Spittalgate), the town cemetery – an area called New Somerby in older maps – and the Wharf Road, London Road and Bridge End Road stretches of the A52. Further south-east, low-density, mostly privately owned, suburban housing estates of the 1970s and 1980s cluster round the A52, marking the edge of the town&#x27;s urban area in an area of rising ground that forms part of Somerby Hill. Further east, off the A52, are the Prince William of Gloucester Barracks, on the brow of the hill.

The north-east fringe of the urban area is marked by 20th-century development. An exception is a piece of land east of the Witham and north of Stonebridge Road that includes schools and colleges and portions of a 19th-century barracks complex south of greenspace, including Wyndham Park. Otherwise the area between the Witham, Belton Lane, Londonthorpe Lane and the Lincoln Cliff has suburban housing, mostly privately owned with some let by housing associations. It includes part of the Harrowby Estate, begun in 1928 as council housing). The part round Belton Lane and Harrowby Lane is a low-density mix of pre-First World War, interwar and postwar houses; the remainder of the large estate and the Cherry Orchard Estate appeared in the immediate postwar period in medium density, on a layout inspired by the Garden City movement. South of Londonthorpe Lane and north-east of the other estates are medium and high-density housing areas dating largely from the 1970s to the early 21st century; The northernmost, known as The Spinney or Sunningdale, adjoins the post-war Alma Park industrial estate off Londonthorpe Lane.

The town&#x27;s western fringe sits between the railway line, the A1 bypass and the Kesteven Uplands. North of the canal are large, varied developments mostly from the 20th century, including the Earlesfield estate, begun as a council estate in the 1920s and expanded in the postwar period, industrial estates, and a leisure centre complex, all south of Barrowby Stream, by the expansive 1980s estate on Green Hill, the Edwardian and Victorian villas lining Barrowby Road, and the large 1980s and 1990s estate to its north. Most of this is privately owned, but some is let by housing associations. The canal basin is lined with industrial, warehouse, retail and office buildings that continue up to Dysart Road. South of them are Harlaxton Road (A607) and Springfield Road, round which separate residential developments have been built, including inter-war homes in Huntingtower Road, a 21st-century estate centred on Hudson Way, post-war social housing at Walton Gardens, post-war housing Denton Avenue, and late-20th-century developments at Harris Way.

===Climate===
The British Isles experience a temperate, maritime climate with warm summers and cool winters. Data from the weather station nearest to Grantham, at Cranwell, away, shows an average daily mean temperature of fluctuates from a peak of in July to in January. The average high temperature is , though monthly averages vary from in January and December to in July; the average low is , reaching lowest in February at and highest in July and August at .

==Prehistory==
Much of Grantham&#x27;s early archaeology lies buried beneath the modern town, making it &quot;difficult to unravel&quot;. Early prehistoric hunter-gatherers visited the area. Scattered Stone Age tools have been found, the earliest being a Palaeolithic axe on the Cherry Orchard Estate, dating between 40,000 and 150,000 years ago. The next earliest material consist of Mesolithic flints crafted 4,000 to 8,000 years ago and found round Gonerby Hill and the riverside in the south of the town. Neolithic people probably settled in the Grantham area for its proximity to the rivers and its fertile soils; material suggesting settlement in this period has been found at Great Ponton. Other scattered finds have been unearthed around the town. Remains of a Neolithic ritual site on the parish boundary between Harlaxton and Grantham are known from aerial photography. Bronze Age artefacts include pottery vessels, with human remains found in Little Gonerby, a Beaker pot, Beaker pottery sherds, cinerary urns and a food vessel, and a later cemetery at Belton Lane, but there is little direct evidence of Bronze Age settlement in the area of the modern town. Little is known about it in the Iron Age, though ditched enclosures and a field system of this date are known to lie off Gorse Lane.

Various Romano-British coins and pottery finds have emerged in Grantham; a burial and pottery from the 2nd century AD were uncovered off Trent Road in 1981. Small settlements or farmsteads from the period have been discerned on the hills overlooking Grantham from the east, and another has been found in Barrowby. There were probably Romano-British farmsteads on the site of the modern town, but the wet soils round the Mowbeck and flooding by the Witham probably made it hard for a larger settlement to grow there. Three kilometres to the south of the modern town, an important Roman site has been found at Saltersford, a crossing of the River Witham near Little Ponton. Extensive finds and evidence of a significant Romano-British occupation have emerged in the vicinity since the 19th century; it has been tentatively identified by some scholars as &quot;Causennae&quot;, mentioned in the Antonine Itinerary, and sat at the place where River Witham was crossed by the Salter&#x27;s Way, a trade route connecting the salt-producing coastal and marshland regions with the Midlands. Salter&#x27;s Way may also have crossed Ermine Street (now B6403) at Cold Harbour, 4 km south-east of Grantham. Saltersford may have been a small town with a market for local farmsteads and smaller settlements.

==Medieval town==
===Origins===
The local historian Michael Honeybone has &quot;no doubt that the town of Grantham was established during [Anglo-]Saxon times&quot;; its name suggests it emerged in the earliest phase of Anglo-Saxon settlement, probably by the 7th century. The archaeological evidence for this is limited to finds indicating cemeteries at the sites of the Central School in Manthorpe and the junction of Bridge End Road and London Road in the town, and to small quantities of pottery sherds found on London Road, Belton Lane, Saltersford, New Somerby and Barrowby.

The town&#x27;s Saxon-period history is obscure and debated. The medievalist Sir Frank Stenton argued that Grantham probably emerged as an &quot;important estate centre&quot; before the Viking invasions in the 9th century and then functioned as a &quot;minor local capital&quot; in the Danelaw. By contrast, the historian David Roffe has argued that the town and its outlying soke were established in the 1040s or 1050s by Queen Edith and Leofric, Earl of Mercia, to strengthen their hands in the county at the expense of Siward, Earl of Northumbria. They may have also created St Wulfram&#x27;s Church either as a new place of worship or as one revived from a possible earlier cell of Crowland Abbey. Roffe argues that Siward&#x27;s death in 1055 made Grantham&#x27;s new role less important; as such, its soke only grew to its full extent after the Norman Conquest of England, when the king merged it with the soke of Great Ponton. Whatever its origins, by the time of the Domesday Book (1086, the earliest documentary evidence for the settlement), Grantham was a town and royal manor; under its jurisdiction fell soke comprising lands in 16 villages. St Wulfram&#x27;s served this extended parish area.

===Royal manor===
Grantham&#x27;s Domesday entries show it as an estate centre, where Queen Edith had a hall before 1066. Twenty years later, the king had the manor; there were four mills and eight acres of meadow, but no arable land. The demesne appears to have been land now known as Earlesfield in Great Gonerby. There were 111 burgesses and 72 bordars, possibly labourers or craftsmen, indicating that Grantham was both a manor and a borough where the lord retained exclusive rights. It was a valuable asset, used by the king to reward loyal followers. By 1129, the manor and soke had been granted to Rabel de Tancarville, the king&#x27;s chamberlain in Normandy. He sided against King Stephen during The Anarchy (1135–1154) and his lands were probably forfeited on his death in 1140, although restored to his son William and confirmed in the early 1180s. The king retook the manor after William&#x27;s heir Ralph de Tancarville failed to support him in Normandy.

In 1205, the king granted it to his ally William de Warenne, 5th Earl of Surrey. It was held as a life interest and reverted to the Crown on his widow&#x27;s death in 1249, but regranted to his son the 6th earl in 1266. On his death in 1304 it reverted to the crown and was soon granted to Aymer de Valence, but had been regranted to Warenne&#x27;s grandson, the 7th earl, by 1312. Four years later it was resettled on the 7th earl for life with reversion to the crown. William de Bohun, 1st Earl of Northampton was granted the reversion in 1337 and took seisin ten years later. After his death, it reverted again to the Crown and in 1363 Edward II granted it to his son Edmund of Langley, Duke of York, through whose heirs it passed to Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York, a major figure in the Wars of the Roses and rival of Henry VI. After Richard&#x27;s death in 1460, Henry&#x27;s Queen Margaret of Anjou attacked Grantham in 1461, but later that year was defeated by Richard&#x27;s son Edward, who took the throne as Edward IV. Two years later, Grantham was rewarded for loyalty to the Yorkist cause when the king granted the borough a charter of incorporation, as a self-governing council – the Corporation of Grantham headed by an Alderman – with various freedoms.

===Economy and government===

Its lords encouraged Grantham to expand as a commercial centre. By the late 11th century it was an &quot;important market town&quot;. The wool trade prospered, benefiting from its proximity to grazing lands on the Lincoln Heath. This wealth contributed towards the building of St Wulfram&#x27;s Church. Wool shops were in Grantham in 1218 and Walkergate (now Watergate) was recorded in 1257, indicating the presence of fullers (walkers), who played a role in processing wool. Cloth manufacture declined around this time, but wool continued to be produced for trading, primarily for export from Boston. Wool merchants are recorded from the town in the late 13th century (foremost being was Roger de Belvoir, who contributed over £296 to the Wool Prize of 1297). By this time merchants from Italy, Saint-Omer and Amiens were active in the town.

In 1269, the earl granted the town free tronage – the right to weigh wool without paying a toll. Less than 30 years later, its merchants were asked to send a representative to counsel the king. The wool trade boomed in the early 14th century; the town&#x27;s merchants traded at least 980 sacks of wool at Boston during Edward II&#x27;s reign, half from the de Chesterton family. In 1312, the earl granted the burgesses various freedoms and the right to elect a leader (the Alderman), codifying a longstanding informal arrangement. Later in the century the king sought to raise revenues by taxing the wool trade; some Grantham merchants, including the wealthy Roger de Wollesthorpe, acted as creditors to the king.

England&#x27;s falling population, continued taxation of wool exports and the growth of cloth exports and monopolisation led to the wool trade declining by the mid-15th century. Cloth exports became more important nationally. Grantham had a small cloth industry, but it could not compete with new fulling mills, which required fast-flowing water. Its merchants continued to trade in wool and it remained a dominant aspect of the town&#x27;s economy. Other industries also existed during the Middle Ages; there is evidence of wine trading, brewing, parchment making, weaving and other trades and crafts.

The bridging of the River Trent at Newark by the late 12th century realigned the Great North Road so that it passed through Grantham, bringing traffic to the town as an important stopping place and leading to the development of inns such as &quot;The George&quot; and &quot;The Angel&quot;. By the 16th century, the economy was diverse. The largest sector was the leather trade, employing a quarter of the known workforce; distribution, food, drink and agricultural trades were also important. By that time, clothing and textiles each accounted for less than 10 per cent of the town&#x27;s workers.

==Modern history==
===19th and 20th centuries===
The Lincoln Theatre Company of actors took a 21-year lease on the theatre in 1800. Westgate Hall, which was commissioned as the local corn exchange, was completed in 1852.

The town developed when the railway came. The Nottingham Line (LNER) arrived first in 1850, then the London line (GNR) – the Towns Line from Peterborough to Retford – arrived in 1852. The Boston, Sleaford and Midland Counties Railway arrived in 1857.

Gas lighting appeared in 1833. The corporation became a borough council in 1835. Little Gonerby and Spittlegate were added to the borough in 1879. The town had been in the wapentake of Loveden and included three townships of Manthorpe with Little Gonerby, Harrowby and Spittlegate with Houghton and Walton.

Grantham Golf Club, now defunct, was founded in 1894 and continued until the onset of the Second World War.

Until the 1970s, the housing estates west of the town centre were green fields. Green Hill, on the A52, was literally a green hill. In July 1975 the National Association of Ratepayers&#x27; Action Groups (NARAG) was formed in Grantham by John Wilks, its chairman, as a forerunner of the TaxPayers&#x27; Alliance.

===Military history===

The town has a long military history since the completion of the Old Barracks in 1858.

====Dambusters====
During the Dambuster Raids Royal Air Force missions in May 1943, the RAF Bomber Command&#x27;s No. 5 Group and operation HQ were in St Vincents, a building later owned by Aveling-Barford and housing a district council planning department. It was built by Richard Hornsby in 1865 and lived in by his son. It is now a private house. In 1944 (including D-Day), it was the headquarters for the USAAF&#x27;s Ninth Air Force&#x27;s IX Troop Carrier Command, known as Grantham Lodge.

====RAF Spitalgate====
RAF Spitalgate trained pilots during both world wars, initially as a Royal Flying Corps establishment. It was the first military airfield in Lincolnshire. It has never been an operational fighter or bomber base; although it did see operational service during the 1943 invasion of Europe as a base for American and Polish gliders and parachutists. It officially closed in 1974. The Women&#x27;s Royal Air Force had been there from 1960 until closure. (as RAF Wilmslow was closing due to the imminent ending of National Service), and moved to RAF Hereford (now the home of SAS).

After closure, RAF Spitalgate became the Royal Corps of Transport, later Royal Logistic Corps barracks: Prince William of Gloucester Barracks, named after Prince William of Gloucester. Grantham College used the site&#x27;s two football pitches for their South Lincolnshire Football Development Centre (from September 2004). After closure in 1975 a vehicle test centre was built on the outfield; this closed in 2011. The large mast on the base was part of the BT microwave network.

The Queen&#x27;s Royal Lancers (part of the Royal Armoured Corps) have their RHQ on the base.

====RAF Regiment====
The RAF Regiment was formed north-east of the town in parts of Londonthorpe and Harrowby Without during December 1941 with its headquarters at RAF Belton Park, which is recognised as its birthplace. The Belton Park estate had been a training centre for the Machine Gun Corps from November 1915.

The RAF Regiment reached in excess of 66,000 personnel and during training was housed at RAF Belton Park, the Regiment&#x27;s first depot, RAF Folkingham and RAF North Witham.

===Women&#x27;s police force===
Grantham was first after London to recruit and train women police officers. It was the first provincial force to ask the newly formed Corps of Women&#x27;s Police Volunteers to supply them with occasional policewomen, recognising them as useful for dealing with women and juveniles. In December 1914 Miss Damer Dawson, the Chief of the Corps, came to Grantham to supervise the preliminary work of the women police. Officers stationed there were Miss Allen and Miss Harburn. In 1915, Grantham magistrates swore in Edith Smith, making her the first policewoman in Britain with full powers of arrest.

===Industrial history===
====Richard Hornsby &amp; Sons====
Richard Hornsby and Richard Seaman founded Seaman &amp; Hornsby, Iron Founders and Millwrights, at Spittlegate in Grantham in 1810. The company was renamed Richard Hornsby &amp; Sons when Seaman retired in 1828. Products included ploughs and seed drills.

From 1840 until 1906 the company built steam engines. Thereafter production shifted to oil, petrol and gas engines. It employed 378 men in 1878 and 3,500 in 1914.

In 1905 Richard Hornsby &amp; Sons invented a caterpillar track for a machine using Hornsby&#x27;s oil engines; these engines were developed by Yorkshireman Herbert Akroyd Stuart, from which compression-ignition principle the diesel engine evolved, being manufactured in Grantham from 8 July 1892. Although such engines were not wholly compression-ignition derived, in 1892 a prototype high-pressure version was built at Hornsby&#x27;s, developed by Thomas Henry Barton OBE – later to found Nottingham&#x27;s Barton Transport – whereby ignition was achieved solely through compression; it ran continuously for six hours as the first known diesel engine. In the town, Hornsby&#x27;s built Elsham House, whose grounds became Grantham College) and the Shirley Croft. Its site in Houghton Road was bought from Lord Dysart.

In 1910 Hornsby presented its chain-track vehicle to the British Army, which then bought four caterpillar tractors to tow artillery. At the demonstration, a British transport officer suggested putting armour plating and a gun on a Hornsby tractor, so creating some sort of self-propelled gun. David Roberts, managing director of Hornsby, did not pursue the idea, but later expressed regret at not having done so. Four years later, Hornsby sold the patent for its caterpillar track to the Holt Manufacturing Company of California, USA, for $8,000, having itself sold only one caterpillar tractor commercially. The Holt system was superior to Hornsby&#x27;s, but the Hornsby transmission was what Holt really wanted. Thanks in part to this acquisition, Holt eventually became the successful Caterpillar Inc. Tractor Company. In 1918, Hornsby&#x27;s amalgamated with Rustons as Ruston &amp; Hornsby. In the 1920s the company had its own orchestra in the town; the site was a diesel engine plant. During the Second World War, the company made tanks such as the Matilda at the Grantham factory. Ruston and Hornsby left in 1963 and most of the factory was taken over by a subsidiary, Alfred Wiseman Gears, which itself left in 1968.
====Barford&#x27;s====
The agricultural engine and steamroller manufacturer Aveling and Porter of Rochester, Kent, merged with Barford &amp; Perkins of Peterborough as Aveling-Barford Ltd in 1934, largely with financial help from Ruston &amp; Hornsby, as both firms had entered into administration. The new company took a former site of Hornsbys, naming it the Invicta works, from the motto on the coat of arms of Kent, which translates as &quot;unconquered&quot;; all Aveling &amp; Porter machinery was brought from Kent by rail.

During the 1970s Barford&#x27;s was the town&#x27;s largest employer, with around 2,000 employees. It initially prospered, but declined with the sinking market for large dumper trucks and road rollers. In 1947, its agricultural division, Barfords of Belton, developed the world&#x27;s smallest tractor, the Barford Atom, weighing .

Now Barford Construction Equipment, it makes dumpers for construction sites, being owned by Wordsworth Holdings PLC, owned in turn by the entrepreneur Duncan Wordsworth until it went into administration in March 2010. A restructuring package resulted in ownership transferring to Bowdon Investment Group in May 2010. It is now known as Invictas Engineering.

A trailer company, Crane-Fruehauf, moved into part of the factory from its former home at Dereham, when it went into receivership in early 2005.

====BMARC====
British Manufacture and Research Company (British Marc Ltd or BMARC), in Springfield Road, made munitions, notably the Hispano cannon for the Spitfire and Hurricane from 1937 onwards. It was owned by the Swiss Oerlikon from 1971 until 1988, becoming part of Astra Holdings plc. The firm was bought by British Aerospace in 1992, which then closed the site. It has now been developed as a housing estate. The site&#x27;s former offices are now business units for the Springfield Business Centre. Grantham&#x27;s register office moved there in 2007.

===Former developments===
In 1968 Reads of Liverpool built a canning factory in Springfield Road to serve Melton Mowbray, becoming American Can, then Pechiney (French) in 1988, then Impress (Dutch). It closed in 2006 and was demolished in 2007 to make way for a housing estate. Ransome &amp; Marles Bearing had a ball bearing factory in the town until 1957, when production was moved to Newark.

Mowbray and Co Ltd, a brewery, was bought by J. W. Green of Luton. It was founded in September 1828 and became a public company in 1880. It closed in 1967.

==Economy==
The food industry, together with Grantham Hospital, is currently the largest Grantham employer. Poultry production company Moy Park (formerly Padleys) is at Gonerby Hill Foot; GW Padley bought the site in 1977 from Wolsey, a former garment manufacturer. It acts as a poultry hatchery. Moy Park are owned by Marfrig of São Paulo, with Marfrig&#x27;s European headquarters at Preston Deanery in Hackleton, Northamptonshire. Aviagen Turkeys also has a poultry hatchery further along the B1174 at Gonerby Moor. Brake Bros Ltd has a depot near the Gonerby Moor service station, off B1174.

Fenland Foods (part of Northern Foods) on the Earlesfield Industrial Estate, closed in September 2008 after losing business with Marks and Spencer, its sole customer. On Ellesmere Business park is Väderstad-Verken UK, its parent company based in Väderstad in Sweden and Tecknit Europe (makers of electromagnetic shielding equipment), owned from 2006 by Parker Hannifin based in Cranford, New Jersey.

At Easton, south of Grantham, are two large facilities. One is Norbert Dentressangle, which bought Christian Salvesen plc in November 2007 and maintains the frozen storage and distribution operation which has been at the site since the late 1960s. The other is McCain Foods, which purchased Potato and Allied Services (PAS) in 1991, which had run a potato processing factory on the site since the early 1970s; it has since been extended. There was a third large frozen vegetable processing factory owned and operated by Christian Salvesen; it was sold to Pinguin Foods in August 2007, which closed the facility in December 2008.
GBS has been based in Grantham since May 1975, when known as Chatto, Bodley Head &amp; Cape Services. Chatto &amp; Windus had merged with Jonathan Cape in 1969. The former site was officially opened on 23 September 1975 by Michael Foot MP. Random House was formed in 1987 from a combination of book companies, and in 1990 the site became known as Grantham Book Services. The company won an award in 1992 from the British Book Awards. Next door to GBS and a Gala Bingo is Cathodic Protection, which with BGB Innovation won The Queen&#x27;s Award for Enterprise: International Trade (Export) in 2009.

According to Super Output Area data from the ONS, the least socially deprived area in Lincolnshire is the ward of Stamford St John&#x27;s; Grantham&#x27;s least deprived ward (SKDC) is in the north-east of the town near the former Central School.

===Hotels===
Conference and hospitality facilities in the Grantham area include the Olde Barn Hotel in Marston, the Q-Hotel group Belton Woods Hotel, the Urban Leisure Hotel and various golf clubs. Stoke Rochford Hall won the Les Routiers Wedding Venue of the Year in 2011. The &quot;Griffin Inn&quot; at Irnham won the 2012 Les Routiers B&amp;B of the Year Award. The Eden House Hotel is a historic building built as a mansion in about 1850.

====&quot;Angel and Royal&quot;====

The &quot;Angel and Royal&quot; in the High Street is reputedly the oldest inn in England. The present façade was built about 600 years ago, but the site had already held an inn for 200 years before that, and its origins are older still, as a hostel for the Knights Templar. King John is reputed to have visited with his Royal Court in 1213. A visit by Richard III was the origin of the gold emblem angel holding the King&#x27;s crown over the original archway. Other royal visitors include King Charles I, George IV and Edward VII, when Prince of Wales, leading to the inclusion of &quot;Royal&quot; in the inn&#x27;s name.

===Closures===
Brook Street and Hill Avenue sub-post offices were closed in Grantham in 2008 as part of the Post Office Network Change programme. In August 2010 it was confirmed that the Grantham branch of Marks and Spencer would close, with two other Lincolnshire branches in Skegness and Scunthorpe, due to low sales, although a Marks and Spencer Food Hall re-opened in 2014. The closure met with local protests. Discount department store chain Boyes took over the property in 2012. Haldanes, a chain of about 20 supermarkets based in Ruston Road, went into administration. The former HMRC office at Crown House in Castlegate closed in early 2010, moving to two sites in Lincoln.

== Demography ==

=== Ethnicity and religion ===
According to the 2011 census, Grantham&#x27;s population was 96.3% white; 2.0% Asian or British Asian; 0.6% Black, African, Caribbean or Black British; and 0.9% mixed or multi-ethnic; and 0.2% other. The population is therefore less ethnically diverse than England as a whole, which is 85.4% white; 7.8% Asian or Asian British; 3.5% Black, African, Caribbean or Black British; 2.3% mixed ethnicities; and 1% other. 90.1% of the town&#x27;s population were born in the United Kingdom, compared with 86.2% nationally; 6.1% were born in European Union countries other than the UK and Ireland, of which almost three quarters (4.3% of the total) were born in post-2001 accession states; for England, the figures were 3.7% and 2.0% respectively. 3.4% of the population was born outside the EU, whereas the total for England was 9.4%.

In the 2011 census, 69.4% of Grantham&#x27;s population said they were religious and 23.8% said they did not follow a religion, very similar to England as a whole (68.1% and 24.7% respectively). However, compared to England&#x27;s population, Christians were a higher proportion of the Grantham population (67.6% compared with 59.4%), and all other groups were present at a lower proportion than the national rates. There were 20 Sikhs in Grantham, making up a negligible proportion of the population compared with 0.8% nationally; Hindus composed 0.5% (compared with 1.5% in England), Muslims 0.5% against 5% nationally, Jewish people 0.1% compared with 0.5% for all of England, and Buddhists 0.3% of the town&#x27;s population, contrasting with 0.5% nationally.
=== Household composition, age, health and housing ===

In the 2011 census, 48.5% of the population were male and 51.5% female. Of the population over 16, 47.2% were married, compared to 46.6% in England; 31.1% were single (a smaller proportion than in England where it was 34.6%), 10.9% divorced (compared with 9% in England), 7.3% widowed (slightly higher than the 6.9% for all of England), 3.3% separated and 0.2% in same-sex civil partnerships (2.7% and 0.2% respectively in England). In 2011, there were 17,944 households in the Grantham urban area. It had a slightly lower than average proportion of one-person households (28.8% compared with England&#x27;s figure of 30.2%); most other households consisted of one family, which was more common in Grantham than England as a whole (65.3% of the total, compared with 61.8% in England). This was because there were slightly higher than average rates of cohabiting couples (12% compared with 9.8%), lone parent households (11.2% against 10.6%) and married couples (34.2% compared with 33.2%), but fewer people in multiple and other household types (5.9% compared with 8%).

The 2011 census showed the average age of Grantham&#x27;s population to be in line with the national average; the mean age was 39.3 and the median 39 years, compared with 39.3 and 39 for England. 24.8% of the population was under 20, versus 24% of England&#x27;s, and 22.4% of Grantham&#x27;s population was aged over 60, compared with 22% of England&#x27;s population. In 2011, 80.7% of the population were in good or very good health, compared to 81.4% in England, and 5.4% in very bad or bad health, exactly the same rate as in England. 18% of people (9.3% in 16–64 year-olds) also reported having their day-to-day activities limited, compared with 17.6% in England (8.2% in 16–64 year-olds).

As of 2011, Grantham had similar proportions of people who owned their homes with or without a mortgage (62.2%) than in England (63.3%) and who rented socially (17.1% compared with 17.7% nationally); there was a slightly higher rate of private renting (18.8% compared with 16.8%) while owner-occupiers were more likely to be mortgaged than in England as a whole (55.7% of them, compared with 51.8%). The proportion of household spaces which are detached or semi-detached houses is higher than average (27.8% and 33.6%, compared with 22.3% and 30.7%), while the proportion of households living in apartments, flats and maisonettes is much lower (13.1% against 22.1%). The proportion of terraced household spaces is similar (25.4% compared with 24.5%).

=== Workforce ===

In 2011, 72.7% of Grantham&#x27;s residents aged between 16 and 74 were economically active, compared with 69.9% for all of England. 65.6% were in employment, compared with 62.1% nationally. The proportion in full-time employment is also comparatively high, at 42.7% (against 38.6% for England). The proportion of retirees was in line with the national figure, at 13.9% compared with 13.7% for England, as was the proportion of long-term sick or disabled (3.9%, compared with England&#x27;s 4%); 1.6% of people were long-term unemployed, compared with 1.7% in all of England. The 2011 census revealed that the most common industry residents worked in were: wholesale and retail trade and repair of motor vehicles (19.1%), manufacturing (13.9%), and human health and social work (12.9%). The latter category was in line with the national average, but retail and manufacturing were overrepresented compared with England (where the proportions were 15.9% and 8.8%, respectively). Most other industries were under-represented comparatively, with financial services (2.4% versus 4.4% nationally), information and communication (2.0% against 4.1% nationally), and professional, scientific and technical activities (3.9% compared with 6.7%) especially so.

Compared with the whole of England, the workforce had modestly higher proportions of people in elementary occupations (14.4% compared with 11.1%), process, plant and machinery operative roles (10.9% against 7.2%), skilled trades (12.8% versus 11.4%), and caring and other service occupations (10.5% against 9.3%). There was a much lower proportion of people in professional, associate professional, technical, administrative and secretarial occupations than in England as a whole (combined 32.6% versus 41.7% of England&#x27;s population aged 16–74), principally driven by a lower proportion of full professionals (11.1% compared with 17.5%).

The proportion of residents aged 16 to 74 with no qualifications was 23.7%, only slightly higher than the national figure (22.5%); the proportion of residents whose highest qualification is at Level 1 or 2 (equivalent to GCSEs) is higher than in the national population, but 19.8% of Grantham&#x27;s population have a qualification at Level 4 or above (Certificate of Higher Education upwards, including graduates), compared with 27.4% nationally.

=== Deprivation ===
The government&#x27;s Indices of Multiple Deprivation (2019) show that Grantham contains both dense pockets of deprivation and areas of substantial affluence. The county council note that high levels of deprivation in parts of the town contrast with the less deprived rural hinterlands around it. A statistical area covering part of the Earlesfield estate falls within the most deprived 10% of areas in the country; it is the most deprived place in South Kesteven. Other parts of Earlesfield and the Cherry Orchard suburb fall within the most deprived 20% of areas nationally, while much of the central urban area also falls below the national median and the top five most deprived areas in the district are all parts of Grantham. However, the Green Hill and Spinney housing estates and parts of Gonerby Hill Foot and Manthorpe fall within the least deprived decile nationally; one of them is in the least 10 deprived places in South Kesteven.

==Transport==
===Rail===

Grantham railway station is served by the London–Edinburgh East Coast Main Line, between Peterborough and Newark Northgate). It is joined by the Nottingham to Skegness Line (Poacher Line). Liverpool–Norwich trains also call at Grantham. Electric trains began running in October 1988. Transport links to Nottingham and Peterborough attract some commuters. The town&#x27;s grammar schools also attract pupils from Radcliffe on Trent, Bingham, Newark and even Retford via the train. Grantham is the best-served station in Lincolnshire, although after October 1970, most of Lincolnshire&#x27;s branch lines were closed. Before October 1970 the connection from King&#x27;s Cross to Lincoln Central was through Grantham and followed the A607 via Leadenham. After that date, London-Lincoln trains still passed through Grantham, but then continued up the main line to Newark Northgate, where the trains branched off to Lincoln St Marks Railway Station via a new curve just north of Newark.

In 1906 a rail accident killed 14 people.

On 3 July 1938 &quot;Mallard&quot; broke the world speed record for steam locomotives, at , on the slight downward grade of Stoke Bank south of Grantham on the East Coast Main Line.

===Road===
The Great North Road was routed through the town in 1196. The turnpike to the north reached the town in 1725, that to Stamford in 1739, to Nottingham in 1758, and that to Melton in 1780.

The A1 main road from London to Edinburgh runs past the town, which was bypassed in 1962. The A52 linking Nottingham and the East Coast was diverted from High Street onto the Inner Relief Road, Sankt Augustin Way, in 1998. Wharf Road and London Road junction is still a busy junction on the A607 for Lincoln. Motorway-style Grantham North Services, at the north end of Grantham bypass, is on a new junction which replaced a roundabout in May 2008.

Grantham, with Stamford, had been earmarked for a bypass before the war in 1939. There were 60 serious accidents a year, with three to four deaths. After the war, on 21 November 1945, there was a meeting at the Guildhall about the proposed bypass of the London-Edinburgh-Thurso trunk road for Grantham and Great Gonerby. This was the first enquiry into a trunk road scheme in the country after the war. The proposed route followed the current line, from Little Ponton to College Farm, except it was to be a single carriageway road.

On 8 February 1960, it was announced that a bypass would be built, including the route south to the B6403 at Colsterworth. Robert McGregor and Sons Ltd of Manchester would build the road for £1,856,009. (The company went on to build Newark bypass in 1964.) The bridges were built by Simon Carves of Cheadle Hulme. It was formally opened on 10 October 1962 by James Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughby, 3rd Earl of Ancaster, then the Lord Lieutenant of Lincolnshire (from 1950 to 1975). He was married to the (only) daughter of Nancy Astor.

Various attempts at one-way systems in Grantham have been introduced, but traffic delays are still commonplace. Low railway bridges also add to traffic difficulties, with lorries becoming stuck under them. Many promises have been made by the local council for a Grantham bypass road. The latest, the Grantham Southern Relief Road, has been in planning since 2007. Phase one of the project was completed in 2016 which provided access to some commercial facilitates and a new roundabout on the B1174. Phase Two, started in October 2019, involves a new grade separated junction on the A1 and is due to be opened on 20 December 2022. Phase three for the main stretch of road started in 2021 and due to be completed by 2023. In July 2022 it was found that ground conditions at a new viaduct were for as expected, and the project would be delayed as the viaduct would need to be redesigned.

===Waterways===
Grantham was once linked to Nottingham by the Grantham Canal. It is possible to walk and cycle along the canal starting from Grantham near the A1/A607 intersection (opposite &quot;The Farrier&quot;).

The River Witham runs through Grantham. It has a riverside walk linking Dysart Park and Wyndham Park, on which is a view of Spittlegate Mill. The walk passes Inner Street allotment and the rear of Sainsbury&#x27;s car park, access to which is by a pedestrian bridge at the end of College Street. There are other footbridges with views of the river and its weirs. Swans, ducks and trout are among the wildlife that can be seen along the river.

==Education==

Grantham College, a further education college for the district, opened in 1948, for those not attending school sixth forms. It has a satellite site at Sleaford, Sleaford College. Since September 2008 the Walton Academy in Kitty Briggs Lane near Harlaxton Road has run post-16 courses. In September 2019, the school had its first intake of male students in the lower school, making the former all-girls school co-educational.

Two notable schools in the district are Kesteven and Grantham Girls&#x27; School and The King&#x27;s Grammar School. Both have large sixth forms and eminent past students. Britain&#x27;s first female prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, attended Kesteven and Grantham, and Isaac Newton famously attended The King&#x27;s. Both have remained single-sex up to the age of 16.

In 1970, Kesteven County Council (based in Sleaford) announced plans to turn the grammar schools into co-educational comprehensives for ages of 11–16 and leave Grantham College the only sixth form for the town. Later it was proposed to create two sixth-form colleges from one of the grammar schools. Other parts of Kesteven became comprehensive but responsibility for education passed to Lincolnshire under the local government reorganization of 1974, and both schools stayed as grammar schools. Ex-pupil Margaret Thatcher was education secretary at the time. The governors of the King&#x27;s School delayed the process in July 1973, and in January 1975 a plan to make Grantham comprehensive was voted against by the county council, having been approved by the council&#x27;s own education committee.

On 1 August 2011 The King&#x27;s School ended its long relationship with the local elected authorities and the town of Grantham, by converting to a selective academy. It remains a selective boys&#x27; school and has kept its name and logo.

All four secondary modern schools are on the outskirts of Grantham. Only three of the six secondary schools are co-educational.

The Priory Ruskin Academy (formerly Central Technology &amp; Sports College) is a co-educational school sited near Manthorpe, this school is part of the wider Priory Federation, which has multiple schools in Lincolnshire and Leicestershire. The Priory Ruskin Academy has a sixth form which open in 2013 at the old Church High School site.

In Gorse Lane is Grantham Preparatory School, an independent school preparing entrants for the 11-plus examination. Another private primary school is Dudley House School. Near St Wulfram&#x27;s on Castlegate is the National Church of England Junior School, built in 1859, and a feeder school for the town&#x27;s grammar schools.

The Blessed Hugh More School, a Catholic secondary school, closed in 1989.

==Governance==

Grantham once lay within the ancient Winnibriggs and Threo wapentake in the Soke of Grantham.

In 1894 Grantham became a municipal borough which became part of the administrative county of the Parts of Kesteven in 1889. On 1 April 1974 the district and parish were abolished and became part of South Kesteven non-metropolitan district in the non-metropolitan county of Lincolnshire. No successor parish was formed so it became unparished. A charter trustees was formed to preserve the borough status of the former borough. 

On 1 April 2024 Grantham was parished and the responsibilities of the charter trustees were transferred to the parish. The parish council is named Grantham Town Council and is made up of 22 councillors representing seven wards: Arnoldfield ward, Barrowby Gate ward, Earlesfield ward, Harrowby ward, Springfield ward, St Vincent&#x27;s ward and St Wulfram&#x27;s ward. Each elects three councillors except St Vincent&#x27;s which elects four. These wards are similar to, but not identical with, the district wards used for election to South Kesteven District Council.

Politically the town belongs to the Grantham and Bourne constituency, represented in Parliament by Conservative Party Member of Parliament (MP) Gareth Davies, elected at the 4 July 2024 general election.

Two of Grantham&#x27;s MPs in recent years, Joe Godber and Douglas Hogg, have been Secretary of State for Agriculture.

Before 1974, the local area was represented by Grantham Borough Council, based at Grantham Guildhall on St Peters Hill, and West Kesteven Rural District, based in Sandon Close. The local authority is now Grantham Town Council.

The Grantham Charter Trustees had responsibility for ceremonial functions remaining from the former Grantham Borough Council. They include civic ceremonies, annual commemorative events, hosting official visits and maintaining the town&#x27;s regalia. The Charter Trustees consist of the Grantham District Councillors on South Kesteven District Council. Two members of these are elected annually as Mayor and Deputy Mayor of Grantham.

==Religious sites==
Grantham has places of worship of various denominations. The main local landmark is the parish church of St Wulfram&#x27;s, which has the sixth highest spire among English churches, at . It is the second tallest church in Lincolnshire after St James&#x27; Church in Louth. It also holds England&#x27;s first public library, dating from 1598, when Francis Trigge, rector of Welbourn, gave £100 for a small chained library of books for the clergy and &quot;literate laity&quot; of Grantham; 250 of the original volumes remain in a small room above the South Porch. From October 1974 the church was permanently floodlit at night.

The Anglican church in the New Somerby district, dedicated to St Anne and seating about 350, was erected as a mission church in 1884 and built of iron. A mission church, dedicated to St Saviour and seating about 150, was built of brick in the Little Gonerby district in 1884. The church of St John the Evangelist was built of stone in the Spittlegate district in 1840–1841. It seated about 1,100. Today the Deanery of Grantham still includes the churches of St Anne and St John the Evangelist amongst its 18 churches. The current suffragan Bishop of Grantham is Nicholas Chamberlain; his official residence is in Long Bennington.

The Catholic Church of St Mary the Immaculate stands in North Parade. Grantham Baptist Church is located in Wharf Road. Grantham Christchurch (LEP) Church (United Reformed Church) is located in Finkin Street. Harrowby Lane Methodist Church dates from the late 1920s. Finkin Street Methodist Church was a Wesleyan Methodist chapel built in the 1840s and attended by Margaret Thatcher.

Plans in 2014 to construct an Islamic cultural centre in the town created controversy, including protests from right-wing groups.

== Culture and amenities ==

=== Amenities ===
Wyndham Park has two children&#x27;s play areas. There is an open-air paddling pool, football pitch and cafe. Dysart Park has a paddling pool and safe play area for children under six, a green for football and a bandstand. Indoor amenities for children include a swimming pool at the Meres Leisure Centre.

Belton House is a popular National Trust site with events for children, a play area, train rides, picnic area and woodland walk.

=== Nature ===

Grantham and its surrounding area host peregrine falcons, which have in recent years roosted in the bell tower of St Wulfram&#x27;s Church. Grantham is surrounded by rolling countryside and woodland, such as nearby Ponton Park Wood, which has walks and views of woods and farmland. To the north-east there are the attractive gardens and the magnificent deer park of the National Trust&#x27;s Belton House. Adjacent are Londonthorpe and Alma Park Woods, both owned by the Woodland Trust. The former comprises young woodland and open areas of wild flowers, while Alma Park has mature woodland on its steep limestone scarp and offers views over the town and the surrounding area.

To the south of the town, between Little Ponton and Saltersford, the River Witham flows through marshes and water meadows that support a variety of plant species, including vetches, cowslip, &quot;Primula veris&quot;, Lady&#x27;s bedstraw &quot;Galium verum&quot;, and orchids, including the southern marsh orchid, and wildlife, including grey herons, mallards, greylag geese, water vole, and the now critically endangered white clawed crayfish. The area has notable populations of dragonflies, especially &quot;Aeshna grandis&quot;, &quot;Anax imperator&quot;, &quot;Libellula quadrimaculata&quot; and &quot;Calopteryx splendens&quot;, which are also found on Grantham Canal as it runs through The Vale of Belvoir to the west of the town. Wildlife can also be found in the town&#x27;s Wyndham and Dysart Parks.

The Woodland Trust is based in Dysart Road and has been in Grantham since 1978; its new £6 million building, on the opposite side of the road, opened in November 2010. The building, designed by Atelier One and Max Fordham, has won several architectural awards.

=== Gingerbread biscuits ===
The town is known for gingerbread biscuits, first made in 1740 by a baker, William Eggleston. He produced a biscuit called Grantham Whetstones. Whetstones were a rusk-like dry biscuit enjoyed locally and by coach drivers who would stop in Grantham to change horses while travelling along the Great North Road. According to folk belief, Egglestone was baking whetstones in his dimly lit kitchen one morning when he mistook one ingredient for another, resulting in a ginger-like biscuit to emerge from the oven. The mistake was a huge success and the biscuit became established as Grantham Gingerbread, known as a white gingerbread, as it is not made with molasses or black treacle. This has a delicate ginger flavour, rich in butter, with a domed top and a crackled surface. The centre is hollow like a honeycomb.

=== Media ===
Grantham&#x27;s local newspaper, the &quot;Grantham Journal&quot;, first went on sale in 1854 as &quot;The Grantham Journal of Useful, Instructive and Entertaining Knowledge and Monthly Advertiser&quot;. It was founded by Henry Escritt, a Yorkshireman by birth, who moved to the area in 1861. The &quot;Journal&quot; is owned by Iliffe Media (formerly by Johnston Press), and has a sister newspaper in Melton Mowbray, the &quot;Melton Times&quot;. In the 1960s and earlier it produced the &quot;Melton Journal&quot; and &quot;Rutland Journal&quot;, both versions of the main paper.

David Wood (1914–1990), former political editor of &quot;The Times&quot; (working under Sir William Haley), started out at the &quot;Grantham Journal&quot;.

Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC East Midlands and BBC Yorkshire and Lincolnshire on BBC One, and by ITV Central and ITV Yorkshire on ITV1.

Radio stations that broadcast to the town are BBC Radio Lincolnshire and Greatest Hits Radio Lincolnshire. Grantham also has a full-time community radio station, Gravity FM. The station has its own studios in Riverside Walk, on the western side of Grantham College. It is operated by local volunteers.

==Sport==
===Football===
Grantham Town Football Club, the local football team, currently plays in the Northern Premier League. It was founded in 1874 and now uses the 7,500-capacity (covered 1,950, seats 750) South Kesteven Sports Stadium (although average attendances are well below that). The ground also doubles as the town&#x27;s athletics stadium (one of only three in Lincolnshire), next to the Grantham Meres Leisure Centre on &quot;Trent Road&quot;.

Harrowby United F.C. in Dickens Road, near the Church of the Ascension, is in the UCL (United Countries League) Division One league.

Grantham is also the birthplace of Leeds United striker Patrick Bamford

===Rugby Union===
Kesteven Rugby Football Club was founded in 1947 and plays at Woodnook, off the B6403. It fields two men&#x27;s teams, a ladies XV and many junior sides.

===Hockey===
Grantham Hockey Club, which fielded men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s team in league hockey, played at the Meres Leisure Centre, on an astro-turf pitch directly behind the football stadium. In 2011, the men ended a long spell in the Midlands League, moving to the East League, successfully earning promotion to Division 5 (North West). Their story is documented in &quot;1,309 Days Later&quot;, the title a reference to a no-win spell between 2006 and 2009.

===Bowls===
Grantham bowls players have represented the indoor and outdoor clubs in county and national competitions. Indoor club players Martin Pulling, Dion Auckland, Ian Johnson, and former England U25 player Mathew Orrey, have played for the England squad.

===Table tennis===
In 1993 and 1994 international team matches were held in Grantham, at the South Kesteven Table Tennis Centre, which was opened in January 1992 by Johnny Leach. Grantham College have a Table Tennis Academy.

==Twinning==

== Landmarks ==


Grantham House is to the east of the church, and a National Trust property.

Grantham has the country&#x27;s only &quot;living&quot; public house sign: a beehive of South African bees situated outside the &quot;Beehive Inn&quot; since 1830.

Grantham Guildhall on St Peter&#x27;s Hill is now the Guildhall Arts Centre. Edith Smith Way is a road next to the Arts Centre, named after England&#x27;s first policewoman. Mary Allen and Ellen F. Harburn reported for duty on 27 November 1914. Mary Allen was a former suffragette and had been previously arrested outside the House of Commons and later went on to be the commandant of the UK&#x27;s women&#x27;s police force from the 1920s up to 1940. She helped to set up women&#x27;s police forces in other countries, including Germany. Edith Smith became the first female with powers of arrest in August 1915.

Sandon Road is named after Viscount Sandon, also the Earl of Harrowby. The first person with the title was Dudley Ryder, 1st Earl of Harrowby; a road is also named after him. He bought Harrowby Hall in 1754. The current owner is Dudley Ryder, 8th Earl of Harrowby.

The &quot;Blue Pig&quot;, one of many &quot;Blue&quot; pubs, stands in Vine Street, near the Church of St Wulfram. The building is one of probably only four remaining Tudor buildings in the town and a survivor of the disastrous fires of the 1660s. It was first mentioned as an inn in a trade directory of 1846, when the landlord was one Richard Summersby. The property was then owned by the Manners family (giving the derivation of Blue in the name).
 The nearby &quot;George Hotel&quot; (known as St Peter&#x27;s Place, now the George Shopping Centre) was mentioned in Charles Dickens&#x27;s novel Nicholas Nickleby. Many of the town&#x27;s property and industrial estates have been owned by Buckminster Trust Estates since the time of the Earl of Dysart.

To the west of the town near the A607 is Baird&#x27;s maltings, owned by Moray Firth until 1999 and before that by R &amp; W Paul. Other maltings have been converted for residential use, such as Riverview Maltings near the river, formerly owned by Lee &amp; Grinling&#x27;s.

Grantham JobCentre was opened on 24 June 1975 by local MP Joseph Godber. Grantham and District Hospital stands next to the Priory Ruskin Academy on the A607 in the north of the town. The maternity unit opened in August 1972 is now a midwife-staffed unit.

Nearby are many historic houses including 17th-century Belton House (the Brownlows), early 19th-century Harlaxton Manor (the Gregorys), Stoke Rochford Hall (owned by the Turnors, and since 1978 a training centre of the NUT), and the 19th-century Belvoir Castle (the Manners), in Leicestershire. Much of the property and land to the south-west of the area is owned by the two estates of Belvoir and Buckminster. Further to the south of Stoke Rochford are the Cholmeleys of Easton Hall.

On 15 May 2022 a high bronze statue of Margaret Thatcher, dressed in the full ceremonial robes of the House of Lords, by sculptor Douglas Jennings and costing £300,000, was installed. Located on St Peter&#x27;s Hill Green, close to the Grantham Museum, it was placed on a tall plinth to discourage vandalism, but was attacked with eggs within two hours of its unveiling. It has since been vandalised on four further occasions.

<text>Franz Anton Beckenbauer (; 11 September 1945 – 7 January 2024) was a German professional football player, manager, and official. Nicknamed (&quot;the Emperor&quot;), he is widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, and is one of nine players to have won the FIFA World Cup, the European Champions Cup, and the Ballon d&#x27;Or. Beckenbauer was a versatile player who started out as a midfielder, but made his name as a centre-half. He is often credited as having invented the role of the modern sweeper ().

Twice named European Footballer of the Year, Beckenbauer appeared 103 times for West Germany, playing in three FIFA World Cups and two European Championships. He is one of three men, along with Brazil&#x27;s Mário Zagallo and France&#x27;s Didier Deschamps, to have won the World Cup as a player and as a manager; he lifted the World Cup trophy as captain in 1974, and repeated the feat as a manager in 1990. He was the first captain to lift the World Cup and European Championship at the international level and the European Cup at the club level. He was named in the World Team of the 20th Century in 1998, the FIFA World Cup Dream Team in 2002, the Ballon d&#x27;Or Dream Team in 2020, the IFFHS All-time Men&#x27;s Dream Team in 2021, and in 2004, was listed in the FIFA 100 of the world&#x27;s greatest living players.

At club level with Bayern Munich, Beckenbauer won the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup in 1967 and three consecutive European Cups from 1974 to 1976. The latter feat made him the first player to win three European Cups as captain of his club. He became team manager and later president of Bayern Munich. After two spells with the New York Cosmos he was inducted into the US National Soccer Hall of Fame.

Beckenbauer led Germany&#x27;s successful bid to host the 2006 FIFA World Cup and chaired the organizing committee. He worked as a pundit for Sky Germany, and for 34 years as a columnist for the tabloid &quot;Bild&quot;, both until 2016. Beginning August 2016, he was investigated for fraud and money laundering in connection with the 2006 World Cup. The investigation was closed without a verdict in 2020 as the statute of limitations expired.

==Early life==
Franz Anton Beckenbauer was born on 11 September 1945 at a clinic in the Maxvorstadt borough of Munich, the second son of postal-worker Franz Beckenbauer Sr. and his wife Antonie (née Hupfauf). He was the youngest of two children, his older brother Walter having been born in 1941, and grew up in the working-class district of Giesing. Beckenbauer was raised as a Catholic, and was an altar boy in the Munich-Obergiesing parish. Despite his father&#x27;s cynicism about the game, Beckenbauer started playing football at the age of nine with the youth team of SC Munich &#x27;06 in 1954.

Originally a centre-forward, Beckenbauer idolised 1954 FIFA World Cup winner Fritz Walter and supported local side 1860 Munich, then the pre-eminent team in the city, despite their relegation from the top league, the &quot;Oberliga Süd,&quot; in the 1950s. &quot;It was always my dream to play for them&quot; he would later confirm. That he joined the Bayern Munich youth team in 1959, rather than that of his favourites&#x27; 1860 Munich, was the result of a contentious Under-14 youth tournament in nearby Neubiberg. Beckenbauer and his teammates were aware that their SC Munich &#x27;06 club lacked the finance to continue running its youth sides, and had determined to join 1860 Munich as a group upon the tournament&#x27;s conclusion. Fortune decreed that SC Munich and 1860 would meet in the final and a series of niggles during the match eventually resulted in a physical confrontation between Beckenbauer and the opposing centre-half. The ill-feeling this engendered had a strong effect upon Beckenbauer and his teammates, who decided to join Bayern&#x27;s youth side rather than the team they had recently come to blows with.

In 1963, at the age of 18, Beckenbauer was engulfed by controversy when it was revealed that his then girlfriend was pregnant and that he had no intention of marrying her; he was banned from the West Germany national youth team by the DFB and only readmitted after the intervention of the side&#x27;s coach Dettmar Cramer.

==Club career==
Beckenbauer made his debut with Bayern in a Bundesliga promotion play-off match on the left wing against FC St. Pauli on 6 June 1964. In his first season in the Regionalliga Süd (&quot;Regional League South&quot;, then the second level in Germany), 1964–65, the team won the league and was eventually promoted to the Bundesliga.

Bayern soon became a force in the new German league, winning the German Cup in 1966–67 and achieving European success in the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup in 1967. Beckenbauer became team captain for the 1968–69 season and led his club to their first league title. He began experimenting with the sweeper &quot;(libero)&quot; role around this time, refining the role into a new form and becoming perhaps the greatest exponent of the attacking sweeper game.

During Beckenbauer&#x27;s tenure at Bayern Munich, the club won three league championships in a row from 1972 to 1974 and also a hat-trick of European Cup wins (1974–76) which earned the club the honour of keeping the trophy permanently.

Beginning in 1968, Beckenbauer was called &quot;&quot; () by fans and the media. The following anecdote is told (even during his lifetime by Beckenbauer himself) to explain the origin: On the occasion of a friendly game of Bayern Munich in Vienna, Austria, Beckenbauer posed for a photo session right beside a bust of the former Austrian emperor Franz Joseph I. The media called him () afterwards, and soon he was just called . According to a report in the German newspaper , this explanation is untrue, though very popular. According to the report, Beckenbauer fouled his opposite number, Reinhard Libuda from Schalke 04, in the cup final on 14 June 1969. Disregarding the fans&#x27; hooting, Beckenbauer took the ball into the opposite part of the field, where he balanced the ball in front of the upset fans for half a minute. Libuda was commonly called (), so the press looked for an even more exalted moniker and invented .

In 1977, Beckenbauer accepted a lucrative contract to play in the North American Soccer League (NASL) with the New York Cosmos, playing alongside Pelé in his debut season. He played with the Cosmos for four seasons up to 1980, and the team won the Soccer Bowl on three occasions (1977, 1978, 1980).

Beckenbauer retired after a two-year spell with Hamburger SV in Germany (1980–82) with the win of the Bundesliga title that year and one final season with the New York Cosmos in 1983.

==International career==
Beckenbauer won 103 caps and scored 14 goals for West Germany. He made his debut in a World Cup qualification match against Sweden in Stockholm on 26 September 1965, with West Germany winning 2–1. Beckenbauer scored his first goals for the West Germany national team against the Netherlands on 23 March 1966 at De Kuip, Rotterdam; he scored twice as West Germany won 4–2. He was a member of the World Cup squads that finished runners-up in 1966, third place in 1970, and champions in 1974, while also being named to the tournament all-star team in all three editions. He also won the 1972 European Football Championship and finished as runners-up in the 1976 edition. Beckenbauer became the most capped player for the German national team in 1973, he beat Uwe Seeler&#x27;s record of 72 matches and was overtaken by Lothar Matthäus in 1993.

===1966 World Cup===
Beckenbauer appeared in his first World Cup in 1966, playing every match. In his first World Cup match, against Switzerland, he scored twice in a 5–0 win. West Germany won their group, and then beat Uruguay 4–0 in quarter-finals, with Beckenbauer scoring the second goal in the 70th minute.

In the semi-finals, the Germans faced the USSR; Helmut Haller opened the scoring, while Beckenbauer netted the second goal of the match, his fourth goal of the tournament, thus contributing to a 2–1 win and helping West Germany advance to the Wembley Stadium final against hosts England.

He and Bobby Charlton were instructed by their respective managers to man-mark each other, thus cancelling out each other&#x27;s play. England went on to win the final and the Jules Rimet Trophy in extra time. Still, Beckenbauer was nominated the Best Young Player of the tournament, while also being awarded the Bronze Boot, together with Ferenc Bene, Geoff Hurst and Valeriy Porkujan.

===1970 World Cup===
West Germany won their first three matches before facing England in the second round in a rematch of the 1966 final. The English were ahead 2–0 in the second half, but a spectacular goal by Beckenbauer in the 69th minute helped the Germans recover and equalise before the end of normal time and win the match in extra time. West Germany advanced to the semi-finals to face Italy, in what would be known as the Game of the Century. He dislocated his shoulder after being fouled, but he was not deterred from continuing in the match, as his side had already used their two permitted substitutions. He stayed on the field carrying his dislocated arm in a sling. The result of this match was 4–3 (after extra time) in favour of the Italians. Germany defeated Uruguay 1–0 for third place.

===1972 European championship===
Beckenbauer became captain of the national side in 1971. In 1972, West Germany won the European Championship, beating the Soviet Union 3–0 in the final.

===1974 World Cup===
The 1974 World Cup was hosted by West Germany and Beckenbauer led his side to victory, including a hard-fought 2–1 win over the hotly favoured Netherlands side featuring Johan Cruyff. Beckenbauer and his fellow defenders man-marked Cruyff so well that the Dutch were never quite able to put their &quot;Total Football&quot; into full use.

Beckenbauer became the first captain to lift the new FIFA World Cup Trophy after Brazil had retained the Jules Rimet Trophy in 1970. This also gave West Germany the distinction of being the first European national team to win the European Championship and World Cup consecutively (two other countries have done it since: France in 2000, and Spain in 2010).

===1976 European Championship===
In the 1976 competition, West Germany again reached the final, where they lost on penalties to Czechoslovakia. Beckenbauer was selected in the Team of the Tournament.

Beckenbauer retired from international football in 1977, at the age of 31, following his move to New York Cosmos.

==Style of play==
A complete player, Beckenbauer is regarded by many critics and fans as being one of the greatest players of all time and as Germany&#x27;s greatest player ever. Considered to have revolutionized the role of a sweeper in football, Beckenbauer was not only brilliant at helping out his fellow defenders and goalkeeper in their duties in protecting the goal from the opponents, but was also equally capable of offensive duties, often being the driving force of said attacks, with his passing range and elegant technique allowing him to operate as a playmaker for Bayern Munich and the West Germany national team. Beckenbauer was also a master of the one-two tactic, in which he&#x27;d pass the ball to a teammate and then go past an opponent to collect the ball.

Earlier in his career, Beckenbauer played as a midfielder, and was partnered with 1. FC Köln playmaker Wolfgang Overath in a two-man midfield for the West Germany national team in the 1966 and 1970 World Cups.

Throughout his career, Beckenbauer stood out for his leadership and fair play, having never received a red card during his time at Bayern.

==Managerial career==
On his return to Germany, Beckenbauer was appointed manager of the West Germany national team to replace Jupp Derwall on 12 September 1984. He took the team all the way to the final of the 1986 World Cup, where they lost to the Diego Maradona inspired Argentina.

In 1990, before the German reunification, Beckenbauer managed the last Germany national football team without East German players in a World Cup, winning the final 1–0, against Argentina, in a rematch of the previous World Cup final. Beckenbauer was one of three men (with Mario Zagallo, and Didier Deschamps) to have won the Cup as player and as manager, and he is the first man and one of only two (with Didier Deschamps) to have won the title as team captain as well as manager.

Beckenbauer then moved into club management and accepted a job with Olympique de Marseille in 1990, but left the club midway through his first season. Marseille won the 1990–91 French championship and ended runner-up of the 1990–91 European Cup under the management of his successor, Raymond Goethals.

From 28 December 1993 until 30 June 1994, and then from 29 April 1996 until 30 June of the same year, Beckenbauer managed Bayern Munich. His brief spells in charge saw him collect two further honours – the Bundesliga title in 1994 and the UEFA Cup in 1996.

In 1994, Beckenbauer took on the role of club president at Bayern, and much of the success in the following years has been credited to his astute management. Following the club&#x27;s decision to change from an association to a limited company, he was chairman of the advisory as of since the beginning of 2002. He stepped down as president of Bayern in 2009, being succeeded by long-time general manager Uli Hoeneß.

In 1998, Beckenbauer became vice-president of the German Football Association. At the end of the 1990s, Beckenbauer headed the successful bid by Germany to organize the 2006 FIFA World Cup. He chaired the organizational committee for the World Cup and was a commentator for the Bild-Zeitung.

==Financial controversies==
===FIFA inquiries and ban===
In June 2014, Beckenbauer was banned by FIFA Ethics Committee for 90 days from any football-related activity for allegedly refusing to cooperate with an inquiry into corruption dealing with the allocation of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar. He protested the ban, as he had requested the questions that were put to him be in German and in writing. The ban was lifted after Beckenbauer agreed to participate in FIFA&#x27;s inquiry. In February 2016, Beckenbauer was fined CHF 7,000 and warned by FIFA Ethics Committee for failing to cooperate with the inquiry in 2014.

In March 2016, the Ethics Committee opened formal proceedings against Beckenbauer regarding the awarding of the 2006 FIFA World Cup to Germany.

In the course of investigations, Swiss officials also found evidence of a payment of at least 1.7 million euro, allegedly from the South African Football Association, to Beckenbauer, via Gibraltar. It was claimed this was a consultancy fee for helping secure the hosting of the 2010 World Cup for South Africa.

It also emerged that Beckenbauer, who had claimed to be working for free for the World Cup Organizing Committee of the German Football Association (DFB), had been paid 5.5 million from the income of a sponsorship deal that the German Football Association had made with betting company Oddset in 2004. No tax had been paid in Germany on the money until the authorities chanced upon it in 2010. Beckenbauer stated he had already paid the tax due on his share in Austria, where he was tax resident.

In 2021, FIFA closed its ethics inquiry against Beckenbauer as the statute of limitations expired.

===Alleged bribe from Russia===
In October 2019, Black Mirror Leaks published email correspondence of Russian member of Parliament, Sergey Kapkov, where Beckenbauer and his adviser, Fedor Radmann, were named as recipients of €3 million for their votes in favour of Russia as host of the 2018 World Cup. Both allegedly received an additional €1.5 million in success fees after the 2018 cup was allocated to Russia.

===Tax issues===
In 1976, Beckenbauer paid 1.6 million D-Marks in back taxes. He had relied on advice to shelter income from tax using a financial structure which was later found to be invalid. In this instance, he was not fined. He claimed in his memoir that the Bavarian Finance Minister Ludwig Huber, who had attended Beckenbauer&#x27;s 30th birthday party in 1975, had given him tax advice, including about moving to Switzerland. Huber was also president of the state-owned bank and approved a loan of 1 million D-Marks to enable him to pay the back-taxes.

In 1982, Beckenbauer moved to Austria, where tax rates were lower. In 1987, Beckenbauer was fined by Swiss authorities for evading taxes while living in Switzerland between 1977 and 1980.

==Media==
During his playing career, Beckenbauer&#x27;s popularity was such that he was included as a character in Monty Python&#x27;s sketch &quot;The Philosophers&#x27; Football Match&quot; as the sole genuine player and a &quot;surprise inclusion&quot; to the German team. During the match, between famous Greek and German philosophers, instead of actually playing football, the &quot;players&quot; walk in circles contemplating philosophy, while &quot;asking questions&quot;, a popular phrase used by English football commentators, much to the confusion of Beckenbauer.

In a 2013 advertisement for South Korean company Samsung, Beckenbauer appeared as the manager of a Galaxy XI of football players from around the globe, and hands the captain&#x27;s armband to Lionel Messi. Beckenbauer features in EA Sports&#x27; &quot;FIFA&quot; video game series; he was included in the &quot;FIFA 15&quot; Ultimate Team Legends.

==Personal life==
Beckenbauer was married three times and had five children, one of whom, Stephan, was a professional footballer, who died from a brain tumour on 31 July 2015, at the age of 46. Stephan&#x27;s son Luca is also a professional footballer, playing for SV Wacker Burghausen in the Regionalliga Bayern.

A practicing Catholic, Beckenbauer believed that one&#x27;s soul travels after death.

After appearing in an advertisement for a mobile phone company, Beckenbauer specifically requested the number 0176 / 666666 for his mobile phone. He was soon called by several men who thought it was a phone sex number (in German, &quot;6&quot; translates to &quot;sechs&quot;, sounding similar to &quot;sex&quot;).

Beckenbauer became an honorary consul of Kosovo in 2011, to help promote Kosovo&#x27;s campaign for membership of UEFA and FIFA.

In 2016 and 2017, Beckenbauer had cardiac surgery, and received an artificial hip in 2018.

=== Charity work ===
At the end of his career as a Bundesliga player, Beckenbauer established the foundation &quot;Franz-Beckenbauer-Stiftung&quot; in Hamburg on 15 May 1982 to support the disabled, the sick and people in need. He gave the foundation the gate money of 800,000 DM from his farewell match on 1 June 1982 (Hamburger SV versus Germany national team, which the national team won 4–2), and later added another 200,000 DM. In total, Beckenbauer raised more than 20 million euros for the foundation. His wife, Heidrun, is chairman of the foundation.

== Death ==
Beckenbauer died on 7 January 2024, at the age of 78, due to natural causes as announced by his family in a note sent to Deutsche Presse-Agentur. A memorial service was held at Allianz Arena on 19 January.

==Legacy==
Beckenbauer is widely considered to be one of the greatest footballers in the history of the game. He is the only defender in football history to win the Ballon d&#x27;Or twice, and is often credited as having invented the role of the modern sweeper or &quot;libero&quot;, a defensive player who intervenes proactively in the offensive game of his team. Named European Footballer of the Year twice, Beckenbauer was chosen on the World Team of the 20th Century in 1998, and the FIFA World Cup Dream Team in 2002.

An icon in Germany, and one of only three men (Mário Zagallo and Didier Deschamps being the others) to have won the World Cup both as a player and manager, Beckenbauer was praised by former German chancellor Gerhard Schröder for winning the World Cup as a player in 1974, winning as manager in 1990, and for playing a leading role in Germany&#x27;s success of achieving host status of the 2006 World Cup. His reputation as an administrator was later tarnished by repeated allegations of bribery.

When Beckenbauer praised Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp in 2019, Klopp said he felt that he had been given knighthood by a king.

After his death in 2024, &quot;La Gazzetta dello Sport&quot; declared Beckenbauer to be the &quot;greatest defender ever&quot;, and was praised by many outlets to be one of the greatest players of all time.

On 19 September 2024, it was announced that Allianz Arena&#x27;s address was changed to &quot;Franz Beckenbauer Platz 5&quot; in January 2025.

<doc id="152682" wikidata="Q1145" url="?curid=152682" title="Jean-Philippe Rameau">
<text>Jean-Philippe Rameau (; ; – ) was a French composer and music theorist. Regarded as one of the most important French composers and music theorists of the 18th century, he replaced Jean-Baptiste Lully as the dominant composer of French opera and is also considered the leading French composer of his time for the harpsichord, alongside François Couperin.

Little is known about Rameau&#x27;s early years. It was not until the 1720s that he won fame as a major theorist of music with his &quot;Treatise on Harmony&quot; (1722) and also in the following years as a composer of masterpieces for the harpsichord, which circulated throughout Europe. He was almost 50 before he embarked on the operatic career on which his reputation chiefly rests today. His debut, &quot;Hippolyte et Aricie&quot; (1733), caused a great stir and was fiercely attacked by the supporters of Lully&#x27;s style of music for its revolutionary use of harmony.

Nevertheless, Rameau&#x27;s pre-eminence in the field of French opera was soon acknowledged, and he was later attacked as an &quot;establishment&quot; composer by those who favoured Italian opera during the controversy known as the Querelle des Bouffons in the 1750s. Rameau&#x27;s music had gone out of fashion by the end of the 18th century, and it was not until the 20th that serious efforts were made to revive it. Today, he enjoys renewed appreciation with performances and recordings of his music ever more frequent.

==Life==
The details of Rameau&#x27;s life are generally obscure, especially concerning his first forty years, before he moved to Paris for good. He was a secretive man, and even his wife knew nothing of his early life, which explains the scarcity of biographical information available.

===Early years, 1683–1732===
Rameau&#x27;s early years are particularly obscure. He was born on 25 September 1683 in Dijon, and baptised the same day. His father, Jean, worked as an organist in several churches around Dijon, and his mother, Claudine Demartinécourt, was the daughter of a notary. The couple had eleven children, five girls and six boys, of whom Jean-Philippe was the seventh.

Rameau was taught music before he could read or write. He was educated at the Jesuit college at Godrans in Dijon, but he was not a good pupil and disrupted classes with his singing, later claiming that his passion for opera had begun at the age of twelve. Initially intended for the law, Rameau decided he wanted to be a musician, and his father sent him to Italy, where he stayed for a short while in Milan. On his return, he worked as a violinist in travelling companies, and then as an organist in provincial cathedrals, before moving to Paris for the first time. There, in 1706, he published his earliest-known compositions: the harpsichord works that make up his first book of &quot;Pièces de Clavecin&quot;, which show the influence of his friend Louis Marchand.

In 1709, he moved back to Dijon to take over his father&#x27;s job as organist in the main church. The contract was for six years, but Rameau left before then and took up similar posts in Lyon and Clermont-Ferrand. During that period, he composed motets for church performance as well as secular cantatas.

In 1722, he returned to Paris for good, and there he published his most important work of music theory, &quot;Traité de l&#x27;harmonie&quot; (&quot;Treatise on Harmony&quot;). That soon won him a great reputation, and it was followed in 1726 by his &quot;Nouveau système de musique théorique&quot;. In 1724 and 1729 (or 1730), he also published two more collections of harpsichord pieces.

Rameau took his first tentative steps into composing stage music when the writer Alexis Piron asked him to provide songs for his popular comic plays written for the Paris Fairs. Four collaborations followed, beginning with &quot;L&#x27;endriague&quot; in 1723, but none of the music has survived.

On 25 February 1726, Rameau married the 19-year-old Marie-Louise Mangot, who came from a musical family from Lyon, and was a good singer and instrumentalist. The couple had four children, two boys and two girls, and the marriage is said to have been a happy one.

In spite of his fame as a music theorist, Rameau had trouble finding a post as an organist in Paris.

===Later years, 1733–1764===
It was not until he was approaching 50 that Rameau decided to embark on the operatic career on which his fame as a composer mainly rests. He had already approached writer Antoine Houdar de la Motte for a libretto in 1727, but nothing came of it; he was finally inspired to try his hand at the prestigious genre of &quot;tragédie en musique&quot; after seeing Montéclair&#x27;s &quot;Jephté&quot; in 1732. Rameau&#x27;s &quot;Hippolyte et Aricie&quot; premiered at the Académie Royale de Musique on 1 October 1733. It was immediately recognised as the most significant opera to appear in France since the death of Lully, though its reception drew controversy. Some, such as the composer André Campra, were stunned by its originality and wealth of invention; others found its harmonic innovations discordant and saw the work as an attack on the French musical tradition. The two camps, the so-called Lullyistes and the Rameauneurs, fought a pamphlet war over the issue for the rest of the decade.

Just before that, Rameau had made the acquaintance of the powerful financier Alexandre Le Riche de La Poupelinière, who became his patron until 1753. La Poupelinière&#x27;s mistress (and later, wife), Thérèse des Hayes, was Rameau&#x27;s pupil and a great admirer of his music. In 1731, Rameau became the conductor of La Poupelinière&#x27;s private orchestra, which was of an extremely high quality. He held the post for 22 years, and was succeeded by Johann Stamitz and then François-Joseph Gossec. La Poupelinière&#x27;s salon enabled Rameau to meet some of the leading cultural figures of the day, including Voltaire, who soon began collaborating with the composer. Their first project, the &quot;tragédie en musique Samson&quot;, was abandoned because an opera on a religious theme by Voltaire—a notorious critic of the Church—was likely to be banned by the authorities. Meanwhile, Rameau had introduced his new musical style into the lighter genre of the &quot;opéra-ballet&quot; with the highly successful &quot;Les Indes galantes&quot;. It was followed by two &quot;tragédies en musique&quot;, &quot;Castor et Pollux&quot; (1737) and &quot;Dardanus&quot; (1739), and another &quot;opéra-ballet&quot;, &quot;Les fêtes d&#x27;Hébé&quot; (also 1739). All those operas of the 1730s are among Rameau&#x27;s most highly regarded works. However, the composer followed them with six years of silence, during which the only work he produced was a new version of &quot;Dardanus&quot; (1744). The reason for the interval in the composer&#x27;s creative life is unknown, although it is possible he had a falling-out with the authorities at the Académie royale de la musique.

The year 1745 was a turning point in Rameau&#x27;s career. He received several commissions from the court for works to celebrate the French victory at the Battle of Fontenoy and the marriage of the Dauphin to Infanta Maria Teresa Rafaela of Spain. Rameau produced his most important comic opera, &quot;Platée&quot;, as well as two collaborations with Voltaire: the &quot;opéra-ballet Le temple de la gloire&quot; and the &quot;comédie-ballet La princesse de Navarre&quot;. They gained Rameau official recognition; he was granted the title &quot;Compositeur du Cabinet du Roi&quot; and given a substantial pension. 1745 also saw the beginning of the bitter enmity between Rameau and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Though best known today as a thinker, Rousseau had ambitions to be a composer. He had written an opera, &quot;Les muses galantes&quot; (inspired by Rameau&#x27;s &quot;Indes galantes&quot;), but Rameau was unimpressed by this musical tribute. At the end of 1745, Voltaire and Rameau, who were busy on other works, commissioned Rousseau to turn &quot;La Princesse de Navarre&quot; into a new opera, with linking recitative, called &quot;Les fêtes de Ramire&quot;. Rousseau then claimed the two had stolen the credit for the words and music he had contributed, though musicologists have been able to identify almost nothing of the piece as Rousseau&#x27;s work. Nevertheless, the embittered Rousseau nursed a grudge against Rameau for the rest of his life.

Rousseau was a major participant in the second great quarrel that erupted over Rameau&#x27;s work, the so-called &quot;Querelle des Bouffons&quot; of 1752–54, which pitted French &quot;tragédie en musique&quot; against Italian &quot;opera buffa&quot;. This time, Rameau was accused of being out of date and his music too complicated in comparison with the simplicity and &quot;naturalness&quot; of a work like Pergolesi&#x27;s &quot;La serva padrona&quot;. In the mid-1750s, Rameau criticised Rousseau&#x27;s contributions to the musical articles in the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot;, which led to a quarrel with the leading &quot;philosophes&quot; d&#x27;Alembert and Diderot. As a result, Jean-François Rameau became a character in Diderot&#x27;s then-unpublished dialogue, &quot;Le neveu de Rameau&quot; (&quot;Rameau&#x27;s Nephew&quot;).

In 1753, La Poupelinière took a scheming musician, Jeanne-Thérèse Goermans, as his mistress. The daughter of harpsichord maker Jacques Goermans, she went by the name of Madame de Saint-Aubin, and her opportunistic husband pushed her into the arms of the rich financier. She had La Poupelinière engage the services of the Bohemian composer Johann Stamitz, who succeeded Rameau after a breach developed between Rameau and his patron. By then, however, Rameau no longer needed La Poupelinière&#x27;s financial support and protection.

Rameau pursued his activities as a theorist and composer until his death. He lived with his wife and two of his children in his large suite of rooms in Rue des Bons-Enfants, which he would leave every day, lost in thought, to take a solitary walk in the nearby gardens of the Palais-Royal or the Tuileries. Sometimes he would meet the young writer Chabanon, who noted some of Rameau&#x27;s disillusioned confidential remarks: &quot;Day by day, I&#x27;m acquiring more good taste, but I no longer have any genius&quot; and &quot;The imagination is worn out in my old head; it&#x27;s not wise at this age wanting to practise arts that are nothing but imagination.&quot;

Rameau composed prolifically in the late 1740s and early 1750s. After that, his rate of productivity dropped off, probably due to old age and ill health, although he was still able to write another comic opera, &quot;Les Paladins&quot;, in 1760. That as due to be followed by a final &quot;tragédie en musique, Les Boréades&quot; but, for unknown reasons, the opera was never produced and did not get a proper staging unil the late 20th century. Rameau died on 12 September 1764 after suffering from a fever, thirteen days before his 81st birthday. At his bedside, he objected to a song being sung. His last words were, &quot;What the devil do you mean to sing to me, priest? You are out of tune.&quot; He was buried in the church of St. Eustache, Paris on the same day of his death. Although a bronze bust and red marble tombstone were erected in his memory there by the Société de la Compositeurs de Musique in 1883, the exact site of his burial remains unknown to this day.

===Rameau&#x27;s personality===
While the details of his biography are vague and fragmentary, the details of Rameau&#x27;s personal and family life are almost completely obscure. Rameau&#x27;s music, so graceful and attractive, completely contradicts the man&#x27;s public image and what we know of his character as described (or perhaps unfairly caricatured) by Diderot in his satirical novel &quot;Le Neveu de Rameau&quot;. Throughout his life, music was his consuming passion. It occupied his entire thinking; Philippe Beaussant calls him a monomaniac. Alexis Piron explained that &quot;His heart and soul were in his harpsichord; once he had shut its lid, there was no one home.&quot; Physically, Rameau was tall and exceptionally thin, as can be seen by the sketches we have of him, including a famous portrait by Carmontelle. He had a &quot;loud voice&quot;. His speech was difficult to understand, just like his handwriting, which was never fluent. As a man, he was secretive, solitary, irritable, proud of his own achievements (more as a theorist than as a composer), brusque with those who contradicted him, and quick to anger. It is difficult to imagine him among the leading wits, including Voltaire (to whom he bears more than a passing physical resemblance), who frequented La Poupelinière&#x27;s salon; his music was his passport, and it made up for his lack of social graces.

His enemies exaggerated his faults, e.g. his supposed miserliness. In fact, it seems that his thriftiness was the result of long years spent in obscurity, when his income was uncertain and scanty, rather than being part of his character, because he could also be generous. He helped his nephew Jean-François when he came to Paris and also helped establish the career of Claude-Bénigne Balbastre in the capital. Furthermore, he gave his daughter Marie-Louise a considerable dowry when she became a Visitandine nun in 1750, and he paid a pension to one of his sisters when she became ill. Financial security came late to him, following the success of his stage works and the grant of a royal pension. A few months before his death, he was ennobled and made a knight of the Ordre de Saint-Michel. But he did not change his way of life, keeping his worn-out clothes, his single pair of shoes, and his old furniture. After his death, it was discovered that he possessed only one dilapidated single-keyboard harpsichord in his rooms in Rue des Bons-Enfants, yet he also had a bag containing 1691 gold louis.

==Music==
===General character of Rameau&#x27;s music===
Rameau&#x27;s music is characterised by the exceptional technical knowledge of a composer who wanted above all to be renowned as a theorist of the art. Nevertheless, it is not solely addressed to the intelligence, and Rameau himself claimed, &quot;I try to conceal art with art.&quot; The paradox of this music was that it was new, using techniques never known before, but it took place within the framework of old-fashioned forms. Rameau appeared revolutionary to the Lullyistes, disturbed by complex harmony of his music; and reactionary to the , who only paid attention to its content and who either would not or could not listen to the sound it made. The incomprehension Rameau received from his contemporaries stopped him from repeating such daring experiments as the second Trio des Parques in &quot;Hippolyte et Aricie&quot;, which he was forced to remove after a handful of performances because the singers had been either unable or unwilling to execute it correctly.

===Rameau&#x27;s musical works===
Rameau&#x27;s musical works may be divided into four distinct groups, which differ greatly in importance: a few cantatas; a few motets for large chorus; some pieces for solo harpsichord or harpsichord accompanied by other instruments; and, finally, his works for the stage, to which he dedicated the last thirty years of his career almost exclusively. Like most of his contemporaries, Rameau often reused melodies that had been particularly successful, but never without meticulously adapting them; they are not simple transcriptions. Besides, no borrowings have been found from other composers, although his earliest works show the influence of other music. Rameau&#x27;s reworkings of his own material are numerous; e.g., in &quot;Les Fêtes d&#x27;Hébé&quot;, we find &quot;L&#x27;Entretien des Muses&quot;, the Musette, and the Tambourin, taken from the 1724 book of harpsichord pieces, as well as an aria from the cantata &quot;Le Berger Fidèle&quot;.

====Motets====
For at least 26 years, Rameau was a professional organist in the service of religious institutions, and yet the body of sacred music he composed is exceptionally small and his organ works nonexistent. Judging by the evidence, it was not his favourite field, but rather, simply a way of making reasonable money. Rameau&#x27;s few religious compositions are nevertheless remarkable and compare favourably to the works of specialists in the area. Only four motets have been attributed to Rameau with any certainty: &quot;Deus noster refugium&quot;, &quot;In convertendo&quot;, &quot;Quam dilecta&quot;, and &quot;Laboravi&quot;.

====Cantatas====
The cantata was a highly successful genre in the early 18th century. The French cantata, which should not be confused with the Italian or the German cantata, was &quot;invented&quot; in 1706 by the poet Jean-Baptiste Rousseau and soon taken up by many famous composers of the day, such as Montéclair, Campra, and Clérambault. Cantatas were Rameau&#x27;s first contact with dramatic music. The modest forces the cantata required meant it was a genre within the reach of a composer who was still unknown. Musicologists can only guess at the dates of Rameau&#x27;s six surviving cantatas, and the names of the librettists are unknown.

====Instrumental music====
Along with François Couperin, Rameau was a master of the 18th-century French school of harpsichord music, and both made a break with the style of the first generation of harpsichordists whose compositions adhered to the relatively standardised suite form, which had reached its apogee in the first decade of the 18th century and successive collections of pieces by Louis Marchand, Gaspard Le Roux, Louis-Nicolas Clérambault, Jean-François Dandrieu, Élisabeth Jacquet de la Guerre, Charles Dieupart and Nicolas Siret. Rameau and Couperin had different styles, and it seems they did not know one another: Couperin was one of the official court musicians; Rameau, fifteen years his junior, achieved fame only after Couperin&#x27;s death.

Rameau published his first book of harpsichord pieces in 1706. (Cf. Couperin, who waited until 1713 before publishing his first &quot;Ordres&quot;.) Rameau&#x27;s music includes pieces in the pure tradition of the French suite: imitative (&quot;Le rappel des oiseaux&quot;, &quot;La poule&quot;) and characterful (&quot;Les tendres plaintes&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;entretien des Muses&quot;). But there are also works of pure virtuosity that resemble Domenico Scarlatti (&quot;Les tourbillons&quot;, &quot;Les trois mains&quot;) as well as pieces that reveal the experiments of a theorist and musical innovator (&quot;L&#x27;enharmonique&quot;, &quot;Les Cyclopes&quot;), which had a marked influence on Louis-Claude Daquin, Joseph-Nicolas-Pancrace Royer and Jacques Duphly. Rameau&#x27;s suites are grouped in the traditional way, by key. The first set of dances (Allemande, Courante, Sarabande, Les Trois Mains, Fanfairenette, La Triomphante, Gavotte et 6 doubles) is centred on A major and A minor, while the remaining pieces (Les tricoteuses, L&#x27;Indifferente, Première Menuet, Deuxième Menuet, La Poule, Les Triolets, Les Sauvages, L&#x27;Enharmonique, L&#x27;Egiptienne [sic]) are centred around G major and G minor.

Rameau&#x27;s second and third collections appeared in 1724 and 1727. After these he composed only one piece for the harpsichord, the eight-minute &quot;La Dauphine&quot; of 1747, while the very short &quot;Les petits marteaux&quot; (c. 1750) has also been attributed to him.

During his semiretirement (1740 to 1744) he wrote the &quot;Pièces de clavecin en concerts&quot; (1741), which some musicologists consider the pinnacle of French Baroque chamber music. Adopting a formula successfully employed by Mondonville a few years earlier, Rameau fashioned these pieces differently from trio sonatas in that the harpsichord is not simply there as basso continuo to accompany melody instruments (violin, flute, viol) but as equal partner in &quot;concert&quot; with them. Rameau claimed that this music would be equally satisfying played on the harpsichord alone, but the claim is not wholly convincing because he took the trouble to transcribe five of them himself, those the lack of other instruments would show the least.

====Opera====
After 1733 Rameau dedicated himself mostly to opera. On a strictly musical level, 18th-century French Baroque opera is richer and more varied than contemporary Italian opera, especially in the place given to choruses and dances but also in the musical continuity that arises from the respective relationships between the arias and the recitatives. Another essential difference: whereas Italian opera gave a starring role to female sopranos and castrati, French opera had no use for the latter. The Italian opera of Rameau&#x27;s day (opera seria, opera buffa) was essentially divided into musical sections (da capo arias, duets, trios, etc.) and sections that were spoken or almost spoken (&quot;recitativo secco&quot;). It was during the latter that the action progressed while the audience waited for the next aria; on the other hand, the text of the arias was almost entirely buried beneath music whose chief aim was to show off the virtuosity of the singer. Nothing of the kind is to be found in French opera of the day; since Lully, the text had to remain comprehensible—limiting certain techniques such as the vocalise, which was reserved for special words such as &#x27; (&quot;glory&quot;) or &#x27; (&quot;victory&quot;). A subtle equilibrium existed between the more and the less musical parts: melodic recitative on the one hand and arias that were often closer to arioso on the other, alongside virtuoso &quot;ariettes&quot; in the Italian style. This form of continuous music prefigures Wagnerian drama even more than does the &quot;reform&quot; opera of Gluck.

Five essential components may be discerned in Rameau&#x27;s operatic scores:
*Pieces of &quot;pure&quot; music (overtures, ritornelli, music which closes scenes). Unlike the highly stereotyped Lullian overture, Rameau&#x27;s overtures show an extraordinary variety. Even in his earliest works, where he uses the standard French model, Rameau—the born symphonist and master of orchestration—composes novel and unique pieces. A few pieces are particularly striking, such as the overture to &quot;Zaïs&quot;, depicting the chaos before the creation of the universe, that of &quot;Pigmalion&quot;, suggesting the sculptor&#x27;s chipping away at the statue with his mallet, or many more conventional depictions of storms and earthquakes, as well perhaps as the imposing final chaconnes of &quot;Les Indes galantes&quot; or &quot;Dardanus&quot;.
*Dance music: the danced interludes, which were obligatory even in &quot;tragédie en musique&quot;, allowed Rameau to give free rein to his inimitable sense of rhythm, melody, and choreography, acknowledged by all his contemporaries, including the dancers themselves. This &quot;learned&quot; composer, forever preoccupied by his next theoretical work, also was one who strung together gavottes, minuets, loures, rigaudons, passepieds, tambourins, and musettes by the dozen. According to his biographer, Cuthbert Girdlestone, &quot;The immense superiority of all that pertains to Rameau in choreography still needs emphasizing&quot;, and the German scholar Hermann Wolfgang von Waltershausen affirmed:
Rameau was the greatest ballet composer of all times. The genius of his creation rests on one hand on his perfect artistic permeation by folk-dance types, on the other hand on the constant preservation of living contact with the practical requirements of the ballet stage, which prevented an estrangement between the expression of the body from the spirit of absolute music.
*Choruses: Padre Martini, the erudite musicologist who corresponded with Rameau, affirmed that &quot;the French are excellent at choruses&quot;, obviously thinking of Rameau himself. A great master of harmony, Rameau knew how to compose sumptuous choruses—whether monodic, polyphonic, or interspersed with passages for solo singers or the orchestra—and whatever feelings needed to be expressed.
*Arias: less frequent than in Italian opera, Rameau nevertheless offers many striking examples. Particularly admired arias include Télaïre&#x27;s &quot;Tristes apprêts&quot; from &quot;Castor et Pollux&quot;; &quot;Ô jour affreux&quot; and &quot;Lieux funestes&quot; from &quot;Dardanus&quot;; Huascar&#x27;s invocations in &quot;Les Indes galantes&quot;; and the final ariette in &quot;Pigmalion&quot;. In &quot;Platée&quot; we encounter a showstopping ars poetica aria for the character of La Folie (the madness), &quot;Formons les plus brillants concerts / Aux langeurs d&#x27;Apollon&quot;.
*Recitative: much closer to arioso than to &quot;recitativo secco&quot;. The composer took scrupulous care to observe French prosody and used his harmonic knowledge to give expression to his protagonists&#x27; feelings.
During the first part of his operatic career (1733–1739), Rameau wrote his great masterpieces destined for the Académie royale de musique: three &quot;tragédies en musique&quot; and two &quot;opéra-ballets&quot; that still form the core of his repertoire. After the interval of 1740 to 1744, he became the official court musician, and for the most part, composed pieces intended to entertain, with plenty of dance music emphasising sensuality and an idealised pastoral atmosphere. In his last years, Rameau returned to a renewed version of his early style in &quot;Les Paladins&quot; and &quot;Les Boréades&quot;.

His &quot;Zoroastre&quot; was first performed in 1749. According to one of Rameau&#x27;s admirers, Cuthbert Girdlestone, this opera has a distinctive place in his works: &quot;The profane passions of hatred and jealousy are rendered more intensely [than in his other works] and with a strong sense of reality.&quot;

=====Rameau and his librettists=====
Unlike Lully, who collaborated with Philippe Quinault on almost all his operas, Rameau rarely worked with the same librettist twice. He was highly demanding and bad-tempered, unable to maintain longstanding partnerships with his librettists, with the exception of Louis de Cahusac, who collaborated with him on several operas, including &quot;Les fêtes de l&#x27;Hymen et de l&#x27;Amour&quot; (1747), &quot;Zaïs&quot; (1748), &quot;Naïs&quot; (1749), &quot;Zoroastre&quot; (1749; revised 1756), &quot;La naissance d&#x27;Osiris&quot; (1754), and &quot;Anacréon&quot; (the first of Rameau&#x27;s operas by that name, 1754). He is also credited with writing the libretto of Rameau&#x27;s final work, &quot;Les Boréades&quot; (c. 1763).

Many Rameau specialists have regretted that the collaboration with Houdar de la Motte never took place, and that the &quot;Samson&quot; project with Voltaire came to nothing because the librettists Rameau did work with were second-rate. He made his acquaintance of most of them at La Poupelinière&#x27;s salon, at the , or at the house of the comte de Livry, all meeting places for leading cultural figures of the day.

Not one of his librettists managed to produce a libretto on the same artistic level as Rameau&#x27;s music: the plots were often overly complex or unconvincing. But this was standard for the genre, and is probably part of its charm. The versification, too, was mediocre, and Rameau often had to have the libretto modified and rewrite the music after the premiere because of the ensuing criticism. This is why we have two versions of &quot;Castor et Pollux&quot; (1737 and 1754) and three of &quot;Dardanus&quot; (1739, 1744, and 1760).

===Reputation and influence===
By the end of his life, Rameau&#x27;s music had come under attack in France from theorists who favoured Italian models. However, foreign composers working in the Italian tradition were increasingly looking towards Rameau as a way of reforming their own leading operatic genre, &quot;opera seria&quot;. Tommaso Traetta produced two operas setting translations of Rameau libretti that show the French composer&#x27;s influence, &quot;Ippolito ed Aricia&quot; (1759) and &quot;I Tintaridi&quot; (based on &quot;Castor et Pollux&quot;, 1760). Traetta had been advised by Count Francesco Algarotti, a leading proponent of reform according to French models; Algarotti was a major influence on the most important &quot;reformist&quot; composer, Christoph Willibald Gluck. Gluck&#x27;s three Italian reform operas of the 1760s—&quot;Orfeo ed Euridice&quot;, &quot;Alceste&quot;, and &quot;Paride ed Elena&quot;—reveal a knowledge of Rameau&#x27;s works. For instance, both &quot;Orfeo&quot; and the 1737 version of &quot;Castor et Pollux&quot; open with the funeral of one of the leading characters who later comes back to life. Many of the operatic reforms advocated in the preface to Gluck&#x27;s &quot;Alceste&quot; were already present in Rameau&#x27;s works. Rameau had used accompanied recitatives, and the overtures in his later operas reflected the action to come, so when Gluck arrived in Paris in 1774 to produce a series of six French operas, he could be seen as continuing in the tradition of Rameau. Nevertheless, while Gluck&#x27;s popularity survived the French Revolution, Rameau&#x27;s did not. By the end of the 18th century, his operas had vanished from the repertoire.

For most of the 19th century, Rameau&#x27;s music remained unplayed, known only by reputation. Hector Berlioz investigated &quot;Castor et Pollux&quot; and particularly admired the aria &quot;Tristes apprêts&quot;, but &quot;whereas the modern listener readily perceives the common ground with Berlioz&#x27; music, he himself was more conscious of the gap which separated them.&quot; French humiliation in the Franco-Prussian War brought about a change in Rameau&#x27;s fortunes. As Rameau biographer Jean Malignon wrote, &quot;...the German victory over France in 1870–71 was the grand occasion for digging up great heroes from the French past. Rameau, like so many others, was flung into the enemy&#x27;s face to bolster our courage and our faith in the national destiny of France.&quot; In 1894, composer Vincent d&#x27;Indy founded the Schola Cantorum to promote French national music; the society put on several revivals of works by Rameau. Among the audience was Claude Debussy, who especially cherished &quot;Castor et Pollux&quot;, revived in 1903: &quot;Gluck&#x27;s genius was deeply rooted in Rameau&#x27;s works... a detailed comparison allows us to affirm that Gluck could replace Rameau on the French stage only by assimilating the latter&#x27;s beautiful works and making them his own.&quot; Camille Saint-Saëns (by editing and publishing the &quot;Pièces&quot; in 1895) and Paul Dukas were two other important French musicians who gave practical championship to Rameau&#x27;s music in their day, but interest in Rameau petered out again, and it was not until the late 20th century that a serious effort was made to revive his works. Over half of Rameau&#x27;s operas have now been recorded, in particular by conductors such as John Eliot Gardiner, William Christie, and Marc Minkowski.

One of his pieces is commonly heard in the Victoria Centre in Nottingham by the Rowland Emett timepiece, the Aqua Horological Tintinnabulator. Emett quoted that Rameau made music for his school and the shopping centre without him knowing it.

==Theoretical works==

===&quot;Treatise on Harmony&quot;, 1722===
Rameau&#x27;s 1722 &quot;Treatise on Harmony&quot; initiated a revolution in music theory. Rameau posited the discovery of the &quot;fundamental law&quot; or what he referred to as the &quot;fundamental bass&quot; of all Western music. Heavily influenced by new Cartesian modes of thought and analysis, Rameau&#x27;s methodology incorporated mathematics, commentary, analysis and a didacticism that was specifically intended to illuminate, scientifically, the structure and principles of music. With careful deductive reasoning, he attempted to derive universal harmonic principles from natural causes. Previous treatises on harmony had been purely practical; Rameau embraced the new philosophical rationalism, quickly rising to prominence in France as the &quot;Isaac Newton of Music&quot;. His fame subsequently spread throughout all Europe, and his &quot;Treatise&quot; became the definitive authority on music theory, forming the foundation for instruction in western music that persists to this day.
