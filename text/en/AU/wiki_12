<text>Puss is a character in the fairy tale &quot;The Master Cat, or Puss in Boots&quot; by Charles Perrault. The tale was published in 1697 in his &quot;Histoires ou Contes du temps passé&quot;. The tale of a cat helping an impoverished master attain wealth through its trickery is known in hundreds of variants.

* Gustave Doré created an illustrated version (right).
* In 1797 German writer Ludwig Tieck published &quot;&quot;, a dramatic satire based on the Puss in Boots tale.
* In 1904 English artist Louis Wain created an illustrated version titled &quot;The Marvelous Story of Puss in Boots&quot;.
* The Russian composer César Cui (of French ancestry) composed a short children&#x27;s opera on this subject in 1913. &quot;Puss in Boots&quot; was first performed in Rome in 1915, and has been something of a repertory item in Germany since at least the 1970s.
* In 1922 Walt Disney created a black-and-white silent short of the same name.
* Xavier Montsalvatge composed a children&#x27;s opera, &quot;El gato con botas&quot;, with libretto by Néstor Luján; it was first performed in Barcelona Gran Teatre del Liceu in 1947. It has been performed for children several times, in Spain, but also in Germany, Czech Republic, Australia, and New York.
* In their album of cat songs, Happy Times Records included a version of Puss in Boots. As with their version of The Pied Piper of Hamelin, it is not faithful to the original fairy tale and features a cat named Puss in Boots who is the guardian of his native village. He saves the village from several invasions by using his head and is summoned by the song, &quot;Come, boots!/Come, boots!/Come a runnin&#x27;,/Puss in Boots.&quot; The man and woman who perform this story/song are the same ones who perform Happy Times&#x27;s version of The Pied Piper, and the number ends with the words, &quot;The whole village is proud of their magical cat!&quot;
* A 1961 Mexican adaptation called &quot;El gato con botas&quot;. K. Gordon Murray distributed it in the United States as &quot;Puss in Boots&quot;.
* Hayao Miyazaki participated in the 1969 Toei Animation production of &quot;Nagagutsu wo Haita Neko&quot; (Puss &#x27;n Boots), providing key animation, designs, storyboards, image boards, and story ideas. It was directed by Kimio Yabuki, with a screenplay by Hisashi Inoue, a famous Japanese playwright, and animation supervision was carried out by longtime Miyazaki collaborator and mentor Yasuji Mori. Hayao Miyazaki also wrote and drew a comic version first serialized in &quot;Chuunichi Shimbun Nichiyou Ban&quot; &quot;(Chuunichi Newspaper Sunday Version)&quot; to promote the film. Its main character, the cat Pero, was very popular and eventually became Toei&#x27;s mascot.
* Rankin/Bass Productions produced a hand-drawn animated TV special in 1972 entitled &quot;Puss in Boots&quot;.
* &quot;The Master Cat&quot; by David Garnett is a novel first published in 1974 which gives a more detailed account of the established story from Puss getting the boots to his eating the ogre. The second part of the book tells of Puss getting caught up in palace plots and intrigues of which he ultimately becomes the victim, by his own ungrateful master no less.
* In 1985 the family television series &quot;Faerie Tale Theatre&quot; produced a live-action adaptation starring Ben Vereen as Puss and Gregory Hines as the miller&#x27;s son.
* In an episode of &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;, a sketch set in the Police Department of the State of Venezuela is interrupted by an unexpected adaptation of Puss in Boots done in the style of a Christmas pantomime—Julia Breck is memorable in a (very short) &#x27;trouser role&#x27;.
* An episode of &quot;Garfield and Friends&quot; adapted the story with Garfield in the role of the cat, and his owner, Jon Arbuckle in the role of his owner. However, the episode is titled “Puss in High-Tops”, as instead of boots, the cat requests of pair of High-Tops. This is because at the end, instead of tricking the ogre to turn into a mouse, he tricks him into turning into a cockroach, which he uses the high-tops to step on him. In the end, he charges his owner for his services and gets chased by the ogre who wants revenge after turning back from a cockroach.
* A live action direct-to-video film adaptation was made in 1988, starring Christopher Walken as Puss and Jason Connery as the miller&#x27;s son.
* Enoki Films released a Japanese animated series called &quot;Nagagutsu wo Haita Neko no Bouken&quot; (Adventures of Puss-in-Boots) in 1992.
* &quot;Puss&quot; by Esther Friesner, in &quot;Snow White, Blood Red&quot; (edited by Ellen Datlow and Terri Windling) retells the story.
* Plaza Entertainment released an animated direct-to-video film called &quot;Puss in Boots&quot; in 1999.
* Puss in Boots appears as a character in the films &quot;Shrek 2&quot; and &quot;Shrek The Third&quot; (voiced by Antonio Banderas). The character is originally recruited as a swashbuckling professional ogre killer who is an obvious parody of Banderas&#x27; famous role as Zorro. Puss later becomes a sidekick to the ogre Shrek, and in the alternative world in &quot;Shrek Forever After&quot;, because Rumpelstiltskin erased the day Shrek was born when he was made to sign a contract, Puss is seen to have retired from fencing and grown fat as Fiona&#x27;s pet. A self-titled spin-off film was released in 2011, followed by a sequel &quot;Puss in Boots: The Last Wish&quot; in 2022. &quot;Puss in Boots&quot;, a video game based on the film, was released in October 2011. He was also the star of the 2015 Netflix original series &quot;The Adventures of Puss in Boots&quot;.
* In the furry comic book, &quot;Xanadu&quot;, the main male hero, Tabbe Le Fauve, is a cat modeled on Puss in Boots with a strong influence of Errol Flynn&#x27;s typical swashbuckler character.
* The webcomic &quot;No Rest for the Wicked&quot; features several characters adapted from this story, Perrault (Puss), The Marquis de Carabas, and his wife.
* HBO&#x27;s &quot;Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales for Every Child&quot; gave the story a Polynesian flavor.
* Angela Carter offers an alternative, updated version of the tale in her collection of short stories &quot;The Bloody Chamber&quot;
* In the &quot;Pokémon&quot; anime series, the character Tyson owns a Meowth that dresses up like Puss in Boots; this Meowth is his main Pokémon.
* In Gainax&#x27;s 2000 anime &quot;FLCL&quot;, the third episode is named Maru Raba (Marquis de Carabas) and deals with the young adult characters performing Puss in Boots at their school, and with one character and her interest in the idea of pretending to be something until you&#x27;ve become it.
* &quot;The New Traveller&#x27;s Almanac&quot;, a companion to Alan Moore and Kevin O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot;, places Carabas Castle (formerly Ogre Castle, where &quot;a talking feline dressed in smashing footwear&quot; ate the Ogre and inherited his riches) in Ardennes on the Belgian border, where also stood (among others) the castles of Bluebeard, the Beast and Rosamund. These castles were subsequently destroyed by shellfire in 1913 during the Great War.
* In Neil Gaiman&#x27;s novel &quot;Neverwhere&quot;, the Marquis de Carabas appears as a character and is merged with Puss.
* The novel &quot;Reserved for the Cat&quot; by Mercedes Lackey is a retelling of Puss In Boots, set in her Elemental Masters series.
*In the manga MÄR, Puss &#x27;n&#x27; Boots becomes a form of Babbo in the final battle against the main antagonist, Phantom.
*Puss in Boots is the fourth episode of the episode game series &quot;American McGee&#x27;s Grimm&quot;, which features the dark version of the cat missing an eye and the queen rabbit in the dark version goes from an easter bunny type creature to a rabbit inspired by the xenomorph alien from the aliens franchise.
* The &quot;Captain N: The Game Master&quot; episode &quot;Once Upon a Time Machine&quot; is based on Puss N Boots (though it mostly draws its inspiration from a video game adaptation of Toei&#x27;s anime film.)
* &quot;La Véritable histoire du Chat botté&quot; is an animated French film (2009) by Jérôme Deschamps, Pascal Hérold and Macha Makeïeff. Dubbed into English as &quot;The True History of Puss &#x27;N Boots&quot; (2010), the voice actors include William Shatner.
* Puss in Boots appears in the &quot;Fables&quot; spin-off &quot;&quot;. He is one of the animal Fables who has to live on Fabletown&#x27;s &quot;Farm.&quot;
* Mary Hanson Roberts wrote and drew a long serial in the Furrlough anthropomorphic comic book, about the descendants of Puss in Boots and their adventures in their world&#x27;s equivalent of the France of Louis XVI and the French Revolution, called &quot;Here Comes a Candle.&quot; (The reference in the title is to the nursery rhyme that ends: &quot;Here comes a candle to light you to bed; here comes a chopper to chop off your head.&quot;)

<text>The Cheshire Cat ( ) is a fictional cat popularised by Lewis Carroll in &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; and known for its distinctive mischievous grin. While now most often used in &quot;Alice&quot;-related contexts, the association of a &quot;Cheshire cat&quot; with grinning predates the 1865 book. It has transcended the context of literature and become enmeshed in popular culture, appearing in various forms of media, from political cartoons to television, as well as in cross-disciplinary studies, from business to science. Often it is shown in the context of a person or idea that is purposefully confusing or enigmatic. One distinguishing feature of the &quot;Alice&quot;-style Cheshire Cat is the periodic gradual disappearance of its body, leaving only one last visible trace: its iconic grin. He belongs to the Duchess.

==Origins==
The first known appearance of the expression in literature is in the 18th century, in Francis Grose&#x27;s &quot;A Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue&quot;, Second, Corrected and Enlarged Edition (1788), which contains the following entry: 

The phrase appears again in print in John Wolcot&#x27;s pseudonymous Peter Pindar&#x27;s &quot;Pair of Lyric Epistles&quot; (1792):

The phrase also appears in print in William Makepeace Thackeray&#x27;s novel &quot;The Newcomes&quot; (1855):

There are numerous theories about the origin of the phrase &quot;grinning like a Cheshire Cat&quot; in English history. A possible origin of the phrase is one favoured by the people of Cheshire, a county in England which boasts numerous dairy farms; hence the cats grin because of the abundance of milk and cream.

In 1853, Samuel Maunder offered this explanation:

According to &quot;Brewer&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; (1870), &quot;The phrase has never been satisfactorily accounted for, but it has been said that cheese was formerly sold in Cheshire moulded like a cat that looked as though it was grinning&quot;. The cheese was cut from the tail end, so that the last part eaten was the head of the smiling cat. A later edition of Brewer&#x27;s adds another possible explanation, similar to Maunder&#x27;s, that a painter in Cheshire once used to paint grinning lions on inns. The dictionary does not expand further on this, its editors possibly considering the connection between cats and lions self-explanatory or obvious.

A 2015 article published in the &quot;Cheshire History&quot; journal examined these suggested origins, along with numerous others seen on the internet. The author, Peter Young, considered most to be &quot;inventive&quot; but unlikely. In his analysis, the essential feature of any actual historical explanation would be one that demonstrated its innate connection to Cheshire: An idiom that retained the localism while spreading nationwide, would, in his view, need to be strongly connected to the county, in the minds of people elsewhere. For this reason, he favours the well-fed farm cats of Cheshire&#x27;s dairying environment—a widely-known and well-promoted idea at the time the phrase arose—as the best candidate for the origin of the &quot;Cheshire Cat&quot; idiom.

==Lewis Carroll&#x27;s character==
The Cheshire Cat is now largely identified with the character of the same name in Lewis Carroll&#x27;s 1865 novel &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;. Alice first encounters the Cheshire Cat at the Duchess&#x27;s house in her kitchen, and later on the branches of a tree, where it appears and disappears at will, and engages Alice in amusing but sometimes perplexing conversation. The cat sometimes raises philosophical points that annoy or baffle Alice; but appears to cheer her when it appears suddenly at the Queen of Hearts&#x27; croquet field; and when sentenced to death, baffles everyone by having made its head appear without its body, sparking a debate between the executioner and the King and Queen of Hearts about whether a disembodied head can indeed be beheaded. At one point, the cat disappears gradually until nothing is left but its grin, prompting Alice to remark that &quot;she has often seen a cat without a grin but never a grin without a cat&quot;.

===Oxford professor E.B. Pusey===
The scholar David Day has proposed Lewis Carroll&#x27;s cat was Edward Bouverie Pusey, Oxford professor of Hebrew and Carroll&#x27;s mentor. 
The name Pusey was suggested by Alice&#x27;s deferential address of the cat as &quot;Cheshire Puss&quot;. Pusey was an authority on the fathers of the Christian Church, and in Carroll&#x27;s time Pusey was known as the Patristic Catenary (or chain), after the chain of authority of Church patriarchs.

As a mathematician, Carroll would have been well familiar with the other meaning of catenary: the curve of a horizontally-suspended chain, which suggests the shape of the cat&#x27;s grin.
===Source of imagery===
There is a suggestion that Carroll found inspiration for the name and expression of the Cheshire Cat in the 16th century sandstone carving of a grinning cat, on the west face of St Wilfrid&#x27;s Church tower in Grappenhall, a village from his birthplace in Daresbury, Cheshire.

Lewis Carroll&#x27;s father, Reverend Charles Dodgson, was Rector of Croft and Archdeacon of Richmond in North Yorkshire, England, from 1843 to 1868; Carroll lived here from 1843 to 1850. Some historians believe Lewis Carroll&#x27;s Cheshire Cat in &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; was inspired by a carving in Croft church.
Another possible inspiration was the British Shorthair: Carroll saw a representative British Shorthair illustrated on a label of Cheshire cheese. The Cat Fanciers&#x27; Association profile reads: “When gracelessness is observed, the British Shorthair is duly embarrassed, quickly recovering with a &#x27;Cheshire cat smile&#x27;”.

In 1992, members of the Lewis Carroll Society attributed it to a gargoyle found on a pillar in St Nicolas&#x27;s Church, Cranleigh, where Carroll used to travel frequently when he lived in Guildford (though this is doubtful, as he moved to Guildford some three years after &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; had been published) and a carving in a church in the village of Croft-on-Tees, in the north east of England, where his father had been rector.

Carroll is believed to have visited St Christopher&#x27;s church in Pott Shrigley, Cheshire, which has a stone sculpture resembling the pictorial cat in the book.

==Adaptations==
The Cheshire Cat character has been re-depicted by other creators and used as the inspiration for new characters, primarily in screen media (film, television, video games) and print media (literature, comics, art). Other non-media contexts that embrace the Cheshire Cat include music, business, and science.


Prior to 1951 when Walt Disney released an animated adaptation of the story (see below), there were few post-Alice allusions to the character. Martin Gardner, author of &quot;The Annotated Alice&quot;, wondered if T. S. Eliot had the Cheshire Cat in mind when writing &quot;Morning at the Window&quot;, but notes no other significant allusions in the pre-war period.

Images of and references to the Cheshire Cat cropped up with increasing frequency in the 1960s and 1970s, along with more frequent references to Carroll&#x27;s works in general. (&quot;See generally&quot; the lyrics to &quot;White Rabbit&quot; by the rock group Jefferson Airplane). The Cheshire Cat appeared on LSD blotters, as well as in song lyrics and popular fiction.

In Disney&#x27;s 1951 animated film, &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, the Cheshire Cat is depicted as an intelligent and mischievous character that sometimes helps Alice and sometimes gets her into trouble. He frequently sings the first verse of the Jabberwocky poem. The animated character was voiced by Sterling Holloway.

In the 1985 television adaptation of Carroll&#x27;s books, the Cheshire Cat is portrayed by Telly Savalas. He sings a morose song called &quot;There&#x27;s No Way Home&quot;, which simply drives Alice to try and find a way home even more.

In the 1999 television adaptation of Carroll&#x27;s books, the Cheshire Cat is portrayed by Whoopi Goldberg. She acts as an ally and friend to Alice.

The Cheshire Cat appears in Walt Disney&#x27;s 2010 &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, directed by Tim Burton. British actor Stephen Fry voices the character. In the film, Cheshire (as he is often called; or sometimes &quot;Ches&quot;) binds the wound Alice suffered earlier by the Bandersnatch and guides her to Tarrant Hightopp, the Mad Hatter and Thackery Earwicket, the March Hare. He is blamed by the Hatter for desertion when the White Queen is deposed by the Red; but later impersonates the Hatter when the latter is sentenced to decapitation. Throughout his appearances, &quot;Ches&quot; is able to make himself intangible or weightless, as well as invisible (and thus to survive decapitation), and is usually depicted in mid-air, at shoulder-height to human-sized characters. In the video game adaptation of the movie, &quot;Ches&quot; is a playable character who can not only turn himself invisible, but other objects around him as well.

In October 2019, it was reported that an undetermined Cheshire Cat project is being developed by Disney for its streaming service, Disney+.

In &quot;Alice&#x27;s Wonderland Bakery&quot;, a series set several generations after the Disney film, the Cheshire Cat, voiced by Max Mittelman, is depicted as an immortal, being the only character besides the Doorknob not to be represented through a descendant.

===Cross-screen comparison===
Each major film adaptation of Lewis Carroll&#x27;s tale represents the Cheshire Cat character and his traits uniquely. 

In addition to the Cheshire Cat&#x27;s appearances in films central to its Lewis Carroll origins, the Cheshire Cat has been featured in other cinematic works. The late filmmaker Chris Marker gave his monumental documentary on the New Left movement of 1967–1977, &quot;Le fond de l&#x27;air est rouge&quot; (1977), the English title &quot;Grin without a Cat&quot;. Like the original, it signifies that revolution was in the air, but failed to take root. In the film, it is also stated: &quot;a spearhead without a spear, a grin without a cat&quot;. A later Marker film, &quot;Chats perchés (2004) (The Case of the Grinning Cat&quot; in English)&quot;,&quot; examined the context of M. Chat street art in France&quot;.&quot; 

The Cheshire Cat appears in the first episode of the television series &quot;Once Upon a Time in Wonderland&quot; (a spin-off of &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot;) voiced by Keith David. While looking for the Mad Hatter&#x27;s house from the trees, Alice encounters the Cheshire Cat in giant form where the Red Queen had promised him that Alice would be good food for him. They end up engaging each other in combat until the Knave of Hearts arrives and throws a piece of one mushroom side into his mouth, which shrinks the Cat back to normal size, and he leaves.

===Video games===
The Cheshire Cat appears as an avatar character in the video games &quot;American McGee&#x27;s Alice&quot; (2000); and the sequel &quot;&quot; (2011), the Cheshire Cat is portrayed as an enigmatic and snarky, yet wise guide for Alice in the corrupted Wonderland. In keeping with the twisted tone of the game, the Cheshire Cat is mangy and emaciated in appearance. His voice was provided by Roger L. Jackson, who also voiced the Mad Hatter and The Jabberwock in the game.

The Cheshire Cat appears in Sunsoft&#x27;s 2006 mobile game , serving as the guide to Ariko (the &quot;Alice&quot; of the game) and helps her chase after The White Rabbit. In the game, Cheshire Cat is portrayed with a humanoid body and wears a long grey cloak with a red-string bell around his neck, leaving only his nose, razor-sharp teeth, and wide grin visible. In Wonderland, Cheshire Cat is the &quot;Guide&quot;, an important role that makes him feared by the other residents, and is compelled by Ariko&#x27;s inner will to help her unlock her suppressed, traumatic memories and overcome her suicidal depression. Later in the game, Cheshire Cat gets beheaded by the Queen Of Hearts, but is still alive and his body is able to move on its own. Due to the White Rabbit&#x27;s deranged state, Cheshire Cat fulfills his role of absorbing Ariko&#x27;s negative emotions, though the task puts a large strain on him.

The Cheshire Cat appears in &quot;Heart no Kuni no Alice&quot;, a dating sim game and its related media, as a young man named &quot;Boris Airay&quot;, with cat-like attributes such as a tail and cat ears, and is one of the many love interests for Alice in Wonderland.

===Other media===
American rock band Blink-182’s debut studio album, &quot;Cheshire Cat&quot;, released on 17 February 1995, takes its name from the Cheshire cat.

In the third volume of Captain Marvel comic series, &quot;Shazam! and the Seven Magic Lands&quot;, the Cheshire Cat is shown to live in the Magiclands location called the Wozenderlands. When the Scarecrow and the Munchkins were taking Billy Batson, Mary Bromfield, and C.C. Batson to Dorothy Gale, the Cheshire Cat appeared near the Blue Brick Road. He went on the attack only to be fought off by Shazam and Lady Shazam.
==In science==
Cheshire Cat is used as a metaphor to describe several scientific phenomena:

* The Cheshire Cat effect, as described by Sally Duensing and Bob Miller, is a binocular rivalry which causes stationary objects seen in one eye to disappear from view when an object in motion crosses in front of the other eye. 

* In another scientific context, catalytic RNAs have been deemed Cheshire cats. This metaphor is used to describe the fading of the ribonucleotide construct, which leaves behind a &quot;smile&quot; of only the mineral components of the RNA catalyst.

* Similarly, the Cheshire Cat has been used out of its traditional context to help define another scientific phenomenon, the &quot;Cheshire Cat&quot; escape strategy. When Coccolithophore – a species of successful ocean algae – is able to resist the haploid phase of its life cycle it escapes meiosis and its dominant diploid genes are passed on in a virus-free environment, freeing the host from the danger of infection during reproduction. The algae escape death (beheading) by means of disappearance (vanishing his head):

* Other gestures to the Cheshire Cat&#x27;s tropes of disappearance and mystique have been seen in scientific literature coming from the field of Physics. The quantum Cheshire cat is a phenomenon in quantum mechanics in which a particle and its property behave as if they are separated, or when a particle separates from one of its physical properties. To test this idea, researchers used an interferometer where neutron beams passed through silicon crystal. The crystal physically separated the neutrons and allowed them to go to two paths. Researchers reported &quot;the system behaves as if the neutrons go through one beam path, while their magnetic moment travels along the other.&quot; A subsequent quantum optics experiment observed this behaviour on individual photons with simultaneous measurements of the photon&#x27;s spatial presence in one location, and of the same photon&#x27;s polarisation in a different location.

* The Cheshire cat&#x27;s grin has inspired scientists in their naming of visual phenomena. A merger of galaxy groups in the constellation Ursa Major is nicknamed &quot;Cheshire Cat galaxy group&quot; by Astronomers due to its suggestive appearance.

* In linguistics, cheshirization, when a sound disappears but leaves a trace, just like the cat disappears but leaves his grin.

* In Conway&#x27;s Game of Life, the Cheshire Cat is a cat-like pattern which transforms into a grin in the second to last generation and a block (pawprint) in the last generation.

<text>The Cat in the Hat is a 1957 children&#x27;s book written and illustrated by American author Theodor Geisel, using the pen name Dr. Seuss. The story centers on a tall anthropomorphic cat who wears a red and white-striped top hat and a red bow tie. The Cat shows up at the house of Sally and her brother one rainy day when their mother is away. Despite the repeated objections of the children&#x27;s fish, the Cat shows the children a few of his tricks in an attempt to entertain them. In the process, he and his companions, Thing One and Thing Two, wreck the house. As the children and the fish become more alarmed, the Cat produces a machine that he uses to clean everything up and disappears just before the children&#x27;s mother comes home.

Geisel created the book in response to a debate in the United States about literacy in early childhood and the ineffectiveness of traditional primers such as those featuring Dick and Jane. Geisel was asked to write a more entertaining primer by William Spaulding, whom he had met during World War II and who was then director of the education division at Houghton Mifflin. However, because Geisel was already under contract with Random House, the two publishers agreed to a deal: Houghton Mifflin published the education edition, which was sold to schools, and Random House published the trade edition, which was sold in bookstores.

Geisel gave varying accounts of how he created &quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot;, but in the version he told most often, he was so frustrated with the word list from which he could choose words to write his story that he decided to scan the list and create a story based on the first two rhyming words he found. The words he found were &quot;cat&quot; and &quot;hat&quot;. The book was met with immediate critical and commercial success. Reviewers praised it as an exciting alternative to traditional primers. Three years after its debut, the book had already sold over a million copies, and in 2001, &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; listed the book at number nine on its list of best-selling children&#x27;s books of all time. The book&#x27;s success led to the creation of Beginner Books, a publishing house centered on producing similar books for young children learning to read. In 1983, Geisel said, &quot;It is the book I&#x27;m proudest of because it had something to do with the death of the &quot;Dick and Jane&quot; primers.&quot;

Since its publication, &quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot; has become one of Dr. Seuss&#x27;s most famous books, with the Cat himself becoming his signature creation, later on becoming one of the mascots for Dr. Seuss Enterprises. The book was adapted into a 1971 animated television special and a 2003 live-action film, and the Cat has been included in many Dr. Seuss media.

==Plot==
The story begins as an unnamed boy who is the narrator of the book sits with his sister Sally while home alone on a cold and rainy day, staring wistfully out the window. Then they hear a loud bump which is quickly followed by the arrival of the Cat in the Hat, a tall anthropomorphic cat in a red and white-striped top hat and a red bow tie, who proposes to entertain the children with some tricks that he knows. The children&#x27;s pet fish refuses, insisting that the Cat should leave. The Cat then responds by balancing the fish on the tip of his umbrella. The game quickly becomes increasingly trickier, as the Cat balances himself on a ball and tries to balance many household items on his limbs until he falls on his head, dropping everything he was holding. The fish admonishes him again, but the Cat in the Hat just proposes another game.

The Cat brings in a big red box from outside, from which he releases two identical characters, or &quot;Things&quot; as he refers them to, with blue hair and red suits called Thing One and Thing Two. The Things cause more trouble, such as flying kites in the house, knocking pictures off the wall and picking up the children&#x27;s mother&#x27;s new polka-dotted dress. All this comes to an end when the fish spots the children&#x27;s mother out the window. In response, the boy catches the Things in a net and the Cat, apparently ashamed, stores them back in the big red box. He takes it out the front door as the fish and the children survey the mess he has made. But the Cat soon returns, riding a machine that picks everything up and cleans the house, delighting the fish and the children. The Cat then leaves just before their mother arrives, and the fish and the children are back where they started at the beginning of the story. As she steps in, the mother asks the children what they did while she was out, but the children are hesitant and do not answer. The story ends with the question, &quot;What would &quot;you&quot; do if your mother asked &quot;you&quot;?&quot;

==Background==

Theodor Geisel, writing as Dr. Seuss, created &quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot; partly in response to the May 24, 1954, &quot;Life&quot; magazine article by John Hersey titled &quot;Why Do Students Bog Down on First R? A Local Committee Sheds Light on a National Problem: Reading&quot;. In the article, Hersey was critical of school primers like those featuring Dick and Jane:

In the classroom boys and girls are confronted with books that have insipid illustrations depicting the slicked-up lives of other children... All feature abnormally courteous, unnaturally clean boys and girls... In bookstores anyone can buy brighter, livelier books featuring strange and wonderful animals and children who behave naturally, i.e., sometimes misbehave... Given incentive from school boards, publishers could do as well with primers. 

After detailing many issues contributing to the dilemma connected with student reading levels, Hersey asked toward the end of the article:

Why should [school primers] not have pictures that widen rather than narrow the associative richness the children give to the words they illustrate—drawings like those of the wonderfully imaginative geniuses among children&#x27;s illustrators, Tenniel, Howard Pyle, &quot;Dr. Seuss&quot;, Walt Disney?

This article caught the attention of William Spaulding, who had met Geisel during the war and who was then the director of Houghton Mifflin&#x27;s education division. Spaulding had also read the best-selling 1955 book &quot;Why Johnny Can&#x27;t Read&quot; by Rudolf Flesch. Flesch, like Hersey, criticized primers as boring but also criticized them for teaching reading through word recognition rather than phonics. In 1955, Spaulding invited Geisel to dinner in Boston where he proposed that Geisel create a book &quot;for six- and seven-year-olds who had already mastered the basic mechanics of reading&quot;. He reportedly challenged, &quot;Write me a story that first-graders can&#x27;t put down!&quot;

At the back of &quot;Why Johnny Can&#x27;t Read&quot;, Flesch had included 72 lists of words that young children should be able to read, and Spaulding provided Geisel with a similar list. Geisel later told biographers Judith and Neil Morgan that Spaulding had supplied him with a list of 348 words that every six-year-old should know and insisted that the book&#x27;s vocabulary be limited to 225 words. However, according to Philip Nel, Geisel gave varying numbers in interviews from 1964 to 1969. He variously claimed that he could use between 200 and 250 words from a list of between 300 and 400; the finished book contains 236 different words.

==Creation==
Geisel gave varying accounts of how he conceived of &quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot;. According to the story Geisel told most often, he was so frustrated with the word list that William Spaulding had given him that he finally decided to scan the list and create a story out of the first two words he found that rhymed. The words he found were &quot;cat&quot; and &quot;hat&quot;. 
Near the end of his life, Geisel told his biographers, Judith and Neil Morgan, that he conceived the beginnings of the story while he was with Spaulding, in an elevator in the Houghton Mifflin offices in Boston. It was an old, shuddering elevator and was operated by a &quot;small, stooped woman wearing &#x27;a leather half-glove and a secret smile&#x27;&quot;. Anita Silvey, recounting a similar story, described the woman as &quot;a very elegant, very petite African-American woman named Annie Williams&quot;. Geisel told Silvey that, when he sketched the Cat in the Hat, he thought of Williams and gave the character Williams&#x27; white gloves and &quot;sly, even foxy smile&quot;.
Geisel gave two conflicting, partly fictionalized accounts of the book&#x27;s creation in two articles, &quot;How Orlo Got His Book&quot; in &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; and &quot;My Hassle with the First Grade Language&quot; in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, both published on November 17, 1957. In &quot;My Hassle with the First Grade Language&quot;, he wrote about his proposal to a &quot;distinguished schoolbook publisher&quot; to write a book for young children about &quot;scaling the peaks of Everest at 60 degrees below&quot;. The publisher was intrigued but informed him that, because of the word list, &quot;you can&#x27;t use the word &quot;scaling&quot;. You can&#x27;t use the word &quot;peaks&quot;. You can&#x27;t use &quot;Everest&quot;. You can&#x27;t use &quot;60&quot;. You can&#x27;t use &quot;degrees&quot;. You can&#x27;t...&quot; Geisel gave a similar account to Robert Cahn for an article in the July 6, 1957, edition of &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;. In &quot;My Hassle With the First Grade Language&quot;, he also told a story of the &quot;three excruciatingly painful weeks&quot; in which he worked on a story about a King Cat and a Queen Cat. However, &quot;queen&quot; was not on the word list, nor did his first grade nephew, Norval, recognize it. So Geisel returned to the work, but could then think only of words that started with the letter &quot;q&quot;, which did not appear in any word on the list. He then had a similar fascination with the letter &quot;z&quot;, which also did not appear in any word on the list. When he did finally finish the book and showed it to his nephew, Norval had already graduated from the first grade and was learning calculus. Philip Nel notes, in his dissection of the article, that Norval was Geisel&#x27;s invention. Geisel&#x27;s niece, Peggy Owens, did have a son, but he was only a one-year-old when the article was published.

In &quot;How Orlo Got His Book&quot;, he described Orlo, a fictional, archetypal young child who was turned off of reading by the poor selection of simple reading material. To save Orlo the frustration, Geisel decided to write a book for children like Orlo but found the task &quot;not dissimilar to... being lost with a witch in a tunnel of love&quot;. He tried to write a story called &quot;The Queen Zebra&quot; but found that both words did not appear on the list. In fact, like Geisel wrote in &quot;My Hassle with the First Grade Language&quot;, the letters &quot;q&quot; and &quot;z&quot; did not appear on the list at all. He then tried to write a story about a bird, without using the word &quot;bird&quot; as it did not appear on the list. He decided to call it a &quot;wing thing&quot; instead, but struggled as he discovered that it &quot;couldn&#x27;t have &quot;legs&quot; or a &quot;beak&quot; or a &quot;tail&quot;. Neither a &quot;left&quot; foot or a &quot;right&quot; foot.&quot; On his approach to writing &quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot; he wrote, &quot;The method I used is the same method you use when you sit down to make apple stroodle [sic] without stroodles.&quot;

Geisel variously stated that the book took between nine and 18 months to create. Donald Pease notes that he worked on it primarily alone, unlike with previous books, which had been more collaborative efforts between Geisel and his wife, Helen. This marked a general trend in his work and life. As Robert L. Bernstein later said of that period, &quot;The more I saw of him, the more he liked being in that room and creating all by himself.&quot; Pease points to Helen&#x27;s recovery from Guillain–Barré syndrome, which she was diagnosed with in 1954, as the marker for this change.

==Publication history==

Geisel agreed to write &quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot; at the request of William Spaulding of Houghton Mifflin; however, because Geisel was under contract with Random House, the head of Random House, Bennett Cerf, made a deal with Houghton Mifflin. Random House retained the rights to trade sales, which encompassed copies of the book sold at book stores, while Houghton Mifflin retained the education rights, which encompassed copies sold to schools.

The Houghton Mifflin edition was released in January or February 1957, and the Random House edition was released on March 1. The two editions featured different covers but were otherwise identical. The first edition can be identified by the &quot;200/200&quot; mark in the top right corner of the front dust jacket flap, signifying the $2.00 selling price. The price was reduced to $1.95 on later editions.

According to Judith and Neil Morgan, the book sold well immediately. The trade edition initially sold an average of 12,000 copies a month, a figure which rose rapidly. Bullock&#x27;s department store in Los Angeles, California, sold out of its first, 100-copy order of the book in a day and quickly reordered 250 more. The Morgans attribute these sales numbers to &quot;playground word-of-mouth&quot;, asserting that children heard about the book from their friends and nagged their parents to buy it for them. However, Houghton Mifflin&#x27;s school edition did not sell as well. As Geisel noted in Jonathan Cott&#x27;s 1983 profile of him, &quot;Houghton Mifflin... had trouble selling it to the schools; there were a lot of Dick and Jane devotees, and my book was considered too fresh and irreverent. But Bennett Cerf at Random House had asked for trade rights, and it just took off in the bookstores.&quot; Geisel told the Morgans, &quot;Parents understood better than school people the necessity for this kind of reader.&quot;

After three years in print, &quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot; had sold nearly one million copies. By then, the book had been translated into French, Chinese, Swedish, and Braille. In 2001, &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; placed it at number nine on its list of the best-selling children&#x27;s books of all time. As of 2007, more than 10 million copies of &quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot; have been printed, and it has been translated into more than 12 different languages, including Latin, under the title &quot;Cattus Petasatus&quot;. In 2007, on the occasion of the book&#x27;s fiftieth anniversary, Random House released &quot;The Annotated Cat: Under the Hats of Seuss and His Cats&quot;, which includes both &quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot; and its sequel, with annotations and an introduction by Philip Nel.

==Reception==

The book was published to immediate critical acclaim. Some reviewers praised the book as an exciting way to learn to read, particularly compared to the primers that it supplanted. Ellen Lewis Buell, in her review for &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;, noted the book&#x27;s heavy use of one-syllable words and lively illustrations. She wrote, &quot;Beginning readers and parents who have been helping them through the dreary activities of Dick and Jane and other primer characters are due for a happy surprise.&quot; Helen Adams Masten of the &quot;Saturday Review&quot; called the book Geisel&#x27;s &quot;tour de force&quot; and wrote, &quot;Parents and teachers will bless Mr. Geisel for this amusing reader with its ridiculous and lively drawings, for their children are going to have the exciting experience of learning that they &quot;can&quot; read after all.&quot; Polly Goodwin of the &quot;Chicago Sunday Tribune&quot; predicted that &quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot; would cause seven- and eight-year-olds to &quot;look with distinct distaste on the drab adventures of standard primer characters&quot;.

Both Helen E. Walker of &quot;Library Journal&quot; and Emily Maxwell of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; felt that the book would appeal to older children as well as to its target audience of first- and second-graders. The reviewer for &quot;The Bookmark&quot; concurred, writing, &quot;Recommended enthusiastically as a picture book as well as a reader&quot;. In contrast, Heloise P. Mailloux wrote in &quot;The Horn Book Magazine&quot;, &quot;This is a fine book for remedial purposes, but self-conscious children often refuse material if it seems meant for younger children.&quot; She felt that the book&#x27;s limited vocabulary kept it from reaching &quot;the absurd excellence of early Seuss books&quot;.

Based on a 2007 online poll, the National Education Association listed &quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot; as one of its &quot;Teachers&#x27; Top 100 Books for Children&quot;. In 2012, it was ranked number 36 among the &quot;Top 100 Picture Books&quot; in a survey published by &quot;School Library Journal&quot; – the third of five Dr. Seuss books on the list. It was awarded the Early Readers BILBY Award in 2004 and 2012.

The book&#x27;s fiftieth anniversary in 2007 prompted a reevaluation of the book from some critics. Yvonne Coppard, reviewing the fiftieth anniversary edition in &quot;Carousel&quot; magazine, wondered if the popularity of the Cat and his &quot;delicious naughty behavior&quot; will endure another fifty years. Coppard wrote, &quot;The innocent ignorance of bygone days has given way to an all-embracing, almost paranoid awareness of child protection issues. And here we have the mysterious stranger who comes in, uninvited, while your mother is out.&quot;

==Analysis==
Philip Nel places the book&#x27;s title character in the tradition of con artists in American art, including the title characters from Meredith Willson&#x27;s &quot;The Music Man&quot; and L. Frank Baum&#x27;s &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;. Nel also contends that Geisel identified with the Cat, pointing to a self portrait of Geisel in which he appears as the Cat, which was published alongside a profile about him in &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; on July 6, 1957. Michael K. Frith, who worked as Geisel&#x27;s editor, concurs, arguing that &quot;The Cat in the Hat and Ted Geisel were inseparable and the same. I think there&#x27;s no question about it. This is someone who delighted in the chaos of life, who delighted in the seeming insanity of the world around him.&quot; Ruth MacDonald asserts that the Cat&#x27;s primary goal in the book is to create fun for the children. The Cat calls it &quot;fun that is funny&quot;, which MacDonald distinguishes from the ordinary, serious fun that parents subject their children to. In an article titled &quot;Was the Cat in the Hat Black?&quot;, Philip Nel draws connections between the Cat and stereotyped depictions of African-Americans, including minstrel shows, Geisel&#x27;s own minstrel-inspired cartoons from early in his career, and the use of the term &quot;cat&quot; to refer to jazz musicians. According to Nel, &quot;Even as [Geisel] wrote books designed to challenge prejudice, he never fully shed the cultural assumptions he grew up with, and was likely unaware of the ways in which his visual imagination replicated the racial ideologies he consciously sought to reject.&quot;
Geisel once called the fish &quot;my version of Cotton Mather&quot;, the Puritan moralist who advised the prosecutors during the Salem witch trials. Betty Mensch and Alan Freeman support this view, writing, &quot;Drawing on old Christian symbolism (the fish was an ancient sign of Christianity) Dr. Seuss portrays the fish as a kind of ever-nagging superego, the embodiment of utterly conventionalized morality.&quot; Philip Nel notes that other critics have also compared the fish to the superego. Anna Quindlen called the Cat &quot;pure id&quot; and marked the children, as mediators between the Cat and the fish, as the ego. Mensch and Freeman, however, argue that the Cat shows elements of both id and ego.

In her analysis of the fish, MacDonald asserts that it represents the voice of the children&#x27;s absent mother. Its conflict with the Cat, not only over the Cat&#x27;s uninvited presence but also their inherent predator-prey relationship, provides the tension of the story. She points out that on the last page, while the children are hesitant to tell their mother about what happened in her absence, the fish gives a knowing look to the readers to assure them &quot;that something did go on but that silence is the better part of valor in this case&quot;. Alison Lurie agrees, writing, &quot;there is a strong suggestion that they might not tell her.&quot; She argues that, in the Cat&#x27;s destruction of the house, &quot;the kids—and not only those in the story, but those who read it—have vicariously given full rein to their destructive impulses without guilt or consequences.&quot; For a 1983 article, Geisel told Jonathan Cott, &quot;&quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot; is a revolt against authority, but it&#x27;s ameliorated by the fact that the Cat cleans up everything at the end. It&#x27;s revolutionary in that it goes as far as Kerensky and then stops. It doesn&#x27;t go quite as far as Lenin.&quot;

Donald Pease notes that &quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot; shares some structural similarities with other Dr. Seuss books. Like earlier books, &quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot; starts with &quot;a child&#x27;s feeling of discontent with his mundane circumstances&quot; which is soon enhanced by make-believe. The book starts in a factual, realistic world, which crosses over into the world of make-believe with the loud bump that heralds the arrival of the Cat. However, this is the first Dr. Seuss book in which the fantasy characters, i.e. the Cat and his companions, are not products of the children&#x27;s imagination. It also differs from previous books in that Sally and her brother actively participate in the fantasy world; they also have a new opinion of the Cat and his world by the story&#x27;s end.

==Legacy==
Ruth MacDonald asserts, &quot;&quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot; is the book that made Dr. Seuss famous. Without &quot;The Cat&quot;, Seuss would have remained a minor light in the history of children&#x27;s literature.&quot; Donald Pease concurs, writing, &quot;&quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot; is the classic in the archive of Dr. Seuss stories for which it serves as a cornerstone and a linchpin. Before writing it Geisel was better known for the &#x27;Quick, Henry, the Flit!&#x27; ad campaign than for his nine children&#x27;s books.&quot; The publication and popularity of the book thrust Geisel into the center of the United States literacy debate, what Pease called &quot;the most important academic controversy&quot; of the Cold War era. Academic Louis Menand contends that &quot;&quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot; transformed the nature of primary education and the nature of children&#x27;s books. It not only stood for the idea that reading ought to be taught by phonics; it also stood for the idea that language skills—and many other subjects—ought to be taught through illustrated storybooks, rather than primers and textbooks.&quot; In 1983, Geisel told Jonathan Cott, &quot;It is the book I&#x27;m proudest of because it had something to do with the death of the &quot;Dick and Jane&quot; primers.&quot;

The book led directly to the creation of Beginner Books, a publishing house centered on producing books like &quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot; for beginning readers. According to Judith and Neil Morgan, when the book caught the attention of Phyllis Cerf, the wife of Geisel&#x27;s publisher, Bennett Cerf, she arranged for a meeting with Geisel, where the two agreed to create Beginner Books. Geisel became the president and editor, and the Cat in the Hat served as their mascot. Geisel&#x27;s wife, Helen, was made third partner. Random House served as distributor until 1960, when Random House purchased Beginner Books. Geisel wrote multiple books for the series, including &quot;The Cat in the Hat Comes Back&quot; (1958), &quot;Green Eggs and Ham&quot; (1960), &quot;Hop on Pop&quot; (1963), and &quot;Fox in Socks&quot; (1965). He initially used word lists of limited vocabularies to create these books, as he had with &quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot;, but moved away from the lists as he came to believe &quot;that a child could learn any amount of words if fed them slowly and if the books were amply illustrated&quot;. Other authors also contributed notable books to the series, including &quot;A Fly Went By&quot; (1958), &quot;Sam and the Firefly&quot; (1958), &quot;Go, Dog. Go!&quot; (1961), and &quot;The Big Honey Hunt&quot; (1962).

The book, or elements of it, has been mentioned multiple times in United States politics. The image of the Cat balancing many objects on his body while in turn balancing himself on a ball has been included in political cartoons and articles. Political caricaturists have portrayed both Bill Clinton and George W. Bush in this way. In 2004, &quot;MAD&quot; magazine published &quot;The Strange Similarities Between the Bush Administration and the World of Dr. Seuss&quot;, an article which matched quotes from White House officials to excerpts taken from Dr. Seuss books, and in which George W. Bush&#x27;s State of the Union promises were contrasted with the Cat vowing (in part), &quot;I can hold up the cup and the milk and the cake! I can hold up these books! And the fish on a rake!&quot; In 2007, during the 110th Congress, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid compared the impasse over a bill to reform immigration with the mess created by the Cat. He read lines of the book from the Senate floor. He then carried forward his analogy hoping the impasse would be straightened out for &quot;If you go back and read Dr. Seuss, the cat manages to clean up the mess.&quot; In 1999, the United States Postal Service issued a stamp featuring the Cat in the Hat.

&quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot;″s popularity also led to increased popularity and exposure for Geisel&#x27;s previous children&#x27;s books. For example, 1940&#x27;s &quot;Horton Hatches the Egg&quot; had sold 5,801 copies in its opening year and 1,645 the following year. In 1958, the year after the publication of &quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot;, 27,643 copies of &quot;Horton&quot; were sold, and by 1960 the book had sold a total of over 200,000 copies.

In 2020, &quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot; placed second on the New York Public Library&#x27;s list of &quot;Top 10 Checkouts of All Time&quot;.

==Adaptations==

&quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot; has been adapted for various media, including theater, television, and film.

===Television===

&quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot; is an animated musical TV special which premiered in 1971 and starred Allan Sherman as the Cat. In 1973, Sherman reprised the role for &quot;Dr. Seuss on the Loose&quot;, where the Cat hosted three stories. The character later appeared in other specials including &quot;The Grinch Grinches the Cat in the Hat&quot; (1982).
The Cat is joined by Little Cats in &quot;The Wubbulous World of Dr. Seuss&quot; (1996-1998), an American puppet series by Jim Henson Productions. Bruce Lanoil voiced the Cat in the show&#x27;s first season, while Martin P. Robinson took over for the second season. The British-Canadian-American animated television series &quot;The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!&quot; (2010-2018) was based on the book series &quot;The Cat in the Hat&#x27;s Learning Library&quot;. Martin Short was the voice of the Cat. Hader previously played the Cat in the Hat in a 2014 &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; sketch.

=== Feature films ===

Spurred by the popularity of the live-action &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas&quot; (2000), Universal Pictures produced &quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot; (2003) starring Mike Myers in the titular role. Seuss&#x27; widow, Audrey Geisel, objected to the portrayal of the author&#x27;s key character, vowing to never again allow live-action adaptations.

Geisel worked with Illumination Entertainment on &quot;The Lorax&quot; (2012). Based on its success, an animated feature of &quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot; was approved. Rob Lieber was set to write the script, with Chris Meledandri as producer, and Audrey Geisel as executive producer, but the project never came to fruition.

In January 2018, Warner Animation Group picked up the rights for the animated &quot;Cat in the Hat&quot; film as part of a creative partnership with Seuss Enterprises. In October 2020, Erica Rivinoja and Art Hernandez were announced as directors. However, in June 2023, Hernandez was replaced by Alessandro Carloni while both Carloni and Rivinoja also wrote the screenplay for the film. In March 2024, Bill Hader was cast in the role of the Cat and set to also serve as an executive producer. Later that month, it was announced that DNEG Animation would provide the animation for the film, Quinta Brunson, Bowen Yang, Xochitl Gomez, Matt Berry, and Paula Pell joined the cast, and that the film would be released on March 6, 2026, after previously being expected for 2024.

=== Other media ===

In 1997, the book was made into a Living Books adaptation for the PC. A video game for Xbox, PlayStation 2, Game Boy Advance, and Microsoft Windows, based on the 2003 film, was published in the same year. 

In 2009, the Royal National Theatre in London created a stage version of the book, adapted and directed by Katie Mitchell. It has since toured the UK and been revived.

&quot;Seussical&quot;, a musical adaptation that incorporates aspects of many Dr. Seuss works, features the Cat in the Hat as narrator. The musical received weak reviews when it opened in November 2000, and closed less than six months later.

Universal Islands of Adventure includes a ride called &quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot;, based on the book.

<doc id="148732" wikidata="Q200032" url="?curid=148732" title="Battle of Manzikert">
<text>The Battle of Manzikert or Malazgirt was fought between the Byzantine Empire and the Seljuk Empire on 26 August 1071 near Manzikert, Iberia (modern Malazgirt in Muş Province, Turkey). The decisive defeat of the Byzantine army and the capture of the emperor Romanos IV Diogenes played an important role in undermining Byzantine authority in Anatolia and Armenia, and allowed for the gradual Turkification of Anatolia. Many Turks, travelling westward during the 11th century, saw the victory at Manzikert as an entrance to Asia Minor.

The brunt of the battle was borne by the Byzantine army&#x27;s professional soldiers from the eastern and western tagmata, as large numbers of mercenaries and Anatolian levies fled early and survived the battle. The fallout from Manzikert was disastrous for the Byzantines, resulting in civil conflicts and an economic crisis that severely weakened the Byzantine Empire&#x27;s ability to defend its borders adequately. This led to the mass movement of Turks into central Anatoliaby 1080, an area of had been gained by the Seljuk Turks. It took three decades of internal strife before Alexius I (1081–1118) restored stability to Byzantium. Historian Thomas Asbridge says: &quot;In 1071, the Seljuqs crushed an imperial army at the Battle of Manzikert (in eastern Asia Minor), and though historians no longer consider this to have been an utterly cataclysmic reversal for the Greeks, it still was a stinging setback.&quot; It was the only time a Byzantine emperor became the prisoner of a Muslim commander, and the first time since Valerian that a Roman emperor was captured alive by an enemy force.

==Background==
Although the Byzantine Empire had remained strong and powerful in the Middle Ages, it began to decline under the reign of the militarily incompetent Constantine IX Monomachos and again under Constantine X Doukasa brief two-year period of reform under Isaac I Komnenos merely delayed the decay of the Byzantine army.

About 1053, Constantine IX disbanded what the 11th century Byzantine historian John Skylitzes called the &quot;Iberian Army&quot;, which consisted of 50,000 men. Skylitzes&#x27; contemporaries, the former officials Michael Attaleiates and Kekaumenos, agree that by demobilizing these soldiers, Constantine did catastrophic harm to the empire&#x27;s eastern defenses. Constantine made a truce with the Seljuks that lasted until 1064, when a large Seljuk army under Alp Arslan attacked the theme of Iberia and took Ani; after a siege of 25 days, they captured the city.

In 1068, Romanos IV Diogenes took power and, after some speedy military reforms, appointed Manuel Komnenos (nephew of Isaac I Komnenos) to lead an expedition against the Seljuks. Manuel captured Hierapolis Bambyce in Syria, next thwarted a Turkish attack against Iconium with a counterattack, but was then defeated and captured by the Seljuks. Despite this success, Alp Arslan quickly sought a peace treaty with the Byzantines, signed in 1069; he saw the Fatimids in Egypt as his main enemy and had no desire to be diverted by unnecessary hostilities.

In February 1071, Romanos sent envoys to Arslan to renew the 1069 treaty; keen to secure his northern flank against attack, to which Arslan agreed. Abandoning the siege of Edessa, he immediately led his army to attack the Fatimid-held Aleppo. However, the peace treaty had been a deliberate distraction: Romanos now led a large army into Armenia to recover the lost fortresses before the Seljuks had time to respond.

==Prelude==
Accompanying Romanos was Andronikos Doukas, son of his rival John Doukas. The army consisted of about professional Byzantine troops from the western provinces and probably about the same number from the eastern provinces. These included long established regular units (, and ) of the central field army (&quot;Tagmata&quot;). Amongst the native Byzantine element of the army were provincial troops from both the eastern and western military &quot;themes&quot;. Under Doukas, the rear guard at Manzikert was largely made up of the private retinues and peasant levies of the border lords (). Finally, the large and diverse host included 500 Frankish and Norman mercenaries under Roussel de Bailleul, some Turkic (Uz and Pecheneg) and Bulgarian mercenaries, infantry under the Duke of Antioch, a contingent of Georgian and Armenian troops and some (but not all) of the Varangian Guard to total around 40,000 men. The quantity of the provincial troops had declined in the years before Romanos, as the government diverted funding to mercenaries who were judged less likely to be involved in politics and could be disbanded after use to save money.

The march across Asia Minor was long and difficult. Romanos brought a luxurious baggage train, which did not endear him to his troops. The local population also suffered plundering by his Frankish mercenaries, whom he was obliged to dismiss. The expedition rested at Sebasteia on the Halys River, reaching Theodosiopolis in June 1071. Some of his generals suggested continuing the march into the Seljuk territory and catching Alp Arslan before he was ready. Others, including Nicephorus Bryennius, suggested they wait and fortify their position. It was decided to continue the march. Then they moved to Khnus city. The Byzantine army, which was heading towards the Malazgirt Plain, chose the route of the Kocasu Stream flowing through Khnus as a route to meet its water needs, and the army manufactured the spears to be used in the war from the trees growing in Khnus and its surroundings.

Thinking that Alp Arslan was either further away or not coming at all, Romanos marched towards Lake Van, expecting to retake Manzikert quickly and the nearby fortress of Khliat if possible. Alp Arslan was already in the area, however, with allies and cavalry from Aleppo and Mosul. Alp Arslan&#x27;s scouts knew exactly where Romanos was, while Romanos was completely unaware of his opponent&#x27;s movements.
Romanos ordered his general Joseph Tarchaniotes to take some of the regular troops and the Varangians and accompany the Pechenegs and Franks to Khliat. At the same time, Romanos and the rest of the army marched to Manzikert. This split the forces into halves of about 20,000 men each. It is unknown what happened to the army sent off with Tarchaniotesaccording to Islamic sources, Alp Arslan smashed this army, yet Byzantine sources make no mention of any such encounter, and Attaliates suggests that Tarchaniotes fled at the sight of the Seljuk Sultanan unlikely event considering the reputation of the Byzantine general. Either way, Romanos&#x27; army was reduced to less than half his planned 40,000 men.

==Battle==
Alp Arslan summoned his army and delivered a speech while dressed in a white robe similar to an Islamic funeral shroud on the morning of the battle. This was an encouraging message that he was ready to die in battle. Romanos was unaware of the loss of Tarchaneiotes and continued to Manzikert, which he easily captured on 23 August; the Seljuks responded with attacks by horse archers. The next day, some foraging parties under Bryennios discovered the main Seljuk force and were forced to retreat to Manzikert. Romanos sent the Armenian general Basilakes and some cavalry, as Romanos did not believe this was Alp Arslan&#x27;s full army. The cavalry was routed, and Basilakes was taken prisoner. Romanos then drew his troops into formation and sent the left wing out under Bryennios, who was almost surrounded by the rapidly approaching Turks and forced to retreat. The Seljuk forces hid among the nearby hills for the night, making it nearly impossible for Romanos to counterattack.

On 25 August, some of Romanos&#x27; Turkic mercenaries came into contact with their Seljuk kin and deserted. Romanos then rejected a Seljuk peace emissary. He wanted to settle the eastern question and the persistent Turkic incursions and settlements with a decisive military victory. He understood that raising another army would be both difficult and expensive. The emperor attempted to recall Tarchaneiotes and his half of the forces, but they were no longer in the area. There were no engagements that day, but on 26 August, the Byzantine army gathered itself into a proper battle formation and began to march on the Seljuk positions, with the left wing under Bryennios, the right wing under Theodore Alyates, and the centre under the emperor. Andronikos Doukas led the reserve forces in the reara foolish mistake by the emperor, considering the dubious loyalties of the Doukas family. The Seljuks were organized into a crescent formation about four kilometres away. Seljuk horse archers attacked the Byzantines as they drew closer; the centre of their crescent continually moved backwards while the wings moved to surround the Byzantine troops.

The Byzantines pressed on despite the arrow attacks and captured Alp Arslan&#x27;s camp by the end of the afternoon. However, the right and left wings, where the arrows did most of their damage, almost broke up when individual units tried to force the Seljuks into a pitched battle; the Seljuk cavalry simply disengaged when challenged, in the characteristic Parthian tactics of steppe warriors. With the Seljuks avoiding battle, Romanos was forced to order a withdrawal by nightfall. However, the right wing misunderstood the order, and Doukas deliberately ignored the emperor&#x27;s order to cover the army&#x27;s withdrawal and marched directly back to the Byzantine camp outside Manzikert. With the Byzantines thoroughly confused, the Seljuks seized the opportunity and attacked. The Byzantine right wing was almost immediately routed, thinking they were betrayed either by the Armenians or the army&#x27;s Turkish auxiliaries. Some authors suppose that Armenians were the first to flee, and they all managed to get away, while by contrast, the Turkish auxiliaries remained loyal to the end. Other sources suggest that Armenian infantry stoutly resisted and did not turn tail, not abandoning the emperor as many had. When Romanos saw the boldness of the Armenian foot soldiers, he displayed great affection for them and promised them unheard-of rewards. In the end, the emperor&#x27;s personal troops and these Armenian foot soldiers suffered the heaviest casualties in the Byzantine army. The left wing under Bryennios held out a little longer but was also soon routed. The remnants of the Byzantine centre, including the emperor and the Varangian Guard, were encircled by the Seljuks. Romanos was wounded and taken prisoner by the Seljuks. The survivors were many who fled the field and were pursued throughout the night, but not beyond that; by dawn, the professional core of the Byzantine army had been destroyed, while many of the peasant troops and levies who had been under the command of Andronikus had fled.

===Captivity of Romanos Diogenes===
When Romanos was conducted into the presence of Alp Arslan, the Sultan refused to believe that the bloodied and tattered man covered in dirt was the mighty Emperor of the Romans. After discovering his identity, Alp Arslan placed his boot on the emperor&#x27;s neck and forced him to kiss the ground, a traditional symbolic gesture at the time. Alp Arslan then treated Romanos with considerable kindness and again offered the terms of peace that he had offered before the battle.

According to Ibn al-Adim, in the presence of Arslan, Romanos blamed the raids of Rashid al-Dawla Mahmud into Byzantine territory for his interventions in Muslim territories which eventually led to the Battle of Manzikert. Romanos remained a captive of the Sultan for a week. During this time, the Sultan allowed Romanos to eat at his table while concessions were agreed upon: Antioch, Edessa, Hierapolis, and Manzikert were to be surrendered. This would have left the vital core of Anatolia untouched. A payment of 10 million gold pieces demanded by the Sultan as a ransom for Romanos was deemed as too high by the latter, so the Sultan reduced its short-term expense by asking for 1.5 million gold pieces as an initial payment instead, followed by an annual sum of gold pieces. Plus, a marriage alliance was prepared between Alp Arslan&#x27;s son and Romanos’ daughter. The Sultan then gave Romanos many presents and an escort of two emirs and one hundred Mamluks on his route to Constantinople.

Shortly after his return to his subjects, Romanos found his rule in serious trouble. Despite attempts to raise loyal troops, he was defeated three times in battle against the Doukas family and was deposed, blinded, and exiled to the island of Proti. He died soon after due to an infection caused by his brutal blinding. Romanos&#x27; final foray into the Anatolian heartland, which he had worked so hard to defend, was a public humiliation.

==Aftermath==

While Manzikert was a long-term strategic catastrophe for Byzantium, it was by no means the massacre that historians earlier presumed. Modern scholars estimate that Byzantine losses were relatively low, considering that many units survived the battle intact and were fighting elsewhere within a few months, and most Byzantine prisoners of war were later released. Certainly, all the commanders on the Byzantine side (Doukas, Tarchaneiotes, Bryennios, Theodore Alyates, de Bailleul, and, above all, the Emperor) survived and took part in later events. Andronikus returned to the capital, Tarchaneiotes did not take part, and Bryennios and all the others, including Romanos, took part in the ensuing civil war. The battle did not directly change the balance of power between the Byzantines and the Seljuks; however, the ensuing civil war within the Byzantine Empire did, to the advantage of the Seljuks.

Doukas had escaped without casualties and quickly marched back to Constantinople, where he led a coup against Romanos and proclaimed his cousin Michael VII as &quot;basileus&quot;. Bryennios also lost a few men in the rout of his wing. The Seljuks did not pursue the fleeing Byzantines, nor did they recapture Manzikert itself at this point. The Byzantine army regrouped and marched to Dokeia, where they were joined by Romanos when he was released a week later. The most serious material loss was the emperor&#x27;s extravagant baggage train.

The result of this disastrous defeat was, in simplest terms, the loss of the Eastern Roman Empire&#x27;s Anatolian heartland. John Julius Norwich says in his trilogy on the Byzantine Empire that the defeat was &quot;its death blow, though centuries remained before the remnant fell. The themes in Anatolia were literally the heart of the empire, and within decades after Manzikert, they were gone.&quot; In his smaller book, &quot;A Short History of Byzantium&quot;, Norwich describes the battle as &quot;the greatest disaster suffered by the Empire in its seven and a half centuries of existence&quot;. Steven Runciman, in his &quot;History of the Crusades&quot;, wrote that &quot;the Battle of Manzikert was the most decisive disaster in Byzantine history. The Byzantines themselves had no illusions about it. Again and again, their historians refer to that dreadful day.&quot;

Anna Komnene, writing a few decades after the actual battle, wrote:

Years and decades later, Manzikert came to be seen as a disaster for the Empire; thus, later sources greatly exaggerated the number of troops and casualties. Byzantine historians would often look back and lament the &quot;disaster&quot; of that day, pinpointing it as the moment the decline of the Empire began. It was not an immediate disaster, but the defeat showed the Seljuks that the Byzantines were not invincible. The usurpation by Andronikos Doukas also politically destabilized the empire, and it was difficult to organize resistance to the Turkic migrations that followed the battle. Finally, while intrigue and the deposition of emperors had taken place before, Romanos&#x27; fate was particularly horrific, and the destabilization caused by it also rippled through the empire for centuries.
What followed the battle was a chain of eventsof which the battle was the first linkthat undermined the Empire in the years to come. They included intrigues for the throne, the fate of Romanos, and Roussel de Bailleul&#x27;s attempting to carve himself an independent kingdom in Galatia with his Frankish, Norman, and German mercenaries. He defeated the Emperor&#x27;s uncle John Doukas, who had come to suppress him, advancing toward the capital to destroy Chrysopolis (Üsküdar) on the Asian coast of the Bosphorus. The Empire finally turned to the Seljuks to crush de Bailleul, which they did. However, the Turks ransomed him back to his wife, and it was only after the young general Alexios Komnenos pursued him that he was captured. These events all interacted to create a vacuum that the Turks filled. Their choice to establish their capital in Nikaea (Iznik) in 1077 could be explained by a desire to see if the Empire&#x27;s struggles could present new opportunities.

In hindsight, both Byzantine and modern historians are unanimous in dating the decline of Byzantine fortunes to this battle. As Paul K. Davis writes, &quot;Byzantine defeat severely limited the power of the Byzantines by denying them control over Anatolia, the major recruiting ground for soldiers. Henceforth, the Muslims controlled the region. The Byzantine Empire was limited to the area immediately around Constantinople, and the Byzantines were never again a serious military force.&quot; It is also seen as one of the root causes for the later Crusades, in that the First Crusade of 1095 was originally a western response to the Byzantine emperor&#x27;s call for military assistance after the loss of Anatolia. From another perspective, the West saw Manzikert as a signal that Byzantium was no longer capable of being the protector of Eastern Christianity or of Christian pilgrims to the Holy Places in the Middle East. Delbrück considers the battle&#x27;s importance exaggerated, but the evidence makes clear that it resulted in the Empire&#x27;s inability to put an effective army into the field for many years.

The Battle of Myriokephalon (or Myriocephalum) has been compared to the Battle of Manzikert as a pivotal point in the decline of the Byzantine Empire. In both battles, separated by over a hundred years, a more elusive Seljuk opponent ambushed a large Byzantine army. However, the implications of Myriocephalum were initially limited, thanks to Manuel I Komnenos&#x27; holding on to power. The same could not be said of Romanos, whose enemies &quot;martyred a courageous and upright man,&quot; and as a result &quot;the Empire ... would never recover.&quot;

== Cultural references ==
In the aftermath of the battle, Norman soldiers who had served in the Byzantine armies spread tales about the defeat and likely inspired an episode in the Chanson de Roland in which the amirant of Babylon, Baligant, fights Charlemagne and is defeated only through the aid of Saint Gabriel.
The largest mosque in Turkey, the Çamlıca Mosque of Istanbul, has four minarets that span , a measurement that refers to the Battle of Manzikert (1071). In 2018, Turkey&#x27;s ruling AKP announced their future agenda for 2023, 2053 and 2071 targets: 100th anniversary of the republic, 600th anniversary of conquest of Istanbul and 1000th anniversary of battle of Manzikert, respectively.

<doc id="148742" wikidata="Q825762" url="?curid=148742" title="GeForce">
<text>GeForce is a brand of graphics processing units (GPUs) designed by Nvidia and marketed for the performance market. As of the GeForce 40 series, there have been eighteen iterations of the design. In August 2017, Nvidia stated that &quot;there are over 200 million GeForce gamers&quot;.

The first GeForce products were discrete GPUs designed for add-on graphics boards, intended for the high-margin PC gaming market, and later diversification of the product line covered all tiers of the PC graphics market, ranging from cost-sensitive GPUs integrated on motherboards to mainstream add-in retail boards. Most recently, GeForce technology has been introduced into Nvidia&#x27;s line of embedded application processors, designed for electronic handhelds and mobile handsets.

With respect to discrete GPUs, found in add-in graphics-boards, Nvidia&#x27;s GeForce and AMD&#x27;s Radeon GPUs are the only remaining competitors in the high-end market. GeForce GPUs are very dominant in the general-purpose graphics processor unit (GPGPU) market thanks to their proprietary Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA). GPGPU is expected to expand GPU functionality beyond the traditional rasterization of 3D graphics, to turn it into a high-performance computing device able to execute arbitrary programming code in the same way a CPU does, but with different strengths (highly parallel execution of straightforward calculations) and weaknesses (worse performance for complex branching code).

== Name origin ==
The &quot;GeForce&quot; name originated from a contest held by Nvidia in early 1999 called &quot;Name That Chip&quot;. The company called out to the public to name the successor to the RIVA TNT2 line of graphics boards. There were over 12,000 entries received and seven winners received a RIVA TNT2 Ultra graphics card as a reward. Brian Burke, senior PR manager at Nvidia, told &quot;Maximum PC&quot; in 2002 that &quot;GeForce&quot; originally stood for &quot;Geometry Force&quot; since GeForce 256 was the first GPU for personal computers to calculate the transform-and-lighting geometry, offloading that function from the CPU.

== Graphics processor generations ==
=== GeForce 256 ===
=== GeForce 2 series ===
Launched in March 2000, the first GeForce2 (NV15) was another high-performance graphics chip. Nvidia moved to a twin texture processor per pipeline (4x2) design, doubling texture fillrate per clock compared to GeForce 256. Later, Nvidia released the GeForce2 MX (NV11), which offered performance similar to the GeForce 256 but at a fraction of the cost. The MX was a compelling value in the low/mid-range market segments and was popular with OEM PC manufacturers and users alike. The GeForce 2 Ultra was the high-end model in this series.

=== GeForce 3 series ===
Launched in February 2001, the GeForce3 (NV20) introduced programmable vertex and pixel shaders to the GeForce family and to consumer-level graphics accelerators. It had good overall performance and shader support, making it popular with enthusiasts although it never hit the midrange price point. The &quot;NV2A&quot; developed for the Microsoft Xbox game console is a derivative of the GeForce 3.

=== GeForce 4 series ===
Launched in February 2002, the then-high-end GeForce4 Ti (NV25) was mostly a refinement to the GeForce3. The biggest advancements included enhancements to anti-aliasing capabilities, an improved memory controller, a second vertex shader, and a manufacturing process size reduction to increase clock speeds. Another member of the GeForce 4 family, the budget GeForce4 MX was based on the GeForce2, with the addition of some features from the GeForce4 Ti. It targeted the value segment of the market and lacked pixel shaders. Most of these models used the AGP 4× interface, but a few began the transition to AGP 8×.

=== GeForce FX series ===
Launched in 2003, the GeForce FX (NV30) was a huge change in architecture compared to its predecessors. The GPU was designed not only to support the new Shader Model 2 specification but also to perform well on older titles. However, initial models like the GeForce FX 5800 Ultra suffered from weak floating point shader performance and excessive heat which required infamously noisy two-slot cooling solutions. Products in this series carry the 5000 model number, as it is the fifth generation of the GeForce, though Nvidia marketed the cards as GeForce FX instead of GeForce 5 to show off &quot;the dawn of cinematic rendering&quot;.

=== GeForce 6 series ===
Launched in April 2004, the GeForce 6 (NV40) added Shader Model 3.0 support to the GeForce family, while correcting the weak floating point shader performance of its predecessor. It also implemented high-dynamic-range imaging and introduced SLI (Scalable Link Interface) and PureVideo capability (integrated partial hardware MPEG-2, VC-1, Windows Media Video, and H.264 decoding and fully accelerated video post-processing).

=== GeForce 7 series ===
The seventh generation GeForce (G70/NV47) was launched in June 2005 and was the last Nvidia video card series that could support the AGP bus. The design was a refined version of GeForce 6, with the major improvements being a widened pipeline and an increase in clock speed. The GeForce 7 also offers new transparency supersampling and transparency multisampling anti-aliasing modes (TSAA and TMAA). These new anti-aliasing modes were later enabled for the GeForce 6 series as well. The GeForce 7950GT featured the highest performance GPU with an AGP interface in the Nvidia line. This era began the transition to the PCI-Express interface.

A 128-bit, eight render output unit (ROP) variant of the 7800 GTX, called the RSX Reality Synthesizer, is used as the main GPU in the Sony PlayStation 3.

=== GeForce 8 series ===
Released on November 8, 2006, the eighth-generation GeForce (originally called G80) was the first ever GPU to fully support Direct3D 10. Manufactured using a 90 nm process and built around the new Tesla microarchitecture, it implemented the unified shader model. Initially just the 8800GTX model was launched, while the GTS variant was released months into the product line&#x27;s life, and it took nearly six months for mid-range and OEM/mainstream cards to be integrated into the 8 series. The die shrink down to 65 nm and a revision to the G80 design, codenamed G92, were implemented into the 8 series with the 8800GS, 8800GT and 8800GTS-512, first released on October 29, 2007, almost one whole year after the initial G80 release.

=== GeForce 9 series and 100 series ===
The first product was released on February 21, 2008. Not even four months older than the initial G92 release, all 9-series designs are simply revisions to existing late 8-series products. The 9800GX2 uses two G92 GPUs, as used in later 8800 cards, in a dual PCB configuration while still only requiring a single PCI-Express 16x slot. The 9800GX2 utilizes two separate 256-bit memory busses, one for each GPU and its respective 512 MB of memory, which equates to an overall of 1 GB of memory on the card (although the SLI configuration of the chips necessitates mirroring the frame buffer between the two chips, thus effectively halving the memory performance of a 256-bit/512 MB configuration). The later 9800GTX features a single G92 GPU, 256-bit data bus, and 512 MB of GDDR3 memory.

Prior to the release, no concrete information was known except that the officials claimed the next generation products had close to 1 TFLOPS processing power with the GPU cores still being manufactured in the 65 nm process, and reports about Nvidia downplaying the significance of Direct3D 10.1. In March 2009, several sources reported that Nvidia had quietly launched a new series of GeForce products, namely the GeForce 100 Series, which consists of rebadged 9 Series parts. GeForce 100 series products were not available for individual purchase.

=== GeForce 200 series and 300 series ===
Based on the GT200 graphics processor consisting of 1.4 billion transistors, codenamed Tesla, the 200 series was launched on June 16, 2008. The next generation of the GeForce series takes the card-naming scheme in a new direction, by replacing the series number (such as 8800 for 8-series cards) with the GTX or GTS suffix (which used to go at the end of card names, denoting their &#x27;rank&#x27; among other similar models), and then adding model-numbers such as 260 and 280 after that. The series features the new GT200 core on a 65nm die. The first products were the GeForce GTX 260 and the more expensive GeForce GTX 280. The GeForce 310 was released on November 27, 2009, which is a rebrand of GeForce 210. The 300 series cards are rebranded DirectX 10.1 compatible GPUs from the 200 series, which were not available for individual purchase.

=== GeForce 400 series and 500 series ===
On April 7, 2010, Nvidia released the GeForce GTX 470 and GTX 480, the first cards based on the new Fermi architecture, codenamed GF100; they were the first Nvidia GPUs to utilize 1 GB or more of GDDR5 memory. The GTX 470 and GTX 480 were heavily criticized due to high power use, high temperatures, and very loud noise that were not balanced by the performance offered, even though the GTX 480 was the fastest DirectX 11 card as of its introduction.

In November 2010, Nvidia released a new flagship GPU based on an enhanced GF100 architecture (GF110) called the GTX 580. It featured higher performance, less power utilization, heat and noise than the preceding GTX 480. This GPU received much better reviews than the GTX 480. Nvidia later also released the GTX 590, which packs two GF110 GPUs on a single card.

=== GeForce 600 series, 700 series and 800M series ===

In September 2010, Nvidia announced that the successor to Fermi microarchitecture would be the Kepler microarchitecture, manufactured with the TSMC 28 nm fabrication process. Earlier, Nvidia had been contracted to supply their top-end GK110 cores for use in Oak Ridge National Laboratory&#x27;s &quot;Titan&quot; supercomputer, leading to a shortage of GK110 cores. After AMD launched their own annual refresh in early 2012, the Radeon HD 7000 series, Nvidia began the release of the GeForce 600 series in March 2012. The GK104 core, originally intended for their mid-range segment of their lineup, became the flagship GTX 680. It introduced significant improvements in performance, heat, and power efficiency compared to the Fermi architecture and closely matched AMD&#x27;s flagship Radeon HD 7970. It was quickly followed by the dual-GK104 GTX 690 and the GTX 670, which featured only a slightly cut-down GK104 core and was very close in performance to the GTX 680.

With the GTX Titan, Nvidia also released GPU Boost 2.0, which would allow the GPU clock speed to increase indefinitely until a user-set temperature limit was reached without passing a user-specified maximum fan speed. The final GeForce 600 series release was the GTX 650 Ti BOOST based on the GK106 core, in response to AMD&#x27;s Radeon HD 7790 release. At the end of May 2013, Nvidia announced the 700 series, which was still based on the Kepler architecture, however it featured a GK110-based card at the top of the lineup. The GTX 780 was a slightly cut-down Titan that achieved nearly the same performance for two-thirds of the price. It featured the same advanced reference cooler design, but did not have the unlocked double-precision cores and was equipped with 3 GB of memory.

At the same time, Nvidia announced ShadowPlay, a screen capture solution that used an integrated H.264 encoder built into the Kepler architecture that Nvidia had not revealed previously. It could be used to record gameplay without a capture card, and with negligible performance decrease compared to software recording solutions, and was available even on the previous generation GeForce 600 series cards. The software beta for ShadowPlay, however, experienced multiple delays and would not be released until the end of October 2013. A week after the release of the GTX 780, Nvidia announced the GTX 770 to be a rebrand of the GTX 680. It was followed by the GTX 760 shortly after, which was also based on the GK104 core and similar to the GTX 660 Ti. No more 700 series cards were set for release in 2013, although Nvidia announced G-Sync, another feature of the Kepler architecture that Nvidia had left unmentioned, which allowed the GPU to dynamically control the refresh rate of G-Sync-compatible monitors which would release in 2014, to combat tearing and judder. However, in October, AMD released the R9 290X, which came in at $100 less than the GTX 780. In response, Nvidia slashed the price of the GTX 780 by $150 and released the GTX 780 Ti, which featured a full 2880-core GK110 core even more powerful than the GTX Titan, along with enhancements to the power delivery system which improved overclocking, and managed to pull ahead of AMD&#x27;s new release.

The GeForce 800M series consists of rebranded 700M series parts based on the Kepler architecture and some lower-end parts based on the newer Maxwell architecture.

=== GeForce 900 series ===
In March 2013, Nvidia announced that the successor to Kepler would be the Maxwell microarchitecture. It was released in September 2014, with the GM10x series chips, emphasizing the new power efficiency architectural improvements in OEM, and low TDP products in desktop GTX 750/750 ti, and mobile GTX 850M/860M. Later that year Nvidia pushed the TDP with the GM20x chips for power users, skipping the 800 series for desktop entirely, with the 900 series of GPUs.

This was the last GeForce series to support analog video output through DVI-I. Although, analog display adapters exist and are able to convert a digital Display Port, HDMI, or DVI-D (Digital).

=== GeForce 10 series ===

In March 2014, Nvidia announced that the successor to Maxwell would be the Pascal microarchitecture; announced on May 6, 2016, and were released several weeks later on May 27 and June 10, respectively. Architectural improvements include the following:
* In Pascal, an SM (streaming multiprocessor) consists of 128 CUDA cores. Kepler packed 192, Fermi 32 and Tesla only 8 CUDA cores into an SM; the GP100 SM is partitioned into two processing blocks, each having 32 single-precision CUDA Cores, an instruction buffer, a warp scheduler, 2 texture mapping units and 2 dispatch units.
* GDDR5XNew memory standard supporting 10 Gbit/s data rates and an updated memory controller. Only the Nvidia Titan X (and Titan Xp), GTX 1080, GTX 1080 Ti, and GTX 1060 (6 GB Version) support GDDR5X. The GTX 1070 Ti, GTX 1070, GTX 1060 (3 GB version), GTX 1050 Ti, and GTX 1050 use GDDR5.
* Unified memoryA memory architecture, where the CPU and GPU can access both main system memory and memory on the graphics card with the help of a technology called &quot;Page Migration Engine&quot;.
* NVLinkA high-bandwidth bus between the CPU and GPU, and between multiple GPUs. Allows much higher transfer speeds than those achievable by using PCI Express; estimated to provide between 80 and 200 GB/s.
* 16-bit (FP16) floating-point operations can be executed at twice the rate of 32-bit floating-point operations (&quot;single precision&quot;) and 64-bit floating-point operations (&quot;double precision&quot;) executed at half the rate of 32-bit floating point operations (Maxwell 1/32 rate).
* More advanced process node, TSMC 12 nm instead of the older TSMC 28 nm

=== GeForce 20 series and 16 series ===

In August 2018, Nvidia announced the GeForce successor to Pascal. The new microarchitecture name was revealed as &quot;Turing&quot; at the Siggraph 2018 conference. This new GPU microarchitecture is aimed to accelerate the real-time ray tracing support and AI Inferencing. It features a new Ray Tracing unit (RT Core) which can dedicate processors to the ray tracing in hardware. It supports the DXR extension in Microsoft DirectX 12. Nvidia claims the new architecture is up to 6 times faster than the older Pascal architecture. A whole new Tensor core design since Volta introduces AI deep learning acceleration, which allows the utilisation of DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling), a new form of anti-aliasing that uses AI to provide crisper imagery with less impact on performance. It also changes its integer execution unit which can execute in parallel with the floating point data path. A new unified cache architecture which doubles its bandwidth compared with previous generations was also announced.

The new GPUs were revealed as the Quadro RTX 8000, Quadro RTX 6000 and Quadro RTX 5000. The high end Quadro RTX 8000 features 4,608 CUDA cores and 576 Tensor cores with 48 GB of VRAM. Later during the Gamescom press conference, Nvidia&#x27;s CEO Jensen Huang, unveiled the new GeForce RTX series with RTX 2080 Ti, 2080, and 2070 that will use the Turing architecture. The first Turing cards were slated to ship to consumers on September 20, 2018. Nvidia announced the RTX 2060 on January 6, 2019, at CES 2019.

On July 2, 2019, Nvidia announced the GeForce RTX Super line of cards, a 20 series refresh which comprises higher-spec versions of the RTX 2060, 2070 and 2080. The RTX 2070 and 2080 were discontinued.

In February 2019, Nvidia announced the GeForce 16 series. It is based on the same Turing architecture used in the GeForce 20 series, but disabling the Tensor (AI) and RT (ray tracing) cores to provide more affordable graphic cards for gamers while still attaining a higher performance compared to respective cards of the previous GeForce generations.

Like the RTX Super refresh, Nvidia on October 29, 2019, announced the GTX 1650 Super and 1660 Super cards, which replaced their non-Super counterparts.

On June 28, 2022, Nvidia quietly released their GTX 1630 card, which was meant for low-end gamers.

=== GeForce 30 series ===

Nvidia officially announced at the GeForce Special Event that the successor to GeForce 20 series will be the 30 series, it is built on the Ampere microarchitecture. The GeForce Special Event introduced took place on September 1, 2020, and set September 17th as the official release date for the RTX 3080 GPU, September 24 for the RTX 3090 GPU and October 29th for the RTX 3070 GPU. With the latest GPU launch being the RTX 3090 Ti. The RTX 3090 Ti is the highest-end Nvidia GPU on the Ampere microarchitecture, it features a fully unlocked GA102 die built on the Samsung 8 nm node due to supply shortages with TSMC. The RTX 3090 Ti has 10,752 CUDA cores, 336 Tensor cores and texture mapping units, 112 ROPs, 84 RT cores, and 24 gigabytes of GDDR6X memory with a 384-bit bus. When compared to the RTX 2080 Ti, the 3090 Ti has 6,400 more CUDA cores. Due to the global chip shortage, the 30 series was controversial as scalpers and high demand meant that GPU prices skyrocketed for the 30 series and the AMD RX 6000 series.

=== GeForce 40 series ===
On September 20, 2022, Nvidia announced its GeForce 40 Series graphics cards. These came out as the RTX 4090, on October 12, 2022, the RTX 4080, on November 16, 2022, the RTX 4070 Ti, on January 3, 2023, with the RTX 4070, on April 13, 2023, and the RTX 4060 Ti on May 24, 2023, and the RTX 4060, following on June 29, 2023. These were built on the Ada Lovelace architecture, with current part numbers being, &quot;AD102&quot;, &quot;AD103&quot;, &quot;AD104&quot; &quot;AD106&quot; and &quot;AD107&quot;. These parts are manufactured using the TSMC N4 process node which is a custom-designed process for Nvidia. At the time, the RTX 4090 was the fastest chip for the mainstream market that has been released by a major company, consisting of around 16,384 CUDA cores, boost clocks of 2.2 / 2.5 GHz, 24 GB of GDDR6X, a 384-bit memory bus, 128 3rd gen RT cores, 512 4th gen Tensor cores, DLSS 3.0 and a TDP of 450W. From October to December 2024, the RTX 4090, 4080, 4070 and relating variants were officially discontinued, marking the end of a two-year production run, in order to free up production space for the coming RTX 50 series.

Notably, a China-only edition of the RTX 4090 was released, named the RTX 4090D (Dragon). The RTX 4090D features a shaved down AD102 die with 14592 CUDA cores, down from 16384 cores of the original 4090. This was primarily owing to the United States Department of Commerce beginning the enactment of restrictions on the Nvidia RTX 4090 for export to certain countries in 2023. This was targeted mainly towards China as an attempt to halt its AI development.

The 40 series saw Nvidia re-releasing the &#x27;Super&#x27; variant of graphics cards, not seen since the 20 series, as well as being the first generation in Nvidia&#x27;s lineup to combine both &#x27;Super&#x27; and &#x27;Ti&#x27; brandings together. This began with the release of the RTX 4070 Super in January 17, 2024, following with the RTX 4070 Ti Super in January 24, 2024, and the RTX 4080 Super in January 31, 2024.

=== GeForce 50 series (Current) ===

The GeForce 50 series, based on the Blackwell microarchitecture, was announced at CES 2025, with availability starting in January. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang presented prices for the RTX 5070, RTX 5070 Ti, RTX 5080, and RTX 5090.

== Variants ==

=== Mobile GPUs ===

Since the GeForce 2 series, Nvidia has produced a number of graphics chipsets for notebook computers under the &quot;GeForce Go&quot; branding. Most of the features present in the desktop counterparts are present in the mobile ones. These GPUs are generally optimized for lower power consumption and less heat output in order to be used in notebook PCs and small desktops.

Beginning with the GeForce 8 series, the &quot;GeForce Go&quot; brand was discontinued and the mobile GPUs were integrated with the main line of GeForce GPUs, but their name suffixed with an &quot;M&quot;. This ended in 2016 with the launch of the laptop GeForce 10 series – Nvidia dropped the &quot;M&quot; suffix, opting to unify the branding between their desktop and laptop GPU offerings, as notebook Pascal GPUs are almost as powerful as their desktop counterparts (something Nvidia tested with their &quot;desktop-class&quot; notebook GTX 980 GPU back in 2015).

The &quot;GeForce MX&quot; brand, previously used by Nvidia for their entry-level desktop GPUs, was revived in 2017 with the release of the GeForce MX150 for notebooks. The MX150 is based on the same Pascal GP108 GPU as used on the desktop GT 1030, and was quietly released in June 2017.

=== Small form factor GPUs ===
Similar to the mobile GPUs, Nvidia also released a few GPUs in &quot;small form factor&quot; format, for use in all-in-one desktops. These GPUs are suffixed with an &quot;S&quot;, similar to the &quot;M&quot; used for mobile products.

=== Integrated desktop motherboard GPUs ===
Beginning with the nForce 4, Nvidia started including onboard graphics solutions in their motherboard chipsets. These were called mGPUs (motherboard GPUs). Nvidia discontinued the nForce range, including these mGPUs, in 2009.

After the nForce range was discontinued, Nvidia released their Ion line in 2009, which consisted of an Intel Atom CPU partnered with a low-end GeForce 9 series GPU, fixed on the motherboard. Nvidia released an upgraded &quot;Ion 2&quot; in 2010, this time containing a low-end GeForce 300 series GPU.

== Nomenclature ==
From the GeForce 4 series until the GeForce 9 series, the naming scheme below is used.

Since the release of the GeForce 100 series of GPUs, Nvidia changed their product naming scheme to the one below.


* Earlier cards such as the GeForce4 follow a similar pattern.
* cf. Nvidia&#x27;s Performance Graph here.

== Graphics device drivers ==

=== Official proprietary ===
Nvidia develops and publishes GeForce drivers for Windows 10 x86/x86-64 and later, Linux x86/x86-64/ARMv7-A, OS X 10.5 and later, Solaris x86/x86-64 and FreeBSD x86/x86-64. A current version can be downloaded from Nvidia and most Linux distributions contain it in their own repositories. Nvidia GeForce driver 340.24 from 8 July 2014 supports the EGL interface enabling support for Wayland in conjunction with this driver. This may be different for the Nvidia Quadro brand, which is based on identical hardware but features OpenGL-certified graphics device drivers. On the same day the Vulkan graphics API was publicly released, Nvidia released drivers that fully supported it. Nvidia has released drivers with optimizations for specific video games concurrent with their release since 2014, having released 150 drivers supporting 400 games in April 2022.

Basic support for the DRM mode-setting interface in the form of a new kernel module named codice_1 has been available since version 358.09 beta.
The support of Nvidia&#x27;s display controller on the supported GPUs is centralized in codice_1. Traditional display interactions (X11 modesets, OpenGL SwapBuffers, VDPAU presentation, SLI, stereo, framelock, G-Sync, etc.) initiate from the various user-mode driver components and flow to codice_1.

In May 2022, Nvidia announced that it would release a partially open-source driver for the (GSP enabled) Turing architecture and newer, in order to enhance the ability for it to be packaged as part of Linux distributions. At launch Nvidia considered the driver to be alpha quality for consumer GPUs, and production ready for datacenter GPUs. Currently the userspace components of the driver (including OpenGL, Vulkan, and CUDA) remain proprietary. In addition, the open-source components of the driver are only a wrapper (CPU-RM) for the GPU System Processor (GSP) firmware, a RISC-V binary blob that is now required for running the open-source driver. The GPU System Processor is a RISC-V coprocessor codenamed &quot;Falcon&quot; that is used to offload GPU initialization and management tasks. The driver itself is still split for the host CPU portion (CPU-RM) and the GSP portion (GSP-RM). Windows 11 and Linux proprietary drivers also support enabling GSP and make even gaming faster. CUDA supports GSP since version 11.6. Upcoming Linux kernel 6.7 will support GSP in Nouveau.

=== Third-party free and open-source ===

Community-created, free and open-source drivers exist as an alternative to the drivers released by Nvidia. Open-source drivers are developed primarily for Linux, however there may be ports to other operating systems. The most prominent alternative driver is the reverse-engineered free and open-source &quot;nouveau&quot; graphics device driver. Nvidia has publicly announced to not provide any support for such additional device drivers for their products, although Nvidia has contributed code to the Nouveau driver.

Free and open-source drivers support a large portion (but not all) of the features available in GeForce-branded cards. For example, nouveau driver lacks support for the GPU and memory clock frequency adjustments, and for associated dynamic power management. Also, Nvidia&#x27;s proprietary drivers consistently perform better than nouveau in various benchmarks. However, and version 3.16 of the Linux kernel mainline, contributions by Nvidia allowed partial support for GPU and memory clock frequency adjustments to be implemented.

=== Licensing and privacy issues ===

The license has common terms against reverse engineering and copying, and it disclaims warranties and liability.

Starting in 2016 the GeForce license says Nvidia &quot;SOFTWARE may access, collect non-personally identifiable information about, update, and configure Customer&#x27;s system in order to properly optimize such system for use with the SOFTWARE.&quot; The privacy notice goes on to say, &quot;We are not able to respond to &quot;Do Not Track&quot; signals set by a browser at this time. We also permit third party online advertising networks and social media companies to collect information... We may combine personal information that we collect about you with the browsing and tracking information collected by these [cookies and beacons] technologies.&quot;

The software configures the user&#x27;s system to optimize its use, and the license says, &quot;NVIDIA will have no responsibility for any damage or loss to such system (including loss of data or access) arising from or relating to (a) any changes to the configuration, application settings, environment variables, registry, drivers, BIOS, or other attributes of the system (or any part of such system) initiated through the SOFTWARE&quot;.

=== GeForce Experience ===

GeForce Experience is a program containing several tools, including Nvidia ShadowPlay. In August 2017, GeForce Experience was installed on 90 million PCs.

Due to a serious security vulnerability before the March 26, 2019, security update, users of GeForce Experience were vulnerable to remote code execution, denial of service, and privilege escalation attacks.
When installing new drivers, GeForce Experience may force the system to restart after a 60-second countdown, without giving the user any choice.

On November 12, 2024, the application was officially replaced with the Nvidia App, which released in version 1.0.

=== Nvidia App ===
The Nvidia App is a program that is intended to replace both GeForce Experience and the Nvidia Control Panel which can be downloaded from Nvidia&#x27;s website. In August 2024, it was in a beta version. On November 12, 2024, version 1.0 was released, marking its stable release.

New features include an overhauled user interface, a new in-game overlay, support for ShadowPlay with 120 fps, as well as RTX HDR and RTX Dynamic Vibrance, which are AI-based in-game filters that enable HDR and increase color saturation in any DirectX 9 (and newer) or Vulkan game, respectively.

The Nvidia App also features Auto Tuning, which adjusts the GPU&#x27;s clock rate based on regular hardware scans to ensure optimal performance. According to Nvidia, this feature will not cause any damage to the GPU and retain its warranty. However, it might cause instability issues. The feature is similar to the GeForce Experience&#x27;s &quot;Enable automatic tuning&quot; option, which was released in 2021, with the difference being that this was a one-off overclocking feature that did not adjust the GPU&#x27;s clock speed on a regular basis.

In January 2025, Nvidia added Smooth Motion to the Nvidia App, a feature similar to Frame Generation which generates an extra frame between two natively randered frames. Because the feature is driver-based, it also works in games that do not support DLSS&#x27;s Frame Generation option. As of its release, the feature is only available on GeForce 50 series GPUs, though Nvidia stated they will add support for GeForce 40 series GPUs in the future as well.

<text>The GeForce 256 is the original release in Nvidia&#x27;s &quot;GeForce&quot; product line. Announced on August 31, 1999 and released on October 11, 1999, the GeForce 256 improves on its predecessor (RIVA TNT2) by increasing the number of fixed pixel pipelines, offloading host geometry calculations to a hardware transform and lighting (T&amp;L) engine, and adding hardware motion compensation for MPEG-2 video. It offered a notable leap in 3D PC gaming performance and was the first fully Direct3D 7-compliant 3D accelerator.

==Architecture==

GeForce 256 was marketed as &quot;the world&#x27;s first &#x27;GPU&#x27;, or Graphics Processing Unit&quot;, a term Nvidia defined at the time as &quot;a single-chip processor with integrated transform, lighting, triangle setup/clipping, and rendering engines that is capable of processing a minimum of 10 million polygons per second&quot;.

The &quot;256&quot; in its name stems from the &quot;256-bit QuadPipe Rendering Engine&quot;, a term describing the four 64-bit pixel pipelines of the NV10 chip. In single-textured games NV10 could put out 4 pixels per cycle, while a two-textured scenario would limit this to 2 multitextured pixels per cycle, as the chip still had only one TMU per pipeline, just as TNT2. In terms of rendering features, GeForce 256 also added support for cube environment mapping and dot-product (Dot3) bump mapping.

The integration of the transform and lighting hardware into the GPU itself set the GeForce 256 apart from older 3D accelerators that relied on the CPU to perform these calculations (also known as software transform and lighting). This reduction of 3D graphics solution complexity brought the cost of such hardware to a new low and made it accessible to cheap consumer graphics cards instead of being limited to the previous expensive professionally oriented niche designed for computer-aided design (CAD). NV10&#x27;s T&amp;L engine also allowed Nvidia to enter the CAD market with dedicated cards for the first time, with a product called Quadro. The Quadro line uses the same silicon chips as the GeForce cards, but has different driver support and certifications tailored to the unique requirements of CAD applications.

The chip was manufactured by TSMC using its 220 nm CMOS process. 

There was only one GeForce 256 release, as succeeding GeForce products would have varying chip speeds. However there were two memory configurations, with the SDR version released in October 1999 and the DDR version released in mid-December 1999each with a different type of SDRAM memory. The SDR version uses SDR SDRAM memory from Samsung Electronics, while the later DDR version uses DDR SDRAM memory from Hyundai Electronics (now SK Hynix).

==Product comparisons==
Compared to previous high-end 3D game accelerators, such as 3dfx Voodoo3 3500 and Nvidia RIVA TNT2 Ultra, GeForce provided up to a 50% or greater improvement in frame rate in some games (ones specifically written to take advantage of the hardware T&amp;L) when coupled with a very-low-budget CPU. The later release and widespread adoption of GeForce 2 MX/4 MX cards with the same feature set meant unusually long support for the GeForce 256, until approximately 2006, in games such as Star Wars: Empire at War or Half-Life 2, the latter of which featured a Direct3D 7-compatible path, using a subset of Direct3D 9 to target the fixed-function pipeline of these GPUs.

Without broad application support at the time, critics pointed out that the T&amp;L technology had little real-world value. Initially, it was only somewhat beneficial in certain situations in a few OpenGL-based 3D first-person shooters, most notably &quot;Quake III Arena&quot;. Benchmarks using low-budget CPUs like the Celeron 300A would give favourable results for the GeForce 256, but benchmarks done with some CPUs such as the Pentium II 300 would give better results with some older graphics cards like the 3dfx Voodoo 2. 3dfx and other competing graphics-card companies pointed out that a fast CPU could more than make up for the lack of a T&amp;L unit. Software support for hardware T&amp;L was not commonplace until several years after the release of the first GeForce. Early drivers were buggy and slow, while 3dfx cards enjoyed efficient, high-speed, mature Glide API and/or MiniGL support for the majority of games. Only after the GeForce 256 was replaced by the GeForce 2, and ATI&#x27;s T&amp;L-equipped Radeon was also on the market, did hardware T&amp;L become a widely utilized feature in games.

The GeForce 256 was also quite expensive for the time and didn&#x27;t offer tangible advantages over competitors&#x27; products outside of 3D acceleration. For example, its GUI and video playback acceleration were not significantly better than that offered by competition or even older Nvidia products. Additionally, some GeForce cards were plagued with poor analog signal circuitry, which caused display output to be blurry.

As CPUs became faster, the GeForce 256 demonstrated that the disadvantage of hardware T&amp;L is that, if a CPU is fast enough, it can perform T&amp;L functions faster than the GPU, thus making the GPU a hindrance to rendering performance. This changed the way the graphics market functioned, encouraging shorter graphics-card lifetimes and placing less emphasis on the CPU for gaming.

===Motion compensation===
The GeForce 256 introduced motion compensation as a functional unit of the NV10 chip, this first-generation unit would be succeeded by Nvidia&#x27;s HDVP (High-Definition Video Processor) in GeForce 2 GTS.

<text>The GeForce FX or &quot;GeForce 5&quot; series (codenamed NV30) is a line of graphics processing units from the manufacturer Nvidia.

==Overview==
Nvidia&#x27;s GeForce FX series is the fifth generation of the GeForce line. With GeForce 3, the company introduced programmable shader functionality into their 3D architecture, in line with the release of Microsoft&#x27;s DirectX 8.0. The GeForce 4 Ti was an enhancement of the GeForce 3 technology. With real-time 3D graphics technology continually advancing, the release of DirectX 9.0 brought further refinement of programmable pipeline technology with the arrival of Shader Model 2.0. The GeForce FX series is Nvidia&#x27;s first generation Direct3D 9-compliant hardware.
The series was manufactured on TSMC&#x27;s 130 nm fabrication process. It is compliant with Shader Model 2.0/2.0A, allowing more flexibility in complex shader/fragment programs and much higher arithmetic precision. It supports a number of new memory technologies, including DDR2, GDDR2 and GDDR3 and saw Nvidia&#x27;s first implementation of a memory data bus wider than 128 bits. The anisotropic filtering implementation has potentially higher quality than previous Nvidia designs. Anti-aliasing methods have been enhanced and additional modes are available compared to GeForce 4. Memory bandwidth and fill-rate optimization mechanisms have been improved. Some members of the series offer double fill-rate in z-buffer/stencil-only passes.

The series also brought improvements to the company&#x27;s video processing hardware, in the form of the Video Processing Engine (VPE), which was first deployed in the GeForce 4 MX. The primary addition, compared to previous Nvidia GPUs, was per-pixel video-deinterlacing.

The initial version of the GeForce FX (the 5800) was one of the first cards to come equipped with a large dual-slot cooler. Called &quot;Flow FX&quot;, the cooler was very large in comparison to ATI&#x27;s small, single-slot cooler on the 9700 series. It was jokingly referred to as the &quot;Dustbuster&quot;, due to a high level of fan noise.

The advertising campaign for the GeForce FX featured the &quot;Dawn&quot;, which was the work of several veterans from the computer animation Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within. Nvidia touted it as &quot;The Dawn of Cinematic Computing&quot;.

Nvidia debuted a new campaign to motivate developers to optimize their titles for Nvidia hardware at the Game Developers Conference (GDC) in 2002. In exchange for prominently displaying the Nvidia logo on the outside of the game packaging, the company offered free access to a state-of-the-art test lab in Eastern Europe, that tested against 500 different PC configurations for compatibility. Developers also had extensive access to Nvidia engineers, who helped produce code optimized for the company&#x27;s products.

Hardware based on the NV30 project didn&#x27;t launch until near the end of 2002, several months after ATI had released their competing DirectX 9 architecture.

== Overall performance ==

GeForce FX is an architecture designed with DirectX 7, 8 and 9 software in mind. Its performance for DirectX 7 and 8 was generally equal to ATI&#x27;s competing products with the mainstream versions of the chips, and somewhat faster in the case of the 5900 and 5950 models, but it is much less competitive across the entire range for software that primarily uses DirectX 9 features. 

Its weak performance in processing Shader Model 2 programs is caused by several factors. The NV3x design has less overall parallelism and calculation throughput than its competitors. It is more difficult, compared to GeForce 6 and ATI Radeon R300 series, to achieve high efficiency with the architecture due to architectural weaknesses and a resulting heavy reliance on optimized pixel shader code. While the architecture was compliant overall with the DirectX 9 specification, it was optimized for performance with 16-bit shader code, which is less than the 24-bit minimum that the standard requires. When 32-bit shader code is used, the architecture&#x27;s performance is severely hampered. Proper instruction ordering and instruction composition of shader code is critical for making most of the available computational resources.

==Hardware refreshes and diversification==

Nvidia&#x27;s initial release, the GeForce FX 5800, was intended as a high-end part. At the time, there were no GeForce FX products for the other segments of the market. The GeForce 4 MX continued in its role as the budget video card and the older GeForce 4 Ti cards filled in the mid-range.

In April 2003, the company introduced the GeForce FX 5600 and the GeForce FX 5200 to address the other market segments. Each had an &quot;Ultra&quot; variant and a slower, budget-oriented variant and all used conventional single-slot cooling solutions. The 5600 Ultra had respectable performance overall but it was slower than the Radeon 9600 Pro and sometimes slower than the GeForce 4 Ti series. The FX 5200 did not perform as well as the DirectX 7.0 generation GeForce 4 MX440 or Radeon 9000 Pro in some benchmarks.

In May 2003, Nvidia launched the GeForce FX 5900 Ultra, a new high-end product to replace the low-volume and disappointing FX 5800. Based upon a revised GPU called NV35, which fixed some of the DirectX 9 shortcomings of the discontinued NV30, this product was more competitive with the Radeon 9700 and 9800. In addition to redesigning parts of the GPU, the company moved to a 256-bit memory data bus, allowing for significantly higher memory bandwidth than the 5800 even when utilizing more common DDR SDRAM instead of DDR2. The 5900 Ultra performed somewhat better than the Radeon 9800 Pro in games not heavily using shader model 2, and had a quieter cooling system than the 5800.

In October 2003, Nvidia released the GeForce FX 5700 and GeForce FX 5950. The 5700 was a mid-range card using the NV36 GPU with technology from NV35 while the 5950 was a high-end card again using the NV35 GPU but with additional clock speed. The 5950 also featured a redesigned version of the 5800&#x27;s FlowFX cooler, this time using a larger, slower fan and running much quieter as a result. The 5700 provided strong competition for the Radeon 9600 XT in games limited to light use of shader model 2. The 5950 was competitive with the Radeon 9800 XT, again as long as pixel shaders were lightly used.

In December 2003, the company launched the GeForce FX 5900XT, a graphics card intended for the mid-range segment. It was similar to the 5900 Ultra, but clocked slower and used slower memory. It more thoroughly competed with Radeon 9600 XT, but was still behind in a few shader-intense scenarios.

The GeForce FX line moved to PCI Express in early 2004 with a number of models, including the PCX 5300, PCX 5750, PCX 5900, and PCX 5950. These cards were largely the same as their AGP predecessors with similar model numbers. To operate on the PCIe bus, an AGP-to-PCIe &quot;HSI bridge&quot; chip on the video card converted the PCIe signals into AGP signals for the GPU.

Also in 2004, the GeForce FX 5200 / 5300 series that utilized the NV34 GPU received a new member with the FX 5500.

<text>The Oireachtas ( , ), sometimes referred to as Oireachtas Éireann, is the bicameral parliament of Ireland. The Oireachtas consists of the president of Ireland and the two houses of the Oireachtas (): a house of representatives called Dáil Éireann and a senate called Seanad Éireann.

The houses of the Oireachtas sit in Leinster House in Dublin, an eighteenth-century ducal palace. The directly elected Dáil is the more powerful of the houses of the Oireachtas.

==Etymology==
The word comes from the Irish word / (&quot;deliberative assembly of freemen; assembled freemen; assembly, gathering; patrimony, territory&quot;), ultimately from the word (&quot;freeman&quot;). Its first recorded use as the name of a legislative body was within the Irish Free State.

==Composition==
Dáil Éireann is directly elected under universal suffrage of all Irish citizens who are residents and at least eighteen years old; non-Irish citizens may be enfranchised by law, which currently extends to British citizens. By law, a Dáil term may last no longer than five years; however, the house can be dissolved by the president at any time at the request of the Taoiseach (head of government). Dáil elections use the electoral system of proportional representation by means of a single transferable vote. The Dáil has 174 members.

The Seanad is not directly elected but consists of a mixture of members selected in a number of different ways. There are 60 senators: 43 are elected by councillors and parliamentarians, 11 are appointed by the Taoiseach, and six are elected by two university constituencies.

The president is directly elected once every seven years, and may serve a maximum of two terms; where there is only one candidate for president, no ballot will be taken, and the candidate will be deemed elected at the close of nominations.

==Role==
To become law, a bill must first be approved by both the Dáil and in most circumstances the Seanad (although the Dáil can override a Seanad refusal to pass a bill), and then signed into law by the president. Bills to amend the Constitution must also be approved by the people in a referendum prior to being presented to the President. In most circumstances, the president is in effect obliged to sign all laws approved by the Houses of the Oireachtas, although the president has the power to refer most bills to the Supreme Court for a ruling on constitutionality. The powers of the Seanad are in effect limited to delay rather than veto. It is the Dáil, therefore, that is the supreme tier of the Irish legislature. The general enacting formula for Acts of the Oireachtas is: &quot;Be it enacted by the Oireachtas as follows:—&quot;, for an act with a preamble this enacting formula is, instead, &quot;Be it therefore enacted by the Oireachtas as follows:—&quot;.

===Powers===
The Oireachtas has exclusive power to:

* Legislate, including a power vested in the Dáil of approving the financial resolutions relevant to the budget. However, the courts have allowed the Oireachtas to delegate limited legislative powers to other entities, such as Government Ministers.
* Create subordinate legislatures.
* Propose changes to the constitution (must be initiated in the Dáil), which must then be submitted to a referendum.
* Raise military or armed forces.
* Allow international agreements to become part of the domestic law of the state.
* Pass certain laws having an extraterritorial effect (in accordance with the similar practices of other states).
* Enact, when it considers a state of emergency to exist, almost any law it deems necessary, with the imposition of capital punishment being the only absolutely excluded act in all circumstances.

===Limitations===
* Laws are invalid if, and to the extent that, they contradict the constitution.
* In the event of a conflict, EU law also takes precedence over acts of the Oireachtas, as is common throughout the European Union.
* It may not retrospectively criminalise acts that were not illegal at the time they were committed.
* It may not enact any law providing for the imposition of the death penalty, even during a state of emergency.

==Committees==

The Oireachtas has a number of joint committees that include members of both houses. There are currently fifteen of these:
*Joint Committee on Agriculture and the Marine 
*Joint Committee on Children, Disability, Equality and Integration
*Joint Committee on Climate Action
*Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science
*Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment
*Joint Committee on European Union Affairs
*Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach
*Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence
*Joint Committee on Health
*Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage
*Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement
*Joint Committee on Justice
*Joint Committee on Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht
*Joint Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands
*Joint Committee on Transport and Communications Networks
*Working Group of Committee Chairmen

==Predecessors==
&quot;Oireachtas&quot; has been the title of two parliaments in Irish history: the current Oireachtas of Ireland, since 1937, and, immediately before that, the Oireachtas of the Irish Free State of 1922 to 1937.

The earliest parliament in Ireland was the Parliament of Ireland, which was founded in the thirteenth century as the supreme legislative body of the lordship of Ireland and was in existence until 1801. This parliament governed the English-dominated part of Ireland, which at first was limited to Dublin and surrounding cities, but later grew to include the entire island. The Irish Parliament was, from the passage of Poynings&#x27; Law in 1494 until its repeal in 1782, subordinate to the English, and later British, Parliament. This Parliament consisted of the King of Ireland, who was the same person as the King of England, a House of Lords and a House of Commons. After the Constitution of 1782 was passed by both the Irish Parliament and the Parliament of Great Britain, the Irish Parliament had increased legislative and judicial independence from the Kingdom of Great Britain and had greater control over the Royal Irish Army. It was known as Grattan&#x27;s Parliament after Henry Grattan, leader of the Irish Patriot Party. In 1800 the Irish Parliament approved its own abolition when it enacted the Act of Union, which came into effect from 1 January 1801.

The next legislature to exist in Ireland came into being in 1919. This was a unicameral parliament established by Irish republicans, known simply as Dáil Éireann. This revolutionary Dáil was notionally a legislature for the whole island of Ireland. In 1920, in parallel to the Dáil, the British government created a home rule legislature called the Parliament of Southern Ireland. However, this parliament was boycotted by most Irish politicians. It was made up of the King, the House of Commons of Southern Ireland and the Senate of Southern Ireland. The Parliament of Southern Ireland was formally abolished in 1922, with the establishment of the Oireachtas under the Constitution of the Irish Free State.

The Oireachtas of the Irish Free State consisted of the King (represented by a Governor-General) and two houses: Dáil Éireann (described as a &quot;Chamber of Deputies&quot;) and Seanad Éireann. However, the Free State Senate was abolished in May 1936 and the role of the monarch was removed in December 1936. The modern Oireachtas came into being in December 1937, on the adoption of the Constitution of Ireland.

==Broadcasting==
The first Oireachtas radio and television broadcasts were of ceremonial addresses from dignitaries, beginning with that of John F. Kennedy during his 1963 state visit. Regular radio broadcasting of edited Oireachtas proceedings began in October 1986, although budget statements had already been broadcast live. Television coverage of Dáil, Seanad, and committee proceedings began in 1990, 1991, and 1993 respectively. Since 2005 the proceedings of both houses have been made available over the internet by HEAnet and the eDemocracy Unit of the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas.

Houses of the Oireachtas Channel (publicly known as Oireachtas TV) is a digital television channel in Ireland. It broadcasts Committee and Houses and other parliament proceedings following its establishment under the Broadcasting Act 2009. On 15 November 2011, it began broadcasting a pilot service on UPC Ireland. On 22 September 2014, the Houses launched the dedicated television channel Oireachtas TV, bringing unfiltered access to the parliamentary process to over one million households nationwide. The service is available free of charge on UPC Channel 207 and Sky Channel 574.

In 2012, the Oireachtas launched its first e-consultation.

==Houses of the Oireachtas family day==
On 28 June 2008, the first Houses of the Oireachtas family day was held. This initiative by the Ceann Comhairle of Dáil Éireann, John O&#x27;Donoghue and the Cathaoirleach of Seanad Éireann, Pat Moylan aimed to increase public awareness in the work of the Houses of the Oireachtas. It included tours of both chambers of the Oireachtas, lectures on the history of Oireachtas, historic political speeches recited by actors and a hot air balloon – commemorating the balloon flight which took place in 1785 from Leinster Lawn. The Oireachtas family day took place again in 2009, but it has not been held since then.

==Northern Ireland representation==
Although, as adopted in 1937, Article 3 of the constitution asserted the &quot;right of the parliament and government established by this constitution to exercise jurisdiction&quot; over the whole of Ireland, it also provided that pending the &quot;re-integration of the national territory&quot; Acts of the Oireachtas would not apply to Northern Ireland. Therefore, no serious attempts have been made for the representation of Northern Ireland in the Dáil. As Taoiseach, Éamon de Valera, while a staunch opponent of partition, and who had been elected to represent a Northern constituency in the First Dáil, did not pursue the idea of seats in the Dáil for Northern Ireland, on the grounds that this would amount to representation &quot;without taxation or responsibility&quot;. Beginning with Seamus Mallon in 1982, one or more from Northern Ireland have been included among the eleven Senators nominated by the Taoiseach after most elections.

Sinn Féin has advocated that Northern Ireland MLAs, MPs, and MEPs should have the right to participate in Dáil debates, if not vote. In 2005 the Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, proposed that Northern Ireland MPs should be able to address a committee of the whole Dáil. However, Fine Gael, the Labour Party, and Ahern&#x27;s coalition partners, the Progressive Democrats, all opposed the idea, as did the Green Party, the Socialist Party and some Oireachtas members from Fianna Fáil. Only Sinn Féin, the party that stood to gain most from the proposal, supported it, while the more moderate Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) described it as a step forward. The proposal was also criticised widely in the media, with an editorial in &quot;The Irish Times&quot;, declaring that: &quot;The overwhelming democratic imperative is that the institutions of this State should represent and serve the people of the State.&quot; From 2011, Northern Ireland MEPs had the same automatic right as MEPs from the Republic to participate in meetings of the Seanad&#x27;s European committee, whereas other MEPs require an invitation. This ended in 2020 when the United Kingdom left the EU, which consequently meant all UK MEPs left office.

==Houses of the Oireachtas Commission==
While each house is empowered to organise its own business, they have always co-operated in practical matters arising from the fact that they share Leinster House as a common building complex. The Houses of the Oireachtas Commission was established by statute in 2003 to provide a formal structure for this, which was previously done by a joint committee. Non-political support staff, such as ushers and the English–Irish translation staff, are employed by this Commission and treated as part of the Civil Service of the State. The Commission&#x27;s chairperson and chief executive are the Ceann Comhairle and clerk of the Dáil respectively; other members are the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, one appointed by the Minister for Finance, four by the Dáil, and three by the Seanad. The Commission, through the translation department, is responsible for periodic updates to , the official standard form of the Irish language.

<text>Canada East () was the northeastern portion of the Province of Canada. Lord Durham&#x27;s Report investigating the causes of the Upper and Lower Canada Rebellions recommended merging those two colonies. The new colony, known as the Province of Canada, was created by the Act of Union 1840 passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom, having effect in 1841. For administrative purposes, the new Province was subdivided into Canada West and Canada East. The former name of &quot;Lower Canada&quot; came back into official use in 1849, and as of Canadian Confederation of 1867 it formed the newly created province of Quebec.

An estimated 890,000 people lived in Canada East in 1851.

==Geography==
It consisted of the southern portion of the modern-day Canadian province of Quebec. It was a former British colony called the Province of Lower Canada. Based on Lord Durham&#x27;s report it was merged with the Province of Upper Canada (present-day southern portion of the Province of Ontario) to create the Province of Canada.

==Language==
Canada East was primarily a French-speaking region.

Due to heavy immigration following the American Revolutionary War, the population of English-speaking residents of Canada West soon outstripped Canada East. Under the Act of Union 1840 the seats in the lower legislature were evenly divided between East and West. There was no provision under the Act for representation by population.

== Politics ==

The Province of Canada, formed in 1840, was governed by the Parliament of the Province of Canada, elected in a mixture of multi-member districts and single-member districts, using block voting and first past the post respectively.

== Name ==

From 1841 to 1843, the terms Canada East and Canada West were used. The former names of the two colonies, &quot;Lower Canada&quot; and &quot;Upper Canada&quot;, had no constitutional status.

From April 25, 1849, the Canadian Parliament enacted an interpretation act, which once again gave legal meaning to the terms &quot;Lower Canada&quot; and &quot;Upper Canada&quot;:

== 1866 Fenian raids ==
Fenian raids along the Canada–United States border south and east of Montreal were successfully repulsed, by both local militia and British regulars. The Fenians hoped to stir up a rebellion, and the British government did not want a repeat of the rebellion of 1837 and 1838, for fear of losing more colonies to the United States and the material damage and loss of life such would entail.

== Economy ==
The most important farm products were potatoes, rye, buckwheat, maple sugar and livestock. When it came time to confederate, the Francophones were nervous because they did not want to lose their French heritage. They were afraid that it would be overwhelmed by the English.

At the time of Confederation (1867), Montreal was the largest city of the British North American colonies, with a population of 107,225. Some of the richest people in Canada lived in Montreal.

By the late 1850s all the land of Canada West had been bought. The next frontier was west of Lake Superior. However, this land was owned by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. Most in Canada East resisted the takeover of this land, as it would have changed the balance of the seats in the legislature.

The St. Lawrence River was full of ice for half the year. For that half of the year, goods had to be transported on American railways. People supported construction of a railway through Canada East to Halifax to provide an all-British route for trade and defence.

By the 1860s, the Grand Trunk Railway was about $72 million in debt. Its annual income was about $200. Partly because of this, the Province of Canada pulled out of the negotiations for the Intercolonial Railway.

Only 20% of Canada East&#x27;s residents lived in cities. The rest were farmers, &quot;habitants&quot; as they called themselves. They built their own stone houses and wooden furniture. Their clothes were homemade and their food was grown on the farms.

Lumber was the most important natural resource of Canada East. In the woods, hundreds of workers cut down trees, then floated the logs down the St. Lawrence River during the spring floods. Sawmills turned the logs into planks and boards to sell to markets in the United States. Factories in the District of Canada East made windows, shingles, washboards, and door frames.

<doc id="148753" wikidata="Q1025056" url="?curid=148753" title="Cacti (software)">
<text>Cacti is an open-source, web-based network monitoring, performance, fault and configuration management framework designed as a front-end application for the open-source, industry-standard data logging tool RRDtool. Cacti allows a user to poll services at predetermined intervals and graph the resulting data. Through the use of Cacti plugins, it has been extended to encompass all of the FCAPS operational management categories. It is generally used to graph time-series data of metrics such as CPU load and network bandwidth utilization. A common usage is to monitor network traffic by polling a network switch or router interface via Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).

The Cacti end user front end supports both User and User Groups security models and supports Role Based Access Control (RBAC) for access to not only monitoring data, but various areas of the user interface. Source users can either be locally defined or sourced from LDAP, Active Directory and other protocols via Apache and Nginx Basic Authentication which includes Single Signon providers (SSO).

The Cacti framework can be extended using Plugins which transform Cacti from a pure Time Series Graphing solution into a robust Performance Monitoring, Fault and Configuration Management platform. The Cacti Group maintains over 20 such Plugins on GitHub that deliver these capabilities.

Cacti is primarily used by Telco providers and Network Operation Centers throughout the world in addition to being the heart of the commercial Spectrum LSF RTM solution which monitors High Performance Computing (HPC) clusters based on IBM LSF product. Additional use cases include web hosting providers (especially dedicated server, virtual private server, and colocation providers) to display bandwidth statistics for their customers. It can be used to configure the data collection itself, allowing certain setups to be monitored without any manual configuration of RRDtool. Cacti data collection can be extended to monitor any source via shell scripts and executables.

Cacti provides both a built-in and optional data collectors. back ends: The first, referenced to as &quot;cmd.php&quot;, is a PHP script suitable for smaller installations. The second, referred to as &quot;spine&quot;, is a multi-threaded and massively parallel C-based data collector which can scale to tens of thousands of hosts per Cacti Data Collector.(cacti español).

==History==
The Cacti project was first started by Ian Berry on September 2, 2001. Berry was inspired to start the project while working for a small ISP while also still in high school, learning PHP and MySQL. His central aim in creating Cacti &quot;was to offer more ease of use than RRDtool and more flexibility than MRTG&quot;.

On September 13, 2004, version 0.8.6 was released, and with it came more developers and, later on, greater program speed and scalability.

Version 0.8.7 was released for use in October 2007. In June 2012, a roadmap on the website indicated that version 1.0.0 was scheduled for release in the first quarter of 2013, but due to team member availability and changing roles in their careers, Cacti development took a hiatus with only minor security and bug fixes until the release of Cacti 1.0 in January of 2017.

Between the years of 2012 and 2017, The Cacti released 6 point releases of the Cacti 0.8.8 series software, again addressing minor bug fixes and security issues.

The Cacti Group reorganized in early 2015 to restart work on the Cacti 1.0 product. During this development, The Cacti Group stepped up to deliver on much of the promised capabilities on their roadmap including; Multiple Data Collectors; Improved Graph, Device, Template and Tree Security including User Group level permissions; Multiple Data Collection intervals; Site support; and Improved Tree Management and Performant capabilities.

Version 1.0.0 was released in January 2017.

Version 1.2.0 was released in January 2019.

2017 was an active year for The Cacti Group. They have released over 30 versions of Cacti since the initial 1.0.0 release in January 2017. The GitHub community additionally grew and there are now several dozen developers working on perfecting the 1.x release for use in homes, small companies and enterprises throughout the globe.

==Features==
The primary features of Cacti include:
* Support for unlimited monitored devices
* Multiple levels of Device and Graph organization via Site and Location attributes and Tree structures to organize Graphs, Devices and Sites
* Distributed Data Collection using Remote Data Collectors which are resilient to intermittent network failures
* Extendable via the Plugin Architecture

<doc id="148758" wikidata="Q109923829" url="?curid=148758" title="Dinosaurus">
<text>Dinosaurus is an extinct genus of therapsid of controversial affinities. Its type and only species is Dinosaurus murchisonii. It is only known from a partial snout from the Permian of Russia. Its taxonomic history is intertwined with several other poorly-known Russian therapsids, particularly &quot;Rhopalodon&quot;, &quot;Brithopus&quot;, and &quot;Phthinosuchus&quot;.

&quot;Dinosaurus&quot; is not a dinosaur; the similarity in names is coincidental. Dinosaurs belong to the clade Dinosauria, a clade of reptiles, whereas &quot;Dinosaurus&quot; is a therapsid, and as such, more closely related to mammals. Dinosauria was named only five years prior to &quot;Dinosaurus&quot;, in 1842. &quot;Dinosaurus&quot; also lived in the Permian period, which is part of the Paleozoic era, before dinosaurs existed, the first dinosaurs appeared in the following Triassic period of the Mesozoic era.

==History of study==

The holotype of &quot;Dinosaurus murchisonii&quot; was collected in a copper mine in the Orenburg Governorate of the Russian Empire during the 1840s. It was collected in two pieces, found on separate occasions. The director of the mine, Wagenheim von Qualen, initially identified the first piece as a plant fossil in a letter to Johann Fischer von Waldheim, but Fischer realized it was part of a skull and described it as a new species of &quot;Rhopalodon&quot;, &quot;R. murchisonii&quot;, in 1845. In 1847, Fischer described the second piece and established a new genus, &quot;Dinosaurus&quot;, for the species. In 1848, Eichwald recognized that the two specimens were not only from the same species, but fit together as parts of the same individual. He provisionally returned the species to &quot;Rhopalodon&quot;, as he felt there were not enough differences yet identified to justify a second genus, and noted the existence of the similarly-named taxon Dinosauria, named by Richard Owen only a few years prior, in 1842.

Wagenheim von Qualen donated both specimens to the collection of Maximilian de Beuharnais, Duke of Leuchtenberg, and the originals have since been lost. However, casts of the specimens are housed in the Paleontological Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences under the catalog numbers PIN 296/1 and PIN 296/2.

In 1894, H. G. Seeley remarked that &quot;Cliorhizodon&quot;, which is now regarded as a junior synonym of &quot;Syodon&quot;, could not be distinguished from &quot;Dinosaurus&quot;. In 1954, Ivan Efremov synonymized &quot;Dinosaurus&quot; with &quot;Brithopus&quot;. This has been followed by some other authors, but Christian Kammerer has regarded &quot;Brithopus&quot;, which is based on only a partial humerus, as a &quot;nomen dubium&quot;, and as such did not regard &quot;Dinosaurus&quot; as synonymous with it.

In 2000, M. F. Ivakhnenko synonymized &quot;Phthinosuchus&quot; with &quot;Dinosaurus&quot;. As such, he classified &quot;Dinosaurus&quot; in the family Phthinosuchidae, which he grouped with Rubidgeidae in the superfamily Rubidgeoidea of the order Gorgonopia. Kammerer has remarked that the limited anatomical information available for &quot;Dinosaurus&quot; makes it hard to confirm this proposed synonymy.

<text>Leif Erickson (born William Wycliffe Anderson; October 27, 1911 – January 29, 1986) was an American stage, film, and television actor.

==Early life==
Erickson was born in Alameda, California, near San Francisco. He worked as a soloist in a band as vocalist and trombone player, performed in Max Reinhardt&#x27;s productions, and then gained a small amount of stage experience in a comedy vaudeville act.

==Military service==
Erickson enlisted in the U.S. Navy during World War II. Rising to the rank of Chief Petty Officer in the Naval Aviation Photographic Unit, he served as a military photographer, shooting film in combat zones, and as an instructor. He was shot down twice in the Pacific, and received two Purple Hearts. Erickson was in the unit that filmed and photographed the Japanese surrender aboard the in Tokyo Bay on September 2, 1945.

==Acting career==

Erickson&#x27;s first films were two 1933 band films with Betty Grable before starting a string of Buster Crabbe Western films based on Zane Grey novels. He went on to appear in films such as &quot;The Snake Pit&quot;; &quot; Sorry, Wrong Number&quot;; &quot;Abbott and Costello Meet Captain Kidd&quot;; &quot;Invaders from Mars&quot;; &quot;On the Waterfront&quot;; &quot;A Gathering of Eagles&quot;; &quot;Roustabout&quot;; &quot;The Carpetbaggers&quot;; and &quot;Mirage&quot;.

Among Erickson&#x27;s more notable roles were as Deborah Kerr&#x27;s macho husband in the stage and film versions of &quot;Tea and Sympathy&quot; and as Greta Garbo&#x27;s brother in &quot;Conquest&quot; (1937). He also played the role of Pete, the vindictive boat engineer, in the 1951 remake of the famed musical &quot;Show Boat&quot;. His final appearance in a feature film was in &quot;Twilight&#x27;s Last Gleaming&quot; (1977).
Erickson appeared frequently on television; he was cast as Dr. Hillyer in &quot;Consider Her Ways&quot; (1964) and as Paul White in &quot;The Monkey&#x27;s Paw—A Retelling&quot; (1965) on CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Alfred Hitchcock Hour&quot;. He is probably best known, however, for &quot;The High Chaparral&quot;, which aired on NBC from 1967 until 1971. He portrayed a rancher, Big John Cannon, determined to establish a cattle empire in the Arizona Territory while keeping peace with the Apache. Erickson guest-starred in several television series, including &quot;Colgate Theatre&quot;, &quot;Rawhide&quot;; &quot;Bonanza&quot; (two episodes, 1961–1965); as Aaron Burr in &quot;Daniel Boone&quot; (two episodes, 1964–1970); &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;; &quot;Marcus Welby, M.D.&quot;; &quot;Medical Center&quot;; &quot;Longstreet&quot;; &quot;Cannon&quot;; &quot;The Rifleman&quot;; &quot;The Rockford Files&quot;; &quot;The Rookies&quot;; &quot;Night Gallery&quot;; and the 1977 series &quot;Hunter&quot;. His final role was in an episode of &quot;Fantasy Island&quot; in 1984.

==Death==
Erickson died of cancer in Pensacola, Florida, on January 29, 1986, aged 74.

<doc id="148780" wikidata="Q5320066" url="?curid=148780" title="Dáil Constitution">
<text>The Constitution of Dáil Éireann (), more commonly known as the Dáil Constitution, was the constitution of the 1919–22 Irish Republic. It was adopted by the First Dáil at its first meeting on 21 January 1919 and remained in operation until 6 December 1922. As adopted it consisted of five articles. Article 1 declared that the Dáil had &quot;full powers to legislate&quot; and would consist of representatives elected in elections conducted by the British government. For the exercise of executive power it created a cabinet, answerable to the Dáil, called the Ministry (), headed by a prime minister called the &quot;Príomh Aire&quot; (in practice also known as the President of Dáil Éireann). The constitution was limited to an outline of the functions of the legislature and the executive; the Dáil later established a system of Dáil Courts, but there was no provision in the constitution on a judiciary. The final article of the constitution declared that it was intended to be a provisional document, in the sense that it was subject to amendment. As adopted the constitution came to only around 370 words. In comparison, the modern Constitution of Ireland has approximately 16,000 words. Overall, the structure of the document was as follows:

*Article 1: Dáil Éireann
*Article 2: Ministry of Dáil Éireann
*Article 3: Chairman of the Dáil
*Article 4: Finance
*Article 5: Amendments

==Amendments==
*1 April 1919: Five amendments were made to the constitution on this day:
**Allowed for the nomination of the members of the Ministry at the same meeting as the election of the President.
**Allowed for the nomination in writing by the President of a President-Substitute in periods of temporary absences.
**Allowed for the appointment of a Minister-Substitute in periods of temporary absences.
**Increased the maximum number of ministers from four to &quot;a President of the Ministry elected by Dáil Eireann, and not more than nine Executive Officers&quot;.
**provided that twice yearly auditing of accounts would not begin until November 1919.
*25 August 1921: The style of the head of the ministry was amended to &quot;the President who shall also be Prime Minister&quot;, and reduced the cabinet to six members. The amendment also made further changes to the dates mentioned in Article 4. This made more explicit the idea that the head of the ministry was both head of state and head of government.

Following the change to the Constitution in 1921, Éamon de Valera was proposed and elected as President of the Irish Republic, rather than President of Dáil Éireann.

==Operation after the Treaty==
After the ratification of the Anglo-Irish Treaty by the Dáil on 7 January 1922, de Valera left office in 1922. Those elected to the position of president were styled again as President of Dáil Éireann: Arthur Griffith on 10 January 1922 and W. T. Cosgrave on 9 September 1922.

In order to implement the Treaty the Parliament of the United Kingdom adopted the Irish Free State (Agreement) Act 1922. This provided for an executive, called the Provisional Government, and a &quot;house of parliament&quot; to which it would be accountable. The institutions established by the Dáil Constitution operated in parallel with these structures recognised by the British government. However, in practice the two systems of government were eventually merged. When the &quot;house of parliament&quot; was convened in 1922 on 9 September it was treated by those in attendance as the Third Dáil, and those appointed as president and Ministry of Dáil Éireann were the same cabinet serving as the Provisional Government.

The Dáil Constitution finally became defunct when the new Constitution of the Irish Free State came into force on 6 December 1922.

==Commentary==
The constitution&#x27;s close modelling of its institutional system on the Westminster system of government, specifically with the inclusion of a parliament from whom a ministry was both chosen and to whom it was answerable, has been noted by Irish political scientists and historians, notably Professor Brian Farrell, who suggested that the leaders of the new state stuck to a system that, through Irish participation in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, the new Irish political elite had close experience of, and identification with, notwithstanding their radical republican rhetoric.

<doc id="148783" wikidata="Q151321" url="?curid=148783" title="Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor">
<text>Leopold II (Peter Leopold Josef Anton Joachim Pius Gotthard; 5 May 1747 – 1 March 1792) was the penultimate Holy Roman Emperor, as well as King of Hungary, Croatia and Bohemia, and Archduke of Austria from 1790 to 1792, and Grand Duke of Tuscany from 1765 to 1790. He was a son of Empress Maria Theresa and Emperor Francis I, and the brother of Queen Marie Antoinette of France, Queen Maria Carolina, Duchess Maria Amalia of Parma, and Emperor Joseph II. Leopold was a moderate proponent of enlightened absolutism like his brother Joseph II. He granted the Academy of Georgofili his protection. Unusually for his time, he opposed the death penalty and torture and abolished it in Tuscany on 30 November 1786 during his rule there, making it the first nation in modern history to do so. This act has been commemorated since 2000 by a regional custom known as the Feast of Tuscany, held every 30 November. Despite his brief reign, he is highly regarded. The historian Paul W. Schroeder called him &quot;one of the most shrewd and sensible monarchs ever to wear a crown&quot;.

==Youth==

Leopold was born in Vienna as his parents&#x27; third son. Initially selected for a clerical career, he received an education with a focus on theology. In 1753, he was engaged to Maria Beatrice d&#x27;Este, heiress to the Duchy of Modena. 

The marriage was never consummated and Maria Beatrice instead married Leopold&#x27;s brother, Archduke Ferdinand.

Upon the early death of his older brother Archduke Charles in 1761, the family decided that Leopold was going to succeed his father as Grand Duke of Tuscany. Tuscany had been envisioned and designated as a secundogeniture, a territory and title bestowed upon the second born son, which was greater than an appanage. On 5 August 1765, Leopold married Maria Luisa, daughter of King Charles III of Spain and Maria Amalia of Saxony; however, they were already married by proxy on 16 February 1764 in Madrid, more than a year before their in-person marriage. Upon the death of his father, Francis I, on 18 August 1765, he became Grand Duke of Tuscany.

==Grand Duke of Tuscany==
For five years, Leopold exercised little more than nominal authority, under the supervision of counselors appointed by his mother. In 1770, he made a journey to Vienna to secure the removal of this vexatious guardianship and returned to Florence with a free hand. During the twenty years that elapsed between his return to Florence and the death of his eldest brother Joseph II in 1790, he was employed in reforming the administration of his small state. The reformation was carried out by the removal of the ruinous restrictions on industry and personal freedom imposed by his predecessors of the House of Medici and left untouched during his father&#x27;s life, by the introduction of a rational system of taxation (reducing the rates of taxation), and by the execution of profitable public works, such as the drainage of the Valdichiana.

As Leopold had no army to maintain, and as he suppressed the small naval force kept up by the Medici, the whole of his revenue was left free for the improvement of his state. Leopold was never popular with his Italian subjects. His disposition was cold and retiring. His habits were simple to the verge of sordidness, though he could display splendour on occasion, and he could not help offending those of his subjects who had profited by the abuses of the Medicean régime.

But his steady, consistent, and intelligent administration, which advanced step by step, brought the grand duchy to a high level of material prosperity. His ecclesiastical policy, which disturbed the deeply rooted convictions of his people and brought him into collision with the Pope, was not successful. He was unable to secularize the property of the religious houses or to put the clergy entirely under the control of the lay power. However, his abolition of capital punishment was the first permanent abolition in modern times. On 30 November 1786, after having &quot;de facto&quot; blocked capital executions (the last was in 1769), Leopold promulgated the reform of the penal code that abolished the death penalty and ordered the destruction of all the instruments for capital execution in his land. Torture was also banned.

In line with the theories of the Age of Enlightenment, he enlarged La Specola with medical waxworks and other exhibits, aiming to educate Florentines in the empirical observation of natural laws.

Leopold also approved and collaborated on the development of a political constitution, said to have anticipated by many years the promulgation of the French constitution and which presented some similarities with the Virginia Bill of Rights of 1778. Leopold&#x27;s concept of this was based on respect for the political rights of citizens and on a harmony of power between the executive and the legislative. However, it could not be put into effect because Leopold moved to Vienna to become emperor in 1790, and because it was so radically new that it garnered opposition even from those who might have benefited from it.

Leopold developed and supported many social and economic reforms. Smallpox inoculation was made systematically available, and an early institution for the rehabilitation of juvenile delinquents was founded. Leopold also introduced radical reforms to the system of neglect and inhumane treatment of those deemed mentally ill. On 23 January 1774, the &quot;legge sui pazzi&quot; (law on the insane) was established, the first of its kind to be introduced in Europe, allowing steps to be taken to hospitalize individuals deemed insane. A few years later Leopold undertook the project of building a new hospital, the . He used his skill at choosing collaborators to put a young physician, Vincenzo Chiarugi, at its head. Chiarugi and his collaborators introduced new humanitarian regulations in the running of the hospital and caring for the mentally ill patients, including banning the use of chains and physical punishment, and in so doing have been recognized as early pioneers of what later came to be known as the moral treatment movement.

During the last few years of his rule in Tuscany, Leopold had begun to be frightened by the increasing disorders in the German and Hungarian dominions of his family, which were the direct result of his brother&#x27;s strict methods. He and Joseph II were tenderly attached to one another and met frequently both before and after the death of their mother. The portrait by Pompeo Batoni in which they appear together shows that they bore a strong personal resemblance to one another. But it may be said of Leopold, as of Fontenelle, that his heart was made of brains. He knew that he had to succeed his childless eldest brother in Austria, and he was unwilling to inherit his unpopularity. When, therefore, in 1789 Joseph, who knew himself to be dying, asked him to come to Vienna and become co-regent, Leopold evaded the request.

He was still in Florence when Joseph II died at Vienna on 20 February 1790, and he did not leave his Italian capital until 3 March 1790. Following the principle of secundogeniture which had allowed him to rule Tuscany, Leopold entrusted the grand duchy to his younger son Ferdinand III, who ruled until the French invasion in 1797 and then again from 1814 to 1824.

==Holy Roman Emperor==

Leopold, during his government in Tuscany, had shown a speculative tendency to grant his subjects a constitution. When he succeeded to the Austrian lands, he began by making large concessions to the interests offended by his brother&#x27;s innovations. He recognized the Estates of his different dominions as &quot;the pillars of the monarchy&quot;, pacified the Hungarians and Bohemians, and divided the insurgents in the Austrian Netherlands (now Belgium) by means of concessions. When these failed to restore order, he marched troops into the country and re-established his own authority, and at the same time the historic franchises of the Flemings. Yet he did not surrender any part that could be retained of what Maria Theresa and Joseph had done to strengthen the hands of the state. He continued, for instance, to insist that no papal bull could be published in his dominions without his consent (&quot;placetum regium&quot;). One of the harshest actions Leopold took to placate the noble communities of the various Habsburg domains was to issue a decree on 9 May 1790 that forced thousands of Bohemian serfs freed by his brother Joseph back into servitude.

Leopold lived for barely two years after his accession as Holy Roman Emperor, and during that period he was hard pressed by peril from west and east alike. The growing revolutionary disorders in France endangered the life of his sister Marie Antoinette, the queen of Louis XVI, and also threatened his own dominions with the spread of subversive agitation. His sister sent him passionate appeals for help, and he was pestered by the royalist émigrés, who were intriguing to bring about armed intervention in France.

From the east he was threatened by the aggressive ambition of Catherine II of Russia and by the unscrupulous policy of Prussia. Catherine would have been delighted to see Austria and Prussia embark on a crusade in the cause of kings against the French Revolution. While they were busy beyond the Rhine, she would have annexed what remained of Poland and made conquests against the Ottoman Empire. Leopold II had no difficulty in seeing through the rather transparent cunning of the Russian empress, and he refused to be misled.

To his sister, he gave good advice and promises of help if she and her husband could escape from Paris. The émigrés who followed him pertinaciously were refused audience, or when they forced themselves on him, were peremptorily denied all help. Leopold was too purely a politician not to be secretly pleased at the destruction of the power of France and of her influence in Europe by her internal disorders. Within six weeks of his accession, he displayed his contempt for France&#x27;s weakness by practically tearing up the treaty of alliance made by Maria Theresa in 1756 and opening negotiations with Great Britain to impose a check on Russia and Prussia.

Leopold put pressure on Great Britain by threatening to cede his part of the Low Countries to France. Then, when sure of British support, he was in a position to baffle the intrigues of Prussia. A personal appeal to Frederick William II led to a conference between them at Reichenbach in July 1790, and to an arrangement which was in fact a defeat for Prussia: Leopold&#x27;s coronation as King of Hungary on 11 November 1790, preceded by a settlement with the Diet in which he recognized the dominant position of the Magyars. He had already made an eight months&#x27; truce with the Turks in September, which prepared the way for the termination of the war begun by Joseph II. The pacification of his eastern dominions left Leopold free to re-establish order in Belgium and to confirm friendly relations with Britain and the Netherlands.

During 1791, the emperor remained increasingly preoccupied with the affairs of France. In January, he had to dismiss the Count of Artois (afterwards Charles X of France) in a very peremptory way. His good sense was revolted by the folly of the French émigrés, and he did his utmost to avoid being entangled in the affairs of that country. The insults inflicted on Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, however, at the time of their attempted flight to Varennes in June, stirred his indignation, and he made a general appeal in the Padua Circular to the sovereigns of Europe to take common measures in view of events which &quot;immediately compromised the honour of all sovereigns, and the security of all governments.&quot; Yet he was most directly interested in negotiations with Turkey, which in June led to a final peace, the Treaty of Sistova being signed in August 1791.

On 25 August 1791, he met the King of Prussia at Pillnitz Castle, near Dresden, and they drew up the Declaration of Pillnitz, stating their readiness to intervene in France if and when their assistance was called for by the other powers. The declaration was a mere formality, for, as Leopold knew, neither Russia nor Britain was prepared to act, and he endeavored to guard against the use which he foresaw the émigrés would try to make of it. In face of the reaction in France to the Declaration of Pillnitz, the intrigues of the émigrés, and attacks made by the French revolutionists on the rights of the German princes in Alsace, Leopold continued to hope that intervention might not be required. When Louis XVI swore to observe the constitution of September 1791, the emperor professed to think that a settlement had been reached in France. The attacks on the rights of the German princes on the left bank of the Rhine, and the increasing violence of the parties in Paris which were agitating to bring about war, soon showed, however, that this hope was vain. Leopold meant to meet the challenge of the revolutionists in France with dignity and temper; however, the effect of the Declaration of Pillnitz was to contribute to the radicalization of their political movement.

Like his parents before him, Leopold had sixteen children, the eldest of his eight sons being his successor, Emperor Francis II. Some of his other sons were prominent personages in their day. Among them were: Ferdinand III, Grand Duke of Tuscany; Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen, a celebrated soldier; Archduke Johann of Austria, also a soldier; Archduke Joseph, Palatine of Hungary; and Archduke Rainer, Viceroy of Lombardy-Venetia.

Leopold died suddenly from pneumonia in Vienna on 1 March 1792. He was buried in the Tuscan Crypt within the Imperial Crypt in Vienna.

==Patronage of the arts==
As a patron of the arts, Leopold II had an impact on the arts and culture of both Tuscany and Vienna. He was particularly passionate about Italian opera as practiced in the city of Florence. While the Grand Duke of Tuscany from 1765 to 1790, he was a major patron of the composer Tommaso Traetta and subsidized the costs of staging many new innovative operas by that composer; including the first staging in Florence of Traetta&#x27;s 1763 masterwork &quot;Ifigenia in Tauride&quot;. He also was a patron of the opera singers Giovanni Manzuoli, Giusto Fernando Tenducci, and Tommaso Guarducci.

Upon his succession to Holy Roman Emperor in 1790, Leopold II brought his passion for Florentine opera to the Vienna court, and brought with him many of the musicians and opera singers he enjoyed in Tuscany to Vienna. Many of the previously active singers, librettists, and composers at the Vienna court, such as librettist Lorenzo Da Ponte, were dismissed by Leopold II as he significantly changed the staffing of artists in the Vienna court. 

Before Leopold II opera buffa had been the center of the Vienna court, but after his succession and by Leopold&#x27;s direction opera seria and ballet became the central repertoire of both the Burgtheater and Kärntnertortheate. Following this shift, Mozart, who had previously written the opera buffas &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; (1786), &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; (1787), and &quot;Così fan tutte&quot; (1790) with Da Ponte, created the opera seria &quot;La clemenza di Tito&quot; which was commissioned by the Estates of Bohemia for the festivities that accompanied Leopold&#x27;s coronation as king of Bohemia in Prague on 6 September 1791. This shift toward opera seria and ballet continued in Vienna beyond Leopold II&#x27;s reign decades into the 19th century.


==Issue==
His mother Empress Maria Theresa was the last Habsburg, and he was one of 16 children. His brother Joseph II died without any surviving children, but Leopold in turn had 16 children, just like his mother, and became the founder of the main line of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine.

<text>Dana Elaine Owens (born March 18, 1970), known professionally by her stage name Queen Latifah, is an American rapper, singer, and actress. She has received various accolades, including a Grammy Award, a Primetime Emmy Award, a Golden Globe Award, three Screen Actors Guild Awards, and two NAACP Image Awards, in addition to a nomination for an Academy Award. In 2006, she became the first hip hop artist to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

At age 19, Latifah released her debut album &quot;All Hail the Queen&quot; (1989), featuring the hit single &quot;Ladies First&quot;. Her second album &quot;Nature of a Sista&#x27;&quot; (1991), was produced by Tommy Boy Records. Her third album, &quot;Black Reign&quot; (1993), became the first album by a solo female rapper to receive a gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and spawned the single &quot;U.N.I.T.Y.&quot;, which was influential in raising awareness of violence against women and the objectification of Black female sexuality. The track reached the top 40 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and won a Grammy Award. Her fourth album &quot;Order in the Court&quot; (1998), was released with Motown Records. She has since released the albums &quot;The Dana Owens Album&quot; (2004), &quot;Trav&#x27;lin&#x27; Light&quot; (2007), and &quot;Persona&quot; (2009).

Latifah starred as Khadijah James on the Fox sitcom &quot;Living Single&quot; from 1993 to 1998 and landed a leading role in the action film &quot;Set It Off&quot; (1996). She created the daytime talk show &quot;The Queen Latifah Show&quot;, which ran from 1999 to 2001, and again from 2013 to 2015, in syndication. Her portrayal of Matron &quot;Mama&quot; Morton in the musical film &quot;Chicago&quot; (2002) received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. She has also starred or co-starred in the films &quot;Bringing Down the House&quot; (2003), &quot;Taxi&quot; (2004), &quot;Barbershop 2: Back in Business&quot; (2005), &quot;Beauty Shop&quot; (2005), &quot;Last Holiday&quot; (2006), &quot;Hairspray&quot; (2007), &quot;Joyful Noise&quot; (2012), &quot;22 Jump Street&quot; (2014), and &quot;Girls Trip&quot; (2017); and provided voice work in the &quot;Ice Age&quot; film series.

Latifah received critical acclaim for her portrayal of blues singer Bessie Smith in the HBO film &quot;Bessie&quot; (2015), which she co-produced, winning the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Television Movie. From 2016 to 2019, she starred as Carlotta Brown in the musical drama series &quot;Star&quot;. In 2020, she portrayed Hattie McDaniel in the miniseries &quot;Hollywood&quot;. Since 2021, she has held the lead role on CBS&#x27;s revival of the action drama &quot;The Equalizer&quot;.

== Early life ==
Dana Elaine Owens was born in Newark, New Jersey, on March 18, 1970, and lived primarily in East Orange, New Jersey. She is the daughter of Rita Lamae (née Bray; d. 2018), a teacher at Irvington High School (Dana&#x27;s alma mater), and Lancelot Amos Owens, a police officer. Her parents divorced when she was ten.

She was raised in the Baptist faith. She attended Catholic school in Newark, New Jersey and Essex Catholic Girls&#x27; High School in Irvington but graduated from Irvington High School. After high school, she attended classes at Borough of Manhattan Community College.

She found her stage name, &quot;Latifah&quot; ( &quot;laṭīfa&quot;), meaning &quot;delicate&quot; and &quot;very kind&quot; in Arabic, in a book of Arabic names when she was eight. Always tall, the Dana was a power forward on her high school basketball team. She performed the number &quot;Home&quot; from the musical &quot;The Wiz&quot; in a grammar school play.

== Music career ==
=== 1988–1989: Career beginnings ===
She began beat boxing for the hip-hop group Ladies Fresh and was an original member of the Flavor Unit, which, at that time, was a crew of MCs grouped around producer DJ King Gemini. DJ King Gemini made a demo recording of Queen Latifah&#x27;s rap song Princess of the Posse, which he gave to Fab 5 Freddy, the host of &quot;Yo! MTV Raps&quot;. The song got the attention of Tommy Boy Music employee Dante Ross, who signed Latifah and in 1989 released her first single, &quot;Wrath of My Madness&quot;. More recent artists, like Ice Cube and Lil&#x27; Kim, would go on to sample Latifah&#x27;s track in their songs &quot;You Can&#x27;t Play With My Yo-Yo&quot; and &quot;Wrath of Kim&#x27;s Madness&quot; respectively in later years. Latifah has a two-octave vocal range. She is considered a contralto, with the ability to both rap and sing.

=== 1989–2002: Rap and hip-hop ===
Latifah made her mark in hip-hop by rapping about issues black women face. She wrote songs about topics including domestic violence, street harassment, and troubled relationships.
Freddy helped Latifah sign with Tommy Boy Records, which released Latifah&#x27;s first album &quot;All Hail the Queen&quot; in 1989, when she was nineteen. That year, she appeared as Referee on the UK label Music of Life album &quot;1989The Hustlers Convention (live)&quot;. She received a Candace Award from the National Coalition of 100 Black Women in 1992. The single &quot;Ladies First&quot; featuring Monie Love became the first collaborative track by two female rappers not in a group. In 1993, she released the album &quot;Black Reign&quot;, which was certified Gold in the United States and produced the Grammy Award-winning song &quot;U.N.I.T.Y.&quot; In 1998, co-produced by Ro Smith, now CEO of Def Ro Inc., she released her fourth hip-hop album &quot;Order in the Court&quot;, which was released by Motown Records. Latifah was also a member of the hip-hop collective Native Tongues.

Latifah performed in the Super Bowl XXXII halftime show, making her the first rapper to do so.

=== 2003–2009: Change to traditional singing ===

After &quot;Order in the Court&quot;, Latifah shifted primarily to singing soul music and jazz standards, which she had used sparingly in her previous hip-hop-oriented records. In 2004, she released the soul/jazz standards &quot;The Dana Owens Album&quot;. On July 11, 2007, Latifah sang at the famed Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles as the headlining act in a live jazz concert. In front of a crowd of more than 12,400, she was backed by a 10-piece live orchestra and three backup vocalists, which was billed as the Queen Latifah Orchestra. Latifah performed new arrangements of standards including &quot;California Dreaming&quot;, first made popular by 1960s icons the Mamas &amp; the Papas. Later in 2007, Latifah released an album titled &quot;Trav&#x27;lin&#x27; Light&quot;. Jill Scott, Erykah Badu, Joe Sample, George Duke, Christian McBride, and Stevie Wonder made guest appearances. The album was nominated for a Grammy in the &quot;Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album&quot; category.

In 2009, Latifah, along with the NJPAC Jubilation Choir, recorded the title track on the album &quot;Oh, Happy Day: An All-Star Music Celebration&quot;, covering the song that the Edwin Hawkins Singers made popular in 1969.

=== 2008–present: Return to hip-hop ===
In 2008, Latifah was asked if she would make another hip-hop album. She was quoted stating that the album was done already and it would be called &quot;All Hail the Queen II&quot;. The following year, in 2009, she released her album &quot;Persona&quot;. The song &quot;Cue the Rain&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s lead single. 2011 saw Queen Latifah sing &quot;Who Can I Turn To&quot; in a duet with Tony Bennett for his album &quot;Duets II&quot;. In January 2012, while appearing on &quot;106 &amp; Park&quot; with Dolly Parton, to promote &quot;Joyful Noise&quot;, Latifah stated that she had been working on a new album.

== Film and television ==
=== 1991–2001: Early career ===
She began her film career by having supporting roles in the 1991 and 1992 films &quot;House Party 2&quot;, &quot;Juice&quot; and &quot;Jungle Fever&quot;. Moreover, she has guest starred in two episodes during the second season (1991–1992) of the NBC hit &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot; and had a guest role as herself on the ABC sitcom &quot;Hangin&#x27; with Mr. Cooper&quot; in 1993. From 1993 to 1998, Latifah had a starring role on &quot;Living Single&quot;, the FOX sitcom, which gained high ratings among black audiences; she also wrote and performed its theme song. Her mother Rita played her mother on-screen. Latifah appeared in the 1996 box-office hit, &quot;Set It Off&quot;, and had a supporting role in the Holly Hunter film &quot;Living Out Loud&quot; (1998). She played the role of Thelma in the 1999 movie &quot;The Bone Collector&quot;, alongside Denzel Washington and Angelina Jolie. She also had her own talk show, &quot;The Queen Latifah Show&quot;, from 1999 to 2001 and revamped in 2013. On January 6, 2014, &quot;The Queen Latifah Show&quot; was renewed for a second season. However, on November 21, 2014, Sony Pictures Television canceled Latifah&#x27;s show due to declining ratings. Production of the series closed down, taking effect on December 18, 2014, leaving new episodes that were broadcast until March 6, 2015.

=== 2002–present: Mainstream success ===

Although Latifah had previously received some critical acclaim, she gained mainstream success after being cast as Matron &quot;Mama&quot; Morton in &quot;Chicago&quot;, a musical film that won the Academy Award for Best Picture.

In early 2006, Latifah appeared in a romantic comedy/drama entitled &quot;Last Holiday&quot;. Film critic Richard Roeper stated that &quot;this is the Queen Latifah performance I&#x27;ve been waiting for ever since she broke into movies&quot;. Also in 2006, Latifah voiced Ellie, a friendly mammoth, in the animated film, &quot;Ice Age: The Meltdown&quot; (her first voice appearance in an animated film), and appeared in the drama &quot;Stranger Than Fiction&quot;.

The summer of 2007 brought Latifah triple success in the big-screen version of the Broadway smash hit &quot;Hairspray&quot;, in which she acted, sang, and danced. The film rated highly with critics. It starred, among others, John Travolta, Michelle Pfeiffer, Allison Janney, James Marsden, Christopher Walken, and Zac Efron. Also in 2007, she portrayed an HIV-positive woman in the film &quot;Life Support&quot;, a role for which she garnered her first Golden Globe Award, Screen Actors Guild Award and an Emmy nomination. For her work, Queen Latifah received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, on January 4, 2006, located at 6915 Hollywood Blvd.

In 2009, Latifah was a presenter at the 81st Academy Awards, presenting the segment honoring film professionals who had died during 2008 and singing &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Seeing You&quot; during the montage.

Latifah sang &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; at Super Bowl XLIV hosted in Miami, Florida, on February 7, 2010, with Carrie Underwood. Latifah hosted the 2010 BET Awards on June 27, 2010. She starred with Dolly Parton in &quot;Joyful Noise&quot; (2012). In June 2011, Latifah received an honorary doctorate degree in Humane Letters from Delaware State University in Dover, Delaware. On September 16, 2013, Latifah premiered her own syndicated daytime television show titled &quot;The Queen Latifah Show&quot;. On January 26, 2014, Latifah officiated the weddings of 33 same-sex and opposite-sex couples during a performance of &quot;Same Love&quot; by Macklemore at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards. In 2015, Latifah received a Best Actress Emmy nomination for her lead role as Bessie Smith in &quot;Bessie&quot;, an HBO film which received a total of 12 Emmy nominations.

On April 26, 2017, MTV announced that Latifah will be an executive producer for the third season of the slasher television series &quot;Scream&quot;. The show will undergo a reboot with a new cast and Brett Matthews serving as show runner. In addition, Matthews, Shakim Compere and Yaneley Arty will also be credited as executive producers for the series under Flavor Unit Entertainment. On June 24, 2019, it was confirmed that the third season is scheduled to premiere over three nights on VH1, starting from July 8, 2019. The third season titled &quot;Scream: Resurrection&quot; premiered on July 8, 2019.

Latifah played the sea witch Ursula in &quot;The Little Mermaid Live!&quot;. Although the production itself was not well received, critics widely praised Latifah&#x27;s performance, with &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; calling her performance &quot;the best moment of the evening&quot;.

In 2021, CBS premiered the new active TV series, &quot;The Equalizer&quot;, a reboot of the 1980s detective series of the same name, starring Latifah in the lead role (renamed as Robyn for her version). More recently, she signed a deal with Audible.

== Artistry ==
Latifah&#x27;s music usually contains hip-hop, jazz and gospel and has the elements of R&amp;B, soul, and dance. She possesses a two-octave vocal range. Queen Latifah is a contralto, and she has the ability to rap and sing. Her biggest musical influences are EPMD, KRS-One, LL Cool J, Public Enemy, and Run–D.M.C. She also cites Bessie Smith as one of her influences.

&quot;Al Hail the Queen&quot; features hip-hop, reggae, soulful back-up vocals, boppish scatting, snappy horn back-ups, and house music. She described the work as &quot;a creative outlet... and sometimes it can become like a newspaper that people read with their ears.&quot;

Early in her career, Queen Latifah&#x27;s lyrics were described as woman-centered and Afrocentric. The rapper often used Afrocentric attires during public appearances and music videos, looks that became her trademark. In 1990, &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ Michelle Wallace described her art as &quot;politically sophisticated&quot;, which &quot;seems worlds apart from the adolescent, buffoonish sex orientation of most rap.&quot; For &quot;AllMusic&quot;, her &quot;strong, intelligent, no-nonsense&quot; persona made her &quot;arguably the first MC who could properly be described as feminist&quot;. Queen Latifah did not identify as a feminist at the time, and expressed that her music was not exclusive for the female audience. On the topic, author Tricia Rose wrote that Black female rappers likely did not identify with feminism during that time because it was perceived as a movement that focused primarily on white women&#x27;s issues.

== Products and endorsements ==
Latifah is a celebrity spokesperson for CoverGirl cosmetics, Curvation women&#x27;s underwear, Pizza Hut, and Jenny Craig. She represents her own line of cosmetics for women of color called the CoverGirl Queen Collection. Latifah has also launched a perfume line called &quot;Queen&quot; and &quot;Queen of Hearts&quot;. On May 23, 2018, Latifah was named the godmother of Carnival Cruise Lines&#x27; vessel Carnival Horizon. Apart from singing, Queen Latifah has written a book on confidence and self-respect called &quot;Ladies First: Revelations of a Strong Woman.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Raised in East Orange, New Jersey, Latifah has been a resident of Colts Neck, New Jersey; Rumson, New Jersey; and Beverly Hills, California.

Latifah&#x27;s older brother, Lancelot Jr., was killed in 1992 in an accident involving a motorcycle that Latifah had purchased for him. A 2006 interview revealed that Latifah still wore the key to the motorcycle around her neck, visible throughout her performance in her sitcom &quot;Living Single&quot;. In 1995, Latifah was the victim of a carjacking, which also resulted in the shooting of her boyfriend, Sean Moon.

In 1996, she was arrested and charged with possession of marijuana and possession of a loaded handgun. In 2002, she was arrested for driving under the influence in Los Angeles County. She was placed on three years&#x27; probation after being convicted.

On March 21, 2018, her mother, actress Rita Owens, died due to heart failure, an issue she had been battling since 2004.

Latifah long refused to address speculation around her sexuality and personal life, telling &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 2008 that &quot;I don&#x27;t feel like I need to share my personal life, and I don&#x27;t care if people think I&#x27;m gay or not&quot;. At the BET Awards 2021, during her acceptance speech for the Lifetime Achievement Award, she publicly acknowledged her partner Eboni Nichols and son Rebel for the first time, ending the speech with &quot;Happy Pride!&quot;

In the January 2020 season 6, episode 4 of &quot;Finding Your Roots&quot; titled &quot;This Land Is My Land&quot;, Latifah learned that her family were descended from a line of freed Negroes, since her ancestors were listed by name in the U.S. pre–Civil War census of 1860 in Virginia. Slaves were almost never listed by name in pre–U.S. Civil War censuses. Latifah also learned the exact date her ancestors became free which was October 1, 1792, the date her second earliest known ancestor, a woman named &quot;Jug&quot; or Juggy Owens, was emancipated from slavery.

=== Feud with Foxy Brown ===
Disagreements between Foxy Brown and Queen Latifah began in mid-1996, where media reports indicated that Brown was a prime target of Latifah&#x27;s diss record &quot;Name Callin, which was featured on the &quot;Set It Off&quot; soundtrack. In response, Brown made allegations of Latifah &quot;checking her out&quot; at musical events and further questioned Latifah&#x27;s sexuality in various public radio interviews. In 1998, Brown released a diss record titled &quot;10% Dis&quot;, where she continually questioned Latifah&#x27;s sexuality and accused her of being jealous.

By late spring of 1998, Latifah responded to Brown through another diss record titled &quot;Name Callin&#x27; Part II&quot;. On the record, Latifah disses Brown about her heavy reliance on sex appeal, in which she implies that Brown has to rely on skimpy outfits to hide her &quot;half-assed flow&quot;. Foxy Brown retaliated via a response-diss record titled &quot;Talk to Me&quot;, in which Brown made fun of the ratings of Latifah&#x27;s television talk show and went on to make various homophobic remarks to both Latifah and then-newcomer Queen Pen.

A significant part of media dubbed Latifah &quot;the winner&quot; of the feud. Hip-hop magazine &quot;Ego Trip&quot; stated that Latifah won the feud with her diss record &quot;Name Callin&#x27; Part II&quot; and added that she showed that &quot;the lady&#x27;s still first&quot;, in reference to Latifah&#x27;s 1990 single, &quot;Ladies First&quot;. In 2000, Brown and Latifah reconciled; to prove that the truce was real, Brown performed her song &quot;Na Na Be Like&quot; on &quot;The Queen Latifah Show&quot;.

== Legacy ==

=== Music ===
Often cited as one of the best female rappers, Queen Latifah achieved groundbreaking success in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and became what &quot;Pitchfork&quot; considered as the &quot;most recognizable female rapper&quot; of the golden era of hip hop. &quot;AllMusic&quot; writer Steve Huey stated that Latifah was &quot;certainly not the first female rapper, but she was the first one to become a bona fide star.&quot; In the book &quot;Notable Black American Women&quot;, Jessie Carney Smith hailed her as &quot;rap&#x27;s first feminist&quot; and &quot;one of the few women to make a mark in the male-dominated field of rap music&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; called her &quot;one of the major forerunners for women in modern hip-hop,&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot; referred to her as a &quot;pioneer of female rap&quot;.

Throughout her career, several media publications have referred to her as the &quot;Queen of Rap&quot; including &quot;New York&quot; magazine (1990) via editor Dinitia Smith, as well as &quot;Queen of Hip Hop&quot;. Latifah became the first solo female rapper to receive a RIAA certification for an album (&quot;Black Reign&quot;), a commercial breakthrough that the &quot;AllMusic&quot; editor considered as creating a path for &quot;a talented crew of women rappers to make their own way onto the charts as the 90s progressed&quot;. Her breakthrough also helped place New Jersey on the hip hop map. In 1998, she performed in the Super Bowl XXXII halftime show, making her the first rapper to do so.

According to an &quot;African American Review&quot; journal, her afrocentric feminist music video for &quot;Ladies First&quot; presented a &quot;televisual moment&quot; and disrupted the continuity of sexism and racism that dominated the music videos at the time. The song was listed on the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s 500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll, and was one of the firsts texts to address the declining standards of male-female relationships in community life. Author Tricia Rose expressed that it &quot;offered hip-hop for the development of pro-female pro-black diasporas political consciousness.&quot; In &quot;Consequence&quot;, Okla Jones noted that the song &quot;U.N.I.T.Y.&quot;—which lyrics confront slurs against women in hip-hop culture and address other types of disrespect—created a path for future female rappers to be &quot;their authentic selves&quot;.

=== Acting ===
&quot;Vibe&quot; magazine has noted her as the first female rapper to cross over into TV &amp; film, as an artist that &quot;broke barriers and set standards&quot; for Black women in music to follow, and cited her as the &quot;First Lady of Hip-Hop&quot;. For her performance as Matron &quot;Mama&quot; Morton in &quot;Chicago&quot;, Latifah earned a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, becoming the first woman in hip hop to earn an Oscar nomination.

=== Cultural impact ===
Queen Latifah has been cited as an influence on R&amp;B, soul, and hip-hop artists, such as Eve, Da Brat, Lil&#x27; Kim, Fugees, Jill Scott, Lauryn Hill, Missy Elliott, Remy Ma, Ivy Queen, Foxy Brown, Ms. Dynamite, Naughty by Nature, Rapsody, Megan Thee Stallion, as well as actors Michael K. Williams, Keke Palmer, Vin Diesel, and author Jason Reynolds.

Playwright Lin-Manuel Miranda has stated that Latifah inspired the portrayal of Angelica Schuyler in the musical &quot;Hamilton&quot;. In 2020, &quot;Vogue&quot; editor Janelle Okwodu considered her a fashion icon that &quot;helped to start a conversation about body image that continues to this day&quot;, crediting her among the first artists that pioneered the &quot;climate of size inclusivity and muses of all shapes&quot;.

== Influence on the entertainment industry ==
=== Challenging Eurocentric standards ===
Queen Latifah has demonstrated several forms of activism over her lifetime, challenging Eurocentric ideals and representing the black, female body. An initial sign of the beginning of her resistance to these Eurocentric standards started with her name. Her entire name was self-chosen, and while &#x27;Latifah&#x27; came from an Arabic book, &#x27;Queen&#x27; originated from her desire to create a strong, black identity, which was fueled by her mother, Rita Owens, who gave her the foundation to develop into a self-proclaimed Queen.

Afrocentric Queendom is a concept that Queen Latifah uses to demonstrate her resistance to Eurocentric standards. This term, Afrocentric Queendom, refers to African centered customs that also incorporate female empowerment. Eurocentric constructions are challenged by this concept because Afrocentrism deconstructs oppressive environments, essentially disrupting centralized European spaces. The notion of the term Queen was intentionally crafted by Latifah, redefining what plus size, black women were in society. Over the twentieth century, the term ‘mammy’ coincided with black women because many were left to take care of white children. This term stripped many black women around this time of their name, forcing them to adopt the new identity of ‘mammy.&#x27; Following the emergence of this term, African American women have been stereotyped as mothering figures, while also signaling a loss of identity. This is what Queen Latifah aimed to avoid when creating her stage name, with the intention of opposing the Eurocentric construction of the term mammy. The sole idea of her choosing her name imitates power and promotes strength within herself.

Latifah also rejects Eurocentric standards by embracing Afrocentric ideals and incorporating this concept within her work. She claims that Afrocentricity is a great way of living, creating a sense of pride around her heritage. Within her music, Latifah incorporates Afrobeats and language while also centering black women within her lyrics and visuals. This can be clearly identified in her 1989 ‘Ladies First’ music video, to where South African culture is present in her work, which included Afrocentric visuals and clothes that align culturally with South Africa.

The idea of the black, female body has been criticized and mocked, as well as being imitated over the past couple of decades by celebrities. Queen Latifah, a plus sized, black woman has continued to challenge Eurocentric standards by advocating for body positivity and incorporating her size as a part of her music identity within her early Hip Hop career. Her goal was to politicize and posterize her body to influence young, black girls that all bodies should be accepted, especially in her male dominated field at the time. Throughout her early career, Latifah challenged the Eurocentric mythology of the inferiority of black, female bodies, by creating a marketable figure that was respectable within the Hip Hop industry in the mid-1990s.

Queen Latifah did not always center Africanness around her career, eventually embracing more Black American customs, while not completely abandoning African ideals. This was present through her physical appearance and her music. In her 1993 rap song, U.N.I.T.Y. she incorporates more jazz and soul sounds into her music, as well as empowering lyrics. Her lyrics address concerns regarding harassment and domestic violence within the black community, as well as lyrics to uplift black women, and lyrics that address misogyny within the hip hop community.

=== Early influence of feminism ===
While Afrocentric influence and pro-black productions were what Queen Latifah focused on, she also incorporated feminism throughout her work. Latifah&#x27;s demonstration of Afrocentricity co-existed with how she also demonstrated her feminism. The message of hip hop and rap began to change around the mid-nineties, with rappers like Queen Latifah, as well as Monie Love and Lil&#x27; Kim, changing the narrative. The lyrics of the songs produced by several of these women related to sexual liberation, female autonomy, and sexual domination. Language in hip hop was changed through female artists, reclaiming derogatory words that are used against women and incorporating them within their music.

Queen Latifah&#x27;s name, while self-empowering and challenging Eurocentric ideals, also demonstrates feminist action. The term &quot;queen&quot; refers to a female ruler who is in a higher position than those around her. By placing &quot;Queen&quot; in her stage name, Latifah set herself in a position to counter sexist ideals in the hip-hop and rap music industry, which was primarily dominated by men during this time.

While there were several women, like Latifah, who associated with feminism, there were several women who rejected the idea of incorporating this into their artistry due to negative connotations of this movement. Involvement with feminism could adversely affect their career, especially if the idea of feminism is rejected by people who dominate the music industry. Queen Latifah was not a follower in this situation, subtly incorporating third-wave feminism within her lyrics, which specifically addressed the inclusion of women of color in feminism and the elimination of homophobia.

=== Flavor Unit Records ===
Latifah also founded a production company, which was referred to as Flavor Unit Records, eventually Flavor Unit Entertainment, co-launching it in 1995 with her business partner Shakim Compere. Near the creation of this label, she helped several artists create their music, such as Daddy D. Daddy D was Latifah&#x27;s first artist to create a single with. Her purpose was to create a multimedia company that operates at full service. Several music artists at the time wanted to join Queen Latifah&#x27;s label because they easily identified her success, from an artist herself, to a self made label chief. The label remained quite small in the nineties, but eventually gained traction as Queen Latifah gained more attention. While her record label helped several artists start up their career, she remained at Motown Records for her own benefit.

=== Portrayal of characters ===
Queen Latifah expanded her career from music, branching out to acting, as well as producing. Her first role that she took on was in the movie Jungle Fever, which was released in 1991, where she performed among several significant black actors, such as Samuel L. Jackson and Halle Berry. Her role in this movie was not major, but displayed her overall talent enough in the film. She later moved to entertainment television, starring and co-producing certain episodes of the show Living Single.

==== Living Single ====
Queen Latifah was the star of her own sitcom, which followed her character, Khadijah James, and three of her black, female friends. This sitcom that aired for three years aimed to highlight the Black American experience by demonstrating Black excellence. Latifah&#x27;s character is described to embody what black womanhood was in the early nineties. Her character was well rounded and represented the idea of a ‘girl boss’ was. With this all black cast, the possibilities for characters to be presented in a variety of ways were endless. Some characters, such as Maxine Shaw, played by Erika Alexander, were depicted as lawyers, while others were depicted as wealthy, such as Regine Hunter, played by Kim Fields. Khadijah was everything from a business owner, to a songwriter, to a friend, all while maintaining the lead role in the show. Depth and duality behind black characters on sitcoms within the nineties was not very common outside of Black Entertainment Television (BET), so it was quite significant to television when Queen Latifiah took on such an important role. With the help of Queen Latifah, Yvette Lee Bowser, the executive producer and creator, was actively changing the perception of Black Americans, painting a new light on the Black experience.  

Through her performance through the show, Latifah showed the complexity of Black womanhood successfully. There were several parallels that were identified between Living Single and Queen Latifah&#x27;s life, such as how both she and her character had to navigate a male-dominated industry while trying to be successful. Their personalities also align, both being outspoken, confident, and driven. Latifah realistically depicted a black woman on television by simply acting as herself on Living Single.

=== Early influence of sexuality in entertainment (before the 2000s) ===
Queen Latifah&#x27;s sexuality has always come into question through her on-screen performances. In one of her films, 1996&#x27;s &quot;Set It Off&quot;, she takes on a more masculine role. Cleopatra Sims (Cleo), Latifah&#x27;s character, can be described as a butch, lesbian bank robber, which highlighted her sexuality. She was so successful while playing this masculine role, that rumors about her sexuality started spreading. In the early stages of her career, Latifah chose not to address the rumors regarding her sexuality, letting the public categorize her in their own way. Queen Latifah&#x27;s ambiguity played to her strengths when acting, allowing her to have versatile roles and not become constrained to certain acting roles because of her off screen sexuality. This can be identified in many of her later films in her career, playing a range of either oversexualized characters or sexually muted characters. The distance Queen Latifah created from assumptions about her sexuality in her early career excluded her from any queer discourse throughout the nineties. Her involvement in offhanded politics and pro-black work productions helped define her work, while her sexuality did not affect her work, early on.

==Accolades==
Queen Latifah became the first female hip-hop recording artist to get nominated for an Oscar. In 2003, Queen Latifah was awarded Artist of the Year by Harvard Foundation. In 2006, Latifah became the first hip-hop artist to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and was also inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame in 2011. In her music career, Queen Latifah has sold nearly 2 million albums in the US. &quot;The Root&quot; ranked her at number 35 on &quot;The Root&quot; 100 list. In 2017, American Black Film Festival honored Latifah with the Entertainment Icon award. In 2018, she received an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts Degree by the Rutgers University. In 2019, Harvard University awarded the W. E. B. Du Bois Medal to Queen Latifah for cultural contributions. In 2023, Queen Latifah&#x27;s debut album &quot;All Hail the Queen,&quot; was added into the Library of Congress&#x27;s National Recording Registry, making it the earliest female rap recording to enter the National Recording Registry, and made her the second female hip-hop recording artist to have her music included after Lauryn Hill; however some outlets incorrectly reported her as the first to accomplish the feat.

She is a recipient of a Grammy Award from six nominations, a Golden Globe Award, two Screen Actors Guild Awards from five nominations, two NAACP Image Awards from thirteen nominations, one Primetime Emmy Award from three nominations, and an Academy Award nomination. In 2021, she received the BET Lifetime Achievement Award, and was the first rapper, female or male, to be so awarded. In 2023, she became the first female rapper to be a Kennedy Center honoree.

<doc id="148785" wikidata="Q185844" url="?curid=148785" title="Quintillus">
<text>Marcus Aurelius Claudius Quintillus (died 270) was a short-lived Roman emperor. He took power after the death of his brother, Emperor Claudius Gothicus, in 270 CE. After reigning for a few weeks Quintillus was overthrown by Aurelian, who had been proclaimed rival emperor by the legions he commanded. The ancient sources variously report him to have killed himself, to have fallen in battle against Aurelian, or to have been murdered by his own soldiers.

==Early life==
Marcus Aurelius Claudius Quintillus&#x27; exact birthplace is unknown. An Illyrian, he was likely born in Pannonia Inferior, as is indicated by his coinage. Originating from a low-born family, Quintillus came to prominence with the accession of his brother Claudius Gothicus to the imperial throne in 268 CE. Quintillus was possibly made Procurator of Sardinia during his brother&#x27;s reign.

==Reign of Quintillus==
Quintillus was declared emperor after Claudius died in 270 CE. Eutropius reports Quintillus to have been elected by soldiers of the Roman army immediately following the death of his brother; the choice was reportedly approved by the Roman Senate. Joannes Zonaras reports him elected by the Senate itself. Records, however, agree that the legions which had followed Claudius in campaigning along the Danube were either unaware or disapproving of Quintillus&#x27; elevation. They instead elevated their current leader Aurelian as emperor.

The few records of Quintillus&#x27; reign are contradictory. It is variously reported to have lasted 17 days (Jerome, Eutropius and Zonaras), 77 days (Filocalus), or &quot;a few months&quot; (Zosimus). Modern scholars believe &quot;17&quot; to be a misreading of a larger number, since Quintillus had time to produce an abundance of coins. Records also disagree on the cause of his death. The &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; reports him murdered by his own soldiers in reaction to his strict military discipline. Jerome says that he was slain at Aquileia, without further specifics. According to Joannes Zonaras, Quintillus opened his veins and bled himself to death; John of Antioch concurs, adding that the suicide was assisted by a physician. Claudius Salmasius noted that Dexippus recorded the death without stating causes. All records, however, agree in placing the death at Aquileia. Quintillus was reportedly survived by his two sons.

The &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; reports Claudius and Quintillus having another brother named Crispus and through him a niece, Claudia, who reportedly married Eutropius and was mother to Constantius Chlorus. Some historians however suspect this account to be a genealogical fabrication to flatter Constantine I.

==Legacy==

His reign was very short and he never managed to visit Rome as emperor. Surviving Roman records considered Quintillus a moderate and capable emperor. He was seen as a champion of the Senate and thus compared to previous emperors Galba and Pertinax. All three were highly regarded by senatorial sources despite their failure to survive a full year of reign. In his reign the priestly offices held by the emperor were separated and the image of the emperor as &quot;pontifex maximus&quot; was abandoned.

<doc id="148786" wikidata="Q211136" url="?curid=148786" title="Jaco Pastorius">
<text>John Francis Anthony Pastorius III, also known as Jaco Pastorius (; December 1, 1951 – September 21, 1987) was an American jazz bassist, composer, and producer. Widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential bassists of all time, Pastorius recorded albums as a solo artist, band leader, and as a member of the jazz fusion group Weather Report from 1976 to 1981. He also collaborated with numerous artists, including Herbie Hancock, Pat Metheny and Joni Mitchell.

His bass style was influenced by funk and employed the use of fretless bass, lyrical solos, bass chords and innovative use of harmonics. As of 2017, he was the only one of seven bassists inducted into the &quot;DownBeat&quot; Jazz Hall of Fame to have been known for their work on the electric bass, and he has been lauded as among the best bassists of all time.

Pastorius suffered from drug addiction and mental health issues and, despite his widespread acclaim, over the latter part of his life he had problems holding down jobs due to his unreliability. In frequent financial difficulties, he was often homeless in the mid-1980s. He died in 1987 as a result of injuries sustained in a beating outside a South Florida after-hours nightclub.

Since his death in 1987, his work has continued to be widely influential. He was elected to the &quot;DownBeat&quot; Hall of Fame in 1988 and was the subject of the 2014 documentary film &quot;Jaco&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Pastorius was born December 1, 1951, in Norristown, Pennsylvania, the oldest of three boys born to Stephanie Catherine ( Haapala; 1925–2001), who was of Finnish descent, and musician John Francis Pastorius Jr. (1922–2004), a singer and jazz drummer of Italian and German descent, who spent much of his time on the road. His family moved to Oakland Park near Fort Lauderdale when he was eight. Early American abolitionist Francis Daniel Pastorius is his ancestor.

The origin of Pastorius&#x27; nickname, &quot;Jaco&quot;, is disputed. There is an interview with Jaco&#x27;s father, Jack Pastorius, that took place in 2001 hosted by Bob Miles. Jack says that he was given the nickname during his service in the Navy. He later began calling Pastorius by this nickname in his early childhood. In the Robert Trujillo documentary &quot;Jaco&quot;, Pastorius&#x27; brother said that their mother came up with the nickname. It is also believed that the nickname was partially influenced by his love for sports as well as the umpire Jocko Conlan. In 1974, he began spelling it &quot;Jaco&quot; after it was misspelled by his neighbor, pianist Alex Darqui. His brother called him &quot;Mowgli&quot; after the wild boy in &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; because he was energetic and spent much of his time shirtless on the beach, climbing trees, running through the woods, and swimming in the ocean. He attended St. Clement&#x27;s Catholic School in Wilton Manors, Florida, and was an altar boy at St. Clement&#x27;s Church. His confirmation name was Anthony. He was intensely competitive and excelled at baseball, basketball, and football. He played drums until he injured his wrist playing football when he was thirteen. The damage was severe enough to warrant corrective surgery and inhibited his ability to play the drums.

By age 17, Pastorius began appreciating jazz and had saved enough money to buy an upright bass. Its deep, mellow tone appealed to him, though it strained his finances. He had difficulty maintaining the instrument, which he attributed to the humidity in Florida. When he woke one day to find it had cracked, he traded it for a 1962 Fender Jazz Bass.

During his teens, he played bass guitar for Wayne Cochran and the C.C. Riders.

In the early 1970s, Pastorius taught bass at the University of Miami, where he befriended jazz guitarist Pat Metheny, who was on the school&#x27;s faculty. With Paul Bley and Bruce Ditmas, Pastorius and Metheny recorded an untitled album, &quot;Jaco&quot; in 1974. Pastorius then played on Metheny&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Bright Size Life&quot; (ECM, 1976). He recorded his debut solo album, &quot;Jaco Pastorius&quot; (Epic, 1976), with Michael Brecker, Randy Brecker, Herbie Hancock, Hubert Laws, Sam &amp; Dave, David Sanborn, and Wayne Shorter.

==Career==
===Weather Report===

Before recording his debut album, Pastorius attended a concert in Miami by the jazz fusion band Weather Report. After the concert, he approached keyboardist Joe Zawinul, who led the band. As was his habit, he introduced himself by saying, &quot;I&#x27;m John Francis Pastorius III. I&#x27;m the greatest bass player in the world.&quot; Zawinul admired his brashness and asked for a demo tape. After listening to the tape, Zawinul realized that Pastorius had considerable skill. They corresponded, and Pastorius sent Zawinul a rough mix of his solo album.

After bassist Alphonso Johnson left Weather Report, Zawinul asked Pastorius to join the band. Pastorius made his band debut on the album &quot;Black Market&quot; (Columbia, 1976), in which he shared the bass chair with Johnson. Pastorius was fully established as sole band bass player for the recording of &quot;Heavy Weather&quot; (Columbia, 1977), which contained the Grammy-nominated hit &quot;Birdland&quot;.

During his time with Weather Report, Pastorius began abusing alcohol and illegal drugs, which exacerbated existing mental problems and led to erratic behavior. He left Weather Report in 1982 because of clashes with tour commitments for his other projects, plus a growing dissatisfaction with Zawinul&#x27;s synthesized and orchestrated approach to the band&#x27;s music.

===Word of Mouth===

Warner Bros. signed Pastorius to a favorable contract in the late 1970s based on his groundbreaking skill and his star quality, which they hoped would lead to large sales. He used this contract to set up his Word of Mouth big band, which consisted of Chuck Findley on trumpet; Howard Johnson on tuba; Wayne Shorter, Michael Brecker, and Tom Scott on reeds; Toots Thielemans on harmonica; Kenwood Dennard, Peter Erskine and Jack DeJohnette on drums; and Don Alias on percussion. This was the group that recorded his second solo album, &quot;Word of Mouth&quot; (Warner Bros., 1981).

In 1982, Pastorius toured with Word of Mouth as a 21-piece big band. While in Japan, to the alarm of his band members, he shaved his head, painted his face black, and threw his bass guitar into Hiroshima Bay. He was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in late 1982 after the tour. Pastorius had shown signs of bipolar disorder before his diagnosis, but these signs were dismissed as eccentricities, character flaws, and by Pastorius himself as a normal part of his freewheeling personality.

Despite attention in the press, &quot;Word of Mouth&quot; sold poorly. Warner Bros. was unimpressed by the demo tapes from &quot;Holiday for Pans&quot;. Pastorius released a third album, &quot;Invitation&quot; (1983), a live recording from the Word of Mouth tour of Japan. As alcohol and drug problems dominated his life, he had trouble finding work and wound up becoming homeless. In 1985, while filming an instructional video (&quot;Modern Electric Bass&quot;), Pastorius told the interviewer, Jerry Jemmott, that although he had been praised often for his ability, he wished that someone would give him a job. However, the same year, he gave a much praised concert in Brussels (Belgium) with Toots Thielemans.

===Stage presence and bass techniques===

Until about 1970, most jazz bassists played the upright bass, also known as the double bass. At the time, with few exceptions (such as the bass players in the trios Bill Evans led), bassists typically remained in the background with the drummer, forming the rhythm section, while the saxophonist, trumpeter, or vocalist handled the melody and led the band. Pastorius had other ideas for the bass player. He played an electric bass from which he had removed the frets. He played fast and loud, sang, and did flips. He spread powder on the stage so he could dance like James Brown. He joked around and talked to the crowd. A self-described Florida beach bum, he often went barefoot and shirtless. He was tall, lean, and strong, and for someone who played sports the nickname &quot;Jocko&quot; fit. His thumbs were &quot;double jointed&quot; and his fingers were long and thin.

After being taught about artificial harmonics, he added them to his technique and repertoire. Natural harmonics, also known as open string harmonics, are played by lightly touching the string with the fretting/fingering hand while plucking the string, resulting in a note that rings, somewhat like a bell. Artificial harmonics, also called false harmonics, involve fretting with the left hand as usual while using a finger or thumb of the right hand at the fret an octave higher, simultaneously playing and stopping the note.) An often cited example is the introduction to &quot;Birdland&quot;.

He used virtuosic bass lines which combined Afro-Cuban rhythms, inspired by the likes of Cachao Lopez, with R&amp;B to create 16th-note funk lines syncopated with ghost notes. He played these with a &quot;movable anchor&quot; thumb technique on the right hand, anchoring on the bridge pickup while playing on the E and A strings and muting the E string with his thumb while playing on higher strings. Examples include &quot;Come On, Come Over&quot; from the album &quot;Jaco Pastorius&quot; and &quot;The Chicken&quot; from &quot;The Birthday Concert&quot;.

Another characteristic of Jaco&#x27;s playing was his use of the octave technique which is very often used with slap bass. Jaco&#x27;s use of the technique with fingerstyle was revolutionary at the time, since previously it had only really been used on guitars. This technique is demonstrated on the tracks &quot;Portrait of Tracy&quot; from &quot;Jaco Pastorius&quot; and on &quot;Birdland&quot; from &quot;Heavy Weather&quot;. Another aspect of his playing was the heavy use of chromatic runs; these were played with immense speed and precision and became very characteristic of his style. These can be heard on &quot;Opus Pocus&quot; from &quot;Jaco Pastorius&quot;, and &quot;Port of Entry&quot; from &quot;Night Passage&quot;.

==Equipment==
===Bass of Doom===

Pastorius played a number of Fender Jazz Basses over the years, but the most famous was a 1962 Jazz Bass that he called the Bass of Doom. When he was 21, Pastorius acquired the bass, which was modified by removing the frets. It is unclear when the frets were removed, as his recollections varied over the years. One story is that he used a common butter knife to remove the frets, and sealed the fretboard with epoxy resin.

In 1986, the bass was repaired by luthiers Kevin Kaufman and Jim Hamilton, after it had been broken into many pieces. After the repair Pastorius recorded a session with Mike Stern, then the bass was stolen from a park bench in Manhattan in 1986. It was found in a guitar shop in 2006, but the shop owner refused to give it up. The Pastorius family enlisted lawyers to help but nearly went bankrupt in 2010. Robert Trujillo, bassist for Metallica, considers Pastorius to be one of his heroes, and he felt that the family ought to have the bass. Trujillo helped pay to have it returned to them. He has used the instrument to record and perform and is its legal custodian.

Fender began offering a fretless version of its standard Jazz Bass in the mid-1980s, and in 1999 began offering the &quot;Fender Jaco Pastorius Jazz Bass&quot; in its Artist series, and Custom Shop series. These instruments were modelled on the Bass of Doom, with the Custom Shop version featuring a fretboard sealed with epoxy resin. In the 2000s Fender&#x27;s budget brand Squier offered the &quot;Squier Vintage Modified Fretless Jazz Bass&quot; which was also reminiscent of Jaco&#x27;s instrument.

Since the 1980s, other companies have offered fretless basses similar to, or modelled on, the Bass of Doom, such as Tokai and Edwards.

===Amplification and effects===
Pastorius used the &quot;Variamp&quot; EQ (equalization) controls on his two Acoustic 360 amplifiers (made by the Acoustic Control Corporation) to boost the midrange frequencies, thus accentuating the natural growling tone of his fretless passive Fender Jazz Bass and roundwound string combination. He also controlled his tone color with a rackmount MXR digital delay unit that fed a second Acoustic amp rig.

During the final three years of his life he used Hartke cabinets because of the character of aluminum speaker cones (as opposed to paper speaker cones). These provided a bright, clear sound. He typically used the delay in a chorus-like mode, providing a shimmering stereo doubling effect. He often used the fuzz control built into the Acoustic 360. For the bass solo &quot;Slang/Third Stone From the Sun&quot; on Weather Report&#x27;s live album &quot;8:30&quot; (1979), Pastorius used the MXR digital delay to layer and loop a chordal figure and then soloed over it; the same technique, with a looped bass riff, can be heard during his solo on the Joni Mitchell concert video &quot;Shadows and Light&quot;.

==Guest appearances==
Pastorius appeared as a guest on many albums by other artists, including Ian Hunter of Mott the Hoople, and recorded a solo on the title track of his album &quot;All American Alien Boy&quot; in 1976. He can be heard on Airto Moreira&#x27;s album &quot;I&#x27;m Fine, How Are You?&quot; (1977). His signature sound is prominent on Flora Purim&#x27;s &quot;Everyday Everynight&quot; (1978), on which he played the bass melody for a Michel Colombier composition entitled &quot;The Hope&quot;, and performed bass and vocals on one of his own compositions, entitled &quot;Las Olas&quot;. Other recordings included work on four Joni Mitchell albums between 1976 and 1980 (&quot;Hejira&quot;; &quot;Don Juan&#x27;s Reckless Daughter&quot;; &quot;Mingus&quot;; and &quot;Shadows and Light&quot;) and Al Di Meola&#x27;s &quot;Land of the Midnight Sun&quot;, released in 1976. Near the end of his career, he worked often with guitarist Mike Stern, guitarist Biréli Lagrène, and drummer Brian Melvin.

==Awards and honors==
Pastorius received two Grammy Award nominations in 1977 for his self-titled debut album: one for Best Jazz Performance by a Group and one for Best Jazz Performance by a Soloist (&quot;Donna Lee&quot;). In 1978, he received a Grammy nomination for Best Jazz Performance by a Soloist for his work on Weather Report&#x27;s album &quot;Heavy Weather&quot;.

&quot;Bass Player&quot; magazine gave him second place on a list of the one hundred greatest bass players of all time, behind James Jamerson. After his death in 1987, he was voted, by readers of &quot;DownBeat&quot; magazine, to its Hall of Fame, joining bassists Jimmy Blanton, Ray Brown, Ron Carter, Charles Mingus, Charlie Haden, and Milt Hinton.

Marcus Miller said &quot;Jaco&#x27;s composing was as unique as his playing.&quot;

Many musicians have composed songs in his honour, such as Pat Metheny&#x27;s &quot;Jaco&quot; on the album &quot;Pat Metheny Group&quot; (1978), &quot;Mr. Pastorius&quot; by Marcus Miller on Miles Davis&#x27;s album &quot;Amandla&quot;, and Rod Argent&#x27;s &quot;Pastorius Mentioned&quot; on his 1978 album &quot;Moving Home&quot;. Others who have dedicated compositions to him include Randy Brecker, Eliane Elias, Chuck Loeb, John McLaughlin, Bob Moses, Ana Popović, Dave Samuels, and the Yellowjackets.

On December 2, 2007, the day after his birthday, a concert called &quot;20th Anniversary Tribute to Jaco Pastorius&quot; was held at Broward Center for the Performing Arts in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, with performances by the Jaco Pastorius Big Band and appearances by Randy Brecker, Dave Bargeron, Peter Erskine, Jimmy Haslip, Bob Mintzer, Gerald Veasley, Pastorius&#x27;s sons John and Julius Pastorius, Pastorius&#x27;s daughter Mary Pastorius, Ira Sullivan, Bobby Thomas Jr., and Dana Paul. Almost twenty years after his death, Fender released the Jaco Pastorius Jazz Bass, a fretless instrument in its Artist Series.

He has been called &quot;arguably the most important and ground-breaking electric bassist in history&quot; and &quot;perhaps the most influential electric bassist today&quot;.

William C. Banfield, director of Africana Studies, Music and Society at Berklee College, described Pastorius as one of the few original American virtuosos who defined a musical movement, in addition to Jimi Hendrix, Louis Armstrong, Thelonious Monk, Charlie Christian, Bud Powell, Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, John Coltrane, Sarah Vaughan, Bill Evans, Charles Mingus, and Wes Montgomery.

A public park is named for, and dedicated to, Jaco in the city he grew up in, Oakland Park, Florida.

==Death==
On September 11, 1987, Pastorius sneaked onto the stage at a Santana concert at the Sunrise Musical Theater in Sunrise, Florida. Weather Report was an associated act of Santana in the mid-seventies. After being ejected from the premises, he made his way to the Midnight Bottle Club in Wilton Manors. After reportedly kicking in a glass door, having been refused entrance to the club, he became involved in a violent confrontation with Luc Havan, a club employee who was a martial arts expert. Pastorius was hospitalized for multiple facial fractures and injuries to his right eye and left arm, and fell into a coma. There were encouraging signs that he would come out of the coma and recover, but they soon faded. A brain hemorrhage a few days later led to brain death. He was taken off life support and died on September 21, 1987, at the age of 35, at Broward General Medical Center in Fort Lauderdale. His funeral was held at St. Clement&#x27;s Catholic Church, Wilton Manors, Florida. Pastorius was buried at Queen of Heaven Cemetery in North Lauderdale, Broward County, Florida.

Havan faced a charge of second-degree murder. He pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was sentenced to twenty-two months in prison and five years&#x27; probation. After serving four months in prison, he was paroled for good behavior.

== Legacy ==
The legacy of Jaco Pastorius is one of the most impactful in the world of electric bass in jazz and in general for every genre, despite his flawed and controversial latter years, although as time passed, his work began to be more appreciated by musicians. Known for his solo career with the self titled album &quot;Jaco Pastorius&quot;, the track &quot;Donna Lee&quot; is remembered as showcasing his incredible feel and speed on the electric bass, a level of skill which had not been seen before. In his contributions to Weather Report, he is remembered for his incredibly precise and fast bass lines, played with flash and gusto. The fact that he entered the music scene at the age of only 16 has inspired future musicians such as Victor Wooten and Kinga Głyk. Jaco&#x27;s legacy, while having some aspects that many find to be negative, overwhelmingly shows his unmatched skill and trailblazing in the world of jazz and electric bass performance.

Many rock and metal bassists have expressed their admiration for Pastorius, or have cited him as an influence or inspiration to their playing. These bass players include Jeff Ament (Pearl Jam), Michael Anthony (Van Halen, Chickenfoot and Sammy Hagar and the Circle), Frank Bello (Anthrax), Rex Brown (Pantera and Down), Chris Chaney (AC/DC, Jane&#x27;s Addiction and Slash), Tim Commerford (Rage Against the Machine and Audioslave), Steve Di Giorgio (Testament, Sadus and Death), David Ellefson (Megadeth), Flea (Red Hot Chili Peppers), Tony Franklin (The Firm and Blue Murder), John Myung (Dream Theater), Paulo Jr. (Sepultura), Billy Sheehan (The Winery Dogs, David Lee Roth, Mr. Big and Sons of Apollo), Jeroen Paul Thesseling (Pestilence and Obscura), Robert Trujillo (Metallica), Joey Vera (Armored Saint, Fates Warning and Mercyful Fate), and Alex Webster (Cannibal Corpse).

His nephew is David Pastorius.

<text>Roy Sydney George Hattersley, Baron Hattersley, (born 28 December 1932) is a British politician, author and journalist from Sheffield. A member of the Labour Party, he was MP for Birmingham Sparkbrook for over 32 years from 1964 to 1997, and served as Deputy Leader of the Labour Party from 1983 to 1992.

==Early life==
Roy Hattersley was born on 28 December 1932 in Sheffield, West Riding of Yorkshire, to Enid Brackenbury and Frederick Roy Hattersley (1902–1973; also known by his middle name), who married in the 1950s. His mother was a city councillor, and later served as Lord Mayor of Sheffield (1981). His father, at various times a police officer, clerk at Sheffield town hall, and chairman of the council&#x27;s Health Committee, was a former Roman Catholic priest, the parish priest at St Joseph&#x27;s at Shirebrook in Derbyshire, who renounced the church and left the priesthood to cohabit with Hattersley&#x27;s mother, Enid, a married woman at whose wedding he had officiated two weeks earlier; Frederick ultimately died an atheist.

==Early political career and education==
Hattersley was a socialist and Labour supporter from his youth, electioneering at the age of 12 for his local MP and city councillors, beginning in 1945. He attended Sheffield City Grammar School passing the eleven-plus (locally known as the &quot;scholarship&quot;) on his second attempt in 1945 and went from there to study at the University of Hull. Having been accepted to read English at the University of Leeds, he was diverted into reading Economics at Hull when told by a Sheffield colleague of his mother that it was necessary for a political career.

At university, Hattersley joined the Socialist Society (SocSoc) and was one of those responsible for changing its name to the &quot;Labour Club&quot; and affiliating it with the non-aligned International Union of Socialist Youth (IUSY) rather than the Soviet-backed International Union of Students. Hattersley became chairman of the new club and later treasurer, and he went on to chair the National Association of Labour Student Organisations. He also joined the executive of the IUSY.

==Member of Parliament==
After graduating Hattersley worked briefly for a Sheffield steelworks and then for two years with the Workers&#x27; Educational Association. He married his first wife, Molly, who became a headteacher and educational administrator. In 1956 he was elected to the City Council as Labour representative for Crookesmoor and was, very briefly, a JP. On the Council he spent time as chairman of the Public Works Committee and then the Housing Committee.

His aim became a Westminster seat, and he was eventually selected for Labour to stand for election in the Sutton Coldfield constituency but lost to the Conservative Geoffrey Lloyd in 1959. He kept hunting for prospective candidacies, applying for twenty-five seats over three years. In 1963 he was chosen as the prospective parliamentary candidate for the multi-racial Birmingham Sparkbrook constituency (following a well-known local &#x27;character&#x27;, Jack Webster) and facing a Conservative majority of just under 900. On 16 October 1964 he defeated the Conservative candidate, Michael J. Donnelly, and was elected with a majority of 1,254 votes; he was to hold the seat for the next eight general elections.

===Journalist===
At first he was Parliamentary private secretary to Margaret Herbison, the Minister for Pensions. His maiden speech was on a housing subsidies bill. Still a Gaitskellite, he also joined the 1963 Club. He also wrote his first &quot;Endpiece&quot; column for &quot;The Spectator&quot; (the column moved to &quot;The Listener&quot; in 1979, and then to &quot;The Guardian&quot;).

===Ministerial positions===
Despite the support of Roy Jenkins and Tony Crosland he did not gain a ministerial position until 1967, joining Ray Gunter at the Ministry of Labour. He was reportedly disliked by Prime Minister Harold Wilson as a &quot;Jenkinsite&quot;. The following year he was promoted to Under Secretary in the same ministry, now led by Barbara Castle, and become closely involved in implementing the unpopular Prices and Incomes Act 1966. In 1969, after the fiasco over &quot;In Place of Strife&quot;, he was promoted to deputy to Denis Healey, the Minister of Defence, following the death of Gerry Reynolds. One of his first jobs, while Healey was hospitalised, was to sign the Army Board Order – putting troops into Northern Ireland.

===European Common Market===

The Labour defeat of 1970 ended six years of Labour government. Hattersley held his seat – often increasing his majority – for the next 26 years, but he spent 21 of those years in Opposition. He was appointed Deputy Foreign Affairs Spokesman, again under Healey, which involved a lot of foreign travel. He also took a Visiting Fellowship to the Harvard Kennedy School. During this time he also became an enthusiastic supporter of the Common Market, and his &quot;drift to the political centre&quot; put him at odds with much of the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP).

Hattersley was one of the sixty-nine &quot;rebels&quot; who voted with the Conservative government in favour of entry into the EEC, which precipitated the resignation of Roy Jenkins as deputy leader (10 April 1972) and eventually a permanent split within Labour. (It was the adoption of a referendum on the EEC as shadow cabinet policy that caused Jenkins to resign.) For &quot;standing by&quot; the party, Hattersley was appointed Shadow Defence Secretary 1972 to 1973 and later Shadow Secretary of State for Education.

===Privy Council===
In the Wilson government of 1974, Hattersley was appointed the (non-cabinet) Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, and in the 1975 New Year Honours, he was sworn of the Privy Council. Hattersley headed the British delegation to Reykjavik during the &quot;Cod Wars&quot;, but was primarily given the task of renegotiating the terms of the UK&#x27;s membership of the EEC. Following the resignation of Wilson he voted for James Callaghan in the ensuing leadership contest to stop Michael Foot (a man &quot;[who] for all his virtues ... could not become Prime Minister&quot;). Under Callaghan he finally made it into the Cabinet as Secretary of State for Prices and Consumer Protection, a position he held until Labour&#x27;s defeat in the 1979 general election.

In 1979 Hattersley was appointed to shadow Michael Heseltine as the Minister for the Environment, contending with him over the cuts in local government powers and the &quot;Right to Buy&quot;. Following the rise of the &#x27;hard left&#x27;, as demonstrated at the 1980 Labour Conference, Callaghan resigned. The leadership contest was between Healey and Foot, with Hattersley organising Healey&#x27;s campaign. &quot;An electorate [the PLP] deranged by fear&quot; elected Foot. Healey was made deputy leader and Hattersley was appointed Shadow Home Secretary, but felt that Foot was &quot;a good man in the wrong job&quot;, &quot;a baffling combination of the admirable and the absurd&quot;.

Healey was challenged for his post in 1981, following electoral rule changes, by Tony Benn, retaining his post by 50.426% to 49.574%. Hattersley felt that &quot;the Bennite alliance [although defeated] ... played a major part in keeping the Conservatives in power for almost twenty years&quot;. Hattersley also had very little regard for those Labour defectors who created the SDP in 1981. He helped found Labour Solidarity (1981–83) and credits the group with preventing the disintegration of the Labour Party.

===Deputy Leader===
Following Labour&#x27;s devastating defeat in the 1983 general election Foot declined to continue as leader. Hattersley stood in the subsequent leadership election. John Smith was his campaign manager and a young Peter Mandelson impressed Hattersley. The other competitors were Neil Kinnock, Peter Shore, and Eric Heffer. Hattersley had the support of most of the Shadow Cabinet, but the majority of the PLP, the constituency groups and the unions were in favour of Kinnock. In the final count Kinnock secured around three times as many votes as the second-place Hattersley. As was standard practice at the time, Hattersley was elected deputy leader. The combination was promoted at the time as being a &quot;dream ticket&quot; with Kinnock a representative of the left of the party and Hattersley of the right. Hattersley remained deputy for nine years and also Shadow Chancellor until 1987, when he moved back to Shadow Home Affairs.

Kinnock and Hattersley attempted to &quot;rehabilitate&quot; Labour after 1983. Following the miners&#x27; strike of 1984–1985 they resumed expulsions of members of the entryist Militant group whose activities, organisation and politics had earlier been found to contravene the Labour Party&#x27;s constitution. In 1988 they fought off a leadership challenge by Tony Benn, Eric Heffer, and John Prescott. Defeat in 1987 was expected; by 1992 it was much more even. Labour had regularly topped opinion polls since 1989 and at one stage had a lead of up to 15 points over the Conservatives, though this was cut back and more than once overhauled by the Tories following the resignation of Margaret Thatcher as prime minister to make way for John Major in November 1990. In the run-up to the 1992 election, Hattersley was present at the Labour Party rally in his native Sheffield and backed up Kinnock with the claim that &quot;with every day that passes, Neil looks more and more like the real tenant of number 10 Downing Street&quot;.

==Backbenches and retirement==
The 1992 general election was held on 9 April 1992, but saw a fourth consecutive Labour defeat by the Conservatives. Kinnock announced his resignation as party leader on 13 April, and on the same day Hattersley announced his intention to resign from the deputy leadership of the party, with the intention of carrying on in their roles until the new leadership was elected that summer. Hattersley supported his friend John Smith in the leadership contest, which Smith won in July that year.

In June 1993, Hattersley cancelled an appearance on TV panel show &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; with very late notice, which infuriated the production staff and hosts, leading to Hattersley being replaced with a tub of lard. The programme compared Hattersley and the tub of lard, and claimed &quot;they possessed the same qualities and were liable to give similar performances&quot;.

In February 1994, Hattersley announced he would leave politics at the following general election. He was made a life peer as Baron Hattersley, of Sparkbrook in the County of West Midlands on 24 November 1997.

Hattersley was long regarded as being on the right-wing of the party, but with New Labour in power he found himself criticising a Labour government from the left, stating that &quot;Blair&#x27;s Labour Party is not the Labour Party I joined&quot;. He mentioned repeatedly that he would be supporting Gordon Brown as leader.

Hattersley retired from the House of Lords on 19 May 2017.

==Later life==
In 1996, Hattersley was fined for an incident in which his dog Buster killed a goose in one of London&#x27;s royal parks. He later wrote the &quot;diary&quot; of Buster, writing from the dog&#x27;s perspective on the incident, in which it claimed to have acted in self-defence.

In 2003, Hattersley was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. Hattersley is the author of three novels and several biographies. He has written biographies on religious topics, and on the Edwardian period as well. His 700-page biography of David Lloyd George &quot;The Great Outsider: David Lloyd George&quot; was published by Little, Brown in 2010.

In 2008, Hattersley appeared in a documentary on the DVD for the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;Doctor Who and the Silurians&quot;, to discuss the political climate that existed at the time of making the serial.

==Personal life==
Hattersley married his first wife, the educationalist Molly, in 1956. They divorced in April 2013 after 57 years of marriage, having been separated for five years. They had no children. In summer 2013, he married Maggie Pearlstine, his literary agent and sister of Norman Pearlstine.

Hattersley supports a British republic. He is a dedicated supporter of Sheffield Wednesday, and a member of the Reform and Garrick clubs.

<doc id="148788" wikidata="Q150494" url="?curid=148788" title="Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor">
<text>Leopold I (Leopold Ignaz Joseph Balthasar Franz Felician; ; 9 June 1640 – 5 May 1705) was Holy Roman Emperor, King of Hungary, Croatia, and Bohemia. The second son of Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor, by his first wife, Maria Anna of Spain, Leopold became heir apparent in 1654 after the death of his elder brother Ferdinand IV. Elected in 1658, Leopold ruled the Holy Roman Empire until his death in 1705, becoming the second longest-ruling emperor (46 years and 9 months) of the House of Habsburg. He was both a composer and considerable patron of music.

Leopold&#x27;s reign is known for conflicts with the Ottoman Empire in the Great Turkish War (1683–1699) and rivalry with Louis XIV, a contemporary and first cousin (on the maternal side; fourth cousin on the paternal side), in the west. After more than a decade of warfare, Leopold emerged victorious in the east thanks to the military talents of Prince Eugene of Savoy. By the Treaty of Karlowitz, Leopold recovered almost all of the Kingdom of Hungary, which had fallen under Turkish power in the years after the 1526 Battle of Mohács.

Leopold fought three wars against France: the Franco-Dutch War, the Nine Years&#x27; War, and the War of the Spanish Succession. In this last, Leopold sought to give his younger son Charles the entire Spanish inheritance, disregarding the will of the late Charles II. Leopold started a war that soon engulfed much of Europe. The early years of the war went fairly well for Austria, with victories at Schellenberg and Blenheim, but the war would drag on until 1714, nine years after Leopold&#x27;s death, which barely had an effect on the warring states. When peace returned with the Treaty of Rastatt, Austria could not be said to have emerged as triumphant as it had from the war against the Turks.

==Early years==

Born on 9 June 1640 in Vienna, Leopold received the traditional program of education in the liberal arts, history, literature, natural science and astronomy. He was particularly interested in music, as his father Emperor Ferdinand III had been. From an early age Leopold showed an inclination toward learning. He became fluent in Latin, Italian, German, and Spanish. In addition to German, Italian would be the most favored language at his court.

Likewise he had received comprehensive ecclesiastical training as he had originally been selected for a career in the higher clergy. This plan, though, was dropped upon the 1654 death of his older brother, Ferdinand IV, when Leopold became heir apparent. Nonetheless, Leopold&#x27;s spiritual education had had a manifest impact on him. Leopold remained under the spell of his clerical education and Jesuit influence throughout his life. For a monarch he was uncommonly knowledgeable about theology, metaphysics, jurisprudence and the sciences. He also retained his interest in astrology and alchemy which he had developed under Jesuit tutors. A deeply religious and devoted person, Leopold personified the &quot;pietas Austriaca&quot;, or the loyal Catholic attitude of his house. On the other hand, his piety and education may have caused in him a fatalistic strain which inclined him to reject all compromise on denominational questions, which is not always considered a positive characteristic of a ruler.

 Leopold was said to have typical Habsburg physical attributes, such as the prominent &quot;Habsburg lower jaw&quot;. Short, thin, and of sick constitution, Leopold was cold and reserved in public and socially inept. However, he is also said to have been open with close associates. Coxe described Leopold in the following manner: &quot;His gait was stately, slow and deliberate; his air pensive, his address awkward, his manner uncouth, his disposition cold and phlegmatic.&quot; Spielman argues that his long-expected career in the clergy caused Leopold to have &quot;early adopted the intense Catholic piety expected of him and the gentle manners appropriate to a merely supporting role. He grew to manhood without the military ambition that characterized most of his fellow monarchs. From the beginning, his reign was defensive and profoundly conservative.&quot;

Elected king of Hungary in 1655, he followed suit in 1656 and 1657 in Bohemia and Croatia respectively. In July 1658, more than a year after his father&#x27;s death, Leopold was elected Holy Roman Emperor at Frankfurt in opposition to the French Cardinal Mazarin, who sought to place the Imperial Crown on the head of Ferdinand Maria, Elector of Bavaria or some other non-Habsburg prince. To conciliate France, which had considerable influence in German affairs thanks to the League of the Rhine, the newly elected emperor promised not to assist Spain, then at war with France. This marked the beginning of a nearly 47-year reign characterized by a lasting rivalry with France and its king, Louis XIV. The latter&#x27;s dominant personality and power completely overshadowed Leopold, even to this day, but Leopold was no less a warrior-king given the greater part of his public life was directed towards the arrangement and furtherance of wars.

==Second Northern War==
Leopold&#x27;s first war was the Second Northern War (1655–1660), in which King Charles X of Sweden tried to become King of Poland with the aid of allies including György II Rákóczi, Prince of Transylvania. Leopold&#x27;s predecessor, Ferdinand III, had allied with King John II Casimir Vasa of Poland in 1656. In 1657, Leopold expanded this alliance to include Austrian troops (paid by Poland). These troops helped defeat the Transylvanian army, and campaigned as far as Denmark. The war ended with the Treaty of Oliwa in 1660.

==Early wars against the Ottoman Empire==
The Ottoman Empire often interfered in the affairs of Transylvania, always an unruly state, and this interference brought on a war with the Holy Roman Empire, which after some desultory operations really began in 1663. By a personal appeal to the diet at Regensburg Leopold induced the princes to send assistance for the campaign; troops were also sent by France, and in August 1664, the great Imperial general Raimondo Montecuccoli gained a notable victory at Saint Gotthard. By the Peace of Vasvár the Emperor made a twenty years&#x27; truce with the Sultan, granting more generous terms than his recent victory seemed to render necessary.

==Wars against France==

French expansion increasingly threatened the empire, especially the seizure of the strategic Duchy of Lorraine in 1670, followed by the 1672 Franco-Dutch War. By mid-June, the Dutch Republic teetered at the brink of destruction, which led Leopold to agree to an alliance with Brandenburg-Prussia and the Republic on 25 June. However, he was also facing a revolt in Hungary and viewed French conquests in the Rhineland a higher priority than helping the Dutch. His commander, Raimondo Montecuccoli, was ordered to remain on the defensive and avoid a direct conflict. Chaotic logistics made it impossible to maintain the troops and Brandenburg left the war in June 1673 under the Treaty of Vossem.

An anti-French Quadruple Alliance was formed in August, consisting of the Dutch Republic, Spain, Emperor Leopold, and the Duke of Lorraine, while in May 1674, the Imperial Diet declared it an Imperial war. The 1678 Treaty of Nijmegen is generally seen as a French victory, although the Alliance succeeded in limiting their gains.

Almost immediately after the conclusion of peace Louis renewed his aggressions on the German frontier through the &quot;Réunions&quot; policy. Engaged in a serious struggle with the Ottoman Empire, the emperor was again slow to move, and although he joined the Association League against France in 1682 he was glad to make a truce at Regensburg two years later. The whole European position was now bound up with events in England, and the tension lasted until 1688, when William III of Orange won the English crown through the Glorious Revolution and Louis invaded Germany. In May 1689, the Grand Alliance was formed, including the emperor, the kings of England, Spain and Denmark, the Elector of Brandenburg and others, and a fierce struggle against France was waged throughout almost the whole of Western Europe. In general the several campaigns were favourable to the allies, and in September 1697, England, Spain and the United Provinces made peace with France at the Treaty of Rijswijk.

Leopold refused to assent to the treaty, as he considered that his allies had somewhat neglected his interests, but in the following month he came to terms and a number of places were transferred from France to the Holy Roman Empire. The peace with France lasted for about four years and then Europe was involved in the War of the Spanish Succession. The King of Spain, Charles II, was a Habsburg by descent and was related by marriage to the Austrian branch, while a similar tie bound him to the royal house of France. He was feeble and childless, and attempts had been made by the European powers to arrange for a peaceable division of his extensive kingdom. Leopold refused to consent to any partition, and when in November 1700 Charles died, leaving his crown to Philippe, Duke of Anjou, a grandson of Louis XIV, all hopes of a peaceable settlement vanished. Under the guidance of William III a powerful league, a renewed Grand Alliance, was formed against France; of this the emperor was a prominent member, and in 1703 he transferred his claim on the Spanish monarchy to his second son, Archduke Charles. The early course of the war was not favorable to the Imperialists, but the tide of defeat had been rolled back by the great victory of Blenheim before Leopold died on 5 May 1705.

==Internal problems==
The emperor himself defined the guidelines of the politics. Johann Weikhard of Auersperg was dismissed in 1669 as the leading minister. He was followed by Wenzel Eusebius, Prince of Lobkowicz. Both had arranged some connections to France without the knowledge of the emperor. In 1674 Lobkowicz also lost his appointment.

He also expelled Jewish communities from his realm, for example the Viennese Jewish community, which used to live in an area called &quot;Im Werd&quot; across the Danube Canal. After the expulsion of the Jewish population, with popular support, the area was renamed &quot;Leopoldstadt&quot; as a thanksgiving. But Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg, issued an edict in 1677, in which he announced his special protection for 50 families of these expelled Jews.

In governing his own lands Leopold found his chief difficulties in Hungary, where unrest was caused partly by his desire to crush Protestantism and partly by the so-called Magnate conspiracy. A rising was suppressed in 1671 and for some years Hungary was treated with great severity. In 1681, after another rising, some grievances were removed and a less repressive policy was adopted, but this did not deter the Hungarians from revolting again. Austrian forces occupied the castle of Trebišov in 1675, but in 1682 Imre Thököly captured it and then fled from continuous Austrian attacks, so they blew the castle up, leaving it in ruins. They fled as supposedly Hungarian rebel troops under the command of Imre Thököly, cooperating with the Turks, and sacked the city of Bielsko in 1682. In 1692, Leopold gave up his rights to the property, giving his rights by donation to Theresia Keglević.

Espousing the cause of the rebels Sultan Mehmed IV sent an enormous army into Austria early in 1683; this advanced almost unchecked to Vienna, which was besieged from July to September, while Leopold took refuge at Passau. Realizing the gravity of the situation somewhat tardily, some of the German princes, among them the electors of Saxony and Bavaria, led their contingents to the Imperial Army, which was commanded by the emperor&#x27;s brother-in-law, Charles, Duke of Lorraine, but the most redoubtable of Leopold&#x27;s allies was the King of Poland, John III Sobieski, who was already dreaded by the Turks.

==Success against the Turks and in Hungary==
On 12 September 1683, the allied army fell upon the enemy, who was completely routed, and Vienna was saved. The Imperial forces, among whom Prince Eugene of Savoy was rapidly becoming prominent, followed up the victory with others, notably one near Mohács in 1687 and another at Zenta in 1697, and in January 1699, Sultan Mustafa II signed the Treaty of Karlowitz by which he ceded almost the whole of Hungary (including Serbs in Vojvodina) to the Habsburg monarchy. As the Habsburg forces retreated, they withdrew 37,000 Serb families under Patriarch Arsenije III Čarnojević of the Serbian Patriarchate of Peć. In 1690 and 1691 Emperor Leopold I had conceived through a number of edicts (Privileges) the autonomy of Serbs in his dominions, which would last and develop for more than two centuries until its abolition in 1912. Before the conclusion of the war, however, Leopold had taken measures to strengthen his hold upon this country. In 1687, the Diet of Hungary in Pressburg (now Bratislava) changed the constitution; the right of the Habsburgs to succeed to the throne without election was admitted and the emperor&#x27;s elder son Joseph I was crowned hereditary King of Hungary.

==The Holy Roman Empire==
The Peace of Westphalia in 1648 had been a political defeat for the Habsburgs. It ended the idea that Europe was a single Roman Catholic empire; governed spiritually by the Pope and temporally by the Holy Roman Emperor. Moreover, the treaty was devoted to parceling out land and influence to the &quot;winners&quot;, the anti-Habsburg alliance led by France and Sweden. However, the Habsburgs did gain some benefits out of the Thirty Years&#x27; War; the Protestant aristocracy in Habsburg territories had been decimated, and the ties between Vienna and the Habsburg domains in Bohemia and elsewhere were greatly strengthened. These changes would allow Leopold to initiate necessary political and institutional reforms during his reign to develop somewhat of an absolutist state along French lines. The most important consequences of the war was in retrospect to weaken the Habsburgs as emperors but strengthen them in their own lands. Leopold was the first to realize this altered state of affairs and act in accordance with it.

===Administrative reform===
The reign of Leopold saw some important changes made in the constitution of the Empire. In 1663 the Imperial Diet entered upon the last stage of its existence, and became a body permanently in session at Regensburg. This perpetual diet would become a vital tool for consolidation of Habsburg power under Leopold.

===Political changes===
In 1692, the Duke of Hanover was raised to the rank of an elector, becoming the ninth member of the electoral college. In 1700, Leopold, greatly in need of help for the impending war with France, granted the title of King in Prussia to the Elector of Brandenburg. The net result of these and similar changes was to weaken the authority of the emperor over the princes of the empire and to compel him to rely more and more upon his position as ruler of the Austrian archduchies and of Hungary and Bohemia.

==Character and overall assessment==
Leopold was a man of industry and education, and during his later years, he showed some political ability. Regarding himself as an absolute sovereign, he was extremely tenacious of his rights. Greatly influenced by the Jesuits, he was a staunch proponent of the Counter-Reformation. In person, he was short, but strong and healthy. Although he had no inclination for a military life, he loved outdoors exercise, such as hunting and riding. He also had a taste and talent for music and
composed several Oratorios and Suites of Dances.

Perhaps due to inbreeding among his progenitors, the hereditary Habsburg jaw was most prominent in Leopold. Because his jaw was depicted unusually large on a 1670 silver coin, Leopold was nicknamed &quot;the Hogmouth&quot;; however, most collectors do not believe the coin was an accurate depiction.

==Marriages and children==


On 12 December 1666, he married Margaret Theresa of Spain (1651–1673), daughter of King Philip IV of Spain, who was both his niece and his first cousin. She was depicted in Diego Velázquez&#x27; paintings sent from the court of Madrid to Leopold as he waited in Vienna for his fiancée to grow up. Leopold and Margaret Theresa had four children, all but one short-lived:

# Archduke Ferdinand Wenzel (1667–1668)
# Archduchess Maria Antonia (1669–1692), who married Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria
# Archduke Johann Leopold (1670)
# Archduchess Maria Anna Antonia (1672)

His second wife was Claudia Felicitas of Austria, who died in 1676 at the age of 22. Neither of their two daughters survived:

# Archduchess Anna Maria Josepha (1674)
# Archduchess Maria Josepha Clementina (1675–1676)

His third wife was Eleonor Magdalene of Neuburg. They had ten children:

# Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor (1678–1711), who married Wilhelmine Amalia of Brunswick-Lüneburg
# Archduchess Maria Christina (1679)
# Archduchess Maria Elisabeth (1680–1741), Governor of the Austrian Netherlands
# Archduke Leopold Joseph (1682–1684)
# Archduchess Maria Anna (1683–1754) married John V of Portugal
# Archduchess Maria Theresa (1684–1696)
# Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor (1685–1740), who married Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel and was the father of Maria Theresa
# Archduchess Maria Josepha (1687–1703)
# Archduchess Maria Magdalena (1689–1743)
# Archduchess Maria Margaret (1690–1691)

==Music==
Like his father, Leopold was a patron of music and a composer himself. He continued to enrich the court&#x27;s musical life by employing and providing support for distinguished composers such as Antonio Bertali, Giovanni Bononcini, Johann Kaspar Kerll, Ferdinand Tobias Richter, Alessandro Poglietti, and Johann Fux. Leopold&#x27;s surviving works show the influence of Bertali and Viennese composers in general (in oratorios and other dramatic works), and of Johann Heinrich Schmelzer (in ballets and German comedies). His sacred music is perhaps his most successful, particularly &quot;Missa angeli custodis&quot;, a Requiem Mass for his first wife, and &quot;Three Lections&quot;, composed for the burial of his second wife. Much of Leopold&#x27;s music was published with works by his father, and described as &quot;works of exceeding high merit.&quot;

==Titles==
The full titulature of Leopold after he had become emperor went as follows: &quot;Leopold I, by the grace of God elected Holy Roman Emperor, forever August, King of Germany, King of Hungary, King of Bohemia, Dalmatia, Croatia, Slavonia, Rama, Serbia, Galicia, Lodomeria, Cumania, Bulgaria, Archduke of Austria, Duke of Burgundy, Brabant, Styria, Carinthia, Carniola, Margrave of Moravia, Duke of Luxemburg, of the Upper and Lower Silesia, of Württemberg and Teck, Prince of Swabia, Count of Habsburg, Tyrol, Kyburg and Gorizia, Landgrave of Alsace, Marquess of the Holy Roman Empire, Burgovia, the Enns, the Upper and Lower Lusatia, Lord of the Marquisate of Slavonia, of Port Naon and Salines, etc. etc.&quot;

<text>Marcus Annius Florianus (died 276), also known as Florian, was Roman emperor from the death of his half-brother, Emperor Tacitus, in July 276 until his own murder in September of that year.

Florianus was the maternal half-brother of Tacitus, who was proclaimed emperor in late 275 after the unexpected death of Emperor Aurelian. After Tacitus died the following year, allegedly assassinated as a consequence of a military plot, Florianus proclaimed himself emperor, with the recognition of the Roman Senate and much of the empire. However, the new emperor soon had to deal with the revolt of Probus, who rose up shortly after Florianus ascended the throne, with the backing of the provinces of Egypt, Syria, Palestine, and Phoenicia. Probus took advantage of the terrain of the Cilician Gates, and the hot climate of the area, to which Florianus&#x27; army was unaccustomed, to chip away at their morale. Florianus&#x27; army rose up against him and killed him.

==History==

In late 275, Florianus&#x27; maternal half-brother, Tacitus, was proclaimed Roman Emperor after the unexpected death of Emperor Aurelian. Soon after, Tacitus appointed Florianus as praetorian prefect. Tacitus then ordered Florianus to lead troops to Pannonia, in order to repel raids into Roman territory by the Goths. After Tacitus died suddenly in July 276, allegedly as a consequence of a military plot, Florianus swiftly proclaimed himself emperor, and was recognized as such by the Roman Senate and the western provinces. Florianus then continued to campaign against the Goths, winning a major victory before the news reached him of the revolt of Probus, who had served successfully as a commander under both Aurelian and Tacitus. Probus&#x27; revolt was supported by the provinces of Egypt, Syria, Palestine, and Phoenicia.

Probus took advantage of his control of Egyptian grain, which he used to swiftly cut off the supply of grain to the rest of the empire. He led his troops to Asia Minor, in order to defend the Cilician Gates, allowing him to utilize guerrilla tactics to wage a war of attrition rather than a straightforward confrontation. Florianus led his troops to Cilicia, and billeted his forces in Tarsus. However, many of his troops, who were unaccustomed to the hot climate of the area, fell ill due to a summer heat wave. Upon learning of this, Probus launched raids around the city, in order to weaken the morale of Florianus&#x27; forces. This strategy was successful, and Florianus lost control of his army, which rose up against him and killed him. Florianus&#x27; reign lasted less than three months, 88 days according to the Chronograph of 354 and 80 days according to Eutropius.

<doc id="148790" wikidata="Q2307002" url="?curid=148790" title="In My Head (album)">
<text>In My Head is the sixth studio album by American punk band Black Flag. It was released in 1985 on SST Records, and was their final studio album before their breakup in 1986. The CD reissue adds three of the four songs that later appeared on the &quot;I Can See You&quot; EP, replicating the original 1985 cassette release which came out concurrent to the LP.

After building a reputation for confrontational hardcore punk, late-era Black Flag turned to a more experimental, -inflected sound, in particular on their last two albums. Greg Ginn intended &quot;In My Head&quot; to be his first solo album. The cover is a collage of six drawings by Ginn&#x27;s brother Raymond Pettibon which SST cut up and used without paying him and without his permission, resulting in Raymond cutting ties with the label.

==Reception==

The album received very positive reviews upon release. Robert Palmer, writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, found the music to be &quot;intriguingly, sometimes dazzlingly fresh and sophisticated, but the band hasn&#x27;t had to sacrifice an iota of the raw intensity and directness that are punk&#x27;s spiritual center.&quot; He compared the &quot;polyphony of shifting shapes that is the principal guitar motif in the brilliant &#x27;White Hot to &quot;listening to the once-revolutionary guitar break from the Yardbirds&#x27; mid-60&#x27;s hit &#x27;Shapes of Things&#x27; while one&#x27;s turntable goes up in flames.&quot; &quot;Yet for all its sophistication,&quot; he continued, &quot;this is jagged, abrasive rock and roll, music hard and direct enough to appeal to any punk or hard-rock fan. [...] &#x27;In My Head&#x27; is the sound of heavy metal rock as it could be but almost never is, metal without the posturing, the pointless displays of fretboard prowess, the bashing rhythm sections and banal lyrics that have become endemic to the idiom.&quot; It also notably received a full score from the English music magazine &quot;Sounds&quot;, which found it to be even better than the band&#x27;s debut.

Retrospective reviews have also been largely positive. &quot;Punknews&quot; found the album to be more innovative &amp; better produced than its predecessors, while John Dougan of AllMusic called it &quot;some of the best contemporary rock music extant.&quot; &quot;Louder Sound&quot; called it &quot;one of the group&#x27;s finest albums, with [its] foreboding title track its most gloriously tortured moment. [...] Healthy people don&#x27;t make music like this, and indeed, soon after its release Black Flag were done.&quot; &quot;Early Black Flag releases like &quot;Nervous Breakdown, Damaged&quot;, and &quot;My War&quot; spawned tons of imitators,&quot; wrote &quot;BrooklynVegan&quot;, &quot;and there&#x27;s no way to overstate how influential they are, but &quot;In My Head&quot; has something else going for it. Over three decades later, you rarely hear other music that sounds like this.&quot;

<text>Philip IV (, ; 8 April 160517 September 1665), also called the Planet King (Spanish: &quot;Rey Planeta&quot;), was King of Spain from 1621 to his death and (as Philip III) King of Portugal from 1621 to 1640. Philip is remembered for his patronage of the arts, including such artists as Diego Velázquez, and his rule over Spain during the Thirty Years&#x27; War.

By the time of his death, the Spanish Empire had reached approximately 12.2 million square kilometres (4.7 million square miles) in area but in other aspects was in decline, a process to which Philip contributed with his inability to achieve successful domestic and military reform. He was succeeded on his death by his young son Charles II as King of Spain and in 1640 (with the collapse of the Iberian Union) by John IV as King of Portugal.

==Personal life==
Philip IV was born in the Royal Palace of Valladolid, and was the eldest son of Philip III and his wife, Margaret of Austria. In 1615, at the age of 10, Philip was married to 13-year-old Elisabeth of France. Although the relationship does not appear to have been close, some have suggested that Gaspar de Guzmán, Count-Duke of Olivares, his key minister, later deliberately tried to keep the two apart to maintain his influence, encouraging Philip to take mistresses instead, by whom he is known to have had at least 30 progeny. 

Philip had ten children with Elisabeth, with only one being a son, Balthasar Charles, who died at the age of sixteen in 1646. The death of his son deeply shocked the King, who appears to have been a good father by the standards of the day. Elisabeth was able to conspire with other Spanish nobles to remove Olivares from the court in 1643, and for a brief period she held considerable influence over Philip; by the time of her death, however, she was out of favour, following manoeuvering by Olivares&#x27; successor and nephew, Luis de Haro.

Aged 44 in 1649, Philip remarried, following the deaths of both Elisabeth and his only son. His choice of his second wife, 14-year-old Maria Anna, also known as Mariana, Philip&#x27;s niece and the daughter of Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor, was guided by politics and Philip&#x27;s desire to strengthen the relationship with Habsburg Austria. They were married on 7 October 1649. Maria Anna bore him five children, but only two survived to adulthood, a daughter Margarita Teresa, born in 1651, and the future Charles II of Spain in 1661 – but the latter was sickly and considered in frequent danger of dying, making the line of inheritance potentially uncertain.

Perceptions of Philip&#x27;s personality have altered considerably over time. Victorian authors were inclined to portray him as a weak individual, delegating excessively to his ministers, and ruling over a debauched Baroque court. Victorian historians even attributed the early death of Balthasar to debauchery, encouraged by the gentlemen entrusted by the King with his education. The doctors who treated the Prince at that time in fact diagnosed smallpox, although modern scholars attribute his death to appendicitis. Historians&#x27; estimation of Philip gradually improved in the 20th century, with comparisons between Philip and his father being increasingly positive – some noting that he possessed much more energy, both mental and physical, than his diffident father.

Philip was idealized by his contemporaries as the model of Baroque kingship. Outwardly he maintained a bearing of rigid solemnity; foreign visitors described him as being so impassive in public he resembled a statue, and he was said to have been seen to laugh only three times in the course of his entire public life. Philip certainly had a strong sense of his &#x27;royal dignity&#x27;, but was also extensively coached by Olivares in how to resemble the Baroque model of a sovereign, which would form a key political tool for Philip throughout his reign. Philip was a fine horseman, a keen hunter and a devotee of bull-fighting, all central parts of royal public life at court during the period.

Privately, Philip appears to have had a lighter persona. When he was younger, he was said to have a keen sense of humor and a &#x27;great sense of fun&#x27;. He privately attended &#x27;academies&#x27; in Madrid throughout his reign – these were lighthearted literary salons, aiming to analyze contemporary literature and poetry with a humorous touch. A keen theatre-goer, he was sometimes criticized by contemporaries for his love of these &#x27;frivolous&#x27; entertainments. Others have captured his private personality as &#x27;naturally kind, gentle and affable&#x27;. Those close to him claimed he was academically competent, with a good grasp of Latin and geography, and could speak French, Portuguese and Italian well. Like many of his contemporaries, including Olivares, he had a keen interest in astrology. His handwritten translation of Francesco Guicciardini&#x27;s texts on political history still exist.

Although interpretations of Philip&#x27;s role in government have improved in recent years, Diego Velázquez&#x27;s contemporary description of Philip&#x27;s key weakness – that &#x27;he mistrusts himself, and defers to others too much&#x27; — remains relevant. Although Philip&#x27;s Catholic beliefs no longer attract criticism from English language writers, Philip is still felt to have been &#x27;unduly pious&#x27; in his personal life. Notably, from the 1640s onwards he sought the advice and counsel of a noted cloistered abbess, Sor María de Ágreda, exchanging many letters with her. This did not stop Philip for becoming known for his numerous affairs, particularly with actresses, as encouraged by the Count-Duke Olivares. The most famous of these affairs was with the actress María Calderón (La Calderona), with whom he had a son in 1629, Juan José, who was brought up as a royal prince. By the end of the reign, and with the health of Carlos, Prince of Asturias in doubt, there was a real possibility of Juan José&#x27;s claiming the throne, which added to the instability of the regency years.

==Philip, Olivares and his royal favorites==
During the reign of Philip&#x27;s father, Philip III, the royal court had been dominated by the Sandoval noble family, most strikingly by Francisco de Sandoval y Rojas, 1st Duke of Lerma, Philip III&#x27;s principal favourite and chief minister for almost all of his reign. Philip IV came to power as the influence of the Sandovals was being undermined by a new noble coalition, led by Don Baltasar de Zúñiga. De Zúñiga regarded it as essential that the Sandovals be unable to gain an influence over the future king; de Zúñiga first began to develop his own influence over Prince Philip, and then introduced his nephew, Olivares, to the prince, ten years old at the time. 

At first, Philip did not particularly take to Olivares. Over the course of at least a year, however, the relationship became very close, with Philip&#x27;s tendency towards underconfidence and diffidence counteracted by Olivares&#x27; drive and determination. Olivares rapidly became Philip&#x27;s most trusted advisor, and when Philip ascended the throne in 1621, at the age of sixteen, he showed his confidence in Olivares by ordering that all papers requiring the royal signature should first be sent to the count-duke. Philip retained Olivares as his confidant and chief minister for the next twenty years.

Early in his reign, Philip would be woken by Olivares in the morning to discuss the day&#x27;s affairs and would meet with him twice more during the day, although later this routine declined until the King would hold only one short meeting on policy with Olivares each day. Philip intervened far more in policies during 1641–1642, however, and it has been suggested that Philip paid more attention to policy making than has traditionally been depicted; some recent histories go so far as to describe him as &#x27;conscientious&#x27; in policy making, although he is still criticized for his failure to make timely decisions. 

Philip himself argued that it was hardly appropriate for the King himself to go house to house amongst his ministers to see if his instructions were being carried out. The close relationship between Philip and Olivares was demonstrated by their portraits&#x27; being placed side by side at the Buen Retiro Palace — an act unheard of in Europe at the time. Philip&#x27;s relationship with Olivares, however, was not a simplistic one. The pair had many rows and arguments over the course of their relationship, both as a result of their different personalities and differences of opinion over policies.

Initially, Philip chose to confirm the reappointment of his father&#x27;s household to assuage grandee opinion. Under the influence of de Zúñiga and Olivares, however, Philip was then quick to place Lerma&#x27;s estates – expanded considerably during his long period as favorite – under administration, and to remove from office Cristóbal de Sandoval, Duke of Uceda, Lerma&#x27;s son, who had initially helped de Zúñiga remove his own father from office to advance his own position. Philip&#x27;s initial announcements reflected an intent to reform the monarchy to the sober, moral position it had been under his grandfather, including selecting ministers whose grandfathers had served under Philip II.

Philip has in the past been considered to be &#x27;unimaginative&#x27; in his politics, but recent histories have stressed the more radical elements of his first two decades in power. There was a febrile atmosphere in Spain in the early 17th century, with numerous &quot;arbitrista&quot; offering various advice on how to solve Spain&#x27;s various ills; this advice could, and would, be given in person by those of the lower classes to the King on suitable occasions, provided it was presented with the aim of strengthening the crown. 

Those debates extended to the nature of the monarchy. It has been suggested that the writers of the period who best captured Philip&#x27;s view of royal authority were Justus Lipsius and Giovanni Botero, who promoted religiously inspired, stoic self-sacrifice and a view of Habsburg family-led hegemony respectively. Whilst at one level conservative – harking back in foreign policy to the period of Philip II, invoking traditional values at home – Philip&#x27;s policies were also radical, rejecting the policy towards the rebellious Dutch that had held since 1609, entering into the Thirty Years&#x27; War, and introducing a system of &quot;junta&quot;, or small committee, government across Spain in competition to the traditional Polysynodial System of royal councils.

Following Olivares&#x27; fall from power amidst the crisis of 1640–1643, the victim of failed policies and jealousy from the nobles excluded from power, Philip initially announced that he would rule alone, becoming in effect his own first minister. The &quot;junta&quot; system of government began to be dismantled in favour of the older council system. In due course, this personal rule reverted to rule through a royal favourite, initially Luis de Haro, a nephew of Olivares and a childhood playmate of Philip&#x27;s, and the counter-reform of the committee system halted. De Haro has not been highly regarded by historians; the comment of one, that de Haro was the &#x27;embodiment of mediocrity&#x27;, is not atypical. After de Haro&#x27;s death in 1661, Olivares&#x27; son-in-law, Ramiro Núñez de Guzmán, became a royal favourite in his place.

==Foreign policy and the Thirty Years&#x27; War==
Philip was to reign through the majority of the Thirty Years&#x27; War in Europe, a turbulent period of military history. In Philip III&#x27;s final years, Baltasar de Zúñiga had convinced him to intervene militarily in Bohemia and the Electoral Palatinate on the side of Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor. Once Philip himself came to power, he was convinced by de Zúñiga, appointed his principal foreign minister, and Olivares that he should commit Spain to a more aggressive foreign policy in alliance with the Holy Roman Empire. This lead Philip to renew hostilities with the Dutch in 1621 in an attempt to bring the provinces to the negotiating table with the aim of achieving a peace treaty favourable to Spanish global interests. Philip&#x27;s government pursued a &#x27;Netherlands first&#x27; strategy throughout the war until 1643. Despite this shift in policy, Philip does not seem to have been particularly bellicose; early on he noted that having inherited such a large empire, war somewhere across his domains was an inevitable condition, and he appeared genuinely upset when he came to power and contemplated how much the people of Castile had paid &#x27;in blood&#x27; to support the wars of his royal predecessors.

The 1620s were good years for Spanish foreign policy: the war with the Dutch went well, albeit at great expense, culminating in the retaking of the key city of Breda in 1624. By the end of the decade, Philip&#x27;s government was faced with the question of whether to prioritise the war in Flanders or Spain&#x27;s relationship with France during the War of the Mantuan Succession (1628–1631). Philip&#x27;s advisors recommended prioritising the war in Flanders, taking action to safeguard the Spanish Road to the Netherlands but at the cost of antagonising Louis XIII. Strategically this was to prove a disaster. Despite fresh Spanish successes in the mid-1630s – in particular, the triumph of Philip&#x27;s government in raising a fresh Spanish army, marching it into Germany to defeat the Swedish-led Protestant forces at the Battle of Nördlingen (1634) – the increased tensions with France made war between the two Catholic states increasingly inevitable. Olivares advised Philip that the coming war with France would be all or nothing; Spain would win or fall by the result.
The Spanish-French war that ensued from 1635 onwards was not a foregone conclusion. Early Spanish successes threatened Paris, and even after the Spanish defeat at Rocroi, Spain remained a strong opponent. But from 1640 onwards, a period which saw large-scale revolts across Spanish territories in protest against the rising costs of the conflict, Spain was finding it difficult to sustain the war. Philip reacted to the increased French threat by finally abandoning his &#x27;Netherlands first&#x27; strategy; resources for the Army of Flanders were savagely cut, and the fight against the French-supported rebels in Catalonia took the first priority. 

Shortly after Rocroi, Philip – now having had to dismiss his favourite, Olivares – issued instructions to his ambassadors to seek a peace treaty. The Peace of Westphalia, delivered by Olivares&#x27; replacement Luis de Haro, resolved the long-running Eighty Years&#x27; War in the Netherlands and the wars in Germany, but the conflict with France dragged on. Philip responded to the perceived weakness of France during the Fronde rebellions of 1648 by continuing the fight; he took personal responsibility for the decision to start a fresh, and ultimately successful, offensive against the French in Catalonia in 1651. 

True victory over France never emerged, however, and by 1658, after the loss of Dunkirk to an Anglo-French force, Philip was personally desperate for peace. The Treaty of the Pyrenees in 1659, and the marriage of Philip&#x27;s daughter Maria Theresa to the young King Louis XIV finally brought the war with France to a conclusion. The war against Portugal continued, however, as Philip fruitlessly attempted to regain control over his lost kingdom.

==Philip and the Spanish military==
Philip and Olivares attempted to address the perceived issues of the army, which they concluded were primarily due to the &quot;falta de cabezas&quot;, or a lack of leadership. In keeping with their wider agenda of renewing the concepts of duty, service and aristocratic tradition, the King agreed to efforts to introduce more grandees into the higher ranks of the military, working hard to overcome the reluctance of many to take up field appointments in the Netherlands and elsewhere.

The results were not entirely as hoped. The grandees dragooned into service in this way were disinclined to spend years learning the normal professional military skill set; they wished &#x27;to start out as generals and soldiers on the same day&#x27;, to quote one disgruntled career soldier. By the 1630s, the King was waiving the usual rules to enable promotion to higher ranks on a shorter timescale, and having to pay significantly inflated salaries to get grandees to take up even these appointments. The performance of these officers at battles such as Rocroi left much to be desired.

In 1640, Philip IV&#x27;s initial strategy to undermine the new Portuguese government involved dividing the extensive border shared between Portugal and Castile into military districts. Each district would be overseen by the highest-ranking nobleman on the Castilian side. For example, the 9th Duke of Medina Sidonia was tasked with managing the Algarve district from his headquarters in Ayamonte. The Ayamonte junta consisted of six members, and Don Matías González de Medrano, the king&#x27;s secretary in the Council of War, acted as the junta&#x27;s secretary.

=== Spanish Navy ===

Philip was also notable for his interest in the Spanish Navy. Shortly after taking power, he began to increase the size of his fleets, rapidly doubling the size of the naval budget from the start of his reign, and then tripling it. Philip is credited with a &#x27;sensible, pragmatic approach&#x27; to provisioning and controlling it. He was prepared to involve himself in considerable details of naval policy; he was commenting on the detail of provisions for the &quot;armada&quot; in 1630, for example. The &quot;Junta de Armadas&quot; was the only &quot;junta&quot; committee to survive the fall of Olivares intact. Even after the disastrous Battle of the Downs, Philip remained closely interested in his navy, including ensuring ministerial attention. In 1646, de Haro was personally involved in supplying and equipping the Atlantic fleet from Cádiz. Throughout the period there was no &#x27;weakening of the importance attached to naval forces&#x27; by the King, who argued that joint land and naval operations were essential. Some of his conclusions on naval policy were quite advanced: after the peace of 1648, Philip argued that the Dutch fleets off the Spanish peninsula were actually good for trade, despite concerns from his senior officials, since they provided protection against the English and French navies.

==Domestic policy and the crisis of the monarchy==
Philip had inherited a huge empire from his father, spanning the known world, but many of his most difficult challenges as king would stem from domestic problems in Spain itself. Spain in the early 17th century was a collection of possessions – the kingdoms of Castile, Aragon, and Portugal, the autonomous provinces of Valencia Catalonia and Andalusia, complete with the wider provinces of Naples, the Netherlands, Milan etc. – all loosely joined together through the institution of the Castile monarchy and the person of Philip IV. Each part had different taxation, privileges and military arrangements; in practice, the level of taxation in many of the more peripheral provinces was less than that in Castile, but the privileged position of the Castilian nobility at all senior levels of royal appointment was a contentious issue for the less favoured provinces. This loose system had successfully resisted reform and higher taxation before, ironically resulting in Spain&#x27;s having had historically, up until the 1640s at least, fewer than the usual number of fiscal revolts for an early modern European state.

In the first years of his reign, heavily influenced by his royal favourite Olivares, Philip focused on efforts to reform the most chaotic aspects of this system. Frustrated by the notorious slowness of the system of royal councils, Philip supported Olivares&#x27; establishment of &quot;juntas&quot; – small committees designed to circumvent the more formal system and to enact policies quickly. Although successful, these &quot;juntas&quot; excluded many of the traditional grandees and caused resentment. 

Olivares put forward the idea of a &quot;Unión de Armas&quot;, or &#x27;Union of Arms&#x27;. This would have involved establishing a force of 140,000 paid soldiers, supported by equitable taxes from across the Empire, and has been termed &#x27;the most far-sighted proposal of any statesman of the age&#x27;. In practice, it met fierce opposition from the various regional assemblies and the plan was withdrawn. During the 1620s, again influenced by a desire to reform Spanish life for the better, Philip also passed considerable legislation with puritanical overtones. In 1623, he closed all the legal brothels in Spain, extended the dormant sumptuary laws on luxury goods and supported Papal efforts to regulate priests&#x27; sexual behaviour more tightly.

Philip had clear intentions to try to control the Spanish currency, which had become increasingly unstable during the reign of his father and grandfather, but in practice, inflation soared. Partly this was because in 1627 Olivares had attempted to deal with the problem of Philip&#x27;s Genoese bankers – who had proved uncooperative in recent years – by declaring a state bankruptcy. With the Genoese debt now removed, Olivares hoped to turn to indigenous bankers for renewed funds. In practice, the plan was a disaster. The Spanish treasure fleet of 1628 was captured by the Dutch, and Spain&#x27;s ability to borrow and transfer money across Europe declined sharply.

By the 1630s, Philip&#x27;s domestic policies were being increasingly impacted by the financial pressures of the Thirty Years&#x27; War, and in particular the growing war with France. The costs of the war were huge, and whilst they had largely fallen upon Castile, the ability of the crown to raise more funds and men from this source was increasingly limited. Philip and his government were desperately trying to reduce the responsibilities of the central government in response to the overstretch of the war, and various reform ideas that might have been pursued during the 1620s were rejected on this basis. Financial restraints and higher taxes were put in place, but Philip was increasingly selling off regalian and feudal rights, along with much of the royal estate to fund the conflict. It has been argued that the fiscal stringencies of the 1630s, combined with the strength and role of Olivares and the &quot;juntas&quot;, effectively cut Philip off from the three traditional pillars of support for the monarchy: the grandees, the Church and the Council of Castile.
A crisis came in 1640. An attempt by Olivares to intervene in Catalonia to deal with the French invasion threat resulted in revolt and the years long Reapers&#x27; War. An alliance of Catalan rebels and French royal forces proved challenging to suppress, and in trying to mobilise Portuguese noble support for the war, Olivares triggered a second uprising. Lisbon&#x27;s nobles expelled Philip, and gave the throne to the House of Braganza, marking the end of sixty years of the Iberian Union and the beginning of the Portuguese Restoration War. He was succeeded in Portugal in 1640 by John IV. 

In 1641, Gaspar Alfonso Pérez de Guzmán, 9th Duke of Medina Sidonia attempted another rebellion against Philip from Andalusia, possibly attempting to reproduce the Braganzas&#x27; success in Portugal. Although Philip and Olivares were able to repress the ducal revolt, Philip had found himself increasingly isolated. On his return from Zaragoza, where he had been commanding the army, he found only one of the Castilian nobility arrived at court on Easter Day 1641. The threat of Philip&#x27;s being deposed by the grandees of Castile seemed increasingly real.

Much shaken by events, Philip&#x27;s solution was to remove his royal favourite Olivares from office in 1643 in an attempt to compromise with the Spanish elite. He announced he would rule alone, rejecting both the concept of a royal favourite as first minister and the system of &quot;junta&quot; government, which he began to dismantle in favour of the older system of royal councils. Clemency was shown to the Duke of Medina Sidonia. The situation began to stabilise, and before long Philip felt secure enough to revert to his preferred method of government. Luis de Haro, Olivares&#x27; nephew, took over as favourite and minister and the counter-reform of the &quot;juntas&quot; halted. The spark of reform from Philip&#x27;s earlier years never returned, however. The Catalan rebellion dragged on for several years. In 1652, the Spanish army retook Barcelona and Philip issued an amnesty for the rebels, promising to respect traditional customs and rights in the future.

==Patronage of the arts==
Philip has been remembered both for the &#x27;astonishing enthusiasm&#x27; with which he collected art and for his love of theatre. On the stage, he favoured Lope de Vega, Pedro Calderón de la Barca, and other distinguished dramatists. Philip has been credited with a share in the composition of several comedies. Court theatre used perspective scenery, a new invention from Italy not used in commercial theatre at the time. Some writers have likened the illusion of Baroque royal theatre to the illusion of kingly power the performances were designed to reinforce. Some recent scholarship has suggested that Philip&#x27;s financial sponsorship of playwrights, however, may have been less extensive than once thought.

Artistically, Philip became famous for his patronage of his court painter Diego Velázquez, who originated from Seville; mutual contacts caused him to become known to Olivares, who came from the same region. Velázquez was summoned to Madrid by the King in 1624. Despite some jealousy from the existing court painters, Velázquez rapidly became a success with Philip, being retained for the rest of his career until his death, painting a celebration of the Treaty of the Pyrenees for Philip. The King and Velázquez shared common interests in horses, dogs and art, and in private they formed an easy, relaxed relationship over the years. Philip supported a number of other prominent painters, including Eugenio Caxés, Vincenzo Carducci, Gonzales Coques and Angelo Nardi. Philip obtained paintings from across Europe, especially Italy, accumulating over 4,000 by the time of his death; some have termed this unparalleled assemblage a &#x27;mega-collection&#x27;.

Philip was nicknamed &quot;el Rey Planeta&quot;, the &#x27;Planet King&#x27;, by his contemporaries, and much of the art and display at his court has been interpreted in the context of his need to project power and authority, over both Spaniards and foreigners alike. Older interpretations, which perceived Philip&#x27;s court as being completely decadent, have been largely superseded, but the art and symbolism of the period certainly did not reflect the wider threat and decline of Spanish power. Indeed, the limited Spanish military successes of the period were celebrated by royal artists to a disproportionate extent. Numerous artists from the Spanish Netherlands produced work extolling the Army of Flanders, including Sebastian Vrancx, Peter Snayers, Jan Miense Molenaer and Willem Hondius. The re-capture of Breda alone resulted in major works by Velázquez and the French etcher Jacques Callot, in addition to various plays and books.

The &#x27;Planet King&#x27; also invested in a new palace to display both his art and the ritual of court. Through Olivares, Philip commenced the building of the &quot;Buen Retiro Palace&quot; in Madrid, parts of which still remain near the Prado. Work began modestly in 1631, with the magnificent, if costly, &#x27;Hall of Thrones&#x27;, completed by 1635. The palace included its own &#x27;theatre, ballroom, galleries, bull ring, gardens, and artificial lakes&#x27;, and became the centre for artists and dramatists from across Europe. The palace was built during one of the more difficult periods of Philip&#x27;s reign. Given both its cost, in a time of stringent wartime savings, and the protest that ensued from a disgruntled public, it is considered to have been an important part of the attempt to communicate royal grandeur and authority.

==Philip and religion==
The Catholic religion and its rituals played an important part in Philip&#x27;s life, especially towards the end of his reign. Depressed by events across his domains, he became increasingly concerned with religious affairs. In particular, Philip paid special devotion to a painting of the &quot;Nuestra Señora del Milagro&quot;, the Virgin of Miracles; the painting was said to miraculously raise and lower its eyes in response to prayer. Whilst married to Elisabeth, Philip had placed their children under the protection of this image; married to Mariana, they undertook special religious ceremonies together under the gaze of the painting. Philip also had a large standard made with the image of the painting on one side and the royal coat of arms on the other, brought out in processions each year on 12 July. As well as marking a strong personal religious belief, this increasingly visible link between the crown, the Church and national symbols such as the Virgin of Miracles, represented a key pillar of support for Philip as king.

Monarchs during the period also had a key role in the canonization process and could utilise this for domestic or international political effect. Philip, for example, keen to reach out to his Portuguese subjects, put his considerable influence behind the case for Isabella of Portugal, a 14th-century role model of a &#x27;perfect queen&#x27;, to great effect, ultimately paying for a lavish celebration in Lisbon after her canonisation in 1625. Internationally, it was important for Spanish prestige for her to receive at least a proportionate and ideally greater, share of new saints than other Catholic kingdoms, and Philip sponsored a flurry of texts and books supporting Spain&#x27;s candidates, particularly in competition with Catholic France.

During the emergency of 1640–1643, Philip appears to have had a crisis of faith. Philip genuinely believed the success or failure of his policies represented God&#x27;s favour and judgement on his actions. The combination of the revolts, the French advances and the loss of his trusted favourite Olivares appears to have deeply shaken him. Queen Isabella and the new president of the Council of Castile, Don Juan Chumacero – both involved in the removal of Olivares – encouraged the King to invite mystics and visionaries from across Europe to his court at Zaragoza. The mystics&#x27; principal advice centred on the importance of the King rejecting Olivares&#x27; replacement, de Haro and the remaining pro-Olivares nobles at court. The various mystics were not acceptable to broader Spanish noble opinion and, with de Haro&#x27;s encouragement, they were ultimately dismissed.

Instead, Philip turned to a better-established female mystic, Sister María de Ágreda, a prioress known for her religious writings. He asked her to correspond with him and to advise him in spiritual matters. The two became regular correspondents throughout the remainder of their lives. This is documented in over 600 confidential letters between them over a period of twenty-two years. Philip clearly believed that Maria could intercede with God on his behalf and provide advice on what God wished him to do, to improve Spain&#x27;s failing fortunes. Most believe that Philip was involved in protecting Maria from the Inquisition&#x27;s investigation of 1650. Philip&#x27;s son, Charles II, also protected her writings from later censorship.

==Titles and style==
In the Treaty of Madrid (1630), Philip was styled &quot;Philip, by the grace of God king of the Spains, Both the Sicilies, Jerusalem, the Indies, etc., archduke of Austria, duke of Burgundy, Milan, etc., count of Habsburg, Tyrol, etc.&quot; in full and &quot;the Most Serene Philip IV, Catholic King of the Spains,&quot; for short.

In the Treaty of Münster (1648), he was styled &quot;Don Philip the Fourth, by the grace of God king of Castile, Leon, Aragon, the Two Sicilies, Jerusalem, Navarre, Granada, Toledo, Valencia, Galicia, Majorca, Minorca, Seville, Sardinia, Cordoba, Corsica, Murcia, Jaen, Algeciras, Gibraltar, the Canary Islands, the Eastern and Western Indies, the islands and &quot;terra firma&quot; of the Ocean, archduke of Austria, duke of Burgundy, Brabant, Milan, count of Habsburg, Flanders, Tyrol, Barcelona, lord of Biscay and Molina, etc.&quot; in full and &quot;King of the Spains, Don Philip the Fourth and King of Portugal and the Algarves Don Philip the Third &quot;, for short.

After the Great Potosí Mint Fraud of 1649, between 1651 and 1652, the mint of Pamplona issued coins with the text (&quot;Philip king of Castile and Navarre by the grace of God&quot;).
The Cortes of Navarre protested this offence to the charter of Navarre.
The king then compensated in 1652 with a short issue of coins with the text (&quot;Philip the Sixth king of Navarre by the grace of God&quot;).

==Legacy==


Philip IV&#x27;s reign, after a few years of inconclusive successes, was characterized by political and military adversity. He has been held responsible for the decline of Spain, which was mainly due to organic causes largely beyond the control of any one ruler. Philip IV died in 1665, expressing the pious hope that his surviving son, Charles II, who was only 4 years old at the time, would be more fortunate than himself. On his death, a catafalque was built in Rome to commemorate his life. In his will, Philip left political power as regent on behalf of the young Charles II to his wife Mariana, with instructions that she heed the advice of a small &quot;junta&quot; committee established for this purpose. This committee excluded John Joseph, Philip&#x27;s illegitimate son, resulting in a chaotic power play between Mariana and John Joseph until his death in 1679.

<text>Christine Renea Salters (previously Martin; born June 12, 1968), nicknamed &quot;The Coal Miner&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, is an American former professional boxer, boxing analyst and motivational speaker. Competing from 1989 to 2012, she held the WBC female super welterweight title in 2009. Martin was the first female boxer elected to the Nevada Boxing Hall of Fame in 2016, and was also elected to the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 2020, which was the first year that women were on the ballot.

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
Martin was born Christy Renea Salters on June 12, 1968, in Mullens, West Virginia. and attended Mullens High School.

She played various sports as a child including Little League baseball and all-state basketball. According to Martin, she was aware she was a lesbian from &quot;5th or 6th grade.&quot; She was in a relationship with her basketball teammate Sherry Lusk throughout high school, of which her parents disapproved. She attended Concord College in Athens, West Virginia, on a basketball scholarship and earned a B.S. in education.

In her memoir &quot;Fighting for Survival&quot;, Martin states she was sexually abused as a child by a family friend.

=== Career ===
Throughout her career, Martin was nicknamed &quot;The Coal Miner&#x27;s Daughter&quot; in reference to her father&#x27;s occupation.

Martin is said to be “the most successful and prominent female boxer in the United States” and the person who “legitimized” women’s participation in the sport of boxing. She began her career fighting in “Toughwoman” contests and won three consecutive titles. She then began training with boxing coach, Jim Martin, who became her husband in 1991.

Martin started her professional boxing career at the age of 21 with a six-round draw with Angela Buchanan in 1989. She had her first training under the direction of Charlie Sensabaugh of Daniels West Virginia. Martin won a rematch with Buchanan one month later with a second round knockout. Andrea DeShong then beat Martin in a five-round decision. Martin then had nineteen consecutive wins, including two against Jamie Whitcomb and Suzanne Riccio-Major as well as a rubber match win against Buchanan. On October 15, 1993, Martin defeated Beverly Szymansky. Martin won by knocking out Szymansky in three rounds. Martin fought to a draw against debutante Laura Serrano in Las Vegas.

Martin&#x27;s next fights included a rematch with Szymansky, and a fourth fight with Buchanan. In 1993 Martin signed a promotional agreement with International Hall of Fame Promoter Don King that would put her in the international spotlight. Her first fights in that new agreement would be against Melinda Robinson and Sue Chase on the undercard of the Julio Cesar Chavez vs Frankie Randall fight in the first ever fight card at the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas, NV on January 29, 1994. the fight that many credit for putting women&#x27;s boxing on the sports fans&#x27; radar took place: On March 16, 1996, she and Deirdre Gogarty fought what many consider a great fight, on Showtimepay per view broadcast of the Mike Tyson vs Frank Bruno WBC Heavyweight Championship. Martin got the decision, and after that bout, she began to gain more celebrity, even appearing on the cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; once shortly afterwards. (Specifically, on April 15, 1996, Martin became the first female boxer to appear on the cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;; the headline read, &quot;The Lady Is a Champ&quot;.)

Martin made a special guest appearance on the television show &quot;Roseanne&quot; in season 9, episode 6, &quot;Pampered to a Pulp&quot;.

Martin won her next eight bouts including wins against Robinson, DeShong, Marcela Acuña and Isra Girgrah. Martin lost her title in a 10-round decision loss to Sumya Anani in 1998. Martin then won her next nine fights including wins against Belinda Laracuente, Sabrina Hall and Kathy Collins. Martin won her next two fights by ten-round decisions against Lisa Holeywine and Mia St. John.

In 2003 Martin fought Laila Ali and lost by a knockout in the fourth round.

Martin&#x27;s next fight in 2005 was a second-round knockout against Lana Alexander in Lula, Mississippi.

In 2005 a fight with Lucia Rijker, titled &quot;Million Dollar Lady&quot;, was canceled because Rijker ruptured her Achilles during training.

On September 16, 2005, in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Martin lost a 10-round unanimous decision to Holly Holm. Martin was beaten by the 23-year-old southpaw, with all three judges scoring for Holm.

Martin holds a record of 49 wins, 7 losses and 3 draws with 31 wins by knockout. She is a frequent visitor of the International Boxing Hall Of Fame annual induction ceremonies, and an avid autograph signer. She has fought on the undercard of boxers Mike Tyson, Evander Holyfield, Félix Trinidad and Julio César Chávez.

Martin was promoted by Don King, and was the first woman to sign with him. He signed Martin in October 1993 following her third-round knockout win against Beverly Szymanski.

=== Final bouts and retirement ===
Martin announced on January 19, 2011, that she would be fighting again in hopes of her 50th career win on the undercard of the Ricardo Mayorga vs Miguel Cotto fight at the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada, on March 12, 2011, against Dakota Stone in a rematch of their 2009 Fight. The fight was postponed due to a rib injury to Martin. The rescheduled rematch took place June 4, 2011, at Staples Center in Los Angeles on the Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. vs Sebastian Zbik undercard. Dakota Stone prevailed by TKO with :51 left as Martin broke her right hand on a punch in the fourth round and could not continue.

=== Post-retirement ===
Martin was among the first inductees in the International Women&#x27;s Boxing Hall of Fame in 2014.

In 2016, she became the first female boxer inducted into the Nevada Boxing Hall of Fame. That same year, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; reported that she was working two jobs, as a substitute teacher and helping military veterans find work, and that she was dealing with the after effects of her career, including dealing with lack of stamina and double vision. 

In 2020 she was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame; she was elected to it in 2019, the first year that women were on the ballot.

== Personal life ==
Martin married her manager, James V. &quot;Jim&quot; Martin, in 1991. At the time, Martin was 22 while her husband was 47. Martin referred to the marriage as one of convenience, and stated her husband was emotionally and physically abusive throughout their relationship, and enabled her addiction to cocaine to control her. She also claimed he used her prize money to pay for an extravagent lifestyle.

Martin married former ring rival Lisa Holewyne on November 25, 2017. Martin is the CEO of Christy Martin Promotions, a boxing promotion company that has promoted many events in North Carolina since 2016 and will be promoting boxing events in Jacksonville, Florida and in other Southern United States cities.

== Attempted murder ==
In March 2010, Christy Martin reconnected with her high school girlfriend Sherry Lusk over social media. Sometime later, Martin told her husband she wanted a divorce. On November 23, 2010, Christy Martin was stabbed several times and shot at least once in her torso and left for dead by her husband, 66-year-old James V. Martin. The attack reportedly occurred after an argument in their Apopka home. She survived the attack. On November 30, 2010, James Martin was arrested and taken to Orlando Regional Medical Center after he stabbed himself. He was booked in Orange County Jail and charged with attempted first degree murder and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon.

In April 2012, James Martin was found guilty of attempted second-degree murder. He was sentenced two months later to 25 years in prison. Jim Martin died on November 26, 2024 while serving his sentence at Graceville Correctional Facility in Graceville, Florida.

== In popular culture ==
In 2021, Netflix released &quot;&quot;, a documentary chronicling Martin’s career and personal life. In 2024, it was announced that a biopic of her life, starring Sydney Sweeney, was in production. The film was shot in September and October of 2024 and is expected to be released in November of 2025.

<doc id="148804" wikidata="Q328744" url="?curid=148804" title="Dodi Fayed">
<text>Emad El-Din Mohamed Abdel Mena&#x27;em Fayed (; 15 April 195531 August 1997), commonly known as Dodi Fayed, was an Egyptian film producer and the eldest child of the businessman Mohamed Al-Fayed. He was romantically involved with Diana, Princess of Wales, when they both died in a car crash in Paris on 31 August 1997.

==Early life and education==
Fayed was born in Alexandria, Egypt, the eldest child of Mohamed Al Fayed (1929–2023). His father later became the owner of Harrods department store, Fulham Football Club, and the Hôtel Ritz Paris. Fayed&#x27;s mother Samira Khashoggi (1935–1986), was a Saudi author. She was a daughter of Muhammad Khashoggi and sister of Saudi billionaire arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi. She and her brother were first cousins of the late &quot;Washington Post&quot; Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was assassinated in the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul in 2018. 

Fayed had four half siblings from his father&#x27;s second marriage to Heini Wathén: Omar, Camilla, Karim, and Jasmine Fayed.

Fayed was a student at Collège Saint Marc in Alexandria before attending the Institut Le Rosey in Rolle, Switzerland. He also briefly attended the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. 

After completing his education, he worked as an attaché at the United Arab Emirates Embassy in London.

==Film production==
Through his family&#x27;s production company, Allied Stars, Fayed was an executive producer of the films &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot;, &quot;Breaking Glass&quot;, &quot;F/X&quot;, &quot;F/X2&quot;, &quot;Hook&quot;, and &quot;The Scarlet Letter,&quot; and an executive creative consultant for &quot;F/X: The Series&quot;. He also worked for his father on marketing for Harrods.

==Personal life==
In 1986, Fayed married model Suzanne Gregard. They divorced eight months later. According to her memoir, &quot;Babylon Confidential&quot;, Claudia Christian had an on-again, off-again romance with Fayed.

In 1997, Fayed reportedly became engaged to American model Kelly Fisher. With money from his father, he bought a house in Malibu, California, for Fisher and himself. 

In July 1997, Fayed became romantically involved with Diana, Princess of Wales, after entertaining her on his yacht &quot;Cujo&quot;. Fisher learned of Fayed&#x27;s relationship with Diana only after seeing paparazzi photos of the two embracing. Fisher announced that she was filing a breach of contract suit against him, saying he had &quot;led her emotionally all the way up to the altar and abandoned her when they were almost there,&quot; and that he &quot;threw her love away in a callous way with no regard for her whatsoever&quot;. Fayed denied that he was ever engaged to Fisher. Fisher dropped the lawsuit shortly after Fayed&#x27;s death.

==Death==

In the early hours of 31 August 1997, Diana and Fayed died in a car crash in the Pont de l&#x27;Alma underpass in Paris. They had stopped in Paris en route to London after spending nine days on holiday in the French and Italian Rivieras aboard his family&#x27;s yacht, the &quot;Jonikal&quot;. Neither Fayed nor Diana was wearing a seat belt at the time of the crash. The only survivor of the crash was bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones.

Investigations by French and British police concluded that the chauffeur, Henri Paul, was driving under the influence of alcohol and prescription drugs. They also reported that paparazzi chasing the couple were believed to have contributed to the accident. 

Fayed&#x27;s father, Mohamed Al-Fayed, said that the couple &quot;were executed by MI6 agents&quot;. Fayed&#x27;s former spokesman, Michael Cole, has said that the couple became engaged before their deaths.

Fayed was originally buried in Brookwood Cemetery near Woking, Surrey, but was re-interred in October 1997 on the grounds of Barrow Green Court, the family estate in Oxted, Surrey.

==Legacy==
Fayed&#x27;s father erected two memorials to his son and Diana at Harrods. The first, unveiled on 12 April 1998, consists of photos of them behind a pyramid-shaped display containing a wine glass smudged with lipstick from Diana&#x27;s final dinner, and the ring Fayed had purchased for her the day before they died. The second, unveiled in 2005 and titled &quot;Innocent Victims&quot;, is a high bronze statue of the two dancing on a beach, beneath the wings of an albatross, a symbol of freedom and eternity.

The memorials were designed by Bill Mitchell, a close friend of Fayed&#x27;s father who had worked for the Fayed family for more than 40 years, including as a designer at Harrods. Fayed&#x27;s father sold Harrods in 2010.

In January 2018, the manager of Harrods announced that the statue would be returned to the Al-Fayed family. He noted that Diana&#x27;s sons William and Harry had commissioned a memorial to be installed at Kensington Palace, which the public could visit.
==Representation in other media==
*In the 2013 film &quot;Diana&quot;, Fayed was portrayed by Cas Anvar. 
*Episodes of seasons 5 and 6 of &quot;The Crown&quot; referred to him, and he was portrayed by Khalid Abdalla. In 2023, Abdalla received a Critics&#x27; Choice Television Award nomination for his performance.

<doc id="148805" wikidata="Q597848" url="?curid=148805" title="Edmund FitzAlan-Howard, 1st Viscount FitzAlan of Derwent">
<text>Edmund Bernard FitzAlan-Howard, 1st Viscount FitzAlan of Derwent (1 June 1855 – 18 May 1947), known as The Honourable Edmund Fitzalan-Howard between 1855 and 1856, Lord Edmund Fitzalan-Howard between 1856 and 1876, and Lord Edmund Talbot between 1876 and 1921, was a British Conservative politician and the last Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. He was the first Roman Catholic to be appointed Lord Lieutenant of Ireland since the 17th century, holding office when Ireland was partitioned into Southern Ireland and Northern Ireland.

==Background==
FitzAlan was born at 11 Carlton House Terrace, Westminster, the second son of Henry Fitzalan-Howard, 14th Duke of Norfolk by his wife the Hon. Augusta Lyons, daughter of Vice-Admiral Edmund Lyons, 1st Baron Lyons, and the younger brother of Henry Fitzalan-Howard, 15th Duke of Norfolk. He was principal beneficiary named in the will of Bertram Arthur Talbot, 17th Earl of Shrewsbury (1832–1856) provided he took the surname and arms of &quot;Talbot&quot;, which he did by royal licence in 1876. However, the late earl&#x27;s distant relatives contested the will, and the peerage and concomitant property were awarded after much litigation to Henry Chetwynd-Talbot, 3rd Earl Talbot, leaving Lord Edmund Talbot with only scattered minor lands. He returned to the use of his paternal name by royal licence in 1921, shortly after being raised to the peerage.

==Career==
Talbot was elected member of parliament for Chichester in 1894, a seat he held until 1921.

In 1899 he was appointed, by Redvers Buller, as the military censor of telegraph communications in Cape Town, South Africa, on the outbreak of the Boer War. He later served briefly under Arthur Balfour as a Lord of the Treasury in 1905 and under H. H. Asquith and later David Lloyd George as Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury from 1915 to 1921 (jointly from December 1916 onwards). In 1918 he was sworn of the Privy Council.

On 27 April 1921 he was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, the first Roman Catholic to be appointed to the position since 1685 during the reign of King James II. His appointment was possible because Section 37 of the Government of Ireland Act 1920 had been brought into force shortly beforehand. That provision provided that no British subject would be disqualified from holding the position on account of his religious belief. Concerning the announcement of his impending appointment, the &quot;Daily Chronicle&quot; observed that &quot;the concillatory motive of his appointment [being a Roman Catholic] is obvious...it is an olive branch in place of a dictatorship.&quot;

However, his tenure as Lord Lieutenant lasted only a year and a half. The post was abolished with the coming into existence of the Irish Free State and its constitution in 1922. The position was replaced by the offices of the Governor-General of the Irish Free State and the Governor of Northern Ireland. The day after his appointment as Lord Lieutenant he was raised to the Peerage as Viscount FitzAlan of Derwent, of Derwent in the County of Derby. In addition, during the minority of his nephew the 16th Duke of Norfolk, who succeeded to the dukedom in 1917, he served as Deputy Earl Marshal.

He was appointed Knight Companion of the Order of the Garter (KG) in 1925.

==Personal life==

FitzAlan married Lady Mary Bertie, daughter of Montagu Bertie, 7th Earl of Abingdon, on 5 August 1879. They lived at Cumberland Lodge in Windsor Great Park and had two children:

* Hon Mary Caroline Magdalan Fitzalan-Howard (born 24 August 1880, died 24 November 1974)
* Henry Edmund Fitzalan-Howard, 2nd Viscount FitzAlan of Derwent (born 30 October 1883, died 17 May 1962)

FitzAlan died on 18 May 1947 at the age of 91, and was succeeded in the viscountcy by his only son, Henry.

In his thirties, FitzAlan – then known as Lord Edmund Talbot – was the patron of Chichester City F.C.

==Titles==
* 1855–1856: &quot;The Honourable&quot; Edmund Fitzalan-Howard
* 1856–1876: The Lord Edmund Fitzalan-Howard
* 1876–1921: The Lord Edmund Talbot
* 1921–1947: &quot;The Right Honourable&quot; The Viscount FitzAlan of Derwent

<text>The  (; &quot;Head of [the] Council&quot;; plural usually ) is the chairperson (or speaker) of , the lower house of the (parliament) of Ireland. The person who holds the position is elected by members of the from among their number in the first session after each general election. The since 18 December 2024 has been Verona Murphy, independent TD. 

==Overview==
The Ceann Comhairle is expected to observe strict impartiality. Despite this, a government usually tries to select a member of its own political party for the position, if it has enough deputies to allow that choice. In order to protect the neutrality of the chair, the Constitution of Ireland provides that an incumbent Ceann Comhairle does not seek re-election as a Teachta Dála (Deputy to the Dáil), but rather is deemed automatically to have been re-elected by their constituency at that general election, unless they are retiring. As a consequence, the constituency that an incumbent Ceann Comhairle represents elects one fewer TD in a general election than its usual entitlement, but still has the same number of TDs. Under standing orders, no member of the government or Minister of State may act as Ceann Comhairle or Leas-Cheann Comhairle.

The Ceann Comhairle does not take part in debates, nor do they vote except in the event of a tie. In this event, they generally vote in accordance with the parliamentary conventions relating to the Speaker of the British House of Commons, which tend to amount to voting against motions. The Ceann Comhairle formally opens each day&#x27;s sitting by reading the official prayer. The Ceann Comhairle is the sole judge of order in the house and has a number of special functions. Specifically, the Ceann Comhairle:

*Calls on members to speak. All speeches must be addressed to the Ceann Comhairle.
*Puts such questions to the house, and supervises and declares the results of divisions.
*Has authority to suppress disorder. To ensure obedience to his/her rulings the Ceann Comhairle may order members to withdraw from the Dáil or suspend an individual from the House for a period. In the case of great disorder, the Ceann Comhairle can suspend or adjourn the house.
*Rings a bell when deputies are out of order. The bell is a half-sized reproduction of the ancient bell of Lough Lene Castle found at Castle Island, Lough Lene, Castlepollard, County Westmeath in 1881 and now in the National Museum. The reproduction was presented in 1931 by the widow of Bryan Cooper, a former TD.

The Ceann Comhairle is an member of the Presidential Commission, the Council of State, and the Commission for Public Service Appointments.

Since the 1937 Constitution, the Ceann Comhairle has been an member of the Council of State, beginning with Frank Fahy. The earlier presiding officers never served on the Council of State: i.e. those of the Revolutionary Dáil (1919–1922: Cathal Brugha, George Noble Plunkett, Eoin MacNeill, and Michael Hayes) and the Free State Dáil (1922–1936: Hayes again, before Fahy).

==History==
The position of Ceann Comhairle was created on the first day of the Dáil on 21 January 1919, when it was first established as a breakaway revolutionary parliament. The first Ceann Comhairle was Cathal Brugha, who served for only one day, presiding over the Dáil&#x27;s first meeting, before leaving the post to become President of Dáil Éireann. The office was continued under the 1922–1937 Irish Free State, the constitution of which referred to the office-holder as the &quot;Chairman of Dáil Éireann&quot;. The practice of automatically re-electing the Ceann Comhairle in a general election was introduced by a constitutional amendment in 1927. The outgoing Ceann Comhairle is returned at the election for their former party.

Following the abolition on 11 December 1936 of the office of Governor-General, the Ceann Comhairle was assigned some of the former office&#x27;s ceremonial functions, including signing bills into law and convening and dissolving the Dáil. These powers were transferred to the new office of President of Ireland when a new Constitution came into force on 29 December 1937, being carried out by the Presidential Commission, which included the Ceann Comhairle, until the first president entered office on 25 June 1938. The new Constitution retained the position of Ceann Comhairle and the practice of automatic re-election.

Patrick Hogan retired due to ill health in 1967, and died in 1969 before the following election. Joseph Brennan died in office in 1980. John O&#x27;Donoghue resigned the office in 2009 after an expenses scandal. As an ordinary TD he was no longer entitled to be returned automatically at the next general election in 2011, in which he lost his seat.

The Ceann Comhairle was first elected by secret ballot in 2016.

==Rules for election==
Under the rules for the election of the Ceann Comhairle, introduced during the 31st Dáil, candidates must be nominated by at least seven other members of Dáil Éireann. Each member may nominate only one candidate. Nominations must be submitted to the Clerk of the Dáil by not later than 6 p.m. on the day before the first day the Dáil meets after the general election in order to be valid, but may be withdrawn at any time up to the close of nominations.

If more than one candidate is nominated, the Dáil will vote by secret ballot in order of preference after the candidates&#x27; speeches, which may not exceed five minutes, with an absolute majority required for victory. If no candidate wins a majority on first preferences, the individual with the fewest votes will be eliminated and their votes redistributed in accordance with their next highest preference, under the alternative vote voting system. Eliminations and redistributions will continue until one member receives the requisite absolute majority. Then, the House will vote on a formal motion to appoint the member in question to the position of Ceann Comhairle. The Clerk of the Dáil will be the presiding officer of the House during the election process.

==List of office-holders==
===Ceann Comhairle===
For each Ceann Comhairle, this tables lists the number of the Dáil, the period in which they held office, their constituencies and their political affiliation immediately prior to their appointment.

===Leas-Cheann Comhairle===

The Leas-Cheann Comhairle holds office as the deputy chairperson of Dáil Éireann under Article 15.9.1 of the constitution. In the absence of the Ceann Comhairle, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle deputises and performs the duties and exercises the authority of the Ceann Comhairle in Dáil proceedings. The Leas-Cheann Comhairle is also elected by secret ballot. The current Leas-Cheann Comhairle is Fianna Fáil TD John McGuinness. Traditionally, the position was reserved for an Opposition TD. The role carries the pay and status as a Minister of State.

<doc id="148809" wikidata="Q219368" url="?curid=148809" title="Judith Butler">
<text>Judith Pamela Butler (born February 24, 1956) is an American feminist philosopher and gender studies scholar whose work has influenced political philosophy, ethics, and the fields of third-wave feminism, queer theory, and literary theory.

In 1993, Butler joined the faculty in the Department of Rhetoric at the University of California, Berkeley, where they became the Maxine Elliot Professor in the Department of Comparative Literature and the Program in Critical Theory in 1998. They also hold the Hannah Arendt Chair at the European Graduate School (EGS).

Butler is best known for their books &quot;Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity&quot; (1990) and &quot;Bodies That Matter: On the Discursive Limits of Sex&quot; (1993), in which they challenge conventional, heteronormative notions of gender and develop their theory of gender performativity. This theory has had a major influence on feminist and queer scholarship. Their work is often studied and debated in film studies courses emphasizing gender studies and performativity.

Butler has spoken on many contemporary political questions, including Israeli politics and in support of LGBT rights.

==Early life and education==
Judith Butler was born on February 24, 1956, in Cleveland, Ohio, to a family of Hungarian-Jewish and Russian-Jewish descent. Most of their maternal grandmother&#x27;s family was murdered in the Shoah. Butler&#x27;s parents were practicing Reform Jews. Their mother was raised Orthodox, eventually becoming Conservative and then Reform, while their father was raised Reform. As a child and teenager, Butler attended both Hebrew school and special classes on Jewish ethics, where they received their &quot;first training in philosophy&quot;. Butler stated in a 2010 interview with &quot;Haaretz&quot; that they began the ethics classes at the age of 14, and that they were created as a form of punishment by Butler&#x27;s Hebrew school&#x27;s rabbi because they were &quot;too talkative in class&quot;, and also often even accused of clowning. Butler said they were &quot;thrilled&quot; by the idea of these tutorials. When asked what they wanted to study in these special sessions, Butler responded with three questions preoccupying them at the time: &quot;Why was Spinoza excommunicated from the synagogue? Could German Idealism be held accountable for Nazism? And how was one to understand existential theology, including the work of Martin Buber?&quot;

Butler attended Bennington College before transferring to Yale University, where they studied philosophy and received a Bachelor of Arts in 1978 and a PhD in 1984. Their studies fell primarily under the traditions of German Idealism and phenomenology, and they spent one academic year at Heidelberg University as a Fulbright Scholar in 1979. After receiving their PhD, Butler revised their doctoral dissertation to produce their first book, entitled &quot;Subjects of Desire: Hegelian Reflections in Twentieth Century France&quot; (1987). Butler went on to teach at Wesleyan University, George Washington University, and Johns Hopkins University before joining the faculty of the University of California, Berkeley, in 1993. In 2002, they held the Spinoza Chair of Philosophy at the University of Amsterdam. In addition, they joined the department of English and Comparative Literature at Columbia University as Wun Tsun Tam Mellon Visiting Professor of the Humanities in the spring semesters of 2012, 2013 and 2014 with the option of remaining as full-time faculty.

Butler serves on the editorial or advisory board of several academic journals, including &quot;Janus Unbound: Journal of Critical Studies&quot;, &quot;JAC: A Journal of Rhetoric, Culture, and Politics&quot; and &quot;Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society.&quot;

==Overview of major works==
===&quot;Performative Acts and Gender Constitution&quot; (1988)===
In the essay &quot;Performative Acts and Gender Constitution: An Essay in Phenomenology and Feminist Theory,&quot; Judith Butler proposes that gender is performative – that is, gender is not so much a static identity or role, but rather comprises a set of acts which can evolve over time. Butler states that because gender identity is established through behavior, there is a possibility to construct different genders via different behaviors. &quot;...if gender is instituted through acts which are internally discontinuous, then the appearance of substance is precisely that, a constructed identity, a performative accomplishment which the mundane social audience, including the actors themselves, come to believe and to perform in the mode of belief. If the ground of gender identity is the stylized repetition of acts through time, and not a seemingly seamless identity, then the possibilities of gender transformation are to be found in the arbitrary relation between such acts, in the possibility of a different sort of repeating, in the breaking or subversive repetition of that style.&quot;Butler concludes their essay with a personal reflection on the strengths and limitations of widespread feminist theories which function on a solely binary perception of gender. Butler critiques what they call the &quot;reification&quot; of sexual difference within a heterosexual framework, and articulates their concern with how this framework affects the accurate presentation (or lack thereof) of &quot;femaleness&quot; across a diverse array of experiences, including those of women.&quot;As a corporeal field of cultural play, gender is a basically innovative affair, although it is quite clear that there are strict punishments for contesting the script by performing out of turn or through unwarranted improvisations. Gender is not passively scripted on the body, and neither is it determined by nature, language, the symbolic, or the overwhelming history of patriarchy. Gender is what is put on, invariably, under constraint, daily and incessantly, with anxiety and pleasure, but if this continuous act is mistaken for a natural or linguistic given, power is relinquished to expand the cultural field bodily through subversive performances of various kinds.&quot;Throughout this text, Butler derives influence from French philosophers such as Simone de Beauvoir and Maurice Merleau-Ponty, particularly de Beauvoir&#x27;s &quot;The Second Sex&quot; and Merleau-Ponty&#x27;s &quot;The Body in its Sexual Being.&quot; Butler also cites works by Gayle Rubin, Mary Anne Warren, and their own piece &quot;Sex and Gender in Simone de Beauvoir&#x27;s &quot;Second Sex&quot;&quot; (1986), among others.

===&quot;Gender Trouble&quot; (1990)===
&quot;Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity&quot; was first published in 1990, selling over 100,000 copies internationally, in multiple languages. Similar to &quot;Performative Acts and Gender Constitution,&quot; &quot;Gender Trouble&quot; discusses the works of Sigmund Freud, Simone de Beauvoir, Julia Kristeva, Jacques Lacan, Luce Irigaray, Monique Wittig, Jacques Derrida, and Michel Foucault.

Butler offers a critique of the terms &quot;gender&quot; and &quot;sex&quot; as they have been used by feminists. Butler argues that feminism made a mistake in trying to make &quot;women&quot; a discrete, ahistorical group with common characteristics. Butler writes that this approach reinforces the binary view of gender relations. Butler believes that feminists should not try to define &quot;women&quot; and they also believe that feminists should &quot;focus on providing an account of how power functions and shapes our understandings of womanhood not only in the society at large but also within the feminist movement.&quot; Finally, Butler aims to break the supposed links between sex and gender so that gender and desire can be &quot;flexible, free floating and not caused by other stable factors&quot; (David Gauntlett). The idea of identity as free and flexible and gender as performative, not an essence, has become one of the foundations of queer theory.

===&quot;Imitation and Gender Insubordination&quot; (1991)===
&quot;Inside/Out: Lesbian Theories, Gay Theories&quot; is a collection of writings of gay and lesbian social theorists. Butler&#x27;s contribution argues that no transparent revelation is afforded by using the terms &quot;gay&quot; or &quot;lesbian&quot; yet there is a political imperative to do so. Butler employs &quot;the concepts of play/performance, drag, and imitation&quot; to describe the formation of gender and sexuality as continually created subjectivities always at risk of dissolution from non-performance.&quot;

===&quot;Bodies That Matter&quot; (1993)===
&quot;Bodies That Matter: On the Discursive Limits of Sex&quot; seeks to clear up readings and supposed misinterpretations of performativity that view the enactment of sex/gender as a daily choice. As such, Butler aims to answer questions of this vein that may have been raised from their previous work &quot;Gender Trouble&quot;. Butler emphasizes the role of repetition in performativity, making use of Derrida&#x27;s theory of iterability, which is a form of citationality:Performativity cannot be understood outside of a process of iterability, a regularized and constrained repetition of norms. And this repetition is not performed &quot;by&quot; a subject; this repetition is what enables a subject and constitutes the temporal condition for the subject. This iterability implies that &#x27;performance&#x27; is not a singular &#x27;act&#x27; or event, but a ritualized production, a ritual reiterated under and through constraint, under and through the force of prohibition and taboo, with the threat of ostracism and even death controlling and compelling the shape of the production, but not, I will insist, determining it fully in advance.Butler also explores how gender can be understood not only as a performance, but also as a &quot;constitutive constraint,&quot; or constructed character. They ask how this conceptualization of an individual&#x27;s gender contributes to notions of bodily intelligibility, or comprehension, by other individuals. Butler continues to discuss bodily intelligibility by means of sex as a &quot;materialized&quot; entity, upon which cultural, collective ideals of gender can be built. From this angle, Butler interrogates value conscription upon various bodies as determined theories and practices of heterosexual predominance. If gender consists of the social meanings that sex assumes, then sex does not accrue social meanings as additive properties but, rather, is replaced by the social meanings it takes on; sex is relinquished in the course of that assumption, and gender emerges, not as a term in a continued relationship of opposition to sex, but as the term which absorbs and displaces &quot;sex,&quot; the mark of its full substantiation into gender or what, from a materialist point of view, might constitute a full de-substantiation.While continuing to draw upon sources such as those of Plato, Irigaray, Lacan, and Freud (as they did for &quot;Gender Trouble&quot;), Butler also draws upon pieces of documentary film and literature for &quot;Bodies That Matter&quot;. Such pieces include the film &quot;Paris is Burning&quot;, short stories by Willa Cather, and the novel &quot;Passing&quot; by Nella Larsen.

===&quot;Excitable Speech&quot; (1997)===
In &quot;Excitable Speech: A Politics of the Performative&quot;, Butler surveys the problems of hate speech and censorship. They argue that censorship is difficult to evaluate, and that in some cases it may be useful or even necessary, while in others it may be worse than tolerance.

Butler argues that hate speech exists retrospectively, only after being declared such by state authorities. In this way, the state reserves for itself the power to define hate speech and, conversely, the limits of acceptable discourse. In this connection, Butler criticizes feminist legal scholar Catharine MacKinnon&#x27;s argument against pornography for its unquestioning acceptance of the state&#x27;s power to censor.

Deploying Foucault&#x27;s argument from the first volume of &quot;The History of Sexuality&quot;, Butler states that any attempt at censorship, legal or otherwise, necessarily propagates the very language it seeks to forbid. As Foucault argues, for example, the strict sexual mores of 19th-century Western Europe did nothing but amplify the discourse of sexuality they sought to control. Extending this argument using Derrida and Lacan, Butler says that censorship is primitive to language, and that the linguistic &quot;I&quot; is a mere effect of a primitive censorship. In this way, Butler questions the possibility of any genuinely oppositional discourse; &quot;If speech depends upon censorship, then the principle that one might seek to oppose is at once the formative principle of oppositional speech&quot;.

===&quot;Precarious Life&quot; (2004)===

&quot;Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence&quot; opens a new line in Judith Butler&#x27;s work that has had a great impact on their subsequent thought, especially on books like &quot;Frames of War: When Is Life Grievable?&quot; (2009) or &quot;Notes Toward a Performative Theory of Assembly&quot; (2015), as well as on other contemporary thinkers. In this book, Butler deals with issues of precarity, vulnerability, grief and contemporary political violence in the face of the War on terror and the realities of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay and similar detention centers. Drawing on Foucault, they characterize the form of power at work in these places of &quot;indefinite detention&quot; as a convergence of sovereignty and governmentality. The &quot;state of exception&quot; deployed here is in fact more complex than the one pointed out by Agamben in his &quot;Homo Sacer&quot;, since the government is in a more ambiguous relation to law —it may comply with it or suspend it, depending on its interests, and this is itself a tool of the state to produce its own sovereignty. Butler also points towards problems in international law treatises like the Geneva Conventions. In practice, these only protect people who belong to (or act in the name of) a recognized state, and therefore are helpless in situations of abuse toward stateless people, people who do not enjoy a recognized citizenship or people who are labelled &quot;terrorists&quot;, and therefore understood as acting on their own behalf as irrational &quot;killing machines&quot; that need to be held captive due to their &quot;dangerousness&quot;.

Butler also writes here on vulnerability and precariousness as intrinsic to the human condition. This is due to our inevitable interdependency from other precarious subjects, who are never really &quot;complete&quot; or autonomous but instead always &quot;dispossessed&quot; on the Other. This is manifested in shared experiences like grief and loss, that can form the basis for a recognition of our shared human (vulnerable) condition. However, not every loss can be mourned in the same way, and in fact not every life can be conceived of as such (as situated in a condition common to ours). Through a critical engagement with Levinas, they will explore how certain representations prevent lives from being considered worthy of being lived or taken into account, precluding the mourning of certain Others, and with that the recognition of them and their losses as equally human. This preoccupation with the dignifying or dehumanizing role of practices of framing and representations will constitute one of the central elements of &quot;Frames of War&quot; (2009).

===&quot;Undoing Gender&quot; (2004)===

&quot;Undoing Gender&quot; collects Butler&#x27;s reflections on gender, sex, sexuality, psychoanalysis and the medical treatment of intersex people for a more general readership than many of their other books. Butler revisits and refines their notion of performativity and focuses on the question of undoing &quot;restrictively normative conceptions of sexual and gendered life&quot;.

Butler discusses how gender is performed without one being conscious of it, but says that it does not mean this performativity is &quot;automatic or mechanical&quot;. They argue that we have desires that do not originate from our personhood, but rather, from social norms. The writer also debates our notions of &quot;human&quot; and &quot;less-than-human&quot; and how these culturally imposed ideas can keep one from having a &quot;viable life&quot; as the biggest concerns are usually about whether a person will be accepted if their desires differ from normality. Butler states that one may feel the need of being recognized in order to live, but that at the same time, the conditions to be recognized make life &quot;unlivable&quot;. The writer proposes an interrogation of such conditions so that people who resist them may have more possibilities of living.

In Butler&#x27;s discussion of intersex issues and people, Butler addresses the case of David Reimer, a person whose sex was medically reassigned from male to female after a botched circumcision at eight months of age. Reimer was &quot;made&quot; female by doctors, but later in life identified as &quot;really&quot; male, married and became a stepfather to his wife&#x27;s three children, and went on to tell his story in &quot;As Nature Made Him: The Boy Who Was Raised as a Girl&quot;, which he wrote with John Colapinto. Reimer died by suicide in 2004.

===&quot;Giving an Account of Oneself&quot; (2005)===
In &quot;Giving an Account of Oneself&quot;, Butler develops an ethics based on the opacity of the subject to itself; in other words, the limits of self-knowledge. Primarily borrowing from Theodor Adorno, Michel Foucault, Friedrich Nietzsche, Jean Laplanche, Adriana Cavarero and Emmanuel Levinas, Butler develops a theory of the formation of the subject. Butler theorizes the subject in relation to the social – a community of others and their norms – which is beyond the control of the subject it forms, as precisely the very condition of that subject&#x27;s formation, the resources by which the subject becomes recognizably human, a grammatical &quot;I&quot;, in the first place.

Butler accepts the claim that if the subject is opaque to itself the limitations of its free ethical responsibility and obligations are due to the limits of narrative, presuppositions of language and projection.

Instead Butler argues for an ethics based precisely on the limits of self-knowledge as the limits of responsibility itself. Any concept of responsibility which demands the full transparency of the self to itself, an entirely accountable self, necessarily does violence to the opacity which marks the constitution of the self it addresses. The scene of address by which responsibility is enabled is always already a relation between subjects who are variably opaque to themselves and to each other. The ethics that Butler envisions is therefore one in which the responsible self knows the limits of its knowing, recognizes the limits of its capacity to give an account of itself to others, and respects those limits as symptomatically human. To take seriously one&#x27;s opacity to oneself in ethical deliberation means then to critically interrogate the social world in which one comes to be human in the first place and which remains precisely that which one cannot know about oneself. In this way, Butler locates social and political critique at the core of ethical practice.

=== &quot;Notes Toward a Performative Theory of Assembly&quot; (2015) ===

In &quot;Notes Toward a Performative Theory of Assembly&quot;, Butler discusses the power of public gatherings, considering what they signify and how they work. They use this framework to analyze the power and possibilities of protests, such as the Black Lives Matter protests regarding the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner in 2014.

=== &quot;The Force of Nonviolence&quot; (2020) ===
In &quot;The Force of Nonviolence: An Ethico-Political Bind&quot;, Butler connects the ideologies of nonviolence and the political struggle for social equality. They review the traditional understanding of &quot;nonviolence,&quot; stating that it &quot;is often misunderstood as a passive practice that emanates from a calm region of the soul, or as an individualist ethical relation to existing forms of power.&quot; Instead of this understanding, Butler argues that &quot;nonviolence is an ethical position found in the midst of the political field.&quot;

=== &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Gender?&quot; (2024) ===

In &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Gender?&quot;, Butler explores the roots of current anti-trans rhetoric, which they define as a &quot;phantasm&quot; that aligns itself with emerging authoritarian movements. Butler was inspired to write this book after being attacked in 2017 in Brazil while speaking, at least one of whom shouted at Butler, saying &quot;Take your ideology to hell!&quot; Butler is interested in the literal demonization of gender by analyzing the historical context of the anti-gender movement. The book has been described as &quot;the most accessible of their books so far, an intervention meant for a wide audience&quot;.

==Reception==
Butler&#x27;s work has been influential in feminist and queer theory, cultural studies, and continental philosophy. Their contribution to a range of other disciplines, such as psychoanalysis, literary, film, and performance studies as well as visual arts, has also been significant. Their theory of gender performativity as well as their conception of &quot;critically queer&quot; have heavily influenced understandings of gender and queer identity in the academic world, and have shaped and mobilized various kinds of political activism, particularly queer activism, internationally. Butler&#x27;s work has also entered into contemporary debates on the teaching of gender, gay parenting, and the depathologization of transgender people.

Some academics and political activists see in Butler a departure from the sex/gender dichotomy and a non-essentialist conception of gender—along with an insistence that power helps form the subject—an idea whose introduction purportedly brought new insights to feminist and queer praxis, thought, and studies. Darin Barney of McGill University wrote that:
Postmodern feminism&#x27;s major departure from other branches of feminism is perhaps the argument that sex is itself constructed through language, a view notably propounded in Butler&#x27;s 1990 book, &quot;Gender Trouble&quot;. Consequently, Butler&#x27;s work is passible of criticism by modernist and anti-relativist critics of postmodernism who deplore the idea that categories spoken about in the natural sciences (e.g., sex) are socially constructed.

In 1998, Denis Dutton&#x27;s journal &quot;Philosophy and Literature&quot; awarded Butler first prize in its fourth annual &quot;Bad Writing Competition&quot;, which set out to &quot;celebrate bad writing from the most stylistically lamentable passages found in scholarly books and articles&quot;, which Butler responded to.

Some critics have accused Butler of elitism due to their difficult prose style, while others state that Butler reduces gender to &quot;discourse&quot; or promotes a form of gender . Susan Bordo, for example, has argued that Butler reduces gender to language and has contended that the body is a major part of gender, in opposition to Butler&#x27;s conception of gender as performative. A particularly vocal critic has been feminist Martha Nussbaum, who has argued that Butler misreads J. L. Austin&#x27;s idea of performative utterance, makes erroneous legal claims, forecloses an essential site of resistance by repudiating pre-cultural agency, and provides no &quot;normative theory of social justice and human dignity.&quot; Finally, Nancy Fraser&#x27;s critique of Butler was part of a famous exchange between the two theorists. Fraser has suggested that Butler&#x27;s focus on performativity distances them from &quot;everyday ways of talking and thinking about ourselves. ... Why should we use such a self-distancing idiom?&quot; Butler responded to criticisms in the preface to the 1999-edition &quot;Gender Trouble&quot; by asking suggestively whether there is &quot;a value to be derived from...experiences of linguistic difficulty.&quot;

More recently, several critics — such as semiotician Viviane Namaste
— have criticised Judith Butler&#x27;s &quot;Undoing Gender&quot; for under-emphasizing the intersectional aspects of gender-based violence. For example, Timothy Laurie notes that Butler&#x27;s use of phrases like &quot;gender politics&quot; and &quot;gender violence&quot; in relation to assaults on transgender individuals in the United States can &quot;[scour] a landscape filled with class and labour relations, racialized urban stratification, and complex interactions between sexual identity, sexual practices and sex work&quot;, and produce instead &quot;a clean surface on which struggles over &#x27;the human&#x27; are imagined to play out&quot;.

German feminist Alice Schwarzer speaks of Butler&#x27;s &quot;radical intellectual games&quot; that would not change how society classifies and treats a woman; thus, by eliminating female and male identity Butler would have abolished the discourse about sexism in the queer community. Schwarzer also accuses Butler of remaining silent about the oppression of women and homosexuals in the Islamic world, while readily exercising their right to same-sex-marriage in the United States; instead, Butler would sweepingly defend Islam, including Islamism, from critics.

EGS philosophy professor Geoffrey Bennington, translator for many of Derrida&#x27;s books, criticised Butler&#x27;s introduction to the 1997 translation of Derrida&#x27;s 1967 &quot;Of Grammatology&quot;.

===Non-academic===
 Before a 2017 democracy conference in Brazil, Butler was burnt in effigy.

Bruno Perreau has written that Butler was literally depicted as an &quot;antichrist&quot;, both because of their gender and their Jewish identity, the fear of minority politics and critical studies being expressed through fantasies of a corrupted body.

==Political activism==
Much of Butler&#x27;s early political activism centered around queer and feminist issues, and they served, for a period of time, as the chair of the board of the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission. Over the years, Butler has been particularly active in the gay and lesbian rights, feminist, and anti-war movements. They have also written and spoken out on issues ranging from affirmative action and gay marriage to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the prisoners detained at Guantanamo Bay. More recently, Butler has been active in the Occupy movement and has publicly expressed support for a version of the 2005 Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaign against Israel.

They emphasize that Israel does not, and should not, be taken to represent all Jews or Jewish opinions. Butler is an outspoken critic of many aspects of contemporary Israel&#x27;s actions and has criticized some forms of Zionism. Butler has been variously identified as post-Zionist and anti-Zionist but is reluctant to embrace such labels, saying in 2013, &quot;I prefer to [provide] a story rather than a category. I come from a strong zionist community in the [United States], and became critical of zionism starting in my early twenties... I am now working for what can only be called a post-zionist vision at this point in history. Perhaps at another point in history, I would be called a zionist, or even call myself that.&quot;

Butler argues that, though antisemitism has been rising, there is a danger that Jews are seen as &quot;presumptive victims&quot;, leading to widespread misuse of accusations of antisemitism, which may in fact trivialize the accusation&#x27;s gravity and weight.

On September 7, 2006, Butler participated in a faculty-organized teach-in against the 2006 Lebanon War at the University of California, Berkeley. Another widely publicized moment occurred in June 2010, when Butler refused the Civil Courage Award (&quot;Zivilcouragepreis&quot;) of the Christopher Street Day (CSD) Parade in Berlin, Germany, at the award ceremony. They cited racist comments on the part of organizers and a general failure of CSD organizations to distance themselves from racism in general and from anti-Muslim excuses for war more specifically. Criticizing the event&#x27;s commercialism, Butler went on to name several groups that they commended as stronger opponents of &quot;homophobia, transphobia, sexism, racism, and militarism&quot;.

In October 2011, Butler attended Occupy Wall Street and, in reference to calls for clarification of the protesters&#x27; demands, they said:

People have asked, so what are the demands? What are the demands all of these people are making? Either they say there are no demands and that leaves your critics confused, or they say that the demands for social equality and economic justice are impossible demands. And the impossible demands, they say, are just not practical. If hope is an impossible demand, then we demand the impossible – that the right to shelter, food and employment are impossible demands, then we demand the impossible. If it is impossible to demand that those who profit from the recession redistribute their wealth and cease their greed, then yes, we demand the impossible.

Butler is an executive member of Faculty for Israeli-Palestinian Peace – Educational Network for Human Rights in Israel/Palestine. They are also a member of the advisory board of Jewish Voice for Peace. In mainstream U.S. politics, they expressed support for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election.

===Adorno Prize affair===

When Butler received the 2012 Theodor W. Adorno Award, the prize committee came under attack from Israel&#x27;s Ambassador to Germany, Yacov Hadas-Handelsman; the director of the Simon Wiesenthal Center&#x27;s office in Jerusalem, Efraim Zuroff; and the German Central Council of Jews. They were upset at Butler&#x27;s selection because of their remarks about Israel, and specifically, &quot;calls for a boycott against Israel&quot;. Butler responded saying that &quot;[Butler] did not take attacks from German Jewish leaders personally&quot;. Rather, they wrote, the attacks are &quot;directed against everyone who is critical against Israel and its current policies.&quot;

In a letter to the &quot;Mondoweiss&quot; website, Butler wrote that their strong ethical views were grounded in Jewish philosophical thought and that it is &quot;blatantly untrue, absurd, and painful for anyone to argue that those who formulate a criticism of the State of Israel is anti-Semitic or, if Jewish, self-hating&quot;.

=== Comments on Hamas, Hezbollah and the Israel–Hamas war ===
Butler has been criticized for statements they have made about Hamas and Hezbollah. Butler was accused of describing the militant Islamist groups as &quot;social movements that are progressive, that are on the Left, that are part of a global Left&quot; in 2012. They were accused of defending &quot;Hezbollah and Hamas as progressive organizations&quot; and supporting their tactics.

Butler responded to these criticisms by stating that their remarks on Hamas and Hezbollah were taken completely out of context and, in so doing, their established views on non-violence were contradicted and misrepresented. Butler describes the origin of their remarks on Hamas and Hezbollah in the following way:
I was asked by a member of an academic audience a few years ago whether I thought Hamas and Hezbollah belonged to &quot;the global left&quot; and I replied with two points. My first point was merely descriptive: those political organizations define themselves as anti-imperialist, and anti-imperialism is one characteristic of the global left, so on that basis one could describe them as part of the global left. My second point was then critical: as with any group on the left, one has to decide whether one is for that group or against that group, and one needs to critically evaluate their stand.

After the start of the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, Butler published an essay entitled &quot;The Compass of Mourning&quot; in which they &quot;condemn without qualification&quot; the &quot;terrifying and revolting massacre&quot; while at the same time arguing that the attacks by Hamas should be seen in the context of the &quot;horrors of the last seventy years&quot;. The article was criticized several times in German newspapers. Christian Geyer-Hindemith wrote in the &quot;Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung&quot; that Butler &quot;makes individual atrocities disappear&quot; through contextualization. Thomas E. Schmidt spoke in the &quot;Die Zeit&quot; about the &quot;reversal of guilt&quot;. At the same time, Anna Mayr wrote in the &quot;Die Zeit&quot; that &quot;countless the same thing goes on for paragraphs: Nothing can justify the violence, and you still have to see the violence of the occupying power, Israel. It becomes clear that [they] (understandably) doesn&#x27;t know where to think next.&quot; Writing for &quot;Haaretz&quot;, Chaim Levinson rejected Butler&#x27;s framing of the matter within a context of colonialism, saying that term is &quot;the emptiest word in Western intellectual discourse today&quot;.

Speaking at a public event in Paris on March 3, 2024, Butler stated that the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel was an uprising, an instance of armed resistance, rather than an act of terrorism.

&quot;I think it is more honest and historically correct to say that the uprising of October 7 was an act of armed resistance. It is not a terrorist attack and it is not an antisemitic attack. It was an attack against Israelis.&quot;

=== Comments on Black Lives Matter ===
In a January 2015 interview with George Yancy of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Butler discussed the Black Lives Matter movement. They said:
What is implied by this statement [Black Lives Matter], a statement that should be obviously true, but apparently is not? If black lives do not matter, then they are not really regarded as lives, since a life is supposed to matter. So what we see is that some lives matter more than others, that some lives matter so much that they need to be protected at all costs, and that other lives matter less, or not at all. And when that becomes the situation, then the lives that do not matter so much, or do not matter at all, can be killed or lost, can be exposed to conditions of destitution, and there is no concern, or even worse, that is regarded as the way it is supposed to be...When people engage in concerted actions across racial lines to build communities based on equality, to defend the rights of those who are disproportionately imperiled to have a chance to live without the fear of dying quite suddenly at the hands of the police. There are many ways to do this, in the street, the office, the home, and in the media. Only through such an ever-growing cross-racial struggle against racism can we begin to achieve a sense of all the lives that really do matter.
The dialogue draws heavily on their 2004 book &quot;Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence.&quot;

===Avital Ronell sexual harassment case===
On May 11, 2018, Butler joined a group of scholars in writing a letter to New York University following the sexual harassment suit filed by a former NYU graduate student against his advisor Avital Ronell. The signatories acknowledged not having had access to the confidential findings of the investigation that followed the Title IX complaint against Ronell. Nonetheless, they accused the complainant of waging a &quot;malicious campaign&quot; against Ronell. The signatories also wrote that the presumed &quot;malicious intention has animated and sustained this legal nightmare&quot; for a highly regarded scholar. &quot;If she were to be terminated or relieved of her duties, the injustice would be widely recognized and opposed.&quot; Butler, one of the signatories, invoked their title as President Elect of the Modern Language Association. James J. Marino, a professor at Cleveland State University and a member of the MLA, started a petition to demand Butler&#x27;s resignation or removal from their post. He argued that &quot;Protesting against one instance of punishment is only a means to the larger end of preserving senior faculty&#x27;s privilege of impunity. ... [Butler] was standing up for an old, corrupt, and long-standing way of doing business. The time for doing business that way is over. We should never look back.&quot; Some three months later, Butler apologized to the MLA for the letter. &quot;I acknowledged that I should not have allowed the MLA affiliation to go forward with my name,&quot; Butler wrote to the &quot;Chronicle of Higher Education&quot;. &quot;I expressed regret to the MLA officers and staff, and my colleagues accepted my apology. I extend that same apology to MLA members.&quot;

===Comments on the anti-gender movement and trans-exclusionary radical feminism===
Butler said in 2020 that trans-exclusionary radical feminism (TERF) is &quot;a fringe movement that is seeking to speak in the name of the mainstream, and that our responsibility is to refuse to let that happen&quot;. In 2021, drawing from Umberto Eco who understood &quot;fascism&quot; as &quot;a beehive of contradictions&quot;, they noted that the term &quot;fascism&quot; &quot;describes&quot; the &quot;anti-gender ideology&quot;. They cautioned self-declared feminists from allying with anti-gender movements in targeting trans, non-binary, and genderqueer people. Butler also explored the issue in a 2019 paper in which they argued that &quot;the confusion of discourses is part of what constitutes the fascist structure and appeal of at least some of these [anti-gender] movements. One can oppose gender as a cultural import from the North at the same time that one can see that very opposition as a social movement against further colonization of the South. The result is not a turn to the Left, but an embrace of ethno-nationalism.&quot; In 2023 Butler said, &quot;the anti-gender ideology movement should be considered a neo-fascist phenomenon.&quot;

====&quot;The Guardian&quot; interview====
On September 7, 2021, &quot;The Guardian&quot; published an interview with Butler by Jules Gleeson that included Butler&#x27;s view of trans-exclusionary feminists (TERFs). In response to a question about the Wi Spa controversy, the &quot;Press Gazette&quot; stated that Butler, in the &quot;Guardian&quot; article, said: &quot;The anti-gender ideology is one of the dominant strains of fascism in our times.&quot; Within a few hours of publication, three paragraphs including this statement were removed, with a note explaining: &quot;This article was edited on 7 September 2021 to reflect developments which occurred after the interview took place.&quot;

&quot;The Guardian&quot; was then accused of censoring Butler for having compared TERFs to fascists. British writer Roz Kaveney called it &quot;a truly shocking moment of bigoted dishonesty,&quot; while British transgender activist and writer Juno Dawson, among others, observed that &quot;The Guardian&quot; had inadvertently triggered the Streisand effect—an attempt to censor yields the unintended consequence of increasing awareness of a topic. The next day, &quot;The Guardian&quot; acknowledged &quot;a failure in our editorial standards&quot;.

<doc id="148813" wikidata="Q2584009" url="?curid=148813" title="MAX Light Rail">
<text>The Metropolitan Area Express (MAX) is a light rail system serving the Portland metropolitan area in the U.S. state of Oregon. Owned and operated by TriMet, it consists of five lines connecting the six sections of Portland; the communities of Beaverton, Clackamas, Gresham, Hillsboro, Milwaukie, and Oak Grove; and Portland International Airport to Portland City Center. Trains run seven days a week with headways between 30 minutes off-peak and three minutes during rush hours. In 2023, MAX recorded an annual ridership of .

MAX was among the first second-generation American light rail systems to be built, conceived from freeway revolts that took place in the 1970s. Planning for the network&#x27;s inaugural eastside segment, then referred to as the Banfield Light Rail Project, started in 1973 ahead of the cancelation of the Mount Hood Freeway. Construction began in 1982, and service commenced between downtown Portland and Gresham on September 5, 1986. The original 27-station, line has since been expanded to 94 stations and of track. The latest extension, from Portland to Milwaukie, opened in 2015.

MAX is one of three urban rail transit services operating in the Portland metropolitan area, the other two being the Portland Streetcar and WES Commuter Rail. MAX directly connects with them as well as with other transit services such as Amtrak, Frequent Express, and local and intercity buses. Trains operate with two-car consists due to downtown Portland&#x27;s short city blocks. Vehicles and platforms are fully accessible, and fares are collected through the Hop Fastpass payment system.

==History==
===Predecessors===

In the early 20th century, privately funded interurbans and streetcars gave Portland one of the largest urban rail systems in the American West, with lines that once extended as far north as Vancouver, Washington, south as Eugene, east as Troutdale, and west as Forest Grove. Portland&#x27;s first trolleys were brought over from San Francisco by Ben Holladay in 1872; they were drawn by horses and mules and operated by the Portland Street Railway Company. In 1890, the first electric streetcar opened in Albina while the first cable car began serving 5th Avenue; these marked the start of an era of major rail expansion. In 1892, the East Side Railway Company opened the first long-distance interurban line—a route from Portland to Oregon City. The Portland Railway, Light and Power Company had taken over all local streetcars by 1906, and interurbans by 1908. In 1912, as Portland&#x27;s population exceeded 250,000, transit ridership stood at 70 million passengers annually. Passenger rail services had started to decline by the 1920s with the rise of the automobile and suburban and freeway development. Portland&#x27;s original streetcar lines had ceased operating by 1950, replaced by buses until 2001, when the modern Portland Streetcar opened in downtown Portland. The region&#x27;s last two interurban lines, which traveled to Oregon City and Bellrose (Southeast 136th Avenue), permanently closed in 1958.

===Early beginnings===

At the height of local freeway revolts in the 1970s, studies for public transit began using funds made available by the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1973. These funds had been intended for the Mount Hood Freeway and Interstate 505 (I-505) projects, which were abandoned amid strong opposition from the Portland city government and neighborhood associations. In 1973, Governor Tom McCall assembled a task force that helped determine several alternative options, including a busway and light rail. Local jurisdictions originally favored the busway alternative but support for light rail prevailed following the mode&#x27;s inclusion in a 1977 environmental impact statement. The proposal became known as the Banfield light rail project, named for the Banfield Freeway, a segment of I-84 that part of the alignment followed. TriMet approved the project in September 1978. Construction of the , 27-station line between 11th Avenue in downtown Portland and Cleveland Avenue in Gresham began in March 1982. Inaugural service commenced on September 5, 1986. Less than two months before opening, TriMet adopted the name &quot;Metropolitan Area Express&quot;, or &quot;MAX&quot;, following an employee contest.

As the planning of a light rail line to the west side gained momentum in the mid-1980s, the original MAX line came to be referred to as the Eastside MAX to distinguish it from what would become the Westside MAX extension. Early proposals called for the extension to terminate just west of the Beaverton–Hillsboro boundary on 185th Avenue in Washington County. A dispute between TriMet and the Urban Mass Transportation Administration over a financing plan suspended the project for several years but planning resumed in 1988 and studies were completed in 1991. Staunch lobbying by local and state officials led by Hillsboro Mayor Shirley Huffman forced an extension of the line further west to downtown Hillsboro in 1993. Construction of the 20-station, line began that August with the excavation of the Robertson Tunnel. The Westside MAX opened in two stages following delays in tunneling: the section from 11th Avenue to Kings Hill/Southwest Salmon Street was opened in 1997 and the section to Hatfield Government Center—the segment&#x27;s current western terminus—was opened in 1998. The resulting MAX line began operating as a single, through service on September 12, 1998. This service was renamed the Blue Line in 2001 after TriMet adopted color designations for its light rail routes.

===South/North plan===

At the same time TriMet was planning the Westside MAX in the mid-1980s, Metro regional government announced new light rail proposals for Clackamas County. Its planning committee—the Joint Policy Advisory Committee on Transportation (JPACT)—proposed two separate routes that would have run between downtown Portland and Oregon City via Milwaukie and between Portland International Airport and Clackamas Town Center via I-205. Further planning led JPACT to favor the I-205 corridor due to an existing right-of-way along the I-205 Transitway, an unfinished mass transit component of the freeway that had been built to accommodate a busway. TriMet, however, prioritized the Westside MAX during its bid for federal matching funds and the I-205 plans were put on hold. In 1989, studies for both I-205 and Milwaukie proposals received funding from the U.S. Senate Committee on Appropriations under the condition that they included potential route extensions to Clark County, Washington. Metro completed the studies in 1993, ultimately abandoning I-205 in favor of a route along the I-5 and Willamette River corridors. It finalized a single line from Hazel Dell, Washington south to Clackamas Town Center via Milwaukie, which Metro and TriMet formally named the South–North Line. Metro said it adopted the name &quot;South/North&quot; instead of the more conventional &quot;North/South&quot; word order, at the request of representatives in the southern part of the corridor after the southern leg, which had long been planned to be the next-priority MAX corridor after the Westside line, was merged with the northern leg as a single proposed project.

In November 1994, 63% of Portland area voters passed a $475million ballot measure to fund Oregon&#x27;s portion of the project. The following February, however, Clark County residents defeated a tax measure that would have funded Washington&#x27;s share. To move the project forward, TriMet downsized the plan and abandoned the line&#x27;s Clark County and North Portland segments up to the Rose Quarter. That July, the Oregon House of Representatives approved a $750million transportation package, which included $375 million for the scaled-back line. The funding was annulled by the Oregon Supreme Court due to the inclusion of unrelated measures that violated the state&#x27;s constitution. The legislature met again in February 1996 and passed a revised $375million package, but light rail opponents forced a statewide vote and defeated it the following November. A third proposal between Lombard Street in North Portland and Clackamas Town Center followed. This time, Metro and TriMet pursued the project without seeking contributions from either Clark County or the state, instead sourcing funds from Clackamas County and Portland. In 1998, TriMet placed a new ballot measure to reaffirm voter support for the $475million originally approved in 1994. The measure failed by 52% in November of that year, effectively canceling the proposed line.

===Airport and Interstate lines===

Compelled by the rapid expansion of Portland International Airport in the 1990s, the Port of Portland began exploring ways to alleviate worsening traffic congestion, including the possibility of introducing MAX service, which regional planners had not anticipated for at least another 20 years. In 1997, engineering firm Bechtel accelerated plans by submitting an unsolicited proposal to design and build an airport rail link in exchange for of Port property. A public–private partnership between the company and local governments was negotiated and construction of the Airport MAX began in June 1999. With no federal assistance requested and right-of-way already secured, it was completed in just under two years. The four-station, line between Gateway/Northeast 99th Avenue Transit Center and Portland International Airport station opened on September 10, 2001. Celebrations scheduled for that weekend were canceled in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. Red Line service originally ran between the airport and downtown, turning around at the loop tracks on 11th Avenue. On September 1, 2003, it was extended west along existing tracks to Beaverton Transit Center to relieve overcrowding on the Blue Line and to create a one-seat airport connection for the west side.

In 1999, Portland business leaders and residents who were opposed to the cancellation of the South–North Line urged TriMet to revive the project. TriMet responded with a new proposal that would expand MAX solely to North Portland via North Interstate Avenue. The agency moved forward with this plan and the Interstate MAX broke ground in February 2001. To minimize costs to taxpayers, the city created an urban renewal district and federal matching funds were allocated from the Airport MAX and Portland Streetcar projects, since these projects were locally funded. The 10-station, extension from the Rose Quarter to the Expo Center opened on May 1, 2004, with its new service designated the Yellow Line. From 2004 to 2009, the Yellow Line ran from Expo Center station in North Portland to 11th Avenue in downtown Portland, following the Blue and Red lines&#x27; downtown alignment from the Steel Bridge. On August 30, 2009, it was rerouted to terminate at the PSU Urban Center stations with the addition of light rail to the Portland Transit Mall. In September 2012, this was extended further south to the PSU South stations, which had not been built due to the construction of nearby transit-oriented development. The Yellow Line became interlined with the Orange Line in 2015; it now only operates the northbound segment of the transit mall.

===South Corridor extensions===

In 2001, Metro revisited its former light rail plans for Clackamas County and reconsidered proposals similar to those of the canceled South/North project, with two routes extending to Clackamas and Milwaukie. This resulted in a new study, which Metro referred to as the South Corridor transportation project, that evaluated light rail among other alternatives. The study&#x27;s task force recommend both light rail options in 2003 and suggested splitting the project into two phases. The first phase planned for the addition of light rail to I-205, between Gateway Transit Center and Clackamas Town Center. In October of that year, the first phase plans were amended to include adding light rail to the Portland Transit Mall following a petition from Portland business leaders. The combined project was approved for federal funding in 2006 and work began in January 2007. Light rail commenced service along the 14-station, Portland Transit Mall on August 30, 2009, first served by the Yellow Line. The opening of the eight-station, I-205 MAX and Green Line service followed on September 12.

The South Corridor project&#x27;s second phase initially proposed the extension of MAX between downtown Portland and Milwaukie via the Hawthorne Bridge. Studies showed that this alignment would cause severe traffic bottlenecks in downtown. As a result, Portland businesses pushed for the construction of a new bridge further upstream that led to the southern end of the Portland Transit Mall. The locally preferred alignment was finalized in mid-2008; a new bridge would carry light rail across the Willamette River from the South Waterfront to just south of the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry (OMSI). TriMet designed this bridge, which was eventually inaugurated as Tilikum Crossing, to be &quot;car-free&quot; and to accommodate only transit vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians. Construction of the line began in June 2011. In September 2012, opponents passed a ballot initiative—with 60% of the vote—requiring all Clackamas County spending on light rail to be approved by voters. Following the county&#x27;s attempt to end its involvement and a suit filed by TriMet, a circuit court upheld the project&#x27;s continuation. The 17-station, Portland–Milwaukie segment and Orange Line service opened on September 12, 2015. The Orange Line, operating along the Portland Transit Mall&#x27;s southbound segment, became the third service to serve this corridor.

===Red Line track improvements and extension to Hillsboro===
In October 2017, TriMet, citing system-wide delays caused by two single-track segments along the Airport MAX, announced the MAX Red Line Improvements Project, later renamed &quot;A Better Red&quot;. &quot;A Better Red&quot; sought double-tracking a section of track north of Gateway Transit Center and another section alongside Northeast Airport Way just before the airport terminal. To qualify the project for federal funding, TriMet included extending Red Line service farther west to Fair Complex/Hillsboro Airport station in Hillsboro; this extension would use existing Westside MAX tracks and create a one-seat option from 10 additional stations to Portland International Airport. Additionally, TriMet had announced it would procure up to eight new light rail vehicles to accommodate the improvements, but later purchased 30 new trains overall; four were part of &quot;A Better Red&quot;, while the remaining 26 were replacements for the original MAX fleet, which are gradually being retired.

Preliminary design work began in February 2018. TriMet adopted a locally preferred alternative in April 2019, and the FTA announced $99.99 million for the project through the Capital Investment Grants program in May 2020. Final design was completed by engineering firm Parametrix in early 2021. The design includes two new bridges north of Gateway Transit Center to accommodate the second track and a new MAX platform called &quot;Gateway North&quot;. TriMet broke ground on September 28, 2021.

From April 2–9, 2022, Red Line service was suspended to make way for construction, and shuttle buses operated between Gateway Transit Center and Portland International Airport. The project was completed in March 2024.

From June 18 to October 21, 2023, TriMet suspended MAX service between Gateway Transit Center and the airport to allow for construction of the second track between the airport and Mount Hood Avenue.

From January 14 to March 3, 2024, TriMet suspended MAX Red, Blue and Green Line service between NE 7th and Gateway Transit Center. Inbound Red Line trains from PDX began serving Gateway North on March 4, 2024. These projects eliminated the last bidirectional single-track sections on the MAX system.

The Red Line extension to Hillsboro began service on August 25, 2024 with a soft launch, with the full launch beginning on August 28. Fair Complex/Hillsboro Airport station was also renamed to Hillsboro Airport/Fairgrounds station.

==Future plans==
TriMet works with local jurisdictions and agencies to identify and recommend priority transit projects to include in Metro&#x27;s Regional Transportation Plan (RTP). The 2018 RTP is Metro&#x27;s latest iteration, and it lists three funding scenarios that divide the region&#x27;s proposals into three priority levels. The highest priority projects, which are referred to as &quot;2027 Constrained&quot;, are proposals the region expects to have funding for by 2027. The &quot;2040 Constrained&quot; lists projects that fit within the region&#x27;s planned budget through 2040, while the &quot;2040 Strategic&quot; are projects that may be built if additional funding becomes available.

===Current projects===

The 2018 RTP lists the &quot;Southwest Corridor&quot; project which TriMet expects will be funded by 2027.

===Other proposals===

TriMet has indicated that other extensions and improvements have been studied or discussed with Metro and cities in the region. These proposals include the following, with light rail and alternatives being considered:

* Extension to Forest Grove
* Extension to Oregon City via McLoughlin Boulevard (OR 99E)
* Extension to Hillsboro via Sunset Highway (US 26)
* Extension to Vancouver, Washington

==Operation==
===Segments===

The MAX rail network is approximately long. It was built in a series of six projects starting with the Banfield—now called Eastside—segment between downtown Portland and Gresham. Each successive project has either been an extension or a branch of an existing segment. TriMet has typically paired each project with the opening of a new line, often making the line and segment synonymous (e.g. &quot;Airport MAX Red Line&quot;).

===Lines===

For MAX, a &quot;line&quot; refers to the physical railroad tracks and stations a train serves within its designated termini, i.e. a train &quot;route&quot; or &quot;service&quot;. MAX operates five lines, each assigned a color. TriMet adopted the use of colors to distinguish separately operated routes in 2000 and brought them into use on September 10, 2001, when it opened the Airport MAX extension. On that day, the service running between Hillsboro and Gresham became designated the Blue Line, while that running between downtown Portland and Portland International Airport was designated the Red Line.

Every MAX line interlines with at least one other service, particularly as it approaches the system&#x27;s central area. The Steel Bridge accommodates the most interline routes with four lines (Blue, Green, Red, and Yellow) utilizing the same tracks. TriMet has modified train routes over time, often as part of system expansions. For example, the Yellow Line, which began service in 2004, originally followed the same route into downtown Portland as the Blue and Red lines. It was realigned to the transit mall in 2009 when light rail service was introduced to that corridor.

===Right-of-way===
MAX operates on a mixture of shared and exclusive transit right-of-way. Within downtown Portland, trains run on surface streets. They operate in dedicated lanes restricted to personal vehicles, and operators abide by the city&#x27;s traffic control system. On the Morrison and Yamhill couplet, MAX travels in the left lanes. On the Portland Transit Mall (5th and 6th couplet), MAX shares dedicated lanes with buses; both vehicle types travel in the center or right lanes and stop at their respective curbside platforms on the right lane. Lanes may be separated by turtleback delineators or double-solid white lines, and marked with white diamonds or white &quot;T&quot;s.

Outside of downtown Portland, MAX runs on street medians and viaducts, alongside freeways and freight lines, and underground. Where the tracks run within a street median, intersections are controlled by traffic signals that give trains preemption. Where tracks run on a separate right-of-way, trains are protected by automated grade crossing gates when traversing level crossings. Some segments of MAX are elevated to carry trains over busy thoroughfares and difficult terrain. A section of tracks runs beneath Washington Park in Portland&#x27;s West Hills through the Robertson Tunnel, the system&#x27;s longest underground segment.

MAX crosses the Willamette River using the Steel Bridge and Tilikum Crossing. In studies conducted for the Eastside MAX, planners recommended using the Steel Bridge due to its former role as a river crossing for the city&#x27;s historic streetcars. When MAX commenced service in 1986, trains shared the bridge&#x27;s center lanes with vehicular traffic. In 2008, workers closed the bridge&#x27;s upper deck to construct a junction between the Eastside MAX tracks and the newer Portland Transit Mall tracks. Upon reopening, the two inner lanes became exclusive to MAX trains, while cars, buses, and other motorized traffic were restricted to the two outer lanes. TriMet designed and built the newer Tilikum Crossing to accommodate transit vehicles (MAX, streetcar, and buses), cyclists, and pedestrians only; with the exception of emergency responders, private vehicles are prohibited. Tilikum Crossing is thus recognized as the first major &quot;car-free&quot; bridge in the United States.

===Power and signaling===

MAX is powered by a conventional 750-volt direct current (DC) overhead wire system. Most of the system uses a dual-wire catenary, with a contact wire supported by a messenger wire. In central city areas such as downtown Portland, however, it uses a single contact wire to minimize the amount of overhead wiring. To further minimize visual impact, ornamental street light poles, buildings, and bridge structures are used to support the wiring. Substations, spaced approximately every apart, convert the high-voltage public supply to the voltage power used by trains. The power system can bridge any one substation so that trains can continue to operate should a substation or its supply go down.

Approximately 70 percent of the MAX system uses automatic block signaling (ABS), which allows for relatively fast operating speeds—up to —and short headways. For example, between Lloyd Center/Northeast 11th Avenue station and Gateway Transit Center along the Banfield Freeway, ABS can accommodate an operating headway of two minutes. Within these sections, automatic train stops (ATS) enforce speed limits and automatically apply the brakes should a train operator fail to do so. The remaining 30 percent of the system relies on traffic signals and line-of-sight operation. Speeds do not exceed in these sections.

==Maintenance facilities==
TriMet&#x27;s vehicle-maintenance complexes for the MAX system are the Ruby Junction facility in Gresham and the smaller Elmonica facility in Beaverton. The Ruby Junction facility is located near Ruby Junction/East 197th Avenue station while the Elmonica facility is adjacent to Elmonica/Southwest 170th Avenue station; both are on the Blue Line.

Ruby Junction began with one building that TriMet built as part of the original MAX project in the early 1980s; it had expanded to three multi-story buildings totaling occupying by 2010, and to four buildings totalling occupying by 2016. It contains 13 maintenance bays and its yard tracks have the capacity to store 87 light rail cars. In 2016, around 200 employees worked at Ruby Junction and almost 200 MAX operators operated trains that were based there. In addition to vehicle maintenance, crews who maintain the MAX system&#x27;s tracks and signals are also based at Ruby Junction. In 2015, some maintenance-of-way personnel moved into the Portland Vintage Trolley carbarn next to Rose Quarter Transit Center after Vintage Trolley service was discontinued.

Ruby Junction originally housed light-rail operations, communications, and administrative workers.

The Elmonica facility was built as part of the Westside MAX Project in the mid-1990s and was completed in 1996. Its building has of space.

==Stations==

MAX consists of 94 stations, of which 48 are served by the Blue Line, 30 by the Green Line, 37 by the Red Line, 17 by the Orange Line, and 17 by the Yellow Line. Furthermore, 47 stations are served by at least two lines and eight stations are served by three lines. The system&#x27;s central stations, where all MAX services interconnect, border the two city blocks in downtown Portland occupied by the Pioneer Courthouse and Pioneer Courthouse Square; they are the Pioneer Courthouse and Pioneer Place stations—served by the Green, Orange, and Yellow lines—and the Pioneer Square stations—served by the Blue and Red lines.

MAX stations vary in size but are generally simple and austere. Platforms are about long as a result of Portland&#x27;s short city blocks in downtown, which restrict trains to two-car consists. Like other North American light rail systems, MAX stations do not have faregates; paid fare zones are delineated but remain accessible to anyone. In 2015, TriMet proposed installing turnstiles at some stations along the Portland–Milwaukie segment but never did so. Stations are typically equipped with trash cans, shelters, and ticket vending machines. Most stations have arrival information displays that show when trains arrive and other service information. These displays were first installed at I-205 and Portland Transit Mall stations, and a federal grant in 2013 enabled TriMet to add more at other locations. Concessionaires sometimes open coffee shops at certain stations.

A majority of MAX stations are at street level, correlating to the system&#x27;s predominant alignment. Sunset Transit Center, , and stations along the Banfield Freeway are below street level. One station, , is elevated. Washington Park is the system&#x27;s only underground station and holds the distinction as North America&#x27;s deepest transit station at below ground.

Many MAX stations facilitate transfers to other modes of public transit. 11 stations are transit centers with connections to multiple local and intercity bus routes. Beaverton Transit Center is the only MAX-served transit center with a transfer to the region&#x27;s commuter rail line, WES Commuter Rail, which operates between Beaverton and Wilsonville in Washington County. Within the Portland Transit Mall, trains connect with buses serving downtown Portland; bus stops take up transit mall blocks unoccupied by light rail platforms. MAX riders can transfer to the Portland Streetcar at points where MAX and streetcar lines intersect and to Amtrak via two stations near Portland Union Station. The Red Line operates as an airport rail link with a stop at a MAX station attached to the main passenger terminal of Portland International Airport.

TriMet has built a total of six infill stations. Four were built on the original Eastside MAX alignment—Mall/Southwest 4th Avenue (1990), Mall/Southwest 5th Avenue (1990), Convention Center (1990), and (2010)—while two were built on the Portland Transit Mall—PSU South/Southwest 6th and College (2012) and PSU South/Southwest 5th and Jackson (2012). On March 1, 2020, TriMet permanently closed the Mall infill stations in an effort to speed up travel times in downtown Portland. The agency also closed Kings Hill/Southwest Salmon Street station (originally for a trial period, but is now permanent).

===Accessibility===
Stations built as part of the Banfield Light Rail Project were originally fitted with electric wayside lifts to accommodate riders with mobility devices on the system&#x27;s high-floor, first-generation vehicles. Each station had two lifts, one for each direction of travel. The lifts were installed on platforms rather than on trains to prevent malfunctions from delaying service. Increased use of the lifts eventually became the cause of delays, and many users felt stigmatized by the lifts&#x27; &quot;box&quot; design and time-consuming operation. After the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) was signed into law, TriMet developed a paratransit plan in January 1992. Just before the start of the Westside MAX Project, MAX became the first light rail system in North America to procure low-floor vehicles after a TriMet study of European systems. The low-floor cars, which TriMet and Siemens jointly developed, entered service in August 1997.

MAX achieved full accessibility in April 1999. Ticket vending machines provide information and instructions in audio, braille, and raised lettering. Station platforms also have signs with braille and raised lettering to indicate which lines provide service and where they go. The edge of platforms have tactile paving to warn riders from standing too close to the edge. Non-street-level platforms may be accessed with elevators. Most light rail cars, with the exception of Type 1, are low-floor and have ramps that extend onto platforms to allow mobility devices to board. High-floor Type 1 cars are paired with low-floor Type 2 or 3 cars to maintain accessibility. In each train, an audio system and LED signs announce the name of each upcoming station. All trains have spaces and priority seating areas reserved for seniors and people with disabilities, and service animals are permitted on board.

In 2011, TriMet began upgrading the oldest sections of MAX to improve pedestrian safety and compliance with updated ADA standards. TriMet installed pipe barriers at Gateway Transit Center platform crossings to force pedestrians to slow down and face oncoming trains before crossing the tracks and realigned sidewalks and crosswalks at four at-grade crossings in Gresham. Other improvements made throughout the line include the installation of pedestrian warning signals and tactile paving upgrades.

===Parking===
Based on a report published in 2019, TriMet provides a total of 12,614 park-and-ride spaces, of which 10,219 directly serve 25 MAX stations. The agency&#x27;s parking facilities are either surface lots or multi-level garages, and they are free to use. TriMet allows vehicles to park at most stalls overnight as long as they do not exceed 24 hours. At some locations, TriMet negotiates with nearby establishments for additional parking spaces. Westside MAX stations contain 3,643 parking spaces, the most number of spaces in a corridor. Clackamas Town Center Transit Center on the I-205 MAX segment includes a 750-space parking garage, the largest capacity of any single MAX station. Southeast Holgate Boulevard station, also on the I-205 MAX, provides the fewest parking spaces with 125 stalls.

In the 2019 report, passengers originating from TriMet park and rides accounted for five percent of TriMet&#x27;s total weekday ridership. In 2017, the Portland–Milwaukie segment had a 100-percent usage rate of its available spaces while the Westside MAX segment had 85 percent. The corridor with the lowest use of available parking spaces was the I-205 MAX at 30 percent; TriMet attributes this to factors such as inconvenient lot access and the Green Line&#x27;s indirect route to downtown Portland compared with the availability of more direct bus routes. The cost-per-space for building park and rides is estimated at $18,000 per surface-lot space and $52,000 per structured space.

TriMet additionally offers four different bicycle parking options at its MAX stations, although not all options are available at every station. Bike and rides are secure, enclosed spaces that are accessible by keycard and are monitored 24 hours per day by security cameras; they are available at eight stations. Electronic bicycle lockers, or eLockers, are secure lockers that may also be accessed by keycard and are made available on a first-come, first-served basis. TriMet contracts some keycard access to BikeLink and uses its Hop Fastpass on others. Other lockers may be rented by users. Bicycle racks are the most common form of bicycle parking.

==Rolling stock==

, TriMet operates six models of light rail vehicles designated as &quot;Type 1&quot; through &quot;Type 6&quot;, of which two are successive upgrades of the same model. The MAX system&#x27;s 145 cars vary in length, from to , and are used interchangeably on every line. Downtown Portland&#x27;s downtown blocks allow the operation of only one- or two-car consists to prevent stopped trains from blocking intersections. Type 2 and 3 low-floor vehicles may run singularly or coupled to another Type 1, 2, or 3 vehicle. Type 1 high-floor vehicles are also capable of running singularly, but doing so would constrain accessibility due to a lack of wheelchair access. Thus, a high-floor car must be coupled with a low-floor car. Type 4 and 5 cars can only be coupled to one another. Type 6 cars can be run as single cars or coupled with other Type 6 cars as a consist.

Twenty-six Type 1 high-floor vehicles were produced for the Banfield light rail project by a joint venture between Bombardier and La Brugeoise et Nivelles beginning in 1983. TriMet announced it would purchase seven additional vehicles that August, but a budget shortfall forced the agency to withdraw this proposal the following November. The cars are similar in design to Bombardier vehicles that had been used in Rio de Janeiro. Bombardier built the frames in Quebec but its factory in Barre, Vermont, manufactured the majority of each car, the first of which arrived in Portland in 1984. Each car is single-articulated and contains six axles. The high floors connect with the low platforms through interior steps, which necessitated platform wheelchair lifts until the arrival of low-floor cars. A car sits 76 people and has an overall capacity of 166.

In 1992, TriMet officials conducted an accessibility study and determined that low-floor cars were the most cost-effective alternative to providing universal access. MAX then became the first light rail system in North America to acquire low-floor train sets when TriMet procured 39 model SD660 cars from Siemens in 1993. These Type 2 cars were equipped with doorway wheelchair ramps. They entered service during the partial opening of the Westside MAX in 1997. By 2000, TriMet had ordered 17 more Type 2 cars including six for the Airport MAX project. The system&#x27;s 27 Type 3 vehicles, which the agency purchased as part of the Interstate MAX project and first brought into use in 2003, are the same model as the Type 2 vehicles but with technical upgrades and a new livery.

Twenty-two Siemens S70 low-floor cars, which were designated Type 4, were purchased in conjunction with the I-205 MAX and Portland Transit Mall projects, and were first used in 2009. Type 4 cars have a more streamlined design and more seating, and are lighter and more energy-efficient than the previous models. The Type 4 cars were the first in the MAX network to use LED-type destination signs. The second series of S70 cars, TriMet&#x27;s Type 5 vehicles, were procured for the Portland–Milwaukie light rail project. TriMet placed an order for the Type 5 cars with Siemens in 2012 and delivery commenced in 2014. These vehicles include some improvements over the Type 4 cars, including less-cramped interior seating, and improvements to the air-conditioning system and wheelchair ramps. These introduced a new seating layout in the center section, among other changes, and Siemens later retroactively redesignated TriMet&#x27;s Type 5 cars as model S700.

In July 2019, TriMet placed an order for 26 Siemens S700 light rail vehicles that are intended to replace the system&#x27;s Type 1 vehicles. The order was expanded to 30 cars in June 2021. The first car was delivered in December 2022, and the type is designated Type 6. In January 2025, Type 6 vehicles began entering service, with vehicles 603 and 605 being the first two cars to enter revenue service.

==Services==

From Monday to Thursday, MAX trains run for 22 hours per day. Additional late-night trips are provided on Fridays. Except for additional late-night trips on Saturdays, weekend service runs on a slightly reduced schedule. TriMet designates all MAX lines as &quot;Frequent Service&quot; routes, which ensures service runs on a 15-minute headway for most of each day. During the early morning and late evening hours, trains operate with headways of up to 30minutes. During rush hours, headways can be as short as three minutes, particularly in the central section of the system where lines overlap. At many stations, a live display shows the destination and time-to-arrival of the next several trains using data gathered by a vehicle tracking system installed on the light rail tracks.

===Ridership===
MAX carried over 38.8million total passengers in 2019, an average of 120,900 riders per day on weekdays. This is slightly lower than the number of riders recorded in 2018 and represents the system&#x27;s third consecutive year of fallen ridership. MAX ridership peaked in 2012, when the system recorded around 42.2million annual passengers. 2016 marks the last year ridership increased; this was due to the opening of the Orange Line. TriMet attributes falling ridership to perceived crime within trains and stations and lower-income riders being forced out of the inner city by rising housing prices. In 2019 (prior to the COVID-19 pandemic), MAX was the fourth-busiest light rail system in the United States after the light rail services of Metro Rail in Los Angeles, the MBTA in Boston, and Muni Metro in San Francisco.

===Fares===


As is standard practice on North American light rail systems, MAX uses proof-of-payment for fare collection, and stations do not have ticket barriers. TriMet employs an automated fare collection system through a stored-value, contactless smart card called Hop Fastpass, which can be purchased from the TriMet ticket office or participating retail outlets. Smartphone users may download a virtual version of Hop Fastpass, while single-use Hop Fastpass tickets are dispensed by ticket vending machines at every MAX station. Smartphones with a debit or credit card loaded into Google Pay, Samsung Pay, or Apple Pay, and Portland Streetcar 2-hour tickets and one-day passes can also be used to board MAX. Riders must tap their fare medium onto a card reader with each boarding. Fares are flat rate and are capped according to use. Using Hop Fastpass, riders may transfer to the Portland Streetcar and other TriMet and C-Tran services.

===Late-night bus service===

On August 25, 2024, TriMet introduced four new bus routes to replace late-night MAX services, to expand the length of time available each night for routine overnight maintenance. The new routes replace the last one or two MAX trips of the night on the Blue (two bus routes), Red, and Yellow Lines, but not the Green Line. This practice had already been in effect on the Orange Line since its opening in 2015.

===Discontinued services===
From the MAX system&#x27;s opening until 2012, riding trains within Fareless Square, which was known as the Free Rail Zone from 2010 to 2012, was free of charge. Fareless Square included all of downtown and, starting in 2001, part of the Lloyd District. The 37-year-old fare-free zone was discontinued on September 1, 2012, as part of system-wide cost-cutting measures. As part of the same budget cuts, TriMet discontinued its zonal fares and moved to a flat-fare system. Zones had been in place since 1986; higher fares were charged for longer journeys across four paid zones.

The MAX Mall Shuttle operated on weekday afternoons from when it was introduced on September 14, 2009, until 2011. It acted as a supplement to the light rail service provided on the Portland Transit Mall by the Green and Yellow lines. The Mall Shuttle operated between Union Station and Portland State University every 30 minutes from noon until 5:30p.m. TriMet discontinued this supplementary shuttle service on June 5, 2011. Along with bus services, the mall continues to be served by two MAX lines in each direction—Green and Yellow lines northbound and Green and Orange lines southbound—which provide a combined average headway of 7.5 minutes in each direction at most times.

The Portland Vintage Trolley operated on the MAX system on most weekends from 1991 until 2014, serving the same stops. This service used 1991-built replicas of 1904 Portland streetcars. Originally, the Vintage Trolley service followed a section of the original MAX line between the Library and Galleria stations and Lloyd Center. In September 2009, the service moved to the newly opened MAX alignment along the transit mall, running between Union Station to Portland State University, and remained on this route in subsequent seasons. In 2011, the service was reduced to seven or eight Sundays per year, and in July 2014 it was discontinued entirely and the two remaining faux-vintage cars were sold to a group planning a streetcar line in St. Louis.

==Safety==
TriMet employs a transit police division to patrol MAX and other TriMet property. Most of its officers serve with local law enforcement agencies and are assigned terms with the transit police; this partnership with local police enables the closest available unit to respond to incidents. TriMet also partners with the Transportation Security Administration, which provides a canine unit. Riders are encouraged to alert TriMet employees using on-board intercoms or to dial 9-1-1 upon witnessing a crime or suspicious activity. TriMet operates over 4,000 security cameras; all MAX trains and stations became fully equipped with cameras in 2014.

===2017 train stabbing incident===
On May 26, 2017, at approximately 4:30pm, a man fatally stabbed two people and injured a third after he was confronted for shouting anti-Muslim slurs at two teenage girls inside a MAX train. Two men—a technician and U.S. Army veteran, and a recent university graduate—died from wounds to their necks while a third male victim survived. The attacker, who described himself as a white nationalist, was arrested and charged with murder, attempted murder, and other crimes. On February 21, 2020, the perpetrator was found guilty on all charges, including two counts of first-degree murder. This resulted in a mural being painted on the station entrance of the Hollywood Transit Center, where the stabbing occurred.

===2023 Portland Streetcar collision===

On November 15, 2023, shortly after 10:00am, a MAX train collided with a Portland Streetcar in the Lloyd District and injured two people on board.

<doc id="148819" wikidata="Q1256668" url="?curid=148819" title="Foucault's measurements of the speed of light">
<text>In 1850, Léon Foucault used a rotating mirror to perform a differential measurement of the speed of light in water versus its speed in air. In 1862, he used a similar apparatus to measure the speed of light in the air.

==Background==

In 1834, Charles Wheatstone developed a method of using a rapidly rotating mirror to study transient phenomena, and applied this method to measure the velocity of electricity in a wire and the duration of an electric spark. He communicated to François Arago the idea that his method could be adapted to a study of the speed of light.

The early-to-mid 1800s were a period of intense debate on the particle-versus-wave nature of light. Although the observation of the Arago spot in 1819 may have seemed to settle the matter definitively in favor of Fresnel&#x27;s wave theory of light, various concerns continued to appear to be addressed more satisfactorily by Newton&#x27;s corpuscular theory. Arago expanded upon Wheatstone&#x27;s concept in an 1838 publication, suggesting that a differential comparison of the speed of light in the air &quot;versus&quot; water would serve to distinguish between the particle and wave theories of light.

Foucault had worked with Hippolyte Fizeau on projects such as using the Daguerreotype process to take images of the Sun between 1843 and 1845 and characterizing absorption bands in the infrared spectrum of sunlight in 1847. In 1845, Arago suggested to Fizeau and Foucault that they attempt to measure the speed of light. Sometime in 1849, however, it appears that the two had a falling out, and they parted ways. In 1848−49, Fizeau used, not a rotating mirror, but a toothed wheel apparatus to perform an absolute measurement of the speed of light in air.

In 1850, Fizeau and Foucault both used rotating mirror devices to perform relative measures of the speed of light in the air &quot;versus&quot; water.

Foucault employed Paul-Gustave Froment to build a rotary-mirror apparatus in which he split a beam of light into two beams, passing one through the water while the other traveled through air. On 27 April 1850, he confirmed that the speed of light was greater as it traveled through the air, seemingly validating the wave theory of light.

With Arago&#x27;s blessing, Fizeau employed L.F.C. Breguet to construct his apparatus. They achieved their result on 17 June 1850, seven weeks after Foucault.

To achieve the high rotational speeds necessary, Foucault abandoned clockwork and used a carefully balanced steam-powered apparatus designed by Charles Cagniard de la Tour. Foucault originally used tin-mercury mirrors, however at speeds exceeding 200 rps, the reflecting layer would break off, so he switched to using new silver mirrors.

==Foucault&#x27;s determination of the speed of light==
===1850 experiment===

In 1850, Léon Foucault measured the relative speeds of light in air and water. The experiment was proposed by Arago, who wrote, 

The apparatus (Figure 1) involves light passing through slit &quot;S&quot;, reflecting off a mirror &quot;R&quot;, and forming an image of the slit on the distant stationary mirror &quot;M&quot;. The light then passes back to mirror &quot;R&quot; and is reflected back to the original slit. If mirror &quot;R&quot; is stationary, then the slit image will reform at &quot;S&quot;.

However, if the mirror &quot;R&quot; is rotating, it will have moved slightly in the time it takes for the light to bounce from &quot;R&quot; to &quot;M&quot; and back, and the light will be deflected away from the original source by a small angle, forming an image to the &quot;side&quot; of the slit.

Foucault measured the differential speed of light through air versus water by using two distant mirrors (Figure 2). He placed a 3-meter tube of water before one of them. The light passing through the slower medium has its image more displaced. By partially masking the air-path mirror, Foucault was able to distinguish the two images super-imposed on top of one another. He found the speed of light was slower in water than in air.

This experiment did not determine the absolute speeds of light in water or air, only their relative speeds. The rotational speed of the mirror could not be sufficiently accurately measured to determine the absolute speeds of light in water or air. With a rotational speed of 600-800 revolutions per second, the displacement was 0.2 to 0.3 mm.

Guided by similar motivations as his former partner, Foucault in 1850 was more interested in settling the particle-versus-wave debate than in determining an accurate absolute value for the speed of light. His experimental results, announced shortly before Fizeau announced his results on the same topic, were viewed as &quot;driving the last nail in the coffin&quot; of Newton&#x27;s corpuscle theory of light when it showed that light travels more slowly through water than through air. Newton had explained refraction as a &quot;pull&quot; of the medium upon the light, implying an increased speed of light in the medium. The corpuscular theory of light went into abeyance, completely overshadowed by the wave theory. This state of affairs lasted until 1905, when Einstein presented heuristic arguments that under various circumstances, such as when considering the photoelectric effect, light exhibits behaviors indicative of a particle nature.

For his efforts, Foucault was made &quot;chevalier&quot; of the Légion d&#x27;honneur, and in 1853 was awarded a doctorate from the Sorbonne.

===1862 experiment===

In Foucault&#x27;s 1862 experiment, he desired to obtain an accurate absolute value for the speed of light, since his concern was to deduce an improved value for the astronomical unit. At the time, Foucault was working at the Paris Observatory under Urbain le Verrier. It was le Verrier&#x27;s belief, based on extensive celestial mechanics calculations, that the consensus value for the speed of light was perhaps 4% too high. Technical limitations prevented Foucault from separating mirrors R and M by more than about 20 meters. Despite this limited path length, Foucault was able to measure the displacement of the slit image (less than 1 mm) with considerable accuracy. In addition, unlike the case with Fizeau&#x27;s experiment (which required gauging the rotation rate of an adjustable-speed toothed wheel), he could spin the mirror at a constant, chronometrically determined speed. Foucault&#x27;s measurement confirmed le Verrier&#x27;s estimate. His 1862 figure for the speed of light (298000 km/s) was within 0.6% of the modern value.

As seen in Figure 3, the displaced image of the source (slit) is at an angle 2&quot;θ&quot; from the source direction.

==Michelson&#x27;s refinement of the Foucault experiment==
It was seen in Figure 1 that Foucault placed the rotating mirror R as close as possible to lens L so as to maximize the distance between R and the slit S. As R rotates, an enlarged image of slit S sweeps across the face of the distant mirror M. The greater the distance RM, the more quickly that the image sweeps across mirror M and the less light is reflected back. Foucault could not increase the RM distance in his folded optical arrangement beyond about 20 meters without the image of the slit becoming too dim to accurately measure.

Between 1877 and 1931, Albert A. Michelson made multiple measurements of the speed of light. His 1877–79 measurements were performed under the auspices of Simon Newcomb, who was also working on measuring the speed of light. Michelson&#x27;s setup incorporated several refinements on Foucault&#x27;s original arrangement. As seen in Figure 4, Michelson placed the rotating mirror R near the principal focus of lens L (&quot;i.e.&quot; the focal point given incident parallel rays of light). If the rotating mirror R were exactly at the principal focus, the moving image of the slit would remain upon the distant plane mirror M (equal in diameter to lens L) as long as the axis of the pencil of light remained on the lens, this being true regardless of the RM distance. Michelson was thus able to increase the RM distance to nearly 2000 feet. To achieve a reasonable value for the RS distance, Michelson used an extremely long focal length lens (150 feet) and compromised on the design by placing R about 15 feet closer to L than the principal focus. This allowed an RS distance of between 28.5 to 33.3 feet. He used carefully calibrated tuning forks to monitor the rotation rate of the air-turbine-powered mirror R, and he would typically measure displacements of the slit image on the order of 115 mm. His 1879 figure for the speed of light, 299944±51 km/s, was within about 0.05% of the modern value. His 1926 repeat of the experiment incorporated still further refinements such as the use of polygonal prism-shaped rotating mirrors (enabling a brighter image) having from eight through sixteen facets and a 22 mile baseline surveyed to fractional parts-per-million accuracy. His figure of 299,796±4 km/s was only about 4 km/s higher than the current accepted value. Michelson&#x27;s final 1931 attempt to measure the speed of light in vacuum was interrupted by his death. Although his experiment was completed posthumously by F. G. Pease and F. Pearson, various factors militated against a measurement of highest accuracy, including an earthquake which disturbed the baseline measurement.

<text>A symphonic poem or tone poem is a piece of orchestral music, usually in a single continuous movement, which illustrates or evokes the content of a poem, short story, novel, painting, landscape, or other (non-musical) source. The German term (tone poem) appears to have been first used by the composer Carl Loewe in 1828. The Hungarian composer Franz Liszt first applied the term to his 13 works in this vein, which commenced in 1848.

== Background ==
While many symphonic poems may compare in size and scale to symphonic movements (or even reach the length of an entire symphony), they are unlike traditional classical symphonic movements, in that their music is intended to inspire listeners to imagine or consider scenes, images, specific ideas or moods, and not (necessarily) to focus on following traditional patterns of musical form such as sonata form. This intention to inspire listeners was a direct consequence of Romanticism, which encouraged literary, pictorial and dramatic associations in music. According to the musicologist Hugh Macdonald, the symphonic poem met three 19th-century aesthetic goals: it related music to outside sources; it often combined or compressed multiple movements into a single principal section; and it elevated instrumental program music to an aesthetic level that could be regarded as equivalent to, or higher than opera. The symphonic poem remained a popular composition form from the 1840s until the 1920s, when composers began to abandon the genre.

Symphonic poems are thought to bridge the gap between different modes of expression. Much research has been done on the semiotic relationship between symphonic poems and their extra-musical inspiration, such as art, literature and nature. Composers used many different musical gestures to evoke a non-musical concept. Some musical gestures appear to be literal representations of their non-musical counterparts. For example, Sergei Rachmaninoff uses an uneven 5/8 time signature throughout &quot;The Isle of the Dead&quot; in order to suggest the rocking of a boat. In Richard Strauss’s &quot;Death and Transfiguration&quot;, the composer uses the orchestra to mimic the sound of an irregular heartbeat and labored breathing. Other musical gestures capture the essence of the subject on a more abstract level. For example, In Franz Liszt’s &quot;Hamlet&quot;, Liszt portrays the complex relation between Hamlet and Ophelia by juxtaposing a somber motif that is harmonically inconclusive (Hamlet) against a tranquil and harmonically conclusive motif (Ophelia), and developing the music from these principles. In &quot;Death and Transfiguration&quot;, a sprightly melody in a major key evokes childhood.

Some piano and chamber works, such as Arnold Schoenberg&#x27;s string sextet &quot;Verklärte Nacht&quot;, have similarities with symphonic poems in their overall intent and effect. However, the term symphonic poem is generally accepted to refer to orchestral works. A symphonic poem may stand on its own (as do those of Richard Strauss), or it can be part of a series combined into a symphonic suite or cycle. For example, &quot;The Swan of Tuonela&quot; (1895) is a tone poem from Jean Sibelius&#x27;s &quot;Lemminkäinen Suite&quot;, and &quot;Vltava&quot; (&quot;The Moldau&quot;) by Bedřich Smetana is part of the six-work cycle &quot;Má vlast&quot;.

While the terms &quot;symphonic poem&quot; and &quot;tone poem&quot; have often been used interchangeably, some composers such as Richard Strauss and Jean Sibelius have preferred the latter term for their works.

The first use of the German term &quot;Tondichtung&quot; (tone poem) appears to have been by Carl Loewe, applied not to an orchestral work but to his piece for piano solo, &quot;Mazeppa&quot;, Op. 27 (1828), based on the poem of that name by Lord Byron, and written twelve years before Liszt treated the same subject orchestrally.

The musicologist Mark Bonds suggests that in the second quarter of the 19th century, the future of the symphonic genre seemed uncertain. While many composers continued to write symphonies during the 1820s and &#x27;30s, &quot;there were a growing sense that these works were aesthetically far inferior to Beethoven&#x27;s... The real question was not so much whether symphonies could still be written, but whether the genre could continue to flourish and grow.&quot; Felix Mendelssohn, Robert Schumann and Niels Gade achieved successes with their symphonies, putting at least a temporary stop to the debate as to whether the genre was dead. Nevertheless, composers began to explore the &quot;more compact form&quot; of the concert overture &quot;...as a vehicle within which to blend musical, narrative and pictoral ideas.&quot; Examples included Mendelssohn&#x27;s overtures &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; (1826) and &quot;The Hebrides&quot; (1830).

Between 1845 and 1847, the Belgian composer César Franck wrote an orchestral piece based on Victor Hugo&#x27;s poem &quot;Ce qu&#x27;on entend sur la montagne&quot;. The work exhibits characteristics of a symphonic poem, and some musicologists, such as Norman Demuth and Julien Tiersot, consider it the first of its genre, preceding Liszt&#x27;s compositions. However, Franck did not publish or perform his piece; neither did he set about defining the genre. Liszt&#x27;s determination to explore and promote the symphonic poem gained him recognition as the genre&#x27;s inventor. The idea of the symphonic poem, was a new musical concept for Listz. He wanted a new way to engage the audience. The symphonic poem invented by Liszt had the main theme heard at the start of the piece, then develop through thematic transformation, never leaving behind musical coherence.

==Liszt==
The Hungarian composer Franz Liszt desired to expand single-movement works beyond the concert overture form. The music of overtures is to inspire listeners to imagine scenes, images, or moods; Liszt intended to combine those programmatic qualities with a scale and musical complexity normally reserved for the opening movement of classical symphonies. The opening movement, with its interplay of contrasting themes under sonata form, was normally considered the most important part of the symphony. To achieve his objectives, Liszt needed a more flexible method of developing musical themes than sonata form would allow, but one that would preserve the overall unity of a musical composition.

Liszt found his method through two compositional practices, which he used in his symphonic poems. The first practice was cyclic form, a procedure established by Beethoven in which certain movements are not only linked but actually reflect one another&#x27;s content. Liszt took Beethoven&#x27;s practice one step further, combining separate movements into a single-movement cyclic structure. Many of Liszt&#x27;s mature works follow this pattern, of which &quot;Les préludes&quot; is one of the best-known examples. The second practice was thematic transformation, a type of variation in which one theme is changed, not into a related or subsidiary theme but into something new, separate and independent. As musicologist Hugh Macdonald wrote of Liszt&#x27;s works in this genre, the intent was &quot;to display the traditional logic of symphonic thought;&quot; that is, to display a comparable complexity in the interplay of musical themes and tonal &#x27;landscape&#x27; to those of the Romantic symphony.

Thematic transformation, like cyclic form, was nothing new in itself. It had been previously used by Mozart and Haydn. In the final movement of his Ninth Symphony, Beethoven had transformed the theme of the &quot;Ode to Joy&quot; into a Turkish march. Weber and Berlioz had also transformed themes, and Schubert used thematic transformation to bind together the movements of his &quot;Wanderer Fantasy&quot;, a work that had a tremendous influence on Liszt. However, Liszt perfected the creation of significantly longer formal structures solely through thematic transformation, not only in the symphonic poems but in others works such as his Second Piano Concerto and his Piano Sonata in B minor. In fact, when a work had to be shortened, Liszt tended to cut sections of conventional musical development and preserve sections of thematic transformation.

While Liszt had been inspired to some extent by the ideas of Richard Wagner in unifying ideas of drama and music via the symphonic poem, Wagner gave Liszt&#x27;s concept only lukewarm support in his 1857 essay &quot;On the Symphonic Poems of Franz Liszt&quot;, and was later to break entirely with Liszt&#x27;s Weimar circle over their aesthetic ideals.

==Czech composers==
Composers who developed the symphonic poem after Liszt were mainly Bohemian, Russian, and French; the Bohemians and Russians showed the potential of the form as a vehicle for the nationalist ideas fomenting in their respective countries at this time. Bedřich Smetana visited Liszt in Weimar in the summer of 1857, where he heard the first performances of the &quot;Faust Symphony&quot; and the symphonic poem &quot;Die Ideale&quot;. Influenced by Liszt&#x27;s efforts, Smetana began a series of symphonic works based on literary subjects—&quot;Richard III&quot; (1857–58), &quot;Wallenstein&#x27;s Camp&quot; (1858–59) and &quot;Hakon Jarl&quot; (1860–61). A piano work dating from the same period, &quot;Macbeth a čarodějnice&quot; (&quot;Macbeth and the Witches&quot;, 1859), is similar in scope but bolder in style. Musicologist John Clapham writes that Smetana planned these works as &quot;a compact series of episodes&quot; drawn from their literary sources &quot;and approached them as a dramatist rather than as a poet or philosopher.&quot; He used musical themes to represent specific characters; in this manner he more closely followed the practice of French composer Hector Berlioz in his choral symphony &quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot; than that of Liszt. By doing so, Hugh Macdonald writes, Smetana followed &quot;a straightforward pattern of musical description&quot;.
Smetana&#x27;s set of six symphonic poems published under the general title of &quot;Má vlast&quot; became his greatest achievements in the genre. Composed between 1872 and 1879, the cycle embodies its composer&#x27;s personal belief in the greatness of the Czech nation while presenting selected episodes and ideas from Czech history. Two recurrent musical themes unify the entire cycle. One theme represents Vyšehrad, the fortress over the river Vltava whose course provides the subject matter for the second (and best-known) work in the cycle; the other is the ancient Czech hymn &quot;Ktož jsú boží bojovníci&quot; (&quot;Ye who are God&#x27;s warriors&quot;), which unites the cycle&#x27;s last two poems, &quot;Tábor&quot; and &quot;Blaník.&quot;

While expanding the form to a unified cycle of symphonic poems, Smetana created what Macdonald terms &quot;one of the monuments of Czech music&quot; and, Clapham writes, &quot;extended the scope and purpose of the symphonic poem beyond the aims of any later composer&quot;. Clapham adds that in his musical depiction of scenery in these works, Smetana &quot;established a new type of symphonic poem, which led eventually to Sibelius&#x27;s &quot;Tapiola&quot;&quot;. Also, in showing how to apply new forms for new purposes, Macdonald writes that Smetana &quot;began a profusion of symphonic poems from his younger contemporaries in the Czech lands and Slovakia&quot;, including Antonín Dvořák, Zdeněk Fibich, Leoš Janáček and Vítězslav Novák.

Dvořák wrote two groups of symphonic poems, which date from the 1890s. The first, which Macdonald variously calls symphonic poems and overtures, forms a cycle similar to &quot;Má vlast&quot;, with a single musical theme running through all three pieces. Originally conceived as a trilogy to be titled &quot;Příroda, Život a Láska&quot; (&quot;Nature, Life and Love&quot;), they appeared instead as three separate works, &quot;V přírodě&quot; (&quot;In Nature&#x27;s Realm&quot;), &quot;Carnival&quot; and &quot;Othello&quot;. The score for &quot;Othello&quot; contains notes from the Shakespeare play, showing that Dvořák meant to write it as a programmatic work; however, the sequence of events and characters portrayed does not correspond to the notes.

The second group of symphonic poems comprises five works. Four of them—&quot;The Water Goblin&quot;, &quot;The Noon Witch&quot;, &quot;The Golden Spinning Wheel&quot; and &quot;The Wild Dove&quot;—are based on poems from Karel Jaromír Erben&#x27;s &quot;Kytice&quot; (&quot;Bouquet&quot;) collection of fairy tales. In these four poems, Dvořák assigns specific musical themes for important characters and events in the drama. For &quot;The Golden Spinning Wheel&quot;, Dvořák arrived at these themes by setting lines from the poems to music. He also follows Liszt and Smetana&#x27;s example of thematic transformation, metamorphosing the king&#x27;s theme in &quot;The Golden Spinning Wheel&quot; to represent the wicked stepmother and also the mysterious, kindly old man found in the tale. Macdonald writes that while these works may seem diffuse by symphonic standards, their literary sources actually define the sequence of events and the course of the musical action. Clapham adds that while Dvořák may follow the narrative complexities of &quot;The Golden Spinning Wheel&quot; too closely, &quot;the lengthy repetition at the beginning of &quot;The Noon Witch&quot; shows Dvořák temporarily rejecting a precise representation of the ballad for the sake of an initial musical balance&quot;. The fifth poem, &quot;Heroic Song&quot;, is the only one not to have a detailed program.

==Russia==
The development of the symphonic poem in Russia, as in the Czech lands, stemmed from an admiration for Liszt&#x27;s music and a devotion to national subjects. Added to this was the Russian love of story-telling, for which the genre seemed expressly tailored, and led critic Vladimir Stasov to write, &quot;Virtually all Russian music is programmatic&quot;. Macdonald writes that Stasov and the patriotic group of composers known as The Five or The Mighty Handful, went so far as to hail Mikhail Glinka&#x27;s &quot;Kamarinskaya&quot; as &quot;a prototype of Russian descriptive music&quot;; despite the fact that Glinka himself denied the piece had any program, he called the work, which is based entirely on Russian folk music, &quot;picturesque music.&quot; In this Glinka was influenced by French composer Hector Berlioz, whom he met in the summer of 1844.
At least three of the Five fully embraced the symphonic poem. Mily Balakirev&#x27;s &quot;Tamara&quot; (1867–82) richly evokes the fairy-tale orient and, while remaining closely based on the poem by Mikhail Lermontov, remains well-paced and full of atmosphere. Balakirev&#x27;s other two symphonic poems, &quot;In Bohemia&quot; (1867, 1905) and &quot;Russia&quot; (1884 version) lack the same narrative content; they are actually looser collections of national melodies and were originally written as concert overtures. Macdonald calls Modest Mussorgsky&#x27;s &quot;Night on Bald Mountain&quot; and Alexander Borodin&#x27;s &quot;In the Steppes of Central Asia&quot; &quot;powerful orchestral pictures, each unique in its composer&#x27;s output&quot;. Titled a &quot;musical portrait&quot;, &quot;In the Steppes of Central Asia&quot; evokes the journey of a caravan across the steppes. &quot;Night on Bald Mountain&quot;, especially its original version, contains harmony that is often striking, sometimes pungent and highly abrasive; its initial stretches especially pull the listener into a world of uncompromisingly brutal directness and energy.

Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov wrote only two orchestral works that rank as symphonic poems, his &quot;musical tableau&quot; &quot;Sadko&quot; (1867–92) and &quot;Skazka&quot; (&quot;Legend&quot;, 1879–80), originally titled &quot;Baba-Yaga&quot;. While this may perhaps be surprising, considering his love for Russian folklore, both his symphonic suites &quot;Antar&quot; and &quot;Scheherazade&quot; are conceived in a similar manner to these works. Russian folklore also provided material for symphonic poems by Alexander Dargomyzhsky, Anatoly Lyadov and Alexander Glazunov. Glazunov&#x27;s &quot;Stenka Razin&quot; and Lyadov&#x27;s &quot;Baba-Yaga&quot; &quot;Kikimora&quot; and &quot;The Enchanted Lake&quot; are all based on national subjects. The Lyadov works&#x27; lack of purposeful harmonic rhythm (an absence less noticeable in &quot;Baba-Yaga&quot; and &quot;Kikimora&quot; due to a superficial but still exhilarating bustle and whirl) produces a sense of unreality and timelessness much like the telling of an oft-repeated and much loved fairy tale.

While none of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky&#x27;s symphonic poems has a Russian subject, they hold musical form and literary material in fine balance. (Tchaikovsky did not call &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; a symphonic poem but rather a &quot;fantasy-overture&quot;, and the work may actually be closer to a concert overture in its relatively stringent use of sonata form. It was the suggestion of the work&#x27;s musical mid-wife, Balakirev, to base &quot;Romeo&quot; structurally on his &quot;King Lear&quot;, a tragic overture in sonata form after the example of Beethoven&#x27;s overtures.) R.W.S. Mendl, writing in &quot;The Musical Quarterly&quot;, states that Tchaikovsky was by temperament peculiarly well-fitted for the composition of symphonic poems. Even his works in other instrumental forms are very free in structure and frequently partake of the nature of programme music.

Among later Russian symphonic poems, Sergei Rachmaninoff&#x27;s &quot;The Rock&quot; shows as much the influence of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s work as &quot;Isle of the Dead&quot; (1909) does its independence from it. A similar debt to his teacher Rimsky-Korsakov imbues Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;The Song of the Nightingale&quot;, excerpted from his opera &quot;The Nightingale&quot;. Alexander Scriabin&#x27;s &quot;The Poem of Ecstasy&quot; (1905–08) and &quot;&quot; (1908–10), in their projection of an egocentric theosophic world unequalled in other symphonic poems, are notable for their detail and advanced harmonic idiom.

Socialist realism in the Soviet Union allowed program music to survive longer there than in western Europe, as typified by Dmitri Shostakovich&#x27;s symphonic poem &quot;October&quot; (1967).

==France==

While France was less concerned than other countries with nationalism, it still had a well-established tradition of narrative and illustrative music reaching back to Berlioz and Félicien David. For this reason, French composers were attracted to the poetic elements of the symphonic poem. In fact, César Franck had written an orchestral piece based on Hugo&#x27;s poem &quot;Ce qu&#x27;on entend sur la montagne&quot; before Liszt did so himself as his first numbered symphonic poem.

The symphonic poem came into vogue in France in the 1870s, supported by the newly founded Société Nationale and its promotion of younger French composers. In the year after its foundation, 1872, Camille Saint-Saëns composed his &quot;Le rouet d&#x27;Omphale&quot;, soon following it with three more, the most famous of which became the &quot;Danse macabre&quot; (1874). In all four of these works Saint-Saëns experimented with orchestration and thematic transformation. &quot;La jeunesse d&#x27;Hercule&quot; (1877) was written closest in style to Liszt. The other three concentrate on some physical movement—spinning, riding, dancing—which is portrayed in musical terms. He had previously experimented with thematic transformation in his program overture &quot;Spartacus&quot;; he would later use it in his Fourth Piano Concerto and Third Symphony.

After Saint-Saëns came Vincent d&#x27;Indy. While d&#x27;Indy called his trilogy &quot;Wallenstein&quot; (1873, 1879–81) &quot;three symphonic overtures&quot;, the cycle is similar to Smetana&#x27;s &quot;Má vlast&quot; in overall scope. Henri Duparc&#x27;s &quot;Lenore&quot; (1875) displayed a Wagnerian warmth in its writing and orchestration. Franck wrote the delicately evocative &quot;Les Éolides&quot;, following it with the narrative &quot;Le Chasseur maudit&quot; and the piano-and-orchestral tone poem &quot;Les Djinns&quot;, conceived in much the same manner as Liszt&#x27;s &quot;Totentanz&quot;. Ernest Chausson&#x27;s &quot;Vivane&quot; illustrates the penchant shown by the Franck circle for mythological subjects.
Claude Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Prélude à l&#x27;après-midi d&#x27;un faune&quot; (1892–94), intended initially as part of a triptych, is, in the composer&#x27;s words, &quot;a very free ... succession of settings through which the Faun&#x27;s desires and dreams move in the afternoon heat.&quot; Paul Dukas&#x27; &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; follows the narrative vein of symphonic poem, while Maurice Ravel&#x27;s &quot;La valse&quot; (1921) is considered by some critics a parody of Vienna in an idiom no Viennese would recognize as his own. Albert Roussel&#x27;s first symphonic poem, based on Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s novel &quot;Resurrection&quot; (1903), was soon followed by &quot;Le Poème de forêt&quot; (1904–06), which is in four movements written in cyclic form. &quot;Pour une fête de printemps&quot; (1920), initially conceived as the slow movement of his Second Symphony. Charles Koechlin also wrote several symphonic poems, the best known of which are included in his cycle based on &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; by Rudyard Kipling. Through these works, he defended the viability of the symphonic poem long after it had gone out of vogue.

==Germany==
Both Liszt and Richard Strauss worked in Germany, but while Liszt may have invented the symphonic poem and Strauss brought it to its highest point, overall the form was less well received there than in other countries. Johannes Brahms and Richard Wagner dominated the German musical scene, but neither wrote symphonic poems; instead, they devoted themselves completely to music drama (Wagner) and absolute music (Brahms). Therefore, other than Strauss and numerous concert overtures by others, there are only isolated symphonic poems by German and Austrian composers—Hugo Wolf&#x27;s &quot; Penthesilea&quot; (1883–85), Alexander von Zemlinsky&#x27;s &quot; Die Seejungfrau &quot; (1902-03) and Arnold Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;Pelleas und Melisande&quot; (1902–03). Because of its clear relationship between poem and music, Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;Verklärte Nacht&quot; (1899) for string sextet has been characterised as a non-orchestral &#x27;symphonic poem&#x27;.

Alexander Ritter, who himself composed six symphonic poems in the vein of Liszt&#x27;s works, directly influenced Richard Strauss in writing program music. Strauss wrote on a wide range of subjects, some of which had been previously considered unsuitable to set to music, including literature, legend, philosophy and autobiography. The list includes &quot;Macbeth&quot; (1886–87), &quot;Don Juan&quot; (1888–89), &quot;Death and Transfiguration&quot; (1888–89), &quot;Till Eulenspiegel&#x27;s Merry Pranks&quot; (1894–95), &quot;Also sprach Zarathustra&quot; (&quot;Thus Spoke Zoroaster&quot;, 1896), &quot;Don Quixote&quot; (1897), &quot;Ein Heldenleben&quot; (&quot;A Hero&#x27;s Life&quot;, 1897–98), &quot;Symphonia Domestica&quot; (&quot;Domestic Symphony&quot;, 1902–03) and &quot;An Alpine Symphony&quot; (1911–1915).

In these works, Strauss takes realism in orchestral depiction to unprecedented lengths, widening the expressive functions of program music as well as extending its boundaries. Because of his virtuosic use of orchestration, the descriptive power and vividness of these works is extremely marked. He usually employs a large orchestra, often with extra instruments, and he often uses instrumental effects for sharp characterization, such as portraying the bleating of sheep with &quot;cuivré&quot; brass in &quot;Don Quixote&quot;. Strauss&#x27;s handling of form is also worth noting, both in his use of thematic transformation and his handling of multiple themes in intricate counterpoint. His use of variation form in &quot;Don Quixote&quot; is handled exceptionally well, as is his use of rondo form in &quot;Till Eulenspiegel&quot;. As Hugh Macdonald points out in the &quot;New Grove&quot; (1980), &quot;Strauss liked to use a simple but descriptive theme—for instance the three-note motif at the opening of &quot;Also sprach Zarathustra&quot;, or striding, vigorous arpeggios to represent the manly qualities of his heroes. His love themes are honeyed and chromatic and generally richly scored, and he is often fond of the warmth and serenity of diatonic harmony as balm after torrential chromatic textures, notably at the end of &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, where the solo cello has a surpassingly beautiful D major transformation of the main theme.&quot;

==Other countries and decline==

Jean Sibelius showed a great affinity for the form, writing well over a dozen symphonic poems and numerous shorter works. These works span his entire career, from &quot;En saga&quot; (1892) to &quot;Tapiola&quot; (1926), expressing more clearly than anything else his identification to Finland and its mythology. The &quot;Kalevala&quot; provided ideal episodes and texts for musical setting; this coupled with Sibelius&#x27;s natural aptitude for symphonic writing allowed him to write taut, organic structures for many of these works, especially &quot;Tapiola&quot; (1926). &quot;Pohjola&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1906), which Sibelius called a &quot;symphonic fantasy&quot;, is the most closely dependent on its program while also showing a sureness of outline rare in other composers. With the compositional approach he took from the Third Symphony onward, Sibelius sought to overcome the distinction between symphony and tone poem to fuse their most basic principles—the symphony&#x27;s traditional claims of weight, musical abstraction, gravitas and formal dialogue with seminal works of the past; and the tone poem&#x27;s structural innovation and spontaneity, identifiable poetic content and inventive sonority. However, the stylistic distinction between symphony, &quot;fantasy&quot; and tone poem in Sibelius&#x27;s late works becomes blurred since ideas first sketched for one piece ended up in another. One of Sibelius&#x27;s greatest works, Finlandia, focuses on Finnish independence. He wrote it in 1901 and added choral lyrics – the &quot;Finlandia&quot; hymn by Veikko Antero Koskenniemi – to the central part after Finland became independent.

The symphonic poem did not enjoy as clear a sense of national identity in other countries, even though numerous works of the kind were written. Composers included Arnold Bax and Frederick Delius in Great Britain; Edward MacDowell, Howard Hanson, Ferde Grofé and George Gershwin in the United States; Carl Nielsen in Denmark; Zygmunt Noskowski and Mieczysław Karłowicz in Poland and Ottorino Respighi in Italy. Also, with the rejection of Romantic ideals in the 20th century and their replacement with ideals of abstraction and independence of music, the writing of symphonic poems went into decline.

<doc id="148828" wikidata="Q3519338" url="?curid=148828" title="Texas Guinan">
<text>Mary Louise Cecilia &quot;Texas&quot; Guinan (January 12, 1884 – November 5, 1933) was an American actress, producer,
and entrepreneur. Born in Texas to Irish immigrant parents, Guinan decided at an early age to become an entertainer. After becoming a star on the New York stage, the repercussions of her involvement in a weight loss scam motivated her to switch careers to the film business. Spending several years in California appearing in numerous productions, she eventually formed her own company.

She is most remembered for the speakeasy clubs she managed during Prohibition. Her clubs catered to the rich and famous, as well as to aspiring talent. After being arrested and indicted during a law enforcement sweep of speakeasy clubs, she was acquitted when her case went to trial.

==Personal life and early career==
Guinan was one of four siblings born in Waco, Texas, to Irish immigrants Michael and Bessie (née Duffy) Guinan, who had emigrated separately as adults, meeting and marrying in Colorado, where they initially operated a wholesale grocery business. Moving to Texas, they ran a horse and cattle ranch.

As a child, Guinan was nicknamed &quot;Mamie&quot; and attended parochial school at the Loretta Convent in Waco, Texas. Growing up on a ranch provided her with basic cowboy skills, and she honed her marksmanship at a local shooting gallery. In 1898, her parents successfully secured her a two-year scholarship to the American Conservatory of Music offered by Chicago businessman Marshall Field. After developing her soprano vocal talents and finishing her studies, she joined a touring actors&#x27; troupe that featured American &quot;Wild West&quot; entertainment.

By 1904 using the name Marie Guinan, she married newspaper cartoonist John Moynahan on December 2. Two years later, Moynahan took a job in Boston. The couple eventually divorced, and Guinan moved to New York to pursue a career as a singer in the entertainment business. For years, she claimed she had been born with the name Texas, and never let facts stand in the way of her narrative: in a full-page 1910 interview in &quot;The San Francisco Call&quot;, for example, she falsely stated that her father &quot;was the first white child seen in Waco&quot; (he had in fact been a married adult when he arrived, and white settlers led by Jacob De Cordova had lived in Waco from the early or mid-19th century).

Theatre critic and &quot;Photoplay&quot; editor Julian Johnson, her companion for a decade, was influential in the creation of her public persona. Many erroneously believed them to be married. Her 1933 obituaries mention Johnson as her second husband, and millionaire George E. Townley as a third husband. Lacking any verification that the latter two marriages took place, Moynahan is now believed to have been her only husband.

Johnson&#x27;s connection is thought to have led to a poem carrying her byline being printed in &quot;Photoplay&quot;. An alleged connection to the U.S. Senator from Texas, Joseph Weldon Bailey, evolved over time from a nonspecific tie to her family, to Guinan&#x27;s being the senator&#x27;s niece. The niece relationship seems implausible, since her parents were born and raised in a different country than either Senator Bailey or his wife. Mentions of him coincide with the timeline of her association with Julian Johnson. While he was editor at &quot;Photoplay&quot;, an article written by then-staff journalist Adela Rogers St. Johns remarked that Guinan &quot;bore a distinct resemblance to her uncle, Senator Joe Bailey of Texas.&quot;

==Vaudeville and stage productions==

Initially finding work as a chorus girl, she adopted the stage name Texas Guinan to give herself an edge in the competitive marketplaces of vaudeville and New York theatre productions. Within a year, she had the female lead in a stage production of &quot;Simple Simon Simple&quot;, during which she accidentally shot herself on stage with a loaded gun. In 1908, she received favorable notices for her performance in &quot;The Gibson Girl Review&quot;. That same year, she placed an advertisement in newspapers offering $1,000 to any songwriter who provided her with a song of equal popularity to the Gus Edwards–penned &quot;That&#x27;s What the Rose Said to Me&quot; She appeared as a soprano vocalist in many productions, including &quot;The Gay Musician&quot;, &quot;The Hoyden&quot; and &quot;The Lone Star&quot;.

She had achieved a degree of national stardom by 1910. John P. Slocum managed her when she appeared in his multiyear touring production of &quot;The Kissing Girl&quot;. When Ned Wayburn rolled out his production of &quot;The Passing Show&quot; on a national tour in 1913, Guinan was one of the headliners. Coinciding with the publicity for the tour, Guinan licensed her name and image to be used by W. C. Cunningham for a weight-loss plan. The advertisements that appeared in media across the country claimed Guinan had lost 70 pounds on the plan. Investigative journalism by the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; alleged that Guinan knowingly acted as a shill in perpetrating a fraud upon the public. A subsequent investigation by the postal service revealed it to be a swindle. United States Postmaster General Albert S. Burleson quickly acted to prohibit Guinan from receiving mail through the postal service. Although she continued on the stage, the incident damaged her career, and was a motivating factor in expanding her repertoire by trying her hand in the California film business.

Guinan appeared as Zaza in the variety show &quot;Hop-o&#x27;-My-Thumb&quot;, based on a French fairytale of the same name. The show opened at the Manhattan Opera House November 26, 1913, and closed January 1, 1914. She toured the United States with the &quot;Whirl of the World&quot; musical comedy in 1915. The tour coincided with her unverified account of being casually approached in Berlin by Kaiser Wilhelm II, who engaged her in conversation as she sat alone reading a book.

She appeared in the musical &quot;Gay Paree&quot; that opened at the Shubert Theatre on August 18, 1925, and closed on January 30, 1926. Guinan was part of the cast of the musical &quot;Padlocks of 1927&quot;, also at the Shubert.

==Films==
In a film career that began in 1917 and continued through 1933, she was part of the vanguard of women filmmakers in the United States. Her later claims of being in France in 1917 entertaining the troops, and being decorated with a bronze medal by French field marshal Joseph Joffre, have been proven false by the timeline and California location of her prolific film-making. Triangle Film Corporation, founded in 1915 by Harry Aitken and Roy Aitken, featured Guinan in four two-reel shorts between 1917 and 1918, &quot;The Fuel of Life&quot;, &quot;The Stainless Barrier&quot;, &quot;The Gun Woman&quot; and &quot;The Love Brokers&quot;. Unlike the musical genre she was known for on stage, she was now moving towards the Western movie genre, and on her dressing room door appeared a map of the state of Texas, rather than her name. Triangle began billing her as &quot;the female Bill Hart&quot; in reference to the industry&#x27;s first Western star who at that time topped fandom popularity polls.
Frohman Brothers were Broadway producers. In 1915, brother Daniel Frohman and partner William L. Sherrill formed the Frohman Amusement Corporation, a motion picture business. They made more than a dozen films with Guinan in 1918, including &quot;The Boss of the Rancho&quot; and &quot;The Heart of Texas&quot;.

During her years with Bull&#x27;s Eye Productions/Reelcraft, she began to expand towards the production end of film-making, as a unit department head on the films &quot;Outwitted&quot;, &quot;The Lady of the Law&quot;, &quot;The Girl of the Rancho&quot;, &quot;The Desert Vulture&quot;, and at least five other productions. She created Texas Guinan Productions in 1921 to produce &quot;Code of the West&quot;, &quot;Spitfire&quot; and &quot;Texas of the Mounted&quot;. After &quot;I Am the Woman&quot; and &quot;The Stampede&quot; for Victor Kremer Film Features, she returned to New York.

Guinan was again seen on the screen with two sound pictures, playing slightly fictionalized versions of herself as a speakeasy proprietress in &quot;Queen of the Night Clubs&quot; (1929) and then &quot;Broadway Thru a Keyhole&quot; (1933, written by Walter Winchell) shortly before her death.

==Queen of the night clubs==
The 1920 Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution put Prohibition into effect, making sales or transport of alcoholic beverages illegal. While it ruined legitimate businesses, people continued drinking alcohol. Those who transported and sold it were known as &quot;bootleggers&quot;. Thus began the establishment of the speakeasy private clubs, a cultural phenomenon in which Guinan excelled. Her introduction into the business was when speakeasy partners Emil Gervasini and John Levi of the Beaux Arts club hired Guinan in 1923 as a singer, for which she was paid $50,000.

Guinan&#x27;s give-and-take dialogue with the customers inspired producer Nils Granlund to put together a full floor show with Guinan presiding as emcee for Ziegfeld Follies chorus girls. Bootleg huckster Larry Fay struck a deal with them to feature the show at his El Fey Club on West 47th Street in Manhattan. There, she became known for her catchphrase, &quot;Hello, Sucker! Come on in and leave your wallet on the bar.&quot; In return for being the draw to attract wealthy and powerful clientele, Guinan received 50% of the profits. Ruby Keeler, Barbara Stanwyck and George Raft were discovered by talent scouts while working as dancers at the club. 

Guinan and Fay were frequently shut down by the police, yet reopened soon after in new locations with new fixtures, and new names. Later, she opened the Texas Guinan Club at 117 West 48th Street, also closed by the police. She and Fay later opened the Del-Fey Club in Miami the same year. By her own account, they once took in $700,000 in less than a year. 
When Guinan returned to New York in January 1926, as hostess of the 300 Club at 151 W. 54th Street, the opening night&#x27;s event was the marriage ceremony for actress Wilda Bennett and Argentine dancer Abraham &quot;Peppy&quot; de Albrew. Other celebrities who visited her club were Al Jolson, Scottish operatic soprano Mary Garden, Jack Dempsey, American operatic soprano Geraldine Farrar, and the Prince of Wales.

In July 1926, the 300 Club was raided by the police, who seized bottles of liquor and arrested two people for &quot;violation of the section of the penal code forbidding suggestive dances&quot;. The last week of June 1928, Assistant U.S. Attorney General Mabel Walker Willebrandt ordered a raid of speakeasy clubs in New York. Guinan, Helen Morgan (hostess of Chez Helen Morgan), Nils Granlund, and 104 others were arrested, and indicted by a federal grand jury. Guinan, Morgan and Granlund faced two years in prison, with a $10,000 maximum fine, if convicted. The others indicted were employees and patrons, who faced lesser penalties. At her April 1929 trial, Guinan was acquitted.

== Final years and death==
During the Great Depression, she took her show on the road. She attempted to move to Europe, but Scotland Yard threatened to board her ship if she tried to land in England, where she was on their list of &quot;barred aliens&quot;. The show was banned from France under labor technicalities. Guinan had a contract with a Paris club, but French employment laws dissuaded non-citizens from working in France. She turned this to her advantage by launching the satirical revue &quot;Too Hot for Paris&quot; upon her return to NY, in 1933.

Guinan played Green Mill Cocktail Lounge in Chicago, Illinois. Part of her act included audience participation with small give-away slapsticks.

While on the road with &quot;Too Hot for Paris&quot;, she contracted amoebic dysentery in Chicago, Illinois, during the epidemic outbreak at the Congress Hotel during the run of the Chicago World&#x27;s Fair. The epidemic was traced to tainted water. She fell ill in Vancouver, British Columbia, and died there on November 5, 1933, age 49, exactly one month before Prohibition was repealed; 7,500 people attended her funeral. Bandleader Paul Whiteman was a pallbearer along with two of her former lawyers and writer Heywood Broun.

Guinan is interred at the Calvary Cemetery in Queens, New York. Her family donated a tabernacle in her name to St. Patrick&#x27;s Church in Vancouver in recognition of Father Louis Forget&#x27;s attentions during her last hours. When the original church was demolished in 2004, the tabernacle was preserved for the new church built on the site. She was survived by both of her parents. Her father was 81 years old at his death on May 14, 1935, and her mother died at age 101 in 1959. The newspaper obituary listed his place of birth as Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada, and his profession as a wholesale grocer.

<text>Donna Karan ( ; born Donna Ivy Faske), also known as DK, is an American fashion designer and the creator of the Donna Karan New York and DKNY clothing labels.

==Early life and education==
Karan was born to mother Helen &quot;Queenie&quot; Faske (née Rabinowitz) and father Gabriel &quot;Gabby&quot; Faske (born Faskowitz) in the Forest Hills neighborhood of the Borough of Queens, New York City. Her family is Jewish. Karan&#x27;s mother had been a model and had also worked in designer Chester Weinberg&#x27;s showroom. Her father was a tailor and haberdasher who died when Donna was three years old.

Karan and her older sister Gail were raised by their mother in Woodmere, in the Five Towns region of Nassau County, New York. At high school, Karan passed much of her time in the art department. She graduated from Hewlett High School in 1966, and then went to the Parsons School of Design.

==Career==

After leaving college, Karan worked for Anne Klein, eventually becoming head of the Anne Klein design-team, where she remained until 1984, when she launched her Donna Karan label.
Karan began her career as an assistant designer with Anne Klein in the late 1960s, where she was promoted to associate designer in 1971. As Klein&#x27;s assistant, Karan was a participant in The Battle of Versailles Fashion Show on November 28, 1973. When Klein herself died in 1974, Takihyo Corporation of Japan became the new owner and Karan, together with her former classmate and friend Louis Dell&#x27;Olio, became head designer of the house. In 1984, Karan left Anne Klein and, together with her then husband Stephan Weiss and Takihyo Corporation, started her own business &quot;to design modern clothes for modern people&quot;. She showed her first women&#x27;s clothing collection in 1985.

Karan became well known for her &#x27;Essentials&#x27; line, initially offering seven easy pieces centered around the bodysuit which could all be mixed and matched, and created a fully integrated wardrobe with her First Collection in 1985. Karan always insisted that she would design only clothes like jersey dresses and opaque Lycra tights that she would wear herself.

In 1988, Karan, nicknamed &quot;The Queen Of Seventh Avenue&quot;, extended her women&#x27;s &#x27;Donna Karan New York&#x27; line by creating a less expensive clothing line for younger women, called DKNY. Two years later, she created DKNY Jeans, a denim-inspired collection. DKNY for men was launched in 1992, one year after the &#x27;Signature&#x27; line for men had been presented. In 1992, Karan also released her &quot;cold shoulder&quot; dress, a jersey long-sleeved dress which featured deep cutouts at the shoulders to reveal the skin beneath.

Karan left her CEO position in 1997, but continued as chairwoman and designer for the Donna Karan line. After 2002, Karan&#x27;s designer contributions became less and less. In August 2008, Karan relaunched her discontinued fragrance lines from the 1990s.
In 2015, Donna Karan announced that she would be stepping down as head of her eponymous company to focus on her lifestyle brand, Urban Zen, established by Karan in 2007.

==Personal life==
In 1976, Donna Faske married Mark Karan, with whom she had a daughter. They divorced in 1978. In 1983, she married artist Stephan Weiss, who would later become co-CEO of the Donna Karan company. Weiss died of lung cancer in 2001.

<text>John Moses Browning (January 23, 1855 – November 26, 1926) was an American firearm designer who developed many varieties of military and civilian firearms, cartridges, and gun mechanisms, many of which are still in use around the world. He made his first firearm at age 13 in his father&#x27;s gun shop and was awarded the first of his 128 firearm patents on October 7, 1879, at the age of 24. He is regarded as one of the most successful firearms designers of the 19th and 20th centuries and a pioneer of modern repeating, semi-automatic, and automatic firearms.

Browning influenced nearly all categories of firearms design, especially the autoloading of ammunition. He invented, or made significant improvements to, single-shot, lever-action, and pump-action rifles and shotguns. He developed the first reliable and compact autoloading pistols by inventing the telescoping bolt, then integrating the bolt and barrel shroud into what is known as the pistol slide. Browning&#x27;s telescoping bolt design is now found on nearly every modern semi-automatic pistol, as well as several modern fully automatic weapons. He also developed the first gas-operated firearm, the Colt–Browning Model 1895 machine guna system that surpassed mechanical recoil operation to become the standard for most high-power self-loading firearm designs worldwide. He also made significant contributions to automatic cannon development.

Browning&#x27;s most successful designs include the M1911 pistol, the water-cooled M1917, the air-cooled M1919, and heavy M2 machine guns, the M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle, and the Browning Auto-5the first semi-automatic shotgun. Some of these arms are still manufactured, often with only minor changes in detail and cosmetics to those assembled by Browning or his licensees. The Browning-designed M1911 and Hi-Power are some of the most copied firearms in the world.

== Early life and craftsmanship ==

Browning&#x27;s father Jonathan—who was among the thousands of pioneers of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who made an exodus from Nauvoo, Illinois, to Utah—established a gunsmith shop in Ogden in 1852. As was common in the Mormon church community at the time, Jonathan Browning was a polygamist, having taken three wives. He fathered 22 children, including John Moses, and raised two stepdaughters with his wife Elizabeth Caroline Clark.

Browning worked in his father&#x27;s Ogden shop from the age of seven, where he was taught basic engineering and manufacturing principles, and encouraged to experiment with new concepts. He developed his first rifle, a single-shot falling block action design while he was still his father&#x27;s apprentice, then, in 1878, in partnership with his younger brother, co-founded John Moses and Matthew Sandefur Browning Company, later renamed Browning Arms Company. The company began producing the brothers&#x27; designs and other non-military firearms. By 1882, the company employed John and Matthew&#x27;s half-brothers Jonathan (1859–1939), Thomas (1860–1943), William (1862–1919), and George (1866–1948).

Like his father, Browning was a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and served a two-year mission in Georgia beginning on March 28, 1887.

He married Rachel Theresa Child (September 14, 1860 – September 30, 1934) on April 10, 1879, in Ogden, Weber County, Utah Territory, and the couple had 10 children, two of whom died in infancy.

=== Firearm designs ===

Production examples of the Browning Model 1878 Single Shot Rifle caught the attention of the Winchester Repeating Arms Company, who dispatched a representative to evaluate the competition. Winchester bought the design for $8,000 and moved production to their Connecticut factory. From 1883, Browning worked in partnership with Winchester and designed a series of rifles and shotguns, most notably the lever action Winchester Model 1887 and the Model 1897 pump shotgun, the falling-block single-shot Model 1885, and the lever-action Model 1886, Model 1892, Model 1894, Model 1895 rifles. After falling out with Winchester, Browning designed the long recoil operated semi-automatic Remington Model 8 rifle. Many of the models are still in production today in some form; over six million Model 1894s had been produced as of 1983, more than any other sporting rifle in history.

Winchester manufactured several popular small arms designed by John M. Browning. For decades in the late 19th century-early 20th century, Browning designs and Winchester firearms were synonymous and the collaboration was highly successful. This came to an end when Browning proposed a new long recoil operated semi-automatic shotgun design, a prototype finished in 1898, to Winchester management, which ultimately became the Browning Auto-5 shotgun. As was the custom of the time, Browning&#x27;s earlier designs had been sold exclusively to Winchester for a single fee payment. With this new product, Browning and his brother Matthew sought royalties based upon unit sales, rather than a single front-end fee payment. If the new shotgun became highly successful, the Browning company stood to make substantially more income. Winchester management, which had agreed to royalties for an earlier Browning shotgun design that was never manufactured, now refused to accede to the Brownings&#x27; terms. Remington Arms also was approached but the president of the company died of a heart attack while the Brownings were waiting to offer him the gun. Remington would later produce a copy of the Auto-5 as the Model 11 which was used by the US Military and was also sold to the civilian market.

Having recently successfully negotiated firearm licenses with Fabrique Nationale de Herstal of Belgium (FN), Browning took the new shotgun design to FN; the offer was accepted and FN manufactured the new shotgun, honoring its inventor, as the Browning Auto-5. The Browning Auto-5 was continuously manufactured as a highly popular shotgun throughout the 20th century. In response, Winchester shifted reliance away from John Browning designs when it adopted a shotgun design of Thomas Crossley Johnson for the new Winchester Model 1911 SL, (Johnson had to work around Browning&#x27;s patents of what became the Auto-5) and the new Model 1912 pump shotgun, which was based in small part upon design features of the earlier Browning-designed Winchester Model 1897 shotgun. This shift marked the end of an era of Winchester-Browning collaboration.

=== Later work and life ===
John Browning was known as a dedicated and tireless innovator and experimenter who sought breakthrough consumer-oriented features and performance and reliability improvements in small arms designs. He did not retire in his later years but dedicated his entire adult life literally to his last day to these pursuits. On November 26, 1926, while working at the bench on a self-loading pistol design for Fabrique Nationale de Herstal (FN) in Liège, he died of heart failure in the design shop of his son Val A. Browning. Even the 9 mm semi-automatic pistol he was working on when he died had great design merit and was eventually completed in 1935 by Belgian designer Dieudonné Saive. Released as the Fabrique Nationale GP35, it was more popularly known as the successful Browning Hi-Power pistol, a favorite of sportsmen and gun collectors as well as many military and law enforcement agencies around the world.

The premium-priced Browning Superposed shotgun, an over-under shotgun design, was his last completed firearm design. It was marketed originally with twin triggers; a single trigger modification was later completed by his son, Val Browning. Commercially introduced in 1931 by FN, Browning Superposed shotguns, and their more affordable cousins, the Browning Citori made in Asia, continue to be manufactured into the 21st century and come with varying grades of fine hand engraving and premium quality wood.

Throughout his life, Browning designed a vast array of military and civilian small arms for his own company, as well as for Winchester, Colt, Remington, Savage, Stevens, and Fabrique Nationale de Herstal of Belgium. Browning firearms have been made, both licensed and unlicensed, by hundreds of factories around the world. Browning Arms Company was established in 1927, the year after Browning&#x27;s death on November 26, 1926, in Liège, Belgium. In 1977, FN Herstal acquired the company.

=== Legacy ===
The M1895 Machine Gun saw action in the Spanish–American War with the United States Marine Corps. The Colt M1911, Browning 1917/19, and the BAR saw action with US forces in World War I, World War II, and the Korean War. The M1911 went on to serve as the U.S.&#x27;s standard military side arm until 1986; a variant is still used by special operations units of the United States Marine Corps and the design remains very popular among civilian shooters and some police departments. The Browning Hi-Power has had a similarly lengthy period of military service outside the United States. The .50 caliber M2 Browning machine gun – the enduring &quot;Ma Deuce&quot; – was developed in 1918, entered service with the US Armed Forces in 1921, and has remained in active service for over a century with militaries across the world in a variety of roles. The 37mm M4 autocannon was initially designed by Browning in 1921 and entered service in 1938; it was used both in aircraft and on U.S. Navy PT boats during World War II.

<text>The American Bobtail is an uncommon breed of domestic cat which was developed in the late 1960s. It is most notable for its stubby &quot;bobbed&quot; tail about one-third to one-half the length of a normal cat&#x27;s tail. This is the result of a cat body type genetic mutation affecting the tail development, similar to that of a Manx cat. The breed is not related to other short-tailed breeds, such as the Cymric cat, or the Japanese Bobtail or Kurilian Bobtail, despite the similar name and physical type—the breeding programs are entirely unrelated, and the genetic mutation causing the bobbed tail are known to be different, as the mutation causing the American Bobtail&#x27;s short tail is dominant; comparatively, the Japanese Bobtail, for example, has a tail mutation that is recessive.

American Bobtails are a very sturdy breed, with both short- and long-haired coats. Their coat is shaggy rather than dense or fluffy. They can have any color of eyes and coat, with a strong emphasis on the &quot;wild&quot; tabby appearance in show animals.

== History ==
Urban legend says that Bobtails are the result of a cross breeding between a domestic tabby cat and a wild bobcat. The unusual tail is actually the result of a random spontaneous genetic mutation within the domestic cat population, and may be related to the Manx gene, which is also dominant. Yodie, a short-tailed brown tabby male, was mated with a seal-point Siamese female to create the American Bobtail&#x27;s original bloodline. Most of the early bloodlines have died out.

This cat&#x27;s original appearance genetics were modified in the breed to form a new and improved strain which comes in essentially all colors and coat types. The breed was first recognized by The International Cat Association (TICA, US-based), in 1989. The breed has been accepted for championship competition by TICA, the Cat Fanciers&#x27; Association (CFA, also US-based) and the American Cat Fanciers Association (ACFA). The breed is technically also sanctioned in the Cat Aficionado Association (CAA) of China, by virtue of the CAA having adopted all of ACFA&#x27;s breed standards; it is unknown if any specimens are actually in China. The breed is &quot;recognized&quot; (as existing), as both American Bobtail Longhair and American Bobtail Shorthair, in the Germany-based World Cat Federation (WCF), but is not &quot;accepted&quot; for competition and has no WCF breed standard.

== Appearance ==
American Bobtails require two to three years to develop, slower than many domestic cat breeds.

While the typically “bobcat-“ or “ocelot”-like spotted coat patterning is the most basal coloration seen on the breed, many other colors and patterns exist (both in long and shorthair varieties), including black, blue, brindle, brown, calico, chocolate, cinnamon, fawn, lilac, pied, red-and-cream, peach or orange tabby or tortoiseshell, all with or without varying amounts of all-white fur on the chest, neck, legs or underside.

The American Bobtail is hearty, short-tailed(but not too short) cat. Its body is moderately long, with substantial boning, and stocky. The stance is noticeably rectangular. The torso is full and broad. The hips are substantial, almost as wide as chest, and hind legs longer than fore legs with large round feet which may have toe tufts. The head is a broad wedge without flat planes, size proportionate to body. There is a concave curve from nose to brow, or rise to prominent brow, a broad unpinched muzzle, prominent whisker pads, a gently sloped wide nose and full, strong jaws. The ears are medium-sized, wide-based, and equally mounted on top and the side of head with rounded tips. The eyes are almost almond shape, with size proportionate to head. The aperture is angled to base of ear, and with medium wide spacing and deep sockets. Eye color varies with coat color. The end of the tail is visible above the back, but not beyond the hock while the animal is in repose. The tail is straight or curved, slightly knotted or may have bumps.

== Behavior ==
American Bobtails are playful, social and some may be quite energetic, especially as kittens. They are considered to be highly adaptable to new environments, making them suitable companions for travelers. According to some sources, the American Bobtail is among the most “dog-like” of any cat breed, boldly greeting visitors to the home and never shying away from a potential opportunity to play, hunt or socialize. They have also been called miniature “ocelots”, at least in terms of their climbing abilities, and enjoy exploring, jumping, and stalking birds and small animals (even through windows). Overall, it is not a “sleepy” or reserved breed, though it still readily comes to humans and other cats and animals for affection, including dogs.

<text>In computer science, a parallel algorithm, as opposed to a traditional serial algorithm, is an algorithm which can do multiple operations in a given time. It has been a tradition of computer science to describe serial algorithms in abstract machine models, often the one known as random-access machine. Similarly, many computer science researchers have used a so-called parallel random-access machine (PRAM) as a parallel abstract machine (shared-memory).

Many parallel algorithms are executed concurrently – though in general concurrent algorithms are a distinct concept – and thus these concepts are often conflated, with which aspect of an algorithm is parallel and which is concurrent not being clearly distinguished. Further, non-parallel, non-concurrent algorithms are often referred to as &quot;sequential algorithms&quot;, by contrast with concurrent algorithms.

==Parallelizability==

Algorithms vary significantly in how parallelizable they are, ranging from easily parallelizable to completely unparallelizable. Further, a given problem may accommodate different algorithms, which may be more or less parallelizable.

Some problems are easy to divide up into pieces in this way – these are called &quot;embarrassingly parallel problems.&quot; Examples include many algorithms to solve Rubik&#x27;s Cubes and find values which result in a given hash.

Some problems cannot be split up into parallel portions, as they require the results from a preceding step to effectively carry on with the next step – these are called s. Examples include iterative numerical methods, such as Newton&#x27;s method, iterative solutions to the three-body problem, and most of the available algorithms to compute pi (π). Some sequential algorithms can be converted into parallel algorithms using automatic parallelization.

In many cases developing an effective parallel algorithm for solution of some task requires attraction of new ideas and methods comparing to creating a sequential algorithm version. These are, for instance, practically important problems of searching a target element in data structures, evaluation of an algebraic expression, etc.

==Motivation==
Parallel algorithms on individual devices have become more common since the early 2000s because of substantial improvements in multiprocessing systems and the rise of multi-core processors. Up until the end of 2004, single-core processor performance rapidly increased via frequency scaling, and thus it was easier to construct a computer with a single fast core than one with many slower cores with the same throughput, so multicore systems were of more limited use. Since 2004 however, frequency scaling hit a wall, and thus multicore systems have become more widespread, making parallel algorithms of more general use.

==Issues==

===Communication===
The cost or complexity of serial algorithms is estimated in terms of the space (memory) and time (processor cycles) that they take. Parallel algorithms need to optimize one more resource, the communication between different processors. There are two ways parallel processors communicate, shared memory or message passing.

Shared memory processing needs additional locking for the data, imposes the overhead of additional processor and bus cycles, and also serializes some portion of the algorithm.

Message passing processing uses channels and message boxes but this communication adds transfer overhead on the bus, additional memory need for queues and message boxes and latency in the messages. Designs of parallel processors use special buses like crossbar so that the communication overhead will be small but it is the parallel algorithm that decides the volume of the traffic.

If the communication overhead of additional processors outweighs the benefit of adding another processor, one encounters parallel slowdown.

===Load balancing===

Another problem with parallel algorithms is ensuring that they are suitably load balanced, by ensuring that &quot;load&quot; (overall work) is balanced, rather than input size being balanced. For example, checking all numbers from one to a hundred thousand for primality is easy to split among processors; however, if the numbers are simply divided out evenly (1–1,000, 1,001–2,000, etc.), the amount of work will be unbalanced, as smaller numbers are easier to process by this algorithm (easier to test for primality), and thus some processors will get more work to do than the others, which will sit idle until the loaded processors complete.

==Distributed algorithms==
A subtype of parallel algorithms, &quot;distributed algorithms&quot;, are algorithms designed to work in cluster computing and distributed computing environments, where additional concerns beyond the scope of &quot;classical&quot; parallel algorithms need to be addressed.

<doc id="148843" wikidata="Q42673" url="?curid=148843" title="Japanese Bobtail">
<text>The Japanese Bobtail is a breed of domestic cat with an unusual bobtail more closely resembling the tail of a rabbit than that of other cats. The breed was first developed in Japan, and registered officially in the 1960s. The breed has been known in Japan for centuries, and it frequently appears in traditional folklore and art. Japanese Bobtails are believed to be derived from domestic and feral populations of kinked-tailed cats widespread throughout Southeast Asia and southern China.

As in most other breeds, Japanese Bobtails may have almost any color (or colors, arranged in any number of patterns). Predominantly-white calicoes are especially favored by the Japanese and by cat fanciers, and strongly represented in folklore, though other colorations are also accepted by breed standards.

==History==

Feral and domestic cats with shortened and kinked tails were first documented in Southeast Asia and southern China long before the development of modern breeds. The kinked tail is highly variable and is a dominant trait. They ranged in appearance from being just slightly shortened (around long), to being seemingly abruptly cut off in the middle (around long), to being bobtails (less than long). These cats were called &quot;qilin tail&quot; in southern China (after the mythical creature) and were traditional symbols of fortune and wealth. Charles Darwin described the widespread occurrence of this trait in &quot;The Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication&quot; (1868): &quot;Throughout an immense area, namely the Malayan archipelago, Siam, Pegu and Burmah, all the cats have truncated tails about half the proper length, often with a sort of knot at the end.&quot;

A 2016 study has identified that the kinked tails in these cats are the result of a missense mutation of the HES7 gene. It is the same cause of the mutation in Japanese Bobtails, making it likely that the ancestral founder of the Japanese bobtail is originally from Southeast Asia or China and that the bobtail trait already existed prior to their introduction to Japan.

It is unknown when cats were first introduced to Japan, but they likely arrived through multiple introductions from trade with the rest of Asia. It is believed that they first arrived along with Buddhist monks in the 6th century, who kept cats as a means of preventing rats from damaging scrolls made from rice paper. They were initially regarded as luxury goods. The first documented mention of a cat in Japan is from the journal entry of the young Emperor Uda in March 11, 889. He described it as a gift which arrived by boat to his father, the late Emperor Kōkō.

In 1602, Japanese authorities decreed that all cats should be set free to help deal with rodents threatening the nation&#x27;s silkworm population and associated industry. At that time, buying or selling cats was illegal, and from then on, bobtailed cats lived on farms and in the streets. Japanese Bobtails thus became the &quot;street/farm cats&quot; of Japan.

Around 1701, in &quot;Kaempfer&#x27;s Japan&quot;, the first book written by a Westerner about the flora, fauna, and landscape of Japan, German doctor Engelbert Kaempfer (1651 – 1716) wrote, &quot;there is only one breed of cat that is kept. It has large patches of yellow, black and white fur; its short tail looks like it has been bent and broken. It has no mind to hunt for rats and mice but just wants to be carried and stroked by women.&quot;

In 1968, Elizabeth Freret is the first known person to have imported the Japanese Bobtail to the Western Hemisphere from Japan. The short hair Japanese Bobtail was accepted for Championship status in the Cat Fanciers&#x27; Association in 1976. Recognition for the long hair variety followed in 1993. As of 2013, there are a number of Japanese Bobtail breeders, most of which are based in North America with a few in Europe and at least one in Japan; yet the breed remains rare.

The Bobtail cats are considered to be a lucky breed and to own one promises prosperity and happiness. The tricoloured, Mi-Ke (pronounced &#x27;mee keh&#x27;) is known as the luckiest colour for this breed. There is a Japanese statue of a cat with its paw in the air called Maneki Neko (translates to &#x27;beckoning cat&#x27;) and is an artist interpretation of the bobtail. These statues are common in many Japanese shops as they are thought to attract good people.

==Breed standard==
The Japanese Bobtail is a recognised breed by all major registering bodies, with the exception of the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF), the domestic registry of the United Kingdom.
*Head: The head should form an equilateral triangle. (Not including ears)
*Ears: Large, upright, set wide apart but at right angles to the head and looking as if alert.
*Muzzle: Fairly broad and round neither pointed nor blunt.
*Eyes: Large, oval rather than round. They should not bulge out beyond the cheekbone or the forehead.
*Body: Medium in size (usually 2.7 - 4kg, or 6 - 9lbs). males larger than females. Long torso, lean and elegant, showing well developed muscular strength. Balance is also very important.
*Neck: Not too long and not too short, in proportion to the length of the body.
*Legs: Long, slender, and high. The hind legs longer than the forelegs.
*Paws: Oval.
*Toes: five in front and four behind.
*Coat (Shorthair): Medium length, soft and silky.
*Coat (Longhair): Length medium-long to long, texture soft and silky gradually lengthening toward the rump.
*Tail: The tail must be clearly visible and is made up of one or more kinked or curved articulations.

== Breed characteristics ==

=== Personality ===
This breed is good for families. Due to their affectionate nature, they are well suited pets for children and communicate with people using soft chirpy noises. This breed is highly attracted to water, very smart, and known for playful behavior, always full of energy and mischief. A very loyal breed, Bobtails make great companions.

=== Grooming ===
This breed has a minimal to medium amount of shedding, due to its short fur. Its coat is easy to groom.

=== Health ===
Just like any animal, there can be a number of different health problems that could be related to the genetics. This being said, the Japanese Bobtails are generally healthy cats. The recessive gene paired with the shortened tails is not associated with any spinal or bone abnormalities.

The average lifespan for this breed is 9–15 years.

=== Care ===
They enjoy climbing and can be prone to obesity.

==Breeding and genetics==
===Mutation===
The short tail is a cat body-type mutation caused by the expression of a dominant gene. The tail is both shortened and kinked in Japanese Bobtails. The gene is fixed/always homozygous in the breed, so generally all kittens born to even one Japanese Bobtail parent will have bobtails as well. A bobtailed cat that is heterozygous for the gene may have kittens with or without the trait. Unlike the dominant Manx gene, the Bobtail gene is not associated with skeletal disorders. The Bobtail gene causes a reduced number of tail vertebrae, as well as some fusion of tail vertebrae. This type of tail is not only unique to the breed but also to each individual cat, no two are exactly alike. For it to be considered a true bobtail cat the tail must not exceed three inches from the point of extension to the tailbone.

===Health===
Recent scientific studies on cat genetics led by researchers has indicated that the Japanese Bobtail breed is one of the most genetically diverse of pedigree breeds. Compared with other breeds, Japanese Bobtails tend to have smaller litters with the kittens being proportionally larger at birth and developing at a faster rate. Kitten mortality rates are reported to be comparatively low.

===Odd-eyed specimens===

Rarely, a Japanese Bobtail, especially a predominantly white specimen, may have heterochromia, or eyes of different colors. Regardless of breed, cats with this trait are known as odd-eyed cats. In this breed, one iris is blue (&quot;silver&quot; in Japanese breeding terms) while the other is yellow (&quot;gold&quot;). This trait is more common in this breed than in most others, with the notable exception of the Turkish Van.

==Behavior==
Generally speaking, members of the breed are active, intelligent cats, with a strongly human-oriented nature, are easier to train to perform tricks than most breeds, and are more likely to enjoy learning human-mediated activities like walking on a harness and leash, and playing fetch. They are very attentive, alert felines that notice a lot. Considered an unusually &quot;talkative&quot; breed, they often interact vocally with people. Their soft voices are capable of nearly a whole scale of tones, leading to a folk belief that they can sing.

==Folklore and legend==

Cats are featured prominently in Japanese folklore. As in many other traditions around the world, cats are frequently objects of fear and mistrust, with various supernatural abilities ascribed to them. But in some Japanese stories, the length of their tails is an important plot point, with the Japanese Bobtail seen as auspicious, while long-tailed cats may be suspected of being , a type of evil spirit.

The (&#x27;beckoning cat&#x27; or &#x27;inviting cat&#x27;), an image of a Japanese Bobtail seated with one paw raised, is considered a good-luck charm among the Japanese around the world, who often keep a statue of this figure in the front of stores or homes (most often a stylized calico, though gold and black variants are also common). This stems from a legend that tells how a man (usually either a priest or member of the royal family) who owned one of these cats looked up one day to see his cat beckoning to him. Thinking the cat might have a message from the gods, he arose and went to it; no sooner had he done so than a branch large enough to kill a man fell where he had been sitting just moments before. Japanese Bobtails also feature prominently in traditional Japanese painting.

One legend of the origin of the breed&#x27;s short tail, tells of a sleeping cat whose long tail caught fire; it then ran through town, spreading flames everywhere. With the capital in ashes, the Emperor decreed that all cats should have their tails cut short as a preventative measure.

While legends and superstitions may have favored the short-tailed breed, it seems likely that the Bobtail simply has a longer history in Japan than other recognizable breeds. It is also likely to have carried much prestige, having originated on the continent and arrived via Korea in the Asuka period (6th century CE), along with other prized articles of Chinese culture.

==In popular culture==
The manga character Hello Kitty resembles a Japanese Bobtail, and is an example of contemporary (&#x27;cute&#x27;) pop culture. The character Muta from &quot;The Cat Returns&quot; was based on a stray Japanese Bobtail that would often visit Studio Ghibli. They also tend to appear in other anime produced in Japan.

In &quot;W Is for Wasted&quot;, by Sue Grafton (part of her alphabet mystery series), private investigator Kinsey Millhone and her landlord Henry Pitts acquire a Japanese bobtail and name him Ed. During a fight with a deranged murder suspect, Ed scratches the killer, thereby saving Kinsey from death by scalpel.

Mochi, Hiro Hamada&#x27;s cat in the Disney film &quot;Big Hero 6&quot;, is also a Japanese Bobtail.

In illustrator Jey Parks&#x27;s 2017 book &quot;Star Trek Cats&quot;, Hikaru Sulu is depicted as a Japanese Bobtail.

The titular cat Good Fortune in the Newbery Medal-winning book The Cat Who Went to Heaven is a tricolor Japanese Bobtail.

<text>There are typically two types of clothing worn in Japan: traditional clothing known as , including the national dress of Japan, the kimono, and which encompasses all else not recognised as either national dress or the dress of another country.

Traditional Japanese fashion represents a long-standing history of traditional culture, encompassing colour palettes developed in the Heian period, silhouettes adopted from Tang dynasty clothing and cultural traditions, motifs taken from Japanese culture, nature and traditional literature, the use of types of silk for some clothing, and styles of wearing primarily fully-developed by the end of the Edo period. The most well-known form of traditional Japanese fashion is the kimono, with the term &quot;kimono&quot; translating literally as &quot;something to wear&quot; or &quot;thing worn on the shoulders&quot;. Other types of traditional fashion include the clothing of the Ainu people (known as the ) and the clothes of the Ryukyuan people which is known as , most notably including the traditional fabrics of and produced on the Ryukyu Islands.

Modern Japanese fashion mostly encompasses (Western clothes), though many well-known Japanese fashion designers – such as Issey Miyake, Yohji Yamamoto and Rei Kawakubo – have taken inspiration from and at times designed clothes taking influence from traditional fashion. Their works represent a combined impact on the global fashion industry, with many pieces displayed at fashion shows all over the world, as well as having had an impact within the Japanese fashion industry itself, with many designers either drawing from or contributing to Japanese street fashion.

Despite previous generations wearing traditional clothing near-entirely, following the end of World War II, Western clothing and fashion became increasingly popular due to their increasingly-available nature and, over time, their cheaper price. It is now increasingly rare for someone to wear traditional clothing as everyday clothes, and over time, traditional clothes within Japan have garnered an association with being difficult to wear and expensive. As such, traditional garments are now mainly worn for ceremonies and special events, with the most common time for someone to wear traditional clothes being to summer festivals, when the is most appropriate; outside of this, the main groups of people most likely to wear traditional clothes are geisha, and sumo wrestlers, all of whom are required to wear traditional clothing in their profession.

Traditional Japanese clothing has garnered fascination in the Western world as a representation of a different culture; first gaining popularity in the 1860s, Japonisme saw traditional clothing – some produced exclusively for export and differing in construction from the clothes worn by Japanese people everyday – exported to the West, where it soon became a popular item of clothing for artists and fashion designers. Fascination for the clothing of Japanese people continued into WW2, where some stereotypes of Japanese culture such as &quot;geisha girls&quot; became widespread. Over time, depictions and interest in traditional and modern Japanese clothing has generated discussions surrounding cultural appropriation and the ways in which clothing can be used to stereotype a culture; in 2016, the &quot;Kimono Wednesday&quot; event held at the Boston Museum of Arts became a key example of this.

==History==
=== Yayoi period (Neolithic to Iron Age)===

Little is known of the clothing of the Yayoi period. In the 3rd-century (, a section of the &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot; compiled by Chinese scholar Chen Shou), there is some description of clothing worn in Japan. It describes broad cloth (possibly double-width), made into unshaped garments by being tied about the waist and shoulders.
=== Kofun period (300–538 AD) ===
Until the 5th century AD, there is little artistic evidence of the clothing worn in Japan. Kofun period clothing is known from clay sculptures used atop offering cylinders. These were used in the 5th and 6th century, though most have no sculpture on top. These figures likely do not represent everyday dress; they may represent riding dress. Many wear armour.

In the Kofun period, the right side was wrapped over the left (unlike in China), and the overlapped edge was secured with ties on the right side. Sleeves and trousers were tubular. Female figures often wear a skirt, with male figures wearing trousers tied with garters just above the calf, so that they balloon over the knee, allowing freedom of movement. , wrapped skirts, were worn by men and women, sometimes over (trousers).

Traditional Chinese clothing had been introduced to Japan via Chinese envoys in the Kofun period, with immigration between the two countries and envoys to the Tang dynasty court leading to Chinese styles of dress, appearance and culture becoming extremely popular in Japanese court society. The Imperial Japanese court quickly adopted Chinese styles of dress and clothing. As early as the 4th century CE, images of priestess-queens and tribal chiefs in Japan depicted figures wearing clothing similar that of Han dynasty China. There is evidence of the oldest samples of tie-dyed fabric stored at the Shōsōin Temple being Chinese in origin, due to the limitations of Japan&#x27;s ability to produce the fabrics at the time (see ).
=== Asuka period (538–710 CE)===
The Asuka period began with the introduction of Buddhism, and the writing system of Chinese characters to Japan; during this time, Chinese influence over Japan was fairly strong.

Judging by the depictions in the Tenjukoku Shūchō Mandala, during the reign of Empress Suiko (593–628), male and female court dress were very similar. Both wore round-necked front-fastening with non-overlapping lapels, the front, collar, and cuffs edged with contrasting fabric, possibly an underlayer; the skirt, above knee-length, had a matching edge. Below the and extending below it to about knee length, a more heavily pleated contrasting skirt called a was worn. Below the , men wore narrow with a contrasting lower edge, and women wore a pleated long enough to trail.

The Takamatsuzuka Tomb () is a major source of information for upper-class clothing of this period. By this time, the lapels overlapped (still right side over left), and the and were edged with pleated frills, replacing the . (black gauze caps stiffened with lacquer) were being worn by male courtiers, and were regulaed in the 11th regnal year of Emperor Tenmu (~684 CE); this fashion persists in formal use into the 21st century.
=== Nara period (710–794) ===

Nara-period upper-class clothing was much simpler than some later styles, taking no more than a few minutes to don, with the clothing itself allowing for freedom of movement. Women&#x27;s upper-class dress consisted of a left-over-right lap-fronted top (over a similar underrobe), and a wrapped, pleated skirt (). Women also sometimes wore a lap-fronted overvest, and a narrow rectangular stole. Men&#x27;s upper-class dress had narrow, unpleated (single-panel) (trousers) under a loose, mandarin-collared coat (), with elaborate hats of stiffened open-weave black cloth (). Clothing was belted with narrow sashes.

Nara-period women&#x27;s clothing was heavily influenced by Tang-dynasty China. Women adopted collars, which overlapped like modern kimono collars, though men continued wearing round mandarin collars, which were associated with scholasticism, only later adopting . Lower-body garments ( and ) had been worn under the outermost upper-body garments, but now, following the newer Chinese fashion, they transitioned to being worn on top (again, by women, but not yet by men).

In 718 CE, the Yoro clothing code was instituted, which stipulated that all robes had to be overlapped at the front with a left-to-right closure, following typical Chinese fashions. China considered right-over-left wraps barbaric. This convention of wear is still followed today, with a right-to-left closure worn only by the deceased.

In 752 CE, a massive bronze Buddha statue at Tōdai-ji, Nara, was consecrated with great ceremony. The ceremonial clothing of attendees (probably not all made in Japan) was preserved in the Shōsō-in. Most of them close left-over-right, but some abut or overlap right-over-left. Collar shapes include narrow, round or v-shaped. There is craftsmen&#x27;s clothing in (domestic bast fiber), with long, round-collared outer robes. Richer garments in silk are ornamented with figural and geometric patterns, woven and dyed; some have flaring sleeves. Aprons, , leggings, socks and shoes have also been preserved.

Social segregation of clothing was primarily noticeable in the Nara period (710–794), through the division of upper and lower class. People of higher social status wore clothing that covered the majority of their body, or as Svitlana Rybalko states, &quot;the higher the status, the less was open to other people&#x27;s eyes&quot;. For example, the full-length robes would cover most from the collarbone to the feet, the sleeves were to be long enough to hide their fingertips, and women carried fans to protect them from speculative looks.
=== Heian period (794–1185) ===
During the Heian period (794-1185 CE), Japan stopped sending envoys to the Chinese dynastic courts. This prevented Chinese-imported goods—including clothing—from entering the Imperial Palace and disseminating to the upper classes, who were the main arbiters of traditional Japanese culture at the time and the only people allowed to wear such clothing. The ensuing cultural vacuum facilitated the development of a Japanese culture independent from Chinese fashions. Elements previously lifted from the Tang Dynastic courts developed independently into what is known literally as &quot;national culture&quot; or , the term used to refer to Heian-period Japanese culture, particularly that of the upper classes.

Clothing became increasingly stylised, with some elements—such as the round-necked and tube-sleeved jacket, worn by both genders in the early 7th century—being abandoned by both male and female courtiers. Others, such as the wrapped-front robes, also worn by men and women, were kept. Some elements, such as the skirt worn by women, continued on in a reduced capacity, worn only to formal occasions; the grew too narrow to wrap all the way around and became a trapezoidal pleated train. Formal (trousers) became longer than the legs and also trailed behind the wearer. Men&#x27;s formal dress included collars and very wide sleeves.

The concept of the hidden body remained, with ideologies suggesting that the clothes served as &quot;protection from the evil spirits and outward manifestation of a social rank&quot;. This proposed the widely held belief that those of lower ranking, who were perceived to be of less clothing due to their casual performance of manual labor, were not protected in the way that the upper class were in that time period. This was also the period in which Japanese traditional clothing became introduced to the Western world.

During the later Heian period, various clothing edicts reduced the number of layers a woman could wear, leading to the (lit., &quot;small sleeve&quot;) garment—previously considered underwear—becoming outerwear by the time of the Muromachi period (1336-1573 CE). 
=== Kamakura period (1185–1333) ===
=== Muromachi period (1336–1573 CE) ===
=== Azuchi-Momoyama period (1568–1600) ===

Originally worn with , the began to be held closed with a small belt known as an instead. The resembled a modern kimono, though at this time the sleeves were sewn shut at the back and were smaller in width (shoulder seam to cuff) than the body of the garment. During the Sengoku period (1467–1615)/Azuchi-Momoyama period (1568–1600), decoration of the developed further, with bolder designs and flashy primary colours becoming popular. By this time, separate lower-body garments such as the and were almost never worn, allowing full-length patterns to be seen.

===Edo period (1603–1867)===
During the Edo period (1603–1867 CE), both Japan&#x27;s culture and economy developed significantly. A particular factor in the development of the Edo period was the early Genroku period (1688–1704 CE), wherein &quot;Genroku culture&quot; - luxurious displays of wealth and increased patronage of the arts - led to the further development of many art forms, including those of clothing. Genroku culture was spearheaded by the growing and increasingly-powerful merchant classes (); the clothing of classes, representative of their increasing economic power, rivalled that of the aristocracy and samurai classes, brightly coloured and utilising expensive production techniques, such as handpainted dyework. , a damask fabric, also became the preferred material for kimono at this time, replacing the previously popular plain-weave silk, which had been used to create .

In response to the increasing material wealth of the merchant classes, the Tokugawa shogunate issued a number of sumptuary laws `for the lower classes, prohibiting the use of purple or red fabric, gold embroidery, and the use of intricately dyed patterns. As a result, a school of aesthetic thought known as , which valued and prioritised the display of wealth through almost mundane appearances, developed, a concept of kimono design and wear that continues to this day as a major influence.

From this point onwards, the basic shape of both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s kimono remained largely unchanged. The sleeves of the began to grow in length, especially amongst unmarried women, and the became much longer and wider, with various styles of knots coming into fashion, alongside stiffer weaves of material to support them.

In the Edo period, the kimono market was divided into craftspeople, who made the and accessories, , or wholesalers, and retailers.

===Modern period (1869–), by regnal era===
==== Meiji period (1868–1912)====

In 1869, the social class system was abolished, and with them, class-specific sumptuary laws. Kimono with formerly-restricted elements, like red and purple colours, became popular, particularly with the advent of synthetic dyestuffs such as mauvine.

Following the opening of Japan&#x27;s borders in the early Meiji period to Western trade, a number of materials and techniques - such as wool and the use of synthetic dyestuffs - became popular, with casual wool kimono being relatively common in pre-1960s Japan; the use of safflower dye () for silk linings fabrics (known as ; literally, &quot;red silk&quot;) was also common in pre-1960s Japan, making kimono from this era easily identifiable.

During the Meiji period, the opening of Japan to Western trade after the enclosure of the Edo period led to a drive towards Western dress as a sign of &quot;modernity&quot;. After an edict by Emperor Meiji, policemen, railroad workers and teachers moved to wearing Western clothing within their job roles, with the adoption of Western clothing by men in Japan happening at a much greater pace than by women. Initiatives such as the promoted Western dress as everyday clothing.

In Japan, modern Japanese fashion history might be conceived as a gradual westernization of Japanese clothes; both the woolen and worsted industries in Japan originated as a product of Japan&#x27;s re-established contact with the West in the early Meiji period (1850s-1860s). Before the 1860s, Japanese clothing consisted entirely of kimono of a number of varieties.

With the opening of Japan&#x27;s ports for international trade in the 1860s, clothing from a number of different cultures arrived as exports; despite Japan&#x27;s historic contact with the Dutch before this time through its southerly ports, Western clothing had not caught on, despite the study of and fascination with Dutch technologies and writings.

The first Japanese to adopt Western clothing were officers and men of some units of the shōgun&#x27;s army and navy; sometime in the 1850s, these men adopted woolen uniforms worn by the English marines stationed at Yokohama. Wool was difficult to produce domestically, with the cloth having to be imported. Outside of the military, other early adoptions of Western dress were mostly within the public sector, and typically entirely male, with women continuing to wear kimono both inside and outside of the home, and men changing into the kimono usually within the home for comfort.

From this point on, Western clothing styles spread outwards of the military and upper public sectors, with courtiers and bureaucrats urged to adopt Western clothing, promoted as both modern and more practical. The Ministry of Education ordered that Western-style student uniforms be worn in public colleges and universities. Businessmen, teachers, doctors, bankers, and other leaders of the new society wore suits to work and at large social functions. Despite Western clothing becoming popular within the workplace, in schools and on the streets, it was not worn by everybody, and was actively considered uncomfortable and undesirable by some; one account tells of a father promising to buy his daughters new kimono as a reward for wearing Western clothing and eating meat. By the 1890s, appetite for Western dress as a fashion statement had cooled considerably, and the kimono remained an item of fashion.

A number of different fashions from the West arrived and were also incorporated into the way that people wore kimono; numerous woodblock prints from the later Meiji period show men wearing bowler hats and carrying Western-style umbrellas whilst wearing kimono, and Gibson girl hairstyles - typically a large bun on top of a relatively wide hairstyle, similar to the Japanese - became popular amongst Japanese women as a more low-effort hairstyle for everyday life.

By the beginning of the 20th century, Western dress had become a symbol of social dignity and progressiveness; however, the kimono was still considered to be fashion, with the two styles of dress essentially growing in parallel with one another over time. With Western dress being considered street wear and a more formal display of fashionable clothing, most Japanese people wore the comfortable kimono at home and when out of the public eye.

====Taishō period (1912–1926)====
Western clothing quickly became standard issue as army uniform for men and school uniform for boys, and between 1920 and 1930, the sailor outfit replaced the kimono and undivided as school uniform for girls. However, kimono still remained popular as an item of everyday fashion; following the Great Kantō Earthquake of 1923, cheap, informal and ready-to-wear kimono, woven from raw and waste silk threads unsuitable for other uses, became highly popular, following the loss of many people&#x27;s possessions. By 1930, ready-to-wear kimono had become highly popular for their bright, seasonally changing designs, many of which took inspiration from the Art Deco movement. kimono were usually dyed using the ikat () technique of dyeing, where either warp or both warp and weft threads (known as ) were dyed using a stencil pattern before weaving.

It was during the Taishō period that the modern formalisation of kimono and kimono types began to emerge. The Meiji period had seen the slow introduction of kimono types that mediated between the informal and the most formal, a trend that continued throughout the Taishō period, as social occasions and opportunities for leisure increased under the abolition of class distinctions. As Western clothing increased in popularity for men as everyday clothing, the kimono industry further established its own traditions of formal and informal dress for women; this saw the invention of the , divisions of (short-sleeved) kimono for women, and . The bridal kimono trousseau (), an uncommon practice of the upper classes in the Edo period, also became common throughout the middle classes; traditions of kimono bridalwear for marriage ceremonies were also codified in this time, which resembled the bridalwear of samurai-class women. Standards of at this time began to slowly graduate to a more formalised, neatened appearance, with a flat, uniform and a smooth, uncreased , which also resembled the &quot;proper&quot; of upper-class women. However, standards were still relatively informal, and would not become formalised until after World War II.

====Shōwa period (1926–1989)====

While kimono were no longer common wear for men, they remained everyday wear for Japanese women until World War II (1940–1945). Though the Taishō period had seen a number of invented traditions, standards of (wearing kimono) were still not as formalised in this time, with creases, uneven and crooked still deemed acceptable.

Until the 1930s, the majority of Japanese still wore kimono, and Western clothes were still restricted to out-of-home use by certain classes.

During the war, kimono factories shut down, and the government encouraged people to wear (also romanised as ) - trousers constructed from old kimono - instead. Fibres such as rayon became widespread during WWII, being inexpensive to produce and cheap to buy, and typically featured printed designs. Cloth rationing persisted until 1951, so most kimono were made at home from repurposed fabrics.

In the second half of the 20th century, the Japanese economy boomed, and silk became cheaper, making it possible for the average family to afford silk kimono. The kimono retail industry had developed an elaborate codification of rules for kimono-wearing, with types of kimono, levels of formality, and rules on seasonality, which intensified after the war; there had previously been rules about kimono-wearing, but these were not rigidly codified and varied by region and class. Formalisation sought perfection, with no creases or uneveness in the kimono, and an increasingly tubular figure was promoted as the ideal for women in kimono. The kimono-retail industry also promoted a sharp distinction between Japanese and Western clothes; for instance, wearing Western shoes with Japanese clothing (while common in the Taishō period) was codified as improper; these rules on proper dressing are often described in Japanese using the English phrase &quot;Time, Place, and Occasion&quot; (TPO). As neither Japanese men or women commonly wore kimono, having grown up under wartime auspices, commercial schools were set up to teach women how to don kimono. Men in this period rarely wore kimono, and menswear thus escaped most of the formalisation.).

Kimono were promoted as essential for ceremonial occasions; for instance, the expensive worn by young women for was deemed a necessity. Bridal trousseaus containing tens of kimono of every possible subtype were also promoted as &quot;de rigueur&quot;, and parents felt obliged to provide kimono trousseaus that cost up to 10 million yen (~£70,000), which were displayed and inspected publicly as part of the wedding, including being transported in transparent trucks.

By the 1970s, formal kimono formed the vast majority of kimono sales. Kimono retailers, due to the pricing structure of brand new kimono, had developed a relative monopoly on not only prices but also a perception of kimono knowledge, allowing them to dictate prices and heavily promote more formal (and expensive) purchases, as selling a single formal kimono could support the seller comfortably for three months. The kimono industry peaked in 1975, with total sales of 2.8 trillion yen (~£18 billion). The sale of informal brand new kimono was largely neglected.

====Heisei period (1989–2019)====
The economic collapse of the 1990s bankrupted much of the kimono industry and ended a number of expensive practices. The rules for how to wear kimono lost their previous hold over the entire industry, and formerly-expensive traditions such as bridal kimono trousseaus generally disappeared, and when still given, were much less extensive. It was during this time that it became acceptable and even preferred for women to wear Western dress to ceremonial occasions like weddings and funerals. Many women had dozens or even hundreds of kimono, mostly unworn, in their homes; a secondhand kimono, even if unworn, would sell for about 500 yen (less than £3.50; about US$5), a few percent of the bought-new price. In the 1990s and early 2000s, many secondhand kimono shops opened as a result of this.

In the early years of the 21st century, the cheaper and simpler became popular with young people. Around 2010, men began wearing kimono again in situations other than their own wedding, and kimono were again promoted and worn as everyday dress by a small minority.

====Reiwa period (2019–present)====
Today, the vast majority of people in Japan wear Western clothing in the everyday, and are most likely to wear kimono either to formal occasions such as wedding ceremonies and funerals, or to summer events, where the standard kimono is the easy-to-wear, single-layer cotton .

==Types of traditional clothing==
===Kimono===
The kimono , labelled the &quot;national costume of Japan&quot;, is the most well-known form of traditional Japanese clothing. The kimono is worn wrapped around the body, left side over right, and is sometimes worn layered. It is always worn with an , and may be worn with a number of traditional accessories and types of footwear. Kimono differ in construction and wear between men and women.

After the four-class system ended in the Tokugawa period (1603–1867), the symbolic meaning of the kimono shifted from a reflection of social class to a reflection of self, allowing people to incorporate their own tastes and individualize their outfit. The process of wearing a kimono requires, depending on gender and occasion, a sometimes detailed knowledge of a number of different steps and methods of tying the , with formal kimono for women requiring at times the help of someone else to put on. Post-WW2, kimono schools were built to teach those interested in kimono how to wear it and tie a number of different knots.
A number of different types of kimono exist that are worn in the modern day, with women having more varieties than men. Whereas men&#x27;s kimono differ in formality typically through fabric choice, the number of crests on the garment (known as or ) and the accessories worn with it, women&#x27;s kimono differ in formality through fabric choice, decoration style, construction and crests.

====Women&#x27;s kimono====
*The (lit., &quot;swinging sleeve&quot;) is a type of formal kimono usually worn by young women, often for Coming of Age Day or as bridalwear, and is considered the most formal kimono for young women.
*The is also worn as bridalwear as an unbelted outer layer.
*The and are formal kimono with a design solely along the hem, and are considered the most formal kimono for women outside of the .
*The and the are semi-formal women&#x27;s kimono featuring a design on part of the sleeves and hem.
*The is a low-formality solid-colour kimono worn for tea ceremony and other mildly-formal events.
*The and are informal kimono with a repeating pattern all over the kimono.

Other types of kimono, such as the and (mourning) kimono are worn by both men and women, with differences only in construction and sometimes decoration. In previous decades, women only stopped wearing the when they got married, typically in their early- to mid-twenties; however, in the modern day, a woman will usually stop wearing around this time whether she is married or not.

====Dressing in kimono====
The word kimono literally translates as &quot;thing to wear&quot;, and up until the 19th century it was the main form of dress worn by men and women alike in Japan.

Traditionally, the art of wearing kimono (known as ) was passed from mother to daughter as simply learning how to dress, and in the modern day, this is also taught in specialist kimono schools. First, one puts on , which are white cotton socks. Then the undergarments are put on followed by a top and a wraparound skirt. Next, the (under-kimono) is put on, which is then tied by a . Finally, the kimono is put on, with the left side covering the right, tied in place with one or two and smoothed over with a belt. The is then tied in place. Kimono are always worn left-over-right unless being worn by the dead, in which case they are worn right-over-left. When the kimono is worn outside, either or sandals are traditionally worn.
Women typically wear kimono when they attend traditional arts, such as a tea ceremonies or classes. During wedding ceremonies, the bride and groom will often go through many costume changes; though the bride may start off in an entirely-white outfit before switching to a colourful one, grooms will wear black kimono made from habutae silk.

Funeral kimono () for both men and women are plain black with five crests, though Western clothing is also worn to funerals. Any plain black kimono with less than five crests is not considered to be mourning wear.

The &quot;coming of age&quot; ceremony, , is another occasion where kimono are worn. At these annual celebrations, women wear brightly coloured , often with fur stoles around the neck. Other occasions where kimono are traditionally worn in the modern day include the period surrounding the New Year, graduation ceremonies, and , which is a celebration for children aged 3, 5 and 7.

====Seasons====
Kimono are matched with seasons. (lined) kimono, made of silk, wool, or synthetic fabrics, are worn during the cooler months. During these months, kimono with more rustic colours and patterns (like russet leaves), and kimono with darker colours and multiple layers, are favoured. Lightweight cotton are worn by men and women during the spring and summer months. In the warmer weather months, vibrant colors and floral designs (like cherry blossoms) are common.

====Materials====

Up until the 15th century the vast majority of kimono worn by most people were made of hemp or linen, and they were made with multiple layers of materials. Today, kimono can be made of silk, silk brocade, silk crepes (such as ) and satin weaves (such as ). Modern kimono that are made with less-expensive easy-care fabrics such as rayon, cotton sateen, cotton, polyester and other synthetic fibers, are more widely worn today in Japan. However, silk is still considered the ideal fabric for more formal kimono.

Kimono are typically long with eight wide pieces. These pieces are sewn together to create the basic T-shape. Kimono are traditionally sewn by hand, a technique known as . However, even machine-made kimono require substantial hand-stitching.

Kimono are traditionally made from a single bolt of fabric called a . come in standard dimensions, and the entire bolt is used to make one kimono. The finished kimono consists of four main strips of fabric — two panels covering the body and two panels forming the sleeves — with additional smaller strips forming the narrow front panels and collar. Kimono fabrics are frequently hand-made and -decorated.

Kimono are worn with sash-belts called , of which there are several varieties. In previous centuries, were relatively pliant and soft, so literally held the kimono closed; modern-day are generally stiffer, meaning the kimono is actually kept closed through tying a series of flat ribbons, such as kumihimo, around the body. The two most common varieties of for women are , which can be worn with everything but the most casual forms of kimono, and , which are narrower at one end to make them easier to wear.


The is an informal kimono worn specifically in the spring and summer, and it is generally less expensive than the traditional kimono. Because it was made for warm weather, are almost entirely made of cotton of an often lighter weight and brighter color than most kimono fabrics. It is worn for festivals and cherry blossom viewing ceremonies.
The , which resembles a long, wide pleated skirt, is generally worn over the kimono and is considered formal wear. Although it was traditionally created to be worn by men of all occupations (craftsmen, farmers, samurai, etc.), it is now socially accepted to be worn by women as well.

The is similar to a belt, wrapping around the outer kimono and helping to keep all of the layers together, though it does not actually tie them closed. are typically long, rectangular belts that can be decorated and coloured in a variety of different ways, as well as being made of a number of different fabrics. Modern are typically made of a crisp, if not stiff, weave of fabric, and may be relatively thick and unpliant.

 are a type of sandal worn with kimono that resemble flip-flops by design, with the exception that the base is sturdier and at times forms a gently sloping heel. can be made of wood, leather and vinyl, with more formal varieties featuring decorated straps (known as ) that may be embroidered and woven with gold and silver yarn. These shoes are typically worn with white socks usually mostly covered by the kimono&#x27;s hem. are sandals similar to that are made to be worn in the snow or dirt, featured with wooden columns underneath the shoes.
Beginning in 1881, Japanese men wore &quot;&quot;, a kind of underpants named after a song. Kaori Shoji of the &quot;Japan Times&quot; wrote that they would be &quot;best be described as a loose, thin, crepe cotton version of long johns.&quot; Initially men used it under kimono. By 2012 new variations of it emerged. Shoji stated that in 2012 the garment still emotionally symbolized the summer, even though there was a sense of embarrassment around it; she stated that it was more common until the 1990s.

==Design==

===Designers===
Multiple designers use the kimono as a foundation for their current designs, being influenced by its cultural and aesthetic aspects and including them into their garments.

Issey Miyake is most known for crossing boundaries in fashion and reinventing forms of clothing while simultaneously transmitting the traditional qualities of the culture into his work. He has explored various techniques in design, provoking discussion on what identifies as &quot;dress&quot;. He has also been tagged the &quot;Picasso of Fashion&quot; due to his recurring confrontation of traditional values. Miyake found interest in working with dancers to create clothing that would best suit them and their aerobic movements, eventually replacing the models he initially worked with for dancers, in hopes of producing clothing that benefits people of all classifications. His use of pleats and polyester jersey reflected a modern form of fashion due to their practical comfort and elasticity. Over 10 years of Miyake&#x27;s work was featured in Paris in 1998 at the &quot;Issey Miyake: Making Things&quot; exhibition. His two most popular series were titled, &quot;Pleats, Please&quot; and &quot;A-POC (A piece of Cloth)&quot;.

Yohji Yamamoto and Rei Kawakubo are Japanese fashion designers who share similar tastes in design and style, their work often considered by the public to be difficult to differentiate. They were influenced by social conflicts, as their recognizable work bloomed and was influenced by the post war era of Japan. They differ from Miyake and several other fashion designers in their dominating use of dark colors, especially the color black. Traditional clothing often included a variety of colors in their time, and their use of &quot;the absence of color&quot; provoked multiple critics to voice their opinions and criticize the authenticity of their work. American Vogue of April 1983 labeled the two &quot;avant-garde designers&quot;, eventually leading them to their success and popularity.

===Aesthetics===
The Japanese are often recognized for their traditional art and its capability of transforming simplicity into creative designs. As stated by Valerie Foley, &quot;Fan shapes turn out to be waves, waves metamorphose into mountains; simple knots are bird wings; wobbly semicircles signify half-submerged Heian period carriage wheels&quot;. These art forms have been transferred onto fabric that then mold into clothing. With traditional clothing, specific techniques are used and followed, such as metal applique, silk embroidery, and paste- resist. The type of fabric used to produce the clothing was often indicative of a person&#x27;s social class, for the wealthy were able to afford clothing created with fabrics of higher quality. Stitching techniques and the fusion of colors also distinguished the wealthy from the commoner, as those of higher power had a tendency to wear ornate, brighter clothing.

==Influence on modern fashion==

===Tokyo street fashion===
Japanese street fashion emerged in the 1990s and differed from traditional fashion in the sense that it was initiated and popularized by the general public, specifically teenagers, rather than by fashion designers. Different forms of street fashion have emerged in different Tokyo locales, such as the &quot;rorīta&quot; in Harajuku, the &quot;koakuma ageha&quot; of Shibuya or the &quot;Gyaru&quot; subculture fashion style.

Lolita fashion became popular in the mid-2000s. It is characterized by &quot;a knee length skirt or dress in a bell shape assisted by petticoats, worn with a blouse, knee high socks or stockings and a headdress&quot;. Different sub-styles of lolita include casual, sweet, gothic, black and (&quot;princess&quot;). &quot;Kogyaru&quot; or &quot;kogal&quot; is another Japanese street fashion based on a Shibuya club-hostess look. Women with this style tan their bodies and faces to a deep brown colour, and will frequently use light lipstick to accentuate the darkness and brownness of their complexion. The trend is found in both Shibuya and Harajuku, and is influenced by a &quot;schoolgirl&quot; look, with participants often wearing short skirts, oversized knee-high socks, and sparkling accessories.

<doc id="148858" wikidata="Q905204" url="?curid=148858" title="Kakigōri">
<text>is a Japanese shaved ice dessert flavored with syrup and a sweetener, often condensed milk.

==History==
The origins of &quot;kakigōri&quot; date back to the Heian period in Japanese history, when blocks of ice saved during the colder months would be shaved and served with sweet syrup to Japanese aristocracy during the summer. Kakigōri&#x27;s origin is referred to in &quot;The Pillow Book&quot;, a book of observations written by Sei Shōnagon, who served the Imperial Court during the Heian period. Kakigōri became more accessible in the 19th century, when ice became more widely available to the public during the summertime. The first kakigōri store is believed to have opened in Yokohama in 1869.

July 25 is known as kakigōri day in Japan because of its pronunciation sounding similar to summer ice in Japanese. Another reasoning for July 25 being kakigōri day is because, on that day in 1933, there was a record high temperature in Japan.

==Description==
The traditional way of making kakigōri uses a hand cranked machine to spin a block of ice over a shaving blade. Even though electric shavers are most often used, street vendors can still be seen hand-shaving ice blocks in the summer.

Rather than flavored ice, Kakigōri is traditionally made of pure ice, in many cases, being a frozen block of mineral water. The ice used is often taken from natural springs, afterward being tempered to achieve an ideal quality for shaving. Prior to refrigeration, mountain caves or ice houses would be the traditional way of storing kakigōri ice.

It is similar to a snow cone but with some notable differences: It has a much smoother fluffier ice consistency, much like fresh fallen snow, and a spoon is almost always used to eat it. The texture of the ice distinguishes kakigōri from other types of shaved ice desserts. Due to this textural difference, it has also been seen translated as &#x27;Angel Snow&#x27;, which perhaps sounds more appealing.

Popular flavors include strawberry, cherry, lemon, green tea, grape, melon, &quot;Blue Hawaii&quot;, sweet plum, and colorless syrup. Some shops provide colorful varieties by using two or more syrups. To sweeten kakigōri, condensed or evaporated milk is often poured on top of it.

In addition to street stalls, kakigōri is sold in festivals, convenience stores, coffee shops, specialized kakigōri parlors, and restaurants. It&#x27;s also frequently prepared by families at home. During the hot summer months, kakigōri is sold virtually everywhere in Japan. Especially at summer festivals and fairs such as matsuri and bon odori festivals, often served alongside other street foods such as yakisoba, takoyaki and cotton candy. Kakigōri is one of the summer features in Japan. Some shops serve it with ice cream and sweetened red beans or tapioca pearls.

A flag with the kanji sign for ice kōri (氷) is a common and traditional way for an establishment to indicate that they are serving kakigōri.

==Shirokuma==

, is a type of kakigōri. Shirokuma is made with shaved ice flavored with condensed milk, small colorful mochi, fruits, and sweet bean paste (usually Azuki bean). Mandarin oranges, cherries, pineapples, and raisins are often used to make shirokuma. 

===Description===
Shirokuma has been popular in Kagoshima since the middle of the Edo period and is well known to many Japanese. Condensed milk, fruit, and sweet bean paste are served over shaved ice. It is eaten in cafés and in some department stores, such as Yamakataya (山形屋) or Mujaki.

===Etymology===
Shirokuma literally means &quot;white bear&quot; and indicates &quot;polar bear&quot; in Japanese. There are some views about the origin of the name.

In one account, there was a cotton shop in Kagoshima city. The shop started to sell kakigōri as its side-business. The kakigōri was flavored with condensed milk. When the owner was thinking of a name for it, he noticed the picture of a polar bear was printed on the labels of the condensed milk&#x27;s can.

Another account is that Mujaki, a coffee shop in Kagoshima City, started to sell the kakigōri, put milk syrup, &quot;sanshoku-kanten&quot; (colorful agar), yōkan (soft azuki-bean jelly), sweet beans and fruits in a pattern that resembled a polar bear when seen from overhead, so it was named shirokuma.

Yet others say that it was created in honour of the memory of Saigo Takamori after his battle with the Edo Shogun.

In Kagoshima, some similar named kakigōri are made. Kurokuma flavored with dark brown unrefined sugar syrup, coffee or caramel syrup and kiguma flavored with mango pulp syrup are made in some coffee shops.

===Availability===
Supermarkets in southern Kyushu, especially in Kagoshima City, Kagoshima, and mom-and-pop candy stores sell shirokuma as a popular product. Shirokuma are often eaten at Kagoshima fairs which are held in other prefectures. Shirokuma in cups are sold at convenience stores all over Japan. One of the brands found in stores, Marunaga Seika, received the Long Seller Award for their continuing work in enriching the Shirokuma distribution. The brand launched their Shirokuma product in 1972.

== Ujikintoki ==

Ujikintoki (宇治金時 or うじきんとき) is a type of Kakigōri that is made from shaved ice, flavored green tea syrup, sweet bean paste (Azuki bean), mochi, and green tea ice cream (抹茶アイスクリーム, Matcha aisu kurīmu).

=== Etymology ===
Ujikintoki is named after the small city of Uji, in Kyoto Prefecture, famous for its green tea and Sakata Kintoki, who is known as Kintarō in Japanese folklore. Kintoki is the red bean paste that is named after Kintarō&#x27;s face usually being depicted as red.

== Other varieties ==

=== Yakigori ===
Yakigori (焼き氷) is a type of Kakigōri where liquor, often brandy is poured on top and then lit on fire. Yakigori occasionally has caramel sauce, ice cream, strawberries, or pineapple on top.

<text>Anmitsu (, rarely ) is a &quot;wagashi&quot; (Japanese dessert) that dates to the Meiji era.

It is made of small cubes of agar jelly, a white translucent jelly made from red algae. The agar is dissolved with water (or fruit juice such as apple juice) to make the jelly. It is served in a bowl with sweet azuki bean paste or &quot;anko&quot; (the &quot;an&quot; part of &quot;anmitsu&quot;), boiled peas, often &quot;gyūhi&quot; and a variety of fruits such as peach slices, &quot;mikan&quot;, pieces of pineapples, and/or cherries. The anmitsu usually comes with a small pot of sweet black syrup, or &quot;mitsu&quot; (the &quot;mitsu&quot; part of &quot;anmitsu&quot;) which one pours onto the jelly before eating. Anmitsu is usually eaten with a spoon and fork.

A few variations on this dessert do exist. Mitsumame is anmitsu without bean paste, the &quot;mame&quot; meaning the peas that are served with the syrup and agar jelly instead. Cream anmitsu is anmitsu with ice cream on top. Shiratama dango are also commonly used as toppings.
