<text>General Sir John Monash (; 27 June 1865 – 8 October 1931) was an Australian civil engineer and military commander of the First World War. He commanded the 13th Infantry Brigade before the war and then, shortly after its outbreak, became commander of the 4th Brigade in Egypt, with which he took part in the Gallipoli campaign.

In July 1916, he took charge of the newly raised 3rd Division in north-western France and, in May 1918, became commander of the Australian Corps, at that time the largest corps on the Western Front. According to historian A. J. P. Taylor, he was &quot;the only general of creative originality produced by the First World War&quot;.

== Early life ==

Monash was born in 58 Dudley Street, West Melbourne, Victoria, to Jewish parents, both from Krotoschin in the Prussian province of Posen (now Krotoszyn, Poland). His birth certificate records his date of birth as 23 June 1865, but that is probably a mistake, because he was almost certainly born on 27 June. He was the first child of Louis Monash and his wife Bertha, née Manasse, who had arrived in Melbourne on the &quot;Empire of Peace&quot; on 5 June 1864. The family name was originally spelt &quot;Monasch&quot; and was pronounced with the emphasis on the second syllable.

The young family soon relocated from Dudley Street to larger premises on nearby Victoria Parade, before moving to a third rental property in Church Street, Richmond. In 1873, Bertha received a large inheritance from her mother, with which she purchased two houses, a large one in Yarra Street, Hawthorn, and a smaller one in Clifton Street, Richmond. The family resided in the smaller one and rented-out the larger one. The young John was sent to St Stephen&#x27;s School on Docker&#x27;s Hill in Richmond, and was remembered as a bright and alert schoolboy, with a special interest in English, some skill in drawing, a keen sense of fun, and no interest whatsoever in organised sport. At home his mother taught him piano, and encouraged him to read to her in English, French and German. The family spoke German as their native language. As might be expected from a man brought up by cultivated German parents who had arrived in Australia barely two years before John&#x27;s birth, Monash spoke, read, and wrote German fluently. However, from 1914 until his death, he had good reason not to attract attention to his German background.

In 1874, the family moved to the small town of Jerilderie, in the Riverina region of New South Wales, where his father ran a store. Monash later claimed to have met the bushranger Ned Kelly during the Kelly gang&#x27;s raid there in 1879. Monash attended the state school where his intelligence was recognised. The family was advised to move back to Melbourne to let John reach his full potential, which they did in 1877. Although his parents had largely abandoned religious practice, Monash celebrated his Bar Mitzvah at the East Melbourne Hebrew Congregation and sang in its choir. He was educated under Alexander Morrison at Scotch College, Melbourne, where he passed the matriculation examination when only 14 years of age. At age 16, he was dux of the school. He graduated from the University of Melbourne: a Master of Engineering in 1893; a Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Laws in 1895, and a Doctor of Engineering in 1921.

On 8 April 1891, Monash married Hannah Victoria Moss (1871–1920), and their only child, Bertha, was born in 1893. Monash had previously engaged in an affair with Annie Gabriel, the wife of one of his colleagues, which ended as an active matter after his conscious choice of &#x27;Vic&#x27; for marriage (though communication continued many years afterwards). He worked as a civil engineer, and played a major role in introducing reinforced concrete to Australian engineering practice. He initially worked for private contractors on bridge and railway construction, and as their advocate in contract arbitrations. Following a period with the Melbourne Harbor Trust, in 1894 he entered into partnership with J. T. N. Anderson as consultants and contractors. When the partnership was dissolved in 1905 he joined with the builder David Mitchell and industrial chemist John Gibson to form the Reinforced Concrete &amp; Monier Pipe Construction Co, and in 1906 with them and businessmen from South Australia, to form the S. A. Reinforced Concrete Co. He took a leading part in his profession and became president of the Victorian Institute of Engineers and a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers, London.

Monash joined the university company of the militia in 1884, and he became a lieutenant in the North Melbourne battery on 5 April 1887. He was promoted to captain in 1895 and in April 1897 was promoted to major and given command of the battery. On 7 March 1908, he was promoted to lieutenant-colonel in the intelligence corps. He was given command of the 13th Infantry Brigade in 1912, and was promoted colonel on 1 July 1913.

== First World War ==

=== Gallipoli ===
When the First World War broke out in August 1914, Monash became a full-time army officer, accepting an appointment as the chief censor in Australia. Monash did not enjoy the job, and was keen for a field command. In September, after the Australian Imperial Force was formed, he was appointed as the commander of the 4th Infantry Brigade, which consisted of four battalions: the 13th, 14th, 15th and 16th. His appointment was met with some protest within the military, in part due to his German and Jewish ancestry, but Monash was supported by numerous high-ranking officers, including James Legge, James McCay and Ian Hamilton, and his appointment stood.

When the first contingent of Australian troops, the 1st Division, sailed in October, the 4th Brigade remained behind. Training was undertaken at Broadmeadows, Victoria, before embarking in December 1914. After arriving in Egypt in January 1915, Monash&#x27;s brigade established itself at Heliopolis, where it was assigned to the New Zealand and Australian Division under Major General Alexander Godley. After a period of training, in April, the brigade took part in the Gallipoli campaign against the Turks. Assigned the role of divisional reserve, Monash came ashore early on 26 April. The brigade initially defended the line between Pope&#x27;s Hill and Courtney&#x27;s Post, and the valley behind this line became known as &quot;Monash Valley&quot;. There he made a name for himself with his independent decision-making and his organisational ability. He was promoted to brigadier general in July, although the news was marred by spiteful rumours that were passed in Cairo, Melbourne and London about him being a &quot;German spy&quot;. His promotion was gazetted in September, with effect from 15 September 1914.

During the August offensive, launched by the Allies to break the deadlock on the peninsula, Monash&#x27;s brigade was to conduct a &quot;left hook&quot; to capture of Hill 971, the highest point on the Sari Bair range. On the evening of 6/7 August, the brigade launched its attack, but poor maps, heavy resistance and the mountainous terrain defeated them. Elsewhere, the offensive also stalled, resulting in disaster for the last co-ordinated effort to defeat the Turkish forces on the Gallipoli Peninsula. By mid-August, Monash&#x27;s brigade was down to just 1,400 men out of the 3,350 at the beginning of the campaign. On 21 August, Monash led them in an attack on Hill 60, before it was withdrawn from the peninsula for rest. While the brigade recuperated on Lemnos, Monash took leave in Egypt, where he learned of his appointment as a Companion of the Order of the Bath. In November, the 4th Brigade returned to Gallipoli, occupying a &quot;quiet sector&quot; around Bauchop&#x27;s Hill. Monash used his engineering knowledge to improve his brigade&#x27;s position to withstand the winter, and he worked to improve the conditions that his troops would have to endure but, in mid-December, the order to evacuate the peninsula came.

Monash&#x27;s time on Gallipoli and his departure from it were not, however, without controversy for reasons unrelated to the fighting. While on Gallipoli he &quot;wrote very freely to his wife revealing much current information&quot; and &quot;opened himself to the criticism that he would not keep the rules by which his juniors had strictly to adhere.&quot; Later, in a long diary-letter sent home by Monash and known by him to be illegal in Army terms, Monash implied that he was &quot;one of the very last off Gallipoli&quot;. However, &quot;he had left for the beach nearly five hours before the last. It was a clumsy deception as so many people knew the facts.&quot;

Following the withdrawal from Gallipoli, Monash returned to Egypt, where the AIF underwent a period of reorganisation and expansion. That process resulted in the 4th Brigade being split, providing a cadre of experienced personnel to form the 12th Brigade. It was also reassigned to the 4th Division. After a period of training, Monash&#x27;s brigade undertook defensive duties along the Suez Canal. On 25 April 1916, the first anniversary of the landing at Gallipoli, while at Tel-el-Kebir, Monash and his men solemnly observed Anzac Day. Monash distributed red ribbons to soldiers present at the first landing and blue ribbons to those who came later.

=== Western Front ===
In June 1916, Monash and his command were transferred to the Western Front, being sent to the front around Armentières. On 10 July, Monash was promoted to temporary major general and placed in command of the Australian 3rd Division. He trained the division in England with attention to detail, and after the division was sent to the Western Front in November 1916, including Messines, Broodseinde, and the First Battle of Passchendaele, with some successes, but incurring the usual heavy casualties. The British High Command was impressed by Monash and, according to biographer Geoffery Serle, while dining with Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, Monash was informed that Haig &quot;wanted him as a corps commander&quot;.

Monash&#x27;s division spent the winter of 1917–1918 around Ploegsteert. Early the following year, after the Germans launched their Spring Offensive, the 3rd Division was deployed to undertake defensive operations around Amiens. Throughout April and May, the division undertook several peaceful penetration operations. Monash later described the recapture of the town of Villers-Bretonneux on 25 April 1918, after the Germans had overrun the 8th British Division under General William Heneker, as the turning-point of the war. Sir Thomas William Glasgow&#x27;s 13th Brigade, and Harold Elliott&#x27;s 15th Brigade, were both heavily involved in the operation.

=== Commander of the Australian Corps ===
On 1 June 1918, the promotion of Monash to lieutenant general and commander of the Australian Corps, at the time the largest individual corps on the Western Front, was confirmed.

Monash&#x27;s promotion was not without contention. Among those who considered and advocated for Major General Brudenell White to have command of the Australian Corps were Australia&#x27;s Official War Correspondent and later Official Historian, Charles Bean, and journalist Keith Murdoch, although historian Justin Chadwick has written that Bean was one of many of that view.

Bean had reservations about Monash&#x27;s &quot;ideals&quot;. and was said to have a general prejudice against Monash&#x27;s Prussian Jewish background. According to Kelly, Bean&#x27;s core motivation at that time was that Brudenell White&#x27;s appointment was in the best interest of the AIF, and that it would be a big mistake for White to leave the Australian Corps and go with Birdwood to the British Fifth Army. Historian Burness noted that Bean did recognise Monash&#x27;s ability and was not concerned that he should be promoted, but he considered Brudenell White was better fitted to command the fighting corps.
In that climate Hughes arrived at the front, before the Battle of Hamel, prepared to replace Monash but, after consulting with senior officers, and having seen the superb power of planning and execution displayed by Monash, he changed his mind.

In his Official History, Charles Bean noted that Monash was more effective the higher he rose within the Army. His depth of knowledge not only of military matters, but also of engineering and business, ensured that his operational plans were the product of meticulous preparation and thorough and rigorous scrutiny.

Bean later wrote of his own &quot;high intentioned but ill-judged intervention&quot; and that &quot;those who took action (relating to Monash&#x27;s appointment) did so as I afterwards realised, without adequate appreciation of Monash, who, though his reputation as a front line soldier had been poor, was never the less a much greater man than most of us then thought.&quot;

At the Battle of Hamel on 4 July 1918, Monash, with the support of the British 4th Army commander Sir Henry Rawlinson, commanded the 4th Australian Division, supported by the British 5th Tank Brigade, along with a detachment of American troops, to win a small but operationally significant victory for the Allies.

On 8 August 1918, the Battle of Amiens was launched. Allied troops under the command of Haig, predominantly Rawlinson&#x27;s British 4th Army (consisting of the Australian Corps under Monash, Canadian Corps under Sir Arthur Currie, British III Corps under Butler and British Cavalry Corps under Kavanagh), attacked the Germans. The Australian Corps sprearheaded the allied attack. Monash gave them, as a key objective in the first phase, the capture of enemy artillery, in order to minimise the potential harm to the attacking forces.
The battle was a strong, significant victory for the Allies, the first decisive win for the British Army of the war, causing the Germans to recognise that for them the War was lost. The defeated German leader, General Erich Ludendorff, described it in the following words: &quot;August 8th was the black day of the German Army in the history of the war&quot;. Those operations were just a start of a broad Allied offensive across the Western Front. On 12 August 1918, at Château de Bertangles, Monash was knighted by King George V as a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath.

After that, the Australians achieved under Monash a series of victories against the Germans at Chuignes, Mont St Quentin, Peronne and Hargicourt. Of the battle of Mt St Quentin and the subsequent taking of the town of Peronne, Charles Bean wrote in the Official History: &quot;the dash, intelligence, and persistence of the troops dealt a stunning blow to five German divisions, drove the enemy from one of its key positions in France, and took 2,600 prisoners at a cost of slightly over 3,000 casualties.&quot;

Monash had 208,000 men under his command, including 50,000 inexperienced Americans. He planned the attack on the German defences at the Battle of the Hindenburg Line between 16 September and 5 October 1918. The Allies had eventually breached the Hindenburg Line by 5 October, and the war was essentially over. On 5 October, Prinz Max von Baden, on behalf of the German Government, asked for an immediate armistice.

By the end of the war, Monash had acquired an outstanding reputation for intellect, personal magnetism, management and ingenuity. He also won the respect and loyalty of his troops. His motto was &quot;Feed your troops on victory&quot;. Monash was regarded with great respect by the British. A British captain on the staff of William Heneker&#x27;s 8th Division described Monash as &quot;a great bullock of a man... though his manners were pleasant and his behaviour far from rough, I have seen few men who gave me such a sensation of force... a fit leader for the wild men he commanded&quot;. Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery later wrote: &quot;I would name Sir John Monash as the best general on the western front in Europe&quot;.

For his services during the War, and in addition to his creation as a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath, Monash was appointed as a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George on 1 January 1919. He also received numerous foreign honours – the French appointed him a Grand Officer of the and awarded him the Croix de Guerre, the Belgians appointed him a Grand Officer of the Order of the Crown (&quot;Grand-Officier Ordre de la Couronne&quot;) and awarded him the Croix de Guerre, and the United States awarded him the Distinguished Service Medal. The Australian Government honoured Monash with promotion to the full rank of general explicitly &quot;in recognition of his long and distinguished service with the Australian military forces&quot; on 11 November 1929.

== After the war ==
In October 1918, towards the end of the war, Australian War Historian, Charles Bean, had urged Prime Minister William Hughes to have a plan of repatriation drawn up by the AIF and to put Monash in charge of it. Soon after the cessation of hostilities in November 1918, Hughes requested that Monash return to London to take up the appointment as Director-General of Repatriation and Demobilisation, heading a newly created department to carry out the repatriation of Australian troops from Europe.

In August 1919, while in London, Monash wrote &quot;The Australian Victories in France in 1918&quot; which was published in 1920. According to Geoffrey Searle: &quot;It was propaganda, but not far off the truth,&quot; and &quot;(it) laid the groundwork for the popular narrative of &#x27;Monash- the-war-winner.&#x27;&quot; Monash was, nevertheless, a noted advocate of the co-ordinated use of infantry, aircraft, artillery and tanks. As he wrote in the book:

He returned to Australia on 26 December 1919 to an enthusiastic welcome. On 1 January 1920, he was promoted to the substantive rank of lieutenant-general and returned to the reserves.

Shortly after his return, on 27 February 1920, Monash&#x27;s wife, Vic, died of cervical cancer. Monash had a prolonged affair with Elizabeth &quot;Lizette&quot; Bentwitch, a first cousin of the prominent Zionist Herbert Bentwich. The two planned to marry after Vic&#x27;s death but Monash&#x27;s daughter put her foot down to stop the union. Later, Monash worked in prominent civilian positions, the most notable being as head of the State Electricity Commission of Victoria (SECV) after October 1920. From 1923 until his death eight years later, he was vice-chancellor of the University of Melbourne . Monash was a founding member of the Rotary Club of Melbourne, Australia&#x27;s first Rotary Club, and served as its second president (1922–1923). In 1927, he became president of the newly founded Zionist Federation of Australia and New Zealand.

In 1923, he was called upon by the Victorian Government of Harry Lawson to organise &quot;special constables&quot; to restore order during the 1923 Victorian Police strike. He was one of the principal organisers of the annual observance of ANZAC Day and oversaw the planning for Melbourne&#x27;s monumental war memorial, the Shrine of Remembrance. Monash was honoured with numerous awards and decorations from universities and foreign governments. According to his biographer Geoffrey Serle: &quot;[i]n the 1920s Monash was broadly accepted, not just in Victoria, as the greatest living Australian&quot;.

Monash died in Melbourne on 8 October 1931 from a heart attack, and he was given a state funeral. An estimated 300,000 mourners came to pay their respects, the nation&#x27;s largest funeral crowd to that time. After a Jewish service, and a 17-gun salute, he was buried in Brighton General Cemetery. In a final sign of humility, despite his achievements, honours and titles, he instructed that his tombstone simply bear the words &quot;John Monash&quot;. He was survived by his daughter, Bertha (1893–1979).

=== Military impact ===
According to British historian A. J. P. Taylor, Monash was &quot;the only general of creative originality produced by the First World War.&quot; Monash&#x27;s impact on Australian military thinking was significant in three areas. First, he was the first Australian to fully command Australian forces and he took, as following Australian commanders did, a relatively independent line with his British superiors. Second, he promoted the concept of the commander&#x27;s duty to ensure the safety and well-being of his troops to a pre-eminent position in a philosophy of &quot;collective individualism&quot;. And finally, he, along with staff officer Thomas Blamey, forcefully demonstrated the benefit of thorough planning and integration of all arms of the forces available, and of all of the components supporting the front line forces, including logistical, medical and recreational services. Troops later recounted that one of the most extraordinary things about the Battle of Hamel was not the use of armoured tanks, nor the tremendous success of the operation, but the fact that in the midst of battle Monash had arranged delivery of hot meals up to the front line.

=== Cultural impact ===
In recognition of his enduring influence, Monash&#x27;s face is on the $100 note, Australia&#x27;s highest-value currency note. Monash&#x27;s success in part reflected the tolerance of Australian society but, to a larger degree, his success – in the harshest experience the young nation had suffered – shaped that tolerance and demonstrated to Australians that the Australian character was diverse, multi-ethnic, and a blend of the traditions of the &quot;bush&quot; and the &quot;city&quot;. According to author Colin MacInnes, as recounted by Monash&#x27;s biographer, Geoffrey Serle, Monash&#x27;s &quot;presence and prestige...made anti-Semitism...impossible in Australia&quot;. He is also honoured in a Cantata for chorus, soloists and orchestra called &quot;Peace – A Cantata for John Monash&quot;, by composer/conductor David Kram.

=== Movement for posthumous recognition ===
Since 2013, there has been a movement to posthumously promote Monash to the rank of field marshal. Monash would be the fourth person, and only second Australian-born person, to hold this rank. The movement was led by Tim Fischer, former Australian Deputy Prime Minister and author of the book, &quot;Maestro John Monash: Australia&#x27;s Greatest Citizen General&quot;, and supported by other Australian Members of Parliament including Josh Frydenberg and Cathy McGowan. According to Fischer, Monash was denied promotion during his life due to discrimination, including as a result of his German-Jewish ancestry and his status as a reservist rather than professional soldier.

In October 2015, the Jerilderie Shire Council unanimously adopted the &quot;Jerilderie Proposition&quot;, calling on the Australian Government to promote Monash:Following on the outstanding contribution of Sir John Monash to state and nation before, during and after World War I and reflecting the fact that Sir John Monash received no Australian awards or honours post 11 November 1918, the Prime Minister approve by government gazette publication the posthumous promotion of one step in rank of General Sir John Monash to the rank of Australian field marshal, with effect 11 November 1930, one year after Sir John Monash was eventually promoted to the rank of general.

In fact, Monash was recognised after November 1918 by the Australian Government, and was promoted to the full rank of general by the Prime Minister James Scullin in recognition of his long and distinguished service with the Australian military forces on Armistice Day 11 November 1929. On 14 April 2018, Neil James, Executive Director of the Australian Defence Association, suggested that posthumously promoting Monash was unnecessary and &quot;would demean his record.&quot; James also wrote that the campaign to do so highlighted the problem of &quot;emotive mythology about our military history.&quot; He pointed out that Harry Chauvel was the first Australian to command a division and become a corps commander, being promoted to lieutenant general a year before Monash. James added: &quot;I have yet to meet or even hear of [a military historian] who supports the Monash promotion proposal&quot;. Three days after James&#x27; comments the Australian Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, announced that Monash would not be promoted posthumously to field marshal.

<doc id="149622" wikidata="Q986194" url="?curid=149622" title="Disposable income">
<text>Disposable income is total personal income minus current taxes on income. In national accounting, personal income minus personal current taxes equals disposable personal income or household disposable income. Subtracting personal outlays (which includes the major category of personal [or private] consumption expenditure) yields personal (or, private) savings, hence the income left after paying away all the taxes is referred to as disposable income.

Restated, consumption expenditure plus savings equals disposable income after accounting for transfers such as payments to children in school or elderly parents&#x27; living and care arrangements.

The marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is the fraction of a change in disposable income that is consumed. For example, if disposable income rises by $100, and $65 of that $100 is consumed, the MPC is 65%. Restated, the marginal propensity to save is 35%.

For the purposes of calculating the amount of income subject to garnishments, United States&#x27; federal law defines disposable income as an individual&#x27;s compensation (including salary, overtime, bonuses, commission, and paid leave) after the deduction of health insurance premiums and any amounts required to be deducted by law. Amounts required to be deducted by law include federal, state, and local taxes, state unemployment and disability taxes, social security taxes, and other garnishments or levies, but does not include such deductions as voluntary retirement contributions and transportation deductions. Those deductions would be made only after calculating the amount of the garnishment or levy. The definition of disposable income varies for the purpose of state and local garnishments and levies.

The consumer leverage ratio is the expression of the ratio of total household debt to disposable income.

==Meanings of disposable income==
Disposable income can be understood as: 

* National disposable income of a country: The national income minus current transfers (current taxes on income, wealth etc., social contributions, social benefits and other current transfers), plus current transfers receivable by resident units from the rest of the world.
* Disposable personal (or family/household) income: The income that individuals or households have for their spending.

==Discretionary income==
Discretionary income is disposable income (after-tax income), minus all payments that are necessary to meet current bills. It is total personal income after subtracting taxes and minimal survival expenses (such as food, medicine, rent or mortgage, utilities, insurance, transportation, property maintenance, child support, etc.) to maintain a certain standard of living. Expenses that persist with zero income are termed autonomous consumption. Discretionary income is the amount of an individual&#x27;s income available for spending after the essentials have been taken care of:

formula_1
:formula_2
:formula_3

The term &quot;disposable income&quot; is often incorrectly used to denote discretionary income. For example, people commonly refer to disposable income as the amount of &quot;play money&quot; left to spend or save.

== In the national accounts ==
The system of national accounts defined the concept of disposable income for all institutional sectors of the economy. For corporations it is equal to profit retained, and for the government it is equal to taxes + income received from public corporation. The sum of disposable income across all institutional sectors is called the national disposable income.

<text>Wilhelm Carl Werner Otto Fritz Franz Wien (; 13 January 1864 – 30 August 1928) was a German physicist who, in 1893, used theories about heat and electromagnetism to deduce Wien&#x27;s displacement law, which calculates the emission of a blackbody at any temperature from the emission at any one reference temperature.

He also formulated an expression for the black-body radiation, which is correct in the photon-gas limit. His arguments were based on the notion of adiabatic invariance, and were instrumental for the formulation of quantum mechanics. Wien received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1911 for his work on heat radiation.

He was a cousin of Max Wien, inventor of the Wien bridge.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Wien was born at Gaffken (now in Baltiysky District) near Fischhausen in the Province of Prussia as the son of landowner Carl Wien. In 1866, his family moved to Drachenstein near Rastenburg (now Kętrzyn, Poland).

In 1879, Wien went to school in Rastenburg and from 1880 to 1882 he attended the city school of Heidelberg. In 1882 he attended the University of Göttingen and the University of Berlin. From 1883 to 1885, he worked in the laboratory of Hermann von Helmholtz and, in 1886, he received his Ph.D. with a thesis on the diffraction of light upon metals and on the influence of various materials upon the color of refracted light. From 1896 to 1899, Wien lectured at RWTH Aachen University. He became twice successor of Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen, in 1900 at the University of Würzburg and in 1920 at the University of Munich. Wien was very active in science politics representing conservative and nationalistic positions though being not as extreme as sharing the attitude of those going to develop the &quot;Deutsche Physik&quot;. He appreciated both Albert Einstein and relativity.

===Career===
In 1896 Wien empirically determined a distribution law of blackbody radiation, later named after him: Wien&#x27;s law. Max Planck, who was a colleague of Wien&#x27;s, did not believe in empirical laws, so using electromagnetism and thermodynamics, he proposed a theoretical basis for Wien&#x27;s law, which became the Wien–Planck law. However, Wien&#x27;s law was only valid at high frequencies, and underestimated the radiancy at low frequencies. Planck corrected the theory and proposed what is now called Planck&#x27;s law, which led to the development of quantum theory. However, Wien&#x27;s other empirical formulation formula_1, called Wien&#x27;s displacement law, is still very useful, as it relates the peak wavelength emitted by a body (&quot;λ&quot;max), to the temperature of the body (T). In 1900 (following the work of George Frederick Charles Searle), he assumed that the entire mass of matter is of electromagnetic origin and proposed the formula formula_2 for the relation between electromagnetic mass and electromagnetic energy.

Wien developed the Wien filter (also known as velocity selector) in 1898 for the study of anode rays. It is a device consisting of perpendicular electric and magnetic fields that can be used as a velocity filter for charged particles, for example in electron microscopes and spectrometers. It is used in accelerator mass spectrometry to select particles based on their speed. The device is composed of orthogonal electric and magnetic fields, such that particles with the correct speed will be unaffected while other particles will be deflected. It can be configured as a charged particle energy analyzer, monochromator, or mass spectrometer.

While studying streams of ionized gas, Wien, in 1898, identified a positive particle equal in mass to the hydrogen atom. Wien, with this work, laid the foundation of mass spectrometry. J. J. Thomson refined Wien&#x27;s apparatus and conducted further experiments in 1913 then, after work by Ernest Rutherford in 1919, Wien&#x27;s particle was accepted and named the proton.

In 1911, Wien was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics &quot;for his discoveries regarding the laws governing the radiation of heat&quot;. He delivered the Ernest Kempton Adams Lecture at Columbia University in 1913.

<text>Hospitality Club (HC) was a hospitality exchange service (a gift economy network for finding homestays whereby hosts were not allowed to charge for lodging) accessible via a website. HC&#x27;s specified goals were to facilitate &quot;intercultural understanding ... bringing people together ... travelers and locals&quot;.

==History==

Hospitality Club was founded in July 2000 in Koblenz, by Veit Kühne, who was inspired by a trip to South America. It later incorporated technology from Hospex.org, a similar service.

In 2005, a disagreement between some members of Hospitality Club and its founder led to the foundation of BeWelcome. Many HC members, who became volunteers within Couchsurfing, left HC towards CS because of its missing legal status and insufficient management transparency.

In February 2006, Kühne was working full-time on Hospitality Club. In the spring of 2006, an event took place in Riga with 430 participants from 36 countries.

As of July 2006, the site had 155,000 members. This number grew by around 1,000 new members a week in 2006. 

In 2007, Google Trends search volume for hospitalityclub.org started to decline and was overtaken by the search volume for CouchSurfing.

In 2008, HC had more than 400,000 members from 200 countries. 

In 2013, HC had more than a half of million members from 200 countries.

By 2017, only one third of members were still active.

By April 2022, the website was completely offline.

==Safety measures==
Hospitality Club had a reputation system, whereby members left references for others. For added safety, members were encouraged to check each other&#x27;s passports, although it rarely happened.

<doc id="149639" wikidata="Q216692" url="?curid=149639" title="Ludvig Holberg">
<text>Ludvig Holberg, Baron of Holberg (3 December 1684 – 28 January 1754) was a writer, essayist, philosopher, historian and playwright born in Bergen, Norway, during the time of the Dano–Norwegian dual monarchy. He was influenced by Humanism, the Enlightenment and the Baroque. Holberg is considered the founder of modern Danish and Norwegian literature. He was also a prominent Neo-Latin author, known across Europe for his writing. He is best known for the comedies he wrote in 1722–1723 for the Lille Grønnegade Theatre in Copenhagen. Holberg&#x27;s works about natural and common law were widely read by many Danish law students over two hundred years, from 1736 to 1936.

== Studies and teaching ==
Holberg was the youngest of six brothers. His father, Christian Nielsen Holberg, died before Ludvig was one year old. He was educated in Copenhagen, and was a teacher at the University of Copenhagen for many years. At the same time, he started his successful career as an author, writing the first of a series of comedies.

He began to study theology at the University of Copenhagen and later taught himself law, history and language. He was not particularly interested in theology as a career, settling for an &quot;attestats&quot; (similar to a Bachelor&#x27;s degree today), which gave him the right to work as a priest; he did not attempt a baccalaureus, magister or doctorate in the subject, nor did he follow a career as a theology professor, priest, or bishop. In Holberg&#x27;s youth, it was common to study theology and specialize according to one&#x27;s degree, for example in Greek, Latin, philosophy or history. For the purpose of becoming a lawyer, it was normal to study abroad. In 1736 the Danish Lawyer degree was established at the University of Copenhagen, a degree which continued to be granted for 200 years, and for which Holberg&#x27;s writings remained common reading material throughout this time. Holberg was formally appointed assistant professor after having first worked as one without pay. He had to accept the first available position, which was teaching metaphysics. Later, he became a professor and taught rhetoric and Latin. Finally, he was given a professorship in the subject which he prized most and was most productive in, history.

Holberg was well-educated and well-traveled. In his adolescence, he visited large cities in countries such as the Netherlands and France, and lived for a short period of time in Rome; and for a longer period of time in Oxford, England (1706–1708), which was rare during that time as intellectual life was centered in continental Europe. He was not formally admitted to Oxford University, but spent his time there using the libraries and participating in Latin discussions with the English students.

== Writings ==
Holberg&#x27;s travels were a main inspiration in his later writings these experiences matured him both artistically and morally. Holberg let himself be inspired by old Latin comedies and newer French comedies he had seen in Paris, and street theaters in Rome.

His writings can be divided into three periods, during which he produced mainly history, 1711–1718; mainly satirical poetry and stage comedies, 1719–1731; and mainly philosophy, 1731–1750. His rich output of comedies during the middle period was shaped by his role as house dramatist at Denmark&#x27;s first public theater, opened in Copenhagen in 1721. These comedies are the works on which his fame rests today, and they were an immediate and immense success. However the poverty caused by the Copenhagen Fire of 1728, brought a wave of depression and puritanism upon the nation, which clashed with Holberg&#x27;s satirical works, and as a consequence he gave up his comedies switching to philosophical and historical writings in 1731. Holberg&#x27;s only novel, the satirical science-fiction/fantasy &quot;Niels Klim&#x27;s Underground Travels&quot; was originally published in Latin in 1741 as &quot;Nicolai Klimii Iter Subterraneum&quot;.

== Ideology ==
In Paris, Holberg met the Danish-born French scientist Jacob Winsløw, who was Catholic. Winsløw tried to convert Holberg, without success. Holberg enjoyed the debate, but it started a rumor in Copenhagen that Holberg had converted to Catholicism as Winsløw had, and as a consequence he felt it necessary to deny this to the Danish public, giving voice to anti-Catholic views on several occasions.

Holberg believed in people&#x27;s inner divine light of reason, and to him it was important that the first goal of education was to teach students to use their senses and intellect, instead of uselessly memorising school books. This was a new, modern understanding of the question of religion, and it shows he was a man of the Age of Enlightenment. Holberg was interested in intellect because he felt that this is what binds society together. He also wondered why there was so much evil in the world, especially when one could let reason lead the way. One could say that he distanced himself from a religious explanation of evil towards a rational/empirical train of thought, and this is important because of his status as an author; both in his time and ours.

Holberg was open to biblical criticism, and his religious representation was, for the most part, deism. He was critical of the notion of original sin, instead subscribing to the notion of man&#x27;s free will.

Holberg&#x27;s declared intentions with his authorship were to enlighten people to better society. This also fits in with the picture of Holberg as of the age of enlightenment. It is worth noting that Holberg enjoyed larger cities with deep culture – small cities and nature did not interest him.

Like many scholars of his time, Holberg also influenced science. Holberg&#x27;s concept for science was that it should be inductive (through experience built on observations) and practical to use. One example is his &quot;Betænkning over den nu regierende Qvæg-Syge&quot; (&quot;Memorandum on the prevalent cattle disease&quot;) (1745) where he reasons that the disease is caused by microorganisms.

== Finances ==
=== In youth ===
Holberg had to live a modest life in his youth and early adulthood. He earned a living as a tutor and as a travel companion for noblemen and tried to work as a private sports coach at the university. He received further support from a grant to travel to other universities in other countries, namely Protestant universities, but it was a condition he did not respect since he searched out those places where the discussion were the loudest and the experiences were the largest.

During his stay in England, Holberg set his eyes on academic authoring and on his return, he started writing about history. Later, he wrote also about natural and international law, possibly at the prompting of an older professor who likened him to natural and international law authors such as Hugo Grotius and Samuel Pufendorf.

To make the most possible profit, Holberg published his own works and sold them as papers under a subscription to interested people, either bound or in looseleaf sheets. Holberg also tried, with some success, a publisher in Norway. There, his book about natural and international law was printed in several editions but did not garner him financial gains.

=== Investments ===
Holberg lived modestly and was able to invest a large part of the profits from the sale of his books on the side and lend them out or invest them in more active ventures. Several times in his writings he criticized townspeople and nobles who used their resources in unproductive ways to be carried round in chairs, to live in lavish houses and waste money on luxury. He ate reasonably and did not use his money on being driven around. He said that his travelling on foot, and continued walking, was the reason he could keep his malaria, which had plagued him in the south, under control.

When he came to the conclusion he could put his money in better ventures than trading, he started investing in real estate. His first large property purchase, Brorupgaard close to Havrebjerg, happened in stages; first he lent money to the owner at that time, and later took over the farm himself.

Some years later, Holberg also purchased Tersløsegard by Dianalund, the only one of his properties which is preserved because the others in Bergen, Copenhagen and Havrebjerg have been either burned down or torn down.

;Sorø Academy and Holberg&#x27;s will;
Holberg was both unmarried and childless, but in the end of his life had a small fortune. He was interested in leaving a legacy and left his estate to Sorø Academy, which was a royal riding academy, with the goal of creating an institution at a university level for young men coming from nobility. Holberg supported the idea of the academy, worked out suggestions to which academic direction it would take and was asked by the king&#x27;s superintendent to refer some professors for the school. The influential Enlightenment writer Jens Schielderup Sneedorff was appointed professor at Sorø Academy at Holbergs request.

The agreement with the king included that Holberg would be free of taxes from any income from the farms he owned, because the amount donated to the school should be larger than the amount he would pay in taxes. At the same time, he earned the title of &quot;Baron of Holberg&quot;.

Holberg&#x27;s casket, a work of Johannes Wiedewelt, can be seen in Sorø Monastery Church.

=== Examples of Holberg&#x27;s financial management ===
It can be seen from Holberg&#x27;s correspondence that he was very conservative with money where he thought it would not be of any use; for example, he was against raising the wage of the pedagogues of Havrebjerg.

Holberg commented several times that he was willing to use money if it were put to good use, for example, he would use money on medication and supplies for his farm hands if they suffered from injury or illness.

When academia had large economic difficulties, because funding was very limited, Holberg agreed to help fund the academy (at Sorø Academy) while he was alive.

== Tributes ==
Norwegian Edvard Grieg composed the &quot;Holberg Suite&quot; (opus 40) to honor Holberg. The suite is in the style of country dances from Holberg&#x27;s time. In 1911 Johan Halvorsen composed incidental music for a production of Holberg&#x27;s &quot;Barselstuen&quot; (The Lying-in Room) in Oslo. Halvorsen later arranged the music into his &quot;Suite Ancienne&quot; op. 31, which he dedicated to the memory of Holberg.

The Norwegian University of Bergen awards the Holberg International Memorial Prize. The 4.5 million kroner (ca. €520,000) endowed prize was awarded to Julia Kristeva in 2004, to Jürgen Habermas in 2005, and to Shmuel Eisenstadt in 2006.

There is a town named after Holberg on northern Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. It was founded by Danish immigrants in 1907.

Dan Shore&#x27;s opera &quot;The Beautiful Bridegroom,&quot; for six sopranos, is based on Holberg&#x27;s last play, &quot;Den forvandlede Brudgom.&quot;

There is a statue of Holberg and a boulevard named after him (&quot;Holbergsallmenningen&quot;) in the centre of Bergen, Norway.

A crater on Mercury is named for him.

<text>A V-type (volcanic-type) asteroid, or Vestoid, is an asteroid whose spectral type is that of 4 Vesta. Approximately 6% of main-belt asteroids are vestoids, with Vesta being by far the largest of them. They are relatively bright, and rather similar to the more common S-type asteroid, which are also made up of stony irons and ordinary chondrites, with V-types containing more pyroxene than S-types.

A large proportion of vestoids have orbital elements similar to those of Vesta, either close enough to be part of the Vesta family, or having similar eccentricities and inclinations but with a semi-major axis lying between about 2.18 AU and the 3:1 Kirkwood gap at 2.50 AU. This suggests that they originated as fragments of Vesta&#x27;s crust. There seem to be two populations of Vestoids, one created 2 billion years ago and the other 1 billion years ago, coming respectively from the enormous southern-hemisphere craters Veneneia and Rheasilvia. Fragments that ended up in the 3:1 Jupiter resonance were perturbed out of the Kirkwood gap and some fragments eventually hit the earth as HED meteorites.

The electromagnetic spectrum has a very strong absorption feature longward of 0.75 μm, another feature around 1 μm and is very red shortwards of 0.7 μm. The visible wavelength spectrum of the V-type asteroids (including 4 Vesta itself) is similar to the spectra of basaltic achondrite HED meteorites.

A J-type has been suggested for asteroids having a particularly strong 1 μm absorption band similar to diogenite meteorites, likely being derived from deeper parts of the crust of 4 Vesta.

== Distribution ==
The vast majority of V-type asteroids are members of the Vesta family along with Vesta itself. There are some Mars-crossers such as 9969 Braille, and some Near-Earth objects like 3908 Nyx.

There is also a scattered group of objects in the general vicinity of the Vesta family but not part of it. These include:
* 809 Lundia — Orbits within the Flora family region
* 956 Elisa
* 1459 Magnya — Orbits in the outer asteroid belt, too far from Vesta to be genetically related. May be the remains of a different ancient differentiated body that was shattered long ago.
* 2113 Ehrdni
* 2442 Corbett
* 2566 Kirghizia
* 2579 Spartacus — Contains a significant portion of olivine, which may indicate origin deeper within Vestoid than other V-types.
* 2640 Hallstrom
* 2653 Principia
* 2704 Julian Loewe
* 2763 Jeans
* 2795 Lepage
* 2851 Harbin
* 2912 Lapalma
* 3849 Incidentia
* 3850 Peltier — Orbits within the Flora family region
* 3869 Norton
* 4188 Kitezh
* 4278 Harvey — Member of Baptistina family.
* 4434 Nikulin
* 4796 Lewis
* 4977 Rauthgundis
* 5379 Abehiroshi

== V-type near-Earth asteroids ==

V-type NEAS (or V-NEAs) are near-Earth asteroids with a V spectral type. Impacts of V-NEAs on the Earth, according to the known sample (data taken in 2016), occur once in about 12 million years and have the potential to cause disastrous effects on regional to global scale, producing craters as large as 30 km in diameter and releasing kinetic energy of as much as 3 Mt. This energy is almost 6 million times greater than the energy released during the Chelyabinsk event in 2013. Venus, Mars and the Moon will experience impacts with V-NEAs every 22 Myr, 125 Myr and 168 Myr, respectively. Two craters with confirmed basaltic impactor which fits with the impact rate found from V-type NEAs are the Strangways crater (24 km diameter) in Australia, the Nicholson crater (12.5 km diameter) in Canada. Some V-NEAs have orbits similar to that of the Bunburra Rockhole meteorite.

<doc id="149644" wikidata="Q1477251" url="?curid=149644" title="Dye-sublimation printing">
<text>Dye-sublimation printing (or dye-sub printing) is a term that covers several distinct digital computer printing techniques that involve using heat to transfer dye onto a substrate. 

The sublimation name was first applied because the dye was thought to make the transition between the solid and gas states without going through a liquid stage. This understanding of the process was later shown to be incorrect, as there is some liquefication of the dye. Since then, the process has become properly known as dye diffusion, though this technically correct term has not supplanted the original name.&lt;ref name=&quot;Drake/ Han&quot;&gt; Chemical technology in Printing and Imaging Systems, ed. J A G Drake, 1993, pp 73-85&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, &quot;dye sublimation&quot; referred to page printers that use a thermal printhead to transfer dye from a ribbon directly onto the print media via sublimation. While it originally was used in creating prepress proofs, today this technology survives in ID card printers and dedicated photo printers, often under the name dye diffusion thermal transfer (D2T2).

The term was later also applied to the indirect sublimation transfer printing process, which uses a standard ink-jet printer to deposit sublimation-capable ink onto a transfer sheet. The printed transfer sheet is then pressed with the substrate with heat, transferring the dye to the substrate, such as plastic or fabric, via sublimation. Thus, this process is &quot;indirect&quot;, since the final substrate does not pass through the printer, and the sublimation step occurs separately. 

The term direct dye sublimation is sometimes applied to a variant of digital textile printing using dye-sublimation inks printed directly onto fabric, which must then be heated to set the dyes, &quot;without&quot; the use of a transfer sheet.

== Dye-sublimation page printing ==

===Process===
Using a mechanism which is a variant of the thermal-transfer printer, the most common direct process lays down one color at a time, the dye being stored on a polyester ribbon that has each color on a separate panel. Each colored panel is the size of the medium that is being printed on; for example, a 4x6 in (10x15cm) dye-sub printer would have four 4x6 in (10x15cm) panels.

During the printing cycle, the printer rollers will move the medium and one of the colored panels together under a thermal printing head, which is usually the same width as the shorter dimension of the print medium. Tiny heating elements on the head change temperature rapidly, laying different amounts of dye depending on the amount of heat applied. Some of the dye diffuses into the printing medium.

After the printer finishes printing the medium in one color, it advances the ribbon to the next color panel and partially ejects the medium from the printer to prepare for the next cycle. The entire process is repeated four or five times in total: the first three lay the colors onto the medium to form a complete image; there may or may not then be a (wax ink) black thermal transfer process; the last pass lays the laminate over top. This layer protects the dyes from UV light and moisture.

For ID card printing, sharp text and bar codes are necessary, and they are printed by means of an additional wax-based black panel on the (YMCKO) ribbon. This extra panel works by thermal transfer printing instead of dye diffusion: a whole layer, instead of just some of the dye in the layer, transfers from the ribbon to the substrate at the pixels defined by the thermal head.

=== Applications ===
==== Industrial and Commercial Settings ====
Previously, the use of dye-sub printing was limited to industrial or high-end commercial printing. Dye-sub photo printing has been used in medical imaging, graphic arts proofing, security, and broadcast-related applications. 

==== Rising Popularity: Dye-Sublimation in Event Photography ====
Today, it is extremely popular in event photography and photo booths or kiosks that require high-speed, on-demand printing.

==== Affordable Dye-Sublimation: Home Consumers and Postcard-Sized ====
Alps Electric produced the first quality dye-sub printers for home consumers in the $500–$1,000 price range, bringing dye-sublimation technology within the reach of a wider audience. (These models were, however, not true page printers, since they used a narrow printhead that swept across the page, like most inkjet printers.) Now there are many dye-sublimation printers on the market starting from as low as $100, especially postcard-sized mobile photo printers.

==== ID Photography and Card Printing ====
The ability to produce instant photo prints inexpensively from a small printer has led to dye sublimation solutions supplanting traditional instant photos in some applications, such as ID photography with a card printer.

==== Desktop and Photo booth Applications ====
Several corporations market desktop-size units as stand-alone printers and for print kiosk and photo booth applications. Some of these units are based on generic printers. Some manufacturers, offer software development kits with their printers, suggesting that these companies hope to attract system integrators as a potential market.

==== Event Photography: Immediate Lab-Quality Prints ====
Desktop-size standalone dye-sub photo printers are also used by photographers in event photography. The technology allows photographers to produce and sell lab-quality prints immediately during the event they are attending, with a minimal amount of hardware.

As dye-sublimation page printers utilize heat to transfer the dye onto the print media, the printing speed is limited by the speed at which the elements on the thermal head can change temperature. Heating the elements is easy, as a strong electric current can raise the temperature of an element very quickly. However, cooling the elements down, when changing from a darker to a lighter color, is harder and usually involves having a fan/heatsink assembly attached to the print head. The use of multiple heads can also speed up this process since one head can cool down while another is printing. Although print times vary among different dye-sublimation printers, a typical consumer dye-sub printer can print a 4x6 in (10x15cm) photo in 45–90 seconds. More heavy-duty printers can print much faster; for example, a Sinfonia Colorstream S2 dye-sublimation printer can print a 4x6 in (10x15cm) photo in as little as 6.8 seconds, and a Mitsubishi CP-D707DW is known to have a faster print of under 6 seconds for similar size. In all cases, the finished print is completely dry once it emerges from the printer.

=== Comparison with inkjet printing ===
Traditionally, the advantage of dye-sublimation printing has been the fact that it is a continuous-tone technology, where each dot can be any color. In contrast, inkjet printers can vary the location and size of ink droplets, a process called dithering, but each drop of ink is limited to the colors of the inks installed. Consequently, a dye-sublimation printer produces true continuous tones appearing much like a chemical photograph. An inkjet print is composed of droplets of ink layered and scattered to simulate continuous tones, but under magnification, the individual droplets can be seen. In the early days of inkjet printing, the large droplets and low resolution made inkjet prints significantly inferior to dye-sublimation, but many of today&#x27;s inkjets produce extremely high-quality prints using microscopic droplets and supplementary ink colors, producing superior color fidelity and sharpness to dye-sublimation.

Dye sublimation offers some advantages over inkjet printing. For one, the prints are dry and ready to handle as soon as they exit the printer. Since the thermal head does not have to sweep back and forth over the print media, there are fewer moving parts that can break down. The whole printing cycle is extremely clean as there are no liquid inks to clean up. These factors make dye-sublimation generally a more reliable technology than inkjet printing.

Dye-sublimation printers have some drawbacks compared to inkjet printers. Each of the colored panels of the ribbons, and the thermal head itself, must match the size of the media that is being printed on. Furthermore, only especially coated paper or specific plastics can accept the sublimated ink. This means that dye-sublimation printers cannot match the flexibility of inkjet printers in printing on a wide range of media.

The dyes diffuse a small amount before being absorbed by the media. Consequently, prints are not razor-sharp. For photographs, this produces very natural prints, but for other uses (such as graphic design) this slight blurriness is a disadvantage.

The amount of wasted dye per page is also very high; most of the dye in the four panels may be wasted for a typical print. Once a panel has been used, even to just print a single dot, the remaining dye on that panel cannot be reused for another print without leaving a blank spot where the dye was used previously. Due to the single-roll design of most printers, four panels of colored dye must be used for every print, whether or not a panel is needed for the print. Printing in monochrome saves nothing, and the three unused color panels for that page cannot be recycled for a different single-color print. Inkjet printers also suffer from &#x27;dye wastage&#x27; as the ink cartridges are prone to drying up with low usage (without &#x27;heavy use&#x27;, the cartridge nozzles can become clogged with dried ink). Dye-sublimation media packs, which include both ribbon and paper, are rated for an exact number of prints which yields a fixed cost per print. This is in contrast to inkjet printers where inks are purchased by volume.

For environments that print confidential or secret documents, a dye-sublimation printer is a potential security risk that must be handled carefully. Due to the mechanism of printing, a perfect color-separated negative image of the printed page remains on the spent ribbon panels, and the &quot;waste roll&quot; of dye panels can be unrolled to see everything that has been printed with the printer. For such environments, the waste roll should be shredded or incinerated onsite rather than simply being discarded in the trash. Also, for home users, the waste roll from a photo printer can be similarly recovered from the garbage and used to see everything that has been printed. Since the supply roll is plastic, the lifespan of a used roll can be years or decades long, permitting image recovery long after disposal.

Also, dye-sublimation papers and ribbons are sensitive to skin oils, which interfere with the dye&#x27;s ability to sublimate from the ribbon to the paper. They must also be free of dust particles, which can lead to small colored blobs appearing on the prints. Most dye-sublimation printers have filters and/or cleaning rollers to reduce the likelihood of this happening, and a speck of dust can only affect one print as it becomes attached to the print during the printing process. Finally, dye-sublimation printers fall short when producing neutral and toned black-and-white prints with higher density levels and virtually no metamerism or bronzing.

==Sublimation transfer printing==
Sublimation transfer printing is a digital printing technology using full-color artwork that works with polyester and polymer-coated substrates. Originally used for printing polyester fabrics, the process is now commonly also used for decorating apparel, signs, and banners, as well as novelty items such as cell phone covers, plaques, coffee mugs, mouse mats, and other items with sublimation-friendly surfaces. 

The images are first printed onto coated heat-resistant transfer paper as a mirror-image of the final design, which is then transferred from the transfer sheet onto the substrate using a heat press. 

Early large-format printers used for printing transfer paper were modified electrostatic plotters using toner, but now are generally large-format inkjet printers using special inks. For small-format printing, inkjet has also become the dominant technology, though special dye-sublimation transfer laser printers are also available.

In order to transfer the image from the paper to the substrate, it requires a heat press machine process that is a combination of time, temperature, and pressure. Different settings are used depending on the substrate. This application will transfer the sublimation dyes at the molecular level into the substrate. The most common dyes used for sublimation activate at 350 degrees Fahrenheit / 175 degrees Celsius. However, a range of 380 to 420 degrees Fahrenheit / 195 to 215 degrees Celsius is normally recommended for optimal color.

The result of the sublimation transfer process is a nearly permanent, high-resolution, full-color print. Because the dyes are infused into the substrate at the molecular level, rather than applied at a topical level (such as with screen printing and direct to garment printing), the prints will not crack, fade or peel from the substrate under normal conditions. The fabric is permanently dyed so it can be washed without damaging the quality of the image.
Advantages of dye-sublimation over other methods of textile printing: images are permanent and do not peel or fade, the dye does not build up on the fabric.
Colors can be extraordinarily brilliant due to the bonding of the dye to the transparent fibers of the synthetic fabric, truly continuous tones can be achieved that are equivalent to photographs, without the use of special techniques such as half-screen printing, and the image can be printed all over the entire item, with no difficulty in printing all the way to the edges.

=== Piezo inkjet transfer printing ===
There are two types of dye sublimation inks for piezo inkjet transfer printers available in the market. The most popular one is aqueous dye sublimation ink for use in both desktop and large format printers. The other is solvent dye sublimation ink that can be used in XAAR, Spectra, and some Konica printhead-wide format printers.

Due to the fast development of digital textile printing, dye sublimation inks are becoming more and more popular in digital inkjet printing on fabrics.

Print speeds for large-format piezo inkjet printers using aqueous dye sublimation ink continue to increase. Speeds range from 18 square meters per hour in a smaller 44 in wide printer to over 3,000 square meters per hour in a high-speed industrial textile printer.

==Direct dye-sublimation fabric printing==
In this type of digital textile printing, an inkjet printer is used to print dye-sublimation inks directly onto the fabric. The fabric is then heated in an oven or on a calender to diffuse and set the dyes.

<text>The Hamiltonian path problem is a topic discussed in the fields of complexity theory and graph theory. It decides if a directed or undirected graph, &quot;G&quot;, contains a Hamiltonian path, a path that visits every vertex in the graph exactly once. The problem may specify the start and end of the path, in which case the starting vertex &quot;s&quot; and ending vertex &quot;t&quot; must be identified.

The Hamiltonian cycle problem is similar to the Hamiltonian path problem, except it asks if a given graph contains a Hamiltonian cycle. This problem may also specify the start of the cycle. The Hamiltonian cycle problem is a special case of the travelling salesman problem, obtained by setting the distance between two cities to one if they are adjacent and two otherwise, and verifying that the total distance travelled is equal to &quot;n.&quot; If so, the route is a Hamiltonian cycle.

The Hamiltonian path problem and the Hamiltonian cycle problem belong to the class of NP-complete problems, as shown in Michael Garey and David S. Johnson&#x27;s book Computers and Intractability: A Guide to the Theory of NP-Completeness and Richard Karp&#x27;s list of 21 NP-complete problems.

== Reductions ==

=== Reduction from the path problem to the cycle problem ===
The problems of finding a Hamiltonian path and a Hamiltonian cycle can be related as follows:

* In one direction, the Hamiltonian path problem for graph &quot;G&quot; can be related to the Hamiltonian cycle problem in a graph &quot;H&quot; obtained from &quot;G&quot; by adding a new universal vertex &quot;x&quot;, connecting &quot;x&quot; to all vertices of &quot;G&quot;. Thus, finding a Hamiltonian path cannot be significantly slower (in the worst case, as a function of the number of vertices) than finding a Hamiltonian cycle. 
* In the other direction, the Hamiltonian cycle problem for a graph &quot;G&quot; is equivalent to the Hamiltonian path problem in the graph &quot;H&quot; obtained by adding terminal (degree-one) vertices &quot;s&quot; and &quot;t&quot; attached respectively to a vertex v of G and to &quot;v&#x27;,&quot; a cleaved copy of &quot;v&quot; which gives &quot;v&#x27; &quot;the same neighbourhood as &quot;v&quot;. The Hamiltonian path in &quot;H&quot; running through vertices corresponds to the Hamiltonian cycle in &quot;G&quot; running through .

==Algorithms==

=== Brute force ===
To decide if a graph has a Hamiltonian path, one would have to check each possible path in the input graph G. There are &quot;n&quot;! different sequences of vertices that &quot;might&quot; be Hamiltonian paths in a given &quot;n&quot;-vertex graph (and are, in a complete graph), so a brute force search algorithm that tests all possible sequences would be very slow.

=== Partial paths ===
An early exact algorithm for finding a Hamiltonian cycle on a directed graph was the enumerative algorithm of Martello. A search procedure by Frank Rubin divides the edges of the graph into three classes: those that must be in the path, those that cannot be in the path, and undecided. As the search proceeds, a set of decision rules classifies the undecided edges, and determines whether to halt or continue the search. Edges that cannot be in the path can be eliminated, so the search gets continually smaller. The algorithm also divides the graph into components that can be solved separately, greatly reducing the search size. In practice, this algorithm is still the fastest.

=== Dynamic programming ===
Also, a dynamic programming algorithm of Bellman, Held, and Karp can be used to solve the problem in time O(&quot;n&quot;2 2&quot;n&quot;). In this method, one determines, for each set &quot;S&quot; of vertices and each vertex &quot;v&quot; in &quot;S&quot;, whether there is a path that covers exactly the vertices in &quot;S&quot; and ends at &quot;v&quot;. For each choice of &quot;S&quot; and &quot;v&quot;, a path exists for (&quot;S&quot;,&quot;v&quot;) if and only if &quot;v&quot; has a neighbor &quot;w&quot; such that a path exists for (&quot;S&quot; − &quot;v&quot;,&quot;w&quot;), which can be looked up from already-computed information in the dynamic program.

=== Monte Carlo ===
Andreas Björklund provided an alternative approach using the inclusion–exclusion principle to reduce the problem of counting the number of Hamiltonian cycles to a simpler counting problem, of counting cycle covers, which can be solved by computing certain matrix determinants. Using this method, he showed how to solve the Hamiltonian cycle problem in arbitrary &quot;n&quot;-vertex graphs by a Monte Carlo algorithm in time O(1.657&quot;n&quot;); for bipartite graphs this algorithm can be further improved to time O(1.415&quot;n&quot;).

=== Backtracking ===
For graphs of maximum degree three, a careful backtracking search can find a Hamiltonian cycle (if one exists) in time O(1.251&quot;n&quot;).

=== Boolean satisfiability ===
Hamiltonian paths can be found using a SAT solver. The Hamiltonian path is NP-Complete meaning it can be mapping reduced to the 3-SAT problem. As a result, finding a solution to the Hamiltonian Path problem is equivalent to finding a solution for 3-SAT.

=== Unconventional methods ===
Because of the difficulty of solving the Hamiltonian path and cycle problems on conventional computers, they have also been studied in unconventional models of computing. For instance, Leonard Adleman showed that the Hamiltonian path problem may be solved using a DNA computer. Exploiting the parallelism inherent in chemical reactions, the problem may be solved using a number of chemical reaction steps linear in the number of vertices of the graph; however, it requires a factorial number of DNA molecules to participate in the reaction.

An optical solution to the Hamiltonian problem has been proposed as well. The idea is to create a graph-like structure made from optical cables and beam splitters which are traversed by light in order to construct a solution for the problem. The weak point of this approach is the required amount of energy which is exponential in the number of nodes.

==Complexity==
The problem of finding a Hamiltonian cycle or path is in FNP; the analogous decision problem is to test whether a Hamiltonian cycle or path exists. The directed and undirected Hamiltonian cycle problems were two of Karp&#x27;s 21 NP-complete problems. They remain NP-complete even for special kinds of graphs, such as:

* bipartite graphs,
* undirected planar graphs of maximum degree three, 
* directed planar graphs with indegree and outdegree at most two, 
* bridgeless undirected planar 3-regular bipartite graphs, 
* 3-connected 3-regular bipartite graphs, 
* subgraphs of the square grid graph, 
* cubic subgraphs of the square grid graph.

However, for some special classes of graphs, the problem can be solved in polynomial time:

* 4-connected planar graphs are always Hamiltonian by a result due to Tutte, and the computational task of finding a Hamiltonian cycle in these graphs can be carried out in linear time by computing a so-called Tutte path. 
* Tutte proved this result by showing that every 2-connected planar graph contains a Tutte path. Tutte paths in turn can be computed in quadratic time even for 2-connected planar graphs, which may be used to find Hamiltonian cycles and long cycles in generalizations of planar graphs.

Putting all of these conditions together, it remains open whether 3-connected 3-regular bipartite planar graphs must always contain a Hamiltonian cycle, in which case the problem restricted to those graphs could not be NP-complete; see Barnette&#x27;s conjecture.

In graphs in which all vertices have odd degree, an argument related to the handshaking lemma shows that the number of Hamiltonian cycles through any fixed edge is always even, so if one Hamiltonian cycle is given, then a second one must also exist. However, finding this second cycle does not seem to be an easy computational task. Papadimitriou defined the complexity class PPA to encapsulate problems such as this one.

== Polynomial time verifier ==

The Hamiltonian path problem is NP-Complete meaning a proposed solution can be verified in polynomial time.

A verifier algorithm for Hamiltonian path will take as input a graph G, starting vertex s, and ending vertex t. Additionally, verifiers require a potential solution known as a certificate, c. For the Hamiltonian Path problem, c would consist of a string of vertices where the first vertex is the start of the proposed path and the last is the end. The algorithm will determine if c is a valid Hamiltonian Path in G and if so, accept.

To decide this, the algorithm first verifies that all of the vertices in G appear exactly once in c. If this check passes, next, the algorithm will ensure that the first vertex in c is equal to s and the last vertex is equal to t. Lastly, to verify that c is a valid path, the algorithm must check that every edge between vertices in c is indeed an edge in G. If any of these checks fail, the algorithm will reject. Otherwise, it will accept.

The algorithm can check in polynomial time if the vertices in G appear once in c. Additionally, it takes polynomial time to check the start and end vertices, as well as the edges between vertices. Therefore, the algorithm is a polynomial time verifier for the Hamiltonian path problem.

== Applications ==

=== Networks on chip ===
Networks on chip (NoC) are used in computer systems and processors serving as communication for on-chip components. The performance of NoC is determined by the method it uses to move packets of data across a network. The Hamiltonian Path problem can be implemented as a path-based method in multicast routing. Path-based multicast algorithms will determine if there is a Hamiltonian path from the start node to each end node and send packets across the corresponding path. Utilizing this strategy guarantees deadlock and livelock free routing, increasing the efficiency of the NoC.

=== Computer graphics ===
Rendering engines are a form of software used in computer graphics to generate images or models from input data. In three dimensional graphics rendering, a common input to the engine is a polygon mesh. The time it takes to render the object is dependent on the rate at which the input is received, meaning the larger the input the longer the rendering time. For triangle meshes, however, the rendering time can be decreased by up to a factor of three. This is done through &quot;ordering the triangles so that consecutive triangles share a face.&quot; That way, only one vertex changes between each consecutive triangle. This ordering exists if the dual graph of the triangular mesh contains a Hamiltonian path.

<text>Johan Banér (23 June 1596 – 10 May 1641) was a Swedish field marshal in the Thirty Years&#x27; War.

==Early life==
Johan Banér was born at Djursholm Castle in Uppland. As a four-year-old he was forced to witness the execution of his father, the Privy Councillour Gustaf Banér, and uncle, Sten Axelsson Banér (also a Privy Councillour), at the Linköping Bloodbath in 1600, due to accusations of high treason by King Charles IX because of their support of King Sigismund. Though it was the father of King Gustavus Adolphus who had Banér&#x27;s father executed, the two men developed a strong friendship from an early age, mostly due to Gustavus Adolphus reinstating the Banér family shortly after his coronation.

==Military career==
Banér joined the Swedish Army in 1615, and distinguished himself during the Swedish Siege of Pskov.

He served with distinction in wars against Russia and Poland, and had reached the rank of colonel by the age of 25.

In 1630, Gustavus Adolphus landed in Germany to assist German Protestant forces in the Thirty Years War, and, as one of the king&#x27;s chief subordinates, Banér served in the campaign of north Germany, including leading the right wing of Swedish cavalry at the first Battle of Breitenfeld. He was present at the taking of Augsburg and Munich, and rendered conspicuous service at the Lech and at Donauwörth.

At the unsuccessful assault on Albrecht von Wallenstein&#x27;s camp at the Alte Veste, Banér received a wound, and soon afterwards, when Gustavus marched towards Lützen, was left in command in the west, where he opposed the imperial general Johann von Aldringen. Two years later, as Swedish field marshal, Banér, with 16,000 men, entered Bohemia and, combining with the Saxon army, marched on Prague. However, the complete defeat of Bernard of Saxe-Weimar in the first Battle of Nördlingen stopped his victorious advance.

After this event, the Peace of Prague placed the Swedish army in a very precarious position, but the victories won by the united forces of Banér and Alexander Leslie at Wittstock (4 October 1636), restored the paramount influence of Sweden in central Germany. Banér, in his report to Queen Christina on the battle of Wittstock, stated the following: &quot;[My soldiers] would have fallen into total disorder if Field-Marshal Leslie with the five brigades of foot which he had with him during the battle had not assisted us just in time and manfully attacked and turned 4 brigades of the enemy’s infantry away from us so that we could finally gain our breath&quot;.

However, the three combined armies were considerably inferior in force to those they had defeated, and in 1637 Banér was unable to make headway against the enemy. Rescuing with great difficulty the beleaguered garrison of Torgau, he retreated beyond the Oder into Pomerania.

In 1639, however, he again overran northern Germany, defeated the Saxons at Chemnitz and invaded Bohemia itself. The winter of 1640–1641 Banér spent in the west. His last achievement was an audacious &quot;coup de main&quot; on the Danube. Breaking camp in mid-winter (a very rare event in the 17th century), he united with the French under the Comte de Guébriant and surprised Regensburg, where the Diet was sitting. Only the break-up of the ice prevented the capture of the place. Banér thereupon had to retreat to Halberstadt. Here, on 10 May 1641, he died, possibly due to advanced liver cirrhosis caused by his excessive alcohol consumption, after designating Lennart Torstenson as his successor. He was much beloved by his men, who bore his body with them on the field of Wolfenbüttel. On the other hand, the enemies of Sweden rejoiced and a parody requiem hoping that he was burning in hell was even composed in Bohemia, which had been badly pillaged by Banér. He was buried at the Riddarholmen Church in Stockholm.

==Assessment==
Banér as a general achieved his best results during the reign of Queen Christina under the command of Axel Oxenstierna. Because it can be claimed there were different reasons for victory in the Swedish victory at Wittstock (as testified by his differing reports of 1636 and 1640) the battle of Chemnitz may well have been his finest hour. He reputedly declined tempting offers that were made to him by the emperor to induce him to enter his service.

==Family==
In 1623, Banér married Catharina Elisabeth von Pfuel (1598–1636), Lady in waiting of Maria Eleonora of Sweden and daughter of Adam von Pfuel zu Johansfelde und Vichel and his wife, Barbara von Burgsdorff. She died on 20. February 1636. On 25. July 1636 Banér married Countess Elisabeth Juliana von Erbach (1600–1640), widow of Count Count Georg Ludwig von Löwenstein-Scharfeneck (1587–1633) and daughter of George III, Count of Erbach-Breuberg and his wife, Countess Maria von Barby-Mühlingen (1563–1619). After the death of his second wife, he married for the third time to Margravine Johanna von Baden-Durlach (1623–1661). He had children only with his first wife. His son from his first marriage, Gustaf Adam (1624–1681) received the dignity of Count Banér af Sortavala.

<text>The Tees–Exe line is a northeast-southwest line that can be drawn on a map of Great Britain which roughly divides the island into lowland and upland regions.

The line links the mouth of the River Tees between Redcar and Hartlepool in the north east of England with the mouth of the River Exe in Devon in the south west. To the south and east of this line, the landscape, whilst not always flat, is mostly lower and is characterised by flat-lying or gently tilted or folded sedimentary rocks. North and west of this line are the older, generally harder rocks including igneous and metamorphic rocks and the Palaeozoic and Precambrian sandstones and limestones which usually stand out as upland areas. The areas to the north and west of the line also have a generally wetter climate than areas to the east and south. The varying ease of agriculture above and below this line historically has left a visible effect on the population density of the UK, with a concentration of settlements in the south-east.

Other lines can be drawn, for similar purposes, between the Severn Estuary and the Wash, and between the Severn and the mouth of the River Trent. The Cross Country Route follows the line by railway along most of the length.

<text>The administrative divisions of China have consisted of several levels since 1412, due to mainland China&#x27;s large population and geographical area. In the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the constitution provides for three levels of government. However in practice, there are five levels of local government; the provincial (province, autonomous region, municipality, and special administrative region), prefecture, county, township, and village.

Since the 17th century, provincial boundaries in mainland China have remained largely static. Major changes since then have been the reorganization of provinces in the northeast after the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949 and the formation of autonomous regions, based on Soviet ethnic policies. The provinces serve an important cultural role in China, as people tend to identify with their native province.

==Levels==
The Constitution of the People&#x27;s Republic of China provides for three levels: the provincial, the county level, and the township level. However, in practice, there are four levels of government: the provincial, the prefectural level, the county level, and the township level. Rural villages and urban communities are sometimes considered as the fifth level, however they are defined by the constitution as &quot;basic level autonomies&quot; and there is no government on this level. , China administers 33 provincial-level regions, 334 prefecture-level divisions, 2,862 county-level divisions, 41,034 township-level administrations, and 704,382 basic-level autonomies.

Each of the levels (except &quot;special administrative regions&quot;) corresponds to a level in the Civil Service of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

===Summary===
This table summarizes the divisions of the area administered by the People&#x27;s Republic of China .

===Table===

===Provincial level (1st)=== 
The People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) lays claims to 34 province-level divisions, including 22 provinces, 5 autonomous regions, 4 municipalities, and 2 special administrative regions and 1 claimed province.

Provinces are theoretically subservient to the PRC central government, but in practice, provincial officials have large discretion with regard to economic policy. Unlike the United States, the power of the central government was (with the exception of the military) not exercised through a parallel set of institutions until the early 1990s. The actual practical power of the provinces has created what some economists call &quot;federalism with Chinese characteristics&quot;.

Most of the provinces, with the exception of those in the northeast, have boundaries which were established long ago in the Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties. Sometimes provincial borders form cultural or geographical boundaries. This was an attempt by the imperial government to discourage separatism and warlordism through a divide and rule policy. Nevertheless, provinces have come to serve an important cultural role in China. People tend to be identified in terms of their native provinces, and each province has a stereotype that corresponds to their inhabitants.

The most recent administrative change have included the elevation of Hainan (1988) and Chongqing (1997) to provincial level status, and the creation of Hong Kong (1997) and Macau (1999) as Special administrative regions.

Provincial level governments vary in details of organization:
====Provincial-level (1st) subdivisions====


=== Prefectural level (2nd) ===


Prefectural level divisions or second-level divisions are the second level of the administrative structure. Most provinces are divided into only prefecture-level cities and contain no other second level administrative units. Of the 22 provinces and 5 autonomous regions, only 3 provinces (Yunnan, Guizhou, Qinghai) and 1 autonomous region (Xinjiang) have more than three second-level or prefectural-level divisions that are not prefecture-level cities. As of June 2020, there were 339 prefectural level divisions:

=== County level (3rd) ===

As of 18 August 2015, there were 2,852 county-level divisions:
===Township level (4th)===
====Township-level (4th) subdivisions====
===Basic level autonomy (5th)===
The basic level autonomy serves as an organizational division (census, mail system) and does not have much importance in political representative power. Basic local divisions such as neighborhoods and communities are not informal, but have defined boundaries and elected heads (one per area):

In urban areas, every subdistrict of a district of a city administers many communities or residential committees. Each of them has a residential committee to administer the dwellers of that neighborhood or community. Rural areas are organized into village committees or villager groups. A &quot;village&quot; in this case can either be a natural village, one that spontaneously and naturally exists, or a virtual village, which is a bureaucratic entity.

====Village-level (5th) subdivisions====
===Special cases===
Five cities formally on prefectural level have a special status in regard to planning and budget. They are separately listed in the five-year and annual state plans on the same level as provinces and national ministries, making them economically independent of their provincial government. These cities specifically designated in the state plan () are
* Dalian (Liaoning)
* Ningbo (Zhejiang)
* Qingdao (Shandong)
* Shenzhen (Guangdong)
* Xiamen (Fujian)

In terms of budget authority, their governments have the &quot;de facto&quot; status of a province, but their legislative organs (National People&#x27;s Congress and Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference) and other authorities not related to the economy are on the level of a prefecture and under the leadership of the province.

Some other large prefecture-level cities, known as sub-provincial cities, are &quot;half a level&quot; below a province. The mayors of these cities have the same rank as a vice governor of a province, and their district governments are half a rank higher than those of normal districts. The capitals of some provinces (seat of provincial government) are sub-provincial cities. In addition to the five cities specifically designated in the state plan, sub-provincial cities are:
* Harbin (Heilongjiang)
* Changchun (Jilin)
* Shenyang (Liaoning)
* Jinan (Shandong)
* Nanjing (Jiangsu)
* Hangzhou (Zhejiang)
* Guangzhou (Guangdong)
* Wuhan (Hubei)
* Chengdu (Sichuan)
* Xi&#x27;an (Shaanxi)

A similar case exists with some county-level cities. Some county-level cities are given more autonomy. These cities are known as sub-prefecture-level cities, meaning that they are given a level of power higher than a county, but still lower than a prefecture. Such cities are also &quot;half a level&quot; higher than what they would normally be. Sub-prefecture-level cities are often not put into any prefecture (i.e. they are directly administered by their province). Examples of sub-prefecture-level cities include Jiyuan (Henan province), Xiantao, Qianjiang and Tianmen (Hubei), Golmud (Qinghai), Manzhouli (Inner Mongolia), Shihanza, Tumushuk, Aral, and Wujiaqu (Xinjiang).

Some districts are also placed at &quot;half a level&quot; higher that what it should be. Examples are Pudong, Shanghai and Binhai, Tianjin. Although its status as a district of a municipality would define it as prefecture-level, the district head of Pudong is given sub-provincial powers. In other words, it is &quot;half a level&quot; higher than what it would normally be.
==== Special cases subdivisions ====
== Ambiguity of the word &quot;city&quot; in China ==
The Chinese word &quot;&quot; (shì) is usually loosely translated into English as &quot;city&quot;. However, it has several different meanings due to the complexity of the administrative divisions used in China. Despite being urban or having urban centers, the SARs are almost never referred to as &quot;Hong Kong City&quot;/&quot;Macau City&quot; in contemporary Chinese and thus are not covered by the description below.

By its political level, when a &quot;city&quot; is referred to, it can be a:
* LV 1 (provincial-level):
** Municipality of China, literally &quot;direct-controlled city&quot; in Chinese, there being actually four: Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai and Chongqing
* LV 2 (prefecture-level):
** Sub-provincial city, for example, Shenzhen in Guangdong Province
** Prefecture-level city, for example, Shijiazhuang, capital of Hebei Province
* LV 3 (county-level):
** Sub-prefecture-level city, for example, Jiyuan (directly under the administration of Henan Province)
** County-level city, for example, Yiwu (under the administration of the prefecture-level city of Jinhua)

By its actual area and population, it can be:
* Province-like, which is the municipality of Chongqing, a merger of 4 former prefectures and similar to the former Eastern-Sichuan province.
* Prefecture-like, which are the other three municipalities and almost all prefectural-level cities, usually 10–1,000 times larger than the urban center and a conglomeration of several counties and county-level cities. Some of them in sparsely populated areas like Hulunbuir are even larger than Chongqing but have a population comparable to that of prefectures.
* County-like, which is all sub-prefecture-level and some county-level cities, and several extremely simple prefecture-level cities (Jiayuguan, Xiamen, Haikou, etc).
* Not substantially larger than urban establishment: some county-level cities, plus some members of the previous category. However, country-level cities converted from counties are unlikely to belong here. Shanghai, despite being prefecture-like in size, belongs here due to its subway already extending beyond municipality limits. Some other economically prosperous prefecture-level cities are also provoking inter-prefecture urban integration, although they still possess (and never intend to eliminate) large swaths of rural area.

When used in the statistical data, the word &quot;city&quot; may have three different meanings:
* The area administrated by the city. For the municipality, the sub-provincial city, or the prefecture-level city, a &quot;city&quot; in this sense includes all of the counties, county-level cities, and city districts that the city governs. For the Sub-prefecture-level city or the County-level city, it includes all of the subdistricts, towns and townships that it has.
* The area comprising its urban city districts and suburb city districts. The difference between the urban district and the suburb districts is that an urban district comprises only the subdistricts, while a suburb district also has towns and townships to govern rural areas. In some sense, this definition is approximately the metropolitan area. This definition is not applied to the sub-prefecture-level city and the county-level city since they do not have city districts under them.
** Somewhat bizarrely, some districts such as Haidian District also possess towns. They have been treated clearly as urban districts for decades, but not from the inception, some areas are rural but other areas form an inseparable part of the central city.
* The urban area. Sometimes the urban area is referred as (). For the municipality, the sub-provincial city, and the prefecture-level city, it comprises the urban city district and the adjacent subdistricts of the suburb city districts. For the sub-prefecture-level city and the county-level city, only central subdistricts are included. This definition is close to the strict meaning of &quot;city&quot; in western countries.

The choice of definition of &quot;city&quot; used for statistical data of Chinese cities can lead to different results. For example, Shanghai is the largest city in China by population in the urban area but is smaller than Chongqing by the population within the administration area.

== History ==

Before the establishment of the Qin dynasty, China was ruled by a network of kings, nobles, and tribes. The rivalry of these groups culminated in the Warring States period, and the state of Qin eventually emerged dominant.
The Qin dynasty was determined not to allow China to fall back into disunity, and therefore designed the first hierarchical administrative divisions in China, based on two levels: &quot;jùn&quot; commanderies and &quot;xiàn&quot; counties. The Han dynasty that came immediately after added &quot;zhōu&quot; (usually translated as &quot;provinces&quot;) as the third level on top, forming a three-tier structure.

The Sui and Tang dynasties abolished commanderies, and added circuits (&quot;dào&quot;, later &quot;lù&quot; under the Song and Jin) on top, maintaining a three-tier system that lasted through the 13th century. (As a second-level division, &quot;zhou&quot; are translated as &quot;prefectures&quot;.) The Mongol-established Yuan dynasty introduced the modern precursors to provinces, bringing the number of levels to four. This system was then kept more or less intact until the Qing dynasty, the last imperial dynasty to rule China.

The Republic of China streamlined the levels to just provinces and counties in 1928 and made the first attempt to extend political administration beyond the county level by establishing townships below counties. This was also the system officially adopted by the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949, which defined the administrative divisions of China as three levels: provinces, counties, and townships.

In practice, however, more levels were inserted. The ROC government soon learned that it was not feasible for a province to directly govern tens and sometimes hundreds of counties. Started from Jiangxi province in 1935, prefectures were later inserted between provinces and counties. They continued to be ubiquitously applied by the PRC government to nearly all areas of China until the 1980s. Since then, most of the prefectures were converted into prefecture-level cities. Greater administrative areas were inserted on top of provinces by the PRC government, but they were soon abolished, in 1954. District public offices were inserted between counties and townships; once ubiquitous as well, they are currently being abolished and very few remain.

The most recent major developments have been the establishment of Chongqing as a municipality and the creation of Hong Kong and Macau as special administrative regions.

==Reform==

In recent years there have been calls to reform the administrative divisions and levels of China. Rumours of an impending major reform have also spread through various online bulletin boards.

The district public offices is an ongoing reform to remove an extra level of administration from between the county and township levels. There have also been calls to abolish the prefecture-level, and some provinces have transferred some of the power prefectures currently hold to the counties they govern. There are also calls to reduce the size of the provinces. The ultimate goal is to reduce the different administration levels from five to three (Provincial level, County level, Village level), reducing the amount of corruption as well as the number of government workers, in order to lower the budget.

<doc id="149661" wikidata="Q2469245" url="?curid=149661" title="Piracy in the Caribbean">
<text>The &quot;Piracy of the Caribbean&quot; refers to the historical period of widespread piracy that occurred in the Caribbean Sea. Primarily between the 1650s and 1730s, where pirates frequently attacked and robbed merchant ships sailing through the region, often using bases or islands like port royal. The era of piracy in the Caribbean began in the 1500s and phased out in the 1830s after the navies of the nations of Western Europe and North America with colonies in the Caribbean began hunting and prosecuting pirates. The period during which pirates were most successful was from the 1650s to the 1730s. Piracy flourished in the Caribbean because of the existence of pirate seaports such as Fort Saint Louis in Martinique, Port Royal in Jamaica, Castillo de la Real Fuerza in Cuba, Tortuga in Haiti, and Nassau in the Bahamas. Piracy in the Caribbean was part of a larger historical phenomenon of piracy, as it existed close to major trade and exploration routes in almost all the five oceans.

==Causes==

Pirates were often former sailors experienced in naval warfare. In the 16th century, pirate captains recruited seamen to loot European merchant ships, especially the Spanish treasure fleets sailing from the Caribbean to Europe.
The following quote by an 18th-century Welsh captain shows the motivations for piracy:

—Pirate Captain Bartholomew Roberts

Piracy was sometimes given legal status by the colonial powers, especially France under King Francis I (r. 1515–1547), in the hope of weakening Spain and Portugal&#x27;s &quot;mare clausum&quot; trade monopolies in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. This officially sanctioned piracy was known as privateering. From 1520 to 1560, French privateers were alone in their fight against the Crown of Spain and the vast commerce of the Spanish Empire in the New World. The French privateers were not considered pirates in France as they were in the service of the king of France, they were considered combatants and granted a lettre de marque or lettre de course which legitimized any actions they took under the French justice system. They were later joined by the English and Dutch. The English were dubbed &quot;sea dogs&quot;.

The Caribbean had become an important center of European trade and colonization after Columbus&#x27; discovery of the New World for Spain in 1492. In the 1494 Treaty of Tordesillas the non-European world had been divided between the Spanish and the Portuguese along a north–south line 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands. This gave Spain control of the Americas, a position the Spaniards later reiterated with an equally unenforceable papal bull (The Inter caetera). On the Spanish Main, the key early settlements were Cartagena in present-day Colombia, Porto Bello and Panama City on the Isthmus of Panama, Santiago on the southeastern coast of Cuba, and Santo Domingo on the island of Hispaniola. In the 16th century, the Spanish were mining extremely large quantities of silver from the mines of Zacatecas in New Spain (Mexico) and Potosí in Bolivia (formerly known as Upper Peru). The huge Spanish silver shipments from the New World to the Old attracted pirates and French privateers like François Leclerc or Jean Fleury, both in the Caribbean and across the Atlantic, all along the route from the Caribbean to Seville.
To combat this constant danger, in the 1560s the Spanish adopted a convoy system. A treasure fleet or &quot;flota&quot; would sail annually from Seville (and later from Cádiz) in Spain, carrying passengers, troops, and European manufactured goods to the Spanish colonies of the New World. This cargo, though profitable, was really just a form of ballast for the fleet as its true purpose was to transport the year&#x27;s worth of silver to Europe. The first stage in the journey was the transport of all that silver from the mines in Bolivia and New Spain in a mule convoy called the Silver Train to a major Spanish port, usually on the Isthmus of Panama or Veracruz in New Spain. The &quot;flota&quot; would meet up with the Silver Train, offload its cargo of manufactured goods to waiting colonial merchants and then load its holds with the precious cargo of gold and silver, in bullion or coin form. This made the returning Spanish treasure fleet a tempting target, although pirates were more likely to shadow the fleet to attack stragglers than to engage the well-armed main vessels. The classic route for the treasure fleet in the Caribbean was through the Lesser Antilles to the ports along the Spanish Main on the coast of Central America and New Spain, then northwards into the Yucatán Channel to catch the westerly winds back to Europe.

By the 1560s, the Dutch United Provinces of the Netherlands and England, both Protestant states, were defiantly opposed to Catholic Spain, the greatest power of Christendom in the 16th century; while the French government was seeking to expand its colonial holdings in the New World now that Spain had proven they could be extremely profitable. It was the French who had established the first non-Spanish settlement in the Caribbean when they had founded Fort Caroline near what is now Jacksonville, Florida in 1564, although the settlement was soon wiped out by a Spanish attack from the larger colony of Saint Augustine. As the Treaty of Tordesillas had proven unenforceable, a new concept of &quot;lines of amity&quot;, with the northern bound being the Tropic of Cancer and the eastern bound the Prime Meridian passing through the Canary Islands, is said to have been verbally agreed upon by French and Spanish negotiators of the Peace of Cateau-Cambrésis. South and west of these lines, respectively, no protection could be offered to non-Spanish ships, &quot;no peace beyond the line.&quot; English, Dutch and French pirates and settlers moved into this region even in times of nominal peace with the Spanish.

The Spanish, despite being the most powerful state in Christendom at the time, could not afford a sufficient military presence to control such a vast area of ocean or enforce their exclusionary, mercantilist trading laws. These laws allowed only Spanish merchants to trade with the colonists of the Spanish Empire in the Americas. This arrangement provoked constant smuggling against the Spanish trading laws and new attempts at Caribbean colonization in peacetime by England, France and the Netherlands. Whenever a war was declared in Europe between the Great Powers the result was always widespread piracy and privateering throughout the Caribbean.

The Anglo-Spanish War in 1585–1604 was partly due to trade disputes in the New World. A focus on extracting mineral and agricultural wealth from the New World rather than building productive, self-sustaining settlements in its colonies; inflation fueled in part by the massive shipments of silver and gold to Western Europe; endless rounds of expensive wars in Europe; an aristocracy that disdained commercial opportunities; and an inefficient system of tolls and tariffs that hampered industry all contributed to Spain&#x27;s decline during the 17th century. However, very profitable trade continued between Spain&#x27;s colonies, which continued to expand until the early 19th century.

Meanwhile, in the Caribbean, the arrival of European diseases with Columbus had reduced the local Native American populations; the native population of New Spain fell as much as 90% from its original numbers in the 16th century. This loss of native population led Spain to increasingly rely on African slave labor to run Spanish America&#x27;s colonies, plantations and mines and the trans-Atlantic slave trade offered new sources of profit for the many English, Dutch and French traders who could violate the Spanish mercantilist laws with impunity. But the relative emptiness of the Caribbean also made it an inviting place for England, France and the Netherlands to set up colonies of their own, especially as gold and silver became less important as commodities to be seized and were replaced by tobacco and sugar as cash crops that could make men very rich.

As Spain&#x27;s military might in Europe weakened, the Spanish trading laws in the New World were violated with greater frequency by the merchants of other nations. The Spanish port on the island of Trinidad off the northern coast of South America, permanently settled only in 1592, became a major point of contact between all the nations with a presence in the Caribbean.

==History==

===Early seventeenth century, 1600–1660===
====Changes in demography====
In the early 17th century, expensive fortifications and the size of the colonial garrisons at the major Spanish ports increased to deal with the enlarged presence of Spain&#x27;s competitors in the Caribbean, but the treasure fleet&#x27;s silver shipments and the number of Spanish-owned merchant ships operating in the region declined. Additional problems came from shortage of food supplies because of the lack of people to work farms. The number of European-born Spaniards in the New World or Spaniards of pure blood who had been born in New Spain, known as peninsulares and creoles, respectively, in the Spanish caste system, totaled no more than 250,000 people in 1600.

At the same time, England and France were powers on the rise in 17th-century Europe as they mastered their own internal religious schisms between Catholics and Protestants and the resulting societal peace allowed their economies to rapidly expand. England especially began to turn its people&#x27;s maritime skills into the basis of commercial prosperity. English and French kings of the early 17th century—James I (r. 1603–1625) and Henry IV (r. 1598–1610), respectively, each sought more peaceful relations with Habsburg Spain in an attempt to decrease the financial costs of the ongoing wars. Although the onset of peace in 1604 reduced the opportunities for both piracy and privateering against Spain&#x27;s colonies, neither monarch discouraged his nation from trying to plant new colonies in the New World and break the Spanish monopoly on the Western Hemisphere. The reputed riches, pleasant climate and the general emptiness of the Americas all beckoned to those eager to make their fortunes and a large assortment of Frenchmen and Englishmen began new colonial ventures during the early 17th century, both in North America, which lay basically empty of European settlement north of Mexico, and in the Caribbean, where Spain remained the dominant power until late in the century.

As for the Dutch Netherlands, after decades of rebellion against Spain fueled by both Dutch nationalism and their staunch Protestantism, independence had been gained in all but name (and that too would eventually come with the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648). The Netherlands had become Europe&#x27;s economic powerhouse. With new, innovative ship designs like the fluyt (a cargo vessel able to be operated with a small crew and enter relatively inaccessible ports) rolling out of the ship yards in Amsterdam and Rotterdam, new capitalist economic arrangements like the joint-stock company taking root and the military reprieve provided by the Twelve Year Truce with the Spanish (1609–1621), Dutch commercial interests were expanding explosively across the globe, but particularly in the New World and East Asia. However, in the early 17th century, the most powerful Dutch companies, like the Dutch East India Company, were most interested in developing operations in the East Indies (Indonesia) and Japan, and left the West Indies to smaller, more independent Dutch operators.

=====Spanish ports=====

In the early 17th century, the Spanish colonies of Cartagena, Havana, Panamá Viejo, Porto Bello, Santiago de Cuba, Santo Domingo, and San Juan were among the most important settlements of the Spanish West Indies. Each possessed a large population and a self-sustaining economy, and was well-protected by Spanish defenders. These Spanish settlements were generally unwilling to deal with traders from the other European states because of the strict enforcement of Spain&#x27;s mercantilist laws pursued by the large Spanish garrisons. In these cities European manufactured goods could command premium prices for sale to the colonists, while the trade goods of the New World—tobacco, cocoa and other raw materials, were shipped back to Europe.

By 1600, Porto Bello had replaced Nombre de Dios (where Sir Francis Drake had first attacked a Spanish settlement) as the Isthmus of Panama&#x27;s Caribbean port for the Spanish Silver Train and the annual treasure fleet. Veracruz, the only port city open to trans-Atlantic trade in New Spain, continued to serve the vast interior of New Spain as its window on the Caribbean. By the 17th century, the majority of the towns along the Spanish Main and in Central America had become self-sustaining. The smaller towns of the Main grew tobacco and also welcomed foreign smugglers who avoided the Spanish mercantilist laws. The underpopulated inland regions of Hispaniola and Venezuela were another area where tobacco smugglers in particular were welcome to ply their trade.

The Spanish-ruled island of Trinidad was already a wide-open port open to the ships and seamen of every nation in the region at the start of the 17th century, and was a particular favorite for smugglers who dealt in tobacco and European manufactured goods. Local Caribbean smugglers sold their tobacco or sugar for decent prices and then bought manufactured goods from the trans-Atlantic traders in large quantities to be dispersed among the colonists of the West Indies and the Spanish Main who were eager for a little touch of home. The Spanish governor of Trinidad, who both lacked strong harbor fortifications and possessed only a laughably small garrison of Spanish troops, could do little but take lucrative bribes from English, French and Dutch smugglers and look the other way—or risk being overthrown and replaced by his own people with a more pliable administrator.

=====Other ports=====
The English had established an early colony known as Virginia in 1607 and one on the island of Barbados in the West Indies in 1625, although this small settlement&#x27;s people faced considerable dangers from the local Carib Indians (believed to be cannibals) for some time after its founding. The two early colonies needed regular imports from England, sometimes of food but primarily of woollen textiles. The main early exports back to England included sugar, tobacco, and tropical food. No large tobacco plantations or even truly organized defenses were established by the English on its Caribbean settlements at first and it would take time for England to realize just how valuable its possessions in the Caribbean could prove to be. Eventually, African slaves would be purchased through the Atlantic slave trade. They would work the colonies and fuel Europe&#x27;s tobacco, rice and sugar supply; by 1698 England had the largest slave exports with the most efficiency in their labor in relation to any other European imperial power. Barbados, the first truly successful English colony in the West Indies, grew fast as the 17th century wore on and by 1698 Jamaica would be England&#x27;s biggest colony to employ slave labor. Increasingly, English ships chose to use it as their primary home port in the Caribbean. Like Trinidad, merchants in the trans-Atlantic trade who based themselves on Barbados always paid good money for tobacco and sugar. Both of these commodities remained the key cash crops of this period and fueled the growth of the American Southern Colonies as well as their counterparts in the Caribbean.

After the destruction of Fort Caroline by the Spanish, the French made no further colonization attempts in the Caribbean for several decades as France was convulsed by its own Catholic-Protestant religious divide during the late 16th century Wars of Religion. However, old French privateering anchorages with small &quot;tent camp&quot; towns could be found during the early 17th century in the Bahamas. These settlements provided little more than a place for ships and their crews to take on some fresh water and food and perhaps have a dalliance with the local camp followers, all of which would have been quite expensive.

From 1630 to 1654, Dutch merchants had a port in Brazil known as Recife. It was initially founded by the Portuguese in 1548. The Dutch had decided in 1630 to invade several sugar producing cities in Portuguese-controlled Brazil, including Salvador and Natal. From 1630 to 1654, they took control of Recife and Olinda, making Recife the new capital of the territory of Dutch Brazil, renaming the city Mauritsstad. During this period, Mauritsstad became one of the most cosmopolitan cities of the world. Unlike the Portuguese, the Dutch did not prohibit Judaism. The first Jewish community and the first synagogue in the Americas—Kahal Zur Israel Synagogue—was founded with the help of Moses Cohen Henriques in the city.

The Portuguese inhabitants fought on their own to expel the Dutch in 1654, being helped by the involvement of the Dutch in the First Anglo-Dutch War. The Dutch fought for nine years, only surrendering when safe passage for the Jews was guaranteed by the Portuguese. This was known as the Insurreição Pernambucana (Pernambucan Insurrection). Most of the Jews fled to Amsterdam; others fled to North America, starting the first Jewish community of New Amsterdam (now known as New York City). The Dutch spent most of their time trading in smuggled goods with the smaller Spanish colonies. Trinidad was the unofficial home port for Dutch traders and privateers in the New World early in the 17th century before they established their own colonies in the region in the 1620s and 1630s. As usual, Trinidad&#x27;s ineffective Spanish governor was helpless to stop the Dutch from using his port and instead he usually accepted their lucrative bribes.

====European struggle====
The first third of the 17th century in the Caribbean was defined by the outbreak of the savage and destructive Thirty Years&#x27; War in Europe (1618–1648), which represented both the culmination of the Protestant-Catholic conflict of the Reformation and the final showdown between Habsburg Spain and Bourbon France. The war was mostly fought in Germany, where one-third to one-half of the population would eventually be lost to the strains of the conflict, but it had some effect in the New World as well. The Spanish presence in the Caribbean began to decline at a faster rate, becoming more dependent on African slave labor. The Spanish military presence in the New World also declined as Madrid shifted more of its resources to the Old World in the Habsburgs&#x27; apocalyptic fight with almost every Protestant state in Europe. This need for Spanish resources in Europe accelerated the decay of the Spanish Empire in the Americas. The settlements of the Spanish Main and the Spanish West Indies became financially weaker and were garrisoned with a much smaller number of troops as their home countries were more consumed with happenings back in Europe. The Spanish Empire&#x27;s economy remained stagnant and the Spanish colonies&#x27; plantations, ranches and mines became totally dependent upon slave labor imported from West Africa. With Spain no longer able to maintain its military control effectively over the Caribbean, the other Western European states finally began to move in and set up permanent settlements of their own, ending the Spanish monopoly over the control of the New World.

Even as the Dutch Netherlands was forced to renew its struggle against Spain for independence as part of the Thirty Years&#x27; War (the entire rebellion against the Spanish Habsburgs was called the Eighty Years War in the Low Countries), the Dutch Republic had become the world&#x27;s leader in mercantile shipping and commercial capitalism, and Dutch companies finally turned their attention to the West Indies in the 17th century. The renewed war with Spain with the end of the truce offered many opportunities for the successful Dutch joint-stock companies to finance military expeditions against the Spanish Empire. The old English and French privateering anchorages from the 16th century in the Caribbean now swarmed anew with Dutch warships.

In England, a new round of colonial ventures in the New World was fueled by declining economic opportunities at home and growing religious intolerance for more radical Protestants (like the Puritans) who rejected the compromise Protestant theology of the established Church of England. After the demise of the Saint Lucia and Grenada colonies soon after their establishment, and the near-extinction of the English settlement of Jamestown in Virginia, new and stronger colonies were established by the English in the first half of the 17th century, at Plymouth, Boston, Barbados, the West Indian islands of Saint Kitts and Nevis and Providence Island. These colonies would all persevere to become centers of English civilization in the New World.

For France, now ruled by the Bourbon King Louis XIII (r. 1610–1642) and his able minister Cardinal Richelieu, religious civil war had been reignited between French Catholics and Protestants (called Huguenots). Throughout the 1620s, Huguenots fled France and founded colonies in the New World much like their English counterparts. Then, in 1636, to decrease the power of the Habsburg dynasty who ruled Spain and the Holy Roman Empire on France&#x27;s eastern border, France entered the cataclysm in Germany—on the Protestants&#x27; side. The Franco-Spanish War continued until the 1659 Treaty of the Pyrenees.

=====Colonial disputes=====
Many of the cities on the Spanish Main in the first third of the 17th century were self-sustaining but few had yet achieved any prosperity. The more backward settlements in Jamaica and Hispaniola were primarily places for ships to take on food and fresh water. Spanish Trinidad remained a popular smuggling port where European goods were plentiful and fairly cheap, and good prices were paid by its European merchants for tobacco.

The English colonies on Saint Kitts and Nevis, founded in 1623, would prove to become wealthy sugar-growing settlements in time. Another new English venture, the Providence Island colony on what is now Providencia Island in the Mosquito Coast of Nicaragua, deep in the heart of the Spanish Empire, had become the premier base for English privateers and other pirates raiding the Spanish Main.

On the shared Anglo-French island of Saint Christophe (called &quot;Saint Kitts&quot; by the English) the French had the upper hand. The French settlers on Saint Christophe were mostly Catholics, while the unsanctioned but growing French colonial presence in northwest Hispaniola (the future nation of Haiti) was largely made up of French Protestants who had settled there without Spain&#x27;s permission to escape Catholic persecution back home. France cared little what happened to the troublesome Huguenots, but the colonization of western Hispaniola allowed the French to both rid themselves of their religious minority and strike a blow against Spain—an excellent bargain, from the French Crown&#x27;s point of view. The ambitious Huguenots had also claimed the island of Tortuga off the northwest coast of Hispaniola and had established the settlement of Petit-Goâve on the island itself. Tortuga in particular was to become a pirate and privateer haven and was beloved of smugglers of all nationalities—after all, even the creation of the settlement had been illegal.

Dutch colonies in the Caribbean remained rare until the second third of the 17th century. Along with the traditional privateering anchorages in the Bahamas and Florida, the Dutch West India Company settled a &quot;factory&quot; (commercial town) at New Amsterdam on the North American mainland in 1626 and at Curaçao in 1634, an island positioned right in the center of the Caribbean off the northern coast of Venezuela that was perfectly positioned to become a major maritime crossroads.

===Seventeenth century crisis and colonial repercussions===
The mid-17th century in the Caribbean was again shaped by events in far-off Europe. For the Dutch Netherlands, France, Spain and the Holy Roman Empire, the Thirty Years&#x27; War being fought in Germany, the last great religious war in Europe, had degenerated into an outbreak of famine, plague and starvation that managed to kill off one-third to one-half of the population of Germany. England, having avoided any entanglement in the European mainland&#x27;s wars, had fallen victim to its own ruinous civil war that resulted in the short but brutal Puritan military dictatorship (1649–1660) of the Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell and his Roundhead armies. Of all the European Great Powers, Spain was in the worst shape economically and militarily as the Thirty Years&#x27; War concluded in 1648. Economic conditions had become so poor for the Spanish by the middle of the 17th century that a major rebellion began against the bankrupt and ineffective Habsburg government of King Philip IV (r. 1625–1665) that was eventually put down only with bloody reprisals by the Spanish Crown. This did not make Philip IV more popular.

But disasters in the Old World bred opportunities in the New World. The Spanish Empire&#x27;s colonies were badly neglected from the middle of the 17th century because of Spain&#x27;s many woes. Freebooters and privateers, experienced after decades of European warfare, pillaged and plundered the almost defenseless Spanish settlements with ease and with little interference from the European governments back home who were too worried about their own problems to turn much attention to their New World colonies. The non-Spanish colonies were growing and expanding across the Caribbean, fueled by a great increase in immigration as people fled from the chaos and lack of economic opportunity in Europe. While most of these new immigrants settled into the West Indies&#x27; expanding plantation economy, others took to the life of the buccaneer. Meanwhile, the Dutch, at last independent of Spain when the 1648 Treaty of Westphalia ended their own Eighty Years War (1568–1648) with the Habsburgs, made a fortune carrying the European trade goods needed by these new colonies. Peaceful trading was not as profitable as privateering, but it was a safer business.

By the later half of the 17th century, Barbados had become the unofficial capital of the English West Indies before this position was claimed by Jamaica later in the century. Barbados was a merchant&#x27;s dream port in this period. European goods were freely available, the island&#x27;s sugar crop sold for premium prices, and the island&#x27;s English governor rarely sought to enforce any type of mercantilist regulations. The English colonies at Saint Kitts and Nevis were economically strong and now well-populated as the demand for sugar in Europe increasingly drove their plantation-based economies. The English had also expanded their dominion in the Caribbean and settled several new islands, including Bermuda in 1612, Antigua and Montserrat in 1632, and Eleuthera in the Bahamas in 1648, though these settlements began like all the others as relatively tiny communities that were not economically self-sufficient.

The French also founded major new colonies on the sugar-growing islands of Guadeloupe in 1634 and Martinique in 1635 in the Lesser Antilles. However, the heart of French activity in the Caribbean in the 17th century remained Tortuga, the fortified island haven off the coast of Hispaniola for privateers, buccaneers and outright pirates. The main French colony on the rest of Hispaniola remained the settlement of Petit-Goâve, which was the French toehold that would develop into the modern state of Haiti. French privateers still used the tent city anchorages in the Florida Keys to plunder the Spaniards&#x27; shipping in the Straits of Florida, as well as to raid the shipping that plied the sealanes off the northern coast of Cuba.

For the Dutch in the 17th century, the Caribbean island of Curaçao was the equivalent of England&#x27;s port at Barbados. This large, rich, well-defended free port, open to the ships of all the European states, offered good prices for tobacco, sugar and cocoa that were re-exported to Europe and also sold large quantities of manufactured goods in return to the colonists of every nation in the New World. A second Dutch-controlled free port had also developed on the island of Sint Eustatius which was settled in 1636. The constant back-and-forth warfare between the Dutch and the English for possession of it in the 1660s later damaged the island&#x27;s economy and desirability as a port. The Dutch also had set up a settlement on the island of Saint Martin which became another haven for Dutch sugar planters and their African slave labor. In 1648, the Dutch agreed to divide the prosperous island in half with the French.

===Golden Age of Piracy, 1660–1726===

The late 17th and early 18th centuries (particularly between the years 1706 to 1726) are often considered the &quot;Golden Age of Piracy&quot; in the Caribbean, and pirate ports experienced rapid growth in the areas in and surrounding the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Furthermore, during this time period there were approximately 2400 men that were currently active pirates. The military power of the Spanish Empire in the New World started to decline when King Philip IV of Spain was succeeded by King Charles II (r. 1665–1700), who in 1665 became the last Habsburg king of Spain at the age of four. While Spanish America in the late 17th century had little military protection as Spain entered a phase of decline as a great power, it also suffered less from the Spanish Crown&#x27;s mercantilist policies with its economy. This lack of interference, combined with a surge in output from the silver mines due to increased availability of slave labor (the demand for sugar increased the number of slaves brought to the Caribbean) began a resurgence in the fortunes of Spanish America.

England, France and the Dutch Netherlands had all become New World colonial powerhouses in their own right by 1660. Worried by the Dutch Republic&#x27;s intense commercial success since the signing of the Treaty of Westphalia, England launched a trade war with the Dutch. The English Parliament passed the first of its own mercantilist Navigation Acts (1651) and the Staple Act (1663) that required that English colonial goods be carried only in English ships and legislated limits on trade between the English colonies and foreigners. These laws were aimed at ruining the Dutch merchants whose livelihoods depended on free trade. This trade war would lead to three outright Anglo-Dutch Wars over the course of the next twenty-five years. Meanwhile, King Louis XIV of France (r. 1642–1715) had finally assumed his majority with the death of his regent mother Queen Anne of Austria&#x27;s chief minister, Cardinal Mazarin, in 1661. The &quot;Sun King&#x27;s&quot; aggressive foreign policy was aimed at expanding France&#x27;s eastern border with the Holy Roman Empire and led to constant warfare (Franco-Dutch War and Nine Years&#x27; War) against shifting alliances that included England, the Dutch Republic, the various German states and Spain. In short, Europe was consumed in the final decades of the 17th century by nearly constant dynastic intrigue and warfare—an opportune time for pirates and privateers to engage in their bloody trade.
In the Caribbean, this political environment created many new threats for colonial governors. The sugar island of Sint Eustatius changed ownership ten times between 1664 and 1674 as the English and Dutch dueled for supremacy there. Consumed with the various wars in Europe, the mother countries provided few military reinforcements to their colonies, so the governors of the Caribbean increasingly made use of buccaneers as mercenaries and privateers to protect their territories or carry the fight to their country&#x27;s enemies. Perhaps unsurprisingly, these undisciplined and greedy dogs of war often proved difficult for their sponsors to control.

By the late 17th century, the great Spanish towns of the Caribbean had begun to prosper and Spain also began to make a slow, fitful recovery, but remained poorly defended militarily because of Spain&#x27;s problems and so were sometimes easy prey for pirates and privateers. The English presence continued to expand in the Caribbean as England itself was rising toward great power status in Europe. Captured from Spain in 1655, the island of Jamaica had been taken over by England and its chief settlement of Port Royal had become a new English buccaneer haven in the midst of the Spanish Empire. Jamaica was slowly transformed, along with Saint Kitts, into the heart of the English presence in the Caribbean. At the same time the French Lesser Antilles colonies of Guadeloupe and Martinique remained the main centers of French power in the Caribbean, as well as among the richest French possessions because of their increasingly profitable sugar plantations. The French also maintained privateering strongholds around western Hispaniola, at their traditional pirate port of Tortuga, and their Hispaniolan capital of Petit-Goâve. The French further expanded their settlements on the western half of Hispaniola and founded Léogâne and Port-de-Paix, even as sugar plantations became the primary industry for the French colonies of the Caribbean.

At the start of the 18th century, Europe remained riven by warfare and constant diplomatic intrigue. France was still the dominant power but now had to contend with a new rival, England (Great Britain after 1707) which emerged as a great power at sea and land during the War of the Spanish Succession. But the depredations of the pirates and buccaneers in the Americas in the latter half of the 17th century and of similar mercenaries in Germany during the Thirty Years&#x27; War had taught the rulers and military leaders of Europe that those who fought for profit rather than for King and Country could often ruin the local economy of the region they plundered, in this case the entire Caribbean. At the same time, the constant warfare had led the Great Powers to develop larger standing armies and bigger navies to meet the demands of global colonial warfare. By 1700, the European states had enough troops and ships at their disposal to begin better protecting the important colonies in the West Indies and in the Americas without relying on the aid of privateers. This spelled the doom of privateering and the easy (and nicely legal) life it provided for the buccaneer. Although Spain remained a weak power for the rest of the colonial period, pirates in large numbers generally disappeared after 1730, chased from the seas by a new British Royal Navy squadron based at Port Royal, Jamaica and a smaller group of Spanish privateers sailing from the Spanish Main known as the Costa Garda (Coast Guard in English). With regular military forces now on-station in the West Indies, letters of marque were harder and harder to obtain.

Economically, the late 17th century and the early 18th century was a time of growing wealth and trade for all the nations who controlled territory in the Caribbean. Although some piracy would always remain until the mid-18th century, the path to wealth in the Caribbean in the future lay through peaceful trade, the growing of tobacco, rice and sugar and smuggling to avoid the British Navigation Acts and Spanish mercantilist laws. By the 18th century the Bahamas had become the new colonial frontier for the British. The Republic of Pirates at the port of Nassau became one of the last pirate havens. A small British colony had even sprung up in former Spanish territory at Belize in Honduras that had been founded by an English pirate in 1638. The French colonial empire in the Caribbean had not grown substantially by the start of the 18th century. The sugar islands of Guadaloupe and Martinique remained the twin economic capitals of the French Lesser Antilles, and were now equal in population and prosperity to the largest of the English&#x27;s Caribbean colonies. Tortuga had begun to decline in importance, but France&#x27;s Hispaniolan settlements were becoming major importers of African slaves as French sugar plantations spread across the western coast of that island, forming the nucleus of the modern nation of Haiti.

===End of an era===

The decline of piracy in the Caribbean paralleled the decline of the use of mercenaries and the rise of national armies in Europe. Following the end of the Thirty Years&#x27; War the direct power of the state in Europe expanded. Armies were systematized and brought under direct state control; the Western European states&#x27; navies were expanded and their mission was extended to cover combating piracy. The elimination of piracy from European waters expanded to the Caribbean beginning as early as 1600 with the expansion of standing Royal Naval vessels in the Caribbean, numbering 124 by 1718. Other colonial powers soon followed suit and by the beginning of the nineteenth century, France, Spain, and the United States had all stationed ships in the Caribbean. 

Several European governments passed measures to attempt to combat piracy; in 1717, the Parliament of Great Britain passed the 1717 Transportation Act, which established a regulated, bonded system to transport criminals to Britain&#x27;s colonies in North America as indentured servants as a punishment for those convicted or attainted in England and Wales. Section seven of the act specifically concerned the suppression of piracy, affirming capital punishment for being found guilty for the crime of being a pirate. This act was in line with wider European policies regarding the suppression of piracy.

Despite the increasing crackdowns against Caribbean pirates, piracy in the region saw a brief resurgence between the end of the War of the Spanish Succession in 1713 and around 1720, as many unemployed seafarers took to piracy as a way to make ends meet when a surplus of sailors after the war led to a decline in wages and working conditions. At the same time, one of the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht that ended the war gave to Great Britain&#x27;s South Sea Company a thirty-year asiento, or contract, to furnish African slaves to the Spanish colonies, providing British merchants and smugglers potential inroads into the traditionally closed Spanish markets in America and leading to an economic revival for the whole region. This revived Caribbean trade provided rich new pickings for a new wave of piracy. Also contributing to the increase of Caribbean piracy at this time was Spain&#x27;s breakup of the British logwood settlement at Campeche and the attractions of a freshly sunken Spanish treasure fleet carrying silver off the southern Bahamas in 1715.

This last large resurgence of piracy saw a change in attitude of European colonial powers towards pirates. It had once been seen as a somewhat minor offense, only punishable if suspects and evidence were taken back to Europe for formal proceedings. Now, the British Parliament set the system of courts of Vice-Admiralty, appointing seven commissioners in the colonies to carry out the legal proceedings. These commissioners were chosen from naval and colonial officers who already contained a certain amount of bias towards the local pirates, instead of civilian judges. Pirates were given no representation in the new courts and were, therefore, often sentenced to hang. Between 1716 and 1726 approximately 400 to 600 pirates were executed. Another major attitude change was the policy that if one&#x27;s ship was attacked by pirates, then one must fight back and attempt to resist to the capture of their ship lest they receive six months imprisonment.

With royal attitudes growing so harsh towards the pirates in the Caribbean, many fled to areas of the world where piracy may still be a profitable trade. Black Bart, Bartholomew Roberts, perhaps the most successful pirate that had sailed in the Caribbean, eventually returned to Africa in 1722. Other, less successful pirates from the golden age in the Caribbean attempted to flee North to the Americas. Stede Bonnet, an accomplice of Blackbeard, supposedly began to plunder ships along the Atlantic Coast, but was captured along the South Carolina coast in 1718.

This early 18th century resurgence of piracy lasted only until the presence of European navies and coast guards in the Caribbean were enlarged to deal with the threat. Also crucial to the end of this era of piracy was the loss of the pirates&#x27; last Caribbean safe haven at Nassau. The famous pirates of the early 18th century were a completely illegal remnant of a golden buccaneering age, and their choices were limited to quick retirement or eventual capture. Contrast this with the earlier example of Welshman Henry Morgan, who for his privateering efforts was knighted by the English Crown and appointed the lieutenant-governor of Jamaica.

In the early 19th century, piracy along the East and Gulf Coasts of North America as well as in the Caribbean increased again. Jean Lafitte was a pirate/privateer operating in the Caribbean and in American waters from his havens in Texas and Louisiana during the 1810s. But the records of the US Navy indicate that hundreds of pirate attacks occurred in American and Caribbean waters between the years of 1820 and 1835. The Spanish American Wars of Independence led to widespread use of privateers both by Spain and by the revolutionary governments of Mexico, Colombia, and other newly independent Hispanic American countries. These privateers were rarely scrupulous about adhering to the terms of their letters of marque even during the Wars of Independence, and continued to plague the Caribbean as outright pirates long after those conflicts ended.

About the time of the Mexican–American War in 1846, the United States Navy had grown strong and numerous enough to eliminate the pirate threat in the West Indies. By the 1830s, ships had begun to convert to steam propulsion, so the Age of Sail and the classical idea of pirates in the Caribbean ended. Privateering, similar to piracy, continued as an asset in war for a few more decades and proved to be of some importance during the naval campaigns of the American Civil War.

Privateering would remain a tool of European states, and even of the newborn United States, until the mid-19th century&#x27;s Declaration of Paris. But letters of marque were given out much more sparingly by governments and were terminated as soon as conflicts ended. The idea of &quot;no peace beyond the Line&quot; was a relic that had no meaning by the more settled late 18th and early 19th centuries.

==Rules of piracy==

Aboard a pirate vessel things were fairly democratic and there were &quot;codes of conduct&quot; that reflect modern laws. Some of these rules consisted of a dress code, no women, and some ships had no smoking. The rules, the punishment for breaking them, and even the staying arrangements would be decided among everyone going on the ship before departure, which was a very abstract process compared to the strict rules and procedures onboard European warships and merchantmen. In further contrast to European colonial society in the Americas, on board a pirate vessel racial divisions were usually unknown and in some instances pirates of African descent served as ships&#x27; Captains. Another activity that had to be engaged in before the ship left the dock was swearing an oath to not betray anyone in the entire crew, and to sign what was known as the ship&#x27;s Article, which would determine the percentage of profit each crew member would receive.

Furthermore, some of the ways for deciding disagreements among pirate crew members were fighting till first blood or in more serious cases abandoning an individual on an uninhabited island, whipping them 39 times, or even executing them by firearm. Despite popular belief, however, the punishment of &quot;walking the plank&quot; was never used to settle disputes among pirates. There was, however, a division of power on a pirate crew between the captain, the quartermaster, the governing council for the vessel, and the regular crewmen; but in battle the pirate captain always retained all power and ultimate decision-making authority to ensure an orderly chain of command. When it came time to split the captured wealth into shares, profits were normally given to the person in each rank as follows: Captain (5–6 shares), individuals with a senior position like the quartermaster (2 shares), crewmen (1 share), and individuals in a junior position (1/2 a share).

==Early and Golden Age pirates==

===Jean Fleury===

Born in Vatteville and financed by shipowner Jean Ango, French privateer Jean Fleury was Spain&#x27;s nemesis. In 1522, he captured seven Spanish vessels. One year later most of Montezuma&#x27;s Aztec treasure fell into his hands after he captured two of the three galleons in which Cortez shipped the fabled booty back to Spain. He was captured in 1527 and executed by order of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. He had a very well equipped ship.

===François Le Clerc===

François Le Clerc also nicknamed &quot;Jambe de bois&quot; (&quot;Pie de Palo&quot;, &quot;wooden leg&quot;) was a formidable privateer, ennobled by Henri II in 1551. In 1552, Le Clerc ransacked Porto Santo. One year later, he mustered one thousand men and caused havoc in the Caribbean with his lieutenants Jacques de Sores and Robert Blondel. They pillaged and burned down the seaport of Santo Domingo, and ransacked Las Palmas in the Canary Islands on his way back to France. He led another expedition in 1554 and plundered Santiago de Cuba.

===Blackbeard===

He was born about 1680 in England as Edward Thatch, Teach, or Drummond, and operated off the east coast of North America, particularly pirating in the Bahamas and had a base in North Carolina in the period of 1714–1718. Noted as much for his outlandish appearance as for his piratical success, in combat Blackbeard placed burning slow-match (a type of slow-burning fuse used to set off cannon) under his hat; with his face wreathed in fire and smoke, his victims claimed he resembled a fiendish apparition from Hell. Blackbeard&#x27;s ship was the two-hundred-ton, forty-gun frigate he named .

Blackbeard met his end at the hands of a British Royal Navy squadron specifically sent out to capture him. After an extremely bloody boarding action, the British commanding officer of the squadron, Lieutenant Robert Maynard, killed him with the help of his crew. According to legend, Blackbeard suffered a total of five bullet wounds and twenty slashes with a cutlass before he finally died off the coast of Ocracoke, North Carolina.

===Henry Morgan===

Henry Morgan, a Welshman, was one of the most destructive pirate captains of the 17th century. Although Morgan always considered himself a privateer rather than a pirate, several of his attacks had no real legal justification and are considered piracy. Recently found off the coast of what is now known as the nation of Haiti, was one of Captain Morgan&#x27;s &quot;30-cannon oak ships,&quot; which was thought to have aided the buccaneer in his ventures. Another Caribbean area that was known for the headquarters of Captain Morgan was Port Royal, Jamaica. A bold, ruthless and daring man, Morgan fought England&#x27;s enemies for thirty years, and became a very wealthy man in the course of his adventures. Morgan&#x27;s most famous exploit came in late 1670 when he led 1700 buccaneers up the pestilential Chagres River and then through the Central American jungle to attack and capture the &quot;impregnable&quot; city of Panama. Morgan&#x27;s men burnt the city to the ground, and the inhabitants were either killed or forced to flee. Although the burning of Panama City did not mean any great financial gain for Morgan, it was a deep blow to Spanish power and pride in the Caribbean and Morgan became the hero of the hour in England. At the height of his career, Morgan had been made a titled nobleman by the English Crown and lived on an enormous sugar plantation in Jamaica, as lieutenant governor. Morgan died in his bed, rich and respected—something rarely achieved by pirates in his day or any other.

===Bartholomew Roberts===

Bartholomew Roberts or Black Bart was successful in sinking, or capturing and pillaging some 400 ships. and like most pirate captains of the time he looked fancy doing it. He started his freebooting career in the Gulf of Guinea in February 1719 when Howell Davis&#x27; pirates captured his ship and he proceeded to join them. Rising to captain, he quickly came to the Caribbean and plagued the area until 1722. He commanded a number of large, powerfully armed ships, all of which he named &quot;Fortune&quot;, &quot;Good Fortune&quot;, or &quot;Royal Fortune&quot;. Aboard his vessels the political atmosphere was a form of democracy that depended on participation; in which was a rule that everyone aboard his ship had to vote on issues that arose. Efforts by the governors of Barbados and Martinique to capture him only provoked his anger; when he found the governor of Martinique aboard a newly captured vessel, Roberts hanged the man from a yardarm. Roberts returned to Africa in February 1722, where he met his death in a naval battle, whereby his crew was captured.

===Amaro Pargo===

Amaro Pargo was a privateer who dominated the route between Cádiz and the Caribbean, on several occasions attacking ships belonging to enemies of the Spanish Crown (mainly England and Holland), earning recognition in his time as a hero and coming to be regarded as &quot;the Spanish equivalent of Francis Drake&quot;. Because of his service to the Spanish Crown and country, he was declared a Caballero hidalgo in 1725 and obtained certification of nobility and royal arms in 1727. Amaro Pargo lived for ten years in the Caribbean, specifically on the island of Cuba where he had descendants. He used his loot to finance lucrative trade, becoming wealthy.

===Stede Bonnet===

Probably the least qualified pirate captain ever to sail the Caribbean, Bonnet was a sugar planter who knew nothing about sailing. He started his piracies in 1717 by buying an armed sloop on Barbados and recruiting a pirate crew for wages, possibly to escape from his wife. He lost his command to Blackbeard and sailed with him as his associate. Although Bonnet briefly regained his captaincy, he was captured in 1718 by a privateering vessel that was employed by South Carolina.

===Charles Vane===

Charles Vane, like many early 18th-century pirates, operated out of Nassau in the Bahamas. He was the only pirate captain to resist Woodes Rogers when Rogers asserted his governorship over Nassau in 1718, attacking Rogers&#x27; squadron with a fire ship and shooting his way out of the harbor rather than accept the new governor&#x27;s royal pardon. Vane&#x27;s quartermaster was Calico Jack Rackham, who deposed Vane from the captaincy. Vane started a new pirate crew, but he was captured and hanged in Jamaica in 1721.

===Edward Low===

Edward—or Ned—Low was notorious as one of the most brutal and vicious pirates. Originally from London, he started as a lieutenant to George Lowther, before striking out on his own. His career as a pirate lasted just three years, during which he captured over 100 ships, and he and his crew murdered, tortured and maimed hundreds of people. After his own crew mutinied in 1724 when Low murdered a sleeping subordinate, he was rescued by a French vessel who hanged him on Martinique island.

===Anne Bonny and Mary Read===

Anne Bonny and Mary Read were infamous female pirates of the 18th century; both spent their brief sea-roving careers under the command of Calico Jack Rackham. They are noted chiefly for their sex, highly unusual for pirates, which helped to sensationalize their 1720 November trial in Jamaica. They gained further notoriety for their ruthlessness—they are known to have spoken in favor of murdering witnesses in the crew&#x27;s counsels. The capstone to their legend is that all the crew including Rackham, Anne and Mary were tried in a Spanish town close to Port Royal. Rackham and his crew were hanged, but when the judge sentenced Anne and Mary to death, they plead their bellies, meaning they were pregnant. The judge immediately postponed their death sentence because no English court had the authority to kill an unborn child. Read died in prison around April 1721. There is no record of Anne being executed, nor is she heard from after 1720.

==Privateers==
In the Caribbean the use of privateers was especially popular for what amounted to legal and state-ordered piracy. The cost of maintaining a fleet to defend the colonies was beyond national governments of the 16th and 17th centuries. Private vessels would be commissioned into a de facto &#x27;navy&#x27; with a letter of marque, paid with a substantial share of whatever they could capture from enemy ships and settlements, the rest going to the crown. These ships would operate independently or as a fleet, and if they were successful the rewards could be great—when Jean Fleury and his men captured Cortes&#x27; vessels in 1523, they found an incredible Aztec treasure that they were allowed to keep. Later, when Francis Drake captured the Spanish &quot;Silver Train&quot; at Nombre de Dios (Panama&#x27;s Caribbean port at the time) in 1573 his crews were rich for life. This was repeated by Piet Hein in 1628, who made a profit of 12 million guilders for the Dutch West India Company. This substantial profit made privateering something of a regular line of business; wealthy businessmen or nobles would be quite willing to finance this legitimized piracy in return for a share. The sale of captured goods was a boost to colonial economies as well. The main imperial countries operating at this time and in the region were the French, English, Spanish, Dutch, and Portuguese. Privateers from each country were all ordered to attack the other countries&#x27; vessels, especially Spain which was a shared enemy among the other powers.

By the seventeenth century piracy and privateering became less-acceptable behaviour, especially as many privateers turned into full-blown pirates so they would not have to give part of the profit they made back to their country of employment. Corruption led to the removal of many officials over the years, including Governor Nicholas Trott and Governor Benjamin Fletcher. One way that governments found and discouraged active pirates and corrupt privateers was through the use of &quot;pirate hunters&quot; who were bribed with all or at least most of the wealth that they would find aboard pirate vessels, along with a set bounty. The most renowned pirate hunter was Captain William Kidd, who hit the peak of his legal career in 1695 but later saw the benefits of illegal piracy and made that his new vocation.

The most well-known privateer corsairs of the eighteenth century in the Spanish colonies were Miguel Enríquez of Puerto Rico and José Campuzano-Polanco of Santo Domingo. Miguel Enríquez was a Puerto Rican mulatto who abandoned his work as a shoemaker to work as a privateer. Such was the success of Enríquez, that he became one of the wealthiest men in the New World. Also highlights the Spanish Amaro Pargo also stands out, who frequently traded in the Caribbean while looting ships of the enemy powers of the Spanish Crown. Amaro Pargo lived for ten years in the Caribbean, specifically on the island of Cuba where he had descendants.

==Buccaneers==

Pirates involved specifically in the Caribbean were called buccaneers. Roughly speaking, they arrived in the 1630s and remained until the effective end of piracy in the 1730s. The original buccaneers were settlers that were deprived of their land by &quot;Spanish authorities&quot; and eventually were picked up by white settlers. The word &quot;buccaneer&quot; is actually from the French &quot;boucaner&quot;, meaning &quot;to smoke meat&quot;, from the hunters of wild oxen curing meat over an open fire. They transferred the skills which kept them alive into piracy. They operated with the partial support of the non-Spanish colonies and until the 18th century their activities were legal, or partially legal and there were irregular amnesties from all nations. For the most part buccaneers attacked other vessel and ransacked settlements owned by the Spanish.

Traditionally buccaneers had a number of peculiarities. Their crews operated as a democracy: the captain was elected by the crew and they could vote to replace him. The captain had to be a leader and a fighter—in combat he was expected to be fighting with his men, not directing operations from a distance.

Spoils were evenly divided into shares; when the officers had a greater number of shares, it was because they took greater risks or had special skills. Often the crews would sail without wages—&quot;on account&quot;—and the spoils would be built up over a course of months before being divided. There was a strong &quot;esprit de corps&quot; among pirates. This allowed them to win sea battles: they typically outmanned trade vessels by a large ratio. There was also for some time a social insurance system, guaranteeing money or gold for battle wounds at a worked-out scale.

The romantic notion of pirates burying treasure on isolated islands and wearing gaudy clothes had some basis in fact. Most pirate wealth was accumulated by selling of chandlery items: ropes, sails, and block and tackle stripped from captured ships.

One undemocratic aspect of the buccaneers was that sometimes they would force specialists like carpenters or surgeons to sail with them for some time, though they were released when no longer needed (if they had not volunteered to join by that time). A typical poor man had few other promising career choices at the time apart from joining the pirates. According to reputation, the pirates&#x27; egalitarianism led them to liberate slaves when taking over slave ships. However, there are several accounts of pirates selling slaves captured on slave ships, sometimes after they had helped man the pirates&#x27; own vessels.

In combat they were considered ferocious and were reputed to be experts with flintlock weapons (invented in 1615), but these were so unreliable that they were not in widespread military use before the 1670s.

==Slave pirates==
Many slaves, primarily from places in Africa, were being exported to colonies in the Caribbean for slave labour on plantations. Out of the people that were forced into slavery and shipped off to colonies in the years from 1673 to 1798, approximately 9 to 32 percent were children (this number only considers the exports of British slavers). While on the average 12-week journey to the colonies, the new slaves endured ghastly living conditions that included cramped spaces too small to stand up in, hot temperatures, and poor diets. They were ravaged by disease and death. Many of those taken as slaves were victims or prisoners of civil war. Many aspects of being a slave overall increased the allure of the pirating lifestyle. During the 17th and 18th centuries, piracy was at its height and its symbolic interpretation of freedom was well received. This abstract ideal was very appealing to slaves and victims of imperialism. Even though the main European powers did not want slaves to find out about the freedom that piracy offered, &quot;...30 percent of the 5000 or more pirates who were active between 1715 and 1725 were of African heritage&quot;. Along with the opportunity of a new life and freedom, the indigenous people of Africa were greeted with equality when they joined pirating communities. Many slaves turned pirate &quot;secured&quot; a position of leadership or prestige on pirating vessels, like that of Captain. The pirate Black Caesar, who served onboard the &quot;Queen Anne&#x27;s Revenge&quot; under Blackbeard, was one of the best known slave pirates during the Golden Age of Piracy, being mentioned in the 1724 work &quot;A General History of the Pyrates&quot;.

==Roberto Cofresía 19th-century pirate==

Roberto Cofresí, better known as &quot;El Pirata Cofresí&quot;, became interested in sailing at a young age. By the time he reached adulthood there were some political and economic difficulties in Puerto Rico, which at the time was a colony of Spain. Influenced by this situation he decided to become a pirate in 1818. Cofresí commanded several assaults against cargo vessels focusing on those that were responsible for exporting gold. During this time he focused his attention on boats from the United States and the local Spanish government ignored several of these actions. In early March 1825, Cofresí engaged the USS &quot;Grampus&quot; and a flotilla of ships led by Capt. John D. Sloat in battle. He eventually abandoned his ship and tried to escape by land before being captured. After being imprisoned he was sent to San Juan, Puerto Rico, where a brief military trial found him guilty and on 29 March 1825, he and other members of his crew were executed by a firing squad. After his death his life was used as inspiration for several stories and myths, which served as the basis for books and other media.

==Boysie Singha 20th-century pirate==

Boysie Singh, usually known as &quot;the Raja&quot; (the Hindi word for king), or just &quot;Boysie&quot;, was born on 5 April 1908 on 17 Luis Street, Woodbrook, Port of Spain, Saint George County, Trinidad and Tobago to Bhagrang Singh (a fugitive who immigrated to Trinidad and Tobago from British India) and his wife.

He had a long and successful career as a gangster and gambler before turning to piracy and murder. For almost ten years, from 1947 until 1956 he and his gang terrorized the waters between Trinidad and Tobago and the United States of Venezuela, later on becoming the Fourth Republic of Venezuela. They were responsible for the deaths of approximately 400 people. They would promise to ferry people from Trinidad to Venezuela but en route he would rob his victims at gunpoint, kill them and dump them into the sea.

Boysie was well known to people in Trinidad and Tobago. He had successfully beaten a charge of breaking and entering which nearly resulted in his deportation before he was finally executed after losing his third case—for the murder of his niece. He was held in awe and dread by most of the population and was frequently seen strolling grandly about Port of Spain in the early 1950s wearing bright, stylish clothes. Mothers, nannies, and ajees would warn their children: &quot;Behave yourself, man, or Boysie goyn getchu, allyuh!&quot; Boysie Singh died in Port of Spain by being hanged on 20 August 1957 for the murder of a dancer, presumably his own niece.

== Caribbean piracy in the 21st century ==
Piracy in the Caribbean is still present today, largely confined to small-scale pirating operations in the waters off of Venezuela, Trinidad, Guyana, and Suriname. These pirates are often fishermen who have resorted to piracy due to economic crisis or turf wars between groups of fishers.

Much of the modern-day piracy in the southern Caribbean is a result of the economic upheaval in Venezuela. Venezuelan fishermen, who previously made a living off of catching tuna, shrimp, crab, and octopus, have lost this means of money due to the economic crisis, and are forced to resort to piracy on fishermen off the coasts of Guyana and Trinidad, robbing them and holding them for ransom.

Another major source of modern Caribbean piracy stems from turf wars between rival groups of fishermen from Guyana and Suriname. In April 2018, Guyanese nationals Chris Parsram, Rameshwar Roopnarine, Madre Kishore, David Williams, Ramdeo Persaud, Ray Torres, and Ganesh Beeharry were all arrested in Suriname and sentenced to 35 years in prison, for an attack on 20 Surinamese and Guyanese fishermen in which they were thrown overboard; only four made it to shore, with the rest being thrown into the water and presumed either dead or missing. The attack was believed to be in retaliation for the shooting death of their leader a few weeks prior.

On April 4, 2024, the Panama-flagged &quot;MSC Magalie&quot; was attacked in the Caribbean by two Haitian gangs: 5 Seconds and Taliban. (Unrelated to the Afghan Taliban.) The &quot;Magalie&quot; was captured by the armed gangs in the Varreux fuel terminal at Port-Au-Prince. All aboard were taken hostage, and a sixth of the cargo, consisting entirely of rice (the primary staple food of Haiti), was stolen. On April 7, the Haitian National Police stormed the seized freighter and engaged in a five-hour gun battle with the gangs, in which two police officers were injured and several of the two gang&#x27;s members turned pirate were killed. The ship, owned by U.S. shipping company Claude and Magalie, was recovered by the Haitian police force. The fate of the crew and any other seafarers aboard the &quot;Magalie&quot;, who were all taken hostage, remained unknown.

<doc id="149675" wikidata="Q505981" url="?curid=149675" title="John Hunter (surgeon)">
<text>John Hunter (13 February 1728 – 16 October 1793) was a Scottish surgeon, one of the most distinguished scientists and surgeons of his day. He was an early advocate of careful observation and scientific methods in medicine. He was a teacher of, and collaborator with, Edward Jenner, pioneer of the smallpox vaccine. He paid for the stolen body of Charles Byrne, and proceeded to study and exhibit it against the deceased&#x27;s explicit wishes. His wife, Anne Hunter (), was a poet, some of whose poems were set to music by Joseph Haydn.

He learned anatomy by assisting his elder brother William with dissections in William&#x27;s anatomy school in Central London, starting in 1748, and quickly became an expert in anatomy. He spent some years as an Army surgeon, worked with the dentist James Spence conducting tooth transplants, and in 1764 set up his own anatomy school in London. He built up a collection of living animals whose skeletons and other organs he prepared as anatomical specimens, eventually amassing nearly 14,000 preparations demonstrating the anatomy of humans and other vertebrates, including 3,000+ animals.

Hunter became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1767. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1787. The Hunterian Society of London was named in his honour, and the Hunterian Museum at the Royal College of Surgeons preserves his name and his collection of anatomical specimens. It still contains the illegally procured body of Charles Byrne, despite ongoing protests. It is currently no longer on display, but is still held by the Royal College of Surgeons (2024).

== Early life ==
Hunter was born at Long Calderwood to Agnes Paul (c.1685–1751) and John Hunter (1662/3–1741), the youngest of their ten children. Three of Hunter&#x27;s siblings (one of whom had also been named John) died of illness before he was born. An elder brother was William Hunter, the anatomist. As a youth, he showed little talent, and helped his brother-in-law as a cabinet-maker.

== Education and training ==
When nearly 21 years old, he visited William in London, where his brother had become an admired teacher of anatomy. Hunter started as his assistant in dissections (1748), and was soon running the practical classes on his own. It has recently been alleged that Hunter&#x27;s brother William, and his brother&#x27;s former tutor William Smellie, were responsible for the deaths of many women whose corpses were used for their studies on pregnancy. Hunter is alleged to have been connected to these deaths since at the time he was acting as his brother&#x27;s assistant.

However, persons who have studied life in Georgian London agree that the number of pregnant women who died in London during the years of Hunter&#x27;s and Smellie&#x27;s work was not particularly high for that locality and time; the prevalence of pre-eclampsia – a common condition affecting 10% of all pregnancies, and one which is easily treated today, but for which no treatment was known in Hunter&#x27;s time – would more than suffice to explain a mortality rate that seems suspiciously high to 21st-century readers. In &quot;The Anatomy of the Gravid Uterus Exhibited in Figures&quot;, published in 1774, Hunter provides case histories for at least four of the subjects illustrated.

Hunter heavily researched blood while bloodletting patients with various diseases. This helped him develop his theory that inflammation was a bodily response to disease, and was not itself pathological.

Hunter studied under William Cheselden at Chelsea Hospital and Percival Pott at St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital. Hunter also studied with Marie Marguerite Bihéron, a famous anatomist and wax modeller teaching in London; some of the illustrations in his text were likely hers. After qualifying, he worked at St George&#x27;s Hospital as an assistant surgeon from 1756, then as a surgeon from 1768.

Hunter was commissioned as an Army surgeon in 1760 and was a staff surgeon on an expedition to the French island of Belle Île in 1761, then served in 1762 with the British Army.

== Post-Army career ==
Hunter left the Army in 1763, and spent at least five years working in partnership with James Spence, a well-known London dentist.

Hunter set up his own anatomy school in London in 1764 and started in private surgical practice.

=== Self-experimentation ===

Hunter was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1767. At this time he was considered the leading authority on venereal diseases, and believed that gonorrhoea and syphilis were caused by a single pathogen. Living in an age when physicians frequently experimented on themselves, he was the subject of an often-repeated legend claiming that he had inoculated himself with gonorrhea, using a needle that was unknowingly contaminated with syphilis. When he contracted both syphilis and gonorrhoea, he claimed it proved his erroneous theory that they were the same underlying venereal disease.

The experiment, reported in Hunter&#x27;s &quot;A Treatise on the Venereal Diseases&quot; (part 6 section 2, 1786), does not indicate self-experimentation; this experiment was most likely performed on a third party. Hunter championed the treatment of gonorrhoea and syphilis with mercury and cauterization. Because of Hunter&#x27;s reputation, knowledge concerning the true nature of gonorrhoea and syphilis was set back, and his theory was not proved to be wrong until 51 years later through research by French physician Philippe Ricord.

=== Late career ===

In 1768, Hunter was appointed as surgeon to St George&#x27;s Hospital. Later, he became a member of the Company of Surgeons. In 1776, he was appointed surgeon to King George III.

In 1783, Hunter moved to a large house in Leicester Square. The space allowed him to arrange his collection of nearly 14,000 preparations of over 500 species of plants and animals into a teaching museum. The same year, he acquired the skeleton of the Irish giant Charles Byrne against Byrne&#x27;s clear deathbed wishes—he had asked to be buried at sea.

Hunter bribed a member of the funeral party (possibly for £500) and filled the coffin with rocks at an overnight stop, then subsequently published a scientific description of the anatomy and skeleton. &quot;He is now, after having being stolen on the way to his funeral,&quot; says legal scholar Thomas Muinzer of the University of Stirling, &quot;on display permanently as a sort of freak exhibit in the memorial museum to the person who screwed him over, effectively.&quot; The skeleton was, until 2020, displayed in the Hunterian Museum at the Royal College of Surgeons in London.

In 1786, he was appointed deputy surgeon to the British Army and in March 1790, he was made surgeon general by Prime Minister William Pitt. While in this post, he instituted a reform of the system for appointment and promotion of army surgeons based on experience and merit, rather than the patronage-based system that had been in place.

Hunter&#x27;s death in 1793 was due to a heart attack brought on by an argument at St George&#x27;s Hospital concerning the admission of students. He was originally buried at St Martin-in-the-Fields, but in 1859 was reburied in the north aisle of the nave in Westminster Abbey, reflecting his importance to the country.

Hunter&#x27;s character has been discussed by biographers:
He was described by one of his assistants late in his life as a man &#x27;warm and impatient, readily provoked, and when irritated, not easily soothed&#x27;.

==Family==

In 1771, he married Anne Home, daughter of Robert Boyne Home and sister of Sir Everard Home. They had four children, two of whom died before the age of five. One of his infant children is buried in the churchyard in Kirkheaton, Northumberland, and the gravestone is Grade II listed. Their fourth child, Agnes, married General Sir James Campbell of Inverneill.

==Legacy==

In 1799, the government purchased Hunter&#x27;s collection of papers and specimens, which it presented to the Company of Surgeons.

===Contributions to medicine===
Hunter helped to improve understanding of human teeth, bone growth and remodelling, inflammation, gunshot wounds, venereal diseases, digestion, the functioning of the lacteals, child development, the separateness of maternal and foetal blood supplies, and the role of the lymphatic system. He carried out the first recorded artificial insemination in 1790 on a linen draper&#x27;s wife. The adductor canal in the thigh is also known by its eponym &quot;Hunter&#x27;s canal&quot; after John Hunter.

===Literary references===
Samuel Taylor Coleridge, a key figure in Romantic thought, science, and medicine, saw in Hunter&#x27;s work the seeds of Romantic medicine, namely as regards his principle of life, which he felt had come from the mind of genius.

Hunter was the basis for the character Jack Tearguts in William Blake&#x27;s 1784 unfinished satirical novel, &quot;An Island in the Moon&quot;. He is a principal character in Hilary Mantel&#x27;s 1998 novel, &quot;The Giant, O&#x27;Brien&quot;. Hunter is mentioned by Dr Moreau in Chapter XIV of H. G. Wells&#x27;s &quot;The Island of Doctor Moreau&quot; (1896). He appears in the play &quot;Mr Foote&#x27;s Other Leg&quot; (2015) as a friend of the actor Samuel Foote.

In Imogen Robertson&#x27;s 2009 novel, &quot;Instruments of Darkness&quot;, anatomist Gabriel Crowther advises an acquaintance to seek refuge at his friend Hunter&#x27;s home for the young Earl of Sussex&#x27;s party from deadly pursuers released during the Gordon Riots; leopards in Hunter&#x27;s menagerie killed the would-be assassins, and he envisaged their bodies&#x27; dissection. In Jessie Greengrass&#x27;s novel, &quot;Sight&quot;, she intercuts her story with the biography of Hunter and other scientists who have dedicated their lives to analysing light and transparency.

His Leicester Square house is said to have been the inspiration for the home of Dr Jekyll of Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s 1886 novel &quot;The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde&quot;.

=== Memorials ===
The John Hunter Clinic of the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in London is named after him, as are the John Hunter Hospital in Newcastle, Australia and the Hunterian Neurosurgical Laboratory of the Johns Hopkins Hospital.

His birthplace in Long Calderwood, Scotland, has been preserved as Hunter House Museum.

There had been a bust of Hunter in Leicester Square until the 2010–12 redesign of the square.

<text>The Golden Age of Comic Books describes an era in the history of American comic books from 1938 to 1956. During this time, modern comic books were first published and rapidly increased in popularity. The superhero archetype was created and many well-known characters were introduced, including Superman, Batman, Robin, Captain Marvel, Captain America, and Wonder Woman.

==Etymology==
The first recorded use of the term &quot;Golden Age&quot; was by Richard A. Lupoff in an article, &quot;Re-Birth&quot;, published in issue one of the fanzine &quot;Comic Art&quot; in April 1960.

==History==
An event cited by many as marking the beginning of the Golden Age was the 1938 debut of Superman in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #1, published by Detective Comics (predecessor of DC Comics). Superman&#x27;s popularity helped make comic books a major arm of publishing, which led rival companies to create superheroes of their own to emulate Superman&#x27;s success.

===World War II===

Between 1939 and 1941 Detective Comics and its sister company, All-American Publications, introduced popular superheroes such as Batman and Robin, Wonder Woman, the Flash, Green Lantern, Doctor Fate, the Atom, Hawkman, Green Arrow and Aquaman. Timely Comics, the 1940s predecessor of Marvel Comics, had million-selling titles featuring the Human Torch, the Sub-Mariner, and Captain America. Although DC and Timely characters are well remembered today, circulation figures suggest that the best-selling superhero title of the era was Fawcett Comics&#x27; &quot;Captain Marvel Adventures&quot; with sales of about 1.4 million copies per issue. The comic was published biweekly at one point to capitalize on its popularity. Another notable series was &quot;The Spirit&quot; by Will Eisner, which deviated from the usual publishing model of the period as a weekly multi-page supplement in the Register and Tribune Syndicate newspapers for which Eisner held the copyright, a rare consideration for creators of that period.

Patriotic heroes donning red, white, and blue were particularly popular during the time of the Second World War following the Shield&#x27;s debut in 1940. Many heroes of this time period battled the Axis powers, with covers such as &quot;Captain America Comics&quot; #1 (cover-dated March 1941) showing the title character punching Nazi leader Adolf Hitler.

As comic books grew in popularity, publishers began launching titles that expanded into a variety of genres. Dell Comics&#x27; non-superhero characters (particularly the licensed Walt Disney animated-character comics) outsold the superhero comics of the day. The publisher featured licensed movie and literary characters such as Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Roy Rogers and Tarzan. It was during this era that noted Donald Duck writer-artist Carl Barks rose to prominence. Additionally, MLJ&#x27;s introduction of Archie Andrews in &quot;Pep Comics&quot; #22 (December 1941) gave rise to teen humor comics, with the Archie Andrews character remaining in print well into the 21st century.

At the same time in Canada, American comic books were prohibited importation under the &quot;War Exchange Conservation Act&quot; which restricted the importation of non-essential goods. Canadian publishers responded to this lack of competition by producing titles of their own, informally called the Canadian Whites. While these titles flourished during the war, they did not survive the lifting of trade restrictions afterwards.

===Post-war and shift from superheroes===

The term Atomic Age of Comic Books is sometimes used to describe a brief time period, starting with either the end of World War II in 1945 or in 1948 with the first outcry of Fredric Wertham, and lasting until the mid-1950s. Some authors consider this an interregnum period or an era in its own right, but most regard it as still part of the Golden Age. During this time, the popularity of superhero comics waned. To retain reader interest, comic publishers diversified into other genres, such as war, Westerns, science fiction, romance, crime and horror. Many superhero titles were canceled or converted to other genres.

In 1946, DC Comics&#x27; Superboy, Aquaman and Green Arrow were switched from &quot;More Fun Comics&quot; into &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; so &quot;More Fun&quot; could focus on humor. In 1948 &quot;All-American Comics&quot;, featuring Green Lantern, Johnny Thunder and Dr. Mid-Nite, was replaced with &quot;All-American Western&quot;. The following year, &quot;Flash Comics&quot; and &quot;Green Lantern&quot; were canceled. In 1951 &quot;All Star Comics&quot;, featuring the Justice Society of America, became &quot;All-Star Western&quot;. The next year &quot;Star Spangled Comics&quot;, featuring Robin, was retitled &quot;Star Spangled War Stories&quot;. &quot;Sensation Comics&quot;, featuring Wonder Woman, was canceled in 1953. The only superhero comics published continuously through the entire 1950s were &quot;Action Comics&quot;, &quot;Adventure Comics&quot;, &quot;Batman&quot;, &quot;Detective Comics&quot;, &quot;Superboy&quot;, &quot;Superman&quot;, &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; and &quot;World&#x27;s Finest Comics&quot;.

Plastic Man appeared in Quality Comics&#x27; &quot;Police Comics&quot; until 1950, when its focus switched to detective stories; his solo title continued bimonthly until issue 52, cover-dated February 1955. Timely Comics&#x27; &quot;The Human Torch&quot; was canceled with issue #35 (March 1949) and &quot;Marvel Mystery Comics&quot;, featuring the Human Torch, with issue #93 (Aug. 1949) became the horror comic &quot;Marvel Tales&quot;. &quot;Sub-Mariner Comics&quot; was canceled with issue #42 (June 1949) and &quot;Captain America Comics&quot;, by then &quot;Captain America&#x27;s Weird Tales&quot;, with #75 (Feb. 1950). Harvey Comics&#x27; &quot;Black Cat&quot; was canceled in 1951 and rebooted as a horror comic later that year—the title would change to &quot;Black Cat Mystery&quot;, &quot;Black Cat Mystic&quot;, and eventually &quot;Black Cat Western&quot; for the final two issues, which included Black Cat stories. Lev Gleason Publications&#x27; &quot;Daredevil&quot; was edged out of his title by the Little Wise Guys in 1950. Fawcett Comics&#x27; &quot;Whiz Comics&quot;, &quot;Master Comics&quot; and &quot;Captain Marvel Adventures&quot; were canceled in 1953, and &quot;The Marvel Family&quot; was canceled the following year.

Also during this period, the mass media with the advent of television were forcing media companies to put out comics that reflected the popular culture of the time period. Comic books focused on space, mystery, and suspense that television and other forms of media were turning to in the march toward scientific progress.
According to historian Michael A. Amundson, appealing comic-book characters helped ease young readers&#x27; fear of nuclear war and neutralize anxiety about the questions posed by atomic power. It was during this period that long-running humor comics debuted, including EC Comics&#x27; series &quot;Mad&quot; and Dell&#x27;s series &quot;Uncle Scrooge&quot; (both in 1952).

===End of the era===
In 1953, the comic book industry hit a setback when the United States Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency was created in order to investigate the problem of juvenile delinquency. After the publication of Fredric Wertham&#x27;s &quot;Seduction of the Innocent&quot; the following year that claimed comics sparked illegal behavior among minors, comic book publishers such as EC&#x27;s William Gaines were subpoenaed to testify in public hearings. As a result, the Comics Code Authority was created by the Association of Comics Magazine Publishers to enact self-censorship by comic book publishers. At this time, EC canceled its crime and horror titles and focused primarily on &quot;Mad&quot;. The Silver Age of Comic Books is recognized by some as beginning with the debut of the first successful new superhero since the Golden Age, DC Comics&#x27; new Flash, in &quot;Showcase&quot; #4 (Oct. 1956).

<text>Royal Brunei Airlines [[Private company limited by shares|Sdn Bhd]] (RB) is the flag carrier of Brunei, headquartered in the RB Campus in Bandar Seri Begawan. It is wholly owned by the Government of Brunei. Its hub is Brunei International Airport in Berakas, just to the north of Bandar Seri Begawan, the capital of Brunei.

Formed in 1974, with an initial fleet of two Boeing 737-200 aircraft, serving Singapore, Hong Kong, Kota Kinabalu, and Kuching, Royal Brunei Airlines now operates to 32 destinations in south-east Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and Oceania. Its fleet and type numbers increased progressively in the 1990s.

==History==
===Pre-independence===
Royal Brunei Airlines was established (as merely Royal Brunei) on 18 November 1974 with two, then new Boeing 737-200s. The airline&#x27;s maiden voyage was on 14 May 1975 from the then newly built Brunei International Airport to Singapore. Flights to the then British colony of Hong Kong, and the city of Kota Kinabalu and Kuching in East Malaysia (Malaysian Borneo) started the same day.

Early route expansion included services to Manila in 1976, and Bangkok in 1977. Three years later, Royal Brunei acquired a Boeing 737-200QC, its third Boeing 737, enabling it to reach Kuala Lumpur in 1981 and Darwin in 1983.

===From national independence: 1984–1991===
After the independence of Brunei from the United Kingdom on 1 January 1984, services commenced to Jakarta on 3 January, thus linking all five ASEAN capital cities at the time from Brunei: Bangkok, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, Manila, and Singapore.

Three Boeing 757-200s were purchased in the mid-1980s, to enable the airline to expand to Taipei in 1986 and Dubai in 1988. They were also used on existing high-capacity routes to Singapore, Hong Kong, Bangkok, Jakarta, and Kuala Lumpur; after the introduction of the 757, its smaller sibling was phased out. In June 1990, Royal Brunei Airlines achieved a historic milestone with a non-stop long-distance flight from Seattle to Mombasa/Nairobi, using Brunei&#x27;s first twin-engined commercial jet. The 18-hour flight covered 14,856.19 kilometres (7,842 nautical miles) and consumed 74.2 tons of fuel. This achievement, led by local pilot Captain Khalidkhan bin Haji Asmakhan, was a test of the airline&#x27;s new aircraft for long-haul suitability. Recognised in &quot;The Guinness Book of Records&quot; in 1992, the accomplishment brought international recognition to Brunei.

===Rapid expansion: 1992–1996===
With the airline&#x27;s rapid expansion, the 737s were sold, replaced by the Boeing 767. Before that, 757-200s served the airline between Brunei, the Middle East, and Gatwick.

The delivery of the first Boeing 767 (after a leased 767-200 registered CC-CEX) broke a world record when it flew 17 hours and 22 minutes non-stop from Boeing&#x27;s factory in Seattle to Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, Nairobi, on its way to Brunei. Seven more 767s were delivered, taking the fleet to eight Boeing 767s and two Boeing 757s (one of the 757s was sold to fund the purchase of the new 767s).

In March 1993, Abu Dhabi was added to the route network, through which flights to Frankfurt and Jeddah, were re-routed instead of Dubai. Bali was the second Indonesian city to be added to the network in May of the year. Flights to the third European destination, Zürich, commenced in August 1993 via Kuala Lumpur and another new destination, Bahrain. Before the end of the year, the airline was inaugurating services to Beijing (October) and Cairo (November), via Kuala Lumpur and Bahrain, respectively. Royal Brunei Airlines sold its last Boeing 737 to Aloha Airlines.

The growth of the network continued in 1994. The delivery of two Fokker 50s was used to start services to Miri and Labuan in east Malaysia of the same year. Flights to Brisbane and Osaka were also commenced in June and December, respectively; (the Brisbane service was initially routed via Darwin but later upgraded to a non-stop flight). The desire to link all the major oil and gas cities on Borneo saw the addition of Balikpapan to the route network in December.

Also in 1994, services began to Kolkata via Singapore and then on towards Dubai. Two Dornier 228s were purchased in the same year, and leased to the Malaysian regional carrier, Hornbill Skyways, to connect Brunei by air to Mulu Airport. Services to Cairo and Kolkata (via Singapore) were suspended in mid-1995 due to low passenger numbers.

The F-50s were replaced by the larger and more comfortable Fokker 100 (used, from previous owner Swissair) in 1996, which fuelled expansion to Bintulu. The route to Zürich was suspended in September 1996, to enable Royal Brunei to commence daily services to London Heathrow. Some London flights were routed through Yangon and Abu Dhabi, instead of via Singapore and Dubai; however, Yangon proved uneconomical and was discontinued the following year.

===Consolidation: 1997–2002===
On 6 September 1997, Royal Brunei Airlines Flight 839, a Dornier 228 owned by Royal Brunei Airlines, but operated and maintained by Malaysian regional carrier Hornbill Airways, carrying 10 passengers to Miri, crashed into high ground near Miri airport. All eight passengers and two crew died. The remaining Dornier 228s were sold in 1997, and short-haul services connecting Brunei to Miri, Labuan, Mulu, and Bintulu were terminated.

Later that year, Surabaya was the fourth Indonesian destination to be added. Unprofitable routes to Beijing and Osaka were suspended in 1998, and the F-100s were also sold to Alpi Eagles Airlines in 1998. Kuwait was added to the network in 2000, and was served via Singapore, Kolkata, and Dubai. It was suspended a year later. Services also began to Shanghai Pudong International Airport in 2001. Royal Brunei started online booking facilities the same year.

===Restructuring: 2003–2005===
In September 2002, Peter Foster was appointed as chief executive officer (CEO). He began major restructuring in 2003, after years of unprofitable operation. The plan was for Royal Brunei&#x27;s fleet to grow from nine to twenty-four aircraft in a ten-year period, from 2003 to 2013. The fleet of six Boeing 767s would be changed to fifteen new narrow-body aircraft and eight wide-body aircraft; half of the new aircraft to be leased, and the others to be purchased. The plan also included new services to Auckland, Ho Chi Minh City, Sydney, Seoul, and Tokyo, as well as raising frequencies on other flights.

The deliveries of the new Airbus A319 and A320 in 2002 and 2003, respectively, marked the start of the re-equipping exercise. Two new V2500-powered A319s were delivered on 28 August and 3 September. A320s were added on 21 December 2003 and 3 January 2005. All of the Airbus were leased from CIT Group in a seven-year contract, and are deployed mainly on regional routes. With their introduction, the Boeing 757s were phased out and sold to other parties.

On 31 October 2003, a Royal Brunei Airlines aircraft touched down at Auckland Airport, making it the first destination in New Zealand, and the first new destination added to the network as part of the restructuring exercise. On May the launching of &quot;Royal Skies&quot;, the airline&#x27;s frequent-flyer program.

At the end of 2003, Royal Brunei Airlines entered a controversial agreement with Royal Tongan Airlines of Tonga. Under the agreement, Royal Tongan Airlines wet-leased is one of the two remaining Boeing 757s. In return, Royal Brunei Airlines was given the opportunity to open up US markets via Tonga. However, before US routes could be planned Royal Tongan Airlines went into bankruptcy with huge debts in mid-2004, after less than six months of operation. As Royal Tongan Airlines was unable to pay the lease fees, the 757 was repossessed and stored.

Starting in March 2004, four of Royal Brunei Airline&#x27;s Boeing 767s were modified by the introduction of SkyDreamer seats in Business Class, to replace the old First Class and Business Class Skyluxe seats. Business Class was renamed as Sky Executive Class, and in Economy class, each seat was installed with an 8.4 inch television. Sky Executive Class was subsequently renamed Business Class following poor response from the public.

The unprofitable Taipei route was suspended in late 2004. Kuching and Kolkata were dropped on 31 October 2004 due to rising fuel prices, but at the same time, Sydney was added to the route network. Commencing 17 December, flights to Jeddah were routed through Sharjah instead of Abu Dhabi. During the year, the airline launched &quot;Blue Sky Fares&quot;, a low-cost internet booking facility, offering cheaper economy class fares on selected destinations, to compete with low-cost carriers in the region, such as AirAsia. In August 2005, Peter Foster resigned as CEO to take up a similar post at another airline.

===Growth: 2006–2011===
Royal Brunei Airlines added Ho Chi Minh City to its network list in May 2006, a destination served thrice weekly.

Brunei Darussalam and the United Kingdom (UK) agreed to allow more air services between the countries on 23 November 2007, enhancing the two countries&#x27; cooperation in the aviation sector. The agreement came into action with immediate effect. This came off the back of the latest tourism figures of 3,459 European holiday visitor arrivals from January to August 2007. The UK is considered an important gateway for European tourists coming to Brunei; Royal Brunei Airlines operates daily flights between Brunei and London, England.

In early September 2007, Royal Brunei Airlines suspended flights to Frankfurt am Main as part of its latest restructuring exercise. Kuching was reintroduced to the network on 1 December 2007, after a break of three years. Royal Brunei Airlines then suspended services to Darwin on 26 January 2008, after serving the route for 24 years. Sharjah was also dropped from the network early 2008, as Jeddah flights are served non-stop from Bandar Seri Begawan. Shanghai was &#x27;suspended&#x27; in April 2008, and Sydney and Bali were dropped from the summer schedule of 2008.

On 2 June 2008, Royal Brunei Airlines increased services to Auckland from Bandar Seri Begawan by offering a new three-weekly direct service. This direct service was in addition to an increase in the frequency of the existing route via Brisbane from three to four times a week. The following year, Robert Yang was appointed as chief executive officer effective from 1 July, after the departure of Ray Sayer.

From 28 March 2010, the service to Shanghai resumed with a frequency of four times per week. Auckland was delinked from Brisbane, making Auckland five times per week, and Brisbane six times per week. From 17 June 2010, Royal Brunei Airlines introduced ex-Singapore Airlines Boeing 777-200ER aircraft to replace the Boeing 767 fleet being returned to their lessors; the inaugural Boeing 777 service was the Bandar Seri Begawan to London Heathrow service via Dubai, on 17 June. The last of the airline&#x27;s long-serving Boeing 767s were withdrawn from service on 27 September. Plans were also announced during the year for a four times a week Brunei to Melbourne service with the Boeing 777-200ER, starting from 29 March 2011.

On 12 February 2011, Brudirect.com reported that Robert Yang had announced his resignation as the CEO of Royal Brunei Airlines, with effect from 1 March 2011.

===Stabilisation plan: 2012–present===
On 21 June 2012, Royal Brunei Airlines announced that the company was implementing a plan to improve its operations, financial &#x27;performance&#x27;, and customer service experience, ground operations for all airports. As part of the plan, services to Auckland, Brisbane, Perth, and Ho Chi Minh City were suspended effective after the last scheduled flights of October 2012. Flights to Kuching were suspended after the last scheduled flight of July 2012. The airline leased two additional Airbus A320s in 2013, together with five Boeing 787s, to strengthen and revitalise its regional network, and international routes respectively. The first of the five Boeing 787s, with registration number V8-DLA, was delivered on 4 October 2013. All of its Boeing 787 aircraft are powered by the Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engines. On 18 October 2013, the Bandar Seri Begawan to Singapore service was used as the 787&#x27;s inaugural flight. Flights to London Heathrow via Dubai using the 787s started on 2 December 2013.

On 6 November 2013, Royal Brunei Airlines outlined plans to offer a &#x27;100% Dreamliner service&#x27; on all of its long-haul routes. The airline at that time considered southern India for its next airline expansion. RB, which operated four Airbus A320s and two Airbus A319s as of November 2013, also planned to expand its short-haul aircraft fleet to &#x27;double digits&#x27;. The airline looked at plans to purchase current-generation Boeing 737s or Airbus A320s. These short-haul aircraft might also be used on flights to Australia, as part of its future expansion plan. RB resumed flights to Bali four times a week, starting July 2014. Effective 17 October 2014, RB resumed flights to Ho Chi Minh City four times a week, as it looked to use the destination to connect with key regional and international markets.

The airline leased two new Airbus A320 aircraft which were delivered in September and November 2015, eventually to replace the two Airbus A319 aircraft. This indicated the start of the programme to modernise the narrow-body fleet, with up to ten Airbus A320s to be delivered from the end of 2017. RB&#x27;s first A320-neo was delivered on the 28 May 2018.

The CEO from 2011 to March 2016 was Dermot Mannion. In March 2016, Dermot Mannion finished his five-year term and was replaced by Karam Chand. On 6 January 2021, Captain Haji Khalidkhan Haji Asmakhan was appointed as the Chief Executive Officer for Royal Brunei Airlines and retired the position on 10 October 2021. On 1 November 2022, Captain Sabirin Hj Abd Hamid was appointed as the current Chief Executive Officer for Royal Brunei Airlines. Prior to the appointment he was the Acting CEO for 13 months and the Chief Operation Officer since 6 January 2021. 

== Awards and accolades ==
In 2023, RB was awarded a Five Star rating for the Major Airline category by the Airline Passenger Experience Association (APEX). In the same year, RB was awarded World&#x27;s Leading Cabin Crew for the fourth consecutive year by WTA. On 30 May 2024, RB received Muslim-Friendly Airline of The Year from Crescent Rating for Halal in Travel Awards.

===Special liveries===
* Royal Brunei Airlines&#x27; first special livery was revealed around July–August 1999, in conjunction with the 20th Southeast Asian Games, hosted in Brunei. The livery was installed on one of RBA&#x27;s Boeing 767-300ER (registration V8-RBK).

* One of Royal Brunei Airlines&#x27; Boeing 787-8 (registration V8-DLD) has a special 40th anniversary sticker behind the rear doors on both sides of the aircraft. This sticker was added to the body of the aircraft in late 2014 to mark 40 years of operations.

* In October 2017, on their official Instagram account, it was revealed that one of their Airbus A320 (registration V8-RBX) has a special 50th Golden Jubilee livery for His Majesty the 29th Sultan of Brunei&#x27;s accession to the throne.
* One of Royal Brunei Airlines&#x27; Airbus A320neo (registration V8-RBD) has a new special livery related to Brunei tourism, which was revealed in an official launch event for the aircraft&#x27;s new fleet in September 2018.

==Services==

===Airport lounge===
&quot;SkyLounge&quot; is Royal Brunei Airlines&#x27; lounge at the Brunei International Airport, which was opened in January 2004, and occupies the entire mezzanine floor at the departure hall (airside) of the airport. The lounge is exclusively reserved for Royal Brunei&#x27;s business and economy class passengers (with Priority Pass), and Royal Skies Gold and Silver members. The lounge may also be used by qualifying members of other airlines, with an agreement with Royal Brunei Airlines to use the lounge, such as Singapore Airlines.

===In-flight service===
Royal Brunei does not serve alcoholic beverages on board its flights. Non-Muslim passengers are however, permitted to bring along their own alcohol for consumption on board. This reflects the Bruneian government&#x27;s policy on the sale and importation of alcohol in Brunei. All inflight meals served are halal.

===Cabins===
The Boeing 787-8 Business Class seats can be made into a fully flat bed. Each seat is also offered with a , duo function in-seat personal television (touch screen and remote-controlled capability), along with an in-seat power outlet. The Economy Class seats can be reclined from the upright position. At each seat is a , touch screen in-seat personal television with USB charging capability, along with an in-seat power outlet.

The two new Airbus A320s, V8-RBW and V8-RBX, have three rows of seats with extra legroom compared to ordinary economy class seats. The seats are situated immediately behind the business class seats. The area can be separated from the rest of the ordinary economy class seats and the business class seats with curtains. On flights to and from Brunei, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, and Hong Kong, it is possible to pay in advance to sit in these seats via the &#x27;Manage my booking&#x27; section of the airline&#x27;s website. As well as extra legroom, meals are served first, and there is priority boarding. This cabin is exactly the same as Royal Brunei&#x27;s Airbus A320neo, but with a personal, touch screen IFE (in-flight entertainment) system with a USB charging capability, along with an in-seat power outlet in each seat.

===Loyalty programme===
&quot;Royal Skies&quot; is the loyalty programme of Royal Brunei Airlines, consisting of three tiers. Launched in May 2003, members will earn actual miles on every eligible Royal Brunei Airlines&#x27; flight, or by utilising the products and / or services of Royal Skies partners.

The Blue card does not carry any expiry date, however, Silver and Gold cards will have an expiry date that shows the end of the benefits period. Silver and Gold members must re-qualify for the Elite tier to continue receiving Elite Status benefits. With the expiration of Elite status benefits, the member will use their Blue card to start earning tier-qualifying miles again. Miles expire after three years.

Miles accrued by Royal Skies members can be redeemed for free flights or seat upgrades. A free upgrade award starts from 5,000 Royal Skies miles, while redemption for a free flight starts from 15,000 miles.

<doc id="149679" wikidata="Q852565" url="?curid=149679" title="Shame (Rushdie novel)">
<text>Shame is Salman Rushdie&#x27;s third novel, published in 1983. This book was written out of a desire to approach the problem of &quot;artificial&quot; (other-made) country divisions, their residents&#x27; complicity, and the problems of post-colonialism when Pakistan was created to separate the Muslims from the Hindus after Britain gave up control of India.

The book is written in the style of magic realism. It portrays the lives of Iskander Harappa (sometimes assumed to be Zulfikar Ali Bhutto), and 
General Raza Hyder (sometimes assumed to be General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq), and their relationship. The central theme of the novel is that begetting &quot;shame&quot; begets violence. The concepts of &#x27;shame&#x27; and &#x27;shamelessness&#x27; are explored through all of the characters, with the main focus being on Sufiya Zinobia and Omar Khayyám.

<text>Beck David Hansen (born Bek David Campbell; July 8, 1970), known mononymously as Beck, is an American musician, singer, songwriter, and record producer. He rose to fame in the early 1990s with his experimental and lo-fi style, and became known for creating musical collages of wide-ranging genres. He has musically encompassed folk, funk, soul, hip hop, electronica, alternative rock, country, and psychedelia. He has released 14 studio albums (three of which were released on indie labels), as well as several non-album singles and a book of sheet music.

Born and raised in Los Angeles, Beck gravitated towards hip hop and folk in his teens and began to perform locally at coffeehouses and clubs. He moved to New York City in 1989 and became involved in the city&#x27;s anti-folk movement. Returning to Los Angeles in the early 1990s, he saw his commercial breakthrough with his 1993 single &quot;Loser.&quot; After signing with DGC Records, the song peaked at number ten on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and served as lead single for his third album and major label debut, &quot;Mellow Gold&quot; (1994). Its follow-up, &quot;Odelay&quot; (1996), topped critic polls and won several awards. He released the country-influenced, twangy &quot;Mutations&quot; in 1998, and the funk-infused &quot;Midnite Vultures&quot; in 1999. The soft-acoustic &quot;Sea Change&quot; in 2002 showcased a more serious Beck, and 2005&#x27;s &quot;Guero&quot; returned to &quot;Odelay&quot;″s sample-based production. &quot;The Information&quot; in 2006 was inspired by electro-funk, hip hop, and psychedelia; 2008&#x27;s &quot;Modern Guilt&quot; was inspired by 1960s pop; and 2014&#x27;s folk-infused &quot;Morning Phase&quot; won Album of the Year at the 57th Grammy Awards. His 2017 album, &quot;Colors&quot;, won awards for Best Alternative Album and Best Engineered Album at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards. His fourteenth studio album, &quot;Hyperspace&quot;, was released on November 22, 2019. In 2022, Beck was nominated for the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame.

With a pop art collage of musical styles, oblique and ironic lyrics, and postmodern arrangements incorporating samples, drum machines, live instrumentation and sound effects, Beck has been hailed by critics and the public throughout his musical career as being among the most idiosyncratically creative musicians of 1990s and 2000s alternative rock. Two of Beck&#x27;s most popular and acclaimed recordings are &quot;Odelay&quot; and &quot;Sea Change&quot;, both of which were ranked on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. Beck is a four-time platinum artist; he has collaborated with several artists and has made several contributions to soundtracks.

==Early life==
Bek David Campbell was born in Los Angeles on July 8, 1970, the son of American visual artist Bibbe Hansen and Canadian arranger, composer, and conductor David Campbell. Bibbe Hansen grew up amid Andy Warhol&#x27;s The Factory art scene of the 1960s in New York City and was a Warhol superstar. She moved to California at 17 and met David Campbell. Beck&#x27;s maternal grandfather, artist Al Hansen, was of Norwegian descent and was a pioneer in the avant-garde Fluxus movement. Beck&#x27;s maternal grandmother was Jewish; he has said that he considers himself Jewish because he was &quot;raised celebrating Jewish holidays.&quot;

Beck was born in a rooming house near downtown Los Angeles. As a child he lived in a declining neighborhood near Hollywood Boulevard. He remembers &quot;By the time we left there, they were ripping out miles of houses en masse and building low-rent, giant apartment blocks.&quot; The working-class family struggled financially, moving to Hoover and Ninth Street, a neighborhood populated primarily by Koreans and Salvadorian refugees. He was sent for a time to live with his paternal grandparents in Kansas; he later remarked that he thought &quot;they were kind of concerned&quot; about his &quot;weird&quot; home life. Because his paternal grandfather was a Presbyterian minister, Beck grew up influenced by church music and hymns. He also spent time in Europe with his maternal grandfather.

After his parents separated when he was 10, Beck stayed with his mother and brother Channing in Los Angeles, where he was influenced by the city&#x27;s diverse musical offerings—everything from hip hop to Latin music and his mother&#x27;s art scene—all of which would later reappear in his work. Beck obtained his first guitar at 16 and became a street musician, often playing Lead Belly covers at Lafayette Park. During his teens, Beck discovered the music of Sonic Youth, Pussy Galore, and X, but remained uninterested in most music outside the folk genre until many years into his career. The first contemporary music that made a direct connection with Beck was hip hop, which he first heard on Grandmaster Flash records in the early 1980s. Growing up in a predominantly Latin district, he found himself the only white child at his school, and quickly learned how to breakdance. When he was 17, Beck grew fascinated after hearing a Mississippi John Hurt record at a friend&#x27;s house, and spent hours in his room trying to emulate Hurt&#x27;s finger-picking techniques. Shortly thereafter Beck explored blues and folk music further, discovering Woody Guthrie and Blind Willie Johnson.

Feeling like &quot;a total outcast&quot;, Beck dropped out of school after junior high. He later said that although he felt school was important, he felt unsafe there. When he applied to the new performing arts high school downtown, he was rejected. His brother took him to post-Beat jazz places in Echo Park and Silver Lake. He hung out at Los Angeles City College perusing records, books, and old sheet music in the college&#x27;s library. He used a fake ID to sit in on classes there, and he also befriended a literature instructor and his poet wife. He worked at a string of menial jobs, including loading trucks and operating a leaf blower.

==Career==
===Early performances and first releases (1988–1993)===
Beck began as a folk musician, switching between country blues, Delta blues, and more traditional rural folk music in his teenage years. He began performing on city buses, often covering Mississippi John Hurt alongside original, sometimes improvisational compositions. &quot;I&#x27;d get on the bus and start playing Mississippi John Hurt with totally improvised lyrics. Some drunk would start yelling at me, calling me Axl Rose. So I&#x27;d start singing about Axl Rose and the levee and bus passes and strychnine, mixing the whole thing up&quot;, he later recalled. He was also in a band called Youthless that hosted Dadaist-inspired freeform events at city coffee shops. &quot;We had Radio Shack mics and this homemade speaker and we&#x27;d draft people in the audience to recite comic books or do a beatbox thing, or we&#x27;d tie the whole audience up in masking tape,&quot; Beck recalled.

In 1989, Beck caught a bus to New York City with little more than $8.00 and a guitar. He spent the summer attempting to find a job and a place to live with little success. Beck eventually began to frequent Manhattan&#x27;s Lower East Side and stumbled upon the tail end of the East Village&#x27;s anti-folk scene&#x27;s first wave. Beck became involved in a loose posse of acoustic musicians—including Cindy Lee Berryhill, Kirk Kelly, Paleface, and Lach headed by Roger Manning—whose raggedness and eccentricity placed them well outside the acoustic mainstream. &quot;The whole mission was to destroy all the clichés and make up some new ones,&quot; said Beck of his New York years. &quot;Everybody knew each other. You could go up onstage and say anything, and you wouldn&#x27;t feel weird or feel any pressure.&quot; Inspired by that freedom and by the local spoken-word performers, Beck began to write free-associative, surrealistic songs about pizza, MTV, and working at McDonald&#x27;s, turning mundane thoughts into songs. Beck was roommates with Paleface, sleeping on his couch and attending open mic nights together. Daunted by the prospect of another homeless New York winter, Beck returned to his home of Los Angeles in early 1991. &quot;I was tired of being cold, tired of getting beat up,&quot; he later remarked. &quot;It was hard to be in New York with no money, no place ... I kinda used up all the friends I had. Everyone on the scene got sick of me.&quot;

Back in Los Angeles, Beck began to work at a video store in the Silver Lake neighborhood, &quot;doing things like alphabetizing the pornography section&quot;. He began performing in arthouse clubs and coffeehouses such as Al&#x27;s Bar and Raji&#x27;s. In order to keep indifferent audiences engaged in his music, Beck would play in a spontaneous, joking manner. &quot;I&#x27;d be banging away on a Son House tune and the whole audience would be talking. So maybe out of desperation or boredom, or the audience&#x27;s boredom, I&#x27;d make up these ridiculous songs just to see if people were listening,&quot; he later remarked. Virtually an unknown to the public and an enigma to those who met him, Beck would hop onstage between acts in local clubs and play &quot;strange folk songs&quot;, accompanied by &quot;what could best be described as performance art&quot; while sometimes wearing a &quot;Star Wars&quot; stormtrooper mask. Beck met someone who offered to help record demos in his living room, and he began to pass cassette tapes around.

Eventually, Beck gained key boosters in Margaret Mittleman, the West Coast&#x27;s director of talent acquisitions for BMG Music Publishing, and the partners behind independent record label Bong Load Custom Records: Tom Rothrock, Rob Schnapf, and Brad Lambert. Schnapf saw Beck perform at Jabberjaw and felt he would suit their small venture. Beck expressed a loose interest in hip hop and Rothrock introduced him to Carl Stephenson, a record producer for Rap-A-Lot Records. In 1992, Beck visited Stephenson&#x27;s home to collaborate with him. The result—the slide-sampling hip hop track &quot;Loser&quot;—was a one-off experiment that Beck set aside, going back to his folk songs, making his home tapes such as &quot;Golden Feelings&quot;, and releasing several independent singles.

===&quot;Mellow Gold&quot;, and independent albums (1993–1994)===
By 1993, Beck was living in a rat-infested shed near a Los Angeles alleyway with little money. Bong Load issued &quot;Loser&quot; as a single in March 1993 on 12&quot; vinyl with only 500 copies pressed. Beck felt that &quot;Loser&quot; was mediocre, and only agreed to its release at Rothrock&#x27;s insistence. &quot;Loser&quot; unexpectedly received radio airplay, starting in Los Angeles, where college radio station KXLU was the first to play it, and later on Santa Monica College radio station KCRW, where radio host Chris Douridas played the song on &quot;Morning Becomes Eclectic&quot;, the station&#x27;s flagship music program. &quot;I called the record label that day and asked to have Beck play live on the air&quot;, Douridas said. &quot;He came in that Friday, rapped to a tape of &#x27;Loser&#x27; and did his song &#x27;MTV Makes Me Want to Smoke Crack. That night, Beck performed at the Los Angeles club Cafe Troy to a packed audience and talent scouts from major labels. The song then spread to Seattle through KNDD The End, and KROQ-FM began playing the song on an almost hourly basis. As Bong Load struggled to press more copies of &quot;Loser&quot;, Beck was beset with offers to sign with major labels. During the bidding war in November, Beck spent several days in Olympia, Washington, recording material with Calvin Johnson of Beat Happening, which would later see release the following year on Johnson&#x27;s K Records as &quot;One Foot in the Grave&quot;.

A fierce bidding war ensued, with Geffen Records A&amp;R director Mark Kates signing Beck in December 1993 amid intense competition from Warner Bros. and Capitol. Beck&#x27;s non-exclusive contract with Geffen allowed him an unusual amount of creative freedom, with Beck remaining free to release material through such small, independent labels as Flipside, which issued the sprawling, 25-track collection of pre-&quot;Loser&quot; recordings titled &quot;Stereopathetic Soulmanure&quot; on February 22 the following year. By the time Beck released his first album for Geffen, the low-budget, genre-blending &quot;Mellow Gold&quot; on March 1, &quot;Loser&quot; was already in the top 40 and its video in MTV&#x27;s Buzz Bin. &quot;Loser&quot; quickly ascended the charts in the U.S., reaching a peak of number ten on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart and topping the Modern Rock Tracks chart. The song also charted in the UK, Australia, New Zealand, and throughout Europe. Beck&#x27;s newfound position of attention led to his characterization as the &quot;King of Slackers&quot;, as the media dubbed him the center of the new so-called &quot;slacker&quot; movement. Critics, feeling it the essential follow-up to Radiohead&#x27;s &quot;Creep&quot;, found vacantness in the lyrics of &quot;Loser&quot; strongly associated with Generation X, although Beck himself strongly contested his position as the face of the &quot;slacker&quot; generation: &quot;Slacker my &quot;ass&quot;. I mean, I &quot;never&quot; had any slack. I was working a $4-an-hour job trying to stay alive. That slacker stuff is for people who have the time to be depressed about everything.&quot;

===Backlash and &quot;Odelay&quot; (1994–1997)===
Feeling as though he was &quot;constantly trying to prove myself&quot;, Beck suffered a backlash, with skeptics denouncing him as a self-indulgent fake and the latest marketing opportunity. In the summer of 1994, Beck was struggling and many of his fellow musicians thought he had lost his way. Combined with Loser&#x27;s wildly popular music video and the world tour, Beck reacted believing the attention could not last, resulting in a status as a &quot;one-hit wonder&quot;. At other concerts, crowds were treated to twenty minutes of reggae or Miles Davis or jazz-punk iterations of &quot;Loser&quot;. At one-day festivals in California, he surrounded himself with an artnoise combo. The drummer set fire to his cymbals; the lead guitarist &quot;played&quot; his guitar with the strings faced towards his body; and Beck changed the words to &quot;Loser&quot; so that nobody could sing along. &quot;I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I was looking at faces that were looking back at me with complete bewilderment—or just pointing and shaking their heads and laughing—while performing during that period,&quot; he later recalled. Despite this, Beck gained the respect of his peers, such as Tom Petty and Johnny Cash, and created an entire wave of bands determined to recapture the &quot;Mellow Gold&quot; sound. Feeling his previous releases were just collections of demos recorded over the course of several years, Beck desired to enter the studio and record an album in a continuous linear fashion, which became &quot;Odelay&quot;.

Beck blends country, blues, rap, jazz and rock on &quot;Odelay&quot;, the result of a year and half of feverish &quot;cutting, pasting, layering, dubbing, and, of course, sampling&quot;. Each day, the musicians started from scratch, often working on songs for 16 hours straight. &quot;Odelay&quot;″s conception lies in an unfinished studio album Beck first embarked on following the success of &quot;Loser&quot;, chronicling the difficult time he experienced: &quot;There was a cycle of everyone dying around me,&quot; he recalled later. He was constantly recording, and eventually put together an album of somber, orchestrated folk tunes; one that, perhaps, &quot;could have been a commercial blockbuster along with similarly themed work by Smashing Pumpkins, Nine Inch Nails and Nirvana&quot;. Instead, Beck plucked one song from it—the &quot;Odelay&quot; album closer &quot;Ramshackle&quot;—and shelved the rest (&quot;Brother&quot; and &quot;Feather In Your Cap&quot; were, however, later released as B-sides). Beck was introduced to the Dust Brothers, producers of the Beastie Boys&#x27; album &quot;Paul&#x27;s Boutique&quot;, whose cut-and-paste, sample-heavy production suited Beck&#x27;s vision of a more fun, accessible album. After a record executive explained that &quot;Odelay&quot; would be a &quot;huge mistake&quot;, he spent many months thinking &quot;that I&#x27;d blown it forever&quot;.

&quot;Odelay&quot; was released on June 18, 1996, to commercial success and critical acclaim. The record produced several hit singles including &quot;Where It&#x27;s At&quot;, &quot;Devils Haircut&quot;, and &quot;The New Pollution&quot;, and was nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1997, winning a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album as well as a Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance for &quot;Where It&#x27;s At&quot;. During one busy week in January 1997, he landed his Grammy nominations, appeared on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and &quot;Howard Stern&quot;, and did a last-minute trot on &quot;The Rosie O&#x27;Donnell Show&quot;. The combined buzz gave &quot;Odelay&quot; a second wind, leading to an expanded fan base and additional exposure Beck enjoyed but, like several executives at Geffen, was bewildered by the success of &quot;Odelay&quot;. He would often get recognized in public, which made him feel strange. &quot;It&#x27;s just weird. It doesn&#x27;t feel right. It doesn&#x27;t feel natural to me. I don&#x27;t think I was made for that. I was never good at that,&quot; he later told Pitchfork. &quot;Odelay&quot; sold two million copies and put &quot;one-hit wonder&quot; criticisms to rest. During this time, he contributed the song &quot;Deadweight&quot; to the soundtrack of the film &quot;A Life Less Ordinary&quot; (1997).

===&quot;Mutations&quot; and &quot;Midnite Vultures&quot; (1998–2001)===

Having not been in a proper studio since &quot;Deadweight&quot;, Beck felt anxious to &quot;go in and just do some stuff real quick&quot;, and compiled several songs he had had for years. Beck and his bandmates wrote songs in fourteen days, although just twelve made it onto the album, 1998&#x27;s &quot;Mutations&quot;. Beck hired the producer Nigel Godrich, who had produced Radiohead&#x27;s 1997 album &quot;OK Computer&quot;. Godrich was leaving the United States for England in a short time, which led to the album&#x27;s quick production schedule—&quot;No looking back, no doctoring anything.&quot; The whole point of the record was to capture the performance of the musicians live, an uncharacteristic far-cry from the cut-and-paste aesthetic of &quot;Odelay&quot;. Though the album was originally slated for release by Bong Load Records, Geffen intervened and issued the record against Beck&#x27;s wishes. The artist then sought to void his contracts with both record labels, and in turn the labels sued him for breach of contract. The litigation went on for years and it remains unclear to this day if it has ever been completely resolved. Beck was later awarded Best Alternative Music Performance for &quot;Mutations&quot; at the 42nd Grammy Awards.

&quot;Midnite Vultures&quot;, Beck&#x27;s next studio effort, was originally recorded as a double album, and more than 25 nearly completed songs were left behind. In the studio, Beck and producers studied contemporary hip hop and R&amp;B, specifically R. Kelly, in order to embrace and incorporate those influences in the way Al Green and Stax records had done in previous decades. In July 1998, a core group began to assemble at Beck&#x27;s Pasadena home: bassist Justin Meldal-Johnsen, keyboardist Roger Joseph Manning Jr., and producer-engineers Mickey Petralia and Tony Hoffer. Dozens of session players passed through including Beck&#x27;s father, David Campbell, who played viola and arranged some of the strings. The musicians held communal meals and mountain-bike rides on dusty trails nearby, but remained focused on Beck&#x27;s instructions: to make an up-tempo album that would be fun to play on tour night after night. &quot;I had so many things going on&quot;, said Beck of the recording process. &quot;I had a couple of rooms of computers hooked up, I was doing B sides for Japan, I was programming beats in one room and someone would be cooking dinner in the other room.&quot; In November 1999, Geffen released the much-anticipated &quot;Midnite Vultures&quot;, which attracted confusion: &quot;fans and critics misguidedly worried whether it was serious or a goof,&quot; and as a result, &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the album &quot;never won the audience it deserved&quot;. The record was supported by an extensive world tour. For Beck, it was a return to the high-energy performances that had been his trademark as far back as Lollapalooza. The live stage set included a red bed that descended from the ceiling for the song &quot;Debra&quot;, and the touring band was complemented by a brass section. &quot;Midnite Vultures&quot; was nominated for Best Album at the 43rd Annual Grammy Awards.

===&quot;Sea Change&quot; (2002–2003)===
In 2000, Beck and his fiancée, stylist Leigh Limon, ended their nine-year relationship. Beck lapsed into a period of melancholy and introspection, during which he wrote the bleak, acoustic-based tracks later found on &quot;Sea Change&quot;. Beck sat on the songs, not wanting to talk about his personal life; he later said that he wanted to focus on music and &quot;not really strew my baggage across the public lobby&quot;. Eventually, however, he decided the songs spoke to a common experience, and that it would not seem self-indulgent to record them. In 2001, Beck drifted back to the songs and called Godrich.

Retailers initially predicted that the album would not receive much radio support, but they also believed that Beck&#x27;s maverick reputation and critical acclaim, in addition to the possibility of multiple Grammy nominations, might offset &quot;Sea Change&quot;″s noncommercial sound. &quot;Sea Change&quot;, issued by Geffen in September 2002, was regardless a commercial hit and critical darling, with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; revering it as &quot;the best album Beck has ever made, [...] an impeccable album of truth and light from the end of love. This is his &quot;Blood on the Tracks&quot;.&quot; The album was later listed by the magazine as one of the best records of the decade and of all time, and it also placed second on the year&#x27;s Pazz &amp; Jop Critics Poll. &quot;Sea Change&quot; yielded a low-key, theater-based acoustic tour, as well as a larger tour with The Flaming Lips as Beck&#x27;s opening and backing band. Beck was playful and energetic, sometimes throwing in covers of The Rolling Stones, Big Star, The Zombies and The Velvet Underground.

Following the release of &quot;Sea Change&quot;, Beck felt newer compositions were sketches for something more evolved in the same direction, and wrote nearly 35 more songs in the coming months, keeping demos of them on tapes in a suitcase. During his solo tour, the tapes were left backstage during a stop in Washington, D.C., and Beck was never able to recover them. It was disheartening to the musician, who felt the two years of songwriting represented something more technically complex. As a result, Beck took a break and wrote no original compositions in 2003. Feeling as though it might take him a while to &quot;get back to that [songwriting] territory&quot;, he entered the studio with Dust Brothers to complete a project that dated back to &quot;Odelay&quot;. Nearly half of the songs had existed since the 1990s.

===&quot;Guero&quot; and &quot;The Information&quot; (2004–2007)===

&quot;Guero&quot;, Beck&#x27;s ninth studio album, was recorded over the span of nine months during which several significant events occurred in his life: his girlfriend, Marissa Ribisi, became pregnant; they were married; their son, Cosimo, was born; and they moved out of Silver Lake. The collaboration with the Dust Brothers, his second, was notable for their use of high-tech measures to achieve a lo-fi sound. For example, after recording a &quot;sonically perfect&quot; version of a song at one of the nicest recording studios in Hollywood, the Dust Brothers processed it in an Echoplex to create a gritty, reverb-heavy sound: &quot;We did this high-tech recording and ran it through a transistor radio. It sounded too good, that was the problem.&quot; Initially due to be released in October 2004, &quot;Guero&quot; faced delays and did not come out until March 2005, though unmastered copies of the tracks surfaced online in January.

&quot;Guero&quot; debuted at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 162,000 copies, an all-time sales high. Lead single &quot;E-Pro&quot; peaked at number one at Modern Rock radio, making it his first chart-topper since &quot;Loser&quot;. Beck, inspired by the Nintendocore remix scene and feeling a connection with its lo-fi, home-recording method, collaborated with artists 8-Bit and Paza on &quot;Hell Yes&quot;, an EP issued in February 2005. In December 2005, Geffen also issued &quot;Guerolito&quot;, a fully reworked version of &quot;Guero&quot; featuring remixes by the Beastie Boys&#x27; Ad-Rock, the Dust Brothers&#x27; John King and Scottish electronic duo Boards of Canada. &quot;Guerolito&quot; combines remixes previously heard as B-sides and new versions of album tracks to make a track-by-track reconfiguration of the album. Also released in 2005 was &quot;A Brief Overview&quot;, a 12-track promotional-only &quot;History of Beck&quot; compilation CD sampler that featured a combination of older and newer Beck tracks.
&quot;The Information&quot;, Beck&#x27;s tenth studio album, began production around the same time as &quot;Guero&quot;, in 2003. Working again with Godrich, Beck built a studio in his garden, where they wrote many of the tracks. &quot;The idea was to get people in a room together recording live, hitting bad notes and screaming,&quot; said Beck, adding that the album is best described as &quot;introspective hip hop&quot;. Beck described the recording process as &quot;painful&quot;, noting that he edited down songs constantly and he perhaps recorded the album three times. For the release, Beck was allowed for the first time to fulfill a long-running wish for an unconventional rollout: he made low-budget videos to accompany each song, packaged the CD with sheets of stickers so buyers could customize the cover, and leaked tracks and videos on his website months ahead of the album&#x27;s release. Digital download releases automatically downloaded the song&#x27;s additional video for each single sale, and physical copies came bundled with an additional DVD featuring fifteen videos.

=== &quot;Modern Guilt&quot;, production work, Record Club and &quot;Song Reader&quot; (2008–2013) ===
In 2007, Beck released the single &quot;Timebomb&quot;, which was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance. For his next studio effort, his tenth, Beck tapped Danger Mouse to produce, and the two first met in December 2007 to record. The duo knocked out two tracks in two days, but the notion that the album would be finished in a timely fashion soon evaporated. Beck had known Danger Mouse casually before, as many of his former musicians ended up working with Danger Mouse&#x27;s side project, Gnarls Barkley. Still, the musicians were surprised at how well they got along. Following the grueling recording schedule, Beck was exhausted, calling it &quot;the most intense work I&#x27;ve ever done on anything&quot;, relating that he &quot;did at least 10 weeks with no days off, until four or five in the morning every night.&quot; Beck&#x27;s original vision was a short 10-track burst with two-minute songs, but the songs gradually grew as he fit &#x27;two years of songwriting into two and a half months.&quot; &quot;Modern Guilt&quot; (2008) was &quot;full of off-kilter rhythms and left-field breakdowns, with an overall 1960s vibe.&quot;

&quot;Modern Guilt&quot; was the final release in Beck&#x27;s contract with Geffen Records. Beck, then 38, had held the contract since his early 20s. Released from his label contract and going independent, Beck began working more heavily on his own seven-year-old label, which went through a variety of names. He focused on smaller, more quixotic projects, and moonlighted as a producer, working with artists such as Charlotte Gainsbourg, Thurston Moore and Stephen Malkmus. Beck worked for five or six days a week at the small studio on his property in Malibu, and founded Record Club, a project whereby an entire classic album—by The Velvet Underground, Leonard Cohen, INXS, Yanni—would be covered by another singer in the span of a single day. Beck provided four songs for the film &quot;Scott Pilgrim vs. the World&quot; (2010), each attributed to the title character&#x27;s fictional band, Sex Bob-Omb. Beck also collaborated with Philip Glass, Jack White, Tobacco of Black Moth Super Rainbow, Jamie Lidell, Seu Jorge, Childish Gambino, and The Lonely Island.
&quot;Song Reader&quot;, a project Beck released in December 2012, is 20 songs presented only as sheet music, in the hopes that enterprising musicians will record their own versions. The idea of &quot;Song Reader&quot; came about nearly fifteen years prior, shortly after the release of &quot;Odelay&quot;. When sent a book of transcribed sheet music for that album, Beck decided to play through it and grew interested in the world before recorded sound. He aimed to keep the arrangements as open as possible, to re-create the simplicity of the standards, and became preoccupied with creating only pieces that could fit within the Great American Songbook. In 2013 Beck began playing special &quot;Song Reader&quot; concerts with a variety of guests and announced he was working on a record of &quot;Song Reader&quot; material with other musicians as well as possibly a compilation of fan versions.

In the summer of 2013, Beck was reported to be working on two new studio albums: one a more self-contained acoustic disc in the vein of &quot;One Foot in the Grave&quot; and another described as a &quot;proper follow-up&quot; to &quot;Modern Guilt&quot;. Beck expected to release both albums independently, and released three standalone singles over the course of the year: the electro ballad &quot;Defriended&quot;, the chorus-heavy &quot;I Won&#x27;t Be Long&quot;, and finally &quot;Gimme&quot;. In October 2013, Beck signed to Capitol Records.

=== &quot;Morning Phase&quot;, &quot;Colors&quot;, &quot;Hyperspace&quot; (2014–2022) ===
In January, Beck released the lead single &quot;Blue Moon&quot; from his twelfth studio album, &quot;Morning Phase&quot;. A second single &quot;Waking Light&quot; was also released a week prior to the official release of &quot;Morning Phase&quot; on February 21, 2014. For the recording of the album, Beck reunited with many of the same musicians with whom he had worked on the critically acclaimed 2002 album &quot;Sea Change&quot;, and likely because of this, it has been noted that the two albums share a similar mood and genre.

On February 8, 2015, at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards, &quot;Morning Phase&quot; won three Grammys: Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical; Best Rock Album; and Album of the Year. Upon receiving the Album of the Year award, the album beat out Pharrell Williams&#x27;s &quot;G I R L&quot;, Beyoncé&#x27;s self-titled album, Sam Smith&#x27;s &quot;In the Lonely Hour&quot;, and Ed Sheeran&#x27;s &quot;x&quot;.
In June 2015, Beck released &quot;Dreams&quot;, the first single for his next album. The next June, he released the next single, &quot;Wow&quot;. On September 8, 2017, Beck released the single &quot;Dear Life&quot;, which was followed up with the official release of &quot;Up All Night&quot; on September 18. The album, &quot;Colors&quot;, was released on October 13, 2017. It was recorded at co-executive producer Greg Kurstin&#x27;s Los Angeles studio, with Beck and Kurstin playing nearly every instrument themselves. The experimental pop-fused record received generally positive reviews from critics. On July 18, 2018, Beck performed the title track &quot;Colors&quot;, and the first single &quot;Wow&quot; on &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot;.

On April 15, 2019, Beck released a single co-produced with Pharrell Williams titled &quot;Saw Lightning&quot; from his fourteenth studio album, titled &quot;Hyperspace&quot;. The song &quot;Dark Places&quot; was released on November 6, with the album being released on November 22.

=== Recent activity (2022–present) ===
On September 25, 2022, Beck released a cover of Neil Young&#x27;s track &quot;Old Man&quot; to promote a &quot;Sunday Night Football&quot; game. The track was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance for the 65th Grammy Awards later in 2022. A music video for the track would be released on December 8, 2022. Following the commercial featuring the cover, Neil Young posted a still image from his 1988 music video for &quot;This Note&#x27;s For You&quot;, an anti-commercialization song in protest of the cover and commercial.

Later on February 10, 2023, he released the song &quot;Thinking About You&quot;, his first original solo-track since 2019&#x27;s &quot;Hyperspace&quot;. A music video for the track would be released on February 20, 2023. It is currently unknown if this means a 15th studio album will be released in the upcoming future or not. Many music critics have noted that it sounds like a return to the folk of &quot;Morning Phase&quot; and &quot;Sea Change&quot;.

On June 21, 2023, Beck released the track &quot;Odyssey&quot; with French pop-rock band Phoenix, who did a co-headlining summer tour with Beck, which started in August and ended in September.

== Collaborations and contributions ==

In 1999, Beck contributed to a tribute album for Bruce Haack and Esther Nelson and their label Dimension 5 Records. The album, Dimension Mix, released in 2005, was a benefit for Cure Autism Now that was produced by Ross Harris, an early collaborator who designed the artwork for &quot;Mellow Gold&quot;.

On June 20, 2009, Beck announced that he was starting an experiment called Record Club, in which he and other musicians would record cover versions of entire albums in one day. The first album covered by Beck&#x27;s Record Club was &quot;The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico&quot;. Starting on June 18, the club began posting covers of songs from the album on Thursday evenings, each with its own video. On September 4, 2009, Beck announced the second Record Club album, &quot;Songs of Leonard Cohen&quot;. Contributors included MGMT, Devendra Banhart, Andrew Stockdale of Wolfmother and Binki Shapiro of Little Joy. In the third Record Club venture, Wilco, Feist, Jamie Lidell and James Gadson joined Beck to cover Skip Spence&#x27;s &quot;Oar&quot;. The first song, &quot;Little Hands&quot;, was posted on Beck&#x27;s website on November 12, 2009. The Record Club has since covered albums by INXS and Yanni.

On June 19, 2009, Beck announced Planned Obsolescence, a weekly DJ set put together by Beck or guest DJs. Soon after, on July 7, Beck announced that his website would be featuring &quot;extended informal conversations with musicians, artists, filmmakers, and other various persons&quot; in a section called Irrelevant Topics. Then, on July 12, he added a section called Videotheque, which he said would contain &quot;promotional videos from each album, as well as live clips, TV show appearances and other rarities&quot;. Also in 2009, Beck collaborated with Charlotte Gainsbourg on her album &quot;IRM&quot;, which was released in January 2010. Beck wrote the music, co-wrote the lyrics, and produced and mixed the album. The lead single, &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot;, is a duet by Beck and Gainsbourg.

In late February 2010, it was announced that electronic artist Tobacco of Black Moth Super Rainbow had collaborated with Beck on two songs, &quot;Fresh Hex&quot; and &quot;Grape Aerosmith&quot;, on his upcoming album &quot;Maniac Meat&quot;. Tobacco revealed that in making the album, Beck sent the vocal parts to him, and that they had never actually met. In March 2010, Beck revealed that he had produced songs for the new Jamie Lidell album, &quot;Compass&quot;. In the summer of 2010, Beck contributed songs to both &quot;The Twilight Saga: Eclipse&quot; soundtrack, with &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Lost&quot; (a duet with Bat for Lashes), and &quot;True Blood (HBO Original Series Soundtrack, Vol. 2)&quot;, with &quot;Bad Blood&quot;. He also contributed songs to the soundtrack of Edgar Wright&#x27;s film &quot;Scott Pilgrim vs. the World&quot;, which was released in August 2010.

In 2011, he collaborated with Seu Jorge on a track titled &quot;Tropicália (Mario C. 2011 Remix)&quot; for the Red Hot Organization&#x27;s charitable album &quot;Red Hot+Rio 2&quot;, a follow-up to the 1996 album &quot;Red Hot + Rio&quot;. Proceeds from the sales will be donated to raise awareness and money to fight AIDS/HIV and related health and social issues.

In October 2011, it was widely reported that Beck and producer Hector Castillo were collaborating with American composer Philip Glass to produce a remix album of the composer&#x27;s works in honor of his 75th birthday. The album, &quot;Rework Philip Glass Remixed&quot;, was released on October 23, 2012, to critical acclaim, and featured Beck as both a curator and a performer. In particular, Pitchfork described Beck&#x27;s 22-minute contribution to the album, &quot;NYC: 73–78&quot;, as &quot;a fantasia ... the most startling and original piece of music with Beck&#x27;s name on it in a while, and the first new work to bear his own spirit in even longer.&quot; Reflecting on Beck&#x27;s contribution to the album, Glass remarked that he was &quot;impressed by the novelty and freshness of a lot of the ideas&quot;. Beyond his work as a performer, Beck acted as the album&#x27;s curator, bringing together a diverse collection of artists—including Amon Tobin, Tyondai Braxton, Nosaj Thing, and Memory Tapes—whose work had also been influenced by Glass. In December 2012, an interactive iPhone app titled &quot;Rework_&quot; was released to complement the album.

Beck has contributed three new songs—&quot;Cities&quot;, &quot;Touch the People&quot; and &quot;Spiral Staircase&quot;—to the video game &quot;Sound Shapes&quot; for PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation Vita. Beck collaborated on two songs for Childish Gambino&#x27;s &quot;Royalty&quot; mixtape in 2012. In 2014, Beck collaborated with Sia for the song &quot;Moonquake Lake&quot;, which is featured in the soundtrack for the 2014 &quot;Annie&quot; film.

In 2015, Beck collaborated with former Fun. frontman Nate Ruess on the single &quot;What This World Is Coming To&quot;, which was one of the Grammy-winning artist&#x27;s many works featured on his debut solo album &quot;Grand Romantic&quot; released in June 2015. He also collaborated with electronic dance music duo The Chemical Brothers on their album &quot;Born in the Echoes&quot;, providing lead vocals and also credited in writing for the track &quot;Wide Open&quot;, released in July. In 2016, Beck collaborated with French electronic music band M83, providing vocals for the song &quot;Time Wind&quot; from their album &quot;Junk&quot;. He was also featured on &quot;Tiny Cities&quot; by Flume. He also collaborated with Lady Gaga on the song &quot;Dancin&#x27; in Circles&quot;, from her 2016 album &quot;Joanne&quot;.

Also in 2016, during a pre-show for the Grammy Awards, Beck collaborated with the surviving members of the band Nirvana to play Nirvana&#x27;s rendition of &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot; as a tribute to both David Bowie, who had died just 1 month earlier, and Kurt Cobain, the former lead singer of Nirvana. Beck and Nirvana teamed up once again in 2020 for a fundraiser event, alongside St. Vincent and Dave Grohl&#x27;s Daughter Violet Grohl.

In 2017, Beck appeared in the multiple award-winning film &quot;The American Epic Sessions&quot;, directed by Bernard MacMahon. He recorded &quot;14 Rivers, 14 Floods&quot; backed by a full gospel choir, live onto the first electrical sound recording system from the 1920s.

In 2021, Beck collaborated with Paul McCartney to make his hit single &quot;Find My Way&quot; on the album &quot;McCartney III Imagined&quot;.

In 2023, Beck collaborated with The Chemical Brothers for the second time on the song &quot;Skipping like a Stone&quot;. This was the fourth single to be released from their album &quot;For That Beautiful Feeling&quot;.

In 2024, Beck appeared on the song, &quot;Boom Boom Back&quot; by the band, Hinds. The song is from the band&#x27;s 2024 album, &quot;Viva Hinds&quot;. Later in July that year Beck also featured on the Orville Peck song &quot;Death Valley High&quot; off the latter&#x27;s album &quot;Stampede&quot;. A music video for the song was also filmed and feature appearances from the two musicians as well as drag queen Gigi Goode and actress Sharon Stone.

==Musical style ==
Beck&#x27;s musical style has been considered alternative and indie. He has played many of the instruments in his music himself. Beck has also done some remixes for fellow artists, notably David Bowie and Björk. He has been known to synthesize several musical elements together in his music, including folk, psychedelia, electronic, country, Latin music, hip hop, funk, soul, blues, noise music, jazz, art pop and many types of rock. Because of this unconventional approach, Beck has been described as a postmodern musician. He has also taken music from Los Angeles as a reference point in his songs.

Pitchfork Media applauded &quot;Midnite Vultures&quot;, saying, &quot;Beck wonderfully blends Prince, Talking Heads, &quot;Paul&#x27;s Boutique&quot;, &#x27;Shake Your Bon-Bon&#x27;, and Mathlete on &quot;Midnite Vultures&quot;, his most consistent and playful album yet.&quot; The review commented that his mix of &quot;goofy piety and ambiguous intent&quot; helped the album. A Beck song called &quot;Harry Partch&quot;, a tribute to the composer of the same name and his &quot;corporeal&quot; music, employs Partch&#x27;s 43-tone scale.

==Art career==
During 1998, Beck&#x27;s art collaborations with his grandfather Al Hansen were featured in an exhibition titled &quot;Beck &amp; Al Hansen: Playing With Matches&quot;, which showcased solo and collaborative collage, assemblage, drawing and poetry works. The show toured from the Santa Monica Museum of Art to galleries in New York City and Winnipeg, Manitoba. Beck chose Winnipeg due to a family connection, as his grandfather gave their family stability through his work as a street car conductor in Winnipeg. A catalog of the show was published by Plug in Editions/Smart Art Press.

==Personal life==
Beck&#x27;s nine-year relationship with designer Leigh Limon and their breakup is said to have inspired his 2002 album &quot;Sea Change&quot;. He wrote most of the songs for the album one week after the breakup. In April 2004, Beck married actress Marissa Ribisi, the twin sister of actor Giovanni Ribisi, shortly before the birth of their son. Their daughter was born in 2007. Beck filed for divorce from Ribisi on February 15, 2019. Their divorce was finalized on September 3, 2021.

Beck has described himself as both Jewish and a Scientologist, but no longer identifies as the latter. Through his parents, he has been involved in Scientology for most of his life; his ex-wife, Marissa, is also a second-generation Scientologist. He publicly acknowledged his affiliation for the first time in a &quot;New York Times Magazine&quot; interview on March 6, 2005. Further confirmation came in an interview with the &quot;Sunday Tribune&quot; in June 2005, where he stated, &quot;Yeah, I&#x27;m a Scientologist. My father has been a Scientologist for about 35 years, so I grew up in and around it.&quot; Despite this, Beck disavowed previous reports of his being a Scientologist in a November 2019 interview with the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; and said, &quot;I think there&#x27;s a misconception that I&#x27;m a Scientologist. I&#x27;m not a Scientologist. I don&#x27;t have any connection or affiliation with it.&quot; He added that &quot;I was raised celebrating Jewish holidays, and I consider myself Jewish.&quot;

Beck&#x27;s mother is artist/writer/performer Bibbe Hansen, a former Andy Warhol The Factory collaborator. His siblings are fiber artist Channing Hansen (born in 1972 in Los Angeles) and poet Rain Whittaker.

Beck sustained a spinal injury while filming the music video for 2005&#x27;s &quot;E-Pro&quot;. The incident was severe enough to curtail his touring schedule for a few years, but he has since recovered.

==Appearances in media==
The 1986 punk rock musical film &quot;&quot;, starred Tomata du Plenty of The Screamers and featured a young Beck in a small non-speaking role. Beck also appears in &quot;Southlander&quot; (2001), an American independent film by Steve Hanft and Ross Harris.

Beck has performed on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; seven times. During his 2006 performance in the Hugh Laurie episode, Beck was accompanied by the puppets that had been used onstage during his world tour. He has made two cameo appearances as himself on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;: one in a sketch about medicinal marijuana, and one in a VH1 &quot;Behind the Music&quot; parody that featured &quot;Fat Albert &amp; the Junkyard Gang&quot;. Beck performed a guest voice as himself on Matt Groening&#x27;s animated show &quot;Futurama&quot;, in the episode &quot;Bendin&#x27; in the Wind&quot;. He performed in episode 10 of the fourth season of &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot;, in which the producer character Artie (Rip Torn) referred to him as a &quot;hillbilly from outer space&quot;. He also made a very brief voice appearance in the 1998 cartoon feature film &quot;The Rugrats Movie&quot;, and guest-starred as himself in a 1997 episode of &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot; titled &quot;Edelweiss&quot;.

On January 22, 2010, Beck appeared on the last episode of &quot;The Tonight Show with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; as a backup guitarist for a Will Ferrell-led rendition of Lynyrd Skynyrd&#x27;s &quot;Free Bird&quot; alongside ZZ Top guitarist Billy Gibbons, Ben Harper, and O&#x27;Brien himself on guitar. On March 1, 2014, Beck was the musical guest on a &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; episode hosted by Jim Parsons. Beck also appeared as himself in the 2017 film &quot;The Circle&quot;, giving a musical performance of the song &quot;Dreams&quot;.

<text>An antiquarian or antiquary () is an aficionado or student of antiquities or things of the past. More specifically, the term is used for those who study history with particular attention to ancient artefacts, archaeological and historic sites, or historic archives and manuscripts. The essence of antiquarianism is a focus on the empirical evidence of the past, and is perhaps best encapsulated in the motto adopted by the 18th-century antiquary Sir Richard Colt Hoare, &quot;We speak from facts, not theory.&quot;

The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; first cites &quot;archaeologist&quot; from 1824; this soon took over as the usual term for one major branch of antiquarian activity. &quot;Archaeology&quot;, from 1607 onwards, initially meant what is now seen as &quot;ancient history&quot; generally, with the narrower modern sense first seen in 1837.

Today the term &quot;antiquarian&quot; is often used in a pejorative sense, to refer to an excessively narrow focus on factual historical trivia, to the exclusion of a sense of historical context or process. Few today would describe themselves as &quot;antiquaries&quot;, but some institutions such as the Society of Antiquaries of London (founded in 1707) retain their historic names. The term &quot;antiquarian bookseller&quot; remains current for dealers in more expensive old books.

==History==
===Antiquarianism in ancient China===
During the Song dynasty (960–1279), the scholar Ouyang Xiu (1007–1072) analyzed alleged ancient artefacts bearing archaic inscriptions in bronze and stone, which he preserved in a collection of some 400 rubbings. Patricia Ebrey writes that Ouyang pioneered early ideas in epigraphy.

The () or &quot;Illustrated Catalogue of Examined Antiquity&quot; (preface dated 1092) compiled by Lü Dalin () (1046–1092) is one of the oldest known catalogues to systematically describe and classify ancient artefacts which were unearthed. Another catalogue was the () or &quot;Revised Illustrated Catalogue of Xuanhe Profoundly Learned Antiquity&quot; (compiled from 1111 to 1125), commissioned by Emperor Huizong of Song (r. 1100–1125), and also featured illustrations of some 840 vessels and rubbings.

Interests in antiquarian studies of ancient inscriptions and artefacts waned after the Song dynasty, but were revived by early Qing dynasty (1644–1912) scholars such as Gu Yanwu (1613–1682) and Yan Ruoju (1636–1704).

===Antiquarianism in ancient Rome===
In ancient Rome, a strong sense of traditionalism motivated an interest in studying and recording the &quot;monuments&quot; of the past; the Augustan historian Livy uses the Latin in the sense of &quot;antiquarian matters.&quot; Books on antiquarian topics covered such subjects as the origin of customs, religious rituals, and political institutions; genealogy; topography and landmarks; and etymology. Annals and histories might also include sections pertaining to these subjects, but annals are chronological in structure, and Roman histories, such as those of Livy and Tacitus, are both chronological and offer an overarching narrative and interpretation of events. By contrast, antiquarian works as a literary form are organised by topic, and any narrative is short and illustrative, in the form of anecdotes.

Major antiquarian Latin writers with surviving works include Varro, Pliny the Elder, Aulus Gellius, and Macrobius. The Roman emperor Claudius published antiquarian works, none of which is extant. Some of Cicero&#x27;s treatises, particularly his work on divination, show strong antiquarian interests, but their primary purpose is the exploration of philosophical questions. Roman-era Greek writers also dealt with antiquarian material, such as Plutarch in his &quot;Roman Questions&quot; and the &quot;Deipnosophistae&quot; of Athenaeus. The aim of Latin antiquarian works is to collect a great number of possible explanations, with less emphasis on arriving at a truth than in compiling the evidence. The antiquarians are often used as sources by the ancient historians, and many antiquarian writers are known only through these citations.

===Medieval and early modern antiquarianism===

Despite the importance of antiquarian writing in the literature of ancient Rome, some scholars view antiquarianism as emerging only in the Middle Ages. Medieval antiquarians sometimes made collections of inscriptions or records of monuments, but the Varro-inspired concept of among the Romans as the &quot;systematic collections of all the relics of the past&quot; faded. Antiquarianism&#x27;s wider flowering is more generally associated with the Renaissance, and with the critical assessment and questioning of classical texts undertaken in that period by humanist scholars. Textual criticism soon broadened into an awareness of the supplementary perspectives on the past which could be offered by the study of coins, inscriptions and other archaeological remains, as well as documents from medieval periods. Antiquaries often formed collections of these and other objects; cabinet of curiosities is a general term for early collections, which often encompassed antiquities and more recent art, items of natural history, memorabilia and items from far-away lands.
The importance placed on lineage in early modern Europe meant that antiquarianism was often closely associated with genealogy, and a number of prominent antiquaries (including Robert Glover, William Camden, William Dugdale and Elias Ashmole) held office as professional heralds. The development of genealogy as a &quot;scientific&quot; discipline (i.e. one that rejected unsubstantiated legends, and demanded high standards of proof for its claims) went hand-in-hand with the development of antiquarianism. Genealogical antiquaries recognised the evidential value for their researches of non-textual sources, including seals and church monuments.

Many early modern antiquaries were also chorographers: that is to say, they recorded landscapes and monuments within regional or national descriptions. In England, some of the most important of these took the form of county histories.

In the context of the 17th-century scientific revolution, and more specifically that of the &quot;Quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns&quot; in England and France, the antiquaries were firmly on the side of the &quot;Moderns&quot;. They increasingly argued that empirical primary evidence could be used to refine and challenge the received interpretations of history handed down from literary authorities.

===19th–21st centuries===

By the end of the 19th century, antiquarianism had diverged into a number of more specialised academic disciplines including archaeology, art history, numismatics, sigillography, philology, literary studies and diplomatics. Antiquaries had always attracted a degree of ridicule (see below), and since the mid-19th century the term has tended to be used most commonly in negative or derogatory contexts. Nevertheless, many practising antiquaries continue to claim the title with pride. In recent years, in a scholarly environment in which interdisciplinarity is increasingly encouraged, many of the established antiquarian societies (see below) have found new roles as facilitators for collaboration between specialists.

==Terminological distinctions==
===Antiquaries and antiquarians===
&quot;Antiquary&quot; was the usual term in English from the 16th to the mid-18th centuries to describe a person interested in antiquities (the word &quot;antiquarian&quot; being generally found only in an adjectival sense). From the second half of the 18th century, however, &quot;antiquarian&quot; began to be used more widely as a noun, and today both forms are equally acceptable.

===Antiquaries and historians===
From the 16th to the 19th centuries, a clear distinction was perceived to exist between the interests and activities of the antiquary and the historian. The antiquary was concerned with the relics of the past (whether documents, artefacts or monuments), whereas the historian was concerned with the narrative of the past, and its political or moral lessons for the present. The skills of the antiquary tended to be those of the critical examination and interrogation of his sources, whereas those of the historian were those of the philosophical and literary reinterpretation of received narratives. Jan Broadway defines an antiquary as &quot;someone who studied the past on a thematic rather than a chronological basis&quot;. Francis Bacon in 1605 described readings of the past based on antiquities (which he defined as &quot;Monuments, Names, Wordes, Proverbes, Traditions, Private Recordes, and Evidences, Fragments of stories, Passages of Bookes, that concerne not storie, and the like&quot;) as &quot;unperfect Histories&quot;. Such distinctions began to be eroded in the second half of the 19th century as the school of empirical source-based history championed by Leopold von Ranke began to find widespread acceptance, and today&#x27;s historians employ the full range of techniques pioneered by the early antiquaries. Rosemary Sweet suggests that 18th-century antiquaries
===Antiquarians, antiquarian books and antiques===
In many European languages, the word antiquarian (or its equivalent) has shifted in modern times to refer to a person who either trades in or collects rare and ancient antiquarian books; or who trades in or collects antique objects more generally. In English, however, although the terms &quot;antiquarian book&quot; and &quot;antiquarian bookseller&quot; are widely used, the nouns &quot;antiquarian&quot; and &quot;antiquary&quot; very rarely carry this sense. An antiquarian is primarily a &quot;student&quot; of ancient books, documents, artefacts or monuments. Many antiquarians have also built up extensive personal collections in order to inform their studies, but a far greater number have not; and conversely many collectors of books or antiques would not regard themselves (or be regarded) as antiquarians.

==Pejorative associations==

Antiquaries often appeared to possess an unwholesome interest in death, decay, and the unfashionable, while their focus on obscure and arcane details meant that they seemed to lack an awareness both of the realities and practicalities of modern life, and of the wider currents of history. For all these reasons they frequently became objects of ridicule.

The antiquary was satirised in John Earle&#x27;s &quot;Micro-cosmographie&quot; of 1628 (&quot;Hee is one that hath that unnaturall disease to bee enamour&#x27;d of old age, and wrinkles, and loves all things (as Dutchmen doe Cheese) the better for being mouldy and worme-eaten&quot;), in Jean-Siméon Chardin&#x27;s painting &quot;Le Singe Antiquaire&quot; (), in Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s novel &quot;The Antiquary&quot; (1816), in the caricatures of Thomas Rowlandson, and in many other places. The &quot;New Dictionary of the Terms Ancient and Modern of the Canting Crew&quot; of defines an antiquary as &quot;A curious critic in old Coins, Stones and Inscriptions, in Worm-eaten Records and ancient Manuscripts, also one that affects and blindly dotes, on Relics, Ruins, old Customs Phrases and Fashions&quot;. In his &quot;Epigrams&quot;, John Donne wrote of The Antiquary: &quot;If in his study he hath so much care To hang all old strange things Let his wife beware.&quot; The word&#x27;s resonances were close to those of modern terms for individuals with obsessive interests in technical minutiae, such as nerd, trainspotter or anorak.
The connoisseur Horace Walpole, who shared many of the antiquaries&#x27; interests, was nonetheless emphatic in his insistence that the study of cultural relics should be selective and informed by taste and aesthetics. He deplored the more comprehensive and eclectic approach of the Society of Antiquaries, and their interest in the primitive past. In 1778 he wrote:
In his essay &quot;On the Uses and Abuses of History for Life&quot; from his &quot;Untimely Meditations&quot;, philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche examines three forms of history. One of these is &quot;antiquarian history&quot;, an objectivising historicism which forges little or no creative connection between past and present. Nietzsche&#x27;s philosophy of history had a significant impact on critical history in the 20th century.

C. R. Cheney, writing in 1956, observed that &quot;[a]t the present day we have reached such a pass that the word &#x27;antiquary&#x27; is not always held in high esteem, while &#x27;antiquarianism&#x27; is almost a term of abuse&quot;. Arnaldo Momigliano in 1990 defined an antiquarian as &quot;the type of man who is interested in historical facts without being interested in history&quot;. Professional historians still often use the term &quot;antiquarian&quot; in a pejorative sense, to refer to historical studies which seem concerned only to place on record trivial or inconsequential facts, and which fail to consider the wider implications of these, or to formulate any kind of argument. The term is also sometimes applied to the activities of amateur historians such as historical reenactors, who may have a meticulous approach to reconstructing the costumes or material culture of past eras, but who are perceived to lack much understanding of the cultural values and historical contexts of the periods in question.

==Antiquarian societies==
===London societies===
A College (or Society) of Antiquaries was founded in London in , to debate matters of antiquarian interest. Members included William Camden, Sir Robert Cotton, John Stow, William Lambarde, Richard Carew and others. This body existed until 1604, when it fell under suspicion of being political in its aims, and was abolished by King James I. Papers read at their meetings are preserved in Cotton&#x27;s collections, and were printed by Thomas Hearne in 1720 under the title &quot;A Collection of Curious Discourses&quot;, a second edition appearing in 1771.
In 1707 a number of English antiquaries began to hold regular meetings for the discussion of their hobby and in 1717 the Society of Antiquaries was formally reconstituted, finally receiving a charter from King George II in 1751. In 1780 King George III granted the society apartments in Somerset House, and in 1874 it moved into its present accommodation in Burlington House, Piccadilly. The society was governed by a council of twenty and a president who is &quot;ex officio&quot; a trustee of the British Museum.

===Other notable societies===
*The Society of Antiquaries of Scotland was founded in 1780 and had the management of a large national antiquarian museum in Edinburgh.
*The Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle upon Tyne, the oldest provincial antiquarian society in England, was founded in 1813.
*In Ireland a society was founded in 1849 called the Kilkenny Archaeological Society, holding its meetings at Kilkenny. In 1869 its name was changed to the Royal Historical and Archaeological Association of Ireland, and in 1890 to the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland, its office being transferred to Dublin.
*In France the &quot;Société des Antiquaires de France&quot; was formed in 1813 by the reconstruction of the , which had existed since 1804.
*The American Antiquarian Society was founded in 1812, with its headquarters at Worcester, Massachusetts. In modern times, its library has grown to over 4 million items, and as an institution it is internationally recognised as a repository and research library for early (pre-1876) American printed materials.
*In Denmark, the (also known as or the Royal Society of Northern Antiquaries) was founded at Copenhagen in 1825.
*In Germany the was founded in 1852.

In addition, a number of local historical and archaeological societies have adopted the word &quot;antiquarian&quot; in their titles. These have included the Cambridge Antiquarian Society, founded in 1840; the Lancashire and Cheshire Antiquarian Society, founded in 1883; the Clifton Antiquarian Club, founded in Bristol in 1884; the Orkney Antiquarian Society, founded in 1922; and the Plymouth Antiquarian Society, founded in Plymouth, Massachusetts in 1919.

<text>Midnight&#x27;s Children is the second novel by Indian-British writer Salman Rushdie, published by Jonathan Cape with cover design by Bill Botten, about India&#x27;s transition from British colonial rule to independence and partition. It is a postcolonial, postmodern and magical realist story told by its chief protagonist, Saleem Sinai, set in the context of historical events. The style of preserving history with fictional accounts is self-reflexive.

&quot;Midnight&#x27;s Children&quot; sold over one million copies in the UK alone and won the Booker Prize and James Tait Black Memorial Prize in 1981. It was also awarded the special Booker of Bookers prize in 1993, and the Best of the Booker in 2008, to celebrate the Booker Prize&#x27;s 25th and 40th anniversaries. In 2003 the novel appeared at number 100 on the BBC&#x27;s The Big Read poll which determined the UK&#x27;s &quot;best-loved novels&quot; of all time.

==Background and plot summary==
&quot;Midnight&#x27;s Children&quot; is a loose allegory for events in 1947 British Raj India and after the partition of India. The protagonist and narrator of the story is Saleem Sinai, born at the exact moment when India became an independent country. He was born with telepathic powers, as well as an enormous and constantly dripping nose with an extremely sensitive sense of smell. The novel is divided into three books.

The first book begins with the story of the Sinai family, particularly with events leading up to the fall of British Colonial India and the partition. Saleem is born precisely at midnight, 15 August 1947, therefore, exactly as old as independent India. He later discovers that all children born in India between 12 a.m. and 1 a.m. on that date are imbued with special powers. Saleem, using his telepathic powers, assembles a &quot;Midnight Children&#x27;s Conference&quot;, reflective of the issues India faced in its early statehood concerning the cultural, linguistic, religious, and political differences faced by a vastly diverse nation. Saleem acts as a telepathic conduit, bringing hundreds of geographically disparate children into contact while also attempting to discover the meaning of their gifts. In particular, those children born closest to the stroke of midnight wield more powerful gifts than the others. Shiva &quot;of the Knees&quot;, Saleem&#x27;s nemesis, and Parvati, called &quot;Parvati-the-witch,&quot; are two of these children with notable gifts and roles in Saleem&#x27;s story.

Meanwhile, Saleem&#x27;s family begin a number of migrations and endure the numerous wars which plague the subcontinent. During this period he also suffers amnesia until he enters a quasi-mythological exile in the jungle of Sundarban, where he is re-endowed with his memory. In doing so, he reconnects with his childhood friends. Saleem later becomes involved with the Indira Gandhi-proclaimed Emergency and her son Sanjay&#x27;s &quot;cleansing&quot; of the Jama Masjid slum. For a time Saleem is held as a political prisoner; these passages contain scathing criticisms of Indira Gandhi&#x27;s over-reach during the Emergency as well as a personal lust for power bordering on godhood. The Emergency signals the end of the potency of the Midnight Children, and there is little left for Saleem to do but pick up the few pieces of his life he may still find and write the chronicle that encompasses both his personal history and that of his still-young nation, a chronicle written for his son, who, like his father, is both chained and supernaturally endowed by history.

==Major themes==
The technique of magical realism finds liberal expression throughout the novel and is crucial to constructing the parallel to the country&#x27;s history. The story moves in different parts of Indian Subcontinent – from Kashmir to Agra and then to Bombay, Lahore and Dhaka. Nicholas Stewart in his essay, &quot;Magic realism in relation to the post-colonial and Midnight&#x27;s Children,&quot; argues that the &quot;narrative framework of &quot;Midnight&#x27;s Children&quot; consists of a tale – comprising his life story – which Saleem Sinai recounts orally to his wife-to-be Padma. This self-referential narrative (within a single paragraph Saleem refers to himself in the first person: &#x27;And I, wishing upon myself the curse of Nadir Khan...;&#x27; and the third: &#x27;&quot;I tell you,&quot; Saleem cried, &quot;it is true. ...&quot;&#x27;) recalls indigenous Indian culture, particularly the similarly orally recounted &quot;Arabian Nights&quot;. The events in the book also parallel the magical nature of the narratives recounted in &quot;Arabian Nights&quot; (consider the attempt to electrocute Saleem at the latrine (p. 353), or his journey in the &#x27;basket of invisibility&#x27; (p. 383)).&quot;

He also notes that, &quot;the narrative comprises and compresses Indian cultural history.&quot; &quot;&#x27;Once upon a time,&#x27; Saleem muses, &#x27;there were Radha and Krishna, and Rama and Sita, and Laila and Majnun; also (because we are not unaffected by the West) Romeo and Juliet, and Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn&#x27; (259).&quot; Stewart (citing Hutcheon) suggests that &quot;Midnight&#x27;s Children&quot; chronologically entwines characters from both India and the West, &quot;with post-colonial Indian history to examine both the effect of these indigenous and non-indigenous cultures on the Indian mind and in the light of Indian independence.&quot;

== Style ==
&quot;Midnight&#x27;s Children&quot; has been called &quot;a watershed in the post-independence development of the Indian English novel&quot;, to the extent that the decade after its 1981 publication has been called &quot;post-Rushdie&quot;. During that decade, many novels inspired by &quot;Midnight&#x27;s Children&quot; were written by both established and young Indian writers.

Rushdie&#x27;s innovative use of magic realism allowed him to employ the nation-as-family allegory and at the same time confound it with an impossible telepathy among a multitude of children from a multitude of languages, cultures, regions and religions. No one genre dominates the entire novel, however. It encompasses the comic and the tragic, the real, the surreal, and the mythic. The postcolonial experience could not be expressed by a Western or Eastern, public or private, polarity or unity, any more than any single political party could represent all the people of the nation.

Rushdie also coined the word &quot;chutnification&quot; in the book to describe the adoption of Indian elements into the English language or culture. A chutney is a sauce for a dry base, originating from the Indian subcontinent.

==Reception==
Upon release, the book was generally well-received. According to Rushdie, &quot;...I celebrated the book’s critical reception...The three I have never forgotten were written by Anita Desai in the Washington Post, by Clark Blaise in the New York Times and by Robert Towers in the New York Review of Books.&quot;

According to Rushdie, there was &quot;one memorable bad review&quot;. In his words from &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;The BBC radio program “Kaleidoscope” had devoted a great deal of time to my novel, and given it the works: Indian music to introduce it, a reading, a sympathetic interview with me, and then it was over to their critic ... who unreservedly hated the book. The program’s presenter, Sheridan Morley, kept asking this critic (whose name I’ve forgotten) to find some little thing to praise. “But didn’t you think ... “ “Wouldn’t you at least agree that ... “ and so on. The critic was implacable. No, no, there was nothing he had liked at all. After the magnificent buildup, this negative intransigence was delightfully, bathetically funny.&quot;

&quot;Midnight&#x27;s Children&quot; was awarded the 1981 Booker Prize, the English Speaking Union Literary Award, and the James Tait Prize. It also was awarded The Best of the Booker prize twice, in 1993 and 2008 (this was an award given out by the Booker committee to celebrate the 25th and 40th anniversary of the award).

The book went on to sell over one million copies in the UK alone.

In 1984 Prime Minister Indira Gandhi brought an action against the book in the British courts, claiming to have been defamed by a single sentence in the penultimate paragraph of chapter 28, in which her son Sanjay Gandhi was said to have had a hold over his mother by his accusing her of contributing to his father Feroze Gandhi&#x27;s death through her neglect. The case was settled out of court when Salman Rushdie agreed to remove the offending sentence.

==Adaptations==
In the late 1990s the BBC was planning to film a five-part mini-series of the novel with Rahul Bose in the lead, but due to pressure from the Muslim community in Sri Lanka (a later Rushdie&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot;, published in 1988 caused widespread uproar in the Muslim world), the filming permit was revoked and the project was cancelled. Later in 2003, the novel was adapted for the stage by the Royal Shakespeare Company. &quot;The Guardian&quot; gave the play an average rating of 5.2 out of 10 based on reviews from multiple British newspapers. BBC Radio 4 broadcast a dramatic adaptation in 2017 at the 70th anniversary of Indian independence, repeated in five parts in 2021.

Director Deepa Mehta collaborated with Salman Rushdie on a new version of the story, the film &quot;Midnight&#x27;s Children&quot;. British-Indian actor Satya Bhabha played the role of Saleem Sinai while other roles were played by Indian actors Shriya Saran, Seema Biswas, Shabana Azmi, Anupam Kher, Siddharth Narayan, Rahul Bose, Soha Ali Khan, Shahana Goswami, Anita Majumdar and Darsheel Safary. The film was premiered in September 2012 at the Toronto International Film Festival (2012-09-09) and the Vancouver International Film Festival (2012-09-27). For an academic overview of the adaptations of &quot;Midnight&#x27;s Children&quot;, see Mendes and Kuortti (2016).

In June 2018 streaming service Netflix announced plans to adapt &quot;Midnight&#x27;s Children&quot; as an original Netflix TV series. By the end of 2019, the project had been abandoned. Although showrunner Vishal Bhardwaj had received support from Rushdie for his script and had done much of the work on casting and scouting locations, after the compromises he had made on his poorly-received 2017 film &quot;Rangoon&quot; he would not go ahead without agreement for a more ambitious project with a greater special effects budget than Netflix was prepared to agree.

<doc id="149690" wikidata="Q188482" url="?curid=149690" title="Robin Gibb">
<text>Robin Hugh Gibb (22 December 1949 – 20 May 2012) was a British singer and songwriter. He gained worldwide fame as a member of the Bee Gees with elder brother Barry and fraternal twin brother Maurice. Robin Gibb also had his own successful solo career.

Gibb was born at the Jane Crookall Maternity Home, Douglas on the Isle of Man, to English parents, Hugh and Barbara Gibb; the family later moved to Manchester for three years (where Andy was born) before settling in Redcliffe, just north of Brisbane, Australia. Gibb began his career as part of the family trio (Barry-Maurice-Robin). When the group found their first success, they returned to England, where they achieved worldwide fame. In 2002, the Bee Gees were appointed as CBEs for their &quot;contribution to music&quot;. However, investiture at Buckingham Palace was delayed until 2004.

With record sales estimated in excess of 200 million, the Bee Gees became one of the most successful pop groups of all time. Music historian Paul Gambaccini described Gibb as &quot;one of the major figures in the history of British music&quot; and &quot;one of the best white soul voices ever&quot; owing to his distinctive vibrato-laden soulful voice. From 2008 to 2011, Gibb was president of the UK-based Heritage Foundation, which honours figures in British culture. After a career touching six decades, Gibb last performed on stage in February 2012 supporting injured British servicemen at a charity concert at the London Palladium. After numerous health problems in his final years, including a battle with colorectal cancer, Gibb died in May 2012 at the age of 62 from liver and kidney failure.

As a musician, Gibb primarily played a variety of keyboards, notably piano, organ and Mellotron on the Bee Gees album &quot;Odessa&quot; (1969); he also played acoustic guitar and organ on his debut solo album &quot;Robin&#x27;s Reign&quot; (1970).

==Childhood==
Robin Hugh Gibb was born on 22 December 1949 in Jane Crookall Maternity Home in Douglas, Isle of Man, to Barbara Gibb (née Pass) and Hugh Gibb. He was the fraternal twin of Maurice Gibb and was the older of the two by 35 minutes. Apart from Maurice, he had one sister, Lesley Evans, and two brothers, Barry and Andy. As children in Manchester, Gibb and his brothers began committing crimes such as petty burglary and arson.

Their neighbour in Willaston, Isle of Man, Marie Beck, was a friend of his mother and her sister Peggy. Helen Kenney, another neighbour, was living in Douglas Head. As Kenney recalls, &quot;Barry and the twins used to come into Mrs Beck&#x27;s house and we would talk to them. Robin once said to me, &#x27;We&#x27;re going to be rich one day, we&#x27;re going to form a band!&#x27; Little did I realise he meant it.&quot;

==Career==
===1955–1958: The Rattlesnakes===

In 1955, when the Gibbs moved back to their hometown of Manchester, the brothers formed the Rattlesnakes. The band consisted of Barry on guitar and vocals, Robin and Maurice on vocals, Paul Frost on drums, and Kenny Horrocks on tea-chest bass. The quintet performed in local theatres in Manchester. Their influences at that time were popular acts, such as the Everly Brothers, Cliff Richard, and Paul Anka. In May 1958, the group was disbanded as Frost and Horrocks left, and the name changed to Wee Johnny Hayes and the Blue Cats. In August 1958, the family travelled to Australia on the same ship as Red Symons, who also became a prominent musician in Australia.

===1958–1969: Bee Gees===

The boys finally changed their name to the Bee Gees, while they were living in Queensland, Australia. The Bee Gees&#x27; debut television appearance was in 1960 on Desmond Tester&#x27;s &quot;Strictly for Moderns&quot; when they performed &quot;Time Is Passing By&quot;. When they signed to Festival Records at the start of 1963 (but they were assigned to Leedon Records) they released their debut single, &quot;The Battle of the Blue and the Grey&quot;. Their 1964 single &quot;Claustrophobia&quot; is notable for being the first song that features Gibb as an instrumentalist playing melodica. The first Bee Gees record on which he sang lead was &quot;I Don&#x27;t Think It&#x27;s Funny&quot; in 1965. In 1966, he wrote his first song &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know Why I Bother With Myself&quot; that was credited to him. Also in 1966, Gibb and his brother Barry took more solo vocals.

The group&#x27;s first period of British success in the late 1960s started with &quot;New York Mining Disaster 1941&quot; and the band added drummer Colin Petersen and guitarist Vince Melouney to their line up. They toured Europe in 1967 and 1968 as well as the US in August 1968. The band&#x27;s first UK No. 1 was &quot;Massachusetts&quot;, which features Gibb on lead vocal.

On 13 June 1968, Gibb recorded demos for seven songs, accompanying himself on guitar. The tape listed Robin alone as artist and songwriter. Of these, one – &quot;Indian Gin and Whisky Dry&quot; – later appeared on &quot;Idea&quot;. On 27 July 1968, Gibb collapsed and fell unconscious. He was later admitted to a London nursing home suffering from nervous exhaustion, and was moved to a facility in Sussex on 31 July to continue his recuperation. The group, about to embark on its first US tour, cancelled four dates after Gibb had a relapse and flew back to England for additional rest.

Gibb co-wrote &quot;Only One Woman&quot;, The Marbles&#x27; debut single, which was a hit in several countries, especially in Europe and New Zealand. The Marbles were a British rock duo consisting of Graham Bonnet and Trevor Gordon. The Bee Gees&#x27; single &quot;I Started a Joke,&quot; on which Robin sang lead, was not released as a single in the UK but was the group&#x27;s first US Top 10 hit. Gibb claimed that the melody of the song was inspired by the sounds he heard in a jet engine.

In August, the band started to record &quot;Odessa&quot;. In January 1969, Gibb co-wrote another Marbles single, &quot;The Walls Fell Down,&quot; and co-produced the sessions that same month. However, the rivalry with Barry eventually prompted Robin to leave the group and begin a solo career (three months after guitarist Vince Melouney left the band) after his song &quot;Lamplight&quot; was relegated to the B-side of Barry&#x27;s song &quot;First of May&quot;. Meanwhile, there were rumours during this period that he was dealing with drug problems, allegedly leading his parents to threaten legal action to make him a ward of court (the UK age of majority at that time being 21, while Gibb was only 19). The Bee Gees&#x27; last recording session with Robin was in February 1969. Gibb&#x27;s last performance with the group was on &quot;The Tom Jones Show&quot; and &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; before leaving the group.

===1969–1970: Solo career===
On 19 March 1969, he announced that he was leaving the Bee Gees the same day as the band recorded &quot;Tomorrow Tomorrow&quot;, their first single without Robin. In his solo career, Gibb was initially successful with a number 2 UK hit, &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot;, which sold over one million copies and received a gold disc. He performed that song on the German TV show &quot;Beat-Club&quot;. Also in 1969, Gibb co-produced &quot;Love for Living&quot;. The song was performed by Clare Torry and was released as a single. He also started a mini-tour, making television appearances in a dozen countries to promote &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot;. By 19 July 1969, &quot;New Musical Express&quot; announced &quot;Tonight, [Robin Gibb] is fronting a 97-piece orchestra and a 60-piece choir in a recording of his latest composition, &#x27;To Heaven and Back&#x27;, which was inspired by the Apollo 11 moonshot. It is an entirely instrumental piece, with the choir being used for astral effects. The single will be billed as by &#x27;The Robin Gibb Orchestra and Chorus&#x27; and it will be rush-released as soon as possible by Polydor&quot;. At that time, he was doing a musical score for &quot;Henry The Eighth&quot; and making his own film called &quot;Family Tree&quot;. Later, it was reported on &quot;NME&quot; that Gibb wrote dozens of songs for Tom Jones. A meeting between Gibb and Jones was said to be arranged for Gibb&#x27;s return from a three-day promo trip to Germany.

On 31 January and 1 February 1970, Gibb performed in Auckland, New Zealand at Redwood 70, billed as the first modern music festival held in New Zealand. During the first night of the festival, Gibb and his 16-piece backing orchestra were pelted with cans and tomatoes from the crowd, making his backing band gradually leave during the performance. Robin&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;Robin&#x27;s Reign&quot; (1970) was less successful and he soon found that being a solo artist was unsatisfying. Maurice played bass on the song &quot;Mother and Jack&quot;, but was subsequently removed from the project by producer Robert Stigwood. Also in that year, Colin Petersen produced &quot;Make a Stranger Your Friend&quot; performed by Jonathan Kelly, on which Gibb sang on the chorus with Mick Taylor, Klaus Voormann, Madeline Bell, three members of The Family Dogg, Jackie Lomax, Peter Sellers, Spike Milligan and others. By January 1970, Gibb started to record his second solo album &quot;Sing Slowly Sisters&quot; until February, but the album would go unreleased until 2015. He wanted &quot;Great Caesar&#x27;s Ghost&quot; to be released as a single around 1970 with &quot;Engines, Aeroplanes&quot; as the B-side but the two songs were not included on that album and were unreleased to this day.

On 13 June, Gibb and Maurice reunited and they recorded four songs, with two of the four tracks released on their upcoming album &quot;2 Years On&quot;. The session was originally for Maurice alone as he brought Gibb to the sessions. On 21 June sessions, the pair recorded another five songs.

===1970–1979: Bee Gees comeback===
In August, the pair returned to the studio and they announced that the Bee Gees were back, with or without Barry&#x27;s contribution. One of the fourteen songs, &quot;Back Home&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Weeping&quot; was also released on &quot;2 Years On&quot;. On 21 August it was announced that Barry had rejoined the group and they were recording together. The first song after the announcement was &quot;Lonely Days&quot; which reached No. 3 in the US Billboard Hot 100. On the &quot;2 Years On&quot; album, Gibb&#x27;s songs included &quot;Alone Again&quot;. He also co-wrote and sang lead vocals on the title track as well as &quot;Man For All Seasons&quot;. In December 1970, Gibb recorded a demo &quot;After the Laughter&quot;. The Bee Gees had their first US No. 1 single &quot;How Can You Mend a Broken Heart&quot;, with Gibb contributing on the song, writing with Barry and singing lead vocals on its first verse.

In April 1972, two months after the departure of drummer Geoff Bridgford, he wrote his last solo composition on a Bee Gees record until 1999, &quot;Never Been Alone&quot;. In 1976, on the group&#x27;s &quot;Children of the World&quot; album, he sang lead on &quot;Love Me&quot; as well as doing falsetto on the track&#x27;s coda, and he also used his falsetto on his lead vocal part on the song &quot;Lovers&quot; as Barry provided lead vocals on the entire song. On the &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; soundtrack, he did not sing lead vocals on any Bee Gees song, unlike their previous and next albums. Four tracks off the album reached the UK Top 10; &quot;How Deep Is Your Love&quot;, &quot;More Than A Woman&quot;, &quot;Stayin&#x27; Alive&quot;, and &quot;You Should Be Dancing&quot;. Moreover, &quot;Night Fever&quot; spent longer at #1 than any track in 1978.

In 1978, Gibb performed on the &quot;Sesame Street Fever&quot; album for the Sesame Street children&#x27;s TV program. He was one of the singers on the &quot;Sesame Street Fever&quot; title track, he sang a song called &quot;Trash&quot; for the character Oscar the Grouch, and spoke with Cookie Monster at the beginning of &quot;C is for Cookie&quot;.

===1980–1985: Collaborations with artists===
In January 1980, Gibb co-wrote and co-produced Jimmy Ruffin&#x27;s 1980 album &quot;Sunrise&quot; with Blue Weaver. Ruffin had enjoyed one of his first significant hits, &quot;Hold on to My Love&quot;, from the album &quot;Sunrise,&quot; which Robin Gibb had written and produced. &quot;Hold on to My Love&quot; had reached and stayed in the US Top 30 hits for 14 weeks. Also in 1980, he duetted with Marcy Levy on the song &quot;Help Me!&quot; (reached No. 50 in the US) featured on the soundtrack of the film &quot;Times Square&quot;. The other artists performing on the film, including Gary Numan, Roxy Music, Ramones, The Cure and The Cars. Also in 1980, most of Barbra Streisand&#x27;s album &quot;Guilty&quot; was co-written by Gibb with Barry. In February 1981, the Bee Gees returned to the studio and recorded &quot;Living Eyes&quot;, unlike the previous album, this album was not as successful. However, in subsequent years the &quot;Living Eyes&quot; album would become one of the most beloved of Bee Gee&#x27;s albums by their diehard fans. &quot;Living Eyes&quot; was produced and published during a time when the Bee Gees were in litigation with their long-time manager Robert Stigwood, leaving them without the production and organization team they usually had behind them to promote their albums. They then worked on Dionne Warwick&#x27;s album &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; and recorded songs for the film &quot;Staying Alive&quot;.

====Initial solo success====
He recorded his second solo album with Maurice&#x27;s participation, &quot;How Old Are You?&quot;. The lead single &quot;Juliet&quot; was a success in Europe as well as &quot;Another Lonely Night in New York&quot; and the title track. In 1984, he released his third solo album &quot;Secret Agent&quot;, a new wave/synthpop-influenced LP (reached No. 97 in the US, No. 31 in Germany and No. 20 in Switzerland). The album&#x27;s lead and first single &quot;Boys Do Fall in Love&quot; reached the &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine top 40 list of hits, as well as reaching No. 70 in the UK, No. 7 in South Africa and No. 10 in Italy. Other singles such as the title track and &quot;In Your Diary&quot; did not repeat the success of the first single. Due to the success of &quot;Boys Do Fall in Love&quot;, he performed the song in several TV shows including &quot;Eldorado&quot; (Danish TV).

In 1985, he released his fourth solo album &quot;Walls Have Eyes&quot; with the singles &quot;Like a Fool&quot; and &quot;Toys&quot;; both songs did not chart in the US or UK. These three albums were more successful in Europe than in the UK or US. In 1986, Gibb joined Thompson Twins, Zak Starkey, Cliff Richard, Bonnie Tyler, John Parr and Holly Johnson under the name Anti-Heroin Project to record a charity single called &quot;Live-In World&quot;.

===1986–2002===
In late 1986, the Bee Gees began writing and recording songs for their album &quot;ESP&quot; to be released in 1987. In 1992, Lulu recorded &quot;Let Me Wake Up in Your Arms&quot; on which he co-wrote. Gibb later contributed vocals on the Brazilian duo José y Durval&#x27;s &quot;Palavras/Palabras&quot; (a Spanish or Portuguese version of &quot;Words&quot;). In 1998, the Bee Gees recorded their own version of &quot;Ellan Vannin&quot; with lead vocals by Gibb. It was later released as a single as a limited edition CD to benefit the Manx Children in Need charity. In 2001, the Bee Gees released their last album &quot;This Is Where I Came In&quot; and features his last composition on a Bee Gees record &quot;Embrace&quot;.

===2003–2009: Touring years===
On 27 January 2003, two weeks after the sudden death of Maurice, Robin released a solo album, &quot;Magnet&quot; in Germany on SPV GmbH, and worldwide shortly afterwards. &quot;Magnet&quot; featured the Bee Gees song &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; (from the 1989 album &quot;One&quot;) in a new acoustic version. The lead single, &quot;Please&quot;, had coincidental lyrics about &#x27;loss&#x27;. In recent years, Gibb sang the vocals to the opening titles to the British ITV show &quot;The Dame Edna Treatment&quot;. In August 2003, Gibb announced the release of a new single of &quot;My Lover&#x27;s Prayer&quot;, a song first recorded by the Bee Gees in 1997 on the album &quot;Still Waters&quot;, with lead vocals by Gibb and singers Wanya Morris and Lance Bass. That version was played on the radio but was never actually released. In October 2003, Gibb recorded a second version of the song with Alistair Griffin, a-runner up in the UK television program &quot;Fame Academy&quot; on which Gibb appeared as a judge. In January 2004, the new version of that song was released in the UK as a double A side CD single. It eventually reached number 5 in the UK music charts. In late 2004, Gibb embarked a solo tour of Germany, Russia and Asia with singer Alistair Griffin as the opening act. On his return to the UK, Gibb released a CD and DVD of live recordings from the German leg of the tour, backed by the Frankfurt Neue Philharmonic Orchestra of Frankfurt, Germany. In 2005, Gibb made a solo tour of Latin America.

In January 2005, Gibb joined his brother Barry and several other artists under the name One World Project to record a charity single in aid of Asian tsunami relief, titled &quot;Grief Never Grows Old&quot;. Other artists who performed on the single included Boy George, Steve Winwood, Jon Anderson, Rick Wakeman, Sir Cliff Richard, Bill Wyman, America, Kenney Jones, Chicago, Brian Wilson of The Beach Boys, Russell Watson and Davy Spillane. In June 2005, Gibb joined The X Factor runner up band G4 at a sell-out concert at the Royal Albert Hall in London, singing the Bee Gees song &quot;First of May&quot;. In December 2005, a recordings of this performance was released as part of double A side single, credited as &quot;G4 feat Robin Gibb&quot; together with G4&#x27;s cover version of the Johnny Mathis song &quot;When a Child is Born&quot;. &quot;First of May&quot; also appeared on the platinum selling album &quot;G4 &amp; Friends&quot;, which reached number 6 in the UK album charts. In the same year, Gibb presented master classes at Paul McCartney&#x27;s Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts and oversaw the selection for release of thesis works by music graduates for the next two terms. On 20 February 2006, Gibb and Barry performed at a concert for Diabetes Research Institute of the University of Miami in Hollywood, Florida. This was their first joint performance since Maurice&#x27;s death. In March 2006, Gibb announced plans for more solo concerts in Shanghai, China and Portugal.

In May 2006, Gibb took part in the Prince&#x27;s Trust 30th birthday Concert at the Tower of London along with Barry. They sang three songs: &quot;Jive Talkin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;To Love Somebody&quot; and &quot;You Should Be Dancing&quot;. In September 2006, Gibb performs at the Miss World 2006 contest finals in Warsaw, Poland. In November 2006, Gibb released his sixth album &quot;My Favourite Christmas Carols&quot; the last album released in his lifetime, backed by The Serlo Concert, a London choir. This album featured a new song by Gibb called &quot;Mother of Love&quot;, which was released in Europe as a download single. The song was inspired by Maurice and was Gibb&#x27;s first new composition since Maurice died. Gibb donated all royalties from &quot;Mother of Love&quot; to the Janki Foundation for Global Healthcare, and dedicated the song to Dadi Janki, the organisation&#x27;s spiritual leader. Gibb dedicated the album to his mother, Barbara. &quot;My Favourite Christmas Carols&quot; has a bonus DVD disc titled &quot;A Personal Christmas Moment with Robin Gibb&quot;. Also in November 2006, Gibb performed a solo concert, entitled &#x27;Bee Gees – Greatest Hits&#x27; at the Araneta Coliseum (now Smart Araneta Coliseum) in Manila, Philippines. Gibb marked his return to his birthplace by playing a concert at the Isle of Man TT festival in 2007. Gibb donated all of his share of the money from this concert to the children&#x27;s ward at Noble&#x27;s Hospital, Isle of Man, and invited all emergency service staff and marshals for the TT to attend for free.

On 18 May 2008, Gibb released the song &quot;Alan Freeman Days&quot; in tribute to the Australian DJ Alan Freeman. The song was issued as a download only track, although a promotional CD was issued by Academy Recordings. In December 2008, &quot;Alan Freeman Days&quot; was followed by another downloadable song titled &quot;Wing and a Prayer&quot;, which shared the same name as a song from the 1989 &quot;One&quot; album. However, the new song was actually a reworking of the song, &quot;Sing Slowly Sisters&quot;, that had remained unreleased since 1970. Later in December, Gibb issued another song, &quot;Ellan Vannin (Home Coming Mix)&quot;, featuring the King William&#x27;s College Choir from the Isle of Man. (&quot;Ellan Vannin&quot; is the Manx name for the Isle of Man.) On 8 September 2007, Gibb performed at a concert in Salt Lake City, Utah at EnergySolutions Arena for the Nu Skin Enterprises Convention, singing a set of Bee Gees hits. On 25 October 2007, Gibb performed at the National Palace of Culture in Sofia, Bulgaria and sang the Bee Gees&#x27; most famous songs.

In 2008, Gibb completed a new solo album entitled &quot;50 St. Catherine&#x27;s Drive&quot;, but it was never released until 2014. The song &quot;Instant Love&quot; was a collaboration with Gibb&#x27;s son, Robin-John both having written the music and vocals. &quot;Instant Love&quot; featuring Robin-John on lead vocals appeared in a short film called &quot;Bloodtype: The Search&quot; in which Robin-John appeared. On 25 October 2008, to mark the 30th anniversary of the song &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; topping the UK charts, Gibb performed with special guests including Ronan Keating, Stephen Gateley, Sam Sparro, Sharleen Spiteri, Gabriella Climi and Bryn Christopher at the London music festival BBC Electric Proms. Gibb went back to the top of the UK charts in 2009 when he collaborated with singers Ruth Jones, Rob Brydon and Tom Jones on a new version of &quot;Islands in the Stream&quot;, written by Gibb and his brothers Barry and Maurice. The new version, inspired by the BBC comedy TV show &quot;Gavin &amp; Stacey&quot;, was created to benefit the charity Comic Relief.

===2010–2012: Final years===
In 2010, Gibb was also a guest mentor on the Australian version of &quot;The X Factor&quot;, alongside TV host Kyle Sandilands, actress/singer Natalie Imbruglia, and singers Ronan Keating and Guy Sebastian. Also in 2010, Gibb toured in Australia with Bonnie Tyler as his supporting guest. Together they performed at Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane and Perth. In September 2011, Gibb recorded the Bee Gees classic &quot;I&#x27;ve Gotta Get a Message to You&quot; with British Army men The Soldiers for a charity single in the UK, it was produced with his son Robin John Gibb and the video for which was produced by Vintage TV. Gibb was the subject of an edition of the BBC genealogy documentary series &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot; first broadcast on 21 September 2011. On 30 January 2012, Gibb announced his intention to appear onstage at the Coming Home Concert at the London Palladium in February to benefit British soldiers returning home from Afghanistan. It would be his last performance onstage. Over a period of two years, Gibb and Robin-John wrote the score for &quot;The Titanic Requiem&quot;, recorded by Royal Philharmonic Orchestra to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the sinking of the &quot;Titanic&quot;. Gibb was due to attend the piece&#x27;s première on 10 April 2012 at the Central Hall, Westminster, London, but his failing health kept him away. He died the next month.

==Personal life==
In 1968, Gibb married Molly Hullis, a secretary in Robert Stigwood&#x27;s organisation. Not long before they were married they survived the Hither Green rail crash together. They had two children together, Spencer (b. 1972) and Melissa (b. 1974). The couple divorced in 1980 after years of living separate lives, with Gibb almost permanently in the US and Hullis remaining in the UK; she filed for divorce on 22 May 1980. On 9 September 1983, Gibb was arrested and sentenced to 14 days in jail for speaking to the press about his previous marriage in breach of a court order.

Gibb&#x27;s second marriage, from 1985 until his death, was to Dwina Murphy, an author and artist. She is interested in the Druidry religion and is a follower of the neo-Hindu Brahma Kumaris movement. The couple had a son, Robin-John (known as RJ, b. 21 January 1983). Robin-John&#x27;s first major musical project was the &quot;Titanic Requiem&quot; (2012), written with Gibb and first performed at the Central Hall, Westminster, London, on 10 April 2012, by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and RSVP Voices.

At 50 years of age, Gibb began an affair with his 25-year-old housekeeper, Claire Yang, which eight years later produced his fourth child, Snow Evelyn Robin Juliet Gibb, born 4 November 2008.

Gibb and his wife divided their time between their homes in Peel, Isle of Man, their mansion in Miami, Florida and their main residence in Thame, Oxfordshire.

On 10 March 1988, younger brother Andy died in Oxford, of myocarditis. On 12 January 2003, twin brother Maurice died in Miami Beach, Florida, of complications from a twisted intestine.

Politically, Gibb was a supporter of New Labour, the British Labour Party when Tony Blair was Prime Minister. He launched a rally in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, ahead of the 2005 General Election. He was a close friend of Blair, who was criticised for staying at Gibb&#x27;s Miami mansion during Christmas 2006. In 2008, Gibb publicly stated that he continued to get on &quot;like a house on fire&quot; with Blair and said that the then Labour prime minister, Gordon Brown, regularly listened to the Bee Gees. &quot;He listens to our music every day. Gordon likes our music and I like Gordon&quot;, he told &quot;The Times&quot;. In a tribute upon his death, longtime friend Tony Blair said: &quot;Robin was not only an exceptional and extraordinary musician and songwriter, he was a highly intelligent, interesting and committed human being. He was a great friend with a wonderful open and fertile mind and a student of history and politics.&quot;

Gibb worked on behalf of several charities. He was the organiser of the Sunseeker Ball in aid of the Outward Bound Trust. For the International Confederation of Societies of Authors and Composers (CISAC), Gibb served as president from 2007 to 2012. He was also the longest serving president (2008–2011) of the Heritage Foundation, which honours figures of British culture and facilitated his campaign on behalf of the Bomber Command Memorial Appeal.

==Health issues and death==

On 14 August 2010, while performing in Belgium, Gibb began to feel abdominal pains. On 18 August 2010 at an Oxford hospital, he underwent emergency surgery. Gibb recovered and returned to perform concerts in New Zealand and Australia. During this time, Gibb was also involved in promoting fund-raising for the memorial dedicated to RAF Bomber Command in Green Park, London. Gibb also wrote &quot;The Titanic Requiem&quot; with his son Robin-John, which was recorded by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra to commemorate the 100th anniversary in 2012 of the sinking of the &quot;Titanic&quot;. Gibb continued to make television appearances and other events following his surgery, but in April 2011 he was forced by health problems to cancel his tour of Brazil. Another concert in Paris was cancelled in October 2011. On 14 October, Gibb was due to perform the charity single with the Soldiers but was again rushed to hospital with severe abdominal pains. On 18 October, following his release from the hospital, Gibb appeared on ITV&#x27;s &quot;The Alan Titchmarsh Show&quot; looking gaunt and frail.

On 27 October 2011, Gibb cancelled an appearance only minutes before he was due to perform at the Poppy Appeal Concert in London. In November 2011, he was diagnosed with liver cancer, which metastasised to his lower digestive system. In March 2012, Gibb was hospitalised for intestinal surgery and cancelled scheduled appearances while recovering. In April, however, he contracted pneumonia and fell into a coma, which he came out of later in April. He died in a London hospital on 20 May 2012, at the age of 62. While it was initially reported that he died from cancer, Robin-John Gibb said that his father&#x27;s cancer had gone into remission by the time of his death and the cause was kidney failure.

His funeral was held on 8 June 2012 and he was buried at the Church of St Mary the Virgin, near his home in Thame, Oxfordshire. In September of the same year, a blue plaque was placed on the house. In 2015, a headstone, engraved with some of the lyrics of his group&#x27;s songs, including &quot;How Deep Is Your Love&quot;, was placed.

===Reactions===
Robin and his brother Barry had famously clashed both personally and professionally for decades before his death, and that conflict lasted to the end. Nonetheless, Barry delivered a eulogy at his brother&#x27;s funeral, saying: &quot;Even right up to the end we found conflict with each other, which now means nothing. It just means nothing. If there&#x27;s conflict in your lives – get rid of it.&quot;

At Robin&#x27;s funeral, Barry talked about the connection between Robin and his twin brother, Maurice, saying: &quot;They were both beautiful and now they&#x27;re together.&quot; Barry added details about Robin&#x27;s struggle losing his brother Maurice a decade earlier, saying: &quot;I think the greatest pain for Robin in the past ten years was losing his twin brother, and I think it did all kinds of things to him.&quot;

The Who&#x27;s Roger Daltrey recalled: &quot;A lovely, lovely guy. I hear everyone talking about the success of their career but I haven&#x27;t heard many talk about him as a singer and I used to think he was one of the best. To me, singing is about moving people and Robin&#x27;s voice had something about it that could move me and, I&#x27;m sure, millions of others. It was almost like his heart was on the outside.&quot; John Travolta recalled, &quot;I thought Robin was one of the most wonderful people, gifted, generous and a real friend to everyone he knew. And we&#x27;ll miss him.&quot; Tim Rice described Gibb as &quot;a charming man&quot;. Rice added: &quot;I saw him only a couple of weeks ago. He wasn&#x27;t at all well but was putting up a marvellous fight. It&#x27;s a terrible loss for the music industry.&quot; Gibb&#x27;s friend Cliff Richard said, &quot;We are a fraternity of people who sing pop and rock and Robin is another one of us who&#x27;s gone too soon, too early.&quot; Ringo Starr told the BBC: &quot;Robin will be remembered as a musician and as a singer and part of the Bee Gees.&quot; Dionne Warwick said: &quot;He was wonderful. He was a jokester. He had an incredibly witty sense of humour and was fun to be around.&quot;

Kenny Rogers recalled: &quot;Robin was a part of something unique. Mostly, Robin was a good guy who didn&#x27;t deserve to die this young. We will all miss him for what he was as a person and what he brought to music.&quot; Other artists paid tribute to Gibb, including Justin Timberlake (who played Robin in the &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; skit &quot;The Barry Gibb Talk Show&quot;), Ronan Keating, Shane Filan of Westlife, Liam Gallagher, Hanson, David Draiman of Disturbed, Atmosphere, Paula Abdul, Jake Shears of the Scissor Sisters, Jermaine Dupri, Peter Frampton, Adam Hills, Peter Andre, Richard Marx, Taboo of the Black Eyed Peas, Justin Bieber, the Doors, Bruno Mars, Sam Sparro, Elton John, Jamey Jasta of Hatebreed, Duran Duran, the Script and Bryan Adams.

===Final studio album===
Gibb&#x27;s final studio album, &quot;50 St. Catherine&#x27;s Drive&quot;, was released posthumously on 29 September 2014 in the UK and 30 September 2014 in the US. The album reached No. 70 in the UK and No. 39 in Germany. It features previously unreleased recordings from 2007 and 2008. The lead single, &quot;Days of Wine and Roses&quot;, was premiered in the United States on 12 September. Reprise Records issued a new version of &quot;I Am the World&quot; from the album as a single in the UK. Gibb&#x27;s first compilation album entitled, &quot;Saved by the Bell – The Collected Works of Robin Gibb: 1969–70&quot; was released in May 2015 and contained Gibb&#x27;s songs between 1969 and 1970 including demos of songs that were sung by the Bee Gees and the unreleased material from &quot;Sing Slowly Sisters&quot;.

==Acclaim and recognition==

In 1994, Gibb was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame at the Grammy Museum in Los Angeles. In 1997, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio, US, as a member of the Bee Gees. At the 1997 BRIT Awards held at the Earls Court Exhibition Centre in London on 24 February, the Bee Gees received the award for Outstanding Contribution to Music.

In the 2002 New Year Honours, Gibb was appointed as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) along with his brothers Maurice and Barry. However, the official presentation ceremony at Buckingham Palace in London was delayed until 2004 due to Maurice&#x27;s death.

In May 2004, Gibb and his brother Barry both received honorary doctorates of music from the University of Manchester, England. In 2005, Gibb received the Steiger Award (Miner Award) in Bochum, Germany for accomplishments in the arts. On 10 July 2009, both brothers were also made Freemen of the Borough of Douglas, Isle of Man. The award was also bestowed posthumously on Maurice, therefore confirming the freedom of the town of their birth to Gibb, Barry and Maurice.

The radio and television presenter Paul Gambaccini has stated that the Bee Gees were &quot;second only to Lennon and McCartney as the most successful songwriting unit in British popular music&quot;, and recognised Gibb as &quot;one of the major figures in the history of British music [and] one of the best white soul voices ever&quot;. Gibb was a fellow of the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors (BASCA).

===Australian Songwriters Hall of Fame===

<text>Mark Anthony Myrie (born 15 July 1973), known professionally as Buju Banton, is a Jamaican dancehall, ragga, and reggae singer. He is one of the most significant and well-regarded artists in Jamaican music. Banton has collaborated with many international artists, including those in the hip hop, Latin and punk rock genres, as well as the sons of Bob Marley.

Banton released a number of dancehall singles as early as 1987 but came to prominence in 1992 with two albums, &quot;Stamina Daddy&quot; and &quot;Mr. Mention&quot;, the latter becoming the best-selling album in Jamaican history upon its release. That year he also broke the record for No. 1 singles in Jamaica, previously held by Bob Marley and the Wailers. He signed with the major label Mercury Records and released &quot;Voice of Jamaica&quot; in 1993. By the mid-1990s, Banton&#x27;s music became more influenced by his Rastafari faith, as heard on the seminal albums &quot;&#x27;Til Shiloh&quot; and &quot;Inna Heights&quot;.

In 2009, he was arrested for cocaine trafficking charges in the United States, his first trial resulting in a hung jury. His 2010 album &quot;Before the Dawn&quot; won a Grammy Award for Best Reggae Album at the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards. In 2011, he was convicted on the aforementioned criminal charge and was imprisoned in the U.S. until December 2018, whereupon he was released, and deported to Jamaica.

==Biography==
===Background===
Buju Banton was born in Kingston, Jamaica, in an area known as Barbican Road, Kingston 8. Buju is a nickname given to him by his mother as a child. &quot;Banton&quot; is a Jamaican word that refers to someone who is a respected storyteller, and it was adopted by Myrie in tribute to the deejay Burro Banton, whom he admired as a child. Buju emulated Burro&#x27;s rough vocals and forceful delivery, developing his own distinctive style. Buju&#x27;s mother was a higgler, or street vendor, while his father worked as a labourer at a tile factory. He was the youngest of fifteen children born into a family that was directly descended from the Maroons of Jamaica. In August 2024, Banton said he had traced his origin to the Igbo people according to his bloodline. Igbo is an ethnic group predominantly found in Nigeria. Singer Sean Kingston allege that Banton is his uncle, but that story is yet to be proven true.

Banton has homes in Jamaica and Tamarac, Florida (United States). He also has 17 children.

===Early career===
As a youngster, Banton would often watch his favourite artists perform at outdoor shows and local dancehalls in Denham Town. At the age of 12, he picked up the microphone for himself and began toasting under the moniker of Gargamel, working with the Sweet Love and Rambo Mango sound systems. In 1986, he was introduced to producer Robert Ffrench by fellow deejay Clement Irie, and his first single, &quot;The Ruler&quot; was released not long afterward in 1987. This led to recording sessions with producers such as Patrick Roberts, Bunny Lee, Winston Riley, and Digital B.

===1990s===
In 1991, Banton joined Donovan Germain&#x27;s Penthouse Records label and began a fruitful partnership with producer Dave Kelly who later launched his own &quot;Madhouse Records&quot; label. Banton is one of the most popular musicians in Jamaican history, having major chart success in 1992, with &quot;Bogle&quot; and &quot;Love me Browning&quot;, both massive hits in Jamaica. Controversy erupted over &quot;Love Me Browning&quot; which spoke of Banton&#x27;s penchant for lighter-skinned black women: &quot;Mi love my car mi love my bike mi love mi money and ting, but most of all mi love mi browning.&quot; Some accused Banton of denigrating the beauty of darker-skinned black women. In response, he released &quot;Love Black Woman&quot;, which spoke of his love for dark-skinned beauties: &quot;Mi nuh Stop cry, fi all black women, respect all the girls dem with dark complexion&quot;. 1992 was an explosive year for Banton as he broke Bob Marley&#x27;s record for the greatest number of #1 singles in a year. Banton&#x27;s gruff voice dominated the Jamaican airwaves for the duration of the year. His debut album, &quot;Mr. Mention&quot;, includes many of his greatest hits from that year including &quot;Bonafide Love&quot; featuring Wayne Wonder, the singer who first brought Banton out as a guest star on the annual Jamaican stage show Sting.

1992 also saw the unsanctioned re-release of &quot;Boom Bye Bye&quot;, a controversial song recorded several years earlier in 1988 when the artist was 15 years old, which resulted in a backlash that threatened to destroy his career. Several years later, the song would later become the subject of outrage in the United States and Europe, leading to Banton being dropped from the line-up of the WOMAD festival as well as numerous other scheduled performances. Banton subsequently issued a public apology.

Now on the major Mercury/PolyGram label, Banton released the hard-hitting &quot;Voice of Jamaica&quot; in 1993. The album included a number of conscious tracks. These tracks included &quot;Deportees&quot;, a song which criticises those Jamaicans who went abroad but never sent money home; &quot;Tribal War&quot; a collaboration with Tony Rebel, Brian &amp; Tony Gold, and Terry Ganzie, a sharp condemnation of political violence that interpolates Little Roy&#x27;s classic reggae song of the same name; and &quot;Willy, Don&#x27;t Be Silly&quot;, which promotes safe sex and the use of contraceptives, particularly the condom, profits from which were donated to a charity supporting children with AIDS. Banton was invited to meet Jamaican Prime Minister P. J. Patterson, and won several awards that year at the Caribbean Music Awards and the Canadian Music Awards.

Some of Banton&#x27;s lyrics dealt with violent themes, which he explained as reflecting the images that young Jamaicans were presented with by the news media. The reality of Kingston&#x27;s violence was brought home in 1993 by the murders in separate incidents of three of his friends and fellow recording artists, the deejays Pan Head and Dirtsman and singer Mickey Simpson. His response was the single &quot;Murderer&quot;, which condemned gun violence, going against the flow of the prevailing lyrical content in dancehall. The song inspired several clubs to stop playing songs with the excessively violent subject matter. Late in 1994, Banton was also affected by the death of his friend Garnett Silk. Banton&#x27;s transformation continued, as he embraced the Rastafari movement and began growing dreadlocks. His performances and musical releases took on a more spiritual tone. Banton toured Europe and Japan, playing sold-out shows.

&quot;&#x27;Til Shiloh&quot; (1995) was a very influential album, incorporating live instrumentation as well as digital rhythms, and incorporating the sounds of roots reggae along with the harder-edged dancehall sounds that first made Banton famous. The artist was embracing his Rastafari faith and his new album reflected these beliefs. &quot;Til Shiloh&quot; successfully blended conscious lyrics with a hard-hitting dancehall vibe. The album included earlier singles such as &quot;Murderer&quot; along with &quot;Wanna Be Loved&quot; and &quot;Untold Stories&quot;. In 1996, Banton contributed &quot;Wanna Be Loved (Desea ser Amado)&quot; along with Los Pericos to the Red Hot Organization&#x27;s album &quot;Silencio=Muerte: Red Hot + Latin&quot; for the Red Hot Benefit Series. This series raises money to increase AIDS awareness.

That same year, Banton took control of his business by establishing his own Gargamel Music label, releasing the popular single &quot;Love Sponge&quot; on vinyl in Jamaica and overseas. In years to come, Gargamel would expand into an outlet for Banton&#x27;s own productions.

&quot;Inna Heights&quot; (1997) substantially increased Banton&#x27;s international audience as he explored his singing ability and recorded a number of roots-tinged tracks, including the hugely popular &quot;Destiny&quot; and &quot;Hills and Valleys&quot;. The album also included collaborations with artists such as Beres Hammond and the legendary Toots Hibbert. The album was well received by fans at the time and critics praised Banton&#x27;s soaring vocals. The album has aged well and remains a highly regarded work over 20 years after its release. In 1998, Banton met the punk band Rancid and recorded three tracks with them: &quot;No More Misty Days&quot;, &quot;Hooligans&quot; and &quot;Life Won&#x27;t Wait&quot;. The latter became the title track of Rancid&#x27;s 1998 album &quot;Life Won&#x27;t Wait&quot;.

===2000s===

Banton signed with Anti- Records, a subsidiary of Brett Gurewitz&#x27;s Epitaph Records, and released &quot;Unchained Spirit&quot; in 2000. The album showcased diverse musical styles, and featured guest appearances by Luciano, Morgan Heritage, Stephen Marley, and Rancid. It carried little of the roots feel heard on &quot;Til Shiloh&quot; and virtually none of the hardcore dancehall sound which had brought him to public acclaim early in his career.

Several singles followed in the start of the new decade, which was perceived as more mellow and introspective, as opposed to the dancehall approach of his early career. In March 2003, Banton released &quot;Friends for Life&quot;, which featured more sharply political songs, including &quot;Mr. Nine&quot;, an anti-gun song that was a hit in Jamaica&#x27;s dancehalls as well as internationally. The album focused on political messages regarding the African diaspora, featuring excerpts from a speech made by Marcus Garvey. &quot;Paid Not Played&quot;, also featured on the album, displayed a gradual return to the themes more popular in dancehall. The album also featured some hip hop influence with the inclusion of rapper Fat Joe.

2006 saw the release of the &quot;Too Bad&quot;, an album that was more dancehall-oriented in style. One of the slower tracks from the album, &quot;Driver A&quot;, went on to become a major hit, while at the same time reviving Sly and Robbie&#x27;s &quot;Taxi&quot; riddim. Banton performed at the 2007 Cricket World Cup Opening Ceremony with Third World and Beres Hammond. The album &quot;Rasta Got Soul&quot; was released in 2009. Produced by Banton, with contributions from longtime collaborators Donovan Germain, Stephen Marsden and Wyclef Jean, &quot;Rasta Got Soul&quot; was a 100% roots reggae album recorded over a seven-year period before its release. It went on to earn Banton his fourth Grammy nomination for Best Reggae Album in 2010.
In December 2009, Drug Enforcement Administration agents remanded Banton to custody in Miami, where the U.S. Attorney charged him with conspiracy to distribute and possession of more than five kilograms of cocaine. Banton was then moved to the Pinellas County Jail where he remained until trial.
A six-day trial in Tampa, Florida was declared a mistrial on 27 September 2010, after the jury was unable to reach a unanimous decision. During the trial, audio recordings were presented of Banton and a drug-dealer-turned-government-informant discussing drugs, drug prices and smuggling. Banton was also seen on a video recording meeting the informant in a police-controlled warehouse tasting cocaine from a kilogram bag. The informant was reportedly paid $50,000 for his work on the case.
The singer was released that November on bond.

He was allowed to perform one concert between trials, which was held on 16 January 2011 to a sold-out crowd in Miami. A few weeks after the performance, he was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Reggae Album but was not allowed to attend the ceremony.

===2010s===
On 13 February 2011, one day before the scheduled start of his second court trial in Tampa, Florida, Banton&#x27;s &quot;Before the Dawn&quot; album was announced as the winner of Best Reggae Album at the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards.

On 22 February 2011, Banton was found guilty of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute five or more kilograms of cocaine, possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug-trafficking offense and using communication wires to facilitate a drug-trafficking offense. He was found not guilty on the charge of attempted possession of five kilograms or more of cocaine. Four months later, he was sentenced to ten years and one month in a federal prison for the cocaine trafficking conviction. His sentencing on a related firearms conviction (despite the fact that Banton was never found with a gun) was scheduled for 30 October 2012, and then postponed on his lawyer&#x27;s request for an investigation of possible juror misconduct. Despite the fact that a juror was found guilty of misconduct, Banton waived his right to an appeal. On 14 May 2015, federal prosecutors agreed to drop the firearms charge.

Banton was released on 7 December 2018 from McRae Correctional Institution.

Upon his release from prison in the United States in December 2018, Banton started The Long Walk to Freedom tour and performed his first concert at National Stadium in Kingston, Jamaica in March 2019; the concert attracted over 30,000 people. During his tour, he continued putting out new music and new singles including &quot;Bagga Mouth&quot;, &quot;False Pretense&quot;, and &quot;Country for Sale&quot;.

In May 2019, Banton released &quot;Country for Sale&quot;; the song topped the iTunes Reggae Chart within minutes after the announcement of its release. The song was recorded at the Gargamel Music Studio, Donovan Germain&#x27;s own recording studio in the Corporate Area. On 12 November of the same year, he released his first official music video entitled “Trust”. The video marked the first anniversary of Banton&#x27;s release from prison and was produced in collaboration with Dave Kelly and directed by Kieran Khan. The track peaked at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Reggae Digital Song Sales chart.

Banton announced his partnership with Jay-Z&#x27;s Roc Nation in November of that year, becoming the second Jamaican reggae artist be represented by the agency, which coincided with the release of his music video &quot;Steppa&quot;. He also announced that Island Records will be the distributor of the collaboration&#x27;s new music.

===2020s===
In January 2020, Banton was featured on the &quot;Bad Boys for Life&quot; soundtrack, which was produced by DJ Khaled. His song titled &quot;Murda She Wrote&quot; was a nod to the 1992 dancehall classic &quot;Murder She Wrote&quot; by Jamaican reggae duo Chaka Demus &amp; Pliers.

On 29 February 2020, Banton produced the &quot;Steppaz Riddim&quot; under this own Gargamel Music label. The riddim, released under Roc Nation, featured 11 tracks and included contributions from Vershon, Delly Ranx, Agent Sasco, Bling Dawg and General B. Banton released his 13th studio album and his first in a decade, &quot;Upside Down 2020&quot; on 26 June 2020. The album includes guest appearances from John Legend, Pharrell, Stefflon Don and Stephen Marley. Banton appeared on the track &quot;Believe What I Say&quot; by Kanye West, off his 2021 album &quot;Donda&quot;.

In 2021, Banton began a project releasing NFT&#x27;s. &quot;Banton has teamed up with CrimsonTide Ltd. to create a collection of original NFT art pieces that will come in digital and autographed canvas pieces&quot;. Banton became one of the first Jamaican artists to release an NFT. He also appeared on DJ Khaled&#x27;s album &quot;Khaled Khaled&quot;. He appeared on the track &quot;WHERE YOU COME FROM&quot; along with Capleton and Bounty Killer.

In 2022, Banton was featured on DJ Khaled&#x27;s album &quot;God Did&quot;. He appeared on the track &quot;These Streets Know My Name&quot; along with Skillibeng, Capleton, Bounty Killer, and Sizzla.

Recently, Buju Banton has expressed criticism towards reggaetón, a genre that blends Latin rhythms with Jamaican dancehall and hip-hop influences, particularly for what he sees as a lack of recognition for the genre&#x27;s Jamaican roots and the absence of collaborations between reggaetón artists and Jamaican musicians. However, in the past, he collaborated with Puerto Rican reggaetón artist Tego Calderón on the song &#x27;Bad Man.&#x27;

==Anti-gay lyrics==

His song &quot;Boom Bye Bye&quot;, which was originally recorded when he was 15 years old and later re-released in 1992 at the age of 19 contains lyrics depicting the murder of gay men. After the re-release in 1992, Banton issued a public apology after receiving public backlash internationally. In 2009, gay-rights groups appealed to venues around the United States not to host Buju Banton.

In 2007, Banton was allegedly among a number of reggae artists who signed a pledge, called the Reggae Compassionate Act, created by the Stop Murder Music campaign, to refrain from performing homophobic songs or making homophobic statements. The Act stated that the signers &quot;do not encourage nor minister to HATE but rather uphold a philosophy of LOVE, RESPECT, and UNDERSTANDING towards all human beings as the cornerstone of reggae music&quot; and promised that the artists involved no longer believed in sexism, homophobia, or violence and that they would not perform music that went against these beliefs on stage. Banton later denied that he had made any such commitment, although he did refrain from performing &quot;Boom Bye Bye&quot; and other offensive songs at the 2007 Reggae Carifest concert.

On 20 March 2019, Banton and his team officially removed &quot;Boom Bye Bye&quot; from his catalog. Banton&#x27;s team pulled the song from streaming platforms such as Apple Music and Spotify, and Banton announced his intention to never perform the song again. Banton issued a statement in which he clarified the importance of tolerance and love, saying, &quot;In recent days there has been a great deal of press coverage about the song &#x27;Boom Bye Bye&#x27; from my past which I long ago stopped performing and removed from any platform that I control or have influence over. I recognize that the song has caused much pain to listeners, as well as to my fans, my family and myself. After all the adversity we&#x27;ve been through I am determined to put this song in the past and continue moving forward as an artist and as a man. I affirm once and for all that everyone has the right to live as they so choose. In the words of the great Dennis Brown, &#x27;Love and hate can never be friends.&#x27; I welcome everyone to my shows in a spirit of peace and love. Please come join me in that same spirit.&quot;

<doc id="149693" wikidata="Q188517" url="?curid=149693" title="Eurovision Song Contest 1958">
<text>The Eurovision Song Contest 1958 was the third edition of the annual Eurovision Song Contest. Organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and host broadcaster (NTS), the contest, originally known as the  () was held on Wednesday 12 March 1958 at the AVRO Studios in Hilversum, the Netherlands and hosted by Dutch television presenter Hannie Lips. This marked the first time that the contest was hosted in the country of the preceding year&#x27;s winner, a tradition that has been continued ever since (with some exceptions).

Ten countries participated, equalling the number which took part the previous year; made its first appearance in the contest, while the decided not to participate.

The winner of the contest was , represented by the song &quot; performed by André Claveau, marking the first of five eventual wins for the country. Another entry however made a greater impact following the contest; the Italian entry, &quot; performed by Domenico Modugno which had placed third, became a worldwide hit for Modugno, winning two Grammy Awards in 1959 and becoming a chart success in several countries.

== Location ==

The 1958 contest took place in Hilversum, the Netherlands. The selected venue was the AVRO Studios, which served at the time as the main radio and television broadcasting facilities of the Dutch broadcaster AVRO. Often called &quot;media city&quot;, Hilversum is the principal centre for radio and television broadcasting in the Netherlands and is the location of several of the organisations that make up the (NPO) public broadcasting organisation.

Although they had won in 1957, the Netherlands&#x27; did not receive automatic rights to host the contest, as the convention in place at the time specified that each broadcaster would stage the event in turns. The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) had been the first choice to stage the event in the United Kingdom, but gave up the rights after failing to reach agreement with artistic unions. Subsequently, the Dutch broadcaster, (NTS), only received the rights to host the event after other broadcasters declined the opportunity. This established the tradition that the previous year&#x27;s winner would host it the following year.

== Participating countries ==

Ten countries participated in the 1958 contest, the same number as had featured in the previous year&#x27;s event. Sweden entered the contest for the first time, while the United Kingdom decided not to compete, despite having originally intended to participate and being listed as one of the participating countries in the original rules dated November 1957. had also intended to submit an entry, but ultimately did not feature among the participating nations.

Several of the participants had previously competed in the contest. Switzerland&#x27;s Lys Assia and the Netherlands&#x27; Corry Brokken had both represented their countries in 1956 and 1957, and were both former winners; Assia was the first winner of the contest in 1956 with the song &quot;, and had also performed Switzerland&#x27;s other entry in that contest &quot;, while Brokken had performed &quot; in the 1956 contest, one of the Netherlands&#x27; two entries, and was then the winner the following year with the song &quot;. Belgium&#x27;s Fud Leclerc had also competed in the 1956 contest, performing &quot;, one of his country&#x27;s two entries, and Margot Hielscher returned to perform for Germany for a second year in a row, having competed in 1957 with &quot;.


== Format ==

The contest was organised and broadcast by NTS, with Piet te Nuyl Jr. serving as producer, Gijs Stappershoef serving as director, and Dolf van der Linden serving as musical director, leading the during the event. Each country was allowed to nominate their own musical director to lead the orchestra during the performance of their country&#x27;s entry, with the host musical director also conducting for those countries which did not nominate their own conductor.

Held in one of the studios of the AVRO broadcasting complex, the hall contained a small stage for the singers, with the orchestra situated stage right. The rear of the performance area had interchangeable backgrounds for each song to add context to each song&#x27;s lyrics, which could also be removed to show the scoreboard during the voting sequence, and the venue was decorated with thousands of tulips.

No significant changes to the rules of the 1957 contest were implemented; each country, participating through one EBU member broadcaster, was represented by one song performed by up to two people on stage. Due to several entries having violated the duration limit in the previous event, the maximum song limit of 3 minutes and 30 seconds was more stringently enforced for this year&#x27;s entries. The voting system was the same as the one used the previous year; the results were determined through jury voting, with each country&#x27;s jury containing ten individuals who each gave one vote to their favourite song, with no abstentions allowed and with jurors unable to vote for their own country.

== Contest overview ==


The contest was held on 12 March 1958 at 21:00 (CET), with an approximate duration of 1 hour and 10 minutes. The contest was hosted by Dutch presenter Hannie Lips. A performance by the featured as the interval act between the final competing performance and the commencement of the voting results, which included a rendition of . In addition, after the first five songs, the Metropole Orkest performed the &quot;Wedding Dance&quot; from the Symphonic Suite &quot;Hasseneh&quot; by as an interval act to give the juries a break to deliberate.

During the live transmission of the contest several countries were unable to see or hear the Italian entry, which was the first act to perform, due to a technical fault, and it was subsequently allowed to perform again after the last song.

The winner was represented by the song &quot;, composed by Pierre Delanoë, written by Hubert Giraud and performed by André Claveau. This was the first of an eventual five contest victories that France would go on to achieve.

The Italian entry, &quot; performed by Domenico Modugno, went on to become a worldwide success, and was one of the first Eurovision songs to achieve notability outside of the contest. Popularly known as &quot;Volare&quot;, the song went to number one in the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, as well as reaching the top 5 in singles charts in Belgium, Canada, the Netherlands and Norway, and the top 10 in the United Kingdom, and was named Record of the Year and Song of the Year at the first edition of the Grammy Awards held in May 1959. The song has been covered by several artists, including Dean Martin, Dalida and Gipsy Kings, and many new versions with lyrics in different languages have been produced. &quot;&quot; was also nominated in 2005 to compete in &quot;&quot;, a special broadcast to determine the contest&#x27;s most popular entry of its first 50 years as part of the contest&#x27;s anniversary celebrations. One of 14 entries chosen to compete, &quot;&quot; ultimately finished in second place behind &quot;Waterloo&quot;, ABBA&#x27;s winning song from the .

=== Spokespersons ===
Each participating broadcaster appointed a spokesperson who was responsible for announcing the votes for its respective country via telephone. Known spokespersons at the 1958 contest are listed below.

* Armand Lanoux
* Piet te Nuyl Jr.
* Tage Danielsson

== Detailed voting results ==
The announcement of the results from each country was conducted in reverse order to the order in which each country performed.

== Broadcasts ==

Broadcasters competing in the event were required to relay the contest via its networks; non-participating EBU member broadcasters were also able to relay the contest. Broadcasters were able to send commentators to provide coverage of the contest in their own native language and to relay information about the artists and songs to their television viewers. Known details on the broadcasts in each country, including the specific broadcasting stations and commentators are shown in the tables below.

No official accounts of the viewing figures are known to exist. In his introductory remarks, the Dutch commentator stated that a total number of &quot;about 25 million viewers&quot; across Europe could be estimated.

<doc id="149696" wikidata="Q5500764" url="?curid=149696" title="Freedom of religion in Georgia (country)">
<text>Freedom of religions in Georgia is provided for by the country&#x27;s constitution, laws, and policies. In practice, the Georgian government generally respects religious freedom; however, the Georgian Orthodox Church enjoys a privileged status in terms of legal and tax matters, involvement in public schools, and property disputes. There have been efforts by private citizens, local government officials, and local Georgian Orthodox Church leaders to harass and persecute members of minority religious groups and interfere with their worship activities; despite calls for tolerance and respect for pluralism by government leaders, the Georgian central government has not been successful in preventing such incidents.

In 2023, the country was scored 2 out of 4 for religious freedom. It was noted that religious minorities have reported discrimination and that members of the clergy have been surveilled by the SSS.

==History==
Christianity has been the predominant religious influence in the territory comprising present-day Georgia since at least the fourth century A.D., when Nino of Cappadocia, the daughter of a Roman general, is said to have preached in Kartli (present-day eastern and southern Georgia; also known as Iberia) and to have been responsible for the conversion of the king and queen and their family. Christianity in Kartli was initially organized under the jurisdiction of the Church of Antioch, but in the late 5th century, a catholicos (chief bishop) was appointed for the city of Mtskheta, giving the church in the kingdom a degree of local autonomy. A united Georgian kingdom - comprising both Kartli and Colchis (present-day western Georgia) - had taken shape by 1008 under Bagrat III. In 1010, the church in the unified Kingdom of Georgia became autocephalous (self-governing), and its catholicos (Melchizedek I) was elevated to the rank of patriarch and obtained the official title of Catholicos-Patriarch of All Georgia.
From the 13th through the 18th centuries, Georgia was invaded numerous times by Mongols, Ottomans (Turks), and Safavids (Persians), and the Kingdom of Georgia became fragmented by the end of the 15th century. A notable Christian martyr of this period was Ketevan of Mukhrani, a queen who was tortured to death in 1624 after refusing demands by the Safavid ruler (Abbas I) to renounce Christianity and convert to Islam.

In 1801, the kingdoms of present-day eastern and central Georgia were occupied and annexed by the Russian Empire. The Russian authorities abolished the independent status of the Georgian church and made the region subject to the Russian Orthodox Church; the use of the Georgian language in the liturgy was suppressed, and many church buildings in Georgia were defaced and fell into disrepair. The Georgian Orthodox Church (GOC) reasserted its autocephaly after the overthrow of Tsar Nicholas II in 1917, but the Georgian church was subjected to renewed harassment in the 1920s and 1930s by the newly created Soviet Union, during the rule of the Georgian-born Soviet leader, Joseph Stalin.
As part of Stalin&#x27;s efforts to unite the Soviet citizenry against the Nazi threat during World War II, state-sponsored persecution of religion was somewhat eased, and the GOC&#x27;s independence from the Russian church was once again formally recognized in 1943. Restrictions on religious organizations returned after the end of the war, and the general corruption which plagued the leadership of the Georgian SSR in the early 1970s affected church officials in Georgia. When Ilia II became patriarch of the GOC in 1977, he moved to rejuvenate the church, directing the renovation of derelict churches, as well as construction of new churches. The GOC joined the World Council of Churches (WCC) in 1962, and Ilia II served as president of the WCC between 1979 and 1983.

The GOC&#x27;s power and prestige in Georgian society increased significantly after Ilia II&#x27;s installation as patriarch in 1977. In 1990, the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople (the &quot;first among equals&quot; of the Eastern Orthodox prelates) formally recognized the autocephaly of the GOC and affirmed Ilia II&#x27;s title of Catholicos-Patriarch of All Georgia.

== Law and policy==
Article 9 of the current Constitution of Georgia provides for complete freedom of belief and religion. It also recognizes the &quot;special role ... in the history of Georgia&quot; of the Georgian Orthodox Church, but stipulates that the GOC shall be independent of the state. A special Concordat (legal agreement) between the Georgian state and the GOC was ratified in 2002, giving the GOC a special legal status and rights not given to other religious groups - including legal immunity for the Georgian Orthodox Patriarch, exemption from military service for GOC clergy, and a consultative role in education and other aspects of the government.

In 2003, an effort by the Roman Catholic Church to negotiate its own concordat with Georgia failed after the government yielded to pressure from the GOC leadership and public demonstrations said to have been organized by the GOC. In July 2011, the Georgian parliament enacted legislation allowing religious organizations to register as &quot;legal entities of public law&quot;, a status closer to that held by the GOC; the leadership of the GOC criticized this proposed law and made an unsuccessful effort to influence the parliament not to adopt it, predicting that &quot;the law will cause negative consequences soon, and the state will be responsible for it&quot;. Prior to this 2011 change, religious groups other than the GOC had only been allowed to register as &quot;noncommercial legal entities of private law&quot; - a status (similar to that of a charitable foundation or an NGO) which some churches considered unacceptable and refused to apply for. Public debate over the new law included concerns that the Armenian Apostolic Church (AAC) would use the new, improved status to renew challenges over the ownership of numerous churches claimed by both the GOC and the AAC.

Many churches other than the GOC have experienced difficulty in their attempts to regain property which was confiscated during the Soviet-era crackdown on religion - especially in cases where property disputes involved conflicting claims by the GOC and other religious groups. During 2012, Roman Catholic and Armenian Apostolic church officials suggested that Georgian government officials involved in resolving property disputes were fearful of offending Orthodox constituents if they ruled in favor of other churches and against the GOC. Cases were also reported in 2012 of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses being denied alternatives to military service (which they had refused to perform on grounds of conscience); of Seventh-day Adventists being refused alternative dates for school examinations scheduled for Saturday; and Muslims and Jews being denied worship facilities or faith-specific dietary accommodations in prisons.

In 2012, Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili made public statements recognizing the religious contributions of Roman Catholics, Armenian Apostolics, and Azeri Muslims, saying that he was &quot;proud that we are making a unified state where representatives of all cultures, confessions, and ethnicity feel themselves as equal children of the country&quot;. Later in the same year, newly elected prime minister Bidzina Ivanishvili met with Jewish groups, celebrating Shabbat and Hanukkah and stating that he was &quot;committed to making Georgia a place where all Georgians, regardless of their faith, are treated equally and with respect&quot;.

During the 2024 Georgian parliamentary election the Georgian Dream announced the prospect of a constitutional amendment designating Orthodox Christianity as the state religion. The ruling party branded this initiative as part of their commitment to uphold &quot;national values and traditions,&quot; in line with their campaign promises to ban &quot;LGBT propaganda&quot; and reinforce the role of the Church. 

In contrast, the Georgian Orthodox Church has expressed skepticism, fearing that such a change could compromise its independence and increase government control. High-ranking clergy members, including Metropolitan Shio Mujiri and Metropolitan Nikoloz Pachuashvili, have raised concerns about the potential implications of this proposal, arguing that it could alter the traditionally independent yet cooperative relationship between the state and the Church established by the 2002 Concordat.
===Abkhazia===

The disputed region of Abkhazia is claimed by Georgia as part of its sovereign territory, but it has been entirely outside Georgia&#x27;s effective control (and ruled instead by a &quot;de facto&quot; separatist government) since the early 1990s. Following the 2008 Russia-Georgia war, Abkhazia gained formal recognition as an independent state by Russia and a small number of other nations, though the United Nations (UN) and most of the international community still consider it to be part of Georgia. As a consequence of a 1992-1993 war with Georgia, most ethnic Georgians originally living in Abkhazia were either expelled or killed.

Approximately 60% of Abkhazians identify themselves as Christians - most being either Eastern Orthodox or Armenian Apostolic adherents. The GOC has lost effective control over church operations in Abkhazia, and the organizational vacuum has been filled by a new Abkhazian Orthodox Church, which is recognized by the government of Abkhazia, but not by the GOC or the Russian Orthodox Church, which still consider the church in Abkhazia to be under the jurisdiction of the GOC. The GOC is not able to travel to Abkhazia and few GOC worshippers in Abkhazia are able to travel to Tbilisi as only a few ethnic Georgians had passports issued by the Abkhazia authorities.

Roman Catholics, Baptists, and Lutherans have been allowed to operate in Abkhazia. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses are officially banned, although they are allowed to assemble in Akhalgori.

The disputed region of Tskhinvali is also claimed by Georgia, but much of South Ossetia came under the &quot;de facto&quot; control of a separatist government following a 1991-1992 war. Georgia&#x27;s 2008 war with Russia left the territory completely under separatist control, and South Ossetia has subsequently been recognized as an independent state by Russia and a small number of other nations, but not by the UN or most of the international community.

Both Orthodox churches formally recognise the Orthodox churches in South Ossetia as belonging to the GOC; GOC representatives have reported that de facto authorities in South Ossetia continued to pressure the local GOC to merge with the ROC. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses in the area are not officially recognized.

==Societal attitudes==
The overwhelming majority of the modern Georgian population identifies with the Georgian Orthodox Church (GOC) - between 83 and 86 percent of the population, according to various polls. Muslims represent 9-10% of the population, and adherents of the Armenian Apostolic Church comprise about 4%. There are also much smaller numbers of followers of various other religions, including Roman Catholics, Jews, and numerous non-traditional recent arrivals to Georgia (such as Baptists, Pentecostalists, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, Seventh-day Adventists, and Latter-day Saints). Religious affiliation is strongly correlated with ethnicity, with most ethnic Georgians affiliating with the GOC. In 2012, about 45% of the Georgian population attended some sort of religious services at least once a month.

Minority religious groups are viewed by some Georgians as a threat to Georgian national identity, cultural values, and the GOC. Between 1999 and 2002, followers of a defrocked former GOC priest, Basil Mkalavishvili, attacked congregations of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses and Baptists in Tbilisi. In 2011, eight members of Orthodox fundamentalist groups were sentenced to prison for breaking into a television station and assaulting participants on a talk show on religious freedom; however, after the October 2012 parliamentary election and the transition to a new government, these individuals were reclassified as &quot;prisoners of conscience&quot; and were freed as part of a general amnesty. Across the country, there were 98 instances of religiously intolerant statements in the press in 2022 (mostly anti-Muslim), compared with 117 in 2021. 

During 2012, some congregations of Muslims and Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses reported physical confrontations and verbal threats, some involving local GOC priests and their parishioners. In 2021, Jehovah’s Witnesses reported six criminal incidents against the group; in 2022, there were nine reported incidents. 

In September 2013, Patriarch Ilia II - delivering his Sunday sermon in the Holy Trinity Cathedral of Tbilisi - said that although &quot;rights are good and are needed and rights should be protected&quot;, it was less often recognized that &quot;the majority too has to be protected&quot;, and that &quot;often the majority is more oppressed than the minority&quot;.

=== Muslims ===
Ethnic Azeris, most of whom are Muslim, form the majority of the population in the southeastern Georgian region of Kvemo Kartli. Other Muslim groups include ethnic Georgians in Adjara (an autonomous region in the southwestern part of the country) and Chechens in the northeast.

In November 2012, Muslims in a western Georgian community were prevented from gathering for prayer by Orthodox priests and townspeople; the local priest said that the local residents &quot;would not allow any minarets and mass prayers in this village&quot;, and the police did not intervene. In July 2013, Muslims in an eastern Georgian village had their services disrupted in spite of efforts at conciliation by government officials and a personal plea for tolerance by Patriarch Ilia II, head of the GOC, who denounced oppression of Muslims and said he himself had grown up in a household that included observant Muslims.

In August 2013, government authorities disassembled and removed a 24-metre (79-foot) minaret from a mosque in Chela (a village in southwestern Georgia) after objections were raised by members of the surrounding community. The minaret&#x27;s confiscation was reportedly prompted by claims that the metal from which it was formed may not have been properly declared for customs purposes when it was imported from Turkey. Amidst protests against the action by Muslim residents of the village, police reportedly beat six residents and arrested eleven. Unlike in some other communities with a mixture of Muslim and Orthodox residents, there had not been any protests against the mosque or its minaret by residents of Chela. The minaret was eventually returned to the mosque and was reinstalled in late November 2013.

==Other controversies==

===&quot;Best Georgians&quot; television program===
A controversy arose in January 2009 over a Georgian Public Broadcaster (GPB) television program, &quot;Sakartvelos Didi Ateuli&quot; (; &quot;Georgia&#x27;s Great Ten&quot;, or &quot;Best Georgians&quot;) - a show which invited viewers to pick Georgia&#x27;s top historical personages through polling by telephone, text messaging, and a special web site (www.bestgeorgians.ge). The list of contenders included over a dozen individuals who are recognized as saints by the Georgian Orthodox Church (including, for example, King David the Builder); officials of the church publicly objected to the inclusion of both religious and secular figures in the competition, as well as to the idea of having viewers put saints in rank order.

On 16 January 2009, the regular airing of &quot;Didi Ateuli&quot; was replaced by a debate between church representatives, their supporters, and opponents of the church&#x27;s position. During the show, the chairman of the GPB board of trustees, Levan Gakheladze, announced that a divided board had voted to suspend the show pending further consideration. Comments from trustees and critics revealed deep divisions between supporters and opponents of the church&#x27;s stance - some decrying church interference, others saying they could not ignore insistences from church leaders, and one board member stating that &quot;The opinion of the Patriarch [Ilia II] is more important for me than the law.&quot;

On 22 January, GPB announced that &quot;Didi Ateuli&quot; would proceed, with both saints and secular figures retained in the competition, but that the final list of ten would not be ranked but would be announced in alphabetical order. A statement released by the GOC attempted to downplay the controversy as &quot;artificial&quot;, suggesting that &quot;someone wants to portray the Church as a censor&quot; in order to dissuade church officials from speaking out on future issues.

===&quot;Father Hemorrhoids&quot; videos===
In the autumn of 2009 there were street demonstrations and other signs of public anger after it was discovered that Tea Tutberidze, a former activist in the Kmara protest group at the time of the Rose Revolution and now a leading figure in the conservative Liberty Institute, had been distributing videos that insulted Patriarch Ilia II. Tutberidze did not claim to have made the videos—they were published by an unknown &quot;Father Hemorrhoids&quot; (, &quot;mama buasili&quot;; a rude pun on the common Georgian man&#x27;s name Basili) - but she had promoted them via her Facebook page. The Ministry of Internal Affairs arrested two people over the videos but later admitted there was no crime. Tutberidze remained defiant and later accused the church of co-operation with the KGB under Soviet rule.

===Violence at Kavkasia TV studio===
On 7 May 2010, a live televised talk show on Kavkasia TV, involving leaders of hardline Orthodox Christian groups and their opponents, degenerated into name-calling and eventually broke down entirely after the participants decided to quit the debate and left the studio. After an unusually long commercial break, the host of the program announced that a fistfight between the opposing sides had occurred outside the studio. Some minutes later, several members of one of the hardline Orthodox groups - including priests - entered the studio and accused the program&#x27;s host of having staged a provocation. Police arrived and arrested several people. One opposition politician in the studio suggested that the hardline groups &quot;would not have dared to do things like this without having support of the authorities&quot;; a member of one of the Orthodox groups, on the other hand, accused the Liberty Institute (a government-aligned think tank) of &quot;promoting anti-religious ideology&quot;. The people arrested in this incident were later released from prison following a resolution by the Georgian parliament in January 2013 which declared them and many others to be political prisoners.
===Anti-homosexuality violence===

On 17 May 2013, a rally marking the International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia and Transphobia was held in downtown Tbilisi. Despite the presence of over 2,000 police officers, participants in the event were attacked by thousands of counter-demonstrators - including GOC clergy - who broke through the police lines. Priests and members of the GOC, communicating via social networks, had protested the planned event and had announced plans to prevent it from taking place.

Debate over the incident extended beyond LGBT rights and grew into a broader discussion about the role of the GOC in Georgian society. On 24 May, several hundred demonstrators gathered in a downtown Tbilisi park with banners reading &quot;No to Theocracy&quot; and &quot;No to Darkness&quot;; a parallel counter-demonstration carried a banner calling for a ban on &quot;propaganda of sexual wrongness and indecency&quot;.

Two priests of the GOC were amongst those arrested in connection with the attack on the 17 May rally. Charges against one of these were later dropped after the Tbilisi city court ruled that there was not enough evidence to prove his guilt.

Patriarch Ilia II, who had released a statement on 16 May calling on authorities to cancel the rally, criticized the gay rights movement and said homosexuality was a sin and &quot;should not be propagandized&quot;. However, after the events of 17 May, the patriarch sought to distance himself and the GOC from the violence, said that priests opposing the demonstration had behaved &quot;impolitely&quot;, and appealed for calm. The chairman of the Georgian parliament, Davit Usupashvili, suggested that Ilia II&#x27;s call for authorities to ban the rally had served as encouragement to the counter-demonstrators.

Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili and prime minister Bidzina Ivanishvili denounced the violence against the anti-homophobia rally. Ivanishvili said that the incident was neither Georgian nor Christian in character, that the authorities would bring to justice those &quot;who were calling for violence and those resorting to violence&quot;, and that any member of the clergy who violated the law should be &quot;held responsible before the law like any other citizen&quot;. Saakashvili said the 17 May violence showed that the Georgian state was facing a &quot;threat of theocracy&quot;, but that Georgia would never have a &quot;broad problem of religious fundamentalism&quot; and that &quot;not a single institution, including the Orthodox Church, is interested in violence&quot;.

<text>The Boeing 737 is an American narrow-body aircraft produced by Boeing at its Renton factory in Washington.

Developed to supplement the Boeing 727 on short and thin routes, the twinjet retained the 707 fuselage width and six abreast seating but with two underwing Pratt &amp; Whitney JT8D low-bypass turbofan engines. Envisioned in 1964, the initial 737-100 made its first flight in April 1967 and entered service in February 1968 with Lufthansa.
The lengthened 737-200 entered service in April 1968, and evolved through four generations, offering several variants for 85 to 215 passengers.
The First Generation 737-100/200 variants were powered by Pratt &amp; Whitney JT8D low-bypass turbofan engines and offered seating for 85 to 130 passengers. Launched in 1980 and introduced in 1984, the Second Generation 737 Classic -300/400/500 variants were upgraded with more fuel-efficient CFM56-3 high-bypass turbofans and offered 110 to 168 seats. Introduced in 1997, the Third Generation 737 Next Generation (NG) -600/700/800/900 variants have updated CFM56-7 high-bypass turbofans, a larger wing and an upgraded glass cockpit, and seat 108 to 215 passengers. The latest, and Fourth Generation, the 737 MAX -7/8/9/10 variants, powered by improved CFM LEAP-1B high-bypass turbofans and accommodating 138 to 204 people, entered service in 2017.

Boeing Business Jet versions have been produced since the 737NG, as well as military models.
, 16,737 Boeing 737s have been ordered and 11,965 delivered. It was the highest-selling commercial aircraft until being surpassed by the competing Airbus A320 family in October 2019, but maintains the record in total deliveries. Initially, its main competitor was the McDonnell Douglas DC-9, followed by its MD-80/MD-90 derivatives. In 2013, the global 737 fleet had completed more than 184 million flights over 264 million block hours since its entry into service. The 737 MAX, designed to compete with the A320neo, was grounded worldwide between March 2019 and November 2020 following two fatal crashes.

== Development ==
=== Initial design ===

Boeing had been studying short-haul jet aircraft designs, and saw a need for a new aircraft to supplement the 727 on short and thin routes. Preliminary design work began on May 11, 1964, based on research that indicated a market for a fifty to sixty passenger airliner flying routes of .

The initial concept featured podded engines on the aft fuselage, a T-tail as with the 727, and five-abreast seating. Engineer Joe Sutter relocated the engines to the wings which lightened the structure and simplified the accommodation of six-abreast seating in the fuselage. The engine nacelles were mounted directly to the underside of the wings, without pylons, allowing the landing gear to be shortened, thus lowering the fuselage to improve baggage and passenger access. Relocating the engines from the aft fuselage also allowed the horizontal stabilizer to be attached to the aft fuselage instead of as a T-tail. Many designs for the engine attachment strut were tested in the wind tunnel and the optimal shape for high speed was found to be one which was relatively thick, filling the narrow channels formed between the wing and the top of the nacelle, particularly on the outboard side.

At the time, Boeing was far behind its competitors; the SE 210 Caravelle had been in service since 1955, and the BAC One-Eleven (BAC-111), Douglas DC-9, and Fokker F28 were already into flight certification. To expedite development, Boeing used 60% of the structure and systems of the existing 727, particularly the fuselage, which differs in length only. This 148-inch (3.76 m) wide fuselage cross-section permitted six-abreast seating compared to the rivals&#x27; five-abreast. The 727&#x27;s fuselage was derived from the 707.

The proposed wing airfoil sections were based on those of the 707 and 727, but somewhat thicker; altering these sections near the nacelles achieved a substantial drag reduction at high Mach numbers. The engine chosen was the Pratt &amp; Whitney JT8D-1 low-bypass ratio turbofan engine, delivering of thrust.

The concept design was presented in October 1964 at the Air Transport Association maintenance and engineering conference by chief project engineer Jack Steiner, where its elaborate high-lift devices raised concerns about maintenance costs and dispatch reliability.

=== Major design developments ===
The original 737 continued to be developed into thirteen passenger, cargo, corporate and military variants. These were later divided into what has become known as the four generations of the Boeing 737 family:
* The first generation &quot;Original&quot; series: the 737-100 and -200, also the military T-43 and CT-43, launched February 1965.
* The second generation &quot;Classic&quot; series: 737-300, -400 and -500, launched in 1979.
* The third generation &quot;Next Generation&quot; series: 737-600, -700, -800 and -900, also the military C-40 and P-8, launched late 1993.
* The fourth generation 737 MAX series: 737-7, -8, -9 and -10, launched August 2011.

=== Launch ===
The launch decision for the $150 million (~$ in ) development was made by the board on February 1, 1965. The sales pitch was big-jet comfort on short-haul routes.

Lufthansa became the launch customer on February 19, 1965, with an order for 21 aircraft, worth $67 million (~$ in ) after the airline had been assured by Boeing that the 737 project would not be canceled. Consultation with Lufthansa over the previous winter had resulted in the seating capacity being increased to 100.

On April 5, 1965, Boeing announced an order by United Airlines for 40 737s. United wanted a slightly larger capacity than the 737-100, so the fuselage was stretched ahead of, and behind the wing. The longer version was designated the 737-200, with the original short-body aircraft becoming the 737-100. Detailed design work continued on both variants simultaneously.

=== Introduction ===
The first -100 was rolled out on January 17, 1967, and took its maiden flight on April 9, 1967, piloted by Brien Wygle and Lew Wallick. After several test flights the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued Type Certificate A16WE certifying the 737-100 for commercial flight on December 15, 1967. It was the first aircraft to have, as part of its initial certification, approval for Category II approaches, which refers to a precision instrument approach and landing with a decision height between . Lufthansa received its first aircraft on December 28, 1967, and on February 10, 1968, became the first non-American airline to launch a new Boeing aircraft. Lufthansa was the only significant customer to purchase the 737-100 and only 30 aircraft were produced.

The -200 was rolled out on June 29, 1967, and had its maiden flight on August 8, 1967. It was then certified by the FAA on December 21, 1967. The inaugural flight for United Airlines took place on April 28, 1968, from Chicago to Grand Rapids, Michigan. The lengthened -200 was widely preferred over the -100 by airlines. The improved version, the 737-200 Advanced, was introduced into service by All Nippon Airways on May 20, 1971.

The 737 original model with its variants, known later as the &quot;Boeing 737 Original&quot;, initially competed with SE 210 Caravelle and BAC-111 due to their earlier entry into service and later primarily with the McDonnell Douglas DC-9, then its MD-80 derivatives as the three European short-haul single aisles slowly withdrew from the competition. Sales were low in the early 1970s and, after a peak of 114 deliveries in 1969, only 22 737s were shipped in 1972 with 19 in backlog. The US Air Force saved the program by ordering T-43s, which were modified Boeing 737-200s. African airline orders kept the production running until the 1978 US Airline Deregulation Act, which improved demand for six-abreast narrow-body aircraft. Demand further increased after being re-engined with the CFM56. The 737 went on to become the highest-selling commercial aircraft in terms of orders until surpassed by the competing Airbus A320 family in October 2019, but maintains the record in total deliveries.

The fuselage is manufactured in Wichita, Kansas, by Boeing spin-off company Spirit AeroSystems, before being moved by rail to Renton. The Renton factory has three assembly lines for the 737 MAX; a fourth is planned to open at the Everett factory in 2024.

== Generations and variants ==

=== 737 Original (first generation) ===

The &quot;Boeing 737 Original&quot; is the name given to the -100/200 and -200 Advanced series of the Boeing 737 family.

==== 737-100 ====

The initial model was the 737-100, the smallest variant of the 737 aircraft family, which was launched in February 1965 and entered service with Lufthansa in February 1968. In 1968, its unit cost was US$3.7M (1968), $M today. A total of 30 737-100s were ordered: 22 by Lufthansa, 5 by Malaysia–Singapore Airlines (MSA) and 2 by Avianca with the final commercial aircraft delivered to MSA on October 31, 1969. This variant was largely overshadowed by its bigger 737-200 sibling, which entered service two months later.

The original engine nacelles incorporated thrust reversers taken from the 727 outboard nacelles. They proved to be relatively ineffective and tended to lift the aircraft up off the runway when deployed. This reduced the downforce on the main wheels thereby reducing the effectiveness of the wheel brakes. In 1968, an improvement to the thrust reversal system was introduced. A 48-inch tailpipe extension was added and new target-style thrust reversers were incorporated. The thrust reverser doors were set 35 degrees away from the vertical to allow the exhaust to be deflected inboard and over the wings and outboard and under the wings. The improvement became standard on all aircraft after March 1969, and a retrofit was provided for active aircraft. Longer nacelle/wing fairings were introduced, and the airflow over the flaps and slats was improved. The production line also introduced an improvement to the flap system, allowing increased use during takeoff and landing. All these changes gave the aircraft a boost to payload and range, and improved short-field performance.

Both the first and last 737-100s became the last 737-100s in service. The first aircraft used by Boeing as prototype under registration N73700 was later ordered by and delivered to NASA on July 26, 1973, which then operated it under registration N515NA and retired after 30 years on September 27, 2003. The last 737-100 built and also the last operating was originally sold to Malaysia–Singapore Airlines: it was transferred to Air Florida before being used as a VIP aircraft by the Mexican Air Force for 23 years under registration TP-03. TP-03 would be broken up in 2006. The first 737-100, NASA 515, is on static display in the Museum of Flight in Seattle and is the last surviving example of the type.

==== 737-200 ====

The 737-200 was a 737-100 with an extended fuselage, launched by an order from United Airlines in 1965 and entered service with the launch customer in April 1968. Its unit cost was US$4.0M (1968) ($M today). The -200&#x27;s unit cost was US$5.2M (1972) ($M today). The 737-200 Advanced is an improved version of the -200, introduced into service by All Nippon Airways on May 20, 1971. After aircraft #135, the 737-200 Advanced has improved aerodynamics, automatic wheel brakes, more powerful engines, more fuel capacity, and hence a 15% increase in payload and range over the original -200s and respectively -100s. The 737-200 Advanced became the production standard in June 1971. Boeing also provided the 737-200C (Combi), which allowed for conversion between passenger and cargo use and the 737-200QC (Quick Change), which facilitated a rapid conversion between roles. The 1,114th and last delivery of a -200 series aircraft was in August 1988 to Xiamen Airlines.

Nineteen 737-200s, designated T-43, were used to train aircraft navigators for the U.S. Air Force. Some were modified into CT-43s, which are used to transport passengers, and one was modified as the NT-43A Radar Test Bed. The first was delivered on July 31, 1973, and the last on July 19, 1974. The Indonesian Air Force ordered three modified 737-200s, designated &quot;Boeing 737-2X9 Surveiller&quot;. They were used as Maritime reconnaissance (MPA)/transport aircraft, fitted with SLAMMAR (Side-looking Multi-mission Airborne Radar). The aircraft were delivered between May 1982 and October 1983.After 40 years, in March 2008, the final 737-200 aircraft in the U.S. flying scheduled passenger service were phased out, with the last flights of Aloha Airlines. As of 2018, the variant still saw regular service through North American charter operators such as Sierra Pacific Airlines.
The short-field capabilities of the 737-200 led Boeing to offer the &quot;Unpaved Strip Kit&quot; (see the Air North example, right). This option reduced foreign object damage when operated on remote, unimproved or unpaved runways, that competing jetliners could not use safely. The kit included a gravel deflector on the nose gear and a vortex dissipator extending from the front of the engine. Alaska Airlines used the gravel kit for some of its combi aircraft rural operations in Alaska until retiring its -200 fleet in 2007. Air Inuit, Nolinor Aviation and Chrono Aviation still use the gravel kit in Northern Canada.
Canadian North also operated a gravel-kitted 737-200 Combi, but this was due to be retired in early 2023.

, a relatively high number of 737-200s remain in service compared to other early jet airliners, with fifty examples actively flying for thirty carriers. During the 737 MAX groundings, older 737s, including the 200 and Classic series, were in demand for leasing. C-GNLK, one of Nolinor&#x27;s 737-200s, is the oldest jet airliner in commercial service as of 2024, having entered service 50 years prior in 1974.

=== 737 Classic (second generation) ===
The &quot;Boeing 737 Classic&quot; is the name given to the 737-300/400/500 series after the introduction of the -600/700/800/900 series of the Boeing 737 family. Produced from 1984 to 2000, a total of 1,988 Classic series were delivered.

Close to the next major upgrade of single aisle aircraft at Airbus and Boeing, the price of jet fuel reached a peak in 2008, when airlines devoted 40% of the retail price of an air ticket to pay for fuel, versus 15% in 2000. Consequently, in that year carriers retired Boeing 737 Classic aircraft to reduce fuel consumption; replacements consisted of more efficient 737 Next Generation or A320 family aircraft. On June 4, 2008, United Airlines announced it would retire all 94 of its Classic 737 aircraft (64 737-300 and 30 737-500 aircraft), replacing them with A320 family jets taken from its Ted subsidiary, which has been shut down. This intensified the competition between the two giant aircraft manufacturers, which has since become a duopoly competition.

An optional upgrade with winglets became available for the Classic and NG series.
* The 737-300 and 737-500 can be retrofitted with Aviation Partners Boeing winglets, and the 737-300 retrofitted with winglets is designated the -300SP (Special Performance).
* WestJet was to launch the 737-600 with winglets, but dropped them in 2006.

==== 737-300 ====

Development began in 1979 for the 737&#x27;s first major revision, which was originally introduced as the &#x27;new generation&#x27; of the 737. Boeing wanted to increase capacity and range, incorporating improvements to upgrade the aircraft to modern specifications, while also retaining commonality with previous 737 variants. In 1980, preliminary aircraft specifications of the variant, dubbed 737-300, were released at the Farnborough Airshow. This first major upgrade series was later renamed 737 Classic. It competed primarily with the MD-80, its later derivative the MD-90, and the newcomer Airbus A320 family.

Boeing engineer Mark Gregoire led a design team, which cooperated with CFM International to select, modify and deploy a new engine and nacelle that would make the 737-300 into a viable aircraft. They chose the CFM56-3B-1 high-bypass turbofan engine to power the aircraft, which yielded significant gains in fuel economy and a reduction in noise, but also posed an engineering challenge, given the low ground clearance of the 737 and the larger diameter of the engine over the original Pratt &amp; Whitney engines. Gregoire&#x27;s team and CFM solved the problem by reducing the size of the fan (which made the engine slightly less efficient than it had been forecast to be), placing the engine ahead of the wing, and by moving engine accessories to the sides of the engine pod, giving the engine a distinctive non-circular &quot;hamster pouch&quot; air intake. Earlier customers for the CFM56 included the U.S. Air Force with its program to re-engine KC-135 tankers.

The passenger capacity of the aircraft was increased to 149 by extending the fuselage around the wing by . The wing incorporated several changes for improved aerodynamics. The wingtip was extended , and the wingspan by . The leading-edge slats and trailing-edge flaps were adjusted. The tailfin was redesigned, the flight deck was improved with the optional EFIS (Electronic Flight Instrumentation System), and the passenger cabin incorporated improvements similar to those developed on the Boeing 757. The prototype -300, the 1,001st 737 built, first flew on February 24, 1984, with pilot Jim McRoberts. It and two production aircraft flew a nine-month-long certification program. The 737-300 retrofitted with Aviation Partners&#x27; winglets was designated the -300SP (&quot;Special Performance&quot;). The 737-300 was replaced by the 737-700 of the Next Generation series.

==== 737-400 ====
The 737-400 was launched in 1985 to fill the gap between the 737-300 and the 757-200. In June 1986, Boeing announced the development of the 737-400, which stretched the fuselage a further , increasing the capacity to 188 passengers, and requiring a tail bumper to prevent tailstrikes during take-off and a strengthened wing spar. The -400s first flight was on February 19, 1988, and, after a seven-month/500-hour flight-testing run, entered service with Piedmont Airlines that October. The last two -400s, i.e. the last 737 Classics series, were delivered to CSA Czech Airlines on February 28, 2000. The 737-400 was replaced by the 737-800 of the Next Generation series. The 737-400SF was a 737-400 converted to freighter, though it was not a model delivered by Boeing and hence the nickname &quot;Special Freighter (SF)&quot;. Alaska Airlines was the first to convert one of their 400s from regular service to an aircraft with the ability to handle 10 pallets. The airline had also converted five more into fixed combi aircraft for half passenger and freight. These 737-400 Combi aircraft were retired in 2017 and replaced by the 737-700F of the Next Generation series.

==== 737-500 ====
The 737-500 was offered as a modern and direct replacement of the 737-200. It was launched in 1987 by Southwest Airlines, with an order for 20 aircraft, and it flew for the first time on June 30, 1989. A single prototype flew 375 hours for the certification process, and on February 28, 1990, Southwest Airlines received the first delivery.

The -500 incorporated the improvements of the 737 Classic series, allowing longer routes with fewer passengers to be more economical than with the 737-300. The fuselage length of the 737-500 is longer than the 737-200, accommodating up to 140 passengers. Both glass and older-style mechanical cockpits arrangements were available. Using the CFM56-3 engine also gave a 25 percent increase in fuel efficiency over the older 737-200s P&amp;W engines.
The 737-500 has faced accelerated retirement due to its smaller size, after 21 years in service compared to 24 years for the -300. While a few 737-300s were slated for freighter conversion, no demand at all existed for a -500 freighter conversion. The 737-500 was replaced by the 737-600 of the Next Generation series, though the -600 was not as successful in total orders as the -500.

=== 737 NG (third generation) ===
The &quot;Boeing 737 Next Generation&quot;, abbreviated as &quot;737 Next Gen&quot; or &quot;737NG&quot;, is the name given to the main models 737-600/700/800/900 series and the extended range -700ER/900ER variants of the Boeing 737 family. It has been produced since 1996 and introduced in 1997, with a total order of 7,097 aircraft, of which 7,031 have been delivered . The primary goal was to re-engine the 737 with the high bypass ratio CFM56-7. By the early 1990s, as the MD-80 slowly withdrew from the competition following the introduction of the MD-90, it had become clear that the new A320 family was a serious threat to Boeing&#x27;s market share. Airbus won previously loyal 737 customers, such as Lufthansa and United Airlines. In November 1993, to stay in the single aisle competition, Boeing&#x27;s board of directors authorized the Next Generation program to mainly upgrade the 737 Classic series. In late 1993, after engineering trade studies and discussions with major customers, Boeing proceeded to launch a second derivative of the Boeing 737, the 737 Next Generation (NG) -600/700/800/900 series. It featured a redesigned wing with a wider wingspan and larger area, greater fuel capacity, longer range and higher MTOWs. It was equipped with CFM56-7 high pressure ratio engines, a glass cockpit, and upgraded interior configurations. The four main models of the series can accommodate seating for 108 to 215 passengers. It was further developed into additional versions such as the corporate Boeing Business Jet (BBJ) and military P-8 Poseidon aircraft. Following the merger between Boeing with McDonnell Douglas in 1997, the primary competitor for the 737NG series remained only the A320 family.

==== 737-600 ====
The 737-600 was the smallest of the Next-Generation models, replacing the 737-500. It had no winglets and was similar in size to the Airbus A318. Launch customer Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) placed its order in March 1995 and took the first delivery in September 1998. A total of 69 aircraft were produced, with the last one delivered to WestJet in 2006.

==== 737-700 ====

The 737-700, the first variant of the Next-Generation, was launched in November 1993 with an order of 63 aircraft. The -700 seats 126 passengers in a two-class or 149 passengers in a one-class layout. Launch customer Southwest Airlines took the first delivery in December 1997. The 737-700 replaced the 737-300 and competes with the Airbus A319.

The &quot;737-700C&quot; is a convertible version where the seats can be removed to carry cargo instead. There is a large door on the left side of the aircraft. The United States Navy was the launch customer for the 737-700C under the military designation C-40 Clipper.

The &quot;737-700ER&quot; (Extended Range) was launched on January 31, 2006, and featured the fuselage of the 737-700 and the wings and landing gear of the 737-800. A 737-700ER can typically accommodate 126 passengers in two classes with a range similar to the Airbus A319LR.

==== 737-800 ====

The 737-800 was a stretched version of the 737-700 launched on September 5, 1994, and first flew on July 31, 1997. The -800 seats 162 passengers in a two-class or 189 passengers in a high-density, one-class layout. Launch customer Hapag-Lloyd Flug (now TUIfly) received the first one in April 1998. The 737-800 replaced directly the -400 and aging 727-200 of US airlines. It filled also the gap left by Boeing&#x27;s decision to discontinue the MD-80 and MD-90 aircraft, following Boeing&#x27;s merger with McDonnell Douglas. The 737-800 is the most widely used narrowbody aircraft and competes primarily with the Airbus A320.

==== 737-900 ====
The 737-900 was launched in November 1997 and took its first flight on August 3, 2000. It is longer than the -800, but retains the MTOW, fuel capacity, and exit configuration of the -800, essentially trading range for capacity. The exit configuration limits its seat capacity to approximately 177 in a two class and 189 in a high-density, one class layout. Launch customer Alaska Airlines received the first delivery on May 2001.

The &quot;737-900ER&quot; (Extended Range), the newest and largest variant of the 737NG generation, was launched in July 2005, first flew in September 2006, and first delivered to launch customer Lion Air in April 2007. An additional pair of exit doors and a flat rear pressure bulkhead increased its seating capacity to 180 passengers in a two-class and up to 220 passengers in a one-class configuration.

The -900ER partly closed the gap left by the discontinuation of the Boeing 757-200, and directly competes with the Airbus A321.

=== 737 MAX (fourth generation) ===
The &quot;Boeing 737 MAX&quot; is the name given to the main models 737 MAX 7/8/9/10 series and the higher-density MAX 200 variant of the Boeing 737 family. It is offered in four main variants, typically offering 138 to 230 seats and a range of . The 737 MAX 7, MAX 8 (including the denser, 200-seat MAX 200), and MAX 9 replace the 737-700, -800, and -900 respectively. The further stretched 737 MAX 10 has also been added to the series. The aim was to re-engine the 737NG family using CFM LEAP-1B engines having very high bypass ratio, to compete with the Airbus A320neo family. On July 20, 2011, Boeing announced plans for a third major upgrade and respectively fourth generation of 737 series to be powered by the CFM LEAP-1B engine, with American Airlines intending to order 100 of these aircraft.

On August 30, 2011, Boeing confirmed the launch of the 737 new engine variant, to be called the Boeing 737 MAX. It was based on earlier 737 designs with more efficient LEAP-1B power plants, aerodynamic improvements (most notably split-tip winglets), and airframe modifications. It competes with the Airbus A320neo family that was launched in December 2010 and reached 1,029 orders by June 2011, breaking Boeing&#x27;s monopoly with American Airlines, which had an order for 130 A320neos that July. The 737 MAX had its first flight on January 29, 2016, and gained FAA certification on March 8, 2017. The first delivery was a MAX 8 on May 6, 2017, to Lion Air&#x27;s subsidiary Malindo Air, which put it into service on May 22, 2017. , the series has received 5,011 firm orders.

In March 2019, civil aviation authorities around the world grounded the 737 MAX following two hull loss crashes which caused 346 deaths. On December 16, 2019, Boeing announced that it would suspend production of the 737 MAX from January 2020, which was resumed in May 2020. In the midyear 2020, the FAA and Boeing conducted a series of recertification test flights. On November 18, 2020, the FAA cleared the MAX to return to service. Before the aircraft can fly again, repairs must be implemented and airlines&#x27; training programs must be approved. Passenger flights in the U.S. are expected to resume before the end of the year. Worldwide, the first airline to resume passenger service was Brazilian low-cost Gol, on December 9, 2020.

==== 737 MAX 7 ====

The 737 MAX 7, a shortened variant of the MAX 8, was originally based on the 737-700, flying farther and accommodating two more seat rows at 18% lower fuel costs per seat. The redesign uses the 737-8 wing and landing gear; a pair of over-wing exits rather than the single-door configuration; a aft fuselage and a longer forward fuselage; structural re-gauging and strengthening; and systems and interior modifications to accommodate the longer length. Entry into service with launch operator Southwest Airlines was originally expected in January 2019, but certification delays have pushed this back, with Boeing CEO David Calhoun saying certification was possible in the first half of 2025. The 737 MAX 7 replaced the 737-700 and was predicted to carry 12 more passengers and fly farther than the competing Airbus A319neo with 7% lower operating costs per seat.

==== 737 MAX 8 ====
The 737 MAX 8, the first variant of the 737 MAX, has a longer fuselage than the MAX 7. On July 23, 2013, Boeing completed the firm configuration for the 737 MAX 8. Its first commercial flight was operated by Malindo Air on May 22, 2017. The MAX 8 replaced the 737-800 and competed with the A320neo.

The &quot;737 MAX 200&quot;, a high-density version of the 737 MAX 8, was launched in September 2014 and named for seating for up to 200 passengers in a single-class layout with slimline seats requiring an extra pair of exit doors. The MAX 200 would be 20% more cost-efficient per seat, including 5% lower operating costs than the MAX 8 and would be the most efficient narrow-body on the market when entering service. In mid-November 2018, the first MAX 200 of the 135 ordered by Ryanair rolled out, in a 197-seat configuration. It was first flown from Renton on January 13, 2019, and was due to enter service in April 2019.

==== 737 MAX 9 ====
The 737 MAX 9, the stretched variant of the MAX 8, was launched with an order of 201 aircraft in February 2012. It made its roll-out on March 7, 2017, and first flight on April 13, 2017; It was certified by February 2018. The launch customer, Lion Air Group, took the first MAX 9 on March 21, 2018, before entering service with Thai Lion Air. The 737 MAX 9 replaced the 737-900 and competes with the Airbus A321neo.

==== 737 MAX 10 ====
The 737 MAX 10 was proposed as a stretched MAX 9 in mid-2016, enabling seating for 230 in a single class or 189 in two-class layout, compared to 193 in two-class seating for the A321neo. The modest stretch of fuselage enables the MAX 10 to retain the existing wing and CFM Leap 1B engine from the MAX 9 with a trailing-link main landing gear as the only major change. The MAX 10 was launched on June 19, 2017, with 240 orders and commitments from more than ten customers. The variant configuration with a predicted 5% lower trip cost and seat cost compared to the A321neo was firmed up by February 2018, and by mid-2018, the critical design review was completed. The MAX 10 has a similar capacity to the A321XLR, but shorter range and much poorer field performance in smaller airports. It was unveiled in Boeing&#x27;s Renton factory on November 22, 2019, and first flew on June 18, 2021. The MAX 10 is still awaiting certification, with Boeing CEO David Calhoun saying in July 2024 that the MAX 10 could be certified in the first half of 2025.

In the late 2010s, Boeing worked on a medium-range Boeing New Midsize Airplane (NMA) with two variants seating 225 or 275 passengers and targeting the same market segment as the 737 MAX 10 and the Airbus A321neo. A Future Small Airplane (FSA) was also touted during this period. The NMA project was set aside in January 2020, as Boeing focused on returning the 737 MAX to service and announced that it would be taking a new approach to future projects.

The 737 continued to evolve into many variants but still remains recognizable as the 737. These are divided into four generations but all are based on the same basic design.

=== Airframe ===
The fuselage cross section and nose are derived from that of the Boeing 707 and Boeing 727. Early 737 cockpits also inherited the &quot;eyebrow windows&quot; positioned above the main glareshield, which were a feature of the original 707 and 727 to allow for better crew visibility. Contrary to popular belief, these windows were not intended for celestial navigation (only the military T-43A had a sextant port for star navigation, which the civilian models lacked.) With modern avionics, the windows became redundant, and many pilots placed newspapers or other objects in them to block out sun glare. They were eliminated from the 737 cockpit design in 2004, although they are still installed on customer request. The eyebrow windows were sometimes removed and plugged, usually during maintenance overhauls, and can be distinguished by the metal plug which differs from the smooth metal in later aircraft that were not originally fitted with the windows.

The 737 was designed to sit relatively low to the ground to accommodate the design of smaller airports in the late 1960s which often lacked jetbridges or motorized belt loaders. The low fuselage allowed passengers to easily board from a mobile stairway or airstairs (which are still available as an option on the 737 MAX) and for luggage to be hand-lifted into the cargo holds. However, the design has proved to be an issue as the 737 has been modernized with larger and more fuel efficient engines.

The 737&#x27;s main landing gear, under the wings at mid-cabin, rotates into wheel wells in the aircraft&#x27;s belly. The legs are covered by partial doors, and &quot;brush-like&quot; seals aerodynamically smooth (or &quot;fair&quot;) the wheels in the wells. The sides of the tires are exposed to the air in flight. &quot;Hub caps&quot; complete the aerodynamic profile of the wheels. It is forbidden to operate without the caps, because they are linked to the ground speed sensor that interfaces with the anti-skid brake system. The dark circles of the tires are clearly visible when a 737 takes off, or is at low altitude.

From July 2008, the steel landing gear brakes on new NGs were replaced by Messier-Bugatti carbon brakes, achieving weight savings to depending on whether standard or high-capacity brakes were equipped. On a 737-800 this gives a 0.5% improvement in fuel efficiency.

737s are not equipped with fuel dump systems. The original design was too small to require this, and adding a fuel dump system to the later, larger variants would have incurred a large weight penalty. Boeing instead demonstrated an &quot;equivalent level of safety&quot;. Depending on the nature of the emergency, 737s either circle to burn off fuel or land overweight. If the latter is the case, the aircraft is inspected by maintenance personnel for damage and then returned to service if none is found.

=== Engines ===
Engines on the 737 Classic series (-300, -400, -500) and Next-Generation series (-600, -700, -800, -900) do not have circular inlets like most aircraft but rather a planform on the lower side, which has been dictated largely by the need to accommodate ever larger engine diameters. The 737 Classic series featured CFM56 high bypass turbofan engines, which were 25% more efficient and also reduced noise significantly over JT8D low bypass engines used on the 737 Original series (-100 and -200), but also posed an engineering challenge given the low ground clearance of the Boeing 737 family. Boeing and engine supplier CFM International (CFMI) solved the problem by placing the engine ahead of (rather than below) the wing, and by moving engine accessories to the sides (rather than the bottom) of the engine pod, giving the 737 Classic and later generations a distinctive non-circular air intake.

The improved, higher pressure ratio CFM56-7 turbofan engine on the 737 Next Generation is 7% more fuel-efficient than the previous CFM56-3 on the 737 Classic with the same bypass ratio. The newest 737 variants, the 737 MAX series, feature LEAP-1B engines from CFMI with a fan diameter. These engines were expected to be 10-12% more efficient than the CFM56-7B engines on the 737 Next Generation series.
=== Flight systems ===
The 737 uses a hydro-mechanical flight control system, similar to the Boeing 707 and typical of the period in which the 737 was originally designed. Pilot commands are transmitted to hydraulic boosters attached to the control surfaces via steel cables that run through the fuselage and wings, rather than by the electrical fly-by-wire systems found in more recent designs like the Airbus A320 or Boeing 777.

The primary flight controls have mechanical backups. In the event of total hydraulic system failure or double engine failure, they will automatically revert to control via servo tab. In this mode, termed &quot;manual reversion&quot;, the servo tabs aerodynamically control the elevators and ailerons; these servo tabs are in turn controlled by cables running to the control yoke. The pilot&#x27;s muscle forces alone control the tabs.

The 737 Next Generation series introduced a six-screen LCD glass cockpit with modern avionics but designed to retain crew commonality with previous 737 generations.
The 737 MAX introduced a 4 15.1 inch landscape LCD screen cockpit manufactured by Rockwell Collins derived from the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Except for the spoilers, which are fly-by-wire controlled, and all the analog instruments, which became digital, everything else is similar to the cockpits of the previous 737 generations to maintain commonality.

=== Aerodynamics ===
The Original -100 and -200 series were built without wingtip devices, but these were later introduced to improve fuel efficiency. The 737 has evolved four winglet types: the 737-200 Mini-winglet, 737 Classic/NG Blended Winglet, 737 Split Scimitar Winglet, and 737 MAX Advanced Technology Winglet. The 737-200 Mini-winglets are part of the Quiet Wing Corp modification kit that received certification in 2005.

Blended winglets were standard on the 737 NG since 2000 and are available for retrofit on 737 Classic models. These winglets stand approximately tall and are installed at the wing tips. They improve fuel efficiency by up to 5% through lift-induced drag reduction achieved by moderating wingtip vortices.

Split Scimitar winglets became available in 2014 for the 737-800, 737-900ER, BBJ2 and BBJ3, and in 2015 for the 737-700, 737-900 and BBJ1. Split Scimitar winglets were developed by Aviation Partners, the same Seattle-based corporation that developed the blended winglets; the Split Scimitar winglets produce up to a 5.5% fuel savings per aircraft compared to 3.3% savings for the blended winglets. Southwest Airlines flew their first flight of a 737-800 with Split Scimitar winglets on April 14, 2014. The next generation 737, 737 MAX, will feature an Advanced Technology (AT) Winglet that is produced by Boeing. The Boeing AT Winglet resembles a cross between the Blended Winglet and the Split Scimitar Winglet.

An optional Enhanced Short Runway Package was developed for use on short runways.

=== Interior ===
The first generation Original series 737 cabin was replaced for the second generation Classic series with a design based on the Boeing 757 cabin. The Classic cabin was then redesigned once more for the third, Next Generation, 737 with a design based on the Boeing 777 cabin. Boeing later offered the redesigned Sky Interior on the NG. The principal features of the Sky Interior include sculpted sidewalls, redesigned window housings, increased headroom and LED mood lighting, larger pivot-bins based on the 777 and 787 designs and generally more luggage space, and claims to have improved cabin noise levels by 2–4 dB. The first 737 equipped Boeing Sky Interior was delivered to Flydubai in late 2010. Continental Airlines, Alaska Airlines, Malaysia Airlines, and TUIFly have also received Sky Interior-equipped 737s.

== Other variants ==

=== 737 AEW&amp;C ===

The Boeing 737 AEW&amp;C is a 737-700IGW roughly similar to the 737-700ER. This is an Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&amp;C) version of the 737NG. Australia is the first customer (as Project Wedgetail), followed by Turkey and South Korea.

=== T-43/CT-43A ===
The T-43 was a 737-200 modified for use by the United States Air Force for training navigators, now known as USAF combat systems officers. Informally referred to as the &quot;Gator&quot; (an abbreviation of &quot;navigator&quot;) and &quot;Flying Classroom&quot;, nineteen of these aircraft were delivered to the Air Training Command at Mather AFB, California during 1973 and 1974. Two additional aircraft were delivered to the Colorado Air National Guard at Buckley ANGB (later Buckley AFB) and Peterson AFB, Colorado, in direct support of cadet air navigation training at the nearby U.S. Air Force Academy.

Two T-43s were later converted to CT-43As, similar to the CT-40A Clipper below, in the early 1990s and transferred to Air Mobility Command and United States Air Forces in Europe, respectively, as executive transports. A third aircraft was also transferred to Air Force Materiel Command for use as a radar test bed aircraft and was redesignated as an NT-43A. The T-43 was retired by the Air Education and Training Command in 2010 after 37 years of service.

=== C-40 Clipper ===

The Boeing C-40 Clipper is a military version of the 737-700C NG. It is used by both the United States Navy and the United States Air Force, and has been ordered by the United States Marine Corps. Technically, only the Navy C-40A variant is named &quot;Clipper&quot;, whereas the USAF C-40B/C variants are officially unnamed.

=== P-8 Poseidon ===

The P-8 Poseidon developed for the United States Navy by Boeing Defense, Space &amp; Security, based on the Next Generation 737-800ERX. The P-8 can be operated in the anti-submarine warfare (ASW), anti-surface warfare (ASUW), and shipping interdiction roles. It is armed with torpedoes, Harpoon anti-ship missiles and other weapons, and is able to drop and monitor sonobuoys, as well as operate in conjunction with other assets such as the Northrop Grumman MQ-4C Triton maritime surveillance unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).

=== Boeing Business Jet (BBJ) ===

In the late 1980s, Boeing marketed the 77-33 jet, a business jet version of the 737-300. The name was short-lived. After the introduction of the Next Generation series, Boeing introduced the Boeing Business Jet (BBJ) series. The BBJ1 was similar in dimensions to the 737-700 but had additional features, including stronger wings and landing gear from the 737-800, and had increased range over the other 737 models through the use of extra fuel tanks. The first BBJ rolled out on August 11, 1998, and flew for the first time on September 4.

On October 11, 1999, Boeing launched the BBJ2. Based on the 737-800, it is longer than the BBJ1, with 25% more cabin space and twice the baggage space, but has slightly reduced range. It is also fitted with auxiliary belly fuel tanks and winglets. The first BBJ2 was delivered on February 28, 2001.

Boeing&#x27;s BBJ3 is based on the 737-900ER. The BBJ3 has of floor space, 35% more interior space, and 89% more luggage space than the BBJ2. It has an auxiliary fuel system, giving it a range of up to , and a Head-up display. Boeing completed the first example in August 2008. This aircraft&#x27;s cabin is pressurized to a simulated altitude.

=== Boeing Converted Freighter program ===
The Boeing Converted Freighter program (BCF), or the 737-800BCF program, was launched by Boeing in 2016. It converts old 737-800 passenger jets to dedicated freighters. The first 737-800BCF was delivered in 2018 to GECAS, which is leased to West Atlantic. Boeing has signed an agreement with Chinese YTO Cargo Airlines to provide the airline with 737-800BCFs pending a planned program launch.

=== Experimental ===

Four 737 aircraft have been used in Boeing test programs. In 2012, a new 737-800 bound for American Airlines became the first ecoDemonstrator airframe in a program that continues annually into the 2020s. In conjunction with many industry partners, the program aims to reduce the environmental impact of aviation. In 2012 it tested the winglets which would eventually be used in the 737 MAX series. Testing also included a variable area exhaust nozzle, regenerative hydrogen fuel cells for electrical power, and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

In 2018, one of the 737 MAX 7 prototypes participated in Boeing&#x27;s Quiet Technology Demonstrator 3 (QTD3) program, in which a NASA engine inlet designed to reduce engine noise was tested over an acoustic array at Moses Lake, Washington.

A 737 MAX 9 was used as the 2021 ecoDemonstrator. A new airframe in a special Alaska Airlines livery flew an extensive test program, a major part of which was the use of SAF in blends of up to 50% including a flight from Seattle to Glasgow, Scotland, to attend the United Nations COP26 Climate Change Conference. Other test areas included halon-free fire extinguisher (ground testing only), a low-profile anti-collision light, and text-based air traffic control communications. At the end of the testing the aircraft was returned to standard configuration, and was delivered to Alaska Airlines in 2022.

During October 2023 a 737 MAX 10 destined for United Airlines flew a series of test flights to compare the emissions of SAF, including the contrails, with those of conventional fuel. The emissions were measured by NASA&#x27;s Douglas DC-8 Airborne Science Lab which flew close behind the 737, which wore a special livery as part of a series of special tests named ecoDemonstrator Explorer.

== Competition ==


The Boeing 737 Classic, Next Generation and MAX series have faced significant competition from the Airbus A320 family first introduced in 1988. The relatively recent Airbus A220 family now also competes against the smaller capacity end of the 737 variants. The A320 was developed to compete also with the McDonnell Douglas MD-80/90 and 95 series; the 95 later becoming the Boeing 717. Since July 2017, Airbus had a 59.4% market share of the re-engined single aisle market, while Boeing had 40.6%; Boeing had doubts on over-ordered A320neos by new operators and expected to narrow the gap with replacements not already ordered. However, in July 2017, Airbus had still 1,350 more A320neo orders than Boeing had for the 737 MAX.

Boeing delivered 8,918 of the 737 family between March 1988 and December 2018, while Airbus delivered 8,605 A320 family aircraft over a similar period since first delivery in early 1988.

== Operators ==
The five largest operators of the Boeing 737 are Southwest Airlines (815), Ryanair (566), United Airlines (496), American Airlines (363), and Delta Air Lines (240) as of June 2024.

=== Usage ===

==== Civilian ====
In 2006, over 4,500 Boeing 737s were operated by more than 500 airlines, flying to 1,200 destinations in 190 countries and on average 1,250 aircraft were airborne, with two either departing or landing every five seconds. The 737 was the most commonly flown aircraft in 2008, 2009, and 2010.

In 2013, over 5,580 Boeing 737s were operated by more than 342 airlines in 111 countries, which represented more than 25% of the worldwide fleet of large jet airliners. The 737 had carried over 16.8 billion passengers (twice of 7.1 billion world population in that time) over 119 billion miles (192 billion km) with more than 184 million flights or 264 million hours in the air.

In 2016, there were 6,512 Boeing 737 airliners in service (5,567 737NGs plus 945 737-200s and 737 Classics), more than the 6,510 Airbus A320 family. while in 2017, there were 6,858 737s in service (5,968 737NGs plus 890 737-200s and classics), fewer than the 6,965 A320 family.

By 2018, over 7,500 Boeing 737s were in service and on average 2,800 aircraft were airborne, with two either departing or landing every three seconds, carrying around three million passengers daily. At the time, the global 737 fleet had carried over 22 billion passengers since its introduction.
, there were 9,315 Boeing 737s in service, slightly fewer than the 9,353 of the A320 family, as more 737s were already out of service.

==== Military ====
Many countries operate the 737 passenger, BBJ, and cargo variants in government or military applications. Users with 737s include:

=== Orders and deliveries ===

==== Orders ====
The 737 had the highest, cumulative orders for any airliner until surpassed by the A320 family in October 2019. In that year, 737 orders dropped by 90%, as 737 MAX orders dried up after the March grounding. The 737 MAX backlog fell by 182, mainly due to the Jet Airways bankruptcy, a drop in Boeing&#x27;s airliner backlog was a first in at least the past 30 years.
, 16,737 units of the Boeing 737 family had been ordered, with 4,772 orders were pending, or 4,296 when including &quot;additional criteria for recognizing contracted backlog with customers beyond the existence of a firm contract&quot; (ASC 606 Adjustment).

==== Deliveries ====

Boeing delivered the 5,000th 737 to Southwest Airlines on February 13, 2006, the 6,000th 737 to Norwegian Air Shuttle in April 2009, the 7,000th 737 to Flydubai on December 16, 2011, the 8,000th 737 to United Airlines on April 16, 2014, and the 9,000th 737 to China United Airlines in April 2016. The 10,000th 737 was ordered in July 2012, rolled out on March 13, 2018, and was to be delivered to Southwest Airlines; the backlog at the time stood at over 4,600 aircraft.
, 11,965 units of the Boeing 737 family had been delivered, while 11,885 of the competing A320 family had been delivered.
Therefore, the 737 is the most delivered jetliner.


=== Model summary ===

== Accidents and incidents ==
, the Boeing 737 family has been involved in 529 aviation accidents and incidents, including 215 hull loss accidents out of 234 hull-losses, resulting in a total of 5,779 fatalities.
A Boeing analysis of commercial jet airplane accidents between 1959 and 2013 found that the hull loss rate for the Original series was 1.75 per million departures, for the Classic series 0.54, and the Next Generation series 0.27. As of 2023, the analysis showed that the hull loss rate for the Original series was 1.78 (0.87 fatal hull loss rate), for the Classic series 0.81 (0.26 fatal hull loss rate), for the Next Generation series 0.18 (0.04 fatal hull loss rate), and for the MAX series 1.48 (1.48 fatal hull loss rate) per million departures.
During the 1990s, a series of rudder issues on series -200 and -300 aircraft resulted in multiple incidents. In two total loss accidents, United Airlines Flight 585 (a -200 series) and USAir Flight 427, (a -300), the pilots lost control of the aircraft following a sudden and unexpected deflection of the rudder, killing everyone aboard, a total of 157 people. Similar rudder issues led to a temporary loss of control on at least five other 737 flights before the problem was ultimately identified. The National Transportation Safety Board determined that the accidents and incidents were the result of a design flaw that could result in an uncommanded movement of the aircraft&#x27;s rudder. As a result of the NTSB&#x27;s findings, the Federal Aviation Administration ordered that the rudder servo valves be replaced on all 737s and mandated new training protocols for pilots to handle an unexpected movement of control surfaces.
Following the crashes of two 737 MAX 8 aircraft, Lion Air Flight 610 in October 2018 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 in March 2019, which caused 346 deaths, civil aviation authorities around the world grounded the 737 MAX series. On December 16, 2019, Boeing announced that it would suspend production of the 737 MAX from January 2020. Production of the MAX series resumed on May 27, 2020.

<doc id="149698" wikidata="Q2227196" url="?curid=149698" title="Idylls of the King">
<text>Idylls of the King, published between 1859 and 1885, is a cycle of twelve narrative poems by the English poet Alfred, Lord Tennyson (1809–1892; Poet Laureate from 1850) which retells the legend of King Arthur, his knights, his love for Guinevere and her tragic betrayal of him, and the rise and fall of Arthur&#x27;s kingdom.

The whole work recounts Arthur&#x27;s attempt and failure to lift up mankind and create a perfect kingdom, from his coming to power to his death at the hands of the traitor Mordred. Individual poems detail the deeds of various knights, including Lancelot, Geraint, Galahad, and Balin and Balan, and also Merlin and the Lady of the Lake. There is little transition between Idylls, but the central figure of Arthur links all the stories. The poems were dedicated to the late Albert, Prince Consort.

The &quot;Idylls&quot; are written in blank verse. Tennyson&#x27;s descriptions of nature are derived from observations of his own surroundings, collected over the course of many years. The dramatic narratives are not an epic either in structure or tone, but derive elegiac sadness in the style of the idylls of Theocritus. &quot;Idylls of the King&quot; is often read as an allegory of the societal conflicts in Britain during the mid-Victorian era.

==Tennyson&#x27;s sources and idealism==
Tennyson based his retelling primarily on Sir Thomas Malory&#x27;s &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; and the &quot;Mabinogion&quot;, but with many expansions, additions, and several adaptations, a notable example of which is the fate of Guinevere. In Malory she retires to a convent, fleeing Mordred when he usurps Arthur&#x27;s throne. She outlives Arthur, and has a final interview with Lancelot, whom she sends away as she is dedicated to her life as a nun. Lancelot emulates her, becoming a hermit and a priest. In the &quot;Idylls&quot; Guinevere flees to a convent, grovels before and is forgiven by Arthur before his final battle, repents, and serves in the convent until she dies. Malory&#x27;s Guinevere is a noble, tragic figure; Tennyson&#x27;s is a rather pathetic one. Tennyson amended the traditional spellings of several names to fit the metre.

==Place of writing==
Part of the work was written in the Hanbury Arms in Caerleon, where a plaque commemorates the event.

== Publishing chronology ==
The first set of &quot;Idylls&quot;, &quot;Enid&quot;, &quot;Vivien&quot;, &quot;Elaine&quot;, and &quot;Guinevere&quot;, was published in 1859. &quot;Enid&quot; was later divided into &quot;The Marriage of Geraint&quot; and &quot;Geraint and Enid&quot;, and &quot;Guinevere&quot; was expanded. &quot;The Holy Grail and Other Poems&quot; appeared ten years later. &quot;The Last Tournament&quot; was published in &quot;Contemporary Review&quot; in 1871. &quot;Gareth and Lynette&quot; was published the following year. The final idyll, &quot;Balin and Balan&quot;, was published in &quot;Tiresias and Other Poems&quot; in 1885. The Dedication was published in 1862, a year after the Prince Consort had died; the epilogue, &quot;To the Queen&quot;, was published in 1873.

== The Idylls ==
=== The Coming of Arthur ===
The first of the Idylls covers the period following Arthur&#x27;s coronation, his accession, and marriage. The besieged Leodogran, King of Cameliard, appeals to Arthur for help against the beasts and heathen hordes. Arthur vanquishes these and then the Barons who challenge his legitimacy. Afterwards he requests the hand of Leodogran&#x27;s daughter, Guinevere, whom he loves. Leodogran, grateful but also doubtful of Arthur&#x27;s lineage, questions his chamberlain, Arthur&#x27;s emissaries, and Arthur&#x27;s half-sister Bellicent (the character known as Anna or Morgause in other versions), receiving a different account from each. He is persuaded at last by a dream of Arthur crowned in heaven. Lancelot is sent to bring Guinevere, and she and Arthur wed in May. At the wedding feast, Arthur refuses to pay the customary tribute to the Lords from Rome, declaring, “The old order changeth, yielding place to new.” This phrase is repeated by Arthur throughout the work. Tennyson&#x27;s use of the phrase in both the first and last Idyll, and throughout the work, is indicative of the change in Britain&#x27;s, and Arthur&#x27;s, fortunes. At this point, the phrase indicates the passing of Rome and the Heathens; In &quot;The Passing of Arthur&quot;, it indicates the downfall of Arthur&#x27;s kingdom.

=== Gareth and Lynette ===
Tennyson based &quot;Gareth and Lynette&quot; on the fourth (Caxton edition: seventh) book of Malory&#x27;s &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;. There are earlier versions of the Arthurian legends, Cretian being among the earliest. 
Malory&#x27;s is perhaps best known; it is possible that Malory created the tale himself, though he may have relied on an older work.

Of all the Idylls, “Gareth and Lynette” is sweetest and most innocent. Gareth, Bellicent and Lot&#x27;s last son, dreams of knighthood but is frustrated by his mother. After a lengthy argument she clinches the matter, or so she thinks, by ordering him to serve as an anonymous scullion in Arthur&#x27;s kitchens for a year and a day. To her disappointment, he agrees. Upon his arrival incognito at Camelot, Gareth is greeted by a disguised Merlin, who tells him the city is never built at all, and therefore built forever, and warns him that Arthur will bind him by vows no man can keep. Gareth is angered by his apparent tomfoolery, but is himself rebuked for going disguised to the truthful Arthur.

Arthur consents to the boy&#x27;s petition for kitchen service. After Gareth has served nobly and well for a month, Bellicent repents and frees him from his vow. Gareth is secretly knighted by Arthur, who orders Lancelot to keep a discreet eye on him. Gareth&#x27;s first quest comes in the form of the cantankerous Lynette, who begs Arthur for Lancelot&#x27;s help in freeing her sister Lyonors. Rather than Lancelot, she is given Gareth, still seemingly a kitchen servant. Indignant, she flees, and abuses Gareth sorely when he catches up. On their journey he proves himself again and again, but she continues to call him knave and scullion. Gareth remains courteous and gentle throughout. Throughout the journey to the Castle Perilous, he overthrows the soi-disant knight of the Morning Star, knight of the Noonday Sun, knight of the Evening Star, and finally the most terrible knight of Death, who is revealed as a boy coerced into his role by his older brothers. Tennyson concludes: “And he [Malory] that told the tale in older times / Says that Sir Gareth wedded Lyonors, / But he, that told it later [Tennyson], says Lynette.”

===Enid===
&quot;Enid&quot; was initially written as a single poem but was later divided into two parts: &quot;The Marriage of Geraint&quot; and &quot;Geraint and Enid&quot;. It is based on one of the Welsh Romances, &quot;Geraint and Enid&quot;, of the &quot;Mabinogion&quot;.

==== The Marriage of Geraint ====
Geraint, tributary prince of Devon and one of Arthur&#x27;s bravest knights, is married to Enid, the only daughter of Yniol. He loves his wife deeply and she responds with equal affection; her only wish is to please him. At this time, the first rumours about Lancelot and Guinevere begin to spread throughout the court, but as yet there is no proof that any romance really exists. Geraint believes the stories and begins to fear that Enid will follow the bad example of her friend, the queen. His worries begin to plague him and he finally asks Arthur&#x27;s permission to return to Devon.

After they arrive home, Geraint is very affectionate and attentive to his wife. He totally neglects his duties as a ruler and a knight, for he is obsessed with the idea that Enid has left a lover behind at the palace. Made suspicious by his jealousy, he stays at Enid&#x27;s side at all times. Before long, Geraint&#x27;s reputation begins to suffer. His people secretly scoff at him and jeer that his manliness is gone. Enid also is upset by his new and disgraceful way of life, but she is afraid to criticise him since she does not want to cause him any pain.

One morning as they lie in bed, she muses out loud about her sad dilemma and berates herself as a bad wife for remaining silent. Geraint awakens and overhears her last few words. He jumps to the conclusion that she is confessing her infidelity and is infuriated. He angrily shouts that he is still a warrior, despite all rumours, and that he will at once go on a quest to prove his prowess. She alone is to accompany him, taking no baggage and wearing her oldest and most shabby dress.

==== Geraint and Enid ====

Geraint and Enid set out on their journey that very morning. Geraint orders Enid to ride in front of him and not to speak, whatever the provocation. Perhaps, Tennyson hints, this command is because he still loves her and is afraid that in some outburst of his brooding jealousy he will harm her. The two ride on slowly into the bandit-infested wilderness adjoining Devon. Neither speaks, and both look pale and unhappy.

After a while, Enid notices three knights and overhears them planning to attack Geraint. He is riding so listlessly that he inspires no fear in them. She does not wish to disobey his order to her, but is afraid that he might be harmed. Finally she rides back and warns him. Rather than show any gratitude, Geraint criticises Enid for her disobedience and needles her about his suspicion that she really wants him to be defeated. Geraint engages the knights and is victorious. He piles the armour of the dead knights on their horses and makes Enid lead them as she rides.

The same episode is repeated again with three other knights, and once more Geraint chastises Enid for her disobedience. He is triumphant in each fight. Now Enid is forced to lead six captured horses. Geraint has some sympathy for her difficulty handling them, but does not offer to help.

In the afternoon, Geraint and Enid dine with some farm workers and are then guided to an inn for the night. After arranging for accommodations, Geraint continues to be sullen and nasty. Later that evening, they are visited at the inn by the local ruler, Earl Limours, who, by chance, happens to have once been a suitor of Enid&#x27;s. Limours is a crude drunkard, and Geraint callously allows him to make all sorts of coarse jokes, much to the distress and embarrassment of Enid. Before leaving for the night, Limours informs Enid that he still loves her and plans the next morning to rescue her from her cruel husband.

When day breaks, Enid warns Geraint of the plot. He, of course, suspects her of having encouraged the earl and is angry. They leave the inn immediately but are pursued by Limours and his followers. In a running fight, Geraint is able to drive them off.

Soon the unhappy couple enters the lawless territory of Earl Doorm the Bull. Suddenly Geraint collapses from his wounds. Enid is powerless to aid him and she sits by his side, weeping while he lies unconscious. After a while, Doorm and his soldiers ride past, returning from a raid. The outlaw earl&#x27;s curiosity is aroused by the lovely maiden and he questions her. Doorm insists that the wounded knight is dead, but Enid refuses to believe him. The outlaw chieftain has his soldiers bring Geraint&#x27;s body and Enid to his stronghold.

As they gallop off together on one horse, they meet Edyrn, son of Nudd. He informs them that he is an advance scout for an army led by Arthur to rid this province of thieves and outlaws. He offers to guide them to the king&#x27;s camp where Geraint reports to Arthur. After Geraint is shamed by the praise Arthur gives him, he and Enid are reconciled in their tent. When Geraint is well again they all return to Caerleon. Later on, the happy couple returns to Devon. Geraint&#x27;s chivalrous and commendable behaviour as ruler and knight ends all rumours about him.

=== Balin and Balan ===
&quot;Balin and Balan&quot; is based on the tale of Sir Balin in Book II of &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;. Malory&#x27;s source was the Old French Post-Vulgate Cycle, specifically the text known as the &quot;Suite du Merlin&quot;.

The brothers Sir Balin &quot;the Savage&quot; and Balan return to Arthur&#x27;s hall after three years of exile, and are welcomed warmly. When Arthur&#x27;s envoys return, they report the death of one of Arthur&#x27;s knights from a demon in the woods. Balan offers to hunt the demon, and before he departs warns Balin against his terrible rages, which were the cause of their exile. Balin tries to learn gentleness from Lancelot, but despairs and concludes that Lancelot&#x27;s perfect courtesy is beyond his reach. Instead, he takes the Queen&#x27;s crown for his shield. Several times it reminds him to restrain his temper.

Then, one summer morning, Balin beholds an ambiguous exchange between Lancelot and the Queen that fills him with confusion. He leaves Camelot and eventually arrives at the castle of Pellam and Garlon. When Garlon casts aspersions on the Queen, Balin kills him and flees. Ashamed of his temper, he hangs his crowned shield in a tree, where Vivien and her squire discover it, and then Balin himself. She spins lies to Balin that confirm his suspicions about Guinevere. He shrieks, tears down his shield, and tramples it. In that same wood, Balan hears the cry and believes he has found his demon. The brothers clash and only too late recognise each other. Dying, Balan assures Balin that their Queen is pure and good.

=== Merlin and Vivien ===
Having boasted to King Mark that she will return with the hearts of Arthur&#x27;s knights in her hand, Vivien begs and receives shelter in Guinevere&#x27;s retinue. While in Camelot, she sows rumours of the Queen&#x27;s affair. She fails to seduce the King, for which she is ridiculed, and turns her attentions to Merlin. She follows him when he wanders out of Arthur&#x27;s court, troubled by visions of impending doom. She intends to coax out of Merlin a spell that will trap him forever, believing his defeat would be her glory. She protests her love to Merlin, declaring he cannot love her if he doubts her. When he mentions Arthur&#x27;s knights&#x27; gossip about her, she slanders every one of them. Merlin meets every accusation but one: that of Lancelot&#x27;s illicit love, which he admits is true. Worn down, he allows himself to be seduced, and tells Vivien how to work the charm. She immediately uses it on him, and so he is imprisoned forever, as if dead to anyone but her, in a hollow, nearby oak tree.

=== Lancelot and Elaine ===

&quot;Lancelot and Elaine&quot; is based upon the story of Elaine of Astolat, found in &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, the Lancelot-Grail Cycle, and the Post-Vulgate Cycle. Tennyson had previously treated a similar subject in &quot;The Lady of Shalott&quot;, published in 1833 and revised in 1842; however, that poem was based on the thirteenth-century Italian &quot;novellina&quot; &quot;La Damigella di Scalot&quot;, and thus has little in common with Malory&#x27;s version.

Long ago, Arthur happened upon the skeletons of two warring brothers, one wearing a crown of nine diamonds. Arthur retrieved the crown and removed the diamonds. At eight annual tourneys, he awarded a diamond to the tournament winner. The winner has always been Lancelot, who plans to win once more and give all nine diamonds to his secret love Queen Guinevere. Guinevere chooses to stay back from the ninth tournament, and Lancelot then tells Arthur he too will not attend. Once they are alone, she berates Lancelot for giving grounds for slander from court and reminds Lancelot that she cannot love her too-perfect king, Arthur. Lancelot then agrees to go to the tournament, but in disguise. He borrows armour, arms and colours from a remote noble, the Lord of Astolat, and as a finishing touch, agrees to wear Astolat&#x27;s daughter Elaine&#x27;s token favour, which he has never done &quot;for any woman&quot;. Lancelot&#x27;s flattering chivalry wins over the impressionable young Elaine&#x27;s heart. Here the Idyll repeats Malory&#x27;s account of the tournament and its aftermath.

Elaine has thus fallen in love with Lancelot. When he tells her that their love can never be, she wishes for death. She later becomes weak and dies. As per her request, her father and brothers put her on a barge with a note to Lancelot and Guinevere. Lancelot has returned to Camelot to present the nine diamonds to Guinevere. In an unwarranted jealous fury, the Queen hurls the diamonds out the window into the river, just as Elaine&#x27;s funeral barge passes below. This is fulfilling of a dream Elaine spoke of in which she held the ninth diamond, but it was too slippery to hold and fell into a body of water. Elaine&#x27;s body is brought into the hall and her letter read, at which the lords and ladies weep. Guinevere privately asks Lancelot&#x27;s forgiveness. The knight muses that Elaine loved him more than the Queen, wonders if all the Queen&#x27;s love has rotted to jealousy, and wishes he was never born.

=== The Holy Grail ===
This Idyll is told in flashback by Sir Percivale, who had become a monk and died one summer before the account, to his fellow monk Ambrosius. His pious sister had beheld the Grail and named Galahad her &quot;knight of heaven&quot;, declaring that he, too, would behold it. One summer night in Arthur&#x27;s absence, Galahad sits in the Siege Perilous. The hall is shaken with thunder, and a vision of the covered Grail passes the knights. Percivale swears that he will quest for it a year and a day, a vow echoed by all the knights. When Arthur returns, he hears the news with horror. Galahad, he says, will see the Grail, and perhaps Percivale and Lancelot also, but the other knights are better suited to physical service than spiritual. The Round Table disperses. Percivale travels through a surreal, allegorical landscape until he meets Galahad in a hermitage. They continue together until Percivale can no longer follow, and he watches Galahad depart to a heavenly city in a boat like a silver star. Percival sees the grail, far away, not as close or real an image as Galahad saw, above Galahad&#x27;s head. After the period of questing, only a remnant of the Round Table returns to Camelot. Some tell stories of their quests. Gawain decided to give up and spent pleasant times relaxing with women, until they were all blown over by a great wind, and he figured it was time to go home. Lancelot found a great, winding staircase, and climbed it until he found a room which was hot as fire and very surreal, and saw a veiled version of the grail wrapped in samite, a heavy silk popular in the Middle Ages, which is mentioned several times throughout the Idylls. &quot;The Holy Grail&quot; is symbolic of the Round Table being broken apart, a key reason for the doom of Camelot.

=== Pelleas and Ettare ===
Tennyson&#x27;s source for &quot;Pelleas and Ettare&quot; was again Malory, who had himself adapted the story from the Post-Vulgate Cycle.

In an ironic echo of &quot;Gareth and Lynette&quot;, the young, idealistic Pelleas meets and falls in love with the lady Ettare. She thinks him a fool, but treats him well at first because she wishes to hear herself proclaimed the &quot;Queen of Beauty&quot; at the tournament. For Pelleas&#x27; sake, Arthur declares it a &quot;Tournament of Youth&quot;, barring his veteran warriors. Pelleas wins the title and circlet for Ettare, who immediately ends her kindness to him. He follows her to her castle, where for a sight of her he docilely allows himself to be bound and maltreated by her knights, although he can and does overthrow them all. Gawain observes this one day with outrage. He offers to court Ettare for Pelleas, and for this purpose borrows his arms and shield. When admitted to the castle, he announces that he has killed Pelleas.

Three nights later, Pelleas enters the castle in search of Gawain. He passes a pavilion of Ettare&#x27;s knights, asleep, and then a pavilion of her maidens, and then comes to a pavilion where he finds Ettare in Gawain&#x27;s arms. He leaves his sword across their throats to show that, if not for Chivalry, he could have killed them. When Ettare wakes, she curses Gawain. Her love turns to Pelleas, and she pines away. Disillusioned with Arthur&#x27;s court, Pelleas leaves Camelot to become the Red Knight in the North.

=== The Last Tournament ===
Guinevere had once fostered an infant found in an eagle&#x27;s nest, who had a ruby necklace wrapped around its neck. After the child died, Guinevere gave the jewels to Arthur to make a tournament prize. However, before the tournament, a mutilated peasant stumbles into the hall. He was tortured by the Red Knight in the North, who has set up a parody of the Round Table with lawless knights and harlots. Arthur delegates the judging of the Tournament to Lancelot and takes a company to purge the evil. &quot;The Tournament of the Dead Innocence&quot; becomes a farce, full of discourtesies, broken rules, and insults. Sir Tristram wins the rubies. Breaking tradition, he rudely declares to the ladies that the &quot;Queen of Beauty&quot; is not present. Arthur&#x27;s fool, Dagonet, mocks Tristram. In the north, meanwhile, Arthur&#x27;s knights, too full of rage and disgust to heed their King, trample the Red Knight, massacre his men and women, and set his tower ablaze.

Tristram gives the rubies to Queen Isolt, Mark&#x27;s wife, who is furious that he has married Isolt of Brittany. They taunt each other, but at the last he puts the necklace about her neck and bends to kiss her. At that moment Mark rises up behind him and splits his skull.

=== Guinevere ===
Guinevere has fled to the convent at Almesbury. On the night that she and Lancelot had determined to part forever, Mordred, tipped off by Vivien, watched and listened with witnesses to their farewells. Guinevere rejects Lancelot&#x27;s offer of sanctuary in his castle overseas, choosing instead to take anonymous shelter in the convent. She is befriended by a little novice. But when rumours of war between Arthur and Lancelot and Mordred&#x27;s usurpation reach the convent, the novice&#x27;s careless chatter pricks the Queen&#x27;s conscience. She describes to Guinevere the glorious kingdom in her father&#x27;s day, &quot;before the coming of the sinful Queen.&quot;

The King comes. She hears his steps and falls on her face. He stands over her and grieves over her, himself, and his kingdom, reproaches her, and forgives her. She watches him leave and repents, hoping they will be reunited in heaven. She serves in the abbey, is later chosen Abbess, and dies three years later.

===The Passing of Arthur===
This section of the &quot;Idylls&quot; is a much expanded and altered version of Thomas Malory&#x27;s &quot;Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;.

In the disastrous last battle, Arthur kills Mordred, and, in turn, receives a mortal wound. The entire Round Table has been killed with the exception of Sir Bedivere, who carries the King to a church (Avalon), where Arthur first received Excalibur from the Lady of the Lake. Arthur orders Bedivere to throw the sword into the lake to fulfill a prophecy written on the blade. Sir Bedivere resists twice, but on the third time obeys and is rewarded by the sight of an arm &quot;clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful&quot; rising from the water to catch the sword. This was the Lady of the Lake. Sir Bedivere returns to Arthur in the church and tells him what he saw. Arthur believes him and passes with Sir Bedivere watching, as the new sun rises on a new year.

===To the Queen===
In the very brief final section, poet laureate Tennyson praises Queen Victoria and the recently deceased Albert, Prince Consort, whom Arthur was supposedly modelled after, and prays that she, like Arthur, is remembered as a great ruler long after her reign is over.

==Allegory for Victorian society==
Tennyson sought to encapsulate the past and the present in the &quot;Idylls.&quot; Arthur in the story is often seen as an embodiment of Victorian ideals; he is said to be &quot;ideal manhood closed in real man&quot; and the &quot;stainless gentleman&quot;. Arthur often has unrealistic expectations for the Knights of the Round Table and for Camelot itself, and despite his best efforts he is unable to uphold the Victorian ideal in his Camelot. &quot;Idylls&quot; also contains explicit references to Gothic interiors, Romantic appreciations of nature, and anxiety over gender role reversals—all pointing to the work as a specifically Victorian one.

In the Victorian age there was a renewed interest in the idea of courtly love, or the finding of spiritual fulfilment in the purest form of romantic love. This idea is embodied in the relationship between Guinevere and Arthur in the poem especially; the health of the state is blamed on Guinevere when she does not live up to the purity expected of her by Arthur as she does not sufficiently serve him spiritually. Tennyson&#x27;s position as poet laureate during this time and the popularity of the &quot;Idylls&quot; served to further propagate this view of women in the Victorian age.

<doc id="149699" wikidata="Q884250" url="?curid=149699" title="Paralympic football">
<text>Paralympic football consists of adaptations of the sport of association football for athletes with a physical disability. These sports are typically played using International Federation of Association Football (FIFA) rules, with modifications to the field of play, equipment, numbers of players, and other rules as required to make the game suitable for the athletes.

The two most prominent versions of Paralympic football are 5-a-side football for athletes with visual impairments, and 7-a-side football for athletes with cerebral palsy.

==Blind football (5-a-side)==

5-a-side football, also known as blind futsal and blind football, is an adaptation of football for athletes with visual impairments including blindness. The sport, governed by the International Blind Sports Federation (IBSA), is played with modified FIFA rules. The field of play is smaller, and is surrounded by boards. Teams are reduced to five players, including the goalkeeper, per team. Teams may also use one guide, who is positioned off the field of play, to assist in directing players. The ball is equipped with a noise-making device to allow players to locate it by sound. Matches consist of two 20-minute halves, with a ten-minute break at half-time.

Football 5-a-side players are assigned to one of three sport classes based on their level of visual impairment:
* B1 - Totally or almost totally blind; from no light perception up to light perception but inability to recognise the shape of a hand.
* B2 - Partially sighted; able to recognise the shape of a hand up to a visual acuity of 2/60 or a visual field of less than 5 degrees.
* B3 - Partially sighted; visual acuity from 2/60 to 6/60 or visual field from 5 to 20 degrees

Teams are permitted to use sighted athletes as goalkeepers and guides; sighted goalkeepers cannot have been registered with FIFA for at least five years.

Two types of competition exist. For Class B1 games, only athletes with sport class B1 are permitted as players, with the exception of the goalkeepers and the guides, who may be class B2, B3, or sighted. For Class B2/B3 games, teams can field players in sport classes B2 and B3; at least two B2 players must be on the field at all times.

5-a-side football in Europe was developed in Spain. The first Spanish national championships took place in Spain in 1986. 
In South America, there are records of a Brazilian Tournament organized in 1980.
European and American Championships took place in 1997, followed by the first World Championships in 1998. The sport was added to the Summer Paralympic Games in 2004.

* Football 5-a-side at the Summer Paralympics
* Football 5-a-side at the Asian Para Games
* Football 5-a-side at the ASEAN Para Games
* Football 5-a-side at the Parapan American Games

==Cerebral palsy football (7-a-side)==

7-a-side football is an adaptation of association football for athletes with cerebral palsy and other neurological disorders, including stroke and traumatic brain injury. The sport is governed by the Cerebral Palsy International Sports and Recreation Association (CP-ISRA). The sport is played with modified FIFA rules. Among the modifications are a reduced field of play, a reduction in the number of players, elimination of the offside rule, and permission for one-handed throw-ins. Matches consist of two thirty-minute halves, with a fifteen-minute half-time break.

Players competing in 7-a-side football are given a sport class based on their level of disability. Eligible classes are:
*C5: Athletes with difficulties when walking and running, but not in standing or when kicking the ball.
*C6: Athletes with control and co-ordination problems of their upper limbs, especially when running.
*C7: Athletes with hemiplegia.
*C8: Minimally disabled athletes; they must meet eligibility criteria and have an obvious impairment that has impact on the sport of football.

Teams must field at least one class C5 or C6 player at all times. No more than one players of class C8 are permitted to play at the same time.

International competition in 7-a-side football began at the 1978 CP-ISRA International Games in Edinburgh, Scotland. The sport was added to the Summer Paralympic Games at the 1984 Summer Paralympics in New York City, U.S., and has been played at every Summer Games until 2016 Summer Paralympics.

<doc id="149700" wikidata="Q1774511" url="?curid=149700" title="Master of the Revels">
<text>The Master of the Revels was the holder of a position within the English, and later the British, royal household, heading the &quot;Revels Office&quot; or &quot;Office of the Revels&quot;. The Master of the Revels was an executive officer under the Lord Chamberlain. Originally he was responsible for overseeing royal festivities, known as &quot;revels&quot;, and he later also became responsible for stage censorship, until this function was transferred to the Lord Chamberlain in 1624. However, Henry Herbert, the deputy Master of the Revels and later the Master, continued to perform the function on behalf of the Lord Chamberlain until the English Civil War in 1642, when stage plays were prohibited. The office continued almost until the end of the 18th century, although with rather reduced status.

==History==
The Revels Office has an influential role in the history of the English stage. Among the expenses of the royal Wardrobe in 1347, there was provision for &quot;tunicae&quot; and &quot;viseres&quot; (shirts and hats) for the Christmas &quot;ludi&quot; (plays) of Edward III. During the reign of King Henry VII, payments are also recorded for various forms of court revels; and it became regular, apparently, to appoint a special functionary, called Master of the Revels, to superintend the royal festivities, quite distinct from the Lord of Misrule.

In Henry VIII&#x27;s court, the post became more important, following the burgeoning of courtly shows, plays and masques. To support the increased demand for theatrical entertainment, an officer of the Wardrobe was permanently employed to act under the Master of the Revels. Under Elizabeth I the Office of the Revels was further increased and was subdivided into Toyles, Revels and Tents. With the patent given to John Farlyon in 1534 as Yeoman of the Revels, what may be considered as an independent office of the Revels (within the general sphere of the Lord Chamberlain) came into being. When Sir Thomas Cawarden received a 1544 patent as Master of the Revels and Tents he became the first to head an independent office. At this point the role of the Master of the Revels was focused on royal entertainment. One of the master’s fundamental roles was to audition players and companies for performances before the monarch and court. The master was also charged with matters of public health and ensured that playing companies ceased performances during plague seasons, as well as religious matters, guaranteeing that theaters closed on Lent. Each Master of the Revels kept an official office book that served as a record of all business transactions; including purchases and preparations for each theatrical entertainment and after 1578 included fees taken after licensing plays for performance.

After the Dissolution of the monasteries, priories became open spaces to house British royal household offices. Soon after Cawarden&#x27;s appointment, the office and its stores were transferred to a dissolved Dominican monastery at Blackfriars. The office of the Revels had been previously housed at Warwick Inn in the city, the London Charterhouse, and then at the priory of St. John of Jerusalem in Clerkenwell, to which a return was made after Cawarden&#x27;s death in 1559. Cawarden lived at Loseley Park, near Guildford, where his official papers were preserved. Sir Thomas Benger succeeded Cawarden, followed by Sir Thomas Blagrave (1573–79), and Edmund Tylney followed him (1579–1610). Under Tylney, the functions of Master of the Revels gradually became extended and the office acquired the legal power to censor and control playing across the entire country. This increase in theatrical control coincided with the appearance of permanent adult theatres in London. Every company and traveling troupe had to submit a play manuscript to the Office of the Revels. The master read the manuscript and sometimes even attended rehearsals. Once a play was approved, the master would sign the last page of the manuscript. The licensed manuscript attesting to the Master of the Revels&#x27; approval of a play was a treasured item for playing companies. When traveling and taking a play into the country troupes had to carry the licensed copy of the play manuscript. There was a licensing fee charged by the Office of the Revels for the approving of plays. Tylney charged seven shillings per play.

With the legal authority to censor came the power to punish dramatists, actors and companies that published or performed subversive material. The master had the authority to imprison, torture or even maim those associated with dissident or unapproved theatrical material. In 1640 William Beeston was imprisoned for supporting the performance of a play without the approval and censor of Sir Henry Herbert, the Master of the Revels.

At the height of the Master of the Revels’ power, the master had the licensing authority to approve and censor plays as well as any publication or printing of theatrical materials across the entire country. He also had the authority to issue royal patents for new playing companies and approve the erection of their playhouses. The master was able to collect fees not only from the approval of allowed books and plays, but also through annual allowances from playing companies for the continued approval of their playhouses.

Under Tylney, the functions of Master of the Revels gradually became extended to a general censorship of the stage. In 1624 the Office of the Revels was put directly in the hands of the Lord Chamberlain, thus leading to the Licensing Act 1737, when the role was taken over by the Examiner of the Stage, an official of the Lord Chamberlain. The function was abolished only in 1968. In addition, by the end of Tylney&#x27;s tenure, the authority of the Revels Office (rather than the City of London) to license plays for performance within the City was clearly established. Tylney was succeeded by his relation by marriage, Sir George Buck. Buck was granted the reversion of the mastership in 1597, which led to much repining on the part of the dramatist John Lyly, who had expected to be appointed to the post. Sir John Astley followed Buck in the office, but he soon sold his right to license plays to his deputy, Henry Herbert, who became Master in 1641.

For the study of English Renaissance theatre, the accounts of the Revels Office provide one of the two crucial sources of reliable and specific information from the Tudor and Stuart eras (the other being the Register of the Stationers Company). Within the revels accounts scholars find facts, dates, and other data available nowhere else. A catalogue of the Folger Shakespeare Library collection based on the majority of surviving papers of Thomas Cawarden is available on-line. Other papers are available to study at the Public Record Office at Kew, or the Surrey Record Office.

With the outbreak of the English Civil War in 1642, stage plays were prohibited. Stage plays did not return to England until the Restoration in 1660.

==The Revels Office==
In 1608, Edmund Tylney wrote a memorandum on the office that offers a vivid picture of its operation. He wrote that the office:

Tylney went on the note that the office also provided a house for the master and his family, and other residences for some of the office&#x27;s personnel, if specified in the patents of their positions.

In the year of the Tylney document, the Revels Office had moved to the Whitefriars district outside the western city wall of London, though throughout its history it was located in several other places about the city, including the Blackfriars district.

According to Thomas Blount in his 1656 dictionary &quot;Glossographia&quot;, the origin of the word &quot;Revels&quot; is the French word &quot;reveiller&quot;, to wake from sleep. He goes on to define &quot;Revels&quot; as:

<doc id="149702" wikidata="Q1431327" url="?curid=149702" title="Pub rock (United Kingdom)">
<text>Pub rock is a subgenre of rock music that emerged in the early to mid-1970s in the United Kingdom. A back-to-basics movement, which incorporated roots rock, pub rock was a reaction against the expensively-recorded and produced progressive rock and flashy glam rock scenes at the time. Although short-lived, pub rock was played live in small traditional venues like pubs and clubs. Since major labels showed no interest in pub rock groups, pub bands sought out independent record labels such as Stiff Records. Indie labels used relatively inexpensive recording processes, so they had a much lower break-even point for a record than a major label.

With pub rock&#x27;s emphasis on small venues, simple, fairly inexpensive recordings and indie record labels, it was the catalyst for the development of the British punk rock scene. Despite these shared elements, though, there was a difference between the genres: while pub rock harked back to early rock and roll and R&amp;B, punk was iconoclastic, and sought to break with the past musical traditions.

== Characteristics ==

Pub rock was deliberately nasty, dirty and post-glam. Dress style was based around denim and checked shirts, tatty jeans and droopy hair. The figureheads of the movement, Dr. Feelgood, were noted for their frontman&#x27;s filthy white suit. Bands looked menacing and threatening, &quot;like villains on &quot;The Sweeney&quot;&quot;. According to David Hepworth, Dr. Feelgood looked as if they had &quot;come together in some unsavoury section of the army&quot;.

Pub rock groups disdained any form of flashy presentation. Scene leaders like Dr. Feelgood, Kilburn and the High Roads and Ducks Deluxe played simple, &quot;back to mono&quot; rhythm and blues in the tradition of white British groups like the Rolling Stones and the Yardbirds, with fuzzy overdriven guitars and whiny vocals. Lesser known acts played funky soul (Kokomo, Clancy, Cado Belle) or country rock (the Kursaal Flyers, Chilli Willi and the Red Hot Peppers). While pub rockers did not have expensive stage shows, they took inspiration from early R&amp;B and increased the dynamism and intensity of their live shows.
Pub rock allowed a variety of singers and musicians to perform, even if they did not adhere to a clearly defined musical genre. Major labels scouted pub rock acts, thinking they might find the next Beatles at a local pub; however A&amp;R representatives decided that pub rock did not have potential for mass market hits. With no interest from major labels, pub rockers put out their records through small independent record labels such as Stiff Records and Chiswick Records.

By 1975, the standard for mainstream rock album recordings was expensive, lengthy studio recording processes overseen by highly-paid record producers, with the goal of creating highly polished end products, with overdubs, double-tracking and studio effects. Some mainstream bands spent months in the studio perfecting their recording, to achieve a meticulously crafted and perfect product. Pub rockers rejected this type of costly, complex recording process; instead, with pub rockers, the goal was simply to capture the band&#x27;s &quot;live&quot; sound and feel in the studio. The difference between mainstream rock and pub rock recording approaches not only produced different sounds (polished vs. raw), it also had a significant impact on the economics of each rock genre. With mainstream rock, the costly sound recording process meant that the break-even point for the record label was around 20,000 records; with pub rock, the less expensive recording process meant that pub rock labels could break even with as few as 2,000 records.
This means that pub rock labels could afford to put out records with a tenth of the sales of mainstream bands.

The pub rock scene was primarily a live phenomenon. During the peak years of 1972 to 1975, there was just one solitary Top 20 single (Ace&#x27;s &quot;How Long&quot;), and all the bands combined sold less than an estimated 150,000 albums. Many acts suffered in the transition from pub to studio recording and were unable to recapture their live sound. The genre&#x27;s primary characteristic is, as the name suggests, the pub. By championing smaller venues, the bands reinvigorated a local club scene that had dwindled since the 1960s as bands priced themselves into big theatres and stadia. New aspiring bands could now find venues to play without needing to have a record company behind them.

Pub rock was generally restricted to Greater London over spilling slightly into the home counties, although the central belt in Scotland also produced local bands such as The Cheetahs and The Plastic Flies. Pub rockers believed that mainstream stars who played at arenas had lost touch with their audiences. Instead, pub rock groups preferred intimate venues, which were essential to creating meaningful music and connecting with the audience. Pub rock&#x27;s small venue approach increased the importance of good songwriting and well-written lyrics, in contrast to mainstream pop which had marginalised both elements. The UK pub rock scene wound down by 1976. The record industry was already looking into early punk, thinking it might be the next &quot;big thing&quot;. In 1976, some pub rock labels were putting out both the harder-edged pub rock acts and early punk bands such as The Damned.

== History ==
American country-rock band Eggs over Easy were the precursors of the movement when they broke the jazz-only policy of the &quot;Tally Ho&quot; pub in Kentish Town, in May 1971. They were impressive enough to inspire local musicians such as Nick Lowe. They were soon joined by a handful of London acts such as Brinsley Schwarz who had been victims of the prevailing big-venue system. Along with Max Merritt and the Meteors who were originally from Australia and had moved to London, Kilburn and the High Roads, Bees Make Honey, Ace, Eggs Over Easy, Chilli Willi and the Red Hot Peppers, Dr. Feelgood, Ducks Deluxe, Rockpile, Any Trouble, The Pirates, The Motors, F.B.I., Gozales, Wreckless Eric, The Inmates, Roogalator, and Kokomo. 

Most of the venues were in large Victorian pubs &quot;north of Regents Park&quot;, where there were plenty of suitable establishments. One of the most notable venues was the Hope and Anchor pub on Islington&#x27;s Upper Street, still a venue.

Following the Tally Ho and the Hope and Anchor came the Cock, the Brecknock, the Lord Nelson, the Greyhound in Fulham, the Red Lion, the Rochester Castle, the Nashville in West Kensington, the Pegasus Pub on Green Lanes, The Torrington in North Finchley, Dingwalls and the Dublin Castle in Camden Town, the Pied Bull at Angel, Bull and Gate in Kentish Town, the Kensington near Olympia, the Newlands Tavern in Nunhead, the Cricketers at Kennington Oval, Half Moon in Putney and Half Moon in Herne Hill (south London outposts) and The Sir George Robey in Finsbury Park. Out of London, venues included the Dagenham Roundhouse, the Grand in Leigh on Sea and the Admiral Jellicoe on Canvey Island. This network of venues later formed a ready-made launch pad for the punk scene.

In 1974, pub rock was the hottest scene in London. At that point it seemed that nearly every large pub in London was supplying live music, along with hot snacks and the occasional stripper. The figureheads were Essex-based R&amp;B outfit Dr. Feelgood. By Autumn 1975, they were joined by acts such as Hammersmith Gorillas, Joe Strummer&#x27;s 101ers, Eddie and the Hot Rods, and The Count Bishops.

Pub rock was rapidly overtaken by the UK punk explosion after spawning what are now seen as several proto-punk bands. Some artists were able to make the transition by jumping ship to new outfits, notably Joe Strummer, Ian Dury and Elvis Costello. A few stalwarts were later able to realise Top 40 chart success, but the moment was gone. Many of the actual pubs themselves survived as punk venues (especially the Nashville and The Hope &amp; Anchor), but a range of notable pubs such as the George Robey and the Pied Bull have since been closed or demolished. The Newlands Tavern survived. Now called The Ivy House, in 2023 it is once again a thriving music venue showcasing many new bands.

== Legacy ==

According to Nostalgia Central, &quot;Pub rock may have been killed by punk, but without it there might not have been any punk in Britain at all&quot;. The boundaries were originally blurred: at one point, the Hot Rods and the Sex Pistols were both considered rival kings of &quot;street rock&quot;. The Pistols played support slots for the Blockheads and the 101ers at the Nashville. Their big break was supporting Eddie and the Hot Rods at the Marquee in Feb 1976. Dr. Feelgood played with the Ramones in New York. The word &quot;punk&quot; debuted on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; on a T-shirt worn by a Hot Rod. Punk fanzine &quot;Sniffin&#x27; Glue&quot; reviewed the Dr. Feelgood album &quot;Stupidity&quot; as &quot;the way rock should be&quot;.

Apart from the ready-made live circuit, punk also inherited the energy of pub rock guitar heroes like Dr. Feelgood&#x27;s Wilko Johnson, his violence and mean attitude. Dr. Feelgood have since been described as John the Baptist to punk&#x27;s messiahs. In the gap between the music-press hype and vinyl releases of early punk, the rowdier Pub Rock bands even led the charge for those impatient for actual recorded music, but it was not to last.

Punks such as Sex Pistols singer John Lydon eventually rejected the pub rock bands as &quot;everything that was wrong with live music&quot; because they had failed to fight the stadium scene and, as he saw it, preferred to narrow themselves into an exclusive pub clique. The back-to-basics approach of pub rock apparently involved chord structures that were still too complicated for punk guitarists like the Sex Pistols&#x27; Steve Jones, who complained &quot;if we had played those complicated chords we would have sounded like Dr. Feelgood or one of those pub rock bands&quot;. By the time the Year Zero of punk (1976) was over, punks wanted nothing to do with pub rockers. Bands like the Stranglers were shunned but they did not care.

It was independent record label Stiff Records, formed from a £400 loan from Dr. Feelgood&#x27;s Lee Brilleaux, who went on to release the first British punk single—The Damned&#x27;s &quot;New Rose&quot;. Stiff Records&#x27; early clientele consisted of a mix of pub rockers and punk rock acts for which they became known.

<doc id="149707" wikidata="Q3357805" url="?curid=149707" title="Otto Frederick Rohwedder">
<text>Otto Frederick Rohwedder (July 28, 1880 – November 8, 1960) was an American inventor and engineer who created the first automatic bread-slicing machine for commercial use. It was first used by the Chillicothe Missouri Baking Company.

==Early life and education==
Rohwedder was born in Des Moines, Iowa in on July 7, 1880, the son of Claus and Margaret Rohwedder, of ethnic German descent. He was the second youngest of four brothers and a sister.

Rohwedder and his family lived in Davenport, where he attended Davenport public schools. He then became an apprentice to a jeweler to learn a trade.

Rohwedder also studied optometry, graduating in 1900 with a degree in optics from what is now the Illinois College of Optometry in Chicago. He became a jeweler.

==Marriage and family==
Rohwedder married Carrie S. Johnson in 1905. They settled in St. Joseph, Missouri and had two children, Margaret and Richard. Carrie died in 1955.

==Career==
Rohwedder first had a brief career as a jeweler, and became the owner of three jewelry stores in St. Joseph, Missouri. He used his work with watches and jewelry to invent new machines. Convinced he could develop a bread slicing machine, he sold his jewelry stores to fund the development effort and manufacture the machines.
In 1917 a fire broke out at the factory where Rohwedder was manufacturing his machine. It destroyed his prototype and blueprints. With the need to get funding again, Rohwedder was delayed for several years in bringing the bread slicer to market.

In 1927 Rohwedder successfully designed a machine that not only sliced the bread but wrapped it. He applied for patents to protect his invention and sold the first machine to a friend and baker Frank Bench, who installed it at the Chillicothe Baking Company, in Chillicothe, Missouri, in 1928. The first loaf of sliced bread was sold commercially on July 7, 1928. Sales of the machine to other bakeries increased and sliced bread became available across the country.

Gustav Papendick, a baker in St. Louis, bought Rohwedder&#x27;s second machine and found he could improve on it. He developed a better way to have the machine wrap and keep bread fresh. He also applied for patents for his concepts.

In 1930 Continental Baking Company introduced Wonder Bread as a sliced bread. It was followed by other major companies when they saw how the bread was received. By 1932 the availability of standardized slices had boosted sales of automatic, pop-up toasters, an invention of 1926 by Charles Strite. In 1933 American bakeries for the first time produced more sliced than unsliced bread loaves.

That same year Rohwedder sold his patent rights to the Micro-Westco Co. of Bettendorf, Iowa, and joined the company. He became vice-president and sales manager of the Rohwedder Bakery Machine Division.

In 1951, Rohwedder, at age 71, retired from Micro-Westco Co. and moved with his wife Carrie to Albion, Michigan, where their daughter Margaret (Rohwedder) Steinhauer and his sister Elizabeth Pickerill lived. Rohwedder died in Concord, Michigan, on November 8, 1960. He was buried at Riverside Cemetery in Albion.

==Honors and legacy==
* Rohwedder had seven patents approved from 1927–1936 having to do with bread slicing and handling.

<text>The IBM 7030, also known as Stretch, was IBM&#x27;s first transistorized supercomputer. It was the fastest computer in the world from 1961 until the first CDC 6600 became operational in 1964.

Originally designed to meet a requirement formulated by Edward Teller at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the first example was delivered to Los Alamos National Laboratory in 1961, and a second customized version, the IBM 7950 Harvest, to the National Security Agency in 1962. The Stretch at the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment at Aldermaston, England was heavily used by researchers there and at AERE Harwell, but only after the development of the S2 Fortran compiler which was the first to add dynamic arrays, and which was later ported to the Ferranti Atlas of Atlas Computer Laboratory at Chilton.

The 7030 was much slower than expected and failed to meet its aggressive performance goals. IBM was forced to drop its price from $13.5 million to only $7.78 million and withdrew the 7030 from sales to customers beyond those having already negotiated contracts. &quot;PC World&quot; magazine named Stretch one of the biggest project management failures in IT history.

Within IBM, being eclipsed by the smaller Control Data Corporation seemed hard to accept. The project lead, Stephen W. Dunwell, was initially made a scapegoat for his role in the &quot;failure&quot;, but as the success of the IBM System/360 became obvious, he was given an official apology and, in 1966 was made an IBM Fellow.

In spite of the failure of Stretch to meet IBM&#x27;s performance goals, it served as the basis for many of the design features of the successful IBM System/360, which was announced in 1964 and first shipped in 1965.

==Development history==
In early 1955, Dr. Edward Teller of the University of California Radiation Laboratory wanted a new scientific computing system for three-dimensional hydrodynamic calculations. Proposals were requested from IBM and UNIVAC for this new system, to be called &quot;Livermore Automatic Reaction Calculator&quot; or LARC. According to IBM executive Cuthbert Hurd, such a system would cost roughly $2.5 million and would run at one to two MIPS. Delivery was to be two to three years after the contract was signed.

At IBM, a small team at Poughkeepsie including John Griffith and Gene Amdahl worked on the design proposal. Just after they finished and were about to present the proposal, Ralph Palmer stopped them and said, &quot;It&#x27;s a mistake.&quot; The proposed design would have been built with either point-contact transistors or surface-barrier transistors, both likely to be soon outperformed by the then newly invented diffusion transistor.

IBM returned to Livermore and stated that they were withdrawing from the contract, and instead proposed a dramatically better system, &quot;We are not going to build that machine for you; we want to build something better! We do not know precisely what it will take but we think it will be another million dollars and another year, and we do not know how fast it will run but we would like to shoot for ten million instructions per second.&quot; Livermore was not impressed, and in May 1955 they announced that UNIVAC had won the LARC contract, now called the &quot;Livermore Automatic Research Computer&quot;. LARC would eventually be delivered in June 1960.

In September 1955, fearing that Los Alamos National Laboratory might also order a LARC, IBM submitted a preliminary proposal for a high-performance binary computer based on the improved version of the design that Livermore had rejected, which they received with interest. In January 1956, Project Stretch was formally initiated. In November 1956, IBM won the contract with the aggressive performance goal of a &quot;speed at least 100 times the IBM 704&quot; (i.e. 4 MIPS). Delivery was slated for 1960.

During design, it proved necessary to reduce the clock speeds, making it clear that Stretch could not meet its aggressive performance goals, but estimates of performance ranged from 60 to 100 times the IBM 704. In 1960, the price of $13.5 million was set for the IBM 7030. In 1961, actual benchmarks indicated that the performance of the IBM 7030 was only about 30 times the IBM 704 (i.e. 1.2 MIPS), causing considerable embarrassment for IBM. In May 1961, Thomas J. Watson Jr. announced a price cut of all 7030s under negotiation to $7.78 million and immediate withdrawal of the product from further sales.

Its floating-point addition time is 1.38–1.50 microseconds, multiplication time is 2.48–2.70 microseconds, and division time is 9.00–9.90 microseconds.

==Technical impact==
While the IBM 7030 was not considered successful, it spawned many technologies incorporated in future machines that were highly successful. The &quot;Standard Modular System&quot; (SMS) transistor logic was the basis for the IBM 7090 line of scientific computers, the IBM 7070 and 7080 business computers, the IBM 7040 and IBM 1400 lines, and the IBM 1620 small scientific computer; the 7030 used about transistors. The IBM 7302 Model I Core Storage units were also used in the IBM 7090, IBM 7070 and IBM 7080. Multiprogramming, memory protection, generalized interrupts, the eight-bit byte for I/O 
were all concepts later incorporated in the IBM System/360 line of computers as well as most later central processing units (CPU).

Stephen Dunwell, the project manager who became a scapegoat when Stretch failed commercially, pointed out soon after the phenomenally successful 1964 launch of System/360 that most of its core concepts were pioneered by Stretch. By 1966, he had received an apology and been made an IBM Fellow, a high honor that carried with it resources and authority to pursue one&#x27;s desired research.

Instruction pipelining, prefetch and decoding, and memory interleaving were used in later supercomputer designs such as the IBM System/360 Models 91, 95 and 195, and the IBM 3090 series as well as computers from other manufacturers. , these techniques are still used in most advanced microprocessors, starting with the 1990s generation that included the Intel Pentium and the Motorola/IBM PowerPC, as well as in many embedded microprocessors and microcontrollers from various manufacturers.

==Hardware implementation==

The 7030 CPU uses emitter-coupled logic (originally called &quot;current-steering logic&quot;) on 18 types of Standard Modular System cards. It uses 4,025 double cards (as shown) and 18,747 single cards, holding 169,100 transistors, requiring a total of 21 kW power. It uses high-speed NPN and PNP germanium drift transistors, with cut-off frequency over 100 MHz, and using ~50 mW each. Some &quot;third level&quot; circuits use a third voltage level. Each logic level has a delay of about 20 ns. To gain speed in critical areas emitter-follower logic is used to reduce the delay to about 10 ns.

It uses the same core memory as the IBM 7090.

==Architecture==
===Data formats===
*Fixed-point numbers are variable in length, stored in either binary (1 to 64 bits) or decimal (1 to 16 digits) and either unsigned format or sign/magnitude format. Fields may straddle word boundaries. In decimal format, digits are variable length bytes (four to eight bits).
*Floating-point numbers have a 1-bit exponent flag, a 10-bit exponent, a 1-bit exponent sign, a 48-bit magnitude, and a 4-bit sign byte in sign/magnitude format.
*Alphanumeric characters are variable length and can use any character code of 8 bits or less.
*Bytes are variable length (one to eight bits).

===Instruction format===
Instructions are either 32-bit or 64-bit.

===Registers===
The registers overlay the first 32 addresses of memory as shown.

The accumulator and index registers operate in sign-and-magnitude format.

===Memory===
Main memory is 16K to 256K 64-bit binary words, in banks of 16K.

The memory was immersion oil-heated/cooled to stabilize its operating characteristics.

==Software==
*STRETCH Assembly Program (STRAP)
* MCP (not to be confused with the Burroughs MCP)
* COLASL and IVY programming languages
* FORTRAN programming language
* SOS (Stretch Operating System) Written at the BYU Scientific Computing Center as an upgrade to MCP, along with an updated variant of FORTRAN.
