<text>Malaysia Airlines (Malay: &quot;Penerbangan Malaysia&quot;) is the flag carrier of Malaysia, headquartered at Kuala Lumpur International Airport. The airline flies to destinations across Europe, Oceania and Asia from its main hub at Kuala Lumpur International Airport. It was formerly known as Malaysian Airline System (Malay: ).

Malaysia Airlines is a part of Malaysia Aviation Group, which also owns two subsidiary airlines: Firefly and MASwings. Malaysia Airlines also owns a freighter division: MASkargo and the religious charter subsidiary, Amal.

Malaysia Airlines traces its history to Malayan Airways Limited, which was founded in Singapore in the 1930s and flew its first commercial flight in 1947. It was then renamed as Malaysian Airways after the formation of the independent country, Malaysia, in 1963. In 1966, after the separation of Singapore, the airline was renamed Malaysia–Singapore Airlines (MSA), before its assets were divided in 1972 to permanently form two separate and distinct national airlines—Malaysian Airline System (MAS, since renamed as Malaysia Airlines) and Singapore Airlines (SIA).

Despite numerous awards from the aviation industry in the 2000s and early 2010s, the airline struggled to cut costs to cope with the rise of low-cost carriers (LCCs) in the region since the early 2000s. In 2013, the airline initiated a turnaround plan after large losses beginning in 2011 and cut routes to unprofitable long-haul destinations, such as Los Angeles, Buenos Aires and South Africa. That same year, Malaysia Airlines also began an internal restructuring and intended to sell units such as engineering and pilot training. From 2014 to 2015, the airline declared bankruptcy and was renationalised by the government under a new entity, which involved transferring all operations, including assets and liabilities as well as downsizing the airline.

==History==
===1947–1963: Malayan Airways===

An initiative by the Alfred Holt&#x27;s Liverpool-based Ocean Steamship Company, in partnership with the Straits Steamship Company and Imperial Airways, resulted in the incorporation of &quot;Malayan Airways Limited&quot; (MAL) in Singapore on 12 October 1937, but the first paying passengers could be welcomed on board only in 1947, some 10 years later. After the war, MAL was restructured to include just the partnership of Straits Steamship and Ocean Steamship. The airline&#x27;s first flight was a charter flight from the British Straits Settlement of Singapore to Kuala Lumpur, on 2 April 1947, using an Airspeed Consul twin-engined aircraft. This inaugural flight on the &quot;Raja Udang&quot;, with only five passengers, departed Singapore&#x27;s Kallang Airport and was bound for Kuala Lumpur&#x27;s Sungai Besi Airport. Weekly scheduled flights quickly followed from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur, Ipoh, and Penang from 1 May 1947 with the same aircraft type.

The airline continued to expand during the rest of the 1940s and 1950s, as other British Commonwealth airlines, such as BOAC and Qantas Empire Airways, provided technical assistance, as well as assistance in joining the IATA. By 1955, Malayan Airways&#x27; fleet had grown to include a large number of Douglas DC-3s, and finally went public in 1957. Other aircraft operated in the first two decades included the Douglas DC-4 Skymaster, Vickers Viscount, Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation, Bristol Britannia, de Havilland Comet 4, and Fokker F27.

===1963–1972: Rapid expansion, Malaysian Airways, and Malaysia-Singapore Airlines===

Over the next few years, the airline expanded rapidly, boosted by postwar air travel demand when flying became more than a privilege for the rich and famous. By April 1960, the airline was operating Douglas DC-3s, Super Constellations and Viscounts on new routes from Singapore to Hong Kong, and from Kuala Lumpur to Bangkok via Penang. The airline also increased its frequencies from Singapore to cities on the British Borneo, including Brunei, Jesselton (now Kota Kinabalu), Kuching, Labuan, Sandakan, and Sibu.

With the delivery of an 84-seat Bristol Britannia in 1960, the airline launched its first long-haul international flight, to Hong Kong. When Malaya, Singapore, Sabah, and Sarawak formed Malaysia in September 1963, the airline&#x27;s name was officially from &quot;Malayan Airways&quot; to &quot;Malaysian Airways&quot; concurrent with the arrival of five Fokker F27 in November 1963 (though still abbreviated to MAL). MAL also incorporated Borneo Airways, with the brand effectively merged under its parent company by 1 April 1965.

In 1966, following Singapore&#x27;s separation from the federation, the airline&#x27;s name was changed again, to Malaysia-Singapore Airlines (MSA). The next year had a rapid expansion in the airline&#x27;s fleet and routes, including the purchase of MSA&#x27;s first Boeing aircraft: the Boeing 707s, as well as completion of a new high-rise headquarters in Singapore. Boeing 737s were added to the fleet soon afterwards.

===1972–1997: Incorporation and international expansion===

The differing needs of the two shareholders, however, led to the break-up of the airline just six years later. The Singapore government preferred to develop the airline&#x27;s international routes, while the Malaysian government had no choice but to develop the domestic network first before going regional and eventually international. MSA ceased operations in 1972, with its assets split between two new airlines; Malaysian Airline System (MAS), and Singapore Airlines. With the Singapore government determined to develop its airlines&#x27; international routes, it took the entire fleet of seven Boeing 707s and five Boeing 737s, which would allow it to continue serving its regional and long-haul international routes. Since most of MSA&#x27;s international routes were flown out of Singapore, most of the international routes were in the hands of Singapore Airlines. In addition, MSA&#x27;s headquarters, which was located in Singapore, became the headquarters of that airline.

The initials MSA were well regarded as an airline icon, so both carriers tried to use them. Malaysian went for MAS by just transposing the last two letters and choosing the name Malaysian Airline System, while Singapore originally proposed the name Mercury Singapore Airlines to keep the MSA initials, but changed its mind and went for SIA instead. Acronyms for airline names later became less fashionable, and both carriers then moved on to their descriptive names.

MAS took all domestic routes within Malaysia and international routes out of that country, as well as the remaining fleet of Fokker F27&#x27;s. It began flights on 1 October 1972 with 19 aircraft and soon expanded, including introducing flights from Kuala Lumpur to London. In that year, MAS operated flights to more than 34 regional destinations and six international services. In 1976, after receiving its DC-10-30 aircraft, MAS scheduled flights to Europe, with initial flights from Kuala Lumpur to Amsterdam, Paris, and Frankfurt. The Boeing 707s were then removed from the fleet.

1980 sees the entry of the Airbus A300B4 fleet which were occasionally deployed to Asian and domestic routes and the addition of additional DC-10s onto the fleet. In 1982 the airline received its first Boeing 747-200 which was used as the carriers long haul flagship.

An economic boom in Malaysia during the 1980s spurred the growth of MAS. By the end of the decade, MAS was flying to 47 overseas destinations, including eight European destinations, seven Oceanian destinations, and American destinations of Los Angeles and Honolulu. In 1993, MAS reached South America when the airline received its first Boeing 747-400 aircraft. MAS became the first airline in Southeast Asia to fly to South America using its Boeing 747 via stopovers in South Africa. MAS also flew to Mexico City for a brief period from 1994 to 1998, with fifth freedom rights to transport passengers from Los Angeles en route from Kuala Lumpur (with a stopover in Tokyo-Narita.)

Further expansion in the fleet were executed by the airline in the 1990s with the short term leasing of the MD-11 fleet. The airline has also begun replacing its Boeing 737-200 and Fokker 27 fleet with the addition of the Boeing 737-400, Boeing 737-500 and Fokker 50. In 1995 the airline received its Airbus A330-300 which effectively replaced the Airbus A300B4 and DC-10-30. A small number of its MD-11, DC-10s and Boeing 747-200 were converted and transferred to its air cargo division Maskargo.

The late 1990s saw MAS&#x27; final widebody fleet modernization with the first Boeing 777-200ER aircraft, brand new at the time. This aircraft then became MAS&#x27; primary long-haul and medium-haul routes.

===1997–2005: Financial crisis===

Prior to the Asian financial crisis in 1997, the airline suffered losses of as much as RM260 million after earning a record-breaking RM333 million profit in the financial year 1996/1997. The airline then introduced measures to bring it back to profitable. For the financial year 1999/2000, the airline cut its losses from RM700 million in 1998/1999 to RM259 million.

The airline plunged into further losses in the following years, however, amounting to RM417 million for the financial year 2000/2001 and RM836 million for the financial year 2001/2002. With these losses, the airline cut many unprofitable routes, such as Brussels, Darwin, Madrid, Munich, and Vancouver. The airline recovered from its losses the following year, achieving its then-highest profit, totalling RM461 million.

In the same year, MAS proceeded with its order of 6 Airbus A380 aircraft to envision a solution for the slot constraints the airline faced with few European routes and to maximise its presence on the kangaroo route.

In 2005, MAS suffered yet another period of unprofitability, reporting a loss of RM1.3 billion. Revenue for the financial period was up by 10.3% or RM826.9 million, compared to the same period for 2004, driven by a 10.2% growth in passenger traffic. International passenger revenue increased by RM457.6 million or 8.4%, to RM5.9 billion, while cargo revenue decreased by RM64.1 million or 4.2%, to RM1.5 billion. Costs increased by 28.8% or RM2.3 billion, amounting to a total of RM 10.3 billion, primarily due to escalating fuel prices. Other cost increases included staff costs, handling and landing fees, aircraft maintenance and overhaul charges, widespread assets unbundling charges, and leases.

The Malaysian government then appointed Idris Jala as the new CEO of MAS on 1 December 2005, to execute changes in operations and corporate culture. Several weaknesses in airline operations were identified as the causes of the RM1.3 billion loss. The most substantial factor in the losses was fuel costs. For the period, the total fuel cost was RM3.5 billion, representing a 40.4% increase compared to the same period in 2004. Total fuel cost increases comprised RM977.8 million due to higher fuel prices and another RM157.6 million due to additional consumption. In the third quarter, fuel costs were RM1.26 billion, compared to the RM1.01 billion in the corresponding period in 2004, resulting in a 24.6% increase or RM249.3 million.

Another factor for the losses was poor revenue management. MAS substantially lagged its peers on yield. Some of this gap was due to differences in traffic mix, with less business traffic to and from Malaysia than to and from Singapore, but much of it was due to weaknesses in pricing and revenue management, sales and distribution, brand presence in foreign markets, and alliance base. Moreover, MAS had one of the lowest labour costs per available seat kilometre (ASK) at US$0.41, compared to other airlines such as Cathay Pacific and Singapore Airlines at $0.59 and S$0.60, respectively. Despite low labour costs, however, the ratio of ASK revenue to this cost was, at 2.8, much lower than Singapore Airlines, where the ratio is 5.0, and slightly higher than Thai Airways Other factors were listed in the later-revealed business turnaround plan (BTP) of Malaysia Airlines, all leading to the net loss of RM1.3 billion in 2005.

===2006–2010: Recovery from unprofitability===

Under the leadership of Idris Jala, MAS launched its BTP (Business Turnaround Plan) in 2006, developed using the &quot;Government-linked Company Transformation Manual&quot; as a guide. Under the various initiatives, launched together with the BTP, Malaysia Airlines switched from losses to profitability between 2006 and 2007. When the BTP came to an end, the airline posted a record profit of RM853 million (US$265 million) in 2007, ending a series of losses since 2005. The result exceeded the target of RM300 million by 184%.

Route rationalising was also the major contributors to the airline&#x27;s return to profitability. MAS pared its domestic routes from 114 to 23, and also cancelled virtually all unprofitable international routes. It has handed off its turboprop fleet to airasia which was then tasked to handle the rural air service. It also rescheduled all of its flight timings and changed its operations model from point-to-point services to hub-and-spoke services. Additionally, the airline started Project Omega and Project Alpha to improve the company&#x27;s network and revenue management. Emphasis has been placed on six areas - pricing, revenue management, network scheduling, opening storefronts, low-season strategy, and distribution management. MAS then pushed for new aircraft purchases, using its cash surplus of RM5.3 billion to eventually purchase new narrow- and wide-body aircraft. The first of such aircraft purchases were the order of 55 Boeing 737-800 which were meant to effectively replaced the airlines ageing Boeing 737-400.

In 2007 the airline took back east Malaysia&#x27;s rural air service (RAS) operation and former turboprop aircraft which were then crippled by Airasia&#x27;s subsidiary Fly Asian Express due to its inexperience. Malaysia airlines instead launched its own subsidiary MASwings to handle the rural air service and Firefly to start commercial operations in Subang airport. Malaysia Airlines former Fokker 50&#x27;s were gradually replaced by the airlines order of ATR-72-500 from the year 2008 onwards.

Due to Idris Jala&#x27;s appointment to the cabinet in August 2009, Tengku Azmil Zahruddin took over as the airline&#x27;s new CEO. In December that year, MAS announced the purchase of 15 new Airbus A330 aircraft, with options for another 10. Expected to be delivered between 2011 and 2016, they are intended to operate on medium-haul routes to eastern Asia, Australia, and the Middle East. The airline&#x27;s plans are to run the Airbus A380 planes, which were then introduced into service in 2012, on long-haul routes along with the Boeing 777s, the A330s on medium-haul routes, and Boeing 737 aircraft on short-haul routes.

===2011–2014: Third unprofitability, 2014 aircraft losses, bankruptcy===

MAS recorded a net loss of RM2.52 billion in 2011, which was the largest in its company history, due to rising fuel costs. A major restructuring led to the appointment of a new CEO, Ahmad Jauhari Yahya, in September 2011. One of the first initiatives to stop the losses was a rationalisation of the network. The company suspended services to Surabaya, Karachi, Dubai, Dammam and Johannesburg.

With the delivery of the Airbus A380-800, the airline has also begun to retire its remaining Boeing 747-400s in 2012. Also retired were the older generation Airbus A330s and Boeing 737-400s by the end of 2014.

In February 2013, MAS reported a net profit of RM51.4 million for the fourth quarter. The airline&#x27;s improved financial performance that year was mainly attributable to its route rationalisation programme, which had an overall 8% reduction in ASK. This was matched by a marginal 1% reduction in revenue to RM13.76bil in 2012 and seat factor holding at 74.5%. The reduced ASK also helped MAS register a corresponding 14% decrease in expenditures.

The airline struggled to cut costs to compete with a wave of new, low-cost carriers in the region. The airline lost RM443.4 million (US$137.4 million) in the first quarter of 2014. The second quarter—the first in the aftermath of Flight 370&#x27;s disappearance – had a loss of RM307.04 million (US$97.6 million), which represented a 75% increase over losses from second-quarter 2013. As a result, MAS has not made a profit since 2010. In the previous three years, the airline had booked losses of RM1.17 billion ($356 million) in 2013, RM433 million in 2012, and RM2.5 billion in 2011. Industry analysts expect MAS to lose further market share and face a challenging environment to stand out from competitors while addressing their financial plight. The company&#x27;s stock, down as much as 20% following the disappearance of Flight 370, had fallen 80% over the previous five years, which contrasts with a rise in the Malaysian stock market of about 80% over the same period.
A month after the disappearance, CEO Ahmad Jauhari Yahya acknowledged that ticket sales had declined, but did not provide details. This may have partially resulted from the suspension of the airline&#x27;s advertising campaigns following the disappearance. In China, where the majority of Flight 370 victims were from, bookings on Malaysia Airlines were down 60% in March. He said he was not sure when the airline could start repairing its image, but that the airline was adequately insured to cover the financial loss stemming from the incident. In August, the airline warned of poor second-half earnings, citing a 33% decline in average weekly bookings following the loss of Flight 17. Media reported that some flights were largely empty and that the airline had slashed prices well below competitors on several key routes.

Even before the shootdown of Flight 17, many analysts and the media suggested that Malaysia Airlines would need to rebrand and repair its image and/or require government assistance to return to profitability. On 8 August, trading in the company&#x27;s stock was temporarily suspended when Khazanah Nasional—the majority shareholder (69.37%) and a Malaysian state-run investment arm—requested that MAS&#x27; Board of Directors undertake a selective capital reduction exercise (e.g. buyback or cancel stock of other shareholders); Khazanah announced it will spend (US$431 million; 27 sen per share) to compensate minority shareholders (a 12.5% premium of 7 August closing price). At the time, Khazanah Nasional did not announce much about its plans for the airline except that the airline had &quot;substantial funding requirements&quot; and that a &quot;comprehensive review and restructuring&quot; was needed.

On 29 August, Khazanah released a report, &quot;Rebuilding a National Icon: The MAS Recovery Plan&quot;, which outlines their plan for the restructuring of MAS and the process of completing the takeover. About 6,000 jobs (about 30% of MAS&#x27;s workforce) will be eliminated and the carrier&#x27;s route network will be shrunk to focus on regional destinations rather than unprofitable long-haul routes. Khazanah had plans to delist the airline from Malaysia&#x27;s stock exchange by the end of 2014 and to return it to profitability by late 2017, relisting the airline by 2018 or 2019. On the business/legal side, Khazanah intended to transfer the relevant operations, assets, and liabilities of Malaysian Airline System Berhad into a new company (no name given in documents) by July 2015.

===2015–2020: Renationalisation, restructuring, and rebranding ===
In January 2015, the airline was declared &quot;technically bankrupt&quot;. In May 2015, it was announced that the airline would be transferred to a newly founded Malaysia Airlines Berhad (MAB) by 1 September 2015, with the rebranding of the airline also commencing the same day. The new company commanded a heavily reduced workforce and adjusted route network with a focus on Asia, according to its newly appointed CEO, Christoph Mueller. He also announced that Malaysia Airlines would be putting of its Airbus A380s up for sale.

Four months later, MAB announced that they would add four new Airbus A350-900 aircraft to their fleet from the end of 2017 to the middle of 2018. The aircraft were to be leased from Air Lease Corporation. The airline also expected to add two more A350-900 and two Airbus A330-900 aircraft in the future. MAB then announced that it was set to undergo a brand overhaul involving a new name, logo and livery for its aircraft, with the changes to be unveiled on an unspecified date.

The airline has also started the retirement of the Boeing 777-200 fleet, with the last aircraft leaving in the year 2016. The route renationalisation and trimming of many long haul routes had made the aircraft inefficient to be deployed on the airline&#x27;s medium haul routes, which were then already served by the Airbus A330-300.

In January 2016, the airline introduced a policy of not serving alcohol on flights of less than three hours. While the move was unpopular with many travellers, the airline stated that its actions were in response to the preference of the majority of customers.

In April 2016, CEO Christoph Mueller resigned from his post after less than a year of leading the carrier&#x27;s reorganisation efforts, citing &quot;changing personal circumstances.&quot; Mueller initially planned to continue as CEO until September 2016 and stay on the airline&#x27;s board as a nonexecutive director to oversee the transition to a new CEO. It was announced that Peter Bellew would become the new chief with effect from 1 July 2016, effectively shortening Mueller&#x27;s tenure by a further two months.

In April 2017, Malaysia Airlines announced that the airline&#x27;s entire fleet would be tracked with the satellite flight-tracking system.

In October 2017, an unexpected announcement was made involving Malaysia Airlines CEO Peter Bellew&#x27;s return to Ryanair as chief operations officer to help fix pilot problems. Bellew had worked as a flight operations director at Ryanair until 2014. Bellew&#x27;s decision to leave Malaysia Airlines came just over a year after former chief executive Christoph Mueller left the airline, citing personal circumstances after being hired on a three-year mission to revive the state-controlled firm. The appointment of Mueller&#x27;s replacement, Captain Izham Ismail, who served as the airline&#x27;s chief operating officer prior to the appointment, was announced a few days later.

November 2017 saw the arrival of the Airbus A350 and Airbus A330-200 which were leased onto the fleet. The brand new Airbus A350s were essentially used to replace the Airbus A380 on the airline&#x27;s small long haul route network while the second hand Airbus A330-200 were deployed as interim aircraft for certain medium to long haul routes. With this the A380s were instead deployed to Narita and Seoul.

In 2019 the airline launched Project Amal (Hope) which was a special hajj umrah charter for Muslim pilgrims utilising the airline&#x27;s fleet of Airbus A380 aircraft.

===2020–present: COVID-19 pandemic, fourth unprofitability, turnaround, and ongoing management crisis===
On 6 April 2020, the Malaysian private equity firm Golden Skies Ventures reportedly made an offer of US$2.5 billion to take over Malaysia Airlines during the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic also resulted in the airline grounding most of its Boeing 737 aircraft.

In October 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Malaysia Airlines needed about RM1 billion of capital annually if the government intended to sustain its operations under the current structure. The airline also decided to retire and return all 6 of its grounded Airbus A380 aircraft to Airbus in 2023 as the viability to operate the double decker fleet became difficult as grounding persisted.

In 2022, the airline improved its financial margin through restructuring. It switched a majority of its passenger aircraft in year of Q2 2020 to Q1 2022 into cargo flights, leveraging on its ability to support the disrupted supply chain system in Asia. The Airline also undertook multiple foreign repatriation missions, transporting stranded citizens back to their home countries along with flying medical equipment and vaccines. In the same year, the airline reported a net profit of RM1.15 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022 with its total net loss reduced to RM344 million from RM1.65 billion a year ago.

In 2023, as a result of positive cash flow, Malaysia&#x27;s sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional Berhad decided it would hold on to its sole ownership of the airline until further notice. Credit lines predicted to alleviate the airline&#x27;s burden were also underutilised in year 2021–2022. The sovereign fund planned to reduce its stakes on Malaysia Airlines and to allow the airline to seek strategic partnership with an international operator post 2025.

In August 2023, the airline experienced issues with its primary inflight caterer BRAHIM in Kuala Lumpur International Airport. Contract disputes since the pandemic had brought both parties to non agreeable terms in regards to renewal. As a result, the airline halted a majority of its inflight hot meal services in September for flights originating from Kuala Lumpur. The airline has since reintegrated hot meal services from various caterers by stages and had restored most of them by November.

In November 2023, the airline has stated that it expects to reach full net profit for the whole year of 2023 with full break even in its entirety. The airline cited improved yields, balanced sheets and a constant positive cash flow as a result of its restructuring efforts along with the return of global travel demand post pandemic. The airline has also began recommitting its narrowbody and widebody aircraft renewal program.

In March 2024, Malaysia Aviation Group has confirmed that Malaysia Airlines and its subsidiaries has reached full net profit for year 2023. A profit after tax and interest (NIAT) of RM766 million was announced over year 2022 net loss of RM344 million.

Since August 2024, Malaysia Airlines faces criticism and trust lost over its management, which caused multiple technical issues, safety concerns and alleged staff poaching. The managing director of the group Datuk Captain Izham bin Ismail has criticized the Aviation industry&#x27;s original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) for global parts shortage and poor quality control of aircraft parts. The airline also faced significant delays involving aircraft deliveries from both Airbus and Boeing. The airline was originally scheduled to receive 4 Airbus A330neo and 9 Boeing 737 MAX by Q4 2024 but the airline has only received 5 from Boeing and 1 from Airbus in total. The delays has resulted in setbacks involving network strategy and planned aircraft renewal.

In February 2025, the airline has announce that it is operating back in the red for year 2024. This is due to ongoing staff attrition and OEM supply chain issues which has resulted in the airline having to cut back 18% of its scheduled flights from August to December 2024.

==Corporate affairs==

===Head office===
Malaysia Airlines has its headquarters and registered office on the first floor of Administration Building, South Support Zone at Kuala Lumpur International Airport, Sepang, in the Klang Valley region.

Previously the airline headquarters were on the third floor of the MAS Administrative Complex at Subang Airport, in Subang. Prior to the construction of the Kuala Lumpur MAS headquarters, the airline rented space in the UMBC headquarters. The airline had a permanent corporate headquarters in the Bangunan MAS, a 34-story building it owned along Jalan Sultan Ismail. In 2005 &quot;The Star&quot; said that the building was &quot;reported to be worth between RM300mil and RM350mil.&quot;

In 2006, the airline moved its head office from the Kuala Lumpur building to the former headquarters in Subang. &quot;Channel News Asia&quot; stated that the airline had been &quot;forced&quot; to sell the former headquarters.

In 2010, Permodalan Nasional Berhad purchased Bangunan MAS from the airline. The new owners planned to remodel the building, by installing a five-star hotel apartment block and upgrade the offices to Grade A++.

===Subsidiaries===
Some of the subsidiaries include:
===Financial highlights===
Malaysia Airlines experienced a RM1.25 billion loss in 2005. In 2006, the Business Turnaround Plan was introduced to revive the airline. At the end of the airline&#x27;s turnaround program, in financial year 2007, Malaysia Airlines gained RM851 million net profit: a swing of RM987 million compared to RM134 million in losses in 2006, marking the national carrier&#x27;s highest-ever profit in its sixty-year history. The achievement was recognised as the world&#x27;s best airline-turnaround story in 2007, with Malaysia Airlines being awarded the Phoenix award by Penton Media&#x27;s Air Transport World.

===Branding===
From the late 1990s until 2007, Malaysia Airlines used the slogan &quot;Going Beyond Expectations&quot; to brand itself internationally. In 2008, the new branding strategy slogan became &quot;More than just an airline code. MH is Malaysian Hospitality&quot;, to emphasise the hospitality of its cabin crew instead of the airline&#x27;s network and cabin classes.

Since 2013, the airline has been using the slogan &quot;Journeys are made by people you travel with&quot;. However, with the onset of Flight 370 and Flight 17, the airline has used a number of slogans including &quot;#keepflying&quot; and &quot;#flyinghigh&quot;. A new slogan, &quot;Malaysian Hospitality Begins With Us&quot;, was unveiled in 2018.

In 2024, Malaysia Airlines has begun to incorporate a new slogan, which is &quot;Your Gateway to Asia and Beyond&quot; that can be seen on its official website.

====Corporate image====

Malaysia Airlines introduced the Sarong Kebaya design on 1 March 1986 for female flight attendants. It was designed by the School of Fashion at Mara Institute of Technology () and later known as Mara University of Technology (). The batik material depicts the &quot;kelarai&quot; motif, which is a bamboo weave pattern. It appears in the background in subdued hues of the basic uniform colour. Superimposed on the &quot;kelarai&quot; motif is a mixture of Malaysian flora, such as the cempaka, jasmine and the leaves of the hibiscus. The geometric Sarawakian motif is used for the lapels of the &quot;baju&quot;, edges of sleeves and the &quot;sarong&quot;. In January 1993, the colours of the batik were enhanced to complement the colour of the new uniform. The male flight attendants wear grey colour jackets.

====Corporate logo====

The history of the airline started in 1937, when Malayan Airways Limited was registered as a company. Flying operations started in 1947, with the aircraft bearing the symbol of a winged tiger. A new logo was introduced with the formation of Malaysia-Singapore Airlines in 1966, featuring the initials of the airline&#x27;s name, MSA.

In 1971, MSA split into two airlines, each with its own policies and objectives, leading to the birth of Malaysia&#x27;s flag carrier, Malaysian Airline System (MAS). The name was chosen because, in abbreviated form, &quot;MAS&quot; (as in EMAS) in Malay means gold, to symbolise quality service. A corporate logo based on the wau bulan (moon kite) was eventually adopted in the following years.

A new corporate logo designed by Dato&#x27; Johan Ariff of Johan Design Associates was introduced on 15 October 1987, retaining the essence of the moon kite, now with a sheared swept-back look painted in red (top) and blue (bottom). Along with the new corporate logo, a new type style – MALAYSIA, was created. It is italicised to slant parallel with the logo to accentuate speed as well as direction. Within this corporate typestyle, the letters M, A and S bear red clippings to denote the initials of the statutory name of the airline, Malaysian Airline System (MAS). They were added after the original design was rejected by former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. The introduction of blue to the original red logo has national significance.

Beginning 2010, all of Malaysia Airlines&#x27; new Airbus A330 and Boeing 737 aircraft sport the new standard airline livery featuring two strips of red and blue emerging from the bottom of the fuselage. The wau bulan on the tail was also refreshed. Although still featuring a sheared swept-back look with its colours in red and blue, its tails have been extended to appear twinned. Moreover, the airline&#x27;s name on the fuselage is presented in full unlike before and it is entirely blue.

In 2012, the corporate logo of red and blue wau bulan was refreshed. The new wau bulan faces right, as it did in the original 1971 logo, and its tails have been extended. Initially, the airline settled for an all blue wau bulan but it has since reverted it to its red and blue form. The wordmark has also been modernised with a new typeface and the word &quot;airlines&quot; is now presented in lowercase. That same year, the airline also unveiled a new and exclusive livery for its Airbus A380 fleet to highlight the flagship carrier of the airline. It features an all-blue wau bulan on the tail and strip of blue ribbon on the fuselage and engines, the airline&#x27;s name is entirely in blue as well. Also in the same year a special retro livery scheme was painted on one B737-800 9M-MXA. The aircraft sports a rendition of the 1970s Malaysia Airlines System paint scheme to commemorate the airlines 40 year anniversary. A Boeing 747-400 was also painted in the same retro scheme in 2016.

In 2017, the airline introduced a special paint scheme &#x27;Negaraku&#x27; on one Boeing 737. Initially a special paint scheme on few selected aircraft, it is now in the process of being integrated as the standard livery across the entire fleet. This livery has the Malaysian flag painted across the aft section of the aircraft&#x27;s fuselage and symbolizes Malaysia&#x27;s rich heritage culture and also modifies the corporate wau bulan logo on the tail section of the aircraft.

In 2023, an updated rendition of the standard Negaraku livery was unveiled on the upcoming Airbus A330-900 by Airbus. The same updated paint scheme is also incorporated on the Boeing 737 MAX 8 fleet. The updated paint has the songket motif embedded on the wau bulan logo showcasing vibrant colors from Malaysia&#x27;s traditional textiles. The airline also revised the corporate name font type appearance along with adjusting the wau bulan&#x27;s angle.

===Alliance===

In August 2011, Malaysia Airlines agreed to collaborate with AirAsia through a share swap. The share swap between Malaysia Airlines&#x27; major shareholder and that of AirAsia was later undone in May 2012 due to resistance from certain quarters of its staff.

On 1 February 2013, Malaysia Airlines became a member of the Oneworld alliance, thus adding 16 new destinations into the alliance&#x27;s map. Malaysia Airlines would now be able to fly its passengers to over 842 destinations across 156 countries.

As in December 2020, Malaysia airlines now flies to a total of 59 destinations which consist of Domestic Malaysia, South East Asia, China, North Asia, South Asia, Australia, New Zealand and United Kingdom.

==Destinations==
Before the introduction of the BTP in 2006, Malaysia Airlines operated 118 domestic routes within Malaysia and 114 international routes across six continents. Under the Business Turnaround Plan, numerous routes were axed and frequencies reduced. Among these routes are Manchester, Vienna, Fukuoka, Chengdu, Nagoya, Xi&#x27;an, Cairo, Kolkata, Ahmedabad and Zürich. Malaysia Airlines became the first airline in Southeast Asia to fly to post-apartheid South Africa, and was the only airline in Southeast Asia to serve South America via South Africa until 2012. Prior to the 2014 aircraft losses, it had further suspended services to Cape Town, Rome, Dammam, Karachi, Surabaya, Johannesburg and Los Angeles. After the removal of the destinations such as Istanbul, Amsterdam, Paris and Frankfurt, its only remaining European destination is London (Heathrow), however, it is expected to recommence flights to Paris (Charles de Gaulle) from Kuala Lumpur on 22 March 2025. The airline&#x27;s last flight to Paris was in 2016.
Malaysia Airlines also owns its own charter flight division. Malaysia Airlines&#x27; charter flights have flown to destinations around the world, such as Guilin, which was previously one of Malaysia Airlines&#x27; scheduled destinations, and Christmas Island. Malaysia Airlines has also been the official airline for the Manchester United Asian Tour It also has a substantial Hajj operation.

In 2023, as part of its restructuring and network overhaul Malaysia Airlines has begun transferring a few of its domestic flights to its subsidiary Firefly. The transfer would take several phases. The airline however will retain core trunk domestic routes.

Malaysia Airlines received their first out of six lease of Airbus A350-900 on 30 November 2017. This order came due to the retirement of their previous long haul airframe, Boeing 777-200ER majorly due to its tainted reputation with MH370 and MH17 incidents several months apart in 2014. These airframes became the current flagship of Malaysia Airlines and frequently deployed to long haul destinations such as London and Doha. The airline received their sixth airframe back in 2018 and recently added one more unit, previously operated by SAS in December 2023. This occasion signifying the airline requirement in seeking to lease 4 additional A350-900 to the initial six unit for fleet expansion.

In August 2022, Malaysia Airlines confirmed it would take delivery of an initial order of 20 Airbus A330neo aircraft, with purchase options for an additional 20, to gradually replace its A330-200 and A330-300 aircraft between Q3 2023 and 2028 for flights across Asia, the Pacific and the Middle East. The deliveries are set to be split between 10 direct purchases and 10 leases from Ireland&#x27;s Avolon. The airline is expected to make a decision on Q1 2024 regarding its subsequent optional for another additional 20 frames orders on the A330neo from Airbus.

The airline has ordered 25 Boeing 737 MAX 8 with the first aircraft entering in Q4 2023.

On 30 November 2024, Malaysia Airline received its inaugural Airbus A330-900 (A330neo) aircraft, the first of many similar aircraft as part of the modernization strategy by the airline. The aircraft made a 13-hour flight from Airbus Delivery Centre in Toulouse, France and touched down at Kuala Lumpur International Airport with a traditional water cannon salute. Subsequently, Malaysia Airlines announced that the first flight for its A330neo fleet will service Melbourne beginning 19 December 2024.

====Business Class====

Business Class (previously known as Golden Club Class) is available on all of Malaysia Airlines&#x27; fleet.

As of 2024, Malaysia Airlines have three different variants of business class seating based on the aircraft type and the route serviced.

* The domestic and regional business class seat introduced in 2022 based on the Safran&#x27;s Z600 series, which can be found in Malaysia Airlines&#x27; Boeing 737-800 and Boeing 737- Max 8 fleet

In 2023, following the acquisition of additional A350 from SAS into the fleet, the airline has retained the business class seating based on the Thompson Aero Vantage XL platform.

====Economy Class====

Economy Class is available on all of Malaysia Airlines&#x27; fleet. Most of the fleet, including the Airbus A350-900, Airbus A330-300,-200, Boeing 737 MAX 8 and Boeing 737-800 features a seat pitch of 30–32 inches and width of 17–18 inches. Few row of seats are configured with extra legroom of up to 36inches for the A330 and A350 fleet.

In 2022, the airline has begun introducing a lighter more slimline seat for the narrowbody Boeing 737 fleet based on the Safran z110i lineup which features USB A and C charging. Personal in-flight entertainment is also replaced in favour of wireless entertainment content streaming provided by Viasat to be used on passengers personal devices.

Malaysia Airlines has unveiled a new economy class product to be featured on the airline&#x27;s upcoming A330-900. It is based on Recaro&#x27;s CL3810 lineup and feature a multitude of convenience features such as USB-C charging and WiFi connectivity.. Throughout the cabin, the seat covers will feature the signature songket motif. The same cabin will also extended to the A350 fleet once a refurbishment program commences in late 2025.

====&#x27;Baby ban&#x27; and &#x27;child-free zone&#x27;====
Malaysia Airlines has attracted both criticism and praise for its controversial decision to prohibit children from travelling in certain classes or cabins of its aircraft.

Infants are not permitted in First Class on Malaysia Airlines&#x27; Airbus A380s due to the non-availability of baby bassinets in the cabin. Then-CEO Tengku Azmil Zahruddin explained the policy, saying the airline received complaints from First Class passengers that they &quot;spend money on first class and can&#x27;t sleep due to crying infants&quot;.

Malaysia Airlines subsequently claimed that an upgrade of the First Class cabin to fit new seats and an ottoman (which doubles as a visitor seat) meant &quot;there was no facility for positioning bassinets in the First Class of the 747s&quot;.
Malaysia Airlines has also stated that children under the age of 12 may not travel in the 70-seat upper deck economy section of the A380. &quot;The economy seats on upper level will be allocated for business travellers. Passengers accompanying children under 12 years old age will be excluded from booking these seats.&quot;

Malaysia Airlines says the decision &quot;is to showcase the Economy Class zone in the main deck, enhanced and designated as a family and children friendly inflight zone. From the perspective of customers travelling with their families, the economy class family-friendly convenience would be a warm welcome. The main deck has more facilities such as toilets (8 for economy configuration of 350 seats) and the dual aerobridge airport facility supporting this deck will also mean a speedier/faster embarkation and disembarkation for this group of passengers.&quot;

The system comes with 4k resolution and features wireless headphone connectivity. The same system will be installed on the A350 cabin refurbishment program.

<text>A statue is a free-standing sculpture in which the realistic, full-length figures of persons or animals are carved or cast in a durable material such as wood, metal or stone. Typical statues are life-sized or close to life-size. A sculpture that represents persons or animals in full figure, but that is small enough to lift and carry is a &quot;statuette&quot; or figurine, whilst those that are more than twice life-size are regarded as a &quot;colossal statues&quot;.

Statues have been produced in many cultures from prehistory to the present; the oldest-known statue dating to about 30,000 years ago. Statues represent many different people and animals, real and mythical. Many statues are placed in public places as public art. The world&#x27;s tallest statue, &quot;Statue of Unity&quot;, is tall and is located near the Narmada dam in Gujarat, India.

==Colors==
Ancient statues often show the bare surface of the material of which they are made. For example, many people associate Greek classical art with white marble sculpture, but there is evidence that many statues were painted in bright colors. Most of the color has weathered off over time; small remnants were removed during cleaning; in some cases small traces remained that could be identified. A travelling exhibition of 20 coloured replicas of Greek and Roman works, alongside 35 original statues and reliefs, was held in Europe and the United States in 2008: Gods in Color: Painted Sculpture of Classical Antiquity. 

Details such as whether the paint was applied in one or two coats, how finely the pigments were ground or exactly which binding medium would have been used in each case—all elements that would affect the appearance of a finished piece—are not known. Gisela Richter goes so far as to say of classical Greek sculpture, &quot;All stone sculpture, whether limestone or marble, was painted, either wholly or in part.&quot;

Medieval statues were also usually painted, with some still retaining their original pigments. The coloring of statues ceased during the Renaissance, since excavated classical sculptures, which had lost their coloring, became regarded as the best models.

==Historical periods==

===Prehistoric===

The Venus of Berekhat Ram, an anthropomorphic pebble found on the Golan Heights and dated to at least 230,000 years before present, is claimed to be the oldest known statuette. However, researchers are divided as to whether its shape is derived from natural erosion or was carved by an early human. The Venus of Tan-Tan, a similar object of similar age found in Morocco, has also been claimed to be a statuette.

The Löwenmensch figurine and the Venus of Hohle Fels, both from Germany, are the oldest confirmed statuettes in the world, dating to 35,000-40,000 years ago.

The oldest known life-sized statue is Urfa Man found in Turkey which is dated to around 9,000 BC.

===Antiquity===
====Religion====
Throughout history, statues have been associated with cult images in many religious traditions, from Ancient Egypt, Ancient India, Ancient Greece, and Ancient Rome to the present. Egyptian statues showing kings as sphinxes have existed since the Old Kingdom, the oldest being for Djedefre (). The oldest statue of a striding pharaoh dates from the reign of Senwosret I () and is the Egyptian Museum, Cairo. The Middle Kingdom of Egypt (starting around 2000 BC) witnessed the growth of block statues which then became the most popular form until the Ptolemaic period ().

The focal point of the cella or main interior space of a Roman or Greek temple was a statue of the deity it was dedicated to. In major temples these could be several times life-size. Other statues of deities might have subordinate positions along the side walls.

The oldest statue of a deity in Rome was the bronze statue of Ceres in 485 BC. The oldest statue in Rome is now the statue of Diana on the Aventine.

====Politics====
For a successful Greek or Roman politician or businessman (who donated considerable sums to public projects for the honour), having a public statue, preferably in the local forum or the grounds of a temple was an important confirmation of status, and these sites filled up with statues on plinths (mostly smaller than those of their 19th century equivalents). Fragments in Rome of a bronze colossus of Constantine and the marble colossus of Constantine show the enormous scale of some imperial statues; other examples are recorded, notably one of Nero.

The wonders of the world include several statues from antiquity, with the Colossus of Rhodes and the Statue of Zeus at Olympia among the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.

===Middle Ages===
While sculpture generally flourished in European Medieval art, the single statue was not one of the most common types, except for figures of the Virgin Mary, usually with Child, and the &quot;corpus&quot; or body of Christ on crucifixes. Both of these appeared in all size up to life-size, and by the late Middle Ages many churches, even in villages, had a crucifixion group around a rood cross. The Gero Cross in Cologne is both one of the earliest and finest large figures of the crucified Christ. As yet, full-size standing statues of saints and rulers were uncommon, but tomb effigies, generally lying down, were very common for the wealthy from about the 14th century, having spread downwards from royal tombs in the centuries before.

While Byzantine art flourished in various forms, sculpture and statue making witnessed a general decline; although statues of emperors continued to appear. An example was the statue of Justinian (6th century) which stood in the square across from the Hagia Sophia until the fall of Constantinople in the 15th century. Part of the decline in statue making in the Byzantine period can be attributed to the mistrust the Church placed in the art form, given that it viewed sculpture in general as a method for making and worshiping idols. While making statues was not subject to a general ban, it was hardly encouraged in this period. Justinian was one of the last Emperors to have a full-size statue made, and secular statues of any size became virtually non-existent after iconoclasm; and the artistic skill for making statues was lost in the process.

==Renaissance==

Italian Renaissance sculpture rightly regarded the standing statue as the key form of Roman art, and there was a great revival of statues of both religious and secular figures, to which most of the leading figures contributed, led by Donatello and Michelangelo. The equestrian statue, a great technical challenge, was mastered again, and gradually statue groups.

These trends intensified in Baroque art, when every ruler wanted to have statues made of themself, and Catholic churches filled with crowds of statues of saints, although after the Protestant Reformation religious sculpture largely disappeared from Protestant churches, with some exceptions in large Lutheran German churches. In England, churches instead were filled with increasing elaborate tomb monuments, for which the ultimate models were continental extravagances such as the Papal tombs in Rome, those of the Doges of Venice, or the French royal family.

In the late 18th and 19th century there was a growth in public open air statues of public figures on plinths. As well as monarches, politicians, generals, landowners, and eventually artists and writers were commemorated. World War I saw the war memorial, previously uncommon, become very widespread, and these were often statues of generic soldiers.

===Modern era===
Starting with the work of Maillol around 1900, the human figures embodied in statues began to move away from the various schools of realism that had been followed for thousands of years. The Futurist and Cubist schools took this metamorphism even further until statues, often still nominally representing humans, had lost all but the most rudimentary relationship to the human form. By the 1920s and 1930s statues began to appear that were completely abstract in design and execution.

The notion that the position of the hooves of horses in equestrian statues indicated the rider&#x27;s cause of death has been disproved.

<text>Susan Lee Lindquist, ForMemRS (June 5, 1949 – October 27, 2016) was an American professor of biology at MIT specializing in molecular biology, particularly the protein folding problem within a family of molecules known as heat-shock proteins, and prions. Lindquist was a member and former director of the Whitehead Institute and was awarded the National Medal of Science in 2010.

==Early life and education==
Lindquist was born in Chicago, Illinois, to Iver and Eleanor (née Maggio), and attended Maine South High School in Park Ridge.

Lindquist&#x27;s father and mother were of Swedish and Italian descent, respectively, and although they expected her to become a housewife, Susan studied microbiology at the University of Illinois as an undergraduate and received her PhD in biology from Harvard University in 1976. She completed a post-doctoral fellowship at the American Cancer Society.

== Career ==
Upon completing her dissertation in 1976, Lindquist moved to the University of Chicago for a short post-doc before being hired as a faculty member in the Biology Department in 1978, becoming the Albert D. Lasker Professor of Medical Sciences with the founding of the Department of Molecular Genetics and Cell Biology in 1980. At the University of Chicago Lindquist investigated the role of heat shock proteins in regulating the cellular response to environmental stresses. Lindquist pioneered the use of yeast as a model system to study how heat shock proteins regulate gene expression and protein folding. For this work, Lindquist was made an investigator for the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in 1988. After making important new discoveries to prions, Lindquist moved to MIT in 2001 and was appointed as Director of the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, one of the first women in the nation to lead a major independent research organization.

In 2004, Lindquist resumed research as an Institute Member, an associate member of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, and an associate member of the David H. Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research at MIT.

Lindquist was awarded the National Medal of Science in 2009 (presented in 2010), for research contributions to protein folding.

Lindquist lectured nationally and internationally on a variety of scientific topics. In June 2006, she was the inaugural guest on the &quot;Futures in Biotech&quot; podcast on Leo Laporte&#x27;s TWiT network. In 2007, she participated in the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland with other MIT leaders.

Lindquist also co-founded two companies to translate research into potential therapies, FoldRx and Yumanity Therapeutics (with N. Anthony Coles), companies developing drug therapies for diseases of protein misfolding and amyloidosis.

In November 2016, Johnson &amp; Johnson gave a $5 million gift to Whitehead Institute to establish the Susan Lindquist Chair for Women in Science in Lindquist&#x27;s memory. The gift will be awarded to a female scientist at Whitehead Institute.

==Research==
Lindquist is best known for her research that provided strong evidence for a new paradigm in genetics based upon the inheritance of proteins with new, self-perpetuating shapes rather than new DNA sequences. This research provided a biochemical framework for understanding devastating neurological illnesses such as Alzheimer&#x27;s, Parkinson&#x27;s, Huntington&#x27;s, and Creutzfeldt–Jakob diseases. She was considered an expert in protein folding, which, as explained by Lindquist in the following excerpt, is an ancient, fundamental problem in biology:

What do &quot;mad cows&quot;, people with neurodegenerative diseases, and an unusual type of inheritance in yeast have in common? They are all experiencing the consequences of misfolded proteins. ... In humans the consequences can be deadly, leading to such devastating illnesses as Alzheimer&#x27;s Disease. In one case, the misfolded protein is not only deadly to the unfortunate individual in which it has appeared, but it can apparently be passed from one individual to another under special circumstances – producing infectious neurodegenerative diseases such as mad-cow disease in cattle and Creutzfeldt–Jacob Disease in humans.

Lindquist worked on the PSI+ element in yeast (a prion) and how it can act as a switch that hides or reveals numerous mutations throughout the genome, thus acting as an evolutionary capacitor. She proposed that a heat shock protein, hsp90, may act in the same way, normally preventing phenotypic consequences of genetic changes, but showing all changes at once when the HSP system is overloaded, either pharmacologically or under stressful environmental conditions.
Most of these variations are likely to be harmful, but a few unusual combinations may produce valuable new traits, spurring the pace of evolution. Cancer cells too have an extraordinary ability to evolve. Lindquist&#x27;s lab investigates closely related evolutionary mechanisms involved in the progression of cancerous tumors and in the evolution of antibiotic-resistant fungi.

Lindquist made advances in nanotechnology, researching organic amyloid fibers capable of self-organizing into structures smaller than manufactured materials. Her group also developed a yeast &quot;living test tube&quot; model to study protein folding transitions in neurodegenerative diseases and to test therapeutic strategies through high-throughput screening.

<doc id="153179" wikidata="Q123910" url="?curid=153179" title="Frank Martin (composer)">
<text>Frank Martin (15 September 1890 – 21 November 1974) was a Swiss composer, who spent much of his life in the Netherlands.

==Childhood and youth==
Born into a Huguenot family in the Eaux-Vives quarter of Geneva, the youngest of the ten children of a Calvinist pastor named Charles Martin, Frank Martin started to improvise on the piano prior to his formal schooling. At the age of nine he had already written a few songs, without external musical instruction. At age 12, he attended a performance of Bach&#x27;s &quot;St Matthew Passion&quot; and was deeply affected by it.

Respecting his parents&#x27; wishes, he studied mathematics and physics for two years at Geneva University, but at the same time was also studying piano, composition and harmony with his first music teacher Joseph Lauber (1864–1953), a Geneva composer and by that time a leading figure of the city&#x27;s musical scene. In the 1920s, Martin worked closely with Émile Jaques-Dalcroze from whom he learned much about rhythm and musical theory. Between 1918 and 1926 Martin lived in Zürich, Rome and Paris. Compositions of this time show him searching for an authentic musical voice of his own.

In 1926 he established the Chamber Music Society of Geneva which, for the next ten years he conducted, as well as contributing on the clavichord and piano. During this period he was also teaching musical theory and improvisation at the Jaques-Dalcroze Institute, and chamber music at the Geneva Conservatory.

== Works ==
Martin&#x27;s music was often inspired by his Christianity. In this regard, his compositions stemmed from &quot;the individuality rather than universality of his faith ... certainly broader than Calvinism&quot;.

The &quot;Petite symphonie concertante&quot; of 1944–45 made Martin&#x27;s international reputation, and is the best known of his orchestral works, as the early &quot;Mass&quot; is the best known of his choral compositions, and the &quot;Jedermann&quot; monologues for baritone and piano or orchestra the best known of his works for solo voice. Other Martin pieces include a full-scale symphony (1936–37), two piano concertos, a harpsichord concerto, a violin concerto, a cello concerto, a concerto for seven wind instruments, and a series of six one-movement works he called &quot;ballades&quot; for various solo instruments with piano or orchestra.

Among a dozen major scores for the theater are operatic settings of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Der Sturm&quot; (&quot;The Tempest&quot;) in August Wilhelm Schlegel&#x27;s German version (1952–55) and of Molière&#x27;s &quot;Monsieur de Pourceaugnac&quot; (1960–62), and the satirical fairy tale &quot;La Nique à Satan&quot; (&quot;Thumbing Your Nose at Satan&quot;; 1928–31). His works on sacred texts and subjects include the large-scale theater piece &quot;Le Mystère de la Nativité&quot; (&quot;The Mystery of the Nativity&quot;; 1957/1959) and are widely considered among the finest religious compositions of the 20th century. Swiss musician Ernest Ansermet, a champion of his music from 1918 onwards, recorded many of Martin&#x27;s works, including the oratorio &quot;In Terra Pax&quot; (1944), with the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande.

Martin based his mature style on his personal variant (first used around 1932) of Arnold Schoenberg&#x27;s twelve-tone technique, but he did not abandon tonality. Lean textures and habitual rhythmic vehemence distinguish his style from Schoenberg&#x27;s. Some of Martin&#x27;s most acclaimed music comes from his last decade. He worked on his last cantata, &quot;Et la vie l&#x27;emporta&quot;, until ten days before his death. He died in Naarden in, the Netherlands, and was buried in Geneva at the Cimetière des Rois.

Martin&#x27;s music is widely performed in continental Europe, and to a much lesser extent, in the United Kingdom.

<text>John Augustus Roebling (born Johann August Röbling; June 12, 1806 – July 22, 1869) was a German-born American civil engineer. He designed and built wire rope suspension bridges, in particular the Brooklyn Bridge, which has been designated as a National Historic Landmark and a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark.
==Early life and education==
Röbling was born June 12, 1806, in Mühlhausen to Friederike Dorothea (née Muelleren) and Christoph Polykarpus Röbling. Recognizing his intelligence at a young age, Roebling&#x27;s mother arranged for him to be tutored in mathematics and science at Erfurt by Ephraim Salomon Unger. He went to Erfurt when he was 15. In 1824 he passed his Surveyor&#x27;s examination and returned home for a year.

In 1824 he enrolled for two semesters at the Bauakademie in Berlin, where he studied architecture and engineering under Martin Friedrich Rabe (1765–1856), bridge construction and foundation construction under Johann Friedrich Dietlein (1782–1837), hydraulics under Johann Albert Eytelwein (1764–1848), and languages. Roebling also attended lectures of the philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. He developed an interest in natural philosophy, and many years later worked on a 1000-page treatise on his own concepts of the universe.

In 1825 Roebling got a government job in the Arnsberg province and moved to Eslohe, where he worked for four years on designing and supervising construction of military roads. During this period he made sketches for suspension bridges over Ruhr- and Lenne-river, which were never built. In 1829 he returned to his home to work out his final thesis and prepare for his second engineer examination. For unknown reasons, he never took the examination.

==Career==

On May 22, 1831, Roebling left Prussia with a group of emigrants bound for the United States. They included his brother Carl and the older Johann Adolphus Etzler, who believed in a technological utopia. Engineers had difficulty advancing and achieving economic mobility in Prussian society, in part because of the Napoleonic Wars, which had lasted until 1815, and suppressed investment in infrastructure. During this period, Prussia also had considerable political unrest, as authoritarian governments took the places of democratic ones.

Etzler believed that they could create a technological utopia in the United States, but disputes arose among the men en route. The group split up after reaching Pennsylvania. John and Carl Roebling purchased 1,582 acres (640 hectares) of land on October 28, 1831, in Butler County with the intent to establish a German settlement, to be called Saxonburg. Most of the other settlers had remained with Etzler. In 20th-century recognition of his historic importance, the John Roebling House at Saxonburg was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.

When the Roeblings and others arrived, the United States was in the later stages of an economic boom, which ended in the financial Panic of 1837, reducing everyone&#x27;s opportunities. Farmers were deeply affected by it as they often depended on credit to produce the next season&#x27;s crops. But by the 1840s, the economy was improving and many Americans believed in the nation&#x27;s manifest destiny to extend its borders and achieve greatness on the North American continent. Transportation between eastern industrial hubs and frontier farming markets had become a matter of both national and popular interest.

Many railway and transportation projects were under way near the site which Roebling chose for his colony, but instead of continuing in the engineering profession, he took up farming. After five years he married Johanna Herting, a tailor&#x27;s daughter. He found agrarian work unsatisfying, and Saxonburg attracted few settlers.

In 1837, after the birth of his first child and the death of his brother Carl, Roebling returned to engineering for work. He first worked on projects to improve river navigation and build canals. For three years, he conducted surveys for the state of Pennsylvania for railway lines across the Allegheny Mountains, from the capital, Harrisburg, to Pittsburgh in the far west, at the start of the Ohio River.

In 1840, Roebling wrote to suspension bridge designer Charles Ellet Jr., offering to help with the design of a bridge near Philadelphia:
The study of suspension bridges formed for the last few years of my residence in Europe my favourite occupation ... Let but a single bridge of the kind be put up in Philadelphia, exhibiting all the beautiful forms of the system to full advantage, and it needs no prophecy to foretell the effect which the novel and useful features will produce upon the intelligent minds of the Americans.

At that time, canal boats from Philadelphia were transported over the Allegheny Mountains on railroad cars in order to access waterways on the other side of the mountains, so that the boats could continue to Pittsburgh. The system of inclines and levels that moved the boats and conventional railroad cars was a state-owned enterprise, the Allegheny Portage Railroad. The railroad cars were pulled up and down the inclines by a long loop of thick hemp rope, up to 7 centimetres thick. The hemp ropes were expensive and had to be replaced frequently.

Roebling remembered an article he had read about wire rope. Soon after, he started developing a seven-strand wire rope at a ropewalk that he built on his farm. In 1841, Roebling began producing wire rope at Saxonburg to use in suspension bridges and such projects as the portage railroad.

In 1844 Roebling won a bid to replace the wooden canal aqueduct across the Allegheny River with the Allegheny Aqueduct. His design encompassed seven spans of 163 feet (50 m), each consisting of a wooden trunk to hold the water, supported by a continuous cable made of many parallel wires, wrapped tightly together, on each side of the trunk. He followed this innovation in 1845 by building a suspension bridge over the Monongahela River at Pittsburgh. The confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers at Pittsburgh forms the Ohio River.

In 1848, Roebling undertook the construction of four suspension aqueducts on the Delaware and Hudson Canal. During this period, he moved to Trenton, New Jersey. In Trenton, Roebling built a large industrial complex for wire production for his growing company: John A. Roebling&#x27;s Sons Company. This complex inspired Trenton&#x27;s motto that appears on the Lower Trenton Bridge: &quot;Trenton Makes, the World Takes&quot;.

Roebling&#x27;s next project, starting in 1851, was a railroad bridge connecting the New York Central and Great Western Railway of Ontario, Canada over the Niagara River. Construction took four years. The bridge, with a clear span of 825 feet (251 m), was supported by four, ten-inch (25 cm) wire cables, and had two levels, one for vehicles and one for rail traffic.

While the Niagara bridge was being built, Roebling designed a railway suspension bridge across the Kentucky River, which required a clear span of 1,224 feet (373 m). The anchorage and stone towers were completed, and the cable wire delivered along with the material for the superstructure, when the railway company became insolvent. The bridge construction was halted and he was never able to complete it.

What is now known as the High Bridge was later completed as the first cantilever bridge in the US, with a truss for carrying the railway track. A second version was built on the same foundations in 1911. The highest railroad bridge over a navigable river in the United States, the bridge is still in use.

In 1859 Roebling completed another suspension bridge at Pittsburgh over the Allegheny River. Its total length was 1,030 feet (314m), consisting of two main spans of 344 feet (105m) each, and two side spans of 171 feet (52m) each. His son Washington Roebling worked with him on that project, having completed his engineering degree.

The American Civil War brought a temporary halt to Roebling&#x27;s work, as resources were diverted to the war effort. In 1863 building resumed on a bridge over the Ohio River at Cincinnati, which Roebling had started in 1856 and halted due to lack of financing. He finished this bridge in 1867. The Cincinnati-Covington Bridge, later named the John A. Roebling Suspension Bridge in his honor, was the world&#x27;s longest suspension bridge, with a main span of 1,057 feet (322 m), at the time it was finished.

==Death==

In 1867, Roebling started design work on what is now called the Brooklyn Bridge, spanning the East River in New York. On June 28, 1869, at Fulton Ferry, while he was standing at the edge of a dock, working on fixing the location where the bridge would be built, his foot was crushed by an arriving ferry. His injured toes were amputated. He refused further medical treatment and wanted to cure his foot by &quot;water therapy&quot; (continuous pouring of water over the wound). His condition deteriorated. He died on July 22, 1869, of tetanus at the home of his son on Hicks Street, in Brooklyn Heights. It was 24 days after the accident. His son Washington Roebling was later named chief engineer of the project, but due to his further incapacity to work after suffering from &#x27;the bends&#x27; while in a caisson on the river bed, his wife Emily Warren Roebling took over the project and it was completed in 1883. John Roebling is buried in the Riverview Cemetery in Trenton, New Jersey.

==Legacy==

Roebling devised &quot;an equilibrium strength approach, in which equilibrium is always satisfied but compatibility of deformations is not enforced.&quot; This was essentially an approximation method similar to the force method: First, Roebling computed the dead and live loads, then divided the load between the cables and the stays. Roebling added a large safety factor to the divided loads and then solved for the forces. This approach gave a sufficiently accurate analysis of the structure given the assumption that the structure was sufficiently ductile to handle the resulting deformation (Buonopane, 2006).

Roebling&#x27;s company John A Roebling&#x27;s Sons Co. is credited with being the cable contractor for the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, California, constructed from 1933 to 1937. The Golden Gate Bridge was and still is a technical engineering marvel that Roebling, posthumously, has his footprint on.

Kinkora Works, the site of the Roebling Company factory complex in Roebling, New Jersey was opened as a museum in 2010. The museum tells the story of the Roebling family and the John A. Roebling&#x27;s Sons Company.

=== Honors ===
* In 2006, the &quot;Deutsche Post&quot; honored Roebling&#x27;s 200th birthday with a stamp.
* Mühlhausen named the &quot;John-August-Roebling-Schule&quot; after him.

=== In popular culture ===
* Roebling makes a brief appearance in the opening scene of the 2001 romantic comedy film &quot;Kate &amp; Leopold&quot;, portrayed by actor and dialect coach Andrew Jack. He delivers Roebling&#x27;s lines in a pronounced German accent. This is an anachronism, as the scene takes place in 1876, seven years after Roebling&#x27;s death.
* In the sixth-season &quot;Brooklyn Nine-Nine&quot; episode &quot;The Tattler,&quot; it is revealed that Jake and Gina attended John Roebling High School.
* In the second season of The Gilded Age (TV series), an HBO drama, Emily Warren Roebling is depicted as having a larger role in the engineering of the Brooklyn Bridge than is publicly known. The fact that a woman engineered the bridge becomes an issue for the characters.

==Personal life==
Roebling was the youngest of four children. He was baptized in the Lutheran church Divi Blasii in Mühlhausen. As a young boy he played the bass clarinet and the french horn. He also exhibited great artistic talent for sketches and paintings. His father owned a small tobacco shop, but the business was insufficient to provide livelihood for all three sons. Roebling&#x27;s sister Friederike Amalie married Carl August Meissner, a poor merchant in the town, and his oldest brother Herman Christian Roebling prepared to take over the tobacco shop. As noted earlier, Roebling and his brother Carl immigrated to the United States, settling first in Pennsylvania.

John Roebling and Johanna Herting had nine children:
* son: Washington Augustus Roebling (b. 1837, d. 1926)
* daughter: Laura R. Methfessel (b. 1840, d. 1873)
* son: Ferdinand William Roebling (b. 1842, d. 1917)
* daughter: Elvira R. Stewart (b. 1844, d. 1871)
* daughter: Josephine R. Jarvis (b. 1847,)
* son: Charles Gustavus Roebling (b. 9-Dec-1849, d. 1918)
* son: Edmund Roebling (b. 1854, d. 1930)
* son: William Elderhorst Roebling (b. 1856, d. 1860)
* daughter: Hannah Roebling (died in infancy)

Roebling&#x27;s son Washington and his daughter-in-law Emily Warren Roebling continued his work on the Brooklyn Bridge. His son Ferdinand expanded his wire rope business. His son Charles designed and invented a huge 80-ton wire rope machine and founded the town of Roebling, New Jersey. Here the John A. Roebling&#x27;s Sons company steel mill was built.

His granddaughter Emily Roebling Cadwalader was a married Philadelphia socialite noted as the owner of historic yachts. His grandson Washington A. Roebling II died as a passenger on the . His great-grandson Donald Roebling was a noted philanthropist and inventor who devised the amphtrack. His great-great-grandson Paul Roebling was a well-regarded actor.

<text>John Frederick Peto (May 21, 1854 – November 23, 1907) was an American &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; (&quot;fool the eye&quot;) painter who was long forgotten until his paintings were rediscovered along with those of fellow &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; artist William Harnett.

==Career==
Although Peto and the slightly older Harnett knew each other and painted similar subjects, their careers followed different paths. Peto was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts at the same time as Harnett. Until he was in his mid-thirties, he submitted paintings regularly to the annual exhibitions at the Philadelphia Academy. In 1889, he moved to the resort town of Island Heights, New Jersey, where he worked in obscurity for the rest of his life. He and his wife took in seasonal boarders, he found work playing cornet at the town&#x27;s camp revival meetings, and he supplemented his income by selling his paintings to tourists. He never had a gallery exhibition in his lifetime. Harnett, on the other hand, achieved success and had considerable influence on other artists painting in the &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; genre, but even his paintings were given the snub by critics as mere novelty and trickery. Both artists were masters of &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot;, a genre of still life that aims to deceive the viewer into mistaking painted objects for reality. When the catalogs of the two artists were posthumously analyzed, it was determined that &quot;many of [Peto&#x27;s] canvases received forged signatures of William Harnett.&quot;
Peto&#x27;s paintings, generally considered less technically skilled than Harnett&#x27;s, are more abstract, use more unusual color, and often have a stronger emotional resonance. Peto&#x27;s mature works have an opaque and powdery texture which is often compared to Chardin.

The subject matter of Peto&#x27;s paintings consisted of the most ordinary of things: pistols, horseshoes, bits of paper, keys, books, and the like. He frequently painted old time &quot;letter racks&quot;, which were a kind of board that used ribbons tacked into a square that held notes, letters, pencils, and photographs. Many of Peto&#x27;s paintings reinterpret themes Harnett had painted earlier, but Peto&#x27;s compositions are less formal and his objects are typically rustier, more worn, less expensive looking.
A pioneering study of Peto and Harnett is Alfred Frankenstein&#x27;s &quot;After the Hunt: William Harnett and Other American Still Life Painters, 1870-1900&quot;.

==John F. Peto Studio Museum==
The John F. Peto Studio Museum preserves the artist&#x27;s house and studio in Island Heights, New Jersey. Built in 1889, the house was mostly designed by the artist and remained in his family for over 100 years. Opened in 2011, the house has been furnished to appear as during Peto&#x27;s residency around the turn of the 20th century, and features reproductions of his paintings. Painter Abbey Ryan also teaches an annual professional painting workshop at the John F. Peto Studio Museum.

<text>A leotard () is a unisex skin-tight one-piece garment that covers the torso from the crotch to the shoulder. The garment was made famous by the French acrobatic performer Jules Léotard (1838–1870). There are sleeveless, short-sleeved, and long-sleeved leotards. A variation is the unitard, which also covers the legs. It provides a degree of modesty and style while allowing for freedom of movement.

Leotards are worn by acrobats, gymnasts, dancers, figure skaters, athletes, actors, wrestlers, and circus performers both as practice garments and performance costumes. They are often worn with ballet skirts on top and tights or sometimes bike shorts as underwear. As a casual garment, a leotard can be worn with a belt and under overalls or short skirts.

Leotards are entered by stepping into the legs and pulling the sleeves over the shoulders. Scoop-necked leotards have wide neck openings and are held in place by the garment&#x27;s elasticity. Others are crew necked or polo necked and close at the back of the neck with a zipper or snaps.

==Use==
Leotards are used for a variety of purposes, including yoga, exercise, dance (particularly for ballet and modern), as pajamas, for additional layered warmth under clothing, and recreational and casual wear. They may form a part of children&#x27;s dressing-up and play outfits and can also be worn as a top.

Leotards are commonly worn in figure skating, postwar modern dance, acrobatic rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll, traditional ballet and gymnastics, especially by young children. Practice leotards and those worn in podium training sessions are usually sleeveless. Female competition garments for gymnastics and skating are almost always long-sleeved. In contrast, male competition leotards may be sleeved or sleeveless, the latter more common in gymnastics, the former in figure skating. Leotards come in many styles — either with a full seated bottom or as a thong or T-front thong for maximum comfort and avoidance of visible panty lines when worn under leggings or tights.

==History==
The first known use of the name &quot;leotard&quot; came only in 1886, years after Jules Léotard&#x27;s death. Léotard called the garment a &quot;&quot;, a general French word for different types of tight-fitting shirts or sports shirts. In the early 20th century, leotards were mainly confined to circus and acrobatic shows, worn by the specialists who performed these acts.

Leotards influenced the style of swimsuit in the 1920s and 1930s, and women&#x27;s one-piece swimsuit today still resemble leotards in appearance.

Leotards are worn by professional dancers such as the showgirls of Broadway. Stage use of the leotard typically coordinates the garment with stockings or tights.

In the 1950s, traditionally-styled leotards continued to be worn mainly by stage performers and circus actors, but leotards began to be used as simple and functional exercise garments, often in institutional settings like schools and fitness training. These were almost always black and worn together with thick tights. Between 1950 and 1970, leotards remained as such in appearance until a style change in the 1970s, with more colorful leotards appearing on the scene, most often in ballet and exercise.

Leotards were a staple in aerobic exercise attire during the 1970s and 1980s, but their popularity waned in the 1990s as they were largely replaced by Lycra pants, similar to those worn by cyclists. By the 2000s, they had given way to trousers and leggings, which offered a more modern and flexible alternative. Nevertheless, leotards continue to be worn by female cyclists and athletes in competitive events, where their functionality and comfort remain valued.

In the late 2010s, leotards began to be frequently worn by pop stars in their performances, such as Beyonce, Little Mix, and Taylor Swift.

==Crossover to fashion activewear==
By the late 1970s, leotards had become common both as exercise and street wear, popularized by the disco craze, and aerobics fashion craze of the time. These leotards were produced in a variety of nylon and spandex materials, as well as the more traditional cotton previously used for uni-colored leotards and tights. Exercise videos by celebrities such as Jane Fonda also popularized the garment. The dancewear company Danskin flourished during this period, producing various leotards for both dance and streetwear. Other companies, such as Gilda Marx, produced leotards during this period and then ceased production when they ceased to be in fashion. By the late 1980s, leotards for exercise wear had become little more than bikini bottoms with straps over the shoulders, generally worn with cropped shirts. From the mid-1980s to mid 90s, leotards usually cap sleeved style or sometime in colder weather a long sleeved turtleneck style both popularly worn as tops with jeans especially skinny jeans and high waisted ankle length mom jeans, under shortalls or with casual or dress pants as part of everyday wear. They were also worn with skirts outfits. By the mid-1990s, leotards had been almost completely replaced for exercise wear by the sports bra and shorts.

==Gymnastics attire==
===Women===
For women, the standard gymnastic competition uniform is a leotard. Traditionally, competition leotards have always had long sleeves; however, half-length sleeved and sleeveless garments are now permitted under the &quot;Code of Points&quot; and have been worn by teams at the Gymnastics World Championships and other significant events. Practice leotards and those worn in podium training sessions are generally sleeveless.

In the 1970s, leotards were typically made from polyester and related fabrics. Since the 1980s, however, they have been made from lycra or spandex. Since the 1990s, leotards have become more elaborate and have employed a variety of textiles, including velvet, velour, mesh, metallic fabrics, foils, and iridescent &quot;hologram&quot; fabric. They can also be decorated with rhinestones and metallic jewels that are heat-set onto the garments and will not fall or wash off.

Leotards that conform to regulations cannot be cut above hip height or past the shoulder blades, back, or front. Any somewhat see-through leotard is also against the rules. Usage of white tights is not standard. In rare instances, gymnasts and teams have been penalized with score deductions for their attire.

===Men===
For competitions, male gymnasts wear two layers of clothing. The first, a singlet (or comp shirt, short for competition shirt), is a sleeveless garment like a leotard. For floor and vault, gymnasts wear a pair of very short shorts over the singlet. For their other events, they wear a pair of long pants attached to the bottom of their feet with stirrups.

Unlike women&#x27;s uniforms, which generally employ metallic or iridescent fabrics, men&#x27;s uniforms are usually matte-colored and less ornate. Singlets usually employ one or more of the national team colors, but there are no restrictions on design. Shorts and pants are generally solid, typically white, blue, red, or black.

===History===
Olympic gymnastics team leotards have dramatically changed from their first memorable designs. Over time, the emphasis on what leotards are intended to do has changed. Originally, the intent was to cover as much of a woman&#x27;s body as possible, while today, leotards must breathe, improve aerodynamics, and seamlessly re-shape as female athletes bend, twist, and contort their way through increasingly difficult routines.

==Men&#x27;s leotards==
When Léotard created the &quot;maillot&quot;, it was intended for men. This style of leotard can be seen in early 20th-century photos of the circus strong man. Men&#x27;s leotards evolved along with the women&#x27;s style, eventually resembling it, except that the men&#x27;s version had a slightly lower-cut leg opening and a lower-cut front.

Unlike their female counterparts, however, men&#x27;s leotards come in two styles—with a full seated bottom or as a thong. The reason for this is apparent when worn with tights, such as in ballet, where lines created by the garment underneath the tights may be considered unsightly. A dance belt is also worn in such instances.

Leotards are commonly worn by male dancers (particularly for ballet) and gymnasts. Leotard-like garments (often of the &quot;biketard&quot; or singlet type) are also often worn by men in sports such as rowing, wrestling, cycling, and running to maintain a tight fit and prevent the upper part of the clothing from running up.

During the Dangerous World Tour, American superstar Michael Jackson wore a gold leotard.

<text>Toufik Benedictus &quot;Benny&quot; Hinn (born 3 December 1952) is an Israeli-born Palestinian-American-Canadian televangelist, best known for his regular &quot;Miracle Crusades&quot;—revival meeting or faith healing summits that are usually held in stadiums in major cities, which are later broadcast worldwide on his television program, &quot;This Is Your Day&quot;.

==Biography==
Hinn was born in Jaffa, in 1952, in the then newly established state of Israel to parents born in Palestine who had Greek, Palestinian and Armenian heritage. He was raised within the Eastern Orthodox tradition and baptized by the patriarch of Jerusalem.

Soon after the 1967 Arab–Israeli War (&quot;The Six-Day War&quot;), Hinn&#x27;s family emigrated to Toronto, Ontario, Canada, in 1968 where he attended Georges Vanier Secondary School. He did not graduate. In his books, Hinn states falsely that his father was the mayor of Jaffa at the time of his birth and that he was socially isolated as a child and had a stutter, and he was a first-class student.

In 1972, he claimed to become a born-again Christian. Hinn has written that on 21 December 1973, he traveled by charter bus from Toronto to Pittsburgh to attend a &quot;miracle service&quot; conducted by evangelist Kathryn Kuhlman. Although he never met her personally, he often attended her &quot;healing services&quot; and has often cited her as an influence in his life. In 1974 he was invited to speak about his spiritual experience at Trinity Pentecostal Church in Oshawa and claimed to have been cured of his stuttering.

== Ministry ==
On moving to the United States, Hinn traveled to Orlando, Florida, where he founded the Orlando Christian Center in 1983. Eventually, he began claiming that God was using him as a conduit for healings, and began holding healing services in his church. These new &quot;Miracle Crusades&quot; were soon held at large stadiums and auditoriums across the United States and the world, the first nationally televised service being held in Flint, Michigan, in 1989. In 1990, he also launched a new daily talk show called &quot;This Is Your Day&quot;, which to this day airs clips of supposed miracles from Hinn&#x27;s Miracle Crusades. The program premiered on the Trinity Broadcasting Network of Paul Crouch, who would become one of Hinn&#x27;s most outspoken defenders and allies. Hinn&#x27;s ministry began to rapidly grow from there, winning praise as well as criticism from fellow Christian leaders. In 1999, he stepped down as pastor of the Orlando Christian Center, moving his ministry&#x27;s administrative headquarters to Grapevine, Texas, a suburb of Fort Worth, while hosting &quot;This Is Your Day&quot; from a television studio in Orange County, California, where he now lives with his family. His former church was renamed Faith World Church under the leadership of Clint Brown, who merged his Orlando church with Hinn&#x27;s.

Benny Hinn is the author of a number of Christian books. His thirty-minute TV program &quot;This Is Your Day&quot; is among the world&#x27;s most-watched Christian programs, seen on various Christian television networks, including Trinity Broadcasting Network, Daystar Television Network, Revelation TV, Grace TV, Vision TV, INSP Networks, and The God Channel.

Hinn conducts regular &quot;Miracle Crusades&quot;—revival meeting / faith healing events held in sports stadiums in major cities throughout the world. Tens of millions attend his Holy Spirit Miracle Crusades each year. Hinn claims to have spoken to one billion people through his crusades, including memorable crusades with attendance of 7.3 million people (in three services) in India, the largest healing service in recorded history. Evander Holyfield, who was diagnosed with a non-compliant left ventricle, has credited his healing to Benny Hinn, stating that through God working through Hinn, he was healed as he had &quot;a warm feeling&quot; go through his chest as Hinn touched him.

== Beliefs ==
Hinn&#x27;s teachings are charismatic (accepting the validity of spiritual gifts) and are Word of Faith in origin, with a focus on financial prosperity.

Hinn affirms belief in the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist.

== Missions ==
Benny Hinn Ministries claims to support 60 mission organizations across the world and several orphanages around the world, and claims to house and feed over 100,000 children a year and support 45,000 children daily because of his donors.

Benny Hinn Ministries donated $100,000 for relief supplies for Hurricane Katrina victims in 2005, and $250,000 to the tsunami relief effort in 2007.

==Criticism and controversy==
Some media have questioned the fact that Hinn has a stutter.

In March 1993 &quot;Inside Edition&quot; reported on Hinn&#x27;s $685,000 Orlando home and Mercedes-Benz, despite him having previously claimed a &quot;modest lifestyle&quot;. An employee of &quot;Inside Edition&quot; also faked a healing from cerebral palsy which was shown on Hinn&#x27;s regular broadcast.

A controversial aspect of Hinn&#x27;s ministry is his teaching on, and demonstration of, a phenomenon he dubs &quot;The Anointing&quot;—the power purportedly given by God and transmitted through Hinn to carry out supernatural acts. At his Miracle Crusades, he has allegedly healed attendees of blindness, deafness, cancer, AIDS, and severe physical injuries. However, investigative reports by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, NBC&#x27;s &quot;Dateline&quot;, CBC&#x27;s &quot;The Fifth Estate&quot;, and the Nine Network&#x27;s &quot;60 Minutes&quot; have called these claims into question.

Hinn has also caused controversy for theological remarks and claims he has made during TV appearances. In 1999, he appeared on the Trinity Broadcasting Network claiming that God had given him a vision predicting the resurrection of thousands of dead people after watching the network—laying out a scenario of people placing their dead loved ones&#x27; hands on TV screens tuned into the station—and suggesting that TBN would be &quot;an extension of Heaven to Earth&quot;.

In July 2024, the Trinity Foundation expressed skepticism about Hinn&#x27;s actual net worth, which various websites have alleged to be $60 million, noting the large drop in ratings for his TV viewership. In 2016, Trinity Broadcasting Network ceased airing Hinn&#x27;s TV program. Daystar Television Network dropped the program in 2017.

===&quot;A Question of Miracles&quot;===

In April 2001, HBO aired a documentary entitled &quot;A Question of Miracles&quot; that focused on Hinn and a well-documented fellow Word-of-Faith German minister based in Africa, Reinhard Bonnke. Both Hinn and Bonnke offered full access to their events to the documentary crew, and the documentary team followed seven cases of reputed miracle healings from Hinn&#x27;s crusade over the next year. The film&#x27;s director, Antony Thomas, told CNN&#x27;s Kyra Phillips that they did not find any cases where people were actually healed by Hinn. Thomas said in a &quot;New York Times&quot; interview that &quot;If I had seen miracles [from Hinn&#x27;s ministry], I would have been happy to trumpet it ... but in retrospect, I think they do more damage to Christianity than the most committed atheist.&quot;

===&quot;Do You Believe in Miracles&quot;===

In November 2004, the CBC Television show &quot;The Fifth Estate&quot; did a special titled &quot;Do You Believe in Miracles&quot; on the apparent transgressions committed by Hinn&#x27;s ministry.

With the aid of hidden cameras and crusade witnesses, the producers of the show demonstrated Hinn&#x27;s apparent misappropriation of funds, his fabrication of the truth, and the way in which his staff chose crusade audience members to come on stage to proclaim their miracle healings. In particular, the investigation highlighted the fact that the most desperate miracle seekers who attend a Hinn crusade—the quadriplegics, the brain-damaged, virtually anyone with a visibly obvious physical condition—are never allowed on stage; those who attempt to be in the line of possible healings are intercepted and directed to return to their seats.

At one Canadian service, hidden cameras showed a mother who was carrying her muscular dystrophy-afflicted daughter, Grace, being stopped by two screeners when they attempted to get into the line for a possible blessing from Hinn. The screeners asked the mother if Grace had been healed, and when the mother replied in the negative, they were told to return to their seats; the pair got out of line, but Grace, wanting &quot;Pastor Benny to pray for [her]&quot;, asked her mother to support her as she tried to walk as a show of &quot;her faith in action&quot;, according to the mother. After several unsuccessful attempts at walking, the pair left the arena in tears, both mother and daughter visibly upset at being turned aside and crying as they explained to the undercover reporters that all Grace had wanted was for Hinn to pray for her, but the staffers rushed them out of the line when they found out Grace had not been healed. A week later at a service in Toronto, Baptist evangelist Justin Peters who wrote his Masters in Divinity thesis on Hinn and has attended numerous Hinn crusades since 2000 as part of his research for his thesis and for a seminar he developed about the Word of Faith movement entitled &quot;A Call for Discernment&quot;, also demonstrated to the hidden cameras that &quot;people who look like me&quot;—Peters has cerebral palsy, walks with arm-crutches, and is obviously and visibly disabled—&quot;are &quot;never&quot; allowed on stage ... it&#x27;s always somebody who has some disability or disease that cannot be readily seen.&quot; Like Grace and her mother, Peters was quickly intercepted as he came out of the wheelchair section (there is one at every crusade, situated at the back of the audience far away from the stage and never filmed for Hinn&#x27;s TV show) in an attempt to join the line of those waiting to go onstage, and was told to take a seat.

===Ministry Watch issues &quot;Donor Alert&quot;===

In March 2005, Ministry Watch issued a Donor Alert against the ministry citing a lack of financial transparency among other possible problems. Benny Hinn Ministries is not a member of the Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability.

===Senate investigation===

In 2007, United States Senator Chuck Grassley announced an investigation of Hinn&#x27;s ministry by the United States Senate Committee on Finance. In a letter to BHM, Grassley asked for the ministry to divulge financial information to the Senate Committee on Finance to determine if Hinn made any personal profit from financial donations, and requested that Hinn&#x27;s ministry make the information available. The investigation also scrutinized five other televangelists: Paula White, Kenneth Copeland, Eddie L. Long, Joyce Meyer, and Creflo Dollar. In December 2007, Hinn said he would not respond to the inquiry until 2008. The ministry subsequently responded to the inquiry, and Grassley said that &quot;... Benny Hinn [has] engaged in open and honest dialogue with committee staff. They have not only provided responses to every question but, in the spirit of true cooperation, also have provided information over and above what was requested.&quot;

The investigation concluded in 2011 with no penalties or findings of wrongdoing. The final report raised questions about personal use of church-owned luxury goods and a lack of financial oversight on the ministries&#x27; boards, which are often populated with family and friends of the televangelist. Hinn&#x27;s group reported to the committee that it complied with tax regulations and had made changes in compensation and governance procedures.

===Prosperity theology===
In 2017, pastor Costi Hinn, a nephew of Hinn, came forward with a testimony of his time spent in Hinn&#x27;s ministry and what made him leave. In the testimony, Costi Hinn described the expensive cars and lavish houses that he and his family members owned, and the luxury that surrounded their travel. Costi Hinn criticized the prosperity gospel and teachings of his uncle, writing among other things that healings only seemed to work in the crusades, where music created an atmosphere, and that many of their prophecies contradicted the Bible. He has since written a book on the topic titled &quot;God, Greed, and the (Prosperity) Gospel&quot;. In the book, Costi Hinn calls the prosperity gospel &quot;damning and abusive&quot;, exploitative of the poor and vulnerable, and &quot;arguably the most hateful and abusive kind of false teaching plaguing the church today&quot;.

In September 2019, he said that Benny Hinn no longer believed in prosperity theology and decided to stop teaching it.

==Personal life==
Hinn married Suzanne Harthern on 4 August 1979. The couple have four children. She filed divorce papers in California&#x27;s Orange County Superior Court on 1 February 2010, citing &quot;irreconcilable differences&quot;.

In July 2010, Hinn and fellow televangelist Paula White were photographed leaving a hotel in Rome holding hands. Both Hinn and White denied allegations in the &quot;National Enquirer&quot; that the two were engaged in an affair. Hinn was sued in February 2011 by the Christian publishing house Strang Communications, which claimed that a relationship with White did occur and that Hinn had violated the morality clause of his contract with the company.

In May 2012, Hinn announced that he and Suzanne had begun reconciliation during the Christmas season of 2011, stating that the split had been caused by her addiction to prescription drugs and antidepressants and citing his busy schedule and lack of time for his wife and children. Benny and Suzanne remarried on 3 March 2013, at the Holy Land Experience theme park, in a traditional ceremony lasting over two hours and attended by approximately 1,000 well-wishers, including many visiting Christian leaders. Jack Hayford referred to the remarriage as &quot;a miracle of God&#x27;s grace&quot;. However, in July 2024, Suzanne would once again file for divorce, this time in the Hillsborough County Court in Tampa, Florida.

<text>Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI ) is an in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedure in which a single sperm cell is injected directly into the cytoplasm of an egg. This technique is used in order to prepare the gametes for the obtention of embryos that may be transferred to a maternal uterus. With this method, the acrosome reaction is skipped.

There are several differences between classic IVF and ICSI. However, the steps to be followed before and after insemination are the same. In terms of insemination, ICSI needs only one sperm cell per oocyte, while IVF needs 50,000–100,000. This is because the acrosome reaction has to take place and thousands of sperm cells have to be involved in IVF. Once fertilized, the egg is transformed into a pre-embryo and it has to be transferred to the uterus to continue its development.

The first human pregnancy generated by ICSI was carried out in 1991 by Gianpiero Palermo and his team.

==Round spermatid injection (ROSI)==

Round spermatid injection (ROSI) is a technique of assisted reproduction whereby a round spermatid is injected into oocyte cytoplasm in order to achieve fertilization. This technique can be used to enable genetic fatherhood to some men who have no spermatozoa in the ejaculate (azoospermia) and in whom spermatozoa cannot be obtained surgically from the testicles. This condition is called non-obstructive or secretory azoospermia, as opposed to obstructive azoospermia, in which complete sperm production does occur in the testicles, and potentially fertilizing spermatozoa can be obtained by testicular sperm extraction (TESE) and used for ICSI. In cases of nonobstructive (secretory) azoospermia, on the other hand, testicular sperm production is blocked at different stages of the process of sperm formation (spermatogenesis). In those men in whom spermatogenesis is blocked at the stage of round spermatids, in which meiosis has already been completed, these round cells can successfully fertilize oocytes after being injected into their cytoplasm.

Even though many technical aspects of ROSI are similar to those of ICSI, there are also significant differences between both techniques. In the first place, as compared to spermatozoa, round spermatids do not possess easily perceptible morphological characteristics and are immotile. Consequently, the distinction between round spermatids and other round cells of similar size, such as leukocytes, is not an easy task. Moreover, the distinction between living round spermatids, to be used in ROSI, and dead round spermatids, to be discarded, needs specific methods and skills, not required in the case of ICSI where sperm cell viability can be easily evaluated on the basis of sperm motility in most cases. The microinjection procedure for ROSI also differs slightly from that of ICSI, since additional stimuli are needed to ensure proper oocyte activation after spermatid injection. If all requirements for round spermatid selection and injection are successfully met, the injected oocytes develop to early embryos and can be transferred to the mother&#x27;s uterus to produce pregnancy.

The first successful pregnancies and births with the use of ROSI were achieved in 1995 by Jan Tesarik and his team. The clinical potential of ROSI in the treatment of male infertility due to the total absence of spermatozoa has been corroborated recently by a publication reporting on the postnatal development of 90 babies born in Japan and 17 in Spain. Based on the evaluation of the babies born, no abnormalities attributable to the ROSI technique have been identified.

==Indications==
This procedure is most commonly used to overcome male infertility problems, although it may also be used where eggs cannot easily be penetrated by sperm, and occasionally in addition to sperm donation.

It can be used in teratozoospermia, because once the egg is fertilized, abnormal sperm morphology does not appear to influence blastocyst development or blastocyst morphology. Even with severe teratozoospermia, microscopy can still detect the few sperm cells that have a &quot;normal&quot; morphology, allowing for optimal success rate.

Additionally, specialists use ICSI in cases of azoospermia (when there are no spermatozoa ejaculated but they can be found in testis), when valious spermatozoa (the name given to sperm samples taken to preservate fertility after chemotherapy) is available, or after previous irruptions in IVF cycles.

==Sperm selection==
Before performing ICSI, sperm &quot;in vitro&quot; selection and capacitation has to be done. Apart from the most common techniques of &quot;in vitro&quot; sperm capacitation (swim-up, density gradients, filtration and simple wash), some new techniques are useful and have advantages over older methods.

One of these new techniques is the use of microfluidic chips, like Zymot ICSI chip invented by Prof. Utkan Demirci.
This chip is a device that helps identify the highest quality spermatozoa for the ICSI technique. It reproduces the conditions of the vagina, resulting in a more natural spermatozoa selection. One of the main advantages of this method is spermatozoa quality, as the selected ones have better motility, morphology, little DNA fragmentation and less quantity of reactive oxygen species (ROS).

Another way to perform the selection is the MACS technique, which consists of tiny magnetic particles linked to an antibody (annexin V) which is able to identify more viable spermatozoa. When the semen sample is passed through a column with a magnetic field, apoptotic respermatozoa are retained in the column while the healthy ones are easily obtained at the bottom of it.

PICSI is another method derived from this one, the only difference is the selection process of the spermatozoa. In this case, they are placed on a plate containing drops of a synthetic compound similar to hyaluronic acid. We will know which spermatozoa are mature because they will bind to the HA drops. This is because only mature sperm have a receptor for hyaluronic acid, which they need because this acid can be found surrounding the oocytes, and sperm need to be able to bind to this acid and digest it in order to fertilize the oocyte. After the mature spermatozoa have been selected, they can be used for the microinjection of oocytes. Sperms selected by hyaluronic acid has about no effect on whether a live birth results, but may reduce miscarriage.

==History==

The first child born from a gamete micromanipulation (technique in which special tools and inverted microscopes are used that help embryologists to choose and pick an individual sperm for ICSI IVF) was a Singapore-born child in April 1989.

The technique was developed by Gianpiero Palermo at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel, in the Center for Reproductive Medicine headed by Paul Devroey and Andre Van Steirteghem. 
Actually, the discovery was made by a mistake.

The procedure itself was first performed in 1987, though it only went to the pronuclear stage. The first activated embryo by ICSI was produced in 1990, but the first successful birth by ICSI took place on January 14, 1992, after an April 1991 conception.

Sharpe &quot;et al&quot; comment on the success of ICSI since 1992 saying, &quot;[t]hus, the woman carries the treatment burden for male infertility, a fairly unique scenario in medical practice. ICSI&#x27;s success has effectively diverted attention from identifying what causes male infertility and focused research onto the female, to optimize the provision of eggs and a receptive endometrium, on which ICSI&#x27;s success depends.&quot;

==Procedure==
ICSI is generally performed following a transvaginal oocyte retrieval procedure to extract one or several oocytes from a woman.

In ICSI IVF, the male partner or a donor provides a sperm sample on the same day when the eggs are collected. The sample is checked in the lab, and if no sperm is present, doctors will extract sperm from the epididymis or testicle. The extraction of sperm from epididymis is also known as percutaneous epididymal sperm aspiration (PESA) and extraction of sperm from testicle is also known as testicular sperm aspiration (TESA). Depending on the total amount of spermatozoa in the semen sample, either low or high, it can be just washed or capacitated via swim-up or gradients, respectively. 

The procedure is done under a microscope using multiple micromanipulation devices (micromanipulator, microinjectors and micropipettes). A holding pipette stabilizes the mature oocyte with gentle suction applied by a microinjector. From the opposite side a thin, hollow glass micropipette is used to collect a single sperm, having immobilised it by cutting its tail with the point of the micropipette. The oocyte is pierced through the oolemma and the sperm is directed into the inner part of the oocyte (cytoplasm). The sperm is then released into the oocyte. The pictured oocyte has an extruded polar body at about 12 o&#x27;clock indicating its maturity. The polar body is positioned at the 12 or 6 o&#x27;clock position, to ensure that the inserted micropipette does not disrupt the spindle inside the egg. After the procedure, the oocyte will be placed into cell culture and checked on the following day for signs of fertilization.

In contrast, in natural fertilization sperm compete and when the first sperm penetrates the oolemma, the oolemma hardens to block the entry of any other sperm. Concern has been raised that in ICSI this sperm selection process is bypassed and the sperm is selected by the embryologist without any specific testing. However, in mid-2006 the FDA cleared a device that allows embryologists to select mature sperm for ICSI based on sperm binding to hyaluronan, the main constituent of the gel layer (cumulus oophorus) surrounding the oocyte. The device provides microscopic droplets of hyaluronan hydrogel attached to the culture dish. The embryologist places the prepared sperm on the microdot, selects and captures sperm that bind to the dot. Basic research on the maturation of sperm shows that hyaluronan-binding sperm are more mature and show fewer DNA strand breaks and significantly lower levels of aneuploidy than the sperm population from which they were selected. A brand name for one such sperm selection device is PICSI. A recent clinical trial showed a sharp reduction in miscarriage with embryos derived from PICSI sperm selection.

&#x27;Washed&#x27; or &#x27;unwashed&#x27; sperm may be used in the process.

Live birth rate are significantly higher with progesterone to assist implantation in ICSI cycles. Also, addition of a GNRH agonist has been estimated to increase success rates.
Ultra-high magnification sperm injection (IMSI) has no evidence of increased live birth or miscarriage rates compared to standard ICSI.

A new variation of the standard ICSI-procedure called Piezo-ICSI uses small axial mechanical pulses (Piezo-pulses) to lower stress to the cytoskeleton during zona pellucida and oolemma breakage. The procedure includes specialized Piezo actuators, microcapillaries, and filling medium to transfer mechanical pulses to the cell membranes. The Piezo technique itself was for example established for animal ICSI and animal ES cell transfer.

== Assisted zona hatching (AH) ==
People who have experienced repeatedly failed implantation, or whose experimental embryo has a thick zona pellucida (covering) around the embryo, have ideal candidates for assisted zona hatching. The procedure involves creating a hole in the zona to improve the chances of normal implantation of the embryo in the uterus.

=== Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) ===
PGD is a process in which one or two cells from an embryo on Day 3 or Day 5 are extracted and the cells genetically analyzed. Couples who are at a high risk of having abnormal number of chromosomes or who have an history of single gene defects or chromosome defects are ideal candidates for this procedure. It is used to diagnose a large number of genetic defects at present.

== Success or failure factors ==
One of the areas in which sperm injection can be useful is vasectomy reversal. However, potential factors that may influence pregnancy rates (and live birth rates) in ICSI include level of DNA fragmentation as measured e.g. by comet assay, advanced maternal age and semen quality. It is uncertain whether ICSI improves live birth rates or reduces the risk of miscarriage compared with ultra‐high magnification (IMSI) sperm selection.

A systematic meta-analysis of 24 estimates of DNA damage based on a variety of techniques concluded that sperm DNA damage negatively affects clinical pregnancy following ICSI.

Numerous biochemical markers were shown to be associated with oocyte quality for ICSI. For example, it was shown that after ICSI the follicular fluid of unfertilized oocytes contains high levels of cytotoxicity and oxidative stress markers, as Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase, catalase, and lipoperoxidation product 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) -protein conjugates.

==Complications==
There is some suggestion that birth defects are increased with the use of IVF in general, and ICSI specifically, though different studies show contradictory results. In a summary position paper, the Practice Committee of the American Society of Reproductive Medicine has said it considers ICSI safe and effective therapy for male factor infertility, but may carry an increased risk for the transmission of selected genetic abnormalities to offspring, either through the procedure itself or through the increased inherent risk of such abnormalities in parents undergoing the procedure.

There is not enough evidence to say that ICSI procedures are safe in females with hepatitis B in regard to vertical transmission to the offspring, since the puncture of the oocyte can potentially avail for vertical transmission to the offspring.

== Follow-up on fetus==
In addition to regular prenatal care, prenatal aneuploidy screening based on maternal age, nuchal translucency scan and biomarkers is appropriate. However, biomarkers seem to be altered for pregnancies resulting from ICSI, causing a higher false-positive rate. Correction factors have been developed and should be used when screening for Down syndrome in singleton pregnancies after ICSI, but in twin pregnancies such correction factors have not been fully elucidated. In vanishing twin pregnancies with a second gestational sac with a dead fetus, first trimester screening should be based solely on the maternal age and the nuchal translucency scan as biomarkers are significantly altered in these cases.

<text>The New Zealand Labour Party, also known simply as Labour (), is a centre-left political party in New Zealand. The party&#x27;s platform programme describes its founding principle as democratic socialism, while observers describe Labour as social democratic and pragmatic in practice. The party participates in the international Progressive Alliance. It is one of two major political parties in New Zealand, alongside its traditional rival, the National Party.

The New Zealand Labour Party formed in 1916 out of various socialist parties and trade unions. It is the country&#x27;s oldest political party still in existence. Alongside the National Party, Labour has alternated in leading governments of New Zealand since the 1930s. , there have been six periods of Labour government under 11 Labour prime ministers. The party has traditionally been supported by the working classes, Māori, Pasifika, and has had strongholds in inner cities and the Māori seats for much of its existence. Labour won the party vote in 71 out of 72 electorates in the , making it overwhelmingly the most successful political party of the MMP era. 

The party first came to power under prime ministers Michael Joseph Savage and Peter Fraser from 1935 to 1949, when it established New Zealand&#x27;s welfare state. It governed from 1957 to 1960, and again from 1972 to 1975. In 1974, prime minister Norman Kirk died in office, which contributed to a decline in party support. However, Labour won the popular vote in 1978 and 1981, with the first-past-the-post voting system preventing them from governing. Up to the 1980s, the party advocated a strong role for governments in economic and social matters. When it governed from 1984 to 1990, Labour&#x27;s emergent neoliberal faction had a strong influence; the party broke precedent and transformed the economy from a protectionist one through extensive deregulation. As part of Rogernomics, Labour privatised state assets and greatly reduced the role of the state, causing a party split in 1989. Labour prime minister David Lange also introduced New Zealand&#x27;s nuclear-free policy. After a significant defeat in the 1990 election, Labour&#x27;s neoliberal faction would largely defect from the party and form ACT New Zealand. Labour again became the largest party from 1999 to 2008, when it governed in coalition with, or based on negotiated support from, several minor parties; Helen Clark became the first Labour prime minister to secure a third full term in office. Clark&#x27;s government was marked by the creation of Kiwibank, a state-owned banking corporation; strong opposition to the Iraq War; and the foreshore and seabed controversy, which caused disillusioned Māori Labour MPs to split and create the Māori Party. 

In the 2017 election the party, under Jacinda Ardern, returned to prominence with its best showing since the 2005 general election, winning 36.9% of the party vote and 46 seats. On 19 October 2017, Labour formed a minority coalition government with New Zealand First, with confidence and supply from the Green Party. In the 2020 general election, Labour won in a landslide, winning an overall majority of 10 and 50.01% of the vote. In the 2023 election, Labour lost its majority to the National Party and subsequently returned to Opposition. , Chris Hipkins serves as the party&#x27;s leader, while Carmel Sepuloni is the deputy leader.
== History ==
===Background ===

The founding of the New Zealand Labour Party, on 7 July 1916 in Wellington, brought together a number of earlier socialist groups advocating proportional representation, the abolition of the country quota, the recall of members of Parliament, as well as the nationalisation of production and exchange. 

Despite the Labour Party&#x27;s Wellington origins, the West Coast town of Blackball is regarded as the &quot;spiritual home&quot; of the party, because it was the site of a miners&#x27; strike in 1908 that led to the founding of the first nationwide federation of trade unions (the &quot;Red Federation&quot;). The Labour Party was established by trade unions, among other groups, and the party identifies itself as part of the wider labour movement in New Zealand. The Labour Party has long been identified with red, a political colour traditionally affiliated with socialism and the labour movement.

=== Formation (1901–1916) ===

At the turn of the 20th century, the radical side of New Zealand working class politics was represented by the Socialist Party, founded in 1901. The more moderate leftists generally supported the Liberal Party. In 1905 a group of working-class politicians who were dissatisfied with the Liberal approach established the Independent Political Labour League (IPLL), which managed to win a seat in Parliament in the . At the same time, moderates contested as &quot;Lib-Lab&quot; candidates, aligning with the Liberal Party while enjoying the endorsement of the labour movement. This established the basic dividing line in New Zealand&#x27;s left-wing politics – the Socialists/IPLL tended to be revolutionary and militant, while the moderates focused instead on progressive reform. The process of unifying these sides into a single party was difficult, with tensions between different factions running strong.

In 1910 the Independent Political Labour League was relaunched as an organisation called the Labour Party (distinct from the modern party). Soon, however, the leaders of the new organisation decided that additional effort was needed to promote left-wing cooperation, and organised a &quot;Unity Conference&quot;. The Socialists refused to attend, but several independent labour activists agreed. The United Labour Party (ULP) was born.

Soon afterward, the labour movement went through the 1912 Waihi miners&#x27; strike, a major industrial disturbance prompted by radicals in the union movement. The movement split over supporting or opposing the radicals, and in the end, the conservative Reform Party government of William Massey suppressed the strike by force. In the strike&#x27;s aftermath, there was a major drive to end the divisions in the labour movement and to establish a united front. Accordingly, Walter Thomas Mills organised another Unity Conference, and this time the Socialists attended. The resulting group was named the Social Democratic Party.

Not all members of the United Labour Party accepted the new organisation, however, and some continued under their own banner. Gradually, however, the differences between the Social Democrats and the ULP Remnant broke down, and in 1915 they formed a unified caucus – both to oppose Reform better and to differentiate themselves from the Liberals. A year later yet another gathering took place. This time, all major factions of the labour movement agreed to unite, forming the Labour Party as it is today.

==== Electoral record of constituent parties pre–1916 Labour ====

=== Early years (1916–1935) ===
Almost immediately, the new Labour Party became involved in the acrimonious debate about conscription which arose during World War I. The party strongly opposed conscription, and several leading members – Peter Fraser, Harry Holland, Bob Semple and Paddy Webb – were jailed and expelled from Parliament for their stand against the war. The loss of leadership threatened to seriously destabilise the party, but the party survived. (Fraser, Semple and Webb later supported conscription in World War II.)

In its first real electoral test as a united party, the , Labour won eight seats – the party&#x27;s quick success shocked many conservatives. The eight seats compared with 47 for the governing Reform Party and 21 for the Liberal Party.

Although Labour had split with its more militant faction (which went on to form various socialist parties), it maintained what were at the time radical socialist policies. Labour&#x27;s &#x27;Usehold&#x27; policy on land was, in essence, the replacement of freehold tenure by a system of perpetual lease from the state, with all land-transfer conducted through the state (the full nationalisation of farmland). This policy proved unpopular with voters, and Labour dropped it, along with other more radical policies, in the course of the 1920s.
In the , Labour more than doubled its number of seats, winning seventeen. In the , it declined somewhat but had the consolation of soon overtaking the Liberals as the second-largest party. Labour leader Harry Holland became the official Leader of the Opposition on 16 June 1926, after the Eden by-election on 15 April elected Rex Mason (Labour) to replace James Parr (Reform), who had resigned. After the , however, the party was left in an advantageous position – the Reform Party had 28 seats and the new United Party (a revival of the Liberals) had 27 seats, and neither could govern without Labour support. Labour chose to back United, the party closest to its own views – this put an end to five terms (1912–1928) of Reform Party government.

In the early 1930s the rigours of the Great Depression brought Labour considerable popularity, but also caused tension between Labour and the United Party. In 1931 United passed a number of economic measures which Labour deemed hostile to workers, and the agreement between the two parties collapsed. United then formed a coalition government with Reform, making Labour the Opposition. The coalition retained power in the , but gradually, the public became highly dissatisfied with its failure to resolve the country&#x27;s economic problems. Harry Holland died in 1933 and his deputy, Michael Joseph Savage, became the Labour Party parliamentary leader. In the , the Labour Party gained a significant majority, gaining 53 seats to the coalition&#x27;s 19, and returned to government.

Several of the early Labour Party stalwarts were Australian-born: Alfred Hindmarsh, Harry Holland, Michael Joseph Savage, Bob Semple, Paddy Webb, Bill Parry and later Jerry Skinner, Mabel Howard, Hugh Watt, Jim Edwards and Dorothy Jelicich.

=== First Government (1935–1949) ===
Party leader Michael Joseph Savage became prime minister on 6 December 1935, marking the beginning of Labour&#x27;s first term in office. The new government quickly set about implementing a number of significant reforms, including a reorganisation of the social-welfare system and setting up the state housing scheme. Workers also benefited from the introduction of the forty-hour week, and legislation making it easier for unions to negotiate on their behalf. Savage himself was highly popular with the working classes, and his portrait could be found on walls in many houses around the country. At this time the Labour Party pursued an alliance with the Māori Rātana movement.

The parliamentary opposition, meanwhile, attacked the Labour Party&#x27;s more left-wing policies and accused it of undermining free enterprise and hard work. In May 1936, months after Labour&#x27;s first general election win, the Reform Party and the United Party took their coalition to the next step, agreeing to merge with each other. The combined organisation, named the National Party, would be Labour&#x27;s main rival in future years.
Labour also faced opposition within its own ranks. While the Labour Party had been explicitly socialist at its inception, it had gradually drifted away from its earlier radicalism. The death of the party&#x27;s former leader, the &quot;doctrinaire&quot; Harry Holland, had marked a significant turning-point in the party&#x27;s history. Some within the party, however, were displeased about the changing focus of the party. Most notably, John A. Lee. Lee, whose views were a mixture of socialism and social credit theory, emerged as a vocal critic of the party&#x27;s leadership, accusing it of behaving autocratically and of betraying the party&#x27;s rank and file. After a long and bitter dispute, the party executive expelled Lee from the party, who then established his own breakaway Democratic Labour Party.

Savage died in 1940 and Peter Fraser, who became Labour&#x27;s longest-serving prime minister, replaced him. Fraser became best-known as New Zealand&#x27;s head of government for most of World War II. In the post-war period, however, ongoing shortages and industrial problems cost Labour considerable popularity, and the National Party, under Sidney Holland, gained ground, although Labour was able to win the 1943 and 1946 elections. Eventually, in the , Labour suffered electoral defeat.

Fraser died shortly afterward, and was replaced by Walter Nash, the long-serving minister of finance. It would be some time before Labour would return to power; Nash lacked the charisma of his predecessors, and National won considerable support for opposing the &quot;industrial anarchy&quot; of the 1951 waterfront dispute. In the , however, Labour won a narrow majority of two seats, and returned to office.

=== Second Government (1957–1960) ===

Nash, Labour&#x27;s third prime minister, took office in late 1957. Upon coming to power, Labour decided that drastic measures were needed to address balance-of-payments concerns. This resulted in the highly unpopular 1958 &quot;Black Budget&quot; of Arnold Nordmeyer, the new minister of finance, which raised taxes on alcohol, cigarettes, cars, and petrol. It is widely thought to have doomed the party to defeat despite the economy rejuvenating less than a year after the adoption of the Black Budget. In the , the National Party returned to power.
The elderly Nash retired in 1963, suffering from ill health. Nordmeyer replaced him, but the taint of the Black Budget ensured that Nordmeyer did not have any appreciable success in reversing the party&#x27;s fortunes. In 1965 the leadership went to the younger Norman Kirk, who many believed would revitalise the party. Labour suffered defeat again in the next two elections, but in the , the party gained a significant majority over its rival.

=== Third Government (1972–1975) ===

Kirk proved an energetic prime minister and introduced a number of new policies. His foreign-policy stances included strong criticism of nuclear-weapons testing and of South Africa&#x27;s apartheid system. However, Kirk suffered from poor health, worsened by his refusal to slow the pace of his work. In 1974 Kirk was taken ill and died. Bill Rowling replaced him, but did not have the same electoral appeal – in the , Labour was heavily defeated by the National Party, then led by Robert Muldoon.
Rowling remained the leader of the Labour Party for some time after his defeat. In the and the Labour won a larger share of the vote than National but failed to win an equivalent number of seats. This led to a very heated debate on New Zealand&#x27;s electoral system, and precipitated the introduction of mixed-member proportional representation (MMP) fifteen years later. Rowling himself was compared by media unfavourably to Muldoon, and did not cope well with Muldoon&#x27;s aggressive style. In 1983 Rowling was replaced as parliamentary leader by David Lange, whom the parliamentary caucus perceived as more charismatic. In the snap election of , Labour decisively defeated the National Party.

=== Fourth Government (1984–1990) ===
When the Fourth Labour Government came into power it uncovered a fiscal crisis that had been largely hidden by the outgoing Third National Government. Government debt was skyrocketing, due largely to the costs of borrowing to maintain a fixed exchange-rate. When the result of the election became clear, Lange asked Muldoon to devalue the New Zealand dollar, which Muldoon refused to do, resulting in a constitutional crisis and precipitating some of the changes in the Constitution Act 1986.

The economic-policy agenda of the Fourth Labour Government differed significantly from previous Labour governments. The minister of finance, Roger Douglas, supported neoliberal theories, and sought to implement sweeping free-market reforms (dubbed &quot;Rogernomics&quot;) to the economy and to the tax system. This involved floating the New Zealand dollar, cutting government spending, reducing taxes and removing almost all industry subsidies. The government also revolutionised New Zealand&#x27;s foreign policy, making the country a nuclear-free zone, which resulted in suspension from the ANZUS alliance. Labour liberalised immigration policy and promoted migration from Asia.

Other innovations during the term of the Fourth Labour Government included extending the jurisdiction of the Waitangi Tribunal back to 1840 (the date of the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi); the Homosexual Law Reform Act 1986, which legalised homosexual relations; and the Bill of Rights Act, which enumerated civil and political rights. Throughout its first term (1984–1987), the Labour government remained largely unified behind the enacted radical financial, economic and social policy reforms, but early signs of dissension began to appear before the 1987 election.

In Labour won another considerable election victory against the National Party, while ruptures over the direction of policy remained concealed. Labour took votes in affluent seats where it had never come remotely close to winning even at high-tide elections. In the biggest shock of all, it came within 400 votes of taking thr blue-ribbon seat of Remuera off National. At the same time, Labour suffered negative swings in more traditional seats. The government&#x27;s second term (1987–1990), with an increased Labour majority won on the back of Lange&#x27;s anti-nuclear stance, saw emerging divisions over economic policy arising within Cabinet. Ministers debated the extent and pace of further reforms, and there was disillusion among party members and supporters loyal to Labour&#x27;s left-wing tradition. The Council of Trade Unions criticised the Labour Party. One vocal member of Parliament critical of government policy, former Party President Jim Anderton, departed to establish the NewLabour Party, which later became a part of the left-wing Alliance Party. At the same time Roger Douglas and Lange fought intermittent battles inside Cabinet, with Douglas wanting to expand his economic programme dramatically. Lange strongly opposed a flat-tax proposal from Douglas and moved to sack him, resulting in political clashes throughout 1988 and the departure of Douglas from the Cabinet in December 1988. After the Labour Caucus re-elected Douglas to Cabinet on 3 August 1989, Lange resigned from office himself (8 August 1989), interpreting Douglas&#x27;s reappointment as a vote of no confidence in his leadership.

Geoffrey Palmer became the new prime minister. However, Palmer failed to rebuild the shattered remnants of Lange&#x27;s government and in September 1990, Mike Moore replaced him. Despite Moore&#x27;s ascension somewhat salvaging poll-ratings, Labour suffered its worst defeat since it first took office in 1935 (losing twenty-eight seats) as voters flung it into the political wilderness in a massive landslide. National swept to power, seemingly repudiating the Lange/Douglas program, but then engaged in even more radical policies than Labour had contemplated. Political disillusionment caused by both governments was to be instrumental in the later adoption of mixed-member proportional representation (MMP) in 1993 (implemented in 1996).

Moore himself, despite recovering sixteen seats at the 1993 election, was replaced by Helen Clark in December 1993. Clark led the party in opposition to the National government for six years under the administrations of Jim Bolger (1993–1997) and Jenny Shipley (1997–1999). During this period in opposition, the party made a measured repudiation of Rogernomics, although it has never returned to its original leftist roots (Labour&#x27;s contemporary position is left-of-centre). When the , the first conducted under the MMP electoral system, gave the balance of power to the centrist New Zealand First party, many believed that Labour would return to power, but in the end New Zealand First formed a coalition arrangement with the National Party. Despite initially appearing coherent, the coalition became increasingly unstable and eventually collapsed, leaving the National Party to govern as a minority government from 1998 to 1999.

=== Fifth Government (1999–2008) ===
After the , a minority coalition government of Labour and the Alliance took power, supported by the Green Party with Helen Clark becoming New Zealand&#x27;s second female prime minister. This government, while undertaking a number of reforms, was not particularly radical when compared to previous Labour governments, and maintained a high level of popularity. The Alliance, however, fell in popularity and split internally. Clark cited the Alliance split as one of the reasons for calling the several months early; Labour won comfortably.

Policies of the Fifth Labour Government included the KiwiSaver scheme, the Working for Families package, increasing the minimum wage 5% a year, interest-free student loans, the establishment of district health boards, the introduction of a number of tax credits, overhauling the secondary-school qualifications system by introducing the NCEA, and the introduction of fourteen weeks&#x27; parental leave. Labour also supported the Civil Union Act 2004, which legalised civil unions for same-sex and opposite-sex couples.

The foreign policy of the Fifth Labour Government strongly reflected liberal internationalist doctrine, with a particular emphasis on promoting democracy and human rights, advocating for antimilitarism and disarmament, and encouragement of free trade. In 2003, the government opposed New Zealand military action in the Iraq War. 

In early 2004 Labour came under attack in the foreshore and seabed controversy. Significant internal tensions within the party eventually culminated in the resignation of junior minister Tariana Turia and her establishment of the new Māori Party.
Following the , Labour formed a minority coalition with the Progressive Party (breakaway party of the old Alliance), and entered into complex confidence and supply agreements with the centrist United Future and populist New Zealand First parties, which gave each party&#x27;s leader a ministerial portfolio, while the support parties remained outside the Cabinet. A limited support agreement also linked Labour with the Green Party, giving certain policy concessions to the Greens in return for abstention on confidence-and-supply votes. Labour lost power when the National Party soundly defeated it in the .

=== In opposition (2008–2017) ===

Following the loss to the National Party in the November 2008 election, Helen Clark stood down as leader of the party – Phil Goff succeeded her (serving from 2008–2011). Labour had a relatively high turnover of four leaders during its most recent term in opposition; journalist Nicky Hager has attributed this to Labour&#x27;s reaction to changes within public media and the political environment. Goff led Labour into a second electoral defeat in and was succeeded by David Shearer, who led the Labour parliamentary from 2011 to 2013. 

Shearer resigned after losing the confidence of caucus. David Cunliffe (2013–2014) assumed the leadership after the 2013 leadership election in which, under new rules, members and unions held 60% of the vote. Most of the Labour caucus disliked Cunliffe, but he had strong support from the party membership. In the leadership contest he won first-preference votes from only one-third of Labour MPs. 

Cunliffe&#x27;s tenure as leader quickly became mired in internal disputes and falling poll-ratings. Labour went on to suffer its worst electoral reversal since 1922 at the election, Cunliffe opted to resign after initially wishing to re-contest the leadership. His replacement, Andrew Little (2014–2017), then resigned in 2017 following new polling showing the party sinking to a record low result of 24%, with internal voices hoping that rising star Jacinda Ardern would take over in his stead. 

The caucus confirmed Ardern as the new Labour leader (2017–2023). After Ardern&#x27;s election to its parliamentary leadership Labour rose dramatically in opinion polls. By late August they had risen to 43% in one poll (having been 24% under Little&#x27;s leadership), as well as managing to overtake National in opinion polls for the first time in over a decade.

=== Sixth Government (2017–2023) ===

During the , Labour gained 36.6% of the party vote and increased its presence in the House of Representatives to 46 seats, making it the second-largest party in Parliament. On 19 October 2017, New Zealand First leader Winston Peters announced that his party would form a coalition government with Labour, citing changing international and internal economic circumstances as the reasoning behind his decision, coupled with a belief that a Labour government was best-placed to handle the social and economic welfare of New Zealanders in a global environment that was undergoing rapid and &quot;seismic&quot; change. This coalition, combined with confidence and supply from the Green Party, saw Labour return to government for the first time since 2008. Ardern became prime minister, with Peters as her deputy.

The Labour government pledged to eliminate child poverty, make tertiary education free, reduce immigration by 20,000 to 30,000, decriminalise abortion, and make all rivers swimmable within 10 years. Notable policies, programmes and legislation during the 2017–2020 term included scrapping the previous National Government&#x27;s national standards in schools and charter schools, the KiwiBuild affordable housing programme, restricting oil and gas exploration, banning semi-automatic firearms, restoring voting rights for prisoners serving less than three years and decriminalising abortion. The Labour Government also adopted an elimination approach towards the COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand, instituting lockdowns and closing the border. Both Labour and Prime Minister Ardern attracted high domestic poll ratings due to their initial COVID-19 responses in 2020.

In mid-July 2020, the Serious Fraud Office announced that it was investigating donations made to the Labour Party by two Chinese businessmen during the 2017 general election. Labour Party President Claire Szabó announced that the party would co-operate with the investigation. The 2017–2020 term saw several ministerial resignations for various indiscretions, notably Phil Twyford, Clare Curran, Meka Whaitiri and David Clark.

In the , Labour gained 50% of the party vote and increased its presence in the House of Representatives to 65 seats, marking the first time that a party has won enough seats to govern alone since the introduction of the MMP system in 1996. Described as a &quot;landslide&quot; victory in which the party won the party vote in &quot;virtually every single electorate&quot;, Labour is believed to have gained support from swing voters, many of whom had previously voted for National under John Key. On 20 October, Newshub reported that Ardern was not intending to forge a formal coalition with the Green Party but was exploring the possibility of a lower-level support arrangement due to Labour&#x27;s large parliamentary majority. Following prolonged negotiations, the Green Party agreed to enter into a cooperation agreement with the Labour Party on 31 October and received two ministerial portfolios in return. Despite this landslide victory Labour faced criticism from economists due to the government&#x27;s lack of action on New Zealand&#x27;s housing affordability crisis, despite it being a key feature of Labour&#x27;s 2017 election campaign.

Notable policies, programmes and legislations during the 2020–2023 term included the Clean Car rebate programme, making the Māori New Year Matariki a public holiday, banning conversion therapy, replacing the district health boards with a national health service called Te Whatu Ora (Health New Zealand), passing smokefree legislation banning the sale of tobacco to anyone born after 1 January 2009, repealing &quot;three strikes&quot; legislation, and banning live animal exports. In terms of foreign policy, the Labour Government supported Ukraine following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, sanctioned Russia, signed free trade agreements with both the United Kingdom and European Union, and advocated restraint in response to the Israel-Hamas War. 

The Government also implemented several co-governance arrangements in the public sector including entrenching Māori wards and constituencies in local government, the Three Waters reform programme, and creating Te Aka Whai Ora (the Māori Health Authority). Following a major COVID-19 outbreak in August 2021, the Labour Government abandoned its elimination strategy and gradually eased lockdown, border restrictions, vaccine mandates and masking requirements between 2021 and 2022. During that period, growing opposition to lockdowns and vaccine mandates led to the emergence of several anti-vaccination protest groups including Voices for Freedom and Brian Tamaki&#x27;s The Freedoms and Rights Coalition, culminating in the 2022 occupation of Parliament&#x27;s grounds.

On 19 January 2023, Ardern announced her resignation as party leader and therefore prime minister. In the resultant leadership election Chris Hipkins was the only candidate and was confirmed as the new Labour leader on 22 January. Hipkins&#x27; premiership saw a shift in focus to &quot;cost of living issues&quot; and a &quot;policy bonfire&quot; that saw the scrapping or revision of several Government policies and initiatives including the planned merger of public broadcasters RNZ and TVNZ, a biofuel mandate, lowering the voting age to 16 years and the Clean Car Upgrade programme. Hipkins&#x27; government also responded to two natural disasters, the 2023 Auckland Anniversary Weekend floods and Cyclone Gabrielle, which devastated Auckland and the east coast of the North Island. Prior to the dissolution of Parliament, the Labour Government passed two laws as part of efforts to replace the Resource Management Act 1991.

The 2020–2023 term saw the expulsion of Labour MP Gaurva Sharma, the resignations of ministers Stuart Nash and Kiri Allan, and ministers Michael Wood and Jan Tinetti being disciplined by Parliament&#x27;s privileges committee. The 2023 NZ general election, held on 14 October 2023, saw the Labour government lose its majority to the opposition National Party. Based on final results, Labour&#x27;s share of the popular vote declined to 26.91% while its share of Parliamentary seats dropped to 34.

=== In opposition, 2023–present===
In early November 2023, caretaker Prime Minister Chris Hipkins was re-elected as leader of the Labour Party and Carmel Sepuloni was elected as deputy leader. In early 2024, three veteran Labour MPs Kelvin Davis, Rino Tirikatene and Grant Robertson resigned from Parliament, allowing Shanan Halbert, Tracey McLellan and Glen Bennett to re-enter Parliament via the party list. In April 2024, Labour called for New Zealand to recognise Palestinian statehood. In February 2024, two Labour MPs questioned whether New Zealand should be entering the non-nuclear component of the AUKUS, with foreign affairs spokesperson Phil Twyford describing it as an &quot;offensive warfighting alliance against China.&quot; At the Labour Party&#x27;s annual conference in 2024, held between 29 November and 1 December, Chris Hipkins announced that under a Labour government, New Zealand would not be a part of AUKUS, saying that any government he leads would &quot;restore New Zealand&#x27;s proudly independent foreign policy.&quot; 

== Ideology ==
The New Zealand Labour Party&#x27;s founding 1916 policy objectives called for &quot;the socialisation of the means of production, distribution and exchange&quot;, including state ownership of major parts of the economy, and increased rights for workers. While the socialist objective attracted support from some members, it also became a target for opponents who portrayed Labour as an extremist party. In the aftermath of World War II, Labour prioritised national unity over societal divisions, but after their defeat in , many party members perceived the socialist objective as outdated and a hindrance to electoral success, leading to its abolition in 1951. The party transformed into a moderate social-democratic party, focusing on reform within the democratic framework while maintaining ties with trade unions. 

By the late 1980s, the Labour Party had undergone significant ideological changes, leading to policies that frequently conflicted with the goals and interests of the union movement. The Labour Government of the 1980s deviated sharply from a social-democratic path; in a series of economic reforms, the government removed a swathe of regulations and subsidies, privatised state assets, and introduced corporate practices to state services.

The party&#x27;s constitution and platform programme maintains its founding principle as democratic socialism, while observers describe Labour&#x27;s policies as social-democratic and pragmatic in practice. From the 1990s onwards, Labour has again aimed to use the power of the state to try to achieve a &quot;fairer and more equal society&quot;, based on a mixed economy in which both the state and private enterprise play a part. Subsequently, the party has also been described as embracing certain social-liberal policies.

=== Principles ===
According to its current constitution, the party accepts democratic socialist principles, including:
* The management of New Zealand&#x27;s natural resources for the benefit of all, including future generations.
* Equal access to all social, economic, cultural, political, and legal spheres, regardless of wealth or social position.
* Co-operation as the main governing factor in economic relations, to ensure a just distribution of wealth.
* Universal rights to dignity, self-respect, and the opportunity to work.
* The right to wealth and property, subject to the provisos of regarding people as always more important than property and the obligations of the state to ensure a just distribution of wealth.
* Honouring / the Treaty of Waitangi as the founding document of New Zealand.
* The promotion of peace and social justice throughout the world by international co-operation.
* Equality in human rights regardless of race, sex, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, religious faith, political belief or disability.

=== Voter base ===
Historically, the party drew upon a stable sectional voter base comprising the urban working class, predominantly manual labourers and trade unionists. From the 1930s onwards, Labour has increasingly positioned itself as a broad-based party by responding and adapting to different social and economic problems and changing demographics (appealing to an expanding migrant population and a diversified ethnic, social make-up). Beginning in the 1980s, there was a shift away from class-issues and towards the promotion of individual freedoms, particularly for members of disadvantaged groups such as women and Māori. The modern party&#x27;s core support base lies among young people, urban workers, civil servants, and minorities (particularly the Māori and Pasifika communities).

== Organisation ==
=== Party structure ===
==== General and special branches ====
Party membership is tied into geographically-based branches in each parliamentary electorate. General branches must consist of at least 10 members aged 15 or over. Members may also form special branches where they have a special community of interest (such as university students and academics, young people, women, Māori people, Pasifika, multicultural groups, people with disabilities, the LGBT community, and industrial workers). Influential branches include Princes Street Labour (this Auckland university branch is described as the &quot;ideological powerhouse of the party&quot;, and has contributed many prominent Labour politicians) and Vic Labour (the Victoria University of Wellington branch).
Membership figures are rarely released to the public. Full (non-affiliate) membership is known to have peaked at 55,000 in 1976. During the 1980s and 1990s, party membership plummeted to levels not seen since before the First Labour Government. This decline might be attributed to disillusionment on the part of some members with the economic policies of the Fourth Labour Government (&quot;Rogernomics&quot;). Membership figures began to recover under Helen Clark&#x27;s leadership, with 14,000 members recorded in 2002.

==== Conference, councils and committees ====
Delegates from all branches in the electorate, together with delegates from affiliated unions, make up the Labour Electorate Committee (LEC). The LEC is responsible for party organisation in the electorate. The party is divided into six regional areas, which each year convene a Regional Conference. Policy and other matters are debated and passed onto the Annual Conference.

The Annual Conference (called Congress in election years) is the supreme governing body of the Labour Party when it is in session. All constituent bodies of the party are entitled to send delegates to Annual Conference.

The New Zealand Council is the Labour Party&#x27;s governing executive. It ensures that the party is governed effectively according to its constitution. The NZ Council consists of the president, two senior vice presidents (one of which must be Māori), three vice presidents (representing women, affiliates, and Pacific Islanders), seven regional representatives, one Policy Council representative, three Caucus representatives, and the general secretary.

The Policy Council, responsible for the development of the policy platform and election manifesto, is elected for a three-year term following each general election. The party structure also provides for Special Interest Group Councils: representing the affiliates, women&#x27;s issues, Māori issues, Pacific Islands, primary industries, local government, and youth.
==== Caucus and parliamentary leadership ====

The elected members representing the Labour Party in the House of Representatives meet as the Parliamentary Labour Party, also called the Caucus. The current parliamentary leader is Chris Hipkins (since 22 January 2023). A leadership election is triggered upon the vacancy of the position of leader or a motion of no confidence. Candidates are nominated from within the Caucus. Under Labour Party rules, party members have 40% of the votes, MPs have another 40% of the votes, and affiliated unions have 20% of the votes. Some observers have criticised the influence of the unions in leadership elections.

=== Affiliated trade unions ===
In the first decades of the 20th century, manufacturing industries grew strongly in New Zealand&#x27;s main cities and union membership also increased. The Labour Party was formed in this period as the political wing of the labour movement and was financed by trade unions. Since then, the unions have retained close institutional links with the party. In 2023 there were 11 affiliated unions, which paid a levy to the party based on the size of their own memberships. Generally, members of these unions are also affiliated members of the Labour Party. Affiliates receive a percentage of the vote in party leadership elections. 

In addition, the president of the New Zealand Council of Trade Unions continues to speak at the Labour Party Annual Conference.

=== Young Labour ===

Young Labour is the party&#x27;s youth wing. It exists to organise young party members (and young members of affiliated unions) aged under 30, and encourage wider involvement of young New Zealanders in centre-left politics. Young Labour is the most active sector in the Labour Party and plays a significant role in policy development and campaign efforts. It is endearingly called the &quot;conscience of the party&quot;.

In March 2018, it was reported that four people under 16 were allegedly sexually assaulted at a Young Labour summer camp in February. The camp was said to have &quot;mountains of alcohol&quot;, and people under the legal drinking age of 18 were said to have consumed alcohol. Although Young Labour and the Labour Party were aware of the allegations, party leadership failed to tell the Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern. The party offered counselling and support after the allegations were publicly reported. An independent review into the party&#x27;s conduct and sexual assault complaint policy was announced by Party President Nigel Haworth, and was completed late August. The party has declined to release the report to the public.

=== Local government ===
Labour Party members, including current and former MPs, have contested various local government positions throughout New Zealand during local body elections. While several have stood as Labour Party candidates, others have contested the elections as independent politicians. 

====Auckland====
Labour has contested the Auckland local body elections alongside City Vision, a left-leaning electoral ticket representing the local Labour, Green parties and other progressives. Following the 2022 Auckland local elections, the Auckland Council had four councillors serving under the Labour ticket and one serving under the affiliated City Vision ticket. In addition, 26 Labour Party candidates were elected to local community boards across Auckland while four Labour candidates were elected to local licensing trusts in the Auckland Region. Meanwhile, seven City Vision local board members and three City Vision liquor licensing trust members were also elected.

Former Labour MP and cabinet minister Phil Goff served as mayor of Auckland for two terms between 2016 and 2022.

====Christchurch====
In Christchurch, former Labour MP and cabinet minister Lianne Dalziel served for three terms as mayor between 2013 and 2022. She ran as an independent 

Within the Christchurch City Council, Labour maintains an umbrella, including community independents called The People&#x27;s Choice (formerly Christchurch 2021). During the 2019 Christchurch local elections, People&#x27;s Choice candidates held 10 community board seats, seven council seats, and several community board chairmanships.

====Dunedin====
On 26 February 2016, Dunedin city councillor and former Labour MP David Benson-Pope announced that he would be contesting the Dunedin local elections in October under the &quot;Local Labour&quot; ticket. While still a Labour Party member, Benson Pope had stood in the 2013 local elections as an independent candidate. This report coincided with the dissolution of the city&#x27;s main local body ticket, the centre-left Greater Dunedin group. On 20 April, it was reported that the Labour Party had dropped its plan to field a bloc of candidates in the 2016 Dunedin elections. However, the party has not ruled out endorsing other candidates. 

During the 2019 local elections, Steve Walker and Marian Hobbs were elected to the Dunedin City Council and Otago Regional Council respectively on Labour Party tickets. Hobbs subsequently resigned from the Otago Regional Council in November 2021.

During the 2022 Dunedin local elections, Steve Walker and Joy Davis stood as Labour candidates for the Dunedin City Council. While Walker was re-elected, Davis failed to win a seat.

====New Plymouth====
In New Plymouth, former MP Harry Duynhoven served as mayor from 2010 to 2013, when he was defeated by Andrew Judd. 

====Palmerston North====
Beginning in 2016, the Labour Party began contesting the Palmerston North local elections, ending a long tradition of keeping national party political affiliations out of local government bodies. During the 2016 local elections, Lorna Johnson was elected on the Labour Party ticket to the Palmerston North City Council. During the 2019 local elections, she was joined by Zulfiqar Butt, who also stood on the Labour ticket. During the 2022 local elections, Johnson was re-elected to the Palmerston North City Council but Butt was defeated.

====Rotorua====
Former electorate then Labour list MP Steve Chadwick, was elected as mayor of Rotorua in the 2013 elections. She stood as an independent. She served for three terms before resigning in 2022.

====Wellington Region====
During the 2022 Wellington local elections, four Labour Party councillors were elected: Ben McNulty – Northern Ward, Rebecca Matthews – Onslow-Western Ward, Teri O&#x27;Neill – Eastern Ward, and Nureddin Abdurahman – Southern Ward. Labour MP Paul Eagle unsuccessfully contested the 2022 Wellington City mayoral election but came third place.

Daran Ponter of the Wellington City ward on the Greater Wellington Regional Council was the only councillor to have been re-elected on a Labour ticket during the 2022 Wellington local election.

Campbell Barry has been the mayor of Lower Hutt since 2019 and was re-elected on the Labour ticket along with Wainuiomata ward councilor Keri Brown during the 2022 Hutt City Council elections.

====Whanganui====
In Whanganui, Labour member Hamish McDouall served two terms as mayor until he was defeated by Andrew Tripe during the 2022 local elections. McDouall had previously contested the seat of Whanganui for the party. McDouall ran on an independent ticket.

==Electoral performance==
===House of Representatives===

: Labour did not contest every electorate until 1946, when it stood candidates in all 80 electorates. According to the National Executive reports, the number of official candidates in 1919 is uncertain (53 or possibly 46). The party ran 41 candidates in 1922; 56 in 1925; 55 in 1928; 53 in 1931; 70 in 1935; 78 in 1938; and 77 in 1943. Labour did not run against independent candidates who voted with Labour, such as Harry Atmore in Nelson and David McDougall in Mataura, Southland. Labour did not run candidates against the two Country Party candidates in 1935, but did in 1938, when both candidates were defeated.

===Māori electorates===
== Leadership ==

The Labour Party has had 17 leaders, 11 of whom have served as prime minister. To date, Helen Clark served longest as leader of the Labour Party. While some dispute exists as to when Harry Holland officially became leader, Clark had passed his longest possible leadership term by 26 October 2008.

<doc id="153196" wikidata="Q443510" url="?curid=153196" title="Hesychius of Alexandria">
<text>Hesychius of [[Alexandria]] () was a Greek grammarian who, probably in the 5th or 6th century AD, compiled the richest lexicon of unusual and obscure Greek words that has survived, probably by absorbing the works of earlier lexicographers. 

The work, titled &quot;Alphabetical Collection of All Words&quot; (, &quot;Synagōgē Pasōn Lexeōn kata Stoicheion&quot;), includes more than 50,000 entries, a copious list of peculiar words, forms and phrases, with an explanation of their meaning, and often with a reference to the author who used them or to the district of Greece where they were current. Hence, the book is of great value to the student of the Ancient Greek dialects and in the restoration of the text of the classical authors generallyparticularly of such writers as Aeschylus and Theocritus, who used many unusual words. Hesychius is important, not only for Greek philology, but also for studying lost languages and obscure dialects of the Balkans in antiquity (such as Albanoid and Thracian) and in reconstructing Proto-Indo-European. Many of the words that are included in this work are not found in surviving ancient Greek texts.

Hesychius&#x27; explanations of many epithets and phrases also reveal many important facts about the religion and social life of the ancients.

In a prefatory letter Hesychius mentions that his lexicon is based on that of Diogenianus (itself extracted from an earlier work by Pamphilus), but that he has also used similar works by the grammarian Aristarchus of Samothrace, Apion, Heliodorus, Amerias and others.

Hesychius was probably not a Christian. Explanations of words from Gregory Nazianzus and other Christian writers (&quot;glossae sacrae&quot;) are later interpolations.

The lexicon survives in one deeply corrupt 15th-century manuscript, which is preserved in the Library of Saint Mark at Venice (Marc. Gr. 622, 15th century). It was first printed in 1514 by Marcus Musurus (at the press of Aldus Manutius) in Venice (it was later reprinted in 1520 and 1521 with modest revisions). A modern edition has been published under the auspices of the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen, begun by Kurt Latte (vol. 1 published in 1953, vol. 2 posthumously in 1966) and completed by Peter Allan Hansen and Ian C. Cunningham (vol. 3, 2005, vol. 4, 2009).

The construction of the periodic table ignores these irregularities and is based on ideal electron configurations.
* &quot;Note the non-linear shell ordering, which comes about due to the different energies of smaller and larger shells.&quot;

<text>Hanover Region () is a district in Lower Saxony, Germany. It is bounded by (from the north and clockwise) the districts of Heidekreis, Celle, Gifhorn, Peine, Hildesheim, Hameln-Pyrmont, Schaumburg and Nienburg.

The Hanover Region district has a unique legal status among the districts of Lower Saxony. It includes the city of Hanover (the state capital) which has the same privileges as a , a city that is not part of a district. As a consequence, the district is much larger in population than any other district of the state. Its administrative body is the regional parliament (), headed by the regional president (), which since 2021 is Steffen Krach (SPD). The members of the regional parliament are elected once every five years and the regional president is elected also every five years in local elections.

==History==
The city of Hanover was not part of the district until 2001, when the old Hanover District () and the city then known officially as District-free City of Hanover () were merged in order to form the new Hanover Region district, not to be confused with the former governmental district of Hanover ().

During World War II, Hanover was the headquarters () of Military District XI (), which was responsible for Braunschweig, Anhalt, and part of Hanover. It was also the garrison town for the 71st Infantry Division of the German Army.

==Geography==
The district surrounds the city of Hanover and includes the outskirts of its metropolitan area. The Leine river enters the district in the south, runs through Hanover and leaves to the north. In the northwest is the Steinhuder Meer, a lake with an area of , within the region known as the Hanoverian Moor Geest.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms was granted on May 1, 2003. The cloverleaf is from the arms of the city of Hanover. The lion was the heraldic animal of the Welfen family, which ruled the region from the Middle Ages until 1866.

<text>The Leine (; Old Saxon &quot;Lagina&quot;) is a river in Thuringia and Lower Saxony, Germany. It is a left tributary of the Aller and the Weser and is long.

The river&#x27;s source is located close to the town of Leinefelde in Thuringia. About downriver, the river enters Lower Saxony and runs northwards.

Important towns along its course, from upstream to downstream, are Göttingen, Einbeck, Freden, Alfeld, and Gronau, before the river enters Hanover, the largest city on its banks. Downstream some north of Hanover, near Schwarmstedt, the river joins the Aller and reaches the North Sea via the Weser. Its northern (lower) reaches are only navigable today by the smallest commercial carriers, though in the past, it served as an important pre-railway barge transport artery as far upriver as Göttingen.

The river is somewhat polluted by industry, so the water is not used for drinking, but the pollution has never been severe enough to prevent fish from living in it. Like many western rivers since the 1960s, it has enjoyed increasingly cleaner waters since the implementation of environmental controls. Sport fishing is enjoyed from small boats and along the banks, although yields are normally low.

At least one point of the river (Göttingen) is partially diverted into a canal that runs more or less parallel to the river.

Serial killer Fritz Haarmann disposed of most of his victims&#x27; remains in the Leine river.

== In fiction ==

In his 1986 bestseller &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot;, author Tom Clancy uses the Leine as a major obstacle to the Soviet Union&#x27;s Red Army drive to the Rhine and the North Sea ports of the Netherlands and Belgium through West Germany. In reality, the river is a rather minor one, and, for most of its length, is quite narrow with a small flow volume. As such, it would not provide a significant barrier to an advancing army.

<text>The Oker () is a river in Lower Saxony, Germany, that has historically formed an important political boundary. It is a left tributary of the River Aller, in length and runs in a generally northerly direction.

== Origin and meaning of the name ==
The river&#x27;s name was recorded around 830 as &quot;Obacra&quot; and, later, as &quot;Ovokare&quot; und &quot;Ovakara&quot;. The origin of the name is derived from the roots &quot;ov-&quot; and &quot;-akara&quot; meaning “upper” (cf. New High German &quot;ober-&quot;) and “onward rushing” (rendered in German as “Vorwärtsdrängende”) as distinct from its tributary, the Ecker, whose name means only “onward rushing”.

== Course ==

The Oker rises at about 910 metres in the Harz National Park in a boggy area on the Bruchberg in the Harz mountains of central Germany. This early section is known as the &quot;Große Oker&quot; (&quot;Great Oker&quot;) and it is impounded below Altenau by the Oker Dam. From the dam wall to the former village of Oker, which is today part of Goslar, the Oker is on certain occasions suitable for canoeing. This section, often called the &quot;Oker Valley&quot; (&quot;Okertal&quot;), includes the Romkerhall Waterfall. Here the &quot;Romke&quot; stream drops about in height over a waterfall laid out in 1863 into the Oker. Downstream in the river&#x27;s fast-flowing waters, the &quot;Verlobungsinsel&quot; (&quot;Betrothal Island&quot;) is to be found. Left and right of the Oker in this area are many crags that are popular with climbers.

In the Goslar vicinity of Oker the river is seriously polluted with heavy metals from the slag heaps as well as groundwater and surface runoff from the metal smelters there.


From the village of Oker the River Oker flows away in a northeasterly direction to Vienenburg, where it is joined from the south by the Radau and then from the southeast by the Ecker. After these two confluences the river continues southeast past the Harly Forest, after which it bends north to flow through Schladen and Wolfenbüttel to Braunschweig. In south Braunschweig the Oker is dammed by the Eisenbüttel Weir. In the &quot;Bürgerpark&quot; shortly before Braunschweig&#x27;s old town the Oker divides into the western and eastern bypass channels (&quot;Umflutgraben&quot;) which circumnavigate the historic city centre at a slightly higher level. These channels were laid in the 16th century as the external moats of the town&#x27;s defences. The actual course of the Oker through the centre of the town was covered and, today, runs through pipes emerging again north of the old town. The water level in the city area is controlled by the St. Peter&#x27;s Gate Weir (&quot;Petritorwehr&quot;) in the western and the &quot;Wends Weir&quot; (&quot;Wendenwehr&quot;) in the eastern ditch. Following the merger of the two channels northwest of the city centre the Oker runs north of the district of in a culvert under the Mittelland Canal before it is joined by the Schunter from the east near Groß Schwülper. It then flows down to its mouth into the River Aller, which is located between Gifhorn and Celle at Müden.

== The Oker as border river ==
Since the early ninth century the middle Oker river has formed the diocesan boundary between the bishoprics of Halberstadt and Hildesheim, established by Emperor Charlemagne and his son Louis the Pious in the Duchy of Saxony. North of Schladen the royal palace (&quot;Königspfalz&quot;) of Werla was established on the banks about above the river bed. From the High Middle Ages the Oker between the villages of Ohrum and Börßum formed the eastern boundary of the Prince-Bishopric of Hildesheim with the Duchy of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, and further south to Wiedelah (today part of Vienenburg) with the Prince-Bishopric of Halberstadt, which became the Prussian Principality of Halberstadt following its secularization in 1648.

The Bishopric of Halberstadt was likewise mediatised in 1803, and according to the Final Act of the 1815 Vienna Congress, the Oker was the eastern border of the Kingdom of Hanover with the Duchy of Brunswick and the Prussian Province of Saxony. When the Kingdom of Prussia annexed Hanover in 1866, it became the inner Prussian border between the provinces of Hanover and Saxony as well as the border, north of Börßum to Ohrum between the Province of Hanover in the west and the Duchy of Brunswick in the east. From 1945 to 1990 the Inner German border between East and West Germany ran down the centre of the Oker between Wiedelah and Schladen, today between the German states of Saxony-Anhalt and Lower Saxony.

Since the Expo 2000 bridges over the Oker in Braunschweig and its surrounding area were artistically designed; after 2004 this was carried out as part of the &quot;Okerlicht&quot; project.

<text>System dynamics (SD) is an approach to understanding the nonlinear behaviour of complex systems over time using stocks, flows, internal feedback loops, table functions and time delays.

==Overview==
System dynamics is a methodology and mathematical modeling technique to frame, understand, and discuss complex issues and problems. Originally developed in the 1950s to help corporate managers improve their understanding of industrial processes, SD is currently being used throughout the public and private sector for policy analysis and design.

Convenient graphical user interface (GUI) system dynamics software developed into user friendly versions by the 1990s and have been applied to diverse systems. SD models solve the problem of simultaneity (mutual causation) by updating all variables in small time increments with positive and negative feedbacks and time delays structuring the interactions and control. The best known SD model is probably the 1972 &quot;The Limits to Growth&quot;. This model forecast that exponential growth of population and capital, with finite resource sources and sinks and perception delays, would lead to economic collapse during the 21st century under a wide variety of growth scenarios.

System dynamics is an aspect of systems theory as a method to understand the dynamic behavior of complex systems. The basis of the method is the recognition that the structure of any system, the many circular, interlocking, sometimes time-delayed relationships among its components, is often just as important in determining its behavior as the individual components themselves. Examples are chaos theory and social dynamics. It is also claimed that because there are often properties-of-the-whole which cannot be found among the properties-of-the-elements, in some cases the behavior of the whole cannot be explained in terms of the behavior of the parts.

==History==
System dynamics was created during the mid-1950s by Professor Jay Forrester of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In 1956, Forrester accepted a professorship in the newly formed MIT Sloan School of Management. His initial goal was to determine how his background in science and engineering could be brought to bear, in some useful way, on the core issues that determine the success or failure of corporations. Forrester&#x27;s insights into the common foundations that underlie engineering, which led to the creation of system dynamics, were triggered, to a large degree, by his involvement with managers at General Electric (GE) during the mid-1950s. At that time, the managers at GE were perplexed because employment at their appliance plants in Kentucky exhibited a significant three-year cycle. The business cycle was judged to be an insufficient explanation for the employment instability. From hand simulations (or calculations) of the stock-flow-feedback structure of the GE plants, which included the existing corporate decision-making structure for hiring and layoffs, Forrester was able to show how the instability in GE employment was due to the internal structure of the firm and not to an external force such as the business cycle. These hand simulations were the start of the field of system dynamics.

During the late 1950s and early 1960s, Forrester and a team of graduate students moved the emerging field of system dynamics from the hand-simulation stage to the formal computer modeling stage. Richard Bennett created the first system dynamics computer modeling language called SIMPLE (Simulation of Industrial Management Problems with Lots of Equations) in the spring of 1958. In 1959, Phyllis Fox and Alexander Pugh wrote the first version of
DYNAMO (DYNAmic MOdels), an improved version of SIMPLE, and the system dynamics language became the industry standard for over thirty years. Forrester published the first, and still classic, book in the field titled &quot;Industrial Dynamics&quot; in 1961.

From the late 1950s to the late 1960s, system dynamics was applied almost exclusively to corporate/managerial problems. In 1968, however, an unexpected occurrence caused the field to broaden beyond corporate modeling. John F. Collins, the former mayor of Boston, was appointed a visiting professor of Urban Affairs at MIT. The result of the Collins-Forrester collaboration was a book titled &quot;Urban Dynamics&quot;. The Urban Dynamics model presented in the book was the first major non-corporate application of system dynamics. In 1967, Richard M. Goodwin published the first edition of his paper &quot;A Growth Cycle&quot;, which was the first attempt to apply the principles of system dynamics to economics. He devoted most of his life teaching what he called &quot;Economic Dynamics&quot;, which could be considered a precursor of modern Non-equilibrium economics. 

The second major noncorporate application of system dynamics came shortly after the first. In 1970, Jay Forrester was invited by the Club of Rome to a meeting in Bern, Switzerland. The Club of Rome is an organization devoted to solving what its members describe as the &quot;predicament of mankind&quot;—that is, the global crisis that may appear sometime in the future, due to the demands being placed on the Earth&#x27;s carrying capacity (its sources of renewable and nonrenewable resources and its sinks for the disposal of pollutants) by the world&#x27;s exponentially growing population. At the Bern meeting, Forrester was asked if system dynamics could be used to address the predicament of mankind. His answer, of course, was that it could. On the plane back from the Bern meeting, Forrester created the first draft of a system dynamics model of the world&#x27;s socioeconomic system. He called this model WORLD1. Upon his return to the United States, Forrester refined WORLD1 in preparation for a visit to MIT by members of the Club of Rome. Forrester called the refined version of the model WORLD2. Forrester published WORLD2 in a book titled World Dynamics.

==Topics in systems dynamics==
The primary elements of system dynamics diagrams are feedback, accumulation of flows into stocks and time delays.

As an illustration of the use of system dynamics, imagine an organisation that plans to introduce an innovative new durable consumer product. The organisation needs to understand the possible market dynamics in order to design marketing and production plans.

===Causal loop diagrams===

In the system dynamics methodology, a problem or a system (e.g., ecosystem, political system or mechanical system) may be represented as a causal loop diagram. A causal loop diagram is a simple map of a system with all its constituent components and their interactions. By capturing interactions and consequently the feedback loops (see figure below), a causal loop diagram reveals the structure of a system. By understanding the structure of a system, it becomes possible to ascertain a system&#x27;s behavior over a certain time period.

The causal loop diagram of the new product introduction may look as follows:

There are two feedback loops in this diagram. The positive reinforcement (labeled R) loop on the right indicates that the more people have already adopted the new product, the stronger the word-of-mouth impact. There will be more references to the product, more demonstrations, and more reviews. This positive feedback should generate sales that continue to grow.

The second feedback loop on the left is negative reinforcement (or &quot;balancing&quot; and hence labeled B). Clearly, growth cannot continue forever, because as more and more people adopt, there remain fewer and fewer potential adopters.

Both feedback loops act simultaneously, but at different times they may have different strengths. Thus one might expect growing sales in the initial years, and then declining sales in the later years. However, in general a causal loop diagram does not specify the structure of a system sufficiently to permit determination of its behavior from the visual representation alone.

===Stock and flow diagrams===

Causal loop diagrams aid in visualizing a system&#x27;s structure and behavior, and analyzing the system qualitatively. To perform a more detailed quantitative analysis, a causal loop diagram is transformed to a stock and flow diagram. A stock and flow model helps in studying and analyzing the system in a quantitative way; such models are usually built and simulated using computer software.

A stock is the term for any entity that accumulates or depletes over time. A flow is the rate of change in a stock.

In this example, there are two stocks: Potential adopters and Adopters. There is one flow: New adopters. For every new adopter, the stock of potential adopters declines by one, and the stock of adopters increases by one.

===Equations===
The real power of system dynamics is utilised through simulation. Although it is possible to perform the modeling in a spreadsheet, there are a variety of software packages that have been optimised for this.

The steps involved in a simulation are:

*Define the problem boundary.
*Identify the most important stocks and flows that change these stock levels.
*Identify sources of information that impact the flows.
*Identify the main feedback loops.
*Draw a causal loop diagram that links the stocks, flows and sources of information.
*Write the equations that determine the flows.
*Estimate the parameters and initial conditions. These can be estimated using statistical methods, expert opinion, market research data or other relevant sources of information.
*Simulate the model and analyse results.

In this example, the equations that change the two stocks via the flow are:

 formula_1

 formula_2

 formula_4
 formula_5
 formula_6
 formula_7
 formula_8

 formula_9
 formula_10

====Dynamic simulation results====
The dynamic simulation results show that the behaviour of the system would be to have growth in &quot;adopters&quot; that follows a classic s-curve shape.
The increase in &quot;adopters&quot; is very slow initially, then exponential growth for a period, followed ultimately by saturation.


===Equations in continuous time===
To get intermediate values and better accuracy, the model can run in continuous time: we multiply the number of units of time and we proportionally divide values that change stock levels. In this example we multiply the 15 years by 4 to obtain 60 quarters, and we divide the value of the flow by 4.&lt;br&gt;
Dividing the value is the simplest with the Euler method, but other methods could be employed instead, such as Runge–Kutta methods.

*They are the same equations as in the section &quot;Equation in discrete time&quot; above, except equations &quot;4.1&quot; and &quot;4.2&quot; replaced by following :
 formula_11
 formula_12
 formula_13

 formula_14

*In the below stock and flow diagram, the intermediate flow &#x27;Valve New adopters&#x27; calculates the equation :
 formula_15
==Application==
System dynamics has found application in a wide range of areas, for example population, agriculture, epidemiological, ecological and economic systems, which usually interact strongly with each other.

System dynamics have various &quot;back of the envelope&quot; management applications. They are a potent tool to:
*Teach system thinking reflexes to persons being coached
*Analyze and compare assumptions and mental models about the way things work
*Gain qualitative insight into the workings of a system or the consequences of a decision
*Recognize archetypes of dysfunctional systems in everyday practice

Computer software is used to simulate a system dynamics model of the situation being studied. Running &quot;what if&quot; simulations to test certain policies on such a model can greatly aid in understanding how the system changes over time. System dynamics is very similar to systems thinking and constructs the same causal loop diagrams of systems with feedback. However, system dynamics typically goes further and utilises simulation to study the behaviour of systems and the impact of alternative policies.

System dynamics has been used to investigate resource dependencies, and resulting problems, in product development.

A system dynamics approach to macroeconomics, known as &quot;Minsky&quot;, has been developed by the economist Steve Keen. This has been used to successfully model world economic behaviour from the apparent stability of the Great Moderation to the sudden unexpected Financial crisis of 2007–08.

===Example: Growth and decline of companies===
The figure above is a causal loop diagram of a system dynamics model created to examine forces that may be responsible for the growth or decline of life insurance companies in the United Kingdom. A number of this figure&#x27;s features are worth mentioning. The first is that the model&#x27;s negative feedback loops are identified by &quot;C&#x27;s&quot;, which stand for &quot;Counteracting&quot; loops. The second is that double slashes are used to indicate places where there is a significant delay between causes (i.e., variables at the tails of arrows) and effects (i.e., variables at the heads of arrows). This is a common causal loop diagramming convention in system dynamics. Third, is that thicker lines are used to identify the feedback loops and links that author wishes the audience to focus on. This is also a common system dynamics diagramming convention. Last, it is clear that a decision maker would find it impossible to think through the dynamic behavior inherent in the model, from inspection of the figure alone.

=== Example: Piston motion ===
# Objective: study of a crank-connecting rod system. We want to model a crank-connecting rod system through a system dynamic model. Two different full descriptions of the physical system with related systems of equations can be found here and here ; they give the same results. In this example, the crank, with variable radius and angular frequency, will drive a piston with a variable connecting rod length.
# System dynamic modeling: the system is now modeled, according to a stock and flow system dynamic logic. The figure below shows the stock and flow diagram 
# Simulation: the behavior of the crank-connecting rod dynamic system can then be simulated. The next figure is a 3D simulation created using procedural animation. Variables of the model animate all parts of this animation: crank, radius, angular frequency, rod length, and piston position.

<doc id="153209" wikidata="Q379918" url="?curid=153209" title="Air-augmented rocket">
<text>Air-augmented rockets use the supersonic exhaust of some kind of rocket engine to further compress air collected by ram effect during flight to use as additional working mass, leading to greater effective thrust for any given amount of fuel than either the rocket or a ramjet alone.

It represents a hybrid class of rocket/ramjet engines, similar to a ramjet, but able to give useful thrust from zero speed, and is also able in some cases to operate outside the atmosphere, with fuel efficiency similar or better than a comparable ramjet or rocket at every point.

There are a wide variety of variations on the basic concept, and a wide variety of resulting names. Those that burn additional fuel downstream of the rocket are generally known as ramrockets, rocket-ejector, integral rocket/ramjets or ejector ramjets, whilst those that do not include additional burning are known as ducted rockets or shrouded rockets depending on the details of the expander.

==Operation==
In a conventional chemical rocket engine, the rocket carries both its fuel and oxidizer in its fuselage. The chemical reaction between the fuel and the oxidizer produces reactant products which are nominally gasses at the pressures and temperatures in the rocket&#x27;s combustion chamber. The reaction is also highly energetic (exothermic) releasing tremendous energy in the form of heat; that is imparted to the reactant products in the combustion chamber giving this mass enormous internal energy which, when expanded through a nozzle is capable of producing very high exhaust velocities. The exhaust is directed rearward through the nozzle, thereby producing a thrust forward.

In this conventional design, the fuel/oxidizer mixture is both the working mass and energy source that accelerates it. It is easy to demonstrate that the best performance is had if the working mass has the lowest molecular weight possible. Hydrogen, by itself, is the theoretical best rocket fuel. Mixing this with oxygen in order to burn it lowers the overall performance of the system by raising the mass of the exhaust, as well as greatly increasing the mass that has to be carried aloft – oxygen is much heavier than hydrogen.

One potential method of increasing the overall performance of the system is to collect either the fuel or the oxidizer during flight. Fuel is hard to come by in the atmosphere, but oxidizer in the form of gaseous oxygen makes up to 20% of the air. There are a number of designs that take advantage of this fact. These sorts of systems have been explored in the liquid air cycle engine (LACE).

Another idea is to collect the working mass. With an air-augmented rocket, an otherwise conventional rocket engine is mounted in the center of a long tube, open at the front. As the rocket moves through the atmosphere the air enters the front of the tube, where it is compressed via the ram effect. As it travels down the tube it is further compressed and mixed with the fuel-rich exhaust from the rocket engine, which heats the air much as a combustor would in a ramjet. In this way a fairly small rocket can be used to accelerate a much larger working mass than normal, leading to significantly higher thrust within the atmosphere.

===Advantages===

The effectiveness of this simple method can be dramatic. Typical solid rockets have a specific impulse of about 260 seconds (2.5 kN·s/kg), but using the same fuel in an air-augmented design can improve this to over 500 seconds (4.9 kN·s/kg), a figure unmatched even by high specific impulse hydrolox engines. This design can even be slightly more efficient than a ramjet, as the exhaust from the rocket engine helps compress the air more than a ramjet normally would; this raises the combustion efficiency as a longer, more efficient nozzle can be employed. Another advantage is that the rocket works even at zero forward speed, whereas a ramjet requires forward motion to feed air into the engine.

===Disadvantages===
It might be envisaged that such an increase in performance would be widely deployed, but various issues frequently preclude this. The intakes of high-speed engines are difficult to design, and require careful positioning on the airframe in order to achieve reasonable performance – in general, the entire airframe needs to be built around the intake design. Another problem is that the air thins out as the rocket climbs. Hence, the amount of additional thrust is limited by how fast the rocket climbs. Finally, the air ducting adds quite a bit of weight which slows the vehicle considerably towards the end of the burn.

==Variations==
===Shrouded rocket===
The simplest version of an air-augmentation system is found in the shrouded rocket. This consists largely of a rocket motor or motors positioned in a duct. The rocket exhaust entrains the air, pulling it through the duct, while also mixing with it and heating it, causing the pressure to increase downstream of the rocket. The resulting hot gas is then further expanded through an expanding nozzle.

===Ducted rocket===
A slight variation on the shrouded rocket, the ducted rocket adds only a convergent-divergent nozzle. This ensures the combustion takes place at subsonic speeds, improving the range of vehicle speeds where the system remains useful.

===Ejector ramjet (et al)===
The ejector ramjet is a more complex system with potentially higher performance. Like the shrouded and ducted rocket, the system begins with a rocket engine(s) in an air intake. It differs in that the mixed exhaust enters a diffuser, slowing the speed of the airflow to subsonic speeds. Additional fuel is then injected, burning in this expanded section. The exhaust of that combustion then enters a convergent-divergent nozzle as in a conventional ramjet, or the ducted rocket case.

==History==

The first serious attempt to make a production air-augmented rocket was the Soviet Gnom rocket design, implemented by Decree 708-336 of the Soviet Ministers of 2 July 1958. 

More recently, about 2002, NASA has re-examined similar technology for the GTX program as part of an effort to develop SSTO spacecraft.

Air-augmented rockets finally entered mass production in 2016 when the Meteor Air to Air Missile was introduced into service.

<text>Working mass, also referred to as reaction mass, is a mass against which a system operates in order to produce acceleration.
In the case of a chemical rocket, for example, the reaction mass is the product of the burned fuel shot backwards to provide propulsion. All acceleration requires an exchange of momentum, which can be thought of as the &quot;unit of movement&quot;. Momentum is related to mass and velocity, as given by the formula &quot;P = mv,&quot; where &quot;P&quot; is the momentum, &quot;m&quot; the mass, and &quot;v&quot; the velocity. The velocity of a body is easily changeable, but in most cases the mass is not, which makes it important.

==Rockets and rocket-like reaction engines==
In rockets, the total velocity change can be calculated (using the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation) as follows:

formula_1

Where:
* &quot;v&quot; = ship velocity.
* &quot;u&quot; = exhaust velocity.
* &quot;M&quot; = ship mass, not including the working mass.
* &quot;m&quot; = total mass ejected from the ship (working mass).

The term working mass is used primarily in the aerospace field. In more &quot;down to earth&quot; examples, the working mass is typically provided by the Earth, which contains so much momentum in comparison to most vehicles that the amount it gains or loses can be ignored. However, in the case of an aircraft the working mass is the air, and in the case of a rocket, it is the rocket fuel itself. Most rocket engines use light-weight fuels (liquid hydrogen, oxygen, or kerosene) accelerated to supersonic speeds. However, ion engines often use heavier elements like xenon as the reaction mass, accelerated to much higher speeds using electric fields.

In many cases, the working mass is separate from the energy used to accelerate it. In a car, the engine provides power to the wheels, which then accelerates the Earth backward to make the car move forward. This is not the case for most rockets, however, where the rocket propellant is the working mass, as well as the energy source. This means that rockets stop accelerating as soon as they run out of fuel, regardless of other power sources they may have. This can be a problem for satellites that need to be repositioned often, as it limits their useful life. In general, the exhaust velocity should be close to the ship velocity for optimum energy efficiency. This limitation of rocket propulsion is one of the main motivations for the ongoing interest in field propulsion technology.

<text>Kuching ( , ), officially the City of Kuching, is the capital and the most populous city in the state of Sarawak in Malaysia. It is also the capital of Kuching Division. The city is on the Sarawak River at the southwestern tip of Sarawak on the island of Borneo and covers an area of with a population about 157,920 in the Kuching North administrative region and 280,982 in the Kuching South administrative regiona total of 438,902 people.

Kuching was founded by the representative of the Sultan of Brunei in 1827. It was the third capital of Sarawak in 1827 during the administration of the Bruneian Empire. In 1841, Kuching became the capital of the Kingdom of Sarawak after the territory in the area was ceded to James Brooke for helping the Bruneian Empire in crushing a rebellion particularly by the interior Borneo-dwelling Land Dayak people who later became his loyal followers after most of them were pardoned by him and joined his side. The town continued to receive attention and development during the rule of Charles Brooke such as the construction of a sanitation system, hospital, prison, fort, and a bazaar. In 1941, the Brooke administration had a Centenary Celebration in Kuching. During World War II, Kuching was occupied by Japanese forces from 1942 to 1945. The Japanese government set up a Batu Lintang camp near Kuching to hold prisoners of war and civilian internees. After the war, the town survived intact. However, the last Rajah of Sarawak, Sir Charles Vyner Brooke decided to cede Sarawak as part of British Crown Colony in 1946. Kuching remained as capital during the Crown Colony period. After the formation of Malaysia in 1963, Kuching retained its status as state capital and was granted city status in 1988. Since then, Kuching has been divided into two administrative regions managed by two separate local authorities Mohd Azri Bin Subohi. The administrative centre of the Sarawak State Government is located at Wisma Bapa Malaysia, Kuching.

Kuching is a major food destination and is a member of UNESCO&#x27;s Creative Cities Network under the field of gastronomy. Kuching is also the main gateway for travellers visiting Sarawak and Borneo. Kuching Wetlands National Park is located about from the city and there are many other tourist attractions in and around Kuching such as Bako National Park, Semenggoh Wildlife Centre, Rainforest World Music Festival (RWMF), state assembly building, The Astana, Fort Margherita, Kuching Cat Museum, and Sarawak State Museum / Borneo Cultures Museum. The city has become one of the major industrial and commercial centres in East Malaysia.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Kuching&quot; was already in use for the city by the time Brooke arrived in 1839. There are many theories as to the derivation of the name &quot;Kuching&quot;. It was perhaps derived from the Malay word for cat, &quot;kucing&quot;, or from Cochin, an Indian trading port on the Malabar Coast and a generic term in China and British India for trading harbour. Some Hindu artefacts can be seen today at the Sarawak State Museum. However, another source reported that Kuching was previously known as &quot;Sarawak&quot; before Brooke arrived. The settlement was renamed to &quot;Sarawak Proper&quot; during the kingdom&#x27;s expansion. It was only in 1872 that Charles Brooke renamed the settlement to &quot;Kuching&quot;.

There was one unlikely theory based on a story of miscommunication. According to the story, James Brooke arrived in Kuching on his schooner &quot;Royalist&quot;. He then asked his local guide about the name of the town. The local guide mistakenly thought that Brooke was pointing towards a cat, and so had said the word &quot;Kuching&quot;. However, ethnic Malays in Sarawak have always used the term &quot;pusak&quot; for cats (cognate with Filipino &quot;pusa&quot;), instead of the standard Malay word &quot;kucing&quot; (cognate with Filipino &quot;kuting&quot; which refers to kittens). Despite this etymological discrepancy, Sarawakians have adopted the animal as a symbol of their city, and it features in statues as well as the municipal council&#x27;s coat of arms - an example of heraldic canting.

Some source also stated that it was derived from a fruit called &quot;mata kucing&quot; (&quot;Euphoria malaiense&quot;), a close relative of the Longan that grows widely in Malaysia and Indonesia. There was also a hill in the city that was named after the fruit, which is called Bukit Mata Kuching. Harriette McDougall writing to her son in the 19th century, stated that the name was derived from a stream of the same name, called &quot;Sungai Kuching&quot; or Cat River in English. On page 64 of Bampfylde and Baring-Gould&#x27;s 1909 &#x27;A History of Sarawak under its Two White Rajahs&#x27;, it says: &quot;Kuching, the capital of Sarawak, is so called from a small stream that runs through the town into the main river...&quot; The stream was situated at the foot of Bukit Mata Kuching and in front of the Tua Pek Kong Temple. In the 1950s, the river became very shallow because of silt deposits in the river. The river was later filled to make way for roads.

There is another theory that Kuching actually means &quot;Ku&quot; (古)- Old and &quot;Ching&quot; (井) - Well or &quot;old well&quot; (古井) in Chinese. During the Brooke administration, there was no water supply and water-borne diseases were common. In 1888, an epidemic broke out which later was known as &quot;Great Cholera Epidemic&quot;. A well situated in the present day China Street in Main Bazaar helped to combat the disease by providing clean water supply. Due to increased demand for a water supply, the role of the well was later replaced by water treatment plant on the Bau Road.

==History==

Sarawak was part of the Bruneian Empire since the reign of the first Sultan of Brunei, Sultan Muhammad Shah. Kuching was the third capital of Sarawak, founded in 1827 by the representative of the Sultan of Brunei, Pengiran Indera Mahkota. Prior to the founding of Kuching, the two past capitals of Sarawak were Santubong, founded by Sultan Pengiran Tengah in 1599, and Lidah Tanah, founded by Datu Patinggi Ali in the early 1820s. The founding of Kuching was spurred by the discovery of antimony ore at the upper Sarawak river in 1924, which was in high demand in the market of nearby Singapore. A Dutch report mentioned that there lived about a hundred Malays and three houses of Chinese in the area shortly before the founding of Kuching. The arrival of Mahkota was not popular with the local Malay chiefs, whose autonomy was restricted by Mahkota&#x27;s increasing tax and labour demands. The chiefs moved upriver, allied with Dayaks, and rebelled against Brunei. Neither side could gain an edge over the other until 1840 when Pengiran Raja Muda Hashim, the Bruneian Prime Minister, offered to hand over the governorship of Sarawak to British adventurer James Brooke to acquire his help to defeat the rebel chiefs.

Pengiran Raja Muda Hashim later ceded the territory to James Brooke as a reward for helping him to counter the rebellion. The rebellion was crushed in November 1840, and on 24 September 1841, Brooke was appointed as the Governor of Sarawak with the title of Rajah. It was not announced until 18 August 1842, following Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddin II&#x27;s ratifying the governorship, and requiring Brooke to pay an annual sum of $2,500 to the Sultan. Since that time, Kuching became the seat of the Brooke government.

The administration was later continued by his nephew, Charles Brooke. As an administrative capital, it became the centre of attention and development. Improvements included a sanitation system. By 1874, the city had completed several developments, including construction of a hospital, prison, Fort Margherita, and many other buildings.

Charles Brooke&#x27;s wife, in her memoir &quot;(My Life in Sarawak)&quot;, included this description of Kuching:
The Astana (Palace), which is now the official residence of the governor of Sarawak, was constructed next to Brooke&#x27;s first residence. He had it built in 1869 as a wedding gift to his wife. Kuching continued to prosper under Charles Vyner Brooke, who succeeded his father as the Third Rajah of Sarawak. In 1941, Kuching was the site of the Brooke Government Centenary Celebration. A few months later, the Brooke administration came to a close when the Japanese occupied Sarawak.

During the Second World War, six platoons of infantry from 2/15 Punjab Regiment were stationed at Kuching in April 1941. The Regiment defended Kuching and Bukit Stabar airfield from being the destroyed by the Japanese. Defence was mainly concentrated on Kuching and Miri. However, on 24 December 1941, Kuching was conquered by the Japanese forces. Sarawak was ruled as part of the Japanese Empire for three years and eight months, until the official Japanese surrender on 11 September 1945. The official surrender was signed on &quot;HMAS Kapunda&quot; at Kuching. From March 1942, the Japanese operated the Batu Lintang camp, for POWs and civilian internees, outside Kuching.

After the end of World War II, the town survived and was wholly undamaged. The third and last Rajah, Sir Charles Vyner Brooke later ceded Sarawak to the British Crown on 1 July 1946. During the Crown Colony period, the government worked to develop and improve the infrastructure on Sarawak. Kuching was revitalised as the capital of Sarawak under the British colonial government. When Sarawak, together with North Borneo, Singapore and the Federation of Malaya, formed the Federation of Malaysia in 1963, Kuching kept its status as the state capital and was granted a city status on 1 August 1988. Kuching experienced further development throughout the years as the state capital. On 29 July 2015, Kuching was declared as &quot;City of Unity&quot; by One Malaysia Foundation for racial harmony that existed in the city because of cross-racial marriages, multi-racial schools, fair scholarship distributions, and balanced workforce patterns.

==Governance==

As the capital of Sarawak, Kuching plays an important role in the political and economic welfare of the population of the entire state as it is the seat of the state government where almost all of their ministries and agencies are based. The Sarawak State Legislative Assembly is located in a suburb, Petra Jaya.

There are 5 Members of Parliament (MPs) representing the five parliamentary constituencies and twelve state legislative assemblymen in the state legislature representing the twelve state constituencies in Kuching district.
===Local authority and city definition===
Kuching is the only city in Malaysia to be administered by two mayors; the city is divided into Kuching North and Kuching South. Each of these is administered by a mayor for Kuching South and a commissioner for Kuching North. The current commissioner for Kuching North is Datu Junaidi Reduan, who took over from Datuk Haji Abang Abdul Wahab Abang Julai on 31 August 2019 while Datuk Wee Hong Seng became the new mayor for the Kuching South in 2019, succeeding Dato&#x27; James Chan Khay Syn. The city obtained a city status on 1 August 1988, and since that it was administered by Kuching North City Hall (DBKU) and Kuching South City Council (MBKS).

The city is defined within the borders of what is the Kuching District. With an area of , it is the most populous district in Sarawak. The area then subdivided into two sub-districts, namely Kuching Proper and Padawan. Kuching Proper included the city area and northern part of Padawan municipality (e.g. Batu Kawah, Matang Jaya), while Padawan sub-district (southern part of Padawan municipality) included Kota Padawan, Teng Bukap and Borneo Highlands (Mambong). The combined area of Kuching North City Hall, Kuching South City Council, Padawan Municipal Council, and the Kota Samarahan Municipal Council is known as Greater Kuching.

==Geography==

Kuching is located on the banks of the Sarawak River in the northwestern part of the island of Borneo. The limits of the City of Kuching include all that area in Kuching District containing an area approximately bounded from &quot;Gunung Lasak&quot; (Mount Lasak) in Muara Tebas to &quot;Batu Buaya&quot; (Crocodile Rock) in the Santubong peninsula following a series of survey marks as stated in the First Schedule of the &quot;City of Kuching Ordinance, 1988&quot;. As a simplification of the legal statute, the Kuching city limits extend from the Kuching International Airport in the south to the northern coast of the Santubong and Bako peninsulas; from the Kuching Wetlands National Park in the west to the Kuap River estuary in the east. The Sarawak River generally splits the city into North and South. The highest point in the city is Mount Santubong on the Santubong peninsula, which is at above sea level, located 35 km north of the city centre. Rapid urbanisation has occurred in Greater Kuching and the urban sprawl extends to Penrissen, Kota Sentosa, Kota Padawan, Batu Kawah, Matang, Samariang, Siburan, Tarat, Kota Samarahan, Asajaya as well as Serian which is located about 65 km from Kuching.

===Climate===
Kuching has a tropical rainforest climate (Köppen climate classification Af), moderately hot but very humid at times and receives substantial rainfall. The average annual rainfall is approximately . Kuching is the wettest populated area (on average) in Malaysia with an average of 247 rainy days per year. Kuching receives only 5 hours of sunshine per day on average and an average of only 3.7 hours of sunshine per day in the month of January (wettest month of the year). The wettest times are during the North-East Monsoon months of November to February and the city&#x27;s driest months are June through August. The temperature in Kuching ranges from to but the average temperature is around in the early hours of the morning and rises to around during mid afternoon. This temperature stays almost constant throughout the year if it is not affected by the heavy rain and strong winds during the early hours of the morning which can bring the temperature down to , but this is very rare.

==Demography==
The term &quot;Kuchingite&quot; has been used to describe the people of Kuching, although it is not official. However, the simplest way to call the people of Kuching is only by &quot;orang Kuching&quot;, which means &quot;people of Kuching&quot; in English.

===Ethnicity===

In early 2022, the Department of Statistics Malaysia (DoSM) reported that Kuching had a total population of 402,738. The metro city population (North Kuching, South Kuching, and Padawan) consists primarily of Malays (146,067), Chinese (138,620), Iban (82,743), Bidayuh (20,065), non-Malaysian citizens (5,048), other Sarawak Bumiputras (Orang Ulu) (4,076), Melanau (1,840) and Indian (3,257), with around a thousand people of other groups (1,022). The Chinese are made up of Hokkien, mainly in the urban areas and in the suburbs. Other Chinese subgroups consist of Foochow, Hainanese, Teochew, Cantonese, Hakka and Henghua.

The Bidayuh, Dayak, Iban and Orang Ulu are mainly Christians (with some practising Animism), while the Chinese practise either Buddhism, Taoism or Christianity; most of the Malays and Melanau are Muslim, and a number of Hindus and Sikhs, with a small number of secularists, also exist around the city.

There is a size-able population of non-citizens, who mostly come from the bordering Indonesian region of Kalimantan, most of whom are migrant workers. Since the British period, a small population of South Asians—notably, Pakistanis—have lived in the city, their livelihoods primarily the selling of clothing and spices. Other migrants who came during the British era included Bugis from the Dutch East Indies, and other peoples from neighbouring Dutch Borneo. Being a diverse, &quot;melting-pot&quot; city, interracial marriages (among those of different ethnic backgrounds) are common in Kuching, and the city itself is home to over 30 distinct ethnic groups.

===Languages===

Besides being the capital city of Sarawak, Kuching is a business hub and cultural centre for the Malay populace. The dialect of Malay spoken in Kuching is known as &quot;Bahasa Sarawak&quot; (Sarawakian Malay Language), a subset of the Malay language. The local dialect in Kuching is different from that spoken or heard in Miri. Since the second-largest population in Kuching is made up of Han Chinese, the Chinese language is also commonly spoken, particularly Hokkien and Mandarin. Almost all residents are able to speak English. A number of speciality and private schools provide English as a medium of instruction (primarily for wealthy and/or expatriate children), among other foreign language courses which can be found through the city.

==Economy==

Kuching is one of the main industrial and commercial centres for Sarawak. Many state-level, national-level, and international commercial banks, as well as some insurance companies, maintain their headquarters and corporate offices here. The economy is dominated by the primary sector, and currently by the tertiary-based industry, as the state government envisioned Sarawak being transformed into a more developed state by 2020.

There are three main industrial areas in Kuching—Pending Industrial Estate (mixed and light industries), Demak Laut Industrial Park (mixed, light, and medium industries) and Sama Jaya Free Industrial Zone (hi-tech, computer and electronics industries). This is intended to boost the city&#x27;s commercial and industrial activity, making it a major point of growth in East Malaysia, as well for the BIMP-EAGA (Brunei-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines East ASEAN Growth Area). Kuching has hosted numerous national, regional and international conferences, congresses and trade fairs, such as the Malaysia Global Business Forum, Tomorrow&#x27;s Leaders Summit, International Hydropower Association (IHA) World Congress, ASEAN Tourism Forum, and Routes Asia Conference. Furthermore, Kuching was chosen as a permanent host for the biennial ASEAN International Film Festival and Awards (AIFFA). These events are normally held at the Borneo Convention Centre.

Kuching Port Authority (KPA), established in 1961, started its operations at Tanah Puteh Port (Sim Kheng Hong Port) in 1975 with an annual capacity of 350,000 tonnes. Its operations have since been shifted to Pending and Senari terminals, with an annual capacity of 2.9 million tonnes and 7 million tonnes, respectively. also controls Biawak Oil Jetty, which handles petroleum products.

Historically, the Chinese have contributed heavily to the city&#x27;s economy since their migration during the Brunei Sultanate period, after the discovery of antimony ore, and also during the Charles Vyner Brooke administration (who encouraged the immigration of the Chinese for planting black pepper).

==Transport==

===Land===

 Kuching&#x27;s roads, thoroughfares and motorways are overseen by one of the two local councils, the DBKU (Dewan Bandaraya Kuching Utara) and MBKS (Majlis Bandaraya Kuching Selatan), or the state&#x27;s Public Works Department. Roads overseen by the latter department are generally state roads or federal roads.

Most major internal roads are dual-carriageways. Kuching is linked by roads to other towns within Sarawak, mainly by federal roads. The city is also famous for a number of roundabouts, including the oldest and largest one, the Datuk Abang Kipali Bin Abang Akip Roundabout. The roundabouts are typically landscaped and are efficient for handling traffic congestion. However, traffic lights are more commonly used now as the city&#x27;s traffic continues to rise.

As Kuching is located near the equator, potholes have the tendency to develop on the roads during the monsoon season, usually at the end of the year, due to coinciding with winter in the Northern Hemisphere. Roads leading outside of the city to the more rural regions were of a slightly inferior quality, with regards to maintenance, but are now being upgraded. Highway routes from Kuching include:
* Kuching–Serian Highway
* Kuching Bypass
* Kuching–Kota Samarahan Expressway
* Matang Highway

<doc id="153217" wikidata="Q499193" url="?curid=153217" title="Carrier wave">
<text>In telecommunications, a carrier wave, carrier signal, or just carrier, is a periodic waveform (usually sinusoidal) that conveys information through a process called &quot;modulation&quot;. One or more of the wave&#x27;s properties, such as amplitude or frequency, are modified by an information bearing signal, called the &quot;message signal&quot; or &quot;modulation signal&quot;. The carrier frequency is usually much higher than the message signal frequency; this is because it is usually impractical to transmit signals with low frequencies over long distances (due to attenuation).

The purpose of the carrier is usually either to transmit the information through space as an electromagnetic wave (as in radio communication), or to allow several carriers at different frequencies to share a common physical transmission medium by frequency division multiplexing (as in a cable television system). 

The term originated in radio communication, where the carrier wave creates the waves which carry the information (modulation) through the air from the transmitter to the receiver. The term is also used for an unmodulated emission in the absence of any modulating signal.

In music production, carrier signals can be controlled by a modulating signal to change the sound property of an audio recording and add a sense of depth and movement.

==Overview==

The term &quot;carrier wave&quot; originated with radio. In a radio communication system, such as radio or television broadcasting, information is transmitted across space by radio waves. At the sending end, the information, in the form of a modulation signal, is applied to an electronic device called a transmitter. In the transmitter, an electronic oscillator generates a sinusoidal alternating current of radio frequency; this is the carrier wave. The information signal is used to modulate the carrier wave, altering some aspects of the carrier, to impress the information on the wave. The alternating current is amplified and applied to the transmitter&#x27;s antenna, radiating radio waves that carry the information to the receiver&#x27;s location. At the receiver, the radio waves strike the receiver&#x27;s antenna, inducing a tiny oscillating current in it, which is applied to the receiver. In the receiver, the modulation signal is extracted from the modulated carrier wave, a process called demodulation.

Most radio systems in the 20th century used frequency modulation (FM) or amplitude modulation (AM) to add information to the carrier. The frequency spectrum of a modulated AM or FM signal from a radio transmitter is shown above. It consists of a strong component &quot;(C)&quot; at the carrier frequency formula_1 with the modulation contained in narrow sidebands &quot;(SB)&quot; above and below the carrier frequency. The frequency of a radio or television station is considered to be the carrier frequency. However the carrier itself is not useful in transmitting the information, so the energy in the carrier component is a waste of transmitter power. Therefore, in many modern modulation methods, the carrier is not transmitted. For example, in single-sideband modulation (SSB), the carrier is suppressed (and in some forms of SSB, eliminated). The carrier must be reintroduced at the receiver by a beat frequency oscillator (BFO).

Carriers are also widely used to transmit multiple information channels through a single cable or other communication medium using the technique of frequency division multiplexing (FDM). For example, in a cable television system, hundreds of television channels are distributed to consumers through a single coaxial cable, by modulating each television channel on a carrier wave of a different frequency, then sending all the carriers through the cable. At the receiver, the individual channels can be separated by bandpass filters using tuned circuits so the television channel desired can be displayed. A similar technique called wavelength division multiplexing is used to transmit multiple channels of data through an optical fiber by modulating them on separate light carriers; light beams of different wavelengths.

== Carrierless modulation systems ==

The information in a modulated radio signal is contained in the sidebands while the power in the carrier frequency component does not transmit information itself, so newer forms of radio communication (such as spread spectrum and ultra-wideband), and OFDM which is widely used in Wi-Fi networks, digital television, and digital audio broadcasting (DAB) do not use a conventional sinusoidal carrier wave.

== Carrier leakage ==

Carrier leakage is interference caused by crosstalk or a DC offset. It is present as an unmodulated sine wave within the signal&#x27;s bandwidth, whose amplitude is independent of the signal&#x27;s amplitude. See frequency mixers.

<doc id="153218" wikidata="Q33638" url="?curid=153218" title="Manchu language">
<text>Manchu (Manchu:, Romanization: ) is a critically endangered East Asian Tungusic language native to the historical region of Manchuria in Northeast China. As the traditional native language of the Manchus, it was one of the official languages of the Qing dynasty (1644–1912) of China, although today the vast majority of Manchus speak only Mandarin Chinese. Several thousand can speak Manchu as a second language through governmental primary education or free classes for adults in classrooms or online.

The Manchu language has high historical value for historians of China, especially for the Qing dynasty. Manchu-language texts supply information that is unavailable in Chinese, and when both Manchu and Chinese versions of a given text exist, they provide controls for understanding the Chinese.

Like most Siberian languages, Manchu is an agglutinative language that demonstrates limited vowel harmony. It has been demonstrated that it is derived mainly from the Jurchen language though there are many loan words from Mongolian and Chinese. Its script is vertically written and taken from the Mongolian script (which in turn derives from Aramaic via Uyghur and Sogdian). Although Manchu does not have the kind of grammatical gender found in most European languages, some gendered words in Manchu are distinguished by different stem vowels (vowel inflection), as in , &#x27;father&#x27;, and , &#x27;mother&#x27;.

==Names==
The Qing dynasty used various Mandarin Chinese expressions to refer to the Manchu language, such as &quot;Qingwen&quot; () and &quot;Qingyu&quot; () (&quot;Qing language&quot;). The term &quot;national&quot; was also applied to writing in Manchu, as in &quot;Guowen&quot; (), in addition to &quot;Guoyu&quot; () (&quot;national language&quot;), which was used by previous non-Han dynasties to refer to their languages and, in modern times, to the Standard Chinese language. In the Manchu-language version of the Treaty of Nerchinsk, the term &quot;Chinese language&quot; (&quot;Dulimbai gurun i bithe&quot;) referred to all three Chinese, Manchu, and Mongol languages, not just one language.

==History and significance==

=== Historical linguistics ===
Manchu is southern Tungusic. Whilst Northern Tungus languages such as Evenki retain traditional structure, the Chinese language is a source of major influence upon Manchu, altering its form and vocabulary.

In 1635 Hong Taiji renamed the Jurchen people and Jurchen language as &#x27;Manchu&#x27;. The Jurchen are the ancestors of the Manchu and ruled over the later Jin dynasty (1115–1234).

=== Decline of use ===
Manchu began as a primary language of the Qing dynasty Imperial court, but as Manchu officials became increasingly sinicized, many started losing the language. Trying to preserve the Manchu identity, the imperial government instituted Manchu language classes and examinations for the bannermen, offering rewards to those who excelled in the language. Chinese classics and fiction were translated into Manchu and a body of Manchu literature accumulated. As the Yongzheng Emperor (reigned 1722–1735) explained, &quot;If some special encouragement … is not offered, the ancestral language will not be passed on and learned.&quot; Still, the use of the language among the bannermen declined throughout the 18th century. Historical records report that as early as 1776, the Qianlong Emperor was shocked to see a Manchu official, Guo&#x27;ermin, not understand what the emperor was telling him in Manchu, despite coming from the Manchu stronghold of Shengjing (now Shenyang). By the 19th century, even the imperial court had lost fluency in the language. The Jiaqing Emperor (reigned 1796–1820) complained that his officials were not proficient at understanding or writing Manchu.

By the end of the 19th century, the language had declined to such an extent that even at the office of the Shengjing general, the only documents written in Manchu (rather than Chinese) would be the memorials wishing the emperor long life; during the same period, the archives of the Hulan banner detachment in Heilongjiang show that only 1% of the bannermen could read Manchu and no more than 0.2% could speak it. Nonetheless, as late as 1906–1907, Qing education and military officials insisted that schools teach Manchu language and that the officials testing soldiers&#x27; marksmanship continue to conduct an oral examination in Manchu.

The use of the language for the official documents declined throughout Qing history as well. In particular, at the beginning of the dynasty, some documents on sensitive political and military issues were submitted in Manchu but not in Chinese. Later on, some Imperial records in Manchu continued to be produced until the last years of the dynasty. In 1912 the Qing was overthrown, most Manchus could not speak their language, and the Beijing dialect replaced Manchu.

=== Use of Manchu ===
A large number of Manchu documents remain in the archives, important for the study of Qing-era China. Today, written Manchu can still be seen on architecture inside the Forbidden City, whose historical signs are written in both Chinese and Manchu. Another limited use of the language was for voice commands in the Qing army, attested as late as 1878.

Bilingual Chinese-Manchu inscriptions appeared on many things.

===Manchu studies during the Qing dynasty===
A Jiangsu Han Chinese named Shen Qiliang wrote books on Manchu grammar, including &quot;Guide to Qing Books&quot; (; &quot;Manju bithe jy nan&quot;) and &quot;Great Qing Encyclopedia&quot; (; &quot;Daicing gurun-i yooni bithe&quot;). His father was a naval officer for the Qing and his grandfather was an official of the Ming dynasty before rebels murdered him. Shen Qiliang himself fought against the Three Feudatories as part of the Qing army. He then started learning Manchu and writing books on Manchu grammar from Bordered Yellow Manchu Bannermen in 1677 after moving to Beijing. He translated the Hundred Family Names and Thousand Character Classic into Manchu and spent 25 years on the Manchu language. Shen wrote: &quot;I am a Han. But all my life I have made a hobby of Manchu.&quot; Shen didn&#x27;t have to learn Manchu as part of his job because he was never an official,so he seems to have studied it voluntarily. Most Han people were not interested in learning non-Han languages, so it is not known why Shen was doing it, but he did praise Manchu writing, saying that it was simpler and clearer than Chinese.

A Hangzhou Han Chinese, Chen Mingyuan, helped edit the book &quot;Introduction to the Qing language&quot; (; &quot;Cing wen ki meng bithe&quot;), which was co-written by a Manchu named Uge. Uge gave private Manchu language classes, which were attended by his friend Chen. Chen arranged for its printing.

==== Hanlin ====
Han Chinese at the Hanlin Academy studied the Manchu language in the Qing. The Han Chinese Hanlin graduate Qi Yunshi knew the Manchu language and wrote a book in Chinese on the frontier regions of China by translating and using the Manchu-language sources in the Grand Secretariat&#x27;s archives. In 1740, Hanlin Academy expelled the Han Chinese Yuan Mei for not succeeding in his Manchu studies. Injišan, and Ortai, both Manchus, funded his work. The Han Chinese Yan Changming had the ability to read Tibetan, Oirat, and Mongolian. Han Chinese officials learned languages on the frontier regions and Manchu in order to be able to write and compile their writings on the region.

A Manchu-language course over three years was required for the highest ranking Han degree holders from Hanlin but not all Han literati were required to study Manchu. Towards the end of the Qing it was pointed out that a lot of Bannermen themselves did not know Manchu anymore and that, in retrospect, &quot;the founding emperors of the (Qing) dynasty (had been) unable to coerce the country&#x27;s ministers and people to learn the national writing and national speech (Manchu)&quot;.

==== Translation between Chinese and Manchu ====
Chinese fiction books were translated into Manchu. Bannermen wrote fiction in the Chinese language. Huang Taiji had Chinese books translated into Manchu. Han Chinese and Manchus helped Jesuits write and translate books into Manchu and Chinese. Manchu books were published in Beijing.

The Qianlong Emperor commissioned projects such as new Manchu dictionaries, both monolingual and multilingual like the Pentaglot. Among his directives were to eliminate directly borrowed loanwords from Chinese and replace them with calque translations which were put into new Manchu dictionaries. This showed in the titles of Manchu translations of Chinese works during his reign which were direct translations contrasted with Manchu books translated during the Kangxi Emperor&#x27;s reign which were Manchu transliterations of the Chinese characters.

The Pentaglot was based on the &quot;Yuzhi Siti Qing Wenjian&quot; (; &quot;Imperially-Published Four-Script Textual Mirror of Qing&quot;), with Uyghur added as a fifth language. The four-language version of the dictionary with Tibetan was in turn based on an earlier three-language version with Manchu, Mongolian, and Chinese called the &quot;Imperially-Published Manchu Mongol Chinese Three pronunciation explanation mirror of Qing&quot; (), which was in turn based on the &quot;Imperially-Published Revised and Enlarged mirror of Qing&quot; () in Manchu and Chinese, which used both Manchu script to transcribe Chinese words and Chinese characters to transcribe Manchu words with fanqie.

====Studies by outsiders====
A number of European scholars in the 18th century were frustrated by the difficulties in reading Chinese, with its &quot;complicated&quot; writing system and classical writing style. They considered Manchu translations, or parallel Manchu versions, of many Chinese documents and literary works very helpful for understanding the original Chinese. De Moyriac de Mailla (1669–1748) benefited from the existence of the parallel Manchu text when translating the historical compendium &quot;Tongjian Gangmu&quot; (&quot;Tung-chien Kang-mu&quot;; ). Jean Joseph Amiot, a Jesuit scholar, consulted Manchu translations of Chinese works as well, and wrote that the Manchu language &quot;would open an easy entrance to penetrate … into the labyrinth of Chinese literature of all ages.&quot;
Study of the Manchu language by Russian sinologists started in the early 18th century, soon after the founding of the Russian Orthodox Mission in Beijing, to which most early Russian sinologists were connected. (died 1761) translated a number of Manchu works, such as &quot;The history of Kangxi&#x27;s conquest of the Khalkha and Oirat nomads of the Great Tartary, in five parts&quot; (), as well as some legal treatises and a Manchu–Chinese dictionary. In the late 1830s, Georgy M. Rozov translated from Manchu the &quot;History of the Jin (Jurchen) Dynasty&quot;. A school to train Manchu language translators was started in Irkutsk in the 18th century, and existed for a fairly long period.

An anonymous author remarked in 1844 that the transcription of Chinese words in Manchu alphabet, available in the contemporary Chinese–Manchu dictionaries, was more useful for learning the pronunciation of Chinese words than the inconsistent romanizations used at the time by the writers transcribing Chinese words in English or French books.

In 1930, the German sinologist Erich Hauer argued forcibly that knowing Manchu allows the scholar to render Manchu personal and place names that have been &quot;horribly mutilated&quot; by their Chinese transliterations and to know the meanings of the names. He goes on that the Manchu translations of Chinese classics and fiction were done by experts familiar with their original meaning and with how best to express it in Manchu, such as in the Manchu translation of the &quot;Peiwen yunfu&quot;. Because Manchu is not difficult to learn, it &quot;enables the student of Sinology to use the Manchu versions of the classics […] in order to verify the meaning of the Chinese text&quot;.

==Current situation==

Currently, several thousand people can speak Manchu as a second language through primary education or free classes for adults offered in China. However very few native Manchu speakers remain. In what used to be Manchuria virtually no one speaks the language, the entire area having been completely sinicized. As of 2007, the last native speakers of the language were thought to be 18 octogenarian residents of the village of Sanjiazi (), in Fuyu County, in Qiqihar, Heilongjiang Province. A few speakers also remain in Dawujia village in Aihui District of Heihe Prefecture.

The Xibe (or Sibe) are often considered to be the modern custodians of the written Manchu language. The Xibe live in Qapqal Xibe Autonomous County near the Ili valley in Xinjiang, having been moved there by the Qianlong Emperor in 1764. Modern written Xibe is very close to Manchu, although there are slight differences in the writing system which reflect distinctive Xibe pronunciation. More significant differences exist in morphological and syntactic structure of the spoken Xibe language. For one example among many, there is a &quot;converb&quot; ending, -&quot;mak&quot;, that is very common in modern spoken Xibe but unknown in Manchu.

=== Revitalization movements ===
Since the 1980s, there have been increased efforts to revive the Manchu language. Revival movements are linked to the reconstruction of ethnic Manchu identity in the Han-dominated country. The Manchus mainly lead the revival efforts, with support from the PRC state, NGOs and international efforts.

Revivalism began in the post-Mao era when non-Han ethnic expression was allowed. By the 1980s, Manchus had become the second largest minority group in China. People began to reveal their ethnic identities that had been hidden due to 20th century unrests and the fall of the Qing Empire.

Language revival was one method the growing numbers of Manchus used in order to reconstruct their lost ethnic identity. Language represented them and set them apart from other minority groups in the &quot;plurality of ethnic cultures within one united culture&quot;. Another reason for revivalism lay in the archives of the Qing Empire–a way to translate and resolve historical conflicts between the Manchus and the state. Lastly, the people wanted to regain their language for the rituals and communication to their ancestors–many shamans do not understand the words they use.

Manchu associations can be found across the country, including Hong Kong, and Taiwan which is now under the administration of the Republic of China. Consisting of mostly Manchus and Mongols, they act as the link between the people, their ethnic leaders and the state.

NGOs provide large support through &quot;Manchu classes&quot;. Manchu is now taught in certain primary schools as well as in universities. Heilongjiang University Manchu language research center in no.74, Xuefu Road, Harbin, listed Manchu as an academic major. It is taught there as a tool for reading Qing-dynasty archival documents. In 2009 &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that the language is offered (as an elective) in one university, one public middle school, and a few private schools. There are also other Manchu volunteers in many places of China who freely teach Manchu in the desire to rescue the language. Thousands of non-Manchu speakers have learned the language through these measures. Despite the efforts of NGOs, they tend to lack support from high-level government and politics.

The state also runs programs to revive minority cultures and languages. Deng Xiaoping promoted bilingual education. However, many programs are not suited to the ethnic culture or to passing knowledge to the younger generations. If the programs were created via &quot;top-down political processes&quot; the locals tend to look at them with distrust. But if they were formed via specialized governmental organizations, they fare better. According to Katarzyna Golik:In Mukden, the historical Manchurian capital, there is a Shenyang Manchu Association () which is active in promoting Manchurian culture. The Association publishes books about Manchurian folklore and history and its activities are run independently from the local government. Among the various classes of the Manchurian language and calligraphy some turned out to be a success. Beijing has the biggest and most wealthy Beijing Daxing Regency Manchu Association (). (pp100-101)Other support can be found internationally and on the Internet. Post-Cultural Revolution reform allowed for international studies to be done in China. The dying language and ethnic culture of Manchus gained attention, providing local support. Websites facilitate communication of language classes or articles. Younger generations also spread and promote their unique identity through popular Internet media.

Despite the increased efforts to revive the Manchu language, there are many obstacles standing in the way. Even with increased awareness, many Manchus choose to give up their language, some opting to learn Mongolian instead. Manchu language is still thought of as a foreign language in a Han-dominated Chinese speaking country. Obstacles are also found when gaining recognition from the state. Resistance through censorship prevented the performing of Banjin festivals, a festival in recognition of a new reconstructed Manchu identity, in Beijing.

==Phonology==
Written Manchu was close to being called an &quot;open syllable&quot; language because the only consonant that came regularly at the end of native words was , similar to Beijing Mandarin, Northeastern Mandarin, Jilu Mandarin and Japanese. This resulted in almost all native words ending in a vowel. In some words, there were vowels that were separated by consonant clusters, as in the words &quot;ilha&quot; (&#x27;flower&#x27;) and &quot;abka&quot; (&#x27;heaven&#x27;); however, in most words, the vowels were separated from one another by only single consonants.

This open syllable structure might not have been found in all varieties of spoken Manchu, but it was certainly found in the southern dialect that became the basis for the written language. It is also apparent that the open-syllable tendency of the Manchu language had been growing ever stronger for the several hundred years since written records of Manchu were first produced: consonant clusters that had appeared in older forms, such as &quot;abka&quot; and &quot;abtara-mbi&quot; (&#x27;to yell&#x27;), were gradually simplified, and the words began to be written as &quot;aga&quot; or &quot;aha&quot; (in this form meaning &#x27;rain&#x27;) and &quot;atara-mbi&quot; (&#x27;to cause a commotion&#x27;).

===Consonants===
 
Manchu has twenty consonants, shown in the table using each phoneme&#x27;s representation in the IPA, followed by its romanization in italics. was rare and found mostly in loanwords and onomatopoeiae, such as &quot;pak pik&quot; (&#x27;pow pow&#x27;). Historically, appears to have been common, but changed over time to . was also found mostly in loanwords and onomatopoeiae and there was no single letter in the Manchu alphabet to represent it, but rather a digraph of the letters for and . is usually transcribed with a digraph &quot;ni&quot;, and has thus often been considered a sequence of phonemes rather than a phoneme of its own, though work in Tungusic historical linguistics suggests that the Manchu palatal nasal has a very long history as a single segment, and so it is shown here as phonemic.

Early Western descriptions of Manchu phonology labeled Manchu &quot;b&quot; as &quot;soft p&quot;, Manchu &quot;d&quot; as &quot;soft t&quot;, and Manchu &quot;g&quot; as &quot;soft k&quot;, whereas Manchu &quot;p&quot; was &quot;hard p&quot;, &quot;t&quot; was &quot;hard t&quot;, and &quot;k&quot; was &quot;hard k&quot;. This suggests that the phonological contrast between the so-called voiced series (&quot;b, d, j, g&quot;) and the voiceless series (&quot;p, t, c, k&quot;) in Manchu as it was spoken during the early modern era was actually one of aspiration (as shown here) or tenseness, as in Mandarin.

 was affricated to in some or all contexts. , , and together with were palatalized before /i/ or /y/ to , , and , respectively. , and were backed before /a/, /ɔ/, or /ʊ/ to , , and respectively. Some scholars analyse these uvular realizations as belonging to phonemes separate from and , and they were distinguished in the Manchu alphabet, but are not distinguished in the romanization.

===Vowels===


The vowel &quot;e&quot; (generally pronounced like Mandarin [ɤ]) is pronounced as /e/ after &quot;y&quot;, as in niyengniyeri /ɲeŋɲeri/.

Between &quot;n&quot; and &quot;y&quot;, &quot;i&quot; is absorbed into both consonants as /ɲ/.

The relatively rare vowel transcribed &quot;ū&quot; (pronounced ) was usually found as a back vowel; however, in some cases, it was found occurring along with the front vowel &quot;e&quot;. Much disputation exists over the exact pronunciation of &quot;ū&quot;. Erich Hauer, a German sinologist and Manchurist, proposes that it was pronounced as a front rounded vowel initially, but a back unrounded vowel medially. William Austin suggests that it was a mid-central rounded vowel. The modern Xibe pronounce it identically to &quot;u&quot;.

==== Diphthongs ====
There are altogether eighteen diphthongs and six triphthongs. The diphthongs are &quot;ai&quot;, &quot;ao&quot;, &quot;ei&quot;, &quot;eo&quot;, &quot;ia&quot;, &quot;ie&quot;, &quot;ii&quot;, &quot;io&quot;, &quot;iu&quot;, &quot;oi&quot;, &quot;oo&quot;, &quot;ua&quot;, &quot;ue&quot;, &quot;ui&quot;, &quot;uo&quot;, &quot;ūa&quot;, &quot;ūe&quot;, &quot;ūi&quot;, and &quot;ūo&quot;. The triphthongs are &quot;ioa&quot;, &quot;ioo&quot; (which is pronounced as ), &quot;io(w)an&quot;, &quot;io(w)en&quot;, &quot;ioi&quot; (), and &quot;i(y)ao&quot;, and they exist in Chinese loanwords.

The diphthong &quot;oo&quot; is pronounced as , and the diphthong &quot;eo&quot; is pronounced as .

==== Stress ====
Stress in Manchu has been described in very different ways by different scholars. According to Paul Georg von Möllendorff (1892), it was always on the last syllable. In contrast, Ivan Zakharov (1879) gives numerous specific rules: on the one hand, he seems to say that every prosodic word lent slight prominence to the vowel of its first syllable by lengthening it, but on the other hand suffixes such as the case markers and the interrogative particles received stress, as did the perfect participle suffix and the optative suffix when these forms have future meaning. In the closely related Xibe, Jerry Norman (1974) found yet another system – stress was usually penultimate (rarely antepenultimate) in the stem and was not affected by the addition of suffixes, except for monosyllabic suffixes beginning in a voiceless sound, which were treated as part of the stem for the purposes of stress placement. Disyllabic suffixes sometimes had secondary stress of their own.

===Loanwords===
Manchu absorbed a large number of non-native sounds into the language from Chinese. There were special symbols used to represent the vowels of Chinese loanwords. These sounds are believed to have been pronounced as such, as they never occurred in native words. Among these, was the symbol for the high unrounded vowel (customarily romanized with a &quot;y&quot;, /ɨ/) found in words such as &quot;sy&quot; (Buddhist temple) and &quot;Sycuwan&quot; (Sichuan); and the triphthong &quot;ioi&quot; which is used for the Chinese &quot;ü&quot; sound. Chinese affricates were also represented with consonant symbols that were only used with loanwords such as in the case of &quot;dzengse&quot; (orange) (Chinese: &quot;chéngzi&quot;) and &quot;tsun&quot; (inch) (Chinese: &quot;cùn&quot;). In addition to the vocabulary that was borrowed from Chinese, such as the word &quot;pingguri&quot; (apple) (Chinese: píngguǒ), the Manchu language also had a large number of loanwords from other languages such as Mongolian, for example the words &quot;morin&quot; (horse) and &quot;temen&quot; (camel).

===Vowel harmony===
A crucial feature of the Manchu language is vowel harmony. It is described as based on the opposition between back and front vowels, but these phonological natural classes differ from the actual phonetic realization. The vowels &quot;a, o, ū&quot; function as back, as expected, but the only &quot;phonologically&quot; front vowel is &quot;e&quot; (even though it is &quot;phonetically&quot; central). Finally, the vowels &quot;i&quot; and &quot;u&quot; function as &quot;neutral&quot; vowels for the purposes of vowel harmony. As a rule, back and front vowels cannot co-occur in a word: in other words, the lone front vowel never occurs in a word with any the regular back vowels (&quot;a, o, ū&quot;). (An exception is the diphthong &quot;eo&quot;, which does occur in some words, i.e. &quot;deo&quot;, &quot;younger brother&quot;, &quot;geo&quot;, &quot;a mare&quot;, &quot;jeo&quot;, &quot;department&quot;, &quot;leole&quot;, &quot;to discuss&quot;, &quot;leose&quot;, &quot;building&quot;, and &quot;šeole&quot;, &quot;to embroider&quot;, &quot;to collect&quot;.) In contrast, the neutral vowels &quot;i&quot; and &quot;u&quot; are free to occur in a word with any other vowel or vowels.

The form of suffixes often varies depending on the rules of vowel harmony. Certain suffixes have only one form and are not affected by vowel harmony (e.g. &quot;de&quot;); these include the suffixes of the accusative, dative-locative and alternate ablative cases (&quot;be&quot;, &quot;de&quot;, &quot;deri&quot;), the suffix for the imperfect converb (-&quot;me&quot;) and the nominalizers (&quot;-ngge&quot;, &quot;-ningge&quot; and &quot;ba&quot;). Others have two forms (&quot;giyan/giyen&quot;, &quot;hiyan/hiyen&quot;, &quot;kiyan/kiyen&quot;), one of which is added to front-vowel stems and the other to back-vowel stems. Finally, there are also suffixes with three forms, either &quot;a/e/o&quot; (e.g. &quot;han/hen/hon&quot;) or &quot;o/ū/u&quot; (e.g. &quot;hon/hūn/hun&quot;). These are used in accordance with the following scheme:

The vowel harmony was traditionally described in terms of the philosophy of the &quot;I Ching&quot;. Syllables with front vowels were described as being as &quot;yin&quot; syllables whereas syllables with back vowels were called &quot;yang&quot; syllables. The reasoning behind this was that the language had a kind of sound symbolism where front vowels represented feminine objects or ideas and the back vowels represented masculine objects or ideas. As a result, there were a number of word pairs in the language in which changing the vowels also changed the gender of the word. For example, the difference between the words &quot;hehe&quot; (woman) and &quot;haha&quot; (man) or &quot;eme&quot; (mother) and &quot;ama&quot; (father) was essentially a contrast between the front vowel, [e], of the feminine and the back vowel, [a], of the masculine counterpart.

==Dialects==
Dialects of Manchu include a variety of its historical and remaining spoken forms throughout Manchuria, and the city of Beijing (the capital). Notable historical Manchu dialects include Beijing, Ningguta, Alcuka and Mukden dialects.

===Beijing Manchu dialect===


The Chinese Northern Mandarin dialect spoken in Beijing had a major influence on the phonology of the dialect of Manchu spoken in that city, and because Manchu phonology was transcribed into Chinese and European sources based on the sinicized pronunciation of Manchus from Beijing, the original authentic Manchu pronunciation is unknown to scholars.

The Manchus of Beijing were influenced by the Chinese dialect spoken in the area to the point where pronouncing Manchu sounds was hard for them, and they pronounced Manchu according to Chinese phonetics, whereas the Manchus of Aigun (in Heilongjiang) could both pronounce Manchu sounds properly and mimic the sinicized pronunciation of Manchus in Beijing, because they learned the Beijingese pronunciation from either studying in Beijing or from officials sent to Aigun from Beijing, and they could tell them apart, using the Chinese influenced Beijingese pronunciation when demonstrating that they were better educated or their superior stature in society.

====Changes in vowels====
Phonetically, there are some characteristics that differentiate the Beijing accent from the standard spelling form of Manchu. 
* There are some occasional vowel changes in a word. For example (&quot;cimari&quot; /t͡ʃʰimari/) is pronounced [t͡ʃʰumari], (&quot;ojorakū&quot; /ot͡ʃoraqʰʊ/) is pronounced [ot͡ɕiraqʰʊ], and (&quot;gisun&quot; /kisun/) is pronounced [kysun].
** In particular, when the vowel /o/ or diphthong /oi/ appears at the beginning of a word, it is frequently pronounced [ə] and [əi] respectively in Beijing accent. For example, (&quot;onggolo&quot; /oŋŋolo/) is pronounced [əŋŋolo], (&quot;oilo&quot; /oilo/) is pronounced [əilo].
* Diphthongization of vowels. /ə/ becomes /əi/ (such as &quot;dehi&quot; /təxi/ pronounced [təixi]), /a/ becomes [ai] (such as &quot;dagilambi&quot; /takilampi/ pronounced [taikilami]), and /i/ becomes [iu] (such as &quot;niru&quot; /niru/ pronounced [niuru], and &quot;nicuhe&quot; /nit͡ʃʰuxə/ pronounced [niut͡ʃʰuxə]).
* /oi/ becomes [uai], especially after /q/ (g). For example, &quot;goimbi&quot; /koimpi/ becomes [kuaimi].
* Loss of vowels under certain conditions. The vowel /i/ following consonant /t͡ʃʰ/ (c) or /t͡ʃ/ (j) usually disappears. For example, &quot;ecike&quot; /ət͡ʃʰikʰə/ is pronounced [ət͡ʃʰkʰə], and &quot;hojihon&quot; /χot͡ʃiχon/ is pronounced [χot͡ʃχon]. There are also other cases where a vowel disappears in Beijing accent. For example, &quot;ekšembi&quot; /əkʰʃəmpi/ is pronounced [əkʰʃmi], and &quot;burulambi&quot; /purulampi/ is pronounced [purlami].

====Changes in consonants====

This section is primarily based upon Aisin Gioro Yingsheng&#x27;s &quot;Miscellaneous Knowledge of Manchu&quot; (满语杂识).

* Systemic merger of /q/ and /χ/ into [ʁ], and /k/ and /x/ into [ɣ] between voiced phonemes. For example, (&quot;sargan&quot; /sɑrqɑn/) is pronounced as [sɑrʁɑn], and (&quot;urgun&quot; /urkun/) is pronounced as [urɣun].
* Conversely, /χ/ may be pronounced as [qʰ] at the beginning of a word. For example, (&quot;hamimbi&quot; /χɑmimpi/) is pronounced as [qʰamimi].
* Assmilation of alveolar and postalveolar stops after /n/. For example, (&quot;banjimbi&quot; /pɑnt͡ʃimpi/) is pronounced as [pɑnnimi], and (&quot;hendumbi&quot; /xəntumpi/) is pronounced as [xənnumi].
* /si/ is pronounced as [ʃɨ] in the middle of a word. For example, (&quot;usiha&quot; /usiχɑ/) is pronounced as [uʃɨʁɑ].

==Grammar==
===Syntax===
All Manchu phrases are head-final; the head-word of a phrase (e.g. the noun of a noun phrase, or the verb of a verb phrase) always falls at the end of the phrase. Thus, adjectives and adjectival phrases always precede the noun they modify, and the arguments to the verb always precede the verb. As a result, Manchu sentence structure is subject–object–verb (SOV).

Manchu uses a small number of case-marking particles that are similar to those found in Korean, but there is also a separate class of true postpositions. Case markers and postpositions can be used together, as in the following sentence:

In this example, the postposition , &quot;with&quot;, requires its nominal argument to have the genitive case, which causes the genitive case marker between the noun and the postposition.

Manchu also makes extensive use of converb structures and has an inventory of converbial suffixes to indicate the relationship between the subordinate verb and the finite verb that follows it. An example is these two sentences, which have finite verbs:


Both sentences can be combined into a single sentence by using converbs, which relate the first action to the second:

===Morphology===
While Manchu is a synthetic and agglutinative language typologically similar to the neighbouring Mongolic and Turkic languages, its morphology is nevertheless less complex than theirs and its synthetic character is not so pronounced as theirs.

==== Gender ====
Manchu has no grammatical gender, although the distinction between nouns referring to humans and nouns referring to non-humans does play a certain role in its grammar (as explained below). However, as already mentioned, biological gender is expressed by different vowels in a number of word pairs, where a phonologically back vowel is associated with males and a phonologically front one with females: &quot;ama&quot; &quot;father&quot; – &quot;eme&quot; &quot;mother&quot;, &quot;haha&quot; &quot;man&quot; – &quot;hehe&quot; &quot;woman&quot;, &quot;naca&quot; &quot;brother-in-law&quot; – &quot;nece&quot; &quot;sister-in-law&quot;, &quot;hūwašan&quot; (Chinese &quot;héshang&quot; ) &quot;monk&quot; – &quot;huwešen&quot; &quot;nun&quot;, &quot;amila&quot; &quot;male animal&quot; – &quot;emile&quot; &quot;female animal&quot;, &quot;arsalan&quot; &quot;lion&quot; – &quot;erselen&quot; &quot;lioness&quot;, &quot;garudai&quot; &quot;male phoenix&quot; – &quot;gerudei&quot; &quot;female phoenix&quot;; similarly for words related to genders such as &quot;habtaha&quot; &quot;man&#x27;s belt&quot; – &quot;hebtehe&quot; &quot;woman&#x27;s belt&quot;, &quot;ganggan&quot; &quot;strong&quot; – &quot;genggen&quot; &quot;weak&quot;.

====Number====

Only nouns referring to humans decline for number. The plural number is formed by the addition of several suffixes, depending on the specific noun. 
* The suffix &quot;-sa/se&quot; has broad usage: it is used, inter alia, with many words expressing occupations (&quot;faksi&quot; “workman” – &quot;faksisa “workmen”) and nationalities (&quot;manju&quot; &quot;Manchu&quot; – &quot;manjusa &quot;Manchus&quot;). 
* The suffix &quot;-ta/te&quot; is mostly limited to words denoting persons of a certain age or generation and relatives (&quot;ama&quot; &quot;father&quot; – &quot;amata &quot;fathers&quot;), although there are a few others such as &quot;ejen&quot; &quot;lord&quot; – &quot;ejete &quot;lords&quot;. However, the suffix &quot;-sa/se&quot; can also be used with nouns with the same types of meaning: &quot;gege&quot; &quot;elder sister&quot; – &quot;gegese&quot; &quot;elder sisters&quot;. 
* The less common suffix &quot;-si&quot; occurs in a number of nouns mostly with that type of meaning, too, e.g. in &quot;haha&quot; “man” — &quot;hahasi&quot; “men”. 
* Finally, a few words use the suffix &quot;-ri&quot;: &quot;mama&quot; &quot;grandmother&quot; – &quot;mamari&quot; &quot;grandmothers&quot;.

Note that the final consonant &quot;-n&quot; is normally lost before the plural suffixes: &quot;ahūn &quot;elder brother&quot; – &quot;ahūta &quot;elder brothers&quot;; the final &quot;-i&quot; is likewise lost in &quot;jui&quot; &quot;son&quot; – &quot;juse&quot; &quot;sons&quot;.

In addition, plurality can be expressed by the addition of some words meaning &quot;all&quot; or &quot;many&quot;, such as &quot;geren&quot; (geren niyalma&quot; “all/many men/persons”), by the addition of words meaning &quot;kind&quot; or &quot;class&quot; (&quot;gurgu jergi &quot;various wild animals&quot;, &quot;baita hacin &quot;various affairs&quot;), or by reduplication (&quot;jalan&quot; &quot;generation, world&quot; – &quot;jalan jalan &quot;generations, worlds&quot;).

====Cases====
Manchu has five cases, which are marked by particles: nominative, accusative, genitive, dative-locative, and ablative. The particles can be written with the noun to which they apply or separately. They do not obey the rule of vowel harmony but are also not truly postpositions.

=====Nominative=====
One of the principal syntactic cases, it is used for the subject of a sentence and has no overt marking.

=====Accusative=====
(&quot;be&quot;): one of the principal syntactic cases, it indicates participants/direct object of a sentence. It is written separate from the word that it follows.

Certain Manchu verbs govern the accusative in spite of the fact that verbs with similar semantics in other languages do not take a direct object:
Direct objects sometimes also take the nominative. It is commonly felt that the marked accusative has a definite sense, like using a definite article in English. However, in the negative form, transitive verbs always take the accusative:
The direct object expressing an object that is caused to perform an action also stands in the accusative:

The accusative may also indicate the space in which motion is happening or the means by which it is happening, as in &quot;jugūn be yabu-me&quot; (&quot;going along a road&quot;) and &quot;morin be yabu-me&quot; (&quot;riding a horse&quot;).

=====Genitive=====
(&quot;i&quot; or &quot;ni&quot;): one of the principal syntactic cases, it is used to indicate possession or the means by which something is accomplished. The allomorph &quot;ni&quot; is used after words ending in a consonant other than /n/, whereas &quot;i&quot; is used in all other cases: &quot;boo i&quot; &quot;of the house&quot;, but &quot;gurung ni&quot; &quot;of the palace&quot;.

Its primary function is to indicate the possessor of an entity:
It can also indicate a person&#x27;s relationships:
Sometimes a broader attributive relation (not necessarily a possessive one) is expressed, e.g. &quot;doro i yoro&quot; &quot;a ceremonial arrow&quot;.

Verbs and participles can also be modified by a phrase in the genitive, resulting in adverbial meaning:

Adverbs are regularly formed from nouns by a repetition of the noun followed by a genitive marker: &quot;giyan&quot; “order”, “proper” &gt; &quot;giyan giyan i&quot; “in proper order”.

=====Dative-locative=====
(&quot;de&quot;): indicates location, time, place, or indirect object.

Its primary function is to indicate the semantic role of the recipient:

It can also indicate a person who is in possession of something in the construction meaning &quot;A has B&quot;, which is expressed literally as &quot;To A (there) is B&quot;:

Another function is to indicate the instrument of action, making it play the role of an instrumental case as well:

However, the genitive can often express the same instrumental meaning. It has been claimed that the genitive is used for the instrument of one&#x27;s own actions as opposed to those of others (e.g. &quot;mini yasa i tuwa-ci&quot; &quot;Seeing with my eyes&quot; vs &quot;si yasa de tuwa-ki&quot; &quot;You see with your eyes&quot;) and for non-past actions as opposed to past ones (&quot;beye-i gala-i gaisu&quot; &quot;take with your own hand&quot; vs &quot;beye i gala de jafa-habi&quot; “(Someone) caught with his own hand”).

A related function is to express the agent of a verb in the passive voice:

The dative can also indicate the source of a statement or quotation, meaning roughly &quot;according to&quot;, as in &quot;mini gūnin de &quot;in my opinion&quot; and &quot;ejen i hese de &quot;according to the emperor&#x27;s edict&quot;.

Finally, as already mentioned, it can express location in space or time, thus functioning as a locative case:

=====Ablative=====
(&quot;ci&quot;): indicates the origin of an action or the basis for a comparison.

That can be the starting point in space or time:
It can also be used to compare objects:
In Classical Manchu, there was also a case marker &quot;deri&quot;, which has been said to have more or less the same ablative uses as &quot;ci&quot;; in Xibe, however, it differs from &quot;ci&quot; by being specialized for the expression of comparison:
===== Less-used cases =====

* Terminative: indicates the ending point of an action by the suffix &quot;-tala&quot;/&quot;-tele&quot;/&quot;-tolo&quot;.
* Indefinite allative: indicates &quot;to a place, to a situation&quot; when it is unknown whether the action reaches exactly to the place or situation or around or near it by the suffix &quot;-si&quot;.
* Indefinite locative: indicates &quot;at a place, in a situation&quot; when it is unknown whether the action happens exactly at the place or situation or around or near it by the suffix &quot;-la&quot;/&quot;-le&quot;/&quot;-lo&quot;.
* Indefinite ablative: indicates &quot;from a place, from a situation&quot; when it is unknown whether the action is really from the exact place or situation or around or near it by the suffix &quot;-tin&quot;.
* Distributive: indicates every one of something by the suffix &quot;-dari&quot;.
* Essive-formal: indicates a simile (&quot;as/like&quot;) by the suffix &quot;-gese&quot;.
* Identical: indicates that something is the same as something else by the suffix &quot;-ali&quot;/&quot;-eli&quot;/&quot;-oli&quot; (apparently derived from the word &quot;adali&quot;, meaning &quot;same&quot;).
* Orientative: indicates &quot;facing/toward&quot; (something/an action) and shows only position and tendency, not movement into by the suffix &quot;-ru&quot;.
* Revertive: indicates &quot;backward&quot; or &quot;against (something)&quot; from the root &#x27;ca&#x27; (see &quot;cargi&quot;, &quot;coro&quot;, &quot;cashu-n&quot;, etc.) by the suffix &quot;-ca&quot;/&quot;-ce&quot;/&quot;-co&quot;.
* Translative: indicates change in the quality or form of something by the suffix &quot;-ri&quot;.
* Indefinite accusative: indicates that the touch of the verb on the object is not surely complete by the suffix &quot;-a&quot;/&quot;-e&quot;/&quot;-o&quot;/&quot;-ya&quot;/&quot;-ye&quot;/&quot;-yo&quot;.

In addition, there were some suffixes, such as the primarily-adjective-forming suffix &quot;-ngga&quot;/&quot;-ngge&quot;/&quot;-nggo&quot;, that appear to have originally been case markers (in the case of &quot;-ngga&quot;, marking the genitive case) but had already lost their productivity to become fossilized in certain lexemes by the time of the earliest written records of the Manchu language: &quot;agangga&quot; &quot;pertaining to rain&quot; as in &quot;agangga sara&quot; (an umbrella), derived from Manchu &quot;aga&quot; (rain).

==== Pronouns ====
Manchu personal pronouns have a clusivity distinction and mostly use the same case markers as nouns, but with some stem changes.

The 3rd person pronouns are used with human referents, but do not refer to non-humans. With non-humans, the demonstrative pronouns &quot;ere&quot; &quot;this&quot; and &quot;tere&quot; &quot;that&quot; are used instead. Possession can be expressed with the genitive form of the personal pronouns: &quot;mini boo&quot; &quot;my house&quot;, &quot;sini boo&quot; „your (sing.) house“, &quot;musei boo&quot; &quot;our house&quot; etc. Like English, Manchu has special forms for substantively used possessive pronouns; these are formed with the suffix &quot;-ngge&quot;: &quot;miningge&quot; &quot;mine&quot;, &quot;gūwaingge&quot; &quot;somebody else&#x27;s&quot;.

As in other East Asian languages, educated Manchus in the imperial period tended to avoid personal pronouns, especially for the first and second person, and often used paraphrases instead. For example, Manchu officials, when talking to the Emperor, referred to themselves with the word &quot;aha&quot; &quot;slave&quot; (instead of the pronoun &quot;bi&quot; &quot;I&quot;), and Han Chinese ones used &quot;amban&quot; &quot;subject&quot;. The Emperor, when talking to Manchu princes (&quot;amban&quot; and &quot;beile&quot;), called himself &quot;sitahūn niyalma&quot; &quot;wretched person&quot; or &quot;emteli beye&quot; &quot;orphan&quot;. In general, calques from Chinese were used. Another alternative were combinations of the personal pronouns in genitive and the word &quot;beye&quot; &quot;self&quot;: &quot;mini beye&quot; &quot;I&quot; (lit. &quot;my self&quot;), &quot;sini beye&quot; &quot;you (polite)&quot; (lit. &quot;your self&quot;).

The demonstrative pronouns are formed with the stems &quot;e-&quot; and &quot;u-&quot; for proximal (close) entities and &quot;te-&quot; and &quot;tu-&quot; for distal (far) entitites: &quot;ere&quot; &quot;this&quot;, &quot;enteke&quot; &quot;such&quot;, &quot;ubaingge&quot; &quot;local (from here)&quot;; &quot;tere&quot; &quot;that&quot;, &quot;tenteke&quot; &quot;such&quot;, &quot;tubaingge&quot; &quot;local (from there)&quot;.

The demonstrative pronouns &quot;ere&quot; &quot;this&quot; and &quot;tere&quot; &quot;that&quot; can also be used alone like personal pronouns (and are obligatorily so for non-human referents). They form the plural with &quot;-se&quot; and are declined in a way that isn&#x27;t always entirely regular:

When pronouns function as attributes, the case marker is not placed after the pronoun, but only after the noun:

The most important interrogative pronouns are &quot;we&quot; &quot;who&quot;, &quot;ai&quot; &quot;what&quot;, &quot;ya&quot; &quot;what, which&quot; (attributive), &quot;aika&quot;, &quot;aimaka&quot;, &quot;yaka&quot; , &quot;yamaka&quot; &quot;what sort of&quot;, &quot;aba&quot;, &quot;aiba&quot;, &quot;yaba&quot; &quot;where&quot;, &quot;eke&quot; &quot;who is this?&quot;, &quot;udu&quot; &quot;how much/many?&quot;, &quot;ainu&quot; &quot;how, why?&quot;. The following table exemplifies the case declension of interrogative pronouns:

The pronouns &quot;ai&quot;, &quot;ya&quot; and &quot;we&quot; are also used as relative pronouns.

The most important indefinite pronouns are &quot;we we&quot; &quot;whoever&quot;; &quot;ai ai&quot;, &quot;ya ya&quot; &quot;whatever&quot;, &quot;aika&quot;, &quot;aimaka&quot;, &quot;yaka&quot;, &quot;yamaka&quot; &quot;whatever, whichever (attributive)&quot;; &quot;ememu&quot;, &quot;ememungge&quot; &quot;many&quot;, &quot;gūwa&quot; &quot;someone (else)&quot;; &quot;eiten&quot;, &quot;yaya&quot;, &quot;beri beri&quot;, &quot;meni meni&quot;, &quot;meimeni&quot;, &quot;geren&quot; &quot;every&quot;, &quot;all&quot;.

==== Adjectives ====
Adjectives in Manchu are not very distinct from nouns as regards their grammatical properties, so many scholars have argued that they are not a separate part of speech; it has been claimed that they are simply a special type of nouns with semantics of quality.

An adjective as an attribute stands without case suffixes in front of the noun.

As a predicate it stands at the end of the clause.

The adjective itself does not have comparison as an inflectional category; instead, comparisons are formed just by inflecting the compared noun in the ablative.
==== Final particles ====
Final particles can be used as copulas. The most important final particles are &quot;kai&quot; (confirming), &quot;be&quot; (defining), &quot;akū&quot; (negating, &quot;there is not&quot;), &quot;waka&quot; (negating, &quot;is not&quot;), &quot;dere&quot; (suppositional, &quot;probably&quot;), &quot;inu&quot; (also as an adverb: affirmative); &quot;dabala&quot; (restricting, &quot;only&quot;), &quot;semeo&quot; (admirative or dubitative), &quot;unde&quot; (also a conjunction; &quot;not yet&quot;); &quot;jiya/jiye&quot; (exalamatory), &quot;bai&quot; (with imperative; &quot;just&quot;), &quot;na/ne/no&quot;, &quot;ya&quot; (interrogative, also exclamatory). Of the interrogative particles, &quot;na&quot; is placed after nouns as well as verbs, whereas &quot;o&quot; is placed after verbs only (both in yes/no-questions), and &quot;ni&quot; is placed in the end of the sentence (and occurs also in WH-questions): e.g. &quot;boo de gemu sain-na &quot;Is everything well at home?&quot;, &quot;ere ai bi-he ni &quot;What is this?&quot;, &quot;gasha be&quot; &quot;eigen gai-ci o-mbi-o?&quot; &quot;May I take a bird as a husband?&quot;, lit. &quot;If taking a bird as a husband, does it become?&quot;

==== Verbs ====
The Manchu verb has no number and person agreement. The pure verb stem functions as the imperative of the second person, singular and plural; otherwise the verb takes participial, converbal and verbal suffixes, which also express mood and aspect. It has been argued that the aspect contrast to some extent has acquired the function of a tense contrast as well, because the perfect and imperfect participles have partly developed a secondary meaning of past and present-future tense, respectively.

There are 13 basic verb forms, some of which can be further modified with the verb &quot;bi&quot; (is), or the particles &quot;akū, i, o,&quot; and &quot;ni&quot; (negative, instrumental, and interrogatives). 
===== Participles =====
Participles play an important role in Manchu grammar, because most finite forms are derived from them. They can have four different functions in the sentence:

# They can be used attributively. 
# They can receive nominalizing suffixes – among them case markers – and in that form, they can function like nouns as subject, object, etc. 
# They can function as the head of the predicate in the equivalent of a dependent clause.
# They can function as the head of the predicate of a sentence, even without a copula.

====== Imperfect participle ======
The imperfect participle is formed by adding the variable suffix &quot;-ra, -re, -ro&quot; to the stem of the verb. &quot;Ra&quot; occurs when the final syllable of the stem contains an &quot;a&quot;. &quot;Re&quot; occurs when the final syllable of the stem contains &quot;e&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, &quot;u&quot; or &quot;ū&quot;. &quot;Ro&quot; occurs with stems containing all &quot;o&quot;&#x27;s. An irregular suffix &quot;-dara, -dere, -doro&quot; is added to a limited group of irregular verbs (&quot;jon-, wen-, ban-&quot;) with a final &quot;-n&quot;. (The perfect participle of these verbs is also irregular). Three of the most common verbs in Manchu also have irregular forms for the imperfect participle:

* &quot;bi-, bisire&quot; — &#x27;be&#x27;
* &quot;o-, ojoro&quot; — &#x27;become&#x27;
* &quot;je-, jetere&quot; — &#x27;eat&#x27;

Imperfect participles can be used as objects, attributes, and predicates. Using &quot;ume&quot; alongside the imperfect participle makes a negative imperative.

As an attribute:When this form is used predicatively it is usually translated as a future tense in English; it often carries an indefinite or conditional overtone when used in this fashion:As an object:

====== Perfect participle ======
The perfect participle in &quot;-ha/-he/-ho&quot; often expresses an action in the past tense: e.g. &quot;araha&quot;, while originally meaning &quot;who has written&quot;, can also be used in the sense &quot;(I, you, etc.) wrote&quot;. Certain verbs take, instead of &quot;-ha/-he/-ho,&quot; the ending &quot;-ka/-ke/-ko&quot;, fewer still take &quot;-nka/-nke/-nko&quot;, and a few have irregular forms: &quot;bahambi&quot; &quot;find&quot; – &quot;baha&quot;, &quot;hafumbi&quot; &quot;penetrate&quot; – &quot;hafuka&quot;.

====== Relative/indefinite participle ======
When the indefinite pronoun &quot;ele&quot; &quot;all&quot; is added to a perfective or imperfective participle, the resulting form has a relative/indefinite meaning: &quot;bisire ele jaka&quot; &quot;whatever things are present&quot;, &quot;mini alaha ele ba&quot; &quot;whatever I said&quot;, &quot;everything I said&quot;. The pronoun can also merge into the preceding word as a suffix &quot;-le&quot;: &quot;arahale&quot;, &quot;ararale&quot; „whoever writes“, &quot;whatever is written&quot;, &quot;duleke ele ba&quot; &quot;whatever places he passed by&quot;, &quot;all places he passed by&quot;. This suffix didn&#x27;t exhibit vowel-harmony alternations in older Manchu, but it later acquired the back variant &quot;-la.&quot;

====== Durative participle ======
The durative participle in &quot;-mbihe&quot; appears to originate from the imperfect converb in &quot;-me&quot; and the perfect participle &quot;bihe&quot; of the verb &quot;bi-&quot; &quot;to be&quot;: thus, almost literally, &quot;(which) was doing (something)&quot;. It expresses an incomplete or continuing action in the past: &quot;arambihe&quot; &quot;(I was) writing&quot;.
===== Nominalization =====
Both participles and verbs in the perfect or imperfect form can be nominalized with the suffix &quot;-ngge.&quot; These nominalized forms can express either the abstract notion of an action, the object of an action or the subject of an action: &quot;arahangge&quot;, &quot;ararangge&quot; &quot;writing&quot;, &quot;something written&quot;, &quot;someone writing&quot;.

Negated forms can be nominalized like this as well: &quot;akdarakūngge&quot; &quot;distrust&quot;, &quot;one who does not trust&quot;.

Direct speech and quotes are often introduced with nominalized forms like &quot;alarangge&quot; &quot;tell, narrate&quot;, &quot;hendurengge&quot; &quot;speak&quot;, &quot;serengge&quot; &quot;say&quot;, &quot;fonjirengge&quot; &quot;ask&quot; or &quot;wesimburengge&quot; &quot;relate, report&quot;, for example:

Participles can also be nominalized with &quot;ba&quot; &quot;place, circumstance, thing&quot;: e.g. &quot;sere ba&quot; &quot;what is said&quot;, &quot;speech&quot;, &quot;afabu ha ba bi&quot; &quot;there is an order&quot; (lit.&quot;A thing which has been ordered exists&quot;).

===== Converbs =====
Converbs (sometimes referred to as gerunds) have an adverbial function, and constructions with them often correspond to subordinate clauses in English.

====== Imperfect converb ======
The imperfect converb in &quot;-me&quot; expresses an action that is simultaneous with that of the finite verb, but it may also denote secondary meanings such as manner, condition, cause and purpose, and it can often be translated with an infinitive in English. This is the most frequent type of converb: &quot;arame&quot; &quot;(while) writing&quot;, &quot;hendume&quot; &quot;(while) saying&quot;, &quot;fonjime&quot; &quot;(while) asking&quot;, &quot;necihiyeme toktobumbi&quot; &quot;conquer&quot;, lit. &quot;stabilise, (while) levelling&quot; (a calque of Chinese &quot;píng-dìng&quot; ).


====== Durative converb ======
The imperfect converb ending &quot;-me&quot; can be added not only to the stem, but also to the finite imperfect form in &quot;-mbi&quot; (which, in turn, is originally also a combination of an imperfect converb and the copula verb &quot;bi&quot; &quot;is&quot;, see below)&quot;.&quot; The resulting form ending in &quot;-mbime&quot; has been described as a separate durative converb&quot;,&quot; which expresses a non-completed or continuing action. An example is &quot;arambime&quot; (&lt; &quot;ara-me bi-me&quot;) “while writing”. This form is also used in the following quote by Confucius:
====== Perfect converb ======
The perfect converb in &quot;-fi&quot; expresses an action that took place before the action of the finite verb; a secondary meaning is one of cause. It is the second most frequent converb: &quot;arafi&quot; &quot;(after) having written&quot;, &quot;after I wrote&quot;, or, more idiomatically, &quot;I wrote and ...&quot;.

A frozen form is &quot;ofi&quot; &quot;because, since&quot; (from &quot;ombi&quot; &quot;be&quot;, &quot;become&quot;):

Certain verbs have irregular forms: &quot;juwambi&quot; &quot;open&quot; – &quot;juwampi&quot;, &quot;colgorombi&quot; &quot;exceed&quot; – &quot;colgoropi&quot;, &quot;hafumbi&quot; &quot;penetrate&quot; – &quot;hafupi&quot;.

A similar meaning is expressed by adding the ending not to the stem, but to the finite imperfect form in &quot;-mbi&quot;, resulting in &quot;-mbifi&quot;: &quot;arambifi&quot; &quot;having written&quot;.

====== Conditional converb ======
The conditional converb in &quot;-ci&quot; can express a condition, but also the time when something happened: &quot;araci &quot;if, when you write&quot;; &quot;si niyalma de nikeneci &quot;if you rely on people&quot;; &quot;yamun de tucifi tuwaci&quot; &quot;as/when he went out to the hall and checked...&quot;.

Frozen forms are &quot;oci&quot; and &quot;seci&quot; &quot;if&quot; (from &quot;ombi&quot; &quot;be&quot; and &quot;sembi&quot; &quot;say&quot;). They can also serve as topic markers.

====== Concessive/adversative converb ======
The concessive or adversative converb in &quot;-cibe&quot; forms a construction that can be translated as &quot;even if&quot; or &quot;although&quot;: &quot;aracibe&quot; &quot;even if I write&quot;. It appears to be derived from the conditional.

====== Terminative converb ======
The terminative converb in &quot;-tala/-tele/-tolo&quot; can be translated with clauses introduced by &quot;until&quot;; it expresses a subordinate action that is taking place simultaneously with that of the finite verb, and the latter continues until the first one is finished. &quot;hūsun moho-tolo&quot; &quot;until his power is exhausted&quot;.

In Classical Manchu this form is no longer very productive. The most frequent forms are &quot;isitala&quot; &quot;until&quot; (from &quot;isimbi&quot; &quot;reach&quot;) and &quot;otolo&quot; &quot;until&quot; (from &quot;ombi&quot; &quot;be&quot;, &quot;become&quot;):
====== Descriptive converb ======
The converb with the suffixes &quot;-hai/-hei/-hoi&quot; or &quot;-kai/-kei/-koi&quot;, also &quot;-tai/-tei/-toi&quot;, expresses durative, periodic, frequent or intensive actions or processes: &quot;alahai&quot; &quot;telling many times&quot;, &quot;jonkoi&quot; &quot;constantly reminding&quot;. It appears to be derived from the perfect participle in &quot;-ha/he/ho&quot; (also &quot;-ka/ke/ko&quot; in some verbs) and the genitive ending &quot;-i&quot; in its adverbial function. Such forms have sometimes turned into adverbs: &quot;cohotoi&quot; &quot;especially&quot; from &quot;cohombi&quot; &quot;to do especially, regard as the most important aspect&quot;. Other examples of this use are the phrases &quot;beye be waliyatai&quot; &quot;selflessly&quot;, lit. &quot;constantly throwing oneself around&quot;, and &quot;bucetei afambi&quot; &quot;to fight to the death&quot;, lit. &quot;to fight, constantly dying&quot;.

====== Converb in -nggala/-nggele/-nggolo ======
The converb in &quot;-nggala/-nggele/-nggolo&quot; can be translated with the conjunction &quot;before&quot;; it expresses a subordinate action that has not yet taken place at the time of the main one and will only take place &quot;after&quot; it: &quot;aranggala&quot; &quot;before writing&quot;; &quot;dosinggala asuki isibumbi&quot; &quot;before entering, one makes a noise&quot;. A frozen form is &quot;onggolo&quot; &quot;before&quot;.

===== Finite forms =====
The Manchu finite verbal forms are set apart from others by the fact that they can function &quot;only&quot; as heads of the predicate in an independent clause. (As already mentioned, some participles can have the same function, but they are not limited to it.) All Manchu indicative verbal forms seem to be derived from non-finite ones such as participles and converbs.

====== Imperfect indicative ======
The imperfect is formed with the suffix &quot;-mbi&quot;, which is derived from the imperfect converb ending &quot;-me&quot; and the copula verb &quot;-bi&quot; &quot;to be&quot;. This is the dictionary form of the verb. The meaning of the form is of present or future tense. It can express usual, frequent, generic actions, concrete actions in the present, or actions in the future:


====== Perfect indicative ======
The perfect indicative form in &quot;-habi/-hebi/-hobi&quot; is derived from the perfect participle in &quot;-ha/-he/-ho&quot; and the copula verb &quot;-bi&quot; &quot;to be&quot;. It expresses an action in the past: &quot;arahabi&quot; &quot;I wrote, I have written.&quot;

The second part of the suffix, originating from the copula verb &quot;bi-&quot;, can also be replaced by &quot;kai&quot;: &quot;alahabi&quot;, &quot;alaha kai&quot; &quot;narrated&quot;.

Frequentative indicative

The form in &quot;-mbihebi&quot; is derived from the durative participle and the verb &quot;bi-&quot; &quot;to be&quot;. It expresses usual and frequent actions in the distant past:

===== Imperative =====
The pure stem forms the imperative: &quot;ala&quot; &quot;Report!&quot;, &quot;te&quot; &quot;Sit down!&quot;, &quot;wa&quot; &quot;Kill!&quot;

There is also a stronger form of command in &quot;-kini&quot;, which is directed at a person of lower rank and which is used also as an optative or impersonal imperative of the third person: &quot;arakini&quot; &quot;Let him write!&quot;, &quot;okini&quot; &quot;Let it be so!&quot;, &quot;alakini&quot; &quot;Let it be reported!&quot;, &quot;Let him report!&quot;, &quot;genekini&quot; &quot;Let him go!“. It may be used to command another person to cause a third person to do something.

Another, milder form of command is formed with the ending &quot;-cina&quot; or &quot;-kina&quot;, which is used in a concessive sense as well: &quot;amasi bucina&quot; &quot;Come on / please, give it back!&quot;; &quot;alacina&quot;, &quot;alakina&quot; &quot;Speak (if you want to)&quot; or &quot;Please speak!&quot;; &quot;aracina&quot; &quot;Let him write (if he wants to)&quot;. It appears to be derived from the optative form (on which see below) and the interrogative particle &quot;-na&quot;.

A prohibitative form (corresponding to Chinese &quot;mò&quot; ) is constructed from the imperfect converb preceded by &quot;ume&quot; : &quot;ume genere&quot; &quot;Don&#x27;t go!“, &quot;ume fonjire&quot; &quot;Don&#x27;t ask!&quot;

Certain verbs have irregular imperative forms: &quot;baimbi&quot; &quot;seek&quot;, &quot;request&quot; – &quot;baisu&quot;; &quot;bimbi&quot; &quot;be present&quot;, &quot;remain&quot; – &quot;bisu&quot;; &quot;jembi&quot; &quot;eat&quot; – &quot;jefu&quot;; &quot;-njimbi&quot; &quot;come in order to …&quot; – &quot;-nju&quot;; &quot;ombi&quot; &quot;be, become&quot; – &quot;osu.&quot;

===== Optative =====
The optative in &quot;-ki&quot; expresses an action that the speaker wishes or intends to see performed – either by themselves or by others. Its meaning is sometimes akin to that of Chinese &quot;yào&quot; . Thus &quot;bi geneki&quot; means &quot;I will go&quot;, whereas &quot;i geneki&quot; means &quot;Let him go&quot;. Other examples are &quot;araki&quot; &quot;I will/want to write&quot;, &quot;alaki&quot; &quot;I will/want to say&quot;, &quot;bi manju gisun be taciki&quot; &quot;I will/want to learn Manchu&quot;, &quot;fa hūbalaki&quot; &quot;I will paper over the windows“, &quot;teki&quot; &quot;please, sit down&quot;. When the optative refers to the second or third person, its meaning is close to that of an imperative. When it refers to an action that hasn&#x27;t yet taken place, it also has the additional meaning of future.

==== Negation ====
According to Gorelova, neither the finite verb forms nor the converbs have special negative forms; only the participle does. If a verb or converb need to be negated, a participle must be used instead of them. The participle is negated by a combination with the word &quot;akū&quot; &quot;not be (here)&quot;: thus, literally, &quot;I am-not doing-X&quot;. Still, Möllendorff (1892) does give an example of the negation of an indicative form with &quot;akū&quot; &quot;not (be)&quot;: &quot;bi gisurembi akū&quot; &quot;I don&#x27;t speak&quot;. The particle may be translated with the Chinese particles &quot;wú&quot; , &quot;bù&quot; , &quot;wèi&quot; , &quot;méiyǒu&quot; .

===== Negation with &quot;akū&quot; =====
The word &quot;akū&quot; &quot;is not&quot; is the most universal negator in Manchu. It is a negative copula: &quot;mangga&quot; &quot;akū &quot;&quot;it is not difficult&quot;. It can negate existence: &quot;etuku akū&quot; &quot;there is no clothing.&quot; It may also negate attributes, as in &quot;dutu akū&quot; &quot;not deaf&quot;, and it may express the meaning &quot;without&quot;: &quot;gūnin akū niyalma,&quot; lit. &quot;a person without brains&quot;, i.e. &quot;a stupid person&quot;.

The participle suffixes &quot;-ra/-re/-ro&quot; merge with &quot;akū&quot; into &quot;-rakū&quot;, &quot;-ha/-ho&quot; into &quot;-hakū&quot; and &quot;-he&quot; into &quot;-hekū&quot;: &quot;arahaku&quot; &quot;not have written&quot;, &quot;genehekū&quot;, &quot;genehakū&quot; &quot;not have gone&quot;; &quot;ararakū&quot; &quot;not (be going to) write&quot;, &quot;generakū&quot; &quot;not (be going to) go“.

Accordingly, the negated forms of perfect indicative &quot;-habi/-hebi/-hobi&quot; , which contain the perfect participle in &quot;-ha/he/ho,&quot; end in &quot;-hakūbi/-hekūbi&quot;. There are certain irregular forms: &quot;sambi&quot; &quot;know&quot; – &quot;sarkū&quot; &quot;don&#x27;t know&quot;, &quot;dabahakū&quot; &quot;has not exceeded“, &quot;jihekū&quot; &quot;has not come&quot;.

The negated participles are often followed by converb forms of the auxiliary verbs &quot;bimbi&quot; &quot;be&quot;, &quot;ombi&quot; &quot;become&quot; or &quot;sembi&quot; &quot;say&quot;:

The negated form of the conditional converb here is the construction &quot;gaijirakū oci&quot; (&quot;if … doesn&#x27;t take&quot;).

The suffixes &quot;-ci&quot;, &quot;-fi&quot; and &quot;-ngge&quot; are placed after &quot;-akū&quot; : &quot;ararakūci &quot;if he doesn&#x27;t write&quot;, &quot;ararakūfi &quot;doesn&#x27;t write and&quot;, &quot;not having written&quot;, &quot;ararakūngge &quot;the one who does not write&quot;, &quot;bisirakūngge &quot;those who aren&#x27;t here&quot; (Chinese &quot;bù zài de&quot; ).

The word &quot;akū&quot; alone can take other suffixes, too: &quot;bi akūmbi&quot; &quot;I am not&quot;. A double negation in &quot;-akūngge akū&quot; (Chinese &quot;wú bù&quot; ) is also possible: &quot;serakūngge akū&quot; &quot;nothing unsaid&quot;, &quot;he says everything&quot;.

The word &quot;umai&quot;, which seems to consist of the prohibitative particle &quot;ume&quot; and the pronoun &quot;ai&quot; &quot;what&quot;, may be used before &quot;akū&quot; and seems to enhance its negative sense, as seen in the example &quot;umai niyalma&quot; &quot;akū&quot; &quot;no persons (at all) are there&quot;.

===== Negation with &quot;waka&quot; =====
The particle &quot;waka&quot; is used predominantly as a negative copula. Examples are &quot;bi waka aniya kai&quot; &quot;I am not (at fault), it is the (bad) year&quot;, &quot;inu ja baita waka&quot; &quot;this is not a simple matter&quot;.

===== Negation with &quot;unde&quot; =====
The word &quot;unde&quot; &quot;not yet&quot; is placed after the imperfect participle in &quot;-ra/-re/-ro&quot; at the end of the clause: &quot;jidere unde&quot; &quot;(he) has not come yet&quot;, &quot;bi sabure unde&quot; &quot;I have not seen it yet&quot;.

===== Apprehension =====
The imperfect participle can be combined with &quot;-hū&quot; to produce a form that expresses apprehension/fear (&quot;participium metuendi&quot;; cf. Mongolian &quot;-ujai&quot;): &quot;jiderahū&quot; &quot;If only he doesn&#x27;t come“. 

Gorelova believes that this form is originally identical to the negation of the imperfect participle in -&quot;ra-(a)kū.&quot;

==== Interrogative forms ====
Interrogative forms are derived from declarative ones by the edition of further suffixes. The particle &quot;-o&quot; can be added to a verbal form in order to convert a statements into a yes/no-question. It is added to the copula &quot;bi-&quot;, the imperfect indicative in &quot;-mbi&quot; (which also ends in &quot;-bi&quot;) and to the imperfect and perfect participles in &quot;-ra/re-/ro&quot; and &quot;-ha/he/ho&quot;, forming respectively the sequences &quot;-bio&quot;, &quot;-mbio&quot;, &quot;-rao/-reo/-roo&quot;, &quot;-hao/-heo/-hoo&quot;. In these sequences, &quot;-o&quot; is pronounced /u/. Some examples are: &quot;Minde bureo?&quot; &quot;Will you give it to me?&quot;; &quot;Si terebe tuwahao? Tuwaha.&quot; &quot;Have you seen him? – Yes.&quot; S&quot;i cai omihao?&quot; &quot;Have you drunk tea?&quot; The particle &quot;-o&quot; can also be added to the negative particle &quot;waka&quot;: &quot;Manju bithe hūlambi wakao?&quot; &quot;Are you not studying the Manchu language?&quot; (lit. &quot;Are you not reading Manchu books?&quot;).

The imperfect interrogative form in &quot;-rao/-reo/-roo&quot; can also be used as an imperative to older or socially superior persons: &quot;tereo?&quot; &quot;Please sit down!&quot;, lit. &quot;Will (you) sit down?&quot; 

The universal interrogative particle is &quot;-ni&quot;. It can be added to verb forms to produce yes/no-questions in the same way as &quot;-o;&quot; after negatives, however, it is reduced to &quot;-n&quot;: &quot;si sabu-rakū-n?&quot; &quot;Have you not seen?&quot;, &quot;suwe sambio sarkūn&quot; &quot;Do you know this or do you not know it?&quot;, &quot;si sembi akūn?&quot; &quot;Do you eat it or not?&quot; In addition, the words &quot;sain&quot; &quot;good&quot;, &quot;well&quot; and &quot;yargiyan&quot; &quot;true, real, truth, reality&quot; had the special interrogative forms &quot;saiyūn&quot; and &quot;yargiyūn&quot;: &quot;si saiyūn?&quot; &quot;How are you?&quot;, &quot;yargiyūn?&quot; &quot;Is it true?&quot;

Furthermore, it can be used in wh-questions and be added to nouns and adjectives as well (&quot;ere ai turgun ni &quot;&quot;What is the reason for this?&quot;). It generally stands at the end of a sentence: &quot;ainu urunakū aisi be hendumbini&quot; &quot;Why do we necessarily have to talk about profits?&quot;

The combination &quot;nio&quot; can be added to negations to form rhetorical questions: &quot;ere sain akū nio&quot; &quot;is that not beautiful?&quot;

==== Auxiliary verbs ====
Composite verb forms are constructed with the auxiliary verbs &quot;bimbi&quot;, &quot;bi&quot; &quot;be, exist, remain&quot;, &quot;ombi&quot; &quot;be/become (such), be possible&quot;, &quot;sembi&quot; &quot;say, tell, consider&quot;, &quot;acambi&quot; &quot;be suitable&quot;, &quot;mutembi&quot; &quot;be able to&quot; and &quot;hamimbi&quot; &quot;approach, be near&quot;.

===== bimbi &quot;to be&quot; =====

* Indefinite future – imperfect participle with optative: &quot;genere biki&quot; &quot;I will go&quot;, &quot;I will be there&quot;.
* Definite perfect – Perfect participle with &quot;bi&quot;: &quot;wajiha bi&quot; &quot;is finished&quot; (note that this same construction is the origin of the indicative perfect).
* Past perfect – the perfect participle in &quot;-ha/-he/-ho&quot; forms together with the past form of the copula, &quot;bihe,&quot; a past perfect tense: &quot;araha bihe&quot; &quot;I had written&quot;, &quot;tere bade tehe bihe&quot; &quot;he had sat down there&quot;, &quot;tuwaha bihe&quot; &quot;he had seen it&quot;
* Durative past perfect – perfect participle with &quot;bihebi.&quot;
* Hypothesis – perfect participle with &quot;bici&quot; or with &quot;bihe bici&quot;: &quot;arahabici&quot; &quot;if I had written&quot;, &quot;ehe niyalma de hajilaha bici&quot; &quot;If you had become involved with bad people&quot;.
* Preterite – The imperfect converb with &quot;bihe&quot; expresses a continuous action that has come to an end: &quot;alame bihe&quot; &quot;he used to say&quot;.
* Imperative –The synthetic forms of the imperative can be replaced with analytical forms consisting of a converb and &quot;bisu&quot; (the imperative of &quot;bimbi&quot;): &quot;ala&quot; – &quot;alame bisu.&quot;

===== ombi &quot;to be, become&quot; =====

* Imperative – The synthetical forms of the imperative can be replaced with analytical forms consisting of a converb and &quot;osu,&quot; the imperative of &quot;ombi&quot;: &quot;ala&quot; – &quot;alame osu.&quot;

===== sembi &quot;to say&quot; =====

* Imperative – The synthetical forms of the imperative can be replaced with analytical forms consisting of a converb and &quot;sereo&quot;: &quot;alarao&quot; – &quot;alame sereo.&quot;

==== Voice ====

===== Passive and causative =====
Voice is a somewhat problematic and controversial category in Manchu. The form for passive voice in Manchu is generally formed with the suffix &quot;-bu&quot; :

In certain verbs, the passive is formed with the suffix &quot;-mbu&quot; instead, although it has also been claimed to have a different shade of meaning.

Many verbs in the passive voice have a reflexive meaning:

Surprisingly, the suffix &quot;-bu&quot; (or, in many cases, &quot;-mbu&quot;) also expresses the causative: this, &quot;arambumbi&quot; means &quot;be written&quot;, but also &quot;make (someone) write&quot;.
The combination of both suffixes &quot;-mbu&quot; and &quot;-bu&quot; is also possible in order to form a passive causative construction: &quot;arambubumbi&quot; &quot;have (something) written&quot;, lit. &quot;make (something) be written&quot;.

===== Reciprocal =====
The reciprocal voice is formed with &quot;-ndu&quot;: &quot;aisilambi&quot; &quot;help&quot; – &quot;aisilandumbi&quot; &quot;help each other&quot;.

===== Associative =====
The associative voice is formed with &quot;-ca/-ce/-co&quot; or with &quot;-nu&quot;: &quot;ilimbi&quot; &quot;stand&quot; – &quot;ilicambi&quot; &quot;to stand together in a group“, &quot;afambi&quot; &quot;fight&quot; – &quot;afanumbi&quot; &quot;fight together with others&quot;.

==== Aspect: durative, frequentative and intensive ====
The durative aspect can be expressed by the suffixes &quot;-ta/-te/-to&quot;, &quot;-nja/-nje/-njo&quot; or &quot;-ša/-še/-šo&quot;, the iterative by &quot;-ta/-te&quot; and the frequentative or intensive by &quot;-ca/-ce/-co&quot;: &quot;jailambi&quot; &quot;evade&quot; – &quot;jailatambi&quot; &quot;evade everywhere&quot;, &quot;injembi&quot; &quot;laugh&quot; – &quot;injecembi&quot; &quot;laugh persistently in the crowd&quot;, &quot;halambi&quot; &quot;change&quot; – &quot;halanjambi&quot; &quot;alternate&quot;, &quot;ibembi&quot; &quot;go forward&quot; – &quot;ibešembi&quot; &quot;go forward step by step&quot;.

==== Direction: ventive, andative and missive ====
In verbs of locomotion in the broadest sense there is a distinction between movement away from the speaker (andative) and towards the speaker (ventive). This is similar to the complement of direction in Chinese (andative &quot;qù&quot; &quot;go&quot; vs ventive &quot;lái&quot; &quot;come&quot;). The andative is expressed by the suffix &quot;-na/-ne/-no&quot; (possibly connected to &quot;genembi&quot; &quot;go&quot;) and the ventive is expressed by &quot;-nji&quot; (possibly connected to &quot;jimbi&quot; &quot;come&quot;). Besides, a missive form is constructed with the suffix &quot;-nggi&quot; (possibly connected to &quot;unggimbi&quot; &quot;send&quot;): &quot;alambi&quot; &quot;report&quot; – &quot;alanambi&quot; &quot;go in order to report&quot;, &quot;alanjimbi&quot; &quot;come with a report&quot;, &quot;alanggimbi&quot; &quot;send with a report&quot;, &quot;fekumbi&quot; &quot;jump&quot; – &quot;fekunembi&quot; &quot;jump over there&quot; – &quot;fekunjembi&quot; &quot;jump over here&quot;, &quot;ebišembi&quot; &quot;bathe&quot; – &quot;ebišenembi&quot; &quot;go bathe&quot;.

== Word formation ==

=== Word formation ===
Manchu has numerous productive derivational suffixes.

==== Nouns ====
&quot;Abstract nouns&quot; are derived from verbs with the suffixes:

* &quot;-n&quot;, e.g. &quot;acan&quot; &quot;meeting&quot; from &quot;aca-&quot; &quot;meet&quot;, 
* &quot;-gan/gen/gon / -han/hen/hon&quot;, e.g. &quot;nirugan&quot; &quot;a picture&quot; from &quot;niru-&quot; &quot;to draw&quot;. 
* -&quot;cun.&quot; e.g. &quot;akacun&quot; &quot;grief&quot; from &quot;aka-&quot; &quot;grieve&quot;.

&quot;Nouns denoting instruments&quot; are derived from verbs with the suffixes:

* &quot;-ku/kū&quot;, e.g. &quot;anjikū &quot;hatchet&quot; from &quot;anji-&quot; &quot;to hack&quot;. When derived from a verb stem that ends in the passive/causative suffix &quot;-bu-&quot;, the meaning is often of an agent noun: &quot;tacibukū &quot;teacher&quot; from &quot;tacibu-&quot; &quot;to teach&quot; from &quot;taci-&quot; &quot;to learn&quot;. 
* &quot;-sun&quot; and &quot;-fun&quot;, e.g. &quot;ijifun &quot;comb&quot; from &quot;iji&quot;- &quot;to comb&quot;, &quot;umiyesun &quot;girdle&quot; from &quot;umiye-&quot; &quot;to gird oneself&quot;
* &quot;-tun&quot;, e.g. &quot;alitun&quot; &quot;cup&quot;, &quot;offering table&quot; from &quot;ali-&quot; &quot;receive, hold up&quot;

&quot;Agent nouns&quot; are derived both from verb and from noun stems with the suffixes &quot;-si&quot;, &quot;-msi&quot;, &quot;-ci&quot;, &quot;-ji&quot;, &quot;-lji&quot;, &quot;-mji&quot;, &quot;-nju&quot;: &quot;kimcisi &quot;investigator&quot; from &quot;kimci-&quot; &quot;to investigate&quot;, &quot;bithesi &quot;scribe&quot; from &quot;bithe&quot; &quot;book&quot;. A more peculiar meaning of an obtained object is expressed by the suffix &quot;-ci&quot; in some words like &quot;ihaci&quot; &quot;cowhide&quot; from &quot;ihan&quot; &quot;bovine&quot;.

Adjectives or nouns denoting the possessor of a &quot;quality&quot; are derived both from verb and from noun stems; when the word is derived from a verb. the meaning is sometimes of an agent noun. The following suffixes are used:

* -&quot;tu/du,&quot; e.g. &quot;bekitu &quot;strong man&quot; from &quot;beki-&quot; &quot;strong&quot;, &quot;songgotu &quot;crybaby&quot; from &quot;songgo-&quot; &quot;cry&quot;, &quot;girutu&quot; &quot;ashamed&quot; from &quot;giru&quot; &quot;to be ashamed&quot;
* -&quot;ta/da/to/do&quot;, e.g. &quot;giohoto &quot;beggar&quot; from &quot;gioho-&quot; &quot;to beg&quot;, &quot;sanggata &quot;having holes&quot; from &quot;sangga&quot; &quot;hole&quot;
* &quot;-ki,&quot; e.g. &quot;acabuki &quot;flatterer&quot; from &quot;acabu-&quot; &quot;to flatter&quot;, &quot;ambaki &quot;arrogant&quot; from &quot;amba&quot; &quot;big&quot;.
The &quot;diminutive&quot; suffixes are &quot;-kan/ken/kon&quot;, &quot;-gan/gen&quot; and &quot;-cen&quot; : e.g. &quot;bira&quot; &quot;river&quot; – &quot;biragan &quot;small river&quot;, &quot;golmin&quot; &quot;long&quot; – &quot;golmikan &quot;somewhat/rather long&quot;.

The augmentative suffix is &quot;-linggū&quot;/&quot;linggu&quot;: e.g. &quot;amban&quot; &quot;big&quot; – &quot;ambalinggū &quot;huge&quot;, &quot;ehe&quot; &quot;bad&quot; – &quot;ehelinggu &quot;very bad&quot;.

==== Verbs ====
A number of suffixes derive verbs, mostly &quot;from nouns&quot;.

* The suffix &quot;-la/-le/-lo&quot; forms a verb, in which the base noun is the object of the activity: &quot;songko&quot; &quot;a trace&quot; – &quot;songkolo-&quot; &quot;to follow a trace&quot;; &quot;aba&quot; &quot;a hunt&quot; – &quot;abala-&quot; &quot;to hunt&quot;.
* The suffix &quot;-ra/-re/-ro&quot; is used in a similar way: &quot;gisun&quot; &quot;word&quot; – &quot;gisure-&quot; &quot;to speak&quot;, &quot;monggo&quot; &quot;Mongolia&quot; – &quot;monggoro-&quot; &quot;to speak Mongolian&quot;, &quot;to behave like a Mongol&quot;.
* The suffix &quot;-na/-ne/-no&quot; forms in part a type of inchoative verb or expresses an inherent development or capability of an object or a person: &quot;fiyeren&quot; &quot;fissure&quot; – &quot;fierene-&quot; &quot;to split&quot;, &quot;ilha&quot; &quot;flower&quot; – &quot;ilhana-&quot; &quot;to bloom&quot;; .
* The suffix &quot;-ša/-še/-šo&quot; forms verbs that express the effort to achieve a certain result: &quot;sain&quot; &quot;good&quot; – &quot;saiša-&quot; &quot;praise&quot;, &quot;oncohon&quot; &quot;arrogant&quot; – &quot;oncohošo-&quot; &quot;to boast&quot;, &quot;buleku&quot; &quot;mirror&quot; – &quot;bulekuše-&quot; &quot;to look at oneself in a mirror&quot;.
* The suffix &quot;-da/-de/-do&quot; forms verbs with intensive or durative meaning or the gradual development of an action: &quot;jili&quot; &quot;anger&quot; – &quot;jilida-&quot; &quot;get angry&quot;, &quot;ceku&quot; &quot;a swing&quot; – &quot;cekude-&quot; &quot;to swing&quot;, &quot;eruwen&quot; &quot;a drill&quot; – &quot;eruwede-&quot; &quot;to drill&quot;, &quot;goho&quot; &quot;elegant&quot; – &quot;gohodo-&quot; &quot;to dress up&quot;.
* The suffix &quot;-ja/-je/-jo&quot; also has intensive or durative meaning: &quot;gūninja-&quot; &quot;to think over carefully&quot; from &quot;gūnin&quot; “thought”.

Other suffixes of this type are &quot;-ta/te/to&quot; (&quot;gosita-&quot; &quot;to love&quot; from &quot;gosin&quot; &quot;love&quot;) &quot;-tu&quot;, &quot;-li&quot;, and &quot;-mi&quot;.

Verbs are derived &quot;from other verbs&quot;, sometimes with intensive and causative meaning, with the suffixes &quot;-niye&quot; and &quot;-kiya/kiye&quot;, &quot;-giya/giye&quot;, &quot;-hiya/hiye&quot;: e.g. &quot;ebeniye-&quot; &quot;to wet thoroughly&quot; from &quot;ebe-&quot; &quot;to wet&quot;, &quot;jalukiya- &quot;to fill&quot; from &quot;jalu-&quot; &quot;to be full, filled&quot;, &quot;tuwakiya- &quot;to guard&quot; from &quot;tuwa-&quot; &quot;to watch&quot;.

On the formation of verbs with a certain &quot;aspect,&quot; &quot;voice&quot; or &quot;direction&quot;, see the grammar section.

== Numerals ==
The numerals are as follows:

21 &quot;orin emu&quot; etc.

101 &quot;tanggū emu&quot; etc.

1000 &quot;minggan&quot; (from Mongolian &quot;‹mingɣ-a(n)›&quot;)

10000 &quot;tumen&quot; (from Mongolian &quot;‹tüme(n)›&quot;)

100000 &quot;juwan tumen&quot;

1000000 &quot;tanggū tumen&quot;

* irregular; cf. Mongolian &quot;‹tabu(n)›&quot; &quot;five&quot;

⁑ cf. Mongolian &quot;‹qori(n)›&quot;

⁂ cf. Mongolian &quot;‹ɣuči(n)›&quot;

For higher numbers, loanwords from Sanskrit are also used, above all in the translation of Buddhist texts.

Most ordinal numerals are formed with the suffix &quot;-ci,&quot; before which stem-final &quot;-n&quot; is elided (except in &quot;juwanci&quot; &quot;tenth&quot; and &quot;tumenci&quot; &quot;tenthousandth&quot;). Distributive numerals are formed with the suffix &quot;-ta/-te/-to;&quot; again, stem-final &quot;-n&quot; is elided: &quot;emte&quot; &quot;one each&quot;, &quot;juwete&quot; &quot;two each&quot;, &quot;ilata&quot; &quot;three each&quot; etc. Fractions are formed according to the following pattern:
The word &quot;ubu&quot; &quot;part&quot; can be in the genitive case as well:

This is the same construction as in Chinese:

Multiplicatives are formed with the suffix &quot;-rsu&quot; or with a following &quot;ubu&quot; &quot;part&quot;:

&quot;emursu&quot;, &quot;emu ubu&quot; &quot;single&quot;; &quot;jursu&quot;, &quot;juwe ubu&quot; &quot;double&quot;; &quot;ilarsu&quot;, &quot;ilan ubu&quot; &quot;threefold&quot;; etc.

Collectives are formed with the suffix &quot;-nofi&quot;: &quot;juwenofi&quot; &quot;two together&quot;, &quot;ilanofi&quot; &quot;three together&quot;, &quot;duinofi&quot; &quot;four together&quot; etc.

Iterative numerals are formed mostly with the suffix &quot;-nggeri&quot; or &quot;-geri&quot;:

&quot;emgeri&quot; &quot;once&quot;, &quot;juwenggeri&quot; &quot;twice&quot;, ilanggeri &quot;thrice&quot;, &quot;duinggeri&quot; &quot;fourth&quot; etc.

For dates, Manchu uses a system similar to Chinese, combining a cycle of ten (&quot;juwan cikten&quot; &quot;the ten colours&quot; or &quot;stems&quot;) and cycle of twelve (&quot;juwan juwe gargan&quot; &quot;the twelve animals&quot; or &quot;branches&quot;).

=== Classifiers ===
In Manchu there is, as in Chinese, a significant number of classifiers (also called measure words), which stand between the numeral and the noun:

The classifier &quot;fesin&quot; &quot;handle&quot; is used for objects with a handle or a hilt such as knives, swords, sabres, spades, fans etc.(similarly to the Chinese classifier &quot;bǎ&quot; ).

Further examples of classifiers are &quot;afaha&quot; &quot;sheet&quot; for paper, lists etc. (cf. Chinese &quot;zhāng&quot; ), &quot;debtelin&quot; &quot;volume&quot; for books (cf. Chinese &quot;běn&quot; ), &quot;angga&quot; &quot;mouth&quot; for animals, objects with openings (pots, bags etc.), ports, mountain passes etc., &quot;baksan&quot; &quot;bundle&quot; for “Bundles” for sheaves of grain, bundles of paper, bunches of keys, caravans, etc., &quot;dalgan&quot; &quot;surface&quot; for flat objects such as flags, mirrors, fans and meat cutlets etc.

=== Postpositions ===
Some postpositions, such as &quot;baru&quot; &quot;to&quot;, are not derived from other words, while others are originally declined forms of other parts of speech, such as nouns in a certain case (e.g. &quot;dade &quot;in addition to&quot;, lit. &quot;in the base of&quot;) and converbs (&quot;dahame &quot;according to&quot;, lit. &quot;following&quot;). Some, like &quot;dele&quot; &quot;on top of&quot;, &quot;top&quot; are simply identical to nouns. Each postposition governs a certain noun case, with most, like &quot;baru&quot; &quot;to&quot;, &quot;dergi&quot; &quot;above&quot; and &quot;sasa&quot; &quot;with&quot; governing the genitive, and two smaller groups governing the dative (e.g. &quot;isitala&quot; &quot;until&quot;) and the ablative (e.g. &quot;amala&quot; &quot;behind&quot;). &quot;Jaka&quot; &#x27;together with&quot; takes the nominative. Postpositions may express place (&quot;dergi&quot; &quot;above&quot;), time (&quot;amari&quot; &quot;after&quot;), comitative meaning (&quot;emgi&quot; &quot;with&quot;), causality (&quot;jalinde&quot; &quot;for the sake of&quot;), similarity (&quot;gele&quot; &quot;like&quot;) or restriction (only &quot;teile&quot; &quot;only&quot;, governing the genitive case, e.g. &quot;damu ilan sarhan’i teile ilan boo de tehe&quot; &quot;only three women lived in three houses&quot;, lit. &quot;only of three women only ...&quot;. Postpositions may govern participles, which then have the meaning of verbal nouns, and the postpositions themselves acquire a function similar to that of conjunctions (&quot;sain ehe be tuwaha manggi&quot; &quot;after having seen&quot;, from &quot;manggi&quot; &quot;with, towards&quot;).

=== Conjunctions ===
Some conjunctions coincide with adverbs (e.g. &quot;damu&quot; &quot;only&quot;, &quot;but&quot;, &quot;geli&quot; &quot;also&quot;, &quot;and&quot;, &quot;jai&quot; &quot;again&quot;, &quot;and&#x27;, &quot;eici&quot; &quot;perhaps&quot;, &quot;or&quot;). Others are originally case forms or converbs (&quot;bade &quot;when&quot;, lit. &quot;in the place&quot;, &quot;bici &quot;if&quot;, lit. &quot;if it is (so)&quot;, &quot;bihede&quot; &quot;when&quot;, lit. &quot;in having become (so)&quot;).

== Lexis ==
Apart from the inherited Tungusic vocabulary, Manchu contains loanwords above all from Mongolian and from Chinese. There are also many loanwords of Turkic origin; these probably entered it via Mongolian as well. It has been estimated that twenty to thirty percent of the Manchu vocabulary consists of Mongolian loanwords.

==Writing system==

The Manchu language uses the Manchu script, which was derived from the traditional Mongol script, which in turn was based on the vertically written pre-Islamic Uyghur script. Manchu is now usually romanized according to the transliteration system employed by Jerry Norman in his &quot;Comprehensive Manchu-English Dictionary&quot; (2013). The Jurchen language, which is ancestral to Manchu, used the Jurchen script, which is derived from the Khitan script, which in turn was derived from Chinese characters. There is no relation between the Jurchen script and the Manchu script.

Chinese characters, employed as phonograms, can also be used to transliterate Manchu. All the Manchu vowels and the syllables commencing with a consonant are represented by single Chinese characters as are also the syllables terminating in &quot;i, n, ng&quot; and &quot;o&quot;; but those ending in &quot;r, k, s, t, p, I, m&quot; are expressed by the union of the sounds of two characters, there being no Mandarin syllables terminating with these consonants. Thus the Manchu syllable &quot;am&quot; is expressed by the Chinese characters &quot;a mù&quot;, and the word &quot;Manchu&quot; is, in the Kangxi Dictionary, written as &quot;mă ā ān zhū wū&quot;.

===Teaching===
Mongols learned their script as a syllabary, dividing the syllables into twelve different classes, based on the final phonemes of the syllables, all of which ended in vowels. The Manchus followed the same syllabic method when learning Manchu script, also with syllables divided into twelve different classes based on the final phonemes of the syllables. Today, the opinion on whether it is alphabet or syllabic in nature is still split between different experts. In China, it is considered syllabic and Manchu is still taught in this manner. The alphabetic approach is used mainly by foreigners who want to learn the language. Studying Manchu script as a syllabary takes a longer time.

Despite the alphabetic nature of its script, Manchu was not taught phoneme per letter like western languages are; Manchu children were taught to memorize all the syllables in the Manchu language separately as they learned to write, like Chinese characters. To paraphrase Meadows 1849,Manchus when learning, instead of saying l, a—la; l, o—lo; &amp;c., were taught at once to say la, lo, &amp;c. Many more syllables than are contained in their syllabary might have been formed with their letters, but they were not accustomed to arrange them otherwise. They made, for instance, no such use of the consonants l, m, n, and r, as westerners do; hence if the Manchu letters s, m, a, r, t, are joined in that order a Manchu would not able to pronounce them as English speaking people pronounce the word &#x27;smart&#x27;.However this was in 1849, and more research should be done on the current teaching methods used in the PRC.

<text>A liquid air cycle engine (LACE) is a type of spacecraft propulsion engine that attempts to increase its efficiency by gathering part of its oxidizer from the atmosphere. A liquid air cycle engine uses liquid hydrogen (LH2) fuel to liquefy the air.

In a liquid oxygen/liquid hydrogen rocket, the liquid oxygen (LOX) needed for combustion is the majority of the weight of the spacecraft on lift-off, so if some of this can be collected from the air on the way, it might dramatically lower the take-off weight of the spacecraft.

LACE was studied to some extent in the USA during the late 1950s and early 1960s, and by late 1960 Marquardt had a testbed system running. However, as NASA moved to ballistic capsules during Project Mercury, funding for research into winged vehicles slowly disappeared, and LACE work along with it.

LACE was also the basis of the engines on the British Aerospace HOTOL design of the 1980s, but this did not progress beyond studies.

==Principle of operation==

Conceptually, LACE works by compressing and then quickly liquefying the air. Compression is achieved through the ram-air effect in an intake similar to that found on a high-speed aircraft like Concorde, where intake ramps create shock waves that compress the air. The LACE design then blows the compressed air over a heat exchanger, in which the liquid hydrogen fuel is flowing. This rapidly cools the air, and the various constituents quickly liquefy. By careful mechanical arrangement the liquid oxygen can be removed from the other parts of the air, notably water, nitrogen and carbon dioxide, at which point the liquid oxygen can be fed into the engine as usual. It will be seen that heat-exchanger limitations always cause this system to run with a hydrogen/air ratio much richer than stoichiometric with a consequent penalty in performance and thus some hydrogen is dumped overboard.

==Advantages and disadvantages==

The use of a winged launch vehicle allows using lift rather than thrust to overcome gravity, which greatly reduces gravity losses. On the other hand, the reduced gravity losses come at the price of much higher aerodynamic drag and aerodynamic heating due to the need to stay much deeper within the atmosphere than a pure rocket would during the boost phase.

In order to appreciably reduce the mass of the oxygen carried at launch, a LACE vehicle needs to spend more time in the lower atmosphere to collect enough oxygen to supply the engines during the remainder of the launch. This leads to greatly increased vehicle heating and drag losses, which therefore increases fuel consumption to offset the drag losses and the additional mass of the thermal protection system. This increased fuel consumption offsets somewhat the savings in oxidizer mass; these losses are in turn offset by the higher specific impulse, &quot;I&quot;, of the air-breathing engine. Thus, the engineering trade-offs involved are quite complex, and highly sensitive to the design assumptions made.

Other issues are introduced by the relative material and logistical properties of LOx versus LH. LOx is quite cheap; LH is nearly two orders of magnitude more expensive. LOx is dense (1.141 kg/L), whereas LH has a very low density (0.0678 kg/L) and is therefore very bulky. (The extreme bulkiness of the LH2 tankage tends to increase vehicle drag by increasing the vehicle&#x27;s frontal area.) Finally, LOx tanks are relatively lightweight and fairly cheap, while the deep cryogenic nature and extreme physical properties of LH mandate that LH tanks and plumbing must be large and use heavy, expensive, exotic materials and insulation. Hence, much as the costs of using LH rather than a hydrocarbon fuel may well outweigh the &quot;I&quot; benefit of using LH in a single-stage-to-orbit rocket, the costs of using more LH as a propellant and air-liquefaction coolant in LACE may well outweigh the benefits gained by not needing to carry as much LOx on board.

Most significantly, the LACE system is far heavier than a pure rocket engine having the same thrust (air-breathing engines of almost all types have relatively poor thrust-to-weight ratios compared to rockets), and the performance of launch vehicles of all types is particularly affected by increases in vehicle dry mass (such as engines) that must be carried all the way to orbit, as opposed to oxidizer mass that would be burnt off over the course of the flight. Moreover, the lower thrust-to-weight ratio of an air-breathing engine as compared to a rocket significantly decreases the launch vehicle&#x27;s maximum possible acceleration, and increases gravity losses since more time must be spent to accelerate to orbital velocity. Also, the higher inlet and airframe drag losses of a lifting, air-breathing vehicle launch trajectory as compared to a pure rocket on a ballistic launch trajectory introduces an additional penalty term formula_1 into the rocket equation known as the &quot;air-breather&#x27;s burden&quot;. This term implies that unless the lift-to-drag ratio (&quot;L&quot;/&quot;D&quot;) and the acceleration of the vehicle as compared to gravity (&quot;a&quot;/&quot;g&quot;) are both implausibly large for a hypersonic air-breathing vehicle, the advantages of the higher &quot;I&quot; of the air-breathing engine and the savings in LOx mass are largely lost.

Thus, the advantages, or disadvantages, of the LACE design continue to be a matter of some debate.

==History==

LACE was studied to some extent in the United States of America during the late 1950s and early 1960s, where it was seen as a &quot;natural&quot; fit for a winged spacecraft project known as the Aerospaceplane. At the time the concept was known as LACES, for &quot;Liquid Air Collection Engine System&quot;. The liquified air and some of the hydrogen is then pumped directly into the engine for burning.

When it was demonstrated that it was relatively easy to separate the oxygen from the other components of air, mostly nitrogen and carbon dioxide, a new concept emerged as ACES for &quot;Air Collection and Enrichment System&quot;. This leaves the problem of what to do with the leftover gasses. ACES injected the nitrogen into a ramjet engine, using it as additional working fluid while the engine was running on air and the liquid oxygen was being stored. As the aircraft climbed and the atmosphere thinned, the lack of air was offset by increasing the flow of oxygen from the tanks. This makes ACES an ejector ramjet (or ramrocket) as opposed to the pure rocket LACE design.

Both Marquardt Corporation and General Dynamics were involved in the LACES research. However, as NASA moved to ballistic capsules during Project Mercury, funding for research into winged vehicles slowly disappeared, and ACES along with it.

<text>A heat exchanger is a system used to transfer heat between a source and a working fluid. Heat exchangers are used in both cooling and heating processes. The fluids may be separated by a solid wall to prevent mixing or they may be in direct contact. They are widely used in space heating, refrigeration, air conditioning, power stations, chemical plants, petrochemical plants, petroleum refineries, natural-gas processing, and sewage treatment. The classic example of a heat exchanger is found in an internal combustion engine in which a circulating fluid known as engine coolant flows through radiator coils and air flows past the coils, which cools the coolant and heats the incoming air. Another example is the heat sink, which is a passive heat exchanger that transfers the heat generated by an electronic or a mechanical device to a fluid medium, often air or a liquid coolant.

==Flow arrangement==
There are three primary classifications of heat exchangers according to their flow arrangement. In &quot;parallel-flow&quot; heat exchangers, the two fluids enter the exchanger at the same end, and travel in parallel to one another to the other side. In &quot;counter-flow&quot; heat exchangers the fluids enter the exchanger from opposite ends. The counter current design is the most efficient, in that it can transfer the most heat from the heat (transfer) medium per unit mass due to the fact that the average temperature difference along any unit length is &quot;higher&quot;. See countercurrent exchange. In a &quot;cross-flow&quot; heat exchanger, the fluids travel roughly perpendicular to one another through the exchanger.
For efficiency, heat exchangers are designed to maximize the surface area of the wall between the two fluids, while minimizing resistance to fluid flow through the exchanger. The exchanger&#x27;s performance can also be affected by the addition of fins or corrugations in one or both directions, which increase surface area and may channel fluid flow or induce turbulence.

The driving temperature across the heat transfer surface varies with position, but an appropriate mean temperature can be defined. In most simple systems this is the &quot;log mean temperature difference&quot; (LMTD). Sometimes direct knowledge of the LMTD is not available and the NTU method is used.

==Types==
By maximum operating temperature, heat exchangers can be divided into low-temperature and high-temperature ones. The former work up to 500–650°C depending on the industry and generally don&#x27;t require special design and material considerations. The latter work up to 1000 or even 1400°C.

Double pipe heat exchangers are the simplest exchangers used in industries. On one hand, these heat exchangers are cheap for both design and maintenance, making them a good choice for small industries. On the other hand, their low efficiency coupled with the high space occupied in large scales, has led modern industries to use more efficient heat exchangers like shell and tube or plate. However, since double pipe heat exchangers are simple, they are used to teach heat exchanger design basics to students as the fundamental rules for all heat exchangers are the same.

1. Double-pipe heat exchanger

When one fluid flows through the smaller pipe, the other flows through the annular gap between the two pipes. These flows may be parallel or counter-flows in a double pipe heat exchanger.

(a) Parallel flow, where both hot and cold liquids enter the heat exchanger from the same side, flow in the same direction and exit at the same end. This configuration is preferable when the two fluids are intended to reach exactly the same temperature, as it reduces thermal stress and produces a more uniform rate of heat transfer.
(b) Counter-flow, where hot and cold fluids enter opposite sides of the heat exchanger, flow in opposite directions, and exit at opposite ends. This configuration is preferable when the objective is to maximize heat transfer between the fluids, as it creates a larger temperature differential when used under otherwise similar conditions.
The figure above illustrates the parallel and counter-flow flow directions of the fluid exchanger.
2. Shell-and-tube heat exchanger

In a shell-and-tube heat exchanger, two fluids at different temperatures flow through the heat exchanger. One of the fluids flows through the tube side and the other fluid flows outside the tubes, but inside the shell (shell side).

Baffles are used to support the tubes, direct the fluid flow to the tubes in an approximately natural manner, and maximize the turbulence of the shell fluid. There are many various kinds of baffles, and the choice of baffle form, spacing, and geometry depends on the allowable flow rate of the drop in shell-side force, the need for tube support, and the flow-induced vibrations. There are several variations of shell-and-tube exchangers available; the differences lie in the arrangement of flow configurations and details of construction.

In application to cool air with shell-and-tube technology (such as intercooler / charge air cooler for combustion engines), fins can be added on the tubes to increase heat transfer area on air side and create a tubes &amp; fins configuration. 
3. Plate Heat Exchanger
A plate heat exchanger contains an amount of thin shaped heat transfer plates bundled together. The gasket arrangement of each pair of plates provides two separate channel system. Each pair of plates form a channel where the fluid can flow through. The pairs are attached by welding and bolting methods. The following shows the components in the heat exchanger. 
In single channels the configuration of the gaskets enables flow through. Thus, this allows the main and secondary media in counter-current flow. A gasket plate heat exchanger has a heat region from corrugated plates. The gasket function as seal between plates and they are located between frame and pressure plates. Fluid flows in a counter current direction throughout the heat exchanger. An efficient thermal performance is produced. Plates are produced in different depths, sizes and corrugated shapes. There are different types of plates available including plate and frame, plate and shell and spiral plate heat exchangers. The distribution area guarantees the flow of fluid to the whole heat transfer surface. This helps to prevent stagnant area that can cause accumulation of unwanted material on solid surfaces. High flow turbulence between plates results in a greater transfer of heat and a decrease in pressure. 
4. Condensers and Boilers 
Heat exchangers using a two-phase heat transfer system are condensers, boilers and evaporators. Condensers are instruments that take and cool hot gas or vapor to the point of condensation and transform the gas into a liquid form. The point at which liquid transforms to gas is called vaporization and vice versa is called condensation. Surface condenser is the most common type of condenser where it includes a water supply device. Figure 5 below displays a two-pass surface condenser. 
The pressure of steam at the turbine outlet is low where the steam density is very low where the flow rate is very high. To prevent a decrease in pressure in the movement of steam from the turbine to condenser, the condenser unit is placed underneath and connected to the turbine. Inside the tubes the cooling water runs in a parallel way, while steam moves in a vertical downward position from the wide opening at the top and travel through the tube. 
Furthermore, boilers are categorized as initial application of heat exchangers. The word steam generator was regularly used to describe a boiler unit where a hot liquid stream is the source of heat rather than the combustion products. Depending on the dimensions and configurations the boilers are manufactured. Several boilers are only able to produce hot fluid while on the other hand the others are manufactured for steam production.

===Shell and tube===


Shell and tube heat exchangers consist of a series of tubes which contain fluid that must be either heated or cooled. A second fluid runs over the tubes that are being heated or cooled so that it can either provide the heat or absorb the heat required. A set of tubes is called the tube bundle and can be made up of several types of tubes: plain, longitudinally finned, etc. Shell and tube heat exchangers are typically used for high-pressure applications (with pressures greater than 30 bar and temperatures greater than 260 °C). This is because the shell and tube heat exchangers are robust due to their shape.&lt;br&gt;Several thermal design features must be considered when designing the tubes in the shell and tube heat exchangers:
There can be many variations on the shell and tube design. Typically, the ends of each tube are connected to plenums (sometimes called water boxes) through holes in tubesheets. The tubes may be straight or bent in the shape of a U, called U-tubes.
* Tube diameter: Using a small tube diameter makes the heat exchanger both economical and compact. However, it is more likely for the heat exchanger to foul up faster and the small size makes mechanical cleaning of the fouling difficult. To prevail over the fouling and cleaning problems, larger tube diameters can be used. Thus to determine the tube diameter, the available space, cost and fouling nature of the fluids must be considered.
* Tube thickness: The thickness of the wall of the tubes is usually determined to ensure:
** There is enough room for corrosion
** That flow-induced vibration has resistance
** Axial strength
** Availability of spare parts
** Hoop strength (to withstand internal tube pressure)
** Buckling strength (to withstand overpressure in the shell)
* Tube length: heat exchangers are usually cheaper when they have a smaller shell diameter and a long tube length. Thus, typically there is an aim to make the heat exchanger as long as physically possible whilst not exceeding production capabilities. However, there are many limitations for this, including space available at the installation site and the need to ensure tubes are available in lengths that are twice the required length (so they can be withdrawn and replaced). Also, long, thin tubes are difficult to take out and replace.
* Tube pitch: when designing the tubes, it is practical to ensure that the tube pitch (i.e., the centre-centre distance of adjoining tubes) is not less than 1.25 times the tubes&#x27; outside diameter. A larger tube pitch leads to a larger overall shell diameter, which leads to a more expensive heat exchanger.
* Tube corrugation: this type of tubes, mainly used for the inner tubes, increases the turbulence of the fluids and the effect is very important in the heat transfer giving a better performance.
* Tube Layout: refers to how tubes are positioned within the shell. There are four main types of tube layout, which are, triangular (30°), rotated triangular (60°), square (90°) and rotated square (45°). The triangular patterns are employed to give greater heat transfer as they force the fluid to flow in a more turbulent fashion around the piping. Square patterns are employed where high fouling is experienced and cleaning is more regular.
* Baffle Design: baffles are used in shell and tube heat exchangers to direct fluid across the tube bundle. They run perpendicularly to the shell and hold the bundle, preventing the tubes from sagging over a long length. They can also prevent the tubes from vibrating. The most common type of baffle is the segmental baffle. The semicircular segmental baffles are oriented at 180 degrees to the adjacent baffles forcing the fluid to flow upward and downwards between the tube bundle. Baffle spacing is of large thermodynamic concern when designing shell and tube heat exchangers. Baffles must be spaced with consideration for the conversion of pressure drop and heat transfer. For thermo economic optimization it is suggested that the baffles be spaced no closer than 20% of the shell&#x27;s inner diameter. Having baffles spaced too closely causes a greater pressure drop because of flow redirection. Consequently, having the baffles spaced too far apart means that there may be cooler spots in the corners between baffles. It is also important to ensure the baffles are spaced close enough that the tubes do not sag. The other main type of baffle is the disc and doughnut baffle, which consists of two concentric baffles. An outer, wider baffle looks like a doughnut, whilst the inner baffle is shaped like a disk. This type of baffle forces the fluid to pass around each side of the disk then through the doughnut baffle generating a different type of fluid flow.
*Tubes &amp; fins Design: in application to cool air with shell-and-tube technology (such as intercooler / charge air cooler for combustion engines), the difference in heat transfer between air and cold fluid can be such that there is a need to increase heat transfer area on air side. For this function fins can be added on the tubes to increase heat transfer area on air side and create a tubes &amp; fins configuration.

Fixed tube liquid-cooled heat exchangers especially suitable for marine and harsh applications can be assembled with brass shells, copper tubes, brass baffles, and forged brass integral end hubs. &quot;(See: Copper in heat exchangers).&quot;

===Plate===


Another type of heat exchanger is the plate heat exchanger. These exchangers are composed of many thin, slightly separated plates that have very large surface areas and small fluid flow passages for heat transfer. Advances in gasket and brazing technology have made the plate-type heat exchanger increasingly practical. In HVAC applications, large heat exchangers of this type are called &quot;plate-and-frame&quot;; when used in open loops, these heat exchangers are normally of the gasket type to allow periodic disassembly, cleaning, and inspection. There are many types of permanently bonded plate heat exchangers, such as dip-brazed, vacuum-brazed, and welded plate varieties, and they are often specified for closed-loop applications such as refrigeration. Plate heat exchangers also differ in the types of plates that are used, and in the configurations of those plates. Some plates may be stamped with &quot;chevron&quot;, dimpled, or other patterns, where others may have machined fins and/or grooves.

When compared to shell and tube exchangers, the stacked-plate arrangement typically has lower volume and cost. Another difference between the two is that plate exchangers typically serve low to medium pressure fluids, compared to medium and high pressures of shell and tube. A third and important difference is that plate exchangers employ more countercurrent flow rather than cross current flow, which allows lower approach temperature differences, high temperature changes, and increased efficiencies.

===Plate and shell===
A third type of heat exchanger is a plate and shell heat exchanger, which combines plate heat exchanger with shell and tube heat exchanger technologies. The heart of the heat exchanger contains a fully welded circular plate pack made by pressing and cutting round plates and welding them together. Nozzles carry flow in and out of the platepack (the &#x27;Plate side&#x27; flowpath). The fully welded platepack is assembled into an outer shell that creates a second flowpath (the &#x27;Shell side&#x27;). Plate and shell technology offers high heat transfer, high pressure, high operating temperature, compact size, low fouling and close approach temperature. In particular, it does completely without gaskets, which provides security against leakage at high pressures and temperatures.

===Adiabatic wheel===
A fourth type of heat exchanger uses an intermediate fluid or solid store to hold heat, which is then moved to the other side of the heat exchanger to be released. Two examples of this are adiabatic wheels, which consist of a large wheel with fine threads rotating through the hot and cold fluids, and fluid heat exchangers.

===Plate fin===

This type of heat exchanger uses &quot;sandwiched&quot; passages containing fins to increase the effectiveness of the unit. The designs include crossflow and counterflow coupled with various fin configurations such as straight fins, offset fins and wavy fins.

Plate and fin heat exchangers are usually made of aluminum alloys, which provide high heat transfer efficiency. The material enables the system to operate at a lower temperature difference and reduce the weight of the equipment. Plate and fin heat exchangers are mostly used for low temperature services such as natural gas, helium and oxygen liquefaction plants, air separation plants and transport industries such as motor and aircraft engines.

Advantages of plate and fin heat exchangers:
* High heat transfer efficiency especially in gas treatment
* Larger heat transfer area
* Approximately 5 times lighter in weight than that of shell and tube heat exchanger. 
* Able to withstand high pressure

Disadvantages of plate and fin heat exchangers:
* Might cause clogging as the pathways are very narrow
* Difficult to clean the pathways
* Aluminium alloys are susceptible to Mercury Liquid Embrittlement Failure

=== Finned tube ===
The usage of fins in a tube-based heat exchanger is common when one of the working fluids is a low-pressure gas, and is typical for heat exchangers that operate using ambient air, such as automotive radiators and HVAC air condensers. Fins dramatically increase the surface area with which heat can be exchanged, which improves the efficiency of conducting heat to a fluid with very low thermal conductivity, such as air. The fins are typically made from aluminium or copper since they must conduct heat from the tube along the length of the fins, which are usually very thin.

The main construction types of finned tube exchangers are:

* A stack of evenly-spaced metal plates act as the fins and the tubes are pressed through pre-cut holes in the fins, good thermal contact usually being achieved by deformation of the fins around the tube. This is typical construction for HVAC air coils and large refrigeration condensers.
* Fins are spiral-wound onto individual tubes as a continuous strip, the tubes can then be assembled in banks, bent in a serpentine pattern, or wound into large spirals.
* Zig-zag metal strips are sandwiched between flat rectangular tubes, often being soldered or brazed together for good thermal and mechanical strength. This is common in low-pressure heat exchangers such as water-cooling radiators. Regular flat tubes will expand and deform if exposed to high pressures but flat microchannel tubes allow this construction to be used for high pressures.

Stacked-fin or spiral-wound construction can be used for the tubes inside shell-and-tube heat exchangers when high efficiency thermal transfer to a gas is required.

In electronics cooling, heat sinks, particularly those using heat pipes, can have a stacked-fin construction.

===Pillow plate===

A pillow plate heat exchanger is commonly used in the dairy industry for cooling milk in large direct-expansion stainless steel bulk tanks. Nearly the entire surface area of a tank can be integrated with this heat exchanger, without gaps that would occur between pipes welded to the exterior of the tank. Pillow plates can also be constructed as flat plates that are stacked inside a tank. The relatively flat surface of the plates allows easy cleaning, especially in sterile applications.

The pillow plate can be constructed using either a thin sheet of metal welded to the thicker surface of a tank or vessel, or two thin sheets welded together. The surface of the plate is welded with a regular pattern of dots or a serpentine pattern of weld lines. After welding the enclosed space is pressurised with sufficient force to cause the thin metal to bulge out around the welds, providing a space for heat exchanger liquids to flow, and creating a characteristic appearance of a swelled pillow formed out of metal.

===Waste heat recovery units===

A waste heat recovery unit (WHRU) is a heat exchanger that recovers heat from a hot gas stream while transferring it to a working medium, typically water or oils. The hot gas stream can be the exhaust gas from a gas turbine or a diesel engine or a waste gas from industry or refinery.

Large systems with high volume and temperature gas streams, typical in industry, can benefit from steam Rankine cycle (SRC) in a waste heat recovery unit, but these cycles are too expensive for small systems. The recovery of heat from low temperature systems requires different working fluids than steam.

An organic Rankine cycle (ORC) waste heat recovery unit can be more efficient at low temperature range using refrigerants that boil at lower temperatures than water. Typical organic refrigerants are ammonia, pentafluoropropane (R-245fa and R-245ca), and toluene.

The refrigerant is boiled by the heat source in the evaporator to produce super-heated vapor. This fluid is expanded in the turbine to convert thermal energy to kinetic energy, that is converted to electricity in the electrical generator. This energy transfer process decreases the temperature of the refrigerant that, in turn, condenses. The cycle is closed and completed using a pump to send the fluid back to the evaporator.

===Dynamic scraped surface===
Another type of heat exchanger is called &quot;(dynamic) scraped surface heat exchanger&quot;. This is mainly used for heating or cooling with high-viscosity products, crystallization processes, evaporation and high-fouling applications. Long running times are achieved due to the continuous scraping of the surface, thus avoiding fouling and achieving a sustainable heat transfer rate during the process.

===Phase-change===

In addition to heating up or cooling down fluids in just a single phase, heat exchangers can be used either to heat a liquid to evaporate (or boil) it or used as condensers to cool a vapor and condense it to a liquid. In chemical plants and refineries, reboilers used to heat incoming feed for distillation towers are often heat exchangers.

Distillation set-ups typically use condensers to condense distillate vapors back into liquid.

Power plants that use steam-driven turbines commonly use heat exchangers to boil water into steam. Heat exchangers or similar units for producing steam from water are often called boilers or steam generators.

In the nuclear power plants called pressurized water reactors, special large heat exchangers pass heat from the primary (reactor plant) system to the secondary (steam plant) system, producing steam from water in the process. These are called steam generators. All fossil-fueled and nuclear power plants using steam-driven turbines have surface condensers to convert the exhaust steam from the turbines into condensate (water) for re-use.

To conserve energy and cooling capacity in chemical and other plants, regenerative heat exchangers can transfer heat from a stream that must be cooled to another stream that must be heated, such as distillate cooling and reboiler feed pre-heating.

This term can also refer to heat exchangers that contain a material within their structure that has a change of phase. This is usually a solid to liquid phase due to the small volume difference between these states. This change of phase effectively acts as a buffer because it occurs at a constant temperature but still allows for the heat exchanger to accept additional heat. One example where this has been investigated is for use in high power aircraft electronics.

Heat exchangers functioning in multiphase flow regimes may be subject to the Ledinegg instability.

===Direct contact===
Direct contact heat exchangers involve heat transfer between hot and cold streams of two phases in the absence of a separating wall. Thus such heat exchangers can be classified as:
* Gas – liquid
* Immiscible liquid – liquid
* Solid-liquid or solid – gas

Most direct contact heat exchangers fall under the Gas – Liquid category, where heat is transferred between a gas and liquid in the form of drops, films or sprays.

Such types of heat exchangers are used predominantly in air conditioning, humidification, industrial hot water heating, water cooling and condensing plants.

=== Microchannel ===
Microchannel heat exchangers are multi-pass parallel flow heat exchangers consisting of three main elements: manifolds (inlet and outlet), multi-port tubes with the hydraulic diameters smaller than 1mm, and fins. All the elements usually brazed together using controllable atmosphere brazing process. Microchannel heat exchangers are characterized by high heat transfer ratio, low refrigerant charges, compact size, and lower airside pressure drops compared to finned tube heat exchangers. Microchannel heat exchangers are widely used in automotive industry as the car radiators, and as condenser, evaporator, and cooling/heating coils in HVAC industry.
Micro heat exchangers, Micro-scale heat exchangers, or microstructured heat exchangers are heat exchangers in which (at least one) fluid flows in lateral confinements with typical dimensions below 1 mm. The most typical such confinement are microchannels, which are channels with a hydraulic diameter below 1 mm. Microchannel heat exchangers can be made from metal or ceramics. Microchannel heat exchangers can be used for many applications including:
* high-performance aircraft gas turbine engines
* heat pumps
* Microprocessor and microchip cooling
* air conditioning

==HVAC and refrigeration air coils==
One of the widest uses of heat exchangers is for refrigeration and air conditioning. This class of heat exchangers is commonly called &quot;air coils&quot;, or just &quot;coils&quot; due to their often-serpentine internal tubing, or condensers in the case of refrigeration, and are typically of the finned tube type. Liquid-to-air, or air-to-liquid HVAC coils are typically of modified crossflow arrangement. In vehicles, heat coils are often called heater cores.

On the liquid side of these heat exchangers, the common fluids are water, a water-glycol solution, steam, or a refrigerant. For &quot;heating coils&quot;, hot water and steam are the most common, and this heated fluid is supplied by boilers, for example. For &quot;cooling coils&quot;, chilled water and refrigerant are most common. Chilled water is supplied from a chiller that is potentially located very far away, but refrigerant must come from a nearby condensing unit. When a refrigerant is used, the cooling coil is the evaporator, and the heating coil is the condenser in the vapor-compression refrigeration cycle. HVAC coils that use this direct-expansion of refrigerants are commonly called &quot;DX coils&quot;. Some &quot;DX coils&quot; are &quot;microchannel&quot; type.

On the air side of HVAC coils a significant difference exists between those used for heating, and those for cooling. Due to psychrometrics, air that is cooled often has moisture condensing out of it, except with extremely dry air flows. Heating some air increases that airflow&#x27;s capacity to hold water. So heating coils need not consider moisture condensation on their air-side, but cooling coils &quot;must&quot; be adequately designed and selected to handle their particular &quot;latent&quot; (moisture) as well as the &quot;sensible&quot; (cooling) loads. The water that is removed is called &quot;condensate&quot;.

For many climates, water or steam HVAC coils can be exposed to freezing conditions. Because water expands upon freezing, these somewhat expensive and difficult to replace thin-walled heat exchangers can easily be damaged or destroyed by just one freeze. As such, freeze protection of coils is a major concern of HVAC designers, installers, and operators.

The introduction of indentations placed within the heat exchange fins controlled condensation, allowing water molecules to remain in the cooled air.

The heat exchangers in direct-combustion furnaces, typical in many residences, are not &#x27;coils&#x27;. They are, instead, gas-to-air heat exchangers that are typically made of stamped steel sheet metal. The combustion products pass on one side of these heat exchangers, and air to heat on the other. A &quot;cracked heat exchanger&quot; is therefore a dangerous situation that requires immediate attention because combustion products may enter living space.

==Helical-coil==

Although double-pipe heat exchangers are the simplest to design, the better choice in the following cases would be the helical-coil heat exchanger (HCHE):
* The main advantage of the HCHE, like that for the Spiral heat exchanger (SHE), is its highly efficient use of space, especially when it&#x27;s limited and not enough straight pipe can be laid.
* Under conditions of low flowrates (or laminar flow), such that the typical shell-and-tube exchangers have low heat-transfer coefficients and becoming uneconomical.
* When there is low pressure in one of the fluids, usually from accumulated pressure drops in other process equipment.
* When one of the fluids has components in multiple phases (solids, liquids, and gases), which tends to create mechanical problems during operations, such as plugging of small-diameter tubes. Cleaning of helical coils for these multiple-phase fluids can prove to be more difficult than its shell and tube counterpart; however the helical coil unit would require cleaning less often.

These have been used in the nuclear industry as a method for exchanging heat in a sodium system for large liquid metal fast breeder reactors since the early 1970s, using an HCHE device invented by Charles E. Boardman and John H. Germer. There are several simple methods for designing HCHE for all types of manufacturing industries, such as using the Ramachandra K. Patil (et al.) method from India and the Scott S. Haraburda method from the United States.

However, these are based upon assumptions of estimating inside heat transfer coefficient, predicting flow around the outside of the coil, and upon constant heat flux.

==Spiral==
A modification to the perpendicular flow of the typical HCHE involves the replacement of shell with another coiled tube, allowing the two fluids to flow parallel to one another, and which requires the use of different design calculations. These are the Spiral Heat Exchangers (SHE), which may refer to a helical (coiled) tube configuration, more generally, the term refers to a pair of flat surfaces that are coiled to form the two channels in a counter-flow arrangement. Each of the two channels has one long curved path. A pair of fluid ports are connected tangentially to the outer arms of the spiral, and axial ports are common, but optional.

The main advantage of the SHE is its highly efficient use of space. This attribute is often leveraged and partially reallocated to gain other improvements in performance, according to well known tradeoffs in heat exchanger design. (A notable tradeoff is capital cost vs operating cost.) A compact SHE may be used to have a smaller footprint and thus lower all-around capital costs, or an oversized SHE may be used to have less pressure drop, less pumping energy, higher thermal efficiency, and lower energy costs.

===Construction===
The distance between the sheets in the spiral channels is maintained by using spacer studs that were welded prior to rolling. Once the main spiral pack has been rolled, alternate top and bottom edges are welded and each end closed by a gasketed flat or conical cover bolted to the body. This ensures no mixing of the two fluids occurs. Any leakage is from the periphery cover to the atmosphere, or to a passage that contains the same fluid.

===Self cleaning===
Spiral heat exchangers are often used in the heating of fluids that contain solids and thus tend to foul the inside of the heat exchanger. The low pressure drop lets the SHE handle fouling more easily. The SHE uses a “self cleaning” mechanism, whereby fouled surfaces cause a localized increase in fluid velocity, thus increasing the drag (or fluid friction) on the fouled surface, thus helping to dislodge the blockage and keep the heat exchanger clean. &quot;The internal walls that make up the heat transfer surface are often rather thick, which makes the SHE very robust, and able to last a long time in demanding environments.&quot;
They are also easily cleaned, opening out like an oven where any buildup of foulant can be removed by pressure washing.

Self-cleaning water filters are used to keep the system clean and running without the need to shut down or replace cartridges and bags.

===Flow arrangements===

There are three main types of flows in a spiral heat exchanger:
* Counter-current Flow: Fluids flow in opposite directions. These are used for liquid-liquid, condensing and gas cooling applications. Units are usually mounted vertically when condensing vapour and mounted horizontally when handling high concentrations of solids.
* Spiral Flow/Cross Flow: One fluid is in spiral flow and the other in a cross flow. Spiral flow passages are welded at each side for this type of spiral heat exchanger. This type of flow is suitable for handling low density gas, which passes through the cross flow, avoiding pressure loss. It can be used for liquid-liquid applications if one liquid has a considerably greater flow rate than the other.
* Distributed Vapour/Spiral flow: This design is that of a condenser, and is usually mounted vertically. It is designed to cater for the sub-cooling of both condensate and non-condensables. The coolant moves in a spiral and leaves via the top. Hot gases that enter leave as condensate via the bottom outlet.

===Applications===
The Spiral heat exchanger is good for applications such as pasteurization, digester heating, heat recovery, pre-heating (see: recuperator), and effluent cooling. For sludge treatment, SHEs are generally smaller than other types of heat exchangers. These are used to transfer the heat.

==Selection==
Due to the many variables involved, selecting optimal heat exchangers is challenging. Hand calculations are possible, but many iterations are typically needed. As such, heat exchangers are most often selected via computer programs, either by system designers, who are typically engineers, or by equipment vendors.

To select an appropriate heat exchanger, the system designers (or equipment vendors) would firstly consider the design limitations for each heat exchanger type.
Though cost is often the primary criterion, several other selection criteria are important:
* High/low pressure limits
* Thermal performance
* Temperature ranges
* Product mix (liquid/liquid, particulates or high-solids liquid)
* Pressure drops across the exchanger
* Fluid flow capacity
* Cleanability, maintenance and repair
* Materials required for construction
* Ability and ease of future expansion
* Material selection, such as copper, aluminium, carbon steel, stainless steel, nickel alloys, ceramic, polymer, and titanium.

Small-diameter coil technologies are becoming more popular in modern air conditioning and refrigeration systems because they have better rates of heat transfer than conventional sized condenser and evaporator coils with round copper tubes and aluminum or copper fin that have been the standard in the HVAC industry. Small diameter coils can withstand the higher pressures required by the new generation of environmentally friendlier refrigerants. Two small diameter coil technologies are currently available for air conditioning and refrigeration products: copper microgroove and brazed aluminum microchannel.

Choosing the right heat exchanger (HX) requires some knowledge of the different heat exchanger types, as well as the environment where the unit must operate. Typically in the manufacturing industry, several differing types of heat exchangers are used for just one process or system to derive the final product. For example, a kettle HX for pre-heating, a double pipe HX for the &#x27;carrier&#x27; fluid and a plate and frame HX for final cooling. With sufficient knowledge of heat exchanger types and operating requirements, an appropriate selection can be made to optimise the process.

==Monitoring and maintenance==
Online monitoring of commercial heat exchangers is done by tracking the overall heat transfer coefficient. The overall heat transfer coefficient tends to decline over time due to fouling.

By periodically calculating the overall heat transfer coefficient from exchanger flow rates and temperatures, the owner of the heat exchanger can estimate when cleaning the heat exchanger is economically attractive.

Integrity inspection of plate and tubular heat exchanger can be tested in situ by the conductivity or helium gas methods. These methods confirm the integrity of the plates or tubes to prevent any cross contamination and the condition of the gaskets.

Mechanical integrity monitoring of heat exchanger tubes may be conducted through Nondestructive methods such as eddy current testing.

===Fouling===

Fouling occurs when impurities deposit on the heat exchange surface.
Deposition of these impurities can decrease heat transfer effectiveness significantly over time and are caused by:
* Low wall shear stress
* Low fluid velocities
* High fluid velocities
* Reaction product solid precipitation
* Precipitation of dissolved impurities due to elevated wall temperatures

The rate of heat exchanger fouling is determined by the rate of particle deposition less re-entrainment/suppression. This model was originally proposed in 1959 by Kern and Seaton.

Crude Oil Exchanger Fouling. In commercial crude oil refining, crude oil is heated from to prior to entering the distillation column. A series of shell and tube heat exchangers typically exchange heat between crude oil and other oil streams to heat the crude to prior to heating in a furnace. Fouling occurs on the crude side of these exchangers due to asphaltene insolubility. The nature of asphaltene solubility in crude oil was successfully modeled by Wiehe and Kennedy. The precipitation of insoluble asphaltenes in crude preheat trains has been successfully modeled as a first order reaction by Ebert and Panchal who expanded on the work of Kern and Seaton.

Cooling Water Fouling.
Cooling water systems are susceptible to fouling. Cooling water typically has a high total dissolved solids content and suspended colloidal solids. Localized precipitation of dissolved solids occurs at the heat exchange surface due to wall temperatures higher than bulk fluid temperature. Low fluid velocities (less than 3 ft/s) allow suspended solids to settle on the heat exchange surface. Cooling water is typically on the tube side of a shell and tube exchanger because it&#x27;s easy to clean. To prevent fouling, designers typically ensure that cooling water velocity is greater than and bulk fluid temperature is maintained less than . Other approaches to control fouling control combine the &quot;blind&quot; application of biocides and anti-scale chemicals with periodic lab testing.

===Maintenance===
Plate and frame heat exchangers can be disassembled and cleaned periodically. Tubular heat exchangers can be cleaned by such methods as acid cleaning, sandblasting, high-pressure water jet, bullet cleaning, or drill rods.

In large-scale cooling water systems for heat exchangers, water treatment such as purification, addition of chemicals, and testing, is used to minimize fouling of the heat exchange equipment. Other water treatment is also used in steam systems for power plants, etc. to minimize fouling and corrosion of the heat exchange and other equipment.

A variety of companies have started using water borne oscillations technology to prevent biofouling. Without the use of chemicals, this type of technology has helped in providing a low-pressure drop in heat exchangers.

== Design and manufacturing regulations ==
The design and manufacturing of heat exchangers has numerous regulations, which vary according to the region in which they will be used.

Design and manufacturing codes include: ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (US); PD 5500 (UK); BS 1566 (UK); EN 13445 (EU); CODAP (French); Pressure Equipment Safety Regulations 2016 (PER) (UK); Pressure Equipment Directive (EU); NORSOK (Norwegian); TEMA; API 12; and API 560.

==In nature==

===Humans===
The human nasal passages serve as a heat exchanger, with cool air being inhaled and warm air being exhaled. Its effectiveness can be demonstrated by putting the hand in front of the face and exhaling, first through the nose and then through the mouth. Air exhaled through the nose is substantially cooler. This effect can be enhanced with clothing, by, for example, wearing a scarf over the face while breathing in cold weather.

In species that have external testes (such as human), the artery to the testis is surrounded by a mesh of veins called the pampiniform plexus. This cools the blood heading to the testes, while reheating the returning blood.

===Birds, fish, marine mammals===
&quot;Countercurrent&quot; heat exchangers occur naturally in the circulatory systems of fish, whales and other marine mammals. Arteries to the skin carrying warm blood are intertwined with veins from the skin carrying cold blood, causing the warm arterial blood to exchange heat with the cold venous blood. This reduces the overall heat loss in cold water. Heat exchangers are also present in the tongues of baleen whales as large volumes of water flow through their mouths. Wading birds use a similar system to limit heat losses from their body through their legs into the water.

===Carotid rete===
Carotid rete is a counter-current heat exchanging organ in some ungulates. The blood ascending the carotid arteries on its way to the brain, flows via a network of vessels where heat is discharged to the veins of cooler blood descending from the nasal passages. The carotid rete allows Thomson&#x27;s gazelle to maintain its brain almost 3 °C (5.4 °F) cooler than the rest of the body, and therefore aids in tolerating bursts in metabolic heat production such as associated with outrunning cheetahs (during which the body temperature exceeds the maximum temperature at which the brain could function). Humans with other primates lack a carotid rete.

==In industry==
Heat exchangers are widely used in industry both for cooling and heating large scale industrial processes. The type and size of heat exchanger used can be tailored to suit a process depending on the type of fluid, its phase, temperature, density, viscosity, pressures, chemical composition and various other thermodynamic properties.

In many industrial processes there is waste of energy or a heat stream that is being exhausted, heat exchangers can be used to recover this heat and put it to use by heating a different stream in the process. This practice saves a lot of money in industry, as the heat supplied to other streams from the heat exchangers would otherwise come from an external source that is more expensive and more harmful to the environment.

Heat exchangers are used in many industries, including:
* Waste water treatment
* Refrigeration
* Wine and beer making
* Petroleum refining
* Nuclear power

In waste water treatment, heat exchangers play a vital role in maintaining optimal temperatures within anaerobic digesters to promote the growth of microbes that remove pollutants. Common types of heat exchangers used in this application are the double pipe heat exchanger as well as the plate and frame heat exchanger.

==In aircraft==
In commercial aircraft heat exchangers are used to take heat from the engine&#x27;s oil system to heat cold fuel. This improves fuel efficiency, as well as reduces the possibility of water entrapped in the fuel freezing in components.

==Current market and forecast==
Estimated at US$17.5 billion in 2021, the global demand of heat exchangers is expected to experience robust growth of about 5% annually over the next years. The market value is expected to reach US$27 billion by 2030. With an expanding desire for environmentally friendly options and increased development of offices, retail sectors, and public buildings, market expansion is due to grow.

==A model of a simple heat exchanger==

A simple heat exchange might be thought of as two straight pipes with fluid flow, which are thermally connected. Let the pipes be of equal length &quot;L&quot;, carrying fluids with heat capacity formula_1 (energy per unit mass per unit change in temperature) and let the mass flow rate of the fluids through the pipes, both in the same direction, be formula_2 (mass per unit time), where the subscript &quot;i&quot; applies to pipe 1 or pipe 2.

Temperature profiles for the pipes are formula_3 and formula_4 where &quot;x&quot; is the distance along the pipe. Assume a steady state, so that the temperature profiles are not functions of time. Assume also that the only transfer of heat from a small volume of fluid in one pipe is to the fluid element in the other pipe at the same position, i.e., there is no transfer of heat along a pipe due to temperature differences in that pipe. By Newton&#x27;s law of cooling the rate of change in energy of a small volume of fluid is proportional to the difference in temperatures between it and the corresponding element in the other pipe:

:formula_5

:formula_6

( this is for parallel flow in the same direction and opposite temperature gradients, but for counter-flow heat exchange countercurrent exchange the sign is opposite in the second equation in front of formula_7 ), where formula_8 is the thermal energy per unit length and γ is the thermal connection constant per unit length between the two pipes. This change in internal energy results in a change in the temperature of the fluid element. The time rate of change for the fluid element being carried along by the flow is:

:formula_9

:formula_10

where formula_11 is the &quot;thermal mass flow rate&quot;. The differential equations governing the heat exchanger may now be written as:

:formula_12

:formula_13

Since the system is in a steady state, there are no partial derivatives of temperature with respect to time, and since there is no heat transfer along the pipe, there are no second derivatives in &quot;x&quot; as is found in the heat equation. These two coupled first-order differential equations may be solved to yield:

:formula_14

:formula_15

where formula_16, formula_17,

:formula_18

(this is for parallel-flow, but for counter-flow the sign in front of formula_19 is negative, so that if formula_20, for the same &quot;thermal mass flow rate&quot; in both opposite directions, the gradient of temperature is constant and the temperatures linear in position &quot;x&quot; with a constant difference formula_21 along the exchanger, explaining why the counter current design countercurrent exchange is the most efficient )

and &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are two as yet undetermined constants of integration. Let formula_22 and formula_23 be the temperatures at x=0 and let formula_24 and formula_25 be the temperatures at the end of the pipe at x=L. Define the average temperatures in each pipe as:

:formula_26
:formula_27

Using the solutions above, these temperatures are:

Choosing any two of the temperatures above eliminates the constants of integration, letting us find the other four temperatures. We find the total energy transferred by integrating the expressions for the time rate of change of internal energy per unit length:

:formula_28

:formula_29

By the conservation of energy, the sum of the two energies is zero. The quantity formula_30 is known as the &quot;Log mean temperature difference&quot;, and is a measure of the effectiveness of the heat exchanger in transferring heat energy.

<text>Peine is a district in Lower Saxony, Germany. It is bounded by (from the south and clockwise) the districts of Hildesheim, Hanover and Gifhorn, and the cities of Brunswick and Salzgitter.

==History==

Until the early 19th century, the territory of the district belonged to Brunswick-Celle, Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, and the Bishopric of Hildesheim. After 1815, both Brunswick-Celle and Hildesheim belonged to the Kingdom of Hanover. In 1866, Hanover fell to Prussia. The Prussian administration established districts (&quot;Kreise&quot;) in 1885, among them Peine.

The region has a smelting tradition, the associated mining tradition lasted until 1976 when the last existing mine was closed. One of the best known events in local history was the mining disaster of Lengede in 1963, when 29 miners died and 11 miners were rescued two weeks after the incident.

==Geography==

The district comprises the space between the cities of Hanover and Brunswick. The Fuhse river enters the district in the south, runs through the town of Peine and leaves northwards to Celle.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms is derived from the arms of the County of Wolfenbüttel-Asseburg. This county existed only until 1260, but its rulers were responsible for the foundation of Peine.

==Cities and municipalities==


== Notable people from Peine ==
*Hans-Hermann Hoppe, anarcho-capitalist economics professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas and a Distinguished Fellow with the Ludwig von Mises Institute

<doc id="153223" wikidata="Q3058841" url="?curid=153223" title="Chinese nationalism">
<text>Chinese nationalism is a form of nationalism which asserts that the Chinese people are a nation and promotes the cultural and national unity of all Chinese people. According to Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s philosophy in the Three Principles of the People, Chinese nationalism is evaluated as multi-ethnic nationalism, which should be distinguished from Han nationalism or local ethnic nationalism.

Modern Chinese nationalism emerged in the late Qing dynasty (1644–1912) in response to China&#x27;s humiliating defeat at the end of the First Sino-Japanese War and the invasion and pillaging of Beijing by the Eight-Nation Alliance. In the aftermath of both events, China was forced to pay financial reparations and grant special privileges to foreigners. The nationwide image of China as a superior Celestial Empire which was located at the center of the universe was shattered, and last-minute efforts to modernize the old system were unsuccessful. These last-minute efforts were best exemplified by Liang Qichao, a late Qing reformer who failed to reform the Qing government in 1896 and was later expelled from China and fled to Japan, where he began to develop his ideas of Chinese nationalism.

The effects of World War I continually shaped Chinese nationalism. Despite the fact that it had joined the Allied Powers, China was again severely humiliated by the Versailles Treaty of 1919, which transferred the special privileges which were given to Germany to the Empire of Japan. This event triggered the May Fourth Movement of 1919, which developed into nationwide protests that were marked by a surge of Chinese nationalism. During the Warlord Era, large-scale military campaigns which were led by the Kuomintang (KMT), overpowered provincial warlords and sharply reduced special privileges for foreigners contributed to the strengthening and aggrandizing of a sense of Chinese national identity.
After the Empire of Japan was defeated by the Allies at the end of World War II, Chinese nationalism again gained traction as China recovered territories which it lost to Japan before the war, including Northeast area and the island of Taiwan. However, the Chinese Civil War, (which was paused during the Second Sino-Japanese War) was resumed, damaging the image of a unified Chinese identity. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) was victorious in 1949, as the KMT&#x27;s government retreated to Taiwan. Under Mao Zedong, the CCP began to employ Chinese nationalism as a political tool. Chinese nationalism has become more Han-centric since Xi Jinping assumed power in 2012.

==Historical development==

The first state of China was confirmed as the Shang dynasty (c. 1570 BC-c. 1045 BC). The Chinese concept of the world was largely a division between the civilized world and the barbarian world and there was little concept of the belief that Chinese interests were served by a powerful Chinese state. Commenter Lucian Pye has argued that the modern &quot;nation state&quot; is fundamentally different from a traditional empire, and argues that dynamics of the current People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) – a concentration of power at a central point of authority – share an essential similarity with the Ming and Qing Empires.

As it emerged in the early 20th century, Chinese nationalism was modeled after Japanese nationalism, especially as it was viewed and interpreted by Sun Yat-sen. In 1894, Sun founded the Revive China Society, which was the first Chinese nationalist revolutionary society.

Chinese nationalism was rooted in the long historic tradition in which China was considered the center of the world, in which all other states were offshoots of China and owed some sort of deference to it. That sense of superiority underwent a series of terrible shocks in the 19th century, including large-scale internal revolts, and more grievously the systematic gaining and removal of special rights and privileges by foreign nations which proved their military superiority during the First and Second Opium Wars, based on modern technology that was lacking in China. It was a matter of humiliation one after another, the loss of faith in the Qing dynasty. By the 1890s, disaffected Chinese intellectuals began to develop &quot;a new nationalist commitment to China as a nation-state in a world dominated by predatory imperialist nation states.&quot; Overall, their concern was not in preserving a traditional Chinese order but instead the construction of a strong state and society that could stand in a hostile international arena.

Unlike many nationalist projects in other countries, the trend among Chinese intellectuals was to regard tradition as unsuitable for China&#x27;s survival and instead to view tradition as a source of China&#x27;s problems. For the Qing dynasty, ethnicity was a troublesome issue. Some of the ethnic groups within the empire were identified according to language and culture, including the Manchus who originated in a non-Han Chinese population and ruled the dynasty. Most citizens had multiple identities, of which the locality was more important than the nation as a whole. Anyone who wanted to rise in government non-military service had to be immersed in Confucian classics, and pass the imperial examination. If accepted, they would be rotated around the country, so the bureaucrats did not identify with the locality. The depth of two-way understanding and trust developed by European political leaders and their followers did not exist.

China&#x27;s defeat by Japan at the end of the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895) was fundamental to the development of the first generation of Chinese nationalists. The most dramatic watershed came in 1900, in the wake of the invasion, capture, and pillaging of the national capital by the Eight-Nation Alliance that punished China for the Boxer Rebellion. During the Late Qing reforms, the rise of the national education trend emphasizes instilling national values in education and inspiring patriotic sentiments. For example, the Chinese geography textbooks published during the period usually praised China&#x27;s superior geographical conditions, and such texts generally came from the first chapters of the textbooks, which were convenient for guiding students to develop a love for their motherland when they first came into contact with China&#x27;s geography. Chinese nationalists drew inspiration from Japan&#x27;s victory in the Russo-Japanese War, which they broadly viewed as demonstrating the fallacy of a European-centric racial hierarchy.

The Second Sino-Japanese war was one of the most important events in the modern construction of Chinese nationalism. The Chinese experience in the war helped create an ideology based on the concept of “the people” as a political body in its own right, “a modern nation as opposed to a feudal empire.”

==Ideological sources==


The discussion about modern Chinese nationalism has dominated many political and intellectual debates since the late nineteenth century. Political scientist Suisheng Zhao argues that nationalism in China is not monolithic because it exists in various forms, including political, liberal, ethnic, and state nationalism. During the first half of the twentieth century, Chinese nationalism constituted a crucial part of many political ideologies, including anti-Manchuism, which was espoused during the 1911 Revolution, the anti-imperialist sentiment of the May Fourth Movement in 1919, and the Maoist thoughts that guided the Communist Revolution in 1949. The origin of modern Chinese nationalism can be traced back to the intellectual debate about the subjects of race and nation which occurred during the late nineteenth century. Shaped by the global discourse about Social Darwinism, reformers and intellectuals both held debates about how they should build a new Chinese national subject based on a proper racial order, particularly on Manchu-Han relations. After the collapse of the Qing regime and the founding of the Republic of China in 1912, concerns about domestic and international threats caused the role of racism to decline and during the 1910s, anti-imperialism became the new dominant ideology of Chinese nationalism. While intellectuals and elites advocated their distinctive thoughts about Chinese nationalism, political scientist Chalmers Johnson has pointed out that most of these ideas had very little to do with China&#x27;s majority population—the Chinese peasantry. Thus, he proposes to supplement the ideology of the Chinese Communist Party in the discussion of Chinese nationalism, which he labels &quot;peasant nationalism.&quot;

In some revolutionary circles in the 19th century, the significance of the development of a Chinese national identity was the result of an attempt to negatively identify the Han people by turning them against the Qing dynasty, which was non-Chinese in their view. Under this initial view of Chinese nationalism, the Chinese identity was primarily associated with the majority Han ethnic group.

After Qing China&#x27;s defeat at the end of the Sino-Japanese War of 1895, reformers and intellectuals debated about how to strengthen the nation, the discussion of which centered on the issue of race. Liang Qichao, a late Qing reformist who participated in the Hundred Days&#x27; Reform of 1898, contended that the boundary between Han and Manchu must be erased (&quot;ping Man-Han zhi jie&quot;). Liang was among the most prominent nationalists who viewed earlier conceptions of a Han-focused national identity as too restrictive. Liang attributed the decline of China to the Qing dynasty which was founded by the Manchus, who treated the Han as an &quot;alien race&quot; and imposed a racial hierarchy between the Han and the Manchus and ignored the threats which were posed by imperial powers. However Liang&#x27;s critique of the Qing court and the Manchu-Han relations laid the foundation for anti-Manchuism, an ideology that early Republican and nationalist revolutionaries advocated in accordance with their efforts to overthrow the Qing dynasty and found a new Republic in China. More broadly, Liang&#x27;s view was that modernity was &quot;an age of struggle among nations for the survival of the fittest&quot; and that therefore the Qing government should support industrialization and develop a Chinese people with strong work ethic, &quot;a strong sense of nationalism, and a militaristic mentality.&quot;

In his writing &quot;Revolutionary Army,&quot; Zou Rong, an active Chinese revolutionary at the turn of the twentieth century, demanded an educational revolution for the Han people who were suffering under the oppressive rule of the Manchus. He argued that China should be a nation of the orthodox Han Chinese and no alien race shall rule over them. According to Zou, the Han Chinese, as the descendants of the Yellow Emperor, must overthrow the Manchu rule to restore their legitimacy and rights. Wang Jingwei, a Chinese revolutionary who later became an important figure in the Kuomintang, also believed that the Manchus were an inferior race. Wang contended that a state consisting of a single race would be superior to those multiracial ones. Most of the Republican revolutionaries agreed that preserving the race was vital to the survival of the nation. Since the Han had asserted its dominant role in Chinese nationalism, the Manchus had to be either absorbed or eradicated. Historian Prasenjit Duara summarized this by stating that the Republican revolutionaries primarily drew on the international discourse of &quot;racist evolutionism&quot; to envision a &quot;racially purified China.&quot;
After the 1911 Revolution, Sun Yat-sen established the Republic of China, the national flag of which contained five colors with each symbolizing a major racial ethnicity of China. This marked a shift from the earlier discourse about radical racism and the assimilation of the non-Han groups to a discourse about the political autonomy of the five races. The rhetorical move, as China historian Joseph Esherick points out, was based on practical concerns about imperial threats from the international environment and conflicts on the Chinese frontiers. While both Japan and Russia were encroaching China, the newly born republic also faced ethnic movements in Mongolia and Tibet which claimed themselves to be part of the Qing Empire rather than the Republic of China. Pressured by both domestic and international problems, the fragile Republican regime decided to maintain the borders of the Qing Empire to keep its territories intact. With the increasing threat from the imperialist powers in the 1910s, anti-imperialist sentiments started to grow and spread in China. An ideal of &quot;a morally just universe,&quot; anti-imperialism made racism appear shameful and thus took over its dominant role in the conceptualization of Chinese nationalism. Yet racism never perished. Instead, it was embedded by other social realms, including the discourse of eugenics and racial hygiene.

The Blue Shirts Society, a fascist paramilitary organization within the Kuomintang that modelled itself after Mussolini&#x27;s blackshirts of the National Fascist Party, was anti-foreign and anti-communist, and it stated that its agenda was to expel foreign (Japanese and Western) imperialists from China, crush Communism, and eliminate feudalism. In addition to being anticommunist, some KMT members, like Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s right-hand man Dai Li were anti-American, and wanted to expel American influence. In addition, the close Sino-German relations at the time promoted close ties between the Nationalist Government and Nazi Germany. The New Life Movement was a government-led civic movement in 1930s China initiated by Chiang Kai-shek to promote cultural reform and Neo-Confucian social morality and to ultimately unite China under a centralized ideology following the emergence of ideological challenges to the status quo. The Movement attempted to counter threats of Western and Japanese imperialism through a resurrection of traditional Chinese morality, which it held to be superior to modern Western values. As such the Movement was based upon Confucianism, mixed with Christianity, nationalism and authoritarianism that have some similarities to fascism. It rejected individualism and liberalism, while also opposing socialism and communism. Some historians regard this movement as imitating Nazism and being a neo-nationalistic movement used to elevate Chiang&#x27;s control of everyday lives. Frederic Wakeman suggested that the New Life Movement was &quot;Confucian fascism&quot;.

In response to the Cultural Revolution, Chiang Kai-shek launched a Chinese Cultural Renaissance movement which followed in the steps of the New Life Movement, the movement promoted Confucian values.

In addition to anti-Manchuism and anti-imperialism, political scientist Chalmers Johnson has argued that the CCP&#x27;s rise to power through its alliance with the peasantry should also be understood as &quot;a species of nationalism.&quot; Johnson observes that social mobilization, a force that unites people to form a political community together, is the &quot;primary tool&quot; for conceptualizing nationalism. In the context of social mobilization, Chinese nationalism only fully emerged during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945), when the CCP mobilized the peasantry to fight against the Japanese invaders. Johnson contends that early nationalism of the Kuomintang was quite similar to the late nineteenth-century nationalism in Europe, as both referred to the search for their national identities and positions in the modern world by the intelligentsia. He argues that nationalism constructed by the intellectuals is not identical to nationalism based on mass mobilization, as the nationalist movements led by the Kuomintang, as well as the May Fourth Movement in 1919, were not mass movements because their participants were only a small proportion of the society where the peasants were simply absent. When the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out in 1937, the CCP began to mobilize the Chinese peasantry through mass propaganda of national salvation () Johnson observed that the primary shift of the CCP&#x27;s post-1937 propaganda was its focus on the discourse of national salvation and the temporary retreat of its Communist agenda on class struggle and land redistribution. The wartime alliance of the Chinese peasantry and the CCP manifests how the nationalist ideology of the CCP, or the peasant nationalism, reinforced the desire of the Chinese to save and build a strong nation.
Irredentism and expansionism have also played a role in Chinese nationalism, declaring that China should regain its &quot;lost territories&quot; and form a Greater China. To this day, the Republic of China maintains its territorial claims since its inception in 1912. Its territorial claims were inherited from the Great Qing government as part of the Imperial Edict of the Abdication of the Qing Emperor.

==Ethnicity==

Defining the relationship between ethnicity and the Chinese identity has been a very complex issue throughout Chinese history. In the 17th century, with the help of Ming Chinese rebels, the Manchus conquered China proper and set up the Qing dynasty. Over the next centuries, they would incorporate groups such as the Tibetans, the Mongols, and the Uyghurs into territories which they controlled. The Manchus were faced with the simultaneous task of maintaining loyalty among the people who they ruled and maintaining their distinct identity. The main method by which they accomplished control of the Chinese heartland was by portraying themselves as enlightened Confucian sages part of whose goal was to preserve and advance Chinese civilization. Over the course of centuries, the Manchus were gradually assimilated into Chinese culture and eventually, many Manchus identified themselves as a people of China.

The Chinese nation has also been referred to as the descendants of Yan and Yellow Emperors, legendary rulers who are considered the historical ancestors of the Huaxia people, an ethnic group whose members were the ancestors of the Han Chinese.

The complexity of the relationship between ethnicity and Chinese identity was best exemplified during the Taiping Rebellion in which the rebels fiercely fought against the Manchus on the ground that they were barbarians and foreigners while at the same time, others fought just as fiercely on behalf of the Manchus on the ground that they were the preservers of traditional Chinese values.

The Yihetuan, also known as the Boxers, were a Chinese nationalist and pro-Qing monarchist secret society which instigated and led the Boxer Rebellion from 1899 to 1901. Their motivations were Anti-Christianism and resistance to Westernisation. At their peak, the Boxers were supported by some members of the Imperial Army. Their slogan was &quot;Support the Qing, destroy the foreigners!&quot;.

In 1909, the &quot;Law of Nationality of Great Qing&quot; () was published by the Manchu government, which defined Chinese with the following rules: 1) born in China while his/her father is a Chinese; 2) born after his/her father&#x27;s death while his/her father is a Chinese at his death; 3) his/her mother is a Chinese while his/her father&#x27;s nationality is unclear or stateless.

In 1919, the May Fourth Movement grew out of student protests against the Treaty of Versailles, especially its terms allowing Japan to keep territories surrendered by Germany after the Siege of Tsingtao, and spurned upsurges of Chinese nationalism amongst the protests.

In the 1920s and 1930s, the official Chinese nationalistic view was heavily influenced by modernism and Social Darwinism, and it included advocacy of the cultural assimilation of ethnic groups in the western and central provinces into the &quot;culturally advanced&quot; Han state, a policy which would enable them to become members of the Chinese nation in name as well as in fact. Furthermore, it was also influenced by the fate of multi-ethnic states such as Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire. It also became a very powerful force during the Japanese occupation of Coastal China during the 1930s and 1940s and the atrocities committed then.

Influenced by the 1911 Revolution and the appearance of modern nationalist theories, &quot;Zhonghua minzu&quot; in the early Republic of China, referred to the Five Races Under One Union concept. This principle held that the five major ethnicities in China, the Han Chinese, Manchus, Mongols, Hui, and Tibetans, all belonged to a single Chinese identity. The government promoted Chinese nationalism for these five ethnic groups but with the Han Chinese are main ethnic group of &quot;Zhonghua minzu&quot; or China, this continued by Nationalist rule under Chiang Kai-shek and his Kuomintang in all China until the proclamation of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in Chinese Mainland and the Republic of China retreated to Taiwan.

While it was initially rejected by Mao Zedong and his Chinese Communist Party, it was later accepted, the concept of &quot;Chinese&quot; which was developed during Mao&#x27;s rule was that of a &quot;huge Chinese family&quot; or a political union which includes the Han Chinese and 55 other ethnic groups. Following the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the government extended the number of ethnicities comprising the Chinese nation to these 56.

Before Xi Jinping took power in 2012, the People&#x27;s Republic of China&#x27;s form of Chinese nationalism was strongly influenced by the Soviet Union&#x27;s Korenizatsiya policy. The Chinese Communist Party also criticized the Kuomintang-led Republic of China&#x27;s support of Han chauvinism. The official ideology of the People&#x27;s Republic of China asserts that China is a multi-ethnic state, where the majority Han constitute one of many ethnic groups of China, each group&#x27;s culture and language should be respected (akin to Soviet patriotism). The government also instituted policies of affirmative action, in general, the ethnic policy of the People&#x27;s Republic of China at the time was strongly influenced by the nature of its Marxist-Leninist state. Despite this official view, assimilationist attitudes remain deeply entrenched, and popular views and actual power relationships create a situation in which Chinese nationalism has in practice meant Han dominance of minority areas and peoples and assimilation of those groups. Since Xi Jinping took power, assimilation of non-Han ethnic groups has been overt and intensified while preferential policies for ethnic minorities have shrunk.

During the 1960s and 1970s, Chinese nationalism within mainland China became mixed with the rhetoric of Marxism, and as a result, nationalistic rhetoric was largely subsumed into internationalist rhetoric. On the other hand, the primary focus of Chinese nationalism in Taiwan was the preservation of the ideals and lineage of Sun Yat-sen, the party which he founded, the Kuomintang (KMT), and anti-Communism. While the definition of Chinese nationalism differed in the Republic of China (ROC) and the PRC, the KMT and the CCP were both adamant in their claims on Chinese territories such as Senkaku (Diaoyutai) Islands.

In the 1990s, the dissolution of the Soviet Union, rising economic standards and the lack of any other legitimizing ideology, has led to what most observers see as a resurgence of nationalism within mainland China.

=== Ethnic minorities ===
==== Chinese Muslims and Uyghurs ====
Chinese Muslims have played an important role in Chinese nationalism. Chinese Muslims, known as Hui people, are a mixture of the descendants of foreign Muslims like Arabs and Persians, mixed with Han Chinese who converted to Islam. Chinese Muslims are sinophones, speaking Chinese and practicing Confucianism.

During the Second Sino-Japanese War, Chinese Muslims played an extensive role in resistance against Japan.

Hu Songshan, a Muslim Imam from Ningxia, was a Chinese nationalist and preached Chinese nationalism and unity of all Chinese people, and also against foreign imperialism and other threats to China&#x27;s sovereignty. He even ordered the Chinese Flag to be saluted during prayer, and that all Imams in Ningxia preach Chinese nationalism. Hu Songshan led the Ikhwan, the Chinese Muslim Brotherhood, which became a Chinese nationalist, patriotic organization, stressing education and independence of the individual. Hu Songhan also wrote a prayer in Arabic and Chinese, praying for Allah to support the Chinese Kuomintang government and defeat Japan. Hu Songshan also cited a Hadith (), a saying of the prophet Muhammad, which says &quot;Loving the Motherland is equivalent to loving the Faith&quot; (). Hu Songshan harshly criticized those who were non-patriotic and those who taught anti-nationalist thinking, saying that they were fake Muslims.

Ma Qixi was a Muslim reformer, leader of the Xidaotang, and he taught that Islam could only be understood by using Chinese culture such as Confucianism. He read classic Chinese texts and even took his cue from Laozi when he decided to go on Hajj to Mecca.

Ma Fuxiang, a Chinese Muslim general and Kuomintang member, was another Chinese nationalist. Ma Fuxiang preached unity of all Chinese people, and even non-Han Chinese people such as Tibetans and Mongols to stay in China. He proclaimed that Mongolia and Tibet were part of the Republic of China, and not independent countries. Ma Fuxiang was loyal to the Chinese government, and crushed Muslim rebels when ordered to. Ma Fuxiang believed that modern education would help Hui Chinese build a better society and help China resist foreign imperialism and help build the nation. He was praised for his &quot;guojia yizhi&quot;(national consciousness) by non-Muslims. Ma Fuxiang also published many books, and wrote on Confucianism and Islam, having studied both the Quran and the Spring and Autumn Annals.

Ma Fuxiang had served under the Chinese Muslim general Dong Fuxiang, and fought against the foreigners during the Boxer Rebellion. The Muslim unit he served in was noted for being anti-foreign, being involved in shooting a Westerner and a Japanese to death before the Boxer Rebellion broke out. It was reported that the Muslim troops were going to wipe out the foreigners to return a golden age for China, and the Muslims repeatedly attacked foreign churches, railways, and legations, before hostilities even started. The Muslim troops were armed with modern repeater rifles and artillery, and reportedly enthusiastic about going on the offensive and killing foreigners. Ma Fuxiang led an ambush against the foreigners at Langfang and inflicted many casualties, using a train to escape. Dong Fuxiang was a xenophobe and hated foreigners, wanting to drive them out of China.

Various Muslim organizations in China like the Islamic Association of China and the Chinese Muslim Association were sponsored by the Kuomintang and the Chinese Communist Party.

Chinese Muslim imams had synthesized Islam and Confucianism in the Han Kitab. They asserted that there was no contradiction between Confucianism and Islam, and no contradiction between being a Chinese national and a Muslim. Chinese Muslim students returning from study abroad, from places such as Al-Azhar University in Egypt, learned about nationalism and advocated Chinese nationalism at home. One Imam, Wang Jingzhai, who studied at Mecca, translated a Hadith, or saying of Muhammad, &quot;Aiguo Aijiao&quot;- loving the country is equivalent to loving the faith. Chinese Muslims believed that their &quot;Watan&quot; was the whole of the Republic of China, non-Muslims included.

General Bai Chongxi, the warlord of Guangxi, and a member of the Kuomintang, presented himself as the protector of Islam in China and harbored Muslim intellectuals fleeing from the Japanese invasion in Guangxi. General Bai preached Chinese nationalism and anti-imperialism. Chinese Muslims were sent to Saudi Arabia and Egypt to denounce the Japanese. Translations from Egyptian writings and the Quran were used to support propaganda in favour of a Jihad against Japan.
Ma Bufang, a Chinese Muslim general who was part of the Kuomintang, supported Chinese nationalism and tolerance between the different Chinese ethnic groups. The Japanese attempted to approach him however, their attempts at gaining his support were unsuccessful. Ma Bufang presented himself as a Chinese nationalist who fought against Western imperialism to the people of China in order to deflect criticism by opponents that his government was feudal and oppressed minorities like Tibetans and Buddhist Mongols. He presented himself as a Chinese nationalist to his advantage to keep himself in power as noted by the author Erden.

In Xinjiang, the Chinese Muslim general Ma Hushan supported Chinese nationalism. He was chief of the 36th Division of the National Revolutionary Army. He spread anti-Soviet, and anti-Japanese propaganda, and instituted a colonial regime over the Uyghurs. Uyghur street names and signs were changed to Chinese, and the Chinese Muslim troops imported Chinese cooks and baths, rather than using Uyghur ones. The Chinese Muslims even forced the Uyghur carpet industry at Khotan to change its design to Chinese versions. Ma Hushan proclaimed his loyalty to Nanjing, denounced Sheng Shicai as a Soviet puppet, and fought against him in 1937.

The Tungans (Chinese Muslims, Hui people) had anti-Japanese sentiment.

General Ma Hushan&#x27;s brother Ma Zhongying denounced separatism in a speech at Id Kah Mosque and told the Uyghurs to be loyal to the Chinese government at Nanjing. The 36th division had crushed the Turkish Islamic Republic of East Turkestan, and the Chinese Muslim general Ma Zhancang beheaded the Uyghur emirs Abdullah Bughra and Nur Ahmad Jan Bughra. Ma Zhancang abolished the Islamic Sharia law which was set up by the Uyghurs, and set up military rule instead, retaining the former Chinese officials and keeping them in power. The Uyghurs had been promoting Islamism in their separatist government, but Ma Hushan eliminated religion from politics. Islam was barely mentioned or used in politics or life except as a vague spiritual focus for unified opposition against the Soviet Union.

The Uyghur warlord Yulbars Khan was pro-China and supported the Republic of China. The Uyghur politician Masud Sabri served as the governor of Xinjiang Province from 1947 to 1949.

==== Tibetans ====

Pandatsang Rapga, a Tibetan politician, founded the Tibet Improvement Party with the goal of modernisation and integration of Tibet into the Republic of China.

The 9th Panchen Lama, Thubten Choekyi Nyima, was considered extremely &quot;pro-Chinese&quot;, according to official Chinese sources.

==== Mongols ====
Many of the Chinese troops used to occupy Mongolia in 1919 were Chahar Mongols, which has been a major cause for animosity between Khalkhas and Inner Mongols.

==== Manchus ====
In the late Qing Dynasty, revolutionaries incited anti-Manchuism to overthrow the Qing dynasty, especially Zou Rong.

A controversial topic of Chinese history is debating the extent to which the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty and the Manchu-led Qing dynasty represented China as a nation, due to the non-Han identity of the ruling dynasties.

==In Taiwan==

One common goal of current Chinese government is the unification of mainland China and Taiwan. While this was the commonly stated goal of both the People&#x27;s Republic of China and the Republic of China (Taiwan) before 1992, both sides differed sharply in the form of unification due to differences in political ideology. Taiwan&#x27;s Chinese nationalists mainly support the legitimacy of the Republic of China (see Pan-Blue Coalition), but there are also nationalists who support the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

In Taiwan, there is a general consensus to support the status quo of Taiwan&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; independence as a separate nation. Despite this, the relationship between Chinese nationalism and Taiwan remains controversial, involving symbolic issues such as the use of the &quot;Republic of China&quot; as the official name of the government on Taiwan and the use of the word &quot;China&quot; in the name of government-owned corporations. There is little support in Taiwan for immediate unification. Overt support for formal independence is also muted due to the PRC&#x27;s insistence on military action should Taiwan make such a formal declaration. The argument against unification is partly over culture and whether democratic Taiwanese should see themselves as Chinese or Taiwanese; and partly over mistrust of the authoritarian Chinese Communist Party (CCP), its human rights record, and its de-democratizing actions in Hong Kong (e.g. 2014–2015 Hong Kong electoral reform, which sparked the Umbrella Movement).

These misgivings are particularly prevalent among younger generations of Taiwanese, who generally consider themselves to have little or no connection to China.

There are ultranationalist groups in Taiwan that support unification with China. Some radical Chinese nationalist groups in Taiwan include the Patriot Alliance Association founded in 1993 and the Chinese Unification Promotion Party founded by Taiwanese mafia leader Chang An-lo. The former has engaged in combating the influence of Falun Gong in Taiwan, while the latter has been accused of violence against Hong Kong opposition figures such as Denise Ho and Lam Wing-kee.

==Nationalist symbology==
 In addition to the national symbols of China, the national symbols of the Republic of China, and the flags of China, there are many symbols opted for use by Chinese nationalists. Some of these include Chinese legendary or ancient figures such as the Yellow Emperor and the Fire Emperor, Yu the Great, Qin Shi Huang, or more modern figures such as Sun Yat-sen, Chiang Kai-shek, or Mao Zedong. Another symbol often used is the Chinese dragon as a personification for the Chinese nation.
Militaristic forms of Chinese nationalism have also embraced martyrs&#x27; shrines, which memorialise and praise martyrs (typically Chinese soldiers) who fought for China, such as in the Second Sino-Japanese War. Soldiers and other war heroes of China (both ROC and PRC) are enshrined at these shrines. The martyrs&#x27; shrines are the Chinese equivalent to the Japanese Gokoku shrines, such as Yasukuni Shrine.
Similar to the use of the chrysanthemum (which also has cultural significance in China) in Japan as the Imperial Seal of Japan, the plum blossom is also a national symbol of China, designated by the Legislative Yuan in the Republic of China on 21 July 1964. It was also proposed to be the national flower of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The Republic of China patriotic song The Plum Blossom revolves around its symbolism for China.

In the Republic of China, as the National Flower, the plum blossom symbolises:
* Three buds and five petals – symbolises Three Principles of the People and the five branches of the Government in accordance with the Constitution
* The plum blossom withstands the cold winter (it blossoms more in colder temperatures) – it symbolises the faithful, the resolute and the holy; it represents the national spirit of Republic of China nationals.
* The five petals of the flower – symbolises Five Races Under One Union; it also symbolises Five Cardinal Relationships (&quot;Wǔlún&quot;), Five Constants (&quot;Wǔcháng&quot;) and Five Ethics (Wǔjiào) according to Confucian philosophy (national philosophy of imperial China for two millennia until 1912, when the Qing Dynasty was overthrown and the Republic of China was established)
*The branches (枝橫), shadow (影斜), flexibility (曳疏), and cold resistance (傲霜) of the plum blossom also represent the four kinds of noble virtues, &quot;originating and penetrating, advantageous and firm&quot; mentioned in the &quot;I Ching (Book of Changes)&quot;.

==Opposition==
There are movements for regional secession from China and independence for Taiwan.

The Milk Tea Alliance formed by netizens from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Thailand began as a reaction against Chinese nationalist commentators online.

Elements of Japanese nationalism are hostile to China. In World War II, the Empire of Japan conquered large swathes of Chinese territory, and many contemporary nationalists in Japan deny the events of the Nanking Massacre.

==Types of Chinese nationalism==
===Populist nationalism===
Populist nationalism or popular nationalism () is a comparatively late development in Chinese nationalism of the 1990s. It began to take recognizable shape after 1996, as a joint result of the evolving nationalist thinking of the early 1990s and the ongoing debates on modernity, postmodernism, postcolonialism, and their political implications-debates that have engaged many Chinese intellectuals since early 1995.

===State nationalism===
State nationalism, state-led nationalism or simply &quot;statism&quot; is nationalism from above, in contrast to popular nationalism. State nationalism was strongly advocated by incumbent political elites in both the regimes of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP); past KMT or present CCP-led state nationalism advocates Chinese nationalism and equates &#x27;nation&#x27;/&#x27;state&#x27; (國家) and &#x27;party&#x27; (黨) to build a one-party system. State nationalism has not made the PRC s international behaviour particularly aggressive or inflexible, according to most observers, but rather cautious and opportunistic. Academic Frances Yaping Wang states that &quot;[i]f we liken nationalism to a pet dragon under the control of state authorities in China, we could say that the state keeps it alive and occasionally provokes it, as long as it does not breathe fire. However, when it does and oversteps its bounds occasionally, the state master reins it in to ensure the flames do not harm them.&quot;

A feature of Chinese state nationalism in the PRC is that it is CCP-centred; it regards the party as an embodiment of the nation&#x27;s will and the nation as a means rather than an end in itself. Accordingly, its primary objective is &#x27;stability&#x27; for the party-state, even though it is keen to maintain national identity, national unity and national autonomy.

A group of Chinese &quot;statist&quot; legal scholars is influencing the authoritarian policies of the Chinese government, which, influenced by ultraconservative and Nazi German legal theorist Carl Schmitt, values &#x27;state authority&#x27;; these statists are also related to the Chinese government&#x27;s reduction of autonomy over Hong Kong.

Hong Kong and Taiwanese nationalists who are critical of Chinese nationalism are especially critical of Chinese state nationalism.

===Ethnic nationalism===

Ethnic nationalism () is divided into two forms in China; based on the dominant ethnic-centered &quot;Han nationalism&quot; (or Han chauvinism) and ethnic minorities based &quot;local ethnic nationalism&quot;. The PRC government and Chinese Communist Party (CCP) opposes these singular ethnic nationalism and encourages multi-ethnic nationalism (more akin to civic nationalism). However, the CCP portrays itself as the custodian of a conservative, Han-centric vision of &quot;China&#x27;s outstanding traditional culture&quot;.

The Chinese government has also pursued ethno-nationalist policies aimed at appealing to overseas Chinese.

===Northern and Southern===

American scholar Edward Friedman has argued that there is a northern governmental, political, bureaucratic Chinese nationalism that is at odds with a southern, commercial Chinese nationalism.

===Ultranationalism===

Ultranationalism () was born out of Chiang Kai-shek Thought and pro-Chiang Blue Shirts Society during the Nationalist government, which had fascist tendencies and influences. Led by Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s Kuomintang, China had friendly diplomatic relations with Nazi Germany, until the Second Sino-Japanese War when Germany eventually favoured Japan diplomatically.

Since Xi Jinping took power, the Chinese Communist Party has been suspected of cultivating far-right ultranationalism.

==Modern times==

During the Cold War era, American strategies to contain the spread of communism fueled nationalist sentiment in China, including as a result of the Korean War, the Taiwan Strait Crisis, the PRC&#x27;s exclusion from the United Nations, and the U.S. embargo of China.

The end of the Cold War has seen the revival throughout the world of nationalist sentiments and aspirations, nationalism is seen as increasing the legitimacy of Chinese Communist Party rule. It has been pursued in a more pragmatic and flexible manner compared to policies during the Cultural Revolution. One remarkable phenomenon in the post-Cold War upsurge of Chinese nationalism is that Chinese intellectuals became one of the driving forces. Many well-educated people-social scientists, humanities scholars, writers, and other professionals have given voice to and even become articulators for rising nationalistic discourse in the 1990s. Some commentators have proposed that &quot;positive nationalism&quot; could be an important unifying factor for the country as it has been for other countries.
On 7 May 1999, during NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, the United States bombed the Chinese embassy in Belgrade killing three Chinese citizens. The US claimed that the bombing was an accident caused by the use of outdated maps but few Chinese accepted this explanation. The incident caused widespread anger and following the attack Chinese officials described the bombing as a &quot;barbarian act&quot; and a &quot;war crime&quot; while Chinese students in Europe and America demonstrated against &#x27;NATO fascism&#x27;. In China thousands were involved in protest marches in Beijing and other provincial capitals, some protesters threw gas bombs and rocks at the diplomatic missions of the United States and other NATO countries while in Chengdu the American Consul&#x27;s residence was firebombed, deepening anti-Western and anti-American sentiment in China. China, along with Russia, had already supported Slobodan Milošević and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia during the Kosovo War, and opposed NATO bombardment of Yugoslavia.

The 1995 book &quot;China Can Say No&quot; was a benchmark for 1990s nationalist sentiment. Nationalist online forums including Strong China Forum and Iron Blood became popular forums for expression of nationalist sentiment on the internet. The internet has since continued to increase in significance as a forum for Chinese nationalism.
In the 21st century, notable spurs of grassroots Chinese nationalism grew from what the Chinese public saw as the marginalization of their country from Japan and the Western world. One such event occurred in the Hainan Island incident of April 1, 2001, in which a United States US EP-3 surveillance aircraft collided mid-air with a Chinese Shenyang J-8 jet fighter over the South China Sea. China sought a formal apology, and President Jiang Zemin accepted United States Secretary of State Colin Powell&#x27;s expression of &quot;very sorry&quot; as sufficient. The incident nonetheless created negative feelings towards the United States by the Chinese public and increased public feelings of Chinese nationalism.

The Japanese history textbook controversies, as well as Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi&#x27;s visits to the Yasukuni Shrine was the source of considerable anger on Chinese blogs. In addition, the protests following the 2008 Tibetan unrest of the Olympic torch has gathered strong opposition within the Chinese community inside China and abroad. Almost every Tibetan protest on the Olympic torch route was met with a considerable pro-China protest. Because the 2008 Summer Olympics were a major source of national pride, anti-Olympics sentiments are often seen as anti-Chinese sentiments inside China. Moreover, the Sichuan earthquake in 2008 sparked a high sense of nationalism from the Chinese at home and abroad. The central government&#x27;s quick response to the disaster was instrumental in galvanizing general support from the population amidst harsh criticism directed towards China&#x27;s handling of the Lhasa riots only two months previously. In 2005, anti-Japanese demonstrations were held throughout Asia as a result of events such as the Japanese history textbook controversies. In 2012, Chinese people in mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan held anti-Japanese protests due to the escalating Senkaku Islands dispute.

Nationalism was witnessed at the 2008 Olympic torch relay where pro-Olympic protests were held by overseas Chinese in response to disruptions by anti-China activists in Paris and London. At least 5,000 Chinese Americans including immigrants from mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Southeast Asia also protested outside CNN&#x27;s Hollywood offices after CNN commentator Jack Cafferty described Chinese products as &quot;junk&quot; and the Chinese as “goons” and “thugs” during a segment about China&#x27;s relationship with America. When the Olympic torch passed through Paris, a pro-Tibetan independence protestor attempted to snatch it from a young handicapped Chinese athlete who clung to it. The images were widely televised and led to an internet rumor that accused French supermarket company Carrefour of funding Tibetan independence groups. Protests and calls for boycott resulted and ultimately subsided, in part because of efforts by French officials to apologize for the Paris torch attack.

A 2013 survey of Chinese adults found that respondents who sourced their information about the dispute from traditional mass media (which are more subject to state regulation) were less supportive of the idea that China should adopt hardline policies in the South China Sea territorial disputes. The researchers who conducted the survey concluded that China&#x27;s state-media coverage of the dispute was &quot;more of a dampener than a driver of nationalistic policy preference.&quot;

Another example of modern nationalism in China is the Hanfu movement, which is a Chinese movement in the early 21st century that seeks the revival of Chinese traditional clothing.

The China–United States trade war also fueled nationalist sentiment among both CCP leadership and the general public. The external pressure of the trade war allowed Xi Jinping to point to the United States&#x27; actions as a reason for China&#x27;s economic slowdown. The Chinese public responded. Academic Suisheng Zhao summarizes, &quot;Proud of their accomplishments through hard work, tremendous sacrifices, dogged determination, and well-crafted policies, many Chinese are fed up with US criticisms that China&#x27;s rise is because it did not play by rules, violated international commitments, and tilted the playing field to advantage Chinese firms.&quot;

Credit Suisse has determined through a 2018 survey that young Chinese consumers are turning to local brands as a result of growing nationalism. Local brands like Lenovo have also received backlash from some online Chinese for being unpatriotic.

On 1 July 2021, Xi Jinping delivered a nationalistic speech at Tiananmen Square in connection with the celebration of the 100th Anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party. Xi said, &quot;The Chinese people will never allow foreign forces to bully, oppress, or enslave us,&quot; and &quot;whoever nurses delusions of doing that will on the Great Wall of steel built from the flesh and blood of 1.4 billion Chinese people.&quot;.

In 2021 Hannah Bailey, a researcher of Chinese internet censorship at the University of Oxford&#x27;s Internet Institute, noted a shift in China&#x27;s approach toward deriving legitimacy from nationalism, compared to the earlier approach based on its economic performance.

===Internet activism===
In the 1990s, nationalists among the Chinese public were primarily connected through the internet.

In 2005, twenty-two million Chinese netizens signed an internet petition in opposition to Japan&#x27;s efforts to join the United Nations Security Council.

In response to protests during the 2008 Olympic Torch Relay, the Chinese blogosphere became filled with nationalistic material, many of which highlighted perceived biases and inaccuracies in Western media such as photos of clashes between police and Tibetan independence protestors that took place in Nepal and India but captioned to seem as if the events happened in China. Student-founded website Anti-CNN claimed that news channels such as CNN and BBC pushed false narratives and only reported selectively in the 2008 Tibetan unrest.

Chinese hackers have claimed to have attacked the CNN website numerous times, through the use of DDoS attacks. Similarly, the Yasukuni Shrine website was hacked by Chinese hackers during late 2004, and another time on 24 December 2008.

During the 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests, in response to protestors doxing police officers and people unsupportive of the protests, some Chinese nationalists in Hong Kong responded by doxing protestors.

During the Russo-Ukrainian War (in particular the Russian invasion of Ukraine), nationalistic netizens disseminated pro-Russian sentiments and posted pro-Russian posts across the Chinese internet. Online representations of Russian women across the Chinese internet have been described as gendered nationalism or nationalistic sexism. Chinese nationalists and Russian nationalists share common anti-Western sentiments.

===Xi Jinping and the &quot;Chinese Dream&quot;===

As Xi Jinping solidified his control after 2012, became the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, the CCP has used the phrase &quot;Chinese Dream&quot;, to describe his overarching plans for China. Xi first used the phrase during a high-profile visit to the National Museum of China on 29 November 2012, where he and his Standing Committee colleagues were attending a &quot;national revival&quot; (民族复兴; more commonly translated &quot;national rejuvenation&quot; to differentiate from national awakening) exhibition. Since then, the phrase has become the signature political slogan of the Xi era. In the public media, the Chinese Dream and nationalism are interwoven. In diplomacy, the Chinese dream and nationalism have been closely linked to the Belt and Road Initiative. Peter Ferdinand argues that it thus becomes a dream about a future in which China &quot;will have recovered its rightful place.&quot;

<text>Hildesheim is a district (&quot;Landkreis&quot;) in Lower Saxony, Germany. It is bounded by (from the north and clockwise) the districts of Hanover, Peine, Wolfenbüttel, Goslar, Northeim, Holzminden and Hameln-Pyrmont.

==History==
In 1885 the Prussian government established districts within the Province of Hanover. The present territory of the district was occupied by four districts: Hildesheim, Alfeld, Gronau and Marienburg. In 1932 the district of Gronau joined Alfeld, and the number of districts was reduced to three.

When the state of Lower Saxony was founded in 1946, the districts were reorganised: Hildesheim became an urban district, the remaining district of Hildesheim and Marienburg were merged to the new district of Hildesheim-Marienburg. The district of Alfeld remained in its former borders.

In 1974 the city of Hildesheim lost its status as an urban district and became part of the surrounding district, which was renamed to Hildesheim. The districts of Hildesheim and Alfeld were merged in 1977.

==Geography==
The district is located southeast of Hanover, and the northernmost parts border the Hanover metropolitan area. The northern half of the district is highly urbanised, while the south is covered with forests. The River Leine enters the district in the south, runs through the towns of Alfeld and Gronau and leaves in the northwest towards Hanover; a small affluent, the Innerste, joins the Leine from the east after flowing through the city of Hildesheim. Between Leine and Innerste there are the forested hill chains of the Hildesheim Forest (&quot;Hildesheimer Wald&quot;) and the Sieben Berge (&quot;Seven Hills&quot;, see Alfeld for more details).

==Coat of arms==

The coat of arms displays:
* the eagle from the arms of the city of Hildesheim
* the deer antler, taken from the former district of Alfeld, represents the Germanic tribe of the Cherusci (=&quot;deer&quot;)
* the rose stands for Hildesheim&#x27;s Thousand-year Rose at St. Mary&#x27;s Cathedral

<doc id="153226" wikidata="Q2896313" url="?curid=153226" title="2002 Mombasa attacks">
<text>The 2002 Mombasa attacks were a two-pronged terrorist attack on 28 November 2002 in Mombasa, Kenya against an Israeli-owned hotel and a plane belonging to Arkia Airlines. An all-terrain vehicle crashed through a barrier outside the Paradise Hotel and blew up, killing 13 and injuring 80. At the same time, attackers fired two surface-to-air missiles at an Israeli charter plane. The Paradise Hotel was the only Israeli-owned hotel in the Mombasa area. The attacks were believed to be orchestrated by al-Qaeda operatives in Somalia in an attempt to disrupt the Israeli tourist industry on the African continent. Much speculation has occurred as to who the perpetrators are, but no complete list of suspects has been defined. The attack was the second al-Qaeda terrorist operation in Kenya, following the bombing of the U.S. embassy in Nairobi in 1998. Following the attack, the UN Security Council and other nations condemned the bombing.

== Attacks ==

=== Hotel bombing ===
Three men approached the gate of the Paradise Hotel in a Mitsubishi Pajero and were questioned by security guards. One of the men exited the car and detonated his explosive vest. The other two men rammed through the barrier, crashing into the front entrance of the hotel and set off a bomb in the vehicle. The blast occurred on the eve of Hanukkah, just after 60 Israeli visitors had checked into the hotel for a holiday stay. The explosion killed 13 people, including ten Kenyans and three Israelis, and injured 80. Nine of the victims were dancers who had been employed to welcome hotel guests. In an overnight rescue mission, four Lockheed C-130 Hercules operated by the Israeli Air Force were sent to Mombasa to evacuate the dead and injured.

=== Aircraft attack ===

Almost simultaneous to the attack on the hotel, two shoulder-launched Strela 2 (SA-7) surface-to-air missiles were fired at a chartered Boeing 757 owned by Israel-based Arkia Airlines as it took off from Moi International Airport. The Arkia charter company had a regular weekly service flying tourists between Tel Aviv and Mombasa. Kenyan police discovered a missile launcher and two missile casings in the Changamwe area of Mombasa about from the airport. The pilots planned on an emergency landing in Nairobi after seeing the two missiles streak past them, but decided to continue to Israel. The airliner landed at Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv about five hours later, escorted by Israeli F-15 fighter jets. Following the attack, all flights from Israel to Kenya were cancelled indefinitely.

==Perpetrators==
Sheikh Omar Bakri Mohammed, leader of the London-based Islamic organisation Al Muhajiroun, said that warnings had appeared on the Internet. &quot;Militant groups who sympathise with Al-Qaeda warned one week ago that there would be an attack on Kenya and they mentioned Israelis,&quot; he said. Initially, Israeli government spokesmen denied that such a warning had been received. But four days after the blast, Brigadier-General Yossi Kuperwasser admitted that Israeli military intelligence were aware of a threat in Kenya, but that it was not specific enough. Former Mossad head Danny Yatom took a similar line, saying that Israel got so many terror warnings they were not taken seriously.

In Lebanon, a previously unknown group called the Army of Palestine has said it carried out the attacks and said it wanted the world to hear the &quot;voice of the refugees&quot; on the 55th anniversary of the partition of Palestine.

On 20 December 2006, Salad Ali Jelle, Defence Minister of Somalia&#x27;s Transitional Federal Government, said that one of the suspects, Abu Talha al-Sudani, was an Islamic Courts Union leader fighting against the Transitional Federal Government in the 2006 Battle of Baidoa. On 14 September 2009, American troops killed Kenya-born Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan after a missile struck his car in the Barawe District, 250 kilometers south of Somalia&#x27;s capital Mogadishu. Nabhan is believed to have bought the truck used in the 2002 bombing.

Fazul Abdullah Mohammed was a foreign leader of the jihadist fundamentalist group, Al-Shabaab, which has pledged allegiance to al-Qaeda. Mohammed was appointed leader of al-Qaeda operations in East Africa. He was a participating member of the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombing in Nairobi and was one of the masterminds behind the coordination of the attack in Mombasa. He saw the attack as a failure because of the Strela 2 missiles missing the plane during takeoff.

Mohammed Abdul Malik Bajabu confessed in 2007 to assisting in the car bombings that took place at The Paradise Hotel. He was arrested by Kenyan authorities and was imprisoned by the U.S. in Guantanamo Bay without any formal charges against him. There have been four other suspected attackers affiliated with the al-Qaeda cell in Kenya, but the Kenyan prosecutors have had trouble establishing guilt with certainty. The four Kenyan nationals have been acquitted for lack of evidence.

There also has been speculation of involvement by Somali terrorist organization known as, Al Ittihad al Islamiya (AIAI). AIAI has supposed ties with al-Qaeda. They had hoped that by sending a message to the Israelis through this attack, they would grow closer to achieving their goal of establishing a Somali Islamic state.

However, a former Israeli Intelligence official accused Abdullah Ahmed Abdullah, known as Abu Mohammed al-Masri, of ordering the Mombasa attacks.

=== Motivation ===
It is believed that the terrorist cell al-Qaeda sought out to severely diminish Israeli activities on the African continent. The two simultaneous attacks had a direct impact on the Israeli tourism industry. The Paradise Hotel was an Israeli-owned beachfront property that many Israeli vacationers frequented. The Al-Shabaab militant group is concentrated in Somalia, but because of weak border security, its members often enter Kenya. Kenya has a minority Muslim population that has historically been alienated, and with a growing dissent for Western activities regarding Kenyan borders, it has enabled a growing number of jihadist Muslims into Nairobi. The Muslim community in Kenya had lost political and economic representation leading up to the attacks, which led them to focus their loyalty on Islam and the Middle East, not Kenya. This enabled the jihadist movement to acquire a strong grip within Kenya, as Kenyan nationals assisted in the attacks on the Paradise Hotel and on the Boeing 757.

==International response==
Immediately following the attacks, Israel began evacuating all Israeli citizens within Kenyan borders. A joint operation began between the United States and Israel in determining who the perpetrators were of the attack. President George W Bush and Secretary of State Colin Powell of the United States, Israel&#x27;s Foreign Minister Benyamin Netanyahu, the Kenyan government, and United Kingdom Foreign Secretary Jack Straw all condemned the attack. The United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 1450 condemning the attacks, Syria was the only country to not affirm the resolution due to the implied power of directly intervening in the affected country&#x27;s internal affairs after a terrorist attack. They also found distaste with the repeated mention of Israel in the resolution, which was against their political view concerning the conflict in the Middle East between Israel and Palestine.

=== Investigation ===
As a result of the U.S. embassy bombing in 1998 and the attacks in Mombasa, Kenya-U.S. cooperation between authorities has strengthened. It was a joint effort between Kenya, the U.S., and Israel to apprehend the attackers. They were able to determine that al-Qaeda operatives were behind the attacks due to the similarities between the incidents in Nairobi and Mombasa. The attackers had used car bombs sourced from local materials. To plan and coordinate the attacks, al-Qaeda operatives rented houses in affluent neighborhoods to meet up with the non-Kenyan suicide bombers.

==== Aftermath ====
In 2003 Western countries advised all of their citizens against traveling to Kenya because of the terrorist threat. This negatively impacted Kenya&#x27;s economy which was based mostly in the tourism industry. Following the advisories and the suspension of British Airways flights to Nairobi, the Kenyan economy began losing nearly $130 million per week.

<doc id="153227" wikidata="Q156878" url="?curid=153227" title="Heinkel He 162 Volksjäger">
<text>The Heinkel He 162 &quot;Volksjäger ([[German language|German]], &quot;People&#x27;s Fighter&quot;) is a German single-engine, jet-powered [[fighter aircraft]] fielded by the [[Luftwaffe]] late in [[World War II]]. Developed under the [[Emergency Fighter Program]], it was designed and built quickly and made primarily of wood as metals were in very short supply and prioritised for other aircraft. &quot;Volksjäger&quot; was the [[Reich Air Ministry]]&#x27;s official name for the government design program competition won by the He 162 design. Other names given to the plane include &quot;Salamander&quot;, which was the codename of its wing-construction program, and Spatz&quot; (&quot;Sparrow&quot;), which was the name given to the plane by the Heinkel aviation firm.

The aircraft was notable for its small size. It had a distinctive top-mounted engine which, combined with the aircraft&#x27;s low landing gear, allowed the engine to be easily accessed for maintenance. This made bailing out of the aircraft without hitting the engine difficult, and the He 162 was the first single-engine aircraft provided with an ejection seat in an operational setting. The small size left little room for fuel, which combined with the inefficient engine resulted in very low endurance - in the order of 20 minutes - and it only had room for two autocannon, making it relatively underarmed for the era.

A series of fatal accidents during testing required a series of refinements that delayed the program. Although production lines were set up and deliveries began in early 1945, the impending defeat of Germany by that time made the effort pointless. Of nearly 1,000 aircraft on the assembly lines, only about 120 were delivered to the airfields and most of those never flew, usually due to shortages of parts, fuel, and pilots. Small numbers were used in development squadrons and these ultimately saw combat in a few cases during April 1945, yet the He 162 also proved to be quite dangerous to its own pilots as its tiny fuel load led to a number of aircraft crashing off field, while additional losses were attributed to structural failure.

Production was still running when the war ended in May 1945. Numerous aircraft were captured by the Allied forces along with ample supplies of parts from the production lines. Eric Brown flew one just after the war and considered it a first-rate aircraft with few vices. Several He 162s have been preserved in museum collections around the world.

==Development==
===State of the Luftwaffe fighter arm===
Through 1943, the U.S. Eighth Air Force (8AF) and German &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; entered a period of rapid evolution as both forces attempted to gain an advantage. Having lost too many fighters to the bombers&#x27; defensive guns, the Germans invested in a series of heavy weapons that allowed them to attack from outside the American machine guns&#x27; effective range. The addition of the 30mm calibre MK 108, and even heavier &quot;Bordkanone&quot; autoloading weapons in 37mm and 50mm calibres on their &quot;Zerstörer&quot; heavy fighters, and the adoption in spring 1943 of the &quot;Werfer-Granate 21&quot; unguided rockets, gave the German single and twin-engined defensive fighters a degree of firepower never seen previously by Allied fliers. Meanwhile, single-engine aircraft like specially equipped Fw 190As added armor to protect their pilots from Allied bombers&#x27; defensive fire, allowing them to approach to distances where their heavy weapons could be used with some chance of hitting the bombers. All of this added greatly to the weight being carried by both the single and twin-engine fighters, seriously affecting their performance.

In early 1944, the 8AF re-opened its bombing campaign with the Big Week offensive in conjunction with the RAF, to force a decisive battle with Luftwaffe by attacking German aircraft production and so achieve Allied air superiority over Europe. The bombers returned to the skies with the long-range North American P-51 Mustang escort fighters progressively replacing Republic P-47 Thunderbolts and Lockheed P-38 Lightnings. Unencumbered with the heavy weapons needed to down a bomber, the Mustangs (and longer-ranged versions of other aircraft) were able to fend off the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; with relative ease. The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; responded by changing tactics, forming in front of the bombers and making a single pass through the formations, giving the defense little time to react. Major General Jimmy Doolittle, commander of 8AF, had changed policy in January 1944; rather than forcing escorts to stay with the bomber formations, they were free to fly ahead of the bomber formations and roam freely over Germany to hit the Luftwaffe&#x27;s defensive fighters wherever they could be found.

This change in tactics resulted in a sudden increase in the rate of irreplaceable losses to the Luftwaffe day fighter force, as their heavily laden aircraft were &quot;bounced&quot; long before reaching the bombers. Within weeks, many of their aces were dead, along with hundreds of other pilots, and the training program could not replace their casualties quickly enough. The Luftwaffe were able to put up little fight during the summer of 1944, allowing the Allied landings in France to go almost unopposed from the air. With few planes coming up to fight, Allied fighters were let loose on the German airbases, railways and truck traffic. Logistics soon became a serious problem for the Luftwaffe, as maintaining aircraft in fighting condition became almost impossible. Getting enough fuel was even more difficult because of a devastating campaign against German petroleum industry targets.

===Origins===
Addressing this posed a considerable problem for the Luftwaffe. Two camps quickly developed, both demanding the immediate introduction of large numbers of jet fighter aircraft. One group, led by General Adolf Galland, the Inspector of Fighters, reasoned that superior numbers had to be countered with superior technology, and demanded that all possible effort be put into increasing the production of the jet powered Messerschmitt Me 262 in its A-1a fighter version, even if that meant reducing production of other aircraft in the meantime.

The second group pointed out that this would likely do little to address the problem; the Me 262 had notoriously unreliable Jumo 004 jet engines and landing gear, and the existing logistics problems would mean there would merely be more of them on the ground waiting for parts that would never arrive, or for fuel that was not available. Instead, they suggested that a new design be built – one so inexpensive that if a machine was damaged or worn out, it could simply be discarded and replaced with a fresh plane straight off the assembly line. Thus was born the concept of the &quot;throwaway fighter&quot;.

Galland and several other Luftwaffe senior officers expressed their vehement opposition to this light fighter concept, while head of the Luftwaffe &quot;Reichsmarschall&quot; Hermann Göring and Armaments Minister Albert Speer fully supported the idea. Göring and Speer got their way; accordingly, a contract tender to supply a single-engine jet fighter that was suited for cheap and rapid mass production was established under the name &quot;Volksjäger&quot; (&quot;People&#x27;s Fighter&quot;).

===Volksjäger===

The official RLM &quot;Volksjäger&quot; design competition parameters specified a single-seat fighter, powered by a single BMW 003 turbojet, a slightly lower-thrust engine not in demand for either the Me 262 or the Arado Ar 234 jet bomber, already in service. The main structure of the &quot;Volksjäger&quot; competing airframe designs would use cheap and unsophisticated parts made of wood and other non-strategic materials and, more importantly, could be assembled by semi- and non-skilled labor, including slave labor.

The specification stipulated various performance requirements, including a maximum weight of , a maximum speed of 750 km/h (470 mph) at sea level, an operational endurance of at least a half hour, while the takeoff distance was to be no greater than 500 m (1,640 ft). Provisions for armour plating in areas such as the fuel tanks and around the pilot were also to be made, however, manufacturers were also asked to provide detail on the aircraft&#x27;s performance both with and without armour installed. The armament was specified as either a pair of MG 151/20 cannon with 100 rounds each, or two MK 108 cannon with 50 rounds each.

Furthermore, the &quot;Volksjäger&quot; needed to be easy to fly. Some officials, such as Artur Axmann and Karl Saur, suggested even glider or student pilots should be able to fly the jet effectively in combat and, had the &quot;Volksjäger&quot; achieved widespread use, this would have been a likely occurrence. After the war, Ernst Heinkel said, &quot;[The] unrealistic notion that this plane should be a &#x27;people&#x27;s fighter,&#x27; in which the Hitler Youth, after a short training regimen with clipped-wing two-seater gliders like the DFS &quot;Stummel-Habicht&quot;, could fly for the defense of Germany, displayed the unbalanced fanaticism of those days.&quot; The clipped-wingspan DFS Habicht models had varying wingspans of both or , and were used to prepare more experienced &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; pilots for the dangerous Me 163B &quot;Komet&quot; rocket fighter – the same sort of training approach would also be used for the Hitler Youth aviators chosen to fly the &quot;Volksjäger&quot;.

On 8 September 1944, the requirement was issued to industry; bidders were required to submit their basic designs within ten days while quantity production of the aircraft was to commence by 1 January 1945. Because the winner of the new lightweight fighter design competition would be building huge numbers of the planes, nearly every German aircraft manufacturer expressed interest in the project, such as Blohm &amp; Voss, and Focke-Wulf, whose Focke-Wulf Volksjäger 1 design contender, likewise meant for BMW 003 turbojet power bore a resemblance to their slightly later Ta 183 &quot;Huckebein&quot; jet fighter design. However, Heinkel had already been working on a series of &quot;paper projects&quot; for light twin-engine fighters over the last year under the designation P.1073, with most design work being completed by Professor Benz, and had gone so far as to build and test several models and conduct some wind tunnel testing.

As Heinkel had a head start on its design, some officials believed that the outcome was a largely foregone conclusion. Nevertheless, many companies opted to produce responses; some of these competing designs were technically superior (in particular to the Blohm &amp; Voss P 211 proposal). Messerschmitt did not submit any design, the company&#x27;s founder, Willy Messerschmitt, dismissed the &quot;Volksjäger&quot; concept to be a delusional failure. During October 1944, the competition&#x27;s results were announced, only three weeks following the requirement being issued; to little surprise, Heinkel&#x27;s submission was selected for production. In order to confuse Allied intelligence, the RLM chose to reuse the 8-162 airframe designation (formerly that of a Messerschmitt Bf 162 fast bomber); Heinkel had reportedly requested another designation, &quot;He 500&quot;, for the aircraft.

==Design==

Heinkel had carried out some design work of a new twin-engine fighter with one engine placed on top of the aircraft and another under the nose, the highest point on the bottom of the fuselage. For the single-engine development, he removed the lower engine and repositioned the remaining upper engine just aft of the cockpit and centered directly over the wing&#x27;s center section. This arrangement simplified the overall balance of the aircraft, while also placing the engine in a convenient point for removal as it could be removed upward with a small crane. The need for a crane to be present at every airfield that the aircraft would operate from was a point of contention of the aircraft from Heinkel&#x27;s rivals.

One consequence of the aircraft&#x27;s basic configuration was that the jet exhaust would pass directly over the upper rear fuselage and the tail area. For this reason, the tail was constructed with two small vertical stabilizers positioned to either side of the exhaust&#x27;s path, and the horizontal elevator mounted below it. The horizontal section had considerable dihedral at 14º, raising the vertical stabilizers inline with the wing.

The aircraft&#x27;s relatively compact wing was mounted relatively high on the fuselage and was attached using four bolts. The leading edge was straight while the trailing edge had a significant forward sweep. It was not possible to remove the wing without first removing the engine, an arrangement that would have hindered routine maintenance of the aircraft. The combination of the engine being directly above the pilot and the wings on either side would make a conventional bailout very risky, so the aircraft was designed from the start to feature an ejection seat akin to the one used in the Heinkel He 219 night fighter.

The main landing gear retracted into the fuselage below the wing and were of the tricycle layout. Heinkel had significant previous experience with this layout on earlier designs including the Heinkel He 280, however, this was the first of their designs to use this layout from the start. A small window in the lower cockpit between the rudder pedals allowed the pilot to visually check whether the gear was down. Partly due to the late-war period it was designed within, some of the He 162&#x27;s landing gear components were &quot;recycled&quot; existing landing gear components from a contemporary German military aircraft to save development time: the main landing gear&#x27;s oleo struts and wheel/brake units came from the Messerschmitt Bf 109K, as well as the double-acting hydraulic cylinders, one per side, used to raise and lower each maingear leg.

===Prototypes===
The He 162 V1 first prototype flew within an astoundingly short period of time: the design was chosen on 25 September 1944 and first flew on 6 December, less than 90 days later. This was despite the fact that the factory in Wuppertal making Tego film plywood glue — used in a substantial number of late-war German aviation designs whose airframes and/or major airframe components were meant to be constructed mostly from wood — had been bombed by the Royal Air Force and a replacement had to be quickly substituted, without realizing that the replacement adhesive was highly acidic and would disintegrate the wooden parts it was intended to be fastening.

The first flight of the He 162 V1, by &quot;Flugkapitän&quot; Gotthold Peter – the first German jet fighter aircraft design to be jet-powered from its maiden flight onward – was fairly successful, but during a high-speed run at 840 km/h (520 mph), the highly acidic replacement glue attaching the nose gear strut door failed and the pilot was forced to land. Other problems were noted as well, notably a pitch instability and problems with sideslip due to the rudder design. None were considered important enough to hold up the production schedule for even a day. On a second flight on 10 December, again with Peter at the controls, in front of various Nazi officials, the glue again caused a structural failure. This allowed the aileron to separate from the wing, causing the plane to roll over, it broke up in the air and crashed, killing Peter.

An investigation into the failure revealed that the wing structure had to be strengthened and some redesign was needed, as the glue bonding required for the wood parts was in many cases defective. However, the schedule was so tight that testing was forced to continue with the current design. Speeds were limited to 500 km/h (310 mph) when the second prototype flew on 22 December. This time, the stability problems proved to be more serious, and were found to be related to phenomenon known as Dutch roll.
While this tendency could be resolved by reducing the dihedral, however, as the He 162 was supposed to enter production within weeks, there was no time to implement major design changes. Instead, a number of small changes were made, such as the addition of lead ballast in the nose to move the centre of gravity towards the front of the aircraft while the tail surfaces were also slightly increased in size. Despite these measures, some figures, such as Alexander Lippisch, declared the flying characteristics of the He 162 to be unsuitable for inexperienced pilots.

The third and fourth prototypes, which used an &quot;M&quot; for &quot;Muster&quot; (model) number instead of &quot;V&quot; for &quot;Versuchs&quot; (experimental) number, as the He 162 M3 and M4, after being fitted with the strengthened wings, flew in mid-January 1945. These versions also included – as possibly the pioneering example of their use on a production-line, military jet aircraft – small, anhedraled aluminium &quot;drooped&quot; wingtips, reportedly designed by Alexander Lippisch and known in German as &quot;Lippisch-Ohren&quot; (&quot;Lippisch Ears&quot;), in an attempt to cure the stability problems via effectively &quot;decreasing&quot; the main wing panels&#x27; marked three degree dihedral angle. Both prototypes were equipped with two 30 mm (1.18 in) MK 108 cannon in the He 162 A-1 anti-bomber variant; in testing, the recoil from these guns proved to be too much for the lightweight fuselage to handle, and plans for production turned to the A-2 fighter with two 20 mm MG 151/20 cannon instead while a redesign for added strength started as the A-3. The shift to 20 mm guns was also undertaken because the smaller-calibre weapons would allow a much greater amount of ammunition to be carried.

The He 162 was originally built with the intention of being flown by the Hitler Youth, as the Luftwaffe was fast running out of pilots. However, the aircraft&#x27;s complexity required more experienced pilots. Both a standard-fuselage length, unarmed BMW 003E-powered two-seat version (with the rear pilot&#x27;s seat planned to have a ventral access hatch to access the cockpit) and an unpowered two-seat glider version, designated the He 162S (&quot;Schulen&quot;), were developed for training purposes. Only a small number were built, and even fewer delivered to the sole He 162 Hitler Youth training unit to be activated (in March 1945) at an airbase at Sagan. The unit was in the process of formation when the war ended, and did not begin any training; it is doubtful that more than one or two He 162S gliders ever took to the air.

Various changes had raised the weight over the original 2,000 kg (4,410 lb) limit, but even at 2,800 kg (6,170 lb), the He 162 was still among the fastest aircraft in the air with a maximum airspeed of at sea level and at , but could reach at sea level and at using short burst extra thrust. The short flight duration of barely 30 minutes was due to only having a single 695-litre (183 US gallon) capacity flexible-bladder fuel tank in the fuselage directly under the engine&#x27;s intake. The original &quot;Baubeschreibung&quot; document submittal for the He 162 dated mid-October 1944 showed a pair of fuel tanks for the original version of the &quot;Spatz&#x27;s&quot; airframe as-designed: a single, smaller capacity 640 litre (169 US gal) fuselage main tank in approximately the same location as the later 695 litre tank was placed, with an additional wing centre-section tank just above and behind it, never produced for the production run, of some 325 litres (86 US gal) feeding by gravity into the main fuselage tank. The A-2 version, in some examples (as the one flown by Royal Navy test pilot Captain Eric Brown postwar) had an emplacement of a pair of &quot;impregnated&quot; 180 litre (47.5 US gal) wing tanks, one built into each inner wing panel, within the first four wing ribs out from the root and between the spars, that fed into the main 695 litre fuselage tank in a similar manner to what the earlier 325 litre center-section tank had been proposed to do; but were themselves ungauged, their exhaustion of fuel only marked when the main fuel gauge began to fall during flight. The production He 162A-2 was armed with a pair of 20mm MG 151/20 cannon.

Multiple facilities were engaged in the production of the He 162, including the assembly lines in Salzburg, the Hinterbrühl, and the Mittelwerk. By April 1945, it had been anticipated that output would reach 1,000 aircraft per month, which was double the rate achieved when the Mittelwerk plant commenced deliveries. Furthermore, the Air Ministry expected that production were rise even beyond this figure in order to produce sufficient fighter coverage.

==Operational history==
During January 1945, the Luftwaffe formed an &quot;Erprobungskommando 162&quot; (&quot;Test Unit 162&quot;) evaluation group to which the first 46 aircraft were delivered. The group was based at the Luftwaffe main test center, or &quot;Erprobungsstelle&quot; at Rechlin.

In February, deliveries of the He 162 commenced to its first operational unit, I./JG 1 (1st Group of &quot;Jagdgeschwader&quot; 1 &quot;Oesau&quot; — &quot;1st Fighter Wing&quot;), which had previously flown the Focke-Wulf Fw 190A. I./JG 1 was transferred to Parchim, which, at the time, was also a base for the Me 262-equipped &quot;Jagdgeschwader&quot; 7, some 80 km south-southwest of the Heinkel factory&#x27;s coastal airfield at &quot;Marienehe&quot; (today known as Rostock-Schmarl, northwest of the Rostock city centre), where the pilots could pick up their new jets and start intensive training beginning in March 1945. This was all happening simultaneously with unrelenting Allied air attacks on the transportation network, aircraft production facilities and petroleum, oil, and lubrication (POL) product-making installations of the Third Reich – these had now begun to also target the Luftwaffe&#x27;s jet and rocket fighter bases as well. On 6 April, the USAAF bombed the field at Parchim with 134 Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses, inflicting serious losses and damage to the infrastructure. Two days later, I./JG 1 moved to an airfield at nearby Ludwigslust and, less than a week later, moved again to an airfield at Leck, near the Danish border. On 8 April, II./JG 1 moved to Heinkel&#x27;s aforementioned Rostock northwestern coastal suburban factory airfield and started converting from Fw 190As to He 162s. III./JG 1 was also scheduled to convert to the He 162, but the &quot;Gruppe&quot; disbanded on 24 April and its personnel were used to fill in the vacancies in other units.

The He 162 first saw combat in mid-April 1945. On 19 April, &quot;Feldwebel&quot; Günther Kirchner shot down a Royal Air Force fighter and, although the victory was credited to a flak unit, the British pilot confirmed during interrogation that he had been downed by an He 162. The Heinkel and its pilot were both lost that same day as well, having been shot down over Husum by Flying Officer Geoffrey Walkington, piloting an RAF Hawker Tempest. Though still in training, I./JG 1 began to score kills in mid-April, but went on to lose 13 He 162s and 10 pilots. Ten of the aircraft were operational losses, caused by flameouts and sporadic structural failures. Only two of the 13 aircraft were actually shot down. The He 162&#x27;s 30-minute fuel capacity also caused problems, as at least two of JG 1&#x27;s pilots were killed attempting emergency deadstick landings after exhausting their fuel.

During its exceedingly brief operational service career, the He 162&#x27;s cartridge-type ejector seat was employed under combat conditions by JG 1&#x27;s pilots at least four times. Kirchner had been the first to eject when he was attacked on April 19, but he was too low and was killed when his parachute failed to open. The second recorded use was by Lt Rudolf Schmidt on April 20, with Fw. Erwin Steeb ejecting from his He 162 the following day. Finally, Hptm. Paul-Heinrich Dähne attempted to eject from his aircraft on April 24, but was killed when the cockpit canopy failed to detach.


In the last days of April, as the Soviet troops approached, II./JG 1 evacuated from Marienehe and on 2 May joined the I./JG 1 at Leck. On 3 May, all of JG 1&#x27;s surviving He 162s were restructured into two groups, I. &quot;Einsatz&quot; (&quot;Combat&quot;) and II. &quot;Sammel&quot; (&quot;Collection&quot;). All JG 1&#x27;s aircraft were grounded on 5 May, when General Admiral Hans-Georg von Friedeburg signed the surrender of all German armed forces in the Netherlands, Northwest Germany and Denmark. On 6 May, when the British reached their airfields, JG 1 turned their He 162s over to the Allies. Numerous aircraft were shipped to the U.S., Britain, France, and the Soviet Union for further evaluation.

&quot;Erprobungskommando&quot; 162 fighters, which had been passed on to JV 44, an elite jet unit under Adolf Galland a few weeks earlier, were all destroyed by their crews to keep them from falling into Allied hands. Heinkel did not resort to such measures, the company&#x27;s engineers supplied the Americans with detailed designs for the He 162. 

The difficulties experienced by the He 162 are believed to have been primarily a result of its rush into production, rather than any inherent design flaw. One experienced &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; pilot who flew the He 162 called it a &quot;first-class combat aircraft.&quot; Test pilot Eric Brown of the Fleet Air Arm, who flew a record 486 different types of aircraft, said the He 162 had &quot;the lightest and most effective aerodynamically balanced controls&quot; he had experienced. Brown had been warned to treat the rudder with suspicion due to a number of in-flight failures. This warning was passed on by Brown to RAF pilot Flt Lt R A Marks, but was apparently not heeded. On 9 November 1945, during a demonstration flight from RAE Farnborough, one of the fin and rudder assemblies broke off at the start of a low-level roll causing the aircraft to crash into Oudenarde Barracks, Aldershot, killing Marks and a soldier on the ground.

==He 162 &quot;Mistel&quot;==
The Mistel series of fighter/powered bomb composite ground-attack aircraft pre-dated the He 162 by over two years, and the &quot;Mistel&quot; 5 project study in early 1945 proposed the mating of an He 162A-2 to the Arado E.377A flying bomb. The fighter would sit atop the bomb, which would itself be equipped with two underwing-mounted BMW 003 turbojets. This ungainly combination would take off on a sprung trolley fitted with tandem wheels on each side for the &quot;main gear&quot; equivalent, derived from that used on the first eight Arado Ar 234 prototypes, with all three jets running. Immediately after take-off, the trolley would be jettisoned, and the &quot;Mistel&quot; would then fly to within strike range of the designated target. Upon reaching this point, the bomb would be aimed squarely at the target and then released, with the jet turning back for home. The &quot;Mistel&quot; 5 remained a &quot;paper project&quot;, as the Arado bomb never progressed beyond the blueprint stage.

<doc id="153229" wikidata="Q591434" url="?curid=153229" title="Two-part tariff">
<text>A two-part tariff (TPT) is a form of price discrimination wherein the price of a product or service is composed of two parts – a lump-sum fee as well as a per-unit charge. In general, such a pricing technique only occurs in partially or fully monopolistic markets. It is designed to enable the firm to capture more consumer surplus than it otherwise would in a non-discriminating pricing environment. Two-part tariffs may also exist in competitive markets when consumers are uncertain about their ultimate demand. Health club consumers, for example, may be uncertain about their level of future commitment to an exercise regimen. Two-part tariffs are easy to implement when connection or entrance fees (first part) can be charged along with a price per unit consumed (second part).

Depending on the homogeneity of demand, the lump-sum fee charged varies, but the rational firm will set the per unit charge above or equal to the marginal cost of production, and below or equal to the price the firm would charge in a perfect monopoly. Under competition the per-unit price is set below marginal cost.

An important element to remember concerning two-part tariffs is that the product or service offered by the firm must be identical to all consumers, hence, price charged may vary, but &quot;not due to different costs borne by the firm&quot;, as this would imply a differentiated product. Thus, while credit cards which charge an annual fee plus a per-transaction fee is a good example of a two-part tariff, a fixed fee charged by a car rental company in addition to a per-kilometer fuel fee is not so good, because the fixed fee may reflect fixed costs such as registration and insurance which the firm must recoup in this manner. This can make the identification of two-part tariffs difficult.

==A two-part tariff when consumer demand is homogeneous==

When consumers have homogeneous demand, any one consumer is representative of the market (the market being n identical consumers). For purposes of demonstration, consider just one consumer who interacts with one firm which experiences fixed costs and constant costs per unit - hence the horizontal marginal cost (MC) line.

Recall that the demand curve represents our consumer&#x27;s maximum willingness to pay for any given output. Thus, as long as he receives an appropriate amount of goods, such as Qc, then he will be willing to pay his entire surplus (ABC) in addition to the cost per unit under perfect competition (Pc by Qc) - i.e. the entire area under the demand curve up to point Qc.

If the firm is perfectly competitive, it would charge price Pc and supply Qc to our consumer, making no economic profit but producing an allocatively efficient output. If the firm is a &quot;non-price discriminating&quot; monopolist, it would charge price Pm per unit and supply Qm, maximizing profit but producing below the allocatively efficient level of output Qc. This situation yields economic profit for the firm equal to the green area B, consumer surplus equal to the light blue area A, and a deadweight loss equal to the purple area C.

If the firm is a &quot;price discriminating&quot; monopolist, then it has the capacity to extract more resources from the consumer. It charges a lump sum fee, as well as a per-unit cost. In order to sell the maximum number of units, the firm must charge the perfectly competitive price per unit, Pc, because this is the only price at which Qc units can be sold (note this is also the marginal cost per unit). To make up for the lower cost per unit, the firm then imposes a fee upon our consumer equal to his consumer surplus, ABC.

The lump-sum fee enables the firm to capture all the consumer surplus and deadweight loss areas, resulting in higher profit than a non-price discriminating monopolist could manage. The result is a firm which is in a sense allocatively efficient (price per unit is equal to marginal cost, but total price is not) - one of the redeeming qualities of price discrimination. If there are multiple consumers with homogeneous demand, then profit will equal n times the area ABC, where n is the number of consumers.

==A two-part tariff when consumer demand is different==

We now consider the case where there are two consumers, X and Y. Consumer Y&#x27;s demand is exactly twice consumer X&#x27;s demand, and each of these consumers is represented by a separate demand curve, and their combined demand (Dmarket). The firm is the same as in the previous example. We assume that the firm &quot;cannot separately identify each consumer&quot; - it cannot therefore price discriminate against each of them individually.

The firm would like to follow the same logic as before and charge a per-unit price of Pc while imposing a lump-sum fee equal to area ABCD - the largest consumer surplus of the two consumers. In so doing, however, the firm will be pricing consumer X out of the market, because the lump-sum fee far exceeds his own consumer surplus of area AC. Nevertheless, this would still yield profit equal ABCD from consumer Y.

A solution to pricing consumer X out of the market is to instead charge a lump-sum fee equal to area AC, and continue to charge Pc per unit. Profit in this instance equals twice the area AC (two consumers): 2 x AC. As it turns out, since consumer Y&#x27;s demand is twice consumer X&#x27;s, ABCD = 2 x AC. The profit is the same and the producer is indifferent to either of these pricing possibilities, although consumer Y is better off this way since she gets consumer surplus BD.

However, it is possible for the firm to earn even greater profits. Assume it sets the unit price equal to Pm, and imposes a lump-sum fee equal to area A. Both consumers again remain in the market, except now the firm is making a profit on each unit sold - total market profit from the sale of Qm units at price Pm is equal to area CDE. Profit from the lump-sum fee is 2 x A = AB. Total profit is therefore area ABCDE.

Thus, by charging a higher per unit price and a lower lump-sum fee, the firm has generated area E more profit than if it had charged a lower per-unit price and a higher lump-sum fee. Note that the firm is no longer producing the allocatively efficient output, and there is a deadweight loss experienced by society equal to area F - this is a result of the exercise of monopoly power.

Consumer X is left with no consumer surplus, while Consumer Y is left with area B.

==Examples of two-part tariffs==

The following items could be identified as two part tariffs; but it is possible some of them could be debated on the basis of the presence of fixed costs such as insurance which the firm cannot recoup in any other way.

* &quot;membership discount retailers&quot; such as shopping clubs that charge an annual fee for admission to the point of sale and also charge for your purchases
* amusement parks where there are admission fees and also per-ride fees
* cover charge for bars combined with per drink fees
* credit cards which charge an annual fee plus a per-transaction fee
* loyalty cards or clubs
* landline telephones where there is a fee to use the service (&#x27;line rental&#x27;) and also a fee per call. The line rental covers the cost of providing the service, the per minute charge covers the cost of placing the call on the network.
* personal seat licenses in professional sports, in which fans of a team pay an up-front lump sum fee for the right to purchase tickets at face value
* pay for play games

<text>Hildesheim (; or ; ) is a city in Lower Saxony, in north-central Germany with 101,693 inhabitants. It is in the district of Hildesheim, about southeast of Hanover on the banks of the Innerste River, a small tributary of the Leine River.

The Holy Roman Emperor Louis the Pious founded the Bishopric of Hildesheim in 815 and created the first settlement with a chapel on the so-called &quot;Domhügel&quot;.

Hildesheim is situated on the north–south Autobahn 7, and hence is connected with Hamburg in the north and Austria in the south.

With the Hildesheim Cathedral and the St. Michael&#x27;s Church, Hildesheim became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1985.

In 2015 the city and the diocese celebrated their 1200th anniversary.

== History ==
=== Early years ===
According to tradition, the city was named after its founder &quot;Hildwin&quot;. The city is one of the oldest cities in Northern Germany, became the seat of the Bishopric of Hildesheim in 815 and may have been founded when the bishop moved from Elze to the ford across the River Innerste, which was an important market on the Hellweg trade route. The settlement around the cathedral very quickly developed into a town and was granted market rights by King Otto III in 983. Originally the market was held in a street called () which still exists today. The first marketplace was laid out around the church St. Andreas. When the city grew further, a larger market place became necessary. The present market place of Hildesheim was laid out at the beginning of the 13th century when the city had about 5,000 inhabitants.

=== Middle Ages ===
When Hildesheim obtained city status in 1249, it was one of the biggest cities in Northern Germany. For four centuries the clergy ruled Hildesheim, before a town Hall was built and the citizens gained some influence and independence. Construction of the present Town Hall started in 1268. In 1367 Hildesheim became a member of the Hanseatic League. A war between the citizens and their bishop cost dearly in 1519–23 when they engaged in a feud.

=== Reformation to 17th century ===

Hildesheim became Lutheran in 1542, and only the cathedral and a few other buildings remained in Imperial (Roman Catholic) hands. Several villages around the city remained Roman Catholic as well.

During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, Hildesheim was besieged and occupied several times: in 1628 and 1632 by imperial troops; and in 1634 by troops from Brunswick and Lüneburg.

=== 19th century ===
In 1813, after the Battle of Leipzig in the Napoleonic Wars, the town became part of the Kingdom of Hanover, which was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia as a province after the Austro-Prussian War in 1866. In 1868 a highly valuable trove of about 70 Roman silver vessels for eating and drinking, the so-called Hildesheim Treasure, was unearthed by Prussian soldiers.

=== Early 20th century and World War II ===
Early in World War II, Nazi roundups of the Jewish population began, and hundreds of Hildesheim&#x27;s Jews were sent to concentration camps. Hildesheim was the location of a forced labour subcamp of the Nazi prison in Celle, and a subcamp of the Neuengamme concentration camp. After the dissolution of the latter, the surviving prisoners were sent on a death march to Ahlem. The city was heavily damaged by British air raids in 1945, especially on 22 March. Although Hildesheim had little military significance, two months before the end of the war the historic city was bombed as part of Britain&#x27;s Area Bombing Directive in order to undermine German civilian morale. As a result, 29% of the houses were destroyed and 45% damaged, while only 26% of the houses remained undamaged. The centre, which had retained its medieval character until then, was almost leveled. Destruction in the city as a whole was estimated at 20 to 30 percent. Around 200 out of 800 half-timbered framed houses survived.
During the war, valuable world heritage materials had been hidden in underground cellars. After the war and its aftermath, priority was given to rapid building of housing, and concrete structures took the place of the wrecked historic buildings. Most of the major churches – two of them now UNESCO World Heritage sites – were rebuilt in the original style soon after the war.

=== Late 20th century and present ===
In 1978, the University of Hildesheim was founded. In the 1980s a reconstruction of the historic centre began. Some of the unattractive concrete buildings around the market place were torn down and replaced by replicas of the original buildings. In the autumn of 2007, a decision was made to reconstruct the Upended Sugarloaf (), an iconic half-timbered house famous for its unusual shape. In 2015 the city and the diocese celebrates their 1200 anniversary with the Day of Lower Saxony.

== Religions ==
In 1542 most of the inhabitants became Lutherans. Today, 28.5% of the inhabitants identify themselves as Roman Catholics (Hildesheim Diocese) and 38.3% as Protestants (Evangelical Lutheran Church of Hanover). 33.0% of the inhabitants are adherents of other religions or do not have a religion at all. Up until 2015 the Serbian Orthodox Bishop of Germany had his seat in Himmelsthür (a locality of Hildesheim), before the seat moved to Frankfurt and, in 2018, to Düsseldorf.

== Main sights ==
* The &quot;Marktplatz&quot; (historic market place) was reconstructed in 1984–1990 after its destruction in the March 1945 air raid. The more noteworthy buildings in the square are:
** The &quot;Knochenhaueramtshaus&quot; (Butchers&#x27; Guild Hall), originally built in 1529 and destroyed in 1945, it was reconstructed from 1987 to 1989 according to original plans. The façade is sumptuously decorated with colourful paintings and German proverbs. Today the building houses a restaurant and the City Museum.
** The &quot;Bäckeramtshaus&quot; (Bakers&#x27; Guild Hall) is a half-timbered house which was originally built in 1825. It was destroyed in 1945 and rebuilt 1987-89. Today, it houses a café.
** The Town Hall, erected in the 13th century in Gothic style. Partly destroyed in 1945, it was rebuilt and inaugurated in 1954.
** The &quot;Tempelhaus&quot;, a late-Gothic 14th-century patrician house, which today houses the tourist information office. It suffered some damage during the Second World War but was restored by 1950.
** The &quot;Wedekindhaus&quot;, a 16th-century patrician house, is characterised by its high, ornately carved storeys including their ledges with depictions of allegorical figures.
** The adjoining &quot;Lüntzelhaus&quot; was built in 1755 in Baroque style.
** The &quot;Rolandhaus&quot; was originally built in the 14th century in Gothic style. In 1730, the house was remodelled, and a Baroque portal and a large bay window were added.
** The &quot;Stadtschänke&quot; (Town Tavern) is a large half-timbered house which was originally built in 1666. The smaller adjoining &quot;Rococcohaus&quot; was built in 1730 in rococo style.
** The &quot;Wollenwebergildehaus&quot; (Weavers&#x27; Guild Hall) was approximately built in 1600.
* The Romanesque St. Mary&#x27;s Cathedral (Hildesheim Cathedral), with its ancient bronze doors (Bernward Doors) (c. 1015) and other treasures. The cathedral was built in the 9th century, but almost completely destroyed in 1945; it was reconstructed soon after the war. It has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1985. The &quot;Thousand-year Rose&quot; is a reputedly 1,000‑year‑old dog rose bush, allegedly the world&#x27;s oldest living rose. It continues to flourish on the wall of the cathedral apse.
** Museum of the Cathedral: Cathedral Treasure.
* St. Michael&#x27;s Church (UNESCO World Heritage Site) – an early Romanesque church in Germany and an example of Ottonian architecture. It was built from 1010 to 1022.
* The &quot;St. Andreas&quot; (St. Andrew&#x27;s Church), a 12th-century Gothic church with the highest church steeple (114.5 m) in Lower Saxony. Opposite the church stands the Upended Sugarloaf, a half-timbered house dating from 1509.
* The &quot;Roemer-und-Pelizaeus-Museum&quot;, with collections from ancient Egypt and Peru and special exhibitions.
* The &quot;Kreuzkirche&quot; (Church of the Holy Cross) was originally a part of the medieval fortifications. It was converted into a church around 1079, severely damaged in 1945 and rebuilt after the war.
* The Romanesque Basilica Minor of St. Godehard (St. Gotthard&#x27;s Church), built 1133–1172, which is scheduled to become a UNESCO World Heritage Site in the near future. Other notable buildings stand opposite the church: St. Nicolai&#x27;s Chapel is a former parish church which was built in the Romanesque style in the 12th century and transformed into a residential building after 1803, and the Hospital of the Five Wounds which is a large half-timbered house dating from 1770 with a half-hip roof.
* The church St. Lamberti is a late Gothic building, venue of a weekly concert series at market time.
* The &quot;Kehrwiederturm&quot; (Kehrwieder Tower), built around 1300, is the only remaining tower of the medieval fortifications.
* &quot;Half-timbered houses&quot; which were not destroyed during World War II can be seen around St. Godehard and the &quot;Kehrwieder Tower&quot;, in the streets Keßlerstraße, Knollenstraße, Gelber Stern, Am Kehrwieder, Lappenberg, Brühl, Hinterer Brühl, and Godehardsplatz. Some of them have ornate wood carvings in their façades, e.g. the &quot;Wernersches Haus&quot; (1606) in Godehardsplatz and the &quot;Waffenschmiedehaus&quot; (weapon smith house, 1548) at Gelber Stern.
*The church &quot;St. Jacobi&quot; (St. James&#x27; Church) is a 500-year-old pilgrim church in the Gothic style and was one of the many St. James chapels on St. James&#x27;s Path. Today the church is a culture church with emphasis on literature.
*The Monument of the Synagogue (consecrated in 1849 and destroyed in 1938 during the Kristallnacht) was erected in 1988 in the old Jewish quarter on &quot;Lappenberg&quot; Street. The foundations were reconstructed to give observers an idea of how large the synagogue was. The reddish brick building (built around 1840) opposite was the Jewish school.
* &quot;Mauritiuskirche&quot; (St. Maurice&#x27;s Church), a Romanesque church (11th century) on a hill in the west of the city in the quarter of Moritzberg with a cloister. The interior of the church is Baroque and the tower was added in 1765. 
* &quot;Kaiserhaus&quot; (Emperor&#x27;s House): Renaissance building (1586) in &quot;Alter Markt&quot;, the oldest street of Hildesheim, rebuilt after the war. The façade is decorated with Roman statues and medallions. Opposite, there is a noteworthy sandstone bay window dating from 1568. Originally, it belonged to a private house which was torn down at the end of the 19th century. The bay window was dismantled before and added to another house in the eastern part of Hildesheim which remained undamaged during World War II. From there, the bay window was removed when the house was remodelled and added to the school at the present site in 1972.
* Close to the &quot;Kaiserhaus&quot; (Emperor&#x27;s house) the &quot;Alte Kemenate&quot;, a noteworthy medieval store house reaching a height of 5.5 meters, can be seen behind the school in the street Alter Markt. It has a rectangular basis measuring 6.5 meters × 5.0 meters and a cellar with a vaulted construction. The store house, one of the oldest profane buildings in Hildesheim, was built of sandstone in a Gothic style the 15th century. According to other sources it might be even older, i.e. built between the end of the 11th and the middle of the 13th century. The building has two floors. As it did not consist of wood it did not burn down in 1945, but was only damaged and immediately repaired after the war. From 1945 - 1951 it was used for residential purposes. The &quot;Alte Kemenate&quot; is not open to the public.
* St Magdalena&#x27;s Church (&quot;Magdalenenkirche&quot;) is a small church with large lancet windows in the historic street Old Market (&quot;Alter Markt&quot;) which was consecrated in 1224. It was originally built in a Romanesque style, but enlarged and remodelled in Gothic style in 1456. It houses a wooden altar (about 1520) with carvings and other works of art. The small street Süsternstraße features a well-preserved part of the medieval city wall with a round tower. Opposite the church, a tall half-timbered house which was rebuilt in 1981 on the medieval city wall can be seen in the small side street Mühlenstraße. The façade is decorated with wood carvings.
* Magdalenengarten, a Baroque park which was laid out in 1720–1725, is near St. Magdalena&#x27;s Church. There are many different kinds of rose bush, a rose museum, pavilions, Baroque statues, a well-preserved part of the medieval city wall in it and even a vineyard yielding 100–200 bottles of wine per year. In spring a rare species of wild yellow tulip (tulipa sylvestris) blossoms in the western part of the park.
* St. Bernward&#x27;s Church, a neo-Romanesque church built 1905–1907, destroyed in 1945 and rebuilt from 1948 to 1949, houses a Gothic wooden altar retable dating from the beginning of the 15th century.
* A part of the medieval defence system consisting of a wall with moats and ramparts, built around the city in the 13th century, is well preserved. Kalenberger Graben, an artificial lake, is a part of it. It is surrounded by a park. In April a rare species of wild yellow tulip (tulipa sylvestris) blossoms in the park.
* Steuerwald Castle (&quot;Burg Steuerwald&quot;) in the north of the city, about from the Market Place, was built 1310–13. Its tower (25 m) was added in 1325. The chapel, dedicated to St Magdalena, was originally built in the Romanesque style and transformed into a Gothic chapel in 1507. Today it is used for weddings and concerts.
* Marienburg Castle (&quot;Burg Marienburg&quot;) is in the southeast of Hildesheim, about from the Market Place. It was built 1346–1349.
* Sorsum is a former village in the West of Hildesheim which became a part of the city in 1974. There is a former domain, founded in the Middle Ages, which was transformed into a residential area after 2000. The pigeon tower, built in 1733, the large barn (1786) and the manor house dating from 1734 are the most notable sights in this rural part of Hildesheim.
* Marienrode Priory (&quot;Kloster Marienrode&quot;) is in the southwest of Hildesheim, about from the Market Place. It was founded in 1125. The foundation stone of the present church was laid in 1412. The church was built in Gothic style with three naves and completed in 1462. The Baroque ridge turret was added in the 18th century. In the church, there are two noteworthy Baroque altars dating from 1750 approximately and a Gothic sandstone sculpture of Saint Mary which was made in 1460. The organ dates from the middle of the 18th century. A small chapel of the priory, Saint Cosmas and Damian, which was built in 1792, was converted into a small Protestant church in 1830. The priory was dissolved in 1806, but returned to the Catholic Church in 1986. Since 1988, it has again been operated by nuns. Near the monastery there is a large fishpond with a tall windmill built in 1839.

<doc id="153232" wikidata="Q264724" url="?curid=153232" title="Nigella Lawson">
<text>Nigella Lucy Lawson (born 6 January 1960) is an English food writer and television cook.

After graduating from Oxford, Lawson worked as a book reviewer and restaurant critic, later becoming the deputy literary editor of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; in 1986. She then wrote for a number of newspapers and magazines as a freelance journalist. In 1998, her first cookery book, &quot;How to Eat&quot;, was published and sold 300,000 copies, becoming a best-seller. Her second book, &quot;How to Be a Domestic Goddess&quot;, was published in 2000, winning the British Book Award for Author of the Year.

In 1999, Lawson hosted her own cooking show series, &quot;Nigella Bites&quot;, on Channel 4, accompanied by another best-selling cookbook. &quot;Nigella Bites&quot; won Lawson a Guild of Food Writers Award. Her 2005 ITV daytime chat show &quot;Nigella&quot; met with a negative critical reaction and was cancelled after attracting low ratings. She hosted the Food Network&#x27;s &quot;Nigella Feasts&quot; in the United States in 2006, followed by a three-part BBC Two series, &quot;Nigella&#x27;s Christmas Kitchen&quot;, in the UK, which led to the commissioning of &quot;Nigella Express&quot; on BBC Two in 2007. Her own cookware range, Living Kitchen, has a value of £7 million, and she has sold more than 8 million cookery books worldwide to date.

== Early life ==
Nigella Lawson was born in 1960 in Wandsworth, London, one of the daughters of Nigel Lawson, Baron Lawson of Blaby (1932–2023), a business and finance journalist who later became a Conservative MP and Chancellor of the Exchequer in Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s government, and his first wife, Vanessa Salmon (1936–1985), a socialite and the heiress to the J. Lyons and Co. fortune. Both her parents were from Jewish families. Her given name was originally suggested by her grandmother. Her family owned homes in Kensington and Chelsea.

Nigel and Vanessa Lawson divorced in 1980, when Nigella was 20. They both remarried: her father that year to a House of Commons researcher, Therese Maclear (to whom he was married until 2008), and her mother, in the early 1980s, to philosopher A. J. Ayer (they remained married until her mother&#x27;s death). As her father was at the time a prominent political figure, Nigella found some of the judgements and preconceptions that were formed about her frustrating. She has attributed her unhappiness as a child, in part, to the problematic relationship she had with her mother.

Lawson&#x27;s mother died of liver cancer in Westminster, London at the age of 48. Lawson&#x27;s full-blood siblings are her brother, Dominic, former editor of &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot;, sister Horatia, and sister Thomasina, who died of breast cancer, in her early thirties, in 1993. She has a half-brother, Tom, who is currently headmaster at Eastbourne College, and a half-sister, Emily; Tom and Emily are her father&#x27;s children by his second wife. Lawson is a cousin to both George Monbiot and Fiona Shackleton through the Salmon family.

===Ancestry===
Taking part in the third series of the BBC family-history documentary series &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;, Lawson sought to uncover some of her family&#x27;s ancestry. She traced her ancestors to Ashkenazi Jews who originate from eastern Europe and Germany, leaving Lawson surprised not to have Sephardi ancestry, as she had believed. She also uncovered that her maternal great-great-great-grandfather, Coenraad Sammes (later Coleman Joseph), had fled to England from Amsterdam in 1830 to escape a prison sentence following a conviction for theft. His daughter Hannah married Samuel Gluckstein, who was in business with Barnett Salmon of Salmon &amp; Gluckstein. They had several children, including Isidore and Montague Gluckstein, who together with Salmon founded J. Lyons and Co. in 1887, and Helena, who married him. One of the children of Helena and Barnett Salmon was Alfred Salmon (1868–1928), the great-grandfather of Nigella Lawson.

===Education===
Lawson spent some of her childhood in the Welsh village of Higher Kinnerton. She had to move schools nine times between the ages of 9 and 18; consequently, she described her school years as difficult. &quot;I was just difficult, disruptive, good at school work, but rude, I suspect, and too highly-strung&quot;, Lawson reflected. She was educated at several independent schools, among them Ibstock Place School, Queen&#x27;s Gate School and Godolphin and Latymer School. She worked for many department stores in London, and went on to graduate from Lady Margaret Hall at the University of Oxford with a second-class degree in medieval and modern languages. She lived in Florence, Italy, for a time.

==Career==

===Early work===
Lawson originally worked in publishing, first taking a job under publisher Naim Attallah. At 23, she began her career in journalism after Charles Moore had invited her to write for &quot;The Spectator&quot; – her father had previously been editor at the same publication, and her older brother soon would take up the same role. Her initial work at the magazine consisted of writing book reviews, after which she became a restaurant critic there in 1985. She became the deputy literary editor of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; in 1986, aged 26.

She attracted publicity in 1989 when she admitted voting for Labour in an election, not her father&#x27;s Conservative Party, and then criticised Margaret Thatcher in print. Regarding her political relationship with her father, Lawson has stated, &quot;My father would never expect me to agree with him about anything in particular and, to be honest, we never talk about politics much.&quot;

After &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, she embarked upon a freelance writing career, realising that &quot;I was on the wrong ladder. I didn&#x27;t want to be an executive, being paid to worry rather than think&quot;. In the United Kingdom, she wrote for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;, &quot;The Observer&quot; and &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;, and penned a food column for &quot;Vogue&quot; and a make-up column for &quot;The Times Magazine&quot;, as well as working with &quot;Gourmet&quot; and &quot;Bon Appétit&quot; in the United States. In 1995 Lawson left a two-week stint at Talk Radio early after making a statement that her shopping was done for her, apparently due to its incompatibility with the radio station&#x27;s desired &quot;common touch&quot;.
In the mid-1990s she occasionally hosted TV press-reviews slot &quot;What the Papers Say&quot;, and was co-host, with David Aaronovitch, of Channel 4 literary-discussion series &quot;Booked&quot;. In 1998 she repeatedly guested on Channel 4 cookery series &quot;Nigel Slater&#x27;s Real-Food Show&quot;.

===1998–2002: First cookery books and &quot;Nigella Bites&quot;===
Lawson had an established sense of cooking from her childhood, having had a mother who enjoyed cooking. She conceived the idea of writing a cookbook after she observed a dinner party host in tears because of an unset crème caramel. &quot;How to Eat&quot; (1998), featuring culinary tips on preparation and saving time, sold 300,000 copies in the UK. &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; dubbed it &quot;the most valuable culinary guide published this decade&quot;.

Its successor, &quot;How to be a Domestic Goddess&quot; (2000), focuses primarily on baking. &quot;The Times&quot; wrote of the book that it &quot;is defined by its intimate, companionable approach. She is not issuing matronly instructions like Delia; she is merely making sisterly suggestions&quot;. Lawson rejected feminist criticism of her book, adding that &quot;[s]ome people did take the domestic goddess title literally rather than ironically. It was about the pleasures of feeling like one rather than actually being one.&quot; The book sold 180,000 copies in four months, and won Lawson the title of Author of the Year at the British Book Awards in 2001, fending off competition from authors such as J. K. Rowling. &quot;How to Eat&quot; and &quot;How to be a Domestic Goddess&quot; were published in the U.S. in 2000 and 2001. As a result of the book&#x27;s success, &quot;The Observer&quot; took her on as a social affairs columnist.

Lawson next hosted her own cooking show television series, &quot;Nigella Bites&quot;, which ran from 1999 to 2001 on Channel 4, followed by a Christmas special in 2001. Victor Lewis-Smith, a critic usually known for his biting comments, praised Lawson for being &quot;formidably charismatic&quot;. The first series of &quot;Nigella Bites&quot; averaged 1.9 million viewers, and won her the Television Broadcast of the Year at the Guild of Food Writers Awards and the Best Television Food Show at the World Food Media Awards in 2001. The show yielded an accompanying best-selling recipe book, also called &quot;Nigella Bites&quot;, for which Waterstone&#x27;s book stores reported UK sales of over 300,000. The book won the WH Smith Lifestyle Book of the Year award.

The &quot;Nigella Bites&quot; series, which was filmed in her home in west London, was later broadcast on American television channels E! and Style Network. Lawson said of the US release, &quot;In the UK, my viewers have responded to the fact I&#x27;m trying to reduce, not add to, their burden and I&#x27;m looking forward to making that connection with Style viewers across the US&quot;. Overall, Lawson was well received in the United States. Those who did criticise her often suggested she was too flirtatious; a commentator from &quot;The New York Times&quot; said, &quot;Lawson&#x27;s sexy roundness mixed with her speed-demon technique makes cooking dinner with Nigella look like a prelude to an orgy&quot;. The book of &quot;Nigella Bites&quot; became the second best-selling cook book of Christmas 2002 in America. The series was followed by &quot;Forever Summer with Nigella&quot; in 2002 on Channel 4, the concept being, &quot;that you cook to make you still feel as though you&#x27;re on holiday&quot;. Fellow food writer Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall condemned the concept as &quot;cynical and reckless&quot; and referred to the book as &quot;Fuck Seasonality&quot;.

In 2002 Lawson also began to write a fortnightly cooking article for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and brought out a profitable line of kitchenware, called the Living Kitchen range, which is sold by numerous retailers. Her range&#x27;s value has continued to grow, starting at an estimated £2 million in 2003.

===2003–2006: &quot;Nigella Feasts&quot; and BBC contract===

In November 2003, Lawson oversaw the menu and preparations for a lunch hosted by Tony Blair at Downing Street for George W. Bush and his wife during their state visit to the UK. Former First Lady of the United States, Laura Bush, is said to be a fan of Lawson&#x27;s recipes and once included one of her soups as the starter for the 2002 presidential Christmas dinner. Lawson&#x27;s fifth book, &quot;Feast: Food that Celebrates Life&quot;, released in 2004, made sales worth £3 million. London&#x27;s &quot;Evening Standard&quot; wrote that the book &quot;works both as a practical manual and an engrossing read. ... Nobody else writes so openly about the emotional significance of food.&quot; Lawson appeared frequently on American television in 2004, conducting cookery slots on talk shows such as &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot;.

In the UK in 2005, Lawson started to host a daytime television chat show on ITV1 called &quot;Nigella&quot;, on which celebrity guests joined her in a studio kitchen. The first episode debuted with a disappointing 800,000 viewers. The show was met with a largely negative critical reaction, and after losing 40% of its viewers in the first week, the show was cancelled. She later commented to &quot;Radio Times&quot; that on her first show, she was almost too frightened to come out of her dressing room. Lawson added that having to pretend to be interested in the lives of the celebrities on her show became too much of an effort.

Her third food-based television series, called &quot;Nigella Feasts&quot;, debuted on the Food Network in the United States in Autumn 2006 for a 13-week run. &quot;Time&quot; magazine wrote a favourable review of the show; &quot;the real appeal of &quot;Feasts&quot; ... is her unfussy, wry, practical approach to entertaining and quality comfort food. &quot;Feasts&quot; will leave you wishing for an invite&quot;.

Lawson was next signed to BBC Two to host a three-part cookery show entitled &quot;Nigella&#x27;s Christmas Kitchen&quot;, which began on 6 December 2006 and aired weekly. The first two episodes secured the second highest ratings of the week for BBC Two, with the first episode debuting with a strong 3.5 million. The final episode went on to become the top show on BBC Two the week that it was aired. &quot;Nigella&#x27;s Christmas Kitchen&quot; won Lawson a second World Food Media Award in 2007. Her influence as a food commentator was also demonstrated in late 2006, when after she had lauded goose fat as being an essential ingredient for Christmas, sales of the product increased significantly in the UK. Waitrose and Tesco both stated that goose fat sales had more than doubled, as well as Asda&#x27;s increasing by 65% from the previous week. Similarly, after she advised using prunes in a recipe on &quot;Nigella&#x27;s Christmas Kitchen&quot;, Waitrose had increased sales of 30% year on year.

===2007–2009: &quot;Nigella Express&quot; and &quot;Nigella&#x27;s Christmas&quot;===
&quot;Nigella&#x27;s Christmas Kitchen&quot; led to the commissioning of a 13-part cookery series about fast food entitled &quot;Nigella Express&quot;. She said, &quot;The recipes aren&#x27;t particularly healthy. That said, I wouldn&#x27;t describe them as junk.&quot; The show became another ratings success and one of BBC Two&#x27;s top-rated shows each week. The first episode debuted with 2.85 million viewers, a high percentage above the channel&#x27;s slot average. The second episode&#x27;s viewing figures rose to 3.3 million, and the series peaked at 3.4 million on 22 October 2007.

Her influence with the public was again demonstrated when sales of Riesling wine increased by 30% in the UK after she had incorporated it into her Coq au Riesling recipe on &quot;Nigella Express&quot;. In December 2007 she appeared on BBC&#x27;s &quot;The Graham Norton Show&quot; and said that she had once eaten 30 pickled eggs for a £1,000 bet.

Lawson was criticised by some viewers who complained that she had gained weight since the debut episode of the series. &quot;The Guardian&quot;, however, noted, &quot;the food matches her appearance – flawless, polished and sexy&quot;. The rights to &quot;Nigella Express&quot; were sold to Discovery Asia. The series was nominated at the 35th Daytime Emmy Awards in the United States for Outstanding Lifestyle Program, and Lawson herself for the Outstanding Lifestyle Host.

The accompanying book to &quot;Nigella Express&quot; was released in the UK in September 2007, US in November 2007, and in Australia in 2008. Sharing the same name as the television series, the book became another best-seller in the UK, and was outselling television chef Jamie Oliver by 100,000 copies, according to Waterstone&#x27;s. It was reported that over 490,000 copies had been sold by mid-December in the UK. Furthermore, the book was number one for a period on Amazon UK&#x27;s best-selling books, and was ninth on their overall list of Christmas best-sellers in any category. Paul Levy of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote that the tone of the recipes was &quot;just right. One of the appealing things about Nigella&#x27;s brief introductions to each of them is that she thinks not just as cook, but as eater, and tells you whether they&#x27;re messy, sticky or fussy.&quot; In January 2008, Lawson was estimated to have sold more than 3 million books worldwide. Her Christmas book was released in October 2008 and the television show in December of the same year.

===2010–2014: &quot;Nigellissima&quot; and &quot;The Taste&quot;===

Lawson was featured as one of the three judges on a special battle of &quot;Iron Chef America&quot;, titled &quot;The Super Chef Battle&quot;, which pitted White House Executive Chef Cristeta Comerford and Iron Chef Bobby Flay against chef Emeril Lagasse and Iron Chef Mario Batali. This episode was originally broadcast on 3 January 2010. Lawson&#x27;s cookbook &quot;Kitchen: Recipes from the Heart of the Home&quot; (2010) is a tie-in with the TV series &quot;Nigella Kitchen&quot;. This was shown in the UK and on the Food Network in the United States.

&quot;Nigellissima: Instant Italian Inspiration&quot; was released in 2012. The 8-part TV series entitled &quot;Nigellissima&quot; was broadcast by the BBC. Lawson obtained work experience in Italy during her gap year.&lt;ref name=&quot;FinancialTimes2/11/2012&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

She travelled to the United States in 2013 and starred alongside Anthony Bourdain in the reality cooking show &quot;The Taste&quot;. The UK version of the show began airing on 7 January 2014 on Channel 4. Lawson was granted a visa to travel to the United States and travelled there for a continuation of the series. In 2014, Lawson was hired by a chocolate company to appear in an advertisement, the advertisement was filmed in New Zealand in May for a local confection manufacturer Whittaker&#x27;s.

===2015–present: &quot;Simply Nigella&quot;, &quot;Eurovision and&quot; &quot;Australian Television&quot;===
The UK and US series of &quot;The Taste&quot; were both completed and in autumn 2015 Lawson began &quot;Simply Nigella&quot; for BBC 2. The focus was on comfort food, familiar dishes that are simple and quick to cook.

Lawson was spokesperson for the United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest 2015, giving the twelve points to Sweden&#x27;s Måns Zelmerlöw and his song &quot;Heroes&quot;, which went on to win the contest.

It was reported on 18 January 2016, that Lawson would make a return to Australian television, joining the eighth series of &quot;MasterChef Australia&quot; as a guest judge, alongside the returning judges. She returned to the show for the tenth series in 2018 and eleventh series in 2019.

In 2022, it was announced that Lawson would be returning to Australian television as a judge on the twelfth season of 7 Network&#x27;s &quot;My Kitchen Rules.&quot; Lawson co-hosted and judged the first six episodes of the season alongside long term judge Manu Feildel before leaving the series after the first round of instant restaurants. In 2023, it was announced that Lawson would be returning to the show for its thirteenth season as a judge in Kitchen HQ alongside fellow returning judges Manu Feildel and Colin Fassnidge.

==Presenting style and image==
Though Lawson has enjoyed a successful career in cookery, she is not a trained chef, and does not like being referred to as a &quot;celebrity chef&quot;. Nor does she see herself as a cook or an expert in her field; nonetheless, she is frequently described as a chef. Throughout Lawson&#x27;s television programmes, she emphasises that she cooks for her own pleasure, for enjoyment, and that she finds cooking therapeutic. When deciding upon which recipes to feature in her books, she takes the view of the eater, stating, &quot;If it&#x27;s something I don&#x27;t want to carry on eating once I&#x27;m full, then I don&#x27;t want the recipe ... I have to feel that I want to cook the thing again.&quot;

Lawson has adopted a casual approach to cooking, stating, &quot;I think cooking should be about fun and family. ... I think part of my appeal is that my approach to cooking is really relaxed and not rigid. There are no rules in my kitchen.&quot; One editor, highlighting the technical simplicity of Lawson&#x27;s recipes, noted that &quot;her dishes require none of the elaborate preparation called for by most TV chefs&quot;.

Lawson has become renowned for her flirtatious manner of presenting, although she argues &quot;It&#x27;s not meant to be flirtatious. ... I don&#x27;t have the talent to adopt a different persona. It&#x27;s intimate, not flirtatious&quot;. The perceived overt sexuality of her presentation style has led to Lawson being called the &quot;queen of food porn&quot;. Many commentators have alluded to Lawson&#x27;s attractiveness, and she was once named as one of the world&#x27;s most beautiful women.

The media have also noted Lawson&#x27;s ability to engage with both male and female viewers; &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote, &quot;Men love her because they want to be with her. Women love her because they want to be her.&quot; Chef Gary Rhodes said that viewers were attracted to her smile rather than her cooking. Despite often being labelled as a &quot;domestic goddess&quot;, she said that she exhibits very few of the qualities associated with the title.

==Personal life==
===First marriage and children===

Lawson met journalist John Diamond in 1986, when they were both writing for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;. They married in Venice in 1992, and had a daughter, Cosima, and a son, Bruno. Diamond was diagnosed with throat cancer in 1997 and died in March 2001, aged 47. One of his last messages to Lawson was, &quot;How proud I am of you and what you have become. The great thing about us is that we have made us who we are.&quot; His death occurred during the filming of &quot;Nigella Bites&quot;; &quot;I took a fortnight off. But I&#x27;m not a great believer in breaks&quot;, Lawson said; she suffered a bout of depression following the funeral. After Diamond&#x27;s death, Lawson kept all of the related press clippings in what she called her &quot;Morbidobox&quot;.

===Second marriage===
Lawson married art collector Charles Saatchi in September 2003. 
In June 2013, photographs were published by &quot;The Sunday People&quot; of Lawson being grabbed around the neck by Saatchi, during an argument outside a London seafood restaurant. According to a witness, Lawson was very distressed by the incident. Saatchi later described the pictures as showing only a &quot;playful tiff&quot; and his trying to emphasise a point. After a police investigation of the incident, Saatchi was cautioned for assault, and Lawson left the family home. Lawson said in court Saatchi subjected her to &quot;intimate terrorism&quot;, that he threatened to destroy her unless she cleared him in court. Subsequently, while giving evidence, Lawson claimed casual cruelty and controlling behaviour by Saatchi made her unhappy and drove her to occasional drug use. She cited an example that Saatchi prevented her entertaining at home and punished her for going to a birthday party of a woman friend. She was not beaten but was left emotionally scarred.

Saatchi announced his divorce from Lawson in early July, stating that he had &quot;clearly been a disappointment to Nigella during the last year or so&quot; and the couple had &quot;become estranged and drifted apart&quot;. Lawson made no public comment in response; however, court papers showed that it was Lawson who applied for divorce, citing ongoing unreasonable behaviour. On 31 July 2013, seven weeks after the incident, the pair were granted a decree nisi, ending their ten-year marriage. They reached a private financial settlement.

===Assistants&#x27; fraud trial===
On 27 November 2013, a trial of the former couple&#x27;s two personal assistants, Italian-born sisters began in &quot;R v Grillo and Grillo&quot;. The Grillos were accused of fraudulently using the credit cards of Saatchi&#x27;s private company. During court proceedings in early December, the sisters claimed that Lawson had permitted their use of the credit cards in exchange for their silence regarding her drug use. Questions regarding Lawson&#x27;s drug use were allowed by the judge as part of the sisters&#x27; &quot;bad character&quot; defence. Lawson admitted to taking cocaine and cannabis but denied she had been addicted, stating, &quot;I found it made an intolerable situation tolerable.&quot; On 20 December 2013, the two sisters were acquitted. Scotland Yard said that Lawson would not be investigated over the drug allegations.

Charles Saatchi was alleged to have started a smear campaign against Lawson in the British media through PR man Richard Hillgrove before the trial was over. Lawson&#x27;s lawyers demanded that Hillgrove remove comments about her from his blog. Lawson said in court that ending her marriage to Saatchi had created intolerable conditions for herself and her family, describing Saatchi as &quot;a brilliant but brutal man&quot;.

Lawson maintained she was &quot;totally cannabis, cocaine, any drug, free&quot; after the divorce.

On 30 March 2014, Lawson was not permitted to board a flight from London to Los Angeles. The US Department of Homeland Security explained that foreigners who had admitted drug taking were deemed &quot;inadmissible&quot;. However, US authorities invited her to apply for a visa shortly afterwards, and she was granted a &quot;waiver of inadmissibility&quot; allowing her to travel to the US.

===Interests and beliefs===
In 2008, Lawson reported that she held a personal fortune of £15 million. Her husband Charles Saatchi was worth £100 million at that time. She said her two children should not inherit any of her money, saying: &quot;I am determined that my children should have no financial security. It ruins people not having to earn money.&quot;

Lawson is of Jewish heritage. Both of Lawson&#x27;s parents are Jewish and her upbringing was non-observant. Lawson is an atheist. In one of her newspaper articles, she said &quot;most [women] simply have, somewhere, a fantasy about having sex, in a non-defining, non-exclusive way, with other women.&quot;

Lawson is a supporter of the Lavender Trust which gives support to young women with breast cancer. She first became involved with the charity in 2002 when she baked some lavender cupcakes to be auctioned at a fundraising event, which sold for a significant amount of money. She subsequently featured the recipe in her book &quot;Forever Summer with Nigella&quot;.

In December 2008, Lawson was criticised by animal rights groups for comments which suggested it would be morally acceptable to wear the fur of an animal that one had killed, and that she would be proud to wear the fur of a bear that she had hunted or &quot;[gone] into battle&quot; with.

It was revealed by leaked Whitehall documents in 2003 that Lawson declined an OBE from Queen Elizabeth II in 2001, explaining that &quot;I&#x27;m not saving lives and I&#x27;m not doing anything other than something I absolutely love.&quot; As the daughter of a life peer, Lawson is entitled to the courtesy style of &quot;The Honourable&quot;, and may thus be referred to as The Hon. Nigella Lawson; however, she does not use this courtesy style.

Lawson has stated that she believes cooking is &quot;a metaphor for life&quot;, in the sense that &quot;When you cook, you need structure [...] but just as importantly you need to be able to loosen up and go with the flow [...] you must not strive for perfection but, rather, acknowledge your mistakes and work out how you can rectify them&quot;. She has described cooking as &quot;a way of strengthening oneself&quot;, in the sense that &quot;being able to sustain oneself is the skill of the survivor&quot;.

<text>A court order is an official proclamation by a judge (or panel of judges) that defines the legal relationships between the parties to a hearing, a trial, an appeal or other court proceedings. Such ruling requires or authorizes the carrying out of certain steps by one or more parties to a case. A court order must be signed by a judge; some jurisdictions may also require it to be notarized. A court order governs each case throughout its entirety. If an individual violates the court order, the judge may hold that person in contempt.

==Content==
The content and provisions of a court order depend on the type of proceeding, the phase of the proceedings in which they are issued, and the procedural and evidentiary rules that govern the proceedings.

An order can be as simple as setting a date for trial or as complex as restructuring contractual relationships by and between many corporations in a multi-jurisdictional dispute. It may be a final order (one that concludes the court action), or an interim order (one during the action). Most orders are written, and are signed by the judge. Some orders, however, are spoken orally by the judge in open court, and are only reduced to writing in the transcript of the proceedings.

==Examples==
The following represents a small sampling of matters that are commonly dictated by the terms of a court order:
* Child custody 
* Child support 
* Court dates 
* Criminal sentences 
* Divorce decree 
* Emergency protective order 
* Equitable remedy 
* Gag order
* Injunction
* Lawsuit rulings 
* Restitution and unjust enrichment
* Restraining order 
* Search warrant 
* Stay of execution 
*Temporary protective order 

===U.S. interim order===
One kind of interim court order is a temporary restraining order (TRO), to preserve the status quo. Such an order may later be overturned or vacated during the litigation; or it may become a final order and judgment, subject then to appeal.

In the area of domestic violence, U.S. courts will routinely issue a temporary order of protection (TOP, or temporary protective order, TPO) to prevent any further violence or threat of violence.

In family law, temporary orders can also be called &quot;pendente lite&quot; relief and may include grants of temporary alimony, child custody, and/or visitation.

<text>Apion Pleistoneices ( &quot;Apíōn Pleistoníkēs&quot;; 30–20 BC – c. AD 45–48), also called Apion Mochthos, was a Hellenized Egyptian grammarian, sophist, and commentator on Homer. He was born at the Siwa Oasis and flourished in the first half of the 1st century AD. His name is sometimes incorrectly spelled Appion, and some sources, as in the Suda, call him a son of Pleistoneices, while others more correctly state that Pleistoneices was only a surname, and that he was the son of Poseidonius.

== Life ==
Apion studied at Alexandria under Apollonius the Sophist (the son of Archibius of Alexandria) and Didymus, from whom he inherited his love for the Homeric poems. He settled in Rome at an unknown date, and taught rhetoric as the successor of the grammarian Theon until the reign of Claudius.

Apion appears to have enjoyed an extraordinary reputation for his extensive knowledge and his versatility as an orator; but the ancients are unanimous in censuring his ostentatious vanity. He declared that every one whom he mentioned in his works would be immortalized; he placed himself by the side of the greatest philosophers of ancient Greece, and used to say that Alexandria ought to be proud of having a man like himself among its citizens. However, none of his works survived. It is likely that the name &quot;cymbalum mundi&quot;, by which Tiberius was accustomed to call him, was meant to express both his loquacity and his boastful character. He is spoken of as the most active of grammarians. According to the Suda, his surname was &quot;Mochthos&quot; (μόχθος), which is usually explained as describing the zeal and labour with which he prosecuted his studies.

In the reign of Caligula, Apion travelled about in Greece, and was received everywhere with the highest honours as the great interpreter of Homer. About the same time, 38 AD, the inhabitants of Alexandria raised complaints against the Jews residing in their city and endeavored to curtail their rights and privileges. They sent an embassy to emperor Caligula, which was headed by Apion, for he was a skillful speaker and known to entertain a great hatred of the Jews. The latter also sent an embassy, which was headed by Philo. In this transaction, Apion appears to have overstepped the limits of his commission, for he not only brought forward the complaints of his fellow-citizens but endeavored to excite the emperor&#x27;s anger against the Jews by reminding him that they refused to erect statues to him and to swear by his sacred name. The results of this embassy, as well as the remaining part of Apion&#x27;s life, are unknown; but according to Josephus, he died of a disease which he had brought upon himself by his dissolute mode of life.

==Works==
Apion wrote several works, none of which has survived. The well-known story &quot;Androclus and the Lion&quot;, which is preserved in Aulus Gellius, is from his work: &quot;Aegyptiaca/&quot;Αἰγυπτιακά &quot;(&quot;Wonders of Egypt&quot;)&quot;. The surviving fragments of his work are printed in the &quot;Etymologicum Gudianum&quot;, ed. Sturz, 1818.

*&quot;Upon Homer&quot;, whose poems seem to have formed the principal part of his studies, for he is said not only to have made the best recension of the text of the poems, but to have written explanations of phrases and words in the form of a dictionary (Λέξεις Ὁμηρικαί), and investigations concerning the life and native country of the poet. The best part of his Λέξεις Ὁμηρικαί are supposed to be incorporated in the Homeric Lexicon of Apollonius. Apion&#x27;s labors upon Homer are often referred to by Eustathius and other grammarians.
*A work on Egypt (Αἰγυπτιακά) consisting of five books, which was highly valued in antiquity, for it contained descriptions of nearly all the remarkable objects in Egypt. It also contained numerous attacks upon the Jews.
*A work in praise of Alexander the Great.
*Histories of separate countries. (Ἱστορία κατὰ ἔθνος, Suda &quot;s. v.&quot; Ἀπίων.)
*On the celebrated glutton Apicius.
*&quot;On the language of the Romans&quot; (Περὶ τῆς ‛Ρωμαίων διαλέκτου).
*&quot;De metallica disciplina&quot;.
*&quot;Androclus and the Lion&quot; and &quot;The Dolphin near Dicaearchia&quot;. The greatest fragments of the works of Apion are the story about Androclus and his lion, and about the dolphin near Dicaearchia.

==Epigrams==
In the Suda we find references to Apion as a writer of epigrams (&quot;s. vv.&quot; Ἀγύρτης, σπιλάδες, σφάραγον, and τρίγληνα), but whether he is the same as the grammarian is uncertain.

<text>Diogenianus () was a Greek grammarian from Heraclea in Pontus (or in Caria) who flourished during the reign of Hadrian (117–138). He was the author of an alphabetical lexicon, chiefly of poetical words, abridged from the great lexicon () of Pamphilus of Alexandria (AD 50) and other similar works. It was also known by the title (“Manual for those without means”). It formed the basis of the lexicon, or rather glossary, of Hesychius of Alexandria, which is described in the preface as a new edition of the work of Diogenianus. A collection of 776 proverbs under his name is still extant bearing the name Παροιμίαι δημώδεις ἐκ τῆς Διογενιανοῦ συναγωγῆς, probably an abridgment of the collection made by himself from his lexicon (ed. by Ernst von Leutsch and Friedrich Wilhelm Schneidewin in &quot;Paroemiographi Graeci&quot;, i. 1839). Diogenianus was also the author of an &quot;Anthology of epigrams about rivers, lakes, cliffs, mountains and mountain ridges&quot; (Ἐπιγραμμάτων ἀνθολόγιον περὶ ποταμῶν λιμνῶν κρηνῶν ὀρῶν ἀκρωρειῶν), a list (with map) of all the towns in the world (Συναγωγὴ καὶ πίναξ τῶν ἐν πάσῃ τῇ γῇ πόλεων)., and of a list of rivers (περὶ ποταμῶν κατὰ στοιχεῖον ἐπίτομος ἀναγραφή)

Erasmus in his &quot;Adagia&quot; (1508) attributes to Diogenianus the origins of the Latin proverb &quot;piscem natare doces&quot; (teach fish how to swim; Greek: Ἰχθὺν νήχεσθαι διδάσκεις).

Diogenianus is the first person known to have referred to the parable of The Dog in the Manger.

<text>Pamphilus of [[Alexandria]] (; fl. 1st century AD) was a Greek grammarian, of the school of Aristarchus of Samothrace.

He was the author of a comprehensive lexicon, in 95 books, of foreign or obscure words, the idea of which was credited to another grammarian, Zopyrion, himself the compiler of the first four books. The work itself is lost, but an epitome by Diogenianus (2nd century) formed the basis of the lexicon of Hesychius.

A similar compilation, called &quot;meadow&quot; (cf. the &quot;Prata&quot; of Suetonius) from its varied contents, dealing chiefly with mythological marvels, was probably a supplement to the lexicon, although some scholars identify them. Pamphilus was one of the chief authorities used by Athenaeus in the &quot;Deipnosophists&quot;. The &quot;Suda&quot; assigns to another Pamphilus, simply described as &quot;a philosopher,&quot; a number of works, some of which were probably by Pamphilus the grammarian.

<text>Ephedra distachya is a shrub in the family Ephedraceae that stands about 25 cm to 50 cm high. The shrub grows in many parts of the world, including southern and central Europe and western and central Asia. Its local names include &quot;somlatha&quot;. Ephedra distachya lives on grey dunes which are fixed and stable sand dunes that are covered in continuous vegetation.

==Subspecies==
#&quot;Ephedra distachya&quot; subsp. &quot;distachya&quot; – central + southern Europe, southwestern + central Asia
#&quot;Ephedra distachya&quot; subsp. &quot;helvetica&quot; – Switzerland, France, Italy, Slovenia, Austria

==History==
&quot;Ephedra&quot; is part of a group of plants called ‘gnetophytes’. These plants have hardly changed in the past 100 million years, and are thought to be relics of an ancient flora. The leaves of &quot;Ephedra&quot; are tiny and scale-like. Gnetophyte leaves evolved independently from leaves in flowering plants. &quot;Ephedra&quot; produces the alkaloid ephedrine, which has been shown to interfere with insect thermoregulation and may also have effects on insect neurotransmitters. This may be the method by which the plant deters insect herbivores.

==Uses==

&quot;Ephedra distachya&quot; is used to relieve acute muscular and rheumatic pains (when it is called &quot;teamsters&#x27; tea&quot;), as a stimulant, and in the cardio tonics in Ayurveda. It is sometimes identified with the legendary drug soma, as described in the Avesta and the Rig Veda, the respective ancient sacred texts of the Zoroastrian and Hindu faiths.

Ephedrine, an alkaloid, is obtained from its dried branches and is used as a stimulant, often to control asthma. It was isolated from the plant by Nagayoshi Nagai in 1885. All parts of the plant contain up to 3% ephedrine.

== Side effects ==
Although Ephedra has many benefits, it has side effects including insomnia and a fast heart rate.

<doc id="153244" wikidata="Q302511" url="?curid=153244" title="Heraclea Pontica">
<text>Heraclea Pontica (; ; , ), known in Byzantine and later times as Pontoheraclea (), was an ancient city on the coast of Bithynia in Asia Minor, at the mouth of the river Lycus. It was founded by the Greek city-state of Megara in approximately 560–558 BC and was named after Heracles who the Greeks believed entered the underworld at a cave on the adjoining Archerusian cape. The site is now the location of the modern city Karadeniz Ereğli, in the Zonguldak Province of Turkey.

The colonists soon subjugated the native Mariandynians but agreed to terms that none of the latter, now helot-like serfs, be sold into slavery outside their homeland. Prospering from the rich, fertile adjacent lands and the sea-fisheries of its natural harbor, Heraclea soon extended its control along the coast as far east as Cytorus (Gideros, near Cide), eventually establishing Black Sea colonies of its own (Cytorus, Callatis and Chersonesus). It was the birthplace of the philosopher Heraclides Ponticus.

The prosperity of the city, rudely shaken by the Galatians and the Bithynians, was utterly destroyed in the Mithridatic Wars.

The Greek historical author Memnon of Heraclea (fl. 1st century AD) wrote a local history of Heraclea Pontica in at least sixteen books. The work has perished, but Photius&#x27;s &quot;Bibliotheca&quot; preserves a compressed account of books 9–16, seemingly the only ones extant in his day. These books run from the rule of the tyrant Clearchus (c. 364–353 BC) to the later years of Julius Caesar (c. 40 BC) and contain many colorful accounts including the Bithynian introduction of the barbarian Gauls into Asia where they first allied themselves with the Heracleans and later turned violently against them.

Then, Heraclea Pontica was part of the (Eastern) Roman Empire for more than 1000 years. The Turks ravaged the area after the Battle of Mantzikert in 1071. David Komnenos, brother of the ruler of Trebizond Alexios I of Trebizond, took Heraclea Pontica in 1205 and made it capital of his domain, called Paphlagonia; he lost it in 1214 to Theodore I Laskaris, who made it a major frontier bulwark. The Genoese had a colony there after 1261. When the Turks conquered Paphlagonia in 1360, Genoa bought the city from the weakening Byzantine Empire. Heraclea developed as a trading centre of the Genoese, who settled there in large numbers. A ruined citadel on a height overlooking the town is a remnant of this period. The Italian name of the city was Pontarachia. The Genoese held the city until the Ottomans captured it after 1453.

<text>WH Smith PLC, trading as WHSmith (also written WH Smith, and known colloquially as Smith&#x27;s and formerly as W. H. Smith &amp; Son), is a British retailer, with headquarters in Swindon, England, which operates a chain of high street, railway station, airport, port, hospital and motorway service station shops selling books, stationery, magazines, newspapers, entertainment products and confectionery.

The company was formed by Henry Walton Smith and his wife Anna in 1792 as a news vendor in London. It remained under the ownership of the Smith family for many years and saw large-scale expansion during the 1970s as the company began to diversify into other markets. Following a rejected private equity takeover in 2004, the company began to focus on its core retail business. It was responsible for the creation of the ISBN book identifier.

WHSmith is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index.

==History==
===Formation===

In 1792, Henry Walton Smith and his wife Anna established the business as a news vendor in Little Grosvenor Street, London. After their deaths, the business — valued in 1812 at £1,280 () — was taken over by their youngest son William Henry Smith, and in 1846 the firm became W. H. Smith &amp; Son when his only son, also named William Henry, became a partner. The firm took advantage of the railway boom by opening news-stands on railway stations, beginning with Euston in 1848. In 1850, the firm opened depots in Birmingham, Manchester and Liverpool. It also ran a circulating library service, from 1860 to 1961, and a publishing business based at the Steam Press, Cirencester. The younger W. H. Smith used the success of the firm as a springboard into politics, becoming a Member of Parliament (MP) in 1868 and serving as a minister in several Conservative governments.

After the death of W. H. Smith the younger in 1891, his widow was created Viscountess Hambleden in her own right; their son inherited the business from his father and the viscountcy from his mother. After the death of the second Viscount in 1928, the business was reconstituted as a limited company, in which his son, the third Viscount, owned all the ordinary shares. On the death of the third Viscount in 1948, the death duties were so large that a public holding company had to be formed and shares sold to WH Smith staff and the public. A younger brother of the third Viscount remained chairman until 1972, but the Smith family&#x27;s control slipped away, and the last family member left the board in 1996.

In 1966, WHSmith originated a nine-digit code for uniquely referencing books, called Standard Book Numbering or SBN. It was adopted as international standard ISO 2108 in 1970, and was used until 1974, when it became the ISBN scheme.

===Expansion===
From the 1970s, WHSmith began to expand into other retail sectors. WH Smith Travel operated from 1973 to 1991. The Do It All chain of DIY shops originated with an acquisition in 1979, becoming a joint venture with Boots in 1990; Boots acquired WHSmith&#x27;s share in June 1996. The bookshop chain Waterstone&#x27;s, founded by former WHSmith executive Tim Waterstone in 1982, was bought in 1989 and sold in 1998.

The expanding WHSmith group adopted a new &quot;house style&quot; or corporate identity in 1973, with a new logo and a change of name from W. H. Smith &amp; Son to WHSmith. The new hexagon-shaped logo featured the initials of the group on the sides of a box employing a new orange and brown colour scheme, replacing a logo that had been in use since before 1830. This updated visual identity extended throughout the company&#x27;s operations, specified by a design manual, covering everything from the appropriate use of the logo in retail environments, through the design of decorative elements on wrapping paper and promotional material, the layout of stationery, labels and forms, and even crockery, also informing the design of staff uniforms and packaging.

In 1986, WHSmith bought a 75% controlling share of the Our Price music retail chain; in the 1990s it also bought other music retailers including the Virgin Group&#x27;s smaller (non-Megastore) shops. The 75% share of Virgin Our Price was sold to Virgin Retail Group Ltd in July 1998 for £145m. WHSmith also owned the American record chain The Wall, which was sold to Camelot Music in 1998.

In March 1998, the company acquired John Menzies&#x27;s retail outlets for £68m, which for many years had been the main rival to the company&#x27;s railway-station outlets. This purchase also cleared the way for WHSmith&#x27;s retail expansion into Scotland. Prior to the takeover, Menzies&#x27;s larger Scottish shops (carrying a very similar range of products to High Street WHSmith shops elsewhere) dominated the market, and the latter&#x27;s presence was minimal.

===Restructuring===
For several years, the company&#x27;s retail arm had difficulties competing with specialist book and music chains on one side and large supermarkets on the other. This led to poor financial performance, and a takeover bid in 2004 by Permira, which fell through. The company reacted to this by disposing of its overseas subsidiaries and its publishing business Hodder Headline, in order to concentrate on reforming its core businesses.

In August 2006, the company demerged the retail and news distribution arms of the business into two separate companies: WH Smith plc (retail) and Smiths News plc (newspaper and magazine distribution). In September 2010 WHSmith bought The Gadget Shop from The Entertainer. That year, it also bought online greeting card retailer Funky Pigeon.

===Since 2011===

In April 2011, WHSmith agreed a deal with the legal services provider QualitySolicitors under which QualitySolicitors would place representatives in up to 500 of its UK branches. Past Times went into administration in January 2012, and the brand name was bought by WHSmith in March 2013.

In October 2013, WHSmith announced that it had bought the ModelZone brand and would sell products under this brand through existing WHSmith shops.&lt;ref name=&quot;twitter 13/11/13&quot;&gt;Tweet by @ModelZone on 13/11/13, &quot;Twitter&quot;. &quot;9 more to open by 23/11/13 in the following locations- CARDIFF, CROYDON, GATESHEAD METRO, GLASGOW SAUCHIEHALL...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2014, WHSmith announced as part of its preliminary statement that it was planning on extending its greetings card offering by launching the low-price brand &quot;Cardmarket&quot; on a trial basis. According to the statement, these trial shops would be in low rent areas and let to WHSmith under short-term leases. The company announced in late 2018 that the trial of Cardmarket would be wound up, with the closure of the Cardmarket stores. This was in addition to the announcement of the closure for at least six WHSmith stores which were deemed economically unviable following a strategic business review.

Late in 2017, the company purchased Cult Pens, a UK-based online retailer of specialist pens, for an undisclosed amount.

In 2018, WHSmith acquired the brand InMotion, the largest airport-based electronics retailer in the US. InMotion expanded to operate stores within UK airports including Heathrow, Manchester and Birmingham, as well as overseas in Spain and Australia.

In July 2020, WHSmith announced more than 150 redundancies at its head office, representing approximately 18% of the head office workforce. In November 2020, the company announced that, after a loss of £280 million, it had decided to close 25 stores in the country, noting that eight stores had been closed in 2019.

In August 2020, WHSmith launched a new flagship store in Terminal 2 at Heathrow Airport, in collaboration with Well, which features an in-house pharmacy.

WHSmith announced in June 2023 that it would not be opening any more stores on High Streets in the UK and would instead add stores in airports, railway stations and in the United States and Europe. Also in June, toy retailer Toys &quot;R&quot; Us announced plans to open nine concessions in WHSmith stores, marking the return of the brand&#x27;s physical presence in the UK after its own stores closed in 2018.

In December 2023, the logo was changed as part of a rebranding trial. The changed stores, which included those in York, Canterbury and Preston, dropped the word &quot;Smith&quot; in favour of &quot;WHS&quot;.

In January 2025, WHSmith was reported to be in talks to sell its high street business, with around 500 stores and the partnership with Toys &quot;R&quot; Us. The more profitable travel retail business (which has shops in railway stations, airports, ports, hospitals and on motorways) would be unaffected by this.

==Television==
WHSmith founded one of the UK&#x27;s earliest cable television channels, Lifestyle, which was carried on almost every cable system in the UK and Ireland prior to the start of Sky Television in 1989. By late 1984, the company had bought a 15% stake in Screensport and from January 1986, took over the operations and management when ABC and R Kennedy pulled out. Both channels were closed in 1993.

==Operations==
===United Kingdom===
Since 2007, the company has taken on a number of Post Office branches, mainly within its high street shops. By April 2016, this had reached 107, including former Crown Post Offices, with plans for an additional 61.

WHSmith also operate a number of shops within hospitals, following its acquisition of Yorkshire-based newsagent chain United News in March 2008.

In addition to its existing joint ventures and franchise shops, the company trialled the smaller format, convenience-based WHSmith Local concept during 2013. Targeted at independent newsagents and post office business owners, a total of 40 such stores were trading and a further 40 planned by the time the 2015 annual report had been published.

Since 2011, the company has also opened shops using its Funky Pigeon brand and subsidiary Funky Pigeon.com Ltd which offers stationery and personalised greetings cards both online and via stores. In 2024, WHSmith announced that they had reached an exclusive agreement with Toys R Us owner WHP Global to open Toys R Us concessions inside its stores.
===International===
Canadian operations initially began in 1950. By 1970, there were 14 stores in Canada. They continued until 1989, when they were sold to domestic owners and renamed SmithBooks. SmithBooks later merged with Coles, forming Chapters, which retained the Coles and SmithBooks names and locations while also opening new namesake superstores. Many SmithBooks locations were eventually closed or converted to Coles; a few locations still retain the name as of 2013.

In 2018, WHSmith re-entered the Canadian and American markets through its acquisition of Airport Electronics Retailer InMotion and Marshall Retail Group in 2019. As of 2024, WHSmith owns 320 stores in North America.

By 1970, WHSmith had one retail store in both Brussels and Paris. The company retains one shop on Rue de Rivoli in the centre of Paris, France. However the store in Paris is now branded as Smith &amp; Son.

The company acquired Whitcoulls and Bennetts in New Zealand and Angus &amp; Robertson in Australia in 2001 with plans to convert Whitcoulls to WHSmith. However they were later sold off along with those in Hong Kong International Airport (now as Page One) and in Singapore at Changi Airport, in 2004 (now Times Travel under the Times Bookstores banner).

WHSmith restarted its Australian operations in March 2011 following the collapse of Angus &amp; Robertson/Borders who held the naming rights in Australia. The first new shop was opened at Melbourne Airport, in the international departures terminal. There are now three outlets at Melbourne Airport, three at Southern Cross railway station and one within Melbourne Central.

WHSmith has opened shops in major Indian airports. WHSmith is currently in the process of planning 30 kiosk shops in China. Currently, WHSmith sponsor the IPL cricket team (Sunrisers Hyderabad) (SRH) in India.

In October 2008, WHSmith, together with SSP, opened five branches within Copenhagen Airport, and in April 2009, opened a branch in Stockholm-Arlanda Airport. In 2009, WHSmith opened two shops in Shannon Airport, County Clare, Ireland. A further three shops are operated in Dublin Airport&#x27;s Terminal Two, which opened in November 2010 and 5 shops in Dublin Airport&#x27;s Terminal One, which opened in 2013. The chain promised when winning this latter contract to hire a full-time Irish book buyer; however, the appointment of an Australian, based in London and not in Dublin, drew adverse criticism.

In 2013, it opened an additional four shops at Dublin Airport&#x27;s Terminal 1. Eason&#x27;s, currently at T1 in Dublin, asked the airport operator to tender for a new contract one year earlier as the retailer blamed a fall in sales on the success of Terminal 2 at Dublin, which carried the majority of long haul traffic and long haul passengers tend to spend more on books.

WHSmith opened four branches in Helsinki Airport, Finland in late 2016 and early 2017.

The company has a shop in Malta International Airport which was opened in 2016 under a franchise agreement with Miller Distributors.

==Controversies==
On 19 June 2009, WHSmith apologised after promoting a book on cellar rapist Josef Fritzl as one of the &quot;Top 50 Books for Dad&quot; as a Father&#x27;s Day gift.

In October 2012, WHSmith faced criticism from shooters after the sale of shooting magazines to children under 14 was banned, although it is legal for children under 14 to go shooting. The decision appeared to follow a campaign by animal rights activists. The British Association for Shooting and Conservation (BASC) campaigned against the ban, including a 12,000+ signature petition. In mid-November it emerged that the restrictions had been removed from all UK shooting magazines.

On 14 October 2013, WHSmith took their website offline because &quot;unacceptable titles were appearing on their website&quot;. These were e-books with themes of abuse.

The chain was criticised in 2014 for the condition of its shops, with both analysts and customers accusing the chain of under-investing in its estate.

In 2015, an investigation by &quot;The Independent&quot; revealed that WHSmith and other airport retailers were charging VAT to shoppers travelling outside the European Union, then claiming the VAT back from the government and not passing the refund on to customers. This was made possible by the practice of scanning customer&#x27;s boarding passes at the till point – solely for the benefit of the company – which made the passengers unwitting accomplices in their own deception. After a public outcry, a customer revolt in which many refused to hand over their boarding passes, and an intervention by Parliament, the company confirmed in March 2017 that it would pass on the VAT reduction to customers spending over £6, who were travelling outside the EU.

In 2015, the company was also criticised for the prices charged in its branches in hospitals, after media investigations found some items to be on sale at significantly higher prices than in high street branches. In May 2018, WHSmith apologised after it was revealed that it had made more than £700 by selling single tubes of toothpaste for £7.99 through its branch in Pinderfields Hospital, Wakefield. The price was described as an &#x27;error&#x27; and WHSmith promised that the proceeds from the sales would be donated to a local charity. The price was restored to £2.49, still more than three times the price of 80p charged in a nearby Tesco.

In 2023, the company was found to have broken the minimum wage law, having failed to pay around £1 million to 17,607 of its workers. The company said that this was because of an error related to its uniform policy, with a spokesperson saying &quot;Following a review with HMRC in 2019, and in common with a number of retailers, it was brought to our attention that we had misinterpreted how the statutory wage regulations were applied to our uniform policy for staff working in our stores. This was a genuine error and it was rectified immediately with all colleagues reimbursed in 2019&quot;.

<doc id="153248" wikidata="Q156665" url="?curid=153248" title="Dipsacaceae">
<text>The Dipsacaceae were recognized as a family (the teasel family) of the order Dipsacales containing 350 species of perennial or biennial herbs and shrubs in eleven genera. It was published by Antoine Laurent de Jussieu in his book &quot;Genera plantarum&quot; on page 194 in 1789.

The family is now regarded as a synonym of the family Caprifoliaceae. Native to most temperate climates, they are found in Europe, Asia, and Africa. Some species of this family have been naturalized in other places. The spikes of the common teasel (pictured) are not particularly spiny and may be quite soft. In some places, the spikes were used in carding wool.

The family has contained these genera;

*&quot;Acanthocalyx&quot;
*&quot;Dipsacus&quot; (teasel)
*&quot;Knautia&quot;
*&quot;Scabiosa&quot;
*&quot;Succisa&quot; (devil&#x27;s bit)
*&quot;Succisella&quot;
*&quot;Morina&quot;—also placed in its own family, Morinaceae
*&quot;Cephalaria&quot;
*&quot;Pterocephalus&quot;
*&quot;Pycnocomon&quot;

<doc id="153250" wikidata="Q426113" url="?curid=153250" title="Fowler's solution">
<text>Fowler&#x27;s solution is a solution containing 1% potassium arsenite (KAsO2) which was first described and published as a treatment for malaria and syphilis in the late 1700s and was once prescribed as a remedy or a tonic. Thomas Fowler (1736–1801) of Stafford, England, proposed the solution in 1786 as a substitute for a patent medicine, &quot;tasteless ague drop&quot;. From 1865, Fowler&#x27;s solution was a leukemia treatment.

From 1905, inorganic arsenicals like Fowler&#x27;s solution saw diminished use as attention turned to organic arsenicals, starting with Atoxyl.

As arsenical compounds are notably toxic and carcinogenic—with side effects such as cirrhosis of the liver, idiopathic portal hypertension, urinary bladder cancer, and skin cancers—Fowler&#x27;s solution fell from use. (In 2001, however, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a drug of arsenic trioxide to treat acute promyelocytic leukaemia, and interest in arsenic has returned.)

<text>Samson () is the largest uninhabited island of the Isles of Scilly, off the southwestern tip of the Cornish peninsula of Great Britain. It is in size. The island consists of two hills, North Hill and South Hill, which are connected by an isthmus. Samson was named after Samson of Dol.

==History==
The twin hills of Samson were formerly associated with breasts, in a similar way to the Paps of Jura in Scotland and the Paps of Anu in Ireland. There are large ancient burial grounds both on the North Hill and South Hill.

The first written evidence for the habitation of Samson comes from the Interregnum Survey of 1651–1652, where it was recorded that:

The two most prominent families on Samson, the Woodcocks and the Webbers, allegedly first settled Samson after they came into conflict with two other local families, the Banfields and the Mumfords, who had ordered them to leave their homes and move to Hugh Town. The Woodcocks and Webbers instead opted to move to Samson.

During the 18th century, Samson was used as sort-of penal colony by the Council of Twelve, the local administration at the time. Local &quot;undesirables&quot; would be banished to the island.

The island was inhabited until 1855, when the Lord Proprietor Augustus Smith removed the remaining population from the island. By this point, the population was found to be suffering from severe deprivation—particularly due to a diet of limpets and potatoes—and consisted of only two families: the Woodcocks and the Webbers. Smith then built a deer park on the island, but the deer escaped from their stone walled enclosure, and some attempted to wade across to Tresco (at low tide). In August 1933 a major fire occurred which was put out by the staff of Major Dorrien-Smith, by digging ditches to stop the spread.

In recent times the area has become a protected wildlife site. The island is home to many different birds, such as terns and gannets, and many wild flowers. In 1971 the island, along with the nearby islands of Green Island, Puffin Island, Stony Island and White Island, was designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) for its biological characteristics.

===Population===
* 1669: one family
* 1715: only three men fit to carry arms
* 1751: two households
* 1794: six households
* 1816: forty people
* 1822: seven households (thirty-four people)
* 1851: three households
* 1855: Augustus Smith removed the remaining inhabitants which consisted of two families.

==Visiting the island==
Boat trips to Samson are regularly available May through to September. There is no quay, so visitors disembark via wooden plank. The remains of the old cottages can be explored, and there are also the remains of Smith&#x27;s deer park and prehistoric entrance graves. There are no amenities or services available, but guided walks are led by local experts.

==Literary associations==
The island is featured in the children&#x27;s story &quot;Why the Whales Came&quot; by Michael Morpurgo. In the book, Samson is under a curse that needs to be lifted. The island also featured in &quot;Armorel of Lyonesse&quot; by Walter Besant. Webber&#x27;s Cottage supposedly features in that novel as Armorel&#x27;s house.

In some medieval versions of the Tristan and Iseult story, Tristan defeats and kills the knight Morholt, uncle of Iseult and brother-in-law of the King of Ireland, at an island called St Samson which is now identified either with the Scilly Isles Samson or with an islet in the Fowey estuary.

Dougie Blaxland&#x27;s play &quot;Leaving Samson&quot; (1996) is about the last inhabitants and their removal from the island.
