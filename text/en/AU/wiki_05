<text>Seven Mary Three (occasionally abbreviated to 7 Mary 3 or 7M3) is an American rock band. They released seven studio albums and one live album, and are best known for their hit single &quot;Cumbersome&quot;.

==Career==
===Formation===
Seven Mary Three formed in 1992 when Jason Ross and Jason Pollock met while attending The College of William &amp; Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia. Ross and Pollock split songwriting duties with Ross on lead vocals and rhythm guitar and Pollock on lead guitar and backing vocals. Bassist Casey Daniel and drummer Giti Khalsa joined the two, and the band began playing in coffeehouses and clubs.

===Origin of group name===
Guitarist Jason Pollock revealed in &quot;The Cavalier Daily&quot; that they came up with the name while watching the 1970s TV series &quot;CHiPs&quot;. &#x27;7 Mary 3&#x27; was the call sign for Officer Jon Baker, played by actor Larry Wilcox. (7M3: police radio call sign; 7 designates the patrol beat, M for Mary designates that he is a motorcycle unit and 3 is his unit number.) Pollock noted, &quot;There&#x27;s no great significance or anything. We were just tired of trying to think of a cool name.&quot;

===Mainstream success===
In 1994 the band released the album &quot;Churn&quot; independently. The album garnered the band airplay on WJRR 101.1 FM, a rock station in Orlando, Florida, for the future hit single &quot;Cumbersome&quot;. Given this minor success, the band relocated to the Orlando area where they continued to expand their fan base. This regional success soon caught the attention of major-label scouts. In May 1995, Ross, Pollock, and Khalsa graduated from William &amp; Mary and moved to Florida. The band signed with Mammoth and re-recorded the songs on &quot;Churn&quot;, plus two new ones, to create the commercially successful &quot;American Standard&quot; in 1995. Despite some critics accusing the band of mimicking Pearl Jam and other alternative rock acts, only seven months after its release, &quot;American Standard&quot; achieved platinum status. This accomplishment can be attributed to the success of &quot;Cumbersome,&quot; which was a Top 40 hit, as well as another single, &quot;Water&#x27;s Edge&quot;, which fared well on the rock charts.

After touring throughout 1996, the band returned to the studio for a follow-up to &quot;American Standard&quot;. During this time, Mammoth and Atlantic split, forcing Seven Mary Three to sign with Atlantic Records, releasing &quot;RockCrown&quot; in 1997. The album saw the band de-emphasize hard rock, focusing more on acoustic folk rock and a &quot;traditional singer/songwriter&quot; style. &quot;RockCrown&quot; did not match fan expectations, reaching No. 75 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and failing to match the success of its predecessor.

A second effort under Atlantic, &quot;Orange Ave.&quot; debuted the following year and charted considerably lower; although, its single &quot;Over Your Shoulder&quot; performed moderately.

In 1999, Jason Pollock left the band after suffering from burnout and writer&#x27;s block. Thomas Juliano was chosen as the band&#x27;s new guitarist. In the summer of 2001, Seven Mary Three returned to Mammoth Records and producer Tom Morris. The resulting effort became &quot;The Economy of Sound&quot;. This fifth studio album included the single &quot;Wait&quot;, a track that served as the lead single from the &quot;Crazy/Beautiful film soundtrack&quot;.

After &quot;The Economy of Sound&quot;, the group shifted once again to DRT Entertainment and, in 2004, released &quot;Dis/Location&quot;. Their sixth studio album, it failed entirely to chart as did its only single. Four years later, a seventh album, &quot;Day &amp; Nightdriving&quot;, was released under Bellum Records.

Giti Khalsa left the band in 2006 after recording the drum tracks for &quot;Day &amp; Nightdriving&quot;, and Mike Levesque joined the band on drums.

In December 2008, the group re-released their long out-of-print debut album &quot;Churn&quot;. On February 9, 2010, Seven Mary Three released the live acoustic album &quot;Backbooth&quot;.

Seven Mary Three broke up suddenly in December 2012, without any announcements or updates to their website or Facebook page. The following year, Jason Ross became the head of media and strategic partnerships for The Bowery Presents, one of New York&#x27;s most powerful music production companies.

On December 15, 2021, Seven Mary Three’s Facebook page was updated for the first time since 2012, with a link to a website called High Shelter, where Jason Ross addressed the hiatus, the current status of the band, and the future plans.

On October 4, 2023, Seven Mary Three released the song “Settle Up” as single for the re-issue of their 2004 album &quot;Dis/Location&quot;.

<text>Proteinuria is the presence of excess proteins in the urine. In healthy persons, urine contains very little protein, less than 150 mg/day; an excess is suggestive of illness. Excess protein in the urine often causes the urine to become foamy (although this symptom may also be caused by other conditions). Severe proteinuria can cause nephrotic syndrome in which there is worsening swelling of the body.

==Signs and symptoms==
Proteinuria often causes no symptoms and it may only be discovered incidentally.

Foamy urine is considered a cardinal sign of proteinuria, but only a third of people with foamy urine have proteinuria as the underlying cause. It may also be caused by bilirubin in the urine (bilirubinuria), retrograde ejaculation, pneumaturia (air bubbles in the urine) due to a fistula, or drugs such as pyridium.

== Causes ==
There are three main mechanisms to cause proteinuria:
* Due to disease in the glomerulus
* Because of increased quantity of proteins in serum (overflow proteinuria)
* Due to low reabsorption at proximal tubule (Fanconi syndrome)

Proteinuria can also be caused by certain biological agents, such as bevacizumab (Avastin) used in cancer treatment. Excessive fluid intake (drinking in excess of 4 litres of water per day) is another cause.

Proteinuria may be a sign of renal (kidney) damage. Since serum proteins are readily reabsorbed from urine, the presence of excess protein indicates either an insufficiency of absorption or impaired filtration. People with diabetes may have damaged nephrons and develop proteinuria. The most common cause of proteinuria is diabetes, and in any person with proteinuria and diabetes, the cause of the underlying proteinuria should be separated into two categories: diabetic proteinuria versus the field.

With severe proteinuria, general hypoproteinemia can develop which results in
diminished oncotic pressure. Symptoms of diminished oncotic pressure may include ascites, edema and hydrothorax.

===Conditions with proteinuria===

Proteinuria may be a feature of the following conditions:
* Nephrotic syndromes (i.e. intrinsic kidney failure)
* Pre-eclampsia

==Pathophysiology==

Protein is the building block of all living organisms. When kidneys are functioning properly by filtering the blood, they distinguish the proteins from the wastes which were previously present together in the blood. Thereafter, kidneys retain or reabsorb the filtered proteins and return them to the circulating blood while removing wastes by excreting them in the urine. Whenever the kidney is compromised, their ability to filter the blood by differentiating protein from the waste, or retaining the filtered protein then returning which back to the body, is damaged. As a result, there is a significant amount of protein to be discharged along with waste in the urine that makes the concentration of proteins in urine high enough to be detected by medical machine.

Medical testing equipment has improved over time, and as a result tests are better able to detect smaller quantities of protein. Protein in urine is considered normal as long as the value remains within the normal reference range. Variation exists between healthy patients, and it is generally considered harmless for the kidney to fail to retain a few proteins in the blood, letting those protein discharge from the body through urine.

===Albumin and immunoglobins===

Albumin is a protein produced by the liver which makes up roughly 50%-60% of the total proteins in the blood while the other 40%-50% are proteins other than albumin, such as immunoglobins. This is why the concentration of albumin in the urine is one of the single sensitive indicators of kidney disease, particularly for those with diabetes or hypertension, compared to routine proteinuria examination.

As the loss of proteins from the body progresses, the suffering will gradually become symptomatic.

The exception applies to the scenario when there&#x27;s an overproduction of proteins in the body, in which the kidney is not to blame.

==Diagnosis==

Conventionally, proteinuria is diagnosed by a simple dipstick test, although it is possible for the test to give a false negative reading, even with nephrotic range proteinuria if the urine is dilute. False negatives may also occur if the protein in the urine is composed mainly of globulins or Bence Jones proteins because the reagent on the test strips, bromophenol blue, is highly specific for albumin. Traditionally, dipstick protein tests would be quantified by measuring the total quantity of protein in a 24-hour urine collection test, and abnormal globulins by specific requests for protein electrophoresis. Trace results may be produced in response to excretion of Tamm–Horsfall mucoprotein.

More recently developed technology detects human serum albumin (HSA) through the use of liquid crystals (LCs). The presence of HSA molecules disrupts the LCs supported on the AHSA-decorated slides thereby producing bright optical signals which are easily distinguishable. Using this assay, concentrations of HSA as low as 15 μg/mL can be detected.

Alternatively, the concentration of protein in the urine may be compared to the creatinine level in a spot urine sample. This is termed the protein/creatinine ratio. The 2005 UK Chronic Kidney Disease guidelines state that protein/creatinine ratio is a better test than 24-hour urinary protein measurement. Proteinuria is defined as a protein/creatinine ratio greater than 45 mg/mmol (which is equivalent to albumin/creatinine ratio of greater than 30 mg/mmol or approximately 300 mg/g) with very high levels of proteinuria having a ratio greater than 100 mg/mmol.

Protein dipstick measurements should not be confused with the amount of protein detected on a test for microalbuminuria which denotes values for protein for urine in mg/day versus urine protein dipstick values which denote values for protein in mg/dL. That is, there is a basal level of proteinuria that can occur below 30 mg/day which is considered non-pathology. Values between 30 and 300 mg/day are termed microalbuminuria which is considered pathologic. Urine protein lab values for microalbumin of &gt;30 mg/day correspond to a detection level within the &quot;trace&quot; to &quot;1+&quot; range of a urine dipstick protein assay. Therefore, positive indication of any protein detected on a urine dipstick assay obviates any need to perform a urine microalbumin test as the upper limit for microalbuminuria has already been exceeded.

===Analysis===
It is possible to analyze urine samples in determining albumin, hemoglobin and myoglobin with an optimized MEKC method.

==Treatment==
Treating proteinuria mainly needs proper diagnosis of the cause.
The most common cause is diabetic nephropathy; in this case, proper glycemic control may slow the progression. Medical management consists of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, which are typically first-line therapy for proteinuria. In patients whose proteinuria is not controlled with ACE inhibitors, the addition of an aldosterone antagonist (i.e., spironolactone) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) may further reduce protein loss. Caution must be used if these agents are added to ACE inhibitor therapy due to the risk of hyperkalemia.
Proteinuria secondary to autoimmune disease should be treated with steroids or steroid-sparing agent plus the use of ACE inhibitors.

<doc id="148009" wikidata="Q2133871" url="?curid=148009" title="Ray Burke (Irish politician)">
<text>Raphael Patrick Burke (born 30 September 1943) is an Irish former Fianna Fáil politician who served as Minister for Foreign Affairs from June 1997 to October 1997, Minister for Justice from 1989 to 1992, Minister for Communications from 1987 to 1991, Minister for Industry and Commerce from 1988 to 1989, Minister for Energy from 1987 to 1988, Minister for the Environment from March 1982 to December 1982 and 1980 to 1981 and Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy from 1979 to 1980. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) from 1973 to 1997.

==Early life==
Burke was born in Dublin. He was educated at O&#x27;Connell School, and he went on to study at University College Cork, before becoming an auctioneer. Burke&#x27;s political career commenced when he was elected to Dublin County Council for Fianna Fáil in 1967. He was chairman of the council from 1985 to 1987.

==Career==
Burke was elected to Dáil Éireann at the 1973 general election for the Dublin County North constituency, succeeding his father Patrick Burke, who had held the seat for 29 years. Ray Burke represented this constituency and its successor Dublin North until his resignation almost twenty-five years later.

After Fianna Fáil&#x27;s landslide victory at the 1977 general election, Burke was appointed Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce. He supported George Colley in the Fianna Fáil leadership contest of 1979, but after Colley&#x27;s opponent Charles Haughey won out, Haughey retained Burke in his government position. Burke was subsequently a staunch and vocal defender of Haughey during several internal heaves against the latter&#x27;s leadership of the party. In October 1980, Burke was promoted to Minister for the Environment, a position he held until June 1981 and again in the short-lived Fianna Fáil government of 1982. After Fianna Fáil returned to power at the 1987 general election, Burke served as Minister for Energy, where he made controversial changes to the legislation governing oil and gas exploration. In 1988, he was appointed Minister for Industry, Commerce and Communications.

Following the formation of the Fianna Fáil–Progressive Democrats coalition in 1989, he was appointed as Minister for Justice and Minister for Communications in the government of Charles Haughey. When Albert Reynolds succeeded Haughey in 1992, he did not re-appoint Burke to the cabinet. Following the 1997 general election, Fianna Fáil was back in office, and Burke was appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs, by Taoiseach Bertie Ahern.

==Corruption allegations==
Within months of his appointment as Minister for Foreign Affairs, allegations resurfaced that Burke had received IR£80,000 from a property developer regarding the former Dublin County Council. Burke denied the allegations but resigned from the cabinet and the Dáil, on 7 October 1997, after just four months in office. This allegation led to the setting up of the Planning Tribunal chaired by Justice Feargus Flood. In an interim report of the Tribunal, Flood judged Burke to be &quot;corrupt&quot;.

After Burke&#x27;s re-election in 1989, he had made it clear in interviews that he believed that RTÉ, the national broadcaster, was biased against him and Fianna Fáil in its election coverage, and several RTÉ employees reported that while off-air at RTÉ&#x27;s election coverage, he remarked &quot;I&#x27;m going to fucking screw RTÉ&quot;. After the election he was appointed Minister for Justice, while retaining the Communications brief.

Burke was responsible for controversial legislation that severely limited RTÉ&#x27;s ability to collect advertising revenue and allowed for the establishment of a series of local radio stations and one independent national radio station, Century Radio. RTÉ were ordered to provide a national transmission service for Century Radio at a price that RTÉ complained was far below the economic cost of providing such a service. For example, they were required by the service level agreement to have engineers on standby covering the entire country 24 hours a day, when the final payment for the entire transmission service was roughly equal to the salary for just one engineer.

Nevertheless, Century Radio failed to gain a significant audience share and closed in 1991. An interim report of the Flood Tribunal found as fact that the backers of Century Radio had paid large bribes to Burke to secure favourable ministerial decisions. One of the local stations established was 98FM and in 2006 its owner, businessman Denis O&#x27;Brien won a record €750,000 damages from the Irish &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; which had claimed that O&#x27;Brien had paid a bribe of IR£30,000 to Burke to secure a licence for the station.

==Prison time==
In July 2004, Burke pleaded guilty to making false tax returns. The charges arose from his failure to declare for tax purposes the payments that he had received from the backers of Century Radio. On 24 January 2005, he was sentenced to six months in prison for these offences, making him one of the most senior Irish politicians to serve time in prison. He was released in June 2005, after four and a half months, earning a 25% remission of sentence because of good behaviour. He served his time in Arbour Hill Prison in Dublin.

==Retirement==
Burke has maintained a low profile since completing his prison sentence but attended the state funeral of Charles Haughey in June 2006, his political patron. Several former associates of Burke, from his days as a member of Dublin County Council, continue to be the subjects of tribunals of inquiry set up to investigate irregularities in the planning process in Dublin.

Burke is entitled to two public service pensions, one as a former TD at the maximum rate for over 20 years&#x27; service, and another as a former Minister. His barrister at his 2005 sentencing hearing stated these were his only income. As well as general criticism that such pensions are overly generous, Burke&#x27;s continued receipt of these pensions while in prison and after his condemnation in the Flood report attracted criticism. Their combined income value was €66,000 in 2003 and €103,838 in 2011.

<doc id="148011" wikidata="Q36814" url="?curid=148011" title="Siwi language">
<text>Siwi (also known as Siwan or Siwa Berber; native name: ) is the easternmost Berber language, spoken in the western Egyptian desert by an estimated 15,000 to 20,000 people in the oases of Siwa and Gara, near the Libyan border.

Siwi is the normal language of daily communication among the Egyptian Berbers of Siwa and Gara, but because it is not taught at local schools, used in the media nor recognised by the Egyptian government, its long-term survival may be threatened by contacts with outsiders and by the use of Egyptian Arabic in mixed marriages; nearly all Siwis today learn to speak Egyptian Arabic as a second language from an early age.

Siwi has been heavily influenced by Arabic, notably Egyptian and Bedouin, but also earlier stages of Arabic.

Siwi is the only Berber language indigenous to Egypt and is natively spoken further east than any other Berber variety of North Africa. Within Berber, it stands out for a number of unusual linguistic features, including the collapse of gender distinctions in the plural, the absence of dedicated negative forms of the verb, the use of full finite agreement on the verb in subject relativisation, the use of for sentential negation and the borrowing from Arabic of a productive comparative form for adjectives. Siwi also shows a typological feature that is strikingly rare, not only regionally but also worldwide: addressee agreement on demonstratives.

==Classification==
Siwi was traditionally associated with the Zenati subgroup of Berber, following the 15th century historian al-Maqrizi, and Destaing, who treated both as members of a &quot;groupe du Nord&quot;, on the basis of similarities in the verbal system. Vycichl notes that it shares the feature of prefix vowel reduction with Zenati. Aikhenvald and Militarev, followed by &quot;Ethnologue&quot; placed Siwi in an Eastern Berber group, along with Awjila and Sokna in eastern and central Libya. Kossmann links it with Sokna and the Nafusi dialect cluster of western Libya and Tunisia, but not with Awjila. Souag similarly argues, based on shared innovations, that Siwi emerged from a dialect continuum stretching between Nafusi and Sokna that excluded Awjila, and went on to have some influence on Awjila after this dialect continuum&#x27;s breakup.

The &quot;Endangered Languages Project&quot; classifies the Siwa language as vulnerable to extinction, listing a 20% certainty based on compiled evidence.

==Phonology==
As analysed by Naumann, Siwi has a total of 44 phonologically distinctive segments, 38 consonants and 6 vowels.

===Consonants===
The Siwa language contains 38 consonants, each of which can appear either short or long.

;Notes

* are phonetically affricates, not stops.
* can appear as approximants.
* The geminate counterpart of is .

The transcription of these consonants differs somewhat from source to source. Naumann proposes a practical Latin-based transcription inspired by common practice in other Berber languages: pharyngealised consonants are transcribed with an underdot (e.g., for ), postalveolars are written with a hacek (, , for , , ), semivowel as , uvular fricatives as corresponding velars (, ) and epiglottals as , . However, the epiglottals are often instead transcribed as corresponding pharyngeals , , avoiding the danger of mistaking for a vowel, while the voiced postalveolar affricate/fricative is often written as or . All sources transcribe the glottal fricative as .

===Vowels===
Siwi has six phonemic vowels: . The mid vowels and are excluded from word-final position, and is rare. The presence of mid vowels is unusual for a Berber language, and largely reflects Siwi-specific sound changes as well as borrowing from dialectal Arabic; before these changes, the proto-Berber distinction between *i and *e had been neutralized in every environment except before word-final .

==Grammar==
The basic word order of Siwi is subject-verb-object, as in:

Prepositions precede the noun phrase. Within the noun phrase, numerals (except, sometimes, &#x27;one&#x27;) precede the noun quantified, while other modifiers follow the head noun. Demonstratives always follow adjectives or possessive suffixes, and may even follow relative clauses, e.g.:

===Nouns===
Siwi nouns are specified for gender (masculine or feminine) and number (singular or plural; on the occasional occurrence of duals, see Numerical system below). Most nouns incorporate a fixed prefix, usually &quot;a-&quot; for masculine singular (e.g., &#x27;tooth&#x27;), &quot;i-&quot; for masculine plural (e.g., &#x27;teeth&#x27;), &quot;ta-&quot; for feminine singular (e.g., &#x27;intestine&#x27;), &quot;ti-&quot; for feminine plural (e.g., &#x27;intestines&#x27;). Arabic loans often start with invariant &quot;(ə)l-&quot;, usually assimilating to a following coronal, e.g., &#x27;pen&#x27;, &#x27;oil&#x27;. Many nouns also incorporate a suffix, usually feminine singular &quot;-t&quot;, masculine plural &quot;-ən&quot;, feminine plural &quot;-en&quot;, as seen above; Arabic loans often show a feminine singular suffix &quot;-ət&quot; or &quot;-a&quot;, and a feminine plural suffix &quot;-at&quot; or , e.g., &#x27;raven&#x27; vs. &#x27;ravens&#x27;. Pluralization is often also marked on the stem itself by internal changes, e.g., &#x27;jackal&#x27; vs. &#x27;jackals&#x27;, &#x27;bird&#x27; vs. &#x27;birds&#x27;.

In a noun either the last syllable or the second-to-last (penultimate) is stressed, depending on context. The factors determining stress in the noun remain a matter of debate. According to Souag, stress depends essentially on definiteness: definite nouns receive penultimate stress, while indefinites are stressed on the last syllable. Schiattarella argues that the situation is somewhat more complicated: notably, locatives and right detached nouns receive accent on the last syllable, while left detached nouns are stressed on the penultimate.

Unlike most larger Berber languages, Siwi has no state distinction: a noun takes the same form whether used as subject or as object.

===Adjectives===
Siwi adjectives agree with their heads (or their referents) in gender and number, using a subset of the same affixes given above for nouns; for example:

However, agreement is not always complete. Feminine plural nouns often show masculine plural agreement.

Adjectives may be marked with a suffix &quot;-a&quot;, whose function, possibly aspectual, has not yet been conclusively established.

Gradable adjectives with no more than three root consonants form an invariant comparative based on the consonantal template &quot;(ə)CCəC&quot;, originally borrowed from Arabic: thus &#x27;small&#x27; yields &#x27;smaller&#x27;, &#x27;short&#x27; yields &#x27;smaller&#x27;, &#x27;bitter&#x27; yields &#x27;more bitter&#x27;. Adding a suffix to this in turn yields the superlative.

===Demonstratives===
Demonstratives agree with their referent in number and, if singular, in gender; medial demonstratives also agree with the addressee, a typologically unusual type of allocutive agreement. The pronominal demonstratives are as follows:
* &#x27;this&#x27; (proximal): m. , f. , pl. 
* &#x27;this/that&#x27; (medial, speaking to a man): m. , f. , pl. 
* &#x27;this/that&#x27; (medial, speaking to a woman): m. , f. , pl. 
* &#x27;this/that&#x27; (medial, speaking to a group): m. , f. , pl. 
* &#x27;that&#x27; (distal): m. , f. , pl. 

When a demonstrative modifies a noun phrase, it takes a prefix &quot;da-&quot; (&quot;ta-&quot; for feminine singular). To form a presentative (&#x27;here is...&#x27;), it instead takes a prefix &quot;ɣ-&quot;. Placeholders (&#x27;whatsit&#x27;, &#x27;whatchamacallit&#x27;) use the singular distal forms plus &quot;-in&quot; (, ).

Demonstrative adverbials are based on the same series minus referent agreement markers: proximal &quot;-a / -aya&quot;, medial &quot;-ok / -om / -erwən&quot;, distal &quot;-ih&quot;. Locative adverbs (&#x27;here&#x27;, &#x27;there&#x27;) prefix to these &quot;gd-&quot; (or approximate locative &quot;ss-&quot;), while adverbs of manner (&#x27;like this&#x27;, &#x27;like that&#x27;) prefix &quot;ams-&quot;.

===Personal pronouns===
Siwi personal pronouns distinguish number and (in the singular only) gender. 
Siwi is a pro-drop language, so the use of independent forms is relatively limited; instead, agreement markers or referential suffixes usually suffice to make pronominal reference unambiguous. The following table gives the system:

Some subject agreement markers take different forms before indirect object agreement markers, indicated above with dashes on both sides (e.g., &quot;-m-&quot;). 3rd person direct object suffixes take different forms depending on whether they follow another affix or directly follow the stem. After 1Sg subject agreement, second person direct objects are expressed with the corresponding independent pronouns. The special series for &#x27;because of&#x27; (/) is borrowed from Arabic.

===Verbs===
Siwi verbs agree in person, number, and (when singular) gender with their subjects and their indirect objects, and take suffixes marking pronominal objects. The verb &#x27;open&#x27;, for example, is conjugated in the perfective as follows:

In some cases, plural nouns trigger feminine singular agreement.

The order of pronominal affixes on the verb is as follows: (subject)-stem-(subject)-(indirect object)-(direct object), e.g., &#x27;he gave it (m.) to the woman&#x27;.

Siwi verbs are also marked for aspect and mood. The basic stem is used in the imperative and in the irrealis/aorist; the latter normally takes a prefix &quot;ga-&quot; (preceding agreement suffixes), or for suggestives. The perfective form is identical to the stem for most verbs, but in a few is marked by a variable suffixed vowel. The imperfective is formed from the stem by a variety of morphological strategies, including gemination of the second consonant, &quot;t&quot; prefixation, and insertion of an &quot;a&quot;. A special perfect/resultative (unusual within Berber) is formed from the perfective by suffixing &quot;-a&quot; to a fully conjugated perfective verb including any suffixes, changing &quot;ə&quot; in the last syllable to &quot;i&quot;; the same procedure, applied to an imperfective verb, yields the meaning &#x27;while&#x27;. Thus, for example, from the verb &#x27;walk&#x27; Siwi derives:

* perfective &#x27;he walked&#x27;
* resultative &#x27;he has walked&#x27;
* imperfective &#x27;he walks, he is walking, he was walking&#x27;
* imperfective+a &#x27;while he is/was walking&#x27;
* ga+aorist &#x27;he will walk, he would walk&#x27;
* ədda+aorist &#x27;let him walk!&#x27;

Unlike many Berber languages, Siwi has no special verbal morphology for negation; in all aspects and moods, verbs are simply negated with the preverbal particle . The prohibitive (&#x27;do not&#x27;), however, uses the imperfective form of the verb, unlike the imperative which uses the basic stem.

==Numerical system==
The Siwi numerical system is almost entirely borrowed from Arabic; speakers have only retained two traditional Berber numerals, one and two, which are used rather consistently for qualifying nouns but compete with Arabic equivalents for the purpose of counting. The numerals 3-10 have the same form whether used for counting or for qualifying nouns. Numbers 11-19 are described by Naumann (2009) as having two separate forms for counting and qualifying nouns. The table that follows is from Naumann, and (following the source) uses IPA rather than practical transcription.

Some speakers preserve a feminine form for inherited &#x27;two&#x27;, .

A further complication in the numeral system is the systematic use of duals and special bound forms of numerals with units of measurement borrowed from Arabic; thus from &#x27;year&#x27; we get &#x27;two years&#x27; rather than using or , and from &#x27;week&#x27; we get (with rather than for &#x27;three&#x27;).

==Literature==
Siwi is not a written language, in the sense that Siwi people normally write in Standard Arabic. It is, however, the vehicle of a little-documented oral literature. Among the relatively few materials published, four genres are conspicuous: song lyrics or poems, fairy tales, riddles, and proverbs.

===Verse===
Siwi verse is written in rhyme, and is usually associated with song. Sung poetry, or , is performed mainly in bachelors&#x27; gatherings and tends to relate to love, whereas religious poetry () is recited. Malim distinguishes songs, led by one man, from poems, shorter verse works recited antiphonally by groups at weddings; both are accompanied by the music of drums and horns. In previous centuries these songs appear to have been of great symbolic importance to Siwi young men: a civil war in the oasis in 1712 was apparently terminated by a treaty including the stipulation that:

:: &quot;if one of the Western [bachelor farm workers] was singing in a garden, while doing his work there, and stopped, then one of the of the Easterners should begin to sing and finish his song; the Westerner was not allowed to sing once more.&quot;

The earliest Siwi lyrics to be published are those gathered by Bricchetti-Robetti; others have been published in Jawharī and Souag, while Abd Allah and Malim provide several songs and poems in translation. The songs were also studied from a musicological perspective by Schiffer. The following extract from a love song may give an idea of the genre:

===Tales===
A Siwi tale () uses a specific opening formula:
: &#x27;at the door of our courtyard&#x27;

and closes with the formula:
: &#x27;Tale, tale, it has shortened its span. A bundle of goodness to us, a bundle of badness to them.&#x27;

They were typically told by old women to children on evenings to entertain and perhaps to educate them. Since the arrival of television in the oasis, this practice has largely disappeared. Apart from humans and (talking) animals, a common character in such tales is the ogre () or ogress (). The first Siwi tales to appear in print were four short fables gathered from men (&quot;The Jackal and the Ewe&quot;, &quot;The Jackal and the Hyena&quot;, &quot;The Hare, the Jackal, the Hyena, and the Lion&quot;, and &quot;The Magic Ring&quot;) in Laoust. Malim gives two Siwi folk tales (&quot;The Green Cow&quot; and &quot;The King&#x27;s Daughter and the Three Beautiful Girls&quot;) in English translation. Schiattarella transcribes and translates fourteen tales, gathered from women.

===Riddles===
Malim describes riddles as &quot;once the preferred pastime of Siwi women&quot;, who would meet at night to exchange them, but notes that they have largely been superseded by watching television. Few Siwi riddles have been published; Malim gives some twenty, while Schiattarella records four, including:

===Proverbs===
Among existing publications on Siwi, only Malim discusses proverbs in any detail, drawing a distinction between &quot;morals&quot;, timeworn advice in proverbial form, and proverbs proper. Examples of the former include &quot;Wear clothes that others prefer, but eat and drink what you prefer&quot;; of the latter, &quot;A man who sells a cow, and asks for more money for the insect on it&quot; (in his transcription, ), mocking excessive concern about small sums.

<text>Sokna is a small village located between Hønefoss and Krøderen in the municipality of Ringerike, in the county of Buskerud, Norway. Its population is 543.

==Location==
Sokna is located in the valley of Soknedalen, between the Sogna and Verkenselva rivers. Sogna is a small river that starts at the end of Lake Sognevannet in Strømsoddbygda at the top of the valley of Sokndalen and empties into Tyrifjorden. The Verkenselva flows into the Sogna just southeast of Sokna. Norwegian National Road 7 (&quot;RV 7&quot;) runs through the village, as does the Bergen Line which extends between Hønefoss and Hallingdal, although rail trains no longer stop at Sokna.

Sokna is situated close to large open forested areas including Holleia, Brekkebygda and Strømsoddbygda as well as the Ådalsfjella mountain range. It is also not far to Hønefoss (around 23 km) and Norefjell (around 32 km).

==Etymology==
The name of Sokna originated with the Old Norse word &quot;Sókn&quot; meaning parish.

==Lunder Church==

Lunder Church (&quot;Lunder kirke&quot;) situated at the village Sokna is the church of Lunder parish. It is a cruciform church, with an exterior clad with staff panel. Lunder Church dates to 1706 when it was consecrated a new church which was called Our Savior Church. The church was moved to where it now lies at the end of 1750. Renovation and reconstruction took place in 1761. Since then the church has been restored several times, including in the 1880 (architect: Henrik Nissen) and in 1922-1924 (architect:Ole Stein). 

Strømsoddbygde Chapel (&quot;Strømsoddbygda kapell&quot;) is located in the forested area of Strømsoddbygda, approx. 15 km north of Sokna. The church was designed by architect Oddmund Eindride Slaatto (1896-1963) and was built of lumber in 1953. Strømsoddbygda Chapel is an annex of Lunder Church. Both churched belongs under the Norderhov parish, with Norderhov Church as the main church. These churches all belong to the Diocese of Tunsberg.

<text>William Harrison &quot;Jack&quot; Dempsey (June 24, 1895 – May 31, 1983), nicknamed Kid Blackie and The Manassa Mauler, was an American boxer.
Dempsey is ranked sixth on &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of all-time heavyweights and fourth among its Top 100 Greatest Punchers, while in 1950 the Associated Press voted him as the greatest fighter of the past 50 years. He is a member of the International Boxing Hall of Fame, and was in the previous Boxing Hall of Fame.

==Early life and career==
===Early life and family background===
Dempsey was born in Manassa, Colorado and grew up in Colorado, West Virginia, and Utah, in a poor family. His parents were Mary Celia (née Smoot) and Hiram Dempsey, and his ancestry included Scottish, Irish, Cherokee, and a Jewish paternal great-great-grandmother. Both of his parents became Mormon converts.
&quot; “I am basically Irish, with Cherokee blood from both parents, plus a Jewish strain from my father’s great-grandmother.” Jack Dempsey

His grandfather William A. Dempsey, of Logan County, West Virginia, identified his son John Dempsey Jr. of Mud Fork of Island Creek as executor of his last will and testament dated May 1, 1875. Upon payment of his debts and funeral expenses, he directed that his wife Mahulda receive the balance of his personal property while his six children receive an equal share of his real estate. His last will and testament, as witnessed by Estella, John, and Hiram Dempsey, was presented to the Logan County clerk on August 10, 1875.

Hiram and Celia Dempsey, parents to Jack, left West Virginia in 1887. One newspaper referred to them as &quot;active workers&quot; for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

Dempsey was baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, in 1903 following his eighth birthday, the &quot;age of accountability&quot;, according to church doctrine.

Hiram Dempsey and his family returned to Logan County when Jack was a small boy where he was raised until shortly before commencement of his boxing career. Said the &quot;Logan Banner&quot;: &quot;While he was a mere child, they returned to Logan county. Jack remained here until a young man, having been employed by the Gay Coal and Coke Company as late as 1913, and then went west alone to seek pugilistic fortune. He met Jack Kearns on the Pacific coast, from which point his spectacular climb to the pinnacle of the heavyweight division furnished the sport with one of its most romantic episodes.&quot; In January 1924, the &quot;Banner&quot; reported on Dempsey&#x27;s trip from New York to Florida, stating that he &quot;used to call Logan home.&quot; In August 1926, the &quot;Banner&quot; reported how local boxer Bear Cat Clemons sparred two rounds per day with Dempsey at Saratoga Lake, New York, remarking: &quot;When Dempsey and Clemons face each other in the squared circle, it is Logan county versus Logan county.&quot;

&quot;The Banner&quot;, in a small September 1926 item, provided more history about Dempsey&#x27;s Logan County roots: &quot;The Dempsey family at one time lived on Mud Fork and another period near the Logan-Mingo line. Many relatives live in the two counties; and they as well as his former friends have taken pride in his prowess and successes. As a boy Jack and O.D. Avis, sports editor of &quot;The Banner&quot;, used to set up pins in a bowling alley on the Main street corner now occupied by the Logan garage.&quot; In June 1927, former Logan County sheriff Don Chafin traveled to New York City to watch the Dempsey-Sharkey fight. The &quot;Logan Banner&quot; reported: &quot;Mr. Chafin has attended every fight in which Dempsey has participated since he won the world&#x27;s championship in Toledo. They have been close friends since Dempsey was a boy and a familiar figure about Logan.&quot;

Celia Dempsey, mother to Jack and at that time a resident of Utah, visited Huntington and Logan in September 1927. Said the &quot;Logan Banner&quot;:

Mrs. Dempsey spent six days in Logan, quartering at the Aracoma Hotel. Her departure yielded an additional story:

===Kid Blackie===

Because his father had difficulty finding work, the family traveled often and Dempsey dropped out of elementary school to work and left home at the age of 16. Due to his lack of money, he frequently rode the rods and slept in hobo camps. Desperate for money, Dempsey would occasionally visit saloons and challenge for fights, saying &quot;I can&#x27;t sing and I can&#x27;t dance, but I can lick any SOB in the house.&quot; If anyone accepted the challenge, bets would be made. According to Dempsey&#x27;s autobiography, he rarely lost these bar room brawls. For a short time, Dempsey was a part-time bodyguard for Thomas F. Kearns, president of &quot;The Salt Lake Tribune&quot; and son of Utah&#x27;s U.S. Senator Thomas Kearns.

Dempsey often fought under the pseudonym, &quot;Kid Blackie&quot;, although during his stint in the Salt Lake City area, he went by &quot;Young Dempsey&quot;. Much of his early career is not recorded, and stated thus, in &quot;The Ring Record Book&quot; as compiled by Nat Fleischer.

===Jack Dempsey===
He first competed as &quot;Jack Dempsey&quot; (by his own recollection) in the fall of 1914, in Cripple Creek, Colorado. His brother, Bernie, who often fought under the pseudonym &quot;Jack Dempsey&quot;—this a common practice of the day, in fighters&#x27; admiration of middleweight boxer and former champion, Jack &quot;Nonpareil&quot; Dempsey—had signed to fight veteran George Copelin. Upon learning Copelin had sparred with then current world heavyweight champion Jack Johnson, and given Bernie Dempsey was nearing 40 years of age, he strategically decided to back out of the fight. He substituted his brother, still unknown in Eastern Colorado, as &quot;Jack Dempsey&quot;. The fans at ringside immediately knew this was not the man they had paid to see.

The promoter became violently angry and &quot;sailed into us, barehanded&quot;, threatening to stop the fight. Copelin himself, who outweighed Dempsey by 20 lbs. (165 to 145) upon seeing Dempsey&#x27;s small stature in the ring, warned the promoter, &quot;I might kill that skinny guy.&quot; The promoter reluctantly permitted the fight to commence, and in his first outing as &quot;Jack Dempsey&quot;, the future champion downed Copelin six times in the first round and twice in the second. From there, it was a battle of attrition (&quot;Neither Bernie nor I had taken into consideration the high altitude at Cripple Creek.&quot;), until a last knockdown of Copelin in the seventh moved the referee to make the then-unusual move of stopping the fight once Copelin regained his feet. According to Dempsey &quot;In those days they didn&#x27;t stop mining-town fights as long as one guy could move.&quot; This trial by fire carried with it a $100 purse. The promoter, angered at the switch pulled by the brothers, had laid no promised side bets, &quot;... and even if I did, I wouldn&#x27;t give you anything.&quot;

Following the name change, Dempsey won six bouts in a row by knockout before losing on a disqualification in four rounds to Jack Downey. During this early part of his career, Dempsey campaigned in Utah, frequently entering fights in towns in the Wasatch Mountain Range region. He followed his loss against Downey with a knockout win and two draws versus Johnny Sudenberg in Nevada. Three more wins and a draw followed when he met Downey again, this time resulting in a four-round draw. Following these wins, Dempsey racked up 10 more wins that included matches against Sudenberg and Downey, knocking out Downey in two rounds. These wins were followed with three no-decision matches, although at this point in the history of boxing, the use of judges to score a fight was often forbidden, so if a fight went the distance, it was called a draw or a no decision, depending on the state or county where the fight was held.

After the United States entered World War I in 1917, Dempsey worked in a shipyard and continued to box. Afterward, he was accused by some boxing fans of being a slacker for not enlisting. This remained a black mark on his reputation until 1920, when evidence produced showed he had registered with the U.S. Army, but been exempted due to hardship (having a dependent wife). After the war, Dempsey spent two years in Salt Lake City, &quot;bumming around&quot; as he called it, before returning to the ring.

===World heavyweight champion===

Among his opponents as a rising contender were Fireman Jim Flynn, the only boxer ever to beat Dempsey by a knockout when Dempsey lost to him in the first round (although some boxing historians believe the fight was a &quot;fix&quot;), and Gunboat Smith, (who was a formerly highly ranked contender who had beaten both World Champion Jess Willard and Hall of Famer Sam Langford). Dempsey beat Smith for the third time on a second-round knockout. Dempsey had refused a match with Sam Langford in 1916. According to Dempsey: &quot;I think Sam Langford was the greatest fighter we ever had.&quot;

Before he employed the long-experienced Jack Kearns as his manager, Dempsey was first managed by John J. Reisler.

One year later, in 1918, Dempsey fought in 17 matches, going 15–1 with one no-decision. One of those fights was with Flynn, who was knocked out by Dempsey, coincidentally, in the first round. Among other matches won that year were against Light Heavyweight Champion Battling Levinsky, Bill Brennan, Fred Fulton, Carl E. Morris, Billy Miske, heavyweight Lefty Jim McGettigan, and Homer Smith. In 1919, he won five consecutive regular bouts by knockout in the first round as well as a one-round special bout.

===Title fight and controversy===
On July 4, 1919, Dempsey and world heavyweight champion Jess Willard met at Toledo for the world title. Pro lightweight fighter Benny Leonard predicted a victory for the 6&#x27;1&quot;, 187-pound Dempsey even though Willard, known as the &quot;Pottawatamie Giant&quot;, was 6&#x27;&quot; tall and 245 pounds. Ultimately, Willard was knocked down seven times by Dempsey in the first round.

Accounts of the fight reported that Willard suffered a broken jaw, broken ribs, several broken teeth, and a number of deep fractures to his facial bones. This aroused suspicion that Dempsey had cheated, with some questioning how the force capable of causing such damage had been transmitted through Dempsey&#x27;s knuckles without fracturing them.

Other reports, however, failed to mention Willard suffered any real injuries. &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ account of the fight described severe swelling visible on one side of Willard&#x27;s face, but did not mention any broken bones. A still photograph of Willard following the fight appears to show discoloration and swelling on his face.

Following the match, Willard was quoted as saying, &quot;Dempsey is a remarkable hitter. It was the first time that I had ever been knocked off my feet. I have sent many birds home in the same bruised condition that I am in, and now I know how they felt. I sincerely wish Dempsey all the luck possible and hope that he garnishes all the riches that comes with the championship. I have had my fling with the title. I was champion for four years and I assure you that they&#x27;ll never have to give a benefit for me. I have invested the money I have made&quot;. Willard later said he had been defeated by &quot;gangsterism&quot;.

After being fired by Dempsey, manager Jack Kearns gave an account of the fight in the January 20, 1964, issue of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; that has become known as the &quot;loaded gloves theory&quot;. In the interview, Kearns said he had informed Dempsey he had wagered his share of the purse favoring a Dempsey win with a first-round knockout. Kearns further stated he had applied plaster of Paris to the wrappings on the fighter&#x27;s hands.

Boxing historian J. J. Johnston said, &quot;the films show Willard upon entering the ring walking over to Dempsey and examining his hands.&quot; That, along with an experiment conducted by a boxing magazine designed to re-enact the fight have been noted as proof that Kearns&#x27; story was false.

&quot;The Ring&quot; founder and editor Nat Fleischer said he had been present when Dempsey&#x27;s hands were wrapped, stating, &quot;Jack Dempsey had no loaded gloves, and no plaster of Paris over his bandages. I watched the proceedings and the only person who had anything to do with the taping of Jack&#x27;s hands was Deforest. Kearns had nothing to do with it, so his plaster of Paris story is simply not true.&quot;

Deforest himself said that he regarded the stories of Dempsey&#x27;s gloves being loaded as libel, calling them &quot;trash&quot;, and said he did not apply any foreign substance to them, &quot;which I can verify since I watched the taping.&quot; Sports writer Red Smith, in Dempsey&#x27;s obituary published by &quot;The New York Times&quot; was openly dismissive of the claim.

Another rumor is that Dempsey used a knuckleduster during the first round. Some speculated that the object used was a rail spike. In the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; on July 3, 1979, Joe Stone, an ex-referee and boxing writer, asserted that in a film taken of the fight, an object on the canvas could be seen after the final knockdown. He further asserted that the object appears to be removed by someone from Dempsey&#x27;s corner. In the same film, however, Dempsey can be seen at various times during the fight pushing and holding with Willard with the palm of the glove in question and holding on to the ropes with both hands, making it next to impossible that he had any foreign object embedded in his glove, and the object resembles a cigar.

Further controversy was fueled by the fact that Dempsey left the ring at the end of the first round, thinking the fight was over. This was seen as a violation of the rules, however Willard&#x27;s corner did not ask for enforcement in order for the referee to disqualify Dempsey.

===Title defenses===

Following his victory, Dempsey traveled around the country, making publicity appearances with circuses, staging exhibitions, and appearing in a low-budget Hollywood movie. Dempsey did not defend his title until September 1920, with a fight against Billy Miske in Benton Harbor, Michigan. Miske was knocked out in three rounds.

Dempsey&#x27;s second title defense was in December 1920 against Bill Brennan at Madison Square Garden, New York City. After 10 rounds, Brennan was ahead on points, and Dempsey&#x27;s left ear was bleeding profusely. Dempsey rebounded to stop Brennan in the 12th round.

====Jack Dempsey vs. Georges Carpentier====
Dempsey&#x27;s next defending fight was against French WW I hero Georges Carpentier, a fighter popular on both sides of the Atlantic. The bout was promoted by Tex Rickard and George Bernard Shaw, who claimed that Carpentier was &quot;the greatest boxer in the world&quot;.

The Dempsey–Carpentier contest took place on July 2, 1921, at Boyle&#x27;s Thirty Acres in Jersey City, New Jersey. It generated the first million-dollar gate in boxing history; a crowd of 91,000 watched the fight. Though it was deemed &quot;the Fight of the Century&quot;, experts anticipated a one-sided win for Dempsey. Radio pioneer RCA arranged for live coverage of the match via KDKA, making the event the first national radio broadcast.

Carpentier wobbled Dempsey with a hard right in the second round. A reporter at ringside, however, counted 25 punches from Dempsey in a single 31-second exchange soon after he was supposedly injured by the right. Carpentier also broke his thumb in that round, which crippled his chances. Dempsey ended up winning the match in the fourth round.

Dempsey did not defend his title again until July 1923 against Tommy Gibbons in Shelby, Montana. Dempsey won the match as result of a 15-round decision.


The last successful title defense for Dempsey was in September 1923 at New York City&#x27;s Polo Grounds in Dempsey vs. Firpo. Attendance was 85,000, with another 20,000 trying to get inside the arena. Firpo was knocked down repeatedly by Dempsey, yet continued to battle back, even knocking Dempsey down twice. On the second occasion he was floored, Dempsey flew head-first through the ring ropes, landing on a ringside reporter&#x27;s typewriter. At this point he was out of the ring for approximately 14 seconds, less than the 20 second rule for out-of-ring knockouts. He was helped back into the ring by the writers at ringside. Ultimately, Dempsey beat Argentinian contender Luis Ángel Firpo with a second-round KO. The fight was transmitted live by radio to Buenos Aires.

Dempsey&#x27;s heavyweight title-defending fights, exhibition fights, movies, and endorsements, made Dempsey one of the richest athletes in the world, putting him on the cover of &quot;Time&quot;.

===Time off from boxing===

Dempsey did not defend his title for three years following the Firpo fight. There was pressure from the public and the media for Dempsey to defend his title against Black contender Harry Wills. Disagreement exists among boxing historians as to whether Dempsey avoided Wills, though Dempsey claimed he was willing to fight him. When he originally won the title, however, he had said he would no longer fight Black boxers.

Instead of continuing to defend his title, Dempsey earned money with boxing exhibitions, product endorsements, and by appearing in films, such as the adventure film serial &quot;Daredevil Jack&quot;. Dempsey also did a lot of traveling, spending, and partying. During this time away from competitive fighting, Dempsey married actress Estelle Taylor in 1925 and fired his long-time trainer/manager Jack &quot;Doc&quot; Kearns. Kearns repeatedly sued Dempsey for large sums of money following his firing.

In April 1924, Dempsey was appointed to an executive position in the Irish Worker League (IWL). The IWL was a Soviet-backed Communist group founded in Dublin by Irish labour leader Jim Larkin.

===Loss of title===
In September 1926, Dempsey fought the Irish American and former U.S. Marine Gene Tunney in Philadelphia, a fighter who had only lost once in his career. In spite of his record and Dempsey&#x27;s inactivity, Tunney was considered the underdog against Dempsey.

The match ended in an upset, with Dempsey losing his title on points in 10 rounds. When the defeated Dempsey returned to his dressing room, he explained his loss to his wife by saying, &quot;Honey, I forgot to duck.&quot; Fifty-five years later president Ronald Reagan borrowed this quote when his wife Nancy visited him in the emergency room after the attempt on his life.

===Post-title loss===

Following his loss of the heavyweight title, Dempsey contemplated retiring but decided to try a comeback. It was during this time period that tragedy struck his family when his brother, John Dempsey, shot his estranged wife Edna (aged 21) and then killed himself in a murder–suicide, leaving behind a two-year-old son, Bruce. Dempsey was called upon to identify the bodies and was emotionally affected by the incident.

During a July 21, 1927, fight at Yankee Stadium, Dempsey knocked out future heavyweight champion Jack Sharkey in the seventh round. The fight was an elimination bout for a title shot against Tunney. The fight was very competitive until the end. The fight ended controversially when Sharkey claimed Dempsey had been hitting him below the belt. When Sharkey turned to the referee to complain, he left himself unprotected and Dempsey crashed a left hook onto his foe&#x27;s chin. Sharkey was unable to beat the ten-count. At the time of the knockout, Dempsey was leading on the scorecards.

===Tunney rematch: &quot;The Long Count&quot;===

The Dempsey–Tunney rematch took place in Chicago, on September 22, 1927 one day less than a year after losing his title to Tunney. Generating more interest than the Carpentier and Firpo bouts, the fight brought in a record-setting $2 million gate. Reportedly, gangster Al Capone offered to fix the rematch in his favor, but the referee was changed to prevent that from happening. Millions around the country listened to the match by radio while hundreds of reporters covered the event. Tunney was paid a record one million dollars for the rematch. Today&#x27;s equivalent in U.S. currency would be approximately $.00.

Dempsey was losing the fight on points when in the seventh round he knocked Tunney down with a left hook to the chin then landed several more punches. A new rule instituted at the time of the fight mandated that when a fighter knocked down an opponent, he must immediately go to a neutral corner. Dempsey, however, refused to immediately move to the neutral corner when instructed by the referee. The referee had to escort Dempsey to the neutral corner, which bought Tunney at least an extra five seconds to recover. Even though the official timekeeper clocked 14 seconds Tunney was down, Tunney got up at the referee&#x27;s count of 9. Dempsey then attempted to finish Tunney off before the end of the round, but failed to do so. Tunney dropped Dempsey for a count of one in round eight and won the final two rounds of the fight, retaining the title of world heavyweight champion on a unanimous decision. Ironically, the neutral corner rule was requested during negotiations by members of the Dempsey camp. Another discrepancy was, when Tunney knocked Dempsey down, the timekeeper started the count immediately, not waiting for Tunney to move to a neutral corner. Because of the controversial nature of the fight due to the neutral corner rule and conflicting counts, the Dempsey–Tunney rematch remains known as &quot;The Long Count Fight&quot;.

==Post-retirement life==

Dempsey retired from boxing following the Tunney rematch, but continued doing exhibition bouts with over one hundred matches between 1930 and 1931 alone. Following retirement, Dempsey became known as a philanthropist. In June 1932, he sponsored the &quot;Ride of Champions&quot; bucking horse event at Reno, Nevada, with the &quot;Dempsey Trophy&quot; going to legendary bronc rider Pete Knight. In 1933, Dempsey was approached by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to portray a boxer in the film, &quot;The Prizefighter and the Lady&quot;, directed by W. S. Van Dyke and co-starring Myrna Loy. Dempsey portrayed himself in the role of referee of the climactic fight between Max Baer (playing the role of Steve Morgan) and Primo Carnera (playing himself), a fictional battle that foreshadowed their actual championship bout only a year later. Dempsey attempted a boxing comeback in 1940 at the age of 45, setting a match against Cowboy Luttrell on July 1. The fight resulted in Dempsey knocking Luttrell out in the second round. Dempsey won two more exhibitions with early knockouts before deciding to call off the comeback and retire for good.

The Riviera del Pacifico Cultural and Convention Center in Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico, built in 1930, was a gambling casino supposedly financed by Al Capone and managed by Dempsey. Its clientele included George Raft, Errol Flynn, Myrna Loy, Lana Turner, Rita Hayworth, and Dolores del Río.

In 1935, Dempsey opened Jack Dempsey&#x27;s Restaurant in New York City on Eighth Avenue and 50th Street, across from the third Madison Square Garden. The restaurant&#x27;s name was later changed to Jack Dempsey&#x27;s Broadway Restaurant when it relocated to Times Square on Broadway between 49th and 50th Streets. It remained open until 1974. Dempsey was also a co-owner of the Howard Manor in Palm Springs, California.

Dempsey married four times; his first two wives were Maxine Gates (married from 1916 to 1919) and Estelle Taylor (married in 1925). Dempsey divorced Taylor in 1931, and married Broadway singer and recent divorcee Hannah Williams in 1933. Williams was previously married to bandleader Roger Wolfe Kahn. Dempsey and Williams had two children together and divorced in 1943. Dempsey then married Deanna Piatelli, remaining married to her until his death in 1983. The couple had one child, a daughter, whom they adopted together, and who would later write a book on Dempsey&#x27;s life with Piatelli.

===Service during World War II===

When the United States entered World War II, Dempsey had an opportunity to refute any remaining criticism of his war record of two decades earlier. He joined the New York State Guard and was given a commission as a first lieutenant, later resigning that commission to accept a commission as a lieutenant in the Coast Guard Reserve. He reported for duty in June 1942 at Coast Guard Training Station, Manhattan Beach, Brooklyn, New York, where he was assigned as &quot;Director of Physical Education&quot;. As part of the ongoing war effort, he made personal appearances at fights, camps, hospitals, and war bond drives. He was promoted to lieutenant commander in December 1942 and commander in March 1944. In 1944, he was assigned to the transport . In 1945, he was on board the attack transport for the invasion of Okinawa. He also spent time aboard the , where he spent time showing the crew sparring techniques. He was released from active duty in September 1945 and received an honorable discharge from the Coast Guard Reserve in 1952.

=== Professional wrestling ===
After retiring from boxing, Dempsey became involved in the professional wrestling as a featured attraction and a frequent referee in those said featured attractions. The first match that Dempsey refereed was at a show in Dallas on January 9, 1931, between Jim O&#x27;Dowd and Billy Edwards. In the match, Dempsey retaliated from an attack from Edwards with a straight punch, which caused O&#x27;Dowd to win the match. Six years later, on October 18, 1937, he refereed an entire show at the Jaffa Mosque in Altoona, Pennsylvania, where the main event was between Wally Dusek and Ray Steele. In April 1947, he and Jack Sharkey co-refereed a two-out-of-three falls tag team match between Emil Dusek and Ernie Dusek of the Dusek Family against Yvon Robert and Larry Moquin in Montreal. Robert and Moquin, who were the faces, defeated the brothers.

He famously refereed a match on June 21, 1950, between &quot;Nature Boy&quot; Buddy Rogers and the NWA World&#x27;s Heavyweight Champion Lou Thesz. Thesz won the bout after getting Rogers stuck between the top and middle ropes in a choke hold, which prompted Dempsey to do a 10 count to signal a stoppage. Later that year, in December, he refereed a bout between Primo Carnera and Chief Don Eagle. The match was noted for being the first time since 1937 that Dempsey had been physically involved against a wrestler when, after Carnera, who was playing the heel in the match, drew the ire of Dempsey by way of illegal tactics during the match, Dempsey hit Carnera with two punches before Eagle pinned him.

The last match he guest refereed was a June 28, 1958 match between Pat O&#x27;Connor and Killer Kowalski. The 63 year old Dempsey took a shot to the back of the head, which prompted a scare for the promoter and ring-side crew, but did not have any major or life-threatening injuries as a result.

===Later life===
Dempsey wrote a book on boxing titled &quot;Championship Fighting: Explosive Punching and Aggressive Defense&quot; and published in 1950. The book emphasizes knockout power derived from enabling fast motion from one&#x27;s heavy bodyweight.

After the world-famous Louis–Schmeling fight, Dempsey stated he was glad he never had to face Joe Louis in the ring; when Louis eventually fell on hard times financially, Dempsey served as honorary chairman of a relief fund to assist him.

From the time they boxed together in 1921, Dempsey remained close friends with French world champion Georges Carpentier. They visited each other in New York and Paris, got together to commemorate the anniversary of their famous bout and exchanged birthday greetings.

Dempsey made friends with former opponents Wills and Tunney after retirement, with Dempsey campaigning for Tunney&#x27;s son, Democrat John V. Tunney, when he successfully ran for the U.S. Senate, from California. He was also one of many boxers to attend the funeral of Feab S. Williams, who boxed under the name of George Godfrey.

One of Dempsey&#x27;s best friends was Judge John Sirica, who presided over the Watergate trials.

Dempsey was engaged to Mamie Van Doren, when she was Joan Olander, in 1951. Van Doren details the relationship in her autobiography.

====Legacy====
Dempsey was an inaugural 1954 inductee to &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine&#x27;s Boxing Hall of Fame (disbanded in 1987), and was an inaugural 1990 inductee to the International Boxing Hall of Fame. In 1970, Dempsey became part of the &quot;charter class&quot; in the Utah Sports Hall of Fame.

He recounted an incident where he was assaulted while walking home at night, telling the press in 1971 that the two young muggers attempted to grab his arms, but he broke free and laid them both out cold on the sidewalk. The story of the encounter appeared in the &quot;Hendersonville Times-News&quot;, and reported the incident had taken place &quot;a few years [earlier]&quot;.
In 1977, in collaboration with his daughter Barbara Lynn, Dempsey published his autobiography, titled &quot;Dempsey&quot;. In tribute to his legacy and boxing career, a 2004 PBS documentary summarized &quot;Dempsey&#x27;s boxing style consisted of constantly bobbing and weaving. His attacks were furious and sustained. Behind it all was rage. His aggressive behavior prompted a rule that boxers had to retreat to a neutral corner and give opponents who had been knocked down a chance to get up.&quot; According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, constant attack was his strategic defense.
In 2011, Dempsey was posthumously inducted into the Irish American Hall of Fame.

Dempsey was a Freemason and member of Kenwood Lodge #800 in Chicago.

===Death===
On May 31, 1983, Dempsey died of heart failure at the age of 87 in New York City. His body was buried at Southampton Cemetery in Southampton, New York.

<doc id="148025" wikidata="Q222616" url="?curid=148025" title="James III of Scotland">
<text>James III (10 July 1451/May 1452 – 11 June 1488) was King of Scots from 1460 until his death at the Battle of Sauchieburn in 1488. He inherited the throne as a child following the death of his father, King James II, at the siege of Roxburgh Castle. James III&#x27;s reign began with a minority that lasted almost a decade, during which Scotland was governed by a series of regents and factions who struggled for possession of the young king before his personal rule began in 1469.

James III was an unpopular and ineffective king and was confronted with two major rebellions during his reign. He was much criticised by contemporaries and later chroniclers for his promotion of unrealistic schemes to invade or take possession of Brittany, Guelders and Saintonge at the expense of his regular duties as king. While his reign saw Scotland reach its greatest territorial extent with the acquisition of Orkney and Shetland through his marriage to Margaret of Denmark, James was accused of debasing the coinage, hoarding money, failing to resolve feuds and enforce criminal justice, and pursuing an unpopular policy of alliance with England. His preference for his own &quot;low-born&quot; favourites at court and in government alienated many of his bishops and nobles, as well as members of his own family, leading to tense relationships with his brothers, his wife, and his heir. In 1482, James&#x27;s brother, Alexander, Duke of Albany, attempted to usurp the throne with the aid of an invading English army, which led to the loss of Berwick-upon-Tweed and a coup by a group of nobles which saw the king imprisoned for a time, before being restored to power.

James&#x27;s reputation as Scotland&#x27;s first Renaissance monarch has sometimes been exaggerated. The artistic legacy of his reign was slight when compared to that of his two immediate successors, and consists of the patronage of painters and musicians, coins that display realistic portraits of the king, the Trinity Altarpiece, and the King&#x27;s Chapel at Restalrig. James III was killed at the Battle of Sauchieburn, following a rebellion in which his heir was the figurehead of the rebels, and succeeded him as James IV.

== Early life ==
James was the first surviving son born to King James II and his wife, Mary of Guelders, the daughter of Arnold, Duke of Guelders, and a great-niece of Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy. The exact date and place of James&#x27;s birth have been a matter of debate. Claims have been made that he was born in May 1452, or on 10 or 20 July 1451. The place of birth was either Stirling Castle, or St Andrews Castle (the seat of the Bishop of St Andrews), depending on the year. His most recent biographer, Norman Macdougall, argued strongly for late May 1452 at St Andrews. The infant Duke of Rothesay was born during the crisis which had seen his father stab William, Earl of Douglas to death in Stirling Castle. This murder did not end the power of the Douglases, but created a state of intermittent civil war until James II struck a decisive blow against the Douglases in 1455 at the Battle of Arkinholm and Parliament declared the extensive Douglas lands forfeit and permanently annexed them to the Crown. James III ascended the throne following the death of his father at the siege of Roxburgh Castle on 3 August 1460, and the new king was brought to Kelso from Edinburgh with his mother. It was not considered possible to have the king journey to Perthshire for a coronation at Scone Abbey, so James III was crowned at Kelso Abbey, a week after James II&#x27;s death, and two days after the fall of Roxburgh.

== Early reign ==
=== The Queen Regent ===
During the early years of James III&#x27;s reign, the government was led by the queen mother, Mary of Guelders, as regent, while James was educated by Archibald Whitelaw, the Secretary of State and a classical scholar who had taught at St Andrews and Cologne. In March 1461 the first parliament of the reign appointed a council of regency consisting of the Bishop of St Andrews, the Bishop of Glasgow, and the earls of Angus, Huntly, Argyll, and Orkney.

Mary of Guelders emerged as an astute and capable ruler, pursuing a pragmatic foreign policy during the Wars of the Roses taking place in England. Following the defeat of the Lancastrians by the Yorkists at the Battle of Towton in March 1461, Henry VI of England, Margaret of Anjou, and Edward, Prince of Wales fled north across the border seeking refuge. They were received by Mary of Guelders and lodged at Linlithgow Palace and the Dominican friary in Edinburgh.

The Lancastrians expected Mary to provide them with Scottish troops to help Henry VI recover the throne, but she had no intention of becoming involved in a war on their behalf. Mary sought to gain as much as she could from the Lancastrian fugitives while opening negotiations with the victorious Yorkists to explore the possibility of a truce. In return for a year&#x27;s refuge in Scotland and loans that Mary of Guelders granted them, the Lancastrians surrendered Berwick to the Scots in April 1461.

This period also saw disputes between Mary and James Kennedy, Bishop of St Andrews over who had control over the person of James III, and over foreign policy, with the bishop favouring an alliance with the Lancastrians, while Mary initially wanted to continue playing off the warring parties in England against each other, before eventually supporting the Yorkists.

Although the sources for the period are vague, it is believed that Kennedy and his supporters mounted a coup in the autumn of 1462 by taking possession of the 10-year-old James III following an armed confrontation with Mary&#x27;s supporters in Edinburgh. Mary of Guelders died in December 1463, leaving Bishop Kennedy in undisputed control of government.

=== Kennedys and Boyds ===
Bishop Kennedy died at St Andrews in May 1465, and his elder brother, Gilbert Kennedy, Lord Kennedy, assumed custody of James III. Lord Kennedy&#x27;s guardianship lacked the sanction of Parliament, and his advancement of the Kennedy kin, such as the appointment of his half-brother, Patrick Graham, as the new bishop of St Andrews, made his regime increasingly unpopular.

In July 1466, James III was seized while hunting at Linlithgow Palace by a large armed group led by Robert, Lord Boyd and his son, Thomas, and was taken to Edinburgh Castle as the Boyds and their supporters mounted a coup to seize control of the government by gaining possession of the king during his minority. Gilbert Kennedy was then imprisoned in Stirling Castle for a period.

The 14-year-old king was forced to declare before Parliament in October that he had not been offended by being taken from Linlithgow, and that it was his intention to appoint Lord Boyd as his governor, to serve until his twenty-first year. The Boyd faction made itself unpopular, especially with the king, through self-aggrandizement such as the creation of Lord Boyd&#x27;s son, Thomas, as earl of Arran, and Arran&#x27;s marriage to the king&#x27;s 13-year-old sister, Mary in 1467, which antagonised the king and considerable sections of the three estates.

The Boyds sought to maintain power by gaining diplomatic success, and in August 1468 an embassy was sent to Denmark to secure a royal marriage. The ambassadors&#x27; negotiations resulted in a treaty which provided for an alliance between Scotland and Denmark, and James III&#x27;s marriage to Margaret, the only daughter of King Christian I of Denmark and Norway. Margaret&#x27;s dowry was 60,000 Rhenish guilders, 10,000 of which were to be paid before the Scottish embassy left Denmark.

However, Christian I was unable to raise more than 2,000 of the promised 10,000 guilders, and in May 1469, Orkney and Shetland were pledged by him, as king of Norway, to James III as security until the outstanding amount of Margaret&#x27;s dowry. However, James had no intention of allowing the Danes to redeem their rights in Orkney and Shetland, and would quickly acquire full sovereignty over the islands.

The Boyds&#x27; misuse of power to enrich themselves with lands and offices had made them many enemies, and in April 1468 there was an attempt by the king&#x27;s half-uncles, the Earl of Atholl and James Stewart of Auchterhouse, and his younger brother, the Duke of Albany, to seize Edinburgh Castle and free the king from the Boyds.

The impending marriage of the now seventeen-year-old James III signalled an appropriate moment for him to bring his minority to an end, and the king began to plot his revenge against the Boyds in the summer of 1469, while Lord Boyd was on an embassy to the English court, and the earl of Arran was one of the ambassadors in Denmark.

== Personal rule ==
When the fleet bearing Margaret of Denmark and the Scottish ambassadors arrived in Leith, the king&#x27;s sister, Mary, wife of the Earl of Arran, informed her husband that the king was planning to have him arrested, and the couple fled together to Denmark by sea, and then to Bruges, where they were soon joined by Lord Boyd, who fled there from England. At a Parliament held in November, Lord Boyd, his brother, Sir Alexander, and the Earl of Arran, were all found guilty of treason and their peerages were forfeited. Sir Alexander was condemned to death and beheaded. James III married 13-year-old Margaret of Denmark in July 1469 at Holyrood Abbey, Edinburgh, in a service overseen by Archibald Crawford, the Abbot of Holyrood. The marriage produced three sons: James, Duke of Rothesay, James, Duke of Ross, and John, Earl of Mar.

James III began his personal rule in 1469, yet his exercise of royal power was affected by the fact that he was one of the few Stewart monarchs who had to contend with the problem of an adult, legitimate brother. In 1469 James had two surviving younger brothers, Alexander, Duke of Albany and John, Earl of Mar, then aged fourteen and about twelve, and three Stewart half-uncles (the earls of Atholl and Buchan, and the Bishop of Moray), and each of them would complicate the politics of the reign. From the positive beginnings after his assumption of active control of government in 1469, James III&#x27;s relationship with Parliament would lead to opposition, criticism, and outright confrontation over his foreign and domestic policies. The failure of the king to listen to the grievances raised by the three estates, or to abide by the concessions he made to them, were significant causes of the two major rebellions in 1482–1483 and 1488.

=== Foreign schemes and alliance with England ===
James&#x27;s policies during the early 1470s revolved primarily around ambitious continental schemes to emphasize the prestige of the king and the Stewart dynasty, expand the territory under James&#x27;s rule, and agree to an alliance with England. The main business of the parliament James III called in 1471 was the granting of a tax to fund an embassy to the continent to allow him to act as arbitrator between Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, and Louis XI of France. The embassy would also seek a Burgundian or French marriage for the king&#x27;s sister, Margaret. In February 1472, James&#x27;s second continental scheme saw him ask Parliament to fund his plan to lead an army of 6,000 men to assert his tenuous claim to the Duchy of Brittany, which derived from his aunt, Isabella. Parliament granted a tax of £5,000 to fund the sending of this army to the continent as part of a Franco-Scottish invasion against Francis II, Duke of Brittany, though protests by the clergy about the king leading an army abroad while he had no issue to succeed him eventually led to James abandoning his plans for an invasion of Brittany. That same year James also acted as an intermediary in negotiations between Denmark and France.

In April 1473, the battle of succession for Guelders between James&#x27;s grandfather, Arnold, Duke of Guelders, and his son Adolf, provided the king with another continental scheme. The deposition of Arnold by his son in 1465, and his reinstatement at the hands of Charles the Bold in 1471, had left Arnold wishing to alter the succession to prevent the duchy falling to either his son or the Duke of Burgundy, and in 1472 he asked James or one of his brothers to travel to Guelders and take possession of the duchy. Duke Arnold died in February 1473, and with him, any serious likelihood of putting his succession plans into effect, but James III was undaunted and sent an ambassador to Charles the Bold to press his claim. James also sent ambassadors to France offering military aid to Louis XI against England in return for a pension of 60,000 crowns a year and to reassert the claim James&#x27;s father had made to the French province of Saintonge, a claim which dated back to the Treaty of Perth-Chinon between James I of Scotland and Charles VII of France when the province was offered to the Scottish king in return for an army of Scottish troops which were never sent. These unrealistic schemes resulted in parliamentary criticism, especially since the king was reluctant to deal with the more mundane business of administering justice at home. Parliament opposed James&#x27;s plans to leave the country and, in refusing to condone the king&#x27;s requests, also attempted to persuade the king to turn to the administration of justice. The king&#x27;s failure to take an active and personal role in the same, and his use of remissions and respites as a source of money, would prove one of the most frequently occurring themes in Parliament for the rest of the reign.

In October 1474, James III concluded a truce with Edward IV of England which was intended to (but did not) last for forty-five years, and was to be accompanied by a marriage alliance between James&#x27;s heir, the infant Duke of Rothesay, and Edward&#x27;s daughter, Cecily of York, when both of them reached marriageable age. The prospective bride&#x27;s dowry was 20,000 marks sterling, which would be paid in advance in annual instalment of 2,000 marks over a period of seventeen years. On 20 February 1472, Parliament brought the negotiations, which had begun with the Treaty of Copenhagen, to an end by annexing and uniting the earldom of Orkney and the lordship of Shetland to the Scottish Crown. In theory, Christian I of Denmark or his successors could still redeem the islands by paying the balance of Queen Margaret&#x27;s dowry; but in practice, with Christian&#x27;s continuing financial difficulties and the strong control the Scottish Crown exercised over Orkney and Shetland, this was highly unlikely. This Anglo-Scottish treaty, the first alliance between the two kingdoms in the fifteenth century, preserved the peace between Scotland and England and provided James III with a substantial financial gain. By 1479, he had amassed 8,000 marks in English dowry payments – roughly the equivalent of his annual income from regular sources. James would continue to press for English alliances for the rest of his reign, although he also sought a marriage alliance with Mary of Burgundy for his brother Albany in 1477, and renewed the Franco-Scottish alliance with Charles VIII of France in 1484. However, the peace policy was unpopular in Scotland and went against the traditional enmity between the two kingdoms. Opposition was particularly associated with Albany and was one of the causes of his estrangement from the king and James&#x27;s unpopularity by 1479.

=== Lord of the Isles ===
James III turned to unfinished business from his father&#x27;s reign in 1475: the destruction of John MacDonald, Lord of the Isles and Earl of Ross. The greatest lord in Gaelic Scotland, John ruled over sprawling territories in the Hebrides, the western Highlands and the north-east. In 1462 John had agreed to the Treaty of Westminster with Edward IV of England, a treaty which proposed that if Scotland was conquered by Edward, the kingdom would be partitioned, with the lands north of the Firth of Forth to be divided between the Lord of the Isles and the Earl of Douglas, and held from the English crown. The confrontation began in September 1475, when John was accused of a number of offences against the Crown, including treasonable dealings with England and the Earl of Douglas, and besieging Rothesay Castle. When John did not appear for trial before Parliament in December, he was declared forfeit. The earls of Lennox, Argyll, Atholl and Huntly were ordered to pursue John MacDonald and invade his territories. The Lord of the Isles appeared before the king in Edinburgh in July 1476 and the forfeiture was rescinded. The earldom of Ross was annexed to the Crown, Kintyre, Knapdale, and the offices of sheriff of Inverness and Nairn were lost, and the Lord of the Isles was reduced to a mere Lord of Parliament. On the day of the forfeiture of the Lord of the Isles, James III had Parliament approve his act of revocation. The king stood at the height of his power, having removed the Boyds, annexed Orkney and Shetland, humbled the Archbishop of St Andrews, agreed to peace and an alliance with England, and forfeited the Lord of the Isles. His authority now extended from the Northern Isles to Berwick-upon-Tweed, and across the Lordship of the Isles.

=== Parliament, Mar and Albany ===
James III&#x27;s pursuit of unpopular and arbitrary policies saw increasing opposition in Parliament, with the most criticism directed towards the king&#x27;s failure to go out on Justice Ayres, his making money from granting remissions for serious crimes, and his frequent recourse to taxation. Complaints from Parliament that royal justice was not being actively administered by the king in person occurred throughout his reign, partly due to his practice of delegating responsibility to appointed justices and allowing Ayres to be held without his presence.

James III&#x27;s &quot;low-born&quot; favourites at court and in government began to alienate many of his bishops and nobles. The most high-profile royal favourites was William Scheves, who began his career in royal service in 1471 as a court physician, before his rapid promotion as Archdeacon of St Andrews, dean of Dunkeld, and coadjutor of St Andrews, before being appointed as Archbishop of St Andrews. Other unpopular favourites included John Ramsay, 1st Lord Bothwell and Robert Cochrane. In 1479 conflict developed between the king and his two brothers John, Earl of Mar and Alexander, Duke of Albany. The Earl of Mar was imprisoned at Craigmillar Castle for unspecified reasons, and died there in mysterious circumstances. The reasons behind James III&#x27;s assault on Albany have been difficult to understand. Albany had helped James to power in 1469, and was an effective Warden of the Marches, having resisted an incursion by Richard, Duke of Gloucester in 1474. It has been suggested that the most likely causes of the rift between James and Albany were the latter&#x27;s opposition to the Anglo-Scottish alliance, his being responsible for serious violations of the truce, and his abuse of his position and challenge to royal authority by the ruthless enforcement of justice in the Marches.

In May 1479, Albany was accused of treason for arming and provisioning Dunbar Castle against the king, assisting known rebels and deliberately causing trouble on the Anglo-Scottish border, in violation of the truce between Scotland and England. Albany fled by sea to Paris, where in September 1479 he was welcomed by King Louis XI, and received royal favour by his marriage to Anne de La Tour d&#x27;Auvergne.

=== War with England ===
Since the treaty of October 1474, relations between Scotland and England had remained generally peaceful. Edward IV continued to pay the annual instalments of the dowry for his daughter&#x27;s future marriage to James III&#x27;s heir, and both kingdoms avoided any significant breaches of the truce. In 1478 James proposed strengthening the alliance with England still further by offering his sister Margaret as a bride for Edward IV&#x27;s brother-in-law, Anthony Woodville, 2nd Earl Rivers. Soon afterwards, however, the truce began to break down, with several instances of Scottish cross-border raiding and pillaging. In 1480 Edward IV sent an envoy to Edinburgh with what was essentially a declaration of war, informing James that the English king intended to wage war against the Scots unless his demands were met: that the Scots make reparations for breaches of the truce; that James return Berwick, Roxburgh and Coldingham to English dominion; and that James do homage to Edward for the Scottish Crown. However, Edward was prepared to maintain the peace if James would surrender Berwick and hand over his son and heir as a guarantee of his intention to carry through with the marriage of the Duke of Rothesay and Cecily of York. Richard, Duke of Gloucester was appointed lieutenant-general, and commissions for the defence of the border were issued in Yorkshire, Cumberland, and Northumberland. But during the summer of 1480, the Earl of Angus carried out a large-scale raid into Northumberland, culminating in the burning of Bamburgh Castle. By October, James III had written to Louis XI of France asking for guns and artillerymen to repulse further attacks. The spring and autumn of 1481 saw English ships raid the Forth, attacking Blackness Castle and harassing shipping. There does not seem to have been a land-based invasion of Scotland, but there were three raids into England by a Scottish army in that year. Edward IV had made invasion preparations and began to travel north, but went no further than Nottingham. In 1482, Edward IV launched a full-scale invasion led by the Duke of Gloucester, the future Richard III. James&#x27;s brother Alexander, styled &quot;Alexander IV&quot;, was included as part of the invasion party. James, in attempting to lead his subjects against the invasion, was arrested by a group of disaffected nobles at Lauder Bridge in July 1482. It has been suggested that the nobles were already in league with Alexander. The king was imprisoned in Edinburgh Castle and a new regime, led by &quot;lieutenant-general&quot; Alexander, became established during the autumn of 1482. Meanwhile, the English army, unable to take Edinburgh Castle, ran out of money and returned to England, having taken Berwick-upon-Tweed for the last time.

== Restoration to power ==
Whilst imprisoned in Edinburgh Castle, James was politically sidelined from July 1482 to early 1483, and his two half-uncles (including Andrew Stewart) managed to form a brief replacement government with his brother Alexander, Duke of Albany, in place as acting lieutenant-general of the realm. He was eventually freed by late September 1482. After having been freed, James was able to regain power by buying off members of Albany&#x27;s government, such that by December 1482, Albany&#x27;s government was collapsing. From 1483, he was able to &quot;steadily reduce any remaining support for Albany&quot;. In particular, Albany&#x27;s attempt to claim the vacant earldom of Mar led to the intervention of the powerful George Gordon, 2nd Earl of Huntly, on the king&#x27;s side.

In January 1483, Albany fled to his estates at Dunbar. The death of his patron, Edward IV, on 9 April left Albany in an untenable position and he fled to England, letting an English garrison into his stronghold of Dunbar Castle. A year later he return for another attempted invasion with the long-exiled 9th Earl of Douglas. Following the Battle of Lochmaben, he was forced to flee back to England a second time. His titles and estates were forfeited to the crown. Following this, recent research has suggested he may have returned again to Scotland in 1485 but was caught and imprisoned in the same castle where James had been incarcerated. Chronicler Adam Abell&#x27;s account of Albany escaping from Edinburgh castle after killing his guard and climbing down the castle walls using a rope made of bedsheets has some circumstantial corroborating evidence. This was Albany&#x27;s final incursion, after which he returned to France where accounts claim he was killed in a joust.

James III, meanwhile, returned to his policies for the 1470s, above all of alliance with England. In August 1484 James III proposed a truce and alliance with Richard III and a marriage between the Duke of Rothesay and Anne de la Pole, Richard&#x27;s niece.

On Laetare Sunday, 5 March 1486, Pope Innocent VIII blessed a Golden Rose and sent it to James III. It was an annual custom to send the rose to a deserving prince. Giacomo Passarelli, Bishop of Imola, brought the rose to Scotland and returned to London to complete the dispensation for the marriage of Henry VII of England. In 1486 and 1487 James proposed a truce with England and the marriage of his second son, James, Marquess of Ormond, to Catherine of York, the sister-in-law of Henry VII of England. In April 1487 the Pope granted James III an indult which strengthened the power of the Scottish Crown over ecclesiastical appointments, allowing the king and his successors to effectively appoint their own candidates when vacancies occurred in cathedrals and monasteries.

Despite a lucky escape in 1482, when he easily could have been murdered or executed in an attempt to bring his son to the throne, James did not reform his behaviour during the 1480s. Obsessive attempts to secure alliance with England continued, although they made little sense given the prevailing politics. He continued to favour a group of &quot;familiars&quot; unpopular with the more powerful magnates. He refused to travel for the implementation of justice and remained invariably resident in Edinburgh. He was also estranged from his wife, Margaret of Denmark, who lived at Stirling Castle with her sons.

== Rebellion and death at Sauchieburn ==

In January 1488, James III used a meeting of Parliament to publicly reward those who had been loyal to him in the past and tried to gain supporters by creating four new Lords of Parliament. He also raised his second son, James, Marquess of Ormond, to the dignity of Duke of Ross. Coming after the king&#x27;s negotiations in 1486 and 1487 for a marriage alliance for his second son, it was clearly designed to enhance his status and make him a more attractive prospect as a bridegroom, and only furthered the perception amongst the king&#x27;s opponents that he was favouring his second son at the expense of the heir to the throne. But opposition to James was led by the Earls of Angus and Argyll, and the Home and Hepburn families. James&#x27;s heir, the fifteen-year-old James, Duke of Rothesay, left Stirling Castle without his father&#x27;s knowledge on 2 February 1488, marking the beginning of a four-month rebellion against James III.

Prince James became, perhaps reluctantly, the figurehead of the rebels, whose aim seems to have been the establishment of a council of regency, with the Prince as its figurehead and the king in protective custody. The rebels claimed that they had removed Prince James from Stirling to protect him from his vindictive father, who had surrounded himself with wicked Anglophile counsellors. Like the Prince, many of the rebels also feared for their safety if James III continued to rule. The king made more enemies among his nobles by dismissing the Earl of Argyll from the Chancellorship, for reasons which remain a mystery, and replacing him with William Elphinstone, the Bishop of Aberdeen.

James III sought armed assistance from Henry VII of England and moved north from Edinburgh to Aberdeen in March, probably realising that his position in Edinburgh was becoming precarious, with the Duke of Rothesay and the rebel army nearby, either at Linlithgow or Stirling. The king failed to raise support for the royal cause in the north-east and then made the mistake of agreeing to negotiate a settlement with the rebels, before promptly breaking his word and, on the advice of his half-uncle the Earl of Buchan, marching south from Aberdeen to settle the rebellion by force, which lost him the support of several more nobles. Following an inconclusive skirmish between the royal and rebel forces at Blackness Castle, James III retreated to the safety of Edinburgh Castle, where he rewarded his supporters and attempted to gain new ones by distributing cash, jewels and land. Matters came to a head in June 1488 when James III left Edinburgh Castle and led his army towards Stirling. The royal and rebel armies joined battle south of Stirling on 11 June 1488 at the Battle of Sauchieburn, on what contemporaries described as the &quot;field of Stirling&quot;.

James III was killed at some stage during the course of the battle, although the circumstances of the king&#x27;s death are unclear, and it took some time to establish with certainty that the king had been killed. The 16th century chroniclers Adam Abell and John Lesley alleged that James III was slain in Milton mill on the Bannock Burn. Each new account added unflattering, but probably invented, details. Robert Lindsay of Pitscottie, writing in 1576, states that the king fled to Stirling, but was thrown from his horse and fainted near Milton mill, where he was cared for by the miller and his wife. As the retreat of the royal forces to Stirling was taking place, the king came to and called for a priest to make his confession. A priest (possibly a servant of Lord Gray, one of the rebel lords) who was passing by asked where the king was and, on being led to the king, stabbed him to death. George Buchanan says that James fell from his horse whilst fleeing to one of his ships, stationed in the Forth, rather than to Stirling. He took refuge in some mills but being overtaken, he was slain there, with a few attendants. There is no evidence available to corroborate any of the sixteenth century allegations of cowardly behaviour, and the subsequent parliamentary account stated only the king &quot;happened to be slain&quot; as a result of his own poor decisions. In effect, it argued, the king killed himself, a convenient conclusion for the new regime to reach. Yet Norman Macdougall&#x27;s modern biography notes the indictment of John Ross of Montgrenan at the same parliament alleged the king left the field on Ross&#x27;s advice and was then killed by unknown vile persons.

James III was buried beside his queen in front of the high altar of Cambuskenneth Abbey. His son and successor, James IV, attended the ceremony and in atonement for his involvement in his father&#x27;s death, from 1496 appointed a chaplain to sing for the salvation of their souls; records of this continued until the Scottish Reformation. The remains of James and Margaret were re-interred under a new stone monument at Queen Victoria&#x27;s expense in 1865.

== Marriage and issue ==
James married Margaret of Denmark at Holyrood Abbey, Edinburgh, in July 1469. They had three children:

== Fictional portrayals ==
James III has been depicted in plays, historical novels and short stories. They include the following:

* &quot;Price of a Princess&quot; (1994) by Nigel Tranter. The book takes place in the years 1465–1469. The main character is Mary Stewart, Countess of Arran, a sister of James III. She is depicted joining her husband Thomas Boyd, Earl of Arran, in a mission to the court of Christian I of Denmark. The two negotiate the cession of Orkney and Shetland from the Kalmar Union to the Kingdom of Scotland.
* &quot;Lord in Waiting&quot; (1994) by Nigel Tranter. The book takes place in the years 1474–1488. It covers events of the reign of James III as seen from the perspective of &quot;Sir John Douglas&quot;, brother of Archibald Douglas, 5th Earl of Angus. James III is depicted as influenced by William Sheves, the court astrologer and alchemist, later Archbishop of St Andrews. Douglas would rather have Mary Stewart (see above) on the throne.
* &quot;The Admiral&quot; (2001) by Nigel Tranter. The book takes place in the years 1480–1530. It covers the career of Andrew Wood of Largo and the formation of the Royal Scots Navy. James III is depicted favoring Wood with the title of Lord High Admiral of Scotland.
* &quot;James III: The True Mirror&quot; (2014) by Rona Munro, a co-production between the National Theatre of Scotland, Edinburgh International Festival and the National Theatre of Great Britain. The James Plays – &quot;James I&quot;, &quot;James II&quot; and &quot;James III&quot; – are a trio of history plays by Rona Munro. Each play stands alone as a vision of a country tussling with its past and future. This play concentrates on James&#x27; relationships with his wife Margaret, his court favourites and the powerful lords he has alienated.
* &quot;The Unicorn Hunt&quot; (1993) by Dorothy Dunnett. Volume 5 in &quot;The House of Niccolò&quot; series.
* &quot;To Lie with Lions&quot; (1995) by Dorothy Dunnett, Volume 6 in &quot;The House of Niccolò&quot; series.
* &quot;Gemini&quot; (2000) by Dorothy Dunnett, Volume 8 in &quot;The House of Niccolò&quot; series.
* &quot;Sunset at Noon&quot; by Jane Oliver (1955), a fictional account of the life of James IV and the Battle of Flodden.

<text>James II (16 October 1430 – 3 August 1460) was King of Scots from 1437 until his death in 1460. The eldest surviving son of James I of Scotland, he succeeded to the Scottish throne at the age of six, following the assassination of his father. The first Scottish monarch not to be crowned at Scone, James II&#x27;s coronation took place at Holyrood Abbey in March 1437. After a reign characterised by struggles to maintain control of his kingdom, he was killed by an exploding cannon at Roxburgh Castle in 1460.

== Life ==
James was born in Holyrood Abbey. He was the son of King James I and Joan Beaufort. By his first birthday, his only brother, his older twin, Alexander, had died, thus leaving James as heir apparent with the title Duke of Rothesay. On 21 February 1437, James I was assassinated, and the six-year-old James immediately succeeded him as James II. He was crowned in Holyrood Abbey by Abbot Patrick on 23 March 1437.

On 3 July 1449, the eighteen-year-old James married the fifteen-year-old Mary of Guelders, daughter of Arnold, Duke of Guelders, and Catherine of Cleves at Holyrood Abbey. They had seven children, six of whom survived into adulthood. Subsequently, relations between Flanders and Scotland improved. James&#x27;s nickname, &quot;Fiery Face&quot;, referred to a conspicuous vermilion birthmark on his face, which appears to have been deemed by contemporaries an outward sign of a fiery temper.

James was a politic and singularly successful king. He was popular with the commoners, with whom, like most of the Stewarts, he socialised often, in times of peace and war. His legislation has a markedly popular character. He does not appear to have inherited his father&#x27;s taste for literature, which was shared by at least two of his sisters; but the foundation of the University of Glasgow during his reign by Bishop Turnbull shows that he encouraged learning; there are also traces of his endowments to St. Salvator&#x27;s, the new college of Archbishop Kennedy at St Andrews. He possessed much of his father&#x27;s restless energy. However, his murder of the earl of Douglas leaves a stain on his reign.

== Early reign ==
James&#x27;s father was assassinated on 21 February 1437 at Blackfriars monastery in Perth. His mother, Queen Joan, although hurt, managed to get to her six-year-old son, who was now king. On 25 March 1437, he was formally crowned King of Scots at Holyrood Abbey. The Parliament of Scotland revoked alienations of crown property and prohibited them, without the consent of the Estates, that is, until James II&#x27;s eighteenth birthday.

He lived along with his mother and five of his six sisters at Dunbar Castle until 1439. In July 1439, his mother married James Stewart, the Black Knight of Lorne, after obtaining a papal dispensation for both consanguinity and affinity. His oldest sister, Margaret, had left Scotland for France in 1436 to marry the Dauphin Louis (later King Louis XI of France).

From 1437 to 1439, the king&#x27;s first cousin Archibald Douglas, 5th Earl of Douglas, headed the government as lieutenant-general of the realm. After his death, and with a general lack of prominent earls in Scotland due to deaths, forfeiture or youth, political power became shared uneasily among William Crichton, 1st Lord Crichton, Lord Chancellor of Scotland (sometimes in co-operation with the Earl of Avondale), and Sir Alexander Livingston of Callendar, who had possession of the young king as the warden of the stronghold of Stirling Castle. Taking advantage of these events, Livingston placed Queen Joan and her new husband, Sir James Stewart, under &quot;house arrest&quot; at Stirling Castle on 3 August 1439. They were released on 4 September only by making a formal agreement to put James in the custody of the Livingstons, agreeing to the queen&#x27;s relinquishment of her dowry for his maintenance, and confessing that Livingston had acted through zeal for the king&#x27;s safety.

In 1440, in the king&#x27;s name, an invitation is said to have been sent to the 16-year-old William Douglas, 6th Earl of Douglas, and his younger brother, twelve-year-old David, to visit the king at Edinburgh Castle in November 1440. They came and were entertained at the royal table, where James, still a little boy, was charmed by them. However, while they ate, a black bull&#x27;s head, a symbol of death, was brought in and placed before the Earl. They were treacherously hurried to their doom, which took place by beheading in the castle yard of Edinburgh on 24 November, with the 10-year-old king pleading for their lives. Three days later Malcolm Fleming of Cumbernauld, their chief adherent, shared the same fate. The king, being a small child, had nothing to do with this. This infamous incident took the name of &quot;the Black Dinner&quot;.

== Struggles with the Douglases ==
In 1449, James II reached adulthood, but he had to struggle to gain control of his kingdom. The Douglases, probably with his cooperation, used his coming of age as a way to throw the Livingstons out of the shared government, as the young king took revenge for the arrest of his mother that had taken place in 1439, and the assassination of his young Douglas cousins, in which Livingston was complicit. Douglas and Crichton continued to dominate political power and the king continued to struggle to throw off their rule. Between 1451 and 1455, he struggled to free himself from the power of the Douglases. Attempts to curb it took place in 1451, during the absence of William Douglas, 8th Earl of Douglas from Scotland, and culminated with the murder of Douglas at Stirling Castle on 22 February 1452.

The main account of Douglas&#x27;s murder comes from the &quot;Auchinleck Chronicle&quot;, a near-contemporary but fragmentary source. According to its account, the king accused the Earl (probably with justification) of forging links with John Macdonald, 11th Earl of Ross (also Lord of the Isles) and Alexander Lindsay, 4th Earl of Crawford. This bond, if it existed, created a dangerous axis of power of independently minded men, forming a major rival to royal authority. When Douglas refused to break the bond with Ross, James broke into a fit of temper, stabbed Douglas 26 times and threw his body out of a window. His court officials (many of whom would rise to great influence in later years, often in former Douglas lands) then joined in the bloodbath, one allegedly striking out the earl&#x27;s brain with an axe.

This murder did not end the power of the Douglases but rather created a state of intermittent civil war between 1452 and 1455. The main engagements were at Brodick, on the Isle of Arran; Inverkip in Renfrew; and the Battle of Arkinholm. James attempted to seize Douglas&#x27;s lands, but his opponents repeatedly forced him into humiliating climbdowns, whereby he returned the lands to James Douglas, 9th Earl of Douglas, and a brief and uneasy peace ensued.

Military campaigns ended indecisively, and some have argued that James stood in serious danger of being overthrown, or of having to flee the country. But James&#x27;s patronage of lands, titles and office to allies of the Douglases saw their erstwhile allies begin to change sides, most importantly the Earl of Crawford after the Battle of Brechin, and in May 1455, James struck a decisive blow against the Douglases, and they were finally defeated at the Battle of Arkinholm.

In the months that followed, the Parliament of Scotland declared the extensive Douglas lands forfeit and permanently annexed them to the crown, along with many other lands, finances and castles. The earl fled into a long English exile. James finally had the freedom to govern as he wished, and one can argue that his successors as kings of Scots never faced such a powerful challenge to their authority again. Along with the forfeiture of the Albany Stewarts in the reign of James I, the destruction of the Black Douglases saw royal power in Scotland take a major step forward.

== Energetic rule ==
Between 1455 and 1460, James II proved to be an active and interventionist king. Ambitious plans to take Orkney, Shetland and the Isle of Man nonetheless did not succeed. The king traveled the country and has been argued to have originated the practice of raising money by giving remissions for serious crimes. It has also been argued that some of the unpopular policies of James III actually originated in the late 1450s.

In 1458, an Act of Parliament commanded the king to modify his behaviour, but one cannot say how his reign would have developed had he lived longer.

James II is the first Scots monarch for whom a contemporary likeness has survived, in the form of a woodcut showing his birthmark on the face.

== Marriage ==
Negotiations for a marriage to Mary of Guelders began in July 1447, when a Burgundian envoy came to Scotland and was concluded by an embassy under Crichton the chancellor in September 1448. Her great-uncle, Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, settled sixty thousand crowns on his kinswoman, and her dower of ten thousand was secured on lands in Strathearn, Atholl, Methven and Linlithgow. A tournament took place before James at Stirling, on 25 February 1449, between James, master of Douglas, another James, brother to the Laird of Lochleven, and two knights of Burgundy, one of whom, Jacques de Lalaing was the most celebrated knight-errant of the time. The marriage was celebrated at Holyrood on 3 July 1449. A French chronicler, Mathieu d&#x27;Escouchy gives a graphic account of the ceremony and the feasts which followed. Many Flemings in Mary&#x27;s suite remained in Scotland, and the relations between Scotland and Flanders, already friendly under James I, consequently became closer.

In Scotland, the king&#x27;s marriage led to his emancipation from tutelage, and to the downfall of the Livingstons. In the autumn Sir Alexander and other members of the family were arrested. At a parliament in Edinburgh on 19 January 1450, Alexander Livingston, a son of Sir Alexander, and Robert Livingston of Linlithgow were tried and executed on Castle Hill. Sir Alexander and his kinsmen were confined in different and distant castles. A single member of the family escaped the general proscription — James, the eldest son of Sir Alexander, who, after arrest and escape to the highlands, was restored in 1454 to the office of chamberlain to which he had been appointed in the summer of 1449.

== Death ==
James II enthusiastically promoted modern artillery, which he used with some success against the Black Douglases. His ambitions to increase Scotland&#x27;s standing saw him besiege Roxburgh Castle in 1460, one of the last Scottish castles still held by the English after the Wars of Independence.

For this siege, James took a large number of cannons imported from Flanders. On 3 August, he was standing near one of these cannons when it exploded and killed him. Robert Lindsay of Pitscottie stated in his history of James&#x27;s reign that &quot;as the King stood near a piece of artillery, his thigh bone was dug in two with a piece of misframed gun that brake in shooting, by which he was stricken to the ground and died hastily.&quot;

The Scots carried on with the siege, led by George Douglas, 4th Earl of Angus, and the castle fell a few days later. Once the castle was captured, James&#x27;s widow, Mary of Guelders, ordered its destruction. James&#x27;s son became king as James III and Mary acted as regent until her own death three years later.

== Issue ==
James married Mary of Guelders at Holyrood Abbey, Edinburgh, on 3 July 1449. They had seven children:

By his unknown mistress, James also left one illegitimate son:
* John Stewart, Lord of Sticks (d. 21 September 1523), ancestor of the Stewarts of Arnagang, Ballechin, Innervack, Killichassie, the later Kynachins, Loch of Clunie and Stewartfield.

== Fictional portrayals ==
James II has been depicted in plays, historical novels and short stories. They include:

* &quot;The Captain of the Guard&quot; (1862), by James Grant. The novel covers events from 1440 to 1452. Mostly covering the conflict of James II with the earls of Douglas. Part of the action takes place far from Scotland, at the court of Arnold, Duke of Guelders, father-in-law to the King.
* &quot;Two Penniless Princesses&quot; (1891), by Charlotte Mary Yonge. James II is a secondary character. The main characters are his sisters Eleanor, Mary and Joan (&quot;Jean&quot;). The novel covers their travels to foreign courts, including those of young Henry VI of England and René of Anjou.
* &quot;The Black Douglas&quot; (1899), by Samuel Rutherford Crockett and its sequel &quot;Maid Margaret&quot; (1905). The two novels cover events from 1439 to 1460, including most of the reign of James II. His conflict with the earls of Douglas is prominently featured. Including James II stabbing William Douglas, 8th Earl of Douglas to death (1452) and James&#x27;s own death due to a bursting cannon at the siege of Roxburgh (1460). Among the other historical figures depicted are William Douglas, 6th Earl of Douglas and his brother David (mostly their violent deaths in 1440), Margaret Douglas, Fair Maid of Galloway (protagonist of the second novel), Sir Alexander Livingston of Callendar, William Crichton, 1st Lord Crichton, Charles VII of France and his Dauphin (Louis XI and Agnès Sorel. The events take place primarily in Scotland, secondary in France. There is mention of the early phases of the Wars of the Roses (1455–1485) but English events are only &quot;slightly touched&quot;.
* &quot;James II: Day of The Innocents&quot; (2014), by Rona Munro. A co-production between the National Theatre of Scotland, Edinburgh International Festival and the National Theatre of Great Britain. The James Plays — &quot;James I&quot;, &quot;James II&quot; and &quot;James III&quot; — are a trio of history plays by Rona Munro. Each play stands alone as a vision of a country tussling with its past and future. This play focuses on the early life of James II, the developing relationships with the Douglas family and the eventual death of Lord Douglas.
* &quot;The Lion&#x27;s Whelp&quot; (1997), by Nigel Tranter. Set during 1437–1460, during the reign of James II of Scotland, the book describes the boy-king&#x27;s time under regents Archibald Douglas, 5th Earl of Douglas, Lord Crichton and Sir Alexander Livingston, and the plot to kill William Douglas, 6th Earl of Douglas at the &quot;Black Dinner&quot;, seen through the eyes of Alexander Lyon, Master and then 2nd Lord of Glamis. The book ends with the death of James.
* &quot;Black Douglas&quot; (1968), by Nigel Tranter, covers events up to the killing of the 8th Earl of Douglas, is sympathetic to the earl and unsympathetic to James II.
* &quot;Niccolò Rising&quot; (1986), by Dorothy Dunnett, mentions his intrigues and wars as part of the international milieu of the time, especially as they impact Flanders, the scene of the novel.
* Appears as a background character in the children&#x27;s fantasy novel &quot;In the Keep of Time&quot; (1977) by Margaret J. Anderson. His nickname and the birthmark which inspired it are both described, and one of the main characters witnesses the Battle of Roxburgh Castle and the explosion of &quot;the Lion&quot; that kills him.

<text>The Guanche were the indigenous inhabitants of the Spanish Canary Islands, located in the Atlantic Ocean some to the west of modern Morocco and the North African coast. The islanders spoke the Guanche language, which is believed to have been related to the Berber languages of mainland North Africa; the language became extinct in the 17th century, soon after the islands were colonized.

It is believed that the Guanche may have arrived at the archipelago some time in the first millennium BC. The Guanche were the only indigenous people known to have lived in the Macaronesian archipelago region before the arrival of Europeans. There is no accepted evidence that the other Macaronesian archipelagos (the Cape Verde Islands, Madeira and the Azores) were inhabited.

After the commencement of the Spanish conquest of the Canaries, starting in the early 15th century, many natives were outright killed by the Spanish or died of exposure to new pathogens during the social disruption. Eventually, any remaining survivors were assimilated into the new Spanish population and associated culture. Elements of their original culture survive within Canarian customs and traditions, such as Silbo (the whistled language of La Gomera Island), as well as some lexicon of Canarian Spanish. Some scholars have classified the destruction of the Guanche people and culture as an example of colonial genocide.

In 2017, the first genome-wide data analysis of the ethnic Guanche confirmed a North African origin, genetically being most similar to ancient North African Berber peoples of the mainland African deserts.

== Etymology ==
The native term &quot;guanachinet&quot; literally translated means &quot;person of Tenerife&quot; (from &quot;Guan&quot; = person and &quot;Achinet&quot; = Tenerife). It was modified, according to Juan Núñez de la Peña, by the Castilians into &quot;Guanche&quot;. 
Though etymologically an ancient, Tenerife-specific term, the word &quot;Guanche&quot; is now used mostly to refer to the pre-Hispanic Indigenous inhabitants of the entire archipelago.

== Historical background ==
=== Prehistory ===
Genetic and linguistic evidence show that North African peoples made a significant contribution to the aboriginal population of the Canaries, notably, following desertification of the Sahara (post-6000 BC). There are ties between the Guanche language and the Berber languages of North Africa, particularly when comparing numeral systems. Research into the genetics of the Guanche population has led to the conclusion that they share an ancestry with Berber peoples who immigrated from around Western Sahara.

The islands were visited by a number of other peoples and representatives of distant civilizations during recorded history; the Numidians, Phoenicians, and Carthaginians all knew of the islands and made frequent visits, including expeditions dispatched from Mogador by Juba.

Based on Roman artifacts, found on and near the island of Lanzarote, the Romans visited the Canary Islands during their occupation of mainland North Africa between the 1st and 4th centuries AD; the artifacts found show that the Romans engaged in trade with the people of the island. However, there is no evidence of them ever settling on or invading the Canaries. Archaeology of the Canaries seems to reflect diverse levels of technology, with items differing widely from the Neolithic culture that would have been encountered by the Spanish, at the time of their conquest.

Scholars believe that the original settling by humans on the islands likely resulted in the extinction of uniquely-adapted endemic species, such as reptiles and mammals exhibiting insular gigantism; one example is believed to be &quot;Canariomys bravoi&quot;, the extinct giant rat of Tenerife.

Pliny the Elder, a Roman author and military officer drawing from the accounts of Juba II (ancient King of Mauretania), stated that a Mauretanian expedition to the islands, circa 50 BC, found the ruins of great buildings, albeit with no population to speak of. If this account is accurate, it may suggest that the Guanche were not the only inhabitants, or the first ones; alternatively, this could imply that the Mauretanian expedition did not explore the islands thoroughly.

Tenerife, specifically the archaeological site of the Cave of the Guanches in Icod de los Vinos, has provided evidence of habitation dating to the 6th century BC. This is based on the analyses of ceramics and pottery artifacts that were found inside the cave.

Historically, the Guanche were the first peoples of Tenerife. Their population seems to have lived in relative obscurity and isolation up until the time of Castilian conquest (ca. the 14th century); Genoese, Portuguese, and Castilian ships may have visited the archipelago earlier for trade purposes, from the second half of the 8th century onward. The Spanish gradually applied the term &quot;Guanche&quot; to the indigenous populations of all seven Canary Islands, with those living on Tenerife being the most important or powerful.

What remains of their language, Guanche—a few expressions, vocabulary words and the proper names of ancient chieftains, still borne by certain families—exhibits positive similarities with the Berber languages. The first reliable account of the Guanche language was provided by the Genoese explorer Nicoloso da Recco in 1341, with a translation of numbers used by the islanders.

According to European chroniclers, the Guanche did not possess a system of writing at the time of conquest; their potential writing system may have fallen into disuse, or aspects of it were simply overlooked by the colonizers. Inscriptions, glyphs, rock paintings and carvings are all quite abundant throughout the archipelago. Petroglyphs attributed to other Mediterranean civilizations have also been found on some of the islands. In 1752, Domingo Vandewalle, a military governor of Las Palmas, ventured to investigate the petroglyphs. Aquilino Padron, a priest at Las Palmas, catalogued inscriptions at El Julan, La Candía and La Caleta, all on El Hierro. In 1878, Dr. René Verneau discovered rock carvings in the ravines of Las Balos that resembled Libyan or Numidian script, dating from the time of Roman occupation or earlier. In other locations, Libyco-Berber script has been identified.

=== Pre-conquest exploration ===
The geographic accounts of Pliny the Elder and of Strabo mention the Fortunate Isles but do not report anything about their populations.

An account of the Guanche population may have been made around AD 1150 by the Arab geographer Muhammad al-Idrisi in the &quot;Nuzhatul Mushtaq&quot;, a book he wrote for King Roger II of Sicily. Al-Idrisi reports a journey in the Atlantic Ocean made by the Mugharrarin (&quot;the adventurers&quot;), a family of Andalusian seafarers from Lisbon. The only surviving version of this book, kept at the Bibliothèque Nationale de France, and first translated by Pierre Amédée Jaubert, reports that, after having reached an area of &quot;sticky and stinking waters,&quot; the Mugharrarin moved back and first reached an uninhabited Island (Madeira or Hierro), where they found &quot;a huge quantity of sheep, which its meat was bitter and inedible&quot;. They &quot;continued southward&quot; and reached another island where they were soon surrounded by barks and brought to &quot;a village whose inhabitants were often fair haired with long and flaxen hair and the women of a rare beauty.&quot; Among the villagers, one spoke Arabic and asked them where they came from. Then the king of the village ordered them to bring villagers back to the continent. There they were surprised to be welcomed by Berbers.

Apart from the marvelous and fanciful content of this history, this account suggests that the Guanche had sporadic contacts with populations from the mainland. Al-Idrisi described the Guanche men as tall and of a reddish-brown complexion.

During the 14th century, the Guanche are presumed to have had other contacts with Balearic seafarers from Spain. This is based on the Balearic artifacts found on several of the Canary Islands.

=== Castilian conquest ===
The Castilian conquest of the Canary Islands began in 1402, with the expedition of Jean de Béthencourt and Gadifer de la Salle to the island of Lanzarote. Gadifer invaded Lanzarote and Fuerteventura.

The other five islands fought back. El Hierro and the &quot;Bimbache&quot; population were the next to fall, then La Gomera, Gran Canaria, La Palma and in 1496, Tenerife.

In the First Battle of Acentejo (31 May 1494), called &quot;La Matanza&quot; (the slaughter), Guanche ambushed the Castilians in a valley and killed many. Only one in five of the Castilians survived, including the leader, Alonso Fernandez de Lugo.

Lugo later returned to the island with the alliance of the kings of the southern part of the island. He defeated the Guanches in the Battle of Aguere. The northern Menceyatos or provinces fell after the Second Battle of Acentejo with the defeat of the successor of Bencomo, Bentor, Mencey of Taoro—what is now the Orotava Valley—in 1496.

Various scholars have used the term &quot;genocide&quot; to describe the conquest of the Canary Islands. Mohamed Adikhari argues that the Canary Islands were the scene of &quot;Europe&#x27;s first overseas settler colonial genocide,&quot; and that the mass killing and enslavement of natives, along with forced deportation, sexual violence and confiscation of land and children constituted an attempt to &quot;destroy in whole&quot; the Guanche people. The tactics used in the Canary Islands in the 15th century served as a model for the Iberian colonisation of the Americas.

== Language ==

The native Guanche language is now known only through a few sentences and individual words, supplemented by several placenames. Many modern linguists propose that it belongs to the Berber branch of the Afroasiatic languages.

However, while there are recognizable Berber words (particularly with regards to agriculture) within the Guanche language, no Berber grammatical inflections have been identified; there is a large stock of vocabulary that does not bear any resemblance to Berber whatsoever.

Other strong similarities to the Berber languages are reflected in their counting system, while some authors suggest the Canarian branch would be a sister branch to the surviving continental Berber languages, splitting off during the early development of the language family and before the &quot;terminus post quem&quot; for the origin of Proto-Berber.

== System of beliefs ==
=== Religion and mythology ===

Little is known of the religion of the Guanches. There was a general belief in a supreme being, called Achamán in Tenerife, Acoran in Gran Canaria, Eraoranhan in Hierro, and Abora in La Palma. The women of Hierro worshipped a goddess called Moneiba. According to tradition, the male and female gods lived in mountains, from which they descended to hear the prayers of the people. On other islands, the natives venerated the sun, moon, earth, and stars. A belief in an evil spirit was general. The demon of Tenerife was called Guayota and lived at the peak of Teide volcano, which was the hell called Echeyde; in Tenerife and Gran Canaria, the minor demons took the form of wild black woolly dogs called Jucanchas in the first and Tibicenas in the latter, which lived in deep caves of the mountains, emerging at night to attack livestock and human beings.

In Tenerife, Magec (god of the Sun) and Chaxiraxi (the goddess mother) were also worshipped. In times of drought, the Guanches drove their flocks to consecrated grounds, where the lambs were separated from their mothers in the belief that their plaintive bleating would melt the heart of the Great Spirit. During the religious feasts, hostilities were held in abeyance, from war to personal quarrels.

Idols have been found in the islands, including the Idol of Tara (Museo Canario, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria) and the Guatimac (Museum Archaeological of Puerto de la Cruz in Tenerife). But many more figures have been found in the rest of the archipelago.

Most researchers agree that the Guanches performed their worship in the open, under sacred trees such as pine or drago, or near sacred mountains such as Mount Teide, which was believed to be the abode of the devil Guayota. Mount Teide was sacred to the aboriginal Guanches and since 2007 is a World Heritage Site. But sometimes the Guanches also performed worship in caves, as in &quot;Cave of Achbinico&quot; in Tenerife. Until the 20th century, there were in the Canary Islands (especially in northern Tenerife) individuals called &quot;Animeros.&quot; They were similar to healers and mystics with a syncretic beliefs combining elements of the Guanche religion and Christianity. As in other countries close to the islands (e.g. marabouts from the Maghreb), the Animeros were considered &quot;persons blessed by God.&quot;



=== Aboriginal priests ===
The Guanches had priests or shamans who were connected with the gods and ordained hierarchically:

=== Guatimac ===
=== Festivities ===
Beñesmen or Beñesmer was a festival of the agricultural calendar of the Guanches (the Guanche new year) to be held after the gathering of crops devoted to Chaxiraxi (on August 15). In this event the Guanches shared milk, gofio, sheep or goat meat. At the present time, this coincides with the pilgrimage to the Basilica of the Virgin of Candelaria (Patron of Canary Islands).

Among the cultural events are significant traces of aboriginal traditions at the holidays and in the current Romería Relief in Güímar (Tenerife) and the lowering of the Rama, in Agaete (Gran Canaria).

=== Funerals and mummies ===
Mummification was not commonly practiced throughout the islands but was highly developed on Tenerife in particular. In Gran Canaria there is currently a debate on the true nature of the mummies of the ancient inhabitants of the island, as researchers point out that there was no real intention to mummify the deceased and that the good conservation of some of them is due rather to environmental factors. In La Palma they were preserved by these environmental factors and in La Gomera, and El Hierro the existence of mummification is not verified. In Lanzarote and Fuerteventura this practice is ruled out.

The Guanches embalmed their dead; many mummies have been found in an extreme state of desiccation, each weighing not more than . Two almost inaccessible caves in a vertical rock by the shore from Santa Cruz on Tenerife are said still to contain remains. The process of embalming seems to have varied. In Tenerife and Gran Canaria, the corpse was simply wrapped up in goat and sheep skins, while in other islands a resinous substance was used to preserve the body, which was then placed in a cave difficult to access, or buried under a tumulus. The work of embalming was reserved for a special class, with women tending to female corpses, and men for the male ones. Embalming seems not to have been universal.

In the Museo de la Naturaleza y el Hombre (Santa Cruz de Tenerife) mummies of original inhabitants of the Canary Islands are displayed.

In 1933, the largest Guanche necropolis of the Canary Islands was found, at Uchova in the municipality of San Miguel de Abona in the south of the island of Tenerife. This cemetery was almost completely looted; it is estimated to have contained between 60 and 74 mummies.

=== Sacrifices ===
Although little is known about this practice among them, it has been shown that they performed both animal sacrifices and human sacrifices.

In Tenerife during the summer solstice, the Guanches killed livestock and threw them into a fire as an offering to the gods. Bethencourt Alfonso has claimed that goat kids were tied by the legs, alive, to a stake so that they could be heard bleating by the gods. It is likely that animals were also sacrificed on the other islands.

As for human sacrifices, in Tenerife it was the custom to throw a living child from the &quot;Punta de Rasca&quot; at sunrise at the summer solstice. Sometimes these children came from all parts of the island, even from remote areas of &quot;Punta de Rasca&quot;. It follows that it was a common custom of the island. On this island sacrificing other human victims associated with the death of the king, where adult men rushed to the sea are also known. Embalmers who produced the Guanche mummies also had a habit of throwing themselves into the sea one year after the king&#x27;s death.

Bones of children mixed with lambs and kids were found in Gran Canaria, and in Tenerife amphorae have been found with remains of children inside. This suggests a different kind of ritual infanticide than those who were thrown overboard.

Child sacrifice has been seen in other cultures, especially in the Mediterranean—Carthage (now Tunisia), Ugarit in what is now Syria, Cyprus and Crete.

== Political system ==

The political and social institutions of the Guanches varied. In some islands like Gran Canaria, hereditary autocracy by matrilineality prevailed, in others the government was elective. In Tenerife all the land belonged to the kings who leased it to their subjects. In Gran Canaria, suicide was regarded as honorable, and whenever a new king was installed, one of his subjects willingly honored the occasion by throwing himself over a precipice. In some islands, polyandry was practised; in others they were monogamous. Insult of a woman by an armed man was allegedly a capital offense. Anyone accused of a crime had to attend a public trial in Tagoror, a public court where those prosecuted were sentenced after a trial.

The island of Tenerife was divided into nine small kingdoms (&quot;menceyatos&quot;), each ruled by a king or &quot;Mencey&quot;. The Mencey was the ultimate ruler of the kingdom, and at times, meetings were held between the various kings. When the Castilians invaded the Canary Islands, the southern kingdoms joined the Castilian invaders on the promise of the richer lands of the north; the Castilians betrayed them after ultimately securing victory at the Battles of Aguere and Acentejo.

=== Kings (&quot;Menceys&quot;) of Tenerife ===
*Acaimo or Acaymo of Menceyato de Tacoronte
*Adjona of Menceyato de Abona
*Añaterve of Menceyato de Güímar
*Bencomo of Menceyato de Taoro
*Beneharo of Menceyato de Anaga
*Pelicar of Menceyato de Adeje
*Pelinor of Menceyato de Icode
*Romen of Menceyato de Daute
*Tegueste of Menceyato de Tegueste

In Tenerife, the grand Mencey Tinerfe and his father Sunta governed the unified island, which afterwards was divided into nine kingdoms by the children of Tinerfe.

== Clothes and weapons ==
Guanches wore garments made from goat skins or woven from plant fibers called Tamarcos, which have been found in the tombs of Tenerife. They had a taste for ornaments and necklaces of wood, bone and shells, worked in different designs. Beads of baked earth, cylindrical and of all shapes, with smooth or polished surfaces, mostly colored black and red, were fairly common. Dr. René Verneau suggested that the objects the Castilians referred to as &quot;pintaderas&quot;, baked clay seal-shaped objects, were used as vessels for painting the body in various colours. They manufactured rough pottery, mostly without decorations, or ornamented by making fingernail indentations.

Guanche weapons adapted to the insular environment (using wood, bone, obsidian and stone as primary materials), with later influences from medieval European weaponry. Basic armaments in several of the islands included javelins of 1 to 2 m in length (known as &quot;Banot&quot; on Tenerife); round, polished stones; spears; maces (common in Gran Canaria and Tenerife, and known as &quot;Magado&quot; and &quot;Sunta&quot;, respectively); and shields (small in Tenerife and human-sized in Gran Canaria, where they were known as &quot;Tarja&quot;, made of Drago wood and painted with geometric shapes). After the arrival of the Europeans, Guanche nobility from Gran Canaria were known to wield large wooden swords (larger than the European two-handed type) called &quot;Magido&quot;, which were said to be very effective against both infantrymen and cavalry. Weaponry made of wood was hardened with fire. These armaments were commonly complemented with an obsidian knife known as &quot;Tabona&quot;.
Dwellings were situated in natural or artificial caves in the mountains. In areas where cave dwellings were not feasible, they built small round houses and, according to the Castilians, practiced crude fortification.

==Genetics==

 extracted 71 samples of mtDNA from Guanches buried at numerous Canary Islands (c. 1000 AD). The examined Guanches were found to have closest genetic affinities to modern Moroccan Berbers, Canary Islanders and Spaniards. They carried a significantly high amount of the maternal haplogroup U6b1. U6b1 is found at very low frequencies in North Africa today, and it was suggested that later developments have significantly altered the Berber gene pool. The authors of the study suggested that the Guanches were descended from migrants from mainland North Africa related to the Berbers, and that the Guanches contributed 42–73% to the maternal gene pool of modern Canary Islanders.

 extracted 30 samples of Y-DNA from Guanches of the Canary Islands. These belonged to the paternal haplogroups E1a*, (3.33%), E1b1b1a* (23.33%), E1b1b1b* (26.67%), I* (6.67%), J1* (16.67%), K*, P* (3.33%), and R1b1b2 (10.00%). E1a*, E1b1b1a* and E1b1b1b* are common lineages among Berbers, and their high frequency among the Guanches were considered evidence that they were migrants from North Africa. R1b1b2 and I* are very common in lineages in Europe, and their moderate frequency among the examined Guanche males was suggested to have been a result of prehistoric gene flow from Europe into the region across the Mediterranean. It was found that Guanche males contributed less to the gene pool of modern Canary Islanders than Guanche females (as would be expected from the extremely bloody conquest of the islands). Haplogroups typical among the Guanche have been found at high frequencies in Latin America, suggesting that descendants of the Guanche played an active role in the Spanish colonization of the Americas.

 extracted the mtDNA of 30 Guanches from La Palma, (Benahoaritas). 93% of their mtDNA haplogroups were found to be of West Eurasian origin, while 7% were of sub-Saharan African origin. About 15% of their West Eurasian maternal lineages are specific to Europe and the Near East rather than North Africa, suggesting that the Benahoaritas traced partial descent from either of these regions. The examined Benahoaritas were found to have high frequencies of the maternal haplogroups U6b1 and H1-16260. U6b1 has not been found in North Africa, while H1-16260 is &quot;extremely rare.&quot; The results suggested that the North African population from whom the Benahoaritas and other Guanches descended has been largely replaced by subsequent migrations.

 studies the origins of the maternal haplogroup U6, which is characteristic of Guanches. It was suggested that the U6 was brought to North Africa by Cro-Magnon-like humans from the Near East during the Upper Paleolithic, who were probably responsible for the formation of the Iberomaurusian culture. It was also suggested that the maternal haplogroup H1, also frequent among Guanches, was brought to North Africa during the Holocene by migrants from Iberia, who may have participated in the formation of the Capsian culture. In a further study, suggested that U6 was brought to the Levant from Central Europe in the Upper Paleolithic by people of the Aurignacian culture, forming the Levantine Aurignacian (c. 33000 BC), whose descendants had then further spread U6 as part of a remigration into Africa. U6b1a was suggested to have been brought to the Canary Islands during the initial wave of settlement by Guanches, while U6c1 was suggested to have been brought in a second wave.

 examined the mtDNA of Guanches of La Gomera (Gomeros). 65% of the examined Gomeros were found to be carriers of the maternal haplogroup U6b1a. The Gomero appeared to be descended from the earliest wave of settlers to the Canary Islands. The maternal haplogroups T2c1 and U6c1 may have been introduced in a second wave of colonization affecting the other islands. It was noted that 44% of modern La Gomerans carry U6b1a. It was determined that La Gomerans have the highest amount of Guanche ancestry among modern Canary Islanders.

 examined the remains of a large number of Guanches of El Hierro (Bimbache) buried at Punta Azul, El Hierro (c. 1015–1200 AD). The 16 samples of Y-DNA extracted belonged to the paternal haplogroups E1a (1 sample), E1b1b1a1 (7 samples) and R1b1a2 (R1b-M269) (7 samples). All the extracted samples of mtDNA belonged to the maternal haplogroup H1-1626. The Bimbache were identified as descendants of the first wave of Guanche settlers on the Canary Islands, as they lacked the paternal and maternal lineages identified with the hypothetical second wave.

 examined the atDNA of 11 Guanches buried at Gran Canaria and Tenerife. The 3 samples of Y-DNA extracted all belonged to the paternal haplogroup E1b1b1b1a1 (E-M183), while the 11 samples of mtDNA extracted belonged to the maternal haplogroups H1cf, H2a, L3b1a (3 samples), T2c12, U6b1a (3 samples), J1c3 and U6b. It was determined that the examined Guanches were genetically similar between the 7th and 11th centuries AD, and that they displayed closest genetic affinity to modern North Africans, &quot;but with a tendency (especially for individuals from Gran Canaria) to occupy a space outside modern Northwest African variation, closer to Europeans.&quot; The evidence supported the notion that the Guanches were descended from a Berber-like population who had migrated from mainland North Africa. Among modern populations, Guanches were also found to be genetically similar to modern Sardinians. Some models found the Guanche to be more closely related to modern Sardinians than modern North Africans. They were determined to be carriers of Early European Farmer (EEF) ancestry, which probably spread into North Africa from Iberia during the Neolithic, or perhaps also later. One Guanche was also found to have ancestry related to European hunter-gathers, providing further evidence of prehistoric gene flow from Europe. It was estimated that modern Canary Islanders derive 16–31% of their atDNA from the Guanches. Furthermore, according to the phenotype analysis, these Guanche samples were showing light and medium skin, dark hair and brown eyes.

 examined remains at the Late Neolithic site of Kelif el Boroud, Morocco (c. 3780–3650 BC). The Kelif el Boroud people were modeled as being equally descended from people buried at the Neolithic sites of Ifri N&#x27;Ammar, Morocco (c. 5325–4786 BC) and the Cave of El Toro, Spain (c. 5280–4750 BC). The Kelif el Boroud were thus determined to have carried 50% EEF ancestry, which may have spread with the Cardial Ware culture from Iberia to North Africa during the Neolithic. After the Kelif el Boroud people, additional European ancestry may have been brought to the region from Iberia by people of the Bell Beaker culture. Guanches were found to the genetically very similar to the Kelif el Boroud people. In a 2020 review Fregel et al. identified European Bronze Age ancestry in the Guanches, which could be explained by &quot;the presence of Bell-Beaker pottery in the North African archaeological record,&quot; as well as observing a certain admixture &quot;possibly related to trans-Saharan migrations&quot;.

 examined the mtDNA of 48 Guanches buried on all the islands of the Canaries. They were found to be carrying maternal lineages characteristic of North Africa, Europe and the Near East, with Eurasian lineages centered around the Mediterranean being the most common. It was suggested that some of these Eurasian haplogroups had arrived in the region through Chalcolithic and Bronze Age migrations from Europe. Genetic diversity was found to be the highest at Gran Canaria, Tenerife, and La Palma, while Lanzarote, Fuerteventura and particularly La Gomera and El Hierro had low diversity. Significant genetic differences were detected between Guanches of western and eastern islands, which supported the notion that Guanches were descended from two distinct migration waves. It was considered significant that 40% of all examined Guanches so far belonged to the maternal haplogroup H.

Serrano et al. 2023 analysed genome-wide data from 49 Guanche individuals, whose ancestry was modelled as comprising 73.3% Morocco Late Neolithic, 6.9% Morocco Early Neolithic, 13.4% Germany Bell Beaker and 6.4% Mota, on average. Germany Bell Beaker ancestry reached 16.2% and 17.9% in samples from Gran Canaria and Lanzarote respectively.

=== Mitochondrial DNA ===
Regarding mitochondrial DNA, the maternal lineages are characterized by the prevalence of North-African lineages, followed by Europeans and finally in a small percentage by Sub-Saharans. According to different studies, the percentages are the following:

=== Autosomal DNA ===
A 2018 study of 400 adult men and women of all the islands, except La Graciosa, examined the relationship of Canarian genetic diversity with the more prevalent complex diseases in the archipelago. It detected that Canarian DNA shows distinctive genetics, resulting from variables such as the geographical isolation of the islands, environmental adaptations and the historical mixture of Pre-Hispanic population of the archipelago (coming from North Africa), with European and Sub-Saharan individuals. Specifically, the study estimated that the Canarian population, at an autosomal level, is 75% European, 22% North-African and 3% Sub-Saharan.

The table below shows the genomic proportions of North African and Sub-Saharan African ancestry by island.

<doc id="148032" wikidata="Q4528098" url="?curid=148032" title="William Schutz">
<text>William Schutz (December 19, 1925 – November 9, 2002) was an American psychologist.

==Biography==
Schutz was born in Chicago, Illinois. He practiced at the Esalen Institute in the 1960s. He later became the president of BConWSA International. He received his Ph.D. from UCLA. In the 1950s, he was part of the peer-group at the University of Chicago&#x27;s Counseling Center that included Carl Rogers, Thomas Gordon, Abraham Maslow and Elias Porter. He taught at Tufts University, Harvard University, University of California, Berkeley and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and was chairman of the holistic studies department at Antioch University until 1983.

In 1958, Schutz introduced a theory of interpersonal relations he called Fundamental Interpersonal Relations Orientation (FIRO). According to the theory three dimensions of interpersonal relations were deemed to be necessary and sufficient to explain most human interaction: &quot;Inclusion&quot;, &quot;Control&quot; and &quot;Affection&quot;. These dimensions have been used to assess group dynamics.

Schutz also created FIRO-B, a measurement instrument with scales that assess the behavioral aspects of the three dimensions. His advancement of FIRO Theory beyond the FIRO-B tool was most obvious in the change of the &quot;Affection&quot; scale to the &quot;Openness&quot; scale in the &quot;FIRO Element-B&quot;. This change highlighted his newer theory that behavior comes from feelings (&quot;FIRO Element-F&quot;) and the self-concept (&quot;FIRO Element-S&quot;). &quot;Underlying the behavior of openness is the feeling of being likable or unlikeable, lovable or unlovable. I find you likable if I like myself in your presence, if you create an atmosphere within which I like myself.&quot;

W. Schutz authored more than ten books and many articles. His work was influenced by Alexander Lowen, Ida Pauline Rolf and Moshe Feldenkrais. As a body therapist he led encounter group workshops focussing on the underlying causes of illnesses and developing alternative body-centered cures. His books, &quot;Profound Simplicity&quot; and &quot;The Truth Option,&quot; address this theme. He brought new approaches to body therapy that integrated truth, choice (freedom), (self) responsibility, self-esteem, self-regard and honesty into his approach.

In his books one encounters the concept of energy cycles (e.g. Schutz 1979) which a person goes through or call for completion. The single steps of the energy cycles are: motivation – prepare – act – feel.

Schutz died at his home in Muir Beach, California in 2002.

== Influences ==

While teaching and doing research at Harvard, the University of Chicago, the University of California at Berkeley, and other institutions, Schutz focused on psychology but also studied philosophy—in particular, the scientific method, the philosophy of science, logical empiricism, and research design (with both Hans Reichenbach and Abraham Kaplan). He also worked with Paul Lazarsfeld, the well-known sociologist and methodologist and Elvin Semrad, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and clinical director in charge of psychiatric residency training at the Massachusetts Mental Health Center. For Schutz, Semrad was a key figure, &quot;a brilliant, earthy psychoanalyst who became my main mentor about groups.&quot;

An avid student, Schutz also learned T-group methodology (&quot;T&quot; for training) at the National Training Laboratories (NTL) at Bethel, Maine, psychosynthesis, a spiritually oriented technique involving imagery, devised by an Italian contemporary of Freud named Roberto Assagioli, psychodrama with Hannah Weiner, bioenergetics with Alexander Lowen and John Pierrakos, Rolfing with Ida Rolf, and Gestalt Therapy with Paul Goodman. In his own words, &quot;I tried everything physical, psychological, and spiritual—all diets, all therapies, all body methods, jogging, meditating, visiting a guru in India, and fasting for thirty-four days on water. These experiences counterbalanced my twenty years in science and left me with a strong desire to integrate the scientific with the experiential.&quot;

<doc id="148033" wikidata="Q7229209" url="?curid=148033" title="Pope Julius (card game)">
<text>Pope Julius, or Pope July, is a gambling card game of the 16th century for four or more players. Players included King Henry VIII and it appears to have been one of his and Anne Boleyn&#x27;s favourite pastimes.

Very little is known about the game, and its existence is known to be attested only by three written sources, those being:

*c. 1521 - John Skelton, &quot;Speke, parrot&quot;
*1532 - anon, &quot;Privy Purse Expences of King Henry VIII&quot; (30 November 1532)
*c. 1596 - Sir John Harington, &quot;A Treatise on Playe&quot;, in &quot;Nugae antiquae&quot; (1769)

Some sources speculate that it was the precursor to the game of Pope Joan.

<doc id="148034" wikidata="Q332140" url="?curid=148034" title="Edgar, King of Scotland">
<text>Edgar or Étgar mac Maíl Choluim (Modern Gaelic: &quot;Eagar mac Mhaoil Chaluim&quot;), nicknamed Probus, &quot;the Valiant&quot; (c. 1074 – 8 January 1107), was King of Alba (Scotland) from 1097 to 1107. He was the fourth son of Malcolm III and Margaret of Wessex but the first to be considered eligible for the throne after the death of his father.

== Reign ==
Edgar claimed the kingship in early 1095, following the murder of his half-brother Duncan II in late 1094 by Máel Petair of Mearns, a supporter of Edgar&#x27;s uncle Donald III. His older brother Edmund sided with Donald, presumably in return for an appanage and acknowledgement as the heir of the aged and son-less Donald.

Edgar received limited support from William II of England as Duncan had before him; however, the English king was occupied with a revolt led by Robert de Mowbray, Earl of Northumbria, who appears to have had the support of Donald and Edmund. Rufus campaigned in northern England for much of 1095, and during this time Edgar gained control only of Lothian. A charter issued at Durham at this time names him &quot;... son of Máel Coluim King of Scots ... possessing the whole land of Lothian and the kingship of the Scots by the gift of my lord William, king of the English, and by paternal heritage&quot;.

Edgar&#x27;s claims had the support of his brothers Alexander and David – Ethelred was Abbot of Dunkeld, and Edmund was divided from his siblings by his support of Donald – and his uncle Edgar Ætheling as these witnessed the charter at Durham.

William Rufus spent 1096 in Normandy which he bought from his brother Robert Curthose, and it was not until 1097 that Edgar received further support which led to the defeat of Donald and Edmund in a hard-fought campaign led by Edgar Ætheling.

Although Geoffrey Gaimar claimed that Edgar owed feudal service to William Rufus, it is clear from Rufus&#x27;s agreement to pay Edgar 40 or 60 shillings a day maintenance when in attendance at the English court that this is untrue. In any event, he did attend the court on a few occasions. On 29 May 1099, for example, Edgar served as sword-bearer at the great feast to inaugurate Westminster Hall. After William Rufus&#x27;s death, however, Edgar ceased to appear at the English court. He was not present at the coronation of Henry I.

The inheritance of the Scottish crown was not primogeniture as Duncan II had a legitimate son and heir in the person of William fitz Duncan. With Donald and Edmund removed, however, Edgar was uncontested king of Scots, and his reign incurred no major crises. Compared with his rise to power, Edgar&#x27;s reign is obscure. One notable act was his gift of a camel (or perhaps an elephant), presumably a &quot;souvenir&quot; of the First Crusade, to his fellow Gael Muirchertach Ua Briain, High King of Ireland.

In 1098, Edgar signed a treaty with Magnus Barefoot, King of Norway, setting the boundary between Scots and Norwegian claims in the west. By ceding claims to the Hebrides and Kintyre to Magnus, Edgar acknowledged the practical realities of the existing situation. Edgar&#x27;s religious foundations included a priory at Coldingham in 1098, associated with the Convent of Durham. At Dunfermline Abbey he sought support from Anselm of Canterbury with his mother&#x27;s foundation from which the monks of Canterbury may have been expelled by Domnall Bán.

Edgar died in Edinburgh on 8 January 1107 and was buried at Dunfermline Abbey. Unmarried and childless, he acknowledged his brother Alexander as his successor. Edgar&#x27;s will also granted David an appanage in &quot;Cumbria&quot; (the lands of the former Kingdom of Strathclyde), and perhaps also in southern parts of Lothian. David would later be known as Prince of the Cumbrians.

== Contradictory account of his death ==
There is a contradictory account of his death, recorded by Orderic Vitalis (12th century). According to this account, Edgar was killed by his uncle Donald III, while Donald III was killed by Alexander I. This account reports: &quot;On the death of Malcolm [III], king of the Scots, great divisions rose among them, in reference to the succession to the crown. Edgar, the king&#x27;s eldest son, assumed it as his lawful right, but Donald, King Malcolm&#x27;s brother, having usurped authority, opposed him with great cruelty, and at length, the brave youth [Edgar] was murdered by his uncle. Alexander [I], however, his brother, slew Donald, and ascended the throne; being thus the avenger as well as the successor of his brother...&quot;

Benjamin Hudson dismisses the story as &quot;completely false&quot;. But its existence points to the circulation of &quot;incorrect&quot; tales about the monarchs of the late 11th century. Verses of &quot;The Prophecy of Berchán&quot; allude to the murder of another Scottish king: &quot;Alas a king will take sovereignty for four nights and one month; I think it is grievous that the Gaels will boast, woe to him who celebrates him. ... A son of the woman of the English... I think it is wretched, that his brother will kill him.&quot; The English woman is obviously Saint Margaret, the consort of Malcolm III. But none of her children, male or female, are known to have been killed by one of their own siblings. The confusion probably derives from the murder of their half-sibling Duncan II of Scotland, son of Malcolm III and his first wife Ingibiorg Finnsdottir. A note in the Annals of Ulster claims that Duncan II was murdered by his brothers Donmall [Donald] and Edmund. As Duncan had no brothers by these names, the text probably points to his uncle Donald III and half-brother Edmund of Scotland, though later texts identify a noble by the name of Máel Petair of Mearns as the actual murderer.

<doc id="148035" wikidata="Q356602" url="?curid=148035" title="Donald III of Scotland">
<text>Donald III (Medieval Gaelic: &quot;Domnall mac Donnchada&quot;; Modern Gaelic: &quot;Dòmhnall mac Dhonnchaidh&quot;; –1099) was King of Alba (Scotland) from 1093–1094 and 1094–1097. He was known as &quot;Domnall Bán&quot; or &quot;Donald the Fair&quot;, anglicized as Donalbain.

== Early life ==
Donald was born about 1033, during the reign of his great-grandfather King Malcolm II. He was the second known son of the king&#x27;s grandson, Duncan. Malcolm died when Donald was a baby, at age 80, and Donald&#x27;s father became king. King Duncan I however, perished in 1040 when Donald was still a boy, killed by Mormaer Macbeth, yet another grandson of King Malcolm II, who usurped his place as king.

Following his father&#x27;s death, Donald went into hiding in Ireland for 17 years, for fear that he would be killed by Macbeth. His elder brother, Malcolm, went to England. It was during this time that Malcolm&#x27;s grandfather, Crínán of Dunkeld, who was married to Malcolm II&#x27;s daughter, was killed fighting Macbeth. When Malcolm grew to manhood, he overthrew Macbeth and became the new king. Donald was 25 years old at that time.

Donald&#x27;s activities during the reign of his elder brother Malcolm III (Máel Coluim mac Donnchada) are not recorded. It appears that he was not his brother&#x27;s chosen heir, contrary to earlier custom, but that Malcolm had designated Edward, his eldest son by Margaret of Wessex, as the king to come. If this was Malcolm&#x27;s intent, his death and that of Edward on campaign in Northumbria in November 1093 (see Battle of Alnwick (1093)) confounded his plans. These deaths were followed very soon afterwards by that of Queen Margaret.

== Kingship ==
John of Fordun reports that Donald invaded the kingdom &quot;at the head of a numerous band&quot; after Queen Margaret&#x27;s death, and laid siege to Edinburgh with Malcolm&#x27;s sons by Margaret inside. Fordun has Margaret&#x27;s brother Edgar Ætheling take his nephews to England to keep them safe. 
Andrew of Wyntoun&#x27;s much simpler account has Donald becoming king and banishing his nephews. The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; records only that Donald was chosen as king and expelled the English from the court.

In May 1094, Donald&#x27;s nephew Duncan (Donnchad mac Maíl Coluim), son of Malcolm and his first wife, Ingibiorg Finnsdottir, invaded at the head of an army of Anglo-Normans and Northumbrians, aided by his half-brother Edmund and his father-in-law Gospatric, Earl of Northumbria. This invasion succeeded in placing Duncan on the throne, but an uprising defeated his allies and he was compelled to send away his foreign troops. Duncan was then killed on 12 November 1094 by Máel Petair, Mormaer of Mearns. The Annals of Ulster say that Duncan was killed on the orders of Donald (incorrectly called his brother) and Edmund.

Donald resumed power, probably with Edmund as his designated heir. Donald was an elderly man by then, at around 62 years old, and without any known sons, so that an heir was clearly required. William of Malmesbury says that Edmund bargained &quot;for half the kingdom&quot;, suggesting that Donald granted his nephew an appanage to rule.

Edgar, eldest surviving son of Malcolm and Margaret, obtained the support of William Rufus, although other matters delayed Edgar&#x27;s return on the coat-tails of an English army led by his uncle Edgar Ætheling. Donald&#x27;s fate is not entirely clear. William of Malmesbury tells us that he was &quot;slain by the craftiness of David [the later David I] ... and by the strength of William [Rufus]&quot;. The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; says of Donald that he was expelled, while the Annals of Tigernach have him blinded by his brother. John of Fordun, following the king lists, writes that Donald was &quot;blinded, and doomed to eternal imprisonment&quot; by Edgar. The place of his imprisonment was said to be Rescobie, by Forfar, in Angus. The old ex-king would die at the age of 67 in 1099, in prison. The sources differ as to whether Donald was first buried at Dunfermline Abbey or Dunkeld Cathedral but agree that his remains were later moved to Iona.

== Descendants ==
Donald left one known child, a daughter Bethoc, who married Uchtred (or Hadrian) de Tyndale, Lord of Tyndale. Uchtred and Bethoc had a daughter, Hextilda, married Richard Comyn, Justiciar of Lothian. The claims of 
John Comyn II of Badenoch, Lord of Badenoch to the crown in the Great Cause came from Donald through Bethóc and Hextilda. Ladhmann son of Domnall, &quot;grandson of the King of Scots&quot; who died in 1116, might have been a son of Donald.

== Fictional depictions ==

The minor character of Donalbain in William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Macbeth&quot; represents Donald III.

<doc id="148037" wikidata="Q332136" url="?curid=148037" title="Malcolm II of Scotland">
<text>Máel Coluim mac Cinaeda (; anglicised Malcolm II; c. 954 – 25 November 1034) was King of Alba (Scotland) from 1005 until his death in 1034. He was one of the longest-reigning Scottish kings of that period.

He was a son of Cinaed mac Maíl Choluim or King Kenneth II and The Prophecy of Berchán, (which referred to him as Forranach, &quot;the Destroyer&quot;), says his mother was &quot;a woman of Leinster&quot;. His mother may have been a daughter of a Uí Dúnlainge king of Leinster. 

To the Irish annals, which recorded his death, Malcolm was &quot;ard rí Alban&quot;, High King of Scotland, but his fellow kings of the geographical area of modern Scotland included the king of Strathclyde, who ruled much of the south-west, various Norse–Gaels kings on the western coast and the Hebrides and his nearest and most dangerous rivals, the kings or &quot;mormaers&quot; of Moray.

Since he did not have any surviving sons, Malcolm pursued a strategy of marrying his daughters into these regional dynasties, which helped create stability in his reign, and ensured that he became the grandfather of his successor Duncan I of Scotland, through his daughter Bethóc, and according to some sources, of Macbeth, King of Scotland, (about whom William Shakespeare later wrote the play Macbeth), through his daughter Donada. Later Scandinavian saga tradition claims that the mother of Earl Thorfinn the Mighty was a daughter of Malcolm, though the Malcolm in question may have been Máel Coluim of Moray.

== Early years and path to the throne ==
Malcolm II was the son of Kenneth II and grandson of Malcolm I. Fourteenth century Scottish chronicler John of Fordun writes that Malcolm defeated a Norwegian army &quot;in almost the first days after his coronation&quot;, but this is not reported elsewhere. Fordun says that the Bishopric of Mortlach (later moved to Aberdeen) was founded in thanks for this victory over the Norwegians.

Succession of Scottish kings at the time often involved murder, even patricide. The killer of Scottish King Constantine III in 997 is credited as being &quot;Kenneth, son of Malcolm&quot;. Since Kenneth II died in 995, this is considered an error, for either Kenneth III, (&quot;grand&quot;son of Malcolm I), who succeeded Constantine and stood to benefit, but by John of Fordham, for Malcolm II himself.

Whether Malcolm killed Constantine or not, he certainly killed Constantine&#x27;s successor Kenneth III in 1005, during a battle at Monzievaird in Strathearn.

== Raids into Bernicia ==
The first reliable report of Malcolm II&#x27;s reign is an attack in 1006 of territory under the Northumbrian rulers of Bamburgh (the lands between the River Forth and the River Tees, roughly ancient Bernicia), perhaps the customary &quot;crech ríg&quot; (literally royal prey, a raid by a new king made to demonstrate prowess in war), which involved a siege of Durham. This resulted in a heavy defeat to the Northumbrians, led by Uhtred of Bamburgh, ruler of Bamburgh and ealdorman of Northumbria, which is reported by the Annals of Ulster.

A second war against the Northumbrian English, probably in 1018, was more successful. The Battle of Carham, by the River Tweed, was a victory for the Scots led by Malcolm II and the men of Strathclyde led by their king, Owain Foel (Owen the Bald). By this time Eiríkr Hákonarson had been appointed ealdorman in Northumbria by his brother-in-law Cnut the Great, with limited in practice to the south around York, the former kingdom of Deira.

The twelfth-century tract known as &quot;De obsessione Dunelmi&quot; (&quot;The siege of Durham&quot;, associated with Symeon of Durham) claims that Uhtred&#x27;s brother Eadwulf Cudel surrendered Lothian to Malcolm II, possibly in the aftermath of the defeat at Carham. Some other lands between Dunbar and the Tweed as other parts of Lothian may have been under Scots control before this time.

== Relationships with neighbouring states ==
Malcolm demonstrated a rare ability to survive among early Scottish kings by reigning for 29 years. Brehon tradition provided that the successor to Malcolm was to be selected by him from among the descendants of king Aedh (Áed mac Cináeda), king of the Picts, with the consent of Malcolm&#x27;s ministers and of the Church. Perhaps in an attempt to end the devastating feuds in the north of Scotland, and influenced by the Norman model, Malcolm ignored tradition and was determined to retain succession within his own line. Since Malcolm had no son of his own, he negotiated a series of dynastic marriages of his daughters to men who might otherwise be his rivals, while securing the loyalty of their relatives, the principal chiefs. The throne passed to his grandson through his eldest daughter.

=== Dynastic marriages of his daughters ===
Although the identity of Malcolm&#x27;s wives and queens are unknown, he did have at least one and probably three daughters. Malcolm married his eldest daughter Bethóc to Crínán of Dunkeld, head of what became the house of Atholl or Dunkeld dynasty and later Abbot of Dunkeld. Malcolm may have had another daughter, possibly named Donada, who married Finlay, ruler of Moray, father of Macbeth, later King of Scotland. Later Scandinavian saga tradition claims that the mother of Earl Thorfinn the Mighty was a daughter of Malcolm, though the Malcolm in question may have been Máel Coluim of Moray.

==== Sources of the Macbeth connection ====
Fourteenth century Scottish chronicler and poet Andrew of Wyntoun suggests that &quot;a third daughter&quot; of Malcolm married Findláech of Moray, (Findláech mac Ruaidrí), father of Macbeth, King of Scotland, (Macbethad mac Findláech), which would make Malcolm to be Macbeth&#x27;s grandfather.

The only other early reference to Malcolm as Macbeth&#x27;s grandfather is Raphael Holinshed&#x27;s 1577 Chronicle of Scotland, an inspiration to William Shakespeare, which names &quot;Doada&quot; as a daughter of Malcolm II King of Scotland, and adds that she married &quot;Sinell the thane of Glammis, by whom she had issue one Makbeth&quot;.

Seventeenth century historian Frederic Van Bossen only lists two daughters, one whom he calls &quot;Beatrice, who married Albanacht the son of Crinan&quot;, and the other as &quot;Daboada, who was the mother of Macbeth, and the wife of Finell, the Thane of Angus and Glames and the son of Cruthneth&quot;.

=== Relationship with Cnut ===
The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; reports that Cnut The Great (Canute) led an army into Scotland on his return from a pilgrimage to Rome. The &quot;Chronicle&quot; dates this to 1031, but there are reasons to suppose that it should be dated to 1027. Contemporary Burgundian chronicler Rodulfus Glaber recounts the expedition soon afterward, describing Malcolm as &quot;powerful in resources and arms ... very Christian in faith and deed.&quot; Rodulfus claims that peace was made between Malcolm and Cnut through the intervention of Richard, Duke of Normandy, brother of Cnut&#x27;s wife Emma. Richard died circa 1027 and Rodulfus wrote close in time to the events.

Cnut came away only with a promise of peace and friendship, rather than the guarantee of aid on land and sea that previous kings such as Edgar and others had obtained. Contemporary sources say that Malcolm was accompanied by one or two other kings, certainly future King Mac Bethad, and perhaps Echmarcach mac Ragnaill, King of Mann and the Isles, and of Galloway. The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; remarks of the submission &quot;but he [Malcolm] adhered to that for only a little while&quot;. Cnut was soon occupied in Norway against Olaf Haraldsson and appears to have had no further involvement with Scotland.

Modern historian Duncan speculates that the quarrel between Cnut and Malcolm may have had its roots in Cnut&#x27;s pilgrimage to Rome, and the coronation of Holy Roman Emperor Conrad II, where Cnut and Rudolph III, King of Burgundy had the place of honour. If Malcolm were present, and the repeated mentions of his piety in the annals make it quite possible that he made a pilgrimage to Rome, then the coronation could have allowed Malcolm to publicly snub Cnut&#x27;s claims to overlordship.

=== Relationship with Orkney and Moray ===

Malcolm may also have married a daughter named Donada to Findláech of Moray (Findláech Mac Ruaidrí) and Macbeth, King of Scotland is presumed to be their son. Scandinavian saga tradition also claims that the mother of Earl Thorfinn the Mighty of Orkney was a daughter of Malcolm. However, as modern historian Duncan tells it, even if Malcolm exercised some control over Moray, the annals record several events pointing to a struggle for power in the north. Irish sources record that in 1020, Bethad mac Findláech&#x27;s, (later known as Macbeth, King of Scotland), father Findláech mac Ruaidrí was killed by the sons of his brother Máel Brigte, and that Máel Coluim mac Máil Brigti (Máel Coluim of Moray) took control of Moray. His death is reported in 1029.

Despite the accounts of the Irish annals, English and Scandinavian writers describe Mac Bethad as the rightful king of Moray, during descriptions of his meeting with Cnut in 1027, before the death of Malcolm mac Máil Brigti. Malcolm mac Máil Brigti was followed as king or earl by his brother Gillecomgain (Gille Coemgáin of Moray), husband of Gruoch, a granddaughter of King Kenneth III. It has been supposed that Mac Bethad was responsible for the killing of Gille Coemgáin in 1032, but if Mac Bethad had a cause for feud in the killing of his father in 1020, Malcolm too had reason to see Gille Coemgáin dead. Not only had Gillecomgan&#x27;s ancestors killed many of Malcolm&#x27;s kin, but Gillecomgan and his son Lulach might have been rivals for the throne, through the claim of Gruoch. Malcolm had no living sons, and the threat to his plans for the succession was obvious. As a result, the following year Gruoch&#x27;s brother or nephew, who might have eventually become king, was killed by Malcolm. Mac Bethad married Grouch after the death of Gillecomgain, presumably to retain power over Moray.

=== Relationship with Strathclyde ===
It has traditionally been supposed that king Owen the Bald (Owain Foel) of Strathclyde died at the battle of Carham and that the kingdom passed into the hands of the Scots afterwards. This rests on some very weak evidence. It is far from certain that Owen died at Carham, and it is reasonably certain that there were kings of Strathclyde as late as 1054, when Edward the Confessor sent Earl Siward to install &quot;Malcolm son of the king of the Cumbrians&quot;. The confusion is old, probably inspired by William of Malmesbury and embellished by John of Fordun, but there is no firm evidence that the kingdom of Strathclyde was a part of the kingdom of the Scots, rather than a loosely subjected kingdom, before the time of Malcolm II of Scotland&#x27;s great-grandson Malcolm III.

== Succession ==
By the 1030s Malcolm&#x27;s sons, if he had any, were dead. The only evidence that he did have a son or sons is in Rodulfus Glaber&#x27;s chronicle where Cnut is said to have stood as godfather to &quot;a son of Malcolm&quot;. His grandson Thorfinn would have been unlikely to be accepted as king by the Scots, and he chose the sons of his other daughter, Bethóc, who was married to Crínán, lay abbot of Dunkeld, and perhaps Mormaer of Atholl. It may be no more than coincidence, but in 1027 the Irish annals had reported the burning of Dunkeld, although no mention is made of the circumstances. Malcolm&#x27;s chosen heir, and the first &quot;tánaise ríg&quot; certainly known in Scotland, was Duncan.

If Macbeth was Malcolm II&#x27;s grandson, then when Macbeth&#x27;s soldiers killed Duncan I, before Macbeth took the throne, Malcolm II would have had one grandson kill another to succeed the first as king.

== Death and posterity ==

Marianus Scotus gives the date of Malcolm&#x27;s death as 25 November 1034. The king lists say that he died at Glamis Castle, variously describing him as a &quot;most glorious&quot; or &quot;most victorious&quot; king. The Annals of Tigernach report, &quot;Malcolm mac Cináeda, king of Scotland, the honour of all the west of Europe, died&quot;. The Prophecy of Berchán, perhaps the inspiration for John of Fordun and Andrew of Wyntoun&#x27;s accounts where Malcolm is killed fighting bandits, says that he died by violence, fighting &quot;the parricides&quot;.

Marianus tells us that Malcolm&#x27;s grandson Duncan I became king and ruled for five years and nine months. Given that Duncan&#x27;s subsequent death in 1040 is described as being &quot;at an immature age&quot; in the Annals of Tigernach, he must have been a very young man in 1034. Modern historian Duncan speculates that the absence of any effective opposition to Duncan&#x27;s youthful kingship suggests that Malcolm had thoroughly dealt with any succession issues before he died.

Tradition, dating from Fordun&#x27;s time if not earlier, knew the Pictish stone now called &quot;Glamis 2&quot; as &quot;King Malcolm&#x27;s grave stone&quot;. The stone is a Class II stone, apparently formed by re-using a Bronze Age standing stone. Its dating is uncertain, with dates from the 8th century onwards having been proposed. While an earlier date is favoured, an association with accounts of Malcolm&#x27;s has been proposed on the basis of the iconography of the carvings.

Malcolm&#x27;s putative pilgrimage to Rome, and other long-distance journeys, while not confirmed, were far from unusual. Thorfinn Sigurdsson, Cnut and Mac Bethad all travelled widely. Dyfnwal of Strathclyde died on a pilgrimage to Rome in 975 as did Máel Ruanaid uá Máele Doraid, king of the Cenél Conaill, in 1025.

Not a great deal is known of Malcolm&#x27;s activities beyond the wars and killings. The Book of Deer records that Malcolm &quot;gave a king&#x27;s dues in Biffie and in Pett Meic-Gobraig, and two davochs&quot; to the monastery of Old Deer. He was also probably not the founder of the Bishopric of Mortlach-Aberdeen.

<text>Cináed mac Duib (Modern Gaelic: &quot;Coinneach mac Dhuibh&quot;; c. 966 – c. 25 March 1005), anglicised as Kenneth III, and nicknamed An Donn (&quot;the Chief&quot; or &quot;the Brown&quot;), was King of Alba (Scotland) from 997 to 1005. He was the son of Dub (Dub mac Maíl Coluim). Many of the Scots sources refer to him as Giric son of Kenneth son of Dub, which is taken to be an error. An alternate explanation is that Kenneth had a son, Giric, who ruled jointly with his father.

== Reign and descendants ==
The primary sources concerning the life and &quot;reign&quot; of Giric include chronicle entries dating to the years 1251 and 1317. They can be found in &quot;The Chronicles of the Picts and Scots&quot; of William Forbes Skene. The chronicle of John of Fordun (14th century) mentions Giric as &quot;Grim&quot; or &quot;Gryme&quot;, reporting him killed by King Malcolm II. Giric is not mentioned by earlier sources, which would make his existence questionable. John Bannerman theorised that &quot;mac Duib&quot;, the Gaelic patronymic of Kenneth III, evolved to the surnames &quot;Duff&quot; and &quot;MacDuff&quot;, and that Kenneth III could be a direct ancestor to Clan MacDuff, which produced all mormaers and earls of Fife from the 11th to the mid-14th century, noting that Giric could be the actual founder of the house, following a pattern of several Scottish clans seemingly founded by grandsons of their eponym.

The only event reported in Kenneth&#x27;s reign is the killing of Dúngal mac Cináeda by Gille Coemgáin mac Cináeda, by the Annals of the Four Masters s.a. 999. It is not certain that this refers to events in Scotland, and whether one or both were sons of this Kenneth, or of King Kenneth II or some other person or persons, is not known. A &quot;Gilla Caemgein son of Cinaed&quot; also appears in the Annals of Ulster. An entry from the year 1035 reports that his unnamed granddaughter and her husband Cathal, son of Amalgaid, were both killed by Cellach, son of Dúnchad. This Cathal was reportedly king to the Western Laigin, possibly connected to the kings of Leinster. The context is unclear but it is likely that this is the same Gille Coemgáin, connected to Kenneth III.

Kenneth III was killed in battle at Monzievaird in Strathearn by king Malcolm II (Máel Coluim mac Cináeda), which took place about 25 March 1005. Whether Boite mac Cináeda was a son of this Kenneth, or of Kenneth II, is uncertain, although most propose this Kenneth. A son, or grandson of Boite, was reported to be killed by Malcolm II in 1032 in the Annals of Ulster. The relevant entry has been translated as: &quot;&quot;The grandson of Baete son of Cinaed was killed by Mael Coluim son of Cinaed&quot;.&quot;

Boite&#x27;s daughter, Gruoch (Gruoch ingen Boite meic Cináeda) – William Shakespeare&#x27;s Lady Macbeth – was wife firstly of Gille Coemgáin, mormaer of Moray, and secondly of King Macbeth; her son by Gille Coemgáin, Lulach (Lulach mac Gille Coemgáin), succeeded Macbeth as king of Scotland. The meic Uilleim, descendants of William fitz Duncan by his first marriage, were probably descended from Kenneth; and the Clann Mac Aoidh or Clan Mackay claim descent from Kenneth III through Lulach&#x27;s daughter.

The theory that Clan MacDuff were descendants of Kenneth III was based on their close connection to royalty. Andrew of Wyntoun reported that Malcolm III (reigned 1058–1093) had granted to a &quot;MacDuff, thane of Fife&quot; the privilege of enthroning the kings at their inauguration. John of Fordun has Malcolm III promise this same unnamed MacDuff that he will be the first man of the kingdom, second only to the king. This unnamed MacDuff appears frequently in stories connected to the rise of Malcolm III to the throne and was later immortalised in the Shakespearean character Macduff. The status of the successive heads of this clan as the &quot;&quot;senior inaugural official&quot; seems confirmed by records of the inauguration ceremonies of Alexander II (reigned 1214–1249) and Alexander III (reigned 1249–1286). Earlier heads of this house &quot;witnessed royal documents far more frequently&quot;&quot; than other members of the nobility; their names were often listed first among the lay witnesses, ahead of both the native Scottish nobility and the Anglo-Norman nobles. A number of 12th century heads of house served as justiciars of Scotia. Their leaders were named Donnchadh (Duncan), Mael-Coluim (Malcolm), and Causantin (Constantine), names shared by the royal family, making a close relation to the reigning royal house likely. Bannerman suggests that the MacDuffs had their own, legitimate claim to the Scottish throne, which they declined to pursue, having been compensated with privileges by Malcolm III and his descendants.

== Interpretation ==
During the 10th century, there were dynastic conflicts in Scotland between two rival lines of royalty: one descended from Causantín mac Cináeda (Constantine I, reigned 862–877), the other from his brother Áed mac Cináeda (reigned 877–878). John of Fordun claims that Kenneth II of Scotland (reigned 971–995) attempted to establish new succession rules, which would limit the right to the throne to his own descendants, excluding all other claimants. While Constantine III of Scotland (reigned 995–997) did manage to rise to the throne, he was the last known descendant of Áed. With his death, the rivalry between descendants of Causantin and Áed gave way to a rivalry between two new royal lines, both descended from Causantin.

One line descended from Kenneth II and was represented by his son Malcolm II. The other line descended from his brother Dub, King of Scotland (reigned 962–967) and was represented by Kenneth III. Neither Constantine III nor Kenneth III were able to extend their control to Cumbria, which likely served as a stronghold and powerbase for Malcolm II. He was the legitimate heir according to the succession rules of Kenneth II. When Malcolm II managed to kill Kenneth III, it signified the triumph of his line. He continued to rule to 1034, enjoying a long reign and managed to leave the throne to his own descendants.

However, the rivalry between the two lines survived Kenneth III. In 1033, Malcolm II killed a descendant of Kenneth III. Gruoch, another descendant of Kenneth III, was the consort of Macbeth, King of Scotland (reigned 1040–1057), whose rival Duncan I (reigned 1034–1040) was the grandson and heir of Malcolm II. They continued the bitter feud which had started in the previous century.

The contemporary kings of Strathclyde were also involved in the feud, though it is uncertain whether they had dynastic connections with the various Scottish rival lines. A theory that they represented another line of descendants of Donald II of Scotland (reigned 889–900) was based on the idea that Owen I of Strathclyde (d. 937) was the son of this king.

== Kenneth in fiction ==
The death of Kenneth III is mentioned in Lewis Grassic Gibbon&#x27;s novel &quot;Cloud Howe&quot;.

Kenneth III appeared in Gargoyles (comics), written by Greg Weisman.

<text>Constantine, son of Cuilén (Middle Gaelic: &quot;Causantín mac Cuiléin&quot;; Modern Gaelic: &quot;Còiseam mac Chailein&quot;), known in most modern regnal lists as Constantine III ( – 997), was king of Alba (Scotland) from 995 to 997. He was the son of King Cuilén. John of Fordun calls him, in Latin, Constantinus Calvus, which translates to Constantine the Bald. (Middle Gaelic: &quot;Causantín In Maol)&quot; Benjamin Hudson notes that insular authors from Ireland and Scotland typically identified rulers by sobriquets, noting for example the similarly named &quot;Eugenius Calvus&quot; (Owain Foel), an 11th century King of Strathclyde.

== Background ==
The Scottish monarchy of this period based its succession system on the rule of tanistry. All adult male descendants of previous monarchs were eligible for the throne. The kingship regularly switched from one line of royal descendants to another, though they were all closely related. Constantine was able to rise to the throne, despite his cousin and predecessors having a son of his own. The next two kings (Kenneth III and Malcolm II) were his cousins and killed their respective predecessor to gain the throne. The succession rule had the benefit of ensuring that there would always be an adult king on the throne, avoiding the usual problems of minority reigns. The various kings had their lands and power bases in different areas of Scotland, preventing any single region from claiming full domination of the others. This may have helped the country avoid significant secession movements. The downside was that any single king had to face adult rivals for the throne. His kinsmen had their own ambitions and would not wait for his death from natural causes to achieve them. The succession was often decided through acts of warfare and murder, resulting in early deaths and high casualty rates in the extended royal family.

During the 10th century, there were dynastic conflicts in Scotland between two rival lines of royalty. One descended from Causantín mac Cináeda (Constantine I, reigned 862–877), the other from his brother Áed mac Cináeda (reigned 877–878). Constantine III belonged to the second line. His royal ancestors included Áed himself, Constantine II of Scotland (reigned 900–943), Indulf (reigned 954–962), and Cuilén (reigned 967–971). Amlaíb of Scotland (reigned 973–977) was his paternal uncle. The alternation between the two royal lines seems to have been peaceful for a long time; Alfred P. Smyth regards this early phase as &quot;a century of kingly coexistence&quot;. The armed conflict between the lines seems to have started in the 960s when Cuilén challenged the rule of his cousin Dub, King of Scotland (962–967). The initial motivation behind the conflict is unclear. Smyth speculates that control over the Kingdom of Strathclyde might have been a major factor.

== Reign ==
According to John of Fordun (14th century), Kenneth II of Scotland (reigned 971–995) attempted to change the succession rules, allowing &quot;&quot;the nearest survivor in blood to the deceased king to succeed&quot;, thus securing the throne for his own descendants. He reportedly did so to specifically exclude Constantine (III) and Kenneth (III), called Gryme in this source. The two men then jointly conspired against him, convincing Lady Finella, daughter of Cuncar, Mormaer of Angus, to kill the king. She reportedly did so to achieve personal revenge, as Kenneth II had killed her own son. Entries in &quot;the Chronicles of the Picts and Scots&quot;, collected by William Forbes Skene, provide the account of Finnguala killing Kenneth II in revenge, but not her affiliation to Constantine or his cousins. These entries date to the 12th and 13th centuries. The Annals of Ulster simply record &quot;Cinaed son of Mael Coluim [Kenneth, son of Malcolm], king of Scotland, was deceitfully killed&quot;&quot;, with no indication of who killed him.

In the account of John of Fordun, Constantine the Bald, son of king Cullen and Gryme were &quot;&quot;plotting unceasingly the death of the king and his son&quot;. One day, Kenneth II and his companions went hunting into the woods, &quot;at no great distance from his own abode&quot;. The hunt took him to Fettercairn, where Finella resided. She approached him to proclaim her loyalty and invited him to visit her residence, whispering into his ear that she had information about a conspiracy plot. She managed to lure him to &quot;an out-of-the-way little cottage&quot;, where a booby trap was hidden. Inside the cottage was a statue, connected by strings to a number of crossbows. If anyone touched or moved the statue, he would trigger the crossbows and fall victim to their arrows. Kenneth II gently touched the statue and &quot;was shot through by arrows sped from all sides, and fell without uttering another word.&quot;&quot; Finella escaped through the woods and managed to join her abettors, Constantine III and Gryme. The hunting companions soon discovered the bloody king. They were unable to locate Finella but burned Fettercairn to the ground. Smyth dismisses the elaborate plotting and the mechanical contraption as mere fables, but accepts the basic details of the story, that the succession plans of Kenneth II caused his assassination. Alan Orr Anderson raised his own doubts concerning the story of Finella, which he considered &quot;semi-mythical&quot;. He noted that the feminine name Finnguala or Findguala means &quot;white shoulders&quot;, but suggested it derived from &quot;find-ela&quot; (white swan). The name figures in toponyms such as Finella Hill (near Fordoun) and Finella Den (near St Cyrus), while local tradition in The Mearns (Kincardineshire) has Finella walking atop the treetops from one location to the other. Anderson thus theorized that Finella could be a mythical figure, suggesting she was a local stream-goddess. A later passage of John of Fordun mentions Finele as mother of Macbeth, King of Scotland (reigned 1040–1057), but this is probably an error based on the similarity of names. Macbeth was son of Findláech of Moray, not of a woman called Finella.

The narrative of John of Fordun continues on to the reign of Constantine III. The day following the death of Kenneth II, Constantine the Bald, son of King Cullen usurped the throne. He had reportedly won the support of a number of nobles. The throne was also claimed by his cousin Malcolm II, son of Kenneth II, resulting in long-lasting division of the Scottish population, and conflict. Constantine III reigned for a year and a half [18 months], &quot;continually harassed by Malcolm and his illegitimate uncle, named Kenneth, a soldier of known prowess, who was his unwearied persecutor, and strove with his whole might to kill him, above all others.&quot; The Chronicle of the Kings of Scotts (&quot;Cronica Regum Scottorum&quot;, 12th century) shortens the reign to one year and four months (16 months). This source was a king-list compiled during the reign of William the Lion (reign 1165–1214), the last king mentioned in it. It has survived as the fifth text of the Poppleton manuscript. The existence of Kenneth, illegitimate uncle to Malcolm II, is not recorded in older sources. John of Fordun had apparently listed this Kenneth as an illegitimate son of Malcolm I of Scotland. Skene noted that this could be an error, and suggested that Kenneth, son of Malcolm was actually Kenneth III (Kenneth, son of Dubh). Kenneth III was a grandson of Malcolm I, rather than a son. Robert Shaw also doubted Kenneth II having a brother, illegitimate or not, who was also named Kenneth, pointing out that Malcolm I would have no reason to give the same name to two of his sons. Alex Woolf accepted the identification of Kenneth, son of Malcolm, with Kenneth III as a possible solution, but suggested a number of alternatives. Kenneth II himself was a Kenneth, son of Malcolm; his name could have been transferred to the killer of his successor by a faulty text. Or Kenneth, son of Malcolm, could be an accidental reversal of Malcolm (II), son of Kenneth. Or the killer could be a Kenneth, son of Malcolm who was not actually a member of the royal family.

The Annals of Tigernach report that Constantine was killed in a battle between the Scots in 997: &quot;A battle between the Scots, in which fell Constantine son of Culannan, king of Scotland, and many others.&quot; Another entry of the same year reports the death of Máel Coluim I of Strathclyde, though it is unclear if the two deaths were connected. A Chronicle of the Scots and Picts entry adds a number of details. Constantine, son of Culen, was killed by Kenneth, son of Malcolm (see above) at &quot;Rathinveramon&quot;. Constantine&#x27;s body was transported for burial to Iona. An entry in the Chronicle of Melrose describes &quot;King Constantine, Culen&#x27;s son, ... slain by the sword&quot; at the mouth of Almond in Tegalere. Again the killer is reported as Kenneth, son of Malcolm. John of Fordun&#x27;s narrative is more verbose. According to it, Constantine and Kenneth, son of Malcolm met one day in Laudonia (Lothian), by the banks of the River Almond. They engaged in battle, resulting in great slaughter on both sides and the death of both leaders. The guards of Constantine fled to Gryme (Kenneth III), &quot;&quot;colleague&quot; of their leader, allowing him to win the throne. However, news of the battle and its results reached Malcolm (II) in Cumbria. He learned of the death of his &quot;uncle and the rest of his faithful friends&quot;&quot;, and returned to gather reinforcements for his cause — though he was defeated in his initial conflict against Gryme.

John of Fordun consistently depicts Malcolm II holding Cumbria, emerging from it to combat Constantine III and Kenneth III (or his son Giric). In 1000, Malcolm reportedly defended Cumbria against the invasion of Æthelred the Unready, King of England. A relevant entry from the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; confirms that the Danish fleet which regularly raided England departed in 1000. This sudden relief from attack Æthelred used to gather his thoughts, resources, and armies: the fleet&#x27;s departure in 1000 &quot;allowed Æthelred to carry out a devastation of Strathclyde, the motive for which is part of the lost history of the north.&quot; But this indicates the limits to Constantine&#x27;s (and Kenneth&#x27;s) area of authority and informs us that Cumbria/Strathclyde lay beyond them. The opponent of Æthelred is not however specified by the Chronicle. Benjamin Hudson notes that John of Fordun was at times confused when depicting events of this period. The conflict depicted could actually be one between Æthelred and Kenneth III, Scottish and Anglo-Saxons armies fighting over control of Strathclyde — Aethelred wanting to restore Anglo-Saxon control in an area once conquered by Edmund the Elder (reigned 939–946), his grandfather. Perhaps he was desperately seeking to add some revenue to his treasury. Kenneth and the Scots were naturally unwilling to lose an area under their own rule for two generations.

== Location of death ==
James Young Simpson, who had written several articles on archaeology, observed that there were contradictory accounts concerning the location of Constantine&#x27;s death. While most accounts place the battle near the River Almond, there were two rivers of that name in Scotland, one in Perthshire and one in Lothian. George Chalmers identified the one in Perthshire to have been the intended location, but John of Fordun, the Scotichronicon, Hector Boece, and George Buchanan all point to the one in Lothian. The Chronicle of Melrose places the battle near the River Avon. Andrew of Wyntoun places it near the river &quot;Awyne&quot;. John Lesley places it near the River Annan, and considers it part of an ongoing invasion of Cumbria.

There are also contradictions concerning the location of the battle in relation to the river. The Scotichronicon, Melrose, and Wyntoun placed the battle at the river source, Melrose also adding the word &quot;Tegalere&quot; to describe the location. This might be the same as the &quot;Inregale regens&quot; of the Scotichronicon and the &quot;Indegale&quot; of the &quot;Liber Dumblain&quot;. Boece and Buchanan place the battle at a river mouth, where the Almond enters the Firth of Forth. That is where Cramond is located, called &quot;Crawmond&quot; in some editions of Hector Boece. The &quot;Nomina Regum Scottorum et Pictorum&quot;, discovered by Robert Sibbald at the St Andrews Cathedral Priory, places the death sites of both Domnall mac Ailpín and Constantine III at Rathveramoen (Rathinveramon), which etymologically derives from &quot;Rath Inver Amoen&quot;, the ráth at the mouth of the Amoen/Amon (the Almond) – &quot;viz.&quot;, the fortress Bertha in Perth, located at the mouth of the Almond. This is where the Almond joins the River Tay near Scone. Rathinveramon also lay at a short distance from Perth. Monzievaird, where Kenneth III was eventually killed, was about 15 miles from Perth. Forteviot, connected to Kenneth MacAlpin and his death, is also located in Perthshire.

Alex Woolf points out that the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba reports another location for the death of Domnall mac Ailpín: the palace of Cinnbelathoir, which was probably the same as the &quot;Bellathor&quot;, mentioned alongside &quot;Rigmonath&quot; as the major settlements of their time. Rigmonath has been identified with Rigmonaid, another name for St Andrews. Since Rigmonath was a church-settlement, perhaps the same was true for Bellathor. Seeking a likely location in the vicinity of Rathinveramon, Woolf suggests that Bellathor was an older name for Scone. The location was used for the inauguration ceremonies of kings, pointing at the significance of the area. Earlier the same area, including Forteviot, had served as the population centre of the southern Picts. The lack of fortification at Forteviot could indicate that it too served as a church site, one associated with the kings. Already in 728, there is mention of a Pictish royal stronghold at the hill of Moncrieffe, where the River Tay meets the River Earn. The location lies just outside Perth, 8 km from Forteviot, close to both Abernethy and Scone, suggesting that the area long served as a &quot;key royal centre&quot;, though the central location switched over time from Moncrieffe to Forteviot to Scone.

In the 18th century, there was a theory that the Cat Stane of Kirkliston could be connected to the final battle of Constantine III. The Reverend John Muckarsie alluded to this idea, in a text eventually collected in the Statistical Account of Scotland by Sir John Sinclair, 1st Baronet. In 1780, the founding meeting of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland took place. Its founder David Erskine, 11th Earl of Buchan mentioned the idea in his opening discourse. He noted an extant transcription of the Cat Stane&#x27;s text, reading: &quot;IN HOC TUM- JAC – CONSTAN- VIC- VICT&quot;. Where &quot;Constan&quot; was understood to have been Constantine IV (III). The speech was recorded in The Scots Magazine. The idea went that the Cat Stane was erected as a memorial for Constantine, at the location where the man lost his life in battle. The New Statistical Account went a bit further, suggesting that the stone marked the burial place of Constantine. Simpson strongly opposed this theory, finding it unlikely that such a monument would be erected for Constantine the Bald, a king who fell in a civil war, with no family legacy, and who was treated with contempt by primary sources. He examined other transcriptions of the texts, where the word &quot;Constan&quot; was absent, eventually dismissing the theory as based on a faulty reading of the original text.

== Reputation ==
The stanzas of The Prophecy of Berchán covering Constantine III give him a mostly negative assessment: &quot;&quot;A king will take [the sovereignty], who will not be king; after him, Scotland will be nothing. It will be the weak following the strong; though true is what my lips relate. A king with reproach above his head; alas for Scotland during his short time! Feeble men will be about him, in the region of Scone, of melodious shields. A year and a half (a bright space), that will be his whole reign; from taking Gaels (hostages?) he will go to death; he falls, his people fall. He will fight great battles in Scotland; by the disgrace of his head, he will destroy colours. He will be in communion of battle, from Stirling to Abertay. &quot;Anderson suggested that this would be the area from Stirling to Tentsmuir (Abertay Sands), the traditional Scottish boundary with &quot;Danish Northumbria&quot; (Jórvík)&quot;.

Berchán gave a negative portrayal of Kenneth II as well, calling him &quot;the Fratricide&quot;, who &quot;would bring danger on everyone&quot;. Kenneth II &quot;would attack his own people as well as his enemies&quot;, probably alluding to Kenneth killing members of the Scottish nobility, people who were related to him in various ways. Hudson suspects that further details on the killings of Kenneth II could be found in lost works, part of an early Scottish literal tradition, which left only fragments in later works. While Kenneth II is depicted as a strong king, Constantine III is dismissed as a failure. The length of his reign (18 months) confirms that Constantine is the failed &quot;non-king&quot; intended, a king surrounded by weak men. The poem places his death by the River Tay, though this is not necessarily a contradiction to other accounts of his death (which place it by river Almond). The Almond flows into the Tay in a location not far from Scone, also recorded as the place of death of a previous king, Domnall mac Ailpín (reigned 859–862).

The ominous verse which has Constantine fall with his people might allude to the end of his family, as his line probably died with him. The name Grim/Gryme for his successor Kenneth III probably derives from &quot;greimm&quot; (Middle Irish: authority). Berchán calls this man donn: as an adjective it means &quot;brown&quot;, but as a noun, the meaning changes to &quot;chief&quot; (prince, lord), depicting him as a stronger king.

== Legacy ==
Constantine is not known to have any descendants and he was the last of the line of Áed (Áed mac Cináeda) to have been king. With his death, the rivalry between descendants of Causantin and Áed gave way to a rivalry between two new royal lines, both descended from Causantin. One line descended from Kenneth II and was represented by his son Malcolm II. The other line descended from his brother Dub, King of Scotland (reigned 962–967) and was represented by Kenneth III.

<text>Michael David Watt (born December 20, 1957) is an American bassist, vocalist and songwriter. He co-founded and played bass guitar for the rock bands Minutemen (1980–1985), Dos (1985–present), and Firehose (1986–1994). He began a solo career with the 1995 album &quot;Ball-Hog or Tugboat?&quot; and has since released three additional solo albums, most recently in 2010 with &quot;Hyphenated-man&quot;. He is also the frontman for the supergroup Big Walnuts Yonder (2008–present), a member of the art rock group Banyan (1997–present) and is involved with several other musical projects. From 2003 until 2013, he was the bass guitarist for The Stooges.

Watt has been called &quot;one of the greatest bassists on the planet&quot;. &quot;CMJ New Music&quot; called Watt a &quot;seminal post-punk bass player&quot;. Readers of &quot;NME&quot; voted Mike Watt one of the &quot;40 Greatest Bassists of All Time&quot; and &quot;LA Weekly&quot; awarded him the number six spot in &quot;The 20 Best Bassists of All Time&quot;. In November 2008, Watt received the &quot;Bass Player Magazine&quot; lifetime achievement award, presented by Flea. The Red Hot Chili Peppers dedicated their best-selling album, 1991&#x27;s &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot;, to Watt.

==Biography==
===Early career===
Watt was born in Portsmouth, Virginia. His father was a machinist&#x27;s mate in the Navy and when he was young, Watt&#x27;s family moved to San Pedro, California, where he became good friends with D. Boon. Watt and Boon picked up bass and guitar, respectively. Watt was a fan of T. Rex and Blue Öyster Cult, while Boon&#x27;s exposure to rock music was limited to Creedence Clearwater Revival, another Watt favorite.

===The Minutemen===
In 1978, Watt and Boon formed a band called The Reactionaries with drummer George Hurley and vocalist Martin Tamburovich. The band later became Minutemen with another drummer named Frank Tonche, who only lasted two shows with the group; Hurley, who had been in the short-lived new wave group Hey Taxi! at the time Minutemen first formed, rejoined Watt and Boon. After signing with SST Records in 1980, Minutemen began touring constantly, releasing a number of albums along the way. Their music was based on the speed, brevity, and intensity of punk, but included elements of jazz, folk, and funk.

Born with Osgood–Schlatter disease, Watt had surgeries on both knees in the early 1980s which limited touring in 1981. Watt wrote all of the music for &quot;What Makes a Man Start Fires?&quot; as he was laid up after one of his knee surgeries, living with his mother at the time and needed to keep himself occupied.

In 1984, Watt met Black Flag bassist Kira Roessler during a Black Flag/Minutemen tour. They soon became romantically involved, and subsequently began collaborating on songs, including material on Minutemen&#x27;s final album &quot;3-Way Tie (For Last)&quot;. They also formed a two-bass duo, Dos, and have since recorded and released three records.

Minutemen ended tragically on December 22, 1985, when Boon was killed in an automobile crash at the age of 27 while driving to Arizona with his girlfriend. Their fifth full-length album, &quot;3-Way Tie (For Last)&quot;, had already been scheduled for release at the time of the accident. In the documentary film &quot;We Jam Econo&quot;, Watt mentioned that the last time he saw Boon, he had received lyrics for 10 songs from critic and songwriter Richard Meltzer for a planned collaboration with Minutemen. Minutemen were also planning to record a triple album with the working title &quot;3 Dudes, 6 Sides, 3 Studio, 3 Live&quot; as way to counteract bootleggers.

===Firehose===

After Boon&#x27;s death, Watt was profoundly depressed; he and Hurley initially intended to quit music altogether. Sonic Youth invited Watt to hang out with them in New York City in 1986; they recorded a cover of Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Burnin&#x27; Up&quot; (with additional guitars by Greg Ginn) on the first Ciccone Youth EP, and Watt played bass for two songs on the Sonic Youth album &quot;Evol&quot;. Watt cites this period as critical in inspiring his post-Minutemen career saying, &quot;The first thing I did was Thurston asked me to play bass on &quot;Evol&quot;. That was a big highlight, man. Like, &#x27;What, you want me to play without D. Boon?&#x27;&quot;

Subsequently, Ed Crawford, a Minutemen fan who drove to San Pedro from Ohio, persuaded the Watt/Hurley rhythm section to continue playing music. Firehose was formed soon after. Following three releases on SST, Firehose was signed to Columbia Records by A&amp;R man Jim Dunbar. Shortly after the release of 1993&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Machinery Operator&quot;, the band decided to call it quits.

Watt and Kira married in 1987, but their marriage ended not long after Firehose&#x27;s break-up. However, both their friendship and Dos have remained intact; they even recorded their third album, &quot;Justamente Tres&quot;, not long after their divorce.

===Solo career===
After working with Firehose, Watt began a solo career. His first album, &quot;Ball-Hog or Tugboat?&quot;, featured appearances from dozens of musicians (many were Watt&#x27;s peers from the 1980s SST era), including Henry Rollins, Eddie Vedder, J Mascis, Carla Bozulich, Evan Dando, members of Sonic Youth, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Frank Black, Nirvana, Soul Asylum, Jane&#x27;s Addiction, the Beastie Boys and the Screaming Trees. The album and its supporting tour were Watt&#x27;s first taste of mainstream fame, when Vedder and Dave Grohl of Nirvana were part of his touring group. After Vedder returned to his Pearl Jam commitments and Grohl began working with his new band Foo Fighters, Watt formed his only four-piece touring group to date, The Crew Of The Flying Saucer, featuring guitarist Nels Cline and two drummers.

In 1996, Watt contributed bass guitar on two songs for Porno for Pyros&#x27; second album, &quot;Good God&#x27;s Urge&quot;, filling in for Martyn LeNoble who quit the band during recording sessions. Watt subsequently ended up being the bassist for the band&#x27;s tour that followed the release of the album.

He made an appearance in an episode of Cartoon Network&#x27;s &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot;.

In 1997, Watt released &quot;Contemplating the Engine Room&quot;, a punk rock song cycle using naval life as an extended metaphor for both Watt&#x27;s family history (the album has a picture of his father in his Navy uniform on the cover) and the Minutemen. The album, which was critically well received, features the trio of musicians Nels Cline on guitar, Stephen Hodges on drums, and Watt as the only singer.

Watt went on to play in such groups as Banyan (with Stephen Perkins and Nels Cline) and Hellride, a sometime live outfit that plays cover versions of Stooges songs. He also played in Wylde Ratttz with Sonic Youth&#x27;s Thurston Moore and The Stooges&#x27; Ron Asheton, recording a song for the film &quot;Velvet Goldmine&quot;. Watt also recorded a bass line to send to the Pennsylvania space-folk band The Clubber Lang Gang for their record &quot;Now Here This&quot;, on the track &quot;For the Broken People&quot;. Starting in mid-2011, Watt began playing bass for a psychedelic/progressive rock band called Anywhere with the Mars Volta&#x27;s Cedric Bixler-Zavala and Christian Eric Beaulieu of Triclops! In 2015 Mike Watt joined the Waywords and Meansigns project, a collaborative project setting James Joyce&#x27;s Finnegans Wake to music.

===Illness, recovery and The Stooges===

In January 2000, Watt fell ill with an infection of his perineum, forcing him into emergency surgery and nine weeks of bedrest in his San Pedro apartment. Initially unable to play his bass, he rebuilt his strength with intense practice as well as live club gigs where he performed sets of Stooges covers with Hellride in California and with J Mascis and Dinosaur Jr. drummer Murph in New York City under the name Hellride East.

In 2000, Mascis asked Watt to participate in a world tour behind Mascis&#x27; first post-Dinosaur Jr. release, J Mascis and the Fog&#x27;s &quot;More Light&quot;. At several of the shows, Ron Asheton formerly of The Stooges joined Mascis and Watt onstage, wherein the group would play entire sets of Stooges songs. Watt and Mascis later joined Asheton and his brother, Stooges drummer Scott Asheton, for a one-time-only performance at a Belgian festival under the name Asheton, Asheton, Mascis &amp; Watt. In 2001, Watt was one of several bassists invited to participate in the sessions for Gov&#x27;t Mule&#x27;s &quot;The Deep End&quot;, partly on the recommendation of Primus&#x27; Les Claypool. Watt and Gov&#x27;t Mule recorded a cover version of Creedence Clearwater Revival&#x27;s &quot;Effigy&quot; for the album. The sessions were immortalized in the documentary feature film &quot;Rising Low&quot;.

In 2002, Watt, along with Pete Yorn and members of The Hives, backed Iggy Pop for a short set of Stooges songs at that year&#x27;s Shortlist Music Prize ceremony, after which Watt was asked to play bass in the reunited Stooges lineup in 2003. The reunited Stooges played their first show in almost 20 years at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in May 2003.

===&quot;The Secondman&#x27;s Middle Stand&quot;===
Watt&#x27;s third solo album &quot;The Secondman&#x27;s Middle Stand&quot;, inspired by both his 2000 illness and one of his favorite books, Dante&#x27;s &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot;, was released in 2004; one reviewer writes that the album is a &quot;harrowing, funny, and genuinely moving stuff from a true American original&quot;. For the first time since the Minutemen, Watt recorded the album with an &quot;all-Pedro band&quot;, Mike Watt and the Secondmen, consisting of organist Pete Mazich and drummer Jerry Trebotic, along with former that dog. vocalist Petra Haden.

While promoting and touring behind &quot;The Secondman&#x27;s Middle Stand&quot;, Watt announced plans for future recordings, stating that he intended to record as frequently as he did in the Minutemen days for as long as he could.

Watt would part amicably with Columbia/Sony BMG in 2005, after 14 years as both a solo artist and as one-third of Firehose.

===Unknown Instructors===

In 2005, another side project featuring Watt came to light with the announced September 20 release of &quot;The Way Things Work&quot;, an album of improvised music under the group name, Unknown Instructors with George Hurley, Saccharine Trust&#x27;s Joe Baiza and Jack Brewer, and poet/saxophonist Dan McGuire. A month after the album&#x27;s release, the Unknown Instructors recorded a second album, &quot;The Master&#x27;s Voice&quot;, with Pere Ubu frontman David Thomas and artist Raymond Pettibon joining the core quartet of Watt, Hurley, McGuire and Baiza. A third album with the same lineup, &quot;Funland&quot;, was released in 2009 and features a semi-cover version (the original lyrics over new music) of Captain Beefheart&#x27;s &quot;Frownland&quot; (from the &quot;Trout Mask Replica&quot; album). Basic tracks have already been laid down for the fourth Unknown Instructors album at Secondmen organist Pete Mazich&#x27;s Casa Hanzo studio in San Pedro.

Watt would further his interest in improvised music by forming a trio, Los Pumpkinheads, with former Beastie Boys keyboardist Money Mark and Caroline Bermudez.

On December 14, 2005, the McNally-Smith College of Music in Saint Paul, Minnesota announced the formation of the Mike Watt Bass Guitar Scholarship, which is to be awarded annually to a bass major starting in the Fall of 2006.

In March 2006, Watt took part in the performance at Disney Hall, Los Angeles, of Glenn Branca&#x27;s &quot;Hallucination City&quot; Symphony #13.

===&quot;The Weirdness&quot;===

In October 2006, Watt joined the rest of The Stooges at recording engineer Steve Albini&#x27;s Electrical Audio Studio in Chicago, Illinois to record &quot;The Weirdness&quot;, the first Stooges studio album since 1973&#x27;s &quot;Raw Power&quot;. The album was released on March 6, 2007, and much of Watt&#x27;s 2007 was devoted to Stooges duties, including the band&#x27;s first full-length U.S. tour since the band&#x27;s reformation.

Watt also worked on two other projects during this time period: Funanori, a musical collaboration with Kaori Tsuchida, guitarist of The Go! Team, on shamisen and other instruments, and Pelicanman (named after the closing track on &quot;The Secondman&#x27;s Middle Stand&quot;) with Petra Haden. The first three songs recorded by Watt and Tsuchida as Funanori were released on a split EP with Tokyo band LITE in the summer of 2007 by Transduction Records. Watt also contributed a cover of Blue Öyster Cult&#x27;s &quot;Burning For You&quot;, recorded with Haden, Nels Cline, Money Mark Nishita, and Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Chad Smith, to the all-star compilation album &quot;Guilt by Association&quot;, released in August by the independent label Engine Room Recordings.

On June 9, 2007, Watt was the live narrator for the silent movie &quot;Brand Upon the Brain!&quot; at the Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood, California.

===Big Walnuts Yonder===
Big Walnuts Yonder is an American supergroup formed in 2008 consisting of bassist/vocalist Watt, guitarist Nels Cline from Wilco, drummer Greg Saunier from Deerhoof, and guitarist/vocalist Nick Reinhart from Tera Melos. They released their debut album in March 2017 through Sargent House.

===Clenchedwrench label, Floored by Four, and Firehose reunion===

Watt reunited with the final Black Gang lineup of Nels Cline and Bob Lee to record a new album, tentatively titled &quot;My Shibun No Hi&quot;, in 2008. No release date has yet been set for the album.

Continuing his exploration of both improvised music and the Japanese independent music scene, Watt, along with Nels Cline and producer Kramer, formed Brother&#x27;s Sister&#x27;s Daughter with mi-gu members Shimizu &quot;Shimmy&quot; Hirotaka and Yuko Araki to do a two-week tour of the country in late 2008 and record an album afterward. The album was mixed down by Hirotake but has not lined up a label or release date yet. Since then, two more albums by the band have been recorded but have yet

Watt and Cline teamed up in New York to form Floored by Four with ex-Cibo Matto keyboardist Yuka Honda and Lounge Lizards drummer Dougie Bowne. The group debuted at Central Park Summerstage on August 1, and recorded their first self-titled album right afterward. The album was released in late September 2010 on Sean Lennon&#x27;s Chimera Music label. Honda would later rejoin Watt and Cline for a second Brother&#x27;s Sister&#x27;s Daughter tour and album session in Japan
 (Cline and Honda became romantically involved – and subsequently engaged to be married – during the course of these projects).

Watt is interviewed in the 2009 documentary film Live House, about the underground music scene in Japan.

Watt is using his clenchedwrench label to put out some other long-awaited recording projects from the stockpile he has accumulated over the past few years, starting with the fourth Dos album (&quot;Dos y Dos&quot;, released July 16, 2011), followed by the Spielgusher project with Richard Meltzer and mi-gu&#x27;s Shimizu &quot;Shimmy&quot; Hirotaka and Yuko Araki (&quot;Spielgusher&quot;, released January 17, 2012) and two Il Sogno del Marinaio albums. Watt chose to start clenchedwrench after returning from his Japanese &quot;Hyphenated-man&quot; tour because &quot;I&#x27;ve got so many proj[ect]s in the pipeline... and I want no hiccups with getting them out, so up goes my own freak flag flying.&quot;

Firehose&#x27;s reunion was formally announced as part of the lineup of the 2012 Coachella Festival. The band underwent a short tour in April centered around both Coachella dates.

===Il Sogno del Marinaio===
In late November 2009, Watt traveled to Italy to tour and record at the invitation of Italian guitarist Stefano Pilia. The project band, Il Sogno Del Marinaio,(the name is Italian for &quot;The Sailor&#x27;s Dream&quot;) did a short six-date tour, after which recording for an album (later entitled &quot;La Busta Gialla&quot;) took place.

The band is an experimental music trio consisting of Watt on vocals and bass guitar, Stefano Pilla on guitar and vocals, and Andrea Belfi on drums and vocals. The band has released two studio albums on clenchedwrench: &quot;La busta gialla&quot; (2013) and &quot;Canto Secondo&quot; (2014).

===&quot;Hyphenated-Man&quot;===
Watt recorded his first post-Columbia solo album, &quot;Hyphenated-man&quot;, in two sessions 13 months apart, with The Missingmen at Studio G, the New York studio of former Pere Ubu bassist Tony Maimone. &quot;Hypnenated-man&quot; consists of 30 short songs inspired by the paintings of Hieronymus Bosch. The first session for the album took place during a planned break in Watt&#x27;s Spring 2009 tour, during which, in a deliberate move, only the drum and guitar tracks were completed. Watt overdubbed his vocal and bass tracks with Maimone in June 2010. The album was released in Japan by Parabolic Records on October 6, 2010, and Watt undertook his first tour of the country as a solo artist in support of it (before his work with Brother&#x27;s Sister&#x27;s Daughter, he previously toured there as a sideman with J Mascis and as one-fifth of The Stooges). A release of the album for the rest of the world took place on Watt&#x27;s newly established clenchedwrench label on March 1, 2011, with an accompanying 51-date US/Canadian tour occurring between March 10 and April 30.

===CUZ===
In 2006, Watt met Sam Dook of The Go! Team at Big Day Out. The two continued emailing and decided to form a band. They recorded some sessions in 2008 while Watt was touring Europe and finished the album over email. The album, entitled &quot;Tamatebako&quot;, was released in 2014 under the band name CUZ and features guest vocals by Charles Plymell, DJ Scotch Egg, and fellow Go! Team member Kaori Tsuchida. The album title references the mysterious box of Japanese legend.
A tour in 2015 followed.

===The Hand to Man Band===
In 2010, Thollem McDonas, John Dieterich, Tim Barnes, and Watt formed an experimental improvisational supergroup. Their debut album, &quot;You Are Always On Our Minds&quot;, was released in 2012.

===The Island===
Watt and S. Howe of the band Schooner formed an experimental music project called The Island and released &quot;Listening to the Warning&quot; in 2011 and &quot;Lamia&quot; in 2018.

===Hidden Rifles===
In 2014, Watt joined with Mark Shippy (U.S. Maple), Jim Sykes (Invisible Things), Matthew Wascovich (Scarcity Of Tanks), and Norman Westberg (Swans) to form the art rock project band Hidden Rifles. Their debut album, &quot;Across The Neighborhoods&quot;, was released in October 2017.

===Afternoon Freak===
Along with keyboardist Matt Mottel and percussionist Danny Frankel, Watt formed the trio Afternoon Freak and released the album &quot;The Blind Strut&quot; in 2018. The album was recorded in one day on January 14, 2017, at BIG EGO studios.

===Tone Scientists===
In 2018, Watt joined with Bucky Pope, John Herndon, Vince Meghrouni, and Pete Mazich to form the project band Tone Scientists. A 7-inch consisting of a Bucky Pope original entitled &quot;Nuts&quot; and a cover of Sun Ra&#x27;s &quot;Tiny Pyramids&quot; was released on Record Store Day 2018 by Org Music.

===Jumpstarted Plowhards===

In 2019, Watt joined Todd Congelliere to form Jumpstarted Plowhards. Their debut album, &quot;Round One&quot;, was recorded for release on October 4, 2019, with Recess Records. Drums are handled by a rotating roster including former Minutemen and fIREHOSE bandmate George Hurley, Hole drummer Patty Schemel, The Secondmen&#x27;s Jerry Trebotic and The Missingmen&#x27;s Raul Morales.

The band plans to record five LPs before playing live.

===Fitted===
Initially formed as a one-off group for Wire&#x27;s Drill festival in Los Angeles, Watt, Graham Lewis (Wire), Matthew Simms (Wire), and Bob Lee (The Black Gang) formed Fitted and decided to stay together and record.

The debut album, &quot;First Fits&quot;, was released in November 2019.

===mssv===

Watt played bass with guitarist Mike Baggetta and drummer Jim Keltner for Baggetta&#x27;s &quot;Wall of Flowers&quot; album in March 2019. Watt joined Baggetta for a ten date March tour with Stephen Hodges substituting for Keltner.

The resulting trio named themselves mssv and recorded a live album entitled &quot;Live Flowers&quot;. A studio album entitled &quot;Main Steam Stop Valve&quot; followed in 2020.

===Three-Layer Cake===

In 2021, Watt with percussionist Mike Pride and guitarist Brandon Seabrook formed Three-Layer Cake and released an album, &quot;Stove Top&quot;, on RareNoiseRecords.

===Flipper===
Mike Watt was recruited by Flipper&#x27;s Ted Falconi and Stephen DePace to play bass for a 2019 summer European tour with David Yow (The Jesus Lizard, Scratch Acid) substituting for the retired Bruce Loose and the otherwise engaged then-current Flipper bassist, Rachel Theole. The shows were billed as Flipper with Yow and Watt.

In 2022, Flipper announced that they would tour again, with Watt returning on both bass and lead vocals. A European tour was announced, but cancelled due to COVID-19 concerns. The band then quickly booked an autumn US tour with the same lineup.

===Guest appearances===

In November 2006, Watt revealed to Pitchfork Media that he recorded for an album by singer Kelly Clarkson, a studio assignment that he took at the invitation of his &quot;old friend&quot;, producer/engineer David Kahne. Clarkson&#x27;s &quot;My December&quot; album was released in 2007.

Watt and drummer Stephen Hodges joined violinist Chris Murphy for &quot;Blues for Bukowski&quot; on his Murphy&#x27;s album &quot;Luminous&quot;. Hodges had previously worked with Watt on &quot;Contemplating the Engine Room&quot;.

Watt appeared on the track &quot;Moon Burnt Mountain&quot; on &quot;Anywhere II&quot; by Anywhere.

Watt played bass on two tracks for the Black Flag tribute album &quot;Gimmie Gimmie Gimmie: Reinterpreting Black Flag&quot; alongside Dez Cadena and Keith Morris.

In 2018, Black Moth Super Rainbow released a 7-inch for Record Store Day with Watt and Flea covering &quot;Drippy Eye&quot;. Watt had earlier appeared on the song &quot;Black Yogurt&quot; on Black Moth Super Rainbow&#x27;s &quot;Drippers&quot; EP in 2008. The same year Watt appeared on Macedonia&#x27;s Bernays Propaganda song &quot;Ništo Nema da ne Razdeli&quot; for the &quot;Songs From Under the Floorboard, Vol. 1&quot; compilation album put out by DJ Dave Cantrell. The album is a charitable compilation with proceeds going to Planned Parenthood.

Watt also appeared on a split 7-inch with MB Jones playing on the song &quot;Jail for Trees&quot; in April 2018.

In October 2018, Watt joined Abby Travis, Keith Morris, Flea, Jennifer Finch, Chip Kinman and others for a spoken word engagement at the Roxy Theatre entitled &quot;War Stories: Tales of 70&#x27;s &amp; 80&#x27;s Punk Mayhem Told By The Perpetrators Themselves&quot;.

In 2019, Watt appeared with Macedonian jazz guitarist Toni Kitanovski on the track &quot;Nisto nema da ne&#x27; razdeli&quot; for Bernays Propaganda&#x27;s 2019 release, &quot;Vtora mladost, treta svetska vojna&quot; (&quot;2nd Youth, 3rd World War&quot;) The track was also donated to &quot;Songs From Under the Floorboard, Vol. 1&quot;, proceeds of which go to Planned Parenthood.

Watt has said he generally charges no fee to play on somebody&#x27;s album saying &quot;All payment is not in the coin...Anytime you play, you&#x27;re investing in the next time you play.&quot;

===Literary endeavors===
In 2003, Watt&#x27;s first book, &quot;Spiels Of A Minuteman&quot;, was released by the Quebec book publisher L&#x27;Oie De Cravan. The book, printed in both English and French, contains all of Watt&#x27;s song lyrics from the Minutemen era as well as the tour journal he wrote during the Minutemen&#x27;s only European tour with Black Flag, essays by former SST co-owner Joe Carducci, Sonic Youth&#x27;s Thurston Moore, and Blue Öyster Cult lyricist and longtime Watt hero Richard Meltzer, and illustrations by Raymond Pettibon that had been used in all of the Minutemen&#x27;s album artwork.

Watt published his second book in 2012. Entitled &quot;Mike Watt: On and Off Bass&quot;, the book is a photo memoir featuring photos taken by Watt coupled with excerpts from Watt&#x27;s Stooges tour diaries mixed with free verse poems.

In 2016, Watt contributed a chapter to John Doe&#x27;s memoir &quot;Under The Big Black Sun: A Personal History of L.A. Punk&quot;.

===James Joyce===
Watt has long been a fan of James Joyce having first discovered &quot;Ulysses&quot; while playing with Minutemen on a European tour with Black Flag. He credits reading Joyce with helping him process the loss of D. Boon and he used it as inspiration when writing &quot;Contemplating the Engine Room&quot;.

Watt has said that Joyce&#x27;s stream-of-consciousness style directly influenced &quot;Double Nickels on the Dime&quot; with songs like &quot;June 16th&quot;, which is the date of Bloomsday. Watt attended the 2004 Bloomsday celebration in Dublin and claimed that it was the first time he went to a town without having to perform a gig. Watt attended Bloomsday again in 2008 while touring with The Stooges.

In 2008, Watt was invited to contribute music to an adaptation of Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Chamber Music&quot; released by Fire Records

In 2017, Watt participated in an international project setting Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; to music entitled &quot;Waywords and Meansigns&quot; It was released on May 4, 2017, to coincide with the 76th anniversary of the book&#x27;s first publication.

===&quot;The Watt from Pedro Show&quot;===
When he is not on tour, Watt hosts a regular internet radio show, &quot;The Watt from Pedro Show&quot;, a continuation of a program Watt had first done on a low-power FM station in the late 1990s. The program debuted on May 19, 2001, and became so popular with Watt&#x27;s fans that the website&#x27;s host, Sightworks, temporarily forced the show offline on weekdays until a sponsor or other solution could be found. On January 10, 2006, &quot;The Watt from Pedro Show&quot; became available as a podcast.

=== Porno for Pyros ===

Watt reconnected with Porno for Pyros in 2023 for a tour that was postponed while they finished a new single &quot;Little Me&quot;, and is currently on that rescheduled tour; 2024’s Horns, Thorns En Halos Farewell Tour, in support of that single and the back catalog.

==Equipment==
Watt&#x27;s first bass was a Kay he purchased for $100. He played a Fender Precision Bass formerly owned by Fear bassist Derf Scratch on &quot;What Makes A Man Start Fires?&quot;

For most of his fIREHOSE tenure, Watt played a 1956 Fender Precision Bass. From 1995 until 1999, Watt predominately played a non-reverse Gibson Thunderbird which he altered with a Bartolini pre-amp and Grover tuning machines.

Following his 2000 illness, Watt switched to short-scale basses for live work. Watt played a 1963 Gibson EB-3 until it was stolen while on tour with The Stooges. After the theft, Watt was gifted with a 1969 Gibson EB-3 and a Gibson EB-0.

More recently, Watt plays a signature &quot;Wattplower&quot; bass he designed with Reverend Musical Instruments. In early 2020, it was announced that a &quot;Mark II&quot; iteration of the bass would be released.

<text>Cuilén (also &quot;Culén, Cuilean&quot;, anglicised Colin; died 971) was an early King of Alba (Scotland). He was a son of Illulb mac Custantín, King of Alba, after whom he is known by the patronymic mac Illuilb (also &quot;mac Iduilb&quot;, &quot;mac Ilduilb&quot; etc.) of Clann Áeda meic Cináeda, a branch of the Alpínid dynasty.

During the 10th century, the Alpínids rotated the kingship of Alba between two main dynastic branches. Dub mac Maíl Choluim, a member of a rival branch of the kindred, seems to have succeeded after Indulf&#x27;s death in 962. Cuilén soon after challenged him but was defeated in 965. Dub was eventually expelled and slain in 966/967. Whether Cuilén was responsible for his death is uncertain.

Following Dub&#x27;s fall, Cuilén appears to have ruled as undisputed king from 966–971. Little is known of Cuilén&#x27;s short reign other than his own death in 971. According to various sources, he and his brother, Eochaid, were slain by Britons. Some sources identify Cuilén&#x27;s killer as Rhydderch ap Dyfnwal, a man whose daughter had been abducted and raped by the king. Rhydderch was evidently a man of eminent standing and seems to have been a son of Dyfnwal ab Owain, King of Strathclyde, and could have possibly ruled the Cumbrian Kingdom of Strathclyde at the time of Cuilén&#x27;s death.

After Cuilén&#x27;s assassination, the kingship of Alba may have been assumed by another member of Clann Áeda meic Cináeda, Cináed mac Maíl Choluim, a man who appears to have launched a retaliatory raid against the Cumbrians. There is evidence indicating that Cináed faced considerable opposition from Cuilén&#x27;s brother, Amlaíb, a man who was accorded the title King of Alba in Irish sources recording his death at Cináed&#x27;s hands in 977. Cuilén&#x27;s son, Custantín, eventually succeeded Cináed as king. There is evidence to suggest that Cuilén had another son, Máel Coluim.

== Name ==
Cuilén was one of three sons of Illulb mac Custantín, King of Alba (died 962). The two other sons were Eochaid (died 971) and Amlaíb (died 977). Illulb was, in turn, a son of Custantín mac Áeda, King of Alba (died 952), a man who possessed strong connections with the Scandinavian dynasty of Dublin. There is evidence to suggest that some of Custantín&#x27;s descendants bore Scandinavian names. For instance, Illulb&#x27;s name could be either a Gaelicised form of the Old English personal name &quot;Eadwulf&quot;, or a Gaelicised form of the Old Norse personal name &quot;Hildulfr&quot;. If the latter possibility is indeed correct, Illulb&#x27;s name could indicate that his mother was a member of a Scandinavian kindred. Likewise, Amlaíb&#x27;s name could represent a form of the Gaelic personal name &quot;Amalgaid&quot;, or else a Gaelicised form of an Old Norse personal name &quot;Óláfr&quot;. Therefore, Amlaíb&#x27;s name could indicate that his mother was a member of a Scandinavian kindred as well, and perhaps a descendant of Amlaíb Cúarán (died 980–981) or Amlaíb mac Gofraid (died 941).

Further evidence of Scandinavian influence on the contemporary Scottish court may be a possible epithet accorded to Cuilén by the ninth to twelfth century &quot;Chronicle of the Kings of Alba&quot;. In one instance, this source records Cuilén&#x27;s name as &quot;Culenri[n]g&quot;. Most likely this is just Cuilén Ríg – Ríg (modern Gaelic: rìgh) being the Gaelic word for &quot;king&quot;. Whilst it has also been suggested that this word represents the Old Norse &quot;hringr&quot;, meaning &quot;ring&quot; or &quot;ring-giver&quot;, the name instead may be corrupted from a scribal error, and the word itself might refer to something else.

== The Alpínid dynasty ==






Cuilén and his immediate family were members of the ruling Alpínid dynasty, the patrilineal descendants of Cináed mac Ailpín, King of the Picts (died 858). The root of this kindred&#x27;s early success laid in its ability to successfully rotate the royal succession amongst its members. For example, Illulb&#x27;s father – a member of the Clann Áeda meic Cináeda branch of the dynasty – succeeded Domnall mac Causantín (died 900) – a member of the Clann Custantín meic Cináeda branch – and following a reign of forty years resigned the kingship to this man&#x27;s son, Máel Coluim mac Domnaill (died 954). Cuilén&#x27;s father succeeded to the kingship following Máel Coluim&#x27;s demise, and ruled as king until his own death in 962. The record of Illulb&#x27;s fall at the hands of an invading Scandinavian host is the last time Irish and Scottish sources note Viking encroachment into the kingdom. The Scandinavian Kingdom of York had collapsed by the 950s, and the warbands of the kings of Dublin seem to have ceased their overseas adventures during this period as well. Unlike English monarchs who had to endure Viking depredations from the 980s to the 1010s, the kings of Alba were left in relative peace from about the time of Illulb&#x27;s fall. Free from such outside threats the Alpínids seem to have struggled amongst themselves.

== Contested kingship and kin-strife ==


There is some uncertainty regarding the succession after Illulb&#x27;s demise. On one hand, he may well have been succeeded by Máel Coluim&#x27;s son, Dub (died 966/967). Such a chronology is certainly evinced by the fourteenth century &quot;Chronica gentis Scotorum&quot; and various king lists. The twelfth-century &quot;Prophecy of Berchán&quot;, on the other hand, states that the kingship was temporarily shared by Dub and Cuilén. If correct, this source could indicate that neither man had been strong enough to displace the other in the immediate aftermath of Illulb&#x27;s passing. Although the Alpínid branches represented by Illulb and Dub seem to have maintained peace throughout Illulb&#x27;s reign, inter-dynastic conflict clearly erupted in the years that followed.

The &quot;Chronicle of the Kings of Alba&quot; may indicate that Dub spent much of his reign contending with Cuilén. Certainly, this source states that the two battled each other on &quot;Dorsum Crup&quot;, where Dúnchad, Abbot of Dunkeld (died 965), and Dubdon, &quot;satrap&quot; of Atholl (died 965) were slain. The battle seems to have taken place at Duncrub, possibly the same site as the first-century Battle of Mons Graupius. The conflict itself is attested by the fifteenth–sixteenth century &quot;Annals of Ulster&quot; in 965, in an entry recording Dúnchad&#x27;s fall in a clash between the men of Alba. Although the &quot;Chronicle of the Kings of Alba&quot; states that Dub attained the victory, the same source reports that he was later expelled from the kingdom. &quot;The Annals of Ulster&quot; reports Dub&#x27;s death in 967. According to the so-called &quot;X&quot; group of king lists, Dub was killed at Forres and his body was hidden under a bridge at Kinloss during a solar eclipse. The account of Dub&#x27;s death preserved by the fifteenth century &quot;Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland&quot;, and &quot;Chronica gentis Scotorum&quot; also associate the king&#x27;s fall with an eclipse. If these sources are to be believed, Dub would seem to have fallen before the solar eclipse of 20 July 966.

There is reason to suspect that the inscriptions displayed upon Sueno&#x27;s Stone, alongside the Kinloss road at Forres, commemorate the final defeat and death of Dub. One of the panels of this remarkable monument appears to show corpses and heads lying under an arch which may well represent a bridge. One of the heads is framed, which may be that of Dub himself. Although the stone does not appear to make reference to an eclipse, it is possible that such an event was inserted into the traditional account as a means to improve the tale. If so, the aforesaid date recorded by the &quot;Annals of Ulster&quot; may well be correct. The chronology of Dub&#x27;s death could be evidence that his downfall came after Cuilén&#x27;s consolidation of the kingship. Although it is conceivable that Dub was slain in favour of his successor, this may not necessarily have been the case – certainly Cuilén is not stated to have been responsible for his death – and it is possible that events transpired without Cuilén&#x27;s interference.

== Reign and death ==
Cuilén&#x27;s undisputed reign seems to have spanned from 966 to 971. As far as surviving sources record, Cuilén&#x27;s reign appears to have been relatively uneventful. His death in 971 is noted by several sources. According to the &quot;Chronicle of the Kings of Alba&quot;, Cuilén and his brother, Eochaid (died 971), were killed by Britons. The &quot;Annals of Ulster&quot; also reports that Cuilén fell in battle against Britons, whilst the twelfth century &quot;Chronicon Scotorum&quot; specifies that Britons killed him within a burning house. The &quot;Chronicle of the Kings of Alba&quot; locates Cuilén&#x27;s fall to &quot;&quot;Ybandonia&quot;. Although this might refer to Abington in South Lanarkshire, a more likely location may be preserved by the twelfth–thirteenth century &quot;Chronicle of Melrose&quot;. This source states that Cuilén was killed at &quot;Loinas&quot;&quot;, a placename which seems to refer to either Lothian or The Lennox, both plausible locations for an outbreak of hostilities between Scots and Britons. In fact, &quot;Ybandonia&quot; itself could well refer to Lothian, or the Lennox. The account of Cuilén&#x27;s demise preserved by &quot;The Prophecy of Berchán&quot; is somewhat different. According to this source, Cuilén met his end whilst &quot;seeking a foreign land&quot;, which could indicate that he was attempting to lift taxes from the Cumbrians. The &quot;Chronicle of the Kings of Alba&quot; reports that Cuilén&#x27;s killer was a certain Rhydderch ap Dyfnwal (fl. 971), a man who slew Cuilén for the sake of his own daughter. The thirteenth century &quot;Verse Chronicle&quot;, the &quot;Chronicle of Melrose&quot;, and &quot;Chronica gentis Scotorum&quot; likewise identify Cuilén&#x27;s killer as Rhydderch, the father of an abducted daughter raped by the king.

There is reason to suspect that Cuilén&#x27;s killer was a son of Dyfnwal ab Owain, King of Strathclyde (died 975). Although there is no specific evidence that Rhydderch was himself a king, the fact that Cuilén was involved with his daughter, coupled with the fact that his warband was evidently strong enough to overcome that of Cuilén, suggests that Rhydderch must have been a man of eminent standing. At about the time of Cuilén&#x27;s demise, a granddaughter of Dyfnwal could well have been in her teens or twenties, and it is possible that the recorded events refer to a visit by the King of Alba to the court of the King of Strathclyde. Such a visit may have taken place in the context of Cuilén exercising his lordship over the Britons. His dramatic death suggests that the Scots severely overstepped the bounds of hospitality, and could indicate that Rhydderch was compelled to fire his own hall. Certainly, such killings are not unknown in Icelandic and Irish sources. The Lothian placename of West Linton appears as &quot;Lyntun Ruderic&quot; in the twelfth century. The fact that the place name seems to refer to a man named Rhydderch could indicate that this was the place where Cuilén and Eochaid met their end. Another way in which Cuilén may have met his end concerns the record of his father&#x27;s earlier seizure of Edinburgh preserved by the &quot;Chronicle of the Kings of Alba&quot;. The fact that this conquest would have likely included at least part of Lothian, coupled with the evidence locating Cuilén&#x27;s demise to the same area, could indicate that Cuilén was slain in the midst of exercising overlordship of this contested territory. If so, the records that link Rhydderch with the regicide could reveal that this wronged father exploited Cuilén&#x27;s vulnerable position in the region and that Rhydderch seized the opportunity to avenge his daughter.

Although the &quot;Chronicle of the Kings of Alba&quot; reports that Dub&#x27;s brother, Cináed mac Maíl Choluim (died 995), was the next King of Alba, Irish sources – such as royal genealogies, the fourteenth century &quot;Annals of Tigernach&quot;, and the &quot;Annals of Ulster&quot; – appear to reveal that Amlaíb possessed the kingship before his death at Cináed&#x27;s hands. Whilst Cináed may well have initially succeeded to the kingship, it seems that Amlaíb was able to mount a successful – if only temporary – bid for the throne. Certainly, the aforesaid annal-entries style Amlaíb a king and accord Cináed a mere patronymic name. Amlaíb&#x27;s tenure is not attested by any Scottish king list, and it would appear that his reign was indeed brief, perhaps dating from 971–976, 977. One possibility is that the kingship had been shared between Amlaíb and Cináed until the former&#x27;s death.

This revolving succession within the Alpínid dynasty reveals that the inter-dynastic struggle between Cuilén and Dub was continued by their respective brothers. As for Cuilén&#x27;s other brother, Eochaid, this man&#x27;s death with Cuilén seems to be evidence of his prominent position within the kingdom. The fact that Amlaíb reigned after his brother&#x27;s death likewise appears to indicate that he too played an important part in Cuilén&#x27;s regime. One of Cináed&#x27;s first acts as king was evidently an invasion of the Kingdom of Strathclyde. This campaign could well have been a retaliatory response to Cuilén&#x27;s killing, carried out in the context of crushing a British affront to Scottish authority. In any event, Cináed&#x27;s invasion ended in defeat, a fact which coupled with Cuilén&#x27;s killing reveals that the Kingdom of Strathclyde was indeed a power to be reckoned with.

== Interment and offspring ==
Cuilén appears to have been buried at St Andrews, the site of his father&#x27;s burial. According to &quot;The Prophecy of Berchán&quot;, he was laid to rest &quot;above the edge of the wave&quot;, a location which seems to refer to St Andrews. In other sources, he is sometimes stated to have been buried on Iona. After an apparent two decade lull in the aforesaid Alpínid kin-strife, Cuilén&#x27;s son, Custantín (died 997), eventually became king after Cináed&#x27;s assassination in 995.

Custantín had no known male offspring. He was the last of Clann Áeda meic Cináeda to hold the kingship, or even appear on record. There is a possibility that Cuilén had another son, a certain Máel Coluim mac Cuiléin who appears in a note preserved in the ninth–twelfth century &quot;Book of Deer&quot; detailing donors to the monastery of Deer. Certainly, &quot;Cuilén&quot; was a relatively rare personal name. However, none of the names that precede his in the note can be linked to known historical personages, making such an identification questionable. Nevertheless, the names that are recorded immediately after this man are certainly identifiable with known royal figures: Máel Coluim mac Cináeda (died 1034), Máel Coluim mac Maíl Brigte (died 1029), and Máel Snechta mac Lulaig (died 1085). If Máel Coluim mac Cuiléin was indeed a son of Cuilén, this attestation could reveal that he represented Clann Áeda meic Cináeda for a time during Cináed&#x27;s reign (971–995).

== Clann Áeda meic Cináeda power centre ==
The rotating succession of the Alpínid dynasty was similar to that practiced in Ireland by the Cenél nEógain and Clann Cholmáin branches of the Uí Néill, a dominant Irish kindred that monopolised the kingship of Tara between the eighth and tenth centuries. This alternation amongst the Uí Néill was facilitated by the considerable distance between the two segments. The inability of either branch to dominate the other, and therefore cut off their rivals from key resources, enabled such a rotating scheme to succeed.

The similarities between the regulated Irish and Scottish successions suggest that the power centres of the two Alpínid branches were also separated. By the early eleventh century, after the final fall of Clann Áeda meic Cináeda, the opposing Clann Custantín meic Cináeda branch faced challenges to the kingship from the Moray-based Clann Ruaidrí. This could indicate that Clann Áeda meic Cináeda was similarly seated north of the Mounth in Moray, with the power base of Clann Custantín meic Cináeda situated in the south. That the latter kindred was hostile to the men of the north may be evidenced by the record of Máel Coluim mac Domnaill&#x27;s invasion of Moray preserved by the &quot;Chronicle of the Kings of Alba&quot;. Furthermore, both this dynast and his son, Dub, are stated by &quot;Chronica gentis Scotorum&quot; to have been killed by Moravians. In contrast to these records of conflict, there is no evidence of hostility between Clann Áeda meic Cináeda and the men of Moray.

On the other hand, the fact that king lists locate Dub&#x27;s demise to Forres might indicate that Clann Custantín meic Cináeda was instead based in the north. Moreover, the fact that &quot;The Prophecy of Berchán&quot; records that Custantín mac Áeda retired to St Andrews, a site where his descendants, Illulb and Cuilén, are also said to have been buried, coupled with the location of Cuilén&#x27;s death in the south against the Cumbrians, could reveal that Clann Áeda meic Cináeda was centred south of the Mounth. Such a location may also be evidenced by the aforesaid deaths of the Abbot of Dunkeld and the &quot;satrap&quot; of Atholl, men who seem to have fallen supporting the cause of Cuilén against Dub.

<doc id="148045" wikidata="Q1050516" url="?curid=148045" title="Firehose (band)">
<text>Firehose (stylized as fIREHOSE) was an American alternative rock band consisting of Mike Watt (bass, vocals), Ed Crawford (guitar, vocals), and George Hurley (drums). They were initially active from 1986 to 1994, and briefly reunited in 2012.

==History==
Firehose was formed in the spring of 1986 shortly after the accidental death of D. Boon brought an end to Watt and Hurley&#x27;s previous band, Minutemen. Crawford, a then 21-year-old Ohio State student and Minutemen fan, was invited up on the roof of Camper Van Beethoven&#x27;s van in Columbus, Ohio. The members of Camper Van Beethoven told Crawford a false rumor that Watt and Hurley were auditioning guitarists for the band. Crawford, having found Watt&#x27;s phone number in the phone book, called him up and expressed his desire to come out to California and play with them. Still mourning the loss of his best friend Boon, Watt initially was not interested and had lost much of his desire to play music; however, Crawford&#x27;s persistence eventually paid off when he showed up unannounced in San Pedro and asked Watt for the chance to come over and play for him. Watt eventually agreed and the two met with Crawford &quot;auditioning&quot; for Watt by playing him The Who&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m One,&quot; as well as a few Minutemen songs. Impressed with Crawford&#x27;s passion and enthusiasm, Watt and Hurley agreed to give the inexperienced &quot;kid&quot; from Ohio a shot and the band was formed. Crawford quickly relocated to San Pedro where he became known as ed fROMOHIO and spent nine months sleeping under a desk in Watt&#x27;s one-bedroom apartment. The name of the band was taken from a short film of Bob Dylan doing &quot;Subterranean Homesick Blues&quot; as Watt thought it was funny when Dylan held up a cue card for the lyric that said &quot;firehose&quot;. The name is stylized as &quot;fIREHOSE&quot; with a lowercase &quot;f&quot; as a subtle tribute to the Minutemen whose logo was an all caps MINUTEMEN.

The band played their first gig in June 1986 and by the end of the year released their debut album, &quot;Ragin&#x27;, Full On&quot; via the independent label, SST. That same year, they also supported Sonic Youth on their &quot;Flaming Telepaths Tour&quot;. The band quickly gained a loyal fanbase especially among the underground skateboarding crowd thanks in part to the inclusion of some of their early material in several key skateboarding videos from the late 1980s. &quot;Brave Captain&quot; from &quot;Ragin&#x27;, Full On&quot;, as well as &quot;Sometimes&quot;, &quot;Hear Me&quot;, and &quot;Windmilling&quot; from their sophomore release, &quot;If&#x27;n&quot; were all featured in the Santa Cruz Skateboards video series, &quot;Streets on Fire&quot;.

Over the course of seven and a half years, the band developed their own musical identity apart from Minutemen while still maintaining the same dynamic synthesis of punk, funk, and free jazz. They toured non-stop and consistently played to packed audiences. All in all, Firehose played 980 gigs, released five full-length albums and two EPs before disbanding in 1994. They played their final gig on February 12, 1994, at the Warner Grand Theatre in San Pedro, California.

In an interview with &quot;Billboard&quot; Watt declared &quot;Most bands tour to promote records. We make records to promote tours.&quot;

==After Firehose (1994–2012)==
Since disbanding, Mike Watt has released four solo albums and been involved in numerous musical projects including the longstanding bass duo, Dos (with ex-Black Flag bassist and wife, Kira Roessler), FITTED (with Graham Lewis of Wire), Banyan (with Jane&#x27;s Addiction drummer, Stephen Perkins), J Mascis + The Fog, The Stooges and Unknown Instructors (along with George Hurley). He also hosts &quot;The Watt from Pedro Show&quot; on Internet radio. Mike Watt, a San Pedro, Los Angeles, California resident since 1967, still resides there.

George Hurley has been involved in several musical projects and bands as well including Vida (with ex-Black Flag member, Dez Cadena), Red Krayola and Tripod (both with Tom Watson) and the Unknown Instructors. Like Watt, George Hurley also resides in San Pedro, Los Angeles, California.

Ed Crawford has also been involved in a handful of musical projects including fronting the North Carolina trio, Grand National (not to be confused with the UK band) and playing guitar and touring with the now defunct alt-country band, Whiskeytown. He currently resides in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and fronts the alt/rock trio, FOOD.

==Reunion==
It was announced in early 2012 that the band would be reuniting for their first live shows in over eighteen years. A compilation album chronicling their major label albums entitled &quot;lowFLOWS: The Columbia Anthology (&#x27;91–&#x27;93)&quot; was released to coincide with the reunion. The new album features &quot;Flyin&#x27; the Flannel&quot;, &quot;Live Totem Pole&quot; EP, &quot;Mr. Machinery Operator&quot;, as well as bonus material, including live cuts and instrumentals.

On January 4, 2012, &quot;Verbicide&quot; posted an article detailing that according to a reader&#x27;s tip, an announcement was made at Harlow&#x27;s in Sacramento, CA on December 29, 2011, that Firehose would be performing at the venue on April 5, 2012. Shortly after, Firehose were also confirmed as part of the line-up for the 2012 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. in Indio, CA. A small West Coast tour christened &quot;Smokin&#x27; on the Ol&#x27; Pink Pole&quot; kicked off on April 5, 2012, at Harlow&#x27;s and included 14 dates, among them two at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.

When asked whether Firehose was planning to make a new album, Mike Watt replied, &quot;When Edward was asking me about doing new gigs, he also said he wanted to write... he has a band called Food, and said he&#x27;s been writing songs. For these two weeks of gigs, we&#x27;re just going to try and play some of the old ones. But he was talking about writing songs. So, I don&#x27;t know – maybe down the road.&quot;

<text>Ildulb mac Causantín, anglicised as Indulf or Indulph, nicknamed An Ionsaighthigh, &quot;the Aggressor&quot; (died 962) was king of Alba from 954 to 962. He was the son of Constantine II; his mother may have been a daughter of Earl Eadulf I of Bernicia, who was an exile in Scotland.

== Biography ==
Indulf was probably baptised in 927. According to William of Malmesbury, Æthelstan stood godfather to a son of Constantine at the Church of Dacre. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle dates the meeting of Æthelstan with the northern kings at Eamont to the 12 July 927. So, it is likely that this baptism occurred on, or around, the Feast of St Hildulf, which Alex Woolf suggests may be the source of his uncommon name.

John of Fordun and others supposed that Indulf had been king of Strathclyde in the reign of his predecessor, based on their understanding that the kingdom of Strathclyde had become a part of the kingdom of Alba in the 940s. This, however, is no longer accepted.

The Chronicle of the Kings of Alba says: &quot;In his time &quot;oppidum Eden&quot;&quot;, usually identified as Edinburgh, &quot;was evacuated, and abandoned to the Scots until the present day.&quot; This has been read as indicating that Lothian, or some large part of it, fell to Indulf at this time. However, the conquest of Lothian is likely to have been a process rather than a single event, and the frontier between the lands of the kings of Alba and Bernicia may have lain south and east of Edinburgh many years before Indulf&#x27;s reign.

Indulf&#x27;s death is reported by the Chronicon Scotorum in 962, the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba adding that he was killed fighting Vikings near Cullen, at the Battle of Bauds. The Prophecy of Berchán, however, claims that he died &quot;in the house of the same holy apostle, where his father [died]&quot;, that is at the céli dé monastery of St Andrews. He was buried on Iona.

Indulf was succeeded by Dub (Dub mac Maíl Coluim), son of his predecessor. His sons Cuilén and Amlaíb were later kings. Eochaid, a third son, was killed with Cuilén by the men of Strathclyde in 971.

<text>A fire hose (or firehose) is a high-pressure hose that carries water or other fire retardant (such as foam) to a fire to extinguish it. Outdoors, it attaches either to a fire engine, fire hydrant, or a portable fire pump. Indoors, it can permanently attach to a building&#x27;s standpipe or plumbing system.

The usual working pressure of a firehose can vary between while per the NFPA 1961 Fire Hose Standard, its bursting pressure is in excess of 110 bar. (11,000kPa; 1600psi)
Hose is one of the basic, essential pieces of fire-fighting equipment. It is necessary to convey water either from an open water supply, or pressurized water supply. Hoses are divided into two categories, based on their use: suction hose, and delivery hose.

After use, a fire hose is usually hung to dry, because standing water that remains in a hose for a long time can deteriorate the material and render it unreliable or unusable. Therefore, the typical fire station often has a high structure to accommodate the length of a hose for such preventive maintenance, known as a hose tower.

On occasions, fire hoses have been used for crowd control (see also water cannon), including by Bull Connor in the Birmingham campaign against protesters during the Civil Rights Movement in 1963.

==History==

Until the mid-19th century, most fires were fought by water transported to the scene in buckets. Original hand pumpers discharged their water through a small pipe or monitor attached to the top of the pump tub. It was not until the late 1860s that hoses became widely available to convey water more easily from the hand pumps, and later steam pumpers, to the fire.

In Amsterdam in the Dutch Republic, the Superintendent of the Fire Brigade, Jan van der Heyden, and his son Nicholaas took firefighting to its next step with the fashioning of the first fire hose in 1673. These lengths of leather were sewn together like a boot leg. Even with the limitations of pressure, the attachment of the hose to the gooseneck nozzle allowed closer approaches and more accurate water application. Van der Heyden was also credited with an early version of a suction hose using wire to keep it rigid. In the United States, the fire hose was introduced in Philadelphia in 1794. This canvas hose proved insufficiently durable, and sewn leather hose was then used. The sewn leather hose tended to burst, so a hose fabricated of leather fastened together with copper rivets and washers was invented by members of Philadelphia&#x27;s Humane Hose Company.

Around 1890, unlined fire hoses made of circular woven linen yarns began to replace leather hoses. They were certainly much lighter. As the hose fibers, made of flax, became wet, they swelled up and tightened the weave, causing the hose to become watertight. Unlined hoses, because of their lack of durability, were rapidly replaced with rubber hoses in municipal fire service use. They continued to be used on interior hose lines and hose rack until the 1960s to 1980s. In January 1981, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration revised their standards such that unlined hoses were to no longer be installed for interior hose lines.

Following the invention of the vulcanization process as a means of curing raw soft rubber into a harder, more useful product, the fire service slowly made the transition from bulky and unreliable leather hose to the unlined linen hose, then to a multi-layer, rubber lined and coated hose with interior fabric reinforcement. This rubber hose was as bulky, heavy, and stiff as a leather hose, but was not prone to leaking. It also proved more durable than unlined linen hose. Its wrapped construction resembled some hoses used today by industry, for example, fuel delivery hoses used to service airliners.

==Modern usage==
Modern fire hoses use a variety of natural and synthetic fabrics and elastomers in their construction. These materials allow the hoses to be stored wet without rotting and to resist the damaging effects of exposure to sunlight and chemicals. Modern hoses are lighter weight than older designs, which has reduced the physical strain on firefighters. Various devices are becoming more prevalent to remove air from the interior of fire hose, commonly referred to as fire hose vacuums. This makes hoses smaller and somewhat rigid, allowing more hose to be packed into the same compartment on a fire-fighting apparatus.

Suction Hose

Suction hose is laid down on the suction side of pump (inlet) where the water passing through it is at a pressure either below or above that of the atmosphere. It is designed to resist internal and external pressure. It should have sufficient strength to withstand the pressure of external air when a vacuum has formed inside. It should also be strong enough to resist hydrant pressure. Usually an appliance has to carry about 10 m of suction hose in either 3 m or 2.5 m length. The diameter of the hose depends on the capacity of the pump, and three standard sizes such as 75mm, 100mm, and 140mm are generally used.
Partially Embedded suction hose

Partially Embedded suction hose is usually made of a tough rubber lining embedded fully as a spiral, with tempered, galvanized steel wire. This embedding is arranged so that it provides a full waterway and a relatively smooth internal surface. The wall of the hose is prepared from several layers of canvas and rubber lining so that turns of each one lie midway between turns of the other. The complete wall is consolidated by vulcanizing.

Fully embedded (smooth bore) suction hose
Fully embedded (smooth bore) suction hose has a thick, internal rubber lining embedded fully with a spiral of wire. Suction hose should be constructed to withstand a pressure of 10.5 bar.

Delivery Hose
Delivery hose is laid down from the delivery side of the pump (outlet), and the water passing through it is always at a pressure greater than that of the atmosphere. Delivery hose is divided into two categories: percolating hose, and non-percolating hose.

Percolating hose 
Percolating hose is used mainly to fight forest fires. The seepage of water through the hose protects the hose against damage by glowing embers falling onto it or the hose being laid on hot ground.

Non-percolating hose 
In fire services, non-percolating hoses are generally used for delivering water. Non-percolating hose consists of a reinforced jacket made from polyester or nylon yarns. This type of hose has an inner lining of vulcanized rubber fixed to the jacket by an adhesive. The use of non-percolating hose is recommended in certain applications, as friction losses will be much less than that of percolating hoses. 
Lined hose are divided into 3 types:

Type 1: Lined hose without external jacket treatment:
Such hose absorbs liquid into reinforcement jacket and requires drying after use.

Type 2: Coated lined hose:
This has a thin, elastic outer coating that reduces liquid absorption into the jacket and may slightly improve abrasion resistance.

Type 3: Covered lined hose:
Covered lined hose has a thicker elastic cover that prevents liquid absorption but also adds substantial improvements to abrasion and heat resistance.

===Types===
There are several types of hose designed specifically for the fire service. Those designed to operate under positive pressure are called discharge hoses; they include: attack hose, supply hose, relay hose, forestry hose, and booster hose. Those designed to operate under negative pressure are called suction hoses.

Another suction hose, called a soft-suction hose, is actually a short length of fabric-covered, flexible discharge hose used to connect the fire pumper suction inlet with a pressurized hydrant. It is not a true suction hose, since it cannot withstand negative pressure.

===Raw materials===
In the past, cotton was the most common fiber used in fire hoses, but most modern hoses use synthetic fiber like polyester or nylon filament. The synthetic fibers provide additional strength and better resistance to abrasion. The fiber yarns may be dyed various colors, or may be left natural.

Coatings and liners use synthetic rubbers, which provide varying degrees of resistance to chemicals, temperature, ozone, ultraviolet (UV) radiation, mold, mildew, and abrasion. Different coatings and liners are chosen for specific applications.

==Manufacturing process==
Fire hose is usually manufactured in a plant that specializes in providing hose products to municipal, industrial, and forestry fire departments. Here is a typical sequence of operations used to manufacture a double jacket, rubber-lined fire hose.

;Preparing the yarn
* There are two different fiber yarns that are woven together to form a hose jacket. The yarns that run lengthwise down the hose are called warp yarns and are usually made from spun polyester or filament nylon. They form the inner and outer surfaces of the jacket and provide abrasion resistance for the hose. The yarns that are wound in a tight spiral around the circumference of the hose are called the filler yarns and are made from filament polyester. They are trapped between the crisscrossing warp yarns and provide strength to resist the internal water pressure. The spun polyester warp yarns are specially prepared by a yarn manufacturer and are shipped to the hose plant. No further preparation is needed.
* The continuous filament polyester fibers are gathered together in a bundle of 7-15 fibers and are twisted on a twister frame to form filler yarns. The plied and twisted yarn is then wound onto a spool called a filler bobbin.

;Weaving the jackets
* The warp yarns are staged on a creel, which will feed them lengthwise down through a circular loom. Two filler bobbins with the filler yarn are put in place in the loom.
* As the loom starts, the filler bobbins wind the filler yarn in a circle through the warp yarns. As soon as the bobbins pass, the loom crisscrosses each pair of adjacent warp yarns to trap the filler yarn between them. This weaving process continues at a high speed as the lower end of the jacket is slowly drawn down through the loom, and the bobbins continue to wrap the filler yarns around the circumference of the jacket in a tight spiral. The woven jacket is wound flat on a take-up reel.
* The inner and outer jackets are woven separately. The inner jacket is woven to a slightly smaller diameter so that it will fit inside the outer jacket. Depending on the expected demand, several thousand feet of jacket may be woven at one time. After an inspection, the two jackets are placed in storage.
* If the outer jacket is to be coated, it is drawn through a dip tank filled with the coating material and then passed through an oven where the coating is dried and cured.

;Extruding the liner
* Blocks of softened, sticky, uncured rubber are fed into an extruder. The extruder warms the rubber and presses it out through an opening between an inner and outer solid circular piece to form a tubular liner.
* The rubber liner is then heated in an oven where it undergoes a chemical reaction called vulcanizing, or curing. This makes the rubber strong and pliable.
* The cured liner passes through a machine called a rubber calender, which forms a thin sheet of uncured rubber and wraps it around the outside of the liner.

;Forming the hose
* The jackets and liner are cut to the desired length. The inner jacket is inserted into the outer jacket, followed by the liner.
* A steam connection is attached to each end of the assembled hose, and pressurized steam is injected into the hose. This makes the liner swell against the inner jacket and causes the thin sheet of uncured rubber to vulcanize and bond the liner to the inner jacket.
* The metal end connections, or couplings, are attached to the hose. The outer portion of each coupling is slipped over the outer jacket and an inner ring is inserted into the rubber liner. A tool called an expansion mandrel is placed inside the hose and expands the ring. This squeezes the jackets and liner between the ring and serrations on the outer portion of the coupling to form a seal all the way around the hose.

;Pressure testing the hose
* Standards set by the National Fire Protection Association require that each length of new double jacket, rubber-lined attack hose must be pressure tested to , but most manufacturers test to . Subsequent to delivery, the hose is tested annually to by the fire department. While the hose is under pressure, it is inspected for leaks and to determine that the couplings are firmly attached.
* After testing the hose is drained, dried, rolled, and shipped to the customer.

;Quality control
In addition to the final pressure testing, each hose is subjected to a variety of inspections and tests at each stage of manufacture. Some of these inspections and tests include visual inspections, ozone resistance tests, accelerated aging tests, adhesion tests of the bond between the liner and inner jacket, determination of the amount of hose twist under pressure, dimensional checks, and many more.

===Future===
The trend in fire hose construction over the last 20 years has been to use lighter, stronger, lower maintenance materials.

This trend is expected to continue in the future as new materials and manufacturing methods evolve. One result of this trend has been the introduction of lightweight supply hoses in diameters never possible before. Hoses up to in diameter with pressure ratings up to are now available. These hoses are expected to find applications in large-scale industrial firefighting, as well as in disaster relief efforts and military operations.

Fire hoses come in a variety of diameters. Lightweight, single-jacket construction, , 1, and  inch diameter hose lines are commonly used in wildfire suppression applications. Heavy duty double, double-jacket, , , 2, , and on occasion 3-inch lines are used for structural applications. Supply lines, used to supply firefighting apparatus with water, are frequently found in , 4, , 5 and 6-inch diameters.

There are several systems available for repairing holes in fire hoses, the most common being the Stenor Merlin, which offer patching materials for Type 1, 2, and 3 hoses. The patches come in two different sizes and two different colours (red and yellow). The patches are vulcanised onto the hose and usually last the lifetime of the hose.

==Connections==

Hose connections are often made from brass, though hardened aluminum connections are also specified. In countries which use quick-action couplers for attack hoses, forged aluminum has been used for decades because the weight penalty of brass for Storz couplers is higher than for threaded connections.

Threaded hose couplings are used in the United States and Canada. Each of these countries uses a different kind of threading. Many other countries have standardized on quick-action couplings, which do not have a male and female end, but connect either way. Again, there is no international standard: In Central Europe, the Storz connector is used by several countries. Belgium and France use the Guillemin connector. Spain, Sweden and Norway each have their own quick coupling. Countries of the former Soviet Union area use the Gost coupling. Baarle-Nassau and Baarle-Hertog, two municipalities on the Belgian-Dutch border, share a common international fire department. The fire trucks have been equipped with adapters to allow them to work with both Storz and Guillemin connectors.

In the United States, a growing number of departments use Storz couplers for large-diameter supply hose, or other quick-action couplings. Because the usage is not standardized, mutual aid apparatus might have a compartment on their trucks dedicated to a multitude of hose adapters.

The different styles of hose couplings have influenced fireground tactics. Apparatus in the United States features &quot;preconnects&quot;: Hose for a certain task is put into an open compartment, and each attack hose is connected to the pump. Time-consuming multiple connections or problems with male and female ends are avoided by such tactics. In countries where Storz (or similar) connectors have been used for attack hoses for generations, firefighters drop a manifold at the border of the danger zone, which is connected to the apparatus by a single supply line. As a result, the tiny item &quot;hose coupler&quot; has also influenced the looks and design of fire apparatus.

==Forces on fire hoses and nozzles==
Fire hoses must sustain high tensile forces during operation. These arise from both pressure and flow. The magnitude of the axial tension in a fire hose is

: formula_1

where p is pressure in the hose relative to the ambient pressure, is the hose cross-sectional area, &quot;ρ&quot; is the water density, and Q is the volumetric flow rate. This tension is the same regardless of the bend angle of the hose.

When a nozzle is connected to a hose and water is ejected, the nozzle must be restrained by an anchor such as the hands of a firefighter. This anchor must apply a force in the direction of the spray, which is called the nozzle reaction. The magnitude of the nozzle reaction is the jet momentum flow rate,

formula_2

where is the cross-sectional area of the nozzle.

<doc id="148049" wikidata="Q378081" url="?curid=148049" title="Donald II of Scotland">
<text>Domnall mac Causantín (Modern Gaelic: , IPA:[ˈt̪oːvnəɫ̪ˈmaʰkˈxoːʃɪm]), anglicised as Donald II (died 900), was King of the Picts or King of Alba in the late 9th century. He was the son of Constantine I (Causantín mac Cináeda). Donald is given the epithet Dásachtach, &quot;the Madman&quot;, by &quot;The Prophecy of Berchán&quot;.

Donald usurped the throne from his cousin, Giric in 889 who killed his uncle Àed Mac Cináeda(r. 877–879). He continuously fought the Vikings in The North, winning victories but would be killed in 900 at War, possibly against King Harald Fairhair. He was succeeded by his cousin Caustantín Mac Àeda (Constantine II)

== Life ==
Donald became king on the death or deposition of Giric (Giric mac Dúngail), the date of which is not certainly known but usually placed in 889. The &quot;Chronicle of the Kings of Alba&quot; reports:
It has been suggested that the attack on Dunnottar, rather than being a small raid by a handful of pirates, may be associated with the ravaging of Scotland attributed to Harald Fairhair in the &quot;Heimskringla&quot;. The Prophecy of Berchán places Donald&#x27;s death at Dunnottar, but appears to attribute it to Gaels rather than Norsemen; other sources report he died at Forres. Donald&#x27;s death is dated to 900 by the Annals of Ulster and the Chronicon Scotorum, where he is called &quot;king of Alba&quot;, rather than &quot;king of the Picts&quot;. He was buried on Iona. Like his father, Constantine, he died a violent death at a premature age.

The change from &quot;king of the Picts&quot; to &quot;king of Alba&quot; is seen as indicating a step towards the kingdom of the Scots, but historians, while divided as to when this change should be placed, do not generally attribute it to Donald in view of his epithet. The consensus view is that the key changes occurred in the reign of Constantine II (Causantín mac Áeda), but the reign of Giric has also been proposed.

The Chronicle of the Kings of Alba has Donald succeeded by his cousin Constantine II. Donald&#x27;s son Malcolm (Máel Coluim mac Domnall) was later king as Malcolm I. The Prophecy of Berchán appears to suggest that another king reigned for a short while between Donald II and Constantine II, saying &quot;half a day will he take sovereignty&quot;. Possible confirmation of this exists in the Chronicon Scotorum, where the death of &quot;Ead, king of the Picts&quot; in a battle against the Uí Ímair is reported in 904. This, however, is thought to be an error, referring perhaps to Ædwulf, the ruler of Bernicia, whose death is reported in 913 by the other Irish annals.

<doc id="148050" wikidata="Q448307" url="?curid=148050" title="Eochaid ab Rhun">
<text>Eochaid ab Rhun (fl. 878–889) was a ninth century King of Strathclyde, who may have also been King of the Picts. He was a son of Rhun ab Arthgal, King of Strathclyde, and descended from a long line of British kings. Eochaid&#x27;s mother is recorded to have been a daughter of Cináed mac Ailpín, King of the Picts. This maternal descent from the royal Alpínid dynasty may well account for the record of Eochaid reigning over the Pictish realm after the death of Cináed&#x27;s son, Áed, in 878. According to various sources, Áed was slain by Giric, whose ancestry is uncertain and who then proceeded to usurp the Alban throne.

Heir to the Brythonic kingdom of Strathclyde and a claimant to the Gaelic throne of the Picts, Eochaid was of mixed blood. Indeed, the name &quot;Eochaid&quot; is Gaelic and may indicate his maternal descent from the Alpínid dynasty. It is uncertain if Eochaid and Giric were relatives, unrelated allies, or even rivals. Whilst it is possible that they held the Pictish kingship concurrently as allies, it is also conceivable that they ruled successively as opponents. Another possibility is that, whilst Giric reigned as King of the Picts, Eochaid reigned as King of Strathclyde. Eochaid&#x27;s floruit dates about the time when the Kingdom of Strathclyde seems to have expanded southwards into lands formerly possessed by the Kingdom of Northumbria. The catalyst for this extension of British influence appears to have been the Viking conquest of this northern English realm.

According to various sources, Eochaid and Giric were driven from the kingship in 889. The succeeding king, Domnall mac Custantín, was an Alpínid, and could well have been responsible for the forced regime change. The terminology employed by various sources suggests that during the reigns of Eochaid and Giric, or during that of Domnall and his successors, the wavering Pictish kingdom — weakened by political upheaval and Viking invasions — redefined itself as a Gaelic realm: the Kingdom of Alba.

Eochaid is not attested after 889. Likewise, nothing is recorded of the Kingdom of Strathclyde until the first quarter of the next century, when a certain Dyfnwal, King of Strathclyde is reported to have died. Whilst the parentage of this man is unknown, it is probable that he was a member of Eochaid&#x27;s kindred, and possibly a descendant of him. A daughter of Eochaid may have been Lann, a woman recorded to have been the mother of Muirchertach mac Néill, King of Ailech.

== Ancestors ==





Eochaid was a son of Rhun ab Arthgal, King of Strathclyde. Rhun&#x27;s patrilineal ancestry is evidenced by a pedigree preserved within a collection of tenth century Welsh genealogical material known as the &quot;Harleian genealogies&quot;. According to this source, he was descended from a long line of kings of Al Clud. The ninth to twelfth century &quot;Chronicle of the Kings of Alba&quot; evinces that Rhun was married to a daughter of Cináed mac Ailpín, King of the Picts, and states that a product of the union was Eochaid himself. Eochaid&#x27;s maternal ancestry may be exemplified in the name he bore. There is no known British form of the Gaelic . In theory, a Pictish form of the name would be * or *.

In 870, during the reign of Rhun&#x27;s father, Arthgal ap Dyfnwal, King of Al Clud, the fortress of Al Clud was captured and destroyed by the insular Scandinavian kings Amlaíb and Ímar. In the following year, Amlaíb and Ímar returned to Ireland with a fleet of two hundred ships, and a mass of captives identified as English, British, and Pictish. Arthgal died in 872. The &quot;Annals of Ulster&quot; and &quot;Chronicon Scotorum&quot; reveal that he was slain at the behest of Rhun&#x27;s brother-in-law, Custantín mac Cináeda, King of the Picts. The circumstances surrounding Arthgal&#x27;s assassination are unknown, and Rhun&#x27;s reign probably commenced not long after his death.

Prior to its fall, the fortress of Al Clud served as the capital of Arthgal&#x27;s Kingdom of Al Clud, and afterwards the capital appears to have relocated up the River Clyde to the vicinity of Govan and Partick. The relocation is partly exemplified by a shift in royal terminology. Until the fall of Al Clud, for example, the rulers of the realm were styled after the fortress; whereas following the loss of the site, the Kingdom of Al Clud came to be known as the Kingdom of Strathclyde in consequence to its reorientation towards Ystrad Clud (Strathclyde), the valley of the River Clyde. Either Arthgal or Rhun could have been the first monarch to rule the reconstructed realm of Strathclyde.

It is uncertain when Rhun&#x27;s reign and life ended. One possibility is that Rhun died in 876 when Custantín seems to have been slain by Vikings. Custantín&#x27;s death is dated to 876 by the &quot;Annals of Ulster&quot;. The &quot;Chronicle of the Kings of Alba&quot; appears to locate his fall in Atholl, whilst several king-lists locate his demise to a place variously called , an otherwise uncertain location that might refer to Inverdovat in Fife.

== Sources of the royal succession ==
It is uncertain who assumed the kingship of Strathclyde after Rhun. If Rhun and Custantín both died in 876, Eochaid could well have succeeded his father. Certainly, Custantín&#x27;s brother, Áed mac Cináeda, succeeded as King of the Picts and ruled as such upon his death two years later. Whilst the &quot;Annals of Ulster&quot; reports that Áed was killed by his own companions, several mediaeval king-lists state that he was slain by a certain Giric. Quite who reigned as king after Áed is uncertain, although there are several plausible possibilities.

According to the &quot;Chronicle of the Kings of Alba&quot;, Eochaid succeeded Áed and held the kingship for eleven years. The chronicle adds that it was further said that Giric also reigned during this period because he was Eochaid&#x27;s (&quot;foster father&quot;, &quot;guardian&quot;) and (&quot;guardian&quot;, &quot;governor&quot;, or &quot;king-maker&quot;). A solar eclipse is also noted during their reigns—an event dated to the feast of St Ciricius—and the two are stated to have been ejected from the kingdom.

The chronicle reports that Áed Findliath mac Néill died in the second year of Eochaid&#x27;s reign. Since Áed indeed expired in 879, the chronicle&#x27;s chronology is evidently accurate for the outset of Eochaid&#x27;s reign. As for the eclipse, the chronicle appears to place it in the context of the final year of Eochaid&#x27;s kingship. Nevertheless, it is clear that the eclipse is identical to that which took place on 16 June 885, as 16 June is certainly the feast day of at least one saint named Ciricius. Since the dates given by the chronicle and the &quot;Annals of Ulster&quot; show that there was an eleven-year gap between the previous reign and the next, it is evident that the eclipse indeed occurred in the midst of Eochaid&#x27;s reign. The chronicle&#x27;s inconsistency in regard to the eclipse may owe itself to an attempt to increase the dramatic effect of the regime change by associating a remarkable astronomical event with Eochaid&#x27;s expulsion.

Other than the chronicle, the only source to associate both Eochaid and Giric as kings is the twelfth century &quot;The Prophecy of Berchán&quot;. According to the latter, Eochaid ruled as king for thirteen years until he was expelled and succeeded by Giric (described as &quot;the son of fortune&quot;). The discrepancies between the two sources may partly stem from an ethnic bias. Certainly, &quot;The Prophecy of Berchán&quot; is critical of Eochaid&#x27;s British heritage whilst Giric is celebrated as a Scot.

== Relationship with Giric ==
Giric&#x27;s familial origins are uncertain. According to several versions of the &quot;Chronicle of the Kings of Alba&quot; his father&#x27;s name was , whereas certain versions of the &quot;Verse Chronicle&quot; equate his father&#x27;s name to . Although it is possible that Giric&#x27;s association with kingship stems from an ancestral claim, the evidence for this is uncertain. Giric need not have possessed any claim of his own, and could have merely played the role of kingmaker, by orchestrating the removal of Áed, and installing Eochaid in his place.

Nevertheless, there is also reason to suspect that Giric&#x27;s patronym, &quot;son of Dúngal&quot;, may actually refer to an early form of the Welsh rather than the Gaelic . If correct, Giric&#x27;s patronym could be evidence that his father was Dyfnwal ap Rhydderch, King of Al Clud and that Giric was a brother of Arthgal. Such a relationship could indicate that Giric&#x27;s apparent killing of Áed was undertaken in the context of avenging Arthgal&#x27;s demise at Custantín&#x27;s behest. If Giric and Eochaid were indeed both descendants of Dyfnwal, Eochaid could well have ruled as king under the tutelage of Giric, his granduncle.

Giric&#x27;s patronym may instead identify him as a son of Domnall mac Ailpín. If such a parentage is correct, it would certainly mean that Giric possessed a strong claim to the Pictish throne. The fact that Áed seems to have succeeded Custantín could indicate that Giric had been denied the kingship. Such a possibility could account for Giric&#x27;s apparent killing of Áed. It could also reveal that Giric received or was reliant upon significant assistance from Eochaid — in this case his maternal kinsman — which would in turn account for the evidence that Giric and Eochaid shared the Pictish kingship in some manner.

Conversely, it could have been Eochaid who claimed the kingship by right of his maternal Alpínid ancestry. If this was indeed the case, one possibility is that Eochaid was only able to hold authority in conjunction with Giric — either as an ally or client, or perhaps as a youthful ward under Giric&#x27;s guardianship. In the ninth century, the term was used to describe the relationship between a powerful ruler and a satellite. One such example is the establishment of Bran mac Fáeláin as King of Leinster by Niall Caille mac Áeda, King of Tara. As such, the terminology employed by the &quot;Chronicle of the Kings of Alba&quot; could reveal that Giric — as — similarly established Eochaid as king.

It is conceivable that Eochaid ruled over both the Strathclyde Britons and Picts. If so, he could have initiated his royal career as King of Strathclyde before succeeding as King of the Picts. In fact, the evidence of shared kingship may merely mean that Eochaid ruled the British kingdom whilst Giric ruled the Pictish realm. As such, it is possible that Giric was successful in imposing some form of authority over the Kingdom of Strathclyde during Eochaid&#x27;s floruit. If correct, the price for Eochaid&#x27;s assistance may have been the preservation of the British realm from other descendants of Cináed. The fact that Eochaid&#x27;s grandfather died in 872 could indicate that, if his father died soon after, Eochaid may have succeeded to the kingship of Strathclyde as a youth.

The remarkable uncertainty surrounding the Pictish kingship during this period means that it is also possible that Eochaid and Giric were rivals rather than allies. An adversarial relationship between the two may well be evidenced by &quot;The Prophecy of Berchán&quot; which gives a negative account of the Britons during Giric&#x27;s tenure.

== Expansion of the British realm ==
It is not until the turn of the tenth century before sources cast light upon the history of the Kingdom of Strathclyde. At some point after the loss of Al Clud, the Kingdom of Strathclyde appears to have undergone a period of expansion. Although the precise chronology is uncertain, by 927 the southern frontier appears to have reached the River Eamont, close to Penrith. The catalyst for this southern extension may have been the dramatic decline of the Kingdom of Northumbria at the hands of conquering Scandinavians, and the expansion may have been facilitated by cooperation between the Cumbrians and insular Scandinavians in the late ninth- and early tenth centuries. Amiable relations between these powers may be evidenced by the remarkable collection of contemporary Scandinavian-influenced sculpture at Govan. There is reason to suspect that Eochaid reigned during this expansion of the Kingdom of Strathclyde. The Pictish and British realms are certainly not recorded to have been assailed by Vikings during Eochaid&#x27;s floruit. Furthermore, a union of the Pictish and British kingdoms could well have allowed him to extend British authority southward.

== Transformation of the Pictish realm ==
As for the Scottish kingdom, the succeeding king is identified as Domnall mac Custantín by the &quot;Chronicle of the Kings of Alba&quot;. Domnall&#x27;s kingship is corroborated by the &quot;Annals of Ulster&quot; and &quot;Chronicon Scotorum&quot; which report his death in 900. The fact the &quot;Chronicle of the Kings of Alba&quot; accords Domnall an eleven-year reign places the inception of his rule in 889 and therefore corroborates the eleven-year reign accorded to Eochaid. Domnall is the first monarch to be styled King of Alba by a contemporary annalistic source. Prior to about this period, the Gaelic stood for &quot;Britain&quot;. In fact, the shifting terminology employed by various English, Irish, and Scottish sources may be evidence that the Pictish realm underwent a radical transformation during this period in history.

For example, the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; identifies the Irish as up until the 890s. By the 920s, this term came to be accorded to the people formerly regarded as Pictish (and last recorded as such in the 870s). As for the Irish annals—specifically the hypothesised &quot;Chronicle of Ireland&quot;—the terms and (&quot;king of the Picts&quot;) are last accorded to the Picts and their kings in the 870s. In fact, the last Pictish king to be styled thus was Domnall&#x27;s uncle, Áed. By the 900s, the terms (&quot;men of Alba&quot;) and (&quot;king of Alba&quot;) are utlilised for these people. The &quot;Chronicle of the Kings of Alba&quot; last utilises the term in the midst of Domnall&#x27;s reign. Thereafter, the realm is called .

There is reason to suspect that the political and dynastic upheaval endured by the Pictish realm in the last quarter of the ninth century was the catalyst for a radically new political order based upon the reestablishment of the Alpínids in the kingship. Alternately, the transformation could have taken place specifically during the floruit of Giric and Eochaid. For instance, it is conceivable that Giric gained the throne by seizing upon the upheaval caused by the incessant Viking depredations that assailed Pictavia. At an earlier date, the Gaelic realm of Dál Riata appears to have crumbled under such pressures, and it is possible that Giric drew military power from this broken polity to forcefully seize the Pictish throne. In any case, the accommodation of significant Gaelic aristocratic power in the wavering Pictish realm could account for the eventual transformation of Pictavia into Alba.

The temporary exclusion of the Alpínids from the Pictish throne could well have meant that they endured exile in Ireland. Certainly, Domnall&#x27;s paternal aunt, Máel Muire ingen Cináeda, possessed significant Irish connections as the wife of two successive kings of Tara—Áed Findliath and Flann Sinna mac Maíl Shechnaill—and the mother of another—Niall Glúndub mac Áeda. If Domnall and his succeeding first cousin, Custantín mac Áeda, indeed spent their youth in Ireland prior to assuming the kingship of Alba, their Gaelic upbringing could well have ensured the continuation of Pictavia&#x27;s Gaelicisation. If the eventual Alpínid successors of Eochaid and Giric were indeed sheltered in Ireland, this could account for the fact that the &quot;Chronicle of Ireland&quot; fails to acknowledge their usurpation.

Furthermore, if the Pictish transformation indeed stems from the floruit of Giric and Eochaid, the new terminology could indicate that the Kingdom of Alba was envisioned to include Pictish, Gaelic, British, and English inhabitants. Several king-lists allege that Giric subjugated Ireland and England during his reign, an outlandish claim that could instead evince a multi-ethnic northern alliance under his authority. As such, there is reason to suspect that — a term previously used for Britain — may have been meant to encapsulate a new political construction, a polity of &quot;North Britain&quot;.

== Legacy ==
Although the apparent reigns of Eochaid and Giric are obscure and uncertain, Giric eventually came to remembered as a legendary figure, credited as the liberator of the Gaelic Church from the Picts, and the architect of military conquests of Ireland and England. Eochaid, on the other hand, is only attested by the &quot;Chronicle of the Kings of Alba&quot; and &quot;The Prophecy of Berchán&quot;. Unlike Giric, later mediaeval king-lists and chronicles fail to include Eochaid within their accounts of Scottish history. In fact, Eochaid, and the later Alpínid Amlaíb mac Illuilb, King of Alba, are the only Scottish kings not noted by the king-lists. The window within which Eochaid and Giric appear to have reigned marks the only point between the careers of Cináed and Máel Coluim mac Cináeda, King of Alba that a patrilineal Alpínid is not known to have ruled the Pictish/Alban realm.

Eochaid is unattested after his apparent expulsion in 889, and the date of his death is unrecorded and unknown. According to various king-lists, Giric was slain at Dundurn. Evidence of extensive burning at the site may relate to this event, and may mark the end of the fort&#x27;s use. If the accounts of Giric&#x27;s downfall are to be believed, and if both he and Eochaid were allied together at the time, it is conceivable that both Eochaid and Giric fell together. Alternately, Giric&#x27;s killing could have contributed to Eochaid&#x27;s ejection from the kingship. Although it is unknown who was responsible for Giric&#x27;s reported demise, one candidate is the succeeding Domnall. Alternately, Domnall&#x27;s path to throne could have been paved by magnates who afterwards sent for him.

Certainly, nothing is recorded concerning the kingship of Strathclyde until the turn of the tenth century, when the &quot;Chronicle of the Kings of Alba&quot; notes the passing of a certain Dyfnwal, King of Strathclyde. Dyfnwal&#x27;s parentage is uncertain. On one hand, he could have been another son of Rhun. On the other hand, he could have been descended from Eochaid: either as a son or grandson. Alternately, Dyfnwal could have represented a more distant branch of the same dynasty. Eochaid may have also had a daughter, Lann, the wife of Niall Glúndub attested by the &quot;Great Book of Lecan&quot; version of the twelfth century &quot;Banshenchas&quot;. As such, if the &quot;Banshenchas&quot; is to be believed, a maternal grandson of Eochaid was Lann&#x27;s son, Muirchertach mac Néill.

<text>Elizabeth Clark Phair (born April 17, 1967) is an American rock singer-songwriter and musician. Born in New Haven, Connecticut, Phair was raised primarily in the Chicago area. After graduating from Oberlin College in 1990, she attempted to start a musical career in San Francisco, but returned to her home in Chicago, where she began self-releasing audio cassettes under the name Girly-Sound. The tapes led to a recording contract with the independent record label Matador Records.

Phair&#x27;s 1993 debut studio album, &quot;Exile in Guyville&quot;, was released to acclaim; it has been ranked by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; as one of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. Phair followed this with her second album, &quot;Whip-Smart&quot; (1994), which earned her a Grammy Award nomination for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance, and &quot;Whitechocolatespaceegg&quot; (1998). Ten years after the release of her debut, Phair&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Liz Phair&quot; (2003), released on Capitol Records, moved towards pop rock, earning her a mainstream audience but alienating critics; the single &quot;Why Can&#x27;t I?&quot; peaked at number 32 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

After the release of her fifth album, &quot;Somebody&#x27;s Miracle&quot; (2005), Phair left Capitol and released her sixth album &quot;Funstyle&quot; independently in 2010. In 2018, it was announced that Matador Records would be releasing a retrospective set for Phair&#x27;s debut album &quot;Exile in Guyville&quot;, which includes remastered recordings from her original Girly Sound demo tapes. Phair released her seventh studio album, &quot;Soberish&quot;, in 2021. As of 2011, Phair had sold over three million records worldwide.

==Early life==
Phair was born in New Haven, Connecticut, on April 17, 1967. She was adopted at birth by Nancy, a historian and museologist, and John Phair, later an AIDS researcher and head of infectious diseases at Northwestern Memorial Hospital; her mother later worked as a professor at the Art Institute of Chicago. She has one older brother, also adopted. On being adopted, Phair has said: &quot;My parents were very responsible ... They were perfect about it ... I&#x27;ve never tried to find [my biological] parents. My friend who was adopted from the same home requested information and got back a four-page letter about her mother&#x27;s life. She said it was jaw-dropping.&quot; Phair was raised as a Christian.

Phair spent her early life in Cincinnati until age nine, when her family relocated to the Chicago suburb of Winnetka, Illinois. She graduated from New Trier High School in 1985. During high school, Phair was involved in student government, yearbook, and the cross country team, and took AP Studio Art her senior year, among other advanced-level classes. She attended Oberlin College in Oberlin, Ohio, where she graduated in 1990 with a B.A. in art history.

==Career==
===1990–1992: Girly Sound tapes===
Phair&#x27;s entry into the music industry began when she met guitarist Chris Brokaw, a member of the band Come. Brokaw was dating one of Phair&#x27;s friends, and stayed at their loft in SoMa one weekend. After living in San Francisco for a year, Phair went broke and returned to Illinois, moving back in to her family&#x27;s home. There, she began writing lyrics and playing guitar, recording songs on a four-track tape recorder in her bedroom. She used the name Girly Sound on these recordings. She became part of the alternative music scene in Chicago and became friends with Material Issue and Urge Overkill, two of Chicago&#x27;s upstart bands to go national in the early 1990s, as well as Brad Wood and John Henderson, head of Feel Good All Over, an independent label in Chicago.

===1992–2003: &quot;Exile in Guyville&quot;; critical recognition===
After asking Wood who the &quot;coolest&quot; indie label was, Phair called up Gerard Cosloy, co-president of Matador Records, in 1992 and she asked him if he would put out her record. Coincidentally, Cosloy had just read a review of Girly Sound in &quot;Chemical Imbalance&quot; that very day and told Phair to send him a tape. Phair sent him a tape of six Girly Sound songs. Cosloy recalls: &quot;The songs were amazing. It was a fairly primitive recording, especially compared to the resulting album. The songs were really smart, really funny, and really harrowing, sometimes all at the same time. ... I liked it a lot and played it for everybody else. We usually don&#x27;t sign people we haven&#x27;t met, or heard other records by, or seen as performers. But I had a hunch, and I called her back and said O.K.&quot;

Cosloy offered a $3,000 advance, and Phair began working on a single, which turned into the 18 songs of &quot;Exile in Guyville&quot;.

&quot;Exile in Guyville&quot; was produced by Phair and Brad Wood, and released in 1993. The album received uniformly excellent reviews. The album received significant critical acclaim for its blunt, honest lyrics and for the music itself, a hybrid of indie rock and lo-fi, and established Phair&#x27;s penchant for exploring sexually explicit lyrics. By contrast, her trademark low, vibrato-less monotone voice gave many of her songs a slightly detached, almost deadpan character.

The release of Phair&#x27;s second album received substantial media attention and an advertising blitz. &quot;Whip-Smart&quot; debuted at #27 in 1994 and &quot;Supernova,&quot; the first single, became a Top 10 modern rock hit, and the video was frequently featured on MTV. Phair also landed the cover of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; with the headline &quot;A Rock Star Is Born.&quot; The album received positive reviews, although not as acclaimed as the debut, but was certified Gold (shipments of at least 500,000 units). It ultimately did not sell as well as expected, as it was hoped the album would introduce Phair to a wider, more mainstream audience. Following &quot;Whip-Smart&quot;, Phair released &quot;Juvenilia&quot;, a collection of some early Girly Sound tracks and several B-sides, including her cover of the 1980 song by The Vapors, &quot;Turning Japanese.&quot;

In 1994, Phair made several live television and radio appearances in an effort to promote &quot;Exile in Guyville&quot; and &quot;Whip-Smart&quot;; she appeared on &quot;Late Show With David Letterman&quot; performing &quot;Never Said&quot; and &quot;Supernova&quot;, and on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; performing an acoustic version of &quot;Whip-Smart&quot;. She also performed &quot;Alice Springs&quot; live on &quot;Good Morning America&quot;.

She also appeared on the MTV alternative rock show &quot;120 Minutes&quot; performing &quot;Never Said&quot;, &quot;6&#x27;1&quot;, &quot;Cinco de Mayo&quot; and &quot;Supernova&quot; live at various times during 1994 and early 1995.

Phair&#x27;s third album, &quot;Whitechocolatespaceegg&quot;, was released in 1998 after some delays, which included a disagreement about content; at one point, Matador rejected the album as submitted, and asked Phair to write a few additional radio-friendly songs for the set. The album displayed a more mature Phair, and reflected some of the ways marriage and motherhood affected her. While the single &quot;Polyester Bride&quot; received some airplay, and the album received many positive reviews, it was no more successful commercially than her previous records. To promote the record, Phair joined Lilith Fair. Phair performed on the main stage along with acts like Sarah McLachlan, Emmylou Harris, Sheryl Crow and Missy Elliott. She also opened for Alanis Morissette on her 1999 Junkie Tour. 
Phair portrayed the role of office manager Brynn Allen opposite Robin Tunney in the 2002 film &quot;Cherish&quot;.

===2003–2007: &quot;Liz Phair&quot; and &quot;Somebody&#x27;s Miracle&quot;===
Phair provided backing vocals on the 2003 Sheryl Crow single &quot;Soak Up the Sun&quot;. In 2003, Phair released her self-titled fourth album on her new label, Capitol Records. It departed from Phair&#x27;s earlier lo-fi sound for more polished pop production and songwriting. Phair said she wanted to earn more money from her work, and hired the Matrix, who had produced songs by pop acts including Avril Lavigne, to create some songs, including the singles &quot;Extraordinary&quot; and &quot;Why Can&#x27;t I?&quot; &quot;Liz Phair&quot; debuted at #27 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. &quot;Why Can&#x27;t I?&quot; entered the Adult Top 40 and Hot Adult Contemporary charts, and its music video placed Phair in heavy rotation on VH1 for the first time. It received mixed reviews, including negative reviews from the &quot;New York Times&quot; and &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, who accused Phair of selling out and mimicking younger artists. In 2019, the &quot;Pitchfork&quot; critic Matt LeMay apologized for his review, saying he had failed to appreciate Phair&#x27;s willingness to &quot;try on different masks&quot;.

&quot;Somebody&#x27;s Miracle&quot;, Phair&#x27;s fifth album and final with Capitol Records, was released in 2005. It returned to a rock sound. The album received mixed reviews, with Amy Phillips of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; writing: &quot;Now this is a terrible Liz Phair record. &quot;Somebody&#x27;s Miracle&quot; is mostly generic pap that any number of next-big-has-beens could have cranked out, a useless piece of plastic poking a pointy heel in the eye of the carcass of the artist Liz once was.&quot; Phillips also suggested it was worse than her largely critically derided previous album. A review published by MSNBC found the album &quot;less blatantly commercial [than her previous], but still smooth, reflecting her increasing shift toward a clearer sound&quot;.

In 2006, she performed one her songs at the end of an episode of TV series Charmed (season 8, episode 8).

===2008–2009: Television composing===
Phair signed with Dave Matthews&#x27; label ATO Records in early 2008 and re-released &quot;Exile in Guyville&quot; on June 24, 2008, on CD, vinyl, and in digital format, featuring three songs from the original recording sessions, &quot;Ant in Alaska,&quot; &quot;Say You,&quot; and an untitled instrumental, and also a documentary DVD, &quot;Guyville Redux.&quot; &quot;

In May 2009, Phair released a new song, &quot;Faith and Tenderness,&quot; sold exclusively at Banana Republic on a compilation disc featuring other artists. Also in 2009, Phair began working as a television composer, following an invitation by her childhood friend Mike Kelley to score the show he was creating for CBS, &quot;Swingtown&quot;, given it was based on the life in their hometown. For the task, Phair decided to bring in Doc Dauer, producer of a children&#x27;s album about bodily functions, &quot;The Body Rocks&quot;, where Phair performed after being brought in by Pete Yorn, and Dauer&#x27;s creative partner Evan Frankfort. She followed it by creating the theme song for NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Weber Show&quot;, and working for the CW&#x27;s &quot;The 100&quot;, the USA Network show &quot;In Plain Sight&quot; and the CW reboot of &quot;90210&quot;, for which she won the 2009 ASCAP award for Top Television Composer.

Liz Phair also guest starred on Charmed season 8 episode 8

===2010–2015: &quot;Funstyle&quot;===
On July 3, 2010, Phair&#x27;s official website announced a surprise link to download her new album &quot;Funstyle&quot;, which she released independently after parting ways with Capitol Records and ATO. The song &quot;Bollywood&quot; was available to stream from the site for a limited time, before Phair took it down.

A note from Phair to her fans posted on her official website explained why the songs were problematic:

Phair revealed in an interview with the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; that the falling out with her record label, ATO, occurred after a change in management. She explained, &quot;The people who were still there didn&#x27;t like, or didn&#x27;t know what to do with, the music I was making, so we just stalled out and I asked to leave.&quot;

Phair went on tour to promote the album, playing many songs from &quot;Guyville&quot; and &quot;Whip-Smart&quot;, along with songs from the rest of her repertoire. The Funstyle Tour ran from October 2010 to March 2011. The tour&#x27;s last show took place at the SXSW festival in Austin, Texas.

In 2012, she co-wrote and performed the song &quot;Dotted Line&quot; with A. R. Rahman for the film &quot;People Like Us&quot;. &quot;The song &#x27;Dotted Line&#x27; I wrote with A. R. Rahman for Alex Kurtzman&#x27;s film &#x27;Welcome To People&#x27;,&quot; she said in an interview. &quot;Both amazing. &#x27;Welcome To People&#x27; is a truly powerful film. Very proud of being part of it.&quot;

The dystopian holiday song &quot;Ho Ho Ho&quot; was released by Phair in late 2014. In 2014, Capitol released a greatest hits compilation of Phair&#x27;s work entitled &quot;Icon&quot;.

===2016–Present: Guyville retrospective, Soberish and recent tours===
In spring of 2016, Phair performed as the opening act for The Smashing Pumpkins on their &quot;In Plainsong&quot; tour.

In late 2015 and mid-2016, Phair stated on her Twitter that she intended to release two albums by the end of 2016. It was confirmed via Twitter that Phair was working on a double album, produced by fellow singer-songwriter Ryan Adams in his PAX-AM recording studio. Phair&#x27;s project with Adams did not proceed. When multiple women publicly disclosed accusations of abuse against Adams in 2019, a Twitter user asked Phair for a comment about Adams, to which she replied, &quot;My experience was nowhere near as personally involving, but yes the record ended and the similarities are upsetting.&quot;

In 2018, it was announced that Phair&#x27;s former label, Matador, would be releasing a 25th-anniversary retrospective set for her debut album, &quot;Exile in Guyville&quot;. The set, titled &quot;Girly Sound to Guyville&quot;, included remasters of Phair&#x27;s 1991 demo tapes recorded under the moniker Girly Sound from the original sources, and was released May 4, 2018. In support of this retrospective, Phair embarked on two North American tours — the &quot;Girly Sound to Guyville Tour&quot; and the &quot;Amps on the Lawn Tour&quot;. Phair continued to tour through the summer of 2019.

In April 2019, Phair announced on Instagram that she had been working on new studio material with Brad Wood, who produced &quot;Exile in Guyville&quot;, &quot;Whip-Smart&quot;, and parts of &quot;whitechocolatespaceegg&quot;. On October 8, 2019, Phair shared &quot;Good Side,&quot; a song from these sessions. Her seventh album, &quot;Soberish&quot;, with Wood as producer, was later announced for release in 2021.

In April 2020, the release of a cover version of &quot;Hanging on the Telephone&quot; by Phair with former friend and collaborator Jim Ellison of Material Issue was announced. Recorded before Ellison&#x27;s death in 1996, the song, originally released by The Nerves in 1976 and also covered by Blondie, was to be released along with a documentary entitled &quot;Out of Time: The Material Issue Story&quot;. Phair and Ellison previously teamed in the 1990s on covers of &quot;Turning Japanese&quot; and &quot;The Tra La La Song (One Banana, Two Banana)&quot;.

In February 2021, Phair announced she had signed a contract with newly re-formed Chrysalis Records to issue her album &quot;Soberish&quot; later in the year. The album was released that June, produced by Brad Wood. It garnered some of Phair&#x27;s strongest reviews since &quot;Guyville&quot;. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; called the album &quot;a solid, sharply written record of sturdy, enjoyable songs that gradually unfold to reveal new depths of feeling.&quot; In &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Jon Dolan wrote that &quot;Soberish&quot; &quot;brings to mind the glory of &quot;Guyville&quot; and its 1994 follow-up, &quot;Whip-Smart&quot;, without feeling at all like self-conscious recapitulation.&quot; A review by El Hunt in the NME stated that &quot;&quot;Soberish&quot; serves as a reminder of Liz Phair&#x27;s brilliance after years of underestimation. Far from simply drawing on her most critically acclaimed albums, it draws on the whole lot, and finds newness within.&quot;

Phair was due to tour later in 2021 as part of Alanis Morissette&#x27;s rescheduled 2020 tour, but canceled for undisclosed reasons. She did end up touring in the fall of 2023 for the 30th anniversary of &quot;Exile in Guyville&quot;, where she would perform the album in its entirety alongside several other fan favorites.

In August 2024, Phair officially announced a publishing deal with Warner Chappell Music.

==Personal life==
In 1994, Phair began dating film editor Jim Staskauskas. The couple married on March 11, 1995; their son James Nicholas Staskauskas was born on December 21, 1996.

In 2001, Phair and Staskauskas divorced, after which Phair sold her home in Chicago&#x27;s Lincoln Park neighborhood and relocated to Los Angeles, California. As of 2018, Phair resides in Manhattan Beach, California.

She identifies as a feminist, and &quot;Exile in Guyville&quot; has been said to capture &quot;the voice of third-wave feminism.&quot;

==Books==
An April 2018 profile by &quot;Billboard&quot; revealed that Phair had signed a two-book publishing deal with Random House. &quot;Horror Stories,&quot; the first of two planned memoirs, saw release on October 8, 2019. Reviews of &quot;Horror Stories&quot; were generally favorable with several reviewers noting Phair&#x27;s skills as a writer and her stark honesty in the book.

Her second memoir will be called &quot;Fairy Tales.&quot;

<doc id="148052" wikidata="Q323323" url="?curid=148052" title="Sid Sackson">
<text>Sid Sackson (February 4, 1920 in Chicago – November 6, 2002) was an American board game designer and collector, best known as the creator of the business game &quot;Acquire&quot;.

==Career==
Sackson&#x27;s most popular creation is probably the business game &quot;Acquire&quot;. Other games he designed include &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop&quot; and &quot;Focus&quot; (&quot;Domination&quot;), which won the prestigious German Spiel des Jahres game design award in 1981.

Other notable works include his books, especially &quot;A Gamut of Games&quot; and &quot;Card Games Around the World&quot;; both titles include a large array of rules for games both new and old, and Sackson himself invented a number of the games covered by these works.

For several years in the mid-1970s, Sid Sackson wrote a monthly column for &quot;Strategy &amp; Tactics&quot; magazine called “Sackson on Games” in which he reviewed games (other than wargames).

Sackson&#x27;s book collection was arranged in groups of five books so he would know if a book was missing and which one it was.

Sackson collected games throughout his life; at the time of his death, his collection was estimated at over 18,000 titles. Many of those were unique, sent to him by hopeful game developers who wanted Sackson&#x27;s advice. At one point in his life, Sackson turned down an offer to bring his collection elsewhere for permanent safekeeping; the games were sold at a series of auctions after his death, breaking up the collection. Sackson&#x27;s personal papers are stored at The Strong in Rochester, New York.

==Honors==

Sackson was inducted into the Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts &amp; Design&#x27;s Hall of Fame, along with &quot;Acquire&quot;, in 2011.

He was honored as a &quot;famous game designer&quot; by being featured as the king of diamonds in Flying Buffalo&#x27;s 2011 Famous Game Designers Playing Card Deck.

==Games==
Some of Sackson&#x27;s notable games include:
*&quot;Acquire&quot;
*&quot;Black Monday&quot;
*&quot;Bowling Solitaire&quot;
*&quot;BuyWord&quot;
*&quot;Can&#x27;t Stop&quot;
*&quot;Fields of Action&quot;
*&quot;Focus&quot;
*&quot;Haggle&quot;
*&quot;I&#x27;m the Boss!&quot;
*&quot;Network&quot;
*&quot;Patterns II&quot;
*&quot;Poke&quot;

<doc id="148054" wikidata="Q901386" url="?curid=148054" title="Damaged (Black Flag album)">
<text>Damaged is the debut studio album by the American hardcore punk band Black Flag. It was released by SST Records in November 1981.

The album was largely ignored by critics and the public at the time of its release, but has since been recognized as a classic and one of the most influential punk rock records ever made, appearing on a number of &quot;best of&quot; lists by fans and critics alike. The album was ranked number 340 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 2012 list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, though moving down to number 487 in the 2020 revision. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; also ranked it number 25 on its list of the Top 100 Albums of the 1980s.

==Background==
Black Flag had made at least two cancelled attempts to record a full-length album since the release of its first extended play &quot;Nervous Breakdown&quot;, with singers Keith Morris, Ron Reyes, and Dez Cadena; some of the Reyes sessions became the &quot;Jealous Again&quot; EP, while selections from two of many Cadena sessions became the &quot;Six Pack&quot; EP and the &quot;Louie Louie&quot;/&quot;Damaged I&quot; single; other session outtakes later comprised the &quot;Everything Went Black&quot; double album. At the time of the recording, Cadena had moved to rhythm guitar (a position he had initially intended to take when Reyes was still in the band) and 20-year-old Washington, DC expatriate Henry Rollins had become the band&#x27;s new lead singer weeks before the sessions occurred. Unlike Reyes, who had never sung in a studio before and Cadena, who had not even sung at all before joining the band, Rollins already had one recording credit to his name with the short-lived DC hardcore punk band State of Alert, who recorded &quot;No Policy&quot;, an EP released earlier that year on Dischord Records.

The band recorded their backing tracks without Rollins, who overdubbed vocals with band members Greg Ginn (guitar) and Chuck Dukowski (bass) coaching him afterward. The most complicated vocal tracks ended up being Dukowski&#x27;s &quot;What I See&quot;, which was supposed to have an improvised speech in the song&#x27;s bridge but ended up having one written out by Dukowski when Rollins could not come up with anything that he was satisfied with, and &quot;T.V. Party&quot;, which featured backing vocals from the entire band.

The album was recorded at Unicorn Studios, on Santa Monica Blvd in West Hollywood. The band was living and rehearsing in another part of the building that housed Unicorn Studios prior to the sessions.

Drummer Robo was wearing bracelets on his left wrist that rattled when he played; the rattling, whenever he hit his snare drum, especially when he hit downbeats on it, became part of the sound.

The version of &quot;Rise Above&quot; on the album was recorded at an earlier session with Rollins and was intended purely for a single release. Another version was recorded during the album sessions but the band abandoned it and decided to include the single version instead.

The closing track, &quot;Damaged I&quot;, is technically Rollins&#x27;s first writing credit with the band. In his book &quot;Get in the Van&quot;, Rollins reports that he used to improvise the lyrics every night when the song was performed live. Two takes of the vocal were done, and the first was used.

==Cover art==
The cover art, taken by punk photographer Ed Colver, depicts Rollins putting his fist through a mirror. The effect was made by cracking the mirror with a hammer, while the &quot;blood&quot; on Rollins&#x27;s wrist is a mixture of red ink and coffee. The photograph has been described as &quot;iconic&quot; in the pages of &quot;Artforum&quot;.

==Business disputes with Unicorn==
Black Flag&#x27;s distribution deal with Unicorn—which was associated with MCA Records—resulted in an initial pressing of 25,000 copies. In September 1981, MCA refused to distribute the album after the label&#x27;s president, Al Bergamo, objected to its lyrical content. Speaking with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Bergamo stated: &quot;I&#x27;m not the kind of guy who believes in burning books, but this record bothered me. As a parent with two children, I found it an anti-parent record, past the point of good taste. I listened to it all last weekend and it just didn&#x27;t seem to have any redeeming social value.&quot; Subsequently, the members of Black Flag personally visited the pressing plant and apply a sticker over the MCA logo which read, &quot;As a parent ... I found it an anti-parent record&quot;—thus essentially throwing Bergamo&#x27;s words back in his face.

Longtime SST employee Joe Carducci has reported that the &quot;anti-parent&quot; statement was a red herring. In fact, according to Carducci, Unicorn Records was so poorly managed and so deeply in debt that MCA lost money in distributing &quot;Damaged&quot;, regardless of its content, and was eager to sever its relationship with Unicorn by any possible pretext.

SST and Unicorn ended up distributing &quot;Damaged&quot; through an independent distributor; it arrived in stores in late November 1981. As a result, Unicorn filed a lawsuit against Black Flag and SST, claiming breach of contract. Black Flag were suddenly enjoined from recording any more records under their own name, although SST were able to continue with its own release schedule, releasing The Minutemen&#x27;s &quot;The Punch Line&quot; and the debuts of the Meat Puppets and Saccharine Trust. However, Unicorn released a single of an updated &quot;T.V. Party&quot; before the legal trouble started, a recording commissioned by MCA for the soundtrack to the film &quot;Repo Man&quot;.

The legal dispute between Black Flag and Unicorn tied the band up for almost two years, during which time they released &quot;Everything Went Black&quot;, a double album of pre-Rollins outtakes, under the names of the individual musicians and vocalists on the record. Unicorn ended up filing even more legal briefs, claiming that Black Flag had violated a court injunction against releasing new records. Ginn and Dukowski ended up doing several days in Los Angeles County Jail for contempt of court, but the case fizzled out soon afterward when Unicorn went out of business, freeing Black Flag of any further obligation to the label.

==Known outtakes and alternate versions==
In addition to the known unreleased version of &quot;Rise Above&quot; recorded during the album sessions and the alternate take of &quot;Damaged I&quot;, a version of Black Flag&#x27;s arrangement of &quot;Louie Louie&quot; was also recorded. According to Rollins in &quot;Get in the Van&quot;, this version featured the band going into &quot;a strange jam at the end until the tape ran out;&quot; It was never mixed down in any form. As of July 2006, it was unknown if the master tapes to these outtakes were still in existence. Henry Rollins later stated on his radio show&#x27;s blog that alternate versions of &quot;What I See&quot; and &quot;at least one other song that I can&#x27;t remember&quot; also came out of the &quot;Damaged&quot; sessions, and that other outtakes from Black Flag&#x27;s other albums also exist.

According to Black Flag&#x27;s engineer and live sound man Spot, a nearly complete version of &quot;Damaged&quot; was recorded at Golden Age Studios with Dez Cadena doing vocal duties. This session is where the tracks for the &quot;Six Pack&quot; EP came from. No official version of the remainder of this recording session has ever been released, although unlicensed copies have circulated in tape trading circles for years. A comparison of the unreleased Dez Cadena sessions with the released LP suggests that the vocal cadence and presentation of the Cadena sessions were used as a reference by the band prior to recording the final album.

An alternate version of &quot;Depression&quot; was recorded to be the b-side of the &quot;Rise Above&quot; single.

==Reception and legacy==
Reviewing for &quot;The Village Voice&quot; in January 1982, Robert Christgau was generally positive toward the album: &quot;Although the B side drags more painfully than I bet was intended, this is powerful stuff. Greg Ginn is the greatest noise guitarist since Johnny Thunders, new vocalist Henry Rollins can snarl along any tortured contour they serve up, and &#x27;Rise Above,&#x27; &#x27;Six Pack,&#x27; and the uproarious &#x27;TV Party&#x27; prove they can write songs as well as gnash fragments. Inspirational Verse: &#x27;I wanna live/I wish I was dead.&#x27;&quot;

While the album did not gain much attention from the general press on its original release, the album retrospectively has been given critical acclaim and has been cited as one of the most important hardcore punk albums ever released. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in their retrospective review says that &quot;Black Flag lived up to it, defining L.A. hardcore punk with violent guitar and the pissed-off scream of Henry Rollins, especially on &quot;TV Party&quot; and &quot;Rise Above.&quot; Punks still listen to Damaged, and parents still hate it.&quot; &quot;Pitchfork&quot; in their retrospective review from 2002 says &quot;Black Flag took on the essential ferocity of men about to snap, and combined that with an acidic sense of humor and these things called &#x27;songs&#x27;, a concept that many of the wannabe punkers of the day were still trying to sort out. &quot;Damaged&quot; hit in 1981, and by 1982, four bars bearing the Black Flag name had been airbrushed across miles and miles of spiked leather. Conflicting feelings of violence, apathy, rage, and self-satire course through this one, the essential touchstone of the entire genre of West Coast hardcore, crystallizing the turmoil of the movement. Listen to &#x27;Rise Above&#x27; and try not to be incensed, then listen to &#x27;TV Party&#x27; and try not to laugh out loud. That&#x27;s awesome.&quot; John Dougan of AllMusic gave it a perfect five star rating saying &quot;... Although Black Flag had been recording for three years prior to this release, the fact that Henry Rollins was now their lead singer made all the difference. His furious bellow and barely contained ferocity was the missing piece the band needed to become great. Also, guitarist/mastermind Greg Ginn wrote a slew of great songs for this record that, while suffused with the usual punk conceits (alienation, boredom, disenfranchisement), were capable of making one laugh out loud, especially the protoslacker satire &#x27;TV Party&#x27; ...&quot; and also noted &quot;... Extremely controversial when it was released, Damaged endured the slings and arrows of outrageous criticism (some reacted as though this record would alone cause the fall of America&#x27;s youth) to become and remain an important document of its time.&quot;

Kurt Cobain listed it in his top fifty albums of all time.
Over the years since the album&#x27;s original release it has been recognized as a punk rock classic and one of the most influential punk rock records ever made by appearing on a number of &quot;best of&quot; lists by magazines and critics. The album was ranked number 340 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; also ranked it number 25 on its &quot;Top 100 Albums of the 1980s&quot;. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

Fellow South Bay punk rock band Pennywise has covered &quot;Gimmie Gimmie Gimmie&quot; live.

<doc id="148057" wikidata="Q426242" url="?curid=148057" title="Family Man (Black Flag album)">
<text>Family Man is the third album by the American hardcore punk band Black Flag. Released in 1984 through SST Records, it features spoken word tracks by vocalist Henry Rollins and jazz-indebted instrumental tracks. It is also the first album to feature bassist Kira Roessler. &quot;Armageddon Man&quot; is the only track on the album in which Rollins and the instruments are together.

The album, along with spoken word recordings by Jello Biafra following the break-up of Dead Kennedys, is credited for introducing &quot;alternative&quot; spoken word to a larger audience.

==Music and composition==
The album features one LP side of spoken word performances from Henry Rollins and another of instrumental music from the Black Flag lineup of guitarist Greg Ginn, bassist Kira Roessler and drummer Bill Stevenson. AllMusic&#x27;s Pemberton Roach, who described the record as Black Flag&#x27;s most &quot;experimental&quot;, compared the spoken word material to Jim Morrison&#x27;s works on live The Doors releases. AllAboutJazz&#x27;s Trevor Maclaren stated: &quot;It opens three points of interest: Rollins as the Beat Poet—sort of—the stoned dirge influence of Black Sabbath, and the instrumental jazz driven metal/punk that Ginn would utilize after dissolving Black Flag.&quot; Maclaren also added: &quot;The distorted guitars and atonal feedback of players like Sonny Sharrock and James Blood Ulmer reign supreme in a sludgy Black Sabbath riff.&quot;

==Cover art==
The cover art, which was created by Raymond Pettibon, pictures a man holding a gun to his head, while his wife and son&#x27;s bodies lie on the floor, and his daughter crouches across the room from him, with blood over her right eye and on her chest. The caption on the cover reads November 23rd, 1963.

==Critical reception==
In a retrospective review of the album, AllMusic critic Pemberton Roach wrote: &quot;Although sounding at times like a high-school garage band attempting to perform Rush covers, Ginn and company play with a sense of desperation and punk rock fury that makes much of the music positively electrifying.&quot; Roach also added: &quot;Overall, &quot;Family Man&quot; is an essential, if atypical, part of the Black Flag canon and should appeal to fans of Sun Ra, Ornette Coleman, or the New York &quot;noise&quot; scene as well.&quot; In 2006, &quot;All About Jazz&quot;&#x27;s Trevor Maclaren stated that &quot;for those who seek a real adventure and think that Last Exit was perhaps too extreme, Black Flag&#x27;s &quot;Family Man&quot; and &quot;The Process of Weeding Out&quot; are choice lost gems.&quot;

<doc id="148060" wikidata="Q155952" url="?curid=148060" title="Almagest">
<text>The Almagest ( ) is a 2nd-century mathematical and astronomical treatise on the apparent motions of the stars and planetary paths, written by Claudius Ptolemy ( ) in Koine Greek. One of the most influential scientific texts in history, it canonized a geocentric model of the Universe that was accepted for more than 1,200 years from its origin in Hellenistic Alexandria, in the medieval Byzantine and Islamic worlds, and in Western Europe through the Middle Ages and early Renaissance until Copernicus. It is also a key source of information about ancient Greek astronomy.

Ptolemy set up a public inscription at Canopus, Egypt, in 147 or 148. N. T. Hamilton found that the version of Ptolemy&#x27;s models set out in the &quot;Canopic Inscription&quot; was earlier than the version in the &quot;Almagest&quot;. Hence the &quot;Almagest&quot; could not have been completed before about 150, a quarter-century after Ptolemy began observing.

== Names ==
The name comes from Arabic , with meaning &#x27;the&#x27; and being a corruption of Greek &#x27;greatest&#x27;. The Arabic name was popularized by a Latin translation known as made in the 12th century from an Arabic translation, which would endure until original Greek copies resurfaced in the 15th century.

The work was originally called () in Koine Greek, and was also known as in Latin. The treatise was later called (), &quot;The Great Treatise&quot;; ), and the superlative form of this ( , &#x27;greatest&#x27;) lies behind the Arabic name from which the English name &quot;Almagest&quot; derives.

In the study of medieval Hebrew texts, the &quot;Almagest&quot; is sometimes referred to as &quot;Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Book of Elections&quot;&quot;, to emphasize parallelism with Abraham ibn Ezra&#x27;s manuscript of the same name.

==History==
Written possibly around 150 CE the text survives as copies, the oldest being from the 9th century when Arabic scholars started to translate the text, which in turn have survived in copies from the 11th and 13th century.

== Contents ==
=== The &quot;Syntaxis Mathematica&quot; books ===
The &quot;Syntaxis Mathematica&quot; consists of thirteen sections, called books. As with many medieval manuscripts that were handcopied or, particularly, printed in the early years of printing, there were considerable differences between various editions of the same text, as the process of transcription was highly personal. An example illustrating how the &quot;Syntaxis&quot; was organized is given below; it is a Latin edition printed in 1515 at Venice by Petrus Lichtenstein.{{sfn|Lichtenstein|1515|p={{Pages needed|date=April 2023}}}}

* Book I contains an outline of Aristotle&#x27;s cosmology: on the spherical form of the heavens, with the spherical Earth lying motionless as the center, with the fixed stars and the various planets revolving around the Earth. Then follows an explanation of chords with table of chords; observations of the obliquity of the ecliptic (the apparent path of the Sun through the stars); and an introduction to spherical trigonometry.
* Book II covers problems associated with the daily motion attributed to the heavens, namely risings and settings of celestial objects, the length of daylight, the determination of latitude, the points at which the Sun is vertical, the shadows of the gnomon at the equinoxes and solstices, and other observations that change with the observer&#x27;s position. There is also a study of the angles made by the ecliptic with the vertical, with tables.
* Book III covers the length of the year, and the motion of the Sun. Ptolemy explains Hipparchus&#x27; discovery of the precession of the equinoxes and begins explaining the theory of epicycles.
* Books IV and V cover the motion of the Moon, lunar parallax, the motion of the lunar apogee, and the sizes and distances of the Sun and Moon relative to the Earth.
* Book VI covers solar and lunar eclipses.
* Books VII and VIII cover the motions of the fixed stars, including precession of the equinoxes. They also contain a star catalogue of 1022 stars, described by their positions in the constellations, together with ecliptic longitude and latitude.{{refn|1= The catalogue actually contained 1,028 entries, but three of these were deliberate duplicates, because Ptolemy regarded certain stars as being shared between adjacent constellations. Three other entries were non-stellar, i.e. the Double Cluster in Perseus, M44 (Praesepe) in Cancer, and the globular cluster Omega Centauri.{{sfn|Ridpath|2023|loc=&quot;Ptolemy’s Almagest&quot;}} Ptolemy states that the longitudes (which increase due to precession) are for the beginning of the reign of Antoninus Pius (138 AD), whereas the latitudes do not change with time (but see the star catalog). The constellations north of the zodiac and the northern zodiac constellations (Aries through Virgo) are in the table at the end of Book VII, while the rest are in the table at the beginning of Book VIII. The brightest stars were marked first magnitude ({{mvar|m}} = 1), while the faintest visible to the naked eye were sixth magnitude ({{mvar|m}} = 6). Each numerical magnitude was considered twice the brightness of the following one, which is a logarithmic scale. (The ratio was subjective as no photodetectors existed.) This system is believed to have originated with Hipparchus. The stellar positions too are of Hipparchan origin, despite Ptolemy&#x27;s claim to the contrary. Ptolemy identified 48 constellations: The 12 of the zodiac, 21 to the north of the zodiac, and 15 to the south.{{sfn|Ridpath|2023|loc=Ptolemy’s 48 constellations}}|group=note}}
* Book IX addresses general issues associated with creating models for the five naked eye planets, and the motion of Mercury.
* Book X covers the motions of Venus and Mars.
* Book XI covers the motions of Jupiter and Saturn.
* Book XII covers stations and retrograde motion, which occurs when planets appear to pause, then briefly reverse their motion against the background of the zodiac. Ptolemy understood these terms to apply to Mercury and Venus as well as the outer planets.
* Book XIII covers motion in latitude, that is, the deviation of planets from the ecliptic. The final topic of this chapter also covers how to determine when a planet first becomes visible after being hidden by the glare of the sun, as well as the last time it is seen before being hidden by the sun&#x27;s glare.

=== Ptolemy&#x27;s cosmos ===
The cosmology of the &quot;Syntaxis&quot; includes five main points, each of which is the subject of a chapter in Book I. What follows is a close paraphrase of Ptolemy&#x27;s own words from Toomer&#x27;s translation.{{sfn|Toomer|1984|p={{Pages needed|date=April 2023}}}}

* The celestial realm is spherical, and moves as a sphere.
* The Earth is a sphere.
* The Earth is at the center of the cosmos.
* The Earth, in relation to the distance of the fixed stars, has no appreciable size and must be treated as a mathematical point.{{sfn|Ptolemy|1952|loc= Book I, Chapter 5, p.9}}
* The Earth does not move.

=== The star catalogue ===
The layout of the catalogue has always been tabular.{{sfn|Lichtenstein|1515|p=79}} Ptolemy writes explicitly that the coordinates are given as (ecliptical) &quot;longitudes&quot; and &quot;latitudes&quot;, which are given in columns, so this has probably always been the case. It is significant that Ptolemy chooses the ecliptical coordinate system because of his knowledge of precession, which distinguishes him from all his predecessors. Hipparchus&#x27; celestial globe had an ecliptic drawn in, but the coordinates were equatorial.{{sfn|Hoffmann|2017|p={{Pages needed|date=April 2023}}}} Since Hipparchus&#x27; star catalogue has not survived in its original form, but was absorbed into the Almagest star catalogue (and heavily revised in the 265 years in between),{{sfn|Hoffmann|2018|p={{Pages needed|date=April 2023}}}}{{sfn|Hoffmann|2017|p={{Pages needed|date=April 2023}}}} the Almagest star catalogue is the oldest one in which complete tables of coordinates and magnitudes have come down to us.

As mentioned, Ptolemy includes a star catalog containing 1022 stars. He says that he &quot;observed as many stars as it was possible to perceive, even to the sixth magnitude&quot;. The ecliptic longitudes are given in terms of a zodiac sign and a number of degrees and fractions of a degree. The zodiac signs each represent exactly 30°, starting with Aries representing longitude 0° to 30°. The degrees are added to the lower limit of the 30-degree range to obtain the longitude. Unlike the situation with the zodiac of modern-day astrology, most of the stars of a given zodiac constellation in the catalog fall in the 30-degree range designated by the same name (the so-called &#x27;zodiac sign&#x27;). The ecliptic longitudes are about 26° lower than those of AD 2000 (the J2000 epoch).{{refn|1= For instance, the stars nu Orionis and 62 Orionis which are now around ecliptic longitude 91° are attributed longitudes in the Almagest of 66° and 64°20&#x27; respectively.|group=note}} Ptolemy says that the ecliptic longitudes are for the beginning of the reign of Antoninus Pius (138 AD) and that he found that the longitudes had increased by 2° 40′ since the time of Hipparchus which was 265 years earlier (Alm. VII, 2). But calculations show that his ecliptic longitudes correspond more closely to around the middle of the first century CE (+48 to +58).{{sfn|Toomer|1984|p={{Pages needed|date=April 2023}}}}{{sfn|Graßhoff|1990|p={{Pages needed|date=April 2023}}}}{{sfn|Hoffmann|2017|p={{Pages needed|date=April 2023}}}}

Since Tycho Brahe found this offset, astronomers and historians investigated this problem and suggested several causes:

* that all coordinates were calculated from Hipparchus&#x27; observations, whereby the precession constant, which was known too inaccurately at the time, led to a summation error (Delambre 1817);{{sfn|Graßhoff|1990|p={{Pages needed|date=April 2023}}}}{{sfn|Peters|Knobel|1915|p=15}}
* that the data had in fact been observed a century earlier by Menelaus of Alexandria (Björnbo 1901);{{sfn|Graßhoff|1990|p={{Pages needed|date=April 2023}}}}
* that the difference is a sum of individual errors of various kinds, including calibration with outdated solar data;{{sfn|Dreyer|1917|p=528}}{{sfn|Graßhoff|1990|p={{Pages needed|date=April 2023}}}}
* that Ptolemy&#x27;s instrument was wrongly calibrated and had a systematic offset.{{sfn|Vogt|1925|pp=17–54}}

Subtracting the systematic error leaves other errors that cannot be explained by precession. Of these errors, about 18 to 20 are also found in Hipparchus&#x27; star catalogue (which can only be reconstructed incompletely).{{sfn|Vogt|1925|pp=17–54}}{{sfn|Hoffmann|2017|p={{Pages needed|date=April 2023}}}} From this it can be concluded that a subset of star coordinates in the Almagest can indeed be traced back to Hipparchus,{{sfn|Graßhoff|1990|p={{Pages needed|date=April 2023}}}} but not that the complete star catalogue was simply &quot;copied&quot;. Rather, Hipparchus&#x27; major errors are no longer present in the Almagest{{sfn|Hoffmann|2017|p={{Pages needed|date=April 2023}}}} and, on the other hand, Hipparchus&#x27; star catalogue had some stars that are entirely absent from the Almagest.{{sfn|Hoffmann|2017|p={{Pages needed|date=April 2023}}}} It can be concluded that Hipparchus&#x27; star catalogue, while forming the basis, has been reobserved and revised.{{sfn|Hoffmann|2017|p={{Pages needed|date=April 2023}}}}{{sfn|Hoffmann|2018|p={{Pages needed|date=April 2023}}}}

==== Errors in the coordinates ====
The figure he used is based on Hipparchus&#x27; own estimate for precession, which was 1° in 100 years, instead of the correct 1° in 72 years. Dating attempts through proper motion of the stars also appear to date the actual observation to Hipparchus&#x27; time instead of Ptolemy.{{sfn|Dambis|Efremov|2000|pp=115–134}}

Many of the longitudes and latitudes have been corrupted in the various manuscripts. Most of these errors can be explained by similarities in the symbols used for different numbers. For example, the Greek letters Α and Δ were used to mean 1 and 4 respectively, but because these look similar copyists sometimes wrote the wrong one. In Arabic manuscripts, there was confusion between for example 3 and 8 (ج and ح). (At least one translator also introduced errors. Gerard of Cremona, who translated an Arabic manuscript into Latin around 1175, put 300° for the latitude of several stars. He had apparently learned from Moors, who used the letter س (sin) for 300 (like the Hebrew ש (shin)), but the manuscript he was translating came from the East, where س was used for 60, like the Hebrew ס (samekh).){{sfn|Peters|Knobel|1915|pp=9–14}}

Even without the errors introduced by copyists, and even accounting for the fact that the longitudes are more appropriate for 58 AD than for 137 AD, the latitudes and longitudes are not fully accurate, with errors as great as large fractions of a degree. Some errors may be due to atmospheric refraction causing stars that are low in the sky to appear higher than where they really are.{{sfn|Peters|Knobel|1915|p=14}} A series of stars in Centaurus are off by a couple of degrees, including the star we call Alpha Centauri. These were probably measured by a different person or persons from the others, and in an inaccurate way.{{sfn|Peters|Knobel|1915|p=112}}

==== Constellations in the star catalogue ====
The star catalogue contains 48 constellations, which have different surface areas and numbers of stars. In Book VIII, Chapter 3, Ptolemy writes that the constellations should be outlined on a globe, but it is unclear exactly how he means this: should surrounding polygons be drawn or should the figures be sketched or even line figures be drawn? This is not stated.

Although no line figures have survived from antiquity, the figures can be reconstructed on the basis of the descriptions in the star catalogue: The exact celestial coordinates of the figures&#x27; heads, feet, arms, wings and other body parts are recorded.{{sfn|Hoffmann|2017|p={{Pages needed|date=April 2023}}}} It is therefore possible to draw the stick figures in the modern sense so that they fit the description in the Almagest.{{refn|1= These modern stick figures as a reconstruction of the historical constellations of the Almagest are available in the free planetarium software Stellarium since 2019.{{citation needed|date=April 2023}}|group=note}}

These constellations form the basis for the modern constellations that were formally adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1922, with official boundaries that were agreed in 1928.

Of the stars in the catalogue, 108 (just over 10%) were classified by Ptolemy as &#x27;unformed&#x27;, by which he meant lying outside the recognized constellation figures. These were later absorbed into their surrounding constellations or in some cases used to form new constellations.{{sfn|Ridpath|2023|loc=&quot;How Ptolemy’s spare stars became new constellations&quot;}}

=== Ptolemy&#x27;s planetary model ===
In Almagest, Ptolemy assigned the following order to the planetary spheres, beginning with the innermost:
{{Colbegin|colwidth=30em}}
# Moon
# Mercury or Venus (undecided)
# Mercury or Venus (undecided)
# Sun
# Mars
# Jupiter
# Saturn
# Sphere of fixed stars
{{colend}}

Later, in his &quot;Planetary Hypothesis&quot;, he concludes that Mercury is the second closest planet. Other classical writers suggested different sequences. Plato ({{Circa|427|347 BC}}) placed the Sun second in order after the Moon. Martianus Capella (5th century AD) put Mercury and Venus in motion around the Sun. Ptolemy&#x27;s authority was preferred by most medieval Islamic and late medieval European astronomers. 

Ptolemy inherited from his Greek predecessors a geometrical toolbox and a partial set of models for predicting where the planets would appear in the sky. Apollonius of Perga ({{Circa|262|190 BC}}) had introduced the deferent and epicycle and the eccentric deferent to astronomy. Hipparchus (2nd century BC) had crafted mathematical models of the motion of the Sun and Moon. Hipparchus had some knowledge of Mesopotamian astronomy, and he felt that Greek models should match those of the Babylonians in accuracy. He was unable to create accurate models for the remaining five planets.

The &quot;Syntaxis&quot; adopted Hipparchus&#x27; solar model, which consisted of a simple eccentric deferent. For the Moon, Ptolemy began with Hipparchus&#x27; epicycle-on-deferent, then added a device that historians of astronomy refer to as a &quot;crank mechanism&quot;:{{sfn|Hoskin|1999|p=44}} he succeeded in creating models for the other planets, where Hipparchus had failed, by introducing a third device called the equant.

Ptolemy wrote the &quot;Syntaxis&quot; as a textbook of mathematical astronomy. It explained geometrical models of the planets based on combinations of circles, which could be used to predict the motions of celestial objects. In a later book, the &quot;Planetary Hypotheses&quot;, Ptolemy explained how to transform his geometrical models into three-dimensional spheres or partial spheres. In contrast to the mathematical &quot;Syntaxis&quot;, the &quot;Planetary Hypotheses&quot; is sometimes described as a book of cosmology.

== Influence ==

Ptolemy&#x27;s comprehensive treatise of mathematical astronomy superseded most older texts of Greek astronomy. Much of what we know about the work of astronomers like Hipparchus comes from references in the &quot;Syntaxis&quot;. 

The book was circulated among astronomers, and also among philosophers who are interested in astronomy. The Almagest, however, was not translated into Latin in ancient times and had little influence on popular literature.

The first translations into Arabic were made in the 9th century, with two separate efforts, one sponsored by the caliph Al-Ma&#x27;mun, who received a copy as a condition of peace with the Byzantine emperor.{{sfn|Angelo|2006|p=78}} Sahl ibn Bishr is thought to be the first Arabic translator.

No Latin translation was made before the 12th century. Henry Aristippus made the first Latin translation directly from a Greek copy, but it was not as influential as a later translation into Latin made in Spain by the Italian scholar Gerard of Cremona from the Arabic (finished in 1175).{{sfn|Toomer|1984|p=3}}{{sfn|Kunitzsch|1986|p=89}} Gerard translated the Arabic text while working at the Toledo School of Translators, although he was unable to translate many technical terms such as the Arabic &quot;Abrachir&quot; for Hipparchus. In the 13th century a Spanish version was produced, which was later translated under the patronage of Alfonso X.

In the 15th century, a Greek version appeared in Western Europe. The German astronomer Johannes Müller (known as Regiomontanus, after his birthplace of Königsberg in Lower Frankonia) made an abridged Latin version at the instigation of the Greek churchman Cardinal Bessarion. Around the same time, George of Trebizond made a full translation accompanied by a commentary that was as long as the original text. George&#x27;s translation, done under the patronage of Pope Nicholas V, was intended to supplant the old translation. The new translation was a great improvement; the new commentary was not, and aroused criticism.{{sfn|Shank|2020|pp=305–307}} The Pope declined the dedication of George&#x27;s work,{{sfn|Shank|2020|pp=305–307}} and Regiomontanus&#x27;s translation had the upper hand for over 100 years.{{citation needed|date=April 2023}}

During the 16th century, Guillaume Postel, who had been on an embassy to the Ottoman Empire, brought back Arabic disputations of the &quot;Almagest&quot;, such as the works of al-Kharaqī, {{lang|ar-Latn|Muntahā al-idrāk fī taqāsīm al-aflāk}} (&quot;The Ultimate Grasp of the Divisions of Spheres&quot;, 1138–39).{{sfn|Saliba|2011|pp=217–221}}

Commentaries on the &quot;Syntaxis&quot; were written by Theon of Alexandria (extant), Pappus of Alexandria (only fragments survive), and Ammonius Hermiae (lost).

== Modern assessment ==
Under the scrutiny of modern scholarship, and the cross-checking of observations contained in the Almagest against figures produced through backwards extrapolation, various patterns of errors have emerged within the work.{{sfn|Wade|1977}}{{sfn|Lewis|1979}} A prominent example is Ptolemy&#x27;s use of measurements said to have been taken at noon, but which systematically produce readings that are off by half an hour, as if the observations were taken at 12:30pm.{{sfn|Wade|1977}} However, an explanation for this error was found in 1969.{{sfn|Goldstein|1978}}{{sfn|Britton|1969}}{{sfn|Britton|1992}}

The overall quality of Claudius Ptolemy&#x27;s scholarship and place as &quot;one of the most outstanding scientists of antiquity&quot; has been challenged by several modern writers, most prominently by Robert R. Newton in the 1977 book &quot;The Crime of Claudius Ptolemy&quot;, which asserted that the scholar fabricated his observations to fit his theories. Newton accused Ptolemy of systematically inventing data or doctoring the data of earlier astronomers, and labelled him &quot;the most successful fraud in the history of science&quot;.{{sfn|Wade|1977}} One striking error noted by Newton was an autumn equinox said to have been observed by Ptolemy and &quot;measured with the greatest care&quot; at 2pm on 25 September 132, when the equinox should have been observed at 9:54am the day prior.{{sfn|Wade|1977}}
Herbert Lewis, who had reworked some of Ptolemy&#x27;s calculations, agreed with Newton that &quot;Ptolemy was an outrageous fraud&quot;, and that &quot;all those results capable of statistical analysis point beyond question towards fraud and against accidental error&quot;.{{sfn|Lewis|1979}}

Although some have described the charges laid by Newton as &quot;erudite and imposing&quot;, others have disagreed with the findings.{{sfn|Wade|1977}} Bernard R. Goldstein wrote, &quot;Unfortunately, Newton’s arguments in support of these charges are marred by all manner of distortions, misunderstandings, and excesses of rhetoric due to an intensely polemical style.&quot;{{sfn|Goldstein|1978}} Owen Gingerich, while agreeing that the Almagest contains &quot;some remarkably fishy numbers&quot;,{{sfn|Wade|1977}} including in the matter of the 30-hour displaced equinox, which he noted aligned perfectly with predictions made by Hipparchus 278 years earlier,{{sfn|Gingerich|1980}} rejected the qualification of fraud.{{sfn|Wade|1977}}{{sfn|Gingerich|1981}}
John Phillips Britton, Visiting Fellow at Yale University, wrote of R.R. Newton, &quot;I think that his main conclusion with respect to Ptolemy’s stature and achievements as an astronomer is simply wrong, and that the Almagest should be seen as a great, if not indeed the first, scientific treatise.&quot; He continued, &quot;Newton’s work does focus critical attention on the many difficulties and inconsistencies apparent in the fine structure of the Almagest. In particular, his conclusion that the Almagest is not a historical account of how Ptolemy actually derived his models and parameters is essentially the same as mine, although our reasons for this conclusion and our inferences from it differ radically.&quot;{{sfn|Britton|1992}}

== Modern editions ==
The &quot;Almagest&quot; under the Latin title &quot;Syntaxis mathematica&quot;, was edited by J. L. Heiberg in &quot;Claudii Ptolemaei opera quae exstant omnia&quot;, vols. 1.1 and 1.2 (1898, 1903).

Three translations of the &quot;Almagest&quot; into English have been published. The first, by R. Catesby Taliaferro of St. John&#x27;s College in Annapolis, Maryland, was included in volume 16 of the &quot;Great Books of the Western World&quot; in 1952. The second, by G. J. Toomer, &quot;Ptolemy&#x27;s Almagest&quot; in 1984, with a second edition in 1998.{{sfn|Toomer|1984}} The third was a partial translation by Bruce M. Perry in &quot;The Almagest: Introduction to the Mathematics of the Heavens&quot; in 2014.{{sfn|Ptolemy|2014}}

A direct French translation from the Greek text was published in two volumes in 1813 and 1816 by Nicholas Halma, including detailed historical comments in a 69-page preface. It has been described as &quot;suffer[ing] from excessive literalness, particularly where the text is difficult&quot; by Toomer, and as &quot;very faulty&quot; by Serge Jodra.{{sfn|Jodra|2013}} The scanned books are available in full at the &quot;Gallica&quot; French National library.{{sfn|Halma|1813}}{{sfn|Halma|1816}}

<doc id="148061" wikidata="Q230073" url="?curid=148061" title="Anne of Kiev">
<text>&lt;noinclude/&gt;

Anne of Kiev or Anna Yaroslavna ( 1030 – 1075) was a princess of Kievan Rus who became Queen of France in 1051 upon marrying King Henry I. She ruled the kingdom as regent during the minority of their son Philip I from Henry&#x27;s death in 1060 until her controversial marriage to Count Ralph IV of Valois. Anne founded the Abbey of St. Vincent at Senlis.

==Childhood==
Anne was a daughter of Yaroslav the Wise, Grand Prince of Kiev and Prince of Novgorod, and his second wife Ingegerd Olofsdotter of Sweden. Her exact birthdate is unknown; Philippe Delorme has suggested 1027, while Andrew Gregorovich has proposed 1032, citing a mention in a Kievan chronicle of the birth of a daughter to Yaroslav in that year.

Anne&#x27;s exact place in the birth order of her siblings is unknown, although she was almost certainly the youngest daughter. Little is known about Anne&#x27;s childhood or education. It is assumed that she was literate, at least enough to write her name, because her signature in Cyrillic exists on a document from 1061. Delorme has pointed out that Yaroslav founded a number of schools in his kingdom and suggests that education was highly valued in his family, leading him to propose a significant level of education for Anne. Gregorovich has suggested that Anne learned French in preparation for her marriage to King Henry I of France.

== Engagement ==
The negotiations for Anne&#x27;s marriage to the 18-years-older King Henry took place in the late 1040s, after the death of Henry&#x27;s first wife, Matilda of Frisia, and their only child. Due to the pressing need for an heir, and the Church&#x27;s growing disapproval of consanguineous marriages, it became necessary for Henry to seek an unrelated bride. The Kievan Rus&#x27; was not unknown to the French. Yaroslav had married several of his children to Western rulers in an attempt to avoid the influence of the Byzantine Empire.

In the autumn of 1049 or the spring of 1050, Henry sent Bishop Gauthier of Meaux, Goscelin of Chauny, and other unnamed advisors to Yaroslav&#x27;s court. It is possible that there were two diplomatic missions to the Rus at this time, with Roger of Chalons also present. No record of the marriage negotiations or the dowry arrangements survives, although Anne reportedly left Kiev with &quot;rich presents&quot;. Gregorovich claims that part of the wealth she brought to France included the jacinth jewel that Abbot Suger later mounted on a reliquary of St. Denis. Anne left Kiev in the summer or fall of 1050 and traveled to Reims.

== Queenship ==

Anne married Henry on 19 May 1051, during the feast of Pentecost. Henry was nearly twenty years older than Anne. Her wedding on 19 May 1051 followed the installation of Lietbert as bishop of Cambrai, and Anne was crowned immediately following the marriage ceremony, making her the first French queen to celebrate her coronation in Reims Cathedral.

Anne and Henry were married for nine years and had three sons: Philip, Robert (who died young), and Hugh. Anne is often credited with introducing the Greek name &quot;Philip&quot; to royal families of Western Europe, as she bestowed it on her first son; she might have imported this Greek name from her Eastern Orthodox culture. There may also have been a daughter, Emma, perhaps born in 1055; it is unknown if she married or when she died. Henry and Anne of Kiev are additionally said to have been the parents of the beatified figure Edigna.

As queen, Anne would have had the privilege of participating in the royal council, but there are almost no records of her doing so. In one 1058 charter, Henry granted a privilege to a couple of villages associated with the monastery of Saint-Maur-des-Fossés doing so &quot;with the approval of my wife Anne and our children Philip, Robert, and Hugh.&quot; Anne seems to have possessed territories in the same region under the terms of her dower.

In 1059, King Henry began feuding with the Church over issues related to Gregorian Reform. During this time, Pope Nicholas II sent Queen Anne a letter counseling her to follow her conscience to right wrongs and intervene against oppressive violence, while also encouraging her to advocate with her husband so that he might govern with moderation. According to Delorme, some historians have interpreted this letter from the Pope as being indicative of Anne&#x27;s conversion to Roman Catholicism from Eastern Orthodoxy.

== Regency ==
Upon Henry&#x27;s death on 4 August 1060, Philip succeeded to the throne. Count Baldwin V of Flanders, the husband of Henry&#x27;s sister Adela, was assigned as Philip&#x27;s guardian. Anne may still have played an active role in government at that point; an act from 1060 shows her name following Philip&#x27;s, and her name appears in four times as many charters as Baldwin&#x27;s. She also hired Philip&#x27;s tutor, who was known at court by a Greek title.

Queen Anne&#x27;s only existing signature dates from this period; it appears inscribed on a document issued at Soissons for the abbot of , now held in the National Library of France. The signature was most likely placed by a Rus&#x27; assistant of the Queen. Under the king&#x27;s rubric, there is a cross and eight letters in Cyrillic, probably meaning &quot;Ana Reina&quot;, the contemporaneous French for &quot;Queen Anne&quot;.

Evidence for Anne&#x27;s role in government, however, disappears in 1061, around the time she remarried. Her second husband was Count Ralph IV of Valois. This marriage was controversial because of the couple&#x27;s affinity (as Ralph was Henry&#x27;s cousin), and it constituted bigamy, since Ralph was still technically married to his second wife, Haquenez. Ralph was excommunicated for these transgressions. King Philip&#x27;s advisers may have encouraged him to turn away from his mother, perhaps mistrusting Ralph&#x27;s influence. Ralph began referring to himself as the king&#x27;s stepfather in the late 1060s. He died in 1074, leaving Anne a widow once again.

In 1062, Anne gave a significant amount of money to restore a dilapidated chapel at Senlis, originally dedicated to Saint Vincent of Saragossa. She bequeathed lands and income to the new establishment so that the organization could sustain itself. She also wrote a letter explaining her reasons for dedicating the monastery. The letter betrays adherence to Greek Orthodox theology. For instance, the term &quot;Mary, mother of God&quot; is used rather than the more common &quot;Our Lady&quot;, perhaps referring to the Eastern concept of the Theotokos. Some scholars believe that Anne did not write this letter herself.

== Death and aftermath ==

The exact date of Anne&#x27;s death is unknown. Delorme believes that she died on 5 September—the day commemorated at Senlis—in 1075 (the year of her last signed document), while others have proposed 1080. A &quot;terminus ante quem&quot; is provided by a 1089 document of Philip I, which indicates that Anne had died by then.

In 1682, the Jesuit antiquary Claude-Francois Menestrier announced that he had discovered Anne&#x27;s tomb at the Cistercian Abbey of Villiers. The discovery was subsequently disputed, as Villiers was not built until the thirteenth century, although it&#x27;s possible Anne&#x27;s remains had been moved there at some point following her death. Whatever monument may have been there was destroyed in the French Revolution.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, increased diplomatic contact between France and Russia led to a revived antiquarian interest in Anne, and a number of short biographies were published. In the 20th century, Anne became a symbol of Ukrainian nationalism. On the other hand, a film was produced in the Soviet Union, &quot;Yaroslavna, the Queen of France&quot; (1978), which was not related with &quot;Ukrainian nationalism&quot; in any way. An opera called &quot;Anna Yaroslavna&quot;, written by Antin Rudnytsky, was first performed at Carnegie Hall in 1969. In 1998, the Ukrainian government issued a postage stamp in her honour. In 2005, the Government of Ukraine sponsored the construction of a bronze statue of Queen Anne at Senlis, which was unveiled by President Viktor Yushchenko on 22 June. In 2024, a French-trained brigade of the Ukrainian Army was created and named after her.

<doc id="148064" wikidata="Q2143416" url="?curid=148064" title="Inverse function rule">
<text>In calculus, the inverse function rule is a formula that expresses the derivative of the inverse of a bijective and differentiable function in terms of the derivative of . More precisely, if the inverse of formula_1 is denoted as formula_2, where formula_3 if and only if formula_4, then the inverse function rule is, in Lagrange&#x27;s notation,

:formula_5.

This formula holds in general whenever formula_1 is continuous and injective on an interval , with formula_1 being differentiable at formula_8(formula_9) and whereformula_10. The same formula is also equivalent to the expression

:formula_11

where formula_12 denotes the unary derivative operator (on the space of functions) and formula_13 denotes function composition.

Geometrically, a function and inverse function have graphs that are reflections, in the line formula_14. This reflection operation turns the gradient of any line into its reciprocal.

Assuming that formula_1 has an inverse in a neighbourhood of formula_16 and that its derivative at that point is non-zero, its inverse is guaranteed to be differentiable at formula_16 and have a derivative given by the above formula.

The inverse function rule may also be expressed in Leibniz&#x27;s notation. As that notation suggests,

:formula_18

This relation is obtained by differentiating the equation formula_19 in terms of and applying the chain rule, yielding that:

:formula_20

considering that the derivative of with respect to &quot;&quot; is 1.

== Derivation ==
Let formula_1 be an invertible (bijective) function, let formula_16 be in the domain of formula_1, and let formula_24 be in the codomain of formula_1. Since f is a bijective function, formula_24 is in the range of formula_1. This also means that formula_24 is in the domain of formula_2, and that formula_16 is in the codomain of formula_2. Since formula_1 is an invertible function, we know that formula_33. The inverse function rule can be obtained by taking the derivative of this equation.

:formula_34

The right side is equal to 1 and the chain rule can be applied to the left side:

:formula_35

Rearranging then gives

:formula_36

Rather than using formula_24 as the variable, we can rewrite this equation using formula_38 as the input for formula_2, and we get the following:

:formula_40

==Examples==

* formula_41 (for positive ) has inverse formula_42.

:formula_43

:formula_44

At formula_45, however, there is a problem: the graph of the square root function becomes vertical, corresponding to a horizontal tangent for the square function.

* formula_46 (for real ) has inverse formula_47 (for positive formula_24)

:formula_49

:formula_50

==Additional properties==

* Integrating this relationship gives

::formula_51

:This is only useful if the integral exists. In particular we need formula_52 to be non-zero across the range of integration.

:It follows that a function that has a continuous derivative has an inverse in a neighbourhood of every point where the derivative is non-zero. This need not be true if the derivative is not continuous.

* Another very interesting and useful property is the following:

::formula_53

:Where formula_54 denotes the antiderivative of formula_55.

* The inverse of the derivative of f(x) is also of interest, as it is used in showing the convexity of the Legendre transform. 
Let formula_56 then we have, assuming formula_57:formula_58This can be shown using the previous notation formula_59. Then we have:

:formula_60Therefore:

:formula_61

By induction, we can generalize this result for any integer formula_62, with formula_63, the nth derivative of f(x), and formula_64, assuming formula_65:

==Higher derivatives==

The chain rule given above is obtained by differentiating the identity formula_67 with respect to . One can continue the same process for higher derivatives. Differentiating the identity twice with respect to &quot;&quot;, one obtains

:formula_68

that is simplified further by the chain rule as

:formula_69

Replacing the first derivative, using the identity obtained earlier, we get

:formula_70

Similarly for the third derivative:

:formula_71

or using the formula for the second derivative,

:formula_72

These formulas are generalized by the Faà di Bruno&#x27;s formula.

These formulas can also be written using Lagrange&#x27;s notation. If &#x27; and &#x27; are inverses, then

:formula_73

==Example==

* formula_46 has the inverse formula_75. Using the formula for the second derivative of the inverse function,

:formula_76

so that

:formula_77,

which agrees with the direct calculation.

<text>Everything Went Black is a compilation album by the American hardcore punk band Black Flag. It was released in 1982 through SST Records. The compilation comprises early songs recorded before Henry Rollins became the band&#x27;s vocalist in 1981, and was initially released without the group&#x27;s name on its cover, due to their lawsuit with MCA/Unicorn. Instead, the names of the group members were listed on the first release.

==Reception==
In a 1983 &quot;Trouser Press&quot; review, Ira Robbins noted that only &quot;side three comes close&quot; to matching their best work, describing the album as &quot;a potent dose of unrestrained hardcore, and an edifying trip through the convoluted past of Black Flag.&quot;

<doc id="148069" wikidata="Q266" url="?curid=148069" title="Drosera">
<text>Drosera, which is commonly known as the sundews, is one of the largest genera of carnivorous plants, with at least 194 species. These members of the family Droseraceae lure, capture, and digest insects using stalked mucilaginous glands covering their leaf surfaces. The insects are used to supplement the poor mineral nutrition of the soil in which the plants grow. Various species, which vary greatly in size and form, are native to every continent except Antarctica.

Charles Darwin performed much of the early research into &quot;Drosera&quot;, engaging in a long series of experiments with &quot;Drosera rotundifolia&quot; which were the first to confirm carnivory in plants. In an 1860 letter, Darwin wrote, “…at the present moment, I care more about &quot;Drosera&quot; than the origin of all the species in the world.”

== Taxonomy ==
The botanical name from the Greek &quot;drosos&quot; &quot;dew, dewdrops&quot; refer to the glistening drops of mucilage at the tip of the glandular trichomes that resemble drops of morning dew. The English common name &quot;sundew&quot; also describes this, derived from Latin &quot;ros solis&quot; meaning &quot;dew of the sun&quot;.

The &quot;Principia Botanica&quot;, published in 1787, states “Sun-dew (&quot;Drosera&quot;) derives its name from small drops of a liquor-like dew, hanging on its fringed leaves, and continuing in the hottest part of the day, exposed to the sun.”

=== Phylogenetics ===

The unrooted cladogram to the right shows the relationship between various subgenera and classes as defined by the analysis of Rivadavia &quot;et al.&quot; The monotypic section &quot;Meristocaulis&quot; was not included in the study, so its place in this system is unclear. More recent studies have placed this group near section &quot;Bryastrum&quot;, so it is placed there below. Also of note, the placement of the section &quot;Regiae&quot; in relation to &quot;Aldrovanda&quot; and &quot;Dionaea&quot; is uncertain. Since the section &quot;Drosera&quot; is polyphyletic, it shows up multiple times in the cladogram (*).

This phylogenetic study has made the need for a revision of the genus even clearer.

== Description ==

Sundews are perennial (or rarely annual) herbaceous plants, forming prostrate or upright rosettes between in height, depending on the species. Climbing species form scrambling stems which can reach much longer lengths, up to in the case of &quot;D. erythrogyne&quot;. Sundews have been shown to be able to achieve a lifespan of 50 years. The genus is specialized for nutrient uptake through its carnivorous behavior, for example the pygmy sundew is missing the enzymes (nitrate reductase, in particular) that plants normally use for the uptake of earth-bound nitrates.

=== Growth Form ===
The genus can be divided into several habits, or growth forms:
* Temperate sundews: These species form a tight cluster of unfurled leaves called a hibernaculum in a winter dormancy period (= Hemicryptophyte). All of the North American and European species belong to this group. &quot;Drosera arcturi&quot; from Australia (including Tasmania) and New Zealand is another temperate species that dies back to a horn-shaped hibernaculum.
* Subtropical sundews: These species maintain vegetative growth year-round under uniform or nearly uniform climatic conditions.
* Pygmy sundews: A group of roughly 40 Australian species, they are distinguished by miniature growth, the formation of gemmae for asexual reproduction, and dense formation of hairs in the crown center. These hairs serve to protect the plants from Australia&#x27;s intense summer sun. Pygmy sundews form the subgenus &quot;Bryastrum&quot;.
* Tuberous sundews: These nearly 50 Australian species form an underground tuber to survive the extremely dry summers of their habitat, re-emerging in the autumn. These so-called tuberous sundews can be further divided into two groups, those that form rosettes and those that form climbing or scrambling stems. Tuberous sundews comprise the subgenus &quot;Ergaleium&quot;.

* &quot;Petiolaris&quot; complex: A group of tropical Australian species, they live in constantly warm but sometimes wet conditions. Several of the 14 species that comprise this group have developed special strategies to cope with the alternately drier conditions. Many species, for example, have petioles densely covered in trichomes, which maintain a sufficiently humid environment and serve as an increased condensation surface for morning dew. The &quot;Petiolaris&quot; complex comprises the subgenus &quot;Lasiocephala&quot;.

Although they do not form a single strictly defined growth form, a number of species are often put together in a further group:
* Queensland sundews: A small group of three species (&quot;D. adelae&quot;, &quot;D. schizandra&quot; and &quot;D. prolifera&quot;), all are native to highly humid habitats in the dim understories of the Australian rainforest.

=== Leaves and Entomophagy ===

Sundews are characterised by the glandular tentacles, topped with sticky secretions, that cover their leaves. The trapping and digestion mechanism usually employs two types of glands: stalked glands that secrete sweet mucilage to attract and ensnare insects and enzymes to digest them, and sessile glands that absorb the resulting nutrient soup (the latter glands are missing in some species, such as &quot;D. erythrorhiza&quot;). Small prey, mainly consisting of insects, are attracted by the sweet secretions of the peduncular glands. Upon touching these, the prey become entrapped by sticky mucilage which prevents their progress or escape. Eventually, the prey either succumb to death through exhaustion or through asphyxiation as the mucilage envelops them and clogs their spiracles. Death usually occurs within 15 minutes. The plant meanwhile secretes esterase, peroxidase, phosphatase and protease enzymes. These enzymes dissolve the insect and free the nutrients contained within it. This nutrient mixture is then absorbed through the leaf surfaces to be used by the rest of the plant.
All species of sundew are able to move their tentacles in response to contact with edible prey. The tentacles are extremely sensitive and will bend toward the center of the leaf to bring the insect into contact with as many stalked glands as possible. According to Charles Darwin, the contact of the legs of a small gnat with a single tentacle is enough to induce this response. This response to touch is known as thigmonasty, and is quite rapid in some species. The outer tentacles (recently coined as &quot;snap-tentacles&quot;) of &quot;D. burmanni&quot; and &quot;D. sessilifolia&quot; can bend inwards toward prey in a matter of seconds after contact, while &quot;D. glanduligera&quot; is known to bend these tentacles in toward prey in tenths of a second. In addition to tentacle movement, some species are able to bend their leaves to various degrees to maximize contact with the prey. Of these, &quot;D. capensis&quot; exhibits what is probably the most dramatic movement, curling its leaf completely around prey in 30 minutes. Some species, such as &quot;D. filiformis&quot;, are unable to bend their leaves in response to prey.
A further type of (mostly strong red and yellow) leaf coloration has recently been discovered in a few Australian species (&quot;D. hartmeyerorum&quot;, &quot;D. indica&quot;). Their function is not known yet, although they may help in attracting prey.

The leaf morphology of the species within the genus is extremely varied, ranging from the sessile ovate leaves of &quot;D. erythrorhiza&quot; to the bipinnately divided acicular leaves of &quot;D. binata&quot;.

While the exact physiological mechanism of the sundew&#x27;s carnivorous response is not yet known, some studies have begun to shed light on how the plant is able to move in response to mechanical and chemical stimulation to envelop and digest prey. Individual tentacles, when mechanically stimulated, fire action potentials that terminate near the base of the tentacle, resulting in rapid movement of the tentacle towards the center of the leaf. This response is more prominent when marginal tentacles further away from the leaf center are stimulated. The tentacle movement response is achieved through auxin-mediated acid growth. When action potentials reach their target cells, the plant hormone auxin causes protons (H+ ions) to be pumped out of the plasma membrane into the cell wall, thereby reducing the pH and making the cell wall more acidic. The resulting reduction in pH causes the relaxation of the cell wall protein, expansin, and allows for an increase in cell volume via osmosis and turgor. As a result of differential cell growth rates, the sundew tentacles are able to achieve movement towards prey and the leaf center through the bending caused by expanding cells. Among some drosera species, a second bending response occurs in which non-local, distant tentacles bend towards prey as well as the bending of the entire leaf blade to maximize contact with prey. While mechanical stimulation is sufficient to achieve a localized tentacle bend response, both mechanical and chemical stimuli are required for the secondary bending response to occur.

=== Flowers and fruit ===

The flowers of sundews, as with nearly all carnivorous plants, are held far above the leaves by a long stem. This physical isolation of the flower from the traps is commonly thought to be an adaptation meant to avoid trapping potential pollinators. The mostly unforked inflorescences are spikes, whose flowers open one at a time and usually only remain open for a short period. Flowers open in response to light intensity (often opening only in direct sunlight), and the entire inflorescence is also heliotropic, moving in response to the sun&#x27;s position in the sky.

The radially symmetrical (actinomorphic) flowers are always perfect and have five parts (the exceptions to this rule are the four-petaled &quot;D. pygmaea&quot; and the eight to 12-petaled &quot;D. heterophylla&quot;). Most of the species have small flowers (&lt;1.5 cm or 0.6 in). A few species, however, such as &quot;D. regia&quot; and &quot;D. cistiflora&quot;, have flowers or more in diameter. In general, the flowers are white or pink. Australian species display a wider range of colors, including orange (&quot;D. callistos&quot;), red (&quot;D. adelae&quot;), yellow (&quot;D. zigzagia&quot;) or metallic violet (&quot;D. microphylla&quot;).

The ovary is superior and develops into a dehiscent seed capsule bearing numerous tiny seeds. The pollen grain type is compound, which means four microspores (pollen grains) are stuck together with a protein called callose.

=== Roots ===

The root systems of most &quot;Drosera&quot; are often only weakly developed or have lost their original functions. They are relatively useless for nutrient uptake, and they serve mainly to absorb water and to anchor the plant to the ground; they have long hairs.

A few South African species use their roots for water and food storage. Some species have wiry root systems that remain during frosts if the stem dies. Some species, such as &quot;D. adelae&quot; and &quot;D. hamiltonii&quot;, use their roots for asexual propagation, by sprouting plantlets along their length. Some Australian species form underground corms for this purpose, which also serve to allow the plants to survive dry summers. The roots of pygmy sundews are often extremely long in proportion to their size, with a 1-cm (0.4-in) plant extending roots over beneath the soil surface. Some pygmy sundews, such as &quot;D. lasiantha&quot; and &quot;D. scorpioides&quot;, also form adventitious roots as supports.

&quot;D. intermedia&quot; and &quot;D. rotundifolia&quot; have been reported to form arbuscular mycorrhizae, which penetrate the plant&#x27;s tissues, they also host fungi like endophytes to collect nutrients when they grow in poor soil and form symbiotic relationships.

== Reproduction ==
Many species of sundews are self-fertile; their flowers will often self-pollinate upon closing. Often, numerous seeds are produced. The tiny black seeds germinate in response to moisture and light, while seeds of temperate species also require cold, damp, stratification to germinate. Seeds of the tuberous species require a hot, dry summer period followed by a cool, moist winter to germinate.

Vegetative reproduction occurs naturally in some species that produce stolons or when roots come close to the surface of the soil. Older leaves that touch the ground may sprout plantlets. Pygmy sundews reproduce asexually using specialized scale-like leaves called gemmae. Tuberous sundews can produce offsets from their corms.

In culture, sundews can often be propagated through leaf, crown, or root cuttings, as well as through seeds.

== Distribution ==

The range of the sundew genus stretches from Alaska in the north to New Zealand in the south. The centers of diversity are Australia, with roughly 50% of all known species, and South America and southern Africa, each with more than 20 species. A few species are also found in large parts of Eurasia and North America. These areas, however, can be considered to form the outskirts of the generic range, as the ranges of sundews do not typically approach temperate or Arctic areas. Contrary to previous supposition, the evolutionary speciation of this genus is no longer thought to have occurred with the breakup of Gondwana through continental drift. Rather, speciation is now thought to have occurred as a result of a subsequent wide dispersal of its range. The origins of the genus are thought to have been in Africa or Australia.

Europe is home to only three species: &quot;D. intermedia&quot;, &quot;D. anglica&quot;, and &quot;D. rotundifolia&quot;. Where the ranges of the two latter species overlap, they sometimes hybridize to form the sterile &quot;D. × obovata&quot;. In addition to the three species and the hybrid native to Europe, North America is also home to four additional species; &quot;D. brevifolia&quot; is a small annual native to coastal states from Texas to Virginia, while &quot;D. capillaris&quot;, a slightly larger plant with a similar range, is also found in areas of the Caribbean. The third species, &quot;D. linearis&quot;, is native to the northern United States and southern Canada. &quot;D. filiformis&quot; has two subspecies native to the East Coast of North America, the Gulf Coast, and the Florida panhandle.

This genus is often described as cosmopolitan, meaning it has worldwide distribution. The botanist Ludwig Diels, author of the only monograph of the family to date, called this description an &quot;arrant misjudgment of this genus&#x27; highly unusual distributional circumstances (&quot;arge Verkennung ihrer höchst eigentümlichen Verbreitungsverhältnisse&quot;)&quot;, while admitting sundew species do &quot;occupy a significant part of the Earth&#x27;s surface (&quot;einen beträchtlichen Teil der Erdoberfläche besetzt&quot;)&quot;. 
He particularly pointed to the absence of &quot;Drosera&quot; species from almost all arid climate zones, countless rainforests, the American Pacific Coast, Polynesia, the Mediterranean region, and North Africa, as well as the scarcity of species diversity in temperate zones, such as Europe and North America.

== Habitat ==

Sundews generally grow in seasonally moist or more rarely constantly wet habitats with acidic soils and high levels of sunlight. Common habitats include bogs, fens, swamps, marshes, the tepuis of Venezuela, the wallums of coastal Australia, the fynbos of South Africa, and moist streambanks. Many species grow in association with sphagnum moss, which absorbs much of the soil&#x27;s nutrient supply and also acidifies the soil, making nutrients less available to plant life. This allows sundews, which do not rely on soil-bound nutrients, to flourish where more dominating vegetation would usually outcompete them.

The genus, though, is very variable in terms of habitat. Individual sundew species have adapted to a wide variety of environments, including atypical habitats, such as rainforests, deserts (&quot;D. burmanni&quot; and &quot;D. indica&quot;), and even highly shaded environments (Queensland sundews). The temperate species, which form hibernacula in the winter, are examples of such adaptation to habitats; in general, sundews tend to inhabit warm climates, and are only moderately frost-resistant.

== Conservation status ==

Protection of the genus varies between countries. None of the &quot;Drosera&quot; species in the United States are federally protected. Some are listed as threatened or endangered at the state level, but this gives little protection to lands under private ownership. Many of the remaining native populations are located on protected land, such as national parks or wildlife preserves. &quot;Drosera&quot; species are protected by law in many European countries, such as Germany, Austria, Switzerland, the Czech Republic, Finland, Hungary, France, and Bulgaria. In Australia, they are listed as &quot;threatened&quot;. In South America and the Caribbean, &quot;Drosera&quot; species in a number of areas are considered critical, endangered or vulnerable, while other areas have not been surveyed. At the same time that species are at risk in South Africa, new species continue to be discovered in the Western Cape and Madagascar.

Worldwide, &quot;Drosera&quot; are at risk of extinction due to the destruction of natural habitat through urban and agricultural development. They are also threatened by the illegal collection of wild plants for the horticultural trade. An additional risk is environmental change, because species are often specifically adapted to a precise location and set of conditions.

Currently, the largest threat in Europe and North America is loss of wetland habitat. Causes include urban development and the draining of bogs for agricultural uses and peat harvesting.
Such threats have led to the extirpation of some species from parts of their former range. Reintroduction of plants into such habitats is usually difficult or impossible, as the ecological needs of certain populations are closely tied to their geographical location. Increased legal protection of bogs and moors, and a concentrated effort to renaturalize such habitats, are possible ways to combat threats to &quot;Drosera&quot; plants&#x27; survival. As part of the landscape, sundews are often overlooked or not recognized at all.

In South Africa and Australia, two of the three centers of species diversity, the natural habitats of these plants are undergoing a high degree of pressure from human activities. The African sundews &quot;D. insolita&quot; and &quot;D. katangensis&quot; are listed as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), while &quot;D. bequaertii&quot; is listed as vulnerable. Expanding population centers such as Queensland, Perth, and Cape Town, and the draining of moist areas for agriculture and forestry in rural areas threaten many such habitats. The droughts that have been sweeping Australia in the 21st century pose a threat to many species by drying up previously moist areas.

Those species endemic to a very limited area are often most threatened by the collection of plants from the wild. &quot;D. madagascariensis&quot; is considered endangered in Madagascar because of the large-scale removal of plants from the wild for exportation; 10 - 200 million plants are harvested for commercial medicinal use annually.

== Uses ==

===Traditional medicine ===
The Zafimaniry people in central Madagascar have been using &quot;Drosera madagascariensis&quot; as a remedy for dysentery and fever.

In Western medicine, sundews were used as medicinal herbs as early as the 12th century, when an Italian doctor from the School of Salerno, Matthaeus Platearius, described the plant as an herbal remedy for coughs under the name &quot;herba sole&quot;. 
Culbreth&#x27;s 1927 &quot;Materia Medica&quot; listed &quot;D. rotundifolia&quot;, &quot;D. anglica&quot; and &quot;D. linearis&quot; as being used as stimulants and expectorants, and &quot;of doubtful efficacy&quot; for treating bronchitis, whooping cough, and tuberculosis. 
Sundew tea was recommended by herbalists for dry coughs, bronchitis, whooping cough, asthma and &quot;bronchial cramps&quot;.
The &quot;French Pharmacopoeia&quot; of 1965 listed sundew for the treatment of inflammatory diseases such as asthma, chronic bronchitis and whooping cough.

&quot;Drosera&quot; has been used commonly in cough preparations in Germany and elsewhere in Europe. In traditional medicine practices, &quot;Drosera&quot; is used to treat ailments such as asthma, coughs, lung infections, and stomach ulcers.

Herbal preparations are primarily made using the roots, flowers, and fruit-like capsules. Since all native sundews species are protected in many parts of Europe and North America, extracts are usually prepared using cultivated fast-growing sundews (specifically &quot;D. rotundifolia&quot;, &quot;D. intermedia&quot;, &quot;D. anglica&quot;, &quot;D. ramentacea&quot; and &quot;D. madagascariensis&quot;) or from plants collected and imported from Madagascar, Spain, France, Finland and the Baltics.

Sundews are historically mentioned as an aphrodisiac (hence the common name &quot;lustwort&quot;). They are mentioned as a folk remedy for treatment of warts, corns, and freckles.

=== As ornamental plants ===
Because of their carnivorous nature and the beauty of their glistening traps, sundews have become favorite ornamental plants; however, the environmental requirements of most species are relatively stringent and can be difficult to meet in cultivation. As a result, most species are unavailable commercially. A few of the hardiest varieties, however, have made their way into the mainstream nursery business and can often be found for sale next to Venus flytraps. These most often include &quot;D. capensis&quot;, &quot;D. aliciae&quot;, and &quot;D. spatulata&quot;.

Cultivation requirements vary greatly by species. In general, though, sundews require high environmental moisture content, usually in the form of a constantly moist or wet soil substrate. Most species also require this water to be pure, as nutrients, salts, or minerals in their soil can stunt their growth or even kill them. Commonly, plants are grown in a soil substrate containing some combination of dead or live sphagnum moss, sphagnum peat moss, sand, and/or perlite, and are watered with distilled, reverse osmosis, or rain water.

=== Nano-biotechnology ===
The mucilage produced by &quot;Drosera&quot; has remarkable elastic properties and has made this genus a very attractive subject in biomaterials research. In one recent study, the adhesive mucilages of three species (&quot;D. binata&quot;, &quot;D. capensis&quot;, and &quot;D. spatulata&quot;) were analyzed for nanofiber and nanoparticle content. Using atomic force microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, researchers were able to observe networks of nanofibers and nanoparticles of various sizes within the mucilage residues. In addition, calcium, magnesium, and chlorine – key components of biological salts - were identified. These nanoparticles are theorized to increase the viscosity and stickiness of the mucilage, in turn increasing the effectiveness of the trap.

More importantly for biomaterials research, however, is the fact that, when dried, the mucin provides a suitable substrate for the attachment of living cells. This has important implications for tissue engineering, especially because of the elastic qualities of the adhesive. Essentially, a coating of &quot;Drosera&quot; mucilage on a surgical implant, such as a replacement hip or an organ transplant, could drastically improve the rate of recovery and decrease the potential for rejection, because living tissue can effectively attach and grow on it. The authors also suggest a wide variety of applications for &quot;Drosera&quot; mucin, including wound treatment, regenerative medicine, or enhancing synthetic adhesives. Because this mucilage can stretch to nearly a million times its original size and is readily available for use, it can be an extremely cost-efficient source of biomaterial.

=== Other uses ===
The corms of the tuberous sundews native to Australia are considered a delicacy by the Indigenous Australians. Some of these corms were also used to dye textiles, while another purple or yellow dye was traditionally prepared in the Scottish Highlands using &quot;D. rotundifolia&quot;. A sundew liqueur is also still produced using a recipe from the 14th century. It is made using fresh leaves from mainly &quot;D. capensis&quot;, &quot;D. spatulata&quot;, and &quot;D. rotundifolia&quot;.

==Chemical constituents==
Several chemical compounds with potential biological activities are found in sundews, including flavonoids (kaempferol, myricetin, quercetin and hyperoside), quinones (plumbagin, hydroplumbagin glucoside and rossoliside (7–methyl–hydrojuglone–4–glucoside)), and other constituents such as carotenoids, plant acids (e.g. butyric acid, citric acid, formic acid, gallic acid, malic acid, propionic acid), resin, tannins and ascorbic acid (vitamin C).

<doc id="148070" wikidata="Q632992" url="?curid=148070" title="Swan Song Records">
<text>Swan Song Records was a record label that was launched by the English rock band Led Zeppelin on 10 May 1974; however, its first record releases (in UK and US, respectively) were &quot;Silk Torpedo&quot;, by another English rock band, The Pretty Things, and the self-titled album, &quot;Bad Company&quot;. It was overseen by Led Zeppelin&#x27;s manager Peter Grant and was a vehicle for the band to promote its own products as well as sign artists who found it difficult to win contracts with other major labels. The decision to launch the label came after Led Zeppelin&#x27;s five-year contract with Atlantic Records expired at the end of 1973, although Atlantic ultimately distributed the label&#x27;s product.

Artists that released material on the Swan Song label included Led Zeppelin itself, solo releases by Led Zeppelin band members Jimmy Page and Robert Plant, Bad Company, Pretty Things, Dave Edmunds, Mirabai, Maggie Bell (and the short-lived band she fronted, Midnight Flyer), Detective, and Sad Café. In addition to these artists, two other noted recording acts (though not signed to the label) were credited artists on Swan Song singles, both of which were UK hits in 1981: BA Robertson sang a duet with Maggie Bell on the single &quot;Hold Me&quot;, and Stray Cats backed Dave Edmunds on his 1981 single &quot;The Race Is On&quot;.

Swan Song ceased active operations in 1983 and now exists only to reissue previously released material.

==History==
In January 1974, Led Zeppelin negotiated an agreement with Atlantic Records to set up Swan Song Records. The label was launched with parties in New York and Los Angeles. A lavish media party was also held at Chislehurst Caves in Kent on 31 October 1974, to celebrate the label&#x27;s first UK release by the Pretty Things, &quot;Silk Torpedo&quot; (the first US release for Swan Song was the self-titled debut album from Bad Company in June 1974). The company logo, designed by Hipgnosis and illustrated by Joe Petagno, was based on &quot;Evening&quot; also called&quot; The Fall of Day&quot; (1869) by painter William Rimmer.

By April 1975, Swan Song had four albums (&quot;Bad Company&quot;, &quot;Silk Torpedo&quot;, &quot;Physical Graffiti&quot;, and &quot;Suicide Sal&quot;) in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200 chart. The recording label also partly funded film projects such as &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot; in 1975. In an interview he gave in January of that year, Page offered his perspective on the label:

Two years later, he elaborated on Led Zeppelin&#x27;s intention to found the label:

Artists who signed with the label but did not produce any releases included Metropolis (which featured members from the Pretty Things), The Message (which featured future Bon Jovi members Alec John Such and Richie Sambora), and Itchy Brother (which featured future members of The Kentucky Headhunters). Artists that Swan Song Records wanted to sign but who bowed out to other labels were Roy Harper and blues guitarist Bobby Parker. When Swan Song&#x27;s offices were cleared out in 1983, early demos from Iron Maiden, Heart and Paul Young&#x27;s band Q-Tips were among those found, unplayed and stored, on the shelves.

In the original cut of the 1974 film Phantom of the Paradise, the name of a media conglomerate owned by the antagonist Swan was &quot;Swan Song Enterprises&quot;. The name had to be deleted from the film prior to release due to objections from Swan Song Records. Although most references were removed, &quot;Swan Song&quot; remains visible in several scenes.

Swan Song ceased operations in October 1983 due to the break-up of Led Zeppelin and Peter Grant&#x27;s health problems. An attempt to save the label by Atlantic Records executive Phil Carson proved fruitless. Robert Plant started his own label, Es Paranza Records, in the wake of the closure of Swan Song, while Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones returned to Atlantic Records. Bad Company moved over to both Atlantic and its subsidiary Atco when they resumed in the late 1980s. Today, the label is strictly used for reissues of albums that were released by the label when it was active except in 2012 the label was resurrected when Led Zeppelin released the live Celebration Day document of their 2007 one-off reunion concert.

<text>Simon Anthony Lee Brett OBE FRSL (born 28 October 1945 in Worcester Park, Surrey, England) is a British author of detective fiction, a playwright, and a producer-writer for television and radio. As an author, he is best known for his mystery series featuring Charles Paris, Mrs Pargeter, Fethering, and Blotto &amp; Twinks. His radio credits have included &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t a Clue&quot; and &quot;Just a Minute&quot;.

==Personal life==
The son of chartered surveyor John Brett and Margaret (née Lee), a teacher, he had 2 siblings - Penelope Clark and Michael Brett (author of How to Read Financial Pages). He was educated at Dulwich College and Wadham College, Oxford, where he gained a first-class honours degree in English. He is married with three children and lives in Arundel, West Sussex, England.

Brett was the president of the Detection Club from 2000 to 2015. He was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2016 New Year Honours for services to literature.

In 2015, Brett was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature.

==Radio and television career==
After his graduation from Oxford University, Brett joined the BBC as a trainee and worked for BBC Radio and London Weekend Television. While with the BBC, Brett produced the pilot episode of &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;, as well as many episodes of the comedy series &quot;The Burkiss Way&quot;, as well as the comedy panel games &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t a Clue&quot; and &quot;Just a Minute&quot; and radio adaptations of &quot;Lord Peter Wimsey&quot;. He also co-produced &quot;From Us To You&quot; for BBC Radio 4 with David Hatch. In the mid-1990s, Brett wrote and hosted &quot;Foul Play&quot;, a radio panel game in which well-known writers of detective fiction were challenged to solve a dramatised mystery. When he moved into television, Brett was responsible for producing &quot;End of Part One&quot; (1979–80) and the television revival of &quot;The Glums&quot; (1979), both for LWT.

Brett wrote several sitcoms, including BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;After Henry&quot;, &quot;No Commitments&quot;, &quot;Semi Circles&quot; and &quot;Smelling of Roses&quot;. &quot;After Henry&quot; was later produced on television for ITV. He has written episodes of the BBC radio detective drama &quot;Baldi&quot; (2000).

In 1987, the Nigel Molesworth character created by Geoffrey Willans was reprised for a four-part BBC Radio 4 series &quot;Molesworth&quot;. Written by Simon Brett, the series portrayed Molesworth in middle age, still surrounded by many of the characters from his youth. Molesworth was played by Willie Rushton, with Penelope Nice as his wife Louise, and Clive Swift as the now-aged ex-headmaster Grimes.

==Bibliography==
=== Detective novels ===
Brett has written five series of detective novels (Charles Paris, Mrs Pargeter, Fethering, Blotto &amp; Twinks, and the Decluttering Mysteries). Most of these novels are in the &quot;Golden Age&quot; tradition of detective fiction, entertaining the reader through humour, eccentric characters and intricate plot twists. He has also written several mystery plays and some non-series novels, of which &quot;A Shock to the System&quot; (1984) is probably best known because the filmed version starred Michael Caine as the business executive who takes revenge after being passed over for promotion. 
In 2014, Brett was chosen as the recipient of the Cartier Diamond Dagger from the Crime Writers&#x27; Association for &quot;an outstanding body of work in crime fiction&quot;.

<doc id="148078" wikidata="Q1017055" url="?curid=148078" title="Colorburst">
<text>Colorburst is an analog and composite video signal generated by a video-signal generator used to keep the chrominance subcarrier synchronized in a color television signal. By synchronizing an oscillator with the colorburst at the back porch (beginning) of each scan line, a television receiver is able to restore the suppressed carrier of the chrominance (color) signals, and in turn decode the color information. The most common use of colorburst is to genlock equipment together as a common reference with a vision mixer in a television studio using a multi-camera setup.

== Explanation ==

In NTSC, its frequency is exactly 315/88 = 3.579 MHz with a phase of 180°. PAL uses a frequency of exactly 4.43361875 MHz, with its phase alternating between 135° and 225° from line to line. Since the colorburst signal has a known amplitude, it is sometimes used as a reference level when compensating for amplitude variations in the overall signal.

SECAM is unique in not having a colorburst signal, since the chrominance signals are encoded using FM rather than QAM, thus the signal phase is immaterial and no reference point is needed.

== Rationale for NTSC Color burst frequency ==
The original black and white NTSC television standard specified a frame rate of 30 Hz and 525 lines per frame, or 15750 lines per second. The audio was frequency modulated 4.5 MHz above the video signal. Because this was black and white, the video consisted only of luminance (brightness) information. Although all of the space in between was occupied, the line-based nature of the video information meant that the luminance data was not spread uniformly across the frequency domain; it was concentrated at multiples of the line rate. Plotting the video signal on a spectrogram gave a signature that looked like the teeth of a comb or a gear, rather than smooth and uniform.

RCA discovered that if the chrominance (color) information, which had a similar spectrum, was modulated on a carrier that was a half-integer multiple of the line rate, its signal peaks would fit neatly between the peaks of the luminance data and interference was minimized. It was not eliminated, but what remained was not readily apparent to human eyes. (Modern televisions attempt to reduce this interference further using a comb filter.)

To provide sufficient bandwidth for the chrominance signal, yet interfere only with the highest-frequency (and thus least perceptible) portions of the luminance signal, a chrominance subcarrier near 3.6 MHz was desirable. 227.5 = 455/2 times the line rate was close to the right number, and 455&#x27;s small factors (5 × 7 × 13) make a divider easy to construct.

However, additional interference could come from the audio signal. To minimize interference there, it was similarly desirable to make the distance between the chrominance carrier frequency and the audio carrier frequency a half-integer multiple of the line rate. The sum of these two half-integers implies that the distance between the frequency of the luminance carrier and audio carrier must be an integer multiple of the line rate. However, the original NTSC standard, with a 4.5 MHz carrier spacing and a 15750 Hz line rate, did not meet this requirement: the audio was 285.714 times the line rate.

While existing black and white receivers could not decode a signal with a different audio carrier frequency, they could easily use the copious timing information in the video signal to decode a slightly slower line rate. Thus, the new color television standard reduced the line rate by a factor of 1.001 to 1/286 of the 4.5 MHz audio subcarrier frequency, or about 15734.2657 Hz. This reduced the frame rate to 30/1.001 ≈ 29.9700 Hz, and placed the color subcarrier at 227.5/286 = 455/572 = 35/44 of the 4.5 MHz audio subcarrier.

== Crystals ==

An NTSC or PAL television&#x27;s color decoder contains a colorburst crystal oscillator.

Because so many analog color TVs were produced from the 1960s to the early 2000s, economies of scale drove down the cost of colorburst crystals, so they were often used in various other applications, such as oscillators for microprocessors or for amateur radio: 3.5795 MHz has since become a common QRP calling frequency in the 80-meter band, and its doubled frequency of 7.159 MHz is a common calling frequency in the 40-meter band. Tripling this frequency is also how FM radio circuits came to use a nominally 10.7 MHz intermediate frequency in superheterodyne conversion.

<text>James Middleton Cox (born James Monroe Cox; March 31, 1870 July 15, 1957) was an American businessman and politician who served as the 46th and 48th governor of Ohio, and a two-term U.S. Representative from Ohio. As the Democratic nominee for President of the United States at the 1920 presidential election, he lost in a landslide to fellow Ohioan Warren G. Harding. His running mate was future president Franklin D. Roosevelt. He founded the chain of newspapers that continues today as Cox Enterprises, a media conglomerate.

Born and raised in Ohio, Cox began his career as a newspaper copy reader before becoming an assistant to Congressman Paul J. Sorg. As owner of the &quot;Dayton Daily News&quot;, Cox introduced several innovations and crusaded against the local Republican Party boss. He served in the United States House of Representatives from 1909 to 1913 before being elected as Governor of Ohio. As governor, Cox introduced a series of progressive reforms and supported Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s handling of World War I and its aftermath.

He was chosen as the Democratic nominee for president on the forty-fourth ballot of the 1920 Democratic National Convention. Running on a ticket with future President Franklin D. Roosevelt as his vice presidential running mate, Cox suffered the worst popular vote defeat (a 26.17% margin) since the unopposed re-election of James Monroe in 1820.

Cox retired from public office after the 1920 presidential election to focus on his media conglomerate, which expanded into several cities. By 1939, his media empire extended from Dayton to Miami. He remained active in politics, supporting Roosevelt&#x27;s campaigns and attending the 1933 London Economic Conference.

==Early life and career==
Cox was born on a farm near the tiny Butler County, Ohio, in the village of Jacksonburg, he was the youngest son of Gilbert Cox and Eliza (née Andrew); he had six siblings. Cox was named James Monroe Cox at birth; he was later known as James Middleton Cox, possibly because he spent part of his early years in Middletown, Ohio. Cox was educated in a one-room school until the age sixteen. After his parents divorced, he moved with his mother in 1886 to Middletown, where he started a journalistic apprenticeship at the &quot;Middletown Weekly Signal&quot; published by John Q. Baker.

In 1892 Cox received a job at the &quot;Cincinnati Enquirer&quot; as a copy reader on the telegraph desk, and later started to report on spot news including the railroad news. In 1894, Cox became an assistant to Middletown businessman Paul J. Sorg who was elected to U.S. Congress, and spent three formative years in Washington, D.C. Sorg helped Cox to acquire the struggling &quot;Dayton Evening News&quot;, and Cox, after renaming it into the &quot;Dayton Daily News&quot;, turned it by 1900 into a successful afternoon newspaper outperforming competing ventures. He refocused local news, increased national, international and sports news coverage based on Associated Press wire service, published timely market quotes with stock-exchange, grain and livestock tables, and introduced several innovations including photo-journalistic approach to news coverage, suburban columns, book serializations and McClure&#x27;s Saturday magazine supplement inserts, among others. Cox started a crusade against Dayton&#x27;s Republican boss, Joseph E. Lowes, who used his political clout to profit from government deals. He also confronted John H. Patterson, president of Dayton&#x27;s National Cash Register Co., revealing facts of antitrust violations and bribery. In 1905, foretelling his future media conglomerate, Cox acquired the &quot;Springfield Press-Republic&quot; published in Springfield, Ohio, and renamed it, the &quot;Springfield Daily News&quot;.

===Congress===
In 1908, he ran for Congress as a Democrat and was elected. Cox represented Ohio in the United States House of Representatives for two terms from 1909 to 1913, and resigned after winning election as Governor of Ohio.

== Governor of Ohio ==
Cox won the 1912 election for Governor of Ohio, in a three-way race gaining 41.5% of the vote. Cox served three terms; after winning the 1912 election, he served from 1913 to 1915; he lost reelection in 1914, but won the 1916 and 1918 elections, and served from 1917 to 1921. He presided over a wide range of measures, such as laying the foundation of Ohio&#x27;s unified highway system, creating a no-fault workers&#x27; compensation system, and restricting child labor. He introduced direct primaries and municipal home rule, started educational and prison reforms, and streamlined the budget and tax processes.

During World War I, Cox encouraged voluntary cooperation between business, labor, and government bodies. In 1918, he welcomed constitutional amendments for Prohibition and women&#x27;s suffrage. Cox supported the internationalist policies of Woodrow Wilson and reluctantly supported U.S. entry into the League of Nations.

In 1919, shortly after the Great War ended, Governor Cox backed the Ake Law, introduced by H. Ross Ake, which banned the German language from being taught until the eighth grade, even in private schools. Cox claimed that teaching German was &quot;a distinct menace to Americanism, and part of a plot formed by the German government to make the school children loyal to it.&quot; Legislation restricting the teaching of foreign languages was declared unconstitutional in &quot;Meyer v. Nebraska&quot;.

==Bid for presidency==
A capable and well-liked progressive reformer, Cox was nominated for the presidency by the Democratic Party at the 1920 Democratic convention in San Francisco defeating A. Mitchell Palmer and William Gibbs McAdoo on the 44th ballot.

Cox conducted an activist campaign visiting 36 states and delivering 394 speeches mainly focusing on domestic issues, to the displeasure of the Wilsonians, who pictured the election &quot;as a referendum on the League of Nations.&quot; To fight unemployment and inflation, he suggested simultaneously lowering income and business profits taxes. He promised to introduce national collective bargaining legislation and pledged his support to the Volstead Act. Cox spoke in support of Americanization to increase the immigrant population&#x27;s loyalty to the United States.

Despite all of his efforts, Cox was defeated in the 1920 presidential election by a fellow Ohioan and newspaperman, U.S. Senator Warren G. Harding of Marion. The public had grown weary of the turmoil of the Wilson years and eagerly accepted Harding&#x27;s call for a &quot;return to normalcy.&quot; Cox&#x27;s running mate was future president, then-Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt. One of the better-known analyses of the 1920 election is in Irving Stone&#x27;s book about defeated presidential candidates, &quot;They Also Ran.&quot; Stone rated Cox as superior in every way over Harding and claimed that Cox would have made a much better president. Stone argued that there was never a stronger case in the history of American presidential elections for the proposition that the better man lost. Of the four men on both tickets, all but Cox would ultimately become president: Harding won and was succeeded by his running mate, Calvin Coolidge, after Harding died in office, and Roosevelt would be elected president in 1932. Cox would, however, outlive all three men by several years.
During the campaign, Cox recorded several times for &quot;The Nation&#x27;s Forum&quot;, a record label that made voice recordings of American political and civic leaders in 1918–1920. Among them was the campaign speech now preserved at the Library of Congress that accused the Republicans of failing to acknowledge that Wilson&#x27;s successful prosecution of the Great War had, according to Cox, &quot;saved civilization.&quot;

==Later years and death==
After stepping down from public service, he concentrated on building a large media conglomerate, Cox Enterprises. In 1923 he acquired the &quot;Miami Daily News&quot; and the &quot;Canton Daily News&quot;. In December 1939, he purchased the &quot;Atlanta Georgian&quot; and &quot;Journal&quot;, just a week before that city hosted the premiere of &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;. This deal included radio station WSB, which joined his previous holdings, WHIO in Dayton and WIOD in Miami, to give him, &quot;&#x27;air&#x27; from the Great Lakes on the north to Latin America on the south.&quot;

He continued to be involved in politics, and in 1932, 1936, 1940, and 1944, Cox (a supporter of the New Deal) supported and campaigned for the presidential candidacies of his former running mate Franklin D. Roosevelt, unlike the other losing Democratic presidential candidates of the time John W. Davis and Al Smith. In 1933, Cox was appointed by Roosevelt to the U.S. delegation to the failed London Economic Conference.

When he was seventy-six, Cox published his memoir, &quot;Journey through My Years&quot; (1946).

In 1915, Cox built a home near those of industrialists Charles Kettering and Edward Deeds in what later became Kettering, Ohio, where he lived for four decades. It was constructed in the classical French-Renaissance style with six bedrooms, six bathrooms, two tennis courts, a billiards room and an in-ground swimming pool. Cox named the home Trailsend.

===Death===
Cox died at Trailsend on July 15, 1957, after a series of strokes. He is interred in the Woodland Cemetery and Arboretum, Dayton, Ohio.

Cox was married twice. His first marriage to Mayme Simpson Harding lasted from 1893 to 1912, and ended in divorce. He married Margaretta Parker Blair in 1917 and she survived him. Cox had six children, three by Mayme Harding, sons James McMahon and John William and a daughter Helen Harding, a son who died in infancy, and two daughters by Margaretta Blair: Anne Cox Chambers and Barbara Cox Anthony. His son James M. Cox Jr., who took over the business after his death, was chairman of Cox Enterprises, Cox Communications, and Cox Media Group in Atlanta. His daughter Helen died in 1921 and her husband Daniel Joseph Mahoney was president of Cox Newspapers. His descendants through Chambers and Anthony, including billionaires Blair Parry-Okeden, James C. Kennedy, James Cox Chambers, Katharine Rayner and Margaretta Taylor, are major shareholders in Cox Enterprises.

==Legacy==
Cox practiced a variety of trades throughout his life, being a farmer, reporter, Congressional staff member, newspaper publisher and editor, politician, elected official and finally, a regional media magnate.

In Ohio, Cox is remembered as a crusading publisher of the &quot;Dayton Daily News&quot; and progressive governor; the newspaper&#x27;s editorial meeting room is still referred to as the &quot;Governor&#x27;s Library&quot;. The James M. Cox Dayton International Airport, more commonly referenced simply as &quot;Dayton International Airport&quot;, was named for Cox as well.

Cox is credited with words, &quot;If there is anything in the theory of reincarnation of the soul then in my next assignment, if I be given the right of choice, I will ask for the aroma of printers ink.&quot;

The Cox Fine Arts Building at the Ohio Expo Center and State Fair in Columbus, Ohio, is named in honor of Cox.

<text>Downieville is a census-designated place in and the county seat of Sierra County, California, United States. Downieville is on the North Fork of the Yuba River, at an elevation of . The 2020 United States census reported Downieville&#x27;s population was 290.

==History==

Gold was discovered here by Francis Anderson on September 14, 1849. Anderson had joined Phil A. Haven that same year along the North Yuba River.

Downieville was founded in late 1849 during the California Gold Rush, in the Northern Mines area. It was first known as &quot;The Forks&quot; for its geographical location at the confluence of the Downie River and North Fork of the Yuba River.

It was soon renamed after Major William Downie (1820–1893), the town&#x27;s founder. Downie was a Scotsman who had led an expedition of nine miners, seven of them African American men, up the North Fork of the Yuba River in the Autumn of 1849. At the present site of the town they struck rich gold, built a log cabin, and settled in to wait out the winter. By 1850, Downieville had 15 hotels, 4 bakeries, 4 butcher shops, and numerous saloons.
In 1850 John Craycroft &amp; Company constructed a log building, which had a 70 foot bar made from a rip-sawed board. The building was destroyed by fire on February 19, 1852, and was rebuilt by the current brick building that now houses the St. Charles Place in the old Craycroft building.

Josefa Segovia, a young &quot;Californio&quot; resident of the town, was lynched by a mob on July 5, 1851. The lynch mob held a mock trial, and accused her of killing an American miner. The mock trial quickly led to hanging her from the Jersey Bridge in town. Segovia was the first and only hanging of a woman in the history of California.

In 1853 Downieville was vying to become the new state capital of California, along with fifteen other California communities to replace Vallejo. The capital was moved to Benicia for a year, and then in 1854 to Sacramento.

The Northern Mines area of the gold rush had a number of mining camps with colorful names, such as Brandy City (originally known as Strychnine City), Whiskey Diggins, Poverty Hill, Poker Flat, and Camptonville. Many of these camps disappeared after the gold rush or became ghost towns. Downieville had reached a peak population of over 5,000 people in 1851, but by 1865 had significantly declined. It survived due to its status as the county seat of government in Sierra County, and from its geographic location between Sacramento Valley and Tahoe region/Nevada destinations.

<text>The Somali cat is genetically similar to the Abyssinian cat. Due to inheriting 2 copies of the recessive gene for long hair, they have a characteristic luscious coat, unlike their cousin the Abyssinian.

== History ==
In the 1940s, a British breeder named Janet Robertson exported some Abyssinian kittens to Australia, New Zealand and North America. Descendants of these cats occasionally produced kittens with long or fuzzy coats. In 1963, Mary Mailing, a breeder from Canada, entered one into a local pet show. Ken McGill, the show&#x27;s judge, asked for one for breeding purposes.

The first known long-haired Abyssinian, named &#x27;Raby Chuffa of Selene&#x27;, appeared in North America in 1953. Breeders assume that the long-haired gene was passed down through his ancestry. Most breeders were appalled by the sudden difference in appearance in their litters and refused to mention them. However, some breeders were intrigued and continued to breed the long-haired Abyssinian. At first, other Abyssinian breeders looked down upon the new development of the Somali and refused to associate them with the Abyssinian. They worked hard to keep the long-haired gene out of their own cats.

An American Abyssinian breeder Evelyn Mague also received longhairs from her cats, which she named &quot;Somalis&quot;. Mague put out a call for other cats to breed with her own long-haired Abyssinians and found the many other breeders internationally that had been breeding long-haired Abyssinians for several years already. Don Richings, another Canadian breeder, used kittens from McGill, and began to work with Mague. The first Somali recognized as such by a fancier organization was Mayling Tutsuta, one of McGill&#x27;s cats. In 1979, the breed was recognized by the CFA in North America. The new breed was accepted in Europe in 1982. By 1991, the breed was broadly (though not universally) accepted internationally.

The name &quot;Somali&quot; is in reference to the African nation, Somalia. Somalia borders Abyssinia, which is modern day Ethiopia. The name of the breed is a unique interpretation of the Ethiopian-Somali conflict; Mague charitably assumed that since the land borders were a human creation, so are the genetic borders between the Abyssinian cat and the long-haired Abyssinian.

Mague also founded the Somali Cat Club of America, which included members from Canada as well. The SCCA worked to grant the breed championship status by the CFA, which occurred in 1979. In 1975, the CFA founded the International Somali Cat Club.

== Appearance ==

=== Description ===
Somalis are recognised for their energetic and social nature. Their appearance with sleek bodies, long tails, and large pointed ears have earned them the nickname of &quot;Fox Cat.&quot; Their ticked coats contain between four and twenty colours on each hair are very fine in texture making their coats softer to the touch than those of other cat breeds. The cat itself is medium-large in size. Within the GCCF, short haired Somalis are recognised separately from Abyssinian cats.

=== Colours and patterns ===
All Somali cats have a ticked tabby pattern. The usual or ruddy coloured Somali has a golden brown ground colour ticked with black, so the official genetic term is black ticked tabby. The coat colour names in Somalis refer to the ticking colour. There are 28 colours of Somali in total although certain organisations accept only some of these colours. All organisations that register Somalis permit usual (genetically black, a.k.a. ruddy or tawny in Somalis), blue, sorrel (genetically cinnamon, a.k.a. red in Somalis), and fawn. Most clubs also recognise usual/ruddy silver, blue silver, sorrel/red silver, and fawn silver. Other colours that may be accepted by some registries include chocolate, lilac, red, cream, usual-tortie, blue-tortie, sorrel-tortie, fawn-tortie, chocolate-tortie, lilac-tortie, and silver variants of these (e.g. blue-tortie silver).

== Health ==
The Somali is one of the more commonly affected breeds for pyruvate kinase deficiency. An autosomal recessive mutation of the PKLR gene is responsible for the condition in the breed.

Somalis may also have hereditary retinal degeneration due to a mutation in the rdAc allele. This mutation is also seen in Abyssinians, Siamese cats, and other related breeds.

<text>Installation art is an artistic genre of three-dimensional works that are often site-specific and designed to transform the perception of a space. Generally, the term is applied to interior spaces, whereas exterior interventions are often called public art, land art or art intervention; however, the boundaries between these terms overlap.

==History==

Installation art can be either temporary or permanent. Installation artworks have been constructed in exhibition spaces such as museums and galleries, as well as public and private spaces. The genre incorporates a broad range of everyday and natural materials, which are often chosen for their &quot;evocative&quot; qualities, as well as new media such as video, sound, performance, immersive virtual reality and the internet. Many installations are site-specific in that they are designed to exist only in the space for which they were created, appealing to qualities evident in a three-dimensional immersive medium. Artistic collectives such as the Exhibition Lab at New York&#x27;s American Museum of Natural History created environments to showcase the natural world in as realistic a medium as possible. Likewise, Walt Disney Imagineering employed a similar philosophy when designing the multiple immersive spaces for Disneyland in 1955. Since its acceptance as a separate discipline, a number of institutions focusing on Installation art were created. These included the Mattress Factory, Pittsburgh, the Museum of Installation in London, and the Fairy Doors of Ann Arbor, MI, among others.

Installation art came to prominence in the 1970s but its roots can be identified in earlier artists such as Marcel Duchamp and his use of the readymade and Kurt Schwitters&#x27; &quot;Merz&quot; art objects, rather than more traditional craft based sculpture. The &quot;intention&quot; of the artist is paramount in much later installation art whose roots lie in the conceptual art of the 1960s. This again is a departure from traditional sculpture which places its focus on form. Early non-Western installation art includes events staged by the Gutai group in Japan starting in 1954, which influenced American installation pioneers like Allan Kaprow.
Wolf Vostell shows his installation &quot;6 TV Dé-coll/age&quot; in 1963 at the Smolin Gallery in New York.

==Installation==

&quot;Installation&quot; as nomenclature for a specific form of art came into use fairly recently; its first use as documented by the Oxford English Dictionary was in 1969. It was coined in this context, in reference to a form of art that had arguably existed since prehistory but was not regarded as a discrete category until the mid-twentieth century. Allan Kaprow used the term &quot;Environment&quot; in 1958 (Kaprow 6) to describe his transformed indoor spaces; this later joined such terms as &quot;project art&quot; and &quot;temporary art.&quot;

Essentially, installation/environmental art takes into account a broader sensory experience, rather than floating framed points of focus on a &quot;neutral&quot; wall or displaying isolated objects (literally) on a pedestal. This may leave space and time as its only dimensional constants, implying dissolution of the line between &quot;art&quot; and &quot;life&quot;; Kaprow noted that &quot;if we bypass &#x27;art&#x27; and take nature itself as a model or point of departure, we may be able to devise a different kind of art... out of the sensory stuff of ordinary life&quot;.

==Gesamtkunstwerk==
The conscious act of artistically addressing all the senses with regard to a total experience made a resounding debut in 1849 when Richard Wagner conceived of a &quot;Gesamtkunstwerk&quot;, or an operatic work for the stage that drew inspiration from ancient Greek theater in its inclusion of all the major art forms: painting, writing, music, etc. (Britannica). In devising operatic works to commandeer the audience&#x27;s senses, Wagner left nothing unobserved: architecture, ambience, and even the audience itself were considered and manipulated in order to achieve a state of total artistic immersion. In the book &quot;Themes in Contemporary Art&quot;, it is suggested that &quot;installations in the 1980s and 1990s were increasingly characterized by networks of operations involving the interaction among complex architectural settings, environmental sites and extensive use of everyday objects in ordinary contexts. With the advent of video in 1965, a concurrent strand of installation evolved through the use of new and ever-changing technologies, and what had been simple video installations expanded to include complex interactive, multimedia and virtual reality environments&quot;.

==Art and Objecthood==

In &quot;Art and Objecthood&quot;, Michael Fried derisively labels art that acknowledges the viewer as &quot;theatrical&quot; (Fried 45). There is a strong parallel between installation and theater: both play to a viewer who is expected to be at once immersed in the sensory/narrative experience that surrounds him and maintain a degree of self-identity as a viewer. The traditional theater-goer does not forget that they have come in from outside to sit and take in a created experience; a trademark of installation art has been the curious and eager viewer, still aware that they are in an exhibition setting and tentatively exploring the novel universe of the installation.

The artist and critic Ilya Kabakov mentions this essential phenomenon in the introduction to his lectures &quot;On the &quot;Total&quot; Installation&quot;: &quot;[One] is simultaneously both a &#x27;victim&#x27; and a viewer, who on the one hand surveys and evaluates the installation, and on the other, follows those associations, recollections which arise in him[;] he is overcome by the intense atmosphere of the total illusion&quot;. Here installation art bestows an unprecedented importance on the observer&#x27;s inclusion in that which he observes. The expectations and social habits that the viewer brings with him into the space of the installation will remain with him as he enters, to be either applied or negated once he has taken in the new environment. What is common to nearly all installation art is a consideration of the experience in toto and the problems it may present, namely the constant conflict between disinterested criticism and sympathetic involvement. Television and video offer somewhat immersive experiences, but their unrelenting control over the rhythm of passing time and the arrangement of images precludes an intimately personal viewing experience. Ultimately, the only things a viewer can be assured of when experiencing the work are his own thoughts and preconceptions and the basic rules of space and time. All else may be molded by the artist&#x27;s hands.

The central importance of the subjective point of view when experiencing installation art, points toward a disregard for traditional Platonic image theory. In effect, the entire installation adopts the character of the simulacrum or flawed statue: it neglects any ideal form in favor of optimizing its direct appearance to the observer. Installation art operates fully within the realm of sensory perception, in a sense &quot;installing&quot; the viewer into an artificial system with an appeal to his subjective perception as its ultimate goal.

==Interactive installations==
An interactive installation frequently involves the audience acting on the work of art or the piece responding to users&#x27; activity. There are several kinds of interactive installations that artists produce, these include web-based installations (e.g., Telegarden), gallery-based installations, digital-based installations, electronic-based installations, mobile-based installations, etc. Interactive installations appeared mostly at end of the 1980s (&quot;Legible City&quot; by Jeffrey Shaw, &quot;La plume&quot; by Edmond Couchot, Michel Bret...) and became a genre during the 1990s, when artists became particularly interested in using the participation of the audiences to activate and reveal the meaning of the installation. 

==Immersive virtual reality==

With the improvement of technology over the years, artists are more able to explore outside of the boundaries that were never able to be explored by artists in the past. The media used are more experimental and bold; they are also usually cross media and may involve sensors, which plays on the reaction to the audiences&#x27; movement when looking at the installations. By using virtual reality as a medium, immersive virtual reality art is probably the most deeply interactive form of art. By allowing the spectator to &quot;visit&quot; the representation, the artist creates &quot;situations to live&quot; vs &quot;spectacle to watch&quot;.

<text>Body art is art in which the artist uses their human body as the primary medium. Emerging from the context of Conceptual Art during the 1970s, Body art may include performance art. Body art is likewise utilized for investigations of the body in an assortment of different media including painting, casting, photography, film and video. More extreme body art can involve mutilation or pushing the body to its physical limits.

In more recent times, the body has become a subject of much broader discussion and treatment than can be reduced to body art in its common understanding. Important strategies that question the human body are: implants, body in symbiosis with the new technologies, virtual avatar bodies, among others.

Body art has been expanded into the popular culture and now covers a wide spectrum of usage, including tattoos, body piercings, scarification, and body painting. 
Photographer Spencer Tunick is well known for conducting photo shoots which gather large numbers of naked people at public locations around the world.

==Background==
Body art often deals with issues of gender and personal identity and common topics include the relationship between body and psyche.

The Vienna Action Group was formed in 1965 by Hermann Nitsch, Otto Mühl, Günter Brus, and Rudolf Schwarzkogler. They performed several body art actions. In the United States Carolee Schneemann, Chris Burden and Vito Acconci were very active participants. Acconci once documented, through photos and text, his daily exercise routine of stepping on and off a chair for as long as possible over several months. Acconci also performed &quot;Following Piece&quot;, in which he followed randomly chosen New Yorkers.

In France, body art was termed &quot;art corporel&quot; and practiced by such artists as Michel Journiac, Orlan and Gina Pane while in Italy in the 1980s, one of the famous artists in the movement was Ketty La Rocca.

Marina Abramović performed &quot;Rhythm 0&quot; in 1974. In the piece, the audience was given instructions to use on Abramović&#x27;s body an array of 72 provided instruments of pain and pleasure, including knives, feathers, and a loaded pistol. Audience members cut her, pressed thorns into her belly, applied lipstick to her, removed her clothes, and held a loaded pistol to her head. Accounts vary as to how the performance concluded, some stating it ended after a scuffle broke out in the audience over their conduct, while Abramović retells that the artwork simply came to an end after the intended six hours, at which time she stood and walked towards the audience, which fled.

Artists whose works have evolved with more directed personal mythologies include Rebecca Horn, Youri Messen-Jaschin, Javier Perez, and Jana Sterbak. 
Body art can also be expressed via writing rather than painting.

==Extreme body art==
For example, one of Marina Abramović&#x27;s works involved dancing until she collapsed from exhaustion, while one of Dennis Oppenheim&#x27;s better-known works saw him lying in the sunlight with a book on his chest, until his skin, excluding that covered by the book, was badly sunburned. It can even consist of the arrangement and dissection of preserved bodies in an artistic fashion, as was for the plastinated bodies used in the travelling Body Worlds exhibition.

===&quot;Absence&quot; of body===
Scientific research in this area, for example that by Stelarc, can be considered in this artistic vein. A special case of the body art strategies is the absence of body. Some artists who performed the &quot;absence&quot; of body through their artworks were: Davor Džalto, Antony Gormley, and Andy Warhol.

==Body art events==
Burning Man festival is held annually in the Black Rock Desert of northwest Nevada (US), in September. 
Jake Lloyd Jones, a Sydney-based artist, conceived the Sydney Body Art Ride, which has become an annual event. Participants are painted to form a living rainbow that rides to the Pacific Ocean and immerses itself in the waves.

== Medical uses for body art ==
Body art, specifically painting on the body is a newly incorporated skill in the medical industry primarily used for schooling. While the primary method for learning bodily physiology is through examining cadavers according to Gabrielle Flinn, some students are very off put by this practice. Organizations are now considering using body painting as a functional, low-cost, and positive way of learning about the inner-workings of anatomical structures through painting. This would consist of medical students painting on, or working with, willing volunteers who have been painted on to expose various body parts such as: lungs, muscles in hands, legs, etc. Hands are the most typically chosen as the patient does not have to undress for the painting examination, however, with consent of the volunteer patient, medical students could paint other areas such as the back. This would allow the medical students to not only learn more about anatomy in a positive manner but also have real life practice in bedside manners, and making sure their patients are comfortable, and well taken care of through the entire process.

<doc id="148105" wikidata="Q570784" url="?curid=148105" title="Scarification">
<text>Scarification involves scratching, etching, burning/branding, or superficially cutting designs, pictures, or words into the skin as a permanent body modification or body art. The body modification can take roughly 6–12 months to heal. In the process of body scarification, scars are purposely formed by cutting or branding the skin by various methods (sometimes using further sequential aggravating wound-healing methods at timed intervals, like irritation). Scarification is sometimes called &quot;cicatrization&quot; (from the French equivalent).

==History==
Scarification has been traditionally practiced by darker skinned cultures, possibly because it is usually more visible on darker skinned people than tattoos. It was common in indigenous cultures of Africa (especially in the west), Melanesia, and Australia. Some indigenous cultures in North America also practiced scarification, including the ancient Maya.

===Africa===

In Africa, European colonial governments and European Christian missionaries criminalized and stigmatized the cultural practices of tattooing and scarification; consequently, the practices underwent decline, ended, or continued to be performed as acts of resistance.

Among the ethnic groups in sub-Saharan Africa that traditionally practice scarification are the Gonja, Dagomba, Frafra, Mamprusi, Nanumba, Bali, Tɔfin, Bobo, Montol, Kofyar, Yoruba, and Tiv people of West Africa, and the Dinka, Nuer, Surma, Shilluk, Toposa, Moru, Bondei, Shambaa, Barabaig, and Maasai people of East Africa.

==Reasons==
Within anthropology, the study of the body as a boundary has been long debated. In 1909, Van Gennep described bodily transformations, including tattooing, scarification, and painting, as rites of passage. In 1963, Lévi-Strauss described the body as a surface waiting for the imprintation of culture. Turner (1980) first used the term &quot;social skin&quot; in his detailed discussion of how Kayapo culture was constructed and expressed through individual bodies. Inscribed skin highlights an issue that has been central to anthropology since its inception: the question of boundaries between the individual and society, between societies, and between representation and experiences.

=== Rites of passage and belonging ===
Traditionally, the most common reason for scarification has been as a rite of passage.

Scarification has been widely used by many West African tribes to mark milestone stages in both men and women&#x27;s lives, such as puberty and marriage. In many tribes, members unwilling to participate in scarification were generally not included in the group&#x27;s activities, and are often shunned from their society. According to anthropologist Grace Harris, group members lacking the normal characteristics consistent with the group are not considered as having acquired the full standing as agents in their society; they would also lack the capacity for meaningful behavior, such as greeting, commanding, and Therefore, scarification can transform partial tribe members into &quot;normal&quot; members entirely accepted by the group. Scarification is a form of language not readily expressed, except through extensive and intricate greetings, and gives the ability to communicate fully, which is a key element for being considered as a normal member of the group.

One reason why scarification is used as confirmation of adulthood is how it shows the ability to endure pain. With young men, the endurance of the pain of scarring exhibits strength and discipline, especially in tribes where males have roles as hunters and warriors. A young man who has already experienced the feeling of torn or cut flesh is considered less likely to fear the teeth of a wild animal or the tip of an enemy&#x27;s spear. In Ethiopia and Zambia, elaborate scarification is often done on women at puberty, used to denote a willingness to be a mother. The markings show that she can stand the pain of childbirth, as well as being an indication of her emotional maturity.
Some of these rites of passage have spiritual or religious roots, such young boys in the Chambri tribe of Papua New Guinea undergo scarification resembling crocodile scales to mark their transition into manhood, a ritual which stems from the belief that humans evolved from crocodiles.

In Ethiopia, Suri men scar their bodies to show that they have killed someone from an enemy tribe; the Mursi practice scarification for largely aesthetic reasons in order to attract the opposite sex and enhance the tactile experience of sex. The Ekoi of Nigeria believe that the scars serve, on their way to the afterlife, as money.

=== Identity ===
 Scarification can be used to transmit complex messages about identity; such permanent body markings may emphasize fixed social, political, and religious roles. Tattoos, scars, brands, and piercings, when voluntarily acquired, are ways of showing a person&#x27;s autobiography on the surface of the body to the world.

Scarification can also help change status from victim to survivor. These individuals pass through various kinds of ritual death and rebirth, and redefine the relationship between self and society through the skin.

Many people in certain regions of Africa who have &quot;markings&quot; can be identified as belonging to a specific tribe or ethnic group. Some of the tribes in Northern Ghana who use the markings are the Gonjas, Nanumbas, Dagombas, Frafras and Mamprusis.

=== Medicinal ===
For the Nuba tribe of Sudan, scars can serve a medicinal purpose; scars above the eyes are believed to improve eyesight, and scars on the temples are believed to help relieve headaches. In some cultures, scarification is used in traditional medicine to treat some illness by inserting medicine (usually herbs or powdered root) under the skin to heal a variety of infections and illnesses such as Malaria.

==Methods==
Scarification is not a precise practice; variables, such as skin type, cut depth, and how the wound is treated while healing, can make the outcome unpredictable compared to other forms of body modification. A method that works on one person may not work on another. The scars tend to spread as they heal, so final designs are usually simple, the details being lost during healing.Some common scarification techniques include:

;Ink rubbing: Tattoo ink (or similar agent) is rubbed into a fresh cut to add color or extra visibility to the scar. Most of the ink remains in the skin as the cut heals. This was how tattoos were initially done before the use of needles to inject ink.
;Skin removal/skinning: Skin removal allows for larger markings than simple cutting. The skin is raised with a hook and removed with a razor blade. This process can take many hours, and often requires repeated removal of scabs for best visibility of the scars.
;Packing: An inert material such as clay or ash is packed into the wound; massive hypertrophic scars are formed during healing as the wound pushes out the substance that had been inserted into the wound. Inflammatory substances can be used to improve keloid formation.

==Dangers==
Scarification produces harm and trauma to the skin. Infection is common when tools are not sterilised properly. Scarification has been linked to the spread of HIV/AIDS and Hepatitis C when tools are shared between people. Body modification artists may have less experience with scarification, perhaps due to lower demand. When not desired, keloid scars may be an additional complication, although there are emerging treatment strategies for keloid scars.

<doc id="148108" wikidata="Q7202105" url="?curid=148108" title="Plastic in art">
<text>Within the 20th century, there came the use of plastics in art. In the latter half of the century, plastic technology advanced so that it was feasible for artists to start using plastic and acrylics as an artwork medium.

== Using found plastic ==

Art made of commodity materials sometimes uses found objects made of plastic. Plastic containers are useful in papier-mâché for building frames.

Environmental artists are using salvaged beach plastic to create art as a means of bringing awareness of plastic pollution in Earth&#x27;s oceans. Examples include: Judith Selby Lang and Richard Lang, members of Women Eco Artists Dialog, and the photography of Chris Jordan.

==Use of liquid acrylics==
Liquid acrylics can be used to create two- and three-dimensional plastic images and objects. Artist, Tyler Turkle, pours multiple thin layers of pigmented liquid acrylic to form sheets of plastic that result in paintings and sculptures. After adequate drying time between applications, these solid plastic sheets can be readily peeled off most surfaces and re-adhered to others.

<text>Digital art refers to any artistic work or practice that uses digital technology as part of the creative or presentation process. It can also refer to computational art that uses and engages with digital media. Since the 1960s, various names have been used to describe digital art, including computer art, electronic art, multimedia art, and new media art.

Subcategories for the art include digital painting, where artists use software to emulate techniques using in physical painting, digital illustration, which involves creating rendered images for other media, and 3D modeling, where artists craft three-dimensional objects and scenes. Pieces of digital art range from captured in unique displays and restricted from duplication to popular memes available for reproduction in commercial products. 

Repositories for digital art include pieces stored on physical media, galleries on display on websites, and collections for download for free or purchase. 

== History ==
In the early 1960s, John Whitney developed the first computer-generated art using mathematical operations. In 1963, Ivan Sutherland invented the first user interactive computer-graphics interface known as Sketchpad.
Between 1974 and 1977, Salvador Dalí created two big canvases of &quot;Gala Contemplating the Mediterranean Sea which at a distance of 20 meters is transformed into the portrait of Abraham Lincoln (Homage to Rothko)&quot; and prints of &quot;Lincoln in Dalivision&quot; based on a portrait of Abraham Lincoln processed on a computer by Leon Harmon published in &quot;The Recognition of Faces&quot;.
The technique is similar to what later became known as photographic mosaics.

Andy Warhol created digital art using an Amiga where the computer was publicly introduced at the Lincoln Center, New York, in July 1985. An image of Debbie Harry was captured in monochrome from a video camera and digitized into a graphics program called ProPaint. Warhol manipulated the image by adding color using flood fills.

== Art that uses digital tools ==

Digital art can be purely computer-generated (such as fractals and algorithmic art) or taken from other sources, such as a scanned photograph or an image drawn using vector graphics software using a mouse or graphics tablet. Artworks are considered digital paintings when created similarly to non-digital paintings but using software on a computer platform and digitally outputting the resulting image as painted on canvas.

Despite differing viewpoints on digital technology&#x27;s impact on the arts, a consensus exists within the digital art community about its significant contribution to expanding the creative domain, i.e., that it has greatly broadened the creative opportunities available to professional and non-professional artists alike.

=== Computer-generated visual media ===

Digital visual art consists of either 2D visual information displayed on an electronic visual display or information mathematically translated into 3D information viewed through perspective projection on an electronic visual display. The simplest form, 2D computer graphics, reflects how one might draw with a pencil or paper. In this case, however, the image is on the computer screen, and the instrument you draw with might be a tablet stylus or a mouse. What is generated on your screen might appear to be drawn with a pencil, pen, or paintbrush. The second kind is 3D computer graphics, where the screen becomes a window into a virtual environment, where you arrange objects to be &quot;photographed&quot; by the computer.
Typically 2D computer graphics use raster graphics as their primary means of source data representations, whereas 3D computer graphics use vector graphics in the creation of immersive virtual reality installations. A possible third paradigm is to generate art in 2D or 3D entirely through the execution of algorithms coded into computer programs. This can be considered the native art form of the computer, and an introduction to the history of which is available in an interview with computer art pioneer Frieder Nake. Fractal art, Datamoshing, algorithmic art, and real-time generative art are examples.

=== Computer-generated 3D still imagery ===

3D graphics are created via the process of designing imagery from geometric shapes, polygons, or NURBS curves to create three-dimensional objects and scenes for use in various media such as film, television, print, rapid prototyping, games/simulations, and special visual effects.

There are many software programs for doing this. The technology can enable collaboration, lending itself to sharing and augmenting by a creative effort similar to the open source movement and the creative commons in which users can collaborate on a project to create art.

Pop surrealist artist Ray Caesar works in Maya (a 3D modeling software used for digital animation), using it to create his figures as well as the virtual realms in which they exist.

=== Computer-generated animated imagery ===
Computer-generated animations are animations created with a computer from digital models created by 3D artists or procedurally generated. The term is usually applied to works created entirely with a computer. Movies make heavy use of computer-generated graphics; they are called computer-generated imagery (CGI) in the film industry. In the 1990s and early 2000s, CGI advanced enough that, for the first time, it was possible to create realistic 3D computer animation, although films had been using extensive computer images since the mid-70s. A number of modern films have been noted for their heavy use of photo-realistic CGI.

=== Digital painting ===
Digital painting mainly refers to the process of creating paintings on computer software based on computers or graphic tables. Through pixel simulation, digital brushes in digital software (see the software in Digital painting) can imitate traditional painting paints and tools, such as oil, acrylic acid, pastel, charcoal, and airbrush. Users of the software can also customize the pixel size to achieve a unique visual effect (customized brushes).

=== Artificial intelligence art ===
Artists have used artificial intelligence to create artwork since at least the 1960s. Since their design in 2014, some artists have created artwork using a generative adversarial network (GAN), which is a machine learning framework that allows two &quot;algorithms&quot; to compete with each other and iterate. It can be used to generate pictures that have visual effects similar to traditional fine art. The essential idea of image generators is that people can use text descriptions to let AI convert their text into visual picture content. Anyone can turn their language into a painting through a picture generator. 

==== Generation Process ====
Generally, the user can set the input, and the input content includes detailed picture content that the user wants. For example, the content can be a scene&#x27;s content, characters, weather, character relationships, specific items, etc. It can also include selecting a specific artist style, screen style, image pixel size, brightness, etc. Then picture generators will return several similar pictures generated according to the input (generally, 4 pictures are given now). After receiving the results generated by picture generators, the user can select one picture as a result he wants or let the generator redraw and return to new pictures.

==== Awards and recognition ====
In both 1991 and 1992, Karl Sims won the Golden Nica award at Prix Ars Electronica for his 3D AI animated videos using artificial evolution. In 2009, Eric Millikin won the Pulitzer Prize along with several other awards for his artificial intelligence art that was critical of government corruption in Detroit and resulted in the city&#x27;s mayor being sent to jail. In 2018 Christie&#x27;s auction house in New York sold an artificial intelligence work, &quot;Edmond de Bellamy&quot; for US$432,500. It was created by a collective in Paris named &quot;Obvious&quot;.

In 2019, Stephanie Dinkins won the Creative Capital award for her creation of an evolving artificial intelligence based on the &quot;interests and culture(s) of people of color.&quot; In 2022, an amateur artist using Midjourney won the first-place $300 prize in a digital art competition at the Colorado State Fair. Also in 2022, Refik Anadol created an artificial intelligence art installation at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, based on the museum&#x27;s own collection.

==List of digital art software==


===List of 2D digital art repositories===
Repositories for 2D and vector digital art offer pieces for download, either individually or in bulk. Proprietary repositories require a purchase to license or use any image, while those operating under freemium models like Flaticon, Vecteezy, etc., provide some images for free and others for fee based on tiers.
== Art made for digital media ==
In contemporary art, the term digital art is used primarily to describe visual art that is made with digital tools, and also is highly computational, and explicitly engages with digital technologies. Art historian Christiane Paul writes that it &quot;is highly problematic to classify all art that makes use of digital technologies somewhere in its production and dissemination process as digital art since it makes it almost impossible to arrive at any unifying statement about the art form.

=== Computer demos ===
Computer demos are computer programs, usually non-interactive, that produce audiovisual presentations. They are a novel form of art, which emerged as a consequence of home computer revolution in the early 1980s. In the classification of digital art, they can be best described as real-time procedurally generated animated audio-visuals.

This form of art does not concentrate only on aesthetics of the final presentation, but also on complexities and skills involved in creating the presentation. As such, it can be fully enjoyed only by persons with a high level of knowledge in the field of accompanying computer technologies. On the other hand, many of the created pieces of art are primarily aesthetic or amusing, and those can be enjoyed by general public.

=== Digital installation art ===

Digital installation art constitutes a broad field of activity and incorporates many forms. Some resemble video installations, particularly large-scale works involving projections and live video capture. By using projection techniques that enhance an audience&#x27;s impression of sensory envelopment, many digital installations attempt to create immersive environments. Others go even further and attempt to facilitate a complete immersion in virtual realms. This type of installation is generally site-specific, scalable, and without fixed dimensionality, meaning it can be reconfigured to accommodate different presentation spaces.

Noah Wardrip-Fruin&#x27;s &quot;Screen&quot; (2003) is an example of interactive digital installation art which makes use of a Cave Automatic Virtual Environment to create an interactive experience. Scott Snibbe&#x27;s &quot;Boundary Functions&quot; is an example of augmented reality digital installation art, which response to people who enter the installation by drawing lines between people, indicating their personal space.

=== Internet art and net.art ===

Internet art is digital art that uses the specific characteristics of the internet and is exhibited on the internet.

=== Digital art and blockchain ===
Blockchain, and more specifically NFTs, are associated with digital art since the NFTs craze of 2020 and 2021. Digital art is a common use case for NFTs. By minting a piece of digital art the owner of the NFT is proven to be the owner of the art piece. While the technology received many critics and has many flaws related to plagiarism and fraud (&quot;due to its almost completely unregulated nature&quot;), auction houses, museums and galleries around the world started collaborations and partnerships with digital artists, selling NFTs associated with digital artworks (&quot;via NFT platforms&quot;) and showcasing those artworks (&quot;associated to the respective NFTs&quot;) both in virtual galleries and real-life screens, monitors and TVs.

In March 2024, Sotheby&#x27;s presented an auction highlighting significant contributions of digital artists over the previous decade, one of many record-breaking auctions of digital artwork by the auction house. These auctions look broadly at the cultural impact of digital art in the 21-st century and featured work by artists such as Jennifer &amp; Kevin McCoy, Vera Molnár, Claudia Hart, Jonathan Monaghan and Sarah Zucker.

==Art theorists and historians==
Notable art theorists and historians in this field include:

Oliver Grau, Jon Ippolito, Christiane Paul, Frank Popper, Jasia Reichardt, Mario Costa, Christine Buci-Glucksmann, Dominique Moulon, Robert C. Morgan, Roy Ascott, Catherine Perret, Margot Lovejoy, Edmond Couchot, Tina Rivers Ryan, Fred Forest and Edward A. Shanken.

== Scholarship and archives ==
In addition to the creation of original art, research methods that utilize AI have been generated to quantitatively analyze digital art collections. This has been made possible due to the large-scale digitization of artwork in the past few decades. Although the main goal of digitization was to allow for accessibility and exploration of these collections, the use of AI in analyzing them has brought about new research perspectives.

Two computational methods, close reading and distant viewing, are the typical approaches used to analyze digitized art. Close reading focuses on specific visual aspects of one piece. Some tasks performed by machines in close reading methods include computational artist authentication and analysis of brushstrokes or texture properties. In contrast, through distant viewing methods, the similarity across an entire collection for a specific feature can be statistically visualized. Common tasks relating to this method include automatic classification, object detection, multimodal tasks, knowledge discovery in art history, and computational aesthetics. Whereas distant viewing includes the analysis of large collections, close reading involves one piece of artwork.

Whilst 2D and 3D digital art is beneficial as it allows the preservation of history that would otherwise have been destroyed by events like natural disasters and war, there is the issue of who should own these 3D scans i.e., who should own the digital copyrights.

== Art online platforms ==
Various online platforms have become essential for digital artists to share, promote, and sell their work. These platforms provide artists with access to global audiences and foster a sense of community, democratizing the art world and shifting how art is created, consumed, and appreciated.

* DeviantArt: Launched in 2000, DeviantArt is one of the largest and oldest platforms dedicated to art sharing. It has cultivated a strong community of digital artists, offering features like portfolio building and social interaction that allow artists to showcase their work to a broad audience.
* Behance: Owned by Adobe, Behance is a platform that connects creative professionals across multiple disciplines, including digital art. Integrated with Adobe’s software suite, Behance enables artists to showcase their projects, collaborate with others, and gain exposure to clients and recruiters looking for creative talent.
* Instagram: Originally a photo-sharing app, Instagram has evolved into a platform for visual artists. Artists use it to build their personal brands, interact with followers, and reach collectors and fans directly. Its visual format and extensive user base have made it a powerful tool for artists seeking visibility online.

* Pinterest: Pinterest serves as a platform for discovering and sharing visual inspiration. Many digital artists use Pinterest to showcase their work and gather ideas for future projects. Its structure enables users to create curated boards, often influencing design and art trends within the digital community.

<text>The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) is a modern and contemporary art museum and nonprofit organization located in San Francisco, California. SFMOMA was the first museum on the West Coast devoted solely to 20th-century art, and has built an internationally recognized collection with over 33,000 works of painting, sculpture, photography, architecture, design, and media arts. The collection is displayed in of exhibition space, making the museum one of the largest in the United States overall, and one of the largest in the world for modern and contemporary art. In 2024, SFMOMA was ranked 14th in the Washington Post&#x27;s list of the best art museums in the U.S.

The museum was founded in 1935 with galleries in the Veterans Building in Civic Center. In 1995, the museum opened in its Mario Botta-designed home in the SoMa district. On May 14, 2016, following a three-year-long closure for a major expansion project by Snøhetta architects, the museum re-opened to the public with more than double the gallery space and almost six times as much public space as the previous building, allowing SFMOMA to showcase an expanding collection along with the Doris and Donald Fisher Collection of contemporary art.

==History==

SFMOMA was founded in 1935 under director Grace L. McCann Morley as the San Francisco Museum of Art. For its first sixty years, the museum rented the fourth floor of the Veterans Building on Van Ness Avenue in the Civic Center. A gift of 36 artworks from Albert M. Bender, including &quot;The Flower Carrier&quot; (1935) by Diego Rivera, established the basis of the permanent collection. Bender donated more than 1,100 objects to SFMOMA during his lifetime and endowed the museum&#x27;s first purchase fund.

The museum began its second year with an exhibition of works by Henri Matisse. Also in 1936, the museum established its photography collection, becoming one of the first museums to recognize photography as an art form. In 1940, the museum held its first architecture exhibition, &quot;Telesis: Space for Living&quot;.

The museum was obliged to move to a temporary facility on Post Street in March 1945 to make way for the United Nations Conference on International Organization; following the signing of the United Nations Charter at Herbst Theatre in the Veterans Building, the museum returned to its original location in July. Later that year, the museum presented Jackson Pollock&#x27;s first solo museum exhibition.

Founding director Grace Morley held film screenings at the museum beginning in 1937, and in 1946 brought in filmmaker Frank Stauffacher to found the Art in Cinema film series, which ran for nine years. The museum continued its expansion into new media with the 1951 launch of a biweekly television program, &quot;Art in Your Life&quot;, later renamed &quot;Discovery&quot;, which ran for three years.

Morley ended her 23-year tenure as museum director in 1958 and was succeeded by George D. Culler (1958–65) and Gerald Nordland (1966–72). In 1967, SFMOMA inaugurated the biennial SECA Art Award to honor San Francisco Bay Area artists. The museum rose to international prominence under director Henry T. Hopkins (1974–86), adding &quot;Modern&quot; to its name in 1975.

In the 1980s, under Hopkins and his successor John R. Lane (1987–1997), SFMOMA established three new curatorial posts: curator of painting and sculpture, curator of architecture and design, and curator of media arts. The positions of director of education and director of photography were elevated to full curatorial roles. At this time SFMOMA took on an active special exhibitions program, both organizing and hosting traveling exhibitions, including major presentations of the work of Jeff Koons, Sigmar Polke, and Willem de Kooning.

In 1992, Harry W. &quot;Hunk&quot; Anderson and Mary Margaret &quot;Moo&quot; Anderson &quot;transformed SFMOMA&#x27;S collection of American Pop art in one fell swoop,&quot; building on prior gifts of works by Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns with additional works dating from the early 1960s to the early 1980s, including paintings by Jim Dine, Roy Lichtenstein, James Rosenquist, Andy Warhol, and Robert Indiana, as well as a wall relief by Claes Oldenburg.

In January 1995 the museum opened its current location at 151 Third Street, adjacent to Yerba Buena Gardens in the SOMA district. Mario Botta, a Swiss architect from Canton Ticino, designed the new facility.

SFMOMA made a number of important acquisitions under the direction of David A. Ross (1998–2001), who had been recruited from the Whitney Museum in New York, including works by Ellsworth Kelly, Robert Rauschenberg, René Magritte, and Piet Mondrian, as well as Marcel Duchamp’s iconic &quot;Fountain&quot; (1917/1964). Those and acquisitions of works by Jasper Johns, Mark Rothko, Francis Bacon, Alexander Calder, Chuck Close and Frank Stella put the institution in the top ranks of American museums of modern art. After three years and $140 million building up the collection, Ross resigned when a slow economy forced the museum to keep a tighter rein on its resources.
The 2003 exhibition &quot;Treasures Of Modern Art: The Legacy Of Phyllis Wattis&quot; featured more than 80 of the many works donated by art patron Phyllis Wattis, who died in 2002, including works by Robert Rauschenberg, Piet Mondrian, René Magritte, Marcel Duchamp, Andy Warhol, and Barnett Newman.

Under director Neal Benezra, who was recruited from the Art Institute of Chicago in 2002, SFMOMA achieved an increase in both visitor numbers and membership while continuing to build its collection. In 2005 the museum announced the promised gift of nearly 800 photographs to the Prentice and Paul Sack Photographic Trust at SFMOMA from the Sacks&#x27; private collection. The museum saw record attendance in 2008 with the exhibition &quot;Frida Kahlo&quot;, which drew more than 400,000 visitors during its three-month run.

In 2009, the museum gained a custodial relationship for the contemporary art collection of Doris and Donald Fisher of Gap Inc. The Fisher Collection includes some 1,100 works from artists including Alexander Calder, Chuck Close, Willem de Kooning, Richard Diebenkorn, Anselm Kiefer, Ellsworth Kelly, Roy Lichtenstein, Brice Marden, Agnes Martin, Gerhard Richter, Richard Serra, Cy Twombly, and Andy Warhol, among many others. The collection will be on loan to SFMOMA for a period of 100 years.

In 2009, SFMOMA announced plans for a major expansion to accommodate its growing audiences, programs, and collections and to showcase the Doris and Donald Fisher collection of contemporary art. In 2010—the museum&#x27;s 75th anniversary year—architecture firm Snøhetta was selected to design a major addition. SFMOMA closed to the public and broke ground for its expansion in May 2013, re-opening three years later. During the closure, SFMOMA presented exhibitions and programs at off-site locations around the Bay Area as part of SFMOMA On the Go.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.sfmoma.org/onthego&quot;&gt;Exhibitions + Events · SFMOMA&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2011, the museum launched a Collections Campaign, announcing the acquisition of 195 works including paintings from Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg and Francis Bacon. Also under the auspices of the Collections Campaign, promised gifts of 473 photographs were announced in 2012, including 26 works by Diane Arbus and significant gifts of Japanese photography.

In July 2020, the senior curator of painting and sculpture, Gary Garrels, resigned after using the term &quot;reverse discrimination&quot; during an all-staff Zoom meeting, which caused an uproar. Looking back on the incident in 2023, and quoting Garrel&#x27;s resignation letter in full, the International Committee for Museums and Collections of Modern Art (CiMAM) 
called his resignation &quot;a radical and bewildering gesture by an advocate for diversity.&quot;

In 2022, Christopher Bedford was named director, succeeding Neal Benezra.

==Architecture==

===Mario Botta building, 1995===

In the summer of 1988, architects Mario Botta, Thomas Beeby and Frank Gehry were announced as finalists in a competition to design the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art&#x27;s new structure in Downtown. Semifinalists included Charles Moore and Tadao Ando. The three finalists were to present site-specific design proposals later that year, but the museum canceled its architectural competition after only a month and went with the 45-year-old Botta.

The new museum, planned in association with architects Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum, was built on a parking lot on Third Street between Mission and Howard streets. The South-of-Market site, near Moscone Convention Center, was targeted through an agreement between the museum, the redevelopment agency, and the development firm of Olympia &amp; York. Land was provided by the agency and developer, but the rest of the museum was privately funded. Construction of the five-story building began in early 1992, with an opening in 1995, the institution&#x27;s 60th anniversary.

At the time of the new building&#x27;s opening, SFMOMA touted itself as the largest new American art museum of the decade and, with its of exhibition space, the second-largest single structure in the United States devoted to modern art. (New York&#x27;s Museum of Modern Art, with of gallery space, was then the largest single structure, while the nearly 80,000 combined square feet of Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles put it in second place).

Michael Kimmelman in The New York Times reported that the new Botta buildingconsists of galleries rising around a central, skylighted atrium. The overall structure, roughly speaking, is a series of stepped-back blocks with a cylinder in the middle containing the soaring light well and stairway...Outside, rising above the nearly windowless, striated brick facade, is the giant black-and-white striped silo of the central well, sliced on the bias, topped by a 130-foot-high elliptical skylight that has already become the museum&#x27;s trademark.

Botta&#x27;s interior design is marked by alternating bands of polished and flame-finished black granite on the floor, ground-level walls, and column bases, and by bands of natural and black-stained wood on the reception desks and coat-check desk.

===Rooftop sculpture garden and pavilion, 2009 ===
In 2009, SFMOMA opened its rooftop sculpture garden and pavilion, located above the museum&#x27;s parking structure and situated across an enclosed pedestrian bridge from the fifth-floor galleries. Following an invitational competition held in 2006, the garden was designed by Jensen Architects in collaboration with Conger Moss Guillard Landscape Architecture. It features two open-air spaces for plants and sculpture and between them a glass pavilion for dining. The larger sculpture garden affords views of the city skyline, dominated by the imposing art deco facade of the 140 New Montgomery skyscraper.

===Snøhetta expansion, 2016===

In 2009, in response to significant growth in the museum&#x27;s audiences and collections since the opening of the 1995 building, SFMOMA announced plans to expand. A shortlist released in May 2010 included four architecture firms officially under consideration for the project: Adjaye Associates; Diller Scofidio + Renfro; Foster + Partners; and Norwegian architecture firm Snøhetta. In July 2010 the museum selected Snøhetta to design the expansion.

On May 14, 2016, following a three-year-long closure, the museum re-opened to the public. The approximately expansion joined the existing building with a new addition spanning from Minna to Howard Streets. The expanded building includes seven levels dedicated to art and public programming, and three floors housing enhanced support space for the museum&#x27;s operations. It offers approximately of indoor and outdoor gallery space, as well as nearly of art-filled free-access public space, more than doubling SFMOMA&#x27;s previous capacity for the presentation of art and providing almost six times as much public space as the pre-expansion building. The soaring &quot;silo&quot; with its Oculus Bridge remained, but the Botta staircase was removed.
The expanded building includes a large-scale vertical garden on the third floor, purported to be the biggest public living wall of native plants in San Francisco; the large, free-access Roberts Family Gallery on the ground-floor gallery facing Howard Street, with glass walls that place art on view to passersby; a double-height &quot;white box&quot; space on the fourth floor with sophisticated lighting and sound systems; state-of-the-art conservation studios on the seventh and eighth floors; and, on the seventh floor, a long balcony that offers skyline views to the east, toward Salesforce Tower and the Bay Bridge. The expansion facades are clad with lightweight panels made of Fibre-Reinforced Plastic; upon completion, this was the largest application of composites technology to architecture in the United States at the time. The building achieved LEED Gold certification, with 15% energy-cost reduction, 30% water-use reduction, and 20% reduction in wastewater generation.

==Board of Trustees and Directors==

<text>Interactive art is a form of art that involves the spectator in a way that allows the art to achieve its purpose. Some interactive art installations achieve this by letting the observer walk through, over or around them; others ask the artist or the spectators to become part of the artwork in some way.

Works of this kind of art frequently feature computers, interfaces and sometimes sensors to respond to motion, heat, meteorological changes or other types of input their makers have programmed the works to respond to. Most examples of virtual Internet art and electronic art are highly interactive. Sometimes, visitors are able to navigate through a hypertext environment; some works accept textual or visual input from outside; sometimes an audience can influence the course of a performance or can even participate in it. Some other interactive artworks are considered as immersive as the quality of interaction involve all the spectrum of surrounding stimuli. Virtual reality environments like works by Maurice Benayoun and Jeffrey Shaw are highly interactive as the work the spectators – Maurice Benayoun call them &quot;visitors&quot;, Miroslaw Rogala calls them (v)users, Char Davies &quot;immersants&quot; – interact with take all their fields of perception.

Though some of the earliest examples of interactive art have been dated back to the 1920s, most digital art didn&#x27;t make its official entry into the world of art until the late 1990s. Since this debut, countless museums and venues have been increasingly accommodating digital and interactive art into their productions. This budding genre of art is continuing to grow and evolve in a somewhat rapid manner through internet social sub-culture, as well as through large scale urban installations.

== Interactivity in art ==

Interactive art is a genre of art in which the viewers participate in some way by providing an input in order to determine the outcome. Unlike traditional art forms, wherein the interaction of the spectator is merely a mental event, interactivity allows for various types of navigation, assembly, and/or contribution to an artwork, which goes far beyond purely psychological activity. Interactivity as a medium produces meaning.

Interactive art installations are generally computer-based and frequently rely on sensors, which gauge things such as temperature, motion, proximity, and other meteorological phenomena that the maker has programmed in order to elicit responses based on participant action. In interactive artworks, both the audience and the machine work together in dialogue in order to produce a unique artwork for each audience to observe. However, not all observers visualize the same picture. Because it is interactive art, each observer makes their own interpretation of the artwork and it may be completely different from another observer&#x27;s views.

Interactive art can be distinguished from generative art in that it constitutes a dialogue between the artwork and the participant; specifically, the participant has agency, or the ability, even in an unintentional manner, to act upon the artwork and is furthermore invited to do so within the context of the piece, i.e. the work affords the interaction. More often, we can consider that the work takes its visitor into account. In an increasing number of cases, an installation can be defined as a &quot;responsive environment&quot;, especially those created by architects and designers. By contrast, Generative Art, which may be interactive, but not responsive per se, tends to be a monologue – the artwork may change or evolve in the presence of the viewer, but the viewer may not be invited to engage in the reaction but merely enjoy it.

==History==
According to the new media artist and theorist Maurice Benayoun, the first piece of interactive art should be the work done by Parrhasius during his art contest with Zeuxis described by Pliny, in the fifth century B.C. when Zeuxis tried to unveil the painted curtain. The work takes its meaning from Zeuxis&#x27; gesture and wouldn&#x27;t exist without it. Zeuxis, by its gesture, became part of Parrhasius&#x27; work. This shows that the specificity of interactive art resides often less in the use of computers than in the quality of proposed &quot;situations&quot; and the &quot;Other&#x27;s&quot; involvement in the process of sensemaking. Nevertheless, computers and real time computing made the task easier and opened the field of virtuality – the potential emergence of unexpected (although possibly pre-written) futures – to contemporary arts.

Some of the earliest examples of interactive art were created as early as the 1920s. An example is Marcel Duchamp’s piece named &quot;Rotary Glass Plates&quot;. The artwork required the viewer to turn on the machine and stand at a distance of one meter in order to see an optical illusion.

The present idea of interactive art began to flourish more in the 1960s for partly political reasons. At the time, many people found it inappropriate for artists to carry the only creative power within their works. Those artists who held this view wanted to give the audience their own part of this creative process. An early example is found in the early 1960s &quot;change-paintings&quot; of Roy Ascott, about whom Frank Popper has written: &quot;Ascott was among the first artists to launch an appeal for total spectator participation&quot;. Aside from the “political” view, it was also current wisdom that interaction and engagement had a positive part to play within the creative process.

In the 1970s, artists began to use new technology such as video and satellites to experiment with live performances and interactions through the direct broadcast of video and audio. At this time, Gordon Pask came up with the &quot;Conversation theory&quot;. This theory emphasizes the dynamic exchange of information between participants in a system. As a two-way dialogue, this concept of a conversation between the user and the system has shaped artists&#x27; thinking about interactivity. 

Interactive art became a large phenomenon due to the advent of computer-based interactivity in the 1990s. Along with this came a new kind of art-experience. Audience and machine were now able to more easily work together in dialogue in order to produce a unique artwork for each audience. In the late 1990s, museums and galleries began increasingly incorporating the art form in their shows, some even dedicating entire exhibitions to it. This continues today and is only expanding due to increased communications through digital media.
A hybrid emerging discipline drawing on the combined interests of specific artists and architects has been created in the last 10–15 years. Disciplinary boundaries have blurred, and significant number of architects and interactive designers have joined electronic artists in the creation of new, custom-designed interfaces and evolutions in techniques for obtaining user input (such as dog vision, alternative sensors, voice analysis, etc.); forms and tools for information display (such as video projection, lasers, robotic and mechatronic actuators, led lighting etc.); modes for human-human and human-machine communication (through the Internet and other telecommunications networks); and to the development of social contexts for interactive systems (such as utilitarian tools, formal experiments, games and entertainment, social critique, and political liberation).

== Forms ==
There are many different forms of interactive art. Such forms range from interactive dance, music, and even drama. New technology, primarily computer systems and computer technology, have enabled a new class of interactive art. Examples of such interactive art are installation art, interactive architecture, interactive film, and interactive storytelling. Since there is a presumed participant or agent in interactivity, interactive art has a deep connection with performance art.

== Events and places ==
There are number of globally significant festivals and exhibitions of interactive and media arts. Prix Ars Electronica is a major yearly competition and exhibition that gives awards to outstanding examples of (technology-driven) interactive art. Others include SIGGRAPH (the Association of Computing Machinery&#x27;s Special Interest Group in Graphics), ISEA (the International Symposium on Electronic Art), DEAF (the Dutch Electronic Arts Festival), Transmediale Germany, Electronic Language International Festival Brazil, and AV Festival England.

CAiiA (the Centre for Advanced Inquiry in the Interactive Arts) was first established by Roy Ascott in 1994 at the University of Wales, Newport, and later in 2003 as the Planetary Collegium. It was the first doctoral and post doc research center to be established specifically for research in the interactive art field.

Interactive architecture has now been installed on and as part of building facades, in foyers, museums, and large scale public spaces, including airports, in a number of global cities. A number of leading museums, for example, the National Gallery, Tate, Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, and Science Museum in London (to cite the leading UK museums active in this field) were early adopters in the field of interactive technologies, investing in educational resources, and more latterly, in the creative use of MP3 players for visitors. In 2004, the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum commissioned curator and author Lucy Bullivant to write Responsive Environments (2006), the first such publication of its kind. Interactive designers are frequently commissioned for museum displays; a number specialize in wearable computing.
