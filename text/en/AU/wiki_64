<text>The Spencer family is an aristocratic British family. From the 16th century, its members have held numerous titles, including the dukedom of Marlborough, the earldoms of Sunderland and Spencer, and the Churchill barony. Two prominent members of the family during the 20th century were Sir Winston Churchill and Diana, Princess of Wales.

==History==
===Descent and claims===

The House was founded in the 15th century by Henry Spencer (died c. 1478), from whom all members descend. In the 16th century, the claim arose that the Spencers were a cadet branch of the older House Le Despencer, though this theory has since been debunked, in particular by historian J. Horace Round in his essay &quot;The Rise of the Spencers&quot;. The Spencers were first granted a coat of arms in 1504, &quot;Azure a fess Ermine between 6 sea-mews&#x27; heads erased Argent,&quot; but this bears no resemblance to the arms used by the family after c. 1595, which were derived from the Despencer arms, &quot;Quarterly Argent and Gules in the second and third quarters a Fret Or overall on a Bend Sable three Escallops of the first&quot; (the scallops standing for the difference as a cadet branch). Round argued that the Despencer descent was fabricated by Richard Lee (also &quot;Leigh&quot;), a corrupt Clarencieux King of Arms. Citing Round, &quot;The Complete Peerage&quot; dismissed the alleged Despencer descent as an &quot;elaborate imposture&quot; which &quot;is now incapable of deceiving the most credulous.&quot;

===Rise to wealth===
A close relative of Henry Spencer (died c. 1478) was John Spencer, who in 1469 had become feoffee (trustee) of Wormleighton Manor in Warwickshire and a tenant at Althorp in Northamptonshire in 1486. His nephew, Sir John Spencer (died 1522), first made a living by trading in livestock and other commodities and eventually saved enough money to purchase both the Wormleighton and Althorp lands. Wormleighton was bought in 1506, the manor house was completed in 1512. In 1508, Spencer also purchased the estate of Althorp with its moated house and several hundred acres of farmland. He had grazed sheep here from the 1480s. Impressed by the quality of the land, he eventually bought it and rebuilt the house in 1508. At that time, his estate and mansion in Warwickshire were considerably larger, and the house in Wormleighton was four times the size of Althorp. In 1511, he made further purchases to acquire the villages of Little Brington and Great Brington as well their parish church of St Mary the Virgin, from Thomas Grey, 2nd Marquess of Dorset. By putting down roots at Althorp, Spencer provided what was to become a home for the next 19 generations. In 1519, he was knighted by King Henry VIII, died three years later and was buried in the new family chapel at Great Brington.

The Spencers rose to opulent prominence during the 16th century. Sir John Spencer&#x27;s grandson Sir John Spencer (d. 1586) was a Knight of the Shire for Northamptonshire. The Spencers&#x27; administration of their Northamptonshire and Warwickshire estates was admired and often emulated by gentlemen all over England. Sheep from their pastures were purchased for breeding and it is probable that the family&#x27;s material success and production as gentlemen farmers was rarely equalled in the century.

In the late 16th century, the latter Sir John Spencer&#x27;s grandson Sir Robert Spencer (1570–1627) represented Brackley in Parliament. In 1601, he was made a Knight of the Garter, and created Baron Spencer, of Wormleighton, in the Peerage of England in 1603. During the reign of King James I he was reputed to be the richest man in England. The humble origins of the Spencers as sheep farmers once caused a heated exchange of words between wealthy yet then upstart Spencers with the more established Howards whose FitzAlan ancestors had been the Earls of Arundel since the 13th century. During a debate in the House of Peers, Lord Spencer was speaking about something that their great ancestors had done when suddenly the Earl of Arundel cut him off and said &quot;My Lord, when these things you speak of were doing, your ancestors were keeping sheep&quot;. Lord Spencer then instantly replied, &quot;When my ancestors as you say were keeping sheep, your ancestors were plotting treason.&quot;

Robert Spencer, 1st Baron Spencer, was succeeded in his peerage and estates by his eldest surviving son, William. He had previously represented Northamptonshire in Parliament. Two of his sons received additional peerages: His eldest son, Henry (1620–1643), succeeded as 3rd Baron Spencer in 1636 and was created Earl of Sunderland in the Peerage of England in 1643. The younger son, Robert (1629–1694), sat in the House of Commons from 1660 to 1679 and was created Viscount Teviot in the Peerage of Scotland in 1685.

The senior branch of the Spencers (later known as the Spencer-Churchill family) is currently represented by Jamie Spencer-Churchill, 12th Duke of Marlborough, direct descendant via the eldest male-line of Sir John Spencer, who was knighted by King Henry VIII in 1519 while the cadet branch of the family, the Spencers of Althorp, who descend via the male-line from the younger son of the 3rd Earl Sunderland, is represented by Charles Spencer, 9th Earl Spencer.

===Spencer, later Spencer-Churchill===
Robert Spencer, 2nd Earl of Sunderland, was Lord President of the Council from 1685 to 1688 and a Knight of the Garter. His son Charles, 3rd Earl of Sunderland, was Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, Lord Privy Seal, Secretary of State for both the Northern and Southern Departments, Lord President of the Council, First Lord of the Treasury and a Knight of the Garter. His second wife was Lady Anne Churchill, the second daughter of the distinguished soldier John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough. After Churchill&#x27;s death in 1722, the Marlborough titles first passed to his eldest daughter Henrietta (1681–1733), then to Anne&#x27;s second son, Charles. After the death of his elder brother, Robert, in 1729, Charles Spencer had already inherited the titles of 4th &quot;Earl of Sunderland&quot; and &quot;Baron Spencer&quot; of Wormleighton as well as the Spencer family estates. In 1733, he succeeded to the Churchill family estates and titles and became the 3rd Duke of Marlborough as well as a Knight of the Garter, while the Spencer estates in Bedfordshire, Northamptonshire (including Althorp) and Warwickshire passed to his younger brother John (1708–1746).

In 1815, Francis Spencer, the younger son of George Spencer, 4th Duke of Marlborough, was created Baron Churchill, of Wychwood in the County of Oxford, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. In 1902, his grandson, the 3rd Baron, was created Viscount Churchill, of Rolleston in the County of Leicester, also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

In 1817, George Spencer, 5th Duke of Marlborough, obtained permission to assume and bear the additional surname of Churchill in addition to his own surname of Spencer, in order to perpetuate the name of his illustrious great-great-grandfather. At the same time he received Royal Licence to quarter his paternal arms of Spencer with the coat of arms of Churchill. The modern Dukes of Marlborough thus originally bore the surname &quot;Spencer&quot;. The double-barrelled surname of &quot;Spencer-Churchill&quot; as used since 1817 has remained in the family to this day, though some members have preferred to style themselves merely &quot;Churchill&quot;. The 7th Duke of Marlborough was the paternal grandfather of Sir Winston Churchill (1874–1965), the British prime minister. The latter&#x27;s widow, Clementine (1885–1977), was created a life peeress in her own right as Baroness Spencer-Churchill in 1965.

The family seat of the Dukes of Marlborough is Blenheim Palace in Woodstock, Oxfordshire. Most Spencer-Churchills are interred in the churchyard of St Martin&#x27;s Church, Bladon, a short distance from the palace; only the Dukes and Duchesses are buried in the Blenheim Palace chapel.

=== Spencer, of Althorp House ===

In 1761, John Spencer (1734–1783), a grandson of the Charles Spencer, 3rd Earl of Sunderland, was created Baron Spencer of Althorp and Viscount Spencer in the Peerage of Great Britain by King George III. In 1765, he was further created Viscount Althorp and Earl Spencer, also in the Peerage of Great Britain. In 1755, he had privately married Margaret Poyntz (1737–1814) in his mother&#x27;s dressing room at Althorp. They had five children, including the 2nd Earl Spencer, who later became Home Secretary from 1806 to 1807 and a Knight of the Garter. His older son, the 3rd Earl Spencer was Chancellor of the Exchequer under Lord Grey and Lord Melbourne from 1830 to 1834. The 2nd Earl&#x27;s youngest son George (1799–1864) converted from Anglicanism to the Roman Catholic Church, became a priest and took the name of &quot;Father Ignatius of St Paul&quot;. He worked as a missionary and is a candidate for beatification. His older brother, who eventually became the 4th Earl Spencer, was a naval commander, courtier and Whig politician. He initially served in the Royal Navy and fought in the Napoleonic Wars and the Greek War of Independence, eventually rising to the rank of Vice-Admiral, and was made a Knight of the Garter in 1849. His son, the 5th Earl Spencer, who was known as the &quot;Red Earl&quot; because of his distinctive long red beard, was a close friend of prime minister William Ewart Gladstone. He served twice as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland and was made a Knight of the Garter in 1864. He was succeeded in 1910 by his half-brother, the 6th Earl Spencer, who had been made Viscount Althorp, of Great Brington in the County of Northamptonshire, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, in 1905 and served as Lord Chamberlain from 1905 to 1912. He became a Knight of the Garter in 1913, and was succeeded in the earldom and estates by his son, the 7th Earl Spencer, in 1922. His son, the 8th Earl Spencer, succeeded to the earldom and estates in 1975. He married Frances Ruth Roche in 1954 and had a daughter, Diana, who married Prince Charles in 1981.

The family seat of the Earl Spencer is Althorp in Northamptonshire, their traditional burial place is the parish church of St Mary the Virgin Church, Great Brington. The family estate includes significant land holdings in other parts of the country, including the village of North Creake in Norfolk.

<text>Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy&#x27;s Kong Quest is a 1995 platform video game developed by Rare and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). It was released on 21 November 1995 in Japan, 4 December in North America, and 14 December in Europe. It is the second installment of the &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot; series and the sequel to &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot; (1994).

Players control Diddy Kong and his girlfriend Dixie Kong, who must rescue Donkey Kong after he is kidnapped by King K. Rool. The game is set on Crocodile Isle, with eight worlds of varying environments, totaling 52 levels. The game uses the same Silicon Graphics (SGI) technology from the original, which features the use of pre-rendered 3D imagery.

&quot;Diddy&#x27;s Kong Quest&quot; received acclaim and is regarded as one of the greatest 2D platformers made. Praise was directed at its graphics, gameplay, and soundtrack. It was the second best-selling game of 1995, and the sixth best-selling game on the SNES.

It was re-released for the Game Boy Advance (GBA) in 2004. The game was made available for download on the Virtual Console for the Wii and Wii U in 2007 and 2015, respectively. It was followed by &quot;Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong&#x27;s Double Trouble!&quot; in 1996.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy&#x27;s Kong Quest&quot; is a 2D side-scrolling platformer in which the player controls either Diddy Kong or his friend Dixie Kong through 52 varying levels over eight different worlds. The main objective of the game is to rescue Donkey Kong from King K. Rool. The game features a wide number of enemies, which include land-based reptilian Kremlings, rats, porcupines, bees, and vultures. Enemies in underwater sections include pufferfish, stingrays and piranhas. Each world culminates with a boss fight, which is required to be defeated in order to progress to the next world. The player-characters can defeat most hostiles by jumping on them, cartwheeling through them, or throwing a barrel at them. When hit by an enemy, the active character leaves the screen and control will switch to the other character. The player can reclaim their partner from barrels marked DK. If both characters die, the player will lose a life and will restart from either the beginning of the level or from the last checkpoint, which comes in the form of a star-painted barrel. If the player loses all of their lives, the game will end.

Diddy and Dixie have unique attributes; Diddy is more agile and will run faster, whereas Dixie has a higher jump and can spin her hair in order to glide. The player can pick up the other character and throw them in any direction, similar to barrels. The game features &quot;animal friends&quot;, which returns from its predecessor. Playable animals include Squitter the spider, Rambi the rhino, Rattly the snake, Enguarde the swordfish and Squawks the parrot. These animals have unique abilities, such as Rambi&#x27;s ability to charge at enemies, Squawks&#x27; ability of flight, and Rattly&#x27;s ability to jump extreme heights.

The game features environmental effects throughout some levels, which include fog, rain, and thunderstorms. Some levels feature different mechanics and settings, such as underwater sections, riding a mine cart, grappling onto vines, and beehive levels which feature sticky honey-covered surfaces. The game features barrels that will propel the player in any direction they are facing. Aside from checkpoint barrels, some give the player temporary invincibility or an &quot;animal friend&quot;. Hidden bonus barrels transport the player to a bonus game, which features a challenge such as eliminating all enemies in order to earn a &quot;Kremcoin&quot;. In addition, there are some barrels that can only be activated by a specific character. Players may earn extra lives by collecting balloons, earning 100 bananas or collecting four letters which spell &quot;KONG&quot;.

The player can achieve a maximum completion score of 102% for their save file by completing all levels and bosses, completing all bonus challenges, collecting all DK coins within the Lost World and visiting each of the four Kong family members at least once.

The game is Dixie Kong&#x27;s first appearance in the &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; franchise. Other characters include Cranky Kong, situated in &quot;Monkey Museum&quot;, who is back due to &quot;popular demand&quot; to divulge secrets of the game world and provide comic relief, as well as offer advice. Wrinkly Kong, the wife of Cranky Kong and grandmother of Donkey Kong, makes her first appearance. She runs an educational facility called &quot;Kong Kollege&quot;, where she gives guidance to the player. Swanky Kong runs a game show quiz where the player may complete quizzes and earn extra lives. Funky Kong offers an aeroplane that allows the players to switch between already completed worlds. Additionally, the player can meet a large Kremling called Klubba, at Klubba&#x27;s Kiosk, who demands fifteen Kremkoins from the characters if they want to travel to the Lost World and complete a secret level.

==Plot==
Some time after &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot;, Donkey Kong is relaxing on the beach, until he is ambushed by the Kremlings. He gets kidnapped and brought to Kaptain K. Rool, who demands the Banana Hoard he unsuccessfully tried to steal for a ransom from the Kongs. Diddy Kong and his girlfriend Dixie resolve to go to the Kremling&#x27;s home island, Crocodile Isle, to rescue Donkey Kong. They travel through Crocodile Isle and are helped on their way by an assortment of animals to defeat Kaptain K. Rool. Diddy and Dixie eventually battle and defeat K. Rool, releasing Donkey Kong in the process. K. Rool manages to escape, and shortly after, Diddy and Dixie confront him in the Lost World, a secret area powered by a geyser at the heart of Crocodile Isle. They once again defeat K. Rool, who is hurled into the geyser, causing it to clog up and explode. The explosion causes all of Crocodile Isle to sink, as the Kongs watch K. Rool escape on a small sailboat.

==Development and release==
Development of &quot;Diddy&#x27;s Kong Quest&quot; began shortly after the release of &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot;, but before its commercial success; the employees of Rare desired to present new concepts. Rare founder Tim Stamper served as director, whereas his colleague Brendan Gunn, who had worked on the original, returned to design. In response to complaints from veteran gamers, &quot;Donkey Kong Country 2&quot; was designed to be more challenging than its predecessor. Several working titles were considered, including &quot;DK Rescue!&quot;, &quot;Diddy&#x27;s Day Out&quot;, &quot;Diddy&#x27;s Wild Country&quot;, and &quot;Diddy&#x27;s Wild Frontier&quot;. &quot;Diddy Kong&#x27;s Quest&quot; was decided on, but was slightly altered into &quot;Diddy&#x27;s Kong Quest&quot; to create a play on the word &quot;conquest&quot;. The game was announced at E3 1995. A Virtual Boy port was in development at one time but never released.

Like its predecessor, &quot;Diddy&#x27;s Kong Quest&quot; uses Silicon Graphics (SGI) and Advanced Computer Modelling (ACM) rendering technology, in which pre-rendered images are modelled as 3D objects and then transformed into 2D sprites and background layers. The game&#x27;s pirate-themed narrative and level design was influenced by designer Gregg Mayles&#x27;s fascination with the Golden Age of Piracy. The team attempted to maintain the sense of speed and requirement of timing from the previous game. To avoid reproducing the same game entirely, Mayles altered the gameplay to be less linear and more encouraging of exploration, while respecting the basics of fluidity and speed.

In order to surprise players, the team decided to cast Diddy Kong as the main character as opposed to Donkey Kong. Mayles said that he dared to do without the iconic character of the series because his team&#x27;s youth (Mayles himself was 23 during development) allowed them to disregard risks. The team preserved the gameplay mechanic of controlling two characters, which led into the creation of Dixie Kong. While Donkey and Diddy Kong controlled similarly, the team decided to establish a character with different abilities to force the player to change between characters regularly. To achieve this difference, the team gave Dixie the ability to hover and descend gradually. Dixie was modeled and animated by Steve Mayles. According to Gregg, the choice to introduce a female character was decided before the creation of her ponytail, and neither the hovering mechanism nor the intention to increase female representation in video games were an influence in the matter. The ponytail was initially given to create a trailing visual effect when Dixie runs, and Gregg decided to put the ponytail to use upon seeing this effect in action. The concept of Dixie descending by using her ponytail as a helicopter blade was then created. Due to the time-consuming nature of the modeling process, Diddy&#x27;s model was used as the base for Dixie; the ponytail was then added, the clothes were changed, and his features were made more feminine. Nearly fifty names were considered for Dixie, including Didene, Dee, Daisy, Dandi, Dolly, Dizzie, Danni, Dippy and Ducky. The team initially opted for Diddiane before finally deciding on Dixie. Shigeru Miyamoto participated in the creation of the game&#x27;s characters, as he had for the previous game. Miyamoto offered different motifs to adorn Dixie&#x27;s beret with, including a banana, a heart and a logo, namely one inspired by that of the musical group ABBA. Rare incorporated the idea for a logo and placed a small version of the company&#x27;s own on Dixie&#x27;s beret in early promotional art. The creation of Dixie came at the expense of Donkey Kong&#x27;s fiancée Candy Kong, who was removed from the game&#x27;s cast due to Nintendo&#x27;s concerns over her sexually provocative nature. The design choice to have Diddy and Dixie transform into the friendly animals that were initially mounted in the previous game was made out of concerns over sprite size; additionally, Gregg noted that having the two player characters clinging onto a parrot would significantly reduce its maneuverability.

&quot;Donkey Kong Country 2&quot; was released worldwide in late 1995. In Australia, Nintendo released the &quot;Donkey Kong Country 2&quot; Pirate Pak, a limited edition bundle of the game and SNES console. The game was re-released for the Game Boy Advance in 2004.

===Audio===
The soundtrack of &quot;Diddy&#x27;s Kong Quest&quot; was composed by David Wise and was released in the United States as &quot;The Original Donkey Kong Country 2 Soundtrack&quot;. The soundtrack maintains similarity to its predecessor with its prominent percussion and eclectic genres ranging between big band, disco and hip hop. The melodies and rhythms are largely comical in tone, but occasionally melancholic. Certain themes are reminiscent of compositions by Vangelis and Phil Collins. Wise cited Koji Kondo&#x27;s music for the &quot;Mario&quot; and &quot;Zelda&quot; games, Geoff and Tim Follin&#x27;s music for &quot;Plok!&quot;, and synthesizer-based film soundtracks released in the 1980s as influences in creating the music for the &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot; series. As with its predecessor, the music was produced for the SNES&#x27;s SPC700 chip for the game to sound similar to the Korg Wavestation synthesizer.

The game&#x27;s soundtrack was the focus of an OverClocked ReMix collaboration, &quot;Serious Monkey Business&quot;. The final track, &quot;Donkey Kong Rescued&quot;, was remixed by David Wise himself, featuring Grant Kirkhope on electric guitar and Robin Beanland on trumpet.

==Reception==
Upon release, retailers struggled to meet the demand. &quot;Diddy&#x27;s Kong Quest&quot; sold a combined 4.37 million copies in the United States and Japan on the SNES; the total number of copies sold in Japan at 2.21 million, and 2.16 million in the United States. It was the second best-selling game of 1995, after &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Island&quot;, and the sixth best-selling game on the SNES. 

The game received critical acclaim, winning various Game of the Year Awards. The SNES version holds an aggregate score of 92% at GameRankings, whereas the Virtual Console re-release and the Game Boy Advance version both hold a score of 80% at GameRankings and Metacritic, respectively.

The graphics and gameplay were the most praised aspects of the game. Scary Larry of &quot;GamePro&quot; hailed the game as being longer, more graphically impressive, and more fun than the original &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot;, and having some of the most cleverly illustrated levels ever seen on a home system. He gave it a perfect 5/5 in all four categories (graphics, sound, control, and FunFactor), but said that some levels are too difficult for younger players. Aaron Kosydar of &quot;AllGame&quot; thought that &quot;Diddy&#x27;s Kong Quest&quot;″s graphics were superior to that of its predecessor. Dan Whitehead of &quot;Eurogamer&quot; said that the graphics of the game were similar to the first &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot; installment, although he praised them both as &quot;impressive&quot;. However, Whitehead expressed concern over the lack of ambition from the sequel, stating that the gameplay uses the defense of &quot;if it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it&quot;. Reviewing the SNES version, Frank Provo of &quot;GameSpot&quot; heralded the graphics as &quot;more detailed&quot; although admitting that it appeared stylistically similar to the first game. In a separate review regarding the Game Boy Advance version, Provo praised the graphics as richer and &quot;livelier&quot; than those of the original. In a retrospective review, Mark Birnbaum of &quot;IGN&quot; stated that whilst its predecessor &quot;boasted some of the most beautiful graphics&quot; on the SNES at the time, &quot;Diddy&#x27;s Kong Quest&quot; offered a superior experience due to its detail, smooth animation and varying colour palette.

Jeff Pearson of Nintendojo stated that Rare improved the graphics for &quot;Diddy&#x27;s Kong Quest&quot;, and that the character animations appeared &quot;much smoother and more cartoon like&quot; in contrast to the computer-generated feel of the original. Pearson also heralded the background designs as reaching &quot;newer heights&quot; of quality. A reviewer of &quot;Cubed3&quot; heralded the visuals as &quot;unbelievable&quot; for a 16-bit game. A reviewer of &quot;Jeux Video&quot; stated that the game &quot;pushed the boundaries&quot; of the console and that every detail was &quot;devilishly handsome&quot;, and also praised the handling of the gameplay as being &quot;pushed to a climax&quot;. The music also received widespread praise, and is considered one of the greatest video game soundtracks of all time. The track &quot;Stickerbush Symphony&quot; has received particular critical acclaim. Writing for &quot;Kotaku&quot;, Ethan Gach called it &quot;melancholic and reflective&quot; while still &quot;up-tempo enough to be a bop&quot; and that when combined with its accompanying level, it was &quot;one of the most transcendent platforming moments in the genre&quot;. In 2018, &quot;Complex&quot; ranked the game 17th on their &quot;The Best Super Nintendo Games of All Time&quot;.

===Sequels and re-releases===
A direct sequel, &quot;Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong&#x27;s Double Trouble!&quot;, was released for the SNES in 1996 to positive reviews. In the game, Dixie Kong and Kiddy Kong must find both Donkey and Diddy Kong, who have disappeared while exploring the Northern Kremisphere, which has been invaded by the Kremlings. It was further followed by a succession of more related &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; video games, such as &quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot; in 1999 and &quot;Donkey Kong Country Returns&quot; in 2010. &quot;Diddy&#x27;s Kong Quest&quot; was later released for the Game Boy Advance in November 2004 and the Wii&#x27;s Virtual Console in May 2007. It was made available for the Wii U and New Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console in 2015 and 2016, respectively. It was later released on the Nintendo Switch via the Nintendo Switch Online service on September 23, 2020.

In the United States, the game&#x27;s Game Boy Advance version sold 630,000 copies and earned $19 million (~$ in ) by August 2006. During the period between January 2000 and August 2006, it was the 41st highest-selling game launched for the Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS or PlayStation Portable in that country.

<text>Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong&#x27;s Double Trouble! is a 1996 platform video game developed by Rare and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). It was released in November 1996 in North America and Japan, and on 13 December in Europe and Australia. &quot;Dixie Kong&#x27;s Double Trouble&quot; is the third installment of the &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot; series and serves as a sequel to &quot;Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy&#x27;s Kong Quest&quot;. It was also re-released for the Game Boy Advance (GBA) in 2005. The game was made available to download on the Wii&#x27;s Virtual Console service in 2007, as well as for the Wii U&#x27;s Virtual Console in 2014.

The plot centers on Dixie Kong and her cousin, Kiddy Kong, in their attempts to save the captured Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong from the series&#x27; antagonist King K. Rool. The game is set in the &quot;Northern Kremisphere&quot;, a fictionalized version of northern Europe and Canada. &quot;Dixie Kong&#x27;s Double Trouble!&quot; utilises the same Silicon Graphics technology from its predecessors, which features the use of pre-rendered 3D imagery. The game received positive reviews upon release; critics praised the visuals and various aspects of gameplay, but most were divided over the game&#x27;s soundtrack.

== Gameplay ==

&quot;Dixie Kong&#x27;s Double Trouble!&quot; is a platform game where players control Dixie Kong and her baby cousin, Kiddy Kong, through 8 worlds which comprise a total of 48 levels. Many of the gameplay elements from previous games in the series mark a return in this game, such as barrels, bonus levels which reward the player with special &quot;bonus coins&quot;, DK coins, animal helpers and a multiplayer mode. Both of the two playable Kongs have unique abilities, such as Dixie&#x27;s ability to slow her descent by spinning her ponytail, and Kiddy&#x27;s ability to bounce across open water. The Kongs may also pick each other up to throw each other around levels; the impact of the other player-character can reveal cracked floors, hidden switches or secret areas. At any time, the player can switch Kongs during a level.

Levels in the game include a mixture of platforming, swimming and on-rails levels. They are based around several returning themes including forests, cliff-sides, factories and mountain tops. The level design is more diverse compared to its predecessors, which includes more complex puzzles and obstacles. Every level has an enemy called a Koin; each of these enemies bears the DK Coin of their respective level, holding it as a shield. As these enemies always face towards the player, they must be defeated by throwing a steel barrel over them so it bounces off a wall behind them in order to strike them from behind. The game overworld is also more complex, allowing players to explore between each area instead of forcing them along a linear path. To achieve this, the game includes several vehicles such as a speedboat and hovercraft which can be used to traverse the overworld and access different worlds.

The game features &quot;animal friends&quot;, which return from its predecessors. Returning animals include Enguarde the swordfish, Squitter the spider and Squawks the parrot. New animals include Ellie the elephant, who can suck up water through her trunk to spray enemies with, and Parry the &quot;parallel bird&quot;, who flies directly above the player-characters and can be used to collect out-of-reach items. As in the previous game, players can directly control animals instead of just riding them. Scattered around the Northern Kremisphere overworld are the Brothers Bear, a family of bears who provide the players with hints, key items or other services. Players can collect items in levels to trade with the bears for other items or to help progress to later levels; one such item is the Bear Coin, which acts as the game&#x27;s currency. Other members from the Kong family, such as Wrinkly Kong, Swanky Kong, and Funky Kong, can also be found around the overworld, each of whom offer their own services.

== Plot ==
=== Characters ===

The player-characters in the game are Dixie Kong, who is Diddy Kong&#x27;s girlfriend, and her younger cousin, Kiddy Kong. Scattered around the overworld are various other characters: Wrinkly Kong appears in &quot;save caves&quot;, which when entered allow the player to save their game; Funky Kong plays a key role in the game, as he supplies the player with vehicles to traverse the overworld; and Swanky Kong, reappearing from the previous game, allows players to challenge Cranky Kong in a contest involving throwing balls at targets in exchange for Bear Coins. New to the series are the Brothers Bear, thirteen bears providing the player with services in exchange for Bear Coins, some of who are instrumental for advancing through the game. The main antagonist of the previous games, King K. Rool, reappears under the moniker of &quot;Baron K. Roolenstein&quot;.

=== Story ===
Shortly after the events of &quot;Diddy&#x27;s Kong Quest&quot;, Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong suddenly disappear in the Northern Kremisphere. Dixie Kong sets off to find the pair and is joined by her cousin Kiddy Kong and aided by Funky Kong&#x27;s vehicles to traverse the land. They reach Kastle KAOS, the lair of a robot named KAOS, who was thought to be the new leader of the Kremlings. After they destroy KAOS, the curtain in the background rolls up to reveal the robot was being controlled by Baron K. Roolenstein, the new moniker of King K. Rool. After the duo fights him, Donkey and Diddy pop out of the destroyed KAOS, implying they were being used to power the robot.

Dixie and Kiddy uncover the extinct volcanic island of Krematoa. They meet Boomer, an exiled member of the Brothers Bear, inside his Anderson shelter. He agrees to destroy the rocks hindering the path in exchange for bonus coins. After Dixie and Kiddy find all bonus coins and five cogwheels hidden in Krematoa, the duo give the cogs to Boomer, who puts them into a machine which re-activates Krematoa, revealing the &quot;Knautilus&quot;, K. Roolenstein&#x27;s personal submarine. The Kongs board the submarine and battle against him in there, but he escapes once again.

Once the Kongs collect all DK coins, they give the coins to Funky, who in exchange gives them a gyrocopter. The duo then finds an enigmatic creature called the Banana Bird Queen, who is bound to a barrier cast by K. Roolenstein. She tells the Kongs that she can only be freed if her separated children are returned to her, and that she will rid the land of K. Rool if she is freed. The Kongs find each of her children in a cave, where one of the birds is trapped in a crystal which shatters when the Kongs complete a &quot;Simon&quot;-like memory game. After rescuing them and completing a large trade sequence between the Brothers Bear, the Kongs return the children to the Queen. The Queen and her children all sing, annihilating the barrier. The Queen proceeds to chase K. Rool, who is fleeing in a hovercraft. When she catches up to him, she drops a giant eggshell on top of him, which Dixie and Kiddy land on. The Kongs repeatedly knock on the shell, annoying the captured K. Rool.

== Development and release ==
Development of &quot;Dixie Kong&#x27;s Double Trouble!&quot; began shortly after the release of &quot;Diddy&#x27;s Kong Quest&quot;, utilising the same Silicon Graphics (SGI) and Advanced Computer Modelling (ACM) rendering technology as its predecessors, in which pre-rendered 3D animations are turned into 2D sprites. Rare founder Tim Stamper re-took the role as the game&#x27;s director, whereas Rare staffers Andrew Collard and Paul Weaver designed the game. The game&#x27;s soundtrack was composed by Eveline Fischer, with additional tracks by series composer David Wise, and Fischer producing most of the game&#x27;s music.

&quot;Dixie Kong&#x27;s Double Trouble!&quot; was first released in North America on 18 November 1996 and Europe and Australia on 13 December. It was also made available to download on the Wii&#x27;s Virtual Console service in 2007, as well as for the Wii U&#x27;s Virtual Console in 2014. It was later released on the Nintendo Switch via the Nintendo Switch Online service on 18 December 2020. While the game sold over 3.5 million units worldwide, it has been suggested that its sales were hurt by its November release, which was when Nintendo 64 console was popular after its September launch. 1.7 million copies were sold in Japan and 1.12 million copies sold in the United States.

A port was later released for the Game Boy Advance in November 2005, which includes a new soundtrack composed by Wise; the team originally had a &quot;vague hope&quot; to have both the original and the new soundtrack in that version, but this proved unfeasible due to cartridge and time constraints. The game also included an unlockable Christmas theme for the bonus levels. By entering &quot;Merry&quot; on the file select screen, the stars and bananas will be changed to bells and presents and the background music will change to Christmas music.

==Reception==
The game received positive reviews upon release. The SNES version holds an aggregate score of 83% from GameRankings, whereas the Game Boy Advance version holds a score of 75%.

The graphics and gameplay were the most praised aspects of the game. Frank Provo of &quot;GameSpot&quot; stated that the graphics were colourful, vibrant and &quot;top-notch&quot;. The four reviewers of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; found them colourful and even sharper than those of previous instalments. They said that the gameplay, while not differing much from the previous game, has ample intelligent design and replay value in the levels to make it a must-have for those who liked previous games in the series. A &quot;Next Generation&quot; critic argued that the game&#x27;s perceived similarity to the first two games is to an extent superficial, noting its graphics as detailed and crispier than &quot;Donkey Kong Country 2&quot;, and its controls as refined, giving the movement and action to be more precise and intuitive. He also highly praised the level designs and balanced challenge. Doctor Devon of &quot;GamePro&quot; scored it a 4.5 out of 5 in sound and fun factor and a perfect 5.0 in graphics and control, describing the backgrounds as sharp and colourful, the underwater levels as suitable for framing, and characters displaying more details. He criticised it for largely repeating the gameplay of the previous instalments, but still found the game highly enjoyable. Lucas Thomas of &quot;IGN&quot; opined that &quot;Dixie Kong&#x27;s Double Trouble!&quot;″s visuals were not as awe-inspiring as the pre-rendered CGI of &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot;, but admitted that they &quot;still looked great&quot; for the third instalment. In a retrospective review, Marcel van Duyn of &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; praised the game&#x27;s visuals and detailed backgrounds, stating that they were &quot;fantastic&quot; for the SNES. Reviewing the Game Boy Advance version, a reviewer from &quot;GamePro&quot; thought that the graphics appeared &quot;washed out&quot; on the system&#x27;s backlit screen, stating that the pre-rendered sprites did not &quot;show up very well&quot;. A reviewer from &quot;Nintendo Master&quot; thought that the game&#x27;s main strengths were its beautiful graphics and script. A reviewer from &quot;Jeuxvideo&quot; asserted that the various aspects of gameplay made &quot;Dixie Kong&#x27;s Double Trouble!&quot; a hallmark of the series.

The music received positive opinions from critics. Doctor Devon commented that although it sounds similar to its predecessors, &quot;Dixie Kong&#x27;s Double Trouble!&quot; has a music of superb quality. Thomas thought compared to the other &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot; games, the music in &quot;Dixie Kong&#x27;s Double Trouble!&quot; stands out the least, although he stated that it was an &quot;impressive effort&quot;. Van Duyn similarly commented that the soundtrack was not as &quot;legendary&quot; as it was in its previous instalment, but still admitted that it had some &quot;great&quot; tracks. In addition, Van Duyn criticised the Game Boy Advance&#x27;s port for replacing all of the original music with new compositions. Although Provo stated that the Game Boy Advance port&#x27;s music was &quot;catchy&quot; and &quot;just as good as the originals&quot;, he noted that devotees to the original SNES game may not like it.

&quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; editors named &quot;Donkey Kong Country 3&quot; a runner-up for both Super NES Game of the Year (behind &quot;Tetris Attack&quot;) and Side-Scrolling Game of the Year (behind &quot;Guardian Heroes&quot;). In 2018, Complex listed the game number 65 in their The Best Super Nintendo Games of All Time. &quot;IGN&quot; ranked &quot;Donkey Kong Country 3&quot; 58th on their &quot;Top 100 SNES Games of All Time&quot; and described the game as a satisfying conclusion to Rare&#x27;s cycle of 16-bit platformers.

<text>Donkey Kong Land is a 1995 platform game developed by Rare and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy. It condenses the side-scrolling gameplay of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) game &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot; (1994) for the handheld Game Boy with different level design and boss fights. The player controls the gorilla Donkey Kong and his nephew Diddy Kong as they defeat enemies and collect items across 30 levels to recover their stolen banana hoard from the crocodile King K. Rool.

Development began in 1994, before &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot; completion, and lasted a year. Rare&#x27;s Game Boy programmer, Paul Machacek, developed &quot;Land&quot; as an original game rather than as a port of &quot;Country&quot; after convincing Rare co-founder Tim Stamper it would be a better use of resources. Like &quot;Country&quot;, &quot;Land&quot; features pre-rendered graphics converted to sprites through a compression technique. Rare retooled &quot;Country&quot; gameplay to account for the lower quality display, and David Wise and Graeme Norgate converted the soundtrack to the Game Boy&#x27;s sound chip.

&quot;Donkey Kong Land&quot; was released in mid-1995. It sold 3.91 million copies and received positive reviews. Critics praised it as successfully translating &quot;Country&quot; gameplay, visuals, and music to the Game Boy, though they disagreed over whether it was an equal experience. &quot;Land&quot; was followed by &quot;Donkey Kong Land 2&quot; (1996), &quot;Donkey Kong Land III&quot; (1997), and a Game Boy Color version of &quot;Country&quot; (2000), which attempted to replicate the SNES &quot;Country&quot; games more closely. &quot;Land&quot; and its sequels were rereleased for the Nintendo 3DS via the Virtual Console service in 2014, and on Nintendo Switch via its online service in 2024.

==Gameplay==

As a handheld companion to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) game &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot; (1994), &quot;Donkey Kong Land&quot; features similar gameplay: it is a side-scrolling platform game in which the player controls the gorilla Donkey Kong and his nephew Diddy Kong across 30 levels. Donkey is stronger, Diddy is faster, and the player can swap between them at will. They jump between platforms, stomp on enemies, swing on vines, and avoid obstacles. The story begins after Cranky Kong challenges Donkey and Diddy to replicate &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot; success on the Game Boy&#x27;s 8-bit hardware and coaxes King K. Rool and the Kremlings into stealing their banana hoard again.

The player travels through four worlds, their progress tracked by a world map. &quot;Land&quot; retains some level themes from &quot;Country&quot;, such as jungles and coral reefs, but introduces others, such as cliffs and clouds. It also features different level design, enemy varieties (such as flying pigs), and bosses. Levels are populated by collectible bananas, barrel-shaped cannons, hidden bonus stages, throwable items, and letters spelling K–O–N–G that save the player&#x27;s progress. Some levels feature one of two animal companions, the rhino Rambi and the ostrich Expresso, who provide the Kongs with special abilities. Each world ends in a boss fight. The player starts with a limited number of lives, which are lost if they fall down a bottomless pit or are damaged by an enemy. The player can earn extra lives by collecting balloons or a hundred bananas.

==Development==
Rare began working on &quot;Donkey Kong Land&quot; in 1994, alongside &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot; and shortly before the cancellation of a &quot;Battletoads Arcade&quot; Game Boy port. Rare&#x27;s co-founder, Tim Stamper, asked their Game Boy programmer Paul Machacek to port &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot; to the Game Boy. Machacek convinced Stamper it would be better to develop a similar but original game, as he had with the Game Boy version of &quot;Battletoads&quot; (1991). He reasoned it would not take much more effort and would expand the audience beyond those who had not purchased &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot;. After Machacek spent roughly three weeks updating the Game Boy &quot;Battletoads&quot; game engine to handle a &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; game, development began and lasted a year.

Like &quot;Country&quot;, &quot;Land&quot; features pre-rendered graphics converted to sprites through Rare&#x27;s Advanced Computer Modelling (ACM) compression technique. Although the Game Boy is considerably less powerful than the SNES, its basic architecture is similar; this allowed Machacek to easily transfer &quot;Country&quot; artwork to &quot;Land&quot; and the artists to use the same PowerAnimator tools for new ACM assets. The project pushed the Game Boy to its limits because of its graphics. Particularly, constructing levels with slopes and animating collectibles, both uncommon in Game Boy games, required a greater ROM size. The limitations meant only one player character could appear on-screen at a time and that Rare had to reduce the number of bonus stages and animal companions.

&quot;Land&quot; team started as just Machacek but grew to over 15. They worked separately from the teams that developed the &quot;Country&quot; games for the SNES, and designed levels using a spare Silicon Graphics workstation with a custom level editor. Machacek spent considerable time trying to authentically re-create &quot;Country&quot; gameplay. Because the Game Boy&#x27;s small, slow, and monochromatic display made reacting to obstacles more difficult, the team did not re-use level layouts from &quot;Country&quot;, made boss fights more predictable, and gave Expresso the ability to defeat enemies. They turned the K–O–N–G letters into a save feature, rather than having them provide an extra life as in &quot;Country&quot;, to make completing the game easier. The team sought to distinguish &quot;Land&quot; from &quot;Country&quot; with new game mechanics. Machacek said that replicating &quot;Country&quot; did not stop Rare from introducing new worlds and design elements in a similar way to the teams developing the SNES sequels, &quot;Country 2: Diddy&#x27;s Kong Quest&quot; (1995) and &quot;Country 3: Dixie Kong&#x27;s Double Trouble!&quot; (1996).

The soundtrack was composed by David Wise and Graeme Norgate, who worked to convert Wise&#x27;s &quot;Country&quot; soundtrack to the Game Boy&#x27;s sound chip. Norgate, who described &quot;Land&quot; as his most upbeat work, wrote original tracks to fit the new locales&#x27; atmosphere. It was his first Game Boy project and the system&#x27;s technical restrictions forced him to focus on melodies. He said Wise helped teach him as they worked together: &quot;He&#x27;d drip feed me little tricks to improve the overall sound. &#x27;You can repeat the melody three steps forward at a third of the volume to emulate an echo&#x27;, and voila, your lead melody now has a lovely tight delay that makes it sound a lot wider and smoother&quot;.

==Release==
&quot;Donkey Kong Land&quot; was the second &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; game for the Game Boy, following &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; (1994). Like &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot;, &quot;Land&quot; was announced at the Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago in June 1994 and promoted through Nintendo&#x27;s Play It Loud! marketing campaign. It was released in North America on 26 June 1995, in Japan on 27 July, and in Europe on 24 August. In Japan, the game was released under the title &quot;Super Donkey Kong GB&quot;. Nintendo distributed &quot;Land&quot; in banana yellow cartridges, unlike other Game Boy games, which came in grey. &quot;Land&quot; was one of several games optimised for the Super Game Boy, a peripheral allowing Game Boy cartridges to be played on a SNES; playing it through the Super Game Boy adds colour palettes and a jungle-themed border. &quot;Donkey Kong Land&quot; sold 3.91 million copies, making it the bestselling &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; game for a Game Boy console.

==Reception==

&quot;Donkey Kong Land&quot; received positive reviews and was named the best Game Boy game of 1995 by &quot;GamePro&quot;. Critics considered it a successful translation of &quot;Country&quot; gameplay to the Game Boy and wrote that players who enjoyed the SNES game would also enjoy &quot;Land&quot;. &quot;Diehard GameFan&quot; and &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; highlighted the new levels, mechanics, and locales, and &quot;The Electric Playground&quot; said the controls were tight and responsive. &quot;GamePro&quot; said that despite the technical limitations and smaller scope, &quot;Land&quot; was &quot;a formidable effort considering what it accomplishes on a portable system&quot;, with lengthy levels and challenging gameplay.

Reviewers praised the visuals, impressed by Rare&#x27;s effort to preserve &quot;Country&quot; pre-rendered art style. &quot;GameFan&quot; and &quot;Video Games: The Ultimate Gaming Magazine&quot; called it one of the best-looking Game Boy games with detail unprecedented for the system, and &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; (&quot;CVG&quot;) said the visuals and animations were still excellent despite lacking &quot;Country&quot; fidelity. &quot;The Electric Playground&quot; said the visuals, though great, highlighted the Game Boy&#x27;s limitations, as its monochromatic screen occasionally made it difficult to comprehend the gameplay. &quot;GamePro&quot; agreed that the Game Boy&#x27;s screen did not do the visuals justice. Some critics recommended playing &quot;Land&quot; on the Super Game Boy for adding colour and making the visuals easier to discern.

Opinions differed as to how &quot;Land&quot; compared to &quot;Country&quot; and the rest of the Game Boy&#x27;s library. Some critics considered &quot;Land&quot; equal to &quot;Country&quot; (&quot;CVG&quot; called it superior on the basis of its gameplay); others called it lesser. &quot;Game Players&quot; felt that both featured quality gameplay, but &quot;Land&quot; lacked the visual fidelity that made &quot;Country&quot; special. Several called &quot;Land&quot; one of the best Game Boy games, but &quot;The Electric Playground&quot; said it was not as inventive, satisfying, or original as the 1994 Game Boy &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;. Still, they felt it was one of the Game Boy&#x27;s best platformers and an essential purchase. The music and sound were praised as among the Game Boy&#x27;s best. &quot;The Electric Playground&quot; believed they were near-perfect translations of &quot;Country&quot;, and &quot;GameFan&quot; said they sounded on par with a SNES game when played through the Super Game Boy.

== Legacy ==
Michael Teitelbaum wrote a children&#x27;s book adaptation of &quot;Donkey Kong Land&quot;, &quot;Rumble in the Jungle&quot;, following its release. &quot;Land&quot; received three follow-up games: &quot;Donkey Kong Land 2&quot; (1996), based on &quot;Diddy&#x27;s Kong Quest&quot;; &quot;Donkey Kong Land III&quot; (1997), based on &quot;Dixie Kong&#x27;s Double Trouble!&quot;; and a Game Boy Color version of &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot; (2000), which re-creates the SNES game using &quot;Land&quot; graphics and audio. The follow-ups attempted to replicate the SNES games more closely; unlike &quot;Land&quot;, they do not introduce new level archetypes or enemies. The &quot;Land&quot; trilogy was rereleased for the Nintendo 3DS via the Virtual Console in 2014. &quot;Donkey Kong Land&quot; was released via Nintendo Switch Online on 22 November 2024.

Retrospective reviewers considered &quot;Donkey Kong Land&quot; a technical achievement. &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; felt Rare successfully replicated &quot;Country&quot; art style on the Game Boy and praised the music, which they considered among the Game Boy&#x27;s best. However, &quot;Polygon&quot; wrote that the developers &quot;were so preoccupied with whether they &quot;could&quot; [replicate &quot;Country&quot; graphics] they forgot to ask if they &quot;should&quot;. The rich visuals of the Super NES games become completely illegible on Game Boy... a blurry grey soup of pixel-junk.&quot; &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; said that enemies blending with the background made &quot;Land&quot; needlessly difficult and lamented the absence of the Super Game Boy enhancements in the 3DS rerelease.

&quot;Polygon&quot; ranked &quot;Donkey Kong Land&quot; and its sequels among the lesser &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; games; &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; ranked it towards the middle. In a 2018 interview, Machacek said that of the games he worked on, &quot;Donkey Kong Land&quot; remained among his favourites. Some of &quot;Land&quot; levels, such as K. Rool&#x27;s pirate ship, would be featured in subsequent &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; games. It also established a tradition of &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; games being distributed on yellow cartridges, which its sequels and &quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot; (1999) would continue.

<text>Donkey Kong 64 is a 1999 platform game developed by Rare and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64. It is the only &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; game to feature 3D gameplay. As the gorilla Donkey Kong, the player explores themed levels to collect items and rescue his kidnapped family members from King K. Rool who seeks to destroy DK Isles. The player completes minigames and puzzles as five playable Kong characters—each with their own special abilities—to receive bananas and other collectibles. In multiplayer modes, up to four players can compete in deathmatch and last man standing games.

Rare began working on &quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot; in 1997, following the completion of &quot;Donkey Kong Country 3&quot; (1996). It was conceived as a 2.5D platformer similar to &quot;Country&quot; before becoming a more open-ended game using the engine from Rare&#x27;s &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; (1998). A 16-person team with many recruits from the &quot;Banjo&quot; group finished it in 1999. It was published by Nintendo in North America in November and worldwide in December. &quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot; was the first of two games to require the Nintendo 64 Expansion Pak, an accessory that added memory resources. The marketing campaign included advertisements, sweepstakes, and a national tour.

&quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot; received acclaim and was Nintendo&#x27;s top seller during the 1999 holiday season; it ultimately sold 5.27 million copies worldwide. It won the 1999 E3 Game Critics award for Best Platform Game and multiple awards and nominations from magazines. Reviewers praised the exceptional size and length, but criticized its camera controls and emphasis on item collection and backtracking. Some cited its gameplay and visual similarities to &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; as a detriment. Critics said &quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot; did not match the revolutionary impact of &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot; but was still among the Nintendo 64&#x27;s best 3D platform games.

&quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot; was Rare&#x27;s final &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; game prior to its acquisition by Microsoft in 2002 and the last major &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; game until &quot;Jungle Beat&quot; (2004). It was rereleased on Nintendo&#x27;s Wii U Virtual Console in 2015. Retrospective reviews of &quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot; were mixed; critics considered it emblematic of the tedium in Rare&#x27;s &quot;collectathon&quot; adventure platformers. The &quot;DK Rap&quot;, a song featured in the introduction, garnered infamy as one of the worst songs in a video game.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot; is a 3D platforming action-adventure game in which the player, as Donkey Kong and his friends, explores an island and collects items to progress through minigames and puzzles. The game follows a traditional storyline for the series: King K. Rool and his reptilian Kremlings invade the idyllic DK Isle and kidnap Donkey Kong&#x27;s friends, planning to power up their Blast-O-Matic weapon and destroy the island. After a tutorial, the player embarks as Donkey Kong to rescue the others from their kidnappers and stop K. Rool&#x27;s plan. While exploring the in-game world and completing puzzle minigames, the player collects two types of bananas: colored bananas, which are color-coded differently for each Kong character, award the player with banana medals and can be traded for access to each world&#x27;s boss fight; and golden bananas, a certain number of which are required to unlock each new in-game world.

Most of the puzzles are simple and involve rearranging items, manipulating switches and tiles, or matching items as in the game Concentration. Minigames include races, minecart rides, and barrels that shoot the characters as projectiles. There are five such golden banana-rewarding objectives for each of five playable characters across seven themed worlds200 goals in total, in addition to a connecting overworld. The worlds&#x27; themes include underwater, forest, jungle, and industry. Unlike prior &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; games, the objectives can be completed in any order. The player can fast travel between sections of the level with designated warp pads and can swap between characters in designated swap barrels. The player collects banana coins, which can be spent to unlock new weapons and abilities, and other collectibles such as weapon ammunition and blueprint puzzle pieces. As in other Rare games, the player often encounters an impasse such as an indestructible object or out-of-reach area, and must acquire a new ability with which to eventually backtrack and resolve it.

Donkey Kong&#x27;s kidnapped friends become playable characters after being rescued. Each of the five characters begin with basic abilities and can purchase additional, unique abilities from Cranky Kong as the game progresses, which are necessary to solve certain puzzles. For example, Donkey Kong can operate levers, Chunky Kong can lift rocks, Tiny Kong can crawl through holes, Diddy Kong can fly, and Lanky Kong can float. The characters each use unique projectiles and musical instruments. For example, some doors can be opened only with Donkey Kong&#x27;s coconut projectiles and others can be opened only with Diddy Kong&#x27;s guitar. There are more special abilities than face buttons on the controller, so button combinations are needed to trigger some abilities. Combinations also trigger special modes, including alternative camera angles, a sniper mode, and a snapshot mode which unlocks more in-game secrets. Playable versions of the original &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; (1981) and &quot;Jetpac&quot; (1983) are hidden within the game, and playing through them is required to finish the story. The player-character can also transform into animals, such as Rambi the Rhino and Enguarde the Swordfish, who recur from earlier series games. Optional hardware support includes a widescreen mode and Rumble Pak compatibility.

A separate multiplayer mode has six minigames for two to four players. Monkey Smash is an open arena, deathmatch-style minigame in which up to four players find ammo and use their respective projectile weapons from the single-player game to damage other players before losing all their own lives. Battle Arena is a king-of-the-hill minigame in which players use weapons and explosives to knock each other off the edge of a platform. Each mode has several sub-types in which players can compete based on time or score.

== Development ==
=== Conception ===
The British studio Rare, which created the successful &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot; games for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in the mid-1990s, developed &quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot;, with Gregg Mayles leading the effort. Development began in 1997, shortly after the completion of &quot;Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong&#x27;s Double Trouble!&quot; (1996). It was originally reported as an intended release on the Nintendo 64&#x27;s 64DD add-on, but transitioned to cartridge while the 64DD was delayed and eventually canceled. Rare artist Carl Tilley disputed the possibility of a 64DD release, recalling to &quot;Did You Know Gaming?&quot; that &quot;Rare [management] wouldn&#x27;t have wanted to release on the DD. Hardware sales dictated where best to sell the game.&quot; &quot;Time Extension&quot; argued that early reports of a 64DD release were &quot;a mistake, a mistranslation, or simply talks between upper management.&quot; Grant Kirkhope stated that &quot;Project Dream&quot; was the 64DD title being developed by Rare at the time, not &quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot;. A team of 16 people worked on the game across three years, and an additional eight members assisted in its later stages. George Andreas served as the project&#x27;s director.

Rare conceived &quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot; as a linear, 2.5D platform game similar to the &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot; games. The Nintendo 64 was still new, and at the time Rare did not have a common game engine. The linear version was developed for around 18 months before it was eliminated in favor of a more open-ended approach similar to Rare&#x27;s 1998 game &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; (1998). Many developers transitioned from the &quot;Banjo&quot; team, and the final version was built atop the &quot;Banjo&quot; game engine.

=== Design ===
The character models were designed and animated from scratch. Rare was unable to reuse the models from the &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot; series, where they had been pre-rendered and modeled with NURBs using PowerAnimator; &quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot;″s real-time 3D graphics could only use polygons, so the team used a new tool, Gamegen. The pre-rendered models were used as reference for the polygon models and textures, such as for the interior of the Kongs&#x27; mouths. Though the real-time graphics prevented Rare from reproducing the level of detail seen in the &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot; series, they allowed for more expressive characters. Rendering satisfactory models proved challenging; lead artist Mark Stevenson noted that &quot;[b]eing able to see this character from any angle, you&#x27;d make an animation, put it in the game, and you&#x27;d think it looked good side-on, but awful from every other angle!&quot;
The strong emphasis on collectibles was a design choice made at the request of Rare co-founder Tim Stamper to distinguish &quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot; from &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot;. According to director George Andreas, &quot;I&#x27;d always go back to him and say &#x27;Here&#x27;s some&#x27; and he&#x27;d go &#x27;No, more things. Retrospectively, Andreas commented that he should have reined himself in; particularly, he would have liked to unify the color-coded banana system. Rare attempted to differentiate &quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot; from &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; through its variety of playable characters, cinematic set-pieces, and bombastic boss battles. According to Andreas, Donkey Kong creator Shigeru Miyamoto was appalled when he saw Donkey Kong shoot a realistic shotgun used as a placeholder during a pre-release demonstration, and quickly sketched the coconut gun used in the final game.

A removed feature, &quot;Stop &#x27;N&#x27; Swop&quot;, allowed data to be transferred from &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; to &quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot; to unlock in-game bonuses. During development, Rare discovered the Nintendo 64 retained flash memory for several seconds after a cartridge&#x27;s removal. They implemented a feature whereby removing the &quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot; cartridge and quickly inserting the &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; cartridge, while the former&#x27;s memory was still in the console, would unlock bonus content. Nintendo requested Stop &#x27;N&#x27; Swop&#x27;s removal when Rare submitted &quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot; for approval. Nintendo was concerned the Nintendo 64 would not retain RDRAM long enough for the feature to work and that it could potentially damage consoles. Specifically, Nintendo 64 models produced after &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; release reduced the amount of time the console retained flash memory, making Stop &#x27;N&#x27; Swop nearly impossible to activate as intended.

&quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot; was the first of two games to require the Nintendo 64&#x27;s Expansion Pak, a console RAM upgrade bundled with the game. The Expansion Pak was previously used to power optional higher-resolution graphics, but in the case of &quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot;, it was marketed as improving the frame rate and rendering of objects at a distance. Chris Marlow, who was working on &quot;Conker&#x27;s Bad Fur Day&quot; (2001) at the time, claimed that Rare could not resolve a bug that occurred without the Expansion Pak and thus they were forced, at great expense, to bundle the game with the memory upgrade. However, Stevenson called Marlow&#x27;s story a &quot;myth&quot; and said that the decision to use the Expansion Pak was made early. Though such a bug did exist toward the end of development, according to Stevenson, the Expansion Pak was not the solution for the problem and it was not introduced for that reason. According to Stevenson, the Expansion Pak was used to power the dynamic lighting system. Nintendo stated that the choice to bundle, rather than selling the accessory separately, would avoid consumer confusion.

=== Music ===

Grant Kirkhope composed the soundtrack, which &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; described as closer in spirit to &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; than to David Wise&#x27;s &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot; soundtracks. However, Kirkhope commented that he tried to retain the darker, atmospheric tone that Wise brought to &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot;, and included a remix of Wise&#x27;s &quot;Jungle Japes&quot;. &quot;Donkey Kong Country 3&quot; composer Eveline Fischer was originally assigned to &quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot;; Kirkhope became involved after he was asked for assistance, and he provided Donkey Kong&#x27;s voice.

The &quot;DK Rap&quot;, which introduces the Kong character abilities, was conceived and written by Andreas, scored and recorded by Kirkhope, and performed by Andreas and Chris Sutherland. It was intended to be a lighthearted joke, although critics interpreted it as a serious songwriting attempt. Nintendo of America ran a &quot;DK Rap&quot; contest in which fans record their own version of the rap to win prizes including a trip to its headquarters.

==Promotion and release==
Rare announced &quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot; with a single screenshot on its website and coverage in the January 1999 issue of &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; wrote that it was playable by the 1997 Electronic Entertainment Expo, though &quot;IGN&quot; said that it debuted at the 1999 event. It was also demonstrated at Nintendo&#x27;s 1999 trade show Spaceworld. &quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot; was expected to be a bestseller, as the console&#x27;s &quot;crowning achievement&quot; in graphics and sound.


&quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot;″s sizable marketing campaign doubled the typical budget for a major Nintendo release. The campaign included a 60-second commercial played at over 10,000 movie theaters during the holiday season, and additional advertisements via billboards, print, and radio. A promotional &quot;The Beast Is Back&quot; tour brought a truck outfitted with Nintendo games across the United States, and a separate sweepstakes between the series and Dr Pepper was advertised in supermarkets. Nintendo projected sales of 2.5 million copies within one year, and later that year increased the number to 4 million copies (1.5 million more than for &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time&quot;), including 1 million of the translucent green Nintendo 64 bundles. Polled retailers expected &quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot; to be the top console game sold during the 1999 holiday season. It had little holiday season competition from Nintendo, as Nintendo had moved releases including &quot;Mario Party 2&quot;, &quot;Perfect Dark&quot;, and &quot;Pokémon Stadium&quot; into the next year.

Rare and Nintendo released &quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot; in North America in November 1999, and a worldwide release followed the next month. Nintendo offered a special bundle of the game and console, including a banana yellow-colored game cartridge, its required Expansion Pak, and a transparent green &quot;Jolly Rancher-style&quot; Nintendo 64 console.

In April 2015, &quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot; was digitally rereleased as one of the first Nintendo 64 games added to Nintendo&#x27;s Wii U Virtual Console catalog. This was the game&#x27;s first rerelease, as it had not appeared on the Wii Virtual Console. Why it was never released on the Wii Virtual Console is unknown, although &quot;Nintendo World Report&quot; speculated that it may have been related to the fact that it contains both the original arcade &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; (which was already available on the Virtual Console) and &quot;Jetpac&quot; (which Nintendo does not hold the rights to) as playable bonuses.

== Reception ==
&quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot; received critical acclaim&quot;universal acclaim&quot;, according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. It became the Nintendo 64&#x27;s top seller during the 1999 holiday season and Nintendo&#x27;s chief defense against competitor Sega&#x27;s introduction of its Dreamcast console. As a bestseller, &quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot; joined Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Player&#x27;s Choice&quot; game selection, where high sales continued through the next holiday season. Cumulative worldwide sales were 5.27 million, including more than 2.3 million copies in North America by 2004. It won the 1999 E3 Game Critics award for Best Platform Game, and several annual awards from &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;, including best overall game of 1999. &quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot; received nominations for &quot;Game of the Year&quot; and &quot;Console Game of the Year&quot; by the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences during the 3rd Annual Interactive Achievement Awards (now known as the D.I.C.E. Awards). &quot;GamePro&quot; named it an &quot;Editor&#x27;s Choice&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot; described &quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot; as the biggest and most ambitious Nintendo 64 game as of its release, but very similar to &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; in its platforming and puzzle design. Similarities between the two games was a common refrain. Overall, reviewers were more impressed by its visuals than by its other elements, such as gameplay.
Reviewers criticized the emphasis on collecting items and backtracking&quot;an interactive egg hunt&quot;. This had become a trend in Rare&#x27;s games, and &quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot; followed the &quot;predictable formula&quot; of making players collect multiple sets of items and in full for a special ending. &quot;Next Generation&quot; noted Rare&#x27;s propensity for backtracking. &quot;GameSpot&quot; more diplomatically assumed that players who liked collecting items would be titillated by its replay value, and those who did not would be frustrated by its chores. &quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot; applauded the minigames as a &quot;welcome diversion [which] add to the fun of an already massive adventure&quot;, and which are so good they would have worked as their own released games on previous-generation consoles. &quot;EGM&quot; said the puzzles and minigames are fun the first time through, but they quickly become worn when replayed with increasingly tighter time restrictions. &quot;GameSpot&quot;, however, considered parts of &quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot;″s gameplay &quot;cerebral&quot;, requiring the consideration of several simultaneous tasks to solve later puzzles. Already familiar with concepts borrowed from &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;, &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot;, and &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot;, critics considered the player&#x27;s tasks less innovative or interesting to decipher. In retrospective reviews, &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; described the chore of collecting objects &quot;excessive&quot; and repetitive. They suggested that backtracking, for instance, could be reduced by letting the player switch between characters at any time.
The size and length were frequently noted. With an estimated 30 hours in basic gameplay, &quot;IGN&quot; called it Rare&#x27;s &quot;War and Peace&quot;. &quot;GameFan&quot; wrote that &quot;big&quot; is an understatement, and &quot;the adventure found within is mastodonic&quot;. Writers from &quot;AllGame&quot; and &quot;EGM&quot; became frequently lost or distracted in its world. The ingenuity of the boss battles, particularly the final battle against K. Rool, was highlighted, although the story&#x27;s ending disappointed &quot;EGM&quot;. Reviewers found little entertainment in the multiplayer mode but praised the gameplay variety between the five characters. The controls also frustrated reviewers, between slow movement speed and camera angle issues. For example, characters who become unresponsive during their attack animations are vulnerable to encroaching enemies. &quot;Edge&quot; wrote that the lack of camera improvements over &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; was inexcusable.
Even with the RAM expansion for graphics, &quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot;″s visuals were only found marginallyif at allbetter than that of its contemporary games, such as the previous year&#x27;s &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot; avowed that &quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot; was not as pretty as &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot;, especially in its water and backgrounds, though it still ranked among the console&#x27;s prettiest games because the setting is barren and nondescript at first, and only later introduces lighting effects and richer textures. &quot;IGN&quot; hoped for more from Rare, praising the particle effects (such as in the desert wind), but considering its dynamic lighting overused. &quot;N64 Magazine&quot; said the enhanced effects were most often used for decoration, though they also played some role in puzzles based on illuminating paths. Graphical difficulties were reported even with the extra memory, such as frame rate slowdowns and distant features not appearing in any detail, though overall they commended the graphical flourishes. &quot;GameSpot&quot; also saw a lack of variety in the environment.

The characters were praised for their personalities, animations, and portrayal of Rare&#x27;s signature humor. Several reviewers noted the personalities shown in character animations. &quot;IGN&quot; considered the characters less baffling than those of other Rare games, and sometimes funny. &quot;GameFan&quot; found that the addition of the three new playable characters to the series offered little personality that would be missed.
&quot;IGN&quot; said that the music was less clever than &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot;″s, but Kirkhope&#x27;s soundtrack still delivered a variety of moods and fit the setting. Aural clues in the surround sound and the quality of the underwater effects impressed &quot;GameSpot&quot;. Reviewers criticized the opening &quot;DK Rap&quot; as &quot;embarrassing&quot; and among the worst video game music. &quot;GamePro&quot; said it was humorous but lowbrow. Eight years later, &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; said the song was &quot;loved by some, loathed by others&quot;, similar to the game itself.
The consensus was that &quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot; lacked the revolutionary potential of &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot; but was of a sufficient high quality to sell well during the holiday season. &quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot; described its platform style as coupled with many others, such as &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;, &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot;, and &quot;Jet Force Gemini&quot; (1999): &quot;Replace the story line, the graphics and a couple of gameplay elements and you basically have the same game&quot;. Nonetheless, he said &quot;its mastering of elements that have been done to death may be just the spark needed&quot; to evolve the genre in games released in later years, celebrating its gameplay as addictive and some of the best on the Nintendo 64. Though hyped fans would be disappointed, &quot;IGN&quot; said that &quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot; remains an excellent and expansive platformer with an overwhelming amount of things to do. &quot;GameFan&quot;, on the other hand, was most disappointed by how it &quot;truly offers nothing new&quot; and compared its monotony and repetition with the 1999 film &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot;: &quot;a big bloated project with not enough brilliant moments to justify the numbness... [of] sitting through the whole thing&quot;, it &quot;fails to live up to the Rare name&quot;. &quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot;″s 3D platforming was commonplace by the time of its release and, according to &quot;GameSpot&quot;, would have fared better as a Nintendo 64 launch game. With its competition considered, &quot;Daily Radar&quot; wrote that &quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot; was simply the best 3D platform game on the console. &quot;Edge&quot; qualified this thought: &quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot; was the closest any third-party developer had come to outdoing Nintendo&#x27;s mastery of game structure and was &quot;a fine effort... in its own right&quot;, but its gameplay was derivative and unimaginative compared to the freedom and flexibility of Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;.

In a retrospective review, &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; found the Wii U controller an easy substitute for the Nintendo 64&#x27;s controls.

== Legacy ==
Rare&#x27;s 3D platformers became notorious for their emphasis on collecting items, and &quot;Kotaku&quot; remembered &quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot; as &quot;the worst offender&quot; with hundreds of color-coded bananas. Other retrospective reviewers agreed. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; wrote: &quot;As... &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; breathed life into the 3D platforming genre, &quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot; sucked it all out&quot; and solidified Rare&#x27;s reputation for making &quot;collect-a-thon&quot; games. The indie developer behind &quot;A Hat in Time&quot;, a spiritual successor to &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot;, blamed &quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot; for the &quot;collect-a-thon platform adventurer&quot; genre&#x27;s decline in popularity. The game holds a Guinness World Record for most collectible items in a platform game.

&quot;Retro Gamer&quot; and &quot;Game Informer&quot; both remembered the reception as &quot;mixed&quot;, in consideration of its similarities with &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; and lack of genre-pushing changes. Though decently reviewed, this and Rare&#x27;s subsequent Nintendo 64 releases did not meet the extolment of the company&#x27;s preceding games, and lackluster sales led to a staff exodus that culminated with the company&#x27;s acquisition by Microsoft in 2002. &quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot; was resultingly Rare&#x27;s final &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; game; the series did not receive another major installment until &quot;Donkey Kong Jungle Beat&quot; (2004) five years later. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; noted at the game&#x27;s launch, that the Nintendo 64 was approaching the end of its lifecycle, as gamers turned their sights to the Sega Dreamcast and Sony PlayStation 2. &quot;IGN&quot; later named &quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot; as worthy of a remake for the Nintendo 3DS handheld console. In 2009, &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot; placed the game 89th in a list of the best Nintendo games, calling it &quot;a forgotten classic&quot;.

The &quot;DK Rap&quot; is still remembered for its negative reception, but an upswing in popularity happened more than a decade after release as an Internet meme. Sutherland believes this happened because those who played the game as children had realized the song was meant to be taken as a joke, not a serious songwriting attempt. Similarly, Kirkhope commented that &quot;it&#x27;s a bit like ABBA, the way they&#x27;ve kind of come back into fashion over the years&quot;. Renditions of the &quot;DK Rap&quot; appeared in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Melee&quot; (2001) and &quot;Donkey Konga&quot; (2003). In 2017, Kirkhope composed a similar rap for &quot;Yooka-Laylee&quot;, a platform game made in homage to Rare&#x27;s works. The rap plays during Donkey Kong&#x27;s introduction in &quot;The Super Mario Bros. Movie&quot; (2023), included at the behest of Donkey Kong&#x27;s voice actor Seth Rogen. Kirkhope was flattered by the song&#x27;s inclusion but disappointed he did not receive credit; the film simply credits it as originating from &quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot;.

<doc id="153422" wikidata="Q482708" url="?curid=153422" title="Ham Seok-heon">
<text>Ham Seok-heon (13 March 1901 – 4 February 1989) was a notable figure in the Religious Society of Friends (Quaker) movement in Korea, and was nicknamed the &quot;Gandhi of Korea.&quot; Ham was an important Asian voice for human rights and non-violence during the 20th century, despite numerous imprisonments for his convictions. He was a Quaker who concluded that all religions are on common ground in terms of human beings, a view shared by many Quakers.

He encouraged peace and democracy and promoted non-violence movement known as “seed idea” (ssi-al sasang), consistently present in his books &quot;Korean History Seen through a Will&quot; published in 1948, &quot;Human Revolution&quot; in 1961, &quot;History and People&quot; in 1964, and &quot;Queen of Suffering: a spiritual history of Korea&quot; edited in 1985. He was also a poet and wrote about 120 poems such as “Song of the West Wind” written in 1983.
In 2000, Ham was selected by the Republic of Korea as a national cultural figure.

==Early life==
Ham was born in Yomju County, North Pyongan Province, currently North Korea and grew up as a Presbyterian. In 1919, he joined the March 1st Movement, the beginning of Korean resistance to the Japanese occupation. He lost his place in Pyongyang Public High School. In 1923 he graduated from Osan High School and went to Japan to study to become a teacher. There he first encountered the Non-Church movement, an indigenous Japanese Christian movement that had no liturgy, sacraments or ordained clergy. He spoke out against social injustices and advocated pacifism.

<text>Converse () is an American lifestyle brand that markets, distributes, and licenses footwear, apparel, and accessories. Founded by Marquis Mills Converse in 1908 as the Converse Rubber Shoe Company in Malden, Massachusetts, it has been acquired by several companies before becoming a subsidiary of Nike, Inc. in 2003.

Converse initially produced winterized rubber-soled shoes and boots. During World War II, it shifted manufacturing to make footwear for the military. Initially, it was one of the few producers of athletic shoes and dominated the U.S. market, but lost its position in the 1970s as competitors introduced their styles.

Converse&#x27;s portfolio includes products under the Chuck Taylor All-Stars, Cons, Jack Purcell, One Star, and Star Chevron trademarks. It frequently collaborates on special-edition product releases with other brands such as John Varvatos. The growth of Converse as a casual fashion accessory contributed to $2.4 billion in revenue in 2023.

==History==

===1908–1940: Early years===
Forty-seven-year-old Marquis Mills Converse, a manager at a footwear manufacturing firm, opened the Converse Rubber Shoe Company in February 1908, in Malden, Massachusetts. The company was a rubber shoe manufacturer, and its early inventory included winterized rubber-soled footwear, galoshes, tennis shoes, and some non-footwear items like automobile tires. In summer of 1916, the Converse basketball line was established; by 1917 the Converse All-Star basketball shoe was introduced and quickly became successful during World War I and the Spanish flu.

In 1922, basketball player Charles H. &quot;Chuck&quot; Taylor walked into Converse complaining of sore feet, and Converse gave him a job as a salesman and ambassador. He promoted the shoes around the U.S., and in 1932 Taylor&#x27;s signature was added to the All-Star patch on the high-topped sneakers. He continued this work until shortly before his death in 1969. Sales for the All-Star soared until 1929 when the company fell into bankruptcy. In 1939, Converse was sold to the Stone Family, who owned Converse until 1972 when the Eltra Corporation proposed an acquisition.

=== 1941–2001: War, rise, and bankruptcy ===
When the U.S. entered World War II in 1941, Converse shifted production to manufacturing rubberized footwear, outerwear, and protective suits for the military. After the war&#x27;s end, the company resumed production of athletic footwear and chiefly made a high top shoe, in either black or white. In the 1950s and 1960s, Converse promoted an American image with its Converse Basketball Yearbook. Artist Charles Kerins created cover art that celebrated Converse&#x27;s role in the lives of high school and college athletes. In 1957, Converse came out with a low-cut style of All-Stars. By 1966, the shoe was also available in school colors. 
Converse customized shoes for the New York Renaissance (the &quot;Rens&quot;), the first all-African-American professional basketball team. The shoes were designed to be &quot;non-skid&quot;, which gave basketball players better grip. An extra strip of rubber was eventually added to protect the shoes from constant pivoting; this was called the &quot;pivot button&quot;. In 1962, center Wilt Chamberlain of the Philadelphia Warriors scored 100 points in a National Basketball Association (NBA) game while wearing a pair of All-Stars, taking a 169–147 victory over the New York Knicks in Hershey, Pennsylvania, on March 2.

By the early 1970s, Converse had diversified to include manufacturing sporting goods and industrial products. Converse was acquired by the Eltra Corporation in 1972, and bought out one of its biggest competitors at the time, PF Flyers, from B.F. Goodrich. However, federal courts ruled the sale a monopoly and the deal was subsequently broken up through anti-trust litigation. Converse only retained the trademark rights to the Jack Purcell line, which it still produces. The chevron-and-star insignia—a logo that remains on a large portion of Converse footwear—was created by Jim Labadini, an employee. 

Eltra was acquired by Allied Corporation in 1979. Allied moved out of the consumer products business in the 1980s, and in October 1986, Converse was acquired by Interco Incorporated and spun off in 1994.

Converse lost its athletic shoe monopoly from the 1970s onward, as new competitors, including Puma, Adidas, and Nike, grew in popularity. A decade later, as Reebok introduced new designs and technology to the sports market, Converse was no longer the official shoe of the NBA. Although canvas-rubber shoes regained popularity in the 1980s as casual footwear, Converse eventually became too dependent on the &quot;All Stars&quot; basketball brand, whose market collapsed by 1989–1990. By 2000, Converse was slipping repeatedly into receivership as debt piled up yearly.

Converse filed for bankruptcy on January 22, 2001. On March 30, its last manufacturing plants in the U.S. closed down, as production fully moved overseas. In April 2001, Footwear Acquisitions, led by Marsden Cason and Bill Simon, purchased the brand from bankruptcy and added industry partners Jack Boys, Jim Stroesser, Lisa Kempa, and David Maddocks to lead the turnaround. During this period, Converse moved its headquarters from North Reading, Massachusetts, to North Andover, Massachusetts. The company was located in the town of North Andover for 13 years.

===2002–present: Acquisition by Nike and new headquarters===
In July 2003, Nike paid to acquire Converse. In January 2013, Converse announced plans for a new headquarters building. It was constructed near North Station in downtown Boston, on the Lovejoy Wharf, as part of a site overhaul and restoration of public waterfront access. The 10-story office building includes a permanent music recording studio, gym with separate yoga studio, and a retail store.

In May 2023, Converse hired Jared Carver as the new president and CEO.

== Legal issues ==
Starting in July 2008, Converse sent around 180 cease-and-desist letters to over 30 companies that they claimed were violating the Chuck Taylor All-Stars trademark and selling so-called look-alike sneakers. In October 2014, Converse filed a lawsuit against 30 companies for allegedly infringing on its generic sneaker style&#x27;s bumper toe, striped midsole, and toe cap. The brand argued that companies were violating an alleged common-law trademark by importing sneakers with similar elements. Several companies settled with Converse and they were dropped from the list.

In November 2015, Charles Bullock, chief administrative judge at the International Trade Commission, preliminarily ruled that several brands Converse filed against were violating Converse&#x27;s outsole design trademarks, i.e. the pattern on the bottom of the sole of the shoe. The soles of the shoes are designed to allow players to jump or move in all directions. The diamond pattern makes this possible. Judge Bullock further ruled that while Skechers &quot;Twinkle Toes&quot; brands did share similarities to Converse, &quot;Twinkle Toes&quot; were different enough and marketed in a way for it not to be mistaken for Chuck Taylor All-Stars. Judge Bullock also ruled that most of the shoes sold by Highline United under the Ash brand did not infringe and that Converse did not have a valid common law mark for its midsole.

On June 23, 2016, the anniversary of the death of Chuck Taylor, the International Trade Commission ruled that Converse&#x27;s alleged trade dress for the midsole design of a combined toe cap, toe bumper, and stripe was not entitled to trademark protection under the common law and found invalid Converse&#x27;s federal trademark registration. The case was appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which ruled that the ITC had used the wrong test and remanded the case. On remand, the ITC ruled that Converse&#x27;s trade dress was protectable but not infringed.

== Products ==
=== Chuck Taylor All-Stars ===
Converse started making an early basketball shoe in 1917 and redesigned it in 1922, when Chuck Taylor asked the company to create a better shoe with more support and flexibility. After Converse added Taylor&#x27;s signature to the ankle patch they became known as Chuck Taylor All Stars. By the 1960s the company had captured about 70 to 80 percent of the basketball shoe market, but the shoe declined in popularity during the 1970s when basketball players wore competing brands. Chuck Taylor All-Stars enjoyed a comeback in popularity in the 1980s as retro-style casual footwear.

Chuck Taylor All-Stars have made an appearance in over 650 films, such as &quot;Back to the Future&quot;, &quot;I, Robot&quot;, &quot;Grease&quot; and &quot;Stand by Me&quot;. David Tennant (playing the Tenth Doctor) wore red and cream versions of Hi-top Converse on science-fiction show &quot;Doctor Who&quot;.

=== The Weapon ===

In 1986, Converse released &quot;The Weapon&quot; basketball shoe. Manufactured in two color schemes to match the kit colors of basketball teams, it has been available in both high-top and low-cut varieties. It had leather construction throughout, including the inside heel which was also heavily padded for comfort. The first endorsers of &quot;The Weapon&quot; were Larry Bird and Magic Johnson, who were prominently featured in a Converse commercial set in Bird&#x27;s hometown of French Lick, Indiana in 1985. They were also worn by Axl Rose in the Guns N&#x27; Roses music video &quot;Estranged&quot;.

Converse re-released &quot;The Weapon&quot; classic (which Kobe Bryant wore at least three times in 2002 and Andre Miller wore in 2002 from mid-August to early September) several times from 1999 to 2003 and after, &quot;The Loaded Weapon&quot; in 2003, &quot;The Weapon 86&quot; in 2008 (and the Poorman version in 2009, and the John Varvatos version in 2012), &quot;The Weapon EVO&quot; in 2009, and its successor &quot;The Star Player EVO&quot; (sometimes reduced to &quot;The Star Plyr EVO&quot; or &quot;The Star Ply EVO&quot;) in 2010.

Before &quot;The Weapon&quot;, Converse launched the &quot;One Star&quot; in 1974, the &quot;Pro Leather&quot; in 1976 and the &quot;Starion&quot; in 1984, all known for basketball and basketball performance.

=== Chuck Taylor II ===
A redesigned model of the Chuck Taylor All-Star, the &quot;Chuck Taylor II&quot;, was released in July 28, 2015. Incorporating Nike technology, it retains most of the original&#x27;s outward appearance while employing newer materials for the insole.
==Sponsorships==
In 2019, Converse returned to performance basketball with the All-Star Pro BB. Kelly Oubre Jr. was the first player to try out the new product, which combined the traditional Converse silhouette with the contemporary Nike technology. Thereafter Converse signed Draymond Green in March 2020, Natasha Cloud (the first WNBA player) in June, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander in July, and, thereafter, Rudy Gay, P. J. Tucker, DeAndre&#x27; Bembry, De&#x27;Anthony Melton, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Immanuel Quickley, Deividas Sirvydis, Jordan Clarkson, Josh Richardson, David Duke Jr., Brandon Williams. Some of the aforementioned players also wear other brands.

Gilgeous-Alexander, point guard for the Oklahoma City Thunder, has become the new face of the brand. The shoe, &quot;Chase the Drip&quot; was released on September 13, 2022.

== Skateboarding ==
In the 1980s, Converse sponsored several influential skaters including Jason Jessee, Rodney Mullen, and Mark Rogowski. Under the &quot;Cons&quot; name, Converse launched its skateboarding program in 2009 with a team of &quot;ambassadors&quot;: Kenny Anderson, Anthony Pappalardo, Nick Trapasso, Sammy Baca, Ethan Fowler, Raymond Molinar, and Rune Glifberg. In 2012, the company added Jason Jessee and Mike Anderson to its ambassadors team.

In August 2012, Converse sponsored a skate event at Huntington Beach, California, U.S. Trapasso, Tom Remillard, Aaron Homoki, Greyson Fletcher, Ben Raemers, Ben Hatchell, Robbie Russo, and Ben Raybourn participated in the competition that was held. Raybourn eventually won the US$20,000 grand prize, and Homoki won the US$3,000 Best Trick contest.

As of July 2014, the Cons skateboard team consisted of original members Anderson, Trapasso, Baca, and Glifberg, while Jessee, Anderson, Julian Davidson, Remillard, Zered Basset, Ben Raemers, Jake Johnson, Eli Reed, Louie Lopez, Sage Elsesser, and Sean Pablo were subsequently added. Bassett filmed a new advertisement that was broadcast online in July 2014, in which he skateboarded through New York City in a newly launched skate shoe version of the Converse Weapon model.

In February 2024, Converse and Phaidon launched a book titled &quot;Skateboard&quot;, about the history of skateboarding from the 1950s to today. The book was put together by Jonathan Olivares, a designer and skater.

==Philanthropy==
A special collection called &quot;1Hund (RED)&quot;, whereby fifteen percent of the profits are used to support HIV/AIDS prevention, was released by the brand. One hundred artists from around the world were chosen to create designs for the collection as part of the (RED) campaign. Professional skateboarder Anthony Pappalardo released a (RED) edition of his high-selling signature skate shoe model in February 2010. Pappalardo explains:

I got into woodworking about two years ago, through a buddy of mine who I used to skate with every day—he turned into a woodworker. So he gave me this scrap box of wood ... It just definitely started consuming me as skating did. I wanted to read about it, you know? Go on the internet and watch videos about it, and just learn anything and everything I could about woodworking. The first thing I ever made was a bench, and that&#x27;s, kinda, what I&#x27;ve been making ever since. The cool thing about working with Product (RED) is just by doing the two things that I love, I&#x27;m also able to help people.

In 2012, Converse was listed as a partner in the (RED) campaign, together with other brands such as Nike, Inc., Girl, and Bugaboo. The campaign&#x27;s mission is to prevent the transmission of the HIV virus from mother to child by 2015 (the campaign&#x27;s byline is &quot;Fighting For An AIDS Free Generation&quot;).

In the winter of 2018, Converse teamed up with several influential figures in the Los Angeles area to create a collection paying to those who help move the culture forward in the city. Among those selected by the Boston-based footwear brand for this L.A.-themed collection are Vince Staples, Dr. Woo, Rocket, BornXRaised, and Clot.

<text>Mario Party 4 is a 2002 party video game developed by Hudson Soft and published by Nintendo for the GameCube. The game is the fourth installment in the &quot;Mario Party&quot; series and is the first game in the series to be released for the GameCube. Like the previous games in the series, it features eight playable characters: Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Yoshi, Wario, Donkey Kong, Princess Daisy, and Waluigi from the &quot;Mario&quot; franchise, who can be directed as characters on six themed game boards. The objective is to earn as many stars as possible, which are obtained by purchase from a single predefined space on the game board. Each character&#x27;s movement is determined by a roll of a die, with a roll from each player forming a single turn. Each turn is followed by a minigame in which characters compete for coins they can use to purchase items and stars.

&quot;Mario Party 4&quot; was met with mixed reception, with some complaints regarding a lack of originality and slow pacing during games. It won the Family Game of the Year award at the Interactive Achievement Awards of 2003. The game was followed by &quot;Mario Party 5&quot; for the same console in 2003.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Mario Party 4&quot; is based on an interactive board game played by four characters from the &quot;Mario&quot; franchise, which are controlled either by the player or the game&#x27;s artificial intelligence. The game features eight playable characters, although they do not have any different gameplay attributes from each other (save for favoring certain items when controlled by the AI). Players can arrange their characters into opposing pairs, or play independently in a battle royale. As with most board games, each participant takes turns in rolling a dice block (1 to 10) to determine the number of spaces moved on the board. There are 60 minigames, one of which follows each round of four turns, which yields a coin prize for the winner. Twenty coins are required to purchase a star, with the victor being the character with the most stars at the end of the game. The length of a game can vary as the predetermined number of minigames is adjustable in multiples of 5 (min.10 max.50). Stars are usually attained by purchase at the specific space on the game board where it is set, with the star location changing to another space after every acquisition. Three extra stars can be obtained if &quot;Bonus mode&quot; is switched on, with a star each awarded to the player with the most minigames won, most coins collected, and most happening spaces visited.

&quot;Mario Party 4&quot; features six boards, five of which take their name from a secondary &quot;Mario&quot; character, such as Goomba. The boards are themed to correspond with their titular character, and contain specialized features to reflect this, such as the roulette wheel in the casino-based &quot;Goomba&#x27;s Greedy Gala&quot;. The on-board characters follow a set route, although this becomes optional when arriving at a junction. The boards also contain multiple &quot;Events&quot;, which are generic stations placed on every board. These include &quot;Lottery Shops&quot;, where money is gambled on item prizes, and &quot;Boo Houses&quot;, where Boo is paid to steal either coins or a star from an opponent. The majority of spaces on the boards are denoted by either blue or red circles, with blue granting coins and red deducting them. Alternative spaces are also available, such as &quot;happening spaces&quot;, which trigger an event exclusive to the current board. &quot;Mushroom Spaces&quot; grant the user either a &quot;Mega&quot; or &quot;Mini&quot; Mushroom—&quot;Mega Mushrooms&quot; extend the movement range while &quot;Mini Mushrooms&quot; curtail it. Additionally, giant characters will bypass &quot;Events&quot; and stars while reduced characters can access special areas on the board via pipes.

The minigames in &quot;Mario Party 4&quot; are short, unrelated events with a specified objective that the players must attempt to meet to earn coins as a reward. Minigames are unlocked during the main &quot;Party Mode&quot;, although they can be played outside of the game board context in &quot;Minigame Mode&quot;. This allows the player to either freely play minigames; select which minigames they want, and control conditions for victory in a match, such as the &quot;3-win-match&quot;; or play 2 vs. 2 minigames to claim a space on a tic-tac-toe board. Minigames are split into seven categories: &quot;4-player&quot;, &quot;1 vs 3&quot;, &quot;2 vs 2&quot;, &quot;Battle&quot;, &quot;Bowser&quot;, &quot;Story&quot;, etc.. The first three occur randomly after each set of turns during a party, while &quot;Battle&quot; can only be triggered by landing on the corresponding space on the board. Unlike regular minigames, the players must contribute their money and then compete to reclaim it or earn more by winning the minigame. There are also rarer groups of minigames, such as the Bowser minigames requiring the loser to forfeit items or coins and the minigames, which can only be accessed by characters reduced by the &quot;Mini Mushroom&quot;. A set of minigames that cannot be played during normal conditions are located in the &quot;Extra room&quot;, featuring Thwomp and Whomp.

The game features a loose plot in that the player must progress through Story Mode to earn presents from the eponymous characters of the pertaining boards. These are presents that had been brought to the player&#x27;s birthday party in the game, which must be completed by earning the most stars in a board game and subsequently defeating the present giver in a special one-on-one Story minigame. This is all contained within the &quot;Party Cube&quot;, which grants the wishes of its users; the story&#x27;s climax comes in the form of Bowser, who wishes to disrupt the party with his own board, hosted by Koopa Kid. Also, unlike its predecessor, Princess Daisy and Waluigi are now playable in Story Mode.

==Development==
&quot;Mario Party 4&quot;, like all the games in the &quot;Mario Party&quot; series through &quot;Mario Party 8&quot;, was developed by Hudson Soft and published by Nintendo. The game was first announced in a 2002 Nintendo press conference in Tokyo, with the announcements made by Shigeru Miyamoto and Satoru Iwata. It was targeted as part of the 2002 roster of Nintendo games, which they rated as their &quot;biggest year&quot; for software at the time. Nintendo presented a playable demonstration of the game at E3 2002, featuring a limited set of minigames. The game featured voice acting from Charles Martinet (Mario, Luigi, Wario, and Waluigi), Jen Taylor (Peach, Daisy, and Toad), and Kazumi Totaka (Yoshi), all three of whom worked on the previous games in the &quot;Mario&quot; franchise.

==Reception==
===Critical response===

&quot;Mario Party 4&quot; received &quot;mixed or average&quot; reviews, according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, four critics from &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave the game a total score of 30 out of 40.

&quot;GameSpot&quot;&#x27;s Ryan Davis praised the game&#x27;s minigame format, although he noted that &quot;players who have already exhausted themselves on previous &quot;Mario Party&quot; titles may not find enough here to draw them back again&quot;. &quot;Eurogamer&quot;&#x27;s Tom Bramwell acknowledged the variety and thematic features of the boards, but thought they were too large, resulting in a &quot;glacial pace&quot; when coupled with the on-board animations. Despite this, &quot;IGN&quot; praised the boards for the thematic features on each one, which helped to &quot;ease the tediousness&quot;. The game&#x27;s controls were lauded for their compatibility with the minigames and simplicity, with most minigames requiring simple actions and button presses.

The game&#x27;s multiplayer was praised by reviewers, especially in comparison to the single-player Story Mode. The multiplayer element was noted for appealing to a diverse demographic for its party game qualities and being an &quot;&#x27;everybody&#x27; title&quot;. Conversely, Story Mode was criticised for exacerbating issues relating to pace, which was already remarked as having &quot;snail&#x27;s pace&quot;. Additionally, the game&#x27;s artificial intelligence was bemoaned for contributing an imbalance in the game, with the random availability of quality items giving players an unfair advantage. The &quot;reversal of fortune&quot; space, which initiates a minigame by which the victor would receive another player&#x27;s stars or coins, was criticised for similar reasons, as it potentially penalises players who do well in the game. The minigames were mainly met with a positive reaction, with critics praising their simplicity. The grouping feature in the minigames were also welcomed for contributing a new dynamic of gameplay, although Bramwell commented that &quot;it might seem a little odd to gang up with your competitors in some cases&quot;.

Most reviewers noted the game&#x27;s graphical improvement from its predecessors, with the minigames&#x27; visual style in particular receiving praise. Although &quot;IGN&quot; remarked that the game was graphically a &quot;huge improvement since we last saw the franchise&quot;, they proceeded to comment that &quot;It&#x27;s a mixed bag of good and bad&quot;. &quot;GameSpot&quot; complained that the character animations appear &quot;a bit lifeless&quot; and that the boards were not aesthetically pleasing. The game&#x27;s audio was met with an ambivalent reaction, with critics enjoying the music but complaining about the &quot;annoying&quot; character catchphrases. While not memorable, the music was lauded for fitting the game&#x27;s whimsical nature.

Gaming websites &quot;The Game of Nerds&quot; and &quot;The Gamer&quot; ranked &quot;Mario Party 4&quot; the best entry in the series. &quot;Lifewire&quot; called it the best &quot;Mario Party&quot; game of the four released on the GameCube. &quot;Den of Geek&quot; agreed, and also viewed it as the fourth best game in the Mario Party series, citing its minigames.

===Sales and accolades===
&quot;Mario Party 4&quot; won &quot;Family Game of the Year&quot; during the AIAS&#x27; 6th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards. It was nominated for &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s annual &quot;Best Party Game on GameCube&quot; award, which went to &quot;Super Monkey Ball 2&quot;.

The game sold 1,100,000 units from its release to December 27, 2007, in North America, and an additional 900,000 copies in Japan, bringing its overall sales to 2,000,000.

<doc id="153433" wikidata="Q596594" url="?curid=153433" title="Concrete poetry">
<text>Concrete poetry is an arrangement of linguistic elements in which the typographical effect is more important in conveying meaning than verbal significance. It is sometimes referred to as visual poetry, a term that has now developed a distinct meaning of its own. Concrete poetry relates more to the visual than to the verbal arts although there is a considerable overlap in the kind of product to which it refers. Historically, however, concrete poetry has developed from a long tradition of shaped or patterned poems in which the words are arranged in such a way as to depict their subject.

==Development==
Though the term &#x27;concrete poetry&#x27; is modern, the idea of using letter arrangements to enhance the meaning of a poem is old. Such shaped poetry was popular in Greek Alexandria during the 3rd and 2nd centuries BCE, although only the handful which were collected together in the &quot;Greek Anthology&quot; now survive. Examples include poems by Simmias of Rhodes in the shape of an egg, wings and a hatchet, as well as Theocritus&#x27; pan-pipes.

The post-Classical revival of shaped poetry seems to begin with the &quot;Gerechtigkeitsspirale&quot; (spiral of justice), a relief carving of a poem at the pilgrimage church of St. Valentin, Kiedrich. The text is carved in the form of a spiral on the front of one of the church pews and created in 1510 by master carpenter Erhart Falckener. But the heyday of the revival of shaped poetry came in the Baroque period when poets, in the words of Jeremy Adler, &quot;did away with the more-or-less arbitrary appearance of the text, turned the incidental fact of writing into an essential facet of composition, and thereby…created a union of poetry with the visual arts&quot;. There were already precedents for this in Micrography, a technique for creating visual images used by Hebrew artists, which involves organizing small arrangements of Biblical texts such that they form images which illustrate the subject of the text. Micrography allowed the creation of images of natural objects by Jews without directly breaking the prohibition of creating &quot;graven images&quot; that might be interpreted as idolatry. The technique is now used by both religious and secular artists and is similar to the use of Arabic texts in Islamic calligraphy.
Early religious examples of shaped poems in English include &quot;Easter Wings&quot; and &quot;The Altar&quot; in George Herbert&#x27;s &quot;The Temple&quot; (1633) and Robert Herrick&#x27;s &quot;This crosstree here&quot;, which is set in the shape of a cross, from his &quot;Noble Numbers&quot; (1647). Secular examples include poems on the subject of drinking in the shape of wine flagons by Rabelais and Charles-François Panard (1750), supplemented by the elaborate goblet of Quirinus Moscherosch (1660), the playful &quot;A Toast&quot; (Zdravljica, 1844) by France Prešeren, with stanzas in the shape of wine-glasses, and &quot;The Mouse&#x27;s Tale&quot;, a shaped poem published in 1865 by Lewis Carroll.

The approach reappeared at the start of the 20th century, initially in the &quot;Calligrammes&quot; (1918) of Guillaume Apollinaire, with poems in the shape of a necktie, a fountain, and raindrops running down a window, among other examples. In that era also there were typographical experiments by members of avant-garde movements such as Futurism, Dada, and Surrealism in which layout moved from an auxiliary expression of meaning to artistic primacy. Thus the significance of the sound poetry in Marinetti&#x27;s &quot;Zang Tumb Tumb&quot; (1912) is expressed through pictorial means. Similarly in Germany, Raoul Hausmann claimed that the typographic style of his &quot;Phonemes&quot; allowed the reader to recognize what sound was intended. In Russia the Futurist poet Vasily Kamensky went so far as to term the typography of his &quot;Tango with Cows&quot;, published in 1914, &quot;ferro-concrete poems&quot; (&quot;zhelezobetonnye poemy&quot;), long before the name became current elsewhere.

A further move away from overt meaning occurred where &quot;poems&quot; were simplified to a simple arrangement of the letters of the alphabet. Louis Aragon, for example, exhibited the sequence from A to Z and titled it &quot;Suicide&quot; (1926), while Kurt Schwitters&#x27; &quot;ZA (elementary)&quot; has the alphabet in reverse, and the Catalan writer Josep Maria Junoy (1885–1955) placed just the letters Z and A at the top and bottom of the page under the title &quot;Ars Poetica&quot;.

==Post-war concrete poetry==
During the early 1950s two Brazilian artistic groups producing severely abstract and impersonal work were joined by poets linked to the São Paulo magazine &quot;Noigandres&quot; who began to treat language in an equally abstract way. Their work was termed &quot;concrete poetry&quot; after they exhibited along with the artists in the National Exhibition of Concrete Art (1956/57). The poets included Augusto de Campos, Haroldo de Campos and Décio Pignatari, who were joined in the exhibition by Ferreira Gullar, Ronaldo Azeredo and Wlademir Dias Pino from Rio de Janeiro. In 1958 a Brazilian concrete poetry manifesto was published and an anthology in 1962.

Dom Sylvester Houédard claimed that it was the 1962 publication in &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; of a letter from the Portuguese E.M. de Melo e Castro that awakened British writers such as himself, Ian Hamilton Finlay and Edwin Morgan to the possibilities of Concrete Poetry. However, there were by this time other European writers producing similar work. In 1954 the Swedish poet and visual artist Öyvind Fahlström had published the manifesto &quot;Hätila Ragulpr på Fåtskliaben&quot;. Similarly in Germany Eugen Gomringer published his manifesto &quot;vom vers zur konstellation&quot; (from line to constellation), in which he declared that a poem should be &quot;a reality in itself&quot; rather than a statement about reality, and &quot;as easily understood as signs in airports and traffic signs&quot;. The difficulty in defining such a style is admitted by Houédard&#x27;s statement that &quot;a printed concrete poem is ambiguously both typographic-poetry and poetic-typography&quot;.
Another difficulty of definition is caused by the way such works cross artistic boundaries into the areas of music and sculpture, or can alternatively be defined as sound poetry, visual poetry, found poetry and typewriter art. Henri Chopin&#x27;s work was related to his musical treatment of the word. Kenelm Cox (1927–68) was a kinetic artist &quot;interested in the linear, serial aspects of visual experience but particularly in the process of change,&quot; whose revolving machines transcended the static page in being able to express this. Ian Hamilton Finlay&#x27;s concrete poetry began on the page but then moved increasingly towards three dimensional figuration and afterwards to site-specific art in the creation of his sculpture garden at Little Sparta. The Italian Maurizio Nannucci&#x27;s &quot;Dattilogrammmi&quot; experiments (1964/1965) were also transitional, preluding his move into light art.

Bob Cobbing, who was also a sound poet, had been experimenting with typewriter and duplicator since 1942. Of its possibilities in suggesting the physical dimension of the auditory process, he declared that &quot;One can get the measure of a poem with the typewriter&#x27;s accurate left/right &amp; up &amp; down movements; but superimposition by means of stencil and duplicator enable one to dance to this measure.&quot; Houédard&#x27;s entirely different work was also produced principally on the typewriter but approximates more to painterly and sculptural procedures. So too does that of the American Minimalist artist Carl Andre, beginning from about 1958 and in parallel with his changing artistic procedures. And in Italy Adriano Spatola (1941–88) developed the artistic fragmentation of language using various visual techniques in his &quot;Zeroglifico&quot; (1965/6).

Edwin Morgan&#x27;s experiments with concrete poetry covered several other aspects of it, including elements of found poetry &#x27;discovered&#x27; by misreading and isolating elements from printed sources. &quot;Most people have probably had the experience of scanning a newspaper page quickly and taking a message from it quite different from the intended one. I began looking deliberately for such hidden messages…preferably with the visual or typographical element part of the point.&quot; Another aspect of the search for unintended concordances of meaning emerges in A Humument, the lifework of the visual artist Tom Phillips, who uses painterly and decorative procedures to isolate them on the page.

Despite such blurring of artistic boundaries, concrete poetry can be viewed as taking its place in a predominantly visual tradition stretching over more than two millennia that seeks to draw attention to the word in the space of the page, and to the spaces between words, as an aid to emphasising their significance. In recent years, this approach has led Mario Petrucci to suggest that the &quot;extreme example&quot; of concrete poetry can be seen as nested within the larger concept of &quot;Spatial Form&quot;. Starting from the observation that poetry can usually be told from prose simply by looking at it, this reading of &quot;Spatial Form&quot; encompasses the many aspects of subtle visual significance that are held, for instance, by typeface or in the textures of repeated letters, as well as the more overt visual signals generated by the poem&#x27;s layout.

<doc id="153435" wikidata="Q82949" url="?curid=153435" title="Rocky V">
<text>Rocky V is a 1990 American sports drama film directed by John G. Avildsen and written by and starring Sylvester Stallone. It is the sequel to &quot;Rocky IV&quot; (1985) and the fifth installment in the &quot;Rocky&quot; film series. It also stars Talia Shire, Burt Young, Sage Stallone in his film debut, Tommy Morrison, and Burgess Meredith. In the film, a financially struggling Rocky Balboa (Stallone) agrees to train protégé Tommy Gunn (Morrison) at the gym once owned by Balboa&#x27;s trainer, Mickey Goldmill (Meredith).

Development for the film began in 1989, after Stallone completed the screenplay. Avildsen, who directed the first installment, was soon confirmed to return and principal photography began in January 1990, being largely filmed on location around Philadelphia. The filmmakers encountered creative differences with United Artists and were disallowed to include darker elements of Stallone&#x27;s original screenplay, who had envisioned &quot;Rocky V&quot; as the final film in the franchise.

&quot;Rocky V&quot; was released in the United States on November 16, 1990. The film received mixed reviews from critics, with criticism for its screenplay, characterization, continuity errors, and medical inaccuracies. The film also underperformed expectations at the box office, grossing $120 million worldwide, making it the lowest-grossing film in the series. A sequel, &quot;Rocky Balboa&quot;, was released in 2006.

==Plot==

During the aftermath of his victory over Ivan Drago in Moscow, Rocky finds himself experiencing mental disabilities from the fight. Rocky, his wife Adrian Pennino, his brother-in-law Paulie, and his trainer Tony &quot;Duke&quot; Evers return to the United States where they are greeted by Rocky&#x27;s son, Robert Jr. who is now 14. At a press conference, boxing promoter George Washington Duke attempts to goad Rocky into fighting his boxer, Union Cane, who is the top-rated challenger, but Rocky declines.

After returning home, Rocky and Adrian discover they are bankrupt after Paulie was fooled into signing a &quot;power of attorney&quot; over to Rocky&#x27;s accountant, who embezzled all of his money on real estate deals gone sour and failed to pay Rocky&#x27;s taxes over the previous six years. His mansion has been mortgaged by $400,000, but his attorney tells Rocky that it is fixable with a few more fights. Rocky initially accepts the fight with Cane, but Adrian urges him to see a doctor, and he is diagnosed with cavum septum pellucidum.

Reluctantly, Rocky retires from boxing. His home and belongings are sold to pay the debt and the Balboas move back to their old working-class neighborhood in Philadelphia. Rocky visits Mighty Mick&#x27;s Gym (willed to his son by his old trainer Mickey Goldmill), which has fallen into disrepair. Seeing a vision of himself and Mickey from years past, Rocky draws inspiration to become a trainer himself and reopens the gym.

Rocky and Paulie meet a young fighter from Oklahoma named Tommy Gunn. Rocky agrees to become his manager. Training him gives Rocky a sense of purpose, and Tommy rises to become a top contender. Distracted with Tommy&#x27;s training, Rocky neglects Robert, who is being bullied at school. After learning to defend himself, Robert falls in with the wrong crowd and becomes withdrawn from his family.

Union Cane wins the vacant world heavyweight title. Still wanting to do business with Rocky, Washington showers Tommy with luxuries and promises him that he is the only path to a shot at the title. Rocky insists dealing with Washington will end badly, causing Tommy to desert him. Adrian attempts to comfort Rocky but Rocky vents his frustrations by telling her his life had a new meaning by training Tommy. Adrian tells Rocky that Tommy never had his heart and that was something he could never learn. Realizing that his family is his top priority, Rocky apologizes to Adrian and the two embrace. Rocky then apologizes to Robert and they mend their relationship.

Tommy defeats Cane for the heavyweight title with a first-round knockout, but is jeered by spectators for leaving Rocky and hounded by reporters after the fight. Tommy gives all the credit for his success to George Washington Duke, which only fans the flames of contempt for Tommy by the fans and media. They insist that Cane was nothing but a &quot;paper champion&quot;, because Cane did not win the title from Balboa.

Washington convinces Tommy that he needs to secure a fight with Rocky to refute the notion that he is not the real champion. Washington and Tommy show up at the local bar with a live television crew to goad Rocky into accepting a title fight. Rocky declines and tries to reason with him, but Tommy calls him weak, prompting Paulie to stand up for Rocky. When Tommy punches Paulie, Rocky challenges Tommy to a street fight on the spot; despite Duke&#x27;s objections, Tommy accepts.

Rocky initially knocks Tommy to the ground with a flurry of punches, but Tommy gets up and attacks Rocky from behind. Rocky is beaten down by Tommy, seeing nightmarish visions of Drago, before a vision of Mickey urges him to get up and continue the fight. When Robert and Adrian see the brawl being televised, they rush to the back alley to cheer for Rocky. With Robert, Paulie, Adrian and the neighborhood crowd cheering him on, Rocky makes use of his street-fighting skills and defeats Tommy. While Tommy is escorted away by the police, Washington threatens to sue Rocky if he touches him. After a brief hesitation, Rocky knocks him onto the hood of a car, defiantly replying &quot;Sue me for what?&quot;

Months later, Rocky and Robert climb up the Rocky Steps, see his statue, and are about to go inside and explore the Philadelphia Museum of Art when Rocky gives his son Rocky Marciano&#x27;s cufflink, given to him years earlier as a gift from Mickey.

==Cast==

* Sylvester Stallone as Robert &quot;Rocky&quot; Balboa, &quot;The Italian Stallion&quot;: Heavyweight Champion of the World, who suffers from brain damage caused by the head-trauma he received at the hands of Ivan Drago in the previous film. Because of his injuries, Rocky is forced to officially retire from boxing. After moving back to Philadelphia, Rocky trains and manages underdog boxer Tommy Gunn and helps him to rise to fame. 
* Talia Shire as Adrianna Pennino: Rocky&#x27;s wife and support throughout his life and his boxing career.
* Burt Young as Paulie Pennino: Rocky&#x27;s friend, and brother-in-law.
* Sage Stallone as Robert &quot;Rocky&quot; Balboa Jr.: Rocky and Adrian&#x27;s only son, who gets involved with the wrong crowds during his father&#x27;s absence, throughout the training and mentoring of Tommy Gunn.
* Tommy Morrison as Tommy &quot;The Machine&quot; Gunn: Underdog boxer, who rises to fame under Rocky&#x27;s training. Throughout his career he is called Rocky&#x27;s &quot;shadow&quot;, and angrily seeks out another manager. After his achievements as Heavyweight Champion, and the public&#x27;s continued dis-appreciation for him, he fights Rocky in an unofficial street fight.
* Burgess Meredith as Mickey Goldmill: Rocky&#x27;s deceased friend, manager and trainer, a former bantamweight fighter from the 1920s and the owner of the local boxing gym. Burgess appears in new footage, filmed as a flashback to before Rocky&#x27;s second fight with Apollo.
* Richard Gant as George Washington Duke: Loud and obnoxious boxing promoter, who repeatedly tries to convince Rocky to re-enter the ring. He becomes Tommy Gunn&#x27;s manager during his shot at the Heavyweight Champion title.
* Tony Burton as Tony &quot;Duke&quot; Evers: Rocky&#x27;s friend, and former trainer and manager of Apollo Creed.
* Michael Williams as Union Cane: Reigning Heavyweight Champion of the World who wants to fight legendary Rocky, and eventually fights Tommy Gunn. Williams was also a real-life boxer. He and Morrison were to have an actual match about a month after &quot;Rocky V&quot; was released, but it was canceled when Williams was hurt. The match was being hyped as &quot;The Real Cane vs. Gunn Match.&quot;
* Delia Sheppard as Karen

The film has cameos by sportswriters and boxing analysts, including Al Bernstein, Stan Hochman and Al Meltzer, and sportscaster Stu Nahan, who was the ringside announcer in every &quot;Rocky&quot; movie except the sixth. Dolph Lundgren and Carl Weathers appear as Ivan Drago and Apollo Creed in archival footage, uncredited. Mr. T appears as his &quot;Rocky III&quot; character Clubber Lang in archival footage, uncredited. Hulk Hogan, from his &quot;Rocky III&quot; role as Thunderlips, appears in a still shot during the film&#x27;s end credits sequence taken from the staredown the two engaged in during said film, also uncredited.

Jodi Letizia, who played street kid Marie in the original &quot;Rocky&quot; (1976), was supposed to reprise her role. Her character was shown to have ended up as Rocky predicted she would: a prostitute, but the scene ended up on the cutting room floor. She can briefly be seen during the street fight at the end.

Kevin Connolly, who gained success as Eric Murphy on HBO&#x27;s &quot;Entourage&quot;, was in his first acting role as neighborhood bully Chickie.

==Production==
===Filming===
Filming began in mid-January 1990. Some of the fight sequences were filmed at The Blue Horizon in Philadelphia, a venue which was a mecca for boxing in the city during the 1970s.

The Rocky statue, which was commissioned for &quot;Rocky III&quot;, had since been gifted to the city of Philadelphia and moved to the entrance of the Spectrum, and so had to be moved back to the Philadelphia Museum of Art for the filming.

Scenes with Mickey, played by Burgess Meredith, were trimmed in the final film when Rocky fights Tommy. Mickey appeared in ghost form on top of the railway bridge, giving words of encouragement. In the final film, this was made into flashbacks. The speech Mickey gives to Rocky in the flashback sequence is based on an interview with Cus D&#x27;Amato given in 1985, shortly after Mike Tyson&#x27;s first professional bout.

In the original script, Rocky is killed during the final fight with Tommy, dying in Adrian&#x27;s arms in the street. The ending, which had Adrian eulogize Rocky by saying, &quot;As long as there are people willing to meet challenges of life and not surrender until their dreams become realities, the world will always have their Rockys&quot;, would not come to pass. Producer Irwin Winkler and Avildsen were not big on the ending, with the former stating that it was never shot while also stating that Stallone eventually was convinced to change the ending.

===Continuity===
In the years following the film&#x27;s release, Stallone acknowledged that the injury which forces Rocky to retire, referenced in the film as a potentially lethal form of &#x27;brain damage&#x27;, was inaccurate. Stallone stated that having discussed the story with many boxing medical professionals, the injury Rocky suffered was a milder form of brain damage, similar to that of a long term concussion that many boxers suffer from and by modern-day standards are still able to gain licenses to box. It would not have prevented Rocky from gaining a license to box nor killed him.

==Reception==
===Box office===
Anticipated to be one of the big hits of the 1990 holiday season, &quot;Rocky V&quot; finished second in its opening weekend, trailing behind &quot;Home Alone&quot; and it never recovered despite it did managed to beat &quot;The Rescuers Down Under&quot; during its opening weekend at the box office by earning $14 million compared to &quot;Down Under&#x27;s&quot; $3.5 million. The film earned $41 million in the domestic box office less than &quot;Rocky IV&quot; &#x27;s $127 million but it was financially successful in the international box office earning $79 million for a total of $120 million worldwide and ultimately grossing less than &quot;Rocky IV&quot; &#x27;s $300 million.

===Critical response===
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes the film has a 32% approval rating based on 38 reviews, with an average rating of 4.2/10. The website&#x27;s consensus is that &quot;&quot;Rocky V&quot;″s attempts to recapture the original&#x27;s working-class grit are as transparently phony as each of the thuddingly obvious plot developments in a misguided installment that sent the franchise flailing into longterm limbo.&quot; On Metacritic it has a score of 55 out of 100, based on review from 16 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews.&quot; Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

In 1999, &quot;Time&quot; placed the film on a list of the 100 worst ideas of the 20th century.

Upon its release, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; regarded it as the best of the &quot;Rocky&quot; sequels.

Stallone has publicly expressed hatred towards &quot;Rocky V&quot;, giving it a 0 out of 10.

===Accolades===
It was nominated for seven Golden Raspberry Awards in 1990 including Worst Picture, Worst Actor and Worst Screenplay for Stallone, Worst Actress for Shire, Worst Supporting Actor for Young, Worst Director for Avildsen and Worst Original Song for &quot;The Measure of a Man&quot;.

==Sequel==

Sixteen years later, Stallone wrote, directed and starred in the film &quot;Rocky Balboa&quot;. Stallone suggested that advances in medical science during the period between the films had shown that the injuries mentioned in &quot;Rocky V&quot; were less debilitating than once thought, and that he would receive a &quot;clean bill of health&quot; by the time of &quot;Rocky Balboa&quot;, allowing him to box again.

== Video games ==
In 2002, a video game called &quot;Rocky&quot;, based on the first five &quot;Rocky&quot; films, was released by Rage Software.

Venom Games released a sequel, &quot;Rocky Legends&quot; (2004), which expanded on the story of the first four films.

<doc id="153436" wikidata="Q743187" url="?curid=153436" title="Mario Party 3">
<text>is a party video game developed by Hudson Soft and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64. The third installment in the &quot;Mario Party&quot; series, it was first released in Japan on December 7, 2000, in North America on May 7, 2001, in Australia on September 3, 2001, and in Europe on November 16, 2001. As with the previous installments, the player chooses between eight playable characters: Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Yoshi, Wario, and Donkey Kong from the first two games, alongside newcomers Princess Daisy and Waluigi. The game features duel maps, where two players try to lower each other&#x27;s stamina to zero using non-player characters such as Chain Chomps.

&quot;Mario Party 3&quot; was the final first-party Nintendo 64 game released in North America. It was followed by &quot;Mario Party 4&quot; for the GameCube in 2002. Content from &quot;Mario Party 3&quot; was remastered as part of &quot;Mario Party: The Top 100&quot; for the Nintendo 3DS and &quot;Mario Party Superstars&quot; for the Nintendo Switch, released on November 10, 2017, and October 29, 2021, respectively. The game received its first official re-release on the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack on October 27, 2023.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Mario Party 3&quot; is a party video game featuring eight playable characters of the &quot;Mario&quot; franchise: Mario, Luigi, Yoshi, Wario, Princess Peach, and Donkey Kong are available to play in all modes, while newcomers Princess Daisy and Waluigi are unavailable in the game&#x27;s Story Mode. In the game&#x27;s storyline, Mario and his friends witness the descent of the Millennium Star, a mystical star born once every thousand years that allows whoever possesses him to become the &quot;Superstar of the universe&quot;. When the group begins to debate the Star&#x27;s ownership, the Star transports the group into a large toy box and proclaims that the group members must prove their worthiness and earn the Millennium Star&#x27;s acceptance by collecting the seven &quot;Star Stamps&quot; scattered across several lands. The gameplay is presented in the form of a traditional board game, and includes five themed game board maps. &quot;Mario Party 3&quot; includes multiplayer compatibility; each game on a board map consists of four players, including at least one human player and up to four. Any character who is not controlled by a human will instead be controlled by the game as a computer-controlled character. The skill level of the computer-controlled characters can be individually adjusted between &quot;Easy&quot;, &quot;Medium&quot;, or &quot;Hard&quot;. After the players and board map have been determined, the player chooses how long the board map game will last: &quot;Lite Play&quot; consists of 20 turns, &quot;Standard Play&quot; consists of 35, and &quot;Full Play&quot; consists of 50. The player can also set a &quot;Custom Play&quot; that consists of any number of turns between 10 and 50, but restricted to multiples of 5. Upon starting a board, players each hit a dice block to determine turn order, with the highest number going first on each turn and the lowest number going last.

The goal of &quot;Mario Party 3&quot; is to collect the most Stars within the allotted amount of turns. Stars must be purchased from the Millennium Star with coins, which can be earned through a selection from one of 70 mini-games that is played once at the end of each turn. Each time a Star is purchased, the Millennium Star will move to a different location on the board. The first player initiates a turn by rolling a dice block that determines how many spaces they will advance on the board, ranging from one to ten spaces. Each board map has a variety of spaces. Plain blue and red spaces cause the player who lands on one to respectively gain or lose three coins; the amount of coins is doubled to six during the final five turns. Red spaces marked with an insignia of Bowser&#x27;s head will cause Bowser to appear and hinder the player&#x27;s progress. Green &quot;!&quot; spaces will initiate a single-player Chance Time mini-game, in which selected characters must give or exchange coins or stars; the player who landed on the space is given three blocks to hit, determining which characters and prize will be involved. Green spaces marked with a Goomba initiate a four-player Battle mini-game, in which coins are taken from the players and the winner receives the majority of the accumulated coins. Green &quot;?&quot; spaces result in an event occurring on the board map; each board features different events which can help or hinder certain players. When a player passes a green space marked with a bag of coins, they must deposit five coins into a &quot;Koopa Bank&quot;; players who land right on the space can withdraw all of the coins that have been deposited. Green spaces marked with a Shy Guy initiate a single-player Game Guy mini-game, in which the player may either win a multiplied amount of their coins or lose all of their coins.

The players can obtain items for use on the board, and can each carry up to three at a time. If a player is carrying an item, they can use it before rolling the dice block. Items can aid the player in such ways as providing additional dice blocks or stealing another player&#x27;s item. One item, the Skeleton Key, allows the player to use shortcuts located on each board map. Items can be purchased from shops on the board or won from special single-player mini-games initiated by landing on green spaces marked with Toad&#x27;s head. Boo appears in certain locations of the map, and can steal coins or a Star from another player on behalf of any player who passes him; stealing coins costs five coins, while stealing a Star costs 50 coins. If a player is targeted for their coins, they can limit the amount of coins that Boo steals by repeatedly tapping the A button.

After all four players have made a movement on the board, a mini-game is initiated. The type of mini-game that is played is determined based on the color of space that each player landed on. Players that have landed on a green space will be randomly assigned either red or blue as their color before the mini-game is selected. If all players are the same color, a 4-player mini-game is played. If players are on separate colors, they will split into teams and play either a 1 vs. 3 or 2 vs. 2 mini-game. The specific mini-game is then selected via roulette. Before the mini-game&#x27;s initiation, players can review the rules and controls as well as practice the mini-game. Coins are rewarded based on the results of the mini-game, with the winner(s) receiving ten coins. Another turn is initiated following the end of a mini-game, and the process is repeated until the allotted number of turns have been completed.

During the final five turns of a game, a one-on-one Duel mini-game is initiated when a player lands on the same space as another. Duels can be initiated prior to the final five turns if a player uses the Dueling Glove item. After the end of the last turn, if bonuses are toggled on, the winners of three awards are announced, with each winner receiving one additional Star; the first two awards are given to the player(s) who collected the most coins in mini-games and throughout the board map game, and the third is given to the player(s) who landed on the most &quot;?&quot; spaces. The winner of the game is then determined by the number of total coins and Stars collected by each player. If two or more characters have acquired the same amount of coins and Stars, the winner will be determined with a roll of the dice block.

===Other modes===
&quot;Mario Party 3&quot; includes a Duel mode, in which two players use a selection of up to two partners to attack their opponent and deplete their health. The partners can be positioned in front of or behind the player, and must be paid a salary at the beginning of each turn; the partner will leave if their salary cannot be paid. The mode can either be played in 20 turns or for an indefinite amount of turns until one of the players&#x27; health is depleted.

The partners do the battling to reduce the opponent&#x27;s health, and defend the player from incoming attack. Each partner has its own health, and if it reaches zero, they disappear, and if the attacking partner deals more damage than the defending partner can take, the player takes damage equal to the difference. If no partner is between the attacking partner and the opponent, they take all the damage directly. The characters cannot attack their opponent directly. Some of the partners&#x27; attacks cannot be protected against, and each partner costs a certain number of coins for the player to keep it, and if the player has two partners, their salary combines. Occasionally, if a partner is attacked by the opponent&#x27;s partner, the attack will miss. When the turn count expires, the winner is decided, and it is whoever has more health left. The game will end before the turn count expires if either player&#x27;s health hits 0. If the turn count expires and both players have the same amount of health, whoever has the most coins wins. If both their health and coins numbers are the same, which is rare, the game ends in a draw.

Duel mini-games and Game Guy mini-games are the only mini-games available to be played on a duel board. Unlike Battle Royale, they do not occur after every turn, but only if either player lands on a mini-game space. There is also a part of each map that makes the players play a duel mini game for 20, 30 or 40 coins after it is passed five times. Game Guy mini-games occur more often here than in Battle Royale. Items are not present in Duel mode.

In the Story Mode to the series, one player starts a campaign through every board, challenging computer controlled opponents at a shortened version of Party Mode. The player&#x27;s objective is to defeat the other characters and earn stamps from the Millennium Star. After all seven stamps are acquired the player is challenged to a final duel with the Millennium Star, in which the player must hit the Millennium Star three times (six times on Normal difficulty and nine on Hard difficulty) with stars in order to complete story mode. Each time the player completes an objective, they are given a rank of S to C depending on how well they completed that objective. When all the objectives have been completed, a title representing the player&#x27;s overall progress in the game is awarded. This is determined by the ranks they earned for each objective. If enough &quot;S&quot; ranks are acquired, that character becomes a &quot;Miracle Star&quot; and the Game Guy Room in the Mini Game House is opened for use. Simply beating the Story Mode and not earning a high title will cause the character&#x27;s face to be sculpted into the mountain.

==Development==
Like prior games in the &quot;Mario Party&quot; franchise, &quot;Mario Party 3&quot; was developed by Hudson Soft and published by Nintendo. It is the first &quot;Mario Party&quot; game to have multiple save slots and the first to have Princess Daisy and Waluigi as playable characters. On August 9, 2000, it was revealed to have 70 new mini games. Later that month, Nintendo released 12 more screenshots of the game&#x27;s adventure boards. The game was about 70% completed during the time being.

The game had a marketing budget of $4 million.

==Reception==
&quot;Mario Party 3&quot; received &quot;mixed or average&quot; reviews from critics, according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. While &quot;GamePro&quot; calling it &quot;one of the last and best games you can play on the system with up to three buddies&quot;, other reviewers were critical of &quot;Mario Party 3&quot; for largely using the same gameplay as the previous installments, with only minimal changes. Critics stated that the game was best when played with friends. &quot;NGC Magazine&quot; wrote, &quot;Playing against the CPU is one of the most frustrating exercises known to man.&quot;

Other common points, both positive and negative, included the mini-games, new features, and how the title compared to previous entries. Gavin Frankle of &quot;AllGame&quot; called &quot;Mario Party 3&quot; the most enjoyable in the series, reasoning that it &quot;provides enough to entice new fans and satisfy existing ones&quot;. However, he also noted it &quot;does little to further the genre or remedy the problems that have been around since the first game.&quot; &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; described the mini-games as &quot;the real life of the party&quot;, and Joe Fielder of &quot;GameSpot&quot; and Cam Shea of &quot;Hyper&quot; claimed &quot;Mario Party 3&quot; had the best mini-games in the series. However, the opinions towards them ranged from a few being &quot;stinkers&quot;, to many being senseless, boring, and &quot;just plain stupid&quot;. Shea as well as Dr. Moo of &quot;GameRevolution&quot; also praised the duel mode, Shea reasoning that it alongside the item site was two of the title&#x27;s lacking number of gameplay variants. Dr. Moo wrote that the mini-games make up for some of the game&#x27;s faults. However, Shea and Dr. Moo was critical of the series&#x27; usual incorporation of random luck, as well as having to wait for computer-controlled opponents. One negative comment among the &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; staff review was that &quot;it seems like many of the challenges are based on overcoming unresponsive controls.&quot;

Fielder considered the graphics similar to the previous games and wrote that they &quot;look as good as they need to for this kind of game, but are certainly not going to win it any awards.&quot; Fran Mirabella III of &quot;IGN&quot; stated that the game &quot;uses the same bright colors, low-resolution textures, and choppy animation that the rest have.&quot; Fielder considered the soundtrack to be a slight improvement over the previous games. Mirabella considered the music &quot;just as outdated as the graphics,&quot; but also called it &quot;very cute&quot; and wrote that it &quot;does the job of keeping your ears occupied in the cheesiest of ways.&quot;

In 2015, &quot;IGN&quot; listed the game at number one on its list of &quot;Best Mario Party Games,&quot; writing, &quot;The best Mario Party games know the balance between luck and skill, and Mario Party 3 best exemplifies this rule. Just about everything that made Mario Party 2 so great was pushed further as Mario Party 3 introduced even more strategic items, creative new boards, and some truly fun minigames.&quot; &quot;The Gamer&quot; also placed &quot;Mario Party 3&quot; first in its ranking of 17 &quot;Mario Party&quot; games, praising its boards, minigames, and visuals.

The game sold over 1,000,000 units worldwide; however, largely due to being released late in the Nintendo 64&#x27;s lifespan, it did not sell well in western regions.

===Awards===
&quot;Mario Party 3&quot; won the &quot;Console Family&quot; award from the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences during the 5th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards.

<text>Super Mario Land is a 1989 platform game developed and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy. Released as a launch title for the system, it is the first &quot;Mario&quot; platform game to have been released for a handheld console (not including the earlier Game &amp; Watch). In gameplay similar to that of the 1985 &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;, but resized for the smaller device&#x27;s screen, the player advances Mario to the end of 12 levels by moving to the right and jumping across platforms to avoid enemies and pitfalls. Unlike the other &quot;Mario&quot; games, &quot;Super Mario Land&quot; is set in Sarasaland, a new environment depicted in line art, and Mario attempts to save Princess Daisy in her debut appearance in the series. The game has two &quot;Gradius&quot;-style shooter levels.

At Nintendo CEO Hiroshi Yamauchi&#x27;s request, Game Boy creator Gunpei Yokoi&#x27;s Nintendo R&amp;D1 developed a &quot;Mario&quot; game to sell the new console. It is the first handheld console &quot;Mario&quot; game and the first to be made without Mario creator and Yokoi protégé Shigeru Miyamoto. Accordingly, the development team shrunk gameplay elements for the device and used some elements inconsistently from the series. &quot;Super Mario Land&quot; was expected to showcase the console until Nintendo of America bundled &quot;Tetris&quot;. The game launched alongside the Game Boy first in Japan in April 1989, and later worldwide. &quot;Super Mario Land&quot; was rereleased for the Nintendo 3DS via Virtual Console in 2011, and on the Nintendo Switch Online service in 2024, which features some presentation tweaks.

The game was lauded by critics, who were satisfied with the franchise&#x27;s transition to the Game Boy, but they also noted its short length. This was in reference to both contemporaneous and retrospective reviewers, who particularly praised its soundtrack. The handheld console became an immediate success and more than 25 million copies of &quot;Super Mario Land&quot; were sold, more than &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot;. The game received two sequels, including &quot;Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins&quot; (1992) and &quot;Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3&quot; (1994), the latter of which would later be spun-off into its own sub-series, &quot;Wario Land&quot;. &quot;Super Mario Land&quot; has been included in several top Game Boy game lists and debuted Princess Daisy as a recurring &quot;Mario&quot; series character.

==Gameplay==

As a side-scrolling platform game and the first in the &quot;Super Mario Land&quot; series, &quot;Super Mario Land&quot; is similar in gameplay to the &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; series. As Mario, the player advances to the end of the level by moving to the right and jumping across platforms to avoid enemies and pitfalls, the screen only scrolls to the right, as the player advances, but will not scroll back to the left, and sections of a level that have passed off screen cannot be revisited. Mario travels to Sarasaland to save Princess Daisy from Tatanga, an evil spaceman. Two of the game&#x27;s twelve levels are &quot;forced-scrolling&quot; &quot;Gradius&quot;-style shooters where Mario helms a submarine or airplane and fires projectiles towards oncoming enemies, destructible blocks and bosses. Levels end with a platforming challenge to reach an alternative exit located above the regular exit, the former leading to a bonus minigame styled after a Ghost Leg lottery that awards 1 to 3 extra lives or a Superball Flower power-up.

Unlike the other &quot;Mario&quot; games, which take place in the Mushroom Kingdom, &quot;Super Mario Land&quot; is set in Sarasaland and drawn in line art. Mario pursues Princess Daisy, in her debut, rather than the series standard damsel in distress, Princess Peach. When jumped on, Koopa shells explode after a small delay, Mario throws bouncing balls rather than fireballs (referred to as &quot;Superballs&quot; in the manual), 1-Up Mushroom power-ups are depicted as hearts, and the level-end flagpoles are replaced with a platforming challenge. Compared to &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;, which contains 32 levels subdivided into 8 &quot;worlds&quot; with 4 levels each, &quot;Super Mario Land&quot; is smaller, with 12 levels subdivided into 4 &quot;worlds&quot; with 3 levels each. There are five unique bosses, one at the end of each of the four worlds, and a fifth and final boss being Tatanga, who appears when the fourth boss is defeated. The first three bosses may be destroyed with projectiles, or the player may move past them to the exit without destroying them first; the last level has no regular exit, and the two bosses at the end of that level must be destroyed with projectiles to complete the level and the game. Some elements recur from the previous &quot;Mario&quot; games, such as blocks suspended in midair, moving platforms that must be used to traverse pitfalls, pipes that lead to other areas, collectible coins that grant an extra life when 100 are collected, and Goomba enemies. After the player has completed the game they may play through again on a harder mode, in which the levels are the same apart from enemies being more numerous; if the player completes the harder mode, the game allows the player to start another play on any level in the game.

==Development==
&quot;Super Mario Land&quot; was developed by Nintendo R&amp;D1 and published by Nintendo in 1989 as a launch game for its Game Boy handheld console. Nintendo CEO Hiroshi Yamauchi believed that fun games promote console sales, so when the company created the Game Boy, he wanted a fun game featuring Nintendo&#x27;s mascot, Mario. The task came to Nintendo R&amp;D1, a development team led by Game Boy inventor Gunpei Yokoi. Yokoi had previously created the Game &amp; Watch series and worked with his protégé, Shigeru Miyamoto, on the game that introduced Mario, &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;. &quot;Super Mario Land&quot; is the fourth &quot;Super Mario&quot; game, the first portable Mario game, and the first in the series to be made without Miyamoto.

Absent Miyamoto&#x27;s direction, the development team used elements new and inconsistent with the series as &quot;Super Mario Land&quot; shrunk elements of the series to fit the portable device&#x27;s small screen. Yokoi, the head of R&amp;D1, served as producer, and Satoru Okada served as director. They had previously developed &quot;Metroid&quot; (1986) and &quot;Kid Icarus&quot; (1986) together, and the two subsequently designed the Game Boy—Yokoi on its industrial design, and Okada on its engineering. Their &quot;Super Mario Land&quot; was planned as the portable console&#x27;s showcase title until Henk Rogers brought &quot;Tetris&quot; to Nintendo of America and convinced Minoru Arakawa that the addictive computer game would help Nintendo reach the largest audience. The company subsequently chose to bundle &quot;Tetris&quot; with every Game Boy purchase.

The Game Boy was released in Japan in April 1989, North America in July, and Europe in September 1990, and &quot;Super Mario Land&quot; became a launch game. Its official first release was on April 21, 1989, in Japan, and its North American release followed in August. About 22 years later, &quot;Super Mario Land&quot; was released for the Nintendo 3DS via Virtual Console on June 6, 2011, as one of its first games. Its new features include an increased size (about 60 percent zoom) and an optional &quot;shades of green&quot; color palette to match the effect of the original Game Boy&#x27;s monochrome. The game was released on the Nintendo Switch Online service on May 15, 2024.

==Reception==
===Sales===
Following the Game Boy&#x27;s &quot;overnight success&quot;, &quot;Super Mario Land&quot; became the second best-selling 1989 release in North America (below Nintendo&#x27;s Tetris). &quot;Super Mario Land&quot; went on to sell more than 25 million copies—more than that of &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; (1988).

In the United States, the game topped Babbage&#x27;s Game Boy sales charts for two months in 1992, from August to September.

===Contemporary reviews===
Many critics saw &quot;Super Mario Land&quot; as a &quot;smaller&quot; and shorter version of &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; At the time of its release in 1989, reviewers were excited to have a portable &quot;Mario&quot; game. Paul Rand of &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; called the game &quot;an arcade machine in your pocket&quot; and the graphics &quot;remarkable&quot; for their size. French games magazine &quot;Player One&quot; said that &quot;Super Mario Land&quot; adequately compromised where necessary to bring Mario to a portable device. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;″s Steve Harris considered the game &quot;fantastic&quot; and &quot;very fun to play&quot;, though short. Ed Semrad and Donn Nauert of the same outlet both declared &quot;Super Mario Land&quot; &quot;easily the best Game Boy cart&quot; of the time.

Tony Mott of &quot;Superplay&quot; said the game proved that Nintendo&#x27;s Game Boy &quot;had playability to match&quot; its competitors. Matt Regan of &quot;Mean Machines&quot; agreed: &quot;Playability to the nth degree!&quot;. British magazines &quot;Mean Machines&quot; and &quot;The Games Machine&quot; both commented on the many secrets to find. &quot;Player One&quot; too complimented the music. &quot;Player One&quot; further pronounced &quot;Super Mario Land&quot; a &quot;masterpiece&quot;, &quot;the pinnacle of portable video gaming&quot;.

===Retrospective reviews===
&quot;IGN&quot;″s Lucas Thomas wrote that the protagonist, enemies, and overall game were shorter, and noted that Mario himself was just 12 pixels in height on the Game Boy&#x27;s small screen. With this in mind, Thomas was concerned about player &quot;eyestrain&quot; in rereleases of the game. Still, &quot;IGN&quot;″s Levi Buchanan thought the game made no compromises in its size reduction. &quot;Complex&quot;″s Gus Turner wrote that the graphics were &quot;simple&quot;, and &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot; said the game was &quot;ridiculously short&quot;. &quot;Eurogamer&quot; reported that the game could be finished in under an hour.

&quot;Complex&quot;″s Gus Turner wrote that the game had the fun, intuitiveness, and difficulty associated with the series. &quot;Eurogamer&quot;″s Chris Schilling called Hirokazu Tanaka&#x27;s soundtrack &quot;surely one of the all-time greats&quot;, and &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot; said it was among the &quot;greatest videogame music ever composed&quot;. &quot;Eurogamer&quot; and &quot;Complex&quot; too complimented the music.

==Legacy==
The game began a &quot;Super Mario Land&quot; series of portable Mario games. &quot;Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins&quot; added a non-linear overworld and introduced villain Wario, an evil version of Mario. The subsequent &quot;Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3&quot; began the &quot;Wario&quot; franchise. After 19 years, the 2011 game &quot;Super Mario 3D Land&quot; for the Nintendo 3DS became Mario&#x27;s first game in stereoscopic 3D. Audrey Drake of &quot;IGN&quot; argued that both &quot;Wario Land&quot; and &quot;Super Mario 3D Land&quot; are not &quot;legitimate sequels&quot;, and wrote that the latter seems more like &quot;&quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; with &quot;Mario Galaxy&quot; influences&quot; than a successor to &quot;Super Mario Land 2&quot;. The &quot;Superball Flower&quot; appears in &quot;Super Mario Maker 2&quot; as an unlockable power-up item, usable only in the &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; style.

&quot;Super Mario Land&quot; is remembered for its miniaturized &quot;Super Mario&quot; elements and &quot;twist on just about every Mario mainstay imaginable&quot;. Many of its new elements do not recur later in the series, making &quot;Super Mario Land&quot; strange compared to the rest of the series, or what &quot;IGN&quot;″s Thomas described as a &quot;singular oddball&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot;″s Marc Nix said retrospectively that &quot;Super Mario Land&quot; was the only uninspired &quot;Mario&quot; game, with &quot;funky voids of white&quot; and UFOs instead of the &quot;strikingly original&quot; Mushroom Kingdom. &quot;Mean Machines&quot; was also put off by the alien theme, easy difficulty, and dot matrix screen blur. &quot;IGN&quot;″s Travis Fahs wrote that the game was comparatively not as &quot;ambitious&quot; as &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot;. &quot;Mean Machines&quot; said it was not &quot;a true &quot;Mario&quot; game&quot;, not worth its originally high review score, and &quot;in retrospect, not really a classic&quot;. Glen Fox of &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; agreed, writing that it was an impressive achievement at the time but did not age as well as other &quot;Mario&quot; games.

&quot;Eurogamer&quot;″s Schilling wrote that Mario felt different—lighter, with more friction—and that the game felt &quot;radical and distinctive&quot; for the risks it took. &quot;IGN&quot;″s Thomas cited &quot;out of place&quot; gameplay elements like the shooter levels, exploding Koopa shells, non-extinguishing fireballs, and non-Princess Peach plot as departures from the series. Thomas attributed this to &quot;Mario&quot; creator Miyamoto&#x27;s lack of involvement in the game&#x27;s development, which he described as &quot;famously hands-off&quot;. Schilling of &quot;Eurogamer&quot; instead blamed the Game Boy&#x27;s technical limitations. But he too was perplexed by the new sphinx, seahorse, and Moai head enemies, and considered the exploding Koopa shells a &quot;cruel trick&quot; disdainful of the series&#x27; core gameplay. &quot;Super Mario Land&quot;″s shooter levels, new to the series, were not revisited in subsequent &quot;Super Mario&quot; games except the &quot;Maker&quot; games. Subsequent series games such as &quot;Super Mario Land 2&quot; both dropped the original&#x27;s tiny scale and chose the classic fire flower fireballs over the first installment&#x27;s bouncing balls.

The game was included in multiple rankings of top Game Boy games, and &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot; listed it at 73 in its top 100 Nintendo games. After her debut in &quot;Super Mario Land&quot;, Princess Daisy appears in later &quot;Mario&quot; series sports and racing games.

===Popular music===

The song &quot;Supermarioland&quot; (1992) by British group Ambassadors of Funk was inspired by the game and became a novelty hit, appearing in the UK top ten charts. Simon Harris, the mastermind behind Ambassadors of Funk, said that he initially had no intention to create &quot;Super Mario&quot;-themed compositions, but after his friend introduced him to Nintendo&#x27;s Game Boy console, he became fond of the theme music from &quot;Super Mario Land&quot;, composed by Hirokazu Tanaka. He realised that the songs on the game&#x27;s score had a similar tempo to house music, so he was able to incorporate the samples into &quot;Supermarioland&quot; easily, recruiting Einstein to provide the rap vocals. After Harris created the track, he contacted Nintendo to clear the music samples, and the company, liking what Harris had done, also requested that he and Einstein record an album of &quot;Super Mario&quot; material. Nintendo UK quickly began to promote and market &quot;Supermarioland&quot;, even providing an actor for the music video, but Nintendo of America was difficult to contact, and the track was never released in the United States. Mario&#x27;s designer, Shigeru Miyamoto, approved the project, and the album, titled &quot;Super Mario Compact Disco&quot;, was released in Japan in August 1993, featuring tracks from other Mario games such as &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; and &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot;.

=== Fan-made remake ===

A homebrew for Super Nintendo Entertainment System called &quot;New Super Mario Land&quot; came to light in 2019 after a series of posts on Twitter by a user named ChronoMoogle. The remake features enhanced visuals, music and a multiplayer mode for up to 4 players. According to its creator, who gave an interview to &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; while asking to remain anonymous, the remake was built totally from scratch (hence, no ROM hacking was performed) using Assembly language, a few tools for graphics and sound and a Super Nintendo emulator for testing. After developing the game, the creator flashed the game in thirty Nintendo Power cartridges and distributed them to his &quot;Nintendo-loving friends&quot; as a Christmas gift to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the original game. The creator no longer has involvement with the game, stating that &quot;the project is terminated already&quot; after sending the gift cartridges.

<doc id="153448" wikidata="Q1205676" url="?curid=153448" title="Mario Party 2">
<text>is a 1999 party video game developed by Hudson Soft and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64. The second game in the &quot;Mario Party&quot; series, it was released in Japan in December 1999 and worldwide in 2000. The game received mostly positive reviews from critics, who praised the improvements over the original, as well as the multiplayer and minigames, but criticized the lack of originality, while graphics received a better but otherwise mixed response.

&quot;Mario Party 2&quot; features six playable characters: Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Yoshi, Wario, and Donkey Kong from the &quot;Mario&quot; series and the original &quot;Mario Party&quot;, who can be directed as characters on various themed game boards. The objective is to earn the most stars of all players on the board; stars are obtained by purchase from a single predefined space on the game board. Each character&#x27;s movement is determined by a roll of a die, with a roll from each player forming a single turn. Each turn in &quot;Mario Party 2&quot; is followed by a minigame, which is competed to earn coins for the character, used to buy items and stars.

&quot;Mario Party 2&quot; was followed by &quot;Mario Party 3&quot; in 2000 and was later re-released on the Wii Virtual Console in 2010, for the Wii U Virtual Console in North America in 2016, and on the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack in 2022. Content from &quot;Mario Party 2&quot; was remastered as part of &quot;Mario Party: The Top 100&quot; for the Nintendo 3DS, &quot;Mario Party Superstars&quot; and &quot;Super Mario Party Jamboree&quot; for the Nintendo Switch.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Mario Party 2&quot; is a party video game featuring six playable characters: Mario, Luigi, Yoshi, Wario, Princess Peach, and Donkey Kong. In the game&#x27;s frame story, Mario and his friends create a world built from their dreams and get into a debate over who the new world would be named after. When Bowser arrives and invades the land, the group takes Toad&#x27;s suggestion to name it after the &quot;Super Star&quot; who defeats Bowser. The gameplay is presented in the form of a traditional board game, and includes five themed game boards. A sixth board map becomes available later in the game. &quot;Mario Party 2&quot; includes multiplayer compatibility; each game on a board map consists of four players, including at least one human player and up to four. Any character who is not controlled by a human will instead be controlled by the game as a computer-controlled character. The skill level of the computer-controlled characters can be individually adjusted between &quot;Easy&quot;, &quot;Medium&quot;, or &quot;Hard&quot;. After the players and board map have been determined, the player chooses how long the board map game will last: &quot;Lite Play&quot; consists of 20 turns, &quot;Standard Play&quot; consists of 35, and &quot;Full Play&quot; consists of 50. Upon starting a board, players each hit a dice block to determine turn order, with the highest number going first on each turn and the lowest number going last.

The goal of &quot;Mario Party 2&quot; is to collect the most Stars within the allotted amount of turns. Stars must be purchased from Toad with coins, which can be earned through a selection from one of 65 mini-games that is played once at the end of each turn. Each time a Star is purchased, Toad will move to a different location on the board. The first player initiates a turn by rolling a dice block that determines how many spaces they will advance on the board, ranging from one to ten spaces. Each board map has a variety of spaces. Plain blue and red spaces cause the player who lands on one to respectively gain or lose three coins; the amount of coins is doubled to six during the final five turns. Some blue spaces have hidden blocks that reward extra coins or even a star to the player who lands on them. Green &quot;!&quot; spaces will initiate a single-player Chance Time mini-game, in which selected characters must give or exchange coins or stars; the player who landed on the space is given three blocks to hit, determining which characters and prize will be involved. Green &quot;?&quot; spaces result in an event occurring on the board map; each board features different events which can help or hinder certain players. Red spaces marked with an insignia of Bowser&#x27;s head will cause Bowser to appear and hinder the player&#x27;s progress. When a player passes a green space marked with a bag of coins, they must deposit five coins into a &quot;Koopa Bank&quot;; players who land right on the space can withdraw all of the coins that have been deposited. Green spaces marked with a lightning bolt initiate a four-player Battle mini-game, in which coins are taken from the players and the winner receives the majority of the accumulated coins.

The players can obtain items for use on the board, and can each carry one at a time. If a player is carrying an item, they can use it before rolling the dice block. Items can aid the player in such ways as providing additional dice blocks or stealing another player&#x27;s item. One item, the Skeleton Key, allows the player to use shortcuts located on each board map. Items can be purchased from shops on the board or won from special single-player mini-games initiated by landing on green spaces marked with a treasure chest. Aside from Toad, Baby Bowser and Boo also appear on the map. Baby Bowser will take five coins from any character who passes him. One certain item, the Bowser Bomb, will automatically transform Baby Bowser into Bowser at the end of the turn in which it was received. When this occurs, Bowser will hit three dice blocks and move the total number of spaces shown. Any character within Bowser&#x27;s path will lose all of their coins. Boo can steal coins or a Star from another player on behalf of any player who passes him; stealing coins costs five coins, while stealing a Star costs 50 coins. If a player is targeted for their coins, they can limit the amount of coins that Boo steals by repeatedly tapping the A button.

After all four players have made a movement on the board, a mini-game is initiated. The type of mini-game that is played is determined based on the color of space that each player landed on. Players that have landed on a green space will be randomly assigned to &quot;blue&quot; or &quot;red&quot; status before the mini-game is selected. If all players have landed on the same color of space, a 4-player mini-game is played. Other color variations result in either a 1 vs. 3 or 2 vs. 2 mini-game. The specific mini-game is then selected via roulette. Before the mini-game&#x27;s initiation, the human player(s) can review the rules and controls as well as practice the mini-game. Coins are rewarded based on the results of the mini-game, with the winner(s) receiving ten coins. Another turn is initiated following the end of a mini-game, and the process is repeated until the allotted number of turns have been completed.

During the final five turns of a game, a one-on-one Duel mini-game is initiated when a player lands on the same space as another. Duels can be initiated prior to the final five turns if a player uses the Dueling Glove item. After the end of the last turn, the winners of three awards are announced, with each winner receiving one additional Star; the first two awards are given to the player(s) who collected the most coins in mini-games and throughout the board map game, and the third is given to the player(s) who landed on the most &quot;?&quot; spaces. The winner of the game, the &quot;Super Star&quot;, is then determined by the number of total coins and Stars collected by each player. If two or more characters have acquired the same amount of coins and Stars, the winner will be determined with a roll of the dice block. If the player toggles the &quot;No Bonus&quot; setting prior to the start of a game, the hidden blocks will be omitted from the board, and the extra awards will not be presented at the end of the game.

===Other modes===
The game&#x27;s main menu includes a &quot;Coin Box&quot; at which coins received by the human player during gameplay are deposited. Coins can be used to purchase mini-games from the tree Woody, which can then be played at any time outside of normal board games. After a set number of mini-games have been purchased from Woody, two modes become available for play: the multiplayer Mini-Game Stadium and the single-player Mini-Game Coaster. In the Mini-Game Stadium, four players compete on a special board map consisting only of blue and red spaces. Coins are neither gained nor lost from these spaces, and coins are only earned by winning mini-games. The winner of Mini-Game Stadium is determined by whoever accumulates the highest number of coins by the completion of the allotted turns. In the Mini-Game Coaster, one human player must play through each mini-game. The player has three lives and progresses through a world map with the completion of each mini-game, while losing a mini-game results in the loss of a life. If the player loses all lives, the game ends, and the player must resume from the last save point. If the player completes all the mini-games in Mini-Game Coaster, a bonus mini-game is unlocked.

==Development and release==
&quot;Mario Party 2&quot; was developed by Hudson Soft and published by Nintendo. Development was underway as of July 1999, several months after the release of the original &quot;Mario Party&quot; game. A playable demo of the game was unveiled at Nintendo Space World in August 1999. The game was 70 percent complete at that time. Mini-games that involve rotating the control stick, as in the original &quot;Mario Party&quot;, are not present in this installment due to potential injuries, such as blisters, from rotating the stick too quickly; this was the subject of a lawsuit in the case of the first game.

In Japan, &quot;Mario Party 2&quot; was released for the Nintendo 64 on December 17, 1999. It received a U.S. release the following month, on January 24, 2000. Shortly before its U.S. release, Nintendo donated copies of the game to the Latin American Youth Center.

In Japan, &quot;Mario Party 2&quot; was re-released in November 2010, as a downloadable Virtual Console game for the Wii. The following month, it was released for the Virtual Console in North America and Europe. In North America, &quot;Mario Party 2&quot; was re-released as a Virtual Console game for the Wii U on December 22, 2016.
The game was re-released on November 2, 2022, via the Nintendo Switch Online service.

==Reception==

&quot;Mario Party 2&quot; received a 76% score on the review aggregation website GameRankings. Some critics praised the game&#x27;s new features, particularly the mini-games. However, some critics who disliked the original game were also critical of the sequel, despite the improvements. Some critics believed the graphics were an improvement over the previous game, while others considered the graphics to be largely the same as before.

Scott Alan Marriott of &quot;AllGame&quot; wrote that &quot;Mario Party 2&quot; &quot;does what a sequel is supposed to do: address the original&#x27;s shortcomings while offering enough enhancements to make even the jaded among us take a second look.&quot; Marriott concluded, &quot;When the books are closed on the Nintendo 64, it will be the multi-player aspect that players will remember most about the system, and &quot;Mario Party 2&quot; ranks as one of the system&#x27;s best.&quot;

&quot;GamePro&quot; stated that the game was not fun unless playing with friends. &quot;GameRevolution&quot; wrote, &quot;If you try to play by yourself or with a friend, the computer will take charge of the other two/three players. This means you&#x27;ll find yourself staring blankly at the screen as the computer takes its turn.&quot; Peyton Gaudiosi of &quot;Gamecenter&quot; wrote that playing alone &quot;is as subpar as that in the first game thanks to its repetitive turn-based nature.&quot;

Game Revolution stated that the game, like its predecessor, relied too much on random luck. Levi Buchanan of &quot;GameFan&quot; believed that the mini-games were not as good as those in the first &quot;Mario Party&quot;, and also stated that the game&#x27;s new features &quot;actually detract from what I consider the selling point of the original &quot;Mario Party&quot;: its simplicity.&quot; Joe Fielder of &quot;GameSpot&quot; said the game has much more replay value than the previous game. He also praised the variety of mini-games and wrote &quot;even the worst of the minigames is endurable.&quot; Matt Casamassina of &quot;IGN&quot; said that while the game had more content, and it &quot;sticks with the same winning formula... there really isn&#x27;t enough new here to warrant another purchase&quot;.

Michael Wolf reviewed the Nintendo 64 version of the game for &quot;Next Generation&quot;, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that &quot;This does exactly what it sets out to do – provide four players with a simple but fun board game and entertaining mini-games.&quot;

Several critics wrote positively of the Wii re-release. Chris Scullion of &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine UK&quot; called it &quot;arguably the best in the series&quot;, writing, &quot;It&#x27;s packed with fun mini-games and keeps the boards simple, rather than the convoluted messes that eventually emerged over the course of the Mario Party series.&quot; Corbie Dillard of &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; stated, &quot;There&#x27;s just something about the simple fun of &quot;Mario Party 2&quot; that makes it so difficult to put down at times&quot;, but wrote, &quot;It&#x27;s definitely a game you&#x27;ll want to have extra players on hand for, as the game can be a bit tedious sometimes as a solo experience.&quot; Lucas M. Thomas of IGN praised the re-release but noted that it was only compatible with the GameCube controller or the Classic Controller.

Retrospectively, the game has been called by some critics as one of the best games in the series, calling it vastly superior to the original game and citing its many gameplay improvements over the first game, the addition of a new item system, new minigame modes, and introducing several new game boards with unique themes and gimmicks as contributing to a memorable experience. &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; listed it as the best Mario Party game, also noting how it is a fan favorite. Additionally, &quot;Mario Party 2&quot; was the highest rated favorite game in &quot;Mario Party Superstars&quot; in-game statistics.

<doc id="153449" wikidata="Q649015" url="?curid=153449" title="The Tale of the Body Thief">
<text>The Tale of the Body Thief is a vampire novel by American writer Anne Rice, the fourth in her &quot;The Vampire Chronicles&quot; series, following &quot;The Queen of the Damned&quot; (1988). Published in 1992, it continues the adventures of Lestat, specifically his efforts to regain his lost humanity during the late 20th century. Chapters from the book appeared in the October 1992 issue of &quot;Playboy&quot;.

==Plot summary==
At the beginning of the story, Lestat grows depressed and becomes remorseful because of his vampiric nature. Although he tries to limit his victims to murderers, serial killers and other criminals, he nonetheless caves into temptation once in a while and kills an &quot;innocent&quot;, or someone who he feels does not necessarily deserve to die. Lestat also suffers from constant nightmares concerning his late &quot;daughter&quot;, Claudia, for whose death he blames himself.

Since Akasha&#x27;s defeat, Lestat has become extremely lonely. Among his only remaining friends is David Talbot, the elderly mortal head of the Talamasca. Although Lestat has repeatedly offered to turn David, he has always refused to become a vampire and keep Lestat company through eternity. Lestat goes to the Gobi Desert at dawn in a half-hearted suicide attempt. When he does not die, he goes to David&#x27;s home in England to heal.

A mysterious figure, Raglan James, approaches Lestat with what seems to be a cure for his ennui and depression. James sends Lestat several messages hinting that he has the ability to switch bodies. Eventually, he proposes to Lestat that the two of them trade bodies for a day. David reveals that James was a gifted psychic who once joined the Talamasca, but was kicked out of the order for constant theft. 

James is a kleptomaniac who has stolen or schemed for literally everything he owns, from his house to his body. However, he also has major psychic problems, and his life is a series of cycles—he gets rich by theft, then often ends up in prison. Dying of cancer several years before, James tricked an inmate of a mental institution into switching bodies with him, allowing him a type of immortality. Against the advice of David and other vampires, Lestat jumps at the opportunity. Unfortunately, James has no intention of ever switching back, and Lestat is forced to scheme to regain his body.

Lestat nearly dies after becoming human again—his new body is wracked by pneumonia, which he ignores during a tour of Washington D.C. in the middle of winter. He is saved by the care of a nun named Gretchen. He enjoys a short love affair with Gretchen before she returns to South America, where she works in a convent, and Lestat sets out in search of his body.

Lestat seeks help from other vampires but is completely ostracized. Louis turns Lestat away when he asks to turn his new body, arguing that Lestat ought to be happy to be human again and also calling him out for slandering him in previous writings. Marius is extremely angry at him for leaving such a powerful body to a thief. Lestat&#x27;s only ally is David.

It is James&#x27;s lack of imagination and petty thievery that allow Lestat and David to track him down. Despite his newfound wealth and powerful new body, James continues to steal jewelry from people. He also makes a conspicuous show of his wealth, boarding the &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot; and draining victims of their blood along the ship&#x27;s path. The pattern allows his pursuers to easily find him aboard the ship. While Lestat manages to regain his body with David&#x27;s help, he performs the switch during a sunrise and must immediately flee to a safe place during the day. When he awakes in the evening, he finds that both David and James have disappeared.

Lestat finds David in Florida and is surprised to find that his friend, despite his earlier protestations, now wants to become a vampire. However, while taking his blood, Lestat discovers a final trick—when forced out of Lestat&#x27;s body, James took over David&#x27;s body instead of returning to his own. Lestat angrily attacks James, crushing his skull. The blow proves fatal—the injury damages James&#x27;s brain and prevents him from either leaving the dying body or attempting another switch.

David begins to enjoy life in the young body previously occupied by James. Lestat returns to New Orleans, reunites with Louis, and begins to renovate his old house in the French Quarter. However, Lestat regains his &quot;evil&quot; nature upon finally accepting his vampirism and decides to turn David against his wishes. David initially resists Lestat&#x27;s aggressive advances, but eventually succumbs. Soon after David and Lestat admit their love for each other. David disappears again, prompting Lestat to fruitlessly search for him. Lestat returns to New Orleans and is surprised to find that David has already contacted Louis.

David explains to Lestat that, in secret, this is what he always truly wanted. He tells Lestat that he is no longer angry with him, although he does usurp Lestat&#x27;s position of leadership, despite the latter&#x27;s protests. Having gotten rid of his old age and mortality, David plans to visit Rio de Janeiro with Louis, and asks Lestat to join him. At the end, Lestat realizes that, despite all that happened, he is still alone, has failed to regain his &quot;humanity&quot;, and has thrown away his only chance to make amends for his past misdeeds.

==Motifs==
In many ways, &quot;The Tale of the Body Thief&quot; lays the groundwork for the following &quot;Vampire Chronicles&quot; novel, &quot;Memnoch the Devil&quot;. David Talbot, in his occult fieldwork, has begun to understand the nature of the spirit world, and actually claims to have seen God and the Devil sitting and talking in a cafe.

In interviews after the book came out, Rice claimed that her own father&#x27;s death helped to form the model for the relationship between Lestat and Talbot. Rice had loved her father very much (her mother died prematurely after succumbing to alcoholism), and when he was dying, she wished (as Lestat does with Talbot) that she could somehow make him young again so that she wouldn&#x27;t lose him. This could make &quot;Tale of the Body Thief&quot; the second of two &quot;Vampire Chronicle&quot; novels inspired by Rice&#x27;s personal tragedies, the first being &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot; (which is denied by Rice).

Lestat&#x27;s adjustment to his human body takes up a major portion of the book—after almost two centuries of being a vampire, he finds he has trouble with the basic human nuances of eating, defecating, and taking care of his body. One of the realizations made by Lestat is that he took his powers for granted for too long; only after his adventure is he able to fully appreciate his vampiric abilities.

Likewise, Lestat describes James as a devious and cunning opponent, a characterization he uses to justify how he was tricked. However, in reality, Raglan James is an extremely petty and predictable criminal who is constantly dropping clues as to his next move—at one point, Talbot refers to James as &quot;a glorified purse snatcher&quot;.

The novel is also ironic in the clues that it leaves behind. For example, one of the &quot;hints&quot; that Raglan James leaves Lestat is a copy of H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s short story, &quot;The Thing on the Doorstep&quot;. In the Lovecraft story, body-switching also takes place, and has an added twist when a third party gets involved without the narrator&#x27;s knowledge. Lestat doesn&#x27;t bother re-reading the short story; if he had, he might have anticipated Raglan James&#x27; final trick.

The darkest irony is Lestat&#x27;s supposed concern for the elderly David Talbot. One of his nightmares concerns a flashback to when the young Talbot was a big-game hunter, and was nearly killed by a man-eating tiger. At the story&#x27;s beginning, Lestat is constantly bothered by a foreboding that his friend is dying or in some mortal danger. He connects this feeling to William Blake&#x27;s poem The Tyger, which is quoted piecemeal throughout the entire novel:

::&quot;Tyger! Tyger! burning bright&quot;
::&quot;In the forests of the night,&quot;
::&quot;What immortal hand or eye&quot;
::&quot;Could frame thy fearful symmetry?&quot;

At the end of the story, Lestat realizes with horror that he must have been the &quot;tiger&quot; of his visions.

==Film adaptation==
In 2007, &quot;The Tale of the Body Thief&quot; was rumored to be adapted into film as United Artists was interested in purchasing the film rights to the novel. Rice announced via her Facebook profile on February 7, 2012, that Brian Grazer and Ron Howard&#x27;s film production company, Imagine Entertainment, had optioned the motion picture rights to the novel. Lee Patterson was to have written the screenplay. &quot;Transformer&#x27;s&quot; Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci were also said to be on board as producers during the time of development.

&quot;The plan is to treat the character (Lestat) as if audiences have not met him before,&quot; said &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; with word from Imagine.

On April 7, 2013, during a live-internet radio chat with her son Christopher and co-host Eric Shaw Quinn, Anne explained that a film adaptation is no longer in development and stated on her Facebook profile: &quot;No Lestat movie in the works—after all these years, and the best efforts of all involved... We&#x27;ve encountered difficulties we cannot at this time overcome.&quot; Rice&#x27;s son Christopher apparently drafted and adapted a screenplay from the novel that was met with praise from those involved; however, the project has been dismissed as the studio isn&#x27;t &quot;willing to move forward with it&quot; due to differences that were beyond them.

As of August 2014, an entire reboot of &quot;The Vampire Chronicles&quot; was planned by producers Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci after the motion picture rights were optioned by Universal Pictures and Imagine Entertainment. Christopher Rice&#x27;s screenplay for &quot;The Tale of the Body Thief&quot; was reportedly worked into the recent deal for a proposed film franchise and a reinterpretation of &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot; was also hinted by Rice herself via Facebook. However, in November 2016 Universal did not renew the contract, and the film and television rights reverted to Rice, who began developing &quot;The Vampire Chronicles&quot; into a television series with Christopher.

==Reception==
&quot;The New York Times&quot; remarked that the &quot;gorgeousness&quot; found in the prose of earlier novels is &quot;practically absent from &quot;Body Thief&quot; and noted that &quot;The &quot;Vampire Chronicles&quot; seem to be careening down a steep, sad slope&quot;. &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; said the novel starts slow, but once it gets going, Rice &quot;provides her most inspired pages ever&quot;. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; called the prose &quot;sensuous&quot; and &quot;fluid&quot;.

<doc id="153450" wikidata="Q3973942" url="?curid=153450" title="History of Tyrol">
<text>The history of Tyrol, a historical region in the middle alpine area of Central Europe, dates back to early human settlements at the end of the last glacier period, around 12,000 BC. Sedentary settlements of farmers and herders can be traced back to 5000 BC. Many of the main and side valleys were settled during the early Bronze Age, from 1800 to 1300 BC. From these settlements, two prominent cultures emerged: the Laugen-Melaun culture in the Bronze Age, and the Fritzens-Sanzeno culture in the Iron Age.

The region, inhabited during the Iron Age by the Alpine population of the Raeti, was conquered by the Romans in 15 BC. The northern and eastern areas were incorporated into the Roman Empire as the provinces of Raetia and Noricum, leaving deep impressions on the culture and language, with the Rhaeto-Romance languages. Following the conquest of Italy by the Goths, Tyrol became part of the Ostrogothic Kingdom in the fifth and sixth centuries. In 553, southern Tyrol was incorporated into the Lombards&#x27; Kingdom of Italy, northern Tyrol came under the influence of the Bavarii, and western Tyrol became part of Alamannia—the three areas meeting at present-day Bolzano.

In 774, Charlemagne conquered the Lombards, and as a consequence, Tyrol became an important bridgehead to Italy. In the eleventh century, the Emperors of the Holy Roman Empire granted the counties of Trento, Bolzano, and Vinschgau to the Bishopric of Trent, and the county of Norital and Puster Valley to the Bishopric of Brixen—effectually placing the region under the control of the Emperors.

In the coming centuries, the counts residing in Tirol Castle near Merano extended their territory over the region. Later counts would hold much of their territory directly from the Holy Roman Emperor. The Meinhardinger family, originating in Gorizia, controlled the Tyrol, Gorizia, and the Duchy of Carinthia. By 1295, the &quot;county and reign of Tyrol&quot; had established itself firmly in the &quot;Land on the Adige and Inn&quot;, as the region was then called. When the Meinhardiner dynasty died out in 1369, the Tyrol was ceded to the House of Habsburg, who ruled over the region for the next five and a half centuries, with a brief period of control in the early nineteenth century by the Bavarians during the Napoleonic Wars.

At the conclusion of World War I, the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye of 1919 ceded the southern part of Tyrol to the Kingdom of Italy, including present-day South Tyrol, with its large German-speaking majority. The northern part of Tyrol was retained by the First Austrian Republic. The historical region is formed by the present-day Austrian State of Tyrol and the Italian provinces of South Tyrol and Trentino. The boundaries of this Tyrol–South Tyrol–Trentino Euroregion correspond to the former Habsburg County of Tyrol, which gave this historical region its name.

== Prehistory ==
Archaeological findings show people settled in the middle alpine region, later to be called Tyrol, when the glaciers retreated and flora and fauna revived, after the last ice age ended around 12,000 BC. Artifacts found on the Seiser Alm date to the Upper Paleolithic era. In the valley bottoms near Bolzano, Brixen and Salorno, mesolithic hunters resting places were discovered. Stone artefacts recovered there were dated to the 8th millennia BC. Discovery of Ötzi on the Similaun glacier in 1991 proved man had already crossed the highest Alpine passes 5000 years ago. Sedentary settlements of farmers and herders can be traced back to 5000 BC. There is ample evidence of settlements in the main and side valleys during the early and middle Bronze Age (1800-1300 BC). Preferred settlement sites were sunny terraces on the valleys slopes, and hill tops in the middle heights.

In the Bronze and Iron Ages the region was home to a series of autochthonous cultures occupying roughly the area of the later county of Tyrol. The most prominent are the late Bronze Age Laugen-Melaun culture and Iron Age Fritzens-Sanzeno culture cultures.

The Laugen-Melaun culture, named after two important archaeological sites near the modern-day town of Brixen in South Tyrol, originated in the 14th century BC, in the area of today&#x27;s South Tyrol and Trentino. It soon spread over the central area of the Southern Alps, encompassing South and East Tyrol, Trentino north of Rovereto and the Lower Engadine; the northern part of Tyrol came under the influence of the Urnfield culture. Distinguishing factors include its characteristic richly decorated pottery, while the metal-working is strongly influenced by adjacent cultures. As in the Urnfield culture, Laugen-Melaun-people cremated their dead, placing their ashes in urns, and worshipping their gods in sanctuaries sometimes situated in remote areas, on mountain-tops or close to water. Rich burial objects show that from the 13th to 11th century BC, the Laugen-Melaun culture (Laugen-Melaun A) flourished, due to the mining of copper, the source material for the alloy bronze.

Around 500 BC, the Fritzens-Sanzeno culture, also known as culture of the Raeti, after the goddess Raetia who according to Roman authors was the main deity of the people inhabiting the region, succeeded both the Laugen-Melaun culture of the southern and the Urnfield culture of the northern part of Tyrol. As in the preceding culture, the richly ornamented pottery is very characteristic, while many aspects such as the metal-working, burial customs and religion are strongly influenced by its neighbours, primarily the Etruscans and Celts. Nonetheless, the Fritzens-Sanzeno-people possessed important distinct cultural traits distinguishing them from adjacent groups, such as the typical mountain-sanctuaries already in use during the time of the Laugen-Melaun culture, certain types of fibulae, bronze armor, and their own alphabet derived from one of North Etruscan alphabets (but not from the Etruscan alphabet). The language of the Raeti was kin to Etruscan, but different enough to suggest a very ancient divergence between them.

== Antiquity ==
In 15 BC, the region was conquered by the Romans, and its northern and eastern part incorporated into the Roman Empire as the provinces of Raetia and Noricum respectively. The part south of and including the area around the modern day cities of Bolzano and Merano became part of Italia&#x27;s &quot;Regio X&quot;. As in the rest of Europe, the Roman era left deep impressions on the culture and language, with the Rhaeto-Romance languages.

== Middle Ages ==
After the conquest of Italy by the Goths, Tyrol became part of the Ostrogothic Kingdom from the 5th to the 6th century. After the fall of the Ostrogothic Kingdom in 553, the Germanic tribe of the Lombards invaded Italy and founded the Lombard Kingdom of Italy, which no longer included all of Tyrol, only its southern part. The northern part of Tyrol came under the influence of the Bavarii, while the west probably was part of Alamannia. Thus, Tyrol was divided among three spheres of influence that met in the approximate area of today&#x27;s Bolzano. During the 6th century Bavaria and Alamannia became stem duchies of the Frankish Kingdom. On conquering the Lombard Kingdom of Italy in 774, Charlemagne had himself crowned King of the Lombards. Consequently, Tyrol came to be of great importance as a bridgehead to Italy, which was re-affirmed during the Italian Campaign of Otto I. In the years 1007 and 1027 the Emperors of the Holy Roman Empire granted the counties of Trento, Bolzano and Vinschgau to the Bishopric of Trent. In 1027 the County of Norital was granted to the Bishopric of Brixen, followed in 1091 by the County of Puster Valley. Since the Bishops were nominated directly by the Emperor and their office was not hereditary, putting the area under their control was intended to secure it to the Emperors.

== Birth of the County of Tyrol ==
Over the centuries, the Counts residing in Tirol Castle, near Merano, extended their territory over the region. Later counts would hold much of their territory directly from the Holy Roman Emperor. The Meinhardinger family, originating in Gorizia, held not only Tyrol and Gorizia, but for a time the Duchy of Carinthia. At the end of count Meinhard II&#x27;s rule (1259–1295) the &quot;county and reign of Tyrol&quot; had established itself firmly in the &quot;Land on the Adige and Inn&quot;, as the region was then called. This happened on the expense of the power of the bishops, who were nominally the feudal lords of the counts of Tyrol. Meinhard II also introduced more efficient systems for the administration of his territories.

Margarete &quot;Maultasch&quot; was the last effective ruler of Tyrol from the Meinhardinger Dynasty. In 1330 she was married to John-Henry (who later became the margrave of Moravia), who she repudiated with the help of the Tyrolean aristocracy in order to marry Duke Ludwig V of Bavaria, a member of the powerful Wittelsbach dynasty. This weakened the position of the countess and strengthened the local nobility. The only son of Margarete and Louis, Meinhard, died in 1363, two years after his father, leaving the countess without an heir.

Margarete Maultasch decided to bequeath Tyrol to Duke Rudolph IV of the House of Habsburg, probably pressed by the aristocracy, an act which caused a conflict between Meinhard&#x27;s uncle Stephen II, who forged an alliance with the powerful Lord of Milan Bernabò Visconti to invade Tyrol, and the House of Habsburg. Stephen finally renounced Tyrol to the Habsburgs with the Peace of Schärding for a huge financial compensation after the death of Margarete Maultasch in 1369. The red eagle in Tyrol&#x27;s coat of arms derives from the red Brandenburg eagle, dating from the time when Louis V and Margarete Maultasch governed Brandenburg as well.

== Habsburg rule ==
The acquisition of Tyrol was strategically important to the Habsburg dynasty, since it allowed it to connect their Austrian territories with their territorial possessions in the area of today&#x27;s Switzerland. From that time, Tyrol was ruled by various lines of the Habsburg family, who bore the title Count. Tyrol repeatedly became involved in the political and military conflicts of the Habsburgs with Milan, Venice, Switzerland and the County of Gorizia, as well as Bavaria and Swabia.

The Battle of Sempach in 1386, in which Duke Leopold III of Austria was defeated by the Old Swiss Confederacy had important repercussions on Tyrol, and was the first of a series of military conflicts between the county and its neighbours. The 1405-1408 war against the Swiss Appenzeller, 1413 the conflict with Venice and 1410 the invasion of the lower Inn valley by the Bavarians. In 1423, during the rule of Frederick IV &quot;Empty Pockets&quot;, the first meeting that could be called a Tyrolean Parliament met. It consisted of aristocrats, bourgeois and even peasant representatives. During Frederick IV&#x27;s tenure internal conflicts between the powerful local aristocracy and the duke arose, which eventually led to the decline of the nobles and of their traditional system of values, and strengthened the duke&#x27;s rule over the country. This enabled Sigismund &quot;Rich in Coin&quot; to continue his father&#x27;s rule to the end of the 15th century and lead the county into the modern era.

Sigismund&#x27;s opulent lifestyle and the misfortunes of war with Venice bled the treasury, leading to his decision to mortgage the Tyrolean silver mines. By 1490, Sigismund became so unpopular that he was forced to abdicate in favor of his more prosperous cousin, Maximilian, King of the Germans. Three years after the succession, Maximilian became Holy Roman Emperor, making his preferred residence, Innsbruck, the imperial capitol. Maximilian added Kufstein, Rattenberg and Kitzbühel to Tyrol, and when he inherited the Puster Valley and East Tyrol the borders of Tyrol were set, with the exception of the 1817 addition of the Ziller Valley

== Napoleonic Wars ==

Following defeat by Napoleon in 1805, Austria was forced to cede Tyrol to the Kingdom of Bavaria in the Peace of Pressburg. Tyrol, as a part of Bavaria, became a member of the Confederation of the Rhine in 1806. Consequently, King Maximilian I of Bavaria introduced far reaching economic, religious and administrative reforms. When in 1808 a new constitution for the Kingdom of Bavaria was introduced, Tyrol was integrated into South Bavaria, and divided into three districts, losing its special status in the kingdom. Furthermore, Tyroleans were now subjected to the Bavarian conscription levies, and faced the prospect of having to fight against Austrian troops. This, together with the economic decline under Bavarian rule, and the kingdom&#x27;s religious reforms which were opposed by the Catholic population, led to a growing conflict between the Tyrolean population and the Bavarian authorities.

In 1806, delegates from Tyrol travelled to Vienna to make plans for an insurrection of the Tyrolean people. Among them was the later leader of the insurgents, Andreas Hofer. The insurrection began on April 9, 1809, in Innsbruck. On April 12, 1809, Innsbruck was freed by the Tyrolean &quot;Landsturm&quot; commanded by captain Martin Teimer in the battle later known as the First battle of the Bergisel. One day later a military unit of 8000 men consisting of Bavarian and French Troops approached Innsbruck from the Brenner Pass, but was convinced to surrender by captain Teimer, who dressed up as a Major of the regular Austrian army and made the Bavarian officers believe that the Austrian army was approaching Innsbruck, when in fact it was still about 40 miles away. In order to convalidate the capitulation agreement, Teimer was subsequently appointed Major of the Austrian army. 
Throughout Tyrol, the Bavarian troops were killed or driven out. The Tyroleans fought mainly as skirmishing sharpshooters, taking advantage of the mountainous nature of the land. They were highly mobile and made use of artificial avalanches to combat their enemies. Following the defeat of the Austrian Army on the Bavarian front, Napoleon dispatched Charles Lefebvre to Tyrol, and by May 19 Innsbruck had been seized again and the rebellion seemed quelled.

After Archduke Karl&#x27;s Austrian army was defeated by Napoleon at the Battle of Wagram, the Armistice of Znaim was signed. Point IV of the agreement stated that Austria was to withdraw its troops from the territories of Vorarlberg and Tyrol, returning them to Bavarian rule. But the Bavarians and the French found it difficult to gain control of the territory, with Tyrolean sharpshooters occupying high places along the roads, blocking roads and setting off avalanches to harm the occupying army. The Tyroleans managed to hold off and inflict heavy casualties on the French and Bavarian troops, and on August 13 the Tyrolean peasant army rallied at the Bergisel again for the decisive Battle. Fifteen thousand Bavarian, French and Saxon troops faced almost the same number of Tyrolean irregulars. Surrounded on all sides by the irregulars, and having sustained heavy casualties, Lefebvre was forced to withdraw. Andreas Hofer, who in the meantime had advanced to supreme commander of the insurgents, became regent of Tyrol in the name of the Emperor.

Following the Treaty of Schönbrunn Tyrol was again ceded to Bavaria by the Austrian Emperor. On October 21 Bavarian, French and Italian troops under the command of Jean-Baptiste Drouet, Comte d&#x27;Erlon poured into Tyrol, forcing the Tyroleans to retreat to the Bergisel again. As Winter approached, supplies began to dwindle, and many men left to return to their homes. On 28/29 October, news of the peace treaty that had been signed by Austria reached Tyrol. This had catastrophic effects on the morale of the Tyroleans, and Andreas Hofer, betrayed by his emperor, resorted to drinking. The Tyrolean morale had been broken. On November 1 Drouet d&#x27;Erlon had recaptured Innsbruck and the Bergisel, and by 11 November 1809, Tyrol was entirely occupied. Hofer fled into the mountains, and on 5 January 1810 he was betrayed and denounced to the authorities. On 28 January, he, his wife and his son were taken to Bolzano. Napoleon learnt of the capture at the start of February and ordered Hofer to be tried and executed. This order was acted upon soon and Hofer died at the dungeon of the fortress of Mantua on February 20, 1810.

The execution of Hofer, considered a Tyrolean hero until today, is the topic of the song &quot;Zu Mantua in Banden&quot;, since 1948 the Tyrol&#x27;s official anthem.

== Crownland of Tyrol ==
Tyrol remained divided under Bavarian and Italian authority for another four years, before its reunification and return to Austria following the decisions at the Congress of Vienna in 1814. Integrated into the Austrian Empire, from 1867 onwards, it was a &quot;Kronland&quot; (Crown Land) of Cisleithania, the western half of Austria-Hungary.

== World War I ==
On the eve of World War I, the southern part of the Austrian crown land of Tyrol was populated mainly by Italian speakers (the so-called &quot;Welschtirol&quot;, or Trentino). Its border coincided with the present-day border between South Tyrol and Trentino, crossing the Adige valley at Salorno (&quot;Chiusa di Salorno/Salurner Klause&quot;). The existence of areas largely populated by Italian-speaking populations under the rule of the Austrian Empire was a constant cause of friction between Austria and Italy, a national state set on the unification of all Italians. Being part of the Triple Alliance with Germany and Austria was &quot;an embarrassment, if not a contradiction&quot; for Italy. Italy&#x27;s fear that it would not get what it wanted in the event of a victorious Triple Alliance caused it to remain neutral during the first year of the war, and the preoccupation that it wouldn&#x27;t get what it wanted from a victorious Entente either if it remained neutral led it to join the war on the side of the latter. Italy conducted intense negotiations with Austria, which was prepared to part with Trentino in exchange of Italy&#x27;s neutrality, but Italy wanted (among other things) to reach the Alpine water divide, which it claimed as its &#x27;natural border&#x27;, a demand which Austria refused, since it would have meant giving up a territory regarded as personal fief by the Habsburg Emperors. On 26 April 1915, Italy signed the Treaty of London, agreeing to declare war against the Central Powers in exchange for the unredeemed territories of Trentino, Gorizia, Trieste and Dalmatia, as well as the part of German Tyrol south of the main Alpine divide. Apart from these territorial gains the alliance change enabled Italy to realise its aspiration: Italian military dominance in the Mediterranean. The ideals of irredentism were used to convince the population of the necessity of the war, but the true motive of the political leadership to join the war was their idea that Italy should become a great European power.

War against the Austro-Hungarian Empire was declared May 24, 1915. This put Tyrol on the front line, which passed through some of the highest mountains in the Alps. The ensuing front became known as the &quot;War in ice and snow&quot;, as troops occupied the highest mountains and glaciers all year long. of snow were common during the winter of 1915–16, and tens of thousands of soldiers disappeared in avalanches. The remains of these soldiers are still being uncovered today. The Italian Alpini, their Austrian counterparts (&quot;Kaiserjäger&quot;, &quot;Standschützen&quot; and &quot;Landesschützen&quot;), and the German Alpenkorps occupied every hill and mountain top. They began carving extensive fortifications and military quarters, even drilling tunnels inside the mountains and deep into glaciers, like at Marmolada. Hundreds of troops would drag guns over mountains up to . Streets, cable cars, mountain railways and walkways through the steepest of walls were built. The first to occupy higher ground became almost impossible to dislodge, so both sides turned to drilling tunnels under mountain peaks, filling them up with explosives, then detonating the entire mountain, including its defenders, such as Col di Lana, Monte Pasubio, Lagazuoi, etc. Climbing and skiing became essential skills for the troops of both sides and soon Ski Battalions and Special Climbing units were formed.

On May 15, 1916, the Austrian army staged an attack from the Trentino, unaided by the German army, whose command had advised against such a move. Several divisions were withdrawn from the Russian front to achieve necessary troop strength. The offensive was of limited tactical success. Austrians penetrated twelve miles into Italian territory, inflicting heavy casualties on the Italians, but fell short of their strategic and political goals. This inconclusive attack weakened the eastern front, which enabled the Russian Army to overrun Austrian positions in Galicia and threaten the heart of the Habsburg Empire

=== The armistice ===
After the Battle of Asiago in 1916, which ended in a stalemate and brought only minor territorial gains to Austria, the Tyrolean frontline remained largely static. The main battles were fought elsewhere. This changed in October, 1918, with Austro-Hungarian defeat in the Battle of Vittorio Veneto, the Imperial army collapsed and started to withdraw and, on 29 October, the Austro-Hungarians asked for an armistice. On 30 October 1918, the Austro-Hungarian army was split in two. The armistice was signed at 3.20 p.m., November 3, to become effective 24 hours later, at 3.00 p.m., November 4.
Following the signing of the armistice, Austrian General Weber informed his Italian counterparts that the Imperial army had already laid down its weapons, due to a previous order and requested combat and Italian advancement to cease. The Italian General Pietro Badoglio sharply rejected the proposal, and threatened to stop all negotiations and continue the war. General Weber repeated the request, with no results. Even before the order to cease hostilities, the Imperial Army had already started to collapse, ceasing to exist as a combat force. Italian troops continued their advance until 3.00 p.m. on November 4. The occupation of all Tyrol, including Innsbruck, was completed in the days that followed.

Under the terms of the Austrian-Italian Armistice of Villa Giusti, as well as being required to evacuate all territory occupied since August, Austria-Hungary&#x27;s forces were required to withdraw from South Tyrol, Tarvisio, the Isonzo valley, Gorizia, Trieste, Istria, western Carniola, and Dalmatia. Terms mandated German forces expulsion from Austria-Hungary within 15 days or their internment, and the Allies were to have free use of Austria-Hungary&#x27;s internal communications. They were also obliged to allow Entente armies&#x27; transit, to reach Germany from the South.

The Italian General Rodolfo Graziani&#x27;s 11th Italian army continued to advance, supported on the right by the 9th army. The result was that Austria-Hungary lost about 30,000 casualties and between 300,000 and 500,000 prisoners (50,000 by 31 October, 100,000 by 1 November and 428,000 by 4 November). Italian losses numbered about 38,000, including 145 French and 374 Britons.

It appears that the large quantity of prisoners stemmed from the Austrian command decision that captivity in Italy was preferable to starvation at home. After the armistice, hundreds of thousands of Austrian soldiers without weapons, food and discipline made their way home through the alpine valleys. The alpine villages were caught between the retreating, half-starved soldiers who repeatedly resorted to theft and robbery to survive, and the advancing Italian army. At the same time, great numbers of Italian war prisoners were making their way south towards their homeland. Austria did not have the means to guarantee the orderly retreat of its own army or the organized return of Italian war prisoners. In the meantime, Italian occupation of Tyrol was going as planned. On 11 November, Italian troops occupied the Brenner Pass and the Pass at Toblach. To secure access to the Inn valley, crucial for an advance into southern Germany, Innsbruck, capital of Tyrol, and the village Landeck were occupied as well. On 10 January 1919, the commander of the 3rd army corps, Gen. Ugo Sani, was appointed military governor of northern Tyrol with residence in Innsbruck.

== After World War I ==

The Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye of 1919 ruled that, according to the Treaty of London, the southern part of Tyrol had to be ceded to the Kingdom of Italy. Italy&#x27;s border was pushed northward to the strategically important Alpine water divide, including present-day South Tyrol with its large German-speaking majority. The northern part of Tyrol was retained by the First Austrian Republic. In 1923, towns of Buchenstein, Hayden and Verseil were transferred from Province of Bolzano to Province of Belluno. Also, Hastachtal (includes former municipality of Casotto) was transferred from Province of Trento to Province of Vicenza in 1929, and towns of Magasa and Valvestino were transferred from Province of Trento to Province of Brescia in 1934.

<doc id="153459" wikidata="Q174864" url="?curid=153459" title="Elegy">
<text>An elegy is a poem of serious reflection, and in English literature usually a lament for the dead. However, according to &quot;The Oxford Handbook of the Elegy&quot;, &quot;for all of its pervasiveness ... the &#x27;elegy&#x27; remains remarkably ill defined: sometimes used as a catch-all to denominate texts of a somber or pessimistic tone, sometimes as a marker for textual monumentalizing, and sometimes strictly as a sign of a lament for the dead&quot;.

==History==

The Greek term ἐλεγείᾱ (&quot;elegeíā&quot;; from , , ‘lament’) originally referred to any verse written in elegiac couplets and covering a wide range of subject matter (death, love, war). The term also included epitaphs, sad and mournful songs, and commemorative verses. The Latin elegy of ancient Roman literature was most often erotic or mythological in nature. Because of its structural potential for rhetorical effects, the elegiac couplet was also used by both Greek and Roman poets for witty, humorous, and satirical subject matter.

Other than epitaphs, examples of ancient elegy as a poem of mourning include Catullus&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot; 101, on his dead brother, and elegies by Propertius on his dead mistress Cynthia and a matriarch of the prominent Cornelian family. Ovid wrote elegies bemoaning his exile, which he likened to a death.

===Literature===

====English====
In English literature, the more modern and restricted meaning, of a lament for a departed beloved or tragic event, has been current only since the sixteenth century; the broader concept was still employed by John Donne for his elegies written in the early seventeenth century. That looser concept is especially evident in the Old English Exeter Book (), which contains &quot;serious meditative&quot; and well-known poems such as &quot;The Wanderer&quot;, &quot;The Seafarer&quot;, and &quot;The Wife&#x27;s Lament&quot;. In those elegies, the narrators use the lyrical &quot;I&quot; to describe their own personal and mournful experiences. They tell the story of the individual rather than the collective lore of his or her people as epic poetry seeks to tell. By the time of Samuel Taylor Coleridge and others, the term had come to mean &quot;serious meditative poem&quot;:

A famous example of elegy is Thomas Gray&#x27;s &quot;Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard&quot; (1750).

====Other languages====

In French, perhaps the most famous elegy is &quot;Le Lac&quot; (1820) by Alphonse de Lamartine.

In Germany, the most famous example is &quot;Duino Elegies&quot; by Rainer Maria Rilke (1922).

In the Islamic world—namely Shia Islam, the most famous examples are elegies written by Sachay Bhai on the Battle of Karbala. Elegies written on Husayn ibn Ali and his followers are very common and produced even today.

In Spain, one of the capital works in Spanish is &quot;Coplas por la Muerte de su Padre&quot; (Stanzas About the Death of His Father), written between 1460 and 1470 by Jorge Manrique.

===Music===
&quot;Elegy&quot; (French: &quot;élégie&quot;) may denote a type of musical work, usually of a sad or somber nature. A well-known example is the Élégie, Op. 10, by Jules Massenet. This was originally written for piano, as a student work; then he set it as a song; and finally it appeared as the &quot;Invocation&quot;, for cello and orchestra, a section of his incidental music to Leconte de Lisle&#x27;s &quot;Les Érinnyes&quot;. Other examples include Gabriel Fauré&#x27;s Elegy in C minor (op. 24) for cello and piano, the Elegy Op. 58 of Edward Elgar, the &quot;Elegy for Strings&quot; of Benjamin Britten, and the first movement, &quot;Elegy&quot;, of Pēteris Vasks&#x27;s String Quartet No. 4. Though not specifically designated an elegy, Samuel Barber&#x27;s &quot;Adagio for Strings&quot; has an elegiac character.

<text>The North Germanic languages make up one of the three branches of the Germanic languages—a sub-family of the Indo-European languages—along with the West Germanic languages and the extinct East Germanic languages. The language group is also referred to as the Nordic languages, a direct translation of the most common term used among Danish, Faroese, Icelandic, Norwegian, and Swedish scholars and people.

The term &quot;North Germanic languages&quot; is used in comparative linguistics, whereas the term Scandinavian languages appears in studies of the modern standard languages and the dialect continuum of Scandinavia. Danish, Norwegian and Swedish are close enough to form a strong mutual intelligibility where cross-border communication in native languages is very common, particularly between the latter two.

Approximately 20 million people in the Nordic countries speak a Scandinavian language as their native language, including an approximately 5% minority in Finland. Besides being the only North Germanic language with official status in two separate sovereign states, Swedish is also the most spoken of the languages overall. 15% of the population in Greenland speak Danish as a first language.

This language branch is separated from the West Germanic languages, consisting of languages like English, Dutch, and German to the south, and does not include the Finnic and Sami languages spoken in the same region, which belong to the completely unrelated Uralic language family.

== Modern languages and dialects ==

The modern languages and their dialects in this group are:
* East Scandinavian
** Danish
*** Jutlandic dialect
**** North Jutlandic
**** East Jutlandic
**** West Jutlandic
**** South Jutlandic
*** Insular Danish
*** East Danish
** Swedish
*** Göta dialects
*** Gotland dialects
*** Svealand dialects
*** Norrland dialects
*** East Swedish dialects
**** Finland Swedish
**** Estonian Swedish
**Gutnish
* West Scandinavian
** Norwegian
*** Bokmål (written)
*** Nynorsk (written)
*** Trønder dialects
*** East Norwegian dialects
*** West Norwegian dialects
*** North Norwegian dialects
** Dalecarlian language
*** Elfdalian
** Faroese
** Icelandic

== History ==

===Distinction from East and West Germanic===
The Germanic languages are traditionally divided into three groups: West, East and North Germanic. Their exact relation is difficult to determine from the sparse evidence of runic inscriptions, and they remained mutually intelligible to some degree during the Migration Period (AD300 to 600), so that some individual varieties are difficult to classify. Dialects with the features assigned to the northern group formed from the Proto-Germanic language in the late Pre-Roman Iron Age in Northern Europe.

Eventually, around the year AD200, speakers of the North Germanic branch became distinguishable from the other Germanic language speakers. The early development of this language branch is attested through runic inscriptions.

===Features shared with West Germanic===

The North Germanic group is characterized by a number of phonological and morphological innovations shared with West Germanic:
* The retraction of Proto-Germanic &quot;ē&quot; (, also written &quot;ǣ&quot;) to &quot;ā&quot;.
** Proto-Germanic *&quot;jērą&quot; &#x27;year&#x27; &gt; Northwest Germanic *&quot;jārą,&quot; whence
*** North Germanic * &gt; Old Norse ,
*** West Germanic * &gt; Old High German , Old English vs. Gothic .
* The raising of to (and word-finally to ). The original vowel remained when nasalised *&quot;ǭ&quot; and when before , and was then later lowered to .
** Proto-Germanic *&quot;gebō&quot; &#x27;gift&#x27; &gt; Northwest Germanic *&quot;geƀu,&quot; whence
*** North Germanic * &gt; with &quot;u&quot;-umlaut *&quot;gjǫvu&quot; &gt; ON ,
*** West Germanic *&quot;gebu&quot; &gt; OE vs. Gothic (vowel lowering).
** Proto-Germanic *&quot;tungǭ&quot; &#x27;tongue&#x27; &gt; late Northwest Germanic *&quot;tungā&quot; &gt; *&quot;tunga&quot; &gt; ON , OHG , OE (unstressed &quot;a&quot; &gt; &quot;e&quot;) vs. Gothic .
** Proto-Germanic gen. sg. *&quot;gebōz&quot; &#x27;of a gift&#x27; &gt; late Northwest Germanic *&quot;gebāz,&quot; whence
*** North Germanic * &gt; ON ,
*** West Germanic * &gt; OHG , OE (unstressed &quot;a&quot; &gt; &quot;e&quot;) vs. Gothic .
* The development of i-umlaut.
* The rhotacism of to , with presumably a rhotic fricative of some kind as an earlier stage.
** This change probably affected West Germanic much earlier and then spread from there to North Germanic, but failed to reach East Germanic which had already split off by that time. This is confirmed by an intermediate stage &quot;ʀ&quot;, clearly attested in late runic East Norse at a time when West Germanic had long merged the sound with .
* The development of the demonstrative pronoun ancestral to English &quot;this&quot;.
** Germanic *&quot;sa&quot;, &quot;sō&quot;, &quot;þat&quot; &#x27;this, that&#x27; (cf. ON m., &quot;sú&quot; f., &quot;þat&quot; n.; OE , , ; Gothic m., f., n.) + proximal *&quot;si&quot; &#x27;here&#x27; (cf. ON , OHG , Gothic &#x27;lo!, behold!&#x27;);
*** Runic Norse: nom. sg. &quot;sa-si&quot;, gen. &quot;þes-si&quot;, dat. &quot;þeim-si&quot; etc., with declension of the first part;
** fixed form with declension on the second part: ON , m., OHG m., OE m., f., n.

Some have argued that after East Germanic broke off from the group, the remaining Germanic languages, the Northwest Germanic languages, divided into four main dialects: North Germanic, and the three groups conventionally called &quot;West Germanic&quot;, namely
# North Sea Germanic (Ingvaeonic languages, ancestral to the Anglo-Frisian languages and Low German),
# Weser–Rhine Germanic (Low Franconian languages) and
# Elbe Germanic (High German languages).

The inability of the tree model to explain the existence of some features in the West Germanic languages stimulated the development of an alternative, the so-called wave model.

Under this view, the properties that the West Germanic languages have in common separate from the North Germanic languages are not inherited from a &quot;Proto-West-Germanic&quot; language, but rather spread by language contact among the Germanic languages spoken in central Europe, not reaching those spoken in Scandinavia.

===North Germanic features===
Some innovations are not found in West and East Germanic, such as:
* Sharpening of geminate and according to Holtzmann&#x27;s law
** Occurred also in East Germanic, but with a different outcome.
** Proto-Germanic *&quot;twajjǫ̂&quot; (&quot;of two&quot;) &gt; Old Norse , Gothic , but &gt; Old High German 
**Proto-Germanic &quot;*triwwiz&quot; (&quot;faithful&quot;) &gt; Old Norse , Gothic , but &gt; Old High German , German , Old English , English &quot;true&quot;.
* Word-final devoicing of stop consonants.
** Proto-Germanic *&quot;band&quot; (&quot;I/(s)he bound&quot;) &gt; *&quot;bant&quot; &gt; Old West Norse , Old East Norse , but Old English 
* Loss of medial with compensatory lengthening of the preceding vowel and the following consonant, if present.
** Proto-Germanic *&quot;nahtų&quot; (&quot;night&quot;, accusative) &gt; *&quot;nāttu&quot; &gt; (by u-umlaut) *&quot;nǭttu&quot; &gt; Old Norse 
* &gt; before (but not )
** Proto-Germanic *&quot;sairaz&quot; (&quot;sore&quot;) &gt; *&quot;sāraz&quot; &gt; *&quot;sārz&quot; &gt; Old Norse , but &gt; *&quot;seira&quot; &gt; Old High German .
** With original Proto-Germanic *&quot;gaizaz&quot; &gt; *&quot;geizz&quot; &gt; Old Norse .
* General loss of word-final , following the loss of word-final short vowels (which are still present in the earliest runic inscriptions).
** Proto-Germanic *&quot;bindaną&quot; &gt; *&quot;bindan&quot; &gt; Old Norse , but &gt; Old English .
** This also affected stressed syllables: Proto-Germanic *&quot;in&quot; &gt; Old Norse 
* Vowel breaking of to except after , or (see &quot;gift&quot; above).
** The diphthong was also affected (also ), shifting to at an early stage. This diphthong is preserved in Old Gutnish and survives in modern Gutnish. In other Norse dialects, the -onset and length remained, but the diphthong simplified resulting in variously or .
** This affected only stressed syllables. The word *&quot;ek&quot; (&quot;I&quot;), which could occur both stressed and unstressed, appears varyingly as (unstressed, with no breaking) and (stressed, with breaking) throughout Old Norse.
* Loss of initial (see &quot;year&quot; above), and also of before a round vowel.
** Proto-Germanic *&quot;wulfaz&quot; &gt; North Germanic &gt; Old Norse 
* The development of u-umlaut, which rounded stressed vowels when or followed in the next syllable. This followed vowel breaking, with &quot;ja&quot; being u-umlauted to &quot;jǫ&quot; .

===Middle Ages===

After the Old Norse period, the North Germanic languages developed into an East Scandinavian branch, consisting of Danish, Swedish and Old Gutnish, and a West Scandinavian branch, consisting of Norwegian, Faroese and Icelandic. Norwegian settlers brought Old West Norse to Iceland and the Faroe Islands around 800. Of the modern Scandinavian languages, written Icelandic is closest to this ancient language. An additional language, known as Norn, developed on Orkney and Shetland after Vikings had settled there around 800, but this language became extinct around 1700.

In medieval times, speakers of all the Scandinavian languages could understand one another to a significant degree, and it was often referred to as a single language, called the &quot;Danish tongue&quot; until the 13th century by some in Sweden and Iceland. In the 16th century, many Danes and Swedes still referred to North Germanic as a single language, which is stated in the introduction to the first Danish translation of the Bible and in Olaus Magnus&#x27; &quot;A Description of the Northern Peoples&quot;. Dialectal variation between west and east in Old Norse however was certainly present during the Middle Ages and several dialects had emerged. Old Icelandic was essentially identical to Old Norwegian, at least until about 1000, and together they formed the Old West Norse dialect of Old Norse and were also spoken in settlements in the Faroe Islands, Ireland, Scotland, the Isle of Man, and Norwegian settlements in Normandy. The Old East Norse dialect was spoken in Denmark, Sweden, settlements in Russia, England, and Danish settlements in Normandy. Old Gutnish was spoken in Gotland and in various settlements in the East.

Yet, by 1600, another classification of the North Germanic language branches had arisen from a syntactic point of view, dividing them into an insular group (Icelandic and Faroese) and a continental group (Danish, Norwegian and Swedish). The division between Insular Nordic (&quot;önordiska&quot;/&quot;ønordisk&quot;/&quot;øynordisk&quot;) and Continental Scandinavian (&quot;Skandinavisk&quot;) is based on mutual intelligibility between the two groups and developed due to different influences, particularly the political union of Denmark and Norway (1536–1814) which led to significant Danish influence on central and eastern Norwegian dialects (Bokmål or Dano-Norwegian).

==Demographics==
The North Germanic languages are national languages in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden, whereas the non-Germanic Finnish is spoken by the majority in Finland. In inter-Nordic contexts, texts are today often presented in three versions: Finnish, Icelandic, and one of the three languages Danish, Norwegian and Swedish. Another official language in the Nordic countries is Greenlandic (in the Eskimo–Aleut family), the sole official language of Greenland.

In Southern Jutland in southwestern Denmark, German is also spoken by the North Schleswig Germans, and German is a recognized minority language in this region. German is the primary language among the Danish minority of Southern Schleswig, and likewise, Danish is the primary language of the North Schleswig Germans. Both minority groups are highly bilingual.

Traditionally, Danish and German were the two official languages of Denmark–Norway; laws and other official instruments for use in Denmark and Norway were written in Danish, and local administrators spoke Danish or Norwegian. German was the administrative language of Holstein and the Duchy of Schleswig.

Sami languages form an unrelated group that has coexisted with the North Germanic language group in Scandinavia since prehistory. Sami, like Finnish, is part of the group of the Uralic languages.
During centuries of interaction, Finnish and Sami have imported many more loanwords from North Germanic languages than vice versa.
:* The figure includes 450,000 members of the Swedish-speaking population of Finland

==Classification==
In historical linguistics, the North Germanic family tree is divided into two branches, &quot;West Scandinavian languages&quot; (Norwegian, Faroese and Icelandic) and &quot;East Scandinavian languages&quot; (Danish and Swedish), along with various dialects and varieties. The two branches are derived from the western and eastern dialect groups of Old Norse respectively. The East Scandinavian languages (and modern Norwegian, through Danish) were heavily influenced by Middle Low German during the period of Hanseatic expansion.

Another way of classifying the languages – focusing on mutual intelligibility rather than the tree-of-life model – posits Norwegian, Danish, and Swedish as &quot;Continental Scandinavian&quot;, and Faroese and Icelandic as &quot;Insular Scandinavian&quot;. Because of the long political union between Norway and Denmark, moderate and conservative Norwegian Bokmål share most of the Danish vocabulary and grammar, and was nearly identical to written Danish until the spelling reform of 1907. (For this reason, Bokmål and its unofficial, more conservative variant &quot;Riksmål&quot; are sometimes considered East Scandinavian, and Nynorsk West Scandinavian via the west–east division shown above.)

However, Danish has developed a greater distance between the spoken and written versions of the language, so the differences between spoken Norwegian and spoken Danish are somewhat more significant than the difference between their respective written forms. Written Danish is relatively close to the other Continental Scandinavian languages, but the sound developments of spoken Danish include reduction and assimilation of consonants and vowels, as well as the prosodic feature called &quot;stød&quot; in Danish, developments which have not occurred in the other languages (though the &quot;stød&quot; corresponds to the changes in pitch in Norwegian and Swedish, which are pitch-accent languages). Scandinavians are widely expected to understand some of the other spoken Scandinavian languages. There may be some difficulty particularly with elderly dialect speakers, however public radio and television presenters are often well understood by speakers of the other Scandinavian countries, although there are various regional differences of mutual intelligibility for understanding mainstream dialects of the languages between different parts of the three language areas.

Sweden left the Kalmar Union in 1523 due to conflicts with Denmark, leaving two Scandinavian units: The union of Denmark–Norway (ruled from Copenhagen, Denmark) and Sweden (including present-day Finland). The two countries took different sides during several wars until 1814, when the Denmark-Norway unit was disestablished, and made different international contacts. This led to different borrowings from foreign languages (Sweden had a francophone period), for example the Old Swedish word &quot;vindöga&quot; &#x27;window&#x27; was replaced by &quot;fönster&quot; (from Middle Low German), whereas native &quot;vindue&quot; was kept in Danish. Norwegians, who spoke (and still speak) the Norwegian dialects derived from Old Norse, would say &quot;vindauga&quot; or similar. The written language of Denmark-Norway however, was based on the dialect of Copenhagen and thus had &quot;vindue&quot;. On the other hand, the word &quot;begynde&quot; &#x27;begin&#x27; (now written &quot;begynne&quot; in Norwegian Bokmål) was borrowed into Danish and Norwegian, whereas native &quot;börja&quot; was kept in Swedish. Even though standard Swedish and Danish were moving apart, the dialects were not influenced that much. Thus Norwegian and Swedish remained similar in pronunciation, and words like &quot;børja&quot; were able to survive in some of the Norwegian dialects whereas &quot;vindöga&quot; survived in some of the Swedish dialects. Nynorsk incorporates much of these words, like &quot;byrja&quot; (cf. Swedish &quot;börja&quot;, Danish &quot;begynde&quot;), &quot;veke&quot; (cf. Sw &quot;vecka&quot;, Dan &quot;uge&quot;) and &quot;vatn&quot; (Sw &quot;vatten&quot;, Dan &quot;vand&quot;) whereas Bokmål has retained the Danish forms (&quot;begynne&quot;, &quot;uke&quot;, &quot;vann&quot;). As a result, Nynorsk does not conform to the above east–west split model, since it shares a lot of features with Swedish. According to the Norwegian linguist Arne Torp, the Nynorsk project (which had as a goal to re-establish a written Norwegian language) would have been much harder to carry out if Norway had been in a union with Sweden instead of with Denmark, simply because the differences would have been smaller.

Currently, English loanwords are influencing the languages. A 2005 survey of words used by speakers of the Scandinavian languages showed that the number of English loanwords used in the languages has doubled during the last 30 years and is now 1.2%. Icelandic has imported fewer English words than the other North Germanic languages, despite the fact that it is the country that uses English most.

=== Mutual intelligibility ===
The mutual intelligibility between the Continental Scandinavian languages is asymmetrical. Various studies have shown Norwegian speakers to be the best in Scandinavia at understanding other languages within the language group. According to a study undertaken during 2002–2005 and funded by the Nordic Cultural Fund, Swedish speakers in Stockholm and Danish speakers in Copenhagen have the greatest difficulty in understanding other Nordic languages. The study, which focused mainly on native speakers under the age of 25, showed that the lowest ability to comprehend another language is demonstrated by youth in Stockholm in regard to Danish, producing the lowest ability score in the survey. The greatest variation in results between participants within the same country was also demonstrated by the Swedish speakers in the study. Participants from Malmö, located in the southernmost Swedish province of Scania (Skåne), demonstrated a better understanding of Danish than Swedish speakers to the north.

Access to Danish television and radio, direct trains to Copenhagen over the Øresund Bridge and a larger number of cross-border commuters in the Øresund Region contribute to a better knowledge of spoken Danish and a better knowledge of the unique Danish words among the region&#x27;s inhabitants. According to the study, youth in this region were able to understand the Danish language (slightly) better than the Norwegian language. But they still could not understand Danish as well as the Norwegians could, demonstrating once again the relative distance of Swedish from Danish. Youth in Copenhagen had a very poor command of Swedish, showing that the Øresund connection was mostly one-way.

The results from the study of how well native youth in different Scandinavian cities did when tested on their knowledge of the other Continental Scandinavian languages are summarized in table format, reproduced below. The maximum score was 10.0:

Faroese speakers (of the Insular Scandinavian languages group) are even better than the Norwegians at comprehending two or more languages within the Continental Scandinavian languages group, scoring high in both Danish (which they study at school) and Norwegian and having the highest score on a Scandinavian language other than their native language, as well as the highest average score. Icelandic speakers, in contrast, have a poor command of Norwegian and Swedish. They do somewhat better with Danish, as they are taught Danish in school (Icelandic is not mutually intelligible with Scandinavian languages, nor any language, not even Faroese, which is though closest). When speakers of Faroese and Icelandic were tested on how well they understood the three Continental Scandinavian languages, the test results were as follows (maximum score 10.0):

===Vocabulary===
The North Germanic languages share many lexical, grammatical, phonological, and morphological similarities, to a more significant extent than the West Germanic languages do. These lexical, grammatical, and morphological similarities can be outlined in the table below.

===Language boundaries===
Given the aforementioned homogeneity, there exists some discussion on whether the continental group should be considered one or several languages. The Continental Scandinavian languages are often cited as proof of the aphorism &quot;A language is a dialect with an army and navy&quot;. The differences in dialects within the countries of Norway, Sweden, and Denmark can often be greater than the differences across the borders, but the political independence of these countries leads continental Scandinavian to be classified into Norwegian, Swedish, and Danish in the popular mind as well as among most linguists. The generally agreed upon language border is, in other words, politically shaped. This is also because of the strong influence of the standard languages, particularly in Denmark and Sweden. Even if the language policy of Norway has been more tolerant of rural dialectal variation in formal language, the prestige dialect often referred to as &quot;Eastern Urban Norwegian&quot;, spoken mainly in and around the Oslo region, is sometimes considered normative. The influence of a standard Norwegian is nevertheless less so than in Denmark and Sweden, since the prestige dialect in Norway has moved geographically several times over the past 200 years. The organised formation of Nynorsk out of western Norwegian dialects after Norway became independent from Denmark in 1814 intensified the politico-linguistic divisions.

The Nordic Council has on several occasions referred to the (Germanic) languages spoken in Scandinavia as the &quot;Scandinavian language&quot; (singular); for instance, the official newsletter of the Nordic Council is written in the &quot;Scandinavian language&quot;. The creation of one unified written language has been considered as highly unlikely, given the failure to agree upon a common standardized language in Norway. However, there is a slight chance of &quot;some uniformization of spelling&quot; between Norway, Sweden and Denmark.

=== Family tree ===

All North Germanic languages are descended from Old Norse. Divisions between subfamilies of North Germanic are rarely precisely defined: Most form continuous clines, with adjacent dialects being mutually intelligible and the most separated ones not.

=== Classification difficulties ===
The Jamtlandic dialects share many characteristics with both Trøndersk and with Norrländska mål. Due to this ambiguous position, it is contested whether Jamtlandic belongs to the West Scandinavian or the East Scandinavian group.

Elfdalian (Älvdalen speech), generally considered a &quot;Sveamål&quot; dialect, today has an official orthography and is, because of a lack of mutual intelligibility with Swedish, considered as a separate language by many linguists. Traditionally regarded as a Swedish dialect, but by several criteria closer to West Scandinavian dialects, Elfdalian is a separate language by the standard of mutual intelligibility.

Traveller Danish, Rodi, and Swedish Romani are varieties of Danish, Norwegian and Swedish with Romani vocabulary or Para-Romani known collectively as the Scandoromani language. They are spoken by Norwegian and Swedish Travellers. The Scando-Romani varieties in Sweden and Norway combine elements from the dialects of Western Sweden, Eastern Norway (Østlandet) and Trøndersk.

=== Written norms of Norwegian ===

Norwegian has two official written norms, Bokmål and Nynorsk. In addition, there are some unofficial norms. &quot;Riksmål&quot; is more conservative than Bokmål (that is, closer to Danish) and is used to various extents by numerous people, especially in the cities and by the largest newspaper in Norway, . On the other hand, &quot;Høgnorsk&quot; (High Norwegian) is similar to Nynorsk and is used by a very small minority.

<text>In poetry, a dimeter is a metrical line of verse with two feet. The particular foot can vary.

Consider Thomas Hood&#x27;s &quot;Bridge of Sighs,&quot; in which the first line of a pair is of two feet, each composed of three syllables, and the subsequent line is of two feet, each of two syllables.

<text>The Norsemen (or Northmen) were a North Germanic linguistic group of the Early Middle Ages, during which they spoke the Old Norse language. The language belongs to the North Germanic branch of the Indo-European languages and is the predecessor of the modern Germanic languages of Scandinavia. During the late eighth century, Scandinavians embarked on a large-scale expansion in all directions, giving rise to the Viking Age. In English-language scholarship since the 19th century, Norse seafaring traders, settlers and warriors have commonly been referred to as Vikings. 

Historians of Anglo-Saxon England often use the term &quot;Norse&quot; in a different sense, distinguishing between Norse Vikings (Norsemen) from Norway, who mainly invaded and occupied the islands north and north-west of Britain as well as Ireland and western Britain, and Danish Vikings, who principally invaded and occupied eastern Britain.

== History of the terms &quot;Norseman&quot; and &quot;Northman&quot; ==

The word &quot;Norseman&quot; first appears in English during the early 19th century: the earliest attestation given in the third edition of the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; is from Walter Scott&#x27;s 1817 &quot;Harold the Dauntless&quot;. The word was coined using the adjective &quot;norse&quot;, which was borrowed into English from Dutch during the 16th century with the sense &#x27;Norwegian&#x27;, and which by Scott&#x27;s time had acquired the sense &quot;of or relating to Scandinavia or its language, esp[ecially] in ancient or medieval times&quot;. As with modern use of the word &quot;viking&quot;, therefore, the word &quot;norseman&quot; has no particular basis in medieval usage.

The term &quot;Norseman&quot; does echo terms meaning &#x27;Northman&#x27;, applied to Norse-speakers by the peoples they encountered during the Middle Ages. The Old Frankish word (&quot;Northman&quot;) was Latinised as and was widely used in Latin texts. The Latin word then entered Old French as . From this word came the name of the Normans and of Normandy, which was settled by Norsemen in the tenth century.

The same word entered Hispanic languages and local varieties of Latin with forms beginning not only in &quot;n-&quot;, but in &quot;l-&quot;, such as (apparently reflecting nasal dissimilation in local Romance languages). This form may in turn have been borrowed into Arabic: the prominent early Arabic source al-Mas‘ūdī identified the 844 raiders on Seville not only as &quot;Rūs&quot; but also .

The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, written in Old English, distinguishes between the pagan Norwegian Norsemen (&quot;Norðmenn&quot;) of Dublin and the Christian Danes (&quot;Dene&quot;) of the Danelaw. In 942, it records the victory of King Edmund I over the Norse kings of York: &quot;The Danes were previously subjected by force under the Norsemen, for a long time in bonds of captivity to the heathens&quot;.

== Other names ==

In modern scholarship, &quot;Vikings&quot; is a common term for attacking Norsemen, especially in connection with raids and monastic plundering by Norsemen in the British Isles, but it was not used in this sense at the time. In Old Norse and Old English, the word simply meant &#x27;pirate&#x27;.

The Norse were also known as , &quot;ashmen&quot;, by the Germans, (Norse) by the Gaels and (Danes) by the Anglo-Saxons.

The Gaelic terms (Norwegian Viking or Norwegian), (Danish Viking or Danish) and (foreign Gaelic) were used for the people of Norse descent in Ireland and Scotland, who assimilated into the Gaelic culture. Dubliners called them Ostmen, or East-people, and the name Oxmanstown (an area in central Dublin; the name is still current) comes from one of their settlements; they were also known as , or Lake-people.

The Slavs, the Arabs and the Byzantines knew them as the &quot;Rus&#x27;&quot; or (), probably derived from various uses of , i.e. &quot;related to rowing&quot;, or from the area of Roslagen in east-central Sweden, where most of the Northmen who visited the Eastern Slavic lands originated.

Archaeologists and historians of today believe that these Scandinavian settlements in the East Slavic lands formed the names of the countries of Russia and Belarus.

The Slavs and the Byzantines also called them &quot;Varangians&quot; (, meaning &quot;sworn men&quot;), and the Scandinavian bodyguards of the Byzantine emperors were known as the Varangian Guard.

Modern descendants of Norsemen are described as Scandinavians.

== Geography ==

The British conception of the Vikings&#x27; origins was inaccurate. Those who plundered Britain lived in what is today Denmark, Scania, the western coast of Sweden and Norway (up to almost the 70th parallel) and along the Swedish Baltic coast up to around the 60th latitude and Lake Mälaren. They also came from the island of Gotland, Sweden. The border between the Norsemen and more southerly Germanic tribes, the Danevirke, today is located about south of the Danish–German border. The southernmost living Vikings lived no further north than Newcastle upon Tyne, and travelled to Britain more from the east than from the north.

The Norse Scandinavians established polities and settlements in what are now Great Britain (England, Scotland, Wales), Ireland, Iceland, Russia, Belarus, France, Sicily, Belgium, Ukraine, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Germany, Poland, Greenland, Canada, and the Faroe Islands.

<doc id="153476" wikidata="Q1365004" url="?curid=153476" title="Memnoch the Devil">
<text>Memnoch the Devil (1995) is a vampire novel by American writer Anne Rice, the fifth in her &quot;Vampire Chronicles&quot; series, following &quot;The Tale of the Body Thief&quot;. In this story, Lestat is approached by the Devil and offered a job at his side.

The title and many themes of this novel are borrowed from the 19th-century gothic novel &quot;Melmoth the Wanderer&quot; by Irish author Charles Maturin.

==Plot==
After stalking and killing Roger, a ruthless but passionate mobster, Lestat is approached by Roger&#x27;s ghost. Roger asks him to take care of his daughter Dora, a devout and popular televangelist, whom he wants to spare from embarrassment. At the same time, Lestat has become increasingly paranoid that he&#x27;s being stalked by a powerful force. Eventually, Lestat meets the Devil, who calls himself Memnoch. He takes Lestat on a whirlwind tour of Heaven and Hell, and retells the entirety of history from his own point of view in an effort to convince Lestat to join him as God&#x27;s adversary. In his journey, Memnoch claims he is not evil, but merely working for God by ushering lost souls into Heaven. Lestat is left in confusion, unable to decide whether or not to cast his lot with the Devil.

After the tour, Lestat believes himself to have had a major revelation. Among other things, he believes that he has seen Christ&#x27;s crucifixion and has received Saint Veronica&#x27;s Veil. Even though Lestat suspects the entire experience was some kind of deception, he tells his story to Armand, David Talbot and Dora, who have joined him in New York City. When Lestat produces the veil as proof of his experience, Dora and Armand are deeply moved upon seeing it. Dora reveals the veil to the world, triggering a religious movement. Armand goes into the sunlight and immolates himself in order to convince people that a miracle has occurred.

At the end of the novel, Lestat and David go to New Orleans. There, Maharet returns an eye Lestat lost in Hell, along with a note from Memnoch that reveals he may have been manipulating Lestat to serve his own agenda. Lestat then loses control of himself and Maharet is forced to chain him in the basement of a vampire-controlled convent so that he will not hurt himself or others.

Although the novel fits into the storyline of &quot;The Vampire Chronicles&quot;, the vast majority of it consists of Memnoch&#x27;s account of cosmology and theology. The novel follows up on claims made by David in &quot;The Tale of the Body Thief&quot; that God and the Devil are on better terms than most Christians believe. It also reinterprets biblical stories to create a complete history of Earth, Heaven and Hell that fit neatly with the history of vampires given in &quot;The Queen of the Damned&quot;.

==Characters==

*Lestat de Lioncourt – The main character of the story and the past four books, Lestat was created by a powerful vampire named Magnus, who promptly cremated himself after creating his heir. Lestat is a relatively &quot;good&quot; vampire, only feeding on those he deems evil after reading their minds. In previous books, Lestat made the man named David Talbot a vampire by force, an action that went against vampire law.
*Theodora, nicknamed &quot;Dora&quot; – A devout Christian who has a cable TV show. She is very beautiful and charismatic. She is waiting for a miracle to inspire her. Dora is the daughter of Roger. She won&#x27;t take anything from Roger because he is a mobster. Lestat becomes obsessed with her in the process of hunting her father. Despite the warnings of his vampire kin, he reveals himself to her and she takes it as the miracle she&#x27;s been awaiting. When Lestat brings her Veronica&#x27;s veil, Dora starts her own religion.
*Roger – Dora&#x27;s father. A mobster who runs a successful drug ring selling cocaine. When Dora&#x27;s mother tried to take full custody of her, Roger killed her. After his death, he haunts Lestat, describing his own life and commanding Lestat to watch over Dora from then on.
*God – Creator and ruler of the universe and all angels. According to Memnoch, He does not know how He came to be and therefore created the universe and life in an attempt to better understand Himself. In telling his account of creation, Memnoch characterizes God as aloof and uncaring.
*Memnoch the Devil – The fallen angel of legend also known as Satan or Lucifer. He has long defied God in asking why humans should suffer and not immediately be placed in Heaven. Because of these questions and other actions that he makes, he alleges that he is put in charge of preparing the souls for their ascent into Heaven. Memnoch&#x27;s domain thus serves as a place of punishment that will eventually earn access to Heaven. He may have sinister ulterior motives. In the novel Prince Lestat and the Realms of Atlantis, it is alluded to that Memnoch may have been an inhuman spirit that dwelled in the place between the physical realm and Heaven.

== Cosmology ==
The universe as revealed to Lestat by the Devil follows the following cosmology:

God is a powerful and immortal being worshipped by angels, His first creation, since before the existence of matter and time. The Earth was His creation. Because of this, angels spent much time admiring His handiwork and singing His praises. However, God does not appear to be omniscient or even entirely omnibenevolent. Despite assurances, Memnoch, an archangel, claims to have changed God&#x27;s opinion on the importance and supernatural quality of humanity.

Through evolution, creatures on the Earth developed into the image of God and angels and a &quot;flame&quot; of life which allowed pain and death. Eventually, humans developed their own souls, invisible and incorporeal spiritual essences similar to God and the angels. This shocks and horrifies many of the angels. These souls collect in confusion around the world in an airy realm that the angels describe as &quot;Sheol&quot; or &quot;the Gloom&quot;, attempting to come to terms with their existence. Some dissipate into nothing, some do not realize or do not accept they are dead. Some take comfort and strength from their living descendants, becoming patron ancestors. Such interventions cause the tales of spirits, reincarnation and the first vampires.

The addle-brained spirits (mentioned in &quot;The Queen of the Damned&quot; and &quot;The Witching Hour&quot;) are of two types. The first are angels who fell in love with certain parts of nature and became spirits of rocks, mountains, and trees; they did not return to Heaven. The &quot;invisible ones&quot; are incorporeal human souls who never interacted with the angels, forgot they were ever human, and became demons—spirits or lesser gods whom the living worship.

Memnoch becomes impatient with God&#x27;s constant assurances that all is well, despite the pain and suffering of life and death. Memnoch vehemently criticizes God&#x27;s plan, accusing God of lacking vision and benevolence. Memnoch decides to collect evidence to persuade God that humanity is outside of nature by creating physical form. When, as part of this, he experiences sex, God bans Memnoch from Heaven; Memnoch spends the next three months imparting his vast knowledge of science to humanity, thus inadvertently founding civilization, during which time Memnoch realizes that the characteristic that sets humans apart is their ability to love and feel passionate.

When God invites Memnoch to Heaven to explain his disturbance of the natural order of creation, Memnoch persuades God to allow him to find souls who are suitable for Heaven. After thousands of years wandering Sheol, Memnoch discovers an especially powerful group of souls who have forgiven God for His indifference and absence and appreciate the grandness of all creation. God accepts these souls into Heaven, changing it forever.

God is highly pleased with the new composition of Heaven, but Memnoch continues to accuse God of not showing concern for the other souls of Sheol. Memnoch finally loses trust in God and demands that He should take human form to understand passion and, in fury, God banishes Memnoch from Heaven.

While Memnoch is in exile, God takes on a human form, Jesus. God believes that by appearing in human form, performing miracles, suffering and dying, He will create a religion that will allow more humans to attain the love of God by suffering and sacrifice. This is in sharp contrast to Memnoch&#x27;s approach of attaining purity through love and experience of the wonders of creation. The two confront each other in the desert. God continuously argues that Man is a creature of Nature and ruled by its laws; only through suffering and death can man evolve and eventually be worthy of Heaven. Memnoch continuously argues that suffering and death has no value, and Man needlessly suffers in Life and in Sheol while already worthy of God&#x27;s light yet deprived of knowing Him.

Memnoch is awed and shocked by God&#x27;s sacrifice. Nevertheless, he argues that God did not put Himself through enough. Unlike a regular human, when God died on the cross He knew that He would survive and thus could never have known the true suffering of Man: the fear of death. Man does not know his immortal soul will survive for all eternity, and thus suffers from fear of the unknown. God knew He would survive death and could not truly know what it was to be a human. For God, this complaint is the last straw: He declares Memnoch to be His adversary, and commands him to rule Sheol and Earth in a devilish form, preparing souls for Heaven in his own fashion.

As human history progresses, God&#x27;s religion only exacerbates the suffering of Man instead of alleviating it. Acts of hate—war, persecution, genocide—are carried out in His name. Working in Sheol, Memnoch creates a form of Hell, a place where people who have been bad in life, will be punished until their souls are able to forgive all (themselves, each other, and God) for the suffering and ignorance they endured in order to understand the joy of creation and the light of God enough to be ready for Heaven. Memnoch doesn&#x27;t like this work and is constantly asking God to appoint someone else to the job (as David Talbot witnesses in &quot;The Tale of the Body Thief&quot;).

==Reception==
Maryanne Booth reviewed &quot;Memnoch: The Devil&quot; for &quot;Arcane&quot; magazine, rating it a 4 out of 10 overall. Booth comments that &quot;If this is the last of the &quot;Vampire Chronicles&quot;, it&#x27;s a dismal conclusion to an inspiring series of books that won Anne Rice many admirers.&quot; Michael McLeod writing for &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; described the book as a cross between a creature feature and &quot;The 700 Club&quot; and said that Rice&#x27;s &quot;[...] proportions are so epic that her dark hero gets lost among them.&quot;

<text>Charles I (, ; 17 August 18871 April 1922) was Emperor of Austria, King of Hungary, and the ruler of the other states of the Habsburg monarchy from November 1916 until the monarchy was abolished in November 1918. He was the last of the monarchs belonging to the House of Habsburg-Lorraine to rule over Austria-Hungary. The son of Archduke Otto of Austria and Princess Maria Josepha of Saxony, Charles became heir presumptive of Emperor Franz Joseph when his uncle Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria was assassinated in 1914. In 1911, he married Princess Zita of Bourbon-Parma.

Charles succeeded to the thrones in November 1916 following the death of his great-uncle, Franz Joseph. He began secret negotiations with the Allies, hoping to peacefully end the First World War, but was unsuccessful. Despite Charles&#x27;s efforts to preserve the empire by returning it to federalism and by championing Austro-Slavism, Austria-Hungary hurtled into disintegration: Czechoslovakia and the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs were proclaimed, and Hungary broke monarchic ties to Austria by the end of October 1918. Following the Armistice of 11 November 1918, Charles &quot;renounced any participation&quot; in government affairs, but did not abdicate. However, the Republic of German-Austria was proclaimed the following day, and in April 1919 the National Assembly formally dethroned the Habsburgs and banished Charles from German-Austria for life.

Charles spent the early part of his exile in Switzerland. He spent the remaining years of his life attempting to restore the monarchy. He made two attempts to reclaim the Hungarian throne in 1921; but failed due to the opposition of Hungary&#x27;s Calvinist regent Admiral Miklós Horthy. Charles was exiled for a second time to the Portuguese island of Madeira, where he soon fell ill and died of respiratory failure in 1922.

A deeply religious man, Charles was beatified by the Catholic Church in 2004, with October 21 as his feast day.

==Early life==
Charles was born on 17 August 1887, in the Castle of Persenbeug, in Lower Austria. His parents were Archduke Otto Franz of Austria and Princess Maria Josepha of Saxony. At the time, his grand-uncle Franz Joseph reigned as Emperor of Austria and King of Hungary. Upon the death of Crown Prince Rudolph in 1889, the Emperor&#x27;s brother, Archduke Karl Ludwig, Charles&#x27; grandfather, was next in line to the Austro-Hungarian throne. However, his death in 1896 from typhoid made his eldest son, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the new heir presumptive.

Archduke Charles was raised a devout Catholic. He spent his early years wherever his father&#x27;s regiment happened to be stationed; later on, he lived in Vienna and Reichenau an der Rax. He was privately educated, but, contrary to the custom ruling in the imperial family, he attended a public gymnasium (the Schottengymnasium) for the sake of demonstrations in scientific subjects. On the conclusion of his studies at the gymnasium, he entered the army, spending the years from 1906 to 1908 as an officer chiefly in Prague, where he studied Law and Political Science concurrently with his military duties.

In 1907, he was declared of age, and Prince Zdenko von Lobkowitz was appointed as his chamberlain. During the next few years, he carried out his military duties in various Bohemian garrison towns. Charles&#x27;s relations with his great-uncle were not intimate, and those with his uncle Franz Ferdinand were not cordial, with the differences between their wives increasing the existing tension between them. For these reasons, Charles, up to the time of the assassination of his uncle in 1914, obtained no insight into affairs of state, but led the life of a prince not destined for a high political position.

== Marriage ==

On 21 October 1911, Charles married Princess Zita of Bourbon-Parma. They had met as children but did not see one another for almost ten years, as each pursued their education. In 1909, his dragoon regiment was stationed at Brandýs nad Labem in Bohemia, from where he visited his aunt at Franzensbad.

It was during one of these visits that Charles and Zita became reacquainted. Due to Franz Ferdinand&#x27;s morganatic marriage in 1900, his children were excluded from the succession. As a result, the Emperor pressured Charles to marry. Zita not only shared Charles&#x27;s devout Catholicism, but also an impeccable royal lineage. Zita later recalled:

Archduke Charles traveled to Villa Pianore, the Italian winter residence of Zita&#x27;s parents, and asked for her hand; on 13 June 1911, their engagement was announced at the Austrian court. Charles and Zita were married at the Bourbon-Parma castle of Schwarzau in Austria on 21 October 1911. Charles&#x27;s granduncle, the 81-year-old Emperor Franz Joseph, attended the wedding. He was relieved to see the second-in-line to the throne in a suitable marriage, and was in good spirits, even leading the toast at the wedding breakfast. Archduchess Zita soon conceived a son, and Otto was born 20 November 1912. Seven more children followed in the next decade.

==Heir presumptive==

Charles, whose father had died in 1906, became heir presumptive after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, his uncle, in Sarajevo in 1914, the event which precipitated World War I. The old Emperor took steps to initiate Charles in affairs of state, but the outbreak of World War I interfered with this political education. Charles spent the first phase of the war at headquarters at Teschen, but exercised no military influence.

Charles then became a &quot;Feldmarschall&quot; (Field Marshal) in the Austro-Hungarian Army. In the spring of 1916, in connection with the offensive against Italy, he was entrusted with the command of the XX. Corps, whose affections he won by his affability and friendliness. The offensive, after a successful start, soon came to a standstill. Shortly afterwards, Charles went to the eastern front as commander of Army Group Archduke Karl operating against the Russians and Romanians.

==Reign==


Charles succeeded to the thrones on 21 November 1916 upon the death of his grand-uncle, Emperor Franz Joseph. On 2 December 1916, he assumed the title of Supreme Commander of the Austro-Hungarian Army, succeeding Archduke Friedrich. His coronation as King of Hungary occurred on 30 December. In 1917, Charles secretly entered into peace negotiations with France. He employed his brother-in-law, Prince Sixtus of Bourbon-Parma, an officer in the Belgian Army, as intermediary. However, the Allies insisted on Austrian recognition of Italian claims to territory and Charles refused, so no progress was made. Foreign minister Graf Czernin was only interested in negotiating a general peace which would include Germany; Charles himself went much further in suggesting his willingness to make a separate peace. When news of what became known as the Sixtus Affair leaked in April 1918, Charles denied involvement until French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau published letters signed by him. This led to Czernin&#x27;s resignation, forcing Austria-Hungary to give Berlin full control of its armed forces, factories, and railways.

The Austro-Hungarian Empire was wracked by inner turmoil in the final years of the war, with escalating tension between ethnic groups. As part of his Fourteen Points, U.S. President Woodrow Wilson demanded that the Empire allow for autonomy and self-determination of its peoples. In response, Charles agreed to reconvene the Imperial Parliament and allow for the creation of a confederation with each national group exercising self-governance. However, the ethnic groups fought for full autonomy as separate nations, as they were now determined to become independent from Vienna at the earliest possible moment.

The new foreign minister Baron Istvan Burián asked for an armistice on 14 October based on the Fourteen Points, and two days later Charles issued a proclamation that radically changed the nature of the Austrian state. The Poles were granted full independence with the purpose of joining their ethnic brethren in Russia and Germany in what was to become the Second Polish Republic. The rest of the Austrian lands were transformed into a federal union composed of four parts: German, Czech, South Slav, and Ukrainian. Each of the four parts was to be governed by a federal council, and Trieste was to have a special status. However, U.S. Secretary of State Robert Lansing replied four days later that the Allies were committed to the political independence of the Czechs, Slovaks and South Slavs, and that autonomy inside the Empire was no longer enough. In fact, a Czechoslovak provisional government had joined the Allies on 14 October, and the South Slav national council declared an independent South Slav state on 29 October 1918.

===Trialism and Croatia===
From the beginning of his reign, Charles I favored the creation of a third, Croatian, political entity in the Empire, in addition to Austria and Hungary. In his Croatian coronation oath in 1916, he recognized the union of the Triune Kingdom of Croatia, Dalmatia and Slavonia with Rijeka and during his short reign supported trialist suggestions from the Croatian Sabor and Ban; however, the suggestions were always vetoed by the Hungarian Parliament, which did not want to share power with other nations. After Emperor Charles&#x27;s manifesto of 14 October 1918 was rejected by the declaration of the National Council in Zagreb, President of the Croatian pro-monarchy political party Pure Party of Rights Dr. with Ivo Frank and other parliament members and generals went to visit the emperor on 21 October 1918 in Bad Ischl, where the emperor agreed and signed the trialist manifesto under the proposed terms set by the delegation, on the condition that the Hungarian part does the same since he swore an oath on the integrity of the Hungarian crown. The delegation went the next day to Budapest where it presented the manifesto to Hungarian officials and Council of Ministers who signed the manifesto and released the king from his oath, creating a third Croatian political entity (Zvonimir&#x27;s kingdom). After the signing, two parades were held in Zagreb, one for the ending of the K.u.K. monarchy, which was held in front of the Croatian National Theater, and another one for saving the trialist monarchy. The last vote for the support of the trialist reorganization of the empire was, however, too late. On 29 October 1918, the Croatian Sabor (parliament) ended the union and all ties with Hungary and Austria, proclaimed the unification of all Croatian lands and entered the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs.

The Lansing note effectively ended any efforts to keep the Empire together. One by one, the nationalities proclaimed their independence; even before the note the national councils had been acting more like provisional governments. Charles&#x27;s political future became uncertain. On 31 October, Hungary officially ended the personal union between Austria and Hungary. Nothing remained of Charles&#x27;s realm except the predominantly German-speaking Danubian and Alpine provinces, and he was challenged even there by the German Austrian State Council. His last Austrian prime minister, Heinrich Lammasch, advised him that he was in an impossible situation, and his best course was to temporarily give up his right to exercise sovereign power.

== Proclamations of November 1918 ==

On the day of the Armistice of 11 November 1918, Charles issued a carefully worded proclamation in which he recognized the Austrian people&#x27;s right to determine the form of the state and &quot;relinquish[ed] every participation in the administration of the State.&quot; He also released his officials from their oath of loyalty to him. On the same day, the Imperial Family left Schönbrunn Palace and moved to , east of Vienna. On 13 November, following a visit with Hungarian magnates, Charles issued a similar proclamation—the Eckartsau Proclamation—for Hungary.

Although it has widely been cited as an &quot;abdication&quot;, the word itself was never used in either proclamation. Indeed, he deliberately avoided using the word &quot;abdication&quot; in the hope that the people of either Austria or Hungary would vote to recall him. Privately, Charles left no doubt that he believed himself to be the rightful emperor. He wrote to Friedrich Gustav Cardinal Piffl, the Archbishop of Vienna:

Instead, on 12 November, the day after he issued his proclamation, the independent Republic of German-Austria was proclaimed, followed by the proclamation of the First Hungarian Republic on 16 November. An uneasy truce-like situation ensued and persisted until 23 to 24 March 1919, when Charles left for Switzerland, escorted by the commander of the small British guard detachment at Eckartsau, Lieutenant Colonel Edward Lisle Strutt.

As the imperial train left Austria on 24 March, Charles issued another proclamation in which he confirmed his claim of sovereignty, declaring that:

The newly established republican government of Austria was not aware of this &quot;Manifesto of Feldkirch&quot; at this time—it had been dispatched only to King Alfonso XIII of Spain and to Pope Benedict XV through diplomatic channels—and politicians in power were irritated by the Emperor&#x27;s departure without explicit abdication.

The Austrian Parliament responded on 3 April with the Habsburg Law, which dethroned and banished the Habsburgs. Charles was barred from ever returning to Austria. Other male Habsburgs could only return if they renounced all intentions of reclaiming the defunct throne and accepted the status of ordinary citizens. Another law passed on the same day abolished all nobility in Austria. In Switzerland, Charles and his family briefly took residence at Castle Wartegg near Rorschach at Lake Constance, and later moved to Château de Prangins at Lake Geneva on 20 May.

==Attempts to reclaim throne of Hungary==

Following the restoration of the Kingdom of Hungary, encouraged by Hungarian royalists (&quot;legitimists&quot;), Charles sought twice in 1921 to reclaim the throne of Hungary, but failed largely because Hungary&#x27;s regent, Admiral Miklós Horthy (the last commander of the Imperial and Royal Navy), refused to support Charles&#x27;s restoration. Horthy&#x27;s action was declared &quot;treasonous&quot; by royalists. Critics suggest that Horthy&#x27;s actions were more firmly grounded in political reality than those of Charles and his supporters. Indeed, neighbouring countries had threatened to invade Hungary if Charles tried to regain the throne. Princess Zita however, claimed that Charles had come to a verbal agreement with the French prime minister and foreign minister Aristide Briand (who had supported Charles&#x27; peace efforts in 1917) regarding a Habsburg restoration in Hungary, which meant it would receive French recognition and military backing if successful. In the event of the attempt failing, Briand would deny all involvement, which he indeed did during both attempts. Later in 1921, the Hungarian parliament formally nullified the Pragmatic Sanction, an act that effectively dethroned the Habsburgs in Hungary.

==Exile in Madeira, Portugal, and death==

After the second failed attempt at restoration in Hungary, Charles and his pregnant wife Zita were arrested by the Hungarian authorities and imprisoned in Tihany Abbey. On 1 November 1921 they were transported down the Danube aboard the gunboat HMS &quot;Glowworm&quot;, across the Black Sea on the cruiser , 

Charles received a military escort into exile by order of King George V of the United Kingdom. They were provided escorts into exile because socialist regimes were taking over Vienna, Austria after WWI and there was fear of a potential assassination. The first military escort was Sir Thomas Montgomery-Cuninghame, 10th Baronet. He was followed by John Orlando Summerhayes in Ekartsau. Summerhayes was assigned to his role after leading prisoners-of-war out of Germany and Austria. Emperor Charles I wrote a letter to King George thanking him for sending Colonel Summerhayes for his protection. He wrote that Summerhayes was charming and fulfills his duty as a virtuous and clever man. Furthermore, Summerhayes&#x27; cheerful character was able to brighten the mood of the royal family during their stay in Eckartsau, providing emotional and medical support. Summerhayes was replaced by Edward Lisle Strutt, another British Army Colonel, as protector to emperor. It has been said that the emperor developed a particularly close relationship with Strutt and looked upon him with favor. 

Summerhayes was later sent to accompany Archduke Felix, the fourth child of Charles I, to Switzerland to monitor his health.

On 19 November 1921 Charles and his wife arrived at their final exile, the isolated, heavily guarded Portuguese island of Madeira.

The couple and their children, who joined them on 2 February 1922, lived first at Funchal at the Villa Vittoria, next to Reid&#x27;s Hotel, and later moved to a modest residence in Quinta do Monte.

Charles never left Madeira. On 9 March 1922 he caught a cold in town, which developed into bronchitis and progressed to severe pneumonia. Having suffered two heart attacks, he died of respiratory failure on 1 April, in the presence of his wife (who was pregnant with their eighth child) and nine-year-old former Crown Prince Otto, remaining conscious almost until his last moments. His last words to his wife were &quot;I love you so much.&quot; He was 34 years old. His remains except for his heart are still on the island, resting in state in a chapel devoted to the Emperor in the Portuguese Church of Our Lady of the Mount, in spite of several attempts to move them to the Habsburg Crypt in Vienna. His heart and the heart of his wife are entombed in Muri Abbey, Switzerland.

==Legacy==

Historians have been mixed in their evaluations of Charles and his reign. In the interwar period, he was celebrated in Austria as a military hero. When Nazi Germany took over it made his memory into that of a traitor. For decades after 1945, both popular and academic interest practically disappeared, but attention has slowly returned.

Helmut Rumpler, the head of the Habsburg commission of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, described Charles as &quot;a dilettante, far too weak for the challenges facing him, out of his depth, and not really a politician.&quot; Others have seen Charles as a brave and honourable figure who tried to stop the war in which his Empire was drowning.
Anatole France, the French novelist, stated: 
This war without end is criminal. What is abominable is that they do not want to end it. No, they do not want. Do not try to tell me that there was no way to end it. Emperor Charles offered peace; he is the only decent man to have appeared in this war, and he was not listened to. There was, through him, a chance that could have been seized... Clemenceau called the emperor a &quot;rotten conscience&quot;, it&#x27;s ignoble. Emperor Charles sincerely wanted peace, and therefore was despised by the whole world. [...] A king of France, yes a king, would have had pity on our poor, exhausted, bloodlet nation. However democracy is without a heart and without entrails. When serving the powers of money, it is pitiless and inhuman.

Paul von Hindenburg, the German commander in chief, commented in his memoirs:He tried to compensate for the evaporation of the ethical power which emperor Franz Joseph had represented by offering völkisch reconciliation. Even as he dealt with elements who were sworn to the goal of destroying his empire he believed that his acts of political grace would affect their conscience. These attempts were totally futile; those people had long ago lined up with our common enemies, and were far from being deterred.

==Beatification==
Catholic Church leaders have praised Charles for putting his Christian faith first in making political decisions, and for his role as a peacemaker during the war, especially after 1917.

The &quot;cause&quot; or campaign for his canonization began in Vienna in 1949. On 25 April 1951, the cause was transferred to Rome, and Charles was declared &quot;servant of God&quot;, the first step in the process. At the beginning of the cause for canonization in 1972 his tomb was opened and his body was discovered to be incorrupt.

On 14 April 2003, the Vatican&#x27;s Congregation for the Causes of Saints, in the presence of Pope John Paul II, promulgated Charles of Austria&#x27;s &quot;heroic virtues&quot;. Charles thereby acquired the title &quot;venerable&quot;. On 21 December 2003, the Congregation certified, on the basis of three expert medical opinions, that a miracle in 1960 occurred through the intercession of Charles. The miracle attributed to Charles was the scientifically inexplicable healing of the Polish-born Brazilian Sister Maria Zita Gradowska of the Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul. Sister Maria Zita had suffered from pains in her legs since her youth, and later on would suffer from problems with her venous circulation and swellings, for which she was repeatedly treated over the years, but her health issues would not go away for good. In 1957 she became the Mother Superior of Santa Cruz Hospital in Canoinhas, but the pains in her right leg also gradually became worse. By the end of 1960 she was unable to leave her bed. Despite wanting to resign her position as Mother Superior because of this, she was unable to, as there was an insufficient number of sisters.

Around this time, another sister, who was an assistant of Sister Maria Zita, received printed leaflets about the life of Emperor Karl, which included prayers for his beatification. Naturally, Sister Maria Zita was also informed, however, as she did not care much for the Habsburg dynasty, she did not do anything with this information. She told the other sisters that her bedridden state and the coming absence of another sister worried her, and she was again advised to ask for the intercession of the Emperor, but she did not plan on doing so. That evening however, when lying in bed, she was unable to sleep because of the excruciating pain in her right leg. It is then that she decided to say a prayer of intercession and promised to start the next day with a novena to beg for the grace of beatification for the Servant of God. After praying, she did not feel the pain anymore and was able to easily fall asleep. From then on she was able to resume her duties as Mother Superior and would not suffer from any health problems with her legs for the rest of her life.

Pope John Paul II declared Charles &quot;Blessed&quot; in a beatification ceremony in St. Peter&#x27;s Square on 3 October 2004. The Pope also declared 21 October, the date of Charles&#x27;s marriage in 1911 to Princess Zita, to be Charles&#x27;s feast day. At the ceremony, the Pope stated:

The main points of Pope Benedict XV&#x27;s peace plan were: (1) the moral force of right ... be substituted for the material force of arms, (2) there must be simultaneous and reciprocal diminution of armaments, (3) a mechanism for international arbitration must be established, (4) true liberty and common rights over the sea should exist, (5) there should be a renunciation of war indemnities, (6) occupied territories should be evacuated, and (7) there should be an examination of rival claims. The best outcome to the war, according to Pope Benedict XV, was an immediate restoration of the status quo without reparations or any form of forced demands. Although the plan seemed unattainable due to the severity of the war thus far, it appealed to Charles, perhaps as a way to fulfill and preserve his role as Catholic Emperor of Austria and Apostolic King of Hungary. The beatification nevertheless raised controversy over the mistaken claim that Charles authorised the use of poison gas by the Austro-Hungarian Army during World War I. The Emperor actually forbade its use.

Pope John Paul II, who was born Karol Józef Wojtyła in Wadowice (then part of Austrian Poland), was named after Karl. During a private audience with Archduke Rudolf (Karl&#x27;s son), his sons and their families and Empress Zita (whom the Pope addressed as &quot;his Empress&quot; and bowed his head before) he told them the following:

From the beginning, Emperor Charles conceived of his office as a holy service to his people. His chief concern was to follow the Christian vocation to holiness also in his political actions. For this reason, his thoughts turned to social assistance.

On 31 January 2008, after a 16-month investigation, a Church tribunal recognized a second miracle attributed to Charles I. A &quot;devout Baptist&quot; from Orlando, Florida was allegedly cured after several recent converts to Roman Catholicism in Louisiana prayed for Charles&#x27;s intercession.

In 2011, the League of Prayers for the promotion of Charles&#x27;s cause set up a website, and Cardinal Christoph Schönborn of Vienna has sponsored the cause. One of Charles&#x27;s granddaughters, Princess Maria-Anna Galitzine, has been a prominent figure in the campaign for sainthood.

<text>The Silva Method is a self-help and meditation program developed by José Silva. It claims to increase an individual&#x27;s abilities through relaxation, development of higher brain functions, and psychic abilities such as clairvoyance.

It has been variously classified as a self-religion, a new religious movement, and a cult, and has been criticised as pseudoscience.

== Biography of José Silva==
José Silva, an American electronics repairman, grew up in Laredo, Texas. He developed an interest in psychology to see if it could help him increase his children&#x27;s IQ. After experimenting and being convinced of his daughter&#x27;s sudden clairvoyance, Silva decided to learn more about the development of psychic abilities.

In 1944 Silva began developing his method, formerly known as Silva Mind Control. He used it on his family members and friends before launching it commercially in the 1960s.

Silva was the subject of a 1990 biography.

== Technique ==
The technique aims to reach and sustain a state of mental functioning, called alpha state, where brainwave frequency is seven to fourteen Hz.:p19-20 Daydreaming and the transition to sleeping are alpha states.:p19-20

Silva claimed to have developed a program that trained people to enter certain brain states of enhanced awareness. He also claimed to have developed several systematic mental processes to use while in these states allowing a person to mentally project with a specific intent. According to Silva, once the mind is projected, a person can allegedly view distant objects or locations and connect with higher intelligence for guidance. The information received by the projected mind is then said to be perceived as thoughts, images, feelings, smells, taste, and sound by the mind. The information obtained in this manner can be acted upon to solve problems.

== Skepticism ==
James Randi wrote that the Silva Method:claims to develop improved memory, learning ability, and paranormal powers like telepathy. Much of the course consists of &quot;visiting&quot; absent persons imagined by students and performing diagnoses on them. No tests of the validity of this practice have been done; such tests are discouraged by the teachers of the system.

<text>Cimbrian (, ; ; ) is any of several local Upper German varieties spoken in parts of the Italian regions of Trentino and Veneto. The speakers of the language are known as in German.

Cimbrian is a Germanic language related to Bavarian most probably deriving from a Southern Bavarian dialect. It is also related to the Mòcheno language. Its many essential differences in grammar as well as in vocabulary and pronunciation make it practically unintelligible for people speaking Standard German. Even many people speaking Bavarian have problems. The use of Italian throughout the country and the influence of nearby Venetian have both had large effects on the number of speakers of Cimbrian throughout past centuries. This effect has been large enough to cause Cimbrian to be deemed an endangered language.

==History==
The earliest record of the movement of Bavarians to Verona dates to ca. 1050 (Bayerische Staatsbibliothek Cod. lat. 4547). The settlement continued during the 11th and 12th centuries.

A theory of Lombardic origin of the &quot;Zimbern&quot; was proposed in 1948 by Bruno Schweizer and again in 1974 by Alfonso Bellotto. The debate was again revived in 2004 by Cimbrian linguist Ermenegildo Bidese.
The majority of linguists remain committed to the hypothesis of medieval (11th to 12th century) immigration.
The presence of Germanic-speaking communities in Italy was discovered in the 14th century by the Italian humanists, who associated them with the Cimbri who arrived in the region in the 2nd century BC. This is the likely origin of the current endonym (&quot;Zimbar&quot;). Actually, though the ancient Cimbri are considered to have been a Germanic tribe, there is no reason to connect them linguistically or otherwise with the speakers of Cimbrian.

An alternative hypothesis derives the name from a term for &#x27;carpenter&#x27;, cognate with English &quot;timber&quot; (lit. &#x27;timberer&#x27;).

== Dialects and status ==
The three major dialects of Cimbrian are spoken in: 
* The Seven Communities (), currently only the village of Roana (Robàan)
* Luserna (Lusern), in Trentino
* The Thirteen Communities (), currently only the village of Giazza (Ljetzan)
* Some villages in the Carnic Alps such as Sappada, Sauris and Timau

Cimbrian is in danger of extinction both from standard Italian, which is often used in public, and the neighboring regional Venetian language. It is estimated that about 2,220 people speak Cimbrian.

In Trentino, according to the census of 2001, the first in which data on native languages were recorded, Cimbrian was spoken by a majority in the municipality of Lusérn (267 people, 89.9%). In other municipalities of Trentino 615 persons declared themselves members of the Cimbrian linguistic group, a total of 882 in Trentino. With this, it is seen that the most thriving variety of Cimbrian is that of Lusern with most of the community able to speak Cimbrian, whereas in Giazza and Roana only a few elderly speakers remain.

Cimbrian is officially recognised in Trentino by provincial and national law. Beginning in the 1990s, various laws and regulations have been passed by the Italian parliament and provincial assembly that put the Cimbrian language and culture under protection. School curricula were adapted in order to teach in Cimbrian, and bilingual street signs are being developed. A cultural institute (Istituto Cimbro/Kulturinstitut Lusérn) was founded by decree in 1987, whose purpose is to &quot;...safeguard, promote and exploit the ethnographic and cultural heritage of the German speaking minority of the municipality of Luserna while paying special attention to historic and linguistic expressions, to the protection of the environment, and to the economic-cultural development of the Cimbrian community territory.&quot; The cultural institute hosts literature competitions for children as well as immersion summer camps.

== Phonology ==
* A star represents sounds that are used by those who speak the Lusern dialect outside of Lusern in strictly Italian areas. 

== Grammar and orthography ==
&quot;The following description of Cimbrian grammar refers predominantly to the dialect of Lusern.&quot;

Notes on orthography:
* All dialects of Cimbrian use different orthographies though all are mainly based upon Italian and German orthographies with some additions from other languages and do not drastically differ.
* Diacritics and graphemes common in German and other languages are mostly utilized for sounds that do not exist in Italian.
* Diphthongs are written as in Italian whereby, for example, &#x27;three&#x27; is written in contrast to the German but is pronounced the same.
* [k] is rendered as in standard German as &quot;k&quot; while the grapheme &quot;ch&quot; is reserved for the sound [χ].
* [g] is rendered differently according to dialect:
** In the Thirteen and Seven communities, [g] is rendered as in Italian - &quot;g&quot; (which is pronounced before and ). If [g] is to be kept before an (orthographic) front vowel, the writing must change to &quot;gh.&quot;
** In Lusern, [g] is rendered mostly as &quot;g,&quot; perhaps due to more familiarity with German in Lusern. Though, seeing and is not uncommon.
=== Morphology, syntax, other ===
Nouns in Cimbrian, as in German and other German dialects, have three genders - masculine, feminine and neuter. Cimbrian makes use of the nominative, dative, and accusative cases. The genitive case was formerly used but has now been replaced by the dative + &quot;vo&quot; (&#x27;of&#x27;), a similar case which can also be seen in modern German. Cimbrian nouns inflect for gender, case, and number, usually keeping the same patterns for even Italian loanwords ending in -a, - o, and -e. Nouns also have forms for diminutives. Cimbrian articles (both definite and indefinite) have long and short forms depending on stress. Examples of Cimbrian noun inflection (with long articles and German counterparts) can be seen below. The letter å denotes open back unrounded vowel.

Cimbrian verbs are inflected for person, number, tense (present, past, future), mood (indicative, subjunctive, conditional, imperative, infinitive, gerund, and participial), and voice (active, passive). In regards to conjugation, Cimbrian shares many aspects with many other upper-German dialects. As in these other dialects, the use of the preterite has been replaced by the perfect which is formed with the prefix ( &#x27;to fall&#x27;; &#x27;fallen&#x27;). Infinitive verbs have two forms, a simple infinitive as well as a dependent infinitive which is formed with . An example of this can be seen with the verb &#x27;to fall&#x27;: - . In the Cimbrian of Lusern&#x27;s present indicative, first-person plural as well as third-person plural are both formed in the same manner as the simple infinitive, just as in standard German. Thus acts as the infinitive, first-person plural, and third-person plural. The first- and third-person plural also match each other in other tenses and moods.

The syntax of Cimbrian shows measurable influence from Italian; however, it still shows German traits which would be completely foreign to Italian speakers. An example of Italian influence is seen in the fact that Cimbrian does not move its verb to the second position as in German:
* My friend* believes that he can win. (En)
* . (Cimbrian)
* . (Italian)
* . ( can also mean &#x27;My boyfriend&#x27;) (German)
* My brother went on vacation in order to relax. (English)
* . (Cimbrian)
* . (Italian)
* . (German)

Cimbrian, in most sentences, uses subject–verb–object (SVO) word ordering, similar to Romance languages; however, in some cases it adopts some German syntax. 

== Vocabulary ==
The vocabulary of Cimbrian is closely related to that of Bavarian, containing words that set it apart from any other German varieties. Although today many Bavarian words in Bavarian communities are used less and less due to the influence of standard German, in Cimbrian many such words have remained. Besides its original Bavarian vocabulary, Cimbrian has been affected by Italian as well as neighboring languages.

<doc id="153499" wikidata="Q3117735" url="?curid=153499" title="Support group">
<text>In a support group, members provide each other with various types of help, usually nonprofessional and nonmaterial, for a particular shared, usually burdensome, characteristic. Members with the same issues can come together for sharing coping strategies, to feel more empowered and for a sense of community. The help may take the form of providing and evaluating relevant information, relating personal experiences, listening to and accepting others&#x27; experiences, providing sympathetic understanding and establishing social networks. A support group may also work to inform the public or engage in advocacy.

==History==
Formal support groups may appear to be a modern phenomenon, but they supplement traditional fraternal organizations such as Freemasonry in some respects, and may build on certain supportive functions (formerly) carried out in (extended) families.

Other types of groups formed to support causes, including causes outside of themselves, are more often called &quot;advocacy groups&quot;, &quot;interest groups&quot;, &quot;lobby groups&quot;, &quot;pressure groups&quot; or &quot;promotional groups&quot;. Trade unions and many environmental groups, for example, are interest groups. The term &quot;support group&quot; in this article refers to peer-to-peer support.

==Maintaining contact==
Support groups maintain interpersonal contact among their members in a variety of ways. Traditionally, groups meet in person in sizes that allow conversational interaction. Support groups also maintain contact through printed newsletters, telephone chains, internet forums, and mailing lists. Some support groups are exclusively online (see below).

Membership in some support groups is formally controlled, with admission requirements and membership fees. Other groups are &quot;open&quot; and allow anyone to attend an advertised meeting, for example, or to participate in an online forum.

==Management by peers or professionals==
A self-help support group is fully organized and managed by its members, who are commonly volunteers and have personal experience in the subject of the group&#x27;s focus. These groups may also be referred to as &quot;fellowships&quot;, &quot;peer support groups&quot;, &quot;lay organizations&quot;, &quot;mutual help groups&quot;, or &quot;mutual aid self-help groups&quot;. Most common are 12-step groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous and self-help groups for mental health.

Professionally operated support groups are facilitated by professionals who most often do not share the problem of the members, such as social workers, psychologists, or members of the clergy. The facilitator controls discussions and provides other managerial service. Such professionally operated groups are often found in institutional settings, including hospitals, drug-treatment centers and correctional facilities. These types of support groups may run for a specified period of time, and an attendance fee is sometimes charged.

==Types==
In the case of a disease, an identity or a pre-disposition, for example, a support group will provide information, act as a clearing-house for experiences, and may serve as a public relations voice for affected people, other members, and their families. Groups for high IQ or LGBTQIA+ individuals, for example, differ in their inclusivity, but both connect people on the basis of identity or pre-disposition.

For more temporary concerns, such as bereavement or episodic medical conditions, a support group may veer more towards helping those involved to overcome or push through their condition/experience.

Some support groups and conditions for which such groups may be formed are:
*Addiction
*AIDS
*Alzheimer&#x27;s
*Alcoholics Anonymous
*Anxiety disorders
*Asperger syndrome
*Borderline personality disorder
*Breastfeeding
*Brain attack or Brain trauma
*Cancer
*Circadian rhythm disorders, e.g. DSPD, Non-24 
*Codependency
*Diabetes
*Debtors Anonymous
*Domestic violence
*Eating disorders
*Erythema nodosum

*Families of addicts &amp; alcoholics
*Fibromyalgia
*Gamblers Anonymous
*Grief
*Infertility
*Inflammatory bowel disease
*Irritable bowel syndrome
*Mental Health
*Miscarriage
*Mood disorders
*Narcolepsy
*Parkinson&#x27;s disease
*Red Skin Syndrome/Topical Steroid Addiction and Withdrawal
*Sexual abuse survivors
*Sleep disorders
*Stuttering
*Suicide prevention
*Ulcerative colitis
==Online support groups==
Since at least 1982, the Internet has provided a venue for support groups. Discussing online self-help support groups as the precursor to e-therapy, Martha Ainsworth notes that &quot;the enduring success of these groups has firmly established the potential of computer-mediated communication to enable discussion of sensitive personal issues.&quot;

In one study of the effectiveness of online support groups among patients with head and neck cancer, longer participation in online support groups were found to result in a better health-related quality of life.

===Appropriate groups still difficult to find===
A researcher from University College London says the lack of qualitative directories, and the fact that many support groups are not listed by search engines can make finding an appropriate group difficult. Even so, he does say that the medical community needs &quot;to understand the use of personal experiences rather than an evidence-based approach... these groups also impact on how individuals &quot;use&quot; information. They can help people learn how to find and use information: for example, users swap Web sites and &quot;discuss&quot; Web sites.&quot;

It is not difficult to find an online support group, but it is hard to find a good one. In the article &quot;What to Look for in Quality Online Support Groups&quot;, John M. Grohol gives tips for evaluating online groups and states: &quot;In good online support groups, members stick around long after they&#x27;ve received the support they were seeking. They stay because they want to give others what they themselves found in the group. Psychologists call this &quot;high group cohesion&quot;, and it is the pinnacle of group achievement.&quot;

===Benefits and pitfalls===

Several studies have shown the importance of the Internet in providing social support, particularly to groups with chronic health problems. Especially in cases of uncommon ailments, a sense of community and understanding in spite of great geographical distances can be important, in addition to sharing of knowledge.

Online support groups, online communities for those affected by a common problem, give mutual support and provide information, two often inseparable features. They are, according to Henry Potts of University College London, &quot;an overlooked resource for patients.&quot; Many studies have looked at the &quot;content of messages&quot;, while what matters is the effect that &quot;participation&quot; in the group has on the individual. Potts complains that research on these groups has lagged behind, particularly on the groups which are set up by the people with the problems, rather than by researchers and healthcare professionals. User-defined groups can share the sort of practical knowledge that healthcare professionals can overlook, and they also impact on how individuals find, interpret and use information.

There are many benefits to online support groups that have been found through research studies. Although online support group users are not required to be anonymous, a study conducted by Baym (2010) finds that anonymity is beneficial to those who are lonely or anxious. This does not pertain to some people seeking support groups, because not all are lonely and/or anxious, but for those who are, online support groups are a great outlet where one can feel comfortable honestly expressing themselves because the other users do not know who they are.

A study was conducted by Walther and Boyd (2000) and they found a common trend to why people find online support groups appealing. First, the social distance between members online reduced embarrassment and they appreciated the greater range of expertise offered in the larger online social network. Next, they found that anonymity increased one&#x27;s confidence in providing support to others and decreased embarrassment. The users of the social support websites were more comfortable being able to reread and edit their comments and discussion forum entries before sending them, and they have access to the website any time during the day. Each of these characteristics of online support groups are not offered when going to an in-person support group.

In a study conducted by Gunther Eysenbach, John Powell, Marina Englesakis, Carlos Rizo, and Anita Stern (2004), the researchers found it difficult to draw conclusions on the effectiveness of online peer-to-peer support groups. In online support groups, people must have the desire to support and help each other, and many times participants go on the sites in order to get help themselves or are limited to a certain subgroup.

An additional benefit to online support groups is that participation is asynchronous. This means that it is not necessary for all participants to be logged into the forum simultaneously in order to communicate. An experience or question can be posted and others can answer questions or comment on posts whenever they are logged in and have an appropriate response. This characteristic allows for participation and mass communication without having to worry about time constraints. Additionally, there are 24-hour chat rooms and spaces for focused conversation at all times of the day or night. This allows users to get the support they need whenever they need it, while remaining comfortable and, if they so wish, anonymous.

===Mental health===
Although there has been relatively little research on the effectiveness of online support groups in mental health, there is some evidence that online support groups can be beneficial. Large randomised controlled trials have both found positive effects and failed to find positive effects.

<doc id="153500" wikidata="Q29540" url="?curid=153500" title="Bavarian language">
<text>Bavarian (; ), alternately Austro-Bavarian, is a group of Upper German varieties spoken in the south-east of the German language area, including the German state of Bavaria, most of Austria, and South Tyrol in Italy. Prior to 1945, Bavarian was also prevalent in parts of the southern Sudetenland and western Hungary. Bavarian is spoken by approximately 12 million people in an area of around , making it the largest of all German dialects. In 2008, 45 percent of Bavarians claimed to use only dialect in everyday communication.

== Language or dialect ==
Bavarian is commonly considered to be a dialect of German, but some sources classify it as a separate language: the International Organization for Standardization has assigned a unique ISO 639-3 language code (&quot;bar&quot;), and the UNESCO lists Bavarian in the &quot;Atlas of the World&#x27;s Languages in Danger&quot; since 2009; however, the classification of Bavarian as an &quot;individual language&quot; has been criticized by some scholars of Bavarian.

Reasons why Bavarian can be viewed as a dialect of German include the perception of its speakers, the lack of standardization, the traditional use of Standard German as a roofing language, the relative closeness to German which does not justify Bavarian to be viewed as an abstand language, or the fact that no country applied for Bavarian to be entered into the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages.

The difference between Bavarian and Standard German is larger than the difference between Danish and some varieties of Norwegian or between Czech and Slovak.

== Origins ==
=== History and etymology ===
The word &quot;Bavarian&quot; is derived from the name of the people who settled Bavaria along with their tribal dialect. The origin of the word is disputed. The most common theory traces the word to &quot;Bajowarjōz&quot;, meaning &#x27;inhabitants of Bojer land&#x27;. In turn, &quot;Bojer&quot; (, ) originated as the name for former Celtic inhabitants of the area, with the name passing to the mixed population of Celts, Romans, and successive waves of German arrivals during the early medieval period.

The local population eventually established the Duchy of Bavaria, forming the south-eastern part of the kingdom of Germany. The Old High German documents from the area of Bavaria are identified as (Old Bavarian), even though at this early date there were few distinctive features that would divide it from Alemannic German.

The dialectal separation of Upper German into East Upper German (Bavarian) and West Upper German (Alemannic) became more tangible in the Middle High German period, from about the 12th century.

==Geographical distribution and dialects==
* In Europe:
** In Germany, the language is spoken in Upper Bavaria, Lower Bavaria, and the Upper Palatinate districts in Bavaria. It is also spoken in southern Vogtland, in Saxony;
** In Austria, except Vorarlberg and Reutte;
** In Italy in South Tyrol and a handful of linguistic enclaves of Cimbrian and Carnic people in Northern Italy;
** In Switzerland, it is spoken in the village of Samnaun, in Grisons;
** In Sopron (Hungary) and surroundings.
* Outside of Europe:
** In Treze Tílias, Brazil
** In Pozuzo, Peru
** In the United States and Canada (Hutterite German)

Three main dialects of Bavarian are:
* Northern Bavarian, mainly spoken in Upper Palatinate, but also in adjacent areas (small parts of Upper Franconia (Wunsiedel district and Bayreuth district), Saxony (southern Vogtland), Middle Franconia, Upper Bavaria and Lower Bavaria).
* Central Bavarian along the main rivers Isar and Danube, spoken in Upper Bavaria (including Munich, which has a standard German-speaking majority), Lower Bavaria, southern Upper Palatinate, the Swabian district of Aichach-Friedberg, the northern parts of the State of Salzburg, Upper Austria, Lower Austria, Vienna (&quot;see Viennese German&quot;) and the Northern Burgenland.
* Southern Bavarian in Samnaun, Tyrol, South Tyrol, Carinthia, Styria, and the southern parts of Salzburg and Burgenland.

Differences are clearly noticeable within those three subgroups, which in Austria often coincide with the borders of the particular states. For example, each of the accents of Carinthia, Styria, and Tyrol can be easily recognised. Also, there is a marked difference between eastern and western central Bavarian, roughly coinciding with the border between Austria and Bavaria. In addition, the Viennese dialect has some characteristics distinguishing it from all other dialects. In Vienna, minor, but recognizable, variations are characteristic for distinct districts of the city.

Before the expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia, the linguistic border of Bavarian with Czech was on the farther side of the Bohemian Forest and its Bohemian foreland was Bavarian-speaking.

Alternatively, there are four main dialects:
* North Bavarian
* Middle Bavarian
* South Middle Bavarian
* South Bavarian

==Use==
Bavarian differs sufficiently from Standard German to make it difficult for native speakers to adopt standard pronunciation. Educated Bavarians and Austrians can almost always read, write and understand Standard German, but they may have very little opportunity to speak it, especially in rural areas. In those regions, Standard German is restricted to use as the language of writing and the media. It is therefore often referred to as (&quot;written German&quot;) rather than the usual term (&quot;High German&quot; or &quot;Standard German&quot;). Given that Central German and Upper German together comprise the High German languages, out of which the then new, written standard was developed and as opposed to Low German, that is an alternative naming many High German dialect speakers regard justified.

===School===
Bavaria and Austria officially use Standard German as the primary medium of education. With the spread of universal education, the exposure of speakers of Bavarian to Standard German has been increasing, and many younger people, especially in the region&#x27;s cities and larger towns, speak Standard German with only a slight accent. This accent usually only exists in families where Bavarian is spoken regularly. Families that do not use Bavarian at home usually use Standard German instead. In Austria, some parts of grammar and spelling are taught in Standard German lessons.
As reading and writing in Bavarian is generally not taught at schools, almost all literate speakers of the language prefer to use Standard German for writing. Regional authors and literature may play a role in education as well, but by and large, Standard German is the &quot;lingua franca&quot;.

===Literature===
Although there exist grammars, vocabularies, and a translation of the Bible in Bavarian, there is no common orthographic standard. Poetry is written in various Bavarian dialects, and many pop songs use the language as well, especially ones belonging to the Austropop wave of the 1970s and 1980s.

Although Bavarian as a spoken language is in daily use in its region, Standard German, often with strong regional influence, is preferred in the mass media.

Ludwig Thoma was a noted German author who wrote works such as in Bavarian.

===Web===
There is a Bavarian Wikipedia. Also, the official FC Bayern Munich website was available in Bavarian.

==Phonology==

===Consonants===

Notes:

*Aspiration may occur among voiceless plosives in word-initial position.
*The phoneme is frequently realised as or word-internally and is realised as word-initially.
*Intervocalic can be voiced to , unless it is &quot;fortis&quot; (lengthened), such as in &#x27;to be named&#x27;, compared to &#x27;to travel&#x27;, where the sibilant is &quot;lenis&quot;.
*A trill sound may also be realised as a flap [].
*Intervocalic can be realised as [] or [, ].
*Some dialects, such as the Bavarian dialect in South Tyrol, realise as an affricate word-initially and before , which is an extension of the High German consonant shift to velar consonants.

===Vowels===
Vowel phonemes in parentheses occur only in certain Bavarian dialects or only appear as allophones or in diphthongs. Nasalization may also be distinguished in some dialects.
Bavarian has an extensive vowel inventory, like most Germanic languages. Vowels can be grouped as back rounded, front unrounded and front rounded. They are also traditionally distinguished by length or tenseness.

==Orthography==
== Grammar ==

* Bavarian usually has case inflection only for the article. With very few exceptions, nouns are not inflected for case.
* The simple past tense is very rare in Bavarian and has been retained for only a few verbs, including &#x27;to be&#x27; and &#x27;to want&#x27;. In general, the perfect is used to express past time.
* Bavarian features verbal inflection for several moods such as indicative, subjunctive, imperative and optative. See the table below for inflection of the Bavarian verb , &#x27;make; do&#x27;:
===Pronouns===
====Personal pronouns====


====Possessive pronouns====

The possessive pronouns &quot;Deina&quot; and &quot;Seina&quot; inflect in the same manner. Oftentimes, &quot;-nige&quot; is added to the nominative to form the adjective form of the possessive pronoun, like mei(nige), dei(nige), and the like.

====Indefinite pronouns====

Just like the possessive pronouns listed above, the indefinite pronouns &quot;koana&quot;, &quot;none&quot;, and &quot;oana&quot;, &quot;one&quot; are inflected the same way.

There is also the indefinite pronoun &quot;ebba(d)&quot;, &quot;someone&quot; with its impersonal form &quot;ebb(a)s&quot;, &quot;something&quot;. It is inflected in the following way:
====Interrogative pronouns====
The interrogative pronouns &quot;wea&quot;, &quot;who&quot;, and &quot;wås&quot;, &quot;what&quot; are inflected the same way the indefinite pronoun &quot;ebba&quot; is inflected.

== Society ==

Bavarians produce a variety of nicknames for those who bear traditional Bavarian or German names like Josef, Theresa or Georg (becoming &quot;Sepp&#x27;l&quot; or more commonly &quot;Sepp&quot;, &quot;Resi&quot; and &quot;Schorsch&quot;, respectively). Bavarians often refer to names with the family name coming first (like &quot;da Stoiber Ede&quot; instead of Edmund Stoiber). The use of the article is considered mandatory when using this linguistic variation. In addition, nicknames different from the family name exist for almost all families, especially in small villages. They consist largely of their profession, names or professions of deceased inhabitants of their homes or the site where their homes are located. This nickname is called &quot;Hausname&quot; (en: name of the house) and is seldom used to name the person, but more to state where they come from or live or to whom they are related. Examples of this are:
* Mohler (e.g. &quot;Maler&quot; – painter)
* Bachbauer (farmer who lives near a brook/creek)
* Moosrees (Theresa (Rees/Resi) who lives near a moss)
* Schreiner (joiner/carpenter)

== Samples of Bavarian dialects ==


The dialects can be seen to share a number of features with Yiddish.

<text>Mensa International is the largest and oldest high-IQ society in the world. It is a non-profit organization open to people who score at the 98th percentile or higher on a standardised, supervised IQ or other approved intelligence test. Mensa formally comprises national groups and the umbrella organisation Mensa International, with a registered office in Caythorpe, Lincolnshire, England, which is separate from the British Mensa office in Wolverhampton.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;mensa&quot; (, ) is Latin for &#x27;table&#x27;, as is symbolised in the organisation&#x27;s logo, and was chosen to demonstrate the round-table nature of the organisation: the coming together of equals.

==History==
Australian Roland Berrill and Lancelot Ware, a British scientist and lawyer, founded Mensa at Lincoln College, in Oxford, England in 1946, with the intention of forming a society for the most intelligent, with the only qualification being a high IQ.

The society was ostensibly to be non-political in its aims and free from all other social distinctions, such as race and religion. However, Berrill and Ware were both disappointed with the resulting society. Berrill had intended Mensa as &quot;an aristocracy of the intellect&quot; and was unhappy that the majority of members came from working or lower-class homes, while Ware said: &quot;I do get disappointed that so many members spend so much time solving puzzles.&quot;

American Mensa was the second major branch of Mensa thanks to the efforts of Margot Seitelman.

==Membership requirement==
Mensa&#x27;s requirement for membership is a score at or above the 98th percentile on certain standardized IQ or other approved intelligence tests, such as the Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scales. The minimum accepted score on the Stanford–Binet is 132, while for the Cattell it is 148, and 130 in the Wechsler tests (WAIS, WISC). Most IQ tests are designed to yield a mean score of 100 with a standard deviation of 15; the 98th-percentile score under these conditions is 130.8, assuming a normal distribution.

However, American Mensa does not provide a score comparable to scores on other tests; the test serves only to qualify a person for membership. In some national groups, a person may take a Mensa-offered test only once, although one may later submit an application with results from a different qualifying test. The Mensa test is also available in some developing countries such as Brazil, India, Indonesia and Pakistan.

==Organizational structure==

Mensa International consists of around 150,000 members in 100 countries and in 54 national groups. The national groups issue periodicals, such as &quot;Mensa Bulletin&quot;, the monthly publication of American Mensa, and &quot;Mensa Magazine&quot;, the monthly publication of British Mensa. Individuals who live in a country with a national group join the national group, while those living in countries without a recognized chapter may join Mensa International directly.

The largest national groups are: 
* American Mensa, with more than 50,000 members
* British Mensa, with about 18,000 members in the UK and Ireland
* Mensa Germany, with about 17,000 members
Larger national groups are further subdivided into local groups. For example, American Mensa has 134 local groups, with the largest having over 2,000 members and the smallest having fewer than 100.

Members may form special interest groups (SIGs) at international, national, and local levels; these SIGs represent a wide variety of interests, ranging from motorcycle clubs to entrepreneurial co-operations. Some SIGs are associated with various geographic groups, whereas others act independently of official hierarchy. There are also electronic SIGs (eSIGs), which operate primarily as email lists, where members may or may not meet each other in person.

The Mensa Foundation, a separate charitable U.S. corporation, edits and publishes its own &quot;Mensa Research Journal&quot;, in which both Mensans and non-Mensans are published on various topics surrounding the concept and measure of intelligence.

==Gatherings==

Mensa has many events for members, from the local to the international level. Several countries hold a large event called the Annual Gathering (AG). It is held in a different city every year, with speakers, dances, leadership workshops, children&#x27;s events, games, and other activities. The American AG is usually held during the American Independence Day (4 July).

Since 1990, American Mensa has sponsored the annual Mensa Mind Games competition, at which the Mensa Select award is given to five board games that are &quot;original, challenging, and well designed&quot;.

In Europe, since 2008 international meetings have been held under the name EMAG (European Mensa Annual Gathering), starting in Cologne that year. The next meetings were in Utrecht (2009), Prague (2010), Paris (2011), Stockholm (2012), Bratislava (2013), Zürich (2014), Berlin (2015), Kraków (2016), Barcelona (2017), Belgrade (2018) and Ghent (2019). The 2020 event was postponed and took place in 2021 in Brno. The next meetings were in Strasbourg (2022), Rotterdam (2023) an Bucharest (2024). The EMAG will be in Cardiff in 2025.

In the Asia-Pacific region, there is an Asia-Pacific Mensa Annual Gathering (AMAG), with rotating countries hosting the event. This has included Gold Coast, Australia (2017), Cebu, Philippines (2018), New Zealand (2019), and South Korea (2020).

===Officers===
The governing body of Mensa International consists of:
* International Chair: Therese Moodie-Bloom
* International Director - Administration: Robin Crawford
* International Director - Development: Eivind Olsen
* International Treasurer: Jovana Kostic
* International Director - Smaller National Mensas: Sorana Burcusel
* American Mensa: Lori Norris
* British Isles Mensa: Ann Rootkin
* Mensa Germany: Peter Fröhler

==Publications==
All national Mensa groups publish members-only newsletters or magazines, which include articles and columns written by members, and information about upcoming Mensa events. Examples include the American &quot;Mensa Bulletin&quot;, the British &quot;Mensa&quot; &quot;Magazine&quot;, Serbian &quot;MozaIQ&quot;, the Australian &quot;TableAus&quot;, the Mexican &quot;El Mensajero&quot;, and the French, formerly &quot;Contacts&quot;, now &quot;MensaMag&quot;. Aside from national publications, some local or regional groups have their own newsletters and websites.

Mensa International publishes a &quot;Mensa World Journal&quot;, which &quot;contains views and information about Mensa around the world&quot;. This journal is generally included in each national magazine.

The Mensa Foundation publishes the &quot;Mensa Research Journal&quot;, which &quot;highlights scholarly articles and recent research related to intelligence&quot;. Unlike most Mensa publications, this journal is available to non-members.

==Demographics==
All national Mensa subsidiaries accept children under the age of 18. However, some national Mensas do not test the children themselves; many offer activities, resources, and newsletters specifically geared toward gifted children and their parents. Kashe Quest, the youngest member of American Mensa; Adam Kirby, the youngest member of British Mensa; and several Australian Mensa members joined at age two. Elise Tan-Roberts of the UK and Miranda Elise Margolis of the US are the youngest people ever to join Mensa, having gained full membership at the age of two years and four months.

In 2018, Mehul Garg became the youngest person in a decade to score the maximum of 162 on the Mensa IQ test.

American Mensa&#x27;s oldest member is 102, and British Mensa had a member aged 103.

According to American Mensa&#x27;s generational classifications and published demographics (as of 2023), its membership is 8 per cent from the Silent generation (born 1924–1942), 37 per cent Baby Boomers (born 1943–1960), 30 per cent Gen-X (born 1961–1981), 10 per cent Millennial (born 1982–2000), 12 per cent Generation Z (born 2001–2020) and the remaining 3 per cent other. The American Mensa general membership identifies as 64 per cent male, 32 per cent female, 3 percent unknown, and less than 1 per cent gender non-conforming or other.

<text>Fish farming or pisciculture involves commercial breeding of fish, most often for food, in fish tanks or artificial enclosures such as fish ponds. It is a particular type of aquaculture, which is the controlled cultivation and harvesting of aquatic animals such as fish, crustaceans, molluscs and so on, in natural or pseudo-natural environments. A facility that releases juvenile fish into the wild for recreational fishing or to supplement a species&#x27; natural numbers is generally referred to as a fish hatchery. Worldwide, the most important fish species produced in fish farming are carp, catfish, salmon and tilapia.

Global demand is increasing for dietary fish protein, which has resulted in widespread overfishing in wild fisheries, resulting in significant decrease in fish stocks and even complete depletion in some regions. Fish farming allows establishment of artificial fish colonies that are provided with sufficient feeding, protection from natural predators and competitive threats, access to veterinarian service, and easier harvesting when needed, while being separate from and thus do not usually impact the sustainable yields of wild fish populations. While fish farming is practised worldwide, China alone provides 62% of the world&#x27;s farmed fish production. As of 2016, more than 50% of seafood was produced by aquaculture. In the last three decades, aquaculture has been the main driver of the increase in fisheries and aquaculture production, with an average growth of 5.3 percent per year in the period 2000–2018, reaching a record 82.1 million tonnes in 2018.

Farming carnivorous fish such as salmon, however, does not always reduce pressure on wild fisheries, such farmed fish are usually fed fishmeal and fish oil extracted from wild forage fish. The 2008 global returns for fish farming recorded by the FAO totaled 33.8 million tonnes worth about US$60 billion.

Although fish farming for food is the most widespread, another major fish farming industry provides living fish for the aquarium trade. The vast majority of freshwater fish in the aquarium trade originate from farms in Eastern and Southern Asia, eastern Europe, Florida and South America that use either indoor tank systems or outdoor pond systems, while farming of fish for the marine aquarium trade happens at a much smaller scale. In 2022 24% of fishers and fish farmers and 62% of workers in post-harvest sector were women.


== Major species ==

== Categories ==
Aquaculture makes use of local photosynthetic production (extensive) or fish that are fed with external food supply (intensive).

=== Extensive aquaculture ===

Extensive aquaculture is the other form of fish farming. Extensive aquaculture is more basic than intensive aquaculture in that less effort is put into the husbandry of the fish. Extensive aquaculture is done in the ocean, natural and man-made lakes, bays, rivers, and Fiords. Fish are contained within these habitats by multiple mesh enclosures which also function as trapping nets during harvest (Figure 3) (4). Since fish are susceptible to the elements, site placement is essential to ensure the rapid growth of the targeted species. The drawback of these facilities is that they depend on the surrounding area for good water quality in order to reduce mortality and increase the survivorship and growth rate of the fish (19). Fish chosen for extensive aquaculture are very hardy and often do well in high densities. Seaweed, prawns, mussels, carp, tilapia, tuna and salmon are the most prominent forms of extensive aqua cultured seafood.
Extensive aquaculture facilities have negative impacts on the environment as well. Natural habitats are destroyed in the development of man made ponds used for extensive aquaculture. In the Philippines, shrimp aquaculture is responsible for the destruction of thousands of acres of mangrove fields which serve as nurseries and living habitats for many marine organisms. Benthic habitats are being depleted due to the high amount of organic waste produced by the fish which settles below their pens(4). Phytoplankton and algae break down fecal matter and residual fish meal reducing the amount of available oxygen in the water column, which chokes and kills the Benthic organisms. Another serious problem acquainted with extensive aquaculture is the introduction of invasive species into ecosystems (10). Escaped fish increase the competition between organisms for limited resources. Also, when foreign fish interbreed with wild species, they upset the genetic variability of the species, making them more prone to disease and infection. The high density of fish in these mesh tanks is very tempting for predators of the sea and air (19). To protect the harvest from predators protective netting is set up at a high cost. Often times predatorial fish and mammals like seals, sharks, and tuna get caught in these barrier nets and die. Some farmers protect their stocks from predatorial birds such as pelicans and albatross by shooting these sometimes endangered creatures.

=== Intensive aquaculture ===

In these kinds of systems fish production per unit of surface can be increased at will, as long as sufficient oxygen, fresh water and food are provided. Because of the requirement of sufficient fresh water, a massive water purification system must be integrated in the fish farm. One way to achieve this is to combine hydroponic horticulture and water treatment, see below. The exception to this rule are cages which are placed in a river or sea, which supplements the fish crop with sufficient oxygenated water. Some environmentalists object to this practice.
The cost of inputs per unit of fish weight is higher than in extensive farming, especially because of the high cost of fish feed. It must contain a much higher level of protein (up to 60%) than cattle feed and a balanced amino acid composition, as well. These higher protein-level requirements are a consequence of the higher feed efficiency of aquatic animals (higher feed conversion ratio [FCR], that is, kg of feed per kg of animal produced). Fish such as salmon have an FCR around 1.1 kg of feed per kg of salmon whereas chickens are in the 2.5 kg of feed per kg of chicken range. Fish do not use energy to keep warm, eliminating some carbohydrates and fats in the diet, required to provide this energy. This may be offset, though, by the lower land costs and the higher production which can be obtained due to the high level of input control.

Aeration of the water is essential, as fish need a sufficient oxygen level for growth. This is achieved by bubbling, cascade flow, or aqueous oxygen. Catfish in genus &quot;Clarias&quot; can breathe atmospheric air and can tolerate much higher levels of pollutants than trout or salmon, which makes aeration and water purification less necessary and makes &quot;Clarias&quot; species especially suited for intensive fish production. In some &quot;Clarias&quot; farms, about 10% of the water volume can consist of fish biomass.

The risk of infections by parasites such as fish lice, fungi (&quot;Saprolegnia&quot; spp.), intestinal worms (such as nematodes or trematodes), bacteria (e.g., &quot;Yersinia&quot; spp., &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; spp.), and protozoa (such as dinoflagellates) is similar to that in animal husbandry, especially at high population densities. However, animal husbandry is a larger and more technologically mature area of human agriculture and has developed better solutions to pathogen problems. Intensive aquaculture has to provide adequate water quality (oxygen, ammonia, nitrite, etc.) levels to minimize stress on the fish. This requirement makes control of the pathogen problem more difficult. Intensive aquaculture requires tight monitoring and a high level of expertise of the fish farmer.

Very-high-intensity recycle aquaculture systems (RAS, also Recirculating Aquaculture Systems), where all the production parameters are controlled, are being used for high-value species. By recycling water, little is used per unit of production. However, the process has high capital and operating costs. The higher cost structures mean that RAS is economical only for high-value products, such as broodstock for egg production, fingerlings for net pen aquaculture operations, sturgeon production, research animals, and some special niche markets such as live fish.

Raising ornamental coldwater fish (goldfish or koi), although theoretically much more profitable due to the higher income per weight of fish produced, has been successfully carried out only in the 21st century. The increased incidences of dangerous viral diseases of koi carp, together with the high value of the fish, has led to initiatives in closed-system koi breeding and growing in a number of countries. Today, a few commercially successful intensive koi-growing facilities are operating in the UK, Germany, and Israel.

Some producers have adapted their intensive systems in an effort to provide consumers with fish that do not carry dormant forms of viruses and diseases.

In 2016, juvenile Nile tilapia were given a food containing dried &quot;Schizochytrium&quot; in place of fish oil. When compared to a control group raised on regular food, they exhibited higher weight gain and better food-to-growth conversion, plus their flesh was higher in healthy omega-3 fatty acids.

== Fish farms ==
Within intensive and extensive aquaculture methods, numerous specific types of fish farms are used; each has benefits and applications unique to its design.

=== Cage system ===
Fish cages are placed in lakes, bayous, ponds, rivers, or oceans to contain and protect fish until they can be harvested. The method is also called &quot;off-shore cultivation&quot; when the cages are placed in the sea. They can be constructed of a wide variety of components. Fish are stocked in cages, artificially fed, and harvested when they reach market size. A few advantages of fish farming with cages are that many types of waters can be used (rivers, lakes, filled quarries, etc.), many types of fish can be raised, and fish farming can co-exist with sport fishing and other water uses.

Cage farming of fishes in open seas is also gaining in popularity. Given concerns of disease, poaching, poor water quality, etc., generally pond systems are considered simpler to start and easier to manage. Also, the past occurrences of cage-failures leading to escapes, have raised concern regarding the culture of non-native fish species in dam or open-water cages. On August 22, 2017, there was a massive failure of such cages at a commercial fishery in Washington state in Puget Sound, leading to release of nearly 300,000 Atlantic salmon in non-native waters. This is believed to risk endangering the native Pacific salmon species.

Marine Scotland has kept records of caged fish escapes since 1999. They have recorded 357 fish escape incidents with 3,795,206 fish escaping into fresh and salt water. One company, Dawnfresh Farming Limited has been responsible for 40 incident and 152,790 Rainbow Trout escaping into freshwater lochs.

Though the cage-industry has made numerous technological advances in cage construction in recent years, the risk of damage and escape due to storms is always a concern.

Semi-submersible marine technology is beginning to impact fish farming. In 2018, 1.5 million salmon are in the middle of a year-long trial at Ocean Farm 1 off the coast of Norway. The semi-submersible project is the world&#x27;s first deep-sea aquaculture project, and includes -high by -diameter pen made from a series of mesh-wire frames and nets. It is designed to disperse wastes better than more conventional farms in sheltered coastal waters, therefore supporting higher fish packing density.

====Copper-alloy nets====
Recently, copper alloys have become important netting materials in aquaculture. Copper alloys are antimicrobial, that is, they destroy bacteria, viruses, fungi, algae, and other microbes. In the marine environment, the antimicrobial/algaecidal properties of copper alloys prevent biofouling, which can briefly be described as the undesirable accumulation, adhesion, and growth of microorganisms, plants, algae, tube worms, barnacles, mollusks, and other organisms.

The resistance of organism growth on copper alloy nets also provides a cleaner and healthier environment for farmed fish to grow and thrive. Traditional netting involves regular and labor-intensive cleaning. In addition to its antifouling benefits, copper netting has strong structural and corrosion-resistant properties in marine environments.

Copper-zinc brass alloys are deployed in commercial-scale aquaculture operations in Asia, South America, and USA (Hawaii). Extensive research, including demonstrations and trials, are being implemented on two other copper alloys: copper-nickel and copper-silicon. Each of these alloy types has an inherent ability to reduce biofouling, cage waste, disease, and the need for antibiotics, while simultaneously maintaining water circulation and oxygen requirements. Other types of copper alloys are also being considered for research and development in aquaculture operations.

In Southeast Asia, the traditional cage farming platform is called kelong.

=== Open net pen system ===
The open net pens system is a method that takes place in natural waters, such as rivers, lakes, near the coast or offshore. The breeders rear the fish in large cages floating in the water. The fish are living in natural water but are isolated with a net. Because the only barrier separating the fish from the surrounding environment is a net, this allows the water to flow from the ‘natural’ surrounding through the fish farms.

The site of the fish farm is crucial for the farm to be a success or not. Before any fish farm is settled, it is highly recommended to be selective with the site location of the farm. The site must be examined on some essential elements. Important conditions on the location are:

# A good interchange of water and also a high replacement of bottom water.
# At all depths should be a good current condition. This is necessary because the organic particles should be able to be carried away using the current.
# A gravel and sand bottom are qualified for fish farming, although bottoms with silt and mud are not qualified. These should be avoided.
# A net should be at least or more above the bottom, so depth is important.

Despite these important site conditions, the open net pen method was very popular in Norway and China. This is because of the cost friendliness and efficiency of this method.

==== Negative external effects ====
Because of the ocean&#x27;s water flow and other reasons, open net pen culture is seen as a high-risk method for the environment. The flow allows chemicals, parasites, waste and diseases to spread in the enclosed environment, and this is not beneficial for the natural environment. Another negative consequence is the high escape rate of the cultured fish from these open net pens. These escaped fish also pose a high risk to the surrounding ecosystems.

The amount of organic waste produced by fish farms is also alarming. A salmon farm in Scotland, for instance, is estimated to produce as much organic waste as equivalent to a town of people between 10,000 and 20,000 people each year.

Today 50% of the world&#x27;s seafood is farm-raised.

=== Irrigation ditch or pond systems ===
These use irrigation ditches or farm ponds to raise fish. The basic requirement is to have a ditch or pond that retains water, possibly with an above-ground irrigation system (many irrigation systems use buried pipes with headers).

Using this method, water allotments can be stored in ponds or ditches, usually lined with bentonite clay. In small systems, the fish are often fed commercial fish food, and their waste products can help fertilize the fields. In larger ponds, the pond grows water plants and algae as fish food. Some of the most successful ponds grow introduced strains of plants, as well as introduced strains of fish.

Control of water quality is crucial. Fertilizing, clarifying, and pH control of the water can increase yields substantially, as long as eutrophication is prevented and oxygen levels stay high. Yields can be low if the fish grow ill from electrolyte stress.

==== Composite fish culture ====
The composite fish culture system is a technology developed in India by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research in the 1970s. In this system, of both local and imported fish, a combination of five or six fish species is used in a single fish pond. These species are selected so that they do not compete for food among them by having different types of food habitats. As a result, the food available in all the parts of the pond is used. Fish used in this system include catla and silver carp (surface feeders), rohu (a column feeder), and mrigal and common carp (bottom feeders). Other fish also feed on the excreta of the common carp, and this helps contribute to the efficiency of the system which in optimal conditions produces 3000–6000 kg of fish per hectare per year.

One problem with such composite fish culture is that many of these fish breed only during monsoon. Even if fish are collected from the wild, they can be mixed with other species, as well. Thus, a major problem in fish farming is the lack of availability of good-quality stock. To overcome this problem, ways have now been worked out to breed these fish in ponds using hormonal stimulation. This has ensured the supply of pure fish stock in desired quantities.

=== Integrated recycling systems ===
One of the largest problems with freshwater pisciculture is that it can use a million gallons of water per acre (about 1 m3 of water per m2) each year. Extended water purification systems allow for the reuse (recycling) of local water.

The largest-scale pure fish farms use a system derived (admittedly much refined) from the New Alchemy Institute in the 1970s. Basically, large plastic fish tanks are placed in a greenhouse. A hydroponic bed is placed near, above or between them. When tilapia are raised in the tanks, they are able to eat algae, which naturally grow in the tanks when the tanks are properly fertilized.

The tank water is slowly circulated to the hydroponic beds, where the tilapia waste feeds commercial plant crops. Carefully cultured microorganisms in the hydroponic bed convert ammonia to nitrates, and the plants are fertilized by the nitrates and phosphates.Other wastes are strained out by the hydroponic media, which double as an aerated pebble-bed filter.

This system, properly tuned, produces more edible protein per unit area than any other. A wide variety of plants can grow well in the hydroponic beds. Most growers concentrate on herbs (e.g. parsley and basil), which command premium prices in small quantities all year long. The most common customers are restaurant wholesalers.

Since the system lives in a greenhouse, it adapts to almost all temperate climates, and may also adapt to tropical climates.
The main environmental impact is discharge of water that must be salted to maintain the fishes&#x27; electrolyte balance. Current growers use a variety of proprietary tricks to keep fish healthy, reducing their expenses for salt and wastewater discharge permits. Some veterinary authorities speculate that ultraviolet ozone disinfectant systems (widely used for ornamental fish) may play a prominent part in keeping the tilapia healthy with recirculated water.

A number of large, well-capitalized ventures in this area have failed. Managing both the biology and markets is complicated. One future development is the combination of integrated recycling systems with urban farming as tried in Sweden by the Greenfish Initiative.

=== Classic fry farming ===
This is also called a &quot;flow through system&quot; . Trout and other sport fish are often raised from eggs to fry or fingerlings and then trucked to streams and released. Normally, the fry are raised in long, shallow, concrete tanks, fed with fresh stream water. The fry receive commercial fish food in pellets. While not as efficient as the New Alchemists&#x27; method, it is also far simpler and has been used for many years to stock streams with sport fish. European eel (&quot;Anguilla anguilla&quot;) aquaculturalists procure a limited supply of glass eels, juvenile stages of the European eel which swim north from the Sargasso Sea breeding grounds, for their farms. The European eel is threatened with extinction because of the excessive catch of glass eels by Spanish fishermen and overfishing of adult eels in, e.g., the Dutch IJsselmeer. Although European eel larvae can survive for several weeks, the full life cycle has not yet been achieved in captivity.

== Issues ==


=== Welfare ===
There is a growing consensus that fish can feel pain. Despite the vast number of fish consumed, fish welfare has historically received little attention.

Farmed fish are usually raised in overcrowded environments, making them susceptible to stress, injuries, aggression and diseases. These conditions prevent them from engaging in natural behaviors such as nesting or migration. Overcrowding often leads to poor water quality due to fish waste and antibiotics use. Sea lice infestations are common and can cause painful lesion, but are typically treated with harsh chemicals. Additionally, fish are genetically engineered to grow larger and faster, leading to health problems such as cataracts and abnormal heart shapes.

=== Feeding ===

The issue of feeds in fish farming has been a controversial one. Many cultured fishes (tilapia, carp, catfish, many others) can be raised on a strictly herbivorous diet. Top-level carnivores (most salmonidae species in particular) on the other hand, depend on fish feed, of which a large portion is usually derived from wild-caught fish (anchovies, menhaden, etc.). Vegetable-derived proteins have successfully replaced fish meal in feeds for carnivorous fishes, but vegetable-derived oils have not successfully been incorporated into the diets of carnivores. Research is underway to try to change this, such that even salmon and other carnivores could be successfully fed with vegetable products. The F3 Challenge (Fish-Free Feed Challenge), as explained by a report from &quot;Wired&quot; in February 2017, &quot;is a race to sell 100,000 metric tons of fish food, without the fish. Earlier this month, start-ups from places like Pakistan, China, and Belgium joined their American competition at the Google headquarters in Mountain View, California, showing off feed made from seaweed extracts, yeast, and algae grown in bioreactors.&quot;

Not only do the feeds for carnivorous fish, like certain salmon species, remain controversial due to the containment of wild caught fish like anchovies, but they are not helping the health of the fish, as is the case in Norway. Between 2003 and 2007, Aldrin et al. examined three infectious diseases in Norwegian salmon fish farms—heart and skeletal muscle inflammation, pancreas disease, and infectious salmon anemia.

In 2014, Martinez-Rubio et al. conducted a study in which cardiomyopathy syndrome (CMS), a severe cardiac disease in Atlantic salmon (&quot;Salmo salar&quot;), was investigated pertaining the effects of functional feeds with reduced lipid content and increased eicosapentaenoic acid levels in controlling CMS in salmon after infection with Piscine Myocarditis Virus (PMCV). Functional feeds are defined as high-quality feeds that beyond purposes of nutrition, they are formulated with health promoting features that could be beneficial in supporting disease resistance, such as CMS. Choosing a clinical nutrition approach using functional feeds could potentially move away from chemotherapeutic and antibiotic treatments, which could lower the costs of disease treatment and management in fish farms. In this investigation three fishmeal-based diets were served—one made of 31% lipid and the other two made of 18% lipid (one contained fishmeal and the other krill meal. Results demonstrated a significant difference in the immune and inflammatory responses and pathology in heart tissue as the fish were infected with PMCV. Fish fed with functional feeds with low lipid content demonstrated milder and delayed inflammatory response and therefore, less severe heart lesions at earlier and later stages after PMCV infection.

=== Stocking density ===
Secondly, farmed fish are kept in concentrations never seen in the wild (e.g. 50,000 fish in a area.). However, fish tend also to be animals that aggregate into large schools at high density. Most successful aquaculture species are schooling species, which do not have social problems at high density. Aquaculturists feel that operating a rearing system above its design capacity or above the social density limit of the fish will result in decreased growth rate and increased feed conversion ratio (kg dry feed/kg of fish produced), which results in increased cost and risk of health problems along with a decrease in profits. Stressing the animals is not desirable, but the concept of and measurement of stress must be viewed from the perspective of the animal using the scientific method.

=== Parasites and disease ===
Sea lice, particularly &quot;Lepeophtheirus salmonis&quot; and various &quot;Caligus&quot; species, including &quot;C. clemensi&quot; and &quot;C. rogercresseyi&quot;, can cause deadly infestations of both farm-grown and wild salmon. Sea lice are ectoparasites which feed on mucus, blood, and skin, and migrate and latch onto the skin of wild salmon during free-swimming, planktonic &quot;nauplii&quot; and &quot;copepodid&quot; larval stages, which can persist for several days. Large numbers of highly populated, open-net salmon farms can create exceptionally large concentrations of sea lice; when exposed in river estuaries containing large numbers of open-net farms, many young wild salmon are infected, and do not survive as a result. Adult salmon may survive otherwise critical numbers of sea lice, but small, thin-skinned juvenile salmon migrating to sea are highly vulnerable. On the Pacific coast of Canada, the louse-induced mortality of pink salmon in some regions is commonly over 80%. In Scotland, official figures show that more than nine million fish were lost to disease, parasites, botched treatment attempts and other problems on fish farms between 2016 and 2019. One of the treatments for parasite infestations involved bathing fish in hydrogen peroxide, which can harm or kill farmed fish if they are in a weak condition or if the chemical concentration is too strong.

A 2008 meta-analysis of available data shows that salmon farming reduces the survival of associated wild salmon populations. This relationship has been shown to hold for Atlantic, steelhead, pink, chum, and coho salmon. The decrease in survival or abundance often exceeds 50%.

Diseases and parasites are the most commonly cited reasons for such decreases. Some species of sea lice have been noted to target farmed coho and Atlantic salmon. Such parasites have been shown to have an effect on nearby wild fish. One place that has garnered international media attention is British Columbia&#x27;s Broughton Archipelago. There, juvenile wild salmon must &quot;run a gauntlet&quot; of large fish farms located off-shore near river outlets before making their way to sea. The farms allegedly cause such severe sea lice infestations that one study predicted in 2007 a 99% collapse in the wild salmon population by 2011. This claim, however, has been criticized by numerous scientists who question the correlation between increased fish farming and increases in sea lice infestation among wild salmon.

Because of parasite problems, some aquaculture operators frequently use strong antibiotic drugs to keep the fish alive, but many fish still die prematurely at rates up to 30%. Additionally, other common drugs used in salmonid fish farms in North America and Europe include anesthetic, chemotherapeutic, and anthelmintic agents. In some cases, these drugs have entered the environment. Additionally, the residual presence of these drugs in human food products has become controversial. Use of antibiotics in food production is thought to increase the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in human diseases. At some facilities, the use of antibiotic drugs in aquaculture has decreased considerably due to vaccinations and other techniques. However, most fish-farming operations still use antibiotics, many of which escape into the surrounding environment.

The lice and pathogen problems of the 1990s facilitated the development of current treatment methods for sea lice and pathogens, which reduced the stress from parasite/pathogen problems. However, being in an ocean environment, the transfer of disease organisms from the wild fish to the aquaculture fish is an ever-present risk.
=== Ecosystem impacts ===
The large number of fish kept long-term in a single location contributes to habitat destruction of the nearby areas. The high concentrations of fish produce a significant amount of condensed faeces, often contaminated with drugs, which again affects local waterways.

Aquaculture not only impacts the fish on the farm, but it also influences other species, which in return are attracted to or repelled by the farms. Mobile fauna, such as crustaceans, fish, birds, and marine mammals, interact with the process of aquaculture, but the long-term or ecological effects as a result of these interactions is still unknown. Some of these fauna may be attracted or demonstrate repulsion. The attraction/repulsion mechanism has various direct and indirect effects on wild organisms at individual and population levels. The interactions that wild organisms have with aquaculture may have implications on the management of fisheries species and the ecosystem in relation to how the fish farms are structured and organized. 

=== Siting ===
If aquaculture farms are placed in an area with strong current, pollutants can be flushed out of the area fairly quickly. This helps manage the pollution problem and also aids in overall fish growth.
Concern remains that resultant bacterial growth fertilised by fish faeces strips the water of oxygen, reducing or killing off the local marine life. Once an area has been so contaminated, fish farms are typically moved to new, uncontaminated areas. This practice has angered nearby fishermen.

Other potential problems faced by aquaculturists include the obtaining of various permits and water-use rights, profitability, concerns about invasive species and genetic engineering depending on what species are involved, and interaction with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.

=== Genetic engineering ===
In regards to genetically engineered, farmed salmon, concern has been raised over their proven reproductive advantage and how it could potentially decimate local fish populations, if released into the wild. Biologist Rick Howard did a controlled laboratory study where wild fish and genetically engineered fish were allowed to breed. In 1989, AquaBounty Technologies developed the AquAdvantage salmon. The concerns and critiques of cultivating this genetically engineered fish in aquaculture are that the fish will escape and interact with other fish ultimately leading to the reproduction with other fishes. However, the FDA, has determined that while net pens would not be the most appropriate to prevent escapes, raising the salmon in Panama waters would effectively prevent escape because the water conditions there would fail to support long-term survival of any escaped salmon. Another method of preventing Aqua Advantage fish from impacting the ecosystems in the case they escape suggested by the FDA was to create sterile triploid females. This way concerns on reproducing with other fishes would be out of the question. The genetically engineered fish crowded out the wild fish in spawning beds, but the offspring were less likely to survive. The colorant used to make pen-raised salmon appear rosy like the wild fish has been linked with retinal problems in humans.

=== Labeling ===
In 2005, Alaska passed legislation requiring that any genetically altered fish sold in the state be labeled.
In 2006, a &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; investigation revealed that farm-raised salmon is frequently sold as wild.

In 2008, the US National Organic Standards Board allowed farmed fish to be labeled as organic provided less than 25% of their feed came from wild fish. This decision was criticized by the advocacy group Food &amp; Water Watch as &quot;bending the rules&quot; about organic labeling. In the European Union, fish labeling as to species, method of production and origin has been required since 2002.

Concerns continue over the labeling of salmon as farmed or wild-caught, as well as about the humane treatment of farmed fish. The Marine Stewardship Council has established an Eco label to distinguish between farmed and wild-caught salmon, while the RSPCA has established the Freedom Food label to indicate humane treatment of farmed salmon, as well as other food products.

== Indoor fish farming ==
Other treatments such as ultraviolet sterilization, ozonation, and oxygen injection are also used to maintain optimal water quality. Through this system, many of the environmental drawbacks of aquaculture are minimized including escaped fish, water usage, and the introduction of pollutants. The practices also increased feed-use efficiency growth by providing optimum water quality.

One of the drawbacks to recirculating aquaculture systems is the need for periodic water exchanges. However, the rate of water exchange can be reduced through aquaponics, such as the incorporation of hydroponically grown plants and denitrification. Both methods reduce the amount of nitrate in the water, and can potentially eliminate the need for water exchanges, closing the aquaculture system from the environment. The amount of interaction between the aquaculture system and the environment can be measured through the cumulative feed burden (CFB kg/M3), which measures the amount of feed that goes into the RAS relative to the amount of water and waste discharged. The environmental impact of larger indoor fish farming system will be linked to the local infrastructure, and water supply. Areas which are more drought-prone, indoor fish farms might flow out wastewater for watering agricultural farms, reducing the water affliction.

From 2011, a team from the University of Waterloo led by Tahbit Chowdhury and Gordon Graff examined vertical RAS aquaculture designs aimed at producing protein-rich fish species. However, because of its high capital and operating costs, RAS has generally been restricted to practices such as broodstock maturation, larval rearing, fingerling production, research animal production, specific pathogen-free animal production, and caviar and ornamental fish production. As such, research and design work by Chowdhury and Graff remains difficult to implement. Although the use of RAS for other species is considered by many aquaculturalists to be currently impractical, some limited successful implementation of RAS has occurred with high-value product such as barramundi, sturgeon, and live tilapia in the US, eels and catfish in the Netherlands, trout in Denmark and salmon is planned in Scotland and Canada.

== Slaughter methods ==
Tanks saturated with carbon dioxide have been used to make fish unconscious. Their gills are then cut with a knife so that the fish bleed out before they are further processed. This is no longer considered a humane method of slaughter. Methods that induce much less physiological stress are electrical or percussive stunning and this has led to the phasing out of the carbon dioxide slaughter method in Europe.

=== Inhumane methods ===
According to T. Håstein of the National Veterinary Institute (Oslo, Norway), &quot;Different methods for slaughter of fish are in place and it is no doubt that many of them may be considered as appalling from an animal welfare point of view.&quot; A 2004 report by the EFSA Scientific Panel on Animal Health and Welfare explained: &quot;Many existing commercial killing methods expose fish to substantial suffering over a prolonged period of time. For some species, existing methods, whilst capable of killing fish humanely, are not doing so because operators don&#x27;t have the knowledge to evaluate them.&quot; Following are some less humane ways of killing fish.
* Air asphyxiation amounts to suffocation in the open air. The process can take upwards of 15 minutes to induce death, although unconsciousness typically sets in sooner.
* Ice baths or chilling of farmed fish on ice or submerged in near-freezing water is used to dampen muscle movements by the fish and to delay the onset of post-death decay. However, it does not necessarily reduce sensibility to pain; indeed, the chilling process has been shown to elevate cortisol. In addition, reduced body temperature extends the time before fish lose consciousness.
* CO narcosis
* Exsanguination without stunning is a process in which fish are taken up from water, held still, and cut so as to cause bleeding. According to references in Yue, this can leave fish writhing for an average of four minutes, and some catfish still responded to noxious stimuli after more than 15 minutes.
* Immersion in salt followed by gutting or other processing such as smoking is applied to eel.

=== More humane methods ===
Proper stunning renders the fish unconscious immediately and for a sufficient period of time such that the fish is killed in the slaughter process (e.g. through exsanguination) without regaining consciousness.
* Percussive stunning involves rendering the fish unconscious with a blow on the head.
* Electric stunning can be humane when a proper current is made to flow through the fish brain for a sufficient period of time. Electric stunning can be applied after the fish has been taken out of the water (dry stunning) or while the fish is still in the water. The latter generally requires a much higher current and may lead to operator safety issues. An advantage could be that in-water stunning allows fish to be rendered unconscious without stressful handling or displacement. However, improper stunning may not induce insensibility long enough to prevent the fish from enduring exsanguination while conscious. Whether the optimal stunning parameters that researchers have determined in studies are used by the industry in practice is unknown.

<text>A plastid is a membrane-bound organelle found in the cells of plants, algae, and some other eukaryotic organisms. Plastids are considered to be intracellular endosymbiotic cyanobacteria.

Examples of plastids include chloroplasts (used for photosynthesis); chromoplasts (used for synthesis and storage of pigments); leucoplasts (non-pigmented plastids, some of which can differentiate); and apicoplasts (non-photosynthetic plastids of apicomplexa derived from secondary endosymbiosis).

A permanent primary endosymbiosis event occurred about 1.5 billion years ago in the Archaeplastida cladeland plants, red algae, green algae and glaucophytesprobably with a cyanobiont, a symbiotic cyanobacteria related to the genus &quot;Gloeomargarita&quot;. Another primary endosymbiosis event occurred later, between 140 and 90 million years ago, in the photosynthetic plastids &quot;Paulinella&quot; amoeboids of the cyanobacteria genera &quot;Prochlorococcus&quot; and &quot;Synechococcus&quot;, or the &quot;PS-clade&quot;. Secondary and tertiary endosymbiosis events have also occurred in a wide variety of organisms; and some organisms developed the capacity to sequester ingested plastidsa process known as kleptoplasty.

A. F. W. Schimper was the first to name, describe, and provide a clear definition of plastids, which possess a double-stranded DNA molecule that long has been thought of as circular in shape, like that of the circular chromosome of &quot;pro&quot;karyotic cellsbut now, perhaps not; (see &quot;..a linear shape&quot;). Plastids are sites for manufacturing and storing pigments and other important chemical compounds used by the cells of autotrophic eukaryotes. Some contain biological pigments such as used in photosynthesis or which determine a cell&#x27;s color. Plastids in organisms that have lost their photosynthetic properties are highly useful for manufacturing molecules like the isoprenoids.

== In land plants ==

===Chloroplasts, proplastids, and differentiation===
In land plants, the plastids that contain chlorophyll can perform photosynthesis, thereby creating internal chemical energy from external sunlight energy while capturing carbon from Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and furnishing the atmosphere with life-giving oxygen. These are the &quot;chlorophyll-plastids&quot;and they are named chloroplasts; (see top graphic).

Other plastids can synthesize fatty acids and terpenes, which may be used to produce energy or as raw material to synthesize other molecules. For example, plastid epidermal cells manufacture the components of the tissue system known as plant cuticle, including its epicuticular wax, from palmitic acidwhich itself is synthesized in the chloroplasts of the mesophyll tissue. Plastids function to store different components including starches, fats, and proteins.

All plastids are derived from proplastids, which are present in the meristematic regions of the plant. Proplastids and young chloroplasts typically divide by binary fission, but more mature chloroplasts also have this capacity.

Plant &quot;proplastids&quot; (undifferentiated plastids) may differentiate into several forms, depending upon which function they perform in the cell, (see top graphic). They may develop into any of the following variants:
* Chloroplasts: typically green plastids that perform photosynthesis. 
** Etioplasts: precursors of chloroplasts.
* Chromoplasts: coloured plastids that synthesize and store pigments.
* Gerontoplasts: plastids that control the dismantling of the photosynthetic apparatus during plant senescence.
* Leucoplasts: colourless plastids that synthesize monoterpenes.
Leucoplasts differentiate into even more specialized plastids, such as:
* the aleuroplasts;
** Amyloplasts: storing starch and detecting gravityfor maintaining geotropism.
** Elaioplasts: storing fats.
** Proteinoplasts: storing and modifying protein.
* or Tannosomes: synthesizing and producing tannins and polyphenols.

Depending on their morphology and target function, plastids have the ability to differentiate or redifferentiate between these and other forms.

===Plastomes and Chloroplast DNA/ RNA; plastid DNA and plastid nucleoids===

Each plastid creates multiple copies of its own unique genome, or plastome, (from &#x27;plastid genome&#x27;)which for a chlorophyll plastid (or chloroplast) is equivalent to a &#x27;chloroplast genome&#x27;, or a &#x27;chloroplast DNA&#x27;. The number of genome copies produced per plastid is variable, ranging from 1000 or more in rapidly dividing new cells, encompassing only a few plastids, down to 100 or less in mature cells, encompassing numerous plastids.

A plastome typically contains a genome that encodes &quot;transfer&quot; ribonucleic acids (tRNA)s and &quot;ribosomal&quot; ribonucleic acids (rRNAs). It also contains proteins involved in photosynthesis and plastid gene transcription and translation. But these proteins represent only a small fraction of the total protein set-up necessary to build and maintain any particular type of plastid. Nuclear genes (in the cell nucleus of a plant) encode the vast majority of plastid proteins; and the expression of nuclear and plastid genes is co-regulated to coordinate the development and differention of plastids.

Many plastids, particularly those responsible for photosynthesis, possess numerous internal membrane layers. Plastid DNA exists as protein-DNA complexes associated as localized &quot;regions&quot; within the plastid&#x27;s inner envelope membrane; and these complexes are called &#x27;plastid nucleoids&#x27;. Unlike the nucleus of a eukaryotic cell, a plastid nucleoid is &quot;not&quot; surrounded by a nuclear membrane. The region of each nucleoid may contain more than 10 copies of the plastid DNA.

Where the proplastid (&quot;undifferentiated plastid&quot;) contains a single nucleoid region located near the centre of the proplastid, the &quot;developing (or differentiating) plastid&quot; has many nucleoids localized at the periphery of the plastid and bound to the inner envelope membrane. During the development/ differentiation of proplastids to chloroplastsand when plastids are differentiating from one type to anothernucleoids change in morphology, size, and location within the organelle. The remodelling of plastid nucleoids is believed to occur by modifications to the abundance of and the composition of nucleoid proteins.

In normal plant cells long thin protuberances called stromules sometimes formextending from the plastid body into the cell cytosol while interconnecting several plastids. Proteins and smaller molecules can move around and through the stromules. Comparatively, in the laboratory, most cultured cellswhich are large compared to normal plant cellsproduce very long and abundant stromules that extend to the cell periphery.

In 2014, evidence was found of the possible loss of plastid genome in &quot;Rafflesia lagascae&quot;, a non-photosynthetic parasitic flowering plant, and in &quot;Polytomella&quot;, a genus of non-photosynthetic green algae. Extensive searches for plastid genes in both taxons yielded no results, but concluding that their plastomes are entirely missing is still disputed. Some scientists argue that plastid genome loss is unlikely since even these non-photosynthetic plastids contain genes necessary to complete various biosynthetic pathways including heme biosynthesis.

Even with any loss of plastid genome in Rafflesiaceae, the plastids still occur there as &quot;shells&quot; without DNA content, which is reminiscent of hydrogenosomes in various organisms.

==In algae and protists==
Plastid types in algae and protists include:

* Chloroplasts: found in green algae (plants) and other organisms that derived their genomes from green algae.
* Muroplasts: also known as cyanoplasts or cyanelles, the plastids of glaucophyte algae are similar to plant chloroplasts, excepting they have a peptidoglycan cell wall that is similar to that of bacteria.
* Rhodoplasts: the red plastids found in red algae, which allows them to photosynthesize down to marine depths of 268 m. The chloroplasts of plants differ from rhodoplasts in their ability to synthesize starch, which is stored in the form of granules within the plastids. In red algae, floridean starch is synthesized and stored outside the plastids in the cytosol.
* Secondary and tertiary plastids: from endosymbiosis of green algae and red algae.
* Leucoplast: in algae, the term is used for all unpigmented plastids. Their function differs from the leucoplasts of plants.
* Apicoplast: the non-photosynthetic plastids of Apicomplexa derived from secondary endosymbiosis.

The plastid of photosynthetic &quot;Paulinella&quot; species is often referred to as the &#x27;cyanelle&#x27; or chromatophore, and is used in photosynthesis. It had a much more recent endosymbiotic event, in the range of 140–90 million years ago, which is the only other known primary endosymbiosis event of cyanobacteria.

Etioplasts, amyloplasts and chromoplasts are plant-specific and do not occur in algae. Plastids in algae and hornworts may also differ from plant plastids in that they contain pyrenoids.

==Inheritance==
In reproducing, most plants inherit their plastids from only one parent. In general, angiosperms inherit plastids from the female gamete, where many gymnosperms inherit plastids from the male pollen. Algae also inherit plastids from just one parent. Thus the plastid DNA of the other parent is completely lost.

In normal intraspecific crossingsresulting in normal hybrids of one speciesthe inheriting of plastid DNA appears to be strictly uniparental; i.e., from the female. In interspecific hybridisations, however, the inheriting is apparently more erratic. Although plastids are inherited mainly from the female in interspecific hybridisations, there are many reports of hybrids of flowering plants producing plastids from the male.
Approximately 20% of angiosperms, including alfalfa (&quot;Medicago sativa&quot;), normally show biparental inheriting of plastids.

==DNA damage and repair==

The plastid DNA of maize seedlings is subjected to increasing damage as the seedlings develop. The DNA damage is due to oxidative environments created by photo-oxidative reactions and photosynthetic/ respiratory electron transfer. Some DNA molecules are repaired but DNA with unrepaired damage is apparently degraded to non-functional fragments.

DNA repair proteins are encoded by the cell&#x27;s nuclear genome and then translocated to plastids where they maintain genome stability/ integrity by repairing the plastid&#x27;s DNA. For example, in chloroplasts of the moss &quot;Physcomitrella patens&quot;, a protein employed in DNA mismatch repair (Msh1) interacts with proteins employed in recombinational repair (RecA and RecG) to maintain plastid genome stability.

==Origin==
Plastids are thought to be descended from endosymbiotic cyanobacteria. The primary endosymbiotic event of the Archaeplastida is hypothesized to have occurred around 1.5 billion years ago and enabled eukaryotes to carry out oxygenic photosynthesis. Three evolutionary lineages in the Archaeplastida have since emerged in which the plastids are named differently: chloroplasts in green algae and/or plants, rhodoplasts in red algae, and muroplasts in the glaucophytes. The plastids differ both in their pigmentation and in their ultrastructure. For example, chloroplasts in plants and green algae have lost all phycobilisomes, the light harvesting complexes found in cyanobacteria, red algae and glaucophytes, but instead contain stroma and grana thylakoids. The glaucocystophycean plastid—in contrast to chloroplasts and rhodoplasts—is still surrounded by the remains of the cyanobacterial cell wall. All these primary plastids are surrounded by two membranes.

The plastid of photosynthetic &quot;Paulinella&quot; species is often referred to as the &#x27;cyanelle&#x27; or chromatophore, and had a much more recent endosymbiotic event about 90–140 million years ago; it is the only known primary endosymbiosis event of cyanobacteria outside of the Archaeplastida. The plastid belongs to the &quot;PS-clade&quot; (of the cyanobacteria genera &quot;Prochlorococcus&quot; and &quot;Synechococcus&quot;), which is a different sister clade to the plastids belonging to the Archaeplastida.

In contrast to primary plastids derived from primary endosymbiosis of a prokaryoctyic cyanobacteria, complex plastids originated by secondary endosymbiosis in which a eukaryotic organism engulfed another eukaryotic organism that contained a primary plastid. When a eukaryote engulfs a red or a green alga and retains the algal plastid, that plastid is typically surrounded by more than two membranes. In some cases these plastids may be reduced in their metabolic and/or photosynthetic capacity. Algae with complex plastids derived by secondary endosymbiosis of a red alga include the heterokonts, haptophytes, cryptomonads, and most dinoflagellates (= rhodoplasts). Those that endosymbiosed a green alga include the euglenids and chlorarachniophytes (= chloroplasts). The Apicomplexa, a phylum of obligate parasitic alveolates including the causative agents of malaria (&quot;Plasmodium&quot; spp.), toxoplasmosis (&quot;Toxoplasma gondii&quot;), and many other human or animal diseases also harbor a complex plastid (although this organelle has been lost in some apicomplexans, such as &quot;Cryptosporidium parvum&quot;, which causes cryptosporidiosis). The &#x27;apicoplast&#x27; is no longer capable of photosynthesis, but is an essential organelle, and a promising target for antiparasitic drug development.

Some dinoflagellates and sea slugs, in particular of the genus &quot;Elysia&quot;, take up algae as food and keep the plastid of the digested alga to profit from the photosynthesis; after a while, the plastids are also digested. This process is known as kleptoplasty, from the Greek, &quot;kleptes&quot; (), thief.

== Plastid development cycle ==

In 1977 J.M Whatley proposed a plastid development cycle which said that plastid development is not always unidirectional but is instead a complicated cyclic process. Proplastids are the precursor of the more differentiated forms of plastids, as shown in the diagram to the right.

<text>The West Germanic languages constitute the largest of the three branches of the Germanic family of languages (the others being the North Germanic and the extinct East Germanic languages). The West Germanic branch is classically subdivided into three branches: Ingvaeonic, which includes English, the Low German languages, and the Frisian languages; Istvaeonic, which encompasses Dutch and its close relatives; and Irminonic, which includes German and its close relatives and variants.

English is by far the most-spoken West Germanic language, with more than 1 billion speakers worldwide. Within Europe, the three most prevalent West Germanic languages are English, German, and Dutch. Frisian, spoken by about 450,000 people, constitutes a fourth distinct variety of West Germanic. The language family also includes Afrikaans, Yiddish, Low Saxon, Luxembourgish, Hunsrik, and Scots. Additionally, several creoles, patois, and pidgins are based on Dutch, English, or German.

==History==

===Origins and characteristics===
The Germanic languages are traditionally divided into three groups: West, East and North Germanic. In some cases, their exact relation was difficult to determine from the sparse evidence of runic inscriptions, so that some individual varieties have been difficult to classify. This is especially true for the unattested Jutish language; today, most scholars classify Jutish as a West Germanic variety with several features of North Germanic.

Until the late 20th century, some scholars claimed that all Germanic languages remained mutually intelligible throughout the Migration Period, while others hold that speakers of West Germanic dialects like Old Frankish and speakers of Gothic were already unable to communicate fluently by around the 3rd century AD. As a result of the substantial progress in the study of Proto-West Germanic in the early 21st century, there is a growing consensus that East and West Germanic indeed would have been mutually unintelligible at that time, whereas West and North Germanic remained partially intelligible.

Dialects with the features assigned to the western group formed from Proto-Germanic in the late Jastorf culture (). The West Germanic group is characterized by a number of phonological, morphological and lexical innovations or archaisms not found in North and East Germanic. Examples of West Germanic phonological particularities are:

* The delabialization of all labiovelar consonants except word-initially.
* Change of &quot;*-zw-&quot; and &quot;*- đw-&quot; to &quot;*-ww-&quot; e.g. &quot;*izwiz&quot; &gt; &quot;*iwwiz&quot; &#x27;you&#x27; dat.pl.; &quot;*feđwōr&quot; &gt; &quot;*fewwōr&quot; &#x27;four&#x27;. 
* , the fricative allophone of , becomes in all positions. (The two other fricatives and are retained.). This must have occurred after &quot;*-zw-&quot; and &quot;*- đw-&quot; have become &quot;*-ww-&quot;.
* Replacement of the second-person singular preterite ending &quot;-t&quot; with &quot;-ī&quot; (indicative and subjunctive mood). For more than 150 years there has been a scientific debate on the best explanation of these difficult forms. Today, some linguists, beginning with J. v. Fierlinger in 1885 and followed by R. Löwe (1907), O. Behaghel (1922), Jakob Sverdrup (1927), Hermann Hirt (1932), E. Polomé (1964), W. Meid (1971), E. Hill (2004), K.-H. Mottausch and W. Euler (1992ff.) explain this ending as a relic of the Indo-European aorist tense. Under this assumption, the ending &quot;-t&quot; would have replaced older &quot;-ī(z)&quot;. Sceptical about this explanation – and mostly explaining these forms as influenced by optative forms – are W. Scherer (1868), W. L. van Helten (before 1917), Edward Schröder (1921), Bammesberger (1986) and Don Ringe (2014).
* Loss of word-final . Only Old High German preserves it at all (as ) and only in single-syllable words. Following the later loss of word-final and , this made the nominative and accusative of many nouns identical.
* Loss of final &quot;*-a&quot; (including from PGmc. &quot;*-an#&quot;) in polysyllables: e.g. acc. sg. OHG &quot;horn&quot; vs. ORu. &quot;horna&quot; &#x27;horn&#x27;; this change must have occurred after the loss of word-final .
* West Germanic gemination: lengthening of all consonants except before .; this change must have occurred after the loss of final *-a.
* Change of Proto-Germanic &quot;*e&quot; to &quot;i&quot; before &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot;.

A relative chronology of about 20 sound changes from Proto-Northwest Germanic to Proto-West Germanic (some of them only regional) was published by Don Ringe in 2014.

A phonological archaism of West Germanic is the preservation of &quot;grammatischer Wechsel&quot; in most verbs, particularly in Old High German. This implies the same for West Germanic, whereas in East and North Germanic many of these alternations (in Gothic almost all of them) had been levelled out analogically by the time of the earliest texts.

A common morphological innovation of the West Germanic languages is the development of a gerund.

Common morphological archaisms of West Germanic include:
* The preservation of an instrumental case,
* the preservation of the athematic verbs (e.g. Anglo-Saxon &quot;dō(m)&quot;, Old Saxon &quot;dōm&quot;, OHG. &quot;tōm&quot; &quot;I do&quot;),
* the preservation of some traces of the aorist (in Old English and Old High German, but neither in Gothic nor in North Germanic).

Furthermore, the West Germanic languages share many lexemes not existing in North Germanic and/or East Germanic – archaisms as well as common neologisms. Some lexemes have specific meanings in West Germanic and there are specific innovations in word formation and derivational morphology, for example neologisms ending with modern English &quot;-ship&quot; (&lt; wgerm. &quot;-*skapi&quot;, cf. German &quot;-schaft&quot;) like &quot;friendship&quot; (&lt; wg. &quot;*friund(a)skapi&quot;, cf. German &quot;Freundschaft&quot;) are specific to the West Germanic languages and are thus seen as a Proto West Germanic innovation.

=== Validity of West Germanic as a subgroup ===
Since at least the early 20th century, a number of morphological, phonological, and lexical archaisms and innovations have been identified as specifically West Germanic. Since then, individual Proto-West Germanic lexemes have also been reconstructed. Yet, there was a long dispute if these West Germanic characteristics had to be explained with the existence of a West Germanic proto-language or rather with Sprachbund effects. Hans Frede Nielsen&#x27;s 1981 study &quot;Old English and the Continental Germanic Languages&quot; made the conviction grow that a West Germanic proto-language did exist. But up until the 1990s, some scholars doubted that there was once a Proto-West Germanic proto-language which was ancestral only to later West Germanic languages. In 2002, Gert Klingenschmitt presented a series of pioneering reconstructions of Proto-West Germanic morphological paradigmas and new views on some early West Germanic phonological changes, and in 2013 the first monographic analysis and description of Proto-West Germanic was published (second edition 2022).

Today, there is a scientific consensus on what Don Ringe stated in 2012, that &quot;these [phonological and morphological] changes amount to a massive evidence for a valid West Germanic clade&quot;.

After East Germanic broke off (an event usually dated to the 2nd or 1st century BC), the remaining Germanic languages, the Northwest Germanic languages, divided into four main dialects: North Germanic, and the three groups conventionally called &quot;West Germanic&quot;, namely:
* Northwest Germanic
** North Sea Germanic, ancestral to Anglo-Frisian and Old Saxon
** Weser–Rhine Germanic, ancestral to Old Dutch and present as a substrate or superstrate in some of the Central Franconian and Rhine Franconian dialects of Old High German
** Elbe Germanic, ancestral to the Upper German and most Central German dialects of Old High German, and the extinct Langobardic language.
Although there is quite a bit of knowledge about North Sea Germanic or Anglo-Frisian (because of the characteristic features of its daughter languages, Anglo-Saxon/Old English and Old Frisian), linguists know almost nothing about &quot;Weser–Rhine Germanic&quot; and &quot;Elbe Germanic&quot;. In fact, both terms were coined in the 1940s to refer to groups of archaeological findings, rather than linguistic features. Only later were the terms applied to hypothetical dialectal differences within both regions. Even today, the very small number of Migration Period runic inscriptions from the area, many of them illegible, unclear or consisting only of one word, often a name, is insufficient to identify linguistic features specific to the two supposed dialect groups.

Evidence that East Germanic split off before the split between North and West Germanic comes from a number of linguistic innovations common to North and West Germanic, including:
* The lowering of Proto-Germanic &quot;ē&quot; (, also written &quot;ǣ&quot;) to &quot;ā&quot;.
* The development of umlaut.
* The rhotacism of to .
* The development of the demonstrative pronoun ancestral to English &quot;this&quot;.

Under that view, the properties that the West Germanic languages have in common, separate from the North Germanic languages, are not necessarily inherited from a &quot;Proto-West Germanic&quot; language, but may have spread by language contact among the Germanic languages spoken in Central Europe, not reaching those spoken in Scandinavia or reaching them much later. Rhotacism, for example, was largely complete in West Germanic while North Germanic runic inscriptions still clearly distinguished the two phonemes. There is also evidence that the lowering of &quot;ē&quot; to &quot;ā&quot; occurred first in West Germanic and spread to North Germanic later since word-final &quot;ē&quot; was lowered before it was shortened in West Germanic, but in North Germanic the shortening occurred first, resulting in &quot;e&quot; that later merged with &quot;i&quot;. However, there are also a number of common archaisms in West Germanic shared by neither Old Norse nor Gothic. Some authors who support the concept of a West Germanic proto-language claim that, not only shared innovations can require the existence of a linguistic clade, but also that there are archaisms that cannot be explained simply as retentions later lost in the North or East, because this assumption can produce contradictions with attested features of the other branches.

The debate on the existence of a Proto-West Germanic clade was summarized (2006):
That North Germanic is ... a unitary subgroup [of Proto-Germanic] is completely obvious, as all of its dialects shared a long series of innovations, some of them very striking. That the same is true of West Germanic has been denied, but I will argue in vol. ii that all the West Germanic languages share several highly unusual innovations that virtually force us to posit a West Germanic clade. On the other hand, the internal subgrouping of both North Germanic and West Germanic is very messy, and it seems clear that each of those subfamilies diversified into a network of dialects that remained in contact for a considerable period of time (in some cases right up to the present).
===The reconstruction of Proto-West Germanic===
Several scholars have published reconstructions of Proto-West Germanic morphological paradigms and many authors have reconstructed individual Proto-West Germanic morphological forms or lexemes. The first comprehensive reconstruction of the Proto-West Germanic language was published in 2013 by Wolfram Euler, followed in 2014 by the study of Donald Ringe and Ann Taylor.

===Dating Early West Germanic===

If indeed Proto-West Germanic existed, it must have been between the 2nd and 7th centuries. Until the late 2nd century AD, the language of runic inscriptions found in Scandinavia and in Northern Germany were so similar that Proto-North Germanic and the Western dialects in the south were still part of one language (&quot;Proto-Northwest Germanic&quot;).

Sometime after that, the split into West and North Germanic occurred. By the 4th and 5th centuries the great migration set in. By the end of the 6th century, the area in which West Germanic languages were spoken, at least by the upper classes, had tripled compared to the year 400. This caused an increasing disintegration of the West Germanic language and finally the formation of the daughter languages.

It has been argued that, judging by their nearly identical syntax, the West Germanic dialects were closely enough related to have been mutually intelligible up to the 7th century. Over the course of this period, the dialects diverged successively. The High German consonant shift that occurred mostly during the 7th century AD in what is now southern Germany, Austria, and Switzerland can be considered the end of the linguistic unity among the West Germanic dialects, although its effects on their own should not be overestimated. Bordering dialects very probably continued to be mutually intelligible even beyond the boundaries of the consonant shift.

===Middle Ages===

During the Early Middle Ages, the West Germanic languages were separated by the insular development of Old and Middle English on one hand, and by the High German consonant shift on the continent on the other.

The High German consonant shift distinguished the High German languages from the other West Germanic languages. By early modern times, the span had extended into considerable differences, ranging from Highest Alemannic in the South (the Walliser dialect being the southernmost surviving German dialect) to Northern Low Saxon in the North. Although both extremes are considered German, they are not mutually intelligible. The southernmost varieties have completed the second sound shift, whereas the northern dialects remained unaffected by the consonant shift.

Of modern German varieties, Low German is the one that most resembles modern English. The district of Angeln (or Anglia), from which the name &quot;English&quot; derives, is in the extreme northern part of Germany between the Danish border and the Baltic coast. The area of the Saxons (parts of today&#x27;s Schleswig-Holstein and Lower Saxony) lay south of Anglia. The Angles and Saxons, two Germanic tribes, in combination with a number of other peoples from northern Germany and the Jutland Peninsula, particularly the Jutes, settled in Britain following the end of Roman rule in the island. Once in Britain, these Germanic peoples eventually developed a shared cultural and linguistic identity as Anglo-Saxons; the extent of the linguistic influence of the native Romano-British population on the incomers is debatable.
== Family tree ==


Divisions between subfamilies of continental Germanic languages are rarely precisely defined; most form dialect continua, with adjacent dialects being mutually intelligible and more separated ones not.

==Comparison of phonological and morphological features==

The following table shows a list of various linguistic features and their extent among the West Germanic languages, organized roughly from northwest to southeast. Some may only appear in the older languages but are no longer apparent in the modern languages.

The following table shows some comparisons of consonant development in the respective dialect/language (online examples though) continuum, showing the gradually growing partake in the High German consonant shift and the anglofrisian palatalization. The table uses IPA, to avoid confusion via orthographical differences. The realisation of [r] will be ignored.

C = any consonant, A = back vowel, E = front vowel
== Phonology ==

The existence of a unified Proto-West Germanic language is debated. Features which are common to West Germanic languages may be attributed either to common inheritance or to areal effects.

The phonological system of the West Germanic branching as reconstructed is mostly similar to that of Proto-Germanic, with some changes in the categorization and phonetic realization of some phonemes.

=== Consonants ===
In addition to the particular changes described above, some notable differences in the consonant system of West Germanic from Proto-Germanic are:

* Fortition of /ð/ to /d/ in all positions
* The transition of /z/ into a rhotic consonant (often transcribed as ʀ), which eventually merged with /r/
* A process referred to as West Germanic gemination, which is visible in the history of all West Germanic languages

=== Vowels ===
Some notable differences in the vowel system of West Germanic from Proto-Germanic are:

* Reduction of overlong vowels to simple long vowels
* Lowering of /ɛː/ to /æː/
* The creation of a new short /o/ phoneme, from the lowering of /u/ in initial syllables before /a/, and the reduction of word-final /ɔː/

==Morphology==

===Nouns===

The noun paradigms of Proto-West Germanic have been reconstructed as follows:

==West Germanic vocabulary==
The following table compares a number of Frisian, English, Scots, Yola, Dutch, Limburgish, German and Afrikaans words with common West Germanic (or older) origin. The grammatical gender of each term is noted as masculine (&quot;m.&quot;), feminine (&quot;f.&quot;), or neuter (&quot;n.&quot;) where relevant.
Other words, with a variety of origins:

Note that some of the shown similarities of Frisian and English vis-à-vis Dutch and German are secondary and not due to a closer relationship between them. For example, the plural of the word for &quot;sheep&quot; was originally unchanged in all four languages and still is in some Dutch dialects and a great deal of German dialects. Many other similarities, however, are indeed old inheritances.

<doc id="153527" wikidata="Q31573" url="?curid=153527" title="Southern Ireland (1921–1922)">
<text>Southern Ireland (, ) , today known as the Republic of Ireland, or simply Ireland, was the larger of the two parts of Ireland that were created when Ireland was partitioned by the Government of Ireland Act 1920. It comprised 26 of the 32 counties of Ireland or about five-sixths of the area of the island, whilst the remaining six counties, which occupied most of Ulster in the north of the island, formed Northern Ireland. Southern Ireland included County Donegal, despite it being the largest county in Ulster and the most northerly county in all of Ireland.

The Act of 1920, which became effective on 3 May 1921, was intended to create two self-governing territories within Ireland, each with its own parliament and governmental institutions, and both remaining within the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. It also contained provisions for co-operation between the two territories and for the eventual reunification of Ireland. However, in the 1921 elections for Southern Ireland&#x27;s House of Commons, Sinn Féin candidates won 124 of the 128 seats (all candidates were unopposed and no actual polling occurred), and ignored the parliament, assembling instead as the Second Dáil. The Parliament of Southern Ireland—consisting of the four unionist members—met only once. Continuing unrest resulted in the Anglo-Irish Treaty and the Provisional Government, which administered Southern Ireland from 16 January 1922 to 5 December 1922: effectively a transitional administration for the period between the ratifying of the Anglo-Irish Treaty and the establishment of the Irish Free State. Its legitimacy was disputed by the Anti-Treaty delegates to Dáil Éireann.

Southern Ireland, as a political entity, was superseded by the Irish Free State on 6 December 1922 (which later became the fully independent state of Ireland from 1937 with the adoption of its own constitution).

==Home Rule and Partition==

The Government of Ireland Act 1920, also known as the Fourth Home Rule Act, was intended to provide a solution to the problem that had bedevilled Irish politics since the 1880s, namely the conflicting demands of Irish unionists and nationalists. Nationalists wanted a form of home rule, believing that Ireland was poorly served by Parliament at Westminster, the British Government at Whitehall and the Irish government at Dublin Castle. Many unionists feared that a nationalist government in Dublin would impose tariffs that would unduly burden the north-eastern counties of the province of Ulster, which were not only predominantly Protestant but also the only industrial area of a largely agricultural island. They also feared a nationalist government would discriminate against Protestants after gaining political power. Unionists bought and imported arms and assorted weapons from German arms dealer Bruno Spiro and established the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) to prevent Home Rule in Ulster. In response to this, nationalists also imported arms and established the Irish Volunteers. Partition, which was introduced by the Government of Ireland Act, was intended as a temporary solution, allowing Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland to be governed separately as regions of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. One of those most opposed to this partition settlement was the leader of Irish unionism, Dublin-born Sir Edward Carson, who felt that it was wrong to divide Ireland in two, and felt this would badly affect the position of southern and western unionists.

==Government of Ireland Act 1920==

The Government of Ireland Act, passed at the end of December 1920, envisaged that Southern Ireland would have the following institutions:

*a Parliament of Southern Ireland, consisting of the King, the Senate of Southern Ireland, and the House of Commons of Southern Ireland;
*a Government of Southern Ireland;
*the Supreme Court of Judicature of Southern Ireland;
*the Court of Appeal in Southern Ireland; and
*His Majesty&#x27;s High Court of Justice in Southern Ireland.

It was also envisaged that Southern Ireland would share the following institutions with Northern Ireland:

*the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland – existing throughout the life of Southern Ireland, with the incumbent, Lord FitzAlan of Derwent, continuing in office as Lord Lieutenant;
*a Council of Ireland – established &quot;with a view to the eventual establishment of a Parliament for the whole of Ireland&quot;, but subsequently abolished during 1925 after the termination of the Boundary Commission; and
*a High Court of Appeal for Ireland – which was established, and heard a small number of cases before its abolition by the UK&#x27;s Irish Free State (Consequential Provisions) Act 1922.

==1921 parliamentary elections==

While Northern Ireland did become a functioning entity, with a parliament and government that existed until 1972, Southern Ireland&#x27;s Parliament, although established legally, never functioned (for example, it never passed an Act). The House of Commons of Southern Ireland met just once with only four members present. An Irish Republic had been proclaimed by the parliament known as Dáil Éireann, formed by Sinn Féin Members of Parliament (MPs) elected from Ireland in the United Kingdom general election of 1918. Parliamentary elections in Ireland, effected by the Government of Ireland Act 1920, were held during May 1921. The first general election to the House of Commons of Southern Ireland in 1921, and the simultaneous general election to the House of Commons of Northern Ireland, was used by Sinn Féin to produce a single extrajudicial parliament, the Second Dáil. In the Southern Ireland constituencies Sinn Féin won 124 of the 128 seats, all without contest, while in the contested elections in Northern Ireland constituencies it secured six of the 52 seats, another six going to non-Sinn Féin nationalists. (The other four Southern seats were won by Unionists from Dublin and the Dublin University constituency, who along with the forty Unionists elected in the North refused to participate with the Second Dáil.) When the new Parliament of Southern Ireland was called into session on 28 June 1921, only the four Unionist members of the House of Commons of Southern Ireland, and a few appointed senators, arrived in the Royal College of Science in Dublin, where the meeting was scheduled to occur; most of the other members met elsewhere as the Dáil.

==Treaty and Free State==

The Anglo-Irish Treaty was further ratified for the Irish on 14 January 1922 by &quot;a meeting summoned for the purpose [of approving the Treaty] of the members elected to sit in the House of Commons of Southern Ireland&quot;. The treaty, in specifying a &quot;meeting of members&quot;, did not state that the treaty needed to be approved by the House of Commons of Southern Ireland as such. Hence, when that &quot;meeting&quot; was convened, it was convened by Arthur Griffith in his capacity as &quot;Chairman of the Irish Delegation of Plenipotentiaries&quot; (who had signed the Treaty). Notably, it was not convened by Viscount FitzAlan, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, who, by the Government of Ireland Act 1920, was the office-holder with the entitlement to convene a meeting of the House of Commons of Southern Ireland.

The Provisional Government established by the treaty was constituted on 14 January 1922 at the above-mentioned meeting of members of the Parliament elected for constituencies in Southern Ireland. It began office two days later when Michael Collins became Chairman of the Provisional Government. Collins assumed charge of Dublin Castle at a ceremony attended by Lord FitzAlan. The new government was not an institution of Southern Ireland as provided by the Government of Ireland Act. Instead, it was a government established by the Anglo-Irish Treaty, and was a necessary transitional entity before the establishment of the Irish Free State on 6 December 1922.

Southern Ireland was self-governing but was not a sovereign state. Its constitutional nature derived from the Acts of Union, two complementary acts, one passed by the Parliament of Great Britain, the other by the Parliament of Ireland.

On 27 May 1922 (some months before the establishment of the Irish Free State), Lord FitzAlan, as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, in accordance with the Irish Free State (Agreement) Act 1922, dissolved the Parliament of Southern Ireland and by proclamation called &quot;a Parliament to be known as and styled the Provisional Parliament&quot;. From that date, the Parliament of Southern Ireland ceased to exist. With the establishment of the Irish Free State on 6 December 1922 by the terms of the treaty, Southern Ireland ceased to exist.

<doc id="153550" wikidata="Q389860" url="?curid=153550" title="Kalwaria Zebrzydowska">
<text>Kalwaria Zebrzydowska () is a town in southern Poland with 4,429 inhabitants (2007 estimate). As of 1999, it is situated in Lesser Poland or Małopolska (in Polish). Previously, the town was administered within the Voivodeship of Bielsko-Biała (1975–1998).

==Overview==

With a vision while viewing the neighbouring hills and valleys from the Castle of Lanckorona, on 1 December 1602, Mikołaj Zebrzydowski, the Voivode of Kraków commissioned the construction of a calvary, i.e. Roman Catholic monastery and the trails of the Passion of Christ modeled on the Calvary outside the city walls of Jerusalem.

The town takes its name from the monastery that was constructed on the hills neighbouring Lanckorona and the last name of its founder Zebrzydowski. The town of Zebrzydów was established in 1617 in order to house the growing number of pilgrims visiting the Roman Catholic site of worship. The town rights were expanded and the town remapped by Jan Zebrzydowski in 1640, gaining the name Nowy Zebrzydów (New Zebrzydów). In 1715, the town suffered the effects of a large fire and was subsequently rebuilt by Józef Czartoryski, its owner. The Czartoryski family Palace was built in 1729–1731. In the 1980s, it was rebuilt and remastered into the current seminary. The Habsburg Austrian Empire annexed the town as part of its invasion of Poland during the First Partition of Poland in 1772. The Austrian administration changed the name to &quot;Kalwaria&quot;. In 1887, Jan Kanty Brandys became the owner of the town and at around 1890 the name Kalwaria Zebrzydowska was adopted. In 1896, the town lost its town rights due to a decision by the governing Austrian authorities. The construction of St. Joseph&#x27;s Church began in 1905. The town returned to Poland in 1919 with the end of World War I and the signing of the Treaty of Versailles by Roman Dmowski on behalf of the Polish Republic on 28 June 1919 in Paris. The town rights were restored in 1934 by a decision of the Polish government.

After World War II, the town&#x27;s economic development largely relied on the expansion of its furniture manufacturing and woodcraft industry, shoemaking, as well as a growing number of pilgrims to its religious complex.

Pope John Paul II made several visits to Kalwaria Zebrzydowska on the pilgrimages he made to his homeland Poland. It was at the monastery of Kalwaria Zebrzydowska that Pope John Paul II repeated the words of his motto:

&quot;Totus tuus ego sum, et omnia mea tua sunt. Accipio te in mea omnia. Praebe mihi cor tuum, Maria.&quot; (&quot;I belong entirely to you, and all that I have is yours. I take you for my all. O Mary, give me your heart&quot;).

According to his Apostolic Letter &quot;Rosarium Virginis Mariae&quot; he borrowed the motto from the Marian consecrating prayer found in the book &quot;True Devotion to Mary&quot; by Saint Louis de Montfort.

Pope John Paul II once recalled how as a young seminarian he &quot;read and reread many times and with great spiritual profit&quot; some writings of Saint Louis de Montfort and that:

:&quot;Then I understood that I could not exclude the Lord&#x27;s Mother from my life without neglecting the will of God-Trinity&quot;

In 1987, Henryk Górecki composed a choral piece &quot;(Totus Tuus Op. 60)&quot; to celebrate Pope John Paul II&#x27;s third pilgrimage to his native Poland that summer. While the motet opens with the same words as the apostolic motto, the piece actually uses a poem by Maria Boguslawska for its text.

<text>Wieliczka (German: &quot;Groß Salze&quot;, Latin: &quot;Magnum Sal&quot;) is a historic town in southern Poland, situated within the Kraków metropolitan area in Lesser Poland Voivodeship since 1999. The town was initially founded in 1290 by Premislaus II of Poland. Nowadays, it is mostly known for the Wieliczka Salt Mine, declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1978, and the historic old town core which was listed as one of National Polish Monuments in 1994. The population in 2023 was estimated at 27,845.

==Geographic location==
The city of Wieliczka lies in the south central part of Poland, within the Małopolska (Lesser Poland) province. The city is located to the southeast of Kraków and not far from the town of Niepołomice. The Wieliczka Salt Mine – one of the world&#x27;s oldest operating salt mines, has been established on significant salt deposits which are also present in nearby Bochnia.

The town lies in a valley between two ridges that stretch from west to east: south Wieliczka foothills, north Bogucice sands, including the Wieliczka-Gdów Upland. The south ridge is higher, while the northern ridge leads to national road 94. Near the town lies the A4 highway (E40 European route), which connects Kraków with Poland&#x27;s south western and south eastern regions. Despite the small area, the city&#x27;s relative altitude accounts for more than 137 –m–: the highest mountain reaches 361,8 metres above the sea, and the lowest point lies at an altitude of 224 metres above sea level.

== Culture ==

Wieliczka, as well as the nearby village of Lednica Górna are among the last places in Poland where the Easter tradition of Siuda Baba is still practised.

==History==

===Medieval times===
The first settlers were probably from the Celtic tribes. In later years they were driven out by the West Slavic or Lechitic clans. The importance of mining deposits arose after the capital of Poland was moved from Gniezno to Kraków by Casimir I the Restorer in the 11th century. However, further development of the mining practices was abruptly halted by the Mongol invasion, which destroyed Kraków and its surroundings in the 13th century. The area was subsequently populated with migrating Germans, who called the settlement &quot;Gross Salz&quot; (English: Grand/Great Salt) and from which the old Polish name &quot;Wielka Sól&quot; was derived. With time, the name evolved into Wieliczka, although the name Wielka Sól remained in official use, particularly in royal seals and documents.

After the 1252 discovery of large salt and potassium deposits across southern Poland, the extraction of salt began on a much broader scale. In the year 1289, Henryk IV Probus, then Lord of Kraków, issued a document authorising brothers Jescho and Isenbold to expand the town. Duke and future king Premislaus II granted Wieliczka town privileges in 1290.

===17th to 18th century===

In 1651, the population of Wieliczka was decimated by a plague. In the years 1655–1660, at the time of the Swedish Deluge, the city was in economic decline. The mine was plundered and burned by the Swedes and Swedish troops guarded the mine and the taxes were raised upon the locals. Gabriel Wojniłłowicz along with Jerzy Sebastian Lubomirski proceeded to organize approximately 3,000 people which took part in the liberation of Wieliczka, Bochnia and Wiśnicz. The battle took place in Kamionna, Lesser Poland Voivodeship, where the Poles emerged victorious.

===18th to 19th century===
After the First Partition of Poland in 1772, Wieliczka became part of the Austrian-led Habsburg monarchy. After the Polish victory in the Austro-Polish War of 1809, Wieliczka was regained by Poles and included within the short-lived Polish Duchy of Warsaw. The Habsburgs regained the city after the fall of the Duchy and its partition by the Congress of Vienna. The town then became part of the semi-autonomous province of Galicia. Under the multicultural Austrian Empire, many German, Hungarian, Croatian and Transylvanian miners settled in Wieliczka, thus changing the ethnic composition of the city. In 1828, Fryderyk Chopin visited the town. After the outbreak of the Kraków uprising in 1846, the rebellious miners seized power at the salt mines. With progressing industrialization, the town developed into a small city, which was now renowned for its salt production and output throughout the Empire.

===20th to 21st century===

Only by the end of the 19th century, the Galician authorities began investing in public housing. However, the city expanded with private investments, wealthy entrepreneurs built mining colonies (organized settlements for families of mine workers) and power plants (supplied electricity not only to the mine, but also to the town).

In the inter-war period, Wieliczka&#x27;s total population increased which encouraged territorial expansion; local villages were incorporated into town borders and new residential districts were erected in the 1920s to meet the demands of the growing population. However, the town also witnessed the 1933 miners&#x27; strike, which took place due to the reduction of wages by 13%.

During the first days of World War II, on 7 September 1939, the German Wehrmacht entered Wieliczka. They immediately began to persecute the Jewish population of around 1500, robbing and plundering. During the next two and a half years, they also brought to Wieliczka hundreds of Jews from other towns in the area, including from the Kraków Ghetto after the opening of a ghetto in the Klasno district. In total, as many as 11,000 Jews lived in the ghetto by the time of deportation in 1942. The town, especially the places Jews lived, became severely overcrowded and the population impoverished. In August 1942, all the Jewish population was rounded up. About 700 were taken to a nearby forest where they were shot. Others were killed in the town. Some 700 young men were taken to Pustkow and other forced labor camps. The rest were forced onto trains and sent to the killing camp at Belzec where they were murdered by gas on arrival. Very few Wieliczka Jews survived until liberation.

On 21 January 1945, the Soviet Red Army liberated Wieliczka from the Nazis. During the fighting, 138 Soviet soldiers were killed.

In 1994, the city was listed in the Register of Historic Monuments of Poland.

<text>Macau International Airport is an international airport in the special administrative region of Macau, situated at the eastern end of Taipa island and neighbouring waters. It opened for commercial operations on 9 November 1995, during Portuguese administration of the region.

Since its opening, the airport has been a common transfer point for people traveling between mainland China and Taiwan, as well as a passenger hub for destinations in mainland China and Southeast Asia. During 2006, the airport handled 5 million passengers and 220,000 tonnes of cargo. In 2017 the number of passengers had increased to 7,165,803, which is more than the 6 million passengers per year the terminal was originally designed for.

==History==
Before the opening of Macau airport, the nearest international airport was Kai Tak in British Hong Kong and passengers from Macau had to take a ferry to Hong Kong in order to fly out of Kai Tak. Upon planning, Macau airport was said that it would relieve the congestion at Kai Tak. The Macau airport was constructed on reclaimed land adjacent to the islands of Taipa and Coloane. It cost US$1 billion to build. Commercial air service began on 9 November 1995. The first departure was an Air Macau flight to Beijing, and the first arrival was a Malaysia Airlines flight from Kuala Lumpur. The official inauguration ceremony took place on 8 December 1995, and Portuguese president Mário Soares presided over it.

In April 1996, TAP Air Portugal started service to Lisbon using Airbus A340s. It cooperated with Sabena on the route; the flight stopped in Brussels, and TAP allocated a certain number of seats to the airline on the segment between Brussels and Macau. TAP encountered difficulties in running the flights. The crew had to spend long layovers in Macau because the service only operated twice a week. Additionally, TAP and Air Macau, in which the former held a stake, were unable to coordinate their schedules, making connections between the Lisbon flight and Air Macau&#x27;s network inconvenient. In April 1997, TAP moved the stopover to Bangkok in hopes of attracting more passengers. Nevertheless, it was losing money on the route. The company&#x27;s chairman stated in November 1997 that he wanted to end the link but that he faced opposition from the Portuguese government, which owned the airline. TAP stopped serving Macau the following year.

==Facilities==
===Terminal===
The airport&#x27;s designed capacity is 10,000,000 passengers per year, with processing capacity of up to 2,300 passengers per hour. The airport does not have a night curfew. There are 24 parking spaces for aircraft in the apron, with five jetways. There are 10 gates. As in Hong Kong, Macau has its own immigration policies and is a separate customs territory from mainland China. All travellers, including those to mainland China and Hong Kong, need to go through the immigration and customs inspections of international flights.

===Runway and aprons===
The airport&#x27;s runway was built on a strip of reclaimed land in the sea, adjacent to Taipa Island where the main terminal and air traffic control facilities are located, unlike in Hong Kong, where Chek Lap Kok has them all on a reclaimed island. The runway is connected to the apron by two causeways. Runway 34 is ILS CAT II equipped. Navigational and radio aids are located at either end of the runway. Despite its small area, the airport is capable of handling Boeing 747s and Antonov 124s, which forms a vital freight link between local manufacturers and overseas markets. Its catering facility can produce up to 10,000 meals per day.

===Other tenants===
Other tenants of the airport are the Macau Customs Service (independent department under Secretariat for Security of Macau), the Macau Immigration Department/Services (Public Security Police Force of Macau), the Macau Business Aviation Centre, Servair Macau and Menzies Macau.

==Redevelopment==
Since 2016, Macau&#x27;s government has been developing a master plan for the airport&#x27;s expansion. To be done in three phases, the most visible sections of it broke ground in 2020.

==Airlines and destinations==

== Statistics ==

===Annual traffic===
==Ground transportation==
The airport is connected by public transit bus routes, light rail, taxis, private cars, and regional coach services.

===Air–sea link===
For passengers transferring to China or Hong Kong, a &quot;two customs, one checkpoint&quot; service is provided. Passengers can use a bus shuttle directly from the airport to the New Macau Ferry Terminal or the Taipa Ferry Terminal without passing Macau immigration.

<doc id="153557" wikidata="Q144622" url="?curid=153557" title="Phil Collins">
<text>Philip David Charles Collins (born 30 January 1951) is an English musician, singer, songwriter, record producer and actor. He was the drummer and later became the lead singer of the rock band Genesis and had a successful solo career, achieving three UK number-one singles and seven US number-one singles as a solo artist. In total, his work with Genesis, other artists and solo resulted in more US top-40 singles than any other artist throughout the 1980s. His most successful singles from the period include &quot;In the Air Tonight&quot;, &quot;Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now)&quot;, &quot;One More Night&quot;, &quot;Sussudio&quot;, &quot;Another Day in Paradise&quot; and &quot;I Wish It Would Rain Down&quot;.

Born and raised in west London, Collins began playing drums at the age of five. During the same period he attended drama school, which helped secure various roles as a child actor. His first major role was the Artful Dodger in the West End production of the musical &quot;Oliver!&quot;. As an accomplished professional actor by his early teens, he pivoted to pursue a music career, becoming the drummer for Genesis in 1970. He took over the role of lead singer in 1975 following the departure of Peter Gabriel. During the second half of the 1970s, in between Genesis albums and tours, Collins was the drummer of jazz rock band Brand X. Collins began a successful solo career in the 1980s, initially inspired by his marital breakdown and love of soul music, releasing the albums &quot;Face Value&quot; (1981), &quot;Hello, I Must Be Going&quot; (1982), &quot;No Jacket Required&quot; (1985) and &quot;...But Seriously&quot; (1989). Collins became, in the words of AllMusic, &quot;one of the most successful pop and adult contemporary singers of the &#x27;80s and beyond&quot;. He became known for a distinctive gated reverb drum sound on many of his recordings. He played drums on the 1984 charity single &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; and, in July 1985, he was the only artist to perform at both Live Aid concerts. He resumed his acting career, appearing in &quot;Miami Vice&quot; and subsequently starring in the film &quot;Buster&quot; (1988).

Collins left Genesis in 1996 to focus on solo work; this included writing songs for Disney&#x27;s animated film &quot;Tarzan&quot; (1999), for which he wrote and performed the songs &quot;Two Worlds&quot;, &quot;Son of Man&quot;, &quot;Strangers Like Me&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;ll Be in My Heart&quot;, the last of which earned him the Academy Award for Best Original Song. He rejoined Genesis for their Turn It On Again Tour in 2007. Following a five-year retirement to focus on his family life, Collins released his memoir in 2016 and conducted the Not Dead Yet Tour from 2017 to 2019. He then rejoined Genesis in 2020 for a second and final reunion tour, which ran from 2021 to 2022.

Collins&#x27;s discography includes eight studio albums that have sold 33.5 million certified units in the US and an estimated 150 million records sold worldwide, making him one of the world&#x27;s best-selling artists. He is one of only three recording artists, along with Paul McCartney and Michael Jackson, who have sold over 100 million records both as solo artists and separately as principal members of a band. He has won eight Grammy Awards, six Brit Awards (winning Best British Male Artist three times), two Golden Globe Awards, one Academy Award and a Disney Legend Award. He was awarded six Ivor Novello Awards from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors, including the International Achievement Award. He received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1999 and was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2003 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Genesis in 2010. Ranked by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; at number 43 in the 100 Greatest Drummers of All Time, he was inducted into the &quot;Modern Drummer&quot; Hall of Fame in 2012 and the &quot;Classic Drummer&quot; Hall of Fame in 2013.

==Early life==
Philip David Charles Collins was born on 30 January 1951 at Putney Hospital in what was then the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth (now the London Borough of Wandsworth) in south-west London, England. His mother, Winifred June (, 1913–2011), worked in a toy shop and later as a booking agent at the Barbara Speake Stage School, an independent performing arts school in East Acton, while his father, Greville Philip Austin Collins (1907–1972), was an insurance agent for London Assurance. Collins is the youngest of three children; his sister, Carole, competed as a professional ice skater and followed her mother&#x27;s footsteps as a theatrical agent, while his brother, Clive, was a cartoonist. The family moved twice by the time Collins had reached the age of two; they settled at 453 Hanworth Road in what was then the Municipal Borough of Brentford and Chiswick.

Collins was given a toy drum kit for Christmas when he was five years old, and later his two uncles made him a makeshift set with triangles and tambourines that fitted into a suitcase. As he grew older, these were followed by more complete sets bought by his parents. Collins practised by playing along to music on the television and radio. During a family holiday at Butlin&#x27;s, a seven-year-old Collins entered a talent contest, singing &quot;The Ballad of Davy Crockett&quot;; he stopped the orchestra halfway through to tell them they were in the wrong key. The Beatles were a major early influence on him, including their drummer Ringo Starr. Collins followed the lesser-known London band the Action, whose drummer he would copy and whose work introduced him to the soul music of Motown and Stax Records. He was also influenced by the jazz and big band drummer Buddy Rich, whose opinion on the importance of the hi-hat prompted him to stop using two bass drums and start using the hi-hat.

At around the age of 12, Collins received basic piano and music tuition from his father&#x27;s aunt. He studied drum rudiments under Lloyd Ryan and later under Frank King, and considered this training &quot;more helpful than anything else because they&#x27;re used all the time. In any kind of funk or jazz drumming, the rudiments are always there.&quot; Collins never learned to read or write musical notation and devised his own system, which he regretted in later life. &quot;I&#x27;ve always felt that if I could hum it, I could play it. For me, that was good enough, but that attitude is bad.&quot;

Collins attended Nelson Primary School until he was 11 years old. Collins was accepted into Chiswick County Grammar School, where he took to football and formed the Real Thing, a school band that had Andrea Bertorelli, his future wife, and friend Lavinia Lang, as backup singers. Both women would have an impact on his personal life in later years. Collins&#x27;s next group was the Freehold, with whom he wrote his first song, &quot;Lying, Crying, Dying&quot;, and played in a group named the Charge. He was childhood friends with Jack Wild, who would become famous for playing the Artful Dodger in the film &quot;Oliver!&quot; (1968); the pair both attended the Barbara Speake Stage School after Collins&#x27;s mother spotted Wild as the two played football in the park.

==Career==
===1963–1970: Early acting roles and bands===

Collins quit school at fourteen to become a full-time pupil at Barbara Speake. He had an uncredited part as an extra in the Beatles&#x27; film &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; (1964), where he is among the screaming teenagers during the television concert sequence. Later in 1964, Collins was cast as the Artful Dodger in two West End runs of the musical &quot;Oliver!&quot; He was paid £15 a week, and called the role &quot;the best part for a kid in all London&quot;. His days as the Dodger were numbered when his voice broke during a performance and had to speak his lines for the rest of the show. Collins starred in &quot;Calamity the Cow&quot; (1967), a film produced by the Children&#x27;s Film Foundation. After a falling out with the director, Collins decided to quit acting to pursue music. He was to appear in &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot; (1968) as one of the children who storm the castle, but his scene was cut. Collins auditioned for the role of Romeo in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; (1968), but the role went to Leonard Whiting. In 1967, he travelled the UK teaching people the &quot;crunch&quot; dance made popular by a Smith&#x27;s crisps advertising campaign.

Collins&#x27;s enthusiasm for music grew during his acting years. He frequented the Marquee Club on Wardour Street so often that eventually the managers asked him to set out the chairs, sweep the floors, and assist in the cloakroom. It was here where Collins saw The Action and newcomers Yes perform, which greatly influenced him. When auditions for Vinegar Joe and Manfred Mann Chapter Three were unsuccessful, Collins secured a position in the Cliff Charles Blues Band and toured the country. This was followed by a stint in The Gladiators, a backing band for a black vocal quartet, which included Collins&#x27;s schoolmate Ronnie Caryl on guitar. Around this time, Collins learned that Yes were looking for a new drummer and spoke to frontman Jon Anderson, who invited him to an audition the following week. Collins failed to turn up.

In 1969, Collins and Caryl joined John Walker&#x27;s backing band for a European tour, which included guitarist Gordon Smith and keyboardist Brian Chatton. The tour finished, and the quartet formed a rock band, Hickory, which recorded one single (&quot;Green Light&quot;/&quot;The Key&quot;). Still in 1969, they were renamed Flaming Youth. They signed to Fontana Records and recorded &quot;Ark 2&quot; (1969), a concept album written and produced by Ken Howard and Alan Blaikley that tells the story of man&#x27;s evacuation from a burning Earth and its voyage into space. Each member sings a lead vocal.

In May 1970, after Flaming Youth split, Collins played congas on George Harrison&#x27;s song &quot;Art of Dying&quot;, but his contribution was omitted. Years later, Collins asked Harrison about the omission. Harrison sent Collins a recording allegedly containing Collins&#x27;s performance; Collins was embarrassed to hear that the performance was poor. When Collins apologised, Harrison confessed that the recording was a prank, which Collins accepted in good humour.

===1970–1978: Genesis, later role as lead singer, and Brand X===
In July 1970, the rock band Genesis had signed with Charisma Records and recorded their second album &quot;Trespass&quot; (1970), but suffered a setback following the departure of guitarist Anthony Phillips. They decided that their drummer John Mayhew, though talented, was not of the high calibre they wanted, and placed an advert in the &quot;Melody Maker&quot; for a drummer &quot;sensitive to acoustic music&quot; and a 12-string acoustic guitarist. Collins recognised Charisma owner Tony Stratton Smith&#x27;s name on it, who he had been acquainted with for years, and he and Caryl went for the auditions. The group, who had been a full-time working band for less than a year, consisted of school friends from Charterhouse School, a private boarding school: singer Peter Gabriel, keyboardist Tony Banks, and bassist/guitarist Mike Rutherford. Collins and Caryl arrived early, so Collins took a swim in the pool at Gabriel&#x27;s parents&#x27; house and memorised the pieces the drummers before him were playing. He recalled: &quot;They put on &#x27;Trespass&#x27;, and my initial impression was of a very soft and round music, not edgy, with vocal harmonies, and I came away thinking Crosby, Stills and Nash.&quot; Gabriel, a former drummer, said he could tell just by the way Collins sat in front of the drum kit that he knew what he was doing, and was also impressed when Collins mentioned the session with George Harrison. On 8 August 1970, Collins became their fourth drummer. Genesis then took a two-week holiday, during which Collins earned money as an exterior decorator. Rutherford thought Caryl was not a good fit, and for over a month Genesis wrote songs, rehearsed, and toured as a four-piece. In January 1971, the band enlisted Steve Hackett.
From 1970 to 1975, Collins played drums, percussion, and backing vocals on Genesis albums and concerts. Rutherford commented that &quot;on drums Phil was immediately a huge lift. We had never had that kind of energy from the engine room before; it was just a whole different level.&quot; Rutherford and Banks continued to contribute vocal harmonies to songs like &quot;Harlequinn&quot;, but before long Collins became the group&#x27;s primary backing vocalist, since they found multi-tracking Collins and Gabriel&#x27;s vocals was faster and produced better results than all four of them singing. They also discovered that Collins and Gabriel&#x27;s singing voices were so similar that when they sang a part together, it sounded like one exceptionally strong voice rather than two voices. This technique was employed on the band&#x27;s first hit single, &quot;I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)&quot;.

During this period Collins participated in the songwriting jams which produced much of Genesis&#x27;s material, but did little independent songwriting compared to the other four members. Collins&#x27;s more notable songwriting contributions during 1970-75 include composing the staccato rhythm which acts as the main theme of the live favourite &quot;Watcher of the Skies&quot;. His first album as a member, &quot;Nursery Cryme&quot;, features the acoustic song &quot;For Absent Friends&quot; that has Collins singing lead vocal. He sang &quot;More Fool Me&quot; on their 1973 album &quot;Selling England by the Pound&quot; and on the subsequent tour, marking the first time he assumed the role of Genesis lead vocalist in a live setting. In 1974, Collins played drums on Brian Eno&#x27;s second album &quot;Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy)&quot; after Eno had contributed electronic effects to two songs on &quot;The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway&quot;.

In August 1975, Gabriel&#x27;s departure from the band was publicly announced. Genesis advertised for a replacement in &quot;Melody Maker&quot; and received around 400 replies. After a lengthy auditioning process, during which he sang backup vocals for applicants, Collins became the band&#x27;s lead vocalist during the recording of their album &quot;A Trick of the Tail&quot;. The album was a commercial and critical success, reaching number 3 in the UK charts and 31 in the US. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote that Genesis &quot;has managed to turn the possible catastrophe of Gabriel&#x27;s departure into their first broad-based American success.&quot; For the tour, former Yes and King Crimson drummer Bill Bruford played drums on sections where Collins sang. In 1976, Collins brought in American drummer Chester Thompson, formerly of Frank Zappa and Weather Report, who became a mainstay of Genesis&#x27;s and Collins&#x27;s backing bands until 2010. When Collins, Banks, and Rutherford decided to continue Genesis as a trio in 1977, they recorded &quot;...And Then There Were Three...&quot;. This included the band&#x27;s first UK Top 10 and US Top 40 single, &quot;Follow You Follow Me&quot;. The level of commercial success that Genesis had reached by this time allowed Collins and his wife to move into Old Croft, a home in Shalford, Surrey, in the spring of 1978.

Collins pursued various guest spots and solo projects from his time as Genesis&#x27;s drummer. In 1973, he and Hackett performed on the solo debut of ex-Yes guitarist Peter Banks. In 1975, Collins sang and played drums, vibraphone, and percussion on Hackett&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;Voyage of the Acolyte&quot;; performed on Eno&#x27;s albums &quot;Another Green World&quot;, &quot;Before and After Science&quot;, and &quot;Music for Films&quot;; and replaced drummer Phil Spinelli of the jazz fusion group Brand X before recording their first two albums, &quot;Unorthodox Behaviour&quot; and &quot;Moroccan Roll&quot;. Collins played percussion on &quot;Johnny the Fox&quot; by Thin Lizzy, and sang on Anthony Phillips&#x27; debut solo album, &quot;The Geese &amp; the Ghost&quot;.

===1978–1984: Solo debut with &quot;Face Value&quot; and &quot;Hello, I Must Be Going!&quot;===
After Genesis finished touring in December 1978, the group went on hiatus after Collins went to Vancouver, Canada to try to save his failing marriage. The attempt failed, leaving his wife to return to England with their children while living apart. Collins returned to Old Croft, their home in Shalford, Surrey, and their divorce was finalised in 1981. Banks and Rutherford were recording their first solo albums during this time, so Collins rejoined Brand X for their album &quot;Product&quot; and its accompanying tour, played on John Martyn&#x27;s album &quot;Grace and Danger&quot;, and started writing demos of his own at home. This was followed by Genesis resuming activity and recording and touring through 1980 with their album &quot;Duke&quot; (1980). The three members contributed two tracks each; Collins put forward &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Ask&quot; and &quot;Misunderstanding&quot;.
In February 1981, Collins released his debut solo album &quot;Face Value&quot;. He signed with Virgin Records and WEA for American distribution in order to distance himself from the Charisma label, and oversaw every step of its production; he wrote the liner notes himself and by hand. His divorce was the focus of its lyrical themes and song titles: &quot;I had a wife, two children, two dogs, and the next day I didn&#x27;t have anything. So a lot of these songs were written because I was going through these emotional changes.&quot; Collins produced the album in collaboration with Hugh Padgham, with whom he had worked on Peter Gabriel&#x27;s self-titled 1980 album. &quot;Face Value&quot; reached number one in seven countries, including the UK Albums Chart, and number seven in the US where it went on to sell 5 million copies. &quot;In the Air Tonight&quot;, the album&#x27;s lead single, became a hit and reached number two in the UK charts. The song is known for the gated reverb effect used on Collins&#x27;s drums, a technique developed by Padgham when he worked as an engineer on Gabriel&#x27;s song &quot;Intruder&quot;, on which Collins played drums.

Following an invitation by record producer Martin Lewis, Collins performed live as a solo artist at an Amnesty International benefit show The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Other Ball at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in London in September 1981, performing &quot;In the Air Tonight&quot; and &quot;The Roof Is Leaking&quot;. Collins worked again with John Martyn in this year, producing his album &quot;Glorious Fool&quot;. In September 1981, Genesis released &quot;Abacab&quot;. This was followed by its 1981 supporting tour and a two-month tour in 1982 promoting the Genesis live album &quot;Three Sides Live&quot;. In early 1982, Collins produced and played on &quot;Something&#x27;s Going On&quot;, the third solo album by Anni-Frid Lyngstad of ABBA, and performed most of the drum parts on &quot;Pictures at Eleven&quot;, the first solo album by Led Zeppelin singer Robert Plant. In October 1982, Collins took part in the one-off Genesis reunion concert Six of the Best held at the Milton Keynes Bowl in Buckinghamshire, which marked the return of Gabriel on lead vocals and Hackett on guitar.

Collins&#x27;s second solo album, &quot;Hello, I Must Be Going!&quot;, was released in November 1982. His marital problems continued to provide inspiration for his songs, including &quot;I Don&#x27;t Care Anymore&quot; and &quot;Do You Know, Do You Care&quot;. The album reached number 2 in the UK and number 8 in the US, where it sold 3 million copies. Its second single, a cover of &quot;You Can&#x27;t Hurry Love&quot; by the Supremes, became Collins&#x27;s first UK number one single and went to number 10 in the US. Collins supported the album with the &quot;Hello, I Must Be Going!&quot; tour of Europe and North America from November 1982 to February 1983. Following the tour, Collins played drums on Plant&#x27;s second solo album, &quot;The Principle of Moments&quot;, and produced and played on two tracks for Adam Ant&#x27;s album &quot;Strip&quot;, &quot;Puss &#x27;n Boots&quot; and the title track. In May 1983, Collins, Banks and Rutherford recorded a self-titled Genesis album; its tour ended with five shows in Birmingham, England in February 1984. The latter shows were filmed and released as &quot;Genesis Live – The Mama Tour&quot;.

===1984–1989: &quot;No Jacket Required&quot; and commercial ubiquity===

Collins wrote and performed on &quot;Against All Odds&quot;, the main theme for the romantic film of the same name, which demonstrated a more pop-orientated and commercially accessible sound than his previous work. Released in February 1984, it was the first single of his solo career to reach number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart; it peaked at number two in the UK. Collins won a Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Performance, Male. The song earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song, and he arranged his 1985 tour to accommodate the possibility of performing it at the awards ceremony. However, a note to Atlantic Records from show producer Larry Gelbart explaining a lack of invitation stated: &quot;Thank you for your note regarding Phil Cooper [sic]. I&#x27;m afraid the spots have already been filled&quot;, and Collins watched actress and dancer Ann Reinking perform it. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said: &quot;Reinking did an incredible job of totally destroying a beautiful song.&quot; Collins would introduce it at subsequent concerts by saying: &quot;I&#x27;m sorry Miss Ann Reinking couldn&#x27;t be here tonight; I guess I just have to sing my own song.&quot;

In 1984, Collins contributed to the production on &quot;Chinese Wall&quot; by Earth, Wind &amp; Fire vocalist Philip Bailey, which included a duet from the two, &quot;Easy Lover&quot;. The song was number one in the UK for four weeks, and peaked at number 2 in the US. He produced and played drums on several tracks on &quot;Behind the Sun&quot; by Eric Clapton. In November, Collins was part of the charity supergroup Band Aid in aid of Ethiopian famine relief and played drums on its single, &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot;.

Collins&#x27;s third album, &quot;No Jacket Required&quot;, was recorded in 1984 and marked a turning point in his output. He departed from lyrics about his personal life and wrote more upbeat and dance-orientated songs with strong hooks and melodies, with Collins stating beforehand, &quot;I have a notion of what I want to do: break out of this &#x27;love song&#x27; box that I&#x27;ve found myself in. I&#x27;ll make a dance album. Or, at least, an album with a couple of uptempo tracks.&quot; Sting, Peter Gabriel, and Helen Terry contributed backing vocals. &quot;No Jacket Required&quot; was released in February 1985 and became a huge worldwide success, reaching number one in several countries. &quot;Sussudio&quot; and &quot;One More Night&quot;, topped the US singles chart, the latter reaching number 4 in the UK to become his fourth solo UK top ten, and &quot;Don&#x27;t Lose My Number&quot; and &quot;Take Me Home&quot; made the US top ten. The album remains the most successful of his career, selling over 12 million copies in the US where it was certified diamond, and 1.9 million in the UK where it was the second-best-selling album of 1985.

Referring to the album&#x27;s success, David Fricke of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote: &quot;After years on the art-rock fringe, Collins has established himself firmly in the middle of the road. Perhaps he should consider testing himself and his new fans&#x27; expectations next time around.&quot; &quot;Sussudio&quot; attracted negative attention for sounding too similar to Prince&#x27;s &quot;1999&quot;, a charge that Collins did not deny. &quot;No Jacket Required&quot; earned Collins the first two of his six Brit Awards, winning Best British Male and Best British Album. Collins had three US number one songs in 1985, the most by any artist that year. &quot;No Jacket Required&quot; won three Grammy Awards including Album of the Year.
The No Jacket Required World Tour saw Collins perform 85 shows between February and July 1985. On 13 July, Collins took part in the Live Aid concerts, a continuation of the fundraising effort started by Band Aid. Collins was the only performer to appear at the London concert at Wembley Stadium and the US concert at JFK Stadium in Philadelphia on the same day. After performing what &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; called &quot;an especially crowd-pleasing selection of songs&quot; in London, including &quot;Against All Odds&quot;, &quot;In the Air Tonight&quot;, and playing alongside Sting, Collins flew to Philadelphia on a Concorde to perform his solo material, play drums for Clapton, and drum with Plant and Jimmy Page for a Led Zeppelin reunion. The latter performance was poorly received and later disowned by the band. Page later said that Collins had not learned his parts for the set. Collins responded that the band &quot;weren&#x27;t very good&quot;, that a &quot;dribbling&quot; Page had made him feel uncomfortable, and he only continued with the set rather than leave the stage in order to avoid negative attention. In November 1985, the song &quot;Separate Lives&quot;, a duet featuring Collins and Marilyn Martin for the musical drama film &quot;White Nights&quot;, was released and became a US number one hit.
By the end of 1985, the music press noted that Collins&#x27;s astronomical success as a solo artist had made him more popular than Genesis. Before the release of &quot;No Jacket Required&quot;, Collins insisted that he would not leave the band and that he felt &quot;happier with what we&#x27;re doing now, because I feel it&#x27;s closer to me.&quot; In October 1985, he reunited with Banks and Rutherford to record Genesis&#x27;s thirteenth album, &quot;Invisible Touch&quot;. Released in 1986, it became the group&#x27;s biggest selling album with 6 million copies sold in the US, and 1.2 million sold in the UK. Its title track was released as a single and reached No. 1 in the US, the only Genesis song to do so. The group received a Grammy Award (their only one) and a nomination for the MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year in 1987 for &quot;Land of Confusion&quot;, which features puppet caricatures from the satirical television programme &quot;Spitting Image&quot;. Several music critics drew comparisons between the album and Collins&#x27;s solo work, but &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s J. D. Considine praised the album&#x27;s commercial appeal, stating, &quot;every tune is carefully pruned so that each flourish delivers not an instrumental epiphany but a solid hook&quot;. March 1986 saw the release of &quot;No One Is to Blame&quot;, a hit single by Howard Jones which included Collins on drums, backing vocals, and co-production alongside Padgham. Collins provided backing vocals, produced and played drums on most of Eric Clapton&#x27;s 1986 album &quot;August&quot;. He toured parts of Europe with Clapton in support of the album, of which two concert videos were released; Live at Montreux 1986 and Eric Clapton and Friends Live 1986. In each of those videos, Collins is featured as the drummer and performs &quot;In the Air Tonight&quot; with Clapton, bassist Nathan East and keyboardist Greg Phillinganes backing him.

After touring with Genesis in 1987, Collins was aware that his music had gained too much exposure and took a year off from writing and recording. He took on his first acting role since the late 1960s, starring as Buster Edwards opposite Julie Walters (who played his wife, June) in the romantic comedy drama-crime film &quot;Buster&quot; which centred around the Great Train Robbery from 1963 in Ledburn, Buckinghamshire. Reviews for the film were mixed and controversy ensued over its subject matter; Prince Charles and Princess Diana declined an invitation to the première after it was accused of glorifying crime. Collins contributed four songs to the film&#x27;s soundtrack; his ballad rendition of &quot;A Groovy Kind of Love&quot;, originally by the Mindbenders, became his only single to reach No. 1 in the UK and the US. The film spawned the US #1 single &quot;Two Hearts&quot;, which he co-wrote with Lamont Dozier and won the pair a Golden Globe for Best Original Song and an Oscar nomination in the same category. Film critic Roger Ebert said Collins &quot;played [the role of Buster] with surprising effectiveness&quot;. In 1988, Collins was the subject of an episode of the British TV series &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;. In 1989, Collins was among the musicians who donated their own clothes to Madame Tussaud&#x27;s Rock Circus, an exhibition held at the London Pavilion celebrating the history of rock and pop music featuring its major figures recreated in wax.

===1989–1996: &quot;...But Seriously&quot;, &quot;Both Sides&quot;, and leaving Genesis===

In August 1989, Collins appeared as a special guest for the Who on their 1989 tour for two shows, performing &quot;Fiddle About&quot; as Uncle Ernie and &quot;Tommy&#x27;s Holiday Camp&quot; from their rock opera &quot;Tommy&quot; (1969).

From April to October 1989, Collins recorded his fourth album &quot;...But Seriously&quot; in England and the United States, which saw him address social and political themes in his lyrics. The album was released in November 1989 to worldwide commercial success, spending fifteen weeks at No. 1 in the UK charts and in the US for three. It became the UK&#x27;s best-selling album of 1990 and is among the best-selling albums in UK chart history. It is one of the best-selling albums in Germany. Its lead single &quot;Another Day in Paradise&quot; is an anti-homelessness song and features David Crosby singing backing vocals. Upon its release in October 1989, it went to No. 1 in the US to become the final number one single there of the 1980s. Despite its success, the song was heavily criticised and became linked to allegations of hypocrisy made against Collins. Responding to criticism of the song, Collins stated: &quot;When I drive down the street, I see the same things everyone else sees. It&#x27;s a misconception that if you have a lot of money you&#x27;re somehow out of touch with reality.&quot; In 1991, &quot;Another Day in Paradise&quot; won the Grammy Award for Record of the Year. Other songs from &quot;...But Seriously&quot; reached the top-five in the US: &quot;Something Happened on the Way to Heaven&quot;, &quot;Do You Remember?&quot;, and &quot;I Wish It Would Rain Down&quot; featuring Eric Clapton on guitar.

&quot;...But Seriously&quot; was supported with the Seriously, Live! World Tour which ran between February and October 1990 and covered 121 dates. The tour spawned the live album &quot;Serious Hits... Live!&quot;, which sold 1.2 million copies in the UK and over 4 million in the US. In February 1990, Collins performed &quot;Another Day in Paradise&quot; at the 1990 Brit Awards which won British Single of the Year, and in September he performed &quot;Sussudio&quot; at the 1990 MTV Video Music Awards in Los Angeles. He also played drums on the 1989 Tears for Fears single, &quot;Woman in Chains&quot;.

In 1991, Collins reconvened with Banks and Rutherford to write and record a new Genesis album, &quot;We Can&#x27;t Dance&quot;. It became the band&#x27;s fifth consecutive No. 1 album in the UK and reached No. 4 in the US, where it sold over 4 million copies. It features the singles &quot;Jesus He Knows Me&quot;, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Dance&quot;, &quot;No Son of Mine&quot;, and &quot;Hold on My Heart&quot;. Collins performed on their 1992 tour. At the 1993 American Music Awards, Genesis won the award for Favorite Pop/Rock Band, Duo, or Group. Collins co-wrote, sang and played on the 1993 single &quot;Hero&quot; by David Crosby.

Collins worked on his fifth studio album, &quot;Both Sides&quot;, in 1992 and 1993. It marked a departure from his more polished and up-tempo songs on recent albums to material more experimental in nature, with Collins performing all the instruments and producing the record himself, because the songs written &quot;were becoming so personal, so private, I didn&#x27;t want anyone else&#x27;s input&quot;. The decline of his second marriage was a focal point of the album. Released in November 1993, &quot;Both Sides&quot; reached No. 1 in eight countries, including the UK, and No. 13 in the US. It marked a drop in sales in the latter when compared to his previous records, only reaching a single platinum certification by the end of the year. Its two biggest singles were &quot;Both Sides of the Story&quot; and &quot;Everyday&quot;. The Both Sides of the World Tour saw Collins perform 165 shows across four legs between April 1994 and May 1995. Collins turned down the chance to contribute to &quot;Tower of Song: The Songs of Leonard Cohen&quot;, an album of covers of Leonard Cohen songs, due to his touring commitments. On 29 March 1996, Collins&#x27;s decision to leave Genesis to concentrate on his solo career was publicly announced.

===1996–2006: Phil Collins Big Band, &quot;Dance into the Light&quot;, Disney work, and &quot;Testify&quot;===

In the months surrounding his departure from Genesis, Collins formed the Phil Collins Big Band, seating himself on the drums. He had wanted to undertake the project for some time and felt inspired from the &quot;Burning for Buddy&quot; project that drummer Neil Peart had put together. Having moved to Switzerland, an invitation to perform at the Montreux Jazz Festival led to the band to come together, which featured Quincy Jones as conductor and Tony Bennett on vocals. The group toured summer jazz festivals in July 1996 with a set of jazz renditions of Genesis and Collins&#x27;s solo material. Their first date was at the Royal Albert Hall for a Prince&#x27;s Trust concert with Queen Elizabeth II and Nelson Mandela in attendance. To learn his parts, Collins devised his own notation on sheets. The band then went on hiatus until a US and European tour in the summer of 1998, which spawned the live album &quot;A Hot Night in Paris&quot;.

In October 1996, Collins released his sixth solo album, &quot;Dance into the Light&quot;. It reached No. 4 in the UK and No. 23 in the US. The album was received negatively by the music press and sold less than his previous albums. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; reviewed by saying that &quot;even Phil Collins must know that we all grew weary of Phil Collins&quot;. Singles from the album included &quot;Dance into the Light&quot;, which reached No. 9 in the UK, and the Beatles-inspired &quot;It&#x27;s in Your Eyes&quot;. The album was certified Gold in the US. Collins toured the album throughout 1997 with his Trip into the Light World Tour, covering 82 dates. He performed &quot;In the Air Tonight&quot; and &quot;Take Me Home&quot; at the Music for Montserrat benefit concert in London alongside Paul McCartney, Elton John, Eric Clapton, Mark Knopfler, and Sting.

In October 1998, Collins released his first compilation album &quot;...Hits&quot; which contains a new track, a cover of &quot;True Colors&quot; by Cyndi Lauper that was produced by Kenneth &quot;Babyface&quot; Edmonds. The album was a commercial success worldwide, reaching No. 1 in the UK charts and selling 3.4 million copies in the US by 2012.
In the mid-1990s Collins was recruited to write and perform songs for Disney&#x27;s adventure film &quot;Tarzan&quot; (1999), integrated with a score by Mark Mancina. Collins also sang his songs in French, Italian, German, and Spanish for the dubbed versions of the film&#x27;s soundtrack. His song &quot;You&#x27;ll Be in My Heart&quot; was released in June 1999 and spent 19 weeks at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Contemporary chart, the longest time ever up to that point. In 2000, the song won Collins an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award, both for Best Original Song. He performed &quot;Two Worlds&quot; at that year&#x27;s ceremony and the Disney-themed Super Bowl halftime show.

In June 1999, Collins was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 2000, he became partially deaf in one ear due to a viral infection. In June 2002, Collins accepted an invitation to drum for the house band at the Party at the Palace concert held on the grounds of Buckingham Palace, an event which celebrated Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s Golden Jubilee. In 2002, he received the Disney Legend award.

On 11 November 2002, Collins released his seventh solo album, &quot;Testify&quot;. Metacritic&#x27;s roundup of album reviews found this record to be the worst-reviewed album at the time of its release, though it has since been surpassed by three more recent releases. The album&#x27;s single &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop Loving You&quot; (a Leo Sayer cover) was a number-one Adult Contemporary hit. &quot;Testify&quot; sold 140,000 copies in the US by year&#x27;s end.

Disney hired Collins to compose and perform on the soundtrack to its 2003 animated feature &quot;Brother Bear&quot;, which included the song &quot;Look Through My Eyes&quot;. In the same year he was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In 2004, Collins released two compilation albums, &quot;The Platinum Collection&quot; and &quot;Love Songs&quot;. From June 2004 to November 2005, Collins performed his First Final Farewell Tour, a reference to the multiple farewell tours of other popular artists. In 2006, he worked with Disney on a musical production of &quot;Tarzan&quot;.

===2006–2015: First Genesis reunion, &quot;Going Back&quot;, and retirement===

Collins reunited with Banks and Rutherford and announced Turn It On Again: The Tour on 7 November 2006, nearly 40 years after the band first formed. The tour took place during summer 2007, and played in twelve countries across Europe, followed by a second leg in North America. During the tour Genesis performed at the Live Earth concert at Wembley Stadium, London. In 2007 they were honoured at the second annual VH1 Rock Honors, performing &quot;Turn It On Again&quot;, &quot;No Son of Mine&quot; and &quot;Los Endos&quot; at the ceremony in Las Vegas. On 22 May 2008, Collins received his sixth Ivor Novello Award from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors when he was presented the International Achievement Award at a ceremony held at the Grosvenor House Hotel, London.

In October 2009, it was reported that Collins was to record a Motown covers album. He told a German newspaper, &quot;I want the songs to sound exactly like the originals&quot;, and that the album would feature up to 30 songs. In January 2010, Chester Thompson said that the album had been completed and would be released some time soon. He also revealed that Collins managed to play the drums on the album despite a spinal operation. The resulting album, &quot;Going Back&quot;, was released on 13 September 2010. It reached number one on the UK Albums Chart. In summer 2010, Collins played six concerts with the music from &quot;Going Back&quot;. These included a special programme, &quot;Phil Collins: One Night Only&quot;, aired on ITV1 on 18 September 2010. Collins also promoted &quot;Going Back&quot; with his first and only appearance on the BBC&#x27;s music series &quot;Later... with Jools Holland&quot;, broadcast on 17 September 2010.

In March 2010, Collins was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Genesis at a ceremony in New York City. As of January 2011, Collins has spent 1,730 weeks in the German music charts—766 weeks of them with Genesis albums and singles and 964 weeks with solo releases. On 4 March 2011, citing health problems and other concerns, Collins announced that he was taking time off from his career, prompting widespread reports of his retirement. On 7 March his UK representative told the press, &quot;He is not, has no intention of, retiring.&quot; Later that day, Collins posted a message to his fans on his own website, confirming his intention to retire to focus on his family life. In July 2012, Collins&#x27;s greatest hits collection &quot;...Hits&quot; re-entered the US charts, reaching No. 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

In November 2013, Collins told German media that he was considering a return to music and speculated that this could mean further live shows with Genesis, stating: &quot;Everything is possible. We could tour in Australia and South America. We haven&#x27;t been there yet.&quot; Speaking to reporters in Miami, Florida in December 2013 at an event promoting his charity work, Collins indicated that he was writing music once again and might tour again.

On 24 January 2014, Collins announced in an interview with &quot;Inside South Florida&quot; that he was writing new compositions with fellow English singer Adele. Collins said he had no idea who Adele was when he learned she wanted to collaborate with him. He said &quot;I wasn&#x27;t actually too aware [of her]. I live in a cave.&quot; Collins agreed to join her in the studio after hearing her voice. He said, &quot;[She] achieved an incredible amount. I really love her voice. I love some of this stuff she&#x27;s done, too.&quot; In September 2014, Collins revealed that the collaboration had ended and he said it had been &quot;a bit of a non-starter&quot;. In May 2014, Collins gave a live performance of &quot;In the Air Tonight&quot; and &quot;Land of Confusion&quot; with young student musicians at the Miami Country Day School in Miami, Florida. Collins was asked to perform there by his sons, who were students at the school. In August 2014, Collins was reported to have accepted an invitation to perform in December at a benefit concert in Miami in aid of his Little Dreams Foundation charity. He ultimately missed the concert due to illness.

===2015–present: Out of retirement, Not Dead Yet Tour, second Genesis reunion, and possible new music===

In May 2015, Collins signed a deal with Warner Music Group to have his solo albums remastered and reissued with previously unreleased material. In October of that year, he announced that he was no longer retired and had started plans to tour and make a new album. By mid-2016, all eight of his albums were reissued with the artwork updated to display Collins as his older self; the exception being &quot;Going Back&quot;, which had a new cover. In 2019, the additional digital only releases &quot;Other Sides&quot; and &quot;Remixed Sides&quot; followed.

In October 2016, Collins&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Not Dead Yet&quot; was published. At a press conference held at the Royal Albert Hall in the same month, Collins announced his Not Dead Yet Tour which initially took form as a short European trek from June 2017. The tour included five nights at the Royal Albert Hall which sold out in fifteen seconds, prompting the announcement of Collins&#x27;s headline spot at the 2017 BST Hyde Park festival which became his largest solo concert. His band included his son Nicolas on the drums. A review in &quot;The Telegraph&quot; stated: &quot;Unlike the body, the voice is largely unravaged by time. It&#x27;s still soulful, sometimes silky, occasionally bruised.&quot; In 2017, the tour was extended worldwide and ran until October 2019 for a total of 97 shows.

In March 2020, Collins, Banks, and Rutherford announced they had reformed Genesis once more to undertake The Last Domino? Tour. This time the band were joined by Collins&#x27;s son Nic on the drums, leaving his father to handle lead vocals. After the tour was rescheduled twice due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it began in September 2021 and finished in London on 26 March 2022. At the last show, at The O2 Arena in London, Collins said on stage: &quot;It&#x27;s the last show for Genesis&quot;.

On 20 August 2024, it was revealed by music executive Simon Napier-Bell that Collins was updating his home studio by Lake Geneva, with new music possibly in the works.

==Drumming and influence==
In his book on the &quot;legends&quot; who defined progressive rock drumming, American drummer Rich Lackowski wrote: &quot;Phil Collins&#x27;s grooves in early Genesis recordings paved the way for many talented drummers to come. His ability to make the drums bark with musicality and to communicate so convincingly in odd time signatures left many a drummer tossing on the headphones and playing along to Phil&#x27;s lead.&quot; In 2014, readers of &quot;Rhythm&quot; voted Collins the fourth most influential progressive rock drummer for his work on the 1974 Genesis album &quot;The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway&quot;. In 2015, MusicRadar named Collins one of the six pioneers of progressive rock drumming. In 2005, Planet Rock listeners voted Collins the fifth greatest rock drummer in history. Collins was ranked tenth in &quot;The Greatest Drummers of All Time&quot; list by &quot;Gigwise&quot; and number nine in a list of &quot;The 20 greatest drummers of the last 25 years&quot; by MusicRadar in 2010. In 1987, Collins looked back at his fast playing in Brand X and early Genesis: &quot;I actually can&#x27;t play like that anymore&quot;.

Foo Fighters drummer Taylor Hawkins cited Collins as one of his drumming heroes. He said, &quot;Collins is an incredible drummer. Anyone who wants to be good on the drums should check him out – the man is a master.&quot; In the April 2001 issue of &quot;Modern Drummer&quot;, Dream Theater drummer Mike Portnoy named Collins in an interview when asked about drummers he was influenced by and had respect for. In another conversation in 2014, Portnoy lauded his &quot;amazing progressive drumming&quot; back in the early and mid-1970s. Rush drummer Neil Peart praised his &quot;beautiful drumming&quot; and &quot;lovely sound&quot; on the 1973 Genesis album &quot;Selling England by the Pound&quot;, which he called &quot;an enduring masterpiece of drumming&quot;. Marco Minnemann, drummer for artists including Joe Satriani and Steven Wilson, described Collins as &quot;brilliant&quot; for the way &quot;he composes his parts, and the sounds he gets&quot;. He said, &quot;Phil is almost like John Bonham to me. I hear his personality, his perspective.&quot; He singled out the drumming on &quot;In the Air Tonight&quot; as an example of &quot;ten notes that everybody knows&quot; and concluded &quot;Phil is [an] insanely talented drummer.&quot;

Other drummers who have cited him as an influence or expressed admiration for his drumming work are Brann Dailor of Mastodon, Nick D&#x27;Virgilio of Spock&#x27;s Beard and Big Big Train, Jimmy Keegan of Spock&#x27;s Beard, Matt Mingus of Dance Gavin Dance, John Merryman of Cephalic Carnage, Craig Blundell of Steven Wilson and Frost*, and Charlie Benante of Anthrax. According to Jason Bonham, his father &quot;respected Phil Collins&#x27; drumming very much&quot; and one of his favourite songs was Genesis&#x27;s &quot;Turn It On Again&quot;, which he used to love playing with him.

&quot;Modern Drummer&quot; readers voted for Collins every year between 1987 and 1991 as Pop/Mainstream Rock drummer of the year. In 2000, he was voted as Big Band drummer of the year. In 2012, he was inducted into the Hall of Fame.

===Equipment===

Collins is a left-handed drummer, and uses Gretsch drums, Noble &amp; Cooley solid snare drums, Remo heads, Sabian cymbals and his signature Promark sticks. Past kits he used were made by Pearl and Premier.

Other instruments associated with Collins&#x27;s sound (particularly in his post-1978 Genesis and solo career) include the Roland TR-808, Roland TR-909, the Simmons SDS-V electronic drum set, and the LinnDrum drum machines. Collins also used a Roland CR-78, Sequential Circuits Prophet-5 synthesizer, the Fender Rhodes and Yamaha CP-70 electric pianos, and a vocoder for his voice. Other Korg instruments include the Wavestation, the Karma and the Trinity.

==Cameo film and television appearances==
Collins had cameo appearances in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Hook&quot; (1991) and the AIDS docudrama &quot;And the Band Played On&quot; (1993). He starred in &quot;Frauds&quot;, which competed for the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 1993 Cannes Film Festival. He supplied voices to two animated features: Amblin&#x27;s &quot;Balto&quot; (1995) and Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Jungle Book 2&quot; (2003). A long-discussed but never completed project was a film titled &quot;The Three Bears&quot;; originally meant to star Collins, Danny DeVito, and Bob Hoskins. He often mentioned the film, though an appropriate script never materialised. Collins&#x27;s music is featured in the satirical black comedy film &quot;American Psycho&quot;, with psychotic lead character Patrick Bateman (played by Christian Bale) portrayed as an obsessive fan who reads deep meaning into his work, especially with Genesis, while describing his solo music as &quot;...more commercial and therefore more satisfying, in a narrower way.&quot; Bateman delivers a monologue praising Collins and Genesis during a sequence in which he engages the services of two prostitutes while playing &quot;In Too Deep&quot; and &quot;Sussudio&quot;. Collins told the &quot;New Musical Express&quot;: &quot;I don&#x27;t think him being a psychopath and liking my music is linked – my music was just omnipresent in that era.&quot;

During the 1980s, Collins was among the celebrities caricatured on the satirical television puppet show &quot;Spitting Image&quot;—the show&#x27;s creators were then commissioned by Genesis to create puppets of the entire band to appear in their 1986 music video &quot;Land of Confusion&quot;. Collins twice hosted the &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards on television, which were produced and directed by his longtime music video and TV special collaborators, Paul Flattery and Jim Yukich of FYI (Flattery Yukich Inc). In 1985, he also appeared in an episode of the series &quot;Miami Vice&quot;, entitled &quot;Phil the Shill&quot;, in which he plays a cheating con-man. In the 1980s he appeared in several comedy sketches with &quot;The Two Ronnies&quot; on BBC One.
In 2001, Collins was one of several celebrities who were tricked into appearing in a controversial British comedy series, &quot;Brass Eye&quot;, shown on public service broadcaster Channel 4. In the episode, Collins endorsed a hoax anti-paedophile campaign wearing a T-shirt with the words &quot;Nonce Sense&quot; and warned children against speaking to suspicious people. Collins was reported by the BBC to have consulted lawyers regarding the programme, which was originally pulled from broadcast but eventually rescheduled. Collins said he had taken part in the programme &quot;in good faith for the public benefit&quot;, believing it to be &quot;a public service programme that would be going around schools and colleges in a bid to stem child abduction and abuse&quot;. Collins also accused the makers of the programme of &quot;some serious taste problems&quot; and warned it would prevent celebrities from supporting &quot;public spirited causes&quot; in the future.

In 2006, Collins played a fictional version of himself in the PSP and PS2 video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories&quot;. Set in 1984, he appears in three missions in which the main character, Victor, must save him from Mafia-hired hitmen, who are trying to kill Collins because his manager refused to pay his $3 million debt to them. The final mission occurs during his concert, where the player must defend the scaffolding against saboteurs while Collins is performing &quot;In the Air Tonight&quot;. After this, the player is given the opportunity to watch this performance of &quot;In the Air Tonight&quot; for the cost of 6,000 in-game dollars. &quot;In the Air Tonight&quot; is part of the official &quot;Vice City Stories&quot; soundtrack, and can be also heard on the in-game radio station Emotion 98.3. The song has also been featured in films such as &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters&quot; (2007) and &quot;The Hangover&quot; (2009).

&quot;In the Air Tonight&quot; featured in the 2007 &quot;Gorilla&quot; commercial for Cadbury&#x27;s Dairy Milk chocolate. Many believed that Collins himself was the drummer. When asked about &quot;Gorilla&quot;, Collins jokingly commented that &quot;Not only is he a better drummer than me, he also has more hair. Can he sing too?&quot; The advertisement—which won Gold at the British Television Advertising Awards in 2008—helped the song re-enter the New Zealand RIANZ Singles Chart at No. 3 in July 2008, the following week reaching No. 1, beating its original 1981 No. 6 peak. &quot;In the Air Tonight&quot; was also sampled in the song &quot;I Can Feel It&quot; on Sean Kingston&#x27;s self-titled debut album.

Collins was portrayed in the cartoon &quot;South Park&quot; in the episode &quot;Timmy 2000&quot; holding his Oscar throughout, referring to his 1999 win for &quot;You&#x27;ll Be in My Heart&quot;, which defeated &quot;Blame Canada&quot; from &quot;South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut&quot;. The show&#x27;s creators admitted resenting losing to Collins, as they felt their other competitors were more worthy. The episode &quot;Cartman&#x27;s Silly Hate Crime 2000&quot; involves a sled race down the landmark known as Phil Collins Hill, which has an impression of Collins&#x27;s face in the side. The Phil Collins character returns once more and gets killed off in the episode &quot;200&quot;. Collins appears briefly in the Finnish animated sitcom &quot;Pasila&quot; in the episode &quot;Phil Collins Hangover&quot;. The music of this episode is a pastiche of Collins&#x27;s &quot;Another Day in Paradise&quot;. Collins was mentioned in the &quot;Psych&quot; episode &quot;Disco Didn&#x27;t Die. It Was Murdered!&quot; as resembling Shawn Spencer&#x27;s father, Henry, portrayed by actor Corbin Bernsen.

==Critical and public perceptions==
===Criticism===
According to a 2000 BBC biography of Collins, &quot;critics sneer at him&quot; and &quot;bad publicity also caused problems&quot;, which &quot;damaged his public profile&quot;. Rock historian Martin C. Strong wrote that Collins &quot;truly polarised opinion from the start, his ubiquitous smugness and increasingly sterile pop making him a favourite target for critics&quot;. According to &quot;Guardian&quot; writer Paul Lester, Collins would &quot;regularly&quot; call music journalists to take issue with negative reviews. Over time, he came to be personally disliked; in 2009, journalist Mark Lawson told how Collins&#x27;s media profile had shifted from &quot;pop&#x27;s Mr. Nice guy, patron saint of ordinary blokes&quot;, to someone accused of &quot;blandness, [being a] tax exile and ending a marriage by sending a fax&quot;. Collins has rejected accusations of tax avoidance, and despite confirming that some of the divorce-related correspondence between him and second wife, Jill Tavelman, was by fax (a message from Collins regarding access to their daughter was reproduced for the front cover of &quot;The Sun&quot; in 1993), he states that he did not terminate the marriage in that fashion. Nevertheless, the British media has often repeated the fax claim. Collins has been the victim of scathing remarks in regard to his alleged right-wing political leanings. Caroline Sullivan, a music critic of &quot;The Guardian&quot;, referred to his cumulative negative publicity in her 2007 article &quot;I wish I&#x27;d never heard of Phil Collins&quot;, writing that it was difficult for her to hear his work &quot;without being riven by distaste for the man himself&quot;.

Several critics have commented on Collins&#x27;s omnipresence, especially in the 1980s and early 1990s. Journalist Frank DiGiacomo wrote a 1999 piece for &quot;New York Observer&quot; titled &quot;The Collins Menace&quot;; he said, &quot;Even when I sought to escape the sounds [of Collins] in my head by turning on the TV, there would be Mr. Collins ... mugging for the cameras—intent on showing the world just how hard he would work to sell millions of records to millions of stupid people.&quot; In his 2010 article &quot;Love Don&#x27;t Come Easy: Artists We Love to Hate&quot;, &quot;The Irish Times&quot; critic Kevin Courtney expressed similar sentiments. Naming Collins as one of the ten most disliked pop stars in the world, he wrote: performed at Live Aid, playing first at Wembley, then flying over to Philadelphia via Concorde, just to make sure no one in the U.S. got off lightly. By the early 1990s, Phil phatigue had really set in.&quot; Tim Chester of the &quot;New Musical Express&quot; alluded to the backlash against Collins in an article titled, &quot;Is It Time We All Stopped Hating Phil Collins?&quot;. Chester said of the unrelenting derision he has suffered, &quot;a lot of it he brings on himself.&quot; He also said that Collins was &quot;responsible for some of the cheesiest music ever committed to acetate&quot;. Erik Hedegaard of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; mentioned that Phil Collins hate sites had &quot;flourished&quot; online, and acknowledged that he had been called &quot;the sellout who took Peter Gabriel&#x27;s Genesis, that paragon of prog-rock, and turned it into a lame-o pop act and went on to make all those supercheesy hits that really did define the 1980s&quot;.

According to author Dylan Jones in his 2013 publication on 1980s popular music, many of Collins&#x27;s peers &quot;despised&quot; him. Some fellow artists have made negative comments about Collins publicly. In 1990, former Pink Floyd frontman Roger Waters criticised Collins&#x27;s &quot;ubiquitous nature&quot;, including his involvement in the Who&#x27;s 1989 reunion tour. David Bowie dismissed some of his own 1980s output as his &quot;Phil Collins years/albums&quot;. In addition to the song&#x27;s negative press from music journalists, singer-songwriter and political activist Billy Bragg criticised Collins for writing &quot;Another Day in Paradise&quot;, stating: &quot;Phil Collins might write a song about the homeless, but if he doesn&#x27;t have the action to go with it he&#x27;s just exploiting that for a subject.&quot; Oasis songwriter Noel Gallagher criticised Collins on multiple occasions, including the comment: &quot;Just because you sell lots of records, it doesn&#x27;t mean to say you&#x27;re any good. Look at Phil Collins.&quot; Collins said he has &quot;at times, been very down&quot; about Noel Gallagher&#x27;s comments. Gallagher&#x27;s brother, Oasis singer Liam, also recalled the &quot;boring&quot; Collins&#x27;s chart dominance in the 1980s and stated that, by the 1990s, it was &quot;time for some real lads to get up there and take charge&quot;. Appearing on the BBC television series &quot;Room 101&quot; in 2005, in which guests discuss their most hated things and people, Collins nominated the Gallaghers to be sent into the eponymous room. He described them as &quot;horrible&quot; and stated: &quot;They&#x27;re rude and not as talented as they think they are. I won&#x27;t mince words here, but they&#x27;ve had a go at me personally.&quot;

Collins acknowledged in 2010 that he had been &quot;omnipresent&quot;. He said of his character: &quot;The persona on stage came out of insecurity ... it seems embarrassing now. I recently started transferring all my VHS tapes onto DVD to create an archive, and everything I was watching, I thought, &#x27;God, I&#x27;m annoying.&#x27; I appeared to be very cocky, and really I wasn&#x27;t.&quot; Collins concedes his status as a figure of contempt for many people and has said that he believes this is a consequence of his music being overplayed. In 2011 he said: &quot;The fact that people got so sick of me wasn&#x27;t really my fault. ... It&#x27;s hardly surprising that people grew to hate me. I&#x27;m sorry that it was all so successful. I honestly didn&#x27;t mean it to happen like that!&quot; He described criticism of his physical appearance over the years as &quot;a cheap shot&quot;, but has acknowledged the &quot;very vocal element&quot; of Genesis fans who believe that the group sold out under his tenure as lead vocalist. Collins denied that his retirement in 2011 was due to negative attention and said that his statements had been taken out of context. He said: &quot;I have ended up sounding like a tormented weirdo who thinks he was at the Alamo in another life, who feels very sorry for himself, and is retiring hurt because of the bad press over the years. None of this is true.&quot;

===Praise===

Paul Lester of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote in 2013 that Collins is one of several pop acts that &quot;used to be a joke&quot; but are &quot;now being hailed as gods&quot;. Collins has become an important figure in US urban music, influencing artists such as Kanye West, Alicia Keys and Beyoncé. His songs have been sampled by various hip-hop and contemporary R&amp;B acts, and performers including Lil&#x27; Kim, Kelis, and Wu-Tang Clan co-founder Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard covered his work on the 2001 tribute album &quot;Urban Renewal&quot;.

In 2004, Death Cab For Cutie and The Postal Service musician Ben Gibbard described Collins as a &quot;great vocalist&quot;. Collins has been championed by his contemporary, the heavy metal singer Ozzy Osbourne, David Crosby called him &quot;a dear friend&quot; who helped him &quot;enormously&quot;, Queen guitarist Brian May called him &quot;a great guy and an amazing drummer&quot;, and Robert Plant paid tribute to him as &quot;the most spirited and positive and really encouraging force&quot; when commencing his own solo career after the break-up of Led Zeppelin. Collins has been championed by modern artists in diverse genres, including indie rock groups the 1975, Generationals, Neon Indian, Yeasayer, St. Lucia and Sleigh Bells, electronica artist Lorde, and soul singer Diane Birch, who said in 2014, &quot;Collins walks a really fine line between being really cheesy and being really sophisticated. He can seem appalling, but at the same time, he has awesome production values and there&#x27;s a particular richness to the sound. It&#x27;s very proficient in the instrumentation and savvy about melodies.&quot;

Genesis bandmate Mike Rutherford has praised Collins&#x27;s personality, saying that &quot;he always had a bloke-next-door, happy-go-lucky demeanour about him: let&#x27;s have a drink in the pub, crack a joke, smoke a cigarette or a joint&quot;. In 2014, former Genesis frontman Peter Gabriel, who worked again with Collins in the 1980s, referred to him as the &quot;workaholics&#x27; workaholic&quot;. He has been characterised by favourable critics as a &quot;rock god&quot;, and an artist who has remained &quot;down to earth&quot;. In &quot;The New Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, published in 2004, J. D. Considine wrote: &quot;For a time, Phil Collins was nearly inescapable on the radio, and enormously popular with the listening public — something that made him an obvious target for critics. Despite his &quot;lumpen&quot;-pop appeal, however, Collins is an incisive songwriter and resourceful musician.&quot;

Tim Chester of the &quot;New Musical Express&quot; described Collins as &quot;the go-to guy for ironic appreciation and guilty pleasures&quot; and stated he was responsible for &quot;some moments of true genius (often accompanied, it must be said, by some real stinkers)&quot;. Creation Records founder Alan McGee wrote in 2009 that there was a &quot;non-ironic revival of Phil Collins&quot; happening. According to McGee: &quot;The kids don&#x27;t care about &#x27;indie cred&#x27; anymore. To them, a great pop song is just that: a great pop song. In this time of revivals, nothing is a sacred cow anymore, and that can only be a good thing for music.&quot; Commenting on Collins&#x27;s popularity with hip-hop acts, he argued: &quot;It&#x27;s not surprising. Collins is a world-class drummer whose songs immediately lend themselves to being sampled.&quot;

In 2010, Gary Mills of &quot;The Quietus&quot; made an impassioned defence of Collins: &quot;There can&#x27;t be many figures in the world of pop who have inspired quite the same kind of hatred-bordering-on-civil-unrest as Collins, and there can&#x27;t be too many who have shifted anything like the 150 million plus units that he&#x27;s got through as a solo artist either ... The disgrace of a career bogged entirely in the determined dross of &quot;No Jacket Required&quot; however is simply not justified, regardless of how Collins gained either his fortune, or his public image.&quot; David Sheppard wrote for the BBC in 2010: &quot;Granted, Collins has sometimes been guilty of painting the bull&#x27;s-eye on his own forehead (that self-aggrandising Live Aid Concorde business, the cringe-worthy lyrics to &#x27;Another Day in Paradise&#x27;, &quot;Buster&quot;, etc.), but nonetheless, the sometime Genesis frontman&#x27;s canon is so substantial and his hits so profuse that it feels myopic to dismiss him merely as a haughty purveyor of tortured, romantic ballads for the middle income world.&quot;

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; journalist Erik Hedegaard expressed disapproval of the widespread criticism which Collins has received, suggesting that he has been &quot;unfairly and inexplicably vilified&quot;. Martin C. Strong stated in 2011 that &quot;the enigmatic and amiable Phil Collins has had his fair share of mockers and critics over the years, although one thing is sure, and that is his dexterity and undeniable talent&quot;. In a piece the following year, titled &quot;10 Much-Mocked Artists It&#x27;s Time We Forgave&quot;, &quot;New Musical Express&quot; critic Anna Conrad said Collins had been portrayed as a &quot;villain&quot;, and wrote: &quot;Was the bile really justified? ... come on, admit it. You&#x27;ve air drummed to &#x27;In the Air Tonight&#x27;, and loved it.&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot; journalist Dave Simpson wrote a complimentary article in 2013; while acknowledging &quot;few pop figures have become as successful and yet reviled as Phil Collins&quot;, he argued &quot;it&#x27;s about time we recognised Collins&#x27;s vast influence as one of the godfathers of popular culture&quot;.

==Personal life==

===Family and relationships===
Collins has divorced three times. From 1975 to 1980, he was married to Canadian-born Andrea Bertorelli. They met as 11-year-old students in a London drama class and reconnected in 1974 when Genesis performed in Vancouver. They married in England in 1975 when both were 24, after which Collins legally adopted Bertorelli&#x27;s daughter Joely (b. 1972), who became an actress and film producer. They also had a son, Simon Collins (b. 1976), who is the former vocalist and drummer of the progressive rock band Sound of Contact. In 2016, Bertorelli took legal action against Collins pertaining to his account of their relationship in his autobiography.

In 1984, Collins married American Jill Tavelman. They have one daughter, Lily Collins (b. 1989), who became an actress. While married to Tavelman, Collins twice had an affair with Lavinia Lang, a former drama school classmate, while touring with Genesis in 1992. The two were previously engaged, but the relationship ended before they married. In 1994, Collins openly stated that he had fallen out of love with Tavelman and had filed for divorce, which was finalised in 1996. As part of the settlement, Collins paid £17 million to Tavelman.

In 1999, Collins married Orianne Cevey, a Swiss national who worked as his translator at the start of his 1994 tour when she was 22. They have two sons, Nicholas and Matthew. Nicholas is a professional drummer, while Matthew was an aspiring footballer for the youth squad of WSG Tirol, having previously played in the youth systems of Bundesliga club Hannover 96 and Astoria Walldorf. He has since gone on to play in the WSG Tirol&#x27;s regional leagues. The family lived in the former house of Jackie Stewart in Begnins, Switzerland. In 2006 Cevey and Collins divorced. Collins paid £25 million to Cevey, which became the largest settlement in a British celebrity divorce. Collins continued to live in Féchy, Switzerland, while he also maintained homes in New York City and Dersingham, Norfolk.

From 2007 to 2016, Collins was in a relationship with American news anchor Dana Tyler. In 2008, Cevey and her two sons moved to Miami, Florida. Collins recalled: &quot;I went through a few bits of darkness; drinking too much. I killed my hours watching TV and drinking, and it almost killed me.&quot; He said in 2015 that he had been teetotal for three years. In January 2016, after moving to Miami Beach, Florida in the previous year to be closer to his two youngest sons, Collins reunited with Cevey and they lived together in Miami. In October 2020, Collins filed an eviction notice against Cevey after she secretly married another man in August. Collins sold his Miami home in 2021 for $39 million.

Collins&#x27;s brother Clive was a cartoonist. Phil appeared at his brother&#x27;s investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace in 2012 when he was awarded an MBE for services to art, with Phil stating, &quot;I shared a bedroom with him when we were boys and he was always drawing. He used to do Christmas cards and birthday cards for the family.&quot;

===Wealth===
In 2012, Collins was estimated to be the second-wealthiest drummer in the world, surpassed only by Ringo Starr. Collins was estimated to have a fortune of £120 million in the &quot;Sunday Times Rich List&quot; of 2018, making him one of the 25 wealthiest people in the British music industry.

===Court case===

On 29 March 2000, Collins launched a case against two former musicians from his band to recoup £500,000 in royalties that were overpaid. Louis Satterfield and Rahmlee Davis claimed their contract entitled them to 0.5 per cent of the royalties from &quot;Serious Hits... Live!&quot;, a live album recorded during Collins&#x27;s Seriously, Live! World Tour in 1990. They claimed they were an integral part of the whole album, but Collins responded that the two should only receive royalties from the five tracks in which they were involved. On 19 April 2000, the High Court in London ruled that the two musicians would receive no more royalty money from Phil Collins. The amount that Collins was seeking was halved, and Satterfield and Davis (who originally brought the suit forward in California) would not have to repay any of it. The judge agreed with Collins&#x27;s argument that Satterfield and Davis should have been paid for only the five tracks on which they performed, including the hit &quot;Sussudio&quot;.

===Health===
In 2000, Collins developed sudden hearing loss in his left ear following a recording session in Los Angeles. He consulted three doctors, who reportedly told him that there was nothing they could do and that the chance of a full recovery was slim. Two years later, he had recovered most of his hearing. Collins later found that it was caused by a viral infection, and it was resolved after treatment.

In April 2009, Collins had surgery on his upper neck to correct a problem that began while drumming on the 2007 Genesis tour. Following the operation, he lost feeling in his fingers and could only grip drumsticks if they were taped to his hands. In 2010, Collins alluded to feelings of depression and low self-worth in recent years and said he had contemplated suicide, but he resisted for the sake of his children. In 2014, Collins said that he was still unable to play the drums and that it was not arthritis, but an undiagnosed nerve problem. In 2015, he underwent a spine operation. In 2016, he said he was still unable to drum with his left hand. His doctor advised him that if he wanted to play the drums again, he would need to take it &quot;step by step&quot; and &quot;practice&quot;. 

In his 2016 autobiography, Collins acknowledged that he had struggled with alcoholism following his retirement and third divorce. At that point he also stated that he had been sober for three years.

In January 2017, Collins said he was a type 2 diabetic and had received treatment with a hyperbaric chamber after developing a diabetic abscess on his foot that became infected. In June 2017, Collins cancelled two shows after he slipped in his hotel room during the night and hit his head on a chair as he fell, resulting in stitches for a severe gash close to his eye. The fall was caused by his foot drop, resulting from his back operation. He subsequently had to use a cane to assist with walking, and sit in a chair while performing on stage.

In December 2024, a YouTube documentary titled &quot;Phil Collins: Drummer First&quot; was released by &quot;Drumeo&quot;, reflecting primarily on Phil&#x27;s history as a drummer, in which his ailing health and fragility is observed. During one interview, with the help of his son, Nic, Phil was filmed behind his drums for the first time in several years. At one point, Phil picks up a set of drumsticks and states, &quot;Just feels so strange to hold a pair.&quot; Visibly challenged in doing so, Phil then lightly taps a few of the drum heads with one of the sticks and says, &quot;That&#x27;s enough of that,&quot; and stands up from the drumset.

===Honorary degrees===
Collins has received several honorary degrees in recognition of his work in music and his personal interests. In 1987, he received an honorary doctorate of fine arts at Fairleigh Dickinson University. In 1991, he received an honorary doctorate of music at the Berklee College of Music. On 12 May 2012, he received an honorary doctorate of history at the McMurry University in Abilene, Texas, for his research and collection of Texas Revolution artefacts and documents (see other interests section).

===Politics===
Collins has often been mentioned erroneously in the British media as being a supporter of the Conservative Party and a critic of the Labour Party. This derives from the famous article in &quot;The Sun&quot;, printed on the day of the 1992 UK general election, titled &quot;If Kinnock wins today will the last person to leave Britain please turn out the lights&quot;, which stated that Collins was among several celebrities who were planning to leave Britain in the event of a Labour victory.

Collins is often reported in the British press to have left the UK and moved to Switzerland in protest at the Labour Party&#x27;s victory in the 1997 general election. Shortly before the 2005 election (when Collins was living in Switzerland), Labour supporter Noel Gallagher was quoted: &quot;Vote Labour. If you don&#x27;t and the Tories get in, Phil Collins is threatening to come back and live here. And let&#x27;s face it, none of us want that.&quot; Collins has since stated that although he did once say many years earlier that he might leave Britain if most of his income was taken in tax, which was Labour Party policy at that time for top earners, he has never been a Conservative Party supporter and he left Britain for Switzerland in 1994 purely because he started a relationship with a woman who lived there. He said of Gallagher: &quot;I don&#x27;t care if he likes my music or not. I do care if he starts telling people I&#x27;m a wanker because of my politics. It&#x27;s an opinion based on an old, misunderstood quote.&quot;

Despite his statement that he did not leave Britain for tax purposes, Collins was one of several wealthy figures living in tax havens who were singled out for criticism in a 2008 report by the charity Christian Aid. &quot;The Independent&quot; included Collins as one of their &quot;ten celebrity tax exiles&quot;, erroneously repeating that he had left the country when Labour won the 1997 general election and that he threatened to return if the Conservatives won in 2005. Referring to the 1997 general election in his article &quot;Famous men and their misunderstood politics&quot; for MSN, Hugh Wilson stated: &quot;Labour won it in a landslide, which just goes to show the influence pop stars really wield&quot;. He also wrote that Collins&#x27;s reported comments and subsequent move to Switzerland led to &quot;accusations of hypocrisy&quot; since he had &quot;bemoaned the plight of the homeless in the song &#x27;Another Day in Paradise, making him &quot;an easy target when future elections came round&quot;. The Paul Heaton and Jacqui Abbott song &quot;When I Get Back to Blighty&quot;, from their 2014 album &quot;What Have We Become?&quot;, made reference to Collins as &quot;a prisoner to his tax returns&quot;.

Questioned about his politics by Mark Lawson in an interview for the BBC, broadcast in 2009, Collins said: &quot;My father was Conservative but it wasn&#x27;t quite the same, I don&#x27;t think, when he was alive. Politics never loomed large in our family anyway. I think the politics of the country were very different then.&quot; In a 2016 interview in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Collins stated that talking about politics to &quot;The Sun&quot; was one of his biggest regrets. When asked whether he had ever voted Conservative, he said: &quot;I didn&#x27;t vote, actually. And that&#x27;s not something I&#x27;m proud of. I was just so busy that I rarely was here.&quot;

Collins is a member of the Canadian charity Artists Against Racism and has worked with them on campaigns including radio PSAs. In October 2020, Collins issued a cease and desist order to Donald Trump and his campaign for playing &quot;In the Air Tonight&quot; at a rally.

===Other interests===
Collins has a long-standing interest in the Alamo. He has collected hundreds of artefacts related to the famous 1836 battle in San Antonio, Texas, narrated a light and sound show about the Alamo, and has spoken at related events. His passion for the Battle of the Alamo has also led him to write the book &quot;The Alamo and Beyond: A Collector&#x27;s Journey&quot;, published in 2012. A short film was released in 2013 called &quot;Phil Collins and the Wild Frontier&quot; which captures Collins on a book tour in June 2012. On 26 June 2014, a press conference was held from the Alamo, where Collins spoke, announcing that he was donating his entire collection to the Alamo via the State of Texas. On 11 March 2015, in honour of his donation, Collins was named an honorary Texan by the state legislature.

Like Rod Stewart, Eric Clapton, and Neil Young, Collins is a model railway enthusiast. He also has an interest in King &amp; Country toy soldiers. He is an honorary president of Richmond Yacht Club, of which his parents used to be members.

==Charity work==
Collins has performed at the &quot;Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball&quot;, a benefit show co-founded by Monty Python member John Cleese on behalf of Amnesty International. He made his first appearance at the 1981 show held in London&#x27;s Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, and he subsequently became an activist. Collins was appointed a Lieutenant of the Royal Victorian Order (LVO) in the 1994 Birthday Honours, in recognition of his work on behalf of The Prince&#x27;s Trust, a leading UK youth charity founded by King Charles III (then-Prince of Wales) which provides training, personal development, business start up support, mentoring, and advice. Since appearing at the first Prince&#x27;s Trust&#x27;s rock concert in 1982 which included a performance as part of singer Kate Bush&#x27;s backing band, Collins has played at the event numerous times since, most recently at the Royal Albert Hall in 2010.

On 9 April 1989, Collins topped the bill at a benefit concert for the veteran English comic actor Terry-Thomas. Held at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, the event raised over £75,000 for Terry-Thomas and Parkinson&#x27;s UK.

Collins has stated he is a supporter of animal rights and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). In 2005 he donated autographed drumsticks in support of PETA&#x27;s campaign against Kentucky Fried Chicken.

In February 2000, Collins and Cevey launched the Little Dreams Foundation, a non-profit organisation that aims to &quot;...realise the dreams of children in the fields of sports and art&quot; by providing future prodigies aged 4 to 16 years with financial, material, and mentoring support with the help of experts in various fields. Collins took the action after receiving letters from children asking him how they could break into the music industry. Mentors to the students who have benefited from his foundation include Tina Turner and Natalie Cole. In 2013 he visited Miami Beach, Florida, to promote the expansion of his foundation.

Collins supports the South African charity &quot;Topsy Foundation&quot;, which provides relief services to some of South Africa&#x27;s most under-resourced rural communities through a multi-faceted approach to the consequences of HIV/AIDS and extreme poverty. He donates all the royalties earned from his music sales in South Africa to the organisation.
