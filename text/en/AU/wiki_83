<text>Liutprand, also Liudprand, Liuprand, Lioutio, Liucius, Liuzo, and Lioutsios (c. 920 – 972), was a historian, diplomat, and Bishop of Cremona born in northern Italy, whose works are an important source for the politics of the 10th century Byzantine court.

==Early life and career==
Liutprand was born into a prominent family from Pavia, of Lombard origins, around 920. In 931 he entered service as page to Hugh of Arles, who kept court at Pavia as King of Italy and who married the notorious and powerful Marozia of Rome. Liutprand was educated at the court and became a Deacon at the Cathedral of Pavia. After Hugh died in 947, leaving his son and co-ruler Lothair on the throne as King of Italy, Liutprand became confidential secretary to the actual ruler of Italy, Berengar II, marchese d&#x27;Ivrea, for whom he became chancellor.

==Mission to Constantinople==
In 949, Berengar II sent him on a goodwill mission as an apprentice diplomat to the Byzantine court of Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus, with whom he became friendly. Liutprand went partly to learn Greek and may have provided material for chapter 26 of Constantine VII&#x27;s . Both Liutprand&#x27;s father and his stepfather had been sent as ambassadors to Constantinople (927 and 942). (Knowledge of Prince Igor&#x27;s 941 attack on Constantinople was told by his stepfather as Liutprand wasn&#x27;t in the city at the time). Liutprand included in his later &quot;Antapodosis&quot; (950s) a glowing account of the hospitality he enjoyed there, including being carried into the audience hall on the shoulders of eunuchs, and Constantine&#x27;s delight in receiving a gift of an additional four &quot;de luxe&quot; eunuchs from Liutprand. Liutprand uses the word &quot;carzimasium&quot; for the eunuchs he brought, suggesting that all of their external genitalia had been removed.

==Bishop of Cremona==
On his return, however, he fell out with Berengar, for which Liutprand avenged himself in his &quot;Antapodosis&quot; (&quot;retribution&quot;), and attached himself to Berengar&#x27;s rival, the emperor Otto I, who became King of Italy upon the death of Lothair in 950. With Otto I he returned to Italy in 961 and was invested as Bishop of Cremona the following year. At Otto&#x27;s court, he met Recemund, a Córdoban ambassador, who convinced him to write a history of his days (the later &quot;Antapodosis&quot;, which was dedicated to Recemund). Liutprand was often entrusted with important diplomacy, and, in 963, he was sent to Pope John XII at the beginning of the quarrel between the Pope and the Emperor over papal allegiance to Berengar&#x27;s son, Adelbert. Liutprand attended the Synod of Rome (963) that deposed John XII in 963, and wrote the only connected narrative of the events.

==Second mission to Constantinople==
He was frequently employed in missions to the Pope, and in 968 he was sent again to Constantinople, this time to the court of Nicephorus Phocas, to demand for the younger Otto (afterwards Otto II) the hand of Anna Porphyrogenita, daughter of the former emperor Romanus II. The possible marriage was part of a wider negotiation between Otto and Nicephorus, the Eastern Emperor, who still claimed Benevento and Capua, which were actually in Lombard hands and whose forces had come to strife with Otto in Bari recently. His reception at Constantinople was humiliating and ultimately futile after the subject of Otto&#x27;s claim to the title Emperor caused friction, triggered by a letter from Pope John XIII which offensively addressed Nicephorus as &quot;the emperor of the Greeks&quot;.

Liutprand&#x27;s account of this embassy in the &quot;Relatio de Legatione Constantinopolitana&quot; is perhaps the most graphic and lively piece of writing which has come down to us from the 10th century. The detailed description of Constantinople and the Byzantine court is a document of rare value, though highly coloured by his hostility towards the Byzantine Empire. The &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; asserted &quot;Liutprand&#x27;s writings are a very important historical source for the tenth century; he is ever a strong partisan and is frequently unfair towards his adversaries.&quot;

Liutprand&#x27;s candid account makes clear that often he was not as diplomatic as he might have been and Constanze Schummer has questioned how good a diplomat he really was in Constantinople, despite successes in the West. On his second mission to Constantinople, for instance, after his purchases of purple textiles are confiscated, he tells the imperial party that at home whores and conjurers wear purple. Schummer and others have speculated that Otto I did not actually see the &quot;Relatio&quot; or receive an accurate account of Liutprand&#x27;s performance at Constantinople.

Whether he returned in 971 with the embassy to fetch Theophanu, the eventually negotiated bride, or not is uncertain, but he may well have. Liutprand probably died before 20 July 972, certainly before 5 March 973. His successor as bishop of Cremona was installed in 973.

<doc id="155516" wikidata="Q43934" url="?curid=155516" title="Liaoning">
<text>Liaoning is a coastal province in Northeast China that is the smallest, southernmost, and most populous province in the region. With its capital at Shenyang, it is located on the northern shore of the Yellow Sea, and is the northernmost coastal province of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.
Historically a gateway between China proper and Manchuria, the modern Liaoning province was established in 1907 as Fengtian or Fengtien province and was renamed Liaoning in 1929. It was also known at that time as Mukden Province for the Manchu name of &quot;Shengjing&quot;, the former name of Shenyang. Under the Japanese-puppet Manchukuo regime, the province reverted to its 1907 name, but the name Liaoning was restored for a brief time in 1945 and then again in 1954.

Liaoning borders the Yellow Sea (Korea Bay) and Bohai Sea in the south, North Korea&#x27;s North Pyongan and Chagang provinces in the southeast, Jilin to the northeast, Hebei to the southwest, and Inner Mongolia to the northwest. The Yalu River marks the province&#x27;s border with North Korea, emptying into the Korea Bay between Dandong in Liaoning and Sinuiju in North Korea. Liaoning is also one of China&#x27;s leading provinces in research and education. As of 2023, two major cities in Liaoning ranked in the world&#x27;s top 200 cities (Dalian 37th and Shenyang 124th) by scientific research output, as tracked by Nature Index.

== Name ==
Liaoning is named after the Liao River that runs through the province. &quot;Ning&quot; (宁, &quot;peace&quot;) is used frequently in Chinese place names including Ningxia, Xining and Nanning. The current name was first adopted in 1929, and restored in 1954 upon the merging of the Liaoxi (&quot;West Liao&quot;) and Liaodong (&quot;East Liao&quot;) provinces.

== History ==
Prior to 3rd century BC, Donghu, Gojoseon and Yemaek peoples inhabited Liaoning. The state of Yan conquered the area around 300 BC. Two commanderies, Liaodong (&quot;east of the Liao River&quot;) and Liaoxi (&quot;west of the Liao River&quot;), were established within the Liaoning region. The Yan city of Xiangping, the center of Liaodong, was located on the site of the present Liaoyang city. As the Han dynasty fell, warlord Gongsun Du and his family established and maintained a semi-independent state based in Liaodong, until it was defeated by Cao Wei in 238. The state, also known as Yan, conducted numerous maritime diplomatic and trade expeditions, and had a lasting influence on Northeast Asian culture despite being short-lived. After the end of Western Jin dynasty, Liaoning was ruled by Xianbei states of the Murong tribe – Former Yan, Later Yan, and Northern Yan. In 436, as Northern Wei seized the Yan capital, Liaodong Peninsula was taken over by Goguryeo. The Tang dynasty annexed the region during the Goguryeo–Tang War. However, when the An Lushan Rebellion drained Tang&#x27;s resources away from its frontiers, Bohai gradually expanded into Liaodong. Eventually, Liaoning was conquered by the Khitan Liao dynasty, followed by the Jurchen Jin dynasty and the Mongol Empire.

The Ming Empire took control of Liaoning in 1371, just three years after the expulsion of the Mongols from Beijing. Around 1442, a defense wall was constructed to defend the agricultural heartland of the province from a potential threat from the Jurchen-Mongol Oriyanghan (who were Ming&#x27;s tributaries) from the northwest. Between 1467 and 1468, the wall was expanded to protect the region from the northeast as well, against attacks from Jianzhou Jurchens (who were later to become known as the Manchu people). Although similar in purpose to the Great Wall of China, this &quot;Liaodong Wall&quot; was of a lower-cost design. While stones and tiles were used in some parts, most of the wall was in fact simply an earth dike with moats on both sides.

Despite the Liaodong Wall, the Jurchens conquered Liaodong, or eastern Liaoning, in the early 17th century, decades before the rest of China fell to them. The Jurchen dynasty, styled &quot;Later Jin&quot; before being renamed to Qing, established its capital in 1616–1621 in Xingjing (), which was located outside of the Liaodong Wall in the eastern part of the modern Liaoning Province. It was moved to Dongjing (east of today&#x27;s Liaoyang, Liaoning), and finally in 1625 to Shengjing (now, Shenyang, Liaoning). Although the main Qing capital was moved from Shengjing to Beijing after it fell to the Qing in 1644, Shengjing retained its importance as a regional capital throughout most of the Qing era.

The Qing conquest of Liaoning resulted in a significant population loss in the area, as many local Chinese residents were either killed during fighting, or fled south of the Great Wall, many cities being destroyed by the retreating Ming forces themselves. As late as 1661, the Civil Governor (&quot;Fuyin&quot;) of Fengtian Province, Zhang Shangxian reported that, outside of Fengtian City (Shenyang), Liaoyang, and Haicheng, all other cities east of the Liao River were either abandoned, or hardly had a few hundred residents left. In the Governor&#x27;s words, &quot;Tieling and Fushun only have a few vagrants&quot;. West of the Liao, only Ningyuan, Jinzhou, and Guangning had any significant populations remaining.

In the latter half of the seventeenth century (starting with laws issued in 1651 and 1653), the imperial Qing government recruited migrants from south of the Great Wall (notably, from Shandong) to settle the relatively sparsely populated area of Fengtian Province (roughly corresponding to today&#x27;s Liaoning). Many of the current residents of Liaoning trace their ancestry to these seventeenth century settlers. The rest of China&#x27;s Northeast, however, remained officially off-limits to Han Chinese for most of the Manchu era. To prevent the migration of Chinese to those regions (today&#x27;s Jilin and Heilongjiang, as well as the adjacent parts of Inner Mongolia), the so-called Willow Palisade was constructed (). The Palisade encircled the agricultural heartlands of Fengtian, running in most areas either somewhat outside the old Ming Liaodong Wall, or reusing it, and separating it from the Manchu forests to the northeast and the Mongol grazing lands to the northwest.

Later on, the Qing government tried to stop the migrants flow to Fengtian or even to make some settlers return to their original places of residence – or, failing that, to legalize them. For example, an edict issued in 1704 commented on the recent Han Chinese settlers in Fengtian having failed to comply with earlier orders requiring them to leave, and asked them either to properly register and join a local defense group (), or to leave the province for their original places within the next ten years. Ten years later, naturally, another edict appeared, reminding of the necessity to do something with illegal migrants ... In any event, the restrictive policy was not as effective as desired by the officials in Beijing, and Fengtian&#x27;s population doubled between 1683 and 1734.

During the Qing Dynasty, Manchuria was ruled by three generals, one of whom, the General of Shengjing (Mukden i Jiyanggiyūn) ruled much of modern Liaoning. In 1860, the Manchu government began to reopen the region to migration, which quickly resulted in Han Chinese becoming the dominant ethnic group in the region.

In the 20th century, the province of Fengtian was set up in what is Liaoning today. When Japan and Russia fought the Russo-Japanese War in 1904–1905, many key battles took place in Liaoning, including the Battle of Port Arthur and the Battle of Mukden, which was, to that point, the largest land battle ever fought. During the Warlord Era in the early twentieth century, Liaoning was under the Fengtian clique, including Zhang Zuolin and his son Zhang Xueliang. The province first received its present name on January 29, 1929; the Zhongdong Railway Incident took place later that year. In 1931, Japan invaded and the area came under the rule of the Japanese-controlled puppet state of Manchukuo. The Chinese Civil War that took place following Japanese defeat in 1945 had its first major battles (the Liaoshen Campaign) in and around Liaoning.

At the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949, Liaoning did not exist; instead there were two provinces, Liaodong and Liaoxi, as well as five municipalities, Shenyang, Lüda (present-day Dalian), Anshan, Fushun, and Benxi. These were all merged into &quot;Liaoning&quot; in 1954, and parts of former Rehe province were merged into Liaoning in 1955. During the Cultural Revolution Liaoning also took in a part of Inner Mongolia, though this was reversed later.

Liaoning was one of the first provinces in China to industrialize, first under Japanese occupation, and then even more in the 1950s and 1960s. The city of Anshan, for example, is home to one of the largest iron and steel complexes in China. In recent years, this early focus on heavy industry has become a liability, as many of the large state-run enterprises have experienced economic difficulties. Recognizing the special difficulties faced by Liaoning and other provinces in Northeast China because of their heritage of heavy industry, the Chinese central government recently launched a &quot;Revitalize the Northeast&quot; Campaign.

== Geography ==


It is possible to think of Liaoning as three approximate geographical regions: the highlands in the west, plains in the middle, and hills in the east.

The highlands in the west are dominated by the Nulu&#x27;erhu Mountains, which roughly follow the border between Liaoning and Inner Mongolia. The entire region is dominated by low hills. A narrow strip of coastal plains, known as the Liaoxi Corridor, connects the Liao River Basin to the North China Plain, ending at the Shanhai Pass of the Great Wall.

The central part of Liaoning consists of a basin drained by rivers such as the Liao, Daliao, and their tributaries. This region is mostly flat and low-lying. 

The eastern part of Liaoning is dominated by the Changbai Mountains and Qianshan Mountains which extend into the sea to form the Liaodong Peninsula. The highest point in Liaoning, Mount Huabozi (1336 m), is found in this region.

Liaoning has a continental monsoon climate, and rainfall averages to about 440 to 1130 mm annually. Summer is rainy while the other seasons are dry.

== Paleontology ==
Liaoning contains some of the foremost paleontological sites in the world. Known collectively as the Jehol Group, they include the Yixian Formation, Jiufotang Formation and Tiaojishan Formation. The name &quot;Jehol&quot; derives from a now defunct provincial division of that name, which covered an area that is now Western Liaoning, Eastern Hebei, and a small part of Inner Mongolia. Fossils were first found there during the 1920s. During the Japanese occupation of the area through the 1930s and early 1940s, more fossils were found, but records of them were lost after World War II ended. The area remained relatively unexplored until the 1990s. It was in 1996 that Liaoning made the headlines with the announcement of the discovery of &quot;Sinosauropteryx prima&quot;, the first example of a filamented &quot;feathered&quot; dinosaur. &quot;Sinosauropteryx prima&quot; was a small feathered meat-eating dinosaur, from the Lower Cretaceous Yixian Formation. This discovery pushed the evolution of feathers back in time and showed that dinosaurs, not only birds, had feathers. It also showed a direct evolutionary link between theropod dinosaurs and modern birds.

Since then, dozens of ground-breaking finds have been discovered throughout the Jehol group. These including the earliest flower, earliest eutherian mammal, known as &quot;Eomaia&quot;, the earliest known metatherian, an intact embryo of a pterosaur, &quot;Repenomamus robustus&quot;—a 15 kg heavy mammal that ate dinosaurs, &quot;Sinornithosaurus millenii&quot;, as well as many birds and feathered dinosaurs. Discoveries such as &quot;Dilong paradoxus&quot;, another feathered theropod, date to the early Cretaceous Period. This is some 60 million years before &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;, and thus these discoveries push the evolution of feathers earlier than previously thought.

The Liaoning fossils are noted for their high degree of preservation—often including soft body tissues, which is rare. Aside from the famous birds and feathered dinosaurs, the Liaoning fossils include insects, fish, aquatic arthropods, and plants. The Liaoning deposit is widely considered to be one of the world&#x27;s premier fossil sites. The high level of preservation is believed to be due to how the animals died. The area was volcanically active, and large plumes of volcanic dust repeatedly covered the area, instantly killing and burying any living thing in the area. The extremely fine grain of the sediment and the chemical composition of the ash prevented the usual bacterial decay. In some specimens, extremely fine details can be seen such as the proboscis of the bee &quot;Florinemestruis&quot; used to drink nectar from the earliest flowers. In other specimens, colours are still visible, including stripes on fish and spots on turtles.

== Politics ==
The politics of Liaoning is structured in a single party-government system like all other governing institutions in mainland China. The Governor of Liaoning () is the highest-ranking official in the People&#x27;s Government of Liaoning. However, in the province&#x27;s single party-government governing system, the Governor has less power than the Chinese Communist Party Liaoning Provincial Committee Secretary ( for short), colloquially termed the &quot;Liaoning Party Chief&quot;.

Prior to 1949 and the Chinese Communist Revolution, Liaoning was governed by the Fengtian clique of warlords and interchangeably officials of the Chiang Kai-shek bureaucracy. During the Qing Dynasty Liaoning was known as the province of Fengtian (), and was governed by a zǒngdū or Viceroy (The Viceroy of the Three Eastern Provinces, ), along with the provinces of Jilin and Heilongjiang. The province itself also had a governor ().

==Administrative divisions==

Liaoning is divided into fourteen prefecture-level divisions, all prefecture-level cities (including two sub-provincial cities):

These prefecture-level cities are in turn divided into 100 county-level divisions (56 districts, 17 county-level cities, 19 counties, and 8 autonomous counties), which are then further subdivided into 1511 township-level divisions (613 towns, 301 townships, 77 ethnic townships, and 520 subdistricts). At the end of the year 2017, the total population is 43.69 million.

==Economy==

Liaoning has the largest and wealthiest provincial economy of Northeast China. Its nominal GDP for 2017 was 2.39 trillion yuan (ca. US$354 billion), making it the 14th largest in China (out of 31 provinces). Its per capita GDP was 54,745 yuan (US$8,108). Among the three provinces of Northeast China, Liaoning is the largest in terms of GDP and GDP per capita.

In 2008, Liaoning was the region with the highest GDP growth among global G8x8, the eight provinces or states below national level with the highest GDP of the top eight GDP nations. According to preliminary statistics, Liaoning maintained its GDP growth rate of 13.1 percent in 2009 and held its position as the province with the highest economic growth. Economic growth has since slowed down, with the economy expanding 3% in 2015 and contracting 1.3% in the first quarter of 2016.

Leading industries include petrochemicals, metallurgy, electronics telecommunications, and machinery. On a national level, Liaoning is a major producer of pig iron, steel and metal-cutting machine tools, all of whose production rank among the top three in the nation. Liaoning is one of the most important raw materials production bases in China. Industries such as mining, quarrying, smelting and pressing of ferrous metals, petroleum and natural gas extraction, are all of great significance.

Meanwhile, Liaoning is an important production base of equipment and machinery manufacturing, with Shenyang and Dalian being the industrial centers. Enterprises such as Shenyang Jinbei Co. Ltd., Daxian Group Co. Ltd., and Shenyang Machine Tool Co. Ltd., are leaders in their sectors. The province&#x27;s light industry mainly focuses on textiles and clothing industries which include cotton and wool spinning, chemical fiber production, knitting, silk production, and the manufacturing of both garments and textile machinery.

In 2008, its tertiary industry accounted for 34.5 percent of total GDP. In the future, Liaoning will continue its efforts to restructure large and medium-sized state enterprises. Meanwhile, the province will concentrate in developing its four pillar industries – petrochemicals, metallurgy, machinery and electronics.

Liaoning is the place of origin of the Li Keqiang index, an alternative measure of economic performance where GDP figures are unreliable.

=== Agriculture===
Main agricultural products of Liaoning include maize, sorghum, and soybeans. The region around Dalian produces three-quarters of China&#x27;s exported apples and peaches. Cotton is also produced.

Liaoning&#x27;s fruits include apples from Dalian and Yingkou, golden peaches from Dalian, pears from Beizhen of Jinzhou, white pears from Huludao and Suizhong, and apricots and plums from Gushan of Dandong.

===Mining===
Liaoning has the most iron, magnesite, diamond, and boron deposits among all province-level subdivisions of China. Liaoning is also an important source of petroleum and natural gas. Salt is produced along the coast.

===Oil===
Along with Liaoning&#x27;s rich mineral reserves, the province also has abundant deposits of crude oil, especially in the Liaohe Oilfield.

===Industry===
Liaoning is one of China&#x27;s most important industrial bases, covering a wide range of industries, including machinery, electronics, metal refining, petroleum, chemical industries, construction materials and coal.

The sea off Dalian abounds with quality seafood, such as abalone, sea cucumber, scallops, prawns, crabs, and sea urchins.

===Regional development strategies===
====Central Liaoning City Cluster (Shenyang Metro Area)====
The Central Liaoning city cluster is a megalopolis centered on Shenyang (urban population 4 million). Within its radius, it includes Anshan (urban population 1.3 million), Fushun (1.3 million), Yingkou (1.1 million), Benxi (0.95 million), Liaoyang (0.7 million), and Tieling (0.4 million).

In April 2010, the State Council of the People&#x27;s Republic of China approved a national development strategy for the Shenyang Metro Area. The core of this strategy is innovation in industrial development, integration of the eight cities, integration of urban and rural areas as well as the promotion of more market-oriented development.

====Liaoning Coastal Economic Belt====
The Chinese Communist Party Committee Secretary of Liaoning, Li Keqiang, initiated the development of a strategy entitled &quot;5 Points and One Line&quot;, which he first proposed on a visit to Yingkou in late 2005. Liaoning Province formally launched the development strategy for the entire Liaoning coastline in early 2006, so as to re-invigorate the provincial economy from its traditional status as a &quot;rustbelt&quot; of Chinese state-owned enterprises.

The &quot;Five Points&quot; indicate five key development areas in the province and cover seven zones: the Changxing Island Harbor Industrial Zone in Dalian; Yingkou Coastal Industrial Base; Liaoxi Jinzhou Bay Coastal Economic Zone; Dandong, and the Zhuanghe Huayuankou Industrial Zone.

The five zones together cover a planned area of nearly .

The &quot;One Line&quot; mentioned in the strategy represents a new series of motorways along the coast. The 1,433-kilometer coastline will become the connection between the five above zones, through which 6 provincial cities, 21 counties and 113 towns will be interlinked. Coastal motorways directly connect the entire string of five zones along the Bohai sea.

== Demographics ==
The population of Liaoning is mostly Han Chinese with minorities of Manchus, Mongols, Hui, Koreans and Xibe. Liaoning has both the highest absolute number and highest percentage of Manchus in all of China.

==Religion==

According to a 2012 survey, only around 10% of the population of Liaoning belongs to organised religions, the largest groups being Buddhists with 5.5%, followed by Protestants with 2.2%, Muslims with 0.6% and Catholics with 0.2%.

The reports did not give figures for other types of religion; around 90% of the population may be either irreligious or involved in Chinese folk religions (cults of nature deities and ancestors), Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, folk religious sects.

The significant Manchu population, although strongly assimilated to the Han Chinese and practicing Chinese religions, also retains its own pure Manchu shamanism. At the same time, the local religion of the Han people throughout Manchuria has developed patterns of deities, ideas, and practices inherited from Manchu and Tungus shamanism, making it quite different from central and southern Chinese folk religion. The Mongol ethnic minority either follows the Mongolian folk religion and shamanism, or Tibetan Buddhism.

== Tourism ==

The Mukden Palace was the palace of the Qing Dynasty emperors before they conquered the rest of China and moved their capital to Beijing. Though not as large nor as well known as its counterpart (the Forbidden City) in Beijing, the Mukden palace is significant for its representation of palace architecture at the time, and has recently been included on the UNESCO World Heritage Site as an extension of the Imperial Palace site in Beijing.

In addition, three imperial tombs dating from the Qing Dynasty are located in Liaoning. These tomb sites have been grouped with other Ming and Qing Dynasties tombs (such as the Ming Dynasty Tombs in Beijing, and the Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum in Nanjing) as a combined UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Wunu Mountain City, a Goguryeo site found in Huanren Manchu Autonomous County, is part of a combined UNESCO World Heritage Site that also includes sites in Ji&#x27;an, Jilin.

Benxi offers a boat ride through a large stalactite filled cave and underground river.

Anshan hosts the Jade Buddha Palace, the largest Buddha statue made of jade in the world.

Liaoyang, one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in northeast China, has a number of historical sites, including the White Pagoda (Baita), that dates to the Yuan Dynasty.

The port city of Dalian, located on the tip of the Liaodong Peninsula, is a tourist destination in its own right, with beaches, resorts, zoos, seafood, shopping, Russian- and Japanese-era heritage architecture, and streetcars, a rare sight in China.

Dandong, on the border with North Korea, is a medium-sized city that offers a cross-river view of the North Korean city of Sinŭiju.

Bijia Mountain is an island which joins to the mainland at low tide by a land bridge.

== Education and research ==
Liaoning is also one of China&#x27;s leading provinces in research and education. As of 2023, two major cities in Liaoning ranked in the world&#x27;s top 200 cities (Dalian 37th and Shenyang 124th) by scientific research output, as tracked by Nature Index.

<text>John Bird Sumner (25 February 1780 – 6 September 1862) was a bishop in the Church of England and Archbishop of Canterbury.

==Early life==
John Bird Sumner was born in Kenilworth, Warwickshire, on 25 February 1780. He was the eldest son of the Rev. Robert Sumner, Vicar of Kenilworth, and his wife Hannah Bird, a first cousin of William Wilberforce. His brother Charles Richard Sumner was Bishop of Winchester.

Sumner was educated at Eton College and King&#x27;s College, Cambridge.

==Career==
In 1802, Sumner became an assistant master at his alma mater, Eton College, where he was nicknamed &quot;Crumpety Sumner&quot; by the boys. He was ordained in 1803. He was elected a Fellow of Eton in 1817 and in 1818 the school presented him to the living of Mapledurham, Oxfordshire.

In 1819, he was chosen as a prebendary of the Durham diocese where he served until 1828, when he was consecrated to the episcopate as the Bishop of Chester. He was consecrated on 14 September 1828, by Edward Venables-Vernon-Harcourt, Archbishop of York, at York Minster. During his episcopacy many churches and schools were built in the diocese.

===Archbishop of Canterbury===

In 1848 he was elevated to Archbishop of Canterbury (under which title he signed documents as &quot;J B Cantuar&quot;) with an annual income of £15,000.

Shortly after taking his seat in the House of Lords he voted for Catholic emancipation, which brought him into conflict with many of the clergy in his diocese.

In 1851, Sumner led the religious service at the formal opening of the Great Exhibition in &quot;The Crystal Palace&quot; in Hyde Park.

Sumner&#x27;s numerous writings were much esteemed, especially by the evangelical party to which he belonged. His best known writings are his &quot;Treatise on the Records of Creation and the Moral Attributes of the Creator&quot; (London, 1816) and &quot;The Evidence of Christianity derived from its Nature and Reception&quot; (London, 1821).

In the Gorham Case, Sumner came into conflict with Henry Phillpotts, Bishop of Exeter (1778–1869), who accused him of supporting heresy and refused to communicate with him. He supported the Divorce Bill in parliament but opposed the Deceased Wife&#x27;s Sister Bill and the bill for removing Jewish disabilities. His obituary in the Norfolk News of 13 September 1862 commented that &quot;he strongly opposed the admission of Jews into parliament ... and was among the foremost to denounce the Puseyite school of theology&quot;.

Sumner was president of the Canterbury Association, which founded Christchurch, New Zealand. In 1848 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.

==Personal life==
On 31 March 1803, Sumner married Marianne Robertson (1779-1829) in the parochial chapel of St Mary Walcot, Bath, Somerset. She was the daughter of George Robertson of Edinburgh (1742-1791), a captain in the Royal Navy, and Ann (née Lewis) Robertson (1748-1802). His wife&#x27;s maternal grandparents were Francis Lewis, a New York signatory of the Declaration of Independence, and Elizabeth (née Anessley) Lewis. Sumner and wife had at least nine children:

* Anne Sumner (1805–1833), who married John Adair Griffith Colpoys, son of Vice Admiral Edward Griffith Colpoys. 
* Louisa Elizabeth Sumner (1806-)
* Eliza Maria Sumner (1808–1836), mother of the cricketer John Sumner Gibson.
* Caroline Sumner (1811–1811), who died in infancy.
* Georgina Sumner (1814–1881), who married Wilson Dobie Wilson.
* Caroline Sumner (1816–1841), a twin.
* Maria Sumner (1816–1861), a twin.
* The Rev. John Henry Robertson Sumner (1821–1910), father of the footballer John Robert Edwards Sumner.
* Robert George Moncrieff Sumner (1824–1885).

Marianne Sumner died at the Manor House, Wandsworth, on 22 March 1829. Sumner died on 6 September 1862 at Addington Palace, aged 82, and was buried on 12 September in the graveyard of St Mary&#x27;s Church, Addington. Two daughters and other relatives are interred at the north-east corner of the churchyard.

===Legacy===
A portrait of Sumner hangs in the hall of University College, Durham; another, in his convocation robes, by Eddis, is at Lambeth Palace; a replica of this is in the hall at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge. A portrait by Margaret Carpenter was engraved by Samuel Cousins in 1839. A later portrait by the same artist was engraved by T. Richardson Jackson. Francis Holl executed an engraving of another portrait of him by George Richmond. A recumbent effigy by H. Weekes, R.A., funded by public subscription after Sumner&#x27;s death, is in the nave of Canterbury Cathedral.

Archbishop Sumner Church of England Primary School in Lambeth is named in his memory.

<text>Nuenen () is a town in the municipality of Nuenen, Gerwen en Nederwetten in the Netherlands. From 1883 to 1885, Vincent van Gogh lived and worked in Nuenen. In 1944, a battle was fought there during Operation Market Garden. The local dialect is called Peellands. In 2009, Nuenen had a population of 22,437.

== History ==
Nuenen is listed in the 1792 Gazetteer of the Netherlands, which lists it as &quot;a village of Brabant, two leagues W. from Helmont&quot;.

===World War II===
During Operation Market Garden on 20 September 1944, Nuenen was the scene of a battle involving the American 506th PIR of the 101st Airborne Division and the British 15th/19th The King&#x27;s Royal Hussars of the 11th Armoured Division equipped with Cromwell tanks, against the German 107th Panzer Brigade. The British lost two tanks. Four American and three British soldiers were killed. The Germans suffered two fatalities.
The fight is dramatised in episode 4 &quot;Replacements&quot; of the television series &quot;Band of Brothers&quot;.

== Dialect ==
The spoken language is Peellands (an East Brabantian dialect, which is very similar to colloquial Dutch).

== Notable residents ==

In 1882 Van Gogh&#x27;s father became a pastor in Nuenen and the family lived at the vicarage there. After a stay in Drenthe for several months, Van Gogh moved to live with his parents in December 1883 and stayed there until May 1885. 
During that time he painted many character studies of peasants and weavers that culminated in &quot;The Potato Eaters&quot;, and paintings of still life. He also painted his father&#x27;s church, vicarage and its garden, one such work being &quot;Congregation Leaving the Reformed Church in Nuenen&quot; (&quot;Het uitgaan van de hervormde kerk te Nuenen&quot;) depicting the church, which is situated in a park area on the corner of Papenvoort Street and Houtrijk Street in the north of Nuenen. This painting was stolen from the Van Gogh Museum in December 2002 and recovered in Italy in September 2016. There is a street named after it in the town, as well as a cafe, college and bar. A statue of Van Gogh is located in the central park of the town.

Theoretical computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra lived in Nuenen later in his life, and died there in 2002. The following year, the ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) PODC Influential Paper Award in distributed computing was renamed the Dijkstra Prize in his honour.

Dutch cyclist Steven Kruijswijk was also born in Nuenen and had lived there in his youth.

<doc id="155519" wikidata="Q233262" url="?curid=155519" title="House of Representatives (Netherlands)">
<text>The House of Representatives ( , literally &quot;Second Chamber of the States General&quot;, or simply ) is the lower house of the bicameral parliament of the Netherlands, the States General, the other one being the Senate. It has 150 seats, which are filled through elections using party-list proportional representation. The house is located in the Binnenhof in The Hague; it has temporarily moved to the former building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at Bezuidenhoutseweg 67 in The Hague while the Binnenhof is being renovated.

==Name==
Although the body is officially called the &quot;House of Representatives&quot; in English, it is not a direct translation of its official Dutch name, the &quot;Second Chamber of the States General&quot;, &quot;Second Chamber&quot; or more colloquially just the &quot;Chamber&quot;. Rather than &quot;representative&quot; (&quot;afgevaardigde&quot;), a member of the House is referred to as &quot;(Tweede) Kamerlid&quot;, or &quot;member of the (Second) Chamber&quot;.

==Functions==
The House of Representatives is the primary legislative body of the States General, where proposed legislation is discussed and the actions of the cabinet are reviewed. Both the Cabinet and the House of Representatives itself have the right to propose legislation; the House of Representatives discusses it and, if adopted by a majority, sends it on to the Senate. Both individual cabinet ministers and the cabinet as a whole must have parliament’s confidence. Therefore, a minister, or the whole cabinet, must resign if a majority of parliament expresses it no longer has confidence in them. Review of the actions of the cabinet takes the form of formal interrogations in plenary and committee meetings, which may result in motions urging the cabinet to take, or refrain from, certain actions. No individual may be a member of both parliament and cabinet, except in a caretaker cabinet that has not yet been succeeded when a new House is sworn in.

=== EU decision making ===
Through functions like the scrutiny and political discussions before meetings of the Council of the European Union, the appointment of EU-rapporteurs, and participation in the Conference of Parliamentary Committees for Union Affairs the House of Representatives also plays a role in EU policy making.

=== Appointment of functionaries ===
The House of Representatives is also responsible for the first round of selection for judges to the Supreme Court of the Netherlands. It submits a list of three names for every vacant position to the Government. Furthermore, it elects the Dutch Ombudsman and their deputies.

==Elections==
The normal term of the House of Representatives is four years. Elections are called when the government loses the parliament&#x27;s confidence, the governing coalition breaks down, the term of the House of Representatives expires, or when no governing coalition can be formed.

===Registration and eligibility===
All citizens over the age of 18 are eligible to vote. Eligible citizens residing in the Netherlands are automatically registered through the municipal population register, while expatriates can permanently register at the municipality of The Hague provided they have a current Dutch passport or national ID. Residents of Aruba, Curaçao, and Sint Maarten can only vote if they have spent at least ten years residing in the Netherlands or work for the Dutch civil service.

Prisoners serving a term of more than one year are not eligible to vote. From 2009 onwards, mentally incapacitated citizens have regained the right to vote.

=== Electoral system ===

The Netherlands uses a system of party-list proportional representation. Seats are allocated among the parties using the D&#x27;Hondt method with an election threshold of 0.67% (a Hare quota). Parties may choose to compete with different candidate lists in each of the country&#x27;s twenty electoral circles. If a party competes with different candidate lists, the seats allocated to the party are subsequently allocated among its different candidate lists using the largest remainders method. The seats won by a list are first allocated to the candidates who, in preferential votes, have received at least 25% of the Hare quota (effectively ¼ of a seat or 0.17% of the total votes), regardless of their placement on the electoral list. If multiple candidates from a list pass this threshold, their ordering is determined based on the number of votes received. Any remaining seats are allocated to candidates according to their position on the electoral list.

From 1973 until 2017, parties were able to form electoral alliances to increase their share of seats in parliament, allowing parties to overcome some of the bias of the D&#x27;Hondt method; however, this practice has since been discontinued.

When a vacancy arises, the seat is offered to the next candidate on the candidate list to which the seat was originally allocated.

===Formation of governing coalition===
After all seats are allocated, a series of negotiations take place in order to form a government that, usually, commands a majority in the chamber. Since 2012, the House of Representatives appoints a &quot;scout&quot; to ask the major party leaders about prospective coalitions. On basis of the scout&#x27;s interviews, the House of Representatives then appoints an &quot;informateur&quot;, who checks out possible coalitions, and a &quot;formateur&quot;, who leads negotiations. Before 2012, the informateur and formateur were appointed by the monarch. It typically takes a few months before the &quot;formateur&quot; is ready to accept a royal invitation to form a government and become prime minister. All cabinet members must resign from parliament, as the constitution does not allow a cabinet member to simultaneously hold a seat in the House of Representatives.

Due to the nationwide party-list system and the low election threshold, a typical House of Representatives has ten or more parties represented. Such fragmentation makes it nearly impossible for one party to win the 76 seats needed for a majority in the House of Representatives. Since the current party-list proportional representation system was introduced in 1917, no party has approached the number of seats needed for an outright majority. This fragmentation also makes it almost prohibitively difficult to win enough seats to govern alone. The highest number of seats won by a single party since then has been 54 out of 150, by the CDA in 1986 and 1989. Between 1891 and 1897, the Liberal Union was the last party to have an absolute majority of seats in the House of Representatives. All Dutch cabinets since then have been coalitions of two or more parties.

==Composition==
===Historical compositions===

Historically, there have been 100 seats in the House of Representatives. In 1956, this number was increased to 150, at which it remains today.

To give an overview of the history of the House of Representatives, the figure on the right shows the seat distribution in the House from the first general elections after World War II (1946) to the most recent election. The left-wing parties are located towards the bottom, while the Christian parties are located in the center, and the right-wing parties towards the top. Occasionally, single-issue (or narrow-focus) parties have arisen, and these are shown at the extreme top. Vertical lines indicate general elections. Although these are generally held every four years, the resulting coalition governments do not always finish their term without a government crisis, which is often followed by new elections.

===Current composition===

The composition of the House of Representatives as of the 2023 general election is shown in the table below.


==Parliamentary committees==

Parliamentary committees are set up for a specific substantive or procedural subject. The committees consult in so-called committee meetings. A standing committee is a committee set up to monitor a policy area of a ministry. They are defined in the . Standing committees were established in 1953 to relieve the plenary of overly detailed discussions. In the period from the 2023 Dutch general election, there are a total of fifteen standing committees. Except for the Ministry of General Affairs, there is a permanent committee for each ministry that deals with subjects in the field of that ministry. For some ministries, the portfolio is divided over several committees. In addition, there are standing committees without a ministry for European Affairs and Digital Affairs.

<text>Shaanxi is a province in Northwestern China. It borders the province-level divisions of Inner Mongolia to the north, Shanxi and Henan to the east, Hubei, Chongqing, and Sichuan to the south, and Gansu and Ningxia to the west. Shaanxi covers an area of over with about 37 million people, the 16th-largest in China. Xi&#x27;anwhich includes the sites of the former capitals Fenghao and Chang&#x27;anis the provincial capital and largest city in Northwest China and also one of the oldest cities in China and the oldest of the Four Ancient Capitals, being the capital for the Western Zhou, Western Han, Jin, Sui and Tang dynasties. Xianyang, which served as the capital of the Qin dynasty (221–202 BC), is just north across the Wei River. The other prefecture-level cities into which the province is divided are Ankang, Baoji, Hanzhong, Shangluo, Tongchuan, Weinan, Yan&#x27;an and Yulin.

The province is geographically divided into three parts, namely Northern (or &quot;Shaanbei&quot;), Central (&quot;Shaanzhong&quot;) and Southern Shaanxi (or &quot;Shaannan&quot;). Northern Shaanxi makes up the southeastern portion of the Ordos Basin and mainly comprises the two prefectural cities of Yulin and Yan&#x27;an on the northern Loess Plateau, demarcated from the Ordos Desert and the grasslands of Inner Mongolia&#x27;s Ordos City by the Ming Great Wall. Central Shaanxi is also known as the Guanzhong region, and comprises the drainage basin of lower Wei River east of Mount Liupan and north of the Qinling Mountains, where the majority of Shaanxi&#x27;s population reside. Southern Shaanxi comprises the three prefectural cities in the edge of the historical Bashu region south of the Qinling Mountains and includes the three mountainous cities of Hanzhong, Ankang and Shangluo.

The area comprising Shaanxi, Shanxi, and Henan formed the cradle of Chinese civilization. During the Republican era, the city of Yan&#x27;an was near the endpoint of the Long March by the Chinese Red Army, who fled from Jiangxi after the Chinese Soviet Republic was destroyed by the Kuomintang armies, and became the birthplace of the Chinese Communist Revolution from late 1935 to early 1947 and the Communists formed the Shaan-Gan-Ning Border Region in constituent parts of Shaanxi.

The vast majority of the population of Shaanxi is Han Chinese, with Hui, Manchu and Mongol being the more significant ethnic minorities. Mandarin Chinese is the main spoken language in Shaanxi, including Central Plains Mandarin and Southwestern Mandarin dialects; another variety of Chinese, Jin Chinese, is also spoken in the regions neighboring Shanxi.

Shaanxi is China&#x27;s 15th largest economy, ranking within the middle tier among China&#x27;s administrative divisions. The fossil fuel and high technology sectors compose the two largest industries in Shaanxi Province. The high technology sector includes aircraft and aerospace industries and Shaanxi produces more than 50% of the R&amp;D and manufacturing equipment for the country&#x27;s domestic commercial aviation industry.

==Name==
The meaning of the province, &quot;Shan&#x27;s west&quot;, traces to circa 1000 BC when the Dukes of Shao and Zhou marked their borders along Shan plateau (, now Zhanbian plateau). In Chinese typing, the toponym often got mixed up with &quot;valley&quot; (note: distinguish and ). Simplified characters merged the two as .
The alphabet rendering of Shaanxi and its neighboring province Shanxi are troublesome in Beijing Mandarin because their pronunciation differs only in tone (rendered as Shǎnxī and Shānxī in pinyin transcription, 1958). To avoid confusion, mainland China recognized the Gwoyeu Romatzyh transcription (1928) for , &quot;Shaan&quot;.

Nonetheless, the vowels and consonants of and are distinguished in the more conservative Jin Chinese languages native to the two provinces, as shown on the chart to the right (refer to for further information). This conservative phonology is reflected in the historical spelling of Shaanxi, &quot;Shensi&quot;, known to the Europeans in the 18th century. &quot;Shensi&quot; was recognized in the 1906 Chinese postal romanization. &quot;Shensi&quot; continued to be popular until 1987 when the PRC banned pre-PRC romanizations.

==History==

Shaanxi is considered one of the cradles of Chinese civilization. Thirteen feudal dynasties established their capitals in the province during a span of more than 1,100 years, from the Zhou dynasty to the Tang dynasty.

The province&#x27;s principal city and current capital, Xi&#x27;an, is one of the four great ancient capitals of China and is the eastern terminus of the Silk Road, which leads to Europe, the Arabian Peninsula, and Africa.

The region was briefly governed as the Three Qins after the fall of the Qin dynasty. This is the origin of one of Shaanxi&#x27;s two abbreviations, (&quot;Qin&quot;), the other being (&quot;Shaan&quot;). Then it was conquered by Liu Bang during the Chu-Han Contention. Under the Han dynasty, the Northern Silk Road was expanded to advance exploration and military purposes to the west. This Northern Silk Road is the northernmost of the Silk Roads and is about in length. It connected the ancient Chinese capital of Xi&#x27;an to the west over the Wushao Ling Pass to Wuwei and emerging in Kashgar before linking to ancient Parthia.

The Xiongnu-led kingdom Northern Xia (407–431) set its capital in Tongwancheng.

The Northern Song dynasty and the Tangut-led Western Xia contested their border in Shaanxi. Western Xia found the Luōwùchéng (罗兀城) frontier fort in 1071 but was taken by Song in 1081.

Under the Ming dynasty, Shaanxi was established with the founding of the Shaanxi Provincial Administration Commission in 1376, whose administration also included the modern provinces of Gansu, Ningxia, and part of Qinghai. During this dynasty, most visitors from Central and West Asia entered the country via Shaanxi.

One of the most devastating earthquakes in history occurred near Hua Shan in southeastern Shaanxi on January 23, 1556, killing an estimated 830,000 people (see 1556 Shaanxi earthquake).

The end of the short-lived Jiangxi Soviet signaled the beginning of the Long March by Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communists to the Shaanxi Soviet at Yan&#x27;an.

The administrative evolution of Shaanxi: The Northern Song established the Shaanxi Lu (circuit), governed from modern Xi&#x27;an in 997. The Yuan dynasty established Shaanxi Province (Yuan dynasty), governed by a Branch Secretariat in 1286. After the founding of the Qing dynasty, Gansu was split from Shaanxi, but both provinces were governed under the Viceroy of Shaan-Gan.

===Prehistoric site===
The Lantian Man site, with hominin fossils from approximately one million years ago, was found in Lantian County in northwestern Shaanxi province, near the city of Xi&#x27;an. Scientists classify Lantian Man as a subspecies of &quot;Homo erectus&quot;. The fossils are displayed at the Shaanxi History Museum, Xi&#x27;an, China.

==Geography==

The geography of the area is described as being part of the Ordos Desert in the north along the border with Inner Mongolia, the Loess Plateau in the central part of the province, the Qin Mountains (Qinling) running east to west in the south central part, and subtropical climate south of the Qinling. In between the Loess Plateau and the Qinling lies the Wei River Valley, or Guanzhong, a cradle of early Chinese civilization.

Going clockwise, Shaanxi borders Shanxi (E, NE), Henan (E), Hubei (SE), Chongqing (S), Sichuan (SW), Gansu (W), Ningxia (NW), and Inner Mongolia (N). In terms of number of bordering provincial-level divisions, Shaanxi ties Inner Mongolia.

Due to its large span in latitude, Shaanxi has a variety of climates. Under the Köppen climate classification, the northern parts, including the Loess Plateau, have either a cold arid (Köppen &quot;BWk&quot;) or cold semi-arid (Köppen &quot;BSk&quot;), with cold and very dry winters, dry springs and autumns, and hot, humid summers. The area known as Guanzhong is mostly semi-arid, though there are a few areas with a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cwa&quot;), with cool to cold winters, and hot, humid summers that often see early-season heatwaves. The southern portion is much more humid and lies in the humid subtropical zone, with more temperate winters and long, hot, humid summers. Annual mean temperature is roughly between , with January temperatures ranging from and July temperatures ranging from .

Besides the provincial capital of Xi&#x27;an, other cities include: Baoji, Hanzhong, Lintong, Tongchuan, Xianyang, Yan&#x27;an and Ankang.

==Administrative divisions==
Shaanxi consists of ten prefecture-level divisions: all prefecture-level cities (including a sub-provincial city):

The ten prefecture-level cities of Shaanxi are subdivided into 107 county-level divisions (30 districts, four county-level cities, and 73 counties).

=== Urban areas ===

== Politics ==

The politics of Shaanxi is structured in a triple party-government system like all other governing institutions in mainland China.

The Governor of Shaanxi is the highest-ranking official in the People&#x27;s Government of Shaanxi. However, in the province&#x27;s dual party-government governing system, the Governor is considered to have less power than the Shaanxi Chinese Communist Party Provincial Committee Secretary (), colloquially termed the &quot;Shaanxi CCP Party Chief&quot;; since the Governor is always ranked as the First-Deputy Secretary in the Shaanxi Chinese Communist Party Provincial Committee.

Shaanxi was established as a provincial government since Qing dynasty. On 10 January 1950, the People&#x27;s Government of Shaanxi was established in Xi&#x27;an. Ma Minfang was then appointed as the first Governor of Shaanxi.

==Economy==
As of the mid-19th century, Shaanxi exported animal skins, wine, liquor, and musk. Money loans were also common, with Shaanxi business people involved in the Guangzhou loan business. Shaanxi commonly imported European animal skins, watches, Chinese language books, and cloth.

Shaanxi was a major recipient of China&#x27;s investment in industrial capacity during the Third Front campaign.

The fossil fuel and high technology sectors compose the two largest industries in Shaanxi province. During 2009, the province ranked third in China for production of coal, natural gas and crude oil. As the home of several of the leading universities and research institutes in Western China, Shaanxi province also plays a major role in China&#x27;s burgeoning aircraft and aerospace industries, producing more than 50% of the R&amp;D and manufacturing equipment for the country&#x27;s domestic commercial air industry. Nominal GDP for 2011 was 1,239 billion RMB (US$196.7 billion) and GDP per capita was 21,729 RMB (US$3,179), ranking 17th in the PRC.

In the first half of 2019, Shaanxi&#x27;s total production value reached 1,162.557 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 5.4%. The added value of the primary industry was 55.319 billion yuan, an increase of 4.5%; the second industry was 557.935 billion yuan, an increase of 4.2%; the tertiary industry was 549.303 billion yuan, an increase of 6.8%.

===Economic and technological development zones===
====Baoji Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone====
Established in 1992, Baoji Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone was approved as a national hi-tech zone by the State Council. It has a long-term planned area of .

XEPZ is under the leadership of the Administrative Committee of Xi&#x27;an Economic and Technological Development Zone (XETDZ), which is designated by Xi&#x27;an municipal government to exercise economic and administrative power within the zone. XEPZ is a special economic zone. By now, there are more than 40 enterprises home and abroad settled in XEPZ. The pillar industries feature aviation, machinery, electronics and new energy.

====Western Triangle====
The Western Triangle is a new economic zone composing the three major city-level economies of Western China: Xi&#x27;an, Chongqing and Chengdu. It is believed that the addition of Xi&#x27;an to the Triangle will spur economic growth in the region and allow the city an opportunity to capitalize on the commercial potential of its high-technology industries.

====Xi&#x27;an Economic and Technological Development Zone====
Established in 1993, Xi&#x27;an Economic and Technology Development Zone was approved as a national zone in 2000. The zone is 20 minutes from Xi&#x27;an Xianyang International Airport, and national highways pass through. It has formed four pillar industries: automotive, electronics, food, and new materials industries. So far, the zone has attracted more than 1,700 enterprises.

====Xi&#x27;an High-tech Industrial Development Zone====
Xi&#x27;an HTDZ opened its gates in 1991. It was established as a &quot;pivotal location&quot; for investment by high-tech industry companies in central and northwest China. Established in 1991, Xi&#x27;an Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone is a national high-tech zone. It is surrounded by national highways and it is 30 minutes from Xi&#x27;an-Xianyang International Airport. Furthermore, it is ranked in the top three high-tech zones in China.

<text>Archibald Campbell Tait (21 December 18113 December 1882) was an Archbishop of Canterbury in the Church of England and theologian. He was the first Scottish Archbishop of Canterbury and thus, head of the Church of England.

==Life==
Tait was born on Saturday, 21 December 1811, at 2 Park Place in Edinburgh, Scotland, the son of Crauford Tait WS of Harviestoun (1766–1832) and his wife, Susan Campbell (1777–1814) daughter of Lord Ilay Campbell.

He was educated at the High School in Edinburgh and from 1824 at the newly completed Edinburgh Academy, where he was school dux 1826/7. His parents were Presbyterians but he early turned towards the Scottish Episcopal Church. He was confirmed in his first year at Oxford, having entered Balliol College in October 1830 as a Snell Exhibitioner from the University of Glasgow. He won an open scholarship, took his degree with a first-class in &quot;Literae Humaniores&quot; (classics) in 1833 and became a fellow and tutor of Balliol. He was ordained deacon in 1836 and priest in 1838 and served a curacy at Marsh Baldon.

Rapid changes among the fellows found him, at age 26, &quot;the senior and most responsible of the four Balliol tutors.&quot; The experience gained during this period stood him in good stead afterwards as a member of the first Oxford University Commission (1850–52). He never sympathised with the principles of the Oxford Movement and, on the appearance of Tract 90 in 1841, he drafted the famous protest of the &quot;Four Tutors&quot; against it; but this was his only important contribution to the controversy. On the other hand, although his sympathies were on the whole with the liberal movement in the university, he never took a lead in the matter.

In 1842, he became an undistinguished but useful successor to Arnold as headmaster of Rugby School (one of his pupils was Lewis Carroll); and a serious illness in 1848, the first of many, led him to welcome the comparative leisure that followed upon his appointment to the deanery of Carlisle in 1849. His life there, however, was one of no little activity; he served on the University Commission, he restored his cathedral, and he did much excellent pastoral work. There, too, he suffered the great sorrow of his life. He had married Catharine Spooner at Rugby in 1843. She had opposed him becoming headmaster at Rugby because of differences in their belief, but she still married him. In fact Catharine was a great support to him and on her own account she helped the poor in the town and established a school for girls. In 1856, within five weeks, five of their nine children died due to virulent scarlet fever. Two were spared and in time they were joined by another two siblings.

Not long afterwards, he was consecrated Bishop of London on 22 November 1856 at the Chapel Royal, Whitehall, by John Bird Sumner, Archbishop of Canterbury, as successor to Charles James Blomfield. His translation to Canterbury in 1868 (he had refused the archbishopric of York in 1862) constituted a recognition of his work but made no break in it. His last years were interrupted by illness and saddened by the death in 1878 of his only son, Craufurd (1848–1878), and of his wife, Catharine née Spooner (1819–1878). Five of his eight daughters also died in childhood. Tragically all died of scarlet fever in 1856, within a few days of each other.

==Notable accomplishments==

If Blomfield had almost remodelled the idea of a bishop&#x27;s work, his successor surpassed him. Tait had all Blomfield&#x27;s earnestness and his powers of work, with far wider interests. Blomfield had given himself zealously to the work of church-building; Tait followed in his steps by inaugurating (1863) the Bishop of London&#x27;s Fund. He devoted a very large part of his time at London in actual evangelistic work; and, to the end, his interest in the pastoral side of the work of the clergy was greater than anything else. With his wife, he was instrumental in organising women&#x27;s work upon a sound basis, and he did not a little for the healthful regulation of Anglican sisterhoods during the formative period in which this was particularly necessary. Nor was he less successful in the larger matters of administration and organisation, which brought into play his sound practical judgment and strong common-sense. He was constant in his attendance in parliament and spared no pains in pressing on measures of practical utility. The modification of the terms of clerical subscription (1865), the new lectionary (1871), the Burials Act (1880) were largely owing to him; for all of them, and especially the last, he incurred much obloquy at the time.

===Dealings with liberalism===
With regard to the liberal trend in modern thought, he was in sympathy with it. His object in dealing with questions of faith, as in dealing with the ritual question, was primarily a practical one: he wished to secure peace and obedience to the law as he saw it. Consequently, after his sympathies had led him to express himself favourably towards some movement, he frequently found himself compelled to draw back.

He expressed a qualified sympathy with some of the writers of &quot;Essays and Reviews&quot; and then joined in the censure of it by the bishops (1861). The same kind of apparent vacillation was found in his action in other cases; e.g., in the case of John William Colenso (1863) and in the controversy as to the use or disuse of the Athanasian symbol (1872). It was naturally and widely misunderstood. Some who did not know him thought, or pretended to think, that he was a Socinian or a free-thinker. The world at large knew better; but even Frederick Temple warned him, in the case of &quot;Essays and Reviews, &quot;You will not keep friends if you compel them to feel that in every crisis of life they must be on their guard against trusting you.&quot;

===Dealings with the Oxford Movement===
As regards the Catholic revival, Tait was concerned with it during the whole of his episcopate and, above all, on the issue of ritualism, on which it naturally came into most direct conflict with the recognised ecclesiastical practice of the day. He had to deal with the St George&#x27;s-in-the-East protests, in 1859, and the troubles at St Alban&#x27;s, Holborn, in their earlier stages (1867); he took part as assessor in the Privy Council judgment in the Ridsdale case (1877); he was more closely concerned than any other bishop with the agitation against confession in 1858 and again in 1877.

His method throughout was the same: he endeavoured to obtain a compliance to the law as declared by the courts; failing this, he made the most earnest efforts to secure obedience to the ruling of the Ordinary for the sake of the peace of the Church; after this, he could do nothing. He did not perceive how much of reason the &quot;ritualists&quot; had on their side: that they were fighting for practices which, they contended, were covered by the letter of the rubric; and that, where rubrics were notoriously disregarded on all hands, it was not fair to proceed against one class of delinquent only. In fact, if others were inclined to ignore it altogether, Tait could hardly realise anything but the connection between the English Church and the State. From such a position there seemed to be no escape but in legislation for the deprivation of the recalcitrant clergy; and the Public Worship Regulation Act 1874 was the result.
For this Tait was by no means responsible as a whole: some of the provisions which proved most irksome were the result of amendments by Lord Shaftesbury which the bishops were unable to resist; and it must be borne in mind that the most disastrous results of the measure were not contemplated by those who were instrumental in passing it. The results followed inevitably: clergy were cited before a new tribunal, and not only deprived but imprisoned. A widespread feeling of indignation spread not only among High Churchmen, but among many who cared little or nothing for the ritual practices involved; and it seemed impossible to foretell what the outcome would be. But the aged archbishop was moved as much as anybody, and tried hard to mitigate such a state of things.

At length, when the Rev. AH Mackonochie was on the point of being deprived of his benefice of St. Alban&#x27;s, Holborn, for contumacy, the archbishop, then on his deathbed at Addington Palace, took steps which resulted in the carrying out of an exchange of benefices (which had already been projected), which removed him from the jurisdiction of the court. This proved to be the turning-point; and although the ritual difficulty by no means ceased, it was afterwards dealt with from a different point of view, and the Public Worship Regulation Act became practically obsolete.

==Death and legacy==
Archbishop Tait died on 3 December (the first day of Advent) in 1882 at Addington, London. He is buried in the churchyard of St Mary the Blessed Virgin in Addington. The grave is marked by a large Gothic style Celtic cross on a stepped base and is by far the largest monument in the churchyard.

Tait was a Churchman by conviction; but, although the work of his life was all done in England, he remained a Scotsman to the end. It was the opinion of some that he never really understood the historical position of the English Church and took no pains to learn. John Tillotson, one of his predecessors in the archbishopric, was a favourite hero of his, and in some ways the two men resembled one another. Tait had none of Tillotson&#x27;s gentleness, and he rode roughshod over the obstacles in his way. He cannot be called a great ecclesiastical statesman, but he administered his office well and was undoubtedly one of the foremost public men of his day.

His daughter Edith Murdoch Tait (1858–1936) married Randall Davidson who (partly due to Tait&#x27;s influence) was later also Archbishop of Canterbury.

==Memorials==
After his death, a stone monument with bronze bust was erected in Edinburgh, on the site of the house in which he was born, west of the University of Edinburgh&#x27;s McEwan Hall on the rear of the Edinburgh Medical Faculty facing Teviot Row. The monument survives but is in a hidden location away from public roads.

His most important memorial stands in Westminster Abbey: a white marble bust by H. H. Armstead erected in 1884 in the south transept.

Addington Palace survives but was converted into use as a golf course in the 1930s.

<text>Kenneth Howard Norton Sr. (August 9, 1943 – September 18, 2013) was an American actor and professional boxer who competed from 1967 to 1981. He was awarded the WBC world heavyweight championship in 1978, after winning a close split decision over Jimmy Young in a title eliminator bout, after which Leon Spinks refused to fight with him.

He is best known for his fights with Muhammad Ali, in which Norton won the first by split decision, lost the second by split decision, and lost the final by a controversial unanimous decision. Norton also fought a slugfest with Larry Holmes in 1978 during the first defense of his championship, narrowly losing a split decision and his WBC title.

Norton retired from boxing in 1981, and was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1992.

==Early life==
Norton was an outstanding athlete at Jacksonville High School in Jacksonville, Illinois. He was selected to the all-state football team on defense as a senior in 1960. His track coach entered him in eight events, and Norton placed first in seven. As a result, the &quot;Ken Norton Rule&quot;, which limits participation of an athlete to a maximum of four track and field events, was instituted in Illinois high school sports. After graduating from high school, Norton went to Northeast Missouri State University (now Truman State University) on a football scholarship and studied elementary education. In an interview with &quot;ESPN Fitness Magazine&quot; in 1985, Norton said that he would have become a teacher or a policeman if he had not taken up boxing.

==Amateur career==
Norton enlisted into the United States Marines Corps after leaving school, serving from 1963 to 1967. Norton was a manual morse intercept (MOS 2621), graduating from NCTC Corry Station, Pensacola, Florida. During his time with the Corps, he took up boxing, compiling a 24–2 record en route to three all-Marine heavyweight titles. In time, he became the best boxer to ever fight for the Corps and was awarded the North Carolina AAU Golden Gloves, International AAU, and Pan American titles. Following the National AAU finals in 1967, he turned professional.

==Professional career==
Norton built up a steady string of wins, some against journeyman fighters and others over fringe contenders like the giant Jack O&#x27;Halloran. He suffered a surprise defeat in 1970 just after &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine had profiled him as a prospect, to heavy-hitting Venezuelan boxer Jose Luis Garcia, who was unknown at the time. Garcia floored Norton five times, before Norton was eventually knocked out. Norton overpowered and avenged his loss to Garcia in their rematch five years later, when both were rated contenders.

Norton was given the motivational book &quot;Think and Grow Rich&quot; by Napoleon Hill, which he said &quot;changed my life dramatically. I was going to fight Muhammad Ali. I was a green fighter, but yet I won, all through reading this book.&quot; Upon reading &quot;Think and Grow Rich&quot;, he went on a 14-fight winning streak, including the shock victory over Muhammad Ali in 1973 to win the North American Boxing Federation heavyweight champion title. Norton said, &quot;These words [from Napoleon Hill&#x27;s &quot;Think and Grow Rich&quot;] were the final inspiration in my victory over Ali: &#x27;Life&#x27;s battles don&#x27;t always go to the stronger or faster man, but sooner or later the man who wins is the man who thinks he can&#x27;.&quot; Norton also took a complete course by Hill on gaining wealth and peace of mind. &quot;It can be related to anybody, to be the best in a career, to think positive&quot;, said Norton.

In an article which appeared in &quot;The Southeast Missourian&quot; Norton said, &quot;One thing I do is only watch films of the fights in which I&#x27;ve done well or in which my opponent has done poorly.&quot; He also said, &quot;In boxing, and in all of life, nobody should ever stop learning!&quot;

=== Rise to prominence ===
====Norton vs. Ali I, II====

Norton’s opponents were elusive in his early career. His first big break came with a clear win over respected contender Henry Clark, which helped him gain world recognition. His big break was when Ali agreed to a match. Joe Frazier, who&#x27;d sparred with Norton and defeated Ali, presciently said of Ali, &quot;He&#x27;ll have plenty of trouble!&quot; Though both were top boxers in the mid-1970s, Norton and Frazier never fought each other, in part because they shared the same trainer, Eddie Futch, and also because they were good friends and didn&#x27;t want to fight each other.

For the first match, on March 31, 1973, Muhammad Ali entered the ring at the San Diego Sports Arena wearing a robe given to him by Elvis Presley, as a 5-1 favorite versus Norton, then rated a number 6 world contender in a bout televised by ABC&#x27;s &quot;Wide World of Sports&quot;. Norton won a 12-round split decision over Ali in his adopted hometown of San Diego to win the NABF heavyweight title. In this bout, Norton broke Ali&#x27;s jaw in the second round causing Ali to fight defensively for the remaining 10 rounds. This led to only the second defeat for &quot;The Greatest&quot; in his career. (Ali&#x27;s only previous loss was to Frazier, and Ali would later go on to defeat George Foreman to regain the heavyweight title in 1974.)

Almost six months later at The Forum in Inglewood, California, on September 10, 1973, Ali won a close split decision. Norton weighed in at 206 lbs (5 pounds lighter than his first match with Ali) and some boxing writers suggested that his preparation was too intense and that perhaps he had overtrained. There were some furious exchanges in this hard-fought battle. From Ali&#x27;s point of view, a loss here would have seriously dented his claim of ever being &quot;The Greatest&quot;. During the ABC broadcast of the fight, broadcaster (and Ali confidant and friend) Howard Cosell repeatedly told viewers a dancing and jabbing Ali was dominating the action despite Norton&#x27;s constant offense and Ali&#x27;s inability to penetrate Norton&#x27;s awkward crab-like cross-armed defensive style. The close scoring and decision favoring Ali were both controversial.

====Norton vs. Foreman====

In 1974, Norton fought Foreman for the world heavyweight championship at the Poliedro de Caracas in Caracas, Venezuela, suffering a second-round knockout. After an even first round, Foreman staggered Norton with an uppercut a minute into round two, pushing him into the ropes. Norton did not hit the canvas, but continued on wobbly legs, clearly not having recovered. He shortly went down a further two times in quick succession, with the referee intervening and stopping the fight.

=== Career peak ===
====Norton vs. Quarry====
In 1975, Norton regained the NABF heavyweight title when he impressively defeated Jerry Quarry by TKO in the fifth round, although being hurt by a left-hook to the body in the second round. Norton would go on to dominate Quarry for the remainder of the fight, until the referee stopped the fight in the Fifth Round. Norton then avenged his 1970 loss to Jose Luis Garcia by decisively knocking out Garcia in round five, flooring Garcia five times with shots to the mid-section before Garcia was counted out.

====Norton vs. Ali III====
On September 28, 1976, Norton fought his third and final bout against Ali at Yankee Stadium in New York City. Since their last meeting Ali had regained the world heavyweight championship title with an eighth-round knockout of George Foreman in 1974. Many observers have felt this fight marked the beginning of Ali&#x27;s decline as a boxer. The Norton bout was a tough bruising battle for Ali. In one of the most disputed fights in history, the contest was even on the judges&#x27; scorecards going into the final round, which Ali won on both the referee&#x27;s and judges&#x27; scorecards to retain the championship. The two judges, Harold Lederman and Barney Smith, scored the bout 8–7 for Ali, while referee Arthur Mercante scored it 8–6-1 for Ali. At the end of the last round, the commentator announced he would be &quot;very surprised&quot; if Norton had not won the fight.

At the time of the bout, the last time a heavyweight champion had lost the title by decision was Max Baer to Jimmy Braddock, 41 years earlier. The January 1998 issue of &quot;Boxing Monthly&quot; listed Ali-Norton as the fifth most disputed title fight decision in boxing history. The unofficial United Press International scorecard was 8–7 for Norton, and the unofficial Associated Press scorecards were 9–6 for Ali (Ed Schuyler), and 8–7 Norton (Wick Temple).

Despite earning a victory, Ali received a pounding. His tactics were to try to push Norton back, but they had failed. He&#x27;d refused to &#x27;dance&#x27; until the 9th. Norton has said the third fight with Ali was the last boxing match for which he was fully motivated, owing to his disappointment at having lost a fight he believed he had clearly won.

=== WBC heavyweight champion ===
====Norton vs. Young====
In 1977, Norton knocked out previously unbeaten top prospect Duane Bobick in one round. The fight had an interesting narrative to it, as Norton&#x27;s previous trainer, Eddie Futch, opted to train Bobick instead of Norton. Norton then dispatched European title holder, Lorenzo Zanon in a &#x27;tune-up&#x27; fight. Light-hitting but fast, Zanon was ahead on the scorecards until a barrage of right-overhands and looping-body shots put him down and out.

Norton then defeated polished number two contender Jimmy Young (who had beaten Foreman for the former champion&#x27;s second loss, as well as twice top heavyweight contender Ron Lyle) via 15-round split decision in a WBC title-elimination bout, with the winner to face reigning WBC champion Ali. (However, Ali&#x27;s camp told &quot;The Ring&quot; they did not want to fight Norton for a fourth time.) Both boxers fought a smart fight, with Norton using a heavy body attack whilst Young moved well and countered. The decision was controversial, with many observers thinking Young had done enough to win.

Although Norton was expected to face Ali for a fourth time, to fight for the WBC heavyweight championship, plans changed due to Ali&#x27;s loss of his title to Leon Spinks on February 15, 1978. The WBC then ordered a match between the new champion and Norton, its number one contender. Spinks however, chose to face Ali in his first title defence, instead of facing Norton. The WBC responded on March 18, 1978, by retroactively giving title fight status to Norton&#x27;s victory over Young the year before and awarding Norton their championship, which split the heavyweight championship for the first time since Jimmy Ellis and Joe Frazier were both recognized as champions in the early 1970s.

====Norton vs. Holmes====

In his first defense of the WBC title on June 9, 1978, Norton and new number one contender Larry Holmes met in a brutal 15-round fight. Holmes was awarded the title via an extremely close split decision. Two of the three judges scored the fight 143–142 for Holmes while the third scored the bout 143–142 for Norton. The Associated Press scored it 143–142 for Norton. The March 2001 edition of &quot;The Ring&quot; listed the final round of the Holmes–Norton bout as the seventh most exciting round in boxing history and International Boxing Research Organization (IBRO) member Monte D. Cox ranked the bout as the tenth greatest heavyweight fight of all time. Holmes went on to become the third-longest reigning world heavyweight champion in the history of boxing, behind Joe Louis and Wladimir Klitschko. Years later, Holmes wrote that the bout was his toughest fight of all his seventy-five contests.

=== Post-title career ===
====Norton vs. Shavers====
After losing to Holmes, Norton won his next fight by knockout over sixth-ranked Randy Stephens in 1978 before taking on legendary puncher Earnie Shavers in another compulsory WBC title eliminator fight in Las Vegas on March 23, 1979. Shavers took the former champion out in the first round. underscoring Norton&#x27;s difficulty with hard hitters such as Foreman, Shavers and later Cooney. However Norton himself always denied this, saying that he was past his prime when he was stopped by Shavers and Cooney.

====Scott LeDoux====
In his next fight, he fought to a split draw with unheralded but durable lower ranked contender Scott LeDoux at the Met Center in Minneapolis. Norton dominated until sustaining an injury when he took a thumb in the eye in the eighth round, which immediately changed the bout. LeDoux rallied from that point and Norton became decidedly fatigued. Norton was down two times in the final round, resulting in the draw; Norton fell behind on one scorecard, kept his lead on the second, and dropped to even on the third (the unofficial AP scorecard was 5–3–2 Norton).

====Tex Cobb====
After the fight, Norton decided that at 37 it was time to retire from boxing. However, not satisfied with the way he had gone out, Norton returned to the ring to face the undefeated Randall &quot;Tex&quot; Cobb in Cobb&#x27;s home state of Texas on November 7, 1980. In an all action back-and-forth fight, Norton escaped with a split decision, with referee Tony Perez and judge Chuck Hassett voting in his favor and judge Arlen Bynum giving the fight to Cobb. In the March 1981 issue of &quot;The Ring&quot;, Norton was still one of the world&#x27;s top ten ranked heavyweights.

===Final bout===
====Gerry Cooney====
The win over the title-contending Cobb gave Norton another shot at a potential title-fight, and on May 11, 1981, at Madison Square Garden he stepped into the ring with top contender Gerry Cooney, who, like Cobb, was undefeated entering the fight. Very early in the fight Norton was buckled by Cooney&#x27;s punches. Norton took a series of big punches from Cooney in his corner before Tony Perez stepped in to stop the 54 seconds into the first round, with Norton slumped against the ropes, leaving Cooney the victor by first-round technical knockout. Norton retired after the fight and turned to charitable pursuits.

==Boxing style==

Norton was a forward-pressing fighter who was notable for his unusual crab-like cross-armed defense. The boxers that use this style are often called inside-fighters, swarmers, and crowders by boxing fans. In this stance, his left arm was positioned low across the torso with his right hand up by the right or left ear. When under heavy pressure both arms were brought up high across at face level while leaning forward, covering his head and leaving little room for his opponent to extend his arms. The guard was also used by boxers Archie Moore and Tim Witherspoon, as well as by Frazier in parts of his third fight with Muhammad Ali and Foreman during his famous comeback years.

Norton would bob and weave from a crouch, firing well placed heavy punches. He was best when advancing, unconventionally dragging or sliding his right foot behind him, relying on immense upper body strength to deliver his heavy blows. By comparison, most conventional boxers have elbows in at the torso with forearms vertically parallel to each another, the gloves being both near sides of the face and driving off their rear foot to deliver power punches.

Angelo Dundee wrote that Norton&#x27;s best punch was the left hook. Many others lauded his overhand right. In a &quot;Ring Magazine&quot; article, Norton himself said that a right uppercut to Jerry Quarry was the hardest blow he recalled landing.

==Awards and recognitions==
Norton was a 1989 inductee of the World Boxing Hall of Fame, a 1992 inductee of the International Boxing Hall of Fame, a 2004 inductee into the United States Marine Corps Sports Hall of Fame, and a 2008 inductee into the World Boxing Council Hall of Fame.

The 1998 holiday issue of &quot;The Ring&quot; ranked Norton #22 among &quot;The 50 Greatest Heavyweights of All Time&quot;. Norton received the Boxing Writers Association of America J. Niel trophy for &quot;Fighter of the Year&quot; in 1977.

Norton also received the &quot;Napoleon Hill Award&quot; for positive thinking in 1973.

In 2001, Norton was inducted by the San Diego Hall of Champions into the Breitbard Hall of Fame, honoring San Diego&#x27;s finest athletes both on and off the playing surface. Norton was also inducted into the California Sports Hall of Fame in 2011.

==Later media career==

In 1975, at the peak of his boxing career, Norton made his acting debut starring in the Dino De Laurentiis blaxploitation film &quot;Mandingo&quot;, about a pre-Civil War slave purchased to fight other slaves for their master&#x27;s entertainment. After starring in the 1976 sequel, &quot;Drum&quot;, Norton went on to play bit parts in a dozen other productions.

Norton worked as an actor and TV boxing commentator following his retirement from boxing. He also was a member of the Sports Illustrated Speakers Bureau and started the Ken Norton Management Co., which represented athletes in contract negotiations.

Norton continued making TV, radio and public speaking appearances until suffering injuries in a near-fatal car accident in 1986 which left him with slow and slurred speech.

He appeared along with Ali, Foreman, Frazier and Holmes in a video, &quot;Champions Forever&quot;, discussing their best times, and in 2000 he published his autobiography, &quot;Going the Distance&quot;.

==Personal life==

Norton was married three times and had four children. Prior to his first marriage, he had a son named Keith. He married Jeannette Henderson in 1966 while still in the Marines. The marriage lasted until 1968 and produced football player and coach Ken Norton Jr. In 1977, he married Jacqueline &#x27;Jackie&#x27; Halton, who also had a son, Brandon, from a previous marriage. Jackie gave birth to daughter Kenisha (1976) and son Kene Jon (1981). They remained married for over 24 years before divorcing around 2000. Around 2012, he married Rose Marie Conant.

Norton was twice voted &quot;Father of the Year&quot; by the &quot;Los Angeles Sentinel&quot; and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; in 1977. To quote Norton from his biography, &quot;Believe: Journey From Jacksonville&quot;: &quot;Of all the titles that I&#x27;ve been privileged to have, the title of &#x27;dad&#x27; has always been the best.&quot;

His second son, Ken Norton Jr., played football at UCLA and had a long successful career in the NFL. In tribute to his father&#x27;s boxing career, Ken Jr. would strike a boxing stance in the end zone each time he scored a defensive touchdown and throw a punching combination at the goalpost pad.

Ken Norton&#x27;s son Keith Norton was once the weekend sports anchor for KPRC in Houston, Texas.

Norton died at a care facility in Las Vegas on September 18, 2013. He was 70 years old and had suffered a series of strokes in later years. Across the boxing world, tributes were paid, with Foreman calling him &quot;the fairest of them all&quot; and Holmes saying that he &quot;will be incredibly missed in the boxing world and by many&quot;. He was buried at Jacksonville East Cemetery, in Jacksonville, Illinois.

<text>Prokop Diviš O.Praem. (; 26 March 1698 – 21 December 1765) was a Czech canon regular, theologian and natural scientist. In an attempt to prevent thunderstorms from occurring, he inadvertently constructed one of the first grounded lightning rods.

==Early life==
He was born Václav Divíšek on 26 March 1698 in Helvíkovice, Bohemia (now Ústí nad Orlicí District, Czech Republic). As a child, he began his studies at the Jesuit gymnasium in the town. In 1716, at the age of 18, he entered a gymnasium run at the Premonstratensian abbey located in the village of Louka, where he completed his basic studies in 1719.

Divíšek then entered the novitiate of the abbey, taking the name Prokop (or Procopius). He completed this period of probation the following year and professed his religious vows in the Order. He then proceeded to study philosophy and theology in preparation for ordination to the Catholic priesthood, which occurred in 1726. From 1729 to 1735, he taught philosophy at the Abbey gymnasium. During this period, he was sent by his abbot to the Paris Lodron University in Salzburg (now the University of Salzburg) to pursue advanced studies in theology. In 1733, he completed his doctoral dissertation, and was granted the degree of Doctor of Theology.

Diviš then returned to his abbey and resumed the monastic life of a canon regular, serving as sub-prior of the abbey. In 1736, he was appointed as pastor of a parish in Přímětice (now part of Znojmo) which was served by the abbey. He served in that capacity for five years, before being recalled to the abbey in April 1741, where he served as its prior. During the spring of the following year, in the course of the First Silesian War, the abbot, Antonin Nolbek, was arrested by the forces of the Kingdom of Prussia and taken to a prison in Prussia. The payment of a large ransom by Diviš for the abbot&#x27;s release incurred his displeasure, leading him to return Diviš to the parish in Přímětice.

==Scientist==
Back at the parish, Diviš became responsible for the management of farmland belonging to it. He undertook the construction of water conduits on the property. As a result, he became interested in a popular new interest in the scientific community of his day, electricity. He began a series of experiments over the next few years, mostly on plant growth and therapy with small electrical voltages. He published the results and allegedly demonstrated at the Imperial Court in Vienna. Diviš also constructed the Denis d&#x27;or, which allegedly imitated the sounds of various musical instruments. This instrument is dated to 1753, though only one prototype was built, and it vanished soon after Diviš&#x27;s death. The novelty instrument produced electrical shocks as practical jokes for the player. It is disputed whether the Denis d&#x27;or sounds were also produced by electricity or if it was an otherwise acoustical instrument.

The news of the death of Georg Wilhelm Richmann, a professor in St. Petersburg who was killed by lightning in 1753 during his attempt at measuring the intensity of the electric field in the atmosphere, caused Diviš to become interested in atmospheric electricity. In letters, he proposed to several physicists (among them the Academies of Science in St. Petersburg and Vienna, as well as Leonhard Euler) to construct a &quot;weather&quot; machine&quot;—a device that would suppress and prevent thunderstorms and lightning by constantly sucking atmospheric electricity out of the air. His theories were already, in his time, recognized as fringe science, and thus ignored. When Diviš did not receive answers, he took it up on himself to build such a machine in his own parish.

On 15 June 1754 he erected a forty-meter-high, free-standing pole in Přímětice, on which he mounted his &quot;weather machine,&quot; consisting of several tin boxes and more than 400 metal spikes. A well-established theory at that time was that more pointed spikes would conduct electricity better. The pole was secured by heavy metal chains that inadvertently also grounded his construction, making it actually one of the first grounded lightning rods. He described his invention as being very effective at driving off storms: clouds formed when the pole was taken down and disappeared when erected again. He took these occasional observations as proof of his theory that the pointed spikes extracted latent electricity out of the atmosphere, deposing them safely before lightning could form. Several local newspapers and novelty papers from Southern Germany made reports on his attempts.

His findings were not well received in the scientific community, which largely decided to ignore him. In 1759, a drought threatened Přímětice&#x27;s farmers, who now took action against their priests&#x27; attempts to control the weather and consequently destroyed the first &quot;weather machine.&quot; This led to a dissent between Diviš and his &quot;unruly flock&quot; that only ended when the church superiors advised Diviš to stop his experiments. He was advised to unmount his second &quot;weather machine,&quot; which he had then, for security reasons mounted on the tower of his church, and hand it over to the Louka abbey.

Diviš continued to correspond with scientists and promote his own theory, which he called &quot;Magia naturalis&quot;. Fricker and Oetinger, two like-minded priests from Württemberg who had visited him during the experiments, helped him publish it abroad under the German name &quot;Längst verlangte Theorie von der meteorologischen Electricité&quot; &quot;(Much desired theory of the metereological electricity)&quot;, in the same year that Diviš died. Again, the theory was largely ignored, though Tetens reviewed them a few years after and called it a work of fantasy.

==Death and legacy==
Diviš died on 21 December 1765 in Přímětice.

After years of obscurity, the memory of Diviš was reignited in the late 19th century. Now seen as a visionary inventor, supporters see him as the European inventor of the lightning rod, who invented the lightning rod in the same years as Benjamin Franklin, probably even independently. Despite scientific reviews of Diviš&#x27;s errors (among others, German physicist Meidinger, who compared evidence about early lightning rods in 1888; and Czech scientific historians Smolka and Haubelt in 2004/05), there are still claims that Prokop Diviš invented the lightning rod. Indeed, his free-standing apparatus in 1754 was better grounded than Franklin&#x27;s experimental lightning rods at that time.

<text>A student is a person enrolled in a school or other educational institution.

In the United Kingdom and most commonwealth countries, a &quot;student&quot; attends a secondary school or higher (e.g., college or university); those in primary or elementary schools are &quot;pupils.&quot;
==Africa==

===Nigeria===
In Nigeria, education is classified into four systems known as a 6-3-3-4 system of education. It implies six years in primary school, three years in junior secondary, three years in senior secondary and four years in the university. However, the number of years to be spent in university is mostly determined by the course of study. Some courses have longer study lengths than others. Those in primary school are often referred to as pupils. Those in university, as well as those in secondary school, are referred to as students.

The Nigerian system of education also has other recognized categories like the polytechnics and colleges of education. The Polytechnic gives out National Diploma and Higher National Diploma certifications after two years and/or four years of study respectively.

A higher National Diploma (also known as HND) can be obtained in a different institution from where the National Diploma (also known as ND or OND) was obtained. However, the HND cannot be obtained without the OND certificate.

On the other hand, the respective colleges of education provide students with the Nigerian Certificate in Education (NCE) after two years of study.

===South Africa===
In South Africa, education is divided into four bands: the Foundation Phase (grades 1–3), the Intermediate Phase (grades 4–6), the Senior Phase (grades 7–9), and the Further Education and Training or FET Phase (grades 10–12). However, because this division is newer than most schools in the country, in practice, learners progress through three different types of school: Primary school (grades 1–3), Junior school (grades 4–7), and High school (grades 8–12). After the FET phase, learners who pursue further studies typically take three or four years to obtain an undergraduate degree or one or two years to achieve a vocational diploma or certificate. The number of years spent in university varies as different courses of study take different numbers of years. Those in the last year of high school (Grade 12) are referred to as &#x27;Matrics&#x27; or are in &#x27;Matric&#x27; and take the Grade 12 examinations accredited by the Umalusi Council (the South African board of education) in October and November of their Matric year. Exam papers are set and administered nationally through the National Department of Basic Education for government schools, while many (but not all) private school Matrics sit for exams set by the Independent Education Board (IEB), which operates with semi-autonomy under the requirements of Umalusi. (The assessment and learning requirements of both IEB and National exams are of roughly the same standard. The perceived better performance of learners within the IEB exams is largely attributable to their attending private, better-resourced schools with the much lower teacher: learner ratios and class sizes rather than because of fundamental differences in assessment or learning content). A school year for the majority of schools in South Africa runs from January to December, with holidays dividing the year into terms. Most public or government schools are 4-term schools and most private schools are 3-term school, but the 3-term government or public schools and 4-term private schools are not rare.

==Asia==
===Singapore===
Six years of primary school education in Singapore are compulsory.
* Primary School (Primary 1 to 6)
Primary 1 to 3 (aged 7–9 respectively, Lower primary) Primary 4 to 6 (aged 10–12 respectively, Upper primary)
* Secondary School (Secondary 1 to 4 or 5)
Sec 1s are 13, and Sec 4s are 16. Express Students take secondary school from Sec 1 to 4, and Normal Acad and Technical will take secondary school from Sec 1 to 5.
* Junior College (Junior College 1 to 2 – Optional) OR Polytechnic (3 years – Optional)

There are also schools which have the integrated program, such as River Valley High School (Singapore), which means they stay in the same school from Secondary 1 to Junior College 2, without having to take the &quot;O&quot; level examinations which most students take at the end of secondary school.

International schools are subject to overseas curriculums, such as the British, American, Canadian or Australian Boards.

===Bangladesh===

Primary education is compulsory in Bangladesh. It is a near crime to not to send children to primary school when they are of age, but it is not a punishable crime. Sending children to work instead of school is a crime, however. Because of the socio-economic state of Bangladesh, child labour is sometimes legal, but the guardian must ensure the primary education of the child. Anyone who is learning in any institute or even online may be called a student in Bangladesh. Sometimes students taking undergraduate education are called undergraduates and students taking post-graduate education may be called post-graduates.

Education system of Bangladesh:
===Brunei===
Education is free in Brunei. Darussalam not limited to government educational institutions but also private educational institutions. There are mainly two types of educational institutions: government or public, and private institutions. Several stages have to be undergone by the prospective students leading to higher qualifications, such as bachelor&#x27;s degree.

* Primary School (Year 1 to 6)
* Secondary School (Year 7 to 11)
* High School [or also known as the Sixth Form Centers] (Year 12 to 13)
* Colleges (Pre-University to Diploma)
* University Level (Undergraduate, Postgraduate and Professional)

It takes six and five years to complete the primary and secondary levels respectively. Upon completing these two crucial stages, students/pupils have freedom to progress to sixth-form centers, colleges or probably straight to employment. Students are permitted to progress towards university level programs in both government and private university colleges.

===Cambodia===
Education in Cambodia is free for all students who study in Primary School, Secondary School or High School.
* Primary School (Grade 1 to 6)
* Secondary School (Grade 7 to 9)
* High School (Grade 10 to 12)
* College (Year 1 to 3)
* University (Year 1 to 4 or 5)
After basic education, students can opt to take a bachelor&#x27;s (undergraduate) degree at a higher education institution (i.e. a college or university), which normally lasts for four years, though the length of some courses may be longer or shorter depending on the institution.

===India===

In India school is categorized in these stages: Pre-primary (Nursery, Lower Kindergarten or LKG, Upper Kindergarten or UKG), Primary (Class 1–5), Secondary (6–10) and Higher Secondary (11–12). For undergraduate it is 3 years except Engineering (BTech or BE), Pharmacy (B.pharm), Bsc agriculture which are 4-year degree course, Architecture (B.Arch.) which is a 5-year degree course, M.Sc. (5-year Integrated courses) and Medical (MBBS) which consists of a 4.5-year degree course and a 1-year internship, so 5.5 years in total.

===Nepal===
In Nepal 12-year school is categorised in two stages: Primary school (Grade 1 to Grade 8) and Higher Secondary school (Grade 9 to Grade 12). For college it averages four years for a bachelor&#x27;s degree (except BVSc and AH which are five year programmes and MBBS which is a five and half year programme) and two years master&#x27;s degree.

===Pakistan===
In Pakistan, 12-year school is categorized in three stages: Primary school, Secondary school and Higher Secondary school. It takes five years for a student to graduate from Primary school, five years for Secondary school and five years for Higher Secondary school (also called College). Most bachelor&#x27;s degrees span over four years, followed by a two years master&#x27;s degree.

===Philippines===
The Philippines is currently in the midst of a transition to a K-12 (also called K+12) basic education system. Education ideally begins with one year of kinder. Once the transition is complete, elementary or grade school comprises grades 1 to 6. Although the term &quot;student&quot; may refer to learners of any age or level, the term &#x27;pupil&#x27; is used by the Department of Education to refer to learners in the elementary level, particularly in public schools. Secondary level or high school comprises two major divisions: grades 7 to 10 will be collectively referred to as &#x27;junior high school&#x27;, whereas grades 11 to 12 will be collectively referred to as &#x27;senior high school&#x27;. The Department of Education refers to learners in grade 7 and above as &quot;students&quot;.

After basic education, students can opt to take a bachelor&#x27;s (undergraduate) degree at a higher education institution (i.e. a college or university), which normally lasts for four years though the length of some courses may be longer or shorter depending on the institution.

===Iran===

In Iran 12-year school is categorized in two stages: Elementary school and High school. It takes six years for a student to graduate from elementary school and six years for high school. High school study is divided into two part: junior and senior high school. In senior high school, students can choose between the following six fields: Mathematics and physics, Science, Humanities, Islamic science, Vocational, or Work and Knowledge. After graduating from high school, students acquire a diploma. Having a diploma, a student can participate in the Iranian University Entrance Exam or Konkoor in different fields of Mathematics, Science, Humanities, languages, and art. The university entrance exam is conducted every year by National Organization of Education Assessment, an organization under the supervision of the Ministry of Science, Research and Technology which is in charge of universities in Iran. Members of the Baháʼí Faith, a much-persecuted minority, are officially forbidden to attend university, in order to prevent members of the faith becoming doctors, lawyers or other professionals; however, Muslim, Christian, Jewish, and Zoroastrian people are allowed entry to universities.

==Oceania==

===Australia===
In Australia, Pre-school is optional for three and four year olds. At age five, children begin compulsory education at Primary School, known as Kindergarten in New South Wales, Preparatory School (prep) in Victoria, and Reception in South Australia, students then continue to year one through six (ages 6 to 12). Before 2014, primary school continued on to year seven in Western Australia, South Australia and Queensland. However, the state governments agreed that by 2014, all primary schooling will complete at year six. Students attend High School in year seven through twelve (ages 13 – 18). After year twelve, students may attend tertiary education at university or vocational training at TAFE (Technical and Further Education).

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand, after kindergarten or pre-school, which is attended from ages three to five, children begin primary school, &#x27;Year One&#x27;, at five years of age. Years One to Six are Primary School, where children commonly attend local schools in the area for that specific year group. Then Year Seven and Year Eight are Intermediate, and from Year Nine until Year Thirteen, a student would attend a secondary school or a college.

==Europe==
Europe uses the traditional, first form, second form, third form, fourth form, fifth form and six form grade system which is up to age eleven.

===Finland===

In Finland a student is called &quot;opiskelija&quot; (plural being &#x27;opiskelijat&#x27;), though children in compulsory education are called &quot;oppilas&quot; (plural being &#x27;oppilaat&#x27;). First level of education is &quot;esikoulu&quot; (literally &#x27;preschool&#x27;), which used to be optional, but has been compulsory since the beginning of year 2015. Children attend esikoulu the year they turn six, and next year they start attending &quot;peruskoulu&quot; (literally &quot;basic school&quot;, corresponds to American elementary school, middle school and junior high), which is compulsory. Peruskoulu is divided to &quot;alakoulu&quot; (years 1 through 6) and &quot;yläkoulu&quot; (years 7 through 9). After compulsory education most children attend second-level education (toisen asteen koulutus), either lukio (corresponds to high school) or ammattioppilaitos (Vocational School), at which point they are called students (opiskelija). Some attend &quot;kymppiluokka&quot;, which is a retake on some yläkoulu&#x27;s education.

To attend ammattikorkeakoulu (University of applied sciences) or a university a student must have a second-level education. The recommended graduation time is five years. First year students are called &quot;fuksi&quot; and students that have studied more than five years are called &quot;N:nnen vuoden opiskelija&quot; (Nth year student).

===France===
The generic term &quot;étudiant&quot; (lit. student) applies only to someone attending a university or a school of a similar level, that is to say pupils in a cursus reserved to people already owning a Baccalauréat. The general term for a person going to primary or secondary school is &quot;élève&quot;. In some French higher education establishments, a &quot;bleu&quot; or &quot;bizuth&quot; is a first-year student. Second-year students are sometimes called &quot;carrés&quot; (squares). Some other terms may apply in specific schools, some depending on the classe préparatoire aux grandes écoles attended.

===Germany===
In Germany, the German cognate term &quot;Student&quot; (male) or &quot;Studentin&quot; (female) is reserved for those attending a university. University students in their first year are called &quot;Erstsemester&quot; or colloquially &quot;Ersties&quot; (&quot;firsties&quot;). Different terms for school students exist, depending on which kind of school is attended by the student. The general term for a person going to school is &quot;Schüler&quot; or &quot;Schülerin&quot;. They begin their first four (in some federal estates six) years in primary school or &quot;Grundschule&quot;. They then graduate to a secondary school called &quot;Gymnasium&quot;, which is a university preparatory school. Students attending this school are called &quot;Gymnasiasten&quot;, while those attending other schools are called &quot;Hauptschüler&quot; or &quot;Realschüler&quot;. Students who graduate with the Abitur are called &quot;Abiturienten&quot;.

===Ireland===
In Ireland, pupils officially start with primary school which consists of eight years: junior infants, senior infants, first class to sixth class (ages 5–11). After primary school, pupils proceed to the secondary school level. Here they first enter the junior cycle, which consists of first year to third year (ages 11–14). At the end of third year, all students must sit a compulsory state examination called the Junior Certificate. After third year, pupils have the option of taking a &quot;transition year&quot; or fourth year (usually at age 15–16). In transition year pupils take a break from regular studies to pursue other activities that help to promote their personal, social, vocational and educational development, and to prepares them for their role as autonomous, participative and responsible members of society. It also provides a bridge to enable pupils to make the transition from the more dependent type of learning associated with the Junior Cert. to the more independent learning environment associated with the senior cycle.

After the junior cycle pupils advance to the senior cycle, which consists of fifth year and sixth year (usually ages between 16 and 18). At the end of the sixth year a final state examination is required to be sat by all pupils, known as the Leaving Certificate. The Leaving Cert. is the basis for all Irish pupils who wish to do so to advance to higher education via a points system. A maximum of 625 points can be achieved. All higher education courses have a minimum of points needed for admission.

At Trinity College Dublin under-graduate students are formally called &quot;junior freshmen&quot;, &quot;senior freshmen&quot;, &quot;junior sophister&quot; or &quot;senior sophister&quot;, according to the year they have reached in the typical four year degree course. &quot;Sophister&quot; is another term for a sophomore, though the term is rarely used in other institutions and is largely limited to Trinity College Dublin.

At university, the term &quot;fresher&quot; is used to describe new students who are just beginning their first year. The term, &quot;first year&quot; is the more commonly used and connotation-free term for students in their first year. The week at the start of a new year is called &quot;Freshers&#x27; Week&quot; or &quot;Welcome Week&quot;, with a programme of special events to welcome new students. An undergraduate in the last year of study before graduation is generally known as a &quot;finalist&quot;.

===Italy===

In Italian, a &quot;matricola&quot; is a first-year student. Some other terms may apply in specific schools, some depending on the liceo classico or liceo scientifico attended.

According to the goliardic initiation traditions the grades granted (following approximately the year of enrollment at university) are: &quot;matricola&quot; (freshman), &quot;fagiolo&quot; (sophomore), &quot;colonna&quot; (junior), and &quot;anziano&quot; (senior), but most of the distinctions are rarely used outside Goliardia.

===Sweden===
In Sweden, only those studying at university level are called students (&quot;student&quot;, plural &quot;studenter&quot;). To graduate from upper secondary school (&quot;gymnasium&quot;) is called &quot;ta studenten&quot; (literally &quot;to take the student&quot;), but after the graduation festivities, the graduate is no longer a student unless he or she enrolls at university-level education. At lower levels, the word &quot;elev&quot; (plural &quot;elever&quot;) is used. As a general term for all stages of education, the word &quot;studerande&quot; (plural also &quot;studerande&quot;) is used, meaning &#x27;studying [person]&#x27;.

===United Kingdom===

Traditionally, the term &quot;student&quot; is reserved for people studying at university level in the United Kingdom.

At universities in the UK, the term &quot;fresher&quot; is used informally to describe new students who are just beginning their first year. Although it is not unusual to call someone a fresher after their first few weeks at university, they are typically referred to as &quot;first years&quot; or &quot;first year students&quot;.

The ancient Scottish University of St Andrews uses the terms &quot;bejant&quot; for a first year (from the French &quot;bec-jaune&quot; – &quot;yellow beak&quot;, &quot;fledgling&quot;). Second years are called &quot;semi-bejants&quot;, third years are known as &quot;tertians&quot;, and fourth years, or others in their final year of study, are called &quot;magistrands&quot;.

In England and Wales, primary school begins with an optional &quot;nursery&quot; year (either in a primary school or a privately run nursery,) followed by reception and then move on to &quot;year one, year two&quot; and so on until &quot;year six&quot; (all in primary school.) In state schools, children join secondary school when they are 11–12 years old in what used to be called &quot;first form&quot; and is now known as &quot;year 7&quot;. They go up to year 11 (formerly &quot;fifth form&quot;) and then join the sixth form, either at the same school or at a separate sixth form college. A pupil entering a private, fee-paying school (usually at age 13) would join the &quot;third form&quot; – equivalent to year 9. Many schools have an alternate name for first years, some with a derogatory basis, but in others acting merely as a description – for example &quot;shells&quot; (non-derogatory) or &quot;grubs&quot; (derogatory).

In Northern Ireland and Scotland, it is very similar but with some differences. Pupils start off in nursery or reception aged 3 to 4, and then start primary school in &quot;P1&quot; (P standing for primary) or year 1. They then continue primary school until &quot;P7&quot; or year 7. After that they start secondary school at 11 years old, this is called &quot;1st year&quot; or year 8 in Northern Ireland, or &quot;S1&quot; in Scotland. They continue secondary school until the age of 16 at &quot;5th year&quot;, year 12 or &quot;S5&quot;, and then it is the choice of the individual pupil to decide to continue in school and (in Northern Ireland) do AS levels (known as &quot;lower sixth&quot;) and then the next year to do A levels (known as &quot;upper sixth&quot;). In Scotland, students aged 16–18 take Highers, followed by Advanced Highers. Alternatively, pupils can leave and go into full-time employment or to start in a technical college.

Large increases in the size of student populations in the UK and the effect this has had on some university towns or on areas of cities located near universities have become a concern in the UK since 2000. A report by Universities UK, &quot;Studentification: A Guide to Opportunities, Challenges and Practice&quot; (2006) has explored the subject and made various recommendations. A particular problem in many locations is seen as the impact of students on the availability, quality and price of rented and owner-occupied property.

==Americas==

===Canada===
Education in Canada (a federal state) is primarily within the constitutional jurisdiction of the provinces. The overall school curricula are overseen by the provincial and territorial governments, therefore the way educational stages are grouped and named can differ. Education is generally divided into primary, secondary and post-secondary stages. Primary and secondary education are generally divided into annual grades from 1 to 12, although grade 1 may be preceded by one or two years of kindergarten (which may be optional). Specifically, Ontario, Quebec and the Northwest Territories offer junior then senior kindergarten (in French, either &#x27; then , or &#x27; then ).

Education in Ontario from 1988 involved an Ontario Academic Credit (OAC) after grade 12 primarily as university preparation, but that was phased out in 2003. The OAC was informally known as &quot;grade 13&quot; (which it had replaced). All provinces and territories except Quebec now have 12 grades.

Education in Quebec differs from the other jurisdictions in that it has an (&quot;primary school&quot;) consisting of grades 1–6 and an (&quot;secondary school&quot;) consisting of I–V, equivalent to grades 7–11. A student graduating from then either completes a three-year college program or a two-year pre-university program required before attending university. In some English-language and most French-language , students refer to I–V as years one through five. This can be confusing for those outside of Quebec, especially out of context.

In some provinces, grades 1 through 5 are called &quot;elementary school&quot;, grades 6 to 8 are called &quot;middle school&quot; or &quot;junior high school&quot;, and grades 9 to 12 are considered high school. Other provinces, such as British Columbia, mainly divide schooling into elementary school (Kindergarten to grade 7) and secondary school (grades 8 through 12). In Alberta and Nova Scotia, elementary consists of kindergarten through grade 6. Junior high consists of Grades 7–9. High school consists of Grades 10–12. In English provinces, the high school (known as &quot;academy&quot; or &quot;secondary school&quot;) years can be referred to simply as &quot;first, second, third and fourth year&quot;. Some areas call it by grade such as grade 10, grade 11 and grade 12.

In Canadian English, the term &quot;college&quot; usually refers to a technical, trades, applied arts, applied technology, or applied science school or community college. These are post-secondary institutions typically granting two-year diplomas certificates, diplomas, associate degrees and (in some cases) bachelor&#x27;s degrees. The French acronym specific to public institutions within Quebec&#x27;s system of pre-university and technical education is CEGEP (&quot;Collège d&#x27;enseignement général et professionnel&quot;, &quot;college of general and professional education&quot;). CEGEP is a collegiate level institution in Quebec that most students typically enrols in, whether to learn a trade or applied discipline or to qualify for entrance to university in the Quebec education system. (In Ontario and Alberta, there are also institutions that only grant undergraduate degrees which are designated university colleges to differentiate them from universities, which have both undergraduate and graduate programs.)

In Canada, there is a strong distinction between &quot;college&quot; and &quot;university&quot;. In conversation, one specifically would say either &quot;they are going to university&quot; (i.e., studying for a three- or four-year degree at a university) or &quot;they are going to college&quot; (i.e., studying at a technical/career training).

A Canadian post-secondary college is generally geared for individuals seeking applied careers, while universities are geared for individuals seeking more academic careers.

University students are generally classified as first, second, third or fourth-year students, and the American system of classifying them as &quot;freshmen&quot;, &quot;sophomores&quot;, &quot;juniors&quot; and &quot;seniors&quot; is seldom used or even understood in Canada. In some occasions, they can be called &quot;senior ones&quot;, &quot;twos&quot;, &quot;threes&quot; and &quot;fours&quot;.

===United States===

In the United States, the first official year of schooling is called kindergarten, which is why the students are called kindergarteners. Kindergarten is optional in most states, but few students skip this level. Pre-kindergarten, also known as &quot;preschool&quot; (and sometimes shortened to &quot;Pre-K&quot;) is becoming a standard of education as academic expectations for the youngest students continue to rise. Many public schools offer pre-kindergarten programs.

In the United States, there are 12 years of mandatory schooling. The first eight are solely referred to by numbers (e.g. 1st grade, 5th grade) so students may be referred to as 1st graders, 5th graders, then once in middle school, they are referred to as 6th, 7th, and 8th graders. Upon entering high school, grades 9 through 12 (high school) also have alternate names for students, namely freshman, sophomore, junior and senior. The actual divisions of which grade levels belong to which division (whether elementary, middle, junior high, or high school) is a matter decided by state or local jurisdictions.

College students are often called Freshmen, Sophomores, Juniors, and Seniors for each of the four years unless their undergraduate program calls for more than the traditional four years.

====First year====
The first year of college or high school is referred to as Freshman year. A freshman is a first-year student in college, university or high school.

====Second year==== 
In the U.S., a , also called a &quot;soph&quot;, is a second-year student. Outside the United States, the term &quot;sophomore&quot; is rarely used, with second-year students simply called &quot;second years&quot;. Folk etymology indicates that the word means &quot;wise fool&quot;; consequently &quot;sophomoric&quot; means &quot;pretentious, bombastic, inflated in style or manner; immature, crude, superficial&quot; (according to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;). It is widely assumed to be formed from Greek &quot;Sophos&quot;, meaning &quot;wise&quot;, and &quot;Moros&quot; meaning &quot;foolish&quot;, although the etymology suggests an origin from the now-defunct &quot;sophomore&quot;, an obsolete variant of &quot;sophism&quot;.

====Post-second year====

In the U.S., a Junior is a student in the penultimate (usually third) year and a Senior is a student in the last (usually fourth) year of college, university, or high school. A student who takes more than the average number of years to graduate is sometimes referred to as a &quot;super senior&quot;. This term is often used in college but can be used in high school as well. The term &quot;underclassman&quot; refers collectively to Freshmen and Sophomores, and &quot;upperclassman&quot; refers collectively to Juniors and Seniors, sometimes even Sophomores. In some cases, the freshmen, sophomores, and juniors are considered underclassmen, while seniors are designated as upperclassmen. The term Middler is used to describe a third-year student of a school (generally college) that offers five years of study. In this situation, the fourth and fifth years would be referred to as Junior and Senior years, respectively, and the first two years would be the Freshman and Sophomore years.

====Graduate students====
A graduate student is a student who continues his/her education after graduation. Some examples of graduate programs are: business school, law school, medical school, and veterinary school. Degrees earned in graduate programs include the master&#x27;s degree, a research doctoral degree, or a first professional degree.

====Vocational school====
Students attending vocational school focus on their jobs and learning how to work in specific fields of work. A vocational program typically takes much less time to complete than a four-year degree program, lasting 12–24 months.

==Student politics==
Students have their own current of politics and activism on and off campus. The student rights movement has centered itself on the empowerment of students similar to the labor movement.

==Mature students==
==Student pranks==

University students have been associated with pranks and japes since the creation of universities in the Middle Ages. These can often involve petty crime, such as the theft of traffic cones and other public property, or hoaxes. It is also not uncommon for students from one school to steal or deface the mascot of a rival school. In fact, pranks play such a significant part in student culture that numerous books have been published that focus on the issue.

==Other terms==
*Students who are repeating a grade level of schooling due to poor grades are sometimes referred to as having been &quot;held back&quot; or &quot;kept back&quot;. In Malaysia and Singapore they are described as &quot;retained&quot;. In the Philippines they are called &quot;repeater&quot;.
*The term &#x27;pupil&#x27; (originally a Latin term for a minor as the ward of an adult guardian, etc.) is used in some Commonwealth primary and secondary schools (particularly in England and Wales) instead of &quot;student&quot;, but once attending further education (at a sixth-form college) or higher education (at university for example), the term &quot;student&quot; is standard. The term &quot;pupil&quot; is also used in the Philippines by the Department of Education to refer to learners currently in elementary school; the term &quot;student&quot; is used for by the Department of Education for learners in high school.
*The United States military academies officially use only numerical terms, but there are colloquial expressions used in everyday speech. In order from first year to fourth year, students are referred to as &quot;fourth-class&quot;, &quot;third-class&quot;, &quot;second-class&quot;, and &quot;first-class&quot; cadets or midshipmen. Unofficially, other terms are used, for example at the United States Military Academy, freshmen are called &quot;plebes&quot;, sophomores are called &quot;yearlings&quot; or &quot;yuks&quot;, juniors are called &quot;cows&quot;, and seniors are called &quot;firsties&quot;. Some universities also use numerical terms to identify classes; students enter as &quot;first-years&quot; and graduate as &quot;fourth-years&quot; (or, in some cases, &quot;fifth-years&quot;, &quot;sixth-years&quot;, etc.).

==Idiomatic use==
&quot;Freshman&quot; and &quot;sophomore&quot; are sometimes used figuratively, almost exclusively in the United States, to refer to a first or second effort (&quot;the singer&#x27;s &quot;sophomore&quot; album&quot;), or to a politician&#x27;s first or second term in office (&quot;freshman senator&quot;) or an athlete&#x27;s first or second year on a professional sports team. &quot;Junior&quot; and &quot;senior&quot; are not used in this figurative way to refer to third and fourth years or efforts, because of those words&#x27; broader meanings of &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;. A junior senator is therefore not one who is in a third term of office, but merely one who has not been in the Senate as long as the other senator from their state. Confusingly, this means that it is possible to be both a &quot;freshman senator&quot; and a &quot;senior senator&quot; simultaneously: for example, if a senator wins election in 2008, and then the other senator from the same state steps down and a new senator elected in 2010, the former senator is both senior senator (having been in the Senate for two years longer) and a freshman senator (being still in their first term).

==International Students&#x27; Day==
International Students&#x27; Day (17 November) remembers the anniversary of the 1939 Nazi storming of the University of Prague after student demonstrations against the German occupation of Czechoslovakia. Germans closed all Czech universities and colleges, sent over 1200 students to Nazi concentration camps, and had nine student leaders executed (on 17 November).

<doc id="155528" wikidata="Q33237" url="?curid=155528" title="Ordo Templi Orientis">
<text>Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.; ) is an occult secret society and hermetic magical organization founded at the beginning of the 20th century. The origins of O.T.O. can be traced back to the German-speaking occultists Carl Kellner, Theodor Reuss, Heinrich Klein, and Franz Hartmann. In its first incarnation, O.T.O. was intended to be modelled after and associated with European Freemasonry; as such, in its early years, only Freemasons could seek admittance.

Founder and first head of the Order Carl Kellner wanted to create an Academia Masonica wherein various rites of high-degree Freemasonry could be conferred within German-speaking countries. During the course of his esoteric studies across the globe and from many traditions, Kellner believed that he had discovered a key which offered a clear explanation of all the complex symbolism of Freemasonry and of nature itself. Kellner intended that O.T.O. preserve and confer this key.

After the death of Reuss, English writer and occultist Aleister Crowley assumed control of the Order. Crowley had been inducted into O.T.O. by Reuss in the early 1910s. While maintaining many core elements of Freemasonry and the intentions of both Kellner and Reuss, O.T.O. was drastically changed by Crowley. The guiding philosophy of O.T.O. from this point on became Crowley&#x27;s self-created occult system, Thelema. With this change O.T.O. ceased its bestowal of Masonic degrees and membership requirements.

After Crowley&#x27;s death in 1947, four main branches of O.T.O. claimed exclusive descent from the original organization and primacy over the other ones. Courts have ruled that the organization incorporated by Crowley&#x27;s student Grady McMurtry in 1979 is the legal continuation of the Order and is the exclusive owner of the names, trademarks, copyrights and other assets of Crowley&#x27;s O.T.O.

==History==

===Origins===

The early history of O.T.O. is difficult to trace reliably. It originated in Germany or Austria between 1895 and 1906. Its apparent founder was Carl Kellner (1851–1905) (probably with the German spelling Karl), a wealthy Austrian industrialist, in 1895 (although nothing verifiable is known of the Order until 1904). Kellner wanted to establish an &quot;Academia Masonica&quot; within which high-grade Freemasonic degrees could be conferred in German-speaking nations.
Theodor Reuss (1855–1923) collaborated with Kellner in creating O.T.O. and succeeded him as head of O.T.O. after Kellner&#x27;s death. Under Reuss, charters were given to occult brotherhoods in France, Denmark, Switzerland, the United States, and Austria. There were ten degrees, of which the first five were Masonic. 
In 1902, Reuss, along with Franz Hartmann and Henry Klein, purchased the right to perform the Rite of Memphis and Mizraim of Freemasonry from English Freemason John Yarker, the authority of which was confirmed in 1904 and again in 1905. Although these rites are considered to be irregular, they, along with the Swedenborg Rite formed the core of the newly established Order. Kellner, Reuss, Hartmann, and Klein acquired authority to operate the rites of the Martinist Order from French occultist Gérard Encausse and a clandestine form of the Scottish Rite deriving from Joseph Cerneau. From William Wynn Westcott, Reuss acquired a warrant to start a college of the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia in Germany.

In 1902, Reuss began publishing a masonic journal, &quot;The Oriflamme&quot;, as the organ of these collected rites. Reuss&#x27;s rites aroused some degree of curiosity in the German-speaking Masonic milieu, as high degree Freemasonry had not been very widespread in Germany during the 1800s. O.T.O. had several hundred members and affiliates at its peak, but by 1905 and after Kellner&#x27;s death, Reuss began to lose his supporters. He was attacked in Masonic periodicals for his alleged lack of Masonic regularity and credentials, and for the alleged homosexual elements in Reuss&#x27;s initiations. Reuss left Germany and moved to London in 1906, and lost control of most of the lodges previously belonging to the O.T.O. network.

In 1908, Encausse invited to Reuss to an &quot;International Masonic Conference&quot;, where he probably met Joanny Bricaud and was introduced to his Gnostic Catholic Church (E.G.C.), an off-shoot of Jules Doinel&#x27;s &quot;Église Gnostique&quot;. Later O.T.O. documents would present the Order being linked to the E.G.C, and subsequently portray the E.G.C. of O.T.O. as being autonomous with respect to Bricaud&#x27;s organization.

The sex magic of the higher O.T.O. degrees appears to be based on the writings of the American occultist Paschal Beverly Randolph (1825–1875), which were adopted by the Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor (or of Light), another group with which Kellner had been in contact and whose teachings he said he had incorporated into O.T.O. Scholar Marco Pasi notes, however, that there is no evidence in support of this, and suggests that Reuss acquired sexual ideas and techniques from Yarker, who had in his possession certain unpublished writings by Randolph.

===Under Reuss&#x27; leadership===

Reuss met Aleister Crowley and in 1910 admitted him to the first three degrees of O.T.O. Two years later, Crowley was placed in charge of Great Britain and Ireland, and was advanced to the X° (tenth degree). The appointment included the opening of the British section of O.T.O., which was called the &quot;Mysteria Mystica Maxima&quot; or the M∴M∴M∴. Crowley then went to Berlin to obtain instructional manuscripts and the title of &quot;Supreme and Holy King of Ireland, Iona and all the Britains within the Sanctuary of the Gnosis&quot;. Within the year, Crowley had written the Manifesto of the M∴M∴M∴ which described its basic ten-degree system with Kellner&#x27;s three degree &quot;Academia Masonica&quot; forming the seventh, eighth and ninth degrees.

In 1913, Crowley composed the Gnostic Mass while in Moscow, which he described as being the Order&#x27;s &quot;central ceremony of its public and private celebration&quot;. In 1914, soon after World War I broke out, he moved to the United States. It was around this time that Crowley decided to integrate Thelema into the O.T.O. system, and in 1915 prepared revised rituals for use in the M∴M∴M∴.

In 1917, Reuss wrote a &quot;Synopsis of Degrees&quot; of O.T.O. in which the third degree was listed as &quot;Craft of Masonry&quot; and listed the initiations involved as &quot;Entered Apprentice, Fellow Craft, Master Mason&quot; and elaborated on this with &quot;Full instruction in Craft Masonry, including the Catechism of the first three degrees, and an explanation of all the various Masonic systems&quot;. The same document shows that the fourth degree of O.T.O. is also known as the Holy Royal Arch of Enoch. It was summarized by Reuss as the Degree of &quot;Scotch Masonry&quot;, equivalent to &quot;Scotch Mason, Knight of St. Andrew, Royal Arch&quot;, and he described it as &quot;Full instruction in the Scottish degrees of Ancient and Accepted Masonry&quot;.

In 1919, Crowley attempted to work this Masonic-based O.T.O. in Detroit, Michigan. The result was that he was rebuffed by the Council of the Scottish Rite on the basis that O.T.O. rituals were too similar to orthodox Masonry. He described this in a 1930 letter to Arnold Krumm-Heller:

Crowley subsequently rewrote the initiation rituals of the first three degrees, and in doing so removed most of those rituals&#x27; ties to Masonry. He did not, however, rewrite the fourth degree ritual, which remains in its form and structure related to the various Royal Arch rituals of Masonry.

=== Under Crowley&#x27;s leadership ===
Crowley wrote that Theodore Reuss suffered a stroke in the spring of 1920. In correspondence with one of Reuss&#x27; officers, Crowley expressed doubts about Reuss&#x27; competence to remain in office. Relations between Reuss and Crowley began to deteriorate, and the two exchanged angry letters in November 1921. Crowley informed Reuss that he was availing himself of Reuss&#x27; abdication from office and proclaiming himself Outer Head of the Order. Reuss died on October 28, 1923, without designating a successor, though Crowley wrote in later correspondence that Reuss had designated him. Crowley&#x27;s biographer Lawrence Sutin, among others, casts doubt on this, though there is no evidence for or against it, and no other candidate stepped forward to refute Crowley by offering proof of succession. In 1925, during a tumultuous Conference of Grand Masters, Crowley was officially elected as Outer Head of the Order (or O.H.O.) by the remaining administrative heads of O.T.O.

During this period, O.T.O. members outside of the USA rarely came into contact with one another.: Since the total membership of O.T.O. at that time was counted in the dozens rather than in hundreds or thousands, this may simply have been Crowley&#x27;s attempt at disguising the low numbers.

During World War II, the European branches of O.T.O. were either destroyed or driven underground. By the end of the war, the only surviving O.T.O. body was Agapé Lodge in California, although there were various initiates in different countries. Very few initiations were being performed. At this time, Karl Germer, who had been Crowley&#x27;s representative in Germany, migrated to the United States after being released from Nazi confinement. On March 14, 1942, Crowley appointed him as his successor as Outer Head of the Order, and Germer filled the office after the death of Crowley in 1947.

===After Crowley&#x27;s death===
After Crowley&#x27;s death, Germer attempted to keep O.T.O. running, with questionable success. Crowley had granted a charter to run an O.T.O. Camp in England to Gerald Gardner, and Germer acknowledged Gardner as O.T.O.&#x27;s main representative in Europe. The two men met in 1948 in New York to discuss plans, but Gardner&#x27;s continuing ill health led to Germer replacing him with Frederic Mellinger in 1951. Also in 1951, Germer granted a charter to run an O.T.O. Camp in England to Kenneth Grant, who had briefly served as Crowley&#x27;s secretary during the 1940s. Grant was to be expelled and his charter revoked in 1955 however, and from that time onwards O.T.O.&#x27;s representative in the UK was a IX° member, Noel Fitzgerald.

Germer died in 1962 without naming a successor. It was not until 1969 that Grady McMurtry invoked his letter of emergency authorization from Crowley and became the Frater Superior of O.T.O. McMurtry did not claim the title of Outer Head of the Order, stating in 1974 that &quot;There is at present no Outer Head of the Order for Aleister Crowley&#x27;s Ordo Templi Orientis. The Outer Head of the Order is an international office (see p. 201, The Blue Equinox) and Aleister Crowley&#x27;s Ordo Templi Orientis is not at this time established organizationally to fulfill the requirements of its Constitution in this respect.&quot; He began performing initiations in 1970. O.T.O. was incorporated under the laws of the State of California on March 26, 1979. The corporation attained federal tax exemption as a religious entity under IRS Code 501(c)3 in 1982. Grady McMurtry died in 1985.

McMurtry requested that members of the Sovereign Sanctuary of the Gnosis (i.e. the members of the Ninth Degree) elect the next Caliph, which they did in 1985. William Breeze was elected, taking the name &quot;Hymenaeus Beta&quot;. In the Fall 1995 issue of &quot;The Magical Link&quot;, he is designated &quot;Hymenaeus Beta X°&quot;; in the Fall 1997 issue of &quot;The Magical Link&quot;, he is designated &quot;Hymenaeus Beta XI°&quot;; by May 2005, he is designated &quot;O.H.O. Hymenaeus Beta XII°&quot; on the O.T.O. website.

In 1996, Sabazius X° was appointed as National Grand Master General (G.M.G.) for the U.S. Grand Lodge. In 2005, Frater Hyperion X° was appointed the National G.M.G. of the newly formed UK Grand Lodge. Frater Shiva X° was appointed the G.M.G. of the Australia Grand Lodge in 2006. In 2014, Frater Abrasax X° was appointed the National G.M.G. of the newly formed Grand Lodge of Croatia, and Frater Phanes X° was appointed the National G.M.G. of the newly formed Grand Lodge of Italy. On October 14, 2014, these five National Grand Masters elected Hymenaeus Beta as &quot;de jure&quot; Outer Head of the Order.

==Philosophy==
O.T.O. was described by Crowley as the &quot;first of the great Old Æon orders to accept The Book of the Law&quot;. O.T.O. originally borrowed ritual material from irregular Masonic organizations, and although some related symbolism and language remains in use, the context has changed to Thelema and its tenets.

O.T.O. has two core areas of ritual activity: initiation into the Mysteries, and the celebration of Liber XV, the Gnostic Mass. In addition, the Order organizes lectures, classes, social events, theatrical productions and artistic exhibitions, publishes books and journals, and provides instruction in Hermetic science, yoga, and magick.

Crowley wrote in his &quot;Confessions&quot;:

Of the first set of initiations, he wrote:

The initiation rituals after the V° (fifth degree) are such that:

Of the entire system of O.T.O., Crowley wrote in &quot;Confessions&quot;:

==Initiation and teachings==
Membership in O.T.O. is based upon a system of initiation ceremonies (or &quot;degrees&quot;) that use ritual drama to establish fraternal bonds between members as well as impart spiritual and philosophical teachings.

The degrees serve an organizational function, in that certain degrees must be attained before taking on various forms of service in the Order (e.g. taking the degree of K.E.W. is a requirement for ordination as a priest or priestess in &quot;Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica&quot;).

There are thirteen numbered degrees and twelve un-numbered degrees which are divided into three grades or &quot;triads&quot;—the Hermit, the Lover, and the Man of Earth.

Admittance to each degree of O.T.O. involves an initiation and the swearing of an oath which according to O.T.O is similar to those used in Freemasonry.

Advancement through the Man of Earth triad requires sponsorship from ranking members. Advancement into the degree of the Knight of the East and West and beyond requires one to be invited by ranking members.

The ultimate goal of initiation in O.T.O. is &quot;to instruct the individual by allegory and symbol in the profound mysteries of Nature, and thereby to assist each to discover his or her own true Identity&quot;.

The entire system is as follows:

=== Man of Earth triad ===

* 0°—Minerval
* I°—Man &amp; Brother
* II°—Magician
* III°—Master Magician
* IV°—Perfect Magician &amp; Companion of the Holy Royal Arch of Enoch
**P.I.—Perfect Initiate, or Prince of Jerusalem

=== Outside all triads ===

* Knight of the East &amp; West

=== Lover&#x27;s triad ===

* V°—
** Sovereign Prince Rose-Croix, and Knight of the Pelican &amp; Eagle
**Knight of the Red Eagle, and Member of the Senate of Knight Hermetic Philosophers
* VI°—
** Illustrious Knight (Templar) of the Order of Kadosch, and Companion of the Holy Graal
**Grand Inquisitor Commander, and Member of the Grand Tribunal
**Prince of the Royal Secret
* VII°—
** Theoreticus, and Very Illustrious Sovereign Grand Inspector General
**Magus of Light, and Bishop of &quot;Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica&quot;
**Grandmaster of Light, and Inspector of Rites &amp; Degrees

=== Hermit&#x27;s triad ===

* VIII°—
** Perfect Pontiff of the Illuminati
**Epopt of the Illuminati
* IX°—Initiate of the Sanctuary of the Gnosis
* X°—Rex Summus Sanctissimus
* XI°—Initiate of the Eleventh Degree (This degree is technical, and has no relation to the general plan of the Order)
* XII°—Frater Superior, and Outer Head of the Order

==Structure==
The governing bodies of O.T.O. include:
#International Headquarters
#*Presided over by the Outer Head of the Order XII° (O.H.O.—also known as Frater Superior)

# The Electoral College consists of eleven members of the V° and is the first of the governing bodies. Its primary duty is to oversee the affairs of the Man of Earth Triad.

O.T.O. has a federally recognized tax-exempt status in the United States under IRS section 501c(3). It also has California charitable corporation status.

====Grand Lodges====
The US Grand Lodge is the governing body of O.T.O. in the United States. The U.S. National Grand Master is Sabazius X°, who was appointed in 1996.

According to its website, the Mission Statement of U.S.G.L. is as follows:
As of Feb 28, 2014, US Grand Lodge had 1,508 members in 62 local bodies. The UK Grand Lodge is the governing body of O.T.O. in the United Kingdom. The UK National Grand Master is Frater Hyperion X°, who was appointed in 2005 (93 years after the last Grand Master for the UK, Aleister Crowley, was elevated to that office). The Australian Grand Lodge is the governing body of O.T.O. in Australia and its territories were chartered in April 2006. The A.G.L. National Grand Master is Frater Shiva X°. The Croatian Grand Lodge is the governing body of O.T.O. in Croatia and its territories, chartered in May 2014. The C.G.L. National Grand Master is Frater Abrasax X°. The Italian Grand Lodge is the governing body of O.T.O. in Italy and its territories, chartered in May 2014. The I.G.L. National Grand Master is Frater Phanes X°.

===Gnostic Catholic Church===

Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica, also called the &quot;Gnostic Catholic Church&quot;, is the ecclesiastical arm of O.T.O. Its central activity is the celebration of &quot;Liber XV, The Gnostic Mass&quot;. In recent years, other rites have been written and approved for use within the church. These include baptism, confirmation (into the laity), and ordination (for deacons, priests, priestesses, and bishops), and last rites.

===Bodies===
At the Man of Earth level, there are three levels of Local Body, which are Camps, Oases, and Lodges.
#Camps tend to be the smallest and are not required to perform initiations. They are encouraged to celebrate the Gnostic Mass.
#Oases must be capable of initiating through the III° and are required to perform the Gnostic Mass six times yearly.
#Lodges are expected to celebrate the Gnostic Mass on a regular basis, work towards establishing a permanent temple, and have the ability to initiate through IV°/P.I.
#Chapters of Rose Croix are bodies established by members of the Lover Grade. A Chapter is headed by a Most Wise Sovereign. They are generally charged with arranging social activities, such as plays, banquets, and dances. They also work to promote harmony among the members through tact and friendliness.
#Guilds are groups recognized by O.T.O. International designed to promote a profession, trade, science, or craft. Subject to approval by the Areopagus, they make their own regulations and coordinate their own efforts. There are currently three Guilds: the Psychology Guild, the Translators&#x27; Guild, and the Information Technology Guild.
#The term sanctuary is sometimes used to indicate a group of initiates organized for E.G.C. activities. This designation currently reflects no formal chartering process or official standing within the Order.

==Questions of legitimacy==
After Crowley&#x27;s death, several different organizations put themselves forward as legitimate continuations of Ordo Templi Orientis, both before and after McMurtry revived O.T.O. in California.

Although Karl Germer expelled Kenneth Grant from O.T.O. in 1955, Grant presented himself as Outer Head of Ordo Templi Orientis in a series of influential books. His organization is now known as the Typhonian Order.

Marcelo Ramos Motta (1931–1987), wrote that his O.T.O. membership was conferred personally by Karl Germer. United States First Circuit Court of Appeals found that was initiated into O.T.O. by Germer in California in 1955 or 1956. Motta asserted that Germer&#x27;s wife Sasha had told him that Germer&#x27;s last words had designated Motta as &quot;the follower&quot;. He unsuccessfully sued for ownership of the Crowley copyrights in the U.S. District Court in Maine.

===Court cases===
In Australia in 2005, O.T.O. began a defamation case against the site GaiaGuys for material put up on their website that directly accused O.T.O., particularly in Australia, of participating in acts of child abuse and sacrifice. The court found in favour of O.T.O.

In June 2008, O.T.O. won a trademark case on appeal in the UK: &quot;OTO&quot;, &quot;O.T.O.&quot; &quot;Ordo Templi Orientis&quot; and the OTO Lamen were confirmed to be trademarks of the order.

<text>J. Lumsden and Son is a Scottish engraving and publishing firm founded in 1783 by James Lumsden, most known for its short runs of high quality printings of children&#x27;s books. The firm also made bookbinders&#x27; finishing tools.

The founder James Lumsden retired in 1810 and the business passed to his son, also James Lumsden (1778-1856), who adapted its speciality to stationery. When he retired in 1852, the company was taken over by his son James Lumsden (1808-1879), who had attended the University of Glasgow until 1821, when he entered the family business, becoming a partner in 1834. The younger Lumsden was knighted in 1868, becoming Sir James Lumsden of Arden. On Sir James&#x27;s retirement in 1876 his son, also James Lumsden (1851-1911), took an interest in the firm.

The majority of books produced by them were sold to affluent families in Scotland and Northern England, with their average book price of sixpence putting them beyond affordability for the average family.

The firm was one of the earliest to engage in the practice of releasing the same book under multiple-covers to increase sales; this practice has now meant that books published by Lumsden are highly collectible.

Partial list of books published by Lumsden:

*1812 - Peter Williamson, &quot;The life and curious adventures of Peter Williamson&quot;
*1812 - anon, &quot;Nurse Dandlem&quot;
*1815 - Jonathan Swift, &quot;The adventures of Captain Gulliver in a voyage to Lilliput&quot;
*1816 - anon, &quot;Fun Upon Fun&quot;
*1818 - Marie Le Prince de Beaumont, &quot;Beauty and the beast&quot;
*1843 - The New Testament
*1845 - Joseph Train, &quot;An Historical and Statistical Account of the Isle of Man&quot;

<doc id="155538" wikidata="Q2284692" url="?curid=155538" title="Seattle Symphony">
<text>The Seattle Symphony is an American orchestra based in Seattle, Washington. Since 1998, the orchestra is resident at Benaroya Hall. The orchestra also serves as the accompanying orchestra for the Seattle Opera.

==History==

===Beginnings===

The orchestra gave its first performance on December 29, 1903, with Harry West conducting. Known from its founding as the Seattle Symphony, it was renamed in 1911 as the Seattle Philharmonic Orchestra. In 1919, the orchestra was reorganized with new bylaws under the name Seattle Symphony Orchestra. The 1921–22 season was cancelled due to financial problems. The orchestra was revived in 1926 under the direction of Karl Krueger.

===Pacific Northwest Symphony Orchestra===
In 1947, the Seattle Symphony merged with the Tacoma Philharmonic to form the Pacific Northwest Symphony Orchestra. Performances were held in Seattle, Tacoma, and Olympia, with conducting duties split between Carl Bricken and Eugene Linden. This arrangement ceased after one season, when the Seattle Symphony decided to withdraw from it. A feud between the musicians and the board surfaced in 1948, and a majority of the musicians divorced themselves from the board and created a new orchestra called the Seattle Orchestra, a partnership (collective) operated by the musicians themselves, who chose Linden as their conductor.
The Seattle Symphony announced a separate orchestra season with eighteen concerts at the old Meany Hall for the Performing Arts on the University of Washington campus. The symphony was to be directed by Stanley Chapple, and a series of guest conductors: Artur Rodzinski, Jacques Singer, and Erich Leinsdorf. Personnel for the Seattle Symphony were announced in the press on October 24, 1948, and included a few musicians who had chosen not to defect to the Seattle Orchestra and some new faces as well. The Seattle Symphony season was then postponed and eventually cancelled. The Seattle Orchestra, meanwhile, gave its first performance on November 23, 1948. An accommodation was reached between the Seattle Symphony and the Seattle Orchestra, and the two organizations merged, and the name &quot;Seattle Symphony Orchestra&quot; was retained. The partnership system was also retained, and musicians gained access onto the board. The partnership system was eventually dissolved at the request of Milton Katims in 1955. Even so, for most of its 100-year history, and especially today, the ensemble is known by the two-word name &quot;Seattle Symphony&quot;.

===Gerard Schwarz===
Gerard Schwarz became music advisor of the orchestra in 1983 and principal conductor in 1984, before being named music director in 1985. Under Schwarz&#x27;s leadership, the orchestra became particularly known for performing works of twentieth-century composers, especially neglected American composers. Together, Schwarz and the orchestra have made more than 100 commercial recordings, including the major orchestral works of Howard Hanson and David Diamond as well as works by Charles Tomlinson Griffes, Walter Piston, Paul Creston, William Schuman, Alan Hovhaness, Morton Gould, David Diamond, and others, for Delos International and Naxos Records. The orchestra received its first Grammy nomination in January 1990 for a 1989 recording of music of Howard Hanson. The orchestra also recorded a musical score to the SeaWorld, Orlando, stage show &quot;A&#x27;lure, The Call of the Ocean&quot; plus the score for the motion pictures &quot;Highlander II: The Quickening&quot; and &quot;Die Hard With a Vengeance&quot;.

Schwarz received praise for his championing of American composers and his skills in fund-raising. However, his tenure was also marked by controversies between him and several symphony musicians, which included several legal disputes. In September 2008, the orchestra announced the conclusion of Schwarz&#x27;s music directorship after the 2010–2011 season, at which time Schwarz became the orchestra&#x27;s conductor laureate.

===Ludovic Morlot===

Ludovic Morlot first guest-conducted the Seattle Symphony in October 2009. He returned in April 2010, as a substitute conductor in the wake of the 2010 Eyjafjallajökull eruptions. Based on these appearance, in June 2010, the orchestra announced the appointment of Morlot as its 15th music director, effective with the 2011–2012 season, with an initial contract of six years. During Morlot&#x27;s tenure, the orchestra initiated its own recording label, &#x27;Seattle Symphony Media&#x27;. In July 2015, the orchestra announced the extension of Morlot&#x27;s contract through the 2018–2019 season. Morlot has taken particular interest in fostering music from Seattle-based composers, including composers within the orchestra itself. His work with the orchestra has included the commissioning and premiere of John Luther Adams&#x27; &quot;Become Ocean&quot;, which went on to win the 2014 Pulitzer Prize for Music and the 2015 Grammy Award for Best Classical Contemporary Composition. The commercial recording of &quot;Become Ocean&quot;, for Cantaloupe Music, led to a donation by Taylor Swift to the Seattle Symphony of US$50,000. Morlot and the orchestra have received additional Grammy Awards for their recordings of music of Henri Dutilleux. Morlot concluded his tenure as music director at the end of the 2018–2019 season.

===Thomas Dausgaard===
Thomas Dausgaard first guest-conducted the orchestra in 2013. In October 2013, the orchestra named Dausgaard its next principal guest conductor, effective with the 2014–2015 season, with an initial contract of 3 years. In March 2016, the orchestra announced the extension of Dausgaard&#x27;s contract as principal guest conductor through the 2019–2020 season. In October 2017, the orchestra announced the appointment of Dausgaard as its next music director, effective with the 2019–2020 season, with an initial contract of 4 seasons. On 7 January 2022, Dausgaard resigned as music director by e-mail, with immediate effect. In an interview with Danish National Radio&#x27;s P2, Dausgaard said, &quot;I have felt threatened and I haven&#x27;t felt safe with going to work.&quot;

===Xian Zhang===
In June 2008, Xian Zhang first guest-conducted the orchestra. She returned to the orchestra as a guest conductor several times, including in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic and in 2021 with the return of live audiences to concerts. In September 2024, the orchestra announced the appointment of Zhang as its next music director, effective with the 2025-2026 season, with an initial contract of five years. She took the title of music director-designate with immediate effect. Zhang is the first female conductor and the first conductor of color to be named music director of the Seattle Symphony.

<doc id="155544" wikidata="Q193523" url="?curid=155544" title="Charles's law">
<text>Charles&#x27;s law (also known as the law of volumes) is an experimental gas law that describes how gases tend to expand when heated. A modern statement of Charles&#x27;s law is:

When the pressure on a sample of a dry gas is held constant, the Kelvin temperature and the volume will be in direct proportion.

This relationship of direct proportion can be written as:
:formula_1
So this means:
:formula_2 
where:
* is the volume of the gas,
* is the temperature of the gas (measured in kelvins), and
* is a constant for a particular pressure and amount of gas.

This law describes how a gas expands as the temperature increases; conversely, a decrease in temperature will lead to a decrease in volume. For comparing the same substance under two different sets of conditions, the law can be written as:

formula_3

The equation shows that, as absolute temperature increases, the volume of the gas also increases in proportion.

==History==

The law was named after scientist Jacques Charles, who formulated the original law in his unpublished work from the 1780s.

In two of a series of four essays presented between 2 and 30 October 1801, John Dalton demonstrated by experiment that all the gases and vapours that he studied expanded by the same amount between two fixed points of temperature. The French natural philosopher Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac confirmed the discovery in a presentation to the French National Institute on 31 Jan 1802, although he credited the discovery to unpublished work from the 1780s by Jacques Charles. The basic principles had already been described by Guillaume Amontons and Francis Hauksbee a century earlier.

Dalton was the first to demonstrate that the law applied generally to all gases, and to the vapours of volatile liquids if the temperature was well above the boiling point. Gay-Lussac concurred. With measurements only at the two thermometric fixed points of water (0°C and 100°C), Gay-Lussac was unable to show that the equation relating volume to temperature was a linear function. On mathematical grounds alone, Gay-Lussac&#x27;s paper does not permit the assignment of any law stating the linear relation. Both Dalton&#x27;s and Gay-Lussac&#x27;s main conclusions can be expressed mathematically as:
:formula_4
where 100 is the volume occupied by a given sample of gas at 100 °C; 0 is the volume occupied by the same sample of gas at 0 °C; and is a constant which is the same for all gases at constant pressure. This equation does not contain the temperature and so is not what became known as Charles&#x27;s Law. Gay-Lussac&#x27;s value for (), was identical to Dalton&#x27;s earlier value for vapours and remarkably close to the present-day value of . Gay-Lussac gave credit for this equation to unpublished statements by his fellow Republican citizen J. Charles in 1787. In the absence of a firm record, the gas law relating volume to temperature cannot be attributed to Charles.
Dalton&#x27;s measurements had much more scope regarding temperature than Gay-Lussac, not only measuring the volume at the fixed points of water but also at two intermediate points. Unaware of the inaccuracies of mercury thermometers at the time, which were divided into equal portions between the fixed points, Dalton, after concluding in Essay II that in the case of vapours, “any elastic fluid expands nearly in a uniform manner into 1370 or 1380 parts by 180 degrees (Fahrenheit) of heat”, was unable to confirm it for gases.

==Relation to absolute zero==

Charles&#x27;s law appears to imply that the volume of a gas will descend to zero at a certain temperature (−266.66 °C according to Gay-Lussac&#x27;s figures) or −273.15 °C. Gay-Lussac was clear in his description that the law was not applicable at low temperatures:

but I may mention that this last conclusion cannot be true except so long as the compressed vapours remain entirely in the elastic state; and this requires that their temperature shall be sufficiently elevated to enable them to resist the pressure which tends to make them assume the liquid state.

At absolute zero temperature, the gas possesses zero energy and hence the molecules restrict motion.
Gay-Lussac had no experience of liquid air (first prepared in 1877), although he appears to have believed (as did Dalton) that the &quot;permanent gases&quot; such as air and hydrogen could be liquified. Gay-Lussac had also worked with the vapours of volatile liquids in demonstrating Charles&#x27;s law, and was aware that the law does not apply just above the boiling point of the liquid:

I may, however, remark that when the temperature of the ether is only a little above its boiling point, its condensation is a little more rapid than that of atmospheric air. This fact is related to a phenomenon which is exhibited by a great many bodies when passing from the liquid to the solid-state, but which is no longer sensible at temperatures a few degrees above that at which the transition occurs.
The first mention of a temperature at which the volume of a gas might descend to zero was by William Thomson (later known as Lord Kelvin) in 1848:

This is what we might anticipate when we reflect that infinite cold must correspond to a finite number of degrees of the air-thermometer below zero; since if we push the strict principle of graduation, stated above, sufficiently far, we should arrive at a point corresponding to the volume of air being reduced to nothing, which would be marked as −273° of the scale (−100/.366, if .366 be the coefficient of expansion); and therefore −273° of the air-thermometer is a point which cannot be reached at any finite temperature, however low.

However, the &quot;absolute zero&quot; on the Kelvin temperature scale was originally defined in terms of the second law of thermodynamics, which Thomson himself described in 1852. Thomson did not assume that this was equal to the &quot;zero-volume point&quot; of Charles&#x27;s law, merely said that Charles&#x27;s law provided the minimum temperature which could be attained. The two can be shown to be equivalent by Ludwig Boltzmann&#x27;s statistical view of entropy (1870).

However, Charles also stated:

:The volume of a fixed mass of dry gas increases or decreases by times the volume at 0 °C for every 1 °C rise or fall in temperature. Thus:

::formula_5

::formula_6

:where is the volume of gas at temperature (in degrees Celsius), is the volume at 0 °C.

==Relation to kinetic theory==
The kinetic theory of gases relates the macroscopic properties of gases, such as pressure and volume, to the microscopic properties of the molecules which make up the gas, particularly the mass and speed of the molecules. To derive Charles&#x27;s law from kinetic theory, it is necessary to have a microscopic definition of temperature: this can be conveniently taken as the temperature being proportional to the average kinetic energy of the gas molecules, k:
:formula_7

Under this definition, the demonstration of Charles&#x27;s law is almost trivial. The kinetic theory equivalent of the ideal gas law relates to the average kinetic energy:
:formula_8

<text>Västergötland (), also known as West Gothland or the Latinized version Westrogothia in older literature, is one of the 25 traditional non-administrative provinces of Sweden (&quot;landskap&quot; in Swedish), situated in the southwest of Sweden.

Västergötland is home to Gothenburg, the second largest city in Sweden, which is situated along a short stretch of the Kattegat strait. The province is bordered by Bohuslän, Dalsland, Värmland, Närke, Östergötland, Småland and Halland, as well as the two largest Swedish lakes Vänern and Vättern. Victoria, Crown Princess of Sweden is Duchess of Västergötland.

== Administration ==
The provinces of Sweden serve no administrative function. Instead, that function is served by counties of Sweden. From the 17th century up until 31 December 1997, Västergötland was divided into Skaraborg County, Älvsborg County and a minor part of Gothenburg and Bohus County. From 1 January 1998 nearly all of the province is in the newly created Västra Götaland County, with the exception of Habo Municipality and Mullsjö Municipality, which were transferred to Jönköping County, and smaller parts of the province which are in Halland County and Örebro County.

== Heraldry ==

Västergötland was granted its arms at the time of the funeral of King Gustav Vasa in 1560. The province is also a duchy and the arms can be represented with the ducal coronet. Blazon: &quot;Per bend sinister Sable and Or, a Lion rampant counterchanged langued and armed Gules between two Mullets Argent in the Sable field.&quot;

== Geography ==
The southern and eastern part of the province is dominated by hills, belonging to the southern Swedish highlands. In geological terms southern Västergötland is made up of northward tilted surfaces of the Sub-Cambrian peneplain making up the flank of the Southern Swedish Dome. 

The northern and western portions of the province belong to the Central Swedish lowland, which in this part is referred to as the Västgöta-plains or . Characteristic for these lowlands in Västergötland is that they contain hills made up Silurian-aged sedimentary rock. These are; Kinnekulle, Halleberg, Hunneberg and Billingen.

Along the Kattegat lies the archipelago usually known as the Gothenburg archipelago. The southern part of it, belonging to Gothenburg Municipality, is part of Västergötland.

The northwestern border is demarcated by Sweden&#x27;s largest lake Vänern, and the north-eastern border is demarcated by Sweden&#x27;s second largest lake Vättern. Within the province the shoreline of Lake Vänern is long, and along Vättern it is . The largest river is Göta älv which drains Vänern to the east shore and the Kattegat strait; along the river several important cities and towns have been situated for centuries.

The average rainfall is near the coast and in the plains. The average temperature is in January and in July.

* Highest mountain: Galtåsen 362 meters (1188&#x27;)
* National parks: Tiveden, Djurö

== Population ==
As of 31 December 2016, Västergötland had a population of 1,328,128 distributed over four counties:

== History ==
=== Prehistory and middle ages ===
There are many ancient remains in Västergötland. Among the most notable of these remains are the dolmens from the Funnelbeaker culture, in the Falköping area south of lake Vänern. Finnestorp, near Larv, was a weapons sacrificial site from the Iron Age.

The population of Västergötland, the &quot;Geats&quot; appear in the writings of the Greek Ptolemaios (as &quot;Goutai&quot;), and they appear as &quot;Gautigoths&quot; in Jordanes&#x27; work in the 6th century. The province of Västergötland represents the heartland of Götaland, once an independent petty kingdom with a long line of Geatish kings. These are mainly described in foreign sources (Frankish) and through legends. It is possible that Västergötland had the same king as the rest of Sweden at the time of the monk Ansgar&#x27;s mission to Sweden in the 9th century, but both the date and nature of its inclusion into the Swedish kingdom is a matter of much debate. Some date it as early as the 6th century, based on the Swedish-Geatish wars in &quot;Beowulf&quot; epos; others date it as late as the 12th century.

Västergötland received much early influence from the British Isles and is generally considered to be the bridgehead of Christianity&#x27;s advance into Sweden. Recent excavations at Varnhem suggest that at least its central parts were Christian in the 9th century. Around 1000, King Olof Skötkonung is held to have received baptism in Husaby, near lake Vänern. However, the Christianization was met with heavy opposition in the rest of his kingdom, and so Olof had to restrict the Christian activities to Västergötland. The Christian faith spread, and by the time the provincial law &quot;Västgötalagen&quot; was written in the 13th century, Västergötland had 517 churches. The seat of the area&#x27;s diocese seems to originally have been Husaby, but since 1150 the city of Skara (just some 20 kilometers; 10 miles south) held that distinction.

From the election of King Stenkil in the 11th century, Swedish and Geatish dynasties vied for the control of Sweden during long civil wars. For instance, the Swedish king Ragnvald Knaphövde was elected king by the Swedes, but when he entered Västergötland, he chose not to demand hostage from the powerful Geatish clans and was slain by the Geats near Falköping. Several times, Västergötland was independent from Sweden with kings such as Inge I of Sweden and Magnus the Strong. In later years the area was progressively tied more closely to the Swedish kingdom.

Being in peace with the rest of Sweden did not mean being in peace. Located along the borders of Denmark (with the so-called Scanian lands) and Norway (with Bohuslän), the area was often involved in armed disputes and invaded by hostile armies.

Some places and dates of early battles were the Battle of Älgarås (1205), the Battle of Lena (1208), the Battle of Hova (1275), the Battle of Gälakvist (1279) and the Battle of Falköping (1389). Thereafter, Sweden was involved in the Sweden-Danish wars; some notable years 1452, 1511, 1520, 1566, 1612, 1676.

In 1658, the current borders of Sweden were established when Sweden annexed both the Scanian lands and Bohuslän. Västergötland became less exposed as it was further from the country borders. Seaside battles at the end of Scanian War in the 1670s was the last combat on Västergötland soil.

=== 16th century and after ===
In 1634, the province was modernized with the establishment of two counties: Skaraborg County (with Skara as capital) and Älvsborg County (Capital first in Gothenburg but after 1679 in Vänersborg).

== Culture ==
=== Language ===
In Västergötland, the Götamål dialect of Swedish is spoken. The dialect has several varieties like the ones spoken in Gothenburg and Sjuhärad, but the main dialectal variety is the Western Götaland dialect, &quot;Västgötska&quot;.

The dialect was first dealt with as early as 1772, by S. Hofs in his &quot;Dialectus vestrogothica&quot;, which was a vocabulary with a grammar introduction.

=== Sights ===

Läckö Castle is situated on the island &quot;Kållandsö&quot; in the Vänern lake. It is generally regarded as one of Sweden&#x27;s finest Baroque castles. The island was actually the location of a fortress as early as 1298, but the current building was begun in 1615, supervised first by Jacob De la Gardie and then finished by his son Magnus Gabriel de la Gardie.

Karlsborg Fortress, the largest fortress in Europe, is situated in the town of Karlsborg. It is a testament to the &quot;Central Defence Principle&quot; of the 19th century, a reaction to the loss of Finland as a buffer state in 1809.

Bjurum manor, one of the largest Swedish manors in the country, is located in Västergötland.

Skara Cathedral is the oldest cathedral in the original parts of Sweden, i.e. if Scania is not included.

== Hundreds ==
Hundreds of Sweden were sub-divisions of the Swedish provinces until the early 20th century. Several of Västergötland&#x27;s hundreds were already described in the first written law for the province (&quot;Västgötalagen&quot;) in the 13th century. Västergötland&#x27;s hundreds were:

<text>Tadley is a town and civil parish in the Basingstoke and Deane district of Hampshire, England, north of Basingstoke and south west of Reading.

During the 1950s and 1960s, the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment (AWRE), now known as AWE, became the area&#x27;s largest employer, and many houses were built during this period to accommodate AWRE workers. Though the establishment was located in the parish of Aldermaston, most of these houses were built in Tadley.

== History ==

The origin of the name is uncertain. In old maps and books Tadley can be found spelled as &quot;Taddanleage&quot;, &quot;Tederlei&quot;, &quot;Titherley&quot;, &quot;Tudurley&quot;, &quot;Tadel&quot; and &quot;Taddeley&quot;. As with many other rural British communities, it is assumed that the village began as a clearing in the dense forest which at one time covered the greater part of England. In Old English, &quot;Tadde&quot; means &#x27;Toad&#x27; or &#x27;Frog&#x27; and &quot;ley&quot; being &#x27;a clearing in the woods&#x27;, so it possibly means &quot;a clearing in the woods with frogs&quot;. Most sources, however, say that the name means &quot;woodland clearing of a man called &quot;Tada&quot;&quot;.

In 909, Edward the Elder granted the &#x27;Manor of Overton&#x27; to Frithstan, Bishop of Winchester. In the confirmation of this a wood at Tadley is mentioned. The village is mentioned frequently in documents relating to the grant. There was an independent estate in the parish called the &#x27;Manor of Tadley&#x27; but later was known as the &#x27;Manor of Withford or Wyford&#x27;. In 1166 this property was held by William Hotot. He was succeeded by his son, Robert Hotot in 1205. The first reference to a church at Tadley is in 1286 when Andrew Hotot is recorded as owning the Manor and Church. It could be assumed that a settlement and therefore a church existed at an earlier date in view of the documented references to owners of land at Tadley from 909.

Tadley Place on Church Lane is a Grade II listed building which includes part of the former Tudor manor house. It was the home of the 17th century MP Sir Henry Ludlow.

==Governance==
Tadley is a civil parish with an elected town council Tadley Town Council which consists of 4 parish wards, Central Tadley, South Tadley, North Tadley and East Tadley. These occupy some or all of three wards of Basingstoke and Deane District Council, being Baughurst and Tadley North, Tadley Central and Tadley South. Tadley falls within the area of Basingstoke and Deane Borough Council and of Hampshire County Council and all three councils are responsible for different aspects of local government.

==Geography==
Tadley lies next to the northern border of Hampshire, where it meets Berkshire.

It is north of Basingstoke, south west of the town of Reading and south east of Newbury.

Nearby villages are Aldermaston, Baughurst, Pamber Heath, Heath End, Bramley, Mortimer Common, and Silchester.
On the edge of Tadley is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) called Ron Ward&#x27;s Meadow With Tadley Pastures.

==Economy==
The growth in shopping facilities has been slower than the growth in the population. Though there are shops in small groups throughout the town, there are only two significantly-sized shops, both supermarkets.

The main shopping areas in Tadley are on Mulfords Hill and Bishopswood Road, though there are isolated shops in other parts of the town and parish. A notable business in Mulfords Hill is that of the Royal Warrant Holder for Besom Brooms and Pea Sticks, also supplying besom brooms for the Harry Potter series of films.

==Culture and community==

Hampshire County Council built a new library for Tadley in 1994. It was opened on 12 October 1994 by Dame Mary Fagan, the Lord Lieutenant of Hampshire.

A local legend dating from the late 19th century claims that there were treacle mines located in the village, and until well into the 20th century the locals were referred to as &quot;Tadley Treacle Miners&quot;. Tadley holds an annual &quot;Treacle Fair&quot; in honour of this legend in early June. It is organised by the Loddon Valley Lions Club, a member of Lions Club International.

==Sport and leisure==

Tadley has a Non-League football club Tadley Calleva F.C., which plays at Barlow&#x27;s Park.
Tadley RFC is an amateur rugby club based at Frank Jose Park, Red Lane.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC South and ITV Meridian. Television signals are received from the Hannington TV transmitter. 

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Berkshire on 104.1 FM, Heart South on 102.9 FM and, Greatest Hits Radio Berkshire &amp; North Hampshire on 107.6 FM.

The town is served by the local newspapers,&quot;Basingstoke Gazette&quot;, &quot;Basingstoke Observer&quot; and &quot;Hampshire Chronicle&quot;.

==Transport==

===Road===
The main road through the town is the A340, which begins in Basingstoke to the south and ends in Pangbourne in Berkshire, north of Tadley.

===Bus===
Tadley is served by Stagecoach South with a regular service to Basingstoke.

===Rail===
Tadley does not have a railway station, but is served by ( north), Bramley ( south east) and ( south).

==Education==
Children aged 11 to 16 that receive state-funded education are likely to attend The Hurst School, though this school is actually located in the adjacent village of Baughurst.

Primary schools in the area include: Bishopswood Infant and Junior Schools, Burnham Copse Primary School, Silchester Church of England Primary School, Tadley Community Primary School, and The Priory Primary School.

==Notable residents==
Dean Horrix, was part of the Reading football team that won promotion to the Football League Third Division in 1984 and the Football League Second Division in 1986, lived in Tadley. He remained in the area after leaving Reading for Millwall in 1988 and being transferred to Bristol City in early 1990.

<text>The Battle of Clontarf () took place on 23 April 1014 at Clontarf, near Dublin, on the east coast of Ireland. It pitted an army led by Brian Boru, High King of Ireland, against a Norse-Irish alliance comprising the forces of Sigtrygg Silkbeard, King of Dublin; Máel Mórda mac Murchada, King of Leinster; and a Viking army from abroad led by Sigurd of Orkney and Brodir of Mann. It lasted from sunrise to sunset, and ended in a rout of the Viking and Leinster armies.

It is estimated that between 7,000 and 10,000 men were killed in the battle, including most of the leaders. Although Brian&#x27;s forces were victorious, Brian himself was killed, as were his son Murchad and his grandson Toirdelbach. Leinster king Máel Mórda and Viking leaders Sigurd and Brodir were also slain. After the battle, the power of the Vikings and the Kingdom of Dublin was largely broken.

The battle was an important event in Irish history and is recorded in both Irish and Norse chronicles. In Ireland, the battle came to be seen as an event that freed the Irish from foreign domination, and Brian was hailed as a national hero. This view was especially popular during the period of British rule in Ireland. Although the battle has come to be viewed in a more critical light, it still has a hold on the popular imagination.

== Background ==

The Vikings (or Norsemen) began carrying out raids on Gaelic Ireland in the late eighth century, and over the following few decades they founded a number of settlements along the coast. Vikings first established themselves in Dublin in 838 when they built a fortified area, or &quot;&quot;, there. During the tenth century, Viking Dublin developed into the Kingdom of Dublin—a thriving town and a large area of the surrounding countryside, whose rulers controlled extensive territories in the Irish Sea and, at one time, York. Over time, many Vikings were assimilated into Gaelic society and became the Norse-Gaels. Dublin was closely involved in the affairs of the Kingdom of the Isles, which included the Isle of Man and the Hebrides, and when the Dublin king Amlaíb Cuarán was defeated by Máel Sechnaill mac Domnaill at the Battle of Tara in 980, he was supported by the men of the Isles. Amlaíb&#x27;s son, Sigtrygg Silkbeard, who was King of Dublin from 990, allied himself with his uncle Máel Mórda mac Murchada, King of Leinster. They met Máel Sechnaill mac Domnaill and Brian Boru at the Battle of Glenmama in 999, where they were defeated.

From the time of the seventh century and the reign of Domnall mac Áedo, the kingship of Tara was a title which was strongly associated with the high kingship of Ireland and was held by members of the Uí Néill dynasty, who controlled the northern half of Ireland. In the tenth century, the Dál gCais, until then a small kingdom in what is now County Clare, began to expand. By the time of his death in 951, Cennétig mac Lorcáin had become King of Thomond. His son, Mathgamain mac Cennétig, was King of Munster when he died in 976. Mathgamain&#x27;s brother, Brian Boru, quickly asserted his claim to the kingship of Munster, then invaded Leinster and gained its submission. In 998 he attacked the Uí Néill stronghold of Meath. Máel Sechnaill responded by attacking Munster in 999, and over the following years the two kings struggled for supremacy in Ireland. In 997, Brian and Máel Sechnaill met in Clonfert and reached an agreement where they recognised each other&#x27;s reign over their respective halves of the country—Máel Sechnaill in the north and Brian in the south. Brian received the hostages of Leinster and Dublin from Máel Seachnaill, and surrendered the hostages of Connacht to him. The peace was short-lived. After they had jointly defeated the Vikings at Glenmama, Brian resumed his attacks on Máel Seachnaill. He marched on Tara in 1000 with the combined armies of Munster, Osraige, Leinster, and Dublin, but after an advance party consisting of the latter two groups was destroyed by Máel Sechnaill, Brian Boru withdrew from the area without giving battle. In 1002 he marched with the same army to Athlone, and took the hostages of Connacht and Meath. He was now the undisputed High King of Ireland.

==Revolt of Dublin and Leinster==
Brian consolidated his hold on Ireland by eventually obtaining the submission of the northern territories of Cenél nEógain, Cenél Conaill, and Ulaid, following a series of circuits of the northern part of the island. He completed the task when, following &quot;a great hosting...by land and sea&quot; into the Uí Néill territory of Cenél Conaill in 1011, the King was brought south to Dál gCais territory to submit to Brian Boru in person at his royal site of Cenn Corad. It was not long, however, before fighting was renewed. Flaithbertach Ua Néill, King of the Cenél nEógain, resented the rise of Brian Boru. Had the old political order persisted, Flaithbertach would have been in line to succeed to the high-kingship. He attacked his Cenél Conaill neighbours in 1012 but, while doing so, Máel Seachnaill attacked the Cenél nEógain inauguration site of Tullahoge. Flaithbertach in turn raided Meath the following year and Máel Sechnaill was forced to back down. Sigtrygg and Máel Mórda took advantage, and themselves raided Meath. Máel Sechnaill sent his army to raid the hinterland north of Dublin as far as Howth but he was defeated. He lost two hundred men including his son Flann. Sigtrygg then sent a fleet along the coast to attack the Munster town of Cork, but that was defeated, and Sigtrygg&#x27;s nephew was killed. A full-scale conflict was inevitable. Brian brought his army to Leinster in 1013, and camped outside Dublin from September until the end of the year.

Sigtrygg went overseas in search of Viking support and enlisted the help of Sigurd Hlodvirsson, the Earl of Orkney and Brodir, a warrior of the Isle of Man. According to the Icelandic &quot;Njáls saga&quot;, Sigtrygg promised both men the kingship of Ireland if they defeated Brian. In early 1014, Sveinn Forkbeard, King of Denmark, had invaded and become the first Norse king of England.

The Viking fleets of Orkney and Mann sailed into Dublin in Holy Week 1014. Brian mustered the army of Munster, which was joined by Máel Sechnaill and two Connacht kings, Mael Ruanaidh Ua hEidhin, King of Uí Fiachrach Aidhne, and Tadhg Ua Cellaigh, King of Uí Maine, and they marched on Dublin.

== Battle ==

No order of battle is given in the contemporary sources; the only leaders named are those who died in the battle. The nearest contemporary accounts are the Annals of Inisfallen and the Annals of Ulster. Among the fallen on Brian&#x27;s side, they name the High King himself, his son Murchad, and his grandson Toirdelbach, as well as his nephew Conaing, Domnall mac Diarmata of Corcu Baiscind (County Clare), Mac Bethad mac Muiredaig of Ciarraige Luachra (County Kerry), Mael Ruanaidh Ua hEidhin of Uí Fiachrach Aidhne, and Tadhg Ua Cellaigh of Uí Maine (both in south Connacht). The Annals of the Four Masters note several other significant deaths, including Eocha, son of Dunadhach, Chief of Clann-Scannail; Tadhg Ua Ceallaigh, lord of Ui Maine; Maelruanaidh na Paidre Ua hEidhin, lord of Aidhne; Geibheannach, son of Dubhagan, lord of Feara-Maighe; Mac-Beatha, son of Muireadhach Claen, lord of Ciarraighe-Luachra; Scannail, son of Cathal, lord of Eóganacht Locha Léin; and Domhnall, son of Eimhin, son of Cainneach, great steward of Mair in Alba (modern Scotland).

On the opposing side are named Máel Morda, Dubgall mac Amlaíb (brother of Sigtrygg), Gilla Ciaráin mac Glún Iairn (probably a nephew of Sigtrygg), Sigurd Hlodvirsson of Orkney, and Brodir, commander of the Viking fleet. No notables from Meath are recorded among the slain; leading to the suggestion that, if present, Máel Sechnaill kept himself and his forces out of harm&#x27;s way. But the Annals of Ulster say that Máel Sechnaill and Brian rode together to Dublin, and the Annals of the Four Masters go so far as to say that it was Máel Sechnaill who won the day, and completed the rout after the death of Brian. On the other hand, &quot;Cogad Gáedel re Gallaib&quot; (&quot;The War of the Irish with the Foreigners&quot;), says that the men of Meath came to the muster with Brian, but &quot;were not faithful to him&quot;.

According to the &quot;Cogad&quot;, after his arrival at Dublin, Brian sent his forces north across the river to plunder the area known as &quot;Fine Gall&quot;, and they torched the country as far as Howth. Brian, now in his seventies, did not go with them but stayed behind to pray. The Dublin forces set out by land, and were joined at Clontarf at high tide by the Viking fleet that was in Dublin Bay.

The front line of the Dublin-Leinster forces were the foreign Vikings, led by Brodir, Sigurd, and a man called Plait, described as &quot;the bravest knight of all the foreigners&quot;. Behind them were the men of Dublin, commanded by Dubgall mac Amlaíb and Gilla Ciaráin mac Glún Iairn. Behind them again came the Leinstermen, headed by Máel Mórda. Sigtrygg remained in Dublin with enough men to defend it should the battle go against them. He watched the battle from the walls with his wife Sláine, the daughter of Brian.

At the front of Brian&#x27;s forces were the Dál gCais, led by Brian&#x27;s son Murchad, Murchad&#x27;s fifteen-year-old son Toirdelbach, Brian&#x27;s brother Cudulligh, and Domnall mac Diarmata of Corcu Baiscind. Behind them were the other forces of Munster, commanded by Mothla mac Domnaill mic Fáeláin, King of the Déisi Muman, and Magnus mac Amchada, King of Uí Liatháin. Next came the Connachta, led by Mael Ruanaidh Ua hEidhin and Tadhg Ua Cellaigh. Also alongside was Ó Fearghail lords of Annaly. To one side of them were Brian&#x27;s Viking allies; Fergal ua Ruairc, with the Uí Briúin and the Conmhaícne was placed on the left flank. After the Connachta came Máel Sechnaill and the men of Meath, but (the &quot;Cogad&quot; says) he had made an agreement with the men of Dublin that if he would not attack them, they would not attack him.

The battle opened with Plait taunting Domnall mac Eimín, a Scottish ally of Brian. The two men marched out into the middle of the field and fought, and both died, &quot;with the sword of each through the heart of the other, and the hair of each in the clenched hand of the other.&quot;

Then the battle proper got under way. It is described in the &quot;Cogad&quot; as remarkably loud and bloody. The men of Connacht fought the men of Dublin, and the fighting was so fierce that only 100 Connachtmen and twenty Dublinmen survived. The last casualties occurred at &quot;Dubgall&#x27;s Bridge&quot;, which Seán Duffy suggests was a bridge over the River Tolka, on the road back to Dublin. Brian&#x27;s son Murchad, at the head of the Dál gCais army, took on the foreign Vikings and, according to the &quot;Cogad&quot;, he himself killed 100 of the enemy—fifty with the sword in his right hand and fifty with the sword in his left. The Vikings wore mail; the Irish did not. Yet the Irish gained the advantage, partly through the use of small spears, which they hurled at the enemy, and partly through numerical superiority.

The battle, which had begun at first light, lasted all day. Eventually, the Dublin-Leinster forces broke, and some withdrew towards their ships, while others made for a nearby wood. However, the tide had come in again, cutting off the passage to the wood, but also carrying off the Viking ships. With no way out, they were killed in large numbers, many of them by drowning. Samuel Haughton, in 1860, calculated that the tide at Clontarf would have been high at 5:30 am and again at 5:55 pm, which is consistent with the account in the &quot;Cogad&quot;. It was at this point that Brian&#x27;s grandson Toirdelbach was killed. He pursued the enemy into the sea, but was hit by a wave and thrown up against the weir, and drowned. Murchad killed Sigurd, the earl of Orkney, but shortly afterwards he himself was killed. Brian was in his tent praying when Brodir found him, and killed him. Brodir himself was then killed, possibly by Ulf the Quarrelsome. According to the Cogad Gáedel re Gallaib, Brian was visited by a Banshee-like spirit named Aibhill prior to the battle who warned him of his impending demise.

== Aftermath ==

Brian&#x27;s body was brought to Swords, north of Dublin. There it was met by the coarb of Patrick, the traditional head of the church in Ireland, who brought the body back with him to Armagh, where it was interred after twelve days of mourning. Along with Brian were the body of Murchad and the heads of Conaing, Brian&#x27;s nephew, and Mothla, King of the Déisi Muman. Máel Sechnaill was restored as High King of Ireland, and remained secure in his position until his death in 1022.

Though the Annals imply that life was not much changed after the death of Brian Boru, it created a succession crisis, as Brian&#x27;s son and heir Murchad had died as well. Brian had two remaining sons who could challenge for the kingship: Donnchad mac Briain, his son with Gormflaith and Tadc mac Briain, his son with Echrad. According to the annals, Donnchad rallied the forces of the Dál gCais at Clontarf and led them home to Cenn Corad.

Within weeks the Dál gCais, under the new leadership of Donnchad, were battling their old masters in Munster, the Eóganacht Raithlind. Tadc initially joined his brother against the Eóganacht, but Donnchad ordered his killing in 1023.

Sigtrygg remained King of Dublin until 1036, and was apparently secure enough to go on pilgrimage to Rome in 1028. However, after Clontarf, Dublin had been reduced to a lesser power. In 1052, Diarmait mac Máel na mBó, King of Leinster, captured Dublin and &quot;Fine Gall&quot;, for the first time asserting Irish overlordship over the Norse of Ireland.

==Historical debate==

In modern times there has been a long-running debate among historians, which is now 250 years old, about Ireland&#x27;s Viking age and the Battle of Clontarf. The standard view, and the &quot;popular&quot; view, is that the battle ended a war between the Irish and Vikings by which Brian Boru broke Viking power in Ireland. However revisionist historians see it as an Irish civil war in which Brian Boru&#x27;s Munster and its allies defeated Leinster and Dublin, and that there were Vikings fighting on both sides. In January 2018, researchers from the Universities of Coventry, Oxford and Sheffield, led by Coventry University theoretical physicist Professor Ralph Kenna, published a paper in the journal &quot;Royal Society Open Science&quot;, that used network science to mathematically analyse a medieval text, &quot;Cogadh Gáedhel re Gallaibh&quot; (The War of the Gaedhil with the Gaill, meaning invasions of Ireland by the Danes and other Norsemen), that listed over 1000 relationships between about 300 characters, and concluded that the standard and popular view was broadly correct, but that the picture was nevertheless more complex than &quot;a fully &#x27;clear-cut&#x27; Irish versus Viking conflict&quot;. However one of the paper&#x27;s co-authors, PhD student Joseph Yose, added that &quot;Our statistical analysis ... cannot decisively resolve the debate&quot;.

<doc id="155553" wikidata="Q1068185" url="?curid=155553" title="Detroit Symphony Orchestra">
<text>The Detroit Symphony Orchestra (DSO) is an American orchestra based in Detroit, Michigan. Its primary performance venue is Orchestra Hall at the Max M. Fisher Music Center in Detroit&#x27;s Midtown neighborhood. Jader Bignamini is the current music director of the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, with Enrico Lopez-Yañez as Principal Pops Conductor, Tabita Berglund as Principal Guest Conductor and Na&#x27;Zir McFadden as assistant conductor. Leonard Slatkin, the previous music director, is the orchestra&#x27;s current music director laureate. Neeme Järvi, music director from 1990 to 2005, is the orchestra&#x27;s current music director emeritus.

==History==
===Founding and growth===

The DSO performed the first concert of its first subscription season at 8:00 p.m. on Monday, Dec. 19, 1887 at the Detroit Opera House. The conductor was Rudolph Speil. He was succeeded in subsequent seasons by a variety of conductors until 1900 when Hugo Kalsow was appointed and served until the orchestra ceased operations in 1910. The Detroit Symphony resumed operations in 1914 when ten Detroit society women each contributed $100 to the organization and pledged to find 100 additional subscribers. They soon hired a music director, Weston Gales, a 27-year-old church organist from Boston, who led the first performance of the reconstituted orchestra on February 26, 1914, again at the old Detroit Opera House.

The appointment of the Russian pianist Ossip Gabrilowitsch as music director in 1918 brought instant status to the new orchestra. A friend of composers Gustav Mahler and Sergei Rachmaninoff, Gabrilowitsch demanded that a new auditorium be built as a condition of his accepting the position. Orchestra Hall was constructed in 1919 in four months and twenty-three days. Under Gabrilowitsch, the Detroit Symphony Orchestra quickly became one of the most prominent orchestras in the country, performing with the leading artists of the day. In 1922, the orchestra gave the world&#x27;s first radio broadcast of a symphony orchestra concert with Gabrilowitsch conducting and guest artist Artur Schnabel at the piano. Gabrilowitsch was music director until his death in 1936. From 1934 to 1942, the orchestra performed for millions across the country as the official orchestra of &quot;The Ford Sunday Evening Hour&quot; (later the Ford Symphony Hour) national radio show.

In 1939, three years after Gabrilowitsch&#x27;s death, the orchestra moved from Orchestra Hall to the Masonic Temple Theatre due to major financial problems caused by the Great Depression. In the 1940s, the orchestra disbanded twice and moved to three different performing venues. In 1946, the orchestra moved to the Wilson Theater which was renamed Music Hall. In 1956, the orchestra moved to Ford Auditorium on the waterfront of the Detroit River, where it remained for the next 33 years. The orchestra once again enjoyed national prestige under music director Paul Paray, winning numerous awards for its 70 recordings on the Mercury label. Paray was followed by noted music directors Sixten Ehrling, Aldo Ceccato, Antal Doráti, and Günther Herbig.

In popular music, members of the orchestra provided the recorded string accompaniments on many of Motown Records&#x27;s classic hits of the 1960s, usually under the direction of the orchestra&#x27;s concertmaster of the time, Gordon Staples. Two Motown albums featured the strings with the Motown rhythm section the Funk Brothers. The combined ensemble was known as the San Remo Golden Strings and enjoyed two hit singles: &quot;Hungry for Love&quot; (#3 Billboard Adult Contemporary) and &quot;I&#x27;m Satisfied&quot; (#89 U.S. Pop). In 1966, members of the orchestra were seen recording in the Motown studio on West Grand Boulevard with The Supremes for the ABC TV documentary &quot;Anatomy of Pop: The Music Explosion&quot;. The song they perform is the hit &quot;My World Is Empty Without You&quot; by Holland, Dozier, and Holland. There were two full albums released by the group: &quot;Hungry for Love&quot; (1967) and &quot;Swing&quot; (1968) both on the Gordy label (a subsidiary of Motown).

In 1970, the DSO instituted the Detroit Symphony Youth Orchestra as a training group, under Paul Freeman.

===The Neeme Järvi era===
In 1989, following a 20-year rescue and restoration effort, the Detroit Symphony Orchestra returned to Orchestra Hall. Further renovations to the hall were completed in 2003, including a $60 million addition and a recital hall and education wing, the Max M. Fisher Music Center. A fine arts high school, the Detroit School of Arts, was added to the DSO campus in 2004.

Neeme Järvi began his music directorship in 1990, and served through 2005, the second-longest in the orchestra&#x27;s history. Järvi now has the title of music director emeritus with the orchestra. Following Järvi&#x27;s departure, the DSO named Peter Oundjian as its principal guest conductor and artistic advisor for a 2-year period, from 2006 to 2008.

===Post-Neeme Järvi===
After a five-year search, the DSO announced on October 7, 2007, the appointment of Leonard Slatkin as its twelfth music director. In February 2010, the orchestra announced the extension of Slatkin&#x27;s contract as DSO music director through the 2012–2013 season. Slatkin took a salary reduction to help relieve the orchestra&#x27;s financial difficulties. In December 2014, the DSO announced an extension of Slatkin&#x27;s contract as music director through the 2017–2018 season. With the 2018–2019 season, Slatkin took the title of music director laureate, the first former DSO music director to be granted that title.

===2010–2011 DSO musicians strike and aftermath===
A labor dispute prompted DSO musicians to strike on October 4, 2010. On February 19, 2011, after the musicians rejected a final offer made on February 15, 2011, DSO management announced it would suspend the remainder of the 2010–2011 concert season. Following a six-month strike, the musicians and management reached an agreement on April 3, 2011. Concerts resumed April 9, 2011, with a weekend of free concerts. The DSO&#x27;s first weekend back, tickets for all concerts were priced at $20. The DSO instituted similar &quot;patron-minded pricing&quot; for the 2011–12 season with most seats to all classical concerts priced at $15 or $25.

On the anniversary of the strike a member of the musicians&#x27; negotiating committee, violinist Marian Tanau, spoke to the &quot;World Socialist Web Site&quot; about the new conditions. He remarked on the loss of significant members of the orchestra and the prevalence of substitute musicians, leading to a slight decline in quality. Tanau claimed that the 30% wage cut and loss of prestige meant that the DSO could no longer attract the &quot;best of the best&quot;.

Since the DSO returned to the stage in April 2011, the orchestra reorganised its activities under the umbrella term of &#x27;OneDSO&#x27;, with new work in such areas as community engagement and digital accessibility. The Neighborhood Series attracted new subscribers for the orchestra in venues around metro Detroit, helping to increase total subscription growth of nearly 25% from 2011 to 2014.

===Recent history===
In 2013, the DSO returned to Carnegie Hall for the first time in 17 years to perform in the Spring for Music Festival. In January 2014, the DSO announced that board, musicians, and management agreed to a new three-year contract eight months before the current one expired.

In June 2018, Jader Bignamini first guest-conducted the DSO, as an emergency substitute for Slatkin. Bignamini returned in October 2019 for a further guest-conducting engagement with the orchestra. In January 2020, the DSO announced the appointment of Bignamini as its next music director, effective with the 2020–2021 season, with an initial contract of 6 seasons. In December 2023, the orchestra announced the extension of Bignamini&#x27;s contract as music director through the 2030-2031 season.

In October 2023, the DSO announced the appointment of Enrico Lopez-Yañez to succeed Jeff Tyzik as Principal Pops Conductor. Tyzik had served as the DSO’s Principal Pops Conductor since 2013.

In January 2023, Tabita Berglund first guest-conducted the orchestra. In February 2024, the DSO announced the appointment of Berglund as its next principal guest conductor, effective with the 2024-2025 season, with an initial contract of four seasons. Berglund is the first female conductor to be named to this post with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra.

Anne Parsons was the orchestra&#x27;s president and chief executive officer from 2004 until her death in March 2022. In December 2021, the orchestra announced the appointment of Erik Rӧnmark as its next president and chief executive officer, effective March 2022.

===Media activities===
On April 10, 2011, the DSO launched &#x27;Live from Orchestra Hall&#x27;, the first free webcast series by an orchestra. During classical weekends, DSO concerts are streamed live to a worldwide audience. On October 9, 2010, the DSO expanded the series to mobile devices through the DSO to Go mobile app for iOS and Android devices. Live from Orchestra Hall has been viewed by more than 550,000 viewers in over 100 countries since its inception. On October 7, 2012, the DSO webcast its first Pops concert, &#x27;Cirque de la Symphonie&#x27;, which was also projected onto the building for the general public for the orchestra&#x27;s first ever, larger-than-life &quot;MaxCast&quot;.

The symphony has produced many recordings on the Victor, London, Decca, Mercury, RCA, Chandos and DSO labels. The DSO recording of Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot; was the first CD to win the Grand Prix du Disque award. The DSO has recently recorded for the Naxos label, including music of Rachmaninoff, Aaron Copland, and John Williams. In early 2010, George Blood Audio and Video [of Philadelphia] began transferring recordings, dating back to the 1959–1960 concert season, to the digital medium.

<text>First Choice Airways Limited was a British charter airline of European tour operator TUI Travel plc, based in Crawley, England until its merger with Thomsonfly to form Thomson Airways (now TUI Airways) in 2008. It flew to more than 60 destinations worldwide from 14 UK and Irish airports. 70% of the airline&#x27;s services were operated for its parent company, rising to 85% in the summer season, with the remainder on behalf of some 120 other tour operators. It also operated scheduled year-round leisure routes to Cyprus and the resorts of Spain and Portugal.

Its hubs were Birmingham Airport, London Gatwick Airport (primary hub), and Manchester Airport. The long haul services were sold only by internal companies such as First Choice Holidays, Eclipse Direct, Sunsail, Sovereign, Hayes and Jarvis and Unijet. The airline also operated luxury &#x27;Around The World&#x27; flights each winter on behalf of TCS Expeditions. 

The company held a United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority Type A Operating Licence, permitting it to carry passengers, cargo and mail on aircraft with 20 or more seats.

==History==
===Air 2000===

The airline started operations on 11 April 1987, launched by the Owners Abroad Group under the name Air 2000, with two Boeing 757-200s and a flight from Manchester to Málaga. The 757s were re-equipped for extended range and flights to the United States began in 1989. Their fleet doubled a year later, with one aircraft being based at Glasgow Airport. In the same year, the airline set up a subsidiary in Canada, to be called &quot;Air 2000 Airline Ltd&quot;. This subsidiary lasted only a few days before the Canadian government suspended its licence. The second attempt was more successful and became Canada 3000.

Long haul services to Mombasa in Kenya were introduced during the 1988/89 season. The airline was granted a licence for scheduled operations by the CAA in 1992, which commenced in 1993, initially between London-Gatwick and Paphos, Cyprus. Scheduled services were distinguished by the use of the &#x27;DP&#x27; identifier with the flight number, while purely-charter flights used the &#x27;AMM&#x27; identifier. Over the next few years scheduled routes to Cyprus from Birmingham, Glasgow, Manchester and Newcastle were introduced. 

Expansion saw new bases in the UK established, with Dublin becoming the airline&#x27;s first overseas hub in 1996. Leisure International Airways was fully integrated after the acquisition by First Choice of Unijet in June 1998. This included the entire fleet of aircraft, and an order for four Airbus A330-200s, which First Choice immediately cancelled in favor of the rival Boeing 767-300ER. In 2000, additional scheduled services were introduced from eight UK airports to six major Spanish and Portuguese holiday destinations. Air 2000 received a new colour scheme which, by March 2004, the &quot;Air 2000&quot; branding was removed and &quot;First Choice Airways&quot; branding added.

===First Choice===
The airline carried 6.5 million passengers during 2002. The 2005 total was 6.0 million - fifth highest passenger figures of any UK airline. In 2004 it announced plans to refurbish another six Boeing 767-300 aircraft to expand its long haul operations. The airline was the first in the UK to use the Boeing 777-style interior on their 767 fleet. The company had six aircraft flying long haul in 2007, in a two class layout, 63 Premium, 195 Economy. All seats featured Panasonic seat back entertainment and mood lighting in Star Class Premier.

On 23 April 2007, First Choice confirmed it is to close its bases at London Luton Airport and Cardiff from 1 November 2007 however due to the merger with Thomsonfly who also operate from these bases, the combined airline will still operate from these bases.

===Merger with Thomsonfly===
In March 2008, the tourism division of the airline&#x27;s parent group TUI AG, merged with First Choice Holidays PLC, forming the new company TUI Travel. Both Thomsonfly and First Choice Airways would be merged as Thomson Airways.

Thomsonfly Limited changed its name to Thomson Airways Limited in November 2008 and the Thomsonfly operating certificate was changed to Thomson Airways with effect from 1 November 2008. On that date, Thomsonfly and First Choice Airways both rebranded their operations to Thomson Airways, merging with a fleet of 75 aircraft. There is however an order of 12 new Boeing 787 aircraft which will make the fleet 75 once more.

As of 2 October 2017, Thomson Airways began operating under TUI Airways, leaving any vestige of UK travel heritage behind.

==Corporate affairs==

The head office was located in the First Choice House in Crawley, West Sussex. When First Choice was an independent airline, 450 employees worked there. After the merger with Thomsonfly, TUI moved employees out. The final 70-80 employees were relocated to the former Air 2000 offices at Gatwick Airport.

==Fleet==
===Final fleet===

The First Choice fleet included the following aircraft (at May 2008):

===Aircraft orders===
The airline would have been the UK launch customer for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, having placed a firm order for six aircraft in February 2005, with an option for a further six. In December 2006, the airline announced the purchase of a further two 787 Dreamliners, taking its order to eight aircraft. In March 2007 First Choice Airways announced it was converting all four remaining options to orders, bringing the total to 12 aircraft.

Although planned to enter service in summer 2009, delays to the Boeing 787 programme mean that First Choice Airways would not have been able to introduce the aircraft to the fleet until 2011. Each Boeing 787-8 would have replaced a Boeing 767-300 on long haul routes as they were delivered. The deliveries were expected to take around two years, with six aircraft expected to be based at Manchester Airport and the remainder based at London Gatwick Airport.

The 2008 merger with Thomsonfly meant the newly formed airline, Thomson Airways, inherited the orders and was the UK launch customer. Following the delays in Boeing&#x27;s development programme, the airline began flights with its first 787 in June 2013

==In-flight services==
First Choice Airways could include a three course meal pre-ordered for the flight; on First Choice-operated flights it was free of charge if the flight was a long haul flight, if the passengers booked a Premier Holiday. In addition the airline offered drinks, snacks, and sandwiches for purchase as part of a buy on board programme.

<doc id="155555" wikidata="Q861092" url="?curid=155555" title="Image registration">
<text>Image registration is the process of transforming different sets of data into one coordinate system. Data may be multiple photographs, data from different sensors, times, depths, or viewpoints. It is used in computer vision, medical imaging, military automatic target recognition, and compiling and analyzing images and data from satellites. Registration is necessary in order to be able to compare or integrate the data obtained from these different measurements.

== Algorithm classification ==

=== Intensity-based vs feature-based ===

Image registration or image alignment algorithms can be classified into intensity-based and feature-based. One of the images is referred to as the &quot;moving&quot; or &quot;source&quot; and the others are referred to as the &quot;target&quot;, &quot;fixed&quot; or &quot;sensed&quot; images. Image registration involves spatially transforming the source/moving image(s) to align with the target image. The reference frame in the target image is stationary, while the other datasets are transformed to match to the target. Intensity-based methods compare intensity patterns in images via correlation metrics, while feature-based methods find correspondence between image features such as points, lines, and contours. Intensity-based methods register entire images or sub-images. If sub-images are registered, centers of corresponding sub images are treated as corresponding feature points. Feature-based methods establish a correspondence between a number of especially distinct points in images. Knowing the correspondence between a number of points in images, a geometrical transformation is then determined to map the target image to the reference images, thereby establishing point-by-point correspondence between the reference and target images. Methods combining intensity-based and feature-based information have also been developed.

=== Transformation models ===

Image registration algorithms can also be classified according to the transformation models they use to relate the target image space to the reference image space. The first broad category of transformation models includes linear transformations, which include rotation, scaling, translation, and other affine transforms. Linear transformations are global in nature, thus, they cannot model local geometric differences between images.

The second category of transformations allow &#x27;elastic&#x27; or &#x27;nonrigid&#x27; transformations. These transformations are capable of locally warping the target image to align with the reference image. Nonrigid transformations include radial basis functions (thin-plate or surface splines, multiquadrics, and compactly-supported transformations), physical continuum models (viscous fluids), and large deformation models (diffeomorphisms).

Transformations are commonly described by a parametrization, where the model dictates the number of parameters. For instance, the translation of a full image can be described by a single parameter, a translation vector. These models are called parametric models. Non-parametric models on the other hand, do not follow any parameterization, allowing each image element to be displaced arbitrarily.

There are a number of programs that implement both estimation and application of a warp-field. It is a part of the SPM and AIR programs.

=== Transformations of coordinates via the law of function composition rather than addition ===
Alternatively, many advanced methods for spatial normalization are building on structure preserving transformations homeomorphisms and diffeomorphisms since they carry smooth submanifolds smoothly during transformation. Diffeomorphisms are generated in the modern field of Computational Anatomy based on flows since diffeomorphisms are not additive although they form a group, but a group under the law of function composition. For this reason, flows which generalize the ideas of additive groups allow for generating large deformations that preserve topology, providing 1-1 and onto transformations. Computational methods for generating such transformation are often called LDDMM which provide flows of diffeomorphisms as the main computational tool for connecting coordinate systems corresponding to the geodesic flows of Computational Anatomy.

There are a number of programs which generate diffeomorphic transformations of coordinates via diffeomorphic mapping including MRI Studio and MRI Cloud.org

=== Spatial vs frequency domain methods ===

Spatial methods operate in the image domain, matching intensity patterns or features in images. Some of the feature matching algorithms are outgrowths of traditional techniques for performing manual image registration, in which an operator chooses corresponding control points (CP) in images. When the number of control points exceeds the minimum required to define the appropriate transformation model, iterative algorithms like RANSAC can be used to robustly estimate the parameters of a particular transformation type (e.g. affine) for registration of the images.

Frequency-domain methods find the transformation parameters for registration of the images while working in the transform domain. Such methods work for simple transformations, such as translation, rotation, and scaling. Applying the phase correlation method to a pair of images produces a third image which contains a single peak. The location of this peak corresponds to the relative translation between the images. Unlike many spatial-domain algorithms, the phase correlation method is resilient to noise, occlusions, and other defects typical of medical or satellite images. Additionally, the phase correlation uses the fast Fourier transform to compute the cross-correlation between the two images, generally resulting in large performance gains. The method can be extended to determine rotation and scaling differences between two images by first converting the images to log-polar coordinates. Due to properties of the Fourier transform, the rotation and scaling parameters can be determined in a manner invariant to translation.

=== Single- vs multi-modality methods ===

Another classification can be made between single-modality and multi-modality methods. Single-modality methods tend to register images in the same modality acquired by the same scanner/sensor type, while multi-modality registration methods tended to register images acquired by different scanner/sensor types.

Multi-modality registration methods are often used in medical imaging as images of a subject are frequently obtained from different scanners. Examples include registration of brain CT/MRI images or whole body PET/CT images for tumor localization, registration of contrast-enhanced CT images against non-contrast-enhanced CT images for segmentation of specific parts of the anatomy, and registration of ultrasound and CT images for prostate localization in radiotherapy.

=== Automatic vs interactive methods ===

Registration methods may be classified based on the level of automation they provide. Manual, interactive, semi-automatic, and automatic methods have been developed. Manual methods provide tools to align the images manually. Interactive methods reduce user bias by performing certain key operations automatically while still relying on the user to guide the registration. Semi-automatic methods perform more of the registration steps automatically but depend on the user to verify the correctness of a registration. Automatic methods do not allow any user interaction and perform all registration steps automatically.

=== Similarity measures for image registration ===

Image similarities are broadly used in medical imaging. An image similarity measure quantifies the degree of similarity between intensity patterns in two images. The choice of an image similarity measure depends on the modality of the images to be registered. Common examples of image similarity measures include cross-correlation, mutual information, sum of squared intensity differences, and ratio image uniformity. Mutual information and normalized mutual information are the most popular image similarity measures for registration of multimodality images. Cross-correlation, sum of squared intensity differences and ratio image uniformity are commonly used for registration of images in the same modality.

Many new features have been derived for cost functions based on matching methods via large deformations have emerged in the field Computational Anatomy including 
Measure matching which are pointsets or landmarks without correspondence, Curve matching and Surface matching via mathematical currents and varifolds.

== Uncertainty ==
There is a level of uncertainty associated with registering images that have any spatio-temporal differences. A confident registration with a measure of uncertainty is critical for many change detection applications such as medical diagnostics.

In remote sensing applications where a digital image pixel may represent several kilometers of spatial distance (such as NASA&#x27;s LANDSAT imagery), an uncertain image registration can mean that a solution could be several kilometers from ground truth. Several notable papers have attempted to quantify uncertainty in image registration in order to compare results. However, many approaches to quantifying uncertainty or estimating deformations are computationally intensive or are only applicable to limited sets of spatial transformations.

== Applications ==

Image registration has applications in remote sensing (cartography updating), and computer vision. Due to the vast range of applications to which image registration can be applied, it is impossible to develop a general method that is optimized for all uses.

Medical image registration (for data of the same patient taken at different points in time such as change detection or tumor monitoring) often additionally involves &quot;elastic&quot; (also known as &quot;nonrigid&quot;) registration to cope with deformation of the subject (due to breathing, anatomical changes, and so forth). Nonrigid registration of medical images can also be used to register a patient&#x27;s data to an anatomical atlas, such as the Talairach atlas for neuroimaging. In other cases, nonrigid registration is explicitly not utilized since rigid registration methods preserve the underlying geometry, e.g., in inner ear imaging.&lt;ref name=&quot;DOI10.1038/s41598-025-90842-2&quot;&gt;J. Gerb, V. Kirsch, E. Kierig, Thomas Brandt, Marianne Dieterich, Rainer Boegle: &quot;Optimizing spatial normalization of multisubject inner ear MRI: comparison of different geometry-preserving co-registration approaches.&quot; In: &quot;Scientific Reports.&quot; 2025, Band 15, Nummer 1 .&lt;/ref&gt; 

In astrophotography, image alignment and stacking are often used to increase the signal to noise ratio for faint objects. Without stacking it may be used to produce a timelapse of events such as a planet&#x27;s rotation of a transit across the Sun. Using control points (automatically or manually entered), the computer performs transformations on one image to make major features align with a second or multiple images. This technique may also be used for images of different sizes, to allow images taken through different telescopes or lenses to be combined.

In cryo-TEM, instability causes specimen drift and many fast acquisitions with accurate image registration is required to preserve high resolution and obtain high signal to noise images. For low SNR data, the best image registration is achieved by cross-correlating all permutations of images in an image stack.

Image registration is an essential part of panoramic image creation. There are many different techniques that can be implemented in real time and run on embedded devices like cameras and camera-phones.

<text>Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), also known as Sandia, is one of three research and development laboratories of the United States Department of Energy&#x27;s National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA). Headquartered in Kirtland Air Force Base in Albuquerque, New Mexico, it has a second principal facility next to Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore, California, and a test facility in Waimea, Kauai, Hawaii. Sandia is owned by the U.S. federal government but privately managed and operated by National Technology and Engineering Solutions of Sandia, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International.

Established in 1949, SNL is a &quot;multimission laboratory&quot; with the primary goal of advancing U.S. national security by developing various science-based technologies. Its work spans roughly 70 areas of activity, including nuclear deterrence, arms control, nonproliferation, hazardous waste disposal, and climate change. Sandia hosts a wide variety of research initiatives, including computational biology, physics, materials science, alternative energy, psychology, MEMS, and cognitive science. Most notably, it hosted some of the world&#x27;s earliest and fastest supercomputers, ASCI Red and ASCI Red Storm, and is currently home to the Z Machine, the largest X-ray generator in the world, which is designed to test materials in conditions of extreme temperature and pressure.

Sandia conducts research through partnership agreements with academic, governmental, and commercial entities; educational opportunities are available through several programs, including the Securing Top Academic Research &amp; Talent at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (START HBCU) Program and the Sandia University Partnerships Network (a collaboration with Purdue University, University of Texas at Austin, Georgia Institute of Technology, University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign, and University of New Mexico).

== Lab history ==

Sandia National Laboratories&#x27; roots go back to World War II and the Manhattan Project. Prior to the United States formally entering the war, the U.S. Army leased land near an Albuquerque, New Mexico airport known as Oxnard Field to service transient Army and U.S. Navy aircraft. In January 1941 construction began on the Albuquerque Army Air Base, leading to establishment of the &quot;Bombardier School-Army Advanced Flying School&quot; near the end of the year. Soon thereafter it was renamed Kirtland Field, after early Army military pilot Colonel Roy C. Kirtland, and in mid-1942 the Army acquired Oxnard Field. During the war years facilities were expanded further and Kirtland Field served as a major Army Air Forces training installation.

In the many months leading up to successful detonation of the first atomic bomb, the Trinity test, and delivery of the first airborne atomic weapon, Project Alberta, J. Robert Oppenheimer, Director of Los Alamos Laboratory, and his technical advisor, Hartly Rowe, began looking for a new site convenient to Los Alamos for the continuation of weapons development especially its non-nuclear aspects. They felt a separate division would be best to perform these functions. Kirtland had fulfilled Los Alamos&#x27; transportation needs for both the Trinity and Alberta projects, thus, Oxnard Field was transferred from the jurisdiction of the Army Air Corps to the U.S. Army Service Forces Chief of Engineer District, and thereafter, assigned to the Manhattan Engineer District. In July 1945, the forerunner of Sandia Laboratory, known as &quot;Z&quot; Division, was established at Oxnard Field to handle future weapons development, testing, and bomb assembly for the Manhattan Engineer District. The District-directive calling for establishing a secure area and construction of &quot;Z&quot; Division facilities referred to this as &quot;Sandia Base&quot; , after the nearby Sandia Mountains — apparently the first official recognition of the &quot;Sandia&quot; name.
Sandia Laboratory was operated by the University of California until 1949, when President Harry S. Truman asked Western Electric, a subsidiary of American Telephone and Telegraph (AT&amp;T), to assume the operation as an &quot;opportunity to render an exceptional service in the national interest.&quot; Sandia Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Western Electric, was formed on October 5, 1949, and, on November 1, 1949, took over management of the Laboratory. The United States Congress designated Sandia Laboratories as a National laboratory in 1979. In October 1993, Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) was managed and operated by Sandia Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin. In December 2016, it was announced that National Technology and Engineering Solutions of Sandia, under the direction of Honeywell International, would take over the management of Sandia National Laboratories beginning May 1, 2017; this contract remains in effect as of November 2022, covering government-owned facilities in Albuquerque, New Mexico (SNL/NM); Livermore, California (SNL/CA); Tonopah, Nevada; Shoreview, Minnesota; and Kauai, Hawaii. SNL/NM is the headquarters and the largest laboratory, employing more than 12,000 employees, while SNL/CA is a smaller laboratory, with around 1,700 employees. Tonopah and Kauai are occupied on a &quot;campaign&quot; basis, as test schedules dictate. The lab also managed the DOE/SNL Scaled Wind Farm Technology (SWiFT) Facility in Lubbock, Texas.

Sandia led a project that studied how to decontaminate a subway system in the event of a biological weapons attack (such as anthrax). As of September 2017, the process to decontaminate subways in such an event is &quot;virtually ready to implement,&quot; said a lead Sandia engineer.

Sandia&#x27;s integration with its local community includes a program through the Department of Energy&#x27;s Tribal Energy program to deliver alternative renewable power to remote Navajo communities, spearheaded by senior engineer Sandra Begay.

== Legal issues ==
On February 13, 2007, a New Mexico State Court found Sandia Corporation liable for $4.7 million in damages for the firing of a former network security analyst, Shawn Carpenter, who had reported to his supervisors that hundreds of military installations and defense contractors&#x27; networks were compromised and sensitive information was being stolen including hundreds of sensitive Lockheed documents on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter project. When his supervisors told him to drop the investigation and do nothing with the information, he went to intelligence officials in the United States Army and later the Federal Bureau of Investigation to address the national security breaches. When Sandia managers discovered his actions months later, they revoked his security clearance and fired him.

In 2014, an investigation determined Sandia Corp. used lab operations funds to pay for lobbying related to the renewal of its $2 billion contract to operate the lab. Sandia Corp. and its parent company, Lockheed Martin, agreed to pay a $4.8 million fine.

== Technical areas ==

SNL/NM consists of five technical areas (TA) and several additional test areas. Each TA has its own distinctive operations; however, the operations of some groups at Sandia may span more than one TA, with one part of a team working on a problem from one angle, and another subset of the same team located in a different building or area working with other specialized equipment. A description of each area is given below.

TA-I operations are dedicated primarily to three activities: the design, research, and development of weapon systems; limited production of weapon system components; and energy programs. TA-I facilities include the main library and offices, laboratories, and shops used by administrative and technical staff.

TA-II is a facility that was established in 1948 for the assembly of chemical high explosive main charges for nuclear weapons and later for production scale assembly of nuclear weapons. Activities in TA-II include the decontamination, decommissioning, and remediation of facilities and landfills used in past research and development activities. Remediation of the Classified Waste Landfill which started in March 1998, neared completion in FY2000. A testing facility, the Explosive Component Facility, integrates many of the previous TA-II test activities as well as some testing activities previously performed in other remote test areas. The Access Delay Technology Test Facility is also located in TA-II.

TA-III is adjacent to and south of TA-V [both are approximately seven miles (11 km) south of TA-I]. TA-III facilities include extensive design-test facilities such as rocket sled tracks, centrifuges and a radiant heat facility. Other facilities in TA-III include a paper destructor, the Melting and Solidification Laboratory and the Radioactive and Mixed Waste Management Facility (RMWMF). RMWMF serves as central processing facility for packaging and storage of low-level and mixed waste. The remediation of the Chemical Waste Landfill, which started in September 1998, is an ongoing activity in TA-III.

TA-IV, located approximately south of TA-I, consists of several inertial-confinement fusion research and pulsed power research facilities, including the High Energy Radiation Megavolt Electron Source (Hermes-III), the Z Facility, the Short Pulsed High Intensity Nanosecond X-Radiator (SPHINX) Facility, and the Saturn Accelerator. TA-IV also hosts some computer science and cognition research.

TA-V contains two research reactor facilities, an intense gamma irradiation facility (using cobalt-60 and caesium-137 sources), and the Hot Cell Facility.

SNL/NM also has test areas outside of the five technical areas listed above. These test areas, collectively known as Coyote Test Field, are located southeast of TA-III and/or in the canyons on the west side of the Manzanita Mountains. Facilities in the Coyote Canyon Test Field include the Solar Tower Facility (34.9623 N, 106.5097 W), the Lurance Canyon Burn Site and the Aerial Cable Facility.

=== DOE/SNL Scaled Wind Farm Technology (SWIFT) Facility ===
In collaboration with the Wind Energy Technologies Office (WETO) of U.S. Department of Energy, Texas Tech University, and the Vestas wind turbine corporation, SNL operates the Scaled Wind Farm Technology (SWiFT) Facility in Lubbock, Texas.

== Open-source software ==
In the 1970s, the Sandia, Los Alamos, Air Force Weapons Laboratory Technical Exchange Committee initiated the development of the SLATEC library of mathematical and statistical routines, written in FORTRAN 77.

Today, Sandia National Laboratories is home to several open-source software projects:

* FCLib (Feature Characterization Library) is a library for the identification and manipulation of coherent regions or structures from spatio-temporal data. FCLib focuses on providing data structures that are &quot;feature-aware&quot; and support feature-based analysis. It is written in C and developed under a &quot;BSD-like&quot; license.
* LAMMPS (Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator) is a molecular dynamics library that can be used to model parallel atomic/subatomic processes at large scale. It is produced under the GNU General Public License (GPL) and distributed on the Sandia National Laboratories website as well as SourceForge.
* LibVMI is a library for simplifying the reading and writing of memory in running virtual machines, a technique known as virtual machine introspection. It is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License.
* MapReduce-MPI Library is an implementation of MapReduce for distributed-memory parallel machines, utilizing the Message Passing Interface (MPI) for communication. It is developed under a modified Berkeley Software Distribution license.
* MultiThreaded Graph Library (MTGL) is a collection of graph-based algorithms designed to take advantage of parallel, shared-memory architectures such as the Cray XMT, Symmetric Multiprocessor (SMP) machines, and multi-core workstations. It is developed under a BSD License.
* ParaView is a cross-platform application for performing data analysis and visualization. It is a collaborative effort, developed by Sandia National Laboratories, Los Alamos National Laboratories, and the United States Army Research Laboratory, and funded by the Advanced Simulation and Computing Program. It is developed under a BSD license.
* Pyomo is a python-based optimization Mathematical Programming Language which supports most commercial and open-source solver engines.
* Soccoro, a collaborative effort with Wake Forest and Vanderbilt Universities, is object-oriented software for performing electronic-structure calculations based on density-functional theory. It utilizes libraries such as MPI, BLAS, and LAPACK and is developed under the GNU General Public License.
* Titan Informatics Toolkit is a collection of cross-platform libraries for ingesting, analyzing, and displaying scientific and informatics data. It is a collaborative effort with Kitware, Inc., and uses various open-source components such as the Boost Graph Library. It is developed under a New BSD license.
* Trilinos is an object-oriented library for building scalable scientific and engineering applications, with a focus on linear algebra techniques. Most Trilinos packages are licensed under a Modified BSD License.
* Xyce is an open source, SPICE-compatible, high-performance analog circuit simulator, capable of solving extremely large circuit problems.
* Charon is a TCAD simulator which was open-sourced by Sandia in 2020. It is significant as previously there were no major TCAD simulators for large-scale simulations that were open source.
* Tracktable is a Sandia-developed open source platform for processing, analyzing, and visualizing the paths of moving objects (trajectories). 

In addition, Sandia National Laboratories collaborates with Kitware, Inc. in developing the Visualization Toolkit (VTK), a cross-platform graphics and visualization software suite. This collaboration has focused on enhancing the information visualization capabilities of VTK and has in turn fed back into other projects such as ParaView and Titan.

== Self-guided bullet ==
On January 30, 2012, Sandia announced that it successfully test-fired a self-guided dart that can hit targets at . The dart is long, has its center of gravity at the nose, and is made to be fired from a small-caliber smoothbore gun. It is kept straight in flight by four electromagnetically actuated fins encased in a plastic puller sabot that falls off when the dart leaves the bore. The dart cannot be fired from conventional rifled barrels because the gyroscopic stability provided by rifling grooves for regular bullets would prevent the self-guided bullet from reliably turning towards a target when in flight, so fins are responsible for stabilizing rather than spinning. A laser designator marks a target, which is tracked by the dart&#x27;s optical sensor and 8-bit CPU. The guided projectile is kept cheap because it does not need an inertial measurement unit, since its small size allows it to make the fast corrections necessary without the aid of an IMU. The natural body frequency of the bullet is about 30 hertz, so corrections can be made 30 times per second in flight. Muzzle velocity with commercial gunpowder is (Mach 2.1), but military customized gunpowder can increase its speed and range. Computer modeling shows that a standard bullet would miss a target at by , while an equivalent guided bullet would hit within . Accuracy increases as distances get longer, since the bullet&#x27;s motions settle more the longer it is in flight.

==Supercomputers==
List of supercomputers that have been operated by or resided at Sandia:

* Intel Paragon XP/S 140, 1993 to ?
* ASCI Red, 1997 to 2006
* Red Storm, 2005 to 2012

<text>In electrical engineering and control theory, a Bode plot is a graph of the frequency response of a system. It is usually a combination of a Bode magnitude plot, expressing the magnitude (usually in decibels) of the frequency response, and a Bode phase plot, expressing the phase shift.

As originally conceived by Hendrik Wade Bode in the 1930s, the plot is an asymptotic approximation of the frequency response, using straight line segments.

== Overview ==

Among his several important contributions to circuit theory and control theory, engineer Hendrik Wade Bode, while working at Bell Labs in the 1930s, devised a simple but accurate method for graphing gain and phase-shift plots. These bear his name, &quot;Bode gain plot&quot; and &quot;Bode phase plot&quot;. &quot;Bode&quot; is often pronounced as which is a Dutch pronunciation, closer to English .

Bode was faced with the problem of designing stable amplifiers with feedback for use in telephone networks. He developed the graphical design technique of the Bode plots to show the gain margin and phase margin required to maintain stability under variations in circuit characteristics caused during manufacture or during operation. The principles developed were applied to design problems of servomechanisms and other feedback control systems. The Bode plot is an example of analysis in the frequency domain.

== Definition ==
The Bode plot for a linear, time-invariant system with transfer function formula_1 (formula_2 being the complex frequency in the Laplace domain) consists of a magnitude plot and a phase plot.

The Bode magnitude plot is the graph of the function formula_3 of frequency formula_4 (with formula_5 being the imaginary unit). The formula_4-axis of the magnitude plot is logarithmic and the magnitude is given in decibels, i.e., a value for the magnitude formula_7 is plotted on the axis at formula_8.

The Bode phase plot is the graph of the phase, commonly expressed in degrees, of the argument function formula_9 as a function of formula_10. The phase is plotted on the same logarithmic formula_10-axis as the magnitude plot, but the value for the phase is plotted on a linear vertical axis.

==Frequency response ==
This section illustrates that a Bode plot is a visualization of the frequency response of a system.

Consider a linear, time-invariant system with transfer function formula_12. Assume that the system is subject to a sinusoidal input with frequency formula_10,

:formula_14

that is applied persistently, i.e. from a time formula_15 to a time formula_16. The response will be of the form

:formula_17

i.e., also a sinusoidal signal with amplitude formula_18 shifted by a phase formula_19 with respect to the input.

It can be shown that the magnitude of the response is

and that the phase shift is
In summary, subjected to an input with frequency formula_10, the system responds at the same frequency with an output that is amplified by a factor formula_21 and phase-shifted by formula_22. These quantities, thus, characterize the frequency response and are shown in the Bode plot.

==Rules for handmade Bode plot==

For many practical problems, the detailed Bode plots can be approximated with straight-line segments that are asymptotes of the precise response. The effect of each of the terms of a multiple element transfer function can be approximated by a set of straight lines on a Bode plot. This allows a graphical solution of the overall frequency response function. Before widespread availability of digital computers, graphical methods were extensively used to reduce the need for tedious calculation; a graphical solution could be used to identify feasible ranges of parameters for a new design.

The premise of a Bode plot is that one can consider the log of a function in the form
:formula_23

as a sum of the logs of its zeros and poles:
:formula_24

This idea is used explicitly in the method for drawing phase diagrams. The method for drawing amplitude plots implicitly uses this idea, but since the log of the amplitude of each pole or zero always starts at zero and only has one asymptote change (the straight lines), the method can be simplified.

===Straight-line amplitude plot===
Amplitude decibels is usually done using formula_25 to define decibels. Given a transfer function in the form

:formula_26

where formula_27 and formula_28 are constants, formula_29, formula_30, and formula_31 is the transfer function:
* At every value of &quot;s&quot; where formula_32 (a zero), increase the slope of the line by formula_33 per decade.
* At every value of &quot;s&quot; where formula_34 (a pole), decrease the slope of the line by formula_35 per decade.
* The initial value of the graph depends on the boundaries. The initial point is found by putting the initial angular frequency formula_10 into the function and finding 
* The initial slope of the function at the initial value depends on the number and order of zeros and poles that are at values below the initial value, and is found using the first two rules.

To handle irreducible 2nd-order polynomials, formula_37 can, in many cases, be approximated as formula_38.

Note that zeros and poles happen when formula_10 is &quot;equal to&quot; a certain formula_27 or formula_28. This is because the function in question is the magnitude of formula_42, and since it is a complex function, formula_43. Thus at any place where there is a zero or pole involving the term formula_44, the magnitude of that term is formula_45.

===Corrected amplitude plot===

To correct a straight-line amplitude plot:
* At every zero, put a point formula_46 above the line.
* At every pole, put a point formula_47 below the line.
* Draw a smooth curve through those points using the straight lines as asymptotes (lines which the curve approaches).

Note that this correction method does not incorporate how to handle complex values of formula_27 or formula_28. In the case of an irreducible polynomial, the best way to correct the plot is to actually calculate the magnitude of the transfer function at the pole or zero corresponding to the irreducible polynomial, and put that dot over or under the line at that pole or zero.

=== Straight-line phase plot ===

Given a transfer function in the same form as above,

:formula_26

the idea is to draw separate plots for each pole and zero, then add them up. The actual phase curve is given by
:formula_51

To draw the phase plot, for &quot;each&quot; pole and zero:
* If formula_52 is positive, start line (with zero slope) at 0°.
* If formula_52 is negative, start line (with zero slope) at −180°.
* If the sum of the number of unstable zeros and poles is odd, add 180° to that basis.
* At every formula_54 (for stable zeros formula_55), &quot;increase&quot; the slope by formula_56 degrees per decade, beginning one decade before formula_54 (e.g., formula_58).
* At every formula_59 (for stable poles formula_60), &quot;decrease&quot; the slope by formula_61 degrees per decade, beginning one decade before formula_59 (e.g., formula_63).
* &quot;Unstable&quot; (right half-plane) poles and zeros (formula_64) have opposite behavior.
* Flatten the slope again when the phase has changed by formula_65 degrees (for a zero) or formula_66 degrees (for a pole).
* After plotting one line for each pole or zero, add the lines together to obtain the final phase plot; that is, the final phase plot is the superposition of each earlier phase plot.

==Example==
To create a straight-line plot for a first-order (one-pole) low-pass filter, one considers the normalized form of the transfer function in terms of the angular frequency:
:formula_67
The Bode plot is shown in Figure 1(b) above, and construction of the straight-line approximation is discussed next.

===Magnitude plot===
The magnitude (in decibels) of the transfer function above (normalized and converted to angular-frequency form), given by the decibel gain expression formula_68:
:formula_69
Then plotted versus input frequency formula_10 on a logarithmic scale, can be approximated by &quot;two lines&quot;, forming the asymptotic (approximate) magnitude Bode plot of the transfer function:
* The first line for angular frequencies below formula_71 is a horizontal line at 0 dB, since at low frequencies the formula_72 term is small and can be neglected, making the decibel gain equation above equal to zero.
* The second line for angular frequencies above formula_71 is a line with a slope of −20 dB per decade, since at high frequencies the formula_72 term dominates, and the decibel gain expression above simplifies to formula_75, which is a straight line with a slope of −20 dB per decade.

These two lines meet at the corner frequency formula_71. From the plot, it can be seen that for frequencies well below the corner frequency, the circuit has an attenuation of 0 dB, corresponding to a unity pass-band gain, i.e. the amplitude of the filter output equals the amplitude of the input. Frequencies above the corner frequency are attenuated the higher the frequency, the higher the attenuation.

===Phase plot===
The phase Bode plot is obtained by plotting the phase angle of the transfer function given by

: formula_77

versus formula_10, where formula_10 and formula_71 are the input and cutoff angular frequencies respectively. For input frequencies much lower than corner, the ratio formula_72 is small, and therefore the phase angle is close to zero. As the ratio increases, the absolute value of the phase increases and becomes −45° when formula_82. As the ratio increases for input frequencies much greater than the corner frequency, the phase angle asymptotically approaches −90°. The frequency scale for the phase plot is logarithmic.

===Normalized plot===
The horizontal frequency axis, in both the magnitude and phase plots, can be replaced by the normalized (nondimensional) frequency ratio formula_72. In such a case the plot is said to be normalized, and units of the frequencies are no longer used, since all input frequencies are now expressed as multiples of the cutoff frequency formula_71.

==An example with zero and pole ==
Figures 2-5 further illustrate construction of Bode plots. This example with both a pole and a zero shows how to use superposition. To begin, the components are presented separately.

Figure 2 shows the Bode magnitude plot for a zero and a low-pass pole, and compares the two with the Bode straight line plots. The straight-line plots are horizontal up to the pole (zero) location and then drop (rise) at 20 dB/decade. The second Figure 3 does the same for the phase. The phase plots are horizontal up to a frequency factor of ten below the pole (zero) location and then drop (rise) at 45°/decade until the frequency is ten times higher than the pole (zero) location. The plots then are again horizontal at higher frequencies at a final, total phase change of 90°.

Figure 4 and Figure 5 show how superposition (simple addition) of a pole and zero plot is done. The Bode straight line plots again are compared with the exact plots. The zero has been moved to higher frequency than the pole to make a more interesting example. Notice in Figure 4 that the 20 dB/decade drop of the pole is arrested by the 20 dB/decade rise of the zero resulting in a horizontal magnitude plot for frequencies above the zero location. Notice in Figure 5 in the phase plot that the straight-line approximation is pretty approximate in the region where both pole and zero affect the phase. Notice also in Figure 5 that the range of frequencies where the phase changes in the straight line plot is limited to frequencies a factor of ten above and below the pole (zero) location. Where the phase of the pole and the zero both are present, the straight-line phase plot is horizontal because the 45°/decade drop of the pole is arrested by the overlapping 45°/decade rise of the zero in the limited range of frequencies where both are active contributors to the phase.

==Gain margin and phase margin==

Bode plots are used to assess the stability of negative-feedback amplifiers by finding the gain and phase margins of an amplifier. The notion of gain and phase margin is based upon the gain expression for a negative feedback amplifier given by

:formula_85

where &quot;A&quot;FB is the gain of the amplifier with feedback (the &quot;closed-loop gain&quot;), &quot;β&quot; is the &quot;feedback factor&quot;, and &quot;A&quot;OL is the gain without feedback (the &quot;open-loop gain&quot;). The gain &quot;A&quot;OL is a complex function of frequency, with both magnitude and phase. Examination of this relation shows the possibility of infinite gain (interpreted as instability) if the product β&quot;A&quot;OL = −1 (that is, the magnitude of β&quot;A&quot;OL is unity and its phase is −180°, the so-called Barkhausen stability criterion). Bode plots are used to determine just how close an amplifier comes to satisfying this condition.

Key to this determination are two frequencies. The first, labeled here as &quot;f&quot;180, is the frequency where the open-loop gain flips sign. The second, labeled here &quot;f&quot;0 dB, is the frequency where the magnitude of the product |β&quot;A&quot;OL| = 1 = 0 dB. That is, frequency &quot;f&quot;180 is determined by the condition

:formula_86

where vertical bars denote the magnitude of a complex number, and frequency &quot;f&quot;0 dB is determined by the condition

:formula_87

One measure of proximity to instability is the gain margin. The Bode phase plot locates the frequency where the phase of β&quot;A&quot;OL reaches −180°, denoted here as frequency &quot;f&quot;180. Using this frequency, the Bode magnitude plot finds the magnitude of β&quot;A&quot;OL. If |β&quot;A&quot;OL|180 ≥ 1, the amplifier is unstable, as mentioned. If |β&quot;A&quot;OL|180 &lt; 1, instability does not occur, and the separation in dB of the magnitude of |β&quot;A&quot;OL|180 from |β&quot;A&quot;OL| = 1 is called the &quot;gain margin&quot;. Because a magnitude of 1 is 0 dB, the gain margin is simply one of the equivalent forms: formula_88.

Another equivalent measure of proximity to instability is the &quot;phase margin&quot;. The Bode magnitude plot locates the frequency where the magnitude of |β&quot;A&quot;OL| reaches unity, denoted here as frequency &quot;f&quot;0 dB. Using this frequency, the Bode phase plot finds the phase of β&quot;A&quot;OL. If the phase of β&quot;A&quot;OL(&quot;f&quot;0 dB) &gt; −180°, the instability condition cannot be met at any frequency (because its magnitude is going to be &lt; 1 when &quot;f&quot; = &quot;f&quot;180), and the distance of the phase at &quot;f&quot;0 dB in degrees above −180° is called the &quot;phase margin&quot;.

If a simple &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; on the stability issue is all that is needed, the amplifier is stable if &quot;f&quot;0 dB &lt; &quot;f&quot;180. This criterion is sufficient to predict stability only for amplifiers satisfying some restrictions on their pole and zero positions (minimum phase systems). Although these restrictions usually are met, if they are not, then another method must be used, such as the Nyquist plot.
Optimal gain and phase margins may be computed using Nevanlinna–Pick interpolation theory.

===Examples using Bode plots===
Figures 6 and 7 illustrate the gain behavior and terminology. For a three-pole amplifier, Figure 6 compares the Bode plot for the gain without feedback (the &quot;open-loop&quot; gain) &quot;A&quot;OL with the gain with feedback &quot;A&quot;FB (the &quot;closed-loop&quot; gain). See negative feedback amplifier for more detail.

In this example, &quot;A&quot;OL = 100 dB at low frequencies, and 1 / β = 58 dB. At low frequencies, &quot;A&quot;FB ≈ 58 dB as well.

Because the open-loop gain &quot;A&quot;OL is plotted and not the product β &quot;A&quot;OL, the condition &quot;A&quot;OL = 1 / β decides &quot;f&quot;0 dB. The feedback gain at low frequencies and for large &quot;A&quot;OL is &quot;A&quot;FB ≈ 1 / β (look at the formula for the feedback gain at the beginning of this section for the case of large gain &quot;A&quot;OL), so an equivalent way to find &quot;f&quot;0 dB is to look where the feedback gain intersects the open-loop gain. (Frequency &quot;f&quot;0 dB is needed later to find the phase margin.)

Near this crossover of the two gains at &quot;f&quot;0 dB, the Barkhausen criteria are almost satisfied in this example, and the feedback amplifier exhibits a massive peak in gain (it would be infinity if β &quot;A&quot;OL = −1). Beyond the unity gain frequency &quot;f&quot;0 dB, the open-loop gain is sufficiently small that &quot;A&quot;FB ≈ &quot;A&quot;OL (examine the formula at the beginning of this section for the case of small &quot;A&quot;OL).

Figure 7 shows the corresponding phase comparison: the phase of the feedback amplifier is nearly zero out to the frequency &quot;f&quot;180 where the open-loop gain has a phase of −180°. In this vicinity, the phase of the feedback amplifier plunges abruptly downward to become almost the same as the phase of the open-loop amplifier. (Recall, &quot;A&quot;FB ≈ &quot;A&quot;OL for small &quot;A&quot;OL.)

Comparing the labeled points in Figure 6 and Figure 7, it is seen that the unity gain frequency &quot;f&quot;0 dB and the phase-flip frequency &quot;f&quot;180 are very nearly equal in this amplifier, &quot;f&quot;180 ≈ &quot;f&quot;0 dB ≈ 3.332 kHz, which means the gain margin and phase margin are nearly zero. The amplifier is borderline stable.

Figures 8 and 9 illustrate the gain margin and phase margin for a different amount of feedback β. The feedback factor is chosen smaller than in Figure 6 or 7, moving the condition | β &quot;A&quot;OL | = 1 to lower frequency. In this example, 1 / β = 77 dB, and at low frequencies &quot;A&quot;FB ≈ 77 dB as well.

Figure 8 shows the gain plot. From Figure 8, the intersection of 1 / β and &quot;A&quot;OL occurs at &quot;f&quot;0 dB = 1 kHz. Notice that the peak in the gain &quot;A&quot;FB near &quot;f&quot;0 dB is almost gone.

Figure 9 is the phase plot. Using the value of &quot;f&quot;0 dB = 1 kHz found above from the magnitude plot of Figure 8, the open-loop phase at &quot;f&quot;0 dB is −135°, which is a phase margin of 45° above −180°.

Using Figure 9, for a phase of −180° the value of &quot;f&quot;180 = 3.332 kHz (the same result as found earlier, of course). The open-loop gain from Figure 8 at &quot;f&quot;180 is 58 dB, and 1 / β = 77 dB, so the gain margin is 19 dB.

Stability is not the sole criterion for amplifier response, and in many applications a more stringent demand than stability is good step response. As a rule of thumb, good step response requires a phase margin of at least 45°, and often a margin of over 70° is advocated, particularly where component variation due to manufacturing tolerances is an issue. See also the discussion of phase margin in the step response article.

==Bode plotter==

The Bode plotter is an electronic instrument resembling an oscilloscope, which produces a Bode diagram, or a graph, of a circuit&#x27;s voltage gain or phase shift plotted against frequency in a feedback control system or a filter. An example of this is shown in Figure 10. It is extremely useful for analyzing and testing filters and the stability of feedback control systems, through the measurement of corner (cutoff) frequencies and gain and phase margins.

This is identical to the function performed by a vector network analyzer, but the network analyzer is typically used at much higher frequencies.

For education and research purposes, plotting Bode diagrams for given transfer functions facilitates better understanding and getting faster results (see external links).

== Related plots ==

Two related plots that display the same data in different coordinate systems are the Nyquist plot and the Nichols plot. These are parametric plots, with frequency as the input and magnitude and phase of the frequency response as the output. The Nyquist plot displays these in polar coordinates, with magnitude mapping to radius and phase to argument (angle). The Nichols plot displays these in rectangular coordinates, on the log scale.

<text>If was an American science fiction magazine launched in March 1952 by Quinn Publications, owned by James L. Quinn.

The magazine was moderately successful, though for most of its run it was not considered to be in the first tier of American science fiction magazines. It achieved its greatest success under editor Frederik Pohl, winning the Hugo Award for best professional magazine three years running from 1966 to 1968. &quot;If&quot; published many award-winning stories over its 22 years, including Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s novel &quot;The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress&quot; and Harlan Ellison&#x27;s short story &quot;I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream&quot;. The most prominent writer to make his first sale to &quot;If&quot; was Larry Niven, whose story &quot;The Coldest Place&quot; appeared in the December 1964 issue.

&quot;If&quot; was merged into &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot; after the December 1974 issue, its 175th issue overall.

==Publication history==
Although science fiction had been published in the United States before the 1920s, it did not begin to coalesce into a separately marketed genre until the appearance in 1926 of &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;, a pulp magazine published by Hugo Gernsback. By the end of the 1930s, the field was undergoing its first boom, but World War II and its attendant paper shortages led to the demise of several titles. By the late 1940s, the market began to recover. From a low of eight active magazines in 1946, the field expanded to 20 in 1950, and a further 22 had commenced publication by 1954. &quot;If&quot; was launched in the middle of this second publishing boom.

===Origins and 1950s===
&quot;If&quot;&#x27;s origins can be traced to 1948 and 1949, when Raymond Palmer founded two magazines while working at Ziff-Davis in Chicago: &quot;Fate&quot; and &quot;Other Worlds&quot;. &quot;Fate&quot; published articles about occult and supernatural events, while &quot;Other Worlds&quot; was a science fiction magazine. The two were sufficiently successful to attract the notice of James L. Quinn, a New York publisher. When Ziff-Davis moved to New York City in late 1950, Paul W. Fairman, a prolific writer, went with them, and was soon in touch with Quinn, who decided to found a pair of magazines modelled after Palmer&#x27;s. One was a nonfiction magazine entitled &quot;Strange&quot;; the other was &quot;If&quot;.
The first issue of &quot;If&quot; was dated March 1952, with Fairman as editor; it featured stories by Richard Shaver, Raymond Palmer, and Howard Browne, all writers who were regulars of the Ziff-Davis magazines. By the time the third issue reached the news stands, the disappointing sales figures for the first issue were in, and Quinn decided to let Fairman go. Quinn persevered with himself as editor. His first issue was dated July 1952, and he continued as editor on the masthead for some years. Quinn brought in Ed Valigursky as the art editor; he designed striking covers, including some wraparound artwork—an unusual feature—which helped improve circulation. Quinn began searching for a replacement editor: writer Lester del Rey turned down the job (a decision he is reported to have later regretted), but Quinn was able to engage Larry T. Shaw, an active science fiction fan who had sold a few stories. Shaw joined in May 1953 as associate editor and soon began writing editorials (beginning with the September 1953 issue) and assisting with story selection. The magazine&#x27;s quality quickly improved and soon Quinn felt able to switch to a monthly schedule, instead of bimonthly. Shaw left after only a year, and Quinn resumed full editorial responsibilities.

In late 1953, Quinn decided to run a competition for short fiction from new writers. The competition was only open to college students who had not sold a story before. The first prize was $1,000, the second prize $500, with five runner-up prizes of $100 each. Entries came in from writers who were later to become well known, including Harlan Ellison, Roger Zelazny, and Andrew J. Offutt, whose story &quot;And Gone Tomorrow&quot;, about a man unexpectedly sent a hundred years into the future, won first prize and appeared in the December 1954 issue of &quot;If&quot;. The only other one of the seven announced winners who had a career as a science fiction writer was Leo P. Kelley. Quinn decided to move &quot;If&quot; to a monthly schedule with the March 1954 issue, perhaps because the competition had increased readership. It reverted to a bimonthly schedule with the June 1956 issue, as circulation dropped again.

In 1957, American News Company, by far the largest magazine distributor, was liquidated. Almost all the science fiction magazines had to find a new distributor, and the smaller independent companies remaining in the market often demanded monthly publication and a larger format from the magazines they took on. Many of the magazines did not have the advertising revenue required to support these changes, and within two or three years, many of them had disappeared: the number of science fiction magazines being published dropped from a high of 46 in 1953 to less than a dozen by the end of the decade. For a while &quot;If&quot; was hard to find on the news stands, but it survived. Quinn did try the slick format (using glossy paper, unlike the cheaper paper used for pulps and digests) for a companion magazine, &quot;Space Age&quot;, which he launched in November 1958; the experiment was unsuccessful, however. In an attempt to improve &quot;If&quot;&#x27;s circulation, Quinn hired writer Damon Knight, whose first issue was October 1958. Circulation failed to increase, though this was at least partly due to the problems with distribution, and by early 1959, Quinn decided to sell the magazine. Knight&#x27;s last issue was his third, dated February 1959.

===Early 1960s===
&quot;If&quot;&#x27;s new owner was Robert Guinn, of Galaxy Publishing. The change of ownership was abrupt and led to a delay in publication, with the first issue under new editorship not appearing until July 1959. The editor was Horace Gold, who was also the editor of &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot;; &quot;Galaxy&quot; had gone from a monthly to a bimonthly schedule at the start of 1959, and &quot;If&quot; and &quot;Galaxy&quot; appeared in alternate months for the next few years. In a 1975 retrospective article, Gold commented that his policy with &quot;If&quot; was to experiment, using new writers who had not yet established themselves. In the judgement of science fiction historian Mike Ashley, the effect was that &quot;If&quot; became the weaker of the two magazines, printing stories that were of lower quality than those Gold selected for &quot;Galaxy&quot;.
Frederik Pohl took over the editorship of both &quot;If&quot; and &quot;Galaxy&quot; in 1961. Gold had had a car accident with sufficiently severe health consequences to prevent him from being able to continue as editor. Pohl, who had been intermittently helping Gold with editorial duties for some time prior to the car accident, is first listed as editor of &quot;If&quot; on the masthead of the November 1961 issue, and as editor of &quot;Galaxy&quot; for the December 1961 issue, but he had been acting as editor of both magazines since at least midyear. Pohl paid one cent per word for the stories he bought for &quot;If&quot;, whereas &quot;Galaxy&quot; paid three cents per word, and like Gold, he regarded &quot;Galaxy&quot; as the leading magazine of the two, whereas &quot;If&quot; was somewhere he could work with new writers, and try experiments and whims. This developed into a selling point when a letter from a reader, Clayton Hamlin, prompted Pohl to declare that he would publish a new writer in every single issue of the magazine, though he was also able to attract well-known writers. When Pohl began his stint as editor, both magazines were operating at a loss; despite &quot;If&quot;&#x27;s lower budget, Pohl found it more fun to edit, and commented that apparently the readers thought so, too; he was able to make &quot;If&quot; show a profit before &quot;Galaxy&quot;, adding, &quot;What was fun for me seemed to be fun for them.&quot;

In April 1963, Galaxy Publishing brought out the first issue of &quot;Worlds of Tomorrow&quot;, another science fiction magazine, also edited by Pohl. The magazine published some well-received material and was profitable, but Guinn, the publisher and owner, decided in 1967 that it would be better to have &quot;Galaxy&quot; resume a monthly schedule; both &quot;Worlds of Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;Galaxy&quot; were bimonthly at that time, while &quot;If&quot; was monthly. With the August 1967 issue &quot;Worlds of Tomorrow&quot; was merged with &quot;If&quot;, though it was another year before &quot;Galaxy&quot; actually switched to a monthly schedule. By this time, &quot;If&quot; had become monthly again, starting with the July 1964 issue (though the schedule had an initial hiccup, omitting September 1964).

The circulation rose from 64,000 in 1965 to 67,000 in 1967; the modest 5% increase was exceeded only by &quot;Analog&quot; among the other science fiction magazines, and &quot;If&quot; won the Hugo Award for best professional SF magazine three years running during this period. However, in March 1969, Robert Guinn sold all four of his magazines, including &quot;Galaxy&quot; and &quot;If&quot;, to Arnold Abramson at Universal Publishing and Distribution Corporation (UPD). Pohl was in Rio de Janeiro when he heard the news, and decided to resign his position as editor rather than continue under the new management. He had been considering a return to a writing career for some time and the change in ownership precipitated his decision to leave.

===Decline and merger with &quot;Galaxy&quot;===
The new editor was Ejler Jakobsson, though Pohl continued to be listed as editor emeritus on the masthead until the July–August 1970 issue. Much of the editorial work was actually done by Judy-Lynn Benjamin, who was hired by Pohl in 1969 as an editorial assistant. The new regime failed to impress readers, and circulation dropped from over 67,000 for the year ending October 1968 to under 45,000 the following year, a drop of over 30%. &quot;If&quot; went bimonthly in May 1970, as Abramson attempted to juggle the frequency of publication of several of his titles to maximize profits; the page count and price were also adjusted more than once over the next year, again increasing profitability. Abramson also began a British distribution of &quot;If&quot;, reprinted with a separate cover, priced in British currency. Circulation figures of the time show an increase of about 6,000 copies, but if this includes sales in the UK is not clear.

In May 1973, Judy-Lynn Benjamin (Judy-Lynn del Rey since her 1971 marriage to Lester del Rey) resigned. She was briefly replaced by Albert Dytch, but within four months, Dytch in turn left, and in August 1973, James Baen joined UPD. He was made managing editor of &quot;If&quot; with effect from the January 1974 issue, and full editor one issue later; Jakobsson was listed as editor emeritus until the August 1974 issue. Baen had little opportunity to work with &quot;If&quot;, however, as financial problems at UPD combined with the increasing cost of paper (a consequence of the rising price of oil) led to a decision to combine &quot;If&quot; with &quot;Galaxy&quot;. Despite the fact that in 1974, &quot;If&quot;&#x27;s circulation had exceeded &quot;Galaxy&quot;&#x27;s for the first time, &quot;Galaxy&quot; was retained and &quot;If&quot; was merged with it beginning with the January 1975 issue.

===Relaunches of the magazine===
In 1986, an attempt was made to revive &quot;If&quot; as a semiprofessional magazine. The only issue, dated September–October 1986, was edited by Clifford Hong. 

&quot;Worlds of IF&quot; was relaunched again in February 2024 by Starship Sloane Publishing, with Justin T. O&#x27;Conor Sloane as editor, Jean-Paul L. Garnier as deputy editor, Daniel Pomarède as science editor, and Robert Silverberg as a contributing editor. The first issue featured cover art by Bob Eggleton, with reprinted fiction by Silverberg and David Brin among other notables.

==Contents and reception==
The first issue of &quot;If&quot;, dated March 1952, went on sale on 7 January of that year. The lead story was Howard Browne&#x27;s &quot;Twelve Times Zero&quot;, a murder mystery with a science fictional resolution; other stories were from Ray Palmer, Richard Shaver, and Rog Phillips, all writers associated with the Ziff-Davis magazines. Browne was the editor of Ziff-Davis&#x27;s &quot;Amazing Science Fiction&quot;, a leading magazine of the time, and had given Fairman his start in the field in the late 1940s. Fairman was familiar with Ziff-Davis&#x27;s stable of writers, and his preference for them was a reflection of his experience, though this did not necessarily serve the magazine well—he referred to the acquisition of Browne&#x27;s story as &quot;the scoop of the century&quot; and spoke in glowing terms of him in an introductory note despite the fact that Browne was reputed to detest science fiction. In addition to the fiction and the editorial by Fairman, it had a letter column, a profile of Wilson Tucker, a selection of science news, a guest editorial by Ken Slater, a well-known British fan, and an approving review of the TV show &quot;Tales of Tomorrow&quot;.

After Quinn dismissed Fairman and engaged Larry Shaw, the magazine improved significantly, and published several well-received stories, including James Blish&#x27;s &quot;A Case of Conscience&quot; in the September 1953 issue, later to become the first part of Blish&#x27;s Hugo Award-winning novel of the same name, about a Jesuit priest on a planet of aliens who have no religion but appear free of sin. The dominant science fiction magazines of the 1950s American market were &quot;Astounding&quot;, &quot;Galaxy&quot;, and &quot;Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot;, but &quot;If&quot; was in the next rank in terms of quality: SF historian Frank M. Robinson, for example, describes &quot;If&quot; as the &quot;most major of the minors&quot;. Well-known writers who appeared in &quot;If&quot; in the 1950s include Harlan Ellison and Arthur C. Clarke: the original short story version of Clarke&#x27;s novel &quot;The Songs of Distant Earth&quot; appeared in the June 1958 issue. Isaac Asimov&#x27;s widely reprinted story &quot;The Feeling of Power&quot; appeared in February 1958.

The period under Pohl is regarded as the magazine&#x27;s heyday; the three consecutive Hugo Awards won from 1966 to 1968 broke a long period in which the award had been monopolized by &quot;Analog&quot; (the name to which &quot;Astounding&quot; changed in 1960) and &quot;Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot;. Frank Robinson commented that &quot;Pohl was the only one who was surprised when he won three Hugos in a row for editing &quot;IF&quot;. It had been fun, and the fun had showed.&quot; Niven&#x27;s &quot;Neutron Star&quot; appeared in October 1966, and Harlan Ellison&#x27;s &quot;I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream&quot; appeared in March 1967; both won Hugo Awards. Pohl also managed to secure a new Skylark novel, &quot;Skylark DuQuesne&quot;, from E.E. Smith; the series had been started in the 1920s and was still popular with readers. Pohl also bought A.E. van Vogt&#x27;s &quot;The Expendables&quot;; the story was van Vogt&#x27;s first sale in 14 years and attracted long-time readers to the magazine. Another coup was the serialization of three novels by Robert A. Heinlein, including the award-winning &quot;The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress&quot;, which ran in five parts from December 1965 to April 1966.

Pohl&#x27;s policy of publishing a story by a new writer in every issue led to a series called &quot;&quot;If&quot;-firsts&quot;; the first one, Joseph L. Green&#x27;s &quot;Once Around Arcturus&quot;, about the courtship between a man and woman of different planets, appeared in the September 1962 issue. Several of the writers featured in the &quot;If&quot;-first series, which were published from 1962 through 1965, became well-known, including Alexei Panshin; the most prominent was Larry Niven, whose first story, &quot;The Coldest Place&quot;, appeared in December 1964. Niven later remarked that the story was immediately outdated; the plot relied on the discovery that the dark side of Mercury was the coldest place in the universe, but space probes had recently discovered that Mercury did in fact rotate asynchronously. Gardner Dozois also made his first sale to &quot;If&quot;, with &quot;The Empty Man&quot;, about a man possessed by an alien, in the September 1966 issue, and Gene Wolfe&#x27;s &quot;Mountains Like Mice&quot;, about an abandoned group of colonists on Mars, appeared in the May 1966 issue. Technically this was not Wolfe&#x27;s first sale, as he had already had &quot;The Dead Man&quot; published in the October 1965 issue of &quot;Sir!&quot;, but &quot;Mountains Like Mice&quot; had been written earlier. The &quot;Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot; describes the late 1960s as &quot;If&quot;&#x27;s &quot;heyday&quot;: &quot;Galaxy&quot; was considered the senior magazine for most of the fifteen years the two magazines were stablemates.

&quot;If&quot;&#x27;s covers during the 1960s were typically action-oriented, showing monsters and aliens; and several of the stories Pohl published were directed at a younger audience. For example, Blish&#x27;s &quot;Welcome to Mars&quot;, serialized under the title &quot;The Hour Before Earthrise&quot; in July to September 1966, was about a teenage genius whose antigravity device stranded him and his girlfriend on Mars. Ashley has suggested that &quot;If&quot; was attempting to acquire readership from the many new fans of science fiction who had been introduced to the genre through television, in particular via the popular 1960s shows &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and &quot;Star Trek&quot;. &quot;If&quot; also ran a friendly letter column, with more fan-oriented discussions than the other magazines, and between 1966 and 1968 a column by Lin Carter introduced readers to various aspects of science fiction fandom. These features are also likely to have appealed to a younger audience.

==Bibliographic details==

&quot;If&quot; was a digest-sized magazine throughout its life. It began at 164 pages and with only the fifth issue, November 1952, dropped to 124 pages. The page count increased again to 134 pages with the July 1959 issue, and to 164 pages with the September 1965 issue; it stayed at this length until the September–October 1970 issue. The page count was then increased to 180 with the June 1971 issue, and reduced to 164 for the last issue, December 1974. It was priced at 35 cents to begin with, and increased to 40 cents with the March 1963 issue, to 50 cents with the December 1964 issue, to 60 cents with the August 1967 issue, and finally to 75 cents with the September–October 1970 issue. With the April 1972 issue, UPD began using card stock for the covers, rather than paper, and continued to do so until the magazine ceased publication.

&quot;If&quot; was originally subtitled &quot;Worlds of Science Fiction&quot;, but in November 1961 the cover logo was changed to &quot;Worlds of If Science Fiction&quot;. UPD formally changed the title to &quot;Worlds of If&quot; in the January/February 1972 issue and in September 1974, officially registered the title of the magazine as &quot;Worlds of If&quot; with the USPTO. 

The magazine was bimonthly until the March 1954 issue, which was followed by April 1954, inaugurating a monthly period that ran until June 1955. This was followed by August 1955, resuming a bimonthly schedule that ran until July 1964, with only one irregularity, when the February 1959 issue was followed by July 1959. After July 1964, &quot;If&quot; ran a monthly schedule until April 1970, with three omissions: there were no issues dated September 1964, June 1969, or August 1969. From May–June 1970, the issues were bimonthly and bore the names of two months. This bimonthly sequence ran through the last issue at the end of 1974. The date the magazine printed on the cover reverted to a single month with the June 1971 issue, though the contents page still used two months to identify the issue. The volume numbering began with six issues to a volume: there were three errors on the magazine contents page, with volume 8 number 1 incorrectly printed as volume 7 number 6; volume 9 number 3 printed as volume 8 number 6; and volume 10 number 1 printed as volume 10 number 6. Volume 14, which began in March 1964, ran through the end of the year, with seven numbers; the remaining volumes had 12 numbers each except for volume 19 which had 10 and volume 22 which had 8.

Several British editions of &quot;If&quot; were produced. In 1953 and 1954, Strato Publications reprinted 15 issues, numbering them from 1 to 15; another 18 were reprinted between 1959 and 1962, with the issue numbers started at 1 again. Between January and November 1967 a UK edition appeared from Gold Star Publications; these were identical to the US edition dated ten months previously. Between 1972 and 1974, 15 of the UPD editions of &quot;If&quot; were imported, renumbered and repriced for UK distribution. The numbering, inexplicably, ran from 1 to 9, and then 11, 1, 13, 3, 4 and 5.

The editorial succession at &quot;If&quot; is as follows:
* Paul W. Fairman: March–September 1952.
* James L. Quinn: November 1952 – August 1958. From May 1953 to March 1954, Larry T. Shaw was Associate Editor; he wrote editorials for at least three issues, beginning with September 1953, and generally did most of the editorial work.
* Damon Knight: October 1958 – February 1959.
* H. L. Gold: July 1959 – November 1961.
* Frederik Pohl, January 1962 – May 1969.
* Ejler Jakobsson: October 1969 – January/February 1974
* Jim Baen: March/April–December 1974.
* Clifford Hong: September/November 1986.
* Justin T. O&#x27;Conor Sloane: February 2024 –

Eight selections of stories from &quot;If&quot; have been published. Two were edited by Quinn: &quot;The First World of If&quot; (1957) and &quot;The Second World of If&quot; (1958); four by Pohl: &quot;The Best Science Fiction from If&quot; (1964), &quot;The If Reader of Science Fiction&quot; (1966), &quot;The Second If Reader of Science Fiction&quot; (1968), and &quot;Worlds of If&quot; (1986); and two by Jakobsson, both published as by &quot;The Editors of If&quot;: &quot;The Best from If&quot; (1973) and &quot;The Best from If Vol II&quot; (1974). In addition, two anthologies drew all their contents from &quot;If&quot; without mentioning the magazine: &quot;The 6 Fingers of Time and 5 Other Science Fiction Novelets&quot; (1965) and &quot;The Frozen Planet and Other Stories&quot; (1966). Both were edited by Samuel H Post, who was not credited.

<doc id="155572" wikidata="Q508412" url="?curid=155572" title="Billy Bragg">
<text>Stephen William Bragg (born 20 December 1957) is an English singer, songwriter, musician, author and political activist. His music blends elements of folk music, punk rock and protest songs, with lyrics that mostly span political or romantic themes. His activism is centred on social change and left-wing political causes.

==Early life==
Bragg was born in 1957 in Barking, Essex (later part of Greater London) to Dennis Frederick Austin Bragg, an assistant sales manager to a Barking cap maker and milliner, and his wife Marie Victoria D&#x27;Urso, who was of Italian descent through her father. Bragg&#x27;s father died of lung cancer in 1976, and his mother died in 2011.

Bragg was educated at Northbury Junior School and Park Modern Secondary School (now part of Barking Abbey Secondary School) in Barking. He failed his eleven-plus exam. He developed an interest in poetry at age twelve, when his English teacher chose him to read a poem he had written for a homework assignment on a local radio station. He focused on learning and practising the guitar with his next-door neighbour, Philip Wigg (Wiggy). Some of their influences were the Faces, Small Faces and the Rolling Stones. He was also exposed to folk and folk-rock music during his teenage years, citing Simon &amp; Garfunkel and Bob Dylan as early influences on his songwriting.

During the rise of punk rock and new wave in the late 1970s, Elvis Costello also served as an inspiration for Bragg. He was particularly influenced by the Jam, as well as the Clash, whom he had seen play live in London in May 1977 on their White Riot Tour, and again at a Rock Against Racism carnival in April 1978, which he admits was the first time he really stepped into the world of music as it is used for political activism. The experience of the gig and preceding march helped shape Bragg&#x27;s left-wing politics, a change from his having previously &quot;turned a blind eye&quot; to casual racism.

==Career==
===Early career===
In 1977, Bragg formed the punk rock/pub rock band Riff Raff with Wiggy. The band decamped to rural Oundle in Northamptonshire in 1978 to record a series of singles (the first on independent Chiswick Records), which did not receive wide exposure. After a period of gigging in Northamptonshire and London, they returned to Barking and split in 1980. Taking a series of odd jobs including working at Guy Norris&#x27; record shop in Barking high street, Bragg became disillusioned with his stalled music career and in May 1981 joined the British Army as a recruit destined for the Queen&#x27;s Royal Irish Hussars of the Royal Armoured Corps. After completing three months&#x27; basic training, he bought himself out for £175 and returned home.

Bragg peroxided his hair to mark a new phase in his life and began performing frequent concerts and busking around London, playing solo with an electric guitar under the name &quot;Spy vs Spy&quot; (after the strip in &quot;Mad&quot; magazine).
His demo tape initially got no response from the record industry, but by pretending to be a television repair man, he got into the office of Charisma Records&#x27; A&amp;R man Peter Jenner. Jenner liked the tape, but the company was near bankruptcy and had no budget to sign new artists. Bragg got an offer to record more demos for music publisher Chappell &amp; Co., so Jenner agreed to release them as a record. &quot;Life&#x27;s a Riot with Spy vs Spy&quot; (credited to Billy Bragg) was released in July 1983 by Charisma&#x27;s new imprint, Utility. Hearing DJ John Peel mention on-air that he was hungry, Bragg rushed to the BBC with a mushroom biryani, so Peel played &quot;The Milkman of Human Kindness&quot; from &quot;Life&#x27;s a Riot with Spy vs Spy&quot; albeit at the wrong speed (since the 12&quot; LP was, unconventionally, cut to play at 45rpm). Peel insisted he would have played the song even without the biryani and later played it at the correct speed.

Within months Charisma had been taken over by Virgin Records and Jenner, who had been made redundant, became Bragg&#x27;s manager. Stiff Records&#x27; press officer Andy Macdonald – who was setting up his own record label, Go! Discs – received a copy of &quot;Life&#x27;s a Riot with Spy vs Spy&quot;. He made Virgin an offer and the album was re-released on Go! Discs in November 1983, at the fixed low price of £2.99. Around this time, Andy Kershaw, an early supporter at Radio Aire in Leeds, was employed by Jenner as Bragg&#x27;s tour manager. (He later became a BBC DJ and TV presenter, and he and Bragg appeared in an episode of the BBC TV programme &quot;Great Journeys&quot; in 1989, in which they travelled the Silver Road from Potosí, Bolivia, to the Pacific coast at Arica, Chile.)

Though never released as a Bragg single, album track and live favourite &quot;A New England&quot;, with an additional verse, became a Top 10 hit in the UK for Kirsty MacColl in January 1985. Since MacColl&#x27;s early death, Bragg always sings the extra verse live in her honour.

In 1984, Bragg toured the UK supporting the Style Council. Later the same year he released &quot;Brewing Up with Billy Bragg&quot;, a mixture of political songs (e.g. &quot;It Says Here&quot;) and songs of unrequited love (e.g. &quot;The Saturday Boy&quot;). This was followed in 1985 by &quot;Between the Wars&quot;, an EP of political songs that included a cover version of Leon Rosselson&#x27;s &quot;The World Turned Upside Down&quot;. The EP made the Top 20 of the UK Singles Chart and earned Bragg an appearance on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, singing the title track. Bragg later collaborated with Rosselson on the song &quot;Ballad of a Spycatcher&quot;.

In the same year, he embarked on his first tour of North America, with Wiggy as tour manager, supporting Echo &amp; the Bunnymen. The tour began in Washington, D.C., and ended in Los Angeles. On the same trip, in New York, Bragg unveiled his &quot;Portastack&quot;, a self-contained, mobile PA system weighing 35 lbs (designed for £500 by engineer Kenny Jones), the wearing of which became an archetypal image of the singer at that time. With it, he was able to busk outside the New Music Seminar, a record industry conference.

===Late 1980s and early 1990s===
In 1986 Bragg released &quot;Talking with the Taxman About Poetry&quot;, which became his first Top 10 album. Its title is taken from a poem by Vladimir Mayakovsky and a translated version of the poem was printed on the record&#x27;s inner sleeve. &quot;Back to Basics&quot; is a 1987 collection of his first three releases: &quot;Life&#x27;s a Riot with Spy vs Spy&quot;, &quot;Brewing Up with Billy Bragg&quot;, and &quot;Between the Wars&quot;. He enjoyed his only Number 1 hit single in May 1988, a cover of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;She&#x27;s Leaving Home&quot;, a shared A-side with Wet Wet Wet&#x27;s &quot;With a Little Help from My Friends&quot;. Both were taken from a multi-artist re-recording of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; titled &quot;Sgt. Pepper Knew My Father&quot; coordinated by the &quot;NME&quot; in aid of the charity Childline. Wet Wet Wet&#x27;s cover dominated radio airplay and its video was shown over four consecutive weeks on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;; on the single&#x27;s first week at number one, Bragg also went on the programme to play his cover, with regular accompanist Cara Tivey on piano.

Bragg released his fourth album, &quot;Workers Playtime&quot;, in September 1988. With this album, Bragg added a full backing band and accompaniment, including Tivey on piano, Danny Thompson on double bass and veteran Micky Waller on drums. Wiggy earned a co-production credit with Joe Boyd.

In August 1989 Bragg took lead vocal on Norman Cook&#x27;s UK top 40 hit &quot;Won&#x27;t Talk About It&quot;, which sampled Bragg&#x27;s song &quot;Levi Stubbs&#x27; Tears&quot; and was a double-A-side with &quot;Blame It On the Bassline&quot;. The track was a bigger hit a year later with Lindy Layton replacing Bragg as lead vocal.

In May 1990 Bragg released the political mini-LP &quot;The Internationale&quot; on his and Jenner&#x27;s own short-lived label Utility, which operated independently of Go! Discs, to which Bragg was still contracted. The songs were, in part, a return to his solo guitar style, but some featured more complicated arrangements and included a brass band. The album paid tribute to one of Bragg&#x27;s influences with the song, &quot;I Dreamed I Saw Phil Ochs Last Night&quot;, which is an adapted version of Earl Robinson&#x27;s song, &quot;I Dreamed I Saw Joe Hill Last Night&quot;, itself an adaptation of a poem by Alfred Hayes. Though the album only reached Number 34 in the UK Albums Chart, Bragg described it as &quot;a reassertion of my rights as an individual... and a childish two fingers [to Go! Discs boss Andy Macdonald, who&#x27;d recently signed a distribution deal with entertainment industry giant PolyGram]&quot;.
His sixth studio album &quot;Don&#x27;t Try This at Home&quot; was recorded in the shadow of the build-up to the Gulf War and subsequent ground war, inspiring the track &quot;Rumours of War&quot;. Although there is social comment (&quot;The Few&quot;, &quot;North Sea Bubble&quot;), it was intended as a more commercial pop album, released in September 1991. (Bragg called it &quot;a very long-range attempt to convert the ball between the posts&quot;.). The first single was the upbeat &quot;Sexuality&quot;, which, despite an accessible video and a dance remix on the B-side, only reached Number 27 on the UK Singles Chart. Following overtures by rival label Chrysalis, Bragg and Jenner had been persuaded by Go! Discs&#x27; Andy and Juliet Macdonald to sign a four-album deal for a million pound advance; in return he would promote the album with singles and videos. A more commercial sound and aggressive marketing had no appreciable effect on album sales, and after a grueling, 13-month world tour with a full band (the Red Stars, led by Wiggy), and a period of forced convalescence after appendicitis, Bragg left Go! Discs in summer 1992, paying back the remainder of his advance in return for all rights to his back catalogue.

===Late 1990s and 2000s===
Bragg released the album &quot;William Bloke&quot; in 1996 after taking time off to help new partner Juliet Wills raise their son Jack. (There is a reference to him in the track &quot;Brickbat&quot;: &quot;Now you&#x27;ll find me with the baby, in the bathroom&quot;.) After the ambitious instrumentation of &quot;Don&#x27;t Try This at Home&quot;, it was a simpler record, musically, more personal and even spiritual, lyrically (its title a pun on the name of 18th-century English poet William Blake, who is referenced in the song &quot;Upfield&quot;).

Around that time, Nora Guthrie (daughter of American folk artist Woody Guthrie) asked Bragg to set some of her father&#x27;s unrecorded lyrics to music. The result was a collaboration with the band Wilco and Natalie Merchant (with whom Bragg had worked previously). They released the album &quot;Mermaid Avenue&quot; in 1998, and &quot;Mermaid Avenue Vol. II&quot; in 2000. The first album was nominated for a Grammy Award in the Best Contemporary Folk Album category. A third batch, &quot;Mermaid Avenue Vol III&quot;, and &quot;The Complete Sessions&quot; followed in 2012 to mark Woody Guthrie&#x27;s centennial. A rift with Wilco over mixing and sequencing the first album led to Bragg recruiting his own band, The Blokes, to promote the album live. The Blokes included keyboardist Ian McLagan, who had been a member of Bragg&#x27;s boyhood heroes the Faces. The documentary film &quot;Man in the Sand&quot; depicted the roles of Nora Guthrie, Bragg, and Wilco in the creation of the &quot;Mermaid Avenue&quot; albums.

A developing interest in English national identity, driven by the rise of the BNP and his own move from London to rural Dorset in 1999, informed his 2002 album &quot;England, Half-English&quot; (whose single, &quot;Take Down The Union Jack&quot; put him back on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; in the Queen&#x27;s Golden Jubilee year) and his 2006 book &quot;The Progressive Patriot&quot;. The book expressed his view that English socialists can reclaim patriotism from the right wing. He draws on Victorian poet Rudyard Kipling for an inclusive sense of Englishness. In 2007 Bragg moved closer to his English folk music roots by joining the WOMAD-inspired collective The Imagined Village, who recorded an album of updated versions of traditional English songs and dances and toured through that autumn.

In December, Bragg previewed tracks from his forthcoming album &quot;Mr. Love &amp; Justice&quot; at a one-off evening of music and conversation to mark his 50th birthday at London&#x27;s South Bank. The album was released in March 2008, the second Bragg album to be named after a book by Colin MacInnes after &quot;England, Half-English&quot;. The same year, during the NME Awards ceremony, Bragg sang a duet with British solo act Kate Nash. They mixed up two of their greatest hits, Nash playing &quot;Foundations&quot;, and Bragg redoing &quot;A New England&quot;. Also in 2008, Bragg played a small role in Stuart Bamforth&#x27;s film &quot;A13: Road Movie&quot;.

In 2009, Bragg was invited by London&#x27;s South Bank to write new lyrics for &quot;Ode to Joy&quot;, the final movement of Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony (original libretto by Friedrich Schiller), since adopted as an international anthem of unity. The London Philharmonic Orchestra performed it at the Royal Festival Hall in front of Queen Elizabeth II, whom Bragg met afterwards to earn &quot;brownie points&quot; with his mother, who was also in attendance.

===2010s–present===
Bragg was involved in the play &quot;Pressure Drop&quot; at the Wellcome Collection in London in April and May 2010. The production, written by Mick Gorden, and billed as &quot;part play, part gig, part installation&quot;, featured new songs by Bragg. He performed during the play with his band, and acted as compere.

Bragg was invited by Michael Eavis to curate the Leftfield stage at Glastonbury Festival in 2010, which he has continued to do in subsequent years. He also took part in the Bush Theatre&#x27;s 2011 project &quot;Sixty-Six Books&quot;, where he wrote a piece based upon a book of the King James Bible. Bragg performed a set of the Guthrie songs that he had set to music for &quot;Mermaid Avenue&quot; during the Hay Literary Festival in June 2012, he also performed the same set on the Friday night of the 2012 Cambridge Folk Festival.

On 18 March 2013, five years after &quot;Mr. Love &amp; Justice&quot;, Bragg released the studio album &quot;Tooth &amp; Nail&quot;. Recorded in five days at the home studio of musician/producer Joe Henry in South Pasadena it featured 11 original songs, including one written for the Bush Theatre and a Woody Guthrie cover. Stylistically, it continued to explore genres of Americana and alternative country, a natural progression since &quot;Mermaid Avenue&quot;. The album was a commercial success, becoming his best charting record since 1991&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Try This at Home&quot;.
In February 2014, Bragg started a series of &quot;radio shows&quot; on Spotify, in which he talked listeners through self-curated playlists of &quot;his favourite tracks and artists, and uncovering some little-known musical gems&quot;. On 14 April 2014, Bragg put out &quot;Live at the Union Chapel&quot;, a souvenir album and DVD of a show he played on 5 June 2013 at the Union Chapel in London, featuring songs from &quot;Tooth &amp; Nail&quot; as well as favourites from his back catalogue.

In February 2016, Bragg was given the Trailblazer Award at the inaugural Americana Music Association UK Awards in London. Following that, in September he was given the Spirit of Americana Free Speech Award at the Americana Music Association US Awards in Nashville.

In August 2016, Bragg released his eleventh album, a collaboration with Joe Henry, &quot;Shine a Light: Field Recordings from the Great American Railroad&quot;, recorded at various points on a journey between Chicago and Los Angeles by train in March. It reached number 28 in the UK Albums Chart and number one in the UK Americana album chart. The pair started a dual &quot;Shine a Light&quot; tour at the Americana Music Festival in Nashville in September 2016, and taking them across the States and Canada, the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. In April 2017, they played in Australia.

Faber published Bragg&#x27;s second nonfiction book (after 2006&#x27;s &quot;The Progressive Patriot&quot;), &quot;Roots, Radicals and Rockers&quot; in June 2016, a history of the British skiffle movement, tracing the form from its 1950s boom back to ragtime, blues, jazz and American folk music. On BBC Music Day 2017, he helped unveil a blue plaque marking the studio (Trident) where the late David Bowie recorded two classic albums and the single &quot;Space Oddity&quot;, in Soho; he joined album sleeve designer George Underwood and BBC Radio London&#x27;s Robert Elms. In November, he released all six tracks from the mini-album &quot;Bridges Not Walls&quot; as downloads through the Billy Bragg website, followed by the single, &quot;Full English Brexit&quot; through Cooking Vinyl.

In April 2018, Bragg was invited to deliver a Bank of England Flagship Seminar; his presentation was titled &quot;Accountability: the Antidote to Authoritarianism&quot;. The speech was made available on the Bank of England&#x27;s website. At the Ivor Novello Awards (&quot;the Ivors&quot;) in May, he accepted the PRS Outstanding Contribution to British Music award. Also in May, his official biography &quot;Still Suitable for Miners&quot; was published in a new, 20th anniversary updated edition.

Bragg ended 2018 touring New Zealand and Australia. During his shows in Auckland, Bragg road-tested a new live format for 2019 that he had first tried out in Toronto, which became the &quot;One Step Forward, Two Steps Back&quot; tour. On the tour, Bragg would play three consecutive shows over three nights at each venue: the first night a current, mixed Bragg set; the second from his first three albums; the third from his second three albums. &quot;It&#x27;s a way of keeping things interesting&quot;, he said of the format. The tour covered the United States and the UK and Ireland throughout 2019. It was intended to continue onto Australia and New Zealand in 2020, but was rescheduled and delayed multiple times due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The shows ultimately took place in February and March 2023.

In May 2019, Faber and Faber published &quot;The Three Dimensions of Freedom&quot;, a short polemic by Bragg intended, according to the publisher&#x27;s blurb, to &quot;protect ourselves from encroaching tyranny&quot;. The author urges readers to &quot;look beyond [the] one-dimensional notion of what it means to be free&quot; and &quot;by reconnecting liberty to equality and accountability, restore... the three dimensions of freedom&quot;.

While unable to tour over the pandemic years, Bragg began working on new material. This resulted in his thirteenth studio album, &quot;The Million Things That Never Happened&quot;, which was released in October 2021. Four singles were released from the album: &quot;I Will Be Your Shield&quot;, &quot;Ten Mysterious Photos That Can&#x27;t Be Explained&quot;, &quot;Pass It On&quot; and &quot;Mid-Century Modern&quot;.

In February 2023, Bragg announced a compilation series entitled &quot;The Roaring Forty (1983–2023)&quot; to commemorate 40 years of performing music. These included a single LP compilation of 13 tracks, a triple-LP/double-CD of 40 tracks and a 14-disc CD box set of some 300 songs. He later announced the &quot;Roaring Forty&quot; tour, which took place across the UK, Ireland and mainland Europe from September to December 2023.

In August 2023, Bragg shared a new single entitled &quot;Rich Men Earning North of a Million&quot;. The solo track was quickly written and recorded as an answer song to American country musician Oliver Anthony&#x27;s song &quot;Rich Men North of Richmond&quot;.

==Politics and activism==

For all of Bragg&#x27;s 30-year-plus recording career, he has been involved with grassroots, broadly leftist, political movements, and this is often reflected in his lyrics. He has also recorded and performed cover versions of socialist anthems such as &quot;The Internationale&quot; and &quot;The Red Flag&quot;. Bragg said in an interview: &quot;I don&#x27;t mind being labelled a political songwriter. The thing that troubles me is being dismissed as a political songwriter&quot;. Bragg has cited the Clash as a strong influence on his politically themed material and activism:It wasn&#x27;t so much their lyrics as what they stood for and the actions they took. That became really important to me. Phil Collins might write a song about the homeless, but if he doesn&#x27;t have the action to go with it he&#x27;s just exploiting that for a subject. I got that from the Clash, and I try to remain true to that tradition as best I can.

===From 1983 to 1997===
Bragg&#x27;s politics were focused by the Conservative Party&#x27;s 144-seat majority landslide at the 1983 general election. He told his biographer, &quot;By 1983, the scales had fallen from my eyes&quot;. His record label boss Andy Macdonald observed that &quot;his presence onstage took on more of the avenging angel&quot;. Bragg was at the forefront of music&#x27;s influence on the 1984 miners&#x27; strike, and played many benefit gigs in towns close to coalfields such as Newport and Sunderland. He also released an EP during this year titled &quot;Between the Wars&quot;, which connected struggles of class solidarity to the present issue. This single was his most successful up until this point, reaching number 15 on the UK Singles Chart. The following year, after playing a short Labour Party-sponsored Jobs For Youth tour, he joined other like-minded activists in the public eye to form the musicians&#x27; alliance Red Wedge, which promoted Labour&#x27;s cause – and in turn lobbied the party on youth issues – in the run-up to the 1987 general election, with a national tour in 1986 alongside the Style Council, Jerry Dammers and the Communards.

Bragg travelled twice to the Soviet Union in 1986, the year Mikhail Gorbachev started to promote the policies of perestroika and glasnost. He played a gig in Leningrad, and the Festival of Song in the Struggle for Peace in Kyiv.

On 12 June 1987, the night after Labour lost that year&#x27;s general election, Bragg appeared on a notable edition of the Channel 4 discussion programme &quot;After Dark&quot;, alongside David Selbourne, Teresa Gorman and Hilary Hook among others. &quot;The Independent&quot; wrote &quot;A show called &quot;Is Britain Working?&quot; brought together victorious Tory MP Teresa Gorman; ... Helen from the Stonehenge Convoy; old colonialist Colonel Hilary Hook... and Adrian, one of the jobless. It was a perfect example of the chemistry you can get. There were unlikely alliances (Bragg and Hook)&quot;. Later Gorman &quot;stormed off the set, claiming she had been misled about the nature of the programme&quot; &quot;She told... Bragg: &#x27;You and your kind are finished. We are the future now.&#x27;&quot; Bragg said &quot;I sing in smokey rooms every night and I can keep talking for far longer than you can Teresa&quot;. Bragg explained later: &quot;She was so smug. And because she was Essex I took it personally. Then she accused me of being a fine example of Thatcherism&quot;.

===Labour in government===
In 1999, he was invited to appear before a commission that debated possible reform of the House of Lords, at which he put forward what became known as &quot;the Bragg Method&quot;: the arrangement of the Upper House to proportionally reflect the results of a general election. &quot;Trying to make it sexy is impossible,&quot; he said.

At the time of the 2001 general election, Bragg promoted tactical voting in an attempt to unseat Conservative Party candidates in his adopted home county Dorset, particularly in South Dorset and West Dorset. The Conservatives did narrowly lose South Dorset to the Labour Party.
Bragg has been an opponent of fascism, racism, bigotry, sexism and homophobia, and is a supporter of a multi-racial Britain. As a result, he has conflicted with far-right groups such as the British National Party (BNP). In a 2004 &quot;The Guardian&quot; article, Bragg was quoted as saying:The British National Party would probably make it into a parliament elected by proportional representation, too. It would shine a torch into the dirty little corner where the BNP defecate on our democracy, and that would be much more powerful than duffing them up in the street – which I&#x27;m also in favour of.

During the 2005 general election campaign in the Bethnal Green and Bow constituency, Bragg endorsed Oona King, the Labour Party&#x27;s pro-Iraq War candidate, over George Galloway, the left-wing socialist anti-war candidate from the Respect Party; due to a belief that splitting the left-wing vote would allow the Conservatives to win the seat. Galloway overturned King&#x27;s 10,000-strong majority to become the Respect Party&#x27;s only MP.

At the NME Awards in 2007, on the fifth anniversary of Joe Strummer&#x27;s death, Bragg founded Jail Guitar Doors (taking its name from a song by the Clash), an organisation aimed at supplying instruments to prisons and encouraging prisoners to address problems in a non-confrontational way. An American chapter of the organisation was launched in 2009 by MC5&#x27;s Wayne Kramer.

In January 2010, Bragg stated his intention to withhold his income tax as a protest against the Royal Bank of Scotland&#x27;s plan to pay bonuses of approximately £1,500,000,000 to staff in its investment banking business. Bragg set up a Facebook group, made appearances on radio and television news programmes, and made a speech at Speakers&#x27; Corner in London&#x27;s Hyde Park saying, &quot;Millions are already facing stark choices: are they willing to work longer hours for less money, or would they rather be unemployed? I don&#x27;t see why the bankers at RBS shouldn&#x27;t be asked the same&quot;.

===From 2010 to 2014===
In the 2010 general election, Bragg supported the Liberal Democrats because &quot;they&#x27;ve got the best manifesto&quot;.

Bragg was also very active in his hometown of Barking as part of &quot;Searchlight&quot; magazine&#x27;s Hope not Hate campaign, where the BNP&#x27;s leader Nick Griffin was standing for election. At one point during the campaign Bragg squared up to BNP London Assembly Member Richard Barnbrook, calling him a &quot;Fascist racist&quot; and saying &quot;when you&#x27;re gone from this borough, we will rebuild this community&quot;. The BNP came third on election day.

In January 2011, news sources reported that 20 to 30 residents of Bragg&#x27;s Dorset village, Burton Bradstock, had received anonymous letters viciously attacking him and his politics, and urging residents to oppose him in the village. He claimed that a BNP supporter was behind the letters, which argued that Bragg is a hypocrite for advocating socialism while living a wealthy lifestyle, and referred to him as anti-British and pro-immigration.

In July 2011 Bragg joined the growing protests over the News of the World phone hacking affair with the release of his &quot;Never Buy the Sun&quot; single, which references many of the scandal&#x27;s key points including the Milly Dowler case, police bribes and associated political fallout. It also draws on the 22-year Liverpool boycott of &quot;The Sun&quot; for their coverage of the Hillsborough disaster.

In October 2011, Bragg joined the Occupy Movement protests in the City of London. In 2013, despite his scathing criticism of Margaret Thatcher, he urged people not to celebrate the death of the former Conservative Prime Minister:The death of Margaret Thatcher is nothing more than a salient reminder of how Britain got into the mess that we are in today. Of why ordinary working people are no longer able to earn enough from one job to support a family; of why there is a shortage of decent affordable housing... of why cynicism and greed became the hallmarks of our society. Raising a glass to the death of an infirm old lady changes none of this. The only real antidote to cynicism is activism. Don&#x27;t celebrate – organise!

In 2014, Bragg joined the March in March anti-government protests in Sydney, Australia.

In June 2014, Bragg joined other musicians (including Radiohead&#x27;s Ed O&#x27;Brien) in backing a call for the EU to intervene in a dispute between YouTube and independent labels. According to a BBC News report, the video-streaming site was offering &quot;non-negotiable contracts&quot; to its planned, Spotify-like music-subscription service to labels such as XL Recordings, 4AD, Cooking Vinyl and Domino &quot;accompanied by the threat that music videos they have posted to their YouTube channels will be blocked from site altogether if they do not agree to the terms&quot;.

Bragg supports both Scottish and Welsh independence. In 2014, after David Bowie spoke in favour of Scotland remaining part of the UK, Bragg said, &quot;Bowie&#x27;s intervention encourages people in England to discuss the issues of the independence referendum, and I think English people should be discussing it, so I welcome his intervention&quot;. Bragg was a vocal supporter of Scottish independence during the campaign prior to the referendum on 18 September 2014. Bragg wrote an article for the &quot;Guardian&quot; publication on 16 September, in which he addressed the objections he had previously received from people who conflated Scottish nationalism with the far-right ethos of the BNP. He described the independence campaign as &quot;civic nationalism&quot; and his opinion piece concluded:
Support for Scottish self-determination might not fit neatly into any leftwing pigeonhole, but it does chime with an older progressive tradition that runs deep in English history – a dogged determination to hold the over-mighty to account. If, during the constitutional settlement that will follow the referendum, we in England can rediscover our Roundhead tradition, we might yet counter our historic weakness for ethnic nationalism with an outpouring of civic engagement that creates a fairer society for all.

===2015 to present===
Bragg was one of several celebrities who endorsed the parliamentary candidacy of the Green Party&#x27;s Caroline Lucas at the 2015 general election. In August 2015, Bragg endorsed Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s campaign in the Labour Party leadership election. He said: &quot;His [Corbyn&#x27;s] success so far shows you how bland our politics have become, in the aim of winning those swing voters in middle England the Labour Party has lost touch with its roots. We live in a time of austerity and what you want from that is not more austerity, you want compassion&quot;. On an edition of &quot;Question Time&quot; in October 2015, he said that Corbyn represents a political &quot;urge for change&quot; and that Ed Miliband had failed to win the 2015 general election because Miliband and the party followed &quot;the old way of doing things&quot;. In 2016, Bragg, along with numerous other celebrities, toured the UK to support Corbyn&#x27;s bid to become Prime Minister. He also voiced his support for Remain in the 2016 EU referendum.

In August 2016, &quot;The Times&quot; reported that at the Edinburgh Book Festival, Bragg had said: &quot;I worry about Jeremy that he&#x27;s a kind of twentieth century Labour man&quot;, and that &quot;we need to be reaching out to people&quot;. Described as a &quot;previously loyal supporter&quot;, who has &quot;lent his support to Mr Corbyn on numerous occasions since he became Labour leader&quot;, &quot;The Times&quot; quoted Bragg: &quot;I don&#x27;t have a simple answer. My hope is that the party does not split and that we resolve this stalemate&quot;. Corbyn at the time was campaigning in an enforced second leadership election in the summer of 2016.

After &quot;The Times&quot; article appeared, the singer tweeted that he had &quot;joined the long list of people stitched up by the Murdoch papers&quot; and accused the &quot;Times&quot; of &quot;twisting my words to attack Corbyn&quot;, urging &quot;don&#x27;t let Murdoch sow discord&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; reproduced a quote from a recording of the event absent from &quot;The Times&quot; article: &quot;It&#x27;s a challenge. Labour has fires to fight on different fronts. This would be happening even without Corbyn if any of the other candidates had won last year, these problems would still be there&quot;. In August 2016, Bragg also endorsed Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s campaign in the Labour Party leadership election.

During the general election campaign in May 2017, Bragg added his signature to a letter published in &quot;The Guardian&quot; calling for Labour to withdraw its candidates in two constituencies; Brighton Pavilion and the Isle of Wight and potentially allowing the Green Party to defeat the Tories in both, where Labour were running second. The letter was also signed by Labour MP Clive Lewis, former policy chief Jon Cruddas, former shadow children&#x27;s minister Tulip Siddiq and journalists Paul Mason and Owen Jones. The initiative was shut down by Jeremy Corbyn.

In June 2019, Bragg publicly criticised fellow singer-songwriter Morrissey for his recent political comments and endorsement of a far-right political party, and accused him of dragging the legacy of Johnny Marr and the Smiths &quot;through the dirt&quot;.

In November 2019, Bragg endorsed the Labour Party in the 2019 general election.

==Personal life==

<text>In political science, statism or etatism (from French &quot;état&quot; &#x27;state&#x27;) is the doctrine that the political authority of the state is legitimate to some degree. This may include economic and social policy, especially in regard to taxation and the means of production.

While in use since the 1850s, the term &quot;statism&quot; gained significant usage in American political discourse throughout the 1930s and 1940s. Opposition to statism is termed anti-statism or anarchism. The latter is usually characterized by a complete rejection of all hierarchical rulership.

== Overview ==
Statism can take many forms, from small government to big government. Minarchism is a political philosophy that prefers a minimal state such as a night-watchman state to protect people from aggression, theft, breach of contract and fraud with the military, police and courts. This may also include fire departments, prisons and other functions. The welfare state is another form within the spectrum of statism. Authoritarian philosophies view a strong, authoritative state as required to legislate or enforce morality and cultural practices. Totalitarianism is that which prefers a maximum, all-encompassing state.

Political theory has long questioned the nature and rights of the state. Some forms of corporatism extol the moral position that the corporate group, usually the state, is greater than the sum of its parts and that individuals have a moral obligation to serve the state. Skepticism towards statism in Western cultures is largely rooted in Enlightenment philosophy. John Locke notably influenced modern thinking in his writings published before and after the English Revolution of 1688, especially &quot;A Letter Concerning Toleration&quot; (1667), &quot;Two Treatises of Government&quot; (1689) and &quot;An Essay Concerning Human Understanding&quot; (1690). In the text of 1689, he established the basis of liberal political theory, i.e., that people&#x27;s rights existed before government; that the purpose of government is to protect personal and property rights; that people may dissolve governments that do not do so; and that representative government is the best form to protect rights.

== Economic statism ==
Economic statism promotes the view that the state has a major, necessary and legitimate role in directing the major aspects of the economy, either directly through state-owned enterprises and economic planning of production, or indirectly through economic interventionism and macro-economic regulation.

=== State capitalism ===

State capitalism is a form of capitalism that features high concentrations of state-owned commercial enterprises or state direction of an economy based on the accumulation of capital, wage labor and market allocation. In some cases, state capitalism refers to economic policies such as dirigisme, which existed in France during the second half of the 20th century and to the present-day economies of the People&#x27;s Republic of China and Singapore, where the government owns controlling shares in publicly traded companies. Some authors also define the former economies of the Eastern Bloc and Soviet Union as constituting a form of state capitalism.

=== State corporatism ===

State corporatism, corporate statism or simply &quot;corporatism&quot; is a political culture and a form of corporatism whose proposers affirm or believe that corporate groups should form the basis of society and the state. This principle requires that all citizens belong to one of the various officially designated interest groups (usually on the basis of the economic sector), the state also has great control over its citizens.

=== State interventionism ===

The term statism is sometimes used to refer to market economies with large amounts of government intervention, regulation or influence over markets. Market economies that feature high degrees of intervention are sometimes referred to as &quot;mixed economies&quot;. Economic interventionism asserts that the state has a legitimate or necessary role within the framework of a capitalist economy by intervening in markets, regulating against overreaches of private sector industry and either providing or subsidizing goods and services not adequately produced by the market.

=== State socialism ===

State socialism broadly refers to forms of socialism based on state ownership of the means of production and state-directed allocation of resources. It is often used in reference to Soviet-type economic systems of former communist states and, by extension, those of North Korea, Cuba, and the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Politically, state socialism is often used to designate any socialist political ideology or movement that advocates for the use of state power for the construction of socialism, or to the belief that the state must be appropriated and used to ensure the success of a socialist revolution. It is usually used in reference to Marxist–Leninist socialists who champion a one-party state. Critics of state socialism argue that its known manifestations in Soviet-model states are merely forms of state capitalism, claiming that the Soviet model of economics was based upon a process of state-directed capital accumulation and social hierarchy.

== Political statism ==

=== State nationalism ===
State nationalism, state-based nationalism, or state-led nationalism is a nationalism that equates &#x27;state identity&#x27; with &#x27;nation identity&#x27; or values state authority. &#x27;State nationalism&#x27; is considered a form of &#x27;civic nationalism&#x27; and there are similarities between the two, but this also has to do with illiberal, authoritarian and totalitarian politics; Italian fascism is the best example, epitomized in this slogan of Benito Mussolini: &quot;Tutto nello Stato, niente al di fuori dello Stato, nulla contro lo Stato&quot; (&quot;Everything in the State, nothing outside the State, nothing against the State&quot;). 

In the East Asian cultural sphere, including China, &quot;state nationalism&quot; and &quot;statism&quot; are both written as 國家主義, making the distinction between the two unclear. Also, in the East Asian cultural sphere, &quot;state nationalism&quot; is often contrasted with ethnic-based national liberation movements. Chinese state nationalism is a civic nationalistic ideology, but it is an ideology that reduces Hong Kong&#x27;s autonomy and justifies the dictatorship of the Chinese Communist Party. Also, Soviet nationalism in the 20th century combined civic nationalism with [state] authoritarianism. Japanese ultranationalism (ex: Shōwa statism) is often described as &quot;state ultranationalism&quot; (Japanese: 超国家主義) because it values state unity around Emperor of Japan. Italian fascism and Francoism are also classified as types state nationalism. Kemalism can also be referred to as Turkish state nationalism.

=== State feminism ===

State feminism is a feminism permitted by the state or led by the nation state. State feminism is distinguished between liberal state feminism (represented by the Nordic model) and authoritarian state feminism (that is often also linked to state-led secularism).

<text>Barings Bank was a British merchant bank based in London, and one of England&#x27;s oldest merchant banks after Berenberg Bank, Barings&#x27; close collaborator and German representative. It was founded in 1762 by Francis Baring, a British-born member of the German–British Baring family of merchants and bankers.

The bank collapsed in 1995 after suffering losses of £827 million (£ billion in ) resulting from fraudulent investments, primarily in futures contracts, conducted by its employee Nick Leeson, working at its office in Singapore.

==History==
===1762–1889===
Barings Bank was founded in 1762 as the John and Francis Baring Company by Sir Francis Baring, 1st Baronet, with his older brother John Baring as a mostly silent partner. They were sons of John (né Johann) Baring, wool trader of Exeter, born in Bremen, Germany. The company started business in offices off Cheapside in London, and within a few years moved to larger quarters in Mincing Lane. Barings gradually diversified from wool into many other commodities, providing financial services for the rapid growth of international trade, including the lucrative slave trade which enriched the family and the business considerably and allowed significant expansion of the bank&#x27;s activities and prestige.

The success of Baring&#x27;s was greatly influenced by establishment of a network of corresponding houses. One of the most valuable connections was Hope &amp; Co., the most powerful merchant bank of Amsterdam, at that time Europe&#x27;s leading financial centre. Hope &amp; Co played a major part in the finances of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) and during the Seven Years&#x27; War (1756–1763) Thomas Hope and his brother Adria profited from the Netherlands&#x27; neutral position.

In 1774, Barings started business in North America. By 1790, Barings had greatly expanded its resources, both through Francis&#x27;s efforts in London and by association with Hope &amp; Co. In 1793, the increased business necessitated a move to larger quarters in Devonshire Square. In 1796, the bank helped to finance the purchase of about 1 million acres (4000 km2) of remote land that became part of the US state of Maine.

In 1800, John retired and the company was reorganized as Francis Baring and Co.. Francis&#x27;s new partners were his eldest son Thomas (later to be Sir Thomas Baring, 2nd Baronet) and son-in-law, Charles Wall. Then, in 1802, Barings and Hope &amp; Co. were called on to facilitate the largest land purchase in history: the Louisiana Purchase, which doubled the size of the United States. It is regarded as &quot;one of the most historically significant trades of all time&quot;. This was accomplished even though Britain was at war with France and the sale helped to finance Napoleon&#x27;s war effort. Technically, the United States purchased Louisiana from Barings and Hope, not from Napoleon. Baring was willing to help Napoleon in the short term because he, and British politicians who backed him, predicted that American expansion into Louisiana would ensure Barings&#x27; profits in Britain. After a $3 million down payment in gold, the remainder of the purchase was made in United States bonds, which Napoleon sold to Barings through Hope &amp; Co. of Amsterdam at a price of $87.50 per $100 face value (a discount of one-eighth). Francis&#x27;s second son Alexander Baring, 1st Baron Ashburton, working for Hope &amp; Co., made the arrangements in Paris with François Barbé-Marbois, director of the Public Treasury. Alexander then sailed to the United States and back to pick up the bonds and deliver them to France.

In 1803, Francis began to withdraw from active management, bringing in Thomas&#x27;s younger brothers Alexander and Henry to become partners in 1804. The new partnership was called Baring Brothers &amp; Co., which it remained until 1890. The offspring of these three brothers became the future generations of Barings leadership. In 1806, the company relocated to 8 Bishopsgate, where it stayed for the remaining life of the company. The building underwent several expansions and refurbishments, and was ultimately replaced with a new high-rise building in 1981.

Barings helped to finance the United States government during the War of 1812. By 1818, Barings was called &quot;the sixth great European power&quot;, after England, France, Prussia, Austria and Russia. A fall-off in business and some poor leadership in 1820s caused Barings to cede its dominance in the City of London to the rival firm of N M Rothschild &amp; Sons. Barings remained a powerful firm, however, and in the 1830s the leadership of new American partner Joshua Bates, together with Thomas Baring (1799–1873), son of Sir Thomas Baring, 2nd Baronet, began a turnaround. Bates advocated a shift in Barings&#x27; efforts from Europe to the Americas, believing that greater opportunity lay in the West. In 1832, a Barings office was established in Liverpool specifically to capitalise on new North American opportunities. In 1843, Barings became an exclusive agent to the US government.

Barings was appointed by Sir Robert Peel to supply &quot;Indian corn&quot; (maize) to Ireland for famine relief between November 1845 and July 1846, after the staple potato crop failed. The company declined to act beyond 1846, when the government instructed it to restrict its purchases to within Britain. Baring Brothers stated it would refuse future commissions in famine relief, with the blame this could so easily entail. Its position as the prime purchaser of Indian corn was assumed by Erichson, a corn factor of Fenchurch St, London.

In 1851, Baring and Bates brought in another American, Russell Sturgis, as a partner. Despite the embarrassment to his partners caused by his sympathies for the South in the American Civil War, Sturgis proved a capable banker. Baring did not deal in U.S. bonds, but it did help fund the American purchases of armaments. After the death of Bates in 1864, Sturgis gradually assumed a leadership role. In the 1850s and 1860s, the commercial credit business provided the firm with its basic income. Thomas Baring&#x27;s nephew Edward, son of Henry Baring, became a partner in 1856. By the 1870s, under the emerging leadership of &quot;Ned&quot; Baring, later Edward Baring, 1st Baron Revelstoke, Barings were increasingly involved in international securities, especially from the United States, Canada, and Argentina. Barings cautiously and successfully ventured into the North American railroad boom following the Civil War. A new railroad town was renamed Revelstoke, British Columbia, in honour of the leading partner of the bank that enabled the completion of the Canadian-Pacific Railway. Barings also helped to finance major railways including the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway.

&quot;Ned Baring&quot; had a daughter, Margaret Baring, who was a great-grandmother of Diana, Princess of Wales.

In 1886, the bank helped broker the listing of the Guinness brewery.

===Panic of 1890===
In the late 1880s, daring efforts in underwriting got the firm into serious trouble through overexposure to Argentine and Uruguayan debt. In 1890, Argentine president Miguel Juárez Celman was forced to resign following the Revolución del Parque, and the country was close to defaulting on its debt payments. This crisis finally exposed the vulnerability of Barings, which lacked sufficient reserves to support the Argentine bonds. Through the organisational skills of the governor of the Bank of England, William Lidderdale, a consortium of banks was arranged, headed by former governor Henry Hucks Gibbs and his family firm of Antony Gibbs &amp; Sons, to bail Barings out and support a bank restructuring. The resulting turmoil in financial markets became known as the Panic of 1890.

===Reduced role: 1891–1929===
The rescue avoided what could have been a worldwide financial collapse, but Barings never regained its dominant position. A limited liability company—Baring Brothers &amp; Co., Ltd.—was formed, to which the viable business of the old partnership was transferred. The assets of the old house and several partners were taken over and liquidated to repay the rescue consortium, with guarantees provided by the Bank of England. Lord Revelstoke and others lost their partnerships along with their personal fortunes, which were pledged to support the bank. Nearly 10 years elapsed before the debts were paid. Revelstoke did not live to see this accomplished, dying in 1897.

Barings did not return to issuance on a substantial scale until 1900, concentrating on securities in the United States and Argentina. It operated under the leadership of Edward&#x27;s son John Baring, 2nd Baron Revelstoke, in the early years of the 20th century. The company&#x27;s restraint during this period cost it its pre-eminence in the world of finance, but later paid dividends when its refusal to take a chance on financing Germany&#x27;s recovery from World War I saved it some of the most painful losses incurred by other British banks at the onset of the Great Depression.

===1929–1992===
During the Second World War, the British government used Barings to liquidate assets in the United States and elsewhere to help finance the war effort. After the war, Barings was overtaken in size and influence by other banking houses, but remained an important player in the market until 1995.

The bank decided to enter the UK securities market buying Henderson Crosthwaite, a stockbroker, in May 1984 and Wilson &amp; Watford, a stock jobber, in November 1985.

===1992–1995===
Barings was brought down in 1995 by a massive trading loss caused by fraudulent trading by its head derivatives trader in Singapore since 1992, Nick Leeson. Leeson was supposed to be arbitraging, seeking to profit from differences in the prices of Nikkei 225 futures contracts listed on the Osaka Securities Exchange in Japan and on the Singapore International Monetary Exchange (SIMEX). However, instead of buying on behalf of clients on one market and immediately selling on another market for a small profit, using the strategy approved by his superiors, Leeson started undertaking such trades using the bank&#x27;s own money, gambling on the future direction of the Japanese markets.

According to Eddie George, Governor of the Bank of England, Leeson began doing this at the end of January 1992. Due to a series of internal and external events, his unhedged losses escalated rapidly.

====Internal control====
Leeson was general manager for Barings&#x27; trading on SIMEX. Barings circumvented normal accounting, internal control and audit safeguards by making Leeson head of settlement operations for SIMEX, charged with ensuring accurate accounting for the unit. These positions would normally have been held by different employees. With authority to settle his own trades, Leeson was able to operate with no supervision from London—an arrangement that made it easier for him to hide his losses. After the collapse, several observers placed much of the blame on the bank&#x27;s own deficient internal control and risk management practices. A number of people had raised concerns over Leeson&#x27;s activities but were ignored.

====Corruption====
Because of the absence of oversight, Leeson was able to make seemingly small gambles in the futures arbitrage market at Barings Futures Singapore and cover up his shortfalls by reporting losses as gains to Barings in London. Specifically, Leeson altered the branch&#x27;s error account, subsequently known by its account number 88888 as the &quot;five-eights account&quot;, to prevent the London office from receiving the standard daily reports on trading, price and status. Leeson claimed the losses started when one of his colleagues bought 20 contracts when she should have sold them, costing Barings £20,000.

By December 1994, Leeson had cost Barings £200 million. He reported to British tax authorities a £102 million profit. If the company had uncovered his true financial dealings then, collapse might have been avoided as Barings still had £350 million of capital.

====Kobe earthquake====
Using the hidden five-eights account, Leeson began to trade aggressively in futures and options on SIMEX. His decisions routinely resulted in losses of substantial sums and he used money entrusted to the bank by subsidiaries for use in their own accounts. He falsified trading records in the bank&#x27;s computer systems and used money intended for margin payments on other trading. As a result, he appeared to be making substantial profits. However, his luck ran out when the Kobe earthquake upset the Asian financial markets—and with them, Leeson&#x27;s investments. Leeson bet on a rapid recovery by the Nikkei, which failed to materialise.

====Discovery====
On 23 February 1995, Leeson left Singapore to fly to Kuala Lumpur. Barings Bank auditors discovered the fraud around the time that Barings&#x27; chairman Peter Baring received a confession note from Leeson. Leeson&#x27;s activities had generated losses totalling £827 million ($1.3 billion), twice the bank&#x27;s available trading capital. The collapse cost another £100 million. The Bank of England attempted an unsuccessful weekend bailout, and employees around the world did not receive their bonuses. Barings was declared insolvent on 26 February 1995, and administrators began managing the finances of Barings Group and its subsidiaries. The same day, the Board of Banking Supervision of the Bank of England launched an investigation led by Britain&#x27;s Chancellor of the Exchequer; its report was released on 18 July 1995. Leeson was captured in Frankfurt on 2 March and extradited to Singapore on 23 November, 272 days after fleeing. He was sentenced to six years and six months imprisonment, served in Singapore&#x27;s Changi Prison for his wrongdoings.

====Aftermath====
Dutch bank ING purchased Barings Bank in 1995 for the nominal sum of £1 and took over all of Barings&#x27; liabilities, forming the subsidiary ING Barings. In 2001, ING sold the US-based operations to ABN Amro for $275 million and folded the rest of ING Barings into its European banking division. This left only the asset management division, Baring Asset Management. In March 2005, BAM was split and sold by ING to MassMutual, which acquired BAM&#x27;s investment management activities and the rights to use the Baring Asset Management name, and Northern Trust, which acquired BAM&#x27;s Financial Services Group. Barings Bank no longer has a separate corporate existence, although the &quot;Barings&quot; name still lives on as the MassMutual subsidiary Baring Asset Management. In March 2016, a merger was announced with other asset management subsidiaries of MassMutual, creating a new &quot;Barings&quot; headquartered in Charlotte, NC. Baring Private Equity International was acquired by its respective management teams, which today include Baring Vostok Capital Partners in Russia, GP Investments in Brazil, Baring Private Equity Asia and Baring Private Equity Partners India.

==The Baring Foundation==
The Baring Foundation was established in 1969 as a charitable foundation, which survived the collapse of Barings Bank and in 2019 celebrated its 50th anniversary. By 2019 the foundation had provided £120 million in grant funding.

==In popular culture and fiction==
On 5 April 2007, &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper reported that KPMG, the liquidators of Barings, had sold a trading jacket thought to have been worn by Nick Leeson while trading on SIMEX in Singapore. The jacket was offered for sale on eBay but it failed to reach its reserve price despite a highest bid of £16,100. It was subsequently sold for £21,000. In October 2007 a similar jacket used by Leeson&#x27;s team but not thought to have been worn by Leeson himself sold at auction for £4,000.

===Fiction===
The 1999 film &quot;Rogue Trader&quot; is a fictionalized account of the bank&#x27;s downfall based upon Leeson&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Rogue Trader: How I Brought Down Barings Bank and Shook the Financial World&quot;.

In the historical novel &quot;Stone&#x27;s Fall&quot; (2009) by Iain Pears, Barings and its role in the Panic of 1890 play a significant part in the story&#x27;s structure.

In the novel &quot;Around the World in Eighty Days&quot; (1872) by Jules Verne, Phileas Fogg&#x27;s bet is guaranteed by a cheque for £20,000 drawn on Barings Bank:

As today is Wednesday, the 2nd of October, I shall be due in London in this very room of the Reform Club, on Saturday, the 21st of December, at a quarter before nine p.m.; or else the twenty thousand pounds, now deposited in my name at Barings, will belong to you, in fact and in right, gentlemen. Here is a cheque for the amount.

In the song &quot;When you&#x27;re lying awake&quot; from the operetta &quot;Iolanthe&quot; (1882) by Gilbert and Sullivan, Barings is mentioned towards the end (as Baring, together with Rothschild).

<text>Edward Groff Conklin (September 6, 1904 – July 19, 1968) was an American science fiction anthologist. He edited 40 anthologies of science fiction, one of mystery stories (co-edited with physician Noah Fabricant), wrote books on home improvement and was a freelance writer on scientific subjects as well as a published poet. From 1950 to 1955, he was the book critic for &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot;.

Born in Glen Ridge, New Jersey, Conklin was educated at Dartmouth College and Harvard University, and graduated from Columbia University in 1927. He drifted through a series of jobs in the 1930s and 1940s, working for several government agencies during WWII. He was a book editor for Robert M. McBride &amp; Co. and did public relations work for the Federal Home Loan Bank, the Office of Strategic Services, the Department of Commerce, the National Cancer Institute and the American Diabetes Association. He was also a former scientific researcher for the N.W. Ayer &amp; Son advertising agency.

==Short fiction==
It was as an editor of fiction that Conklin found his niche, beginning as early as 1930. At the age of 26, while employed as an assistant manager at New York&#x27;s Doubleday Bookstore, he arranged for the hardcover publication of a story first published in &quot;The Smart Set&quot; (November 1913), reprinting &quot;A Flood&quot; by the Irish writer George Moore in a limited edition of 185 signed copies. In 1934, Conklin and Burton Rascoe published &quot;The Smart Set Anthology&quot; (reissued in 1944 as &quot;The Bachelor&#x27;s Companion&quot;), the first collection of stories from that literary magazine.

Conklin&#x27;s interest in short fiction continued with the 1936 publication of &quot;The New Republic Anthology: 1915-1935&quot;, edited with Bruce Bliven. The following year, he married Lucy Tempkin on October 1. During the next decade, he wrote books about subways, rental libraries and home construction, in addition to poetry and numerous magazine articles.

==Science fiction==
Conklin did not grow up as a reader of science fiction, but came to it later in life. In his &quot;Galaxy Five-Star Shelf&quot; column of December, 1954, he states, &quot;...I actually did not become an earnest devotee of the form until 1944, about a year before the Atomic Age actually opened...The first item I remember reading that could be classified as science fiction was H. G. Wells&#x27; &quot;Men Like Gods&quot;, back in 1924 when I was a college sophomore. It had a tremendous effect on me...&quot; A roommate from 1930 provided him with &quot;bound volumes of tear-sheets of early weirds, fantastics and &#x27;scientifictions&#x27; from the old &quot;Argosy&quot;, &quot;All-Story&quot; and others...&quot; He sent a proposal for his first science fiction anthology to Crown Publishers in 1944, and the book was issued in 1946, several months ahead of the other great sf anthology of that year, &quot;Adventures in Time and Space&quot; edited by Raymond J. Healy and J. Francis McComas.

After his first science fiction anthology, &quot;The Best of Science Fiction&quot; (1946), weighing in at 785 pages, he followed with &quot;A Treasury of Science Fiction&quot; (1948). Readers soon began to seek out books with his strikingly unusual and exotic name on the cover—&quot;The Science Fiction Galaxy&quot; (1950), &quot;The Big Book of Science Fiction&quot; (1950) and &quot;Possible Worlds of Science Fiction&quot; (1951). The prominent display of Conklin&#x27;s huge hardcover anthologies in the &quot;New Titles&quot; section of libraries led numerous American readers to discover science fiction during the genre&#x27;s early 1950s boom. &quot;In the Grip of Terror&quot; (Permabooks, 1951) was an offbeat collection of horror tales, and he collaborated with Lucy Conklin on &quot;The Supernatural Reader&quot; in 1953, a year before her death. Four years later, he married Florence Alexander Wohlken.

His book review column, &quot;Galaxy&#x27;s Five-Star Shelf&quot;, was a key feature in &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot; from its premiere issue (October 1950) until October 1955. During that period, he also edited Grosset &amp; Dunlap&#x27;s &quot;Science Fiction Classics&quot; series, which he conceived as an inexpensive alternative to hard-to-find small-press editions of such titles as Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s &quot;Beyond This Horizon&quot; and Isaac Asimov&#x27;s &quot;I, Robot&quot;, although the first title in the series (Henry Kuttner&#x27;s &quot;Fury&quot;) was that story&#x27;s first book publication.

&quot;The Weather-Conditioned House&quot; (1958) is not science fiction but a practical discussion of methods involved in weather-conditioning a house. The book was authoritative enough that it was reissued with an update in 1982.

In the last three years of his life, Conklin was the staff science editor for &quot;The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language&quot;. He lived in New York at 150 West 96th Street. At the age of 63, he died of emphysema in his summer home at Pawling, New York.

A major survey of Conklin&#x27;s contribution to science fiction is contained in Bud Webster&#x27;s &quot;41 Above the Rest: An Index and Checklist for the Anthologies of Groff Conklin&quot;. Webster&#x27;s study prompted this comment from Barry N. Malzberg:
Groff Conklin was also a contributor of definitions to the American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language. He can be found listed under the heading of Definitions, along with others.

<text>Sir Sandford Fleming (January 7, 1827 – July 22, 1915) was a Scottish Canadian engineer and inventor. Born and raised in Scotland, he immigrated to colonial Canada at the age of 18. He promoted worldwide standard time zones, a prime meridian, and use of the 24-hour clock as key elements to communicating the accurate time, all of which influenced the creation of Coordinated Universal Time. He designed Canada&#x27;s first postage stamp, produced a great deal of work in the fields of land surveying and map making, engineered much of the Intercolonial Railway and the first several hundred kilometers of the Canadian Pacific Railway, and was a founding member of the Royal Society of Canada and founder of the Canadian Institute (a science organization in Toronto).

==Early life==

In 1827, Fleming was born in Kirkcaldy, Fife, Scotland to Andrew and Elizabeth Fleming. At the age of 14 he was apprenticed as a surveyor and in 1845, at the age of 18, he immigrated with his older brother David to colonial Canada. Their route took them through many cities of the Canadian colonies: Quebec City, Montreal, and Kingston, before settling in Peterborough, Ontario with their cousins two years later in 1847. He qualified as a surveyor in Canada in 1849.

In 1849 he created the Royal Canadian Institute with several friends, which was formally incorporated on November 4, 1851. Although initially intended as a professional institute for surveyors and engineers it became a more general scientific society. In 1851 he designed the &quot;Threepenny Beaver&quot;, the first Canadian postage stamp, for the Province of Canada (today&#x27;s southern portions of Ontario and Quebec). Throughout this time he was fully employed as a surveyor, mostly for the Grand Trunk Railway. His work for them eventually gained him the position as &quot;Chief Engineer&quot; of the Northern Railway of Canada in 1855, where he advocated the construction of iron bridges instead of wood for safety reasons.

Fleming served in the 10th Battalion Volunteer Rifles of Canada (later known as the Royal Regiment of Canada) and was appointed to the rank of captain on January 1, 1862. He retired from the militia in 1865.

==Family==

As soon as he arrived in Peterborough, Ontario in 1845, Fleming became friendly with the family of his future wife, the Halls, and was attracted to Ann Jane (Jeanie) Hall. However, it was not until a sleigh accident almost ten years later that the young people&#x27;s love for each other was revealed. A year after this incident, in January 1855, Sandford married Ann Jane (Jean) Hall, daughter of Sheriff James Hall. They were to have nine children of whom two died young. The oldest son, Frank Andrew, accompanied Fleming in his great Western expedition of 1872. A family man, deeply attached to his wife and children, he also welcomed his father Andrew Greig Fleming, Andrew&#x27;s wife and six of their other children who came to join him in Canada two years after his arrival. The Fleming and Hall families saw each other often.

After the death of his wife Jeanie in 1888, Fleming&#x27;s niece Miss Elsie Smith, daughter of Alexander and Lily Smith, of Kingussie, Scotland, presided over his household at &quot;Winterholme&quot; 213 Chapel Street, Ottawa, Ontario.

==Railway engineer==
His time at the Northern Railway was marked by conflict with the architect Frederick William Cumberland, with whom he started the Canadian Institute and who was general manager of the railway until 1855. Starting as assistant engineer in 1852, Fleming replaced Cumberland in 1855 but was in turn ousted by him in 1862. In 1863 he became the chief government surveyor of Nova Scotia charged with the construction of a line from Truro to Pictou. When he would not accept the tenders from contractors that he considered too high, he was asked to bid for the work himself and completed the line by 1867 with both savings for the government and profit for himself.
In 1862 he placed before the government a plan for a transcontinental railway connecting the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. The first part, between Halifax and Quebec became an important part of the preconditions for New Brunswick and Nova Scotia to join the Canadian Federation because of the uncertainties of travel through Maine because of the American Civil War. In 1867 he was appointed engineer-in-chief of the Intercolonial Railway which became a federal project and he continued in this post until 1876. His insistence on building the bridges of iron and stone instead of wood was controversial at the time, but was soon vindicated by their resistance to fire.

Between 1870 and 1875 Fleming supervised the building of several parts of the Intercolonial railway being built by Brown, Brooks &amp; Ryan, a Toronto firm established by railway magnate Hugh Ryan. These sections were particularly costly due to the difficult terrain and included two bridges over the Miramichi River and six miles of approaches.

By 1871, the strategy of a railway connection was being used to bring British Columbia into federation and Fleming was offered the chief engineer post on the Canadian Pacific Survey. Although he hesitated because of the amount of work he had, in 1872 he set off with a small party to survey the route, particularly through the Rocky Mountains, finding a practicable route through the Yellowhead Pass. One of his companions, George Monro Grant wrote an account of the trip, which became a best-seller. In June 1880, Fleming was dismissed by Sir Charles Tupper, with a $30,000 payoff. It was the hardest blow of Fleming&#x27;s life, though he obtained a promise of monopoly, later revoked, on his next project, a trans-pacific telegraph cable. Nevertheless, in 1884 he became a director of the Canadian Pacific Railway and was present as the last spike was driven.

==Inventor of worldwide standard time==
Fleming is credited with &quot;the initial effort that led to the adoption of the present time meridians&quot;. After missing a train while travelling in Ireland because a printed schedule listed p.m. instead of a.m., in 1876 he wrote a memoir &quot;Terrestrial Time&quot; where he proposed a single 24-hour clock for the entire world, conceptually located at the centre of the Earth and not linked to any surface meridian. He later called this time &quot;Cosmopolitan time&quot; and later still &quot;Cosmic Time&quot;. He proposed 24 time zones, each an hour wide or 15 degrees of longitude. The zones were labelled A-Y, excluding J, and arbitrarily linked to the Greenwich meridian, which was designated G. All clocks within each zone would be set to the same time as the others, and between zones the alphabetic labels could be used as common notation. So for example cosmopolitan time G:45 would map to local time 14:45 in one zone and 15:45 in the next.

In two papers &quot;Time reckoning&quot; and &quot;Longitude and Time Reckoning&quot; presented at a meeting of the Canadian Institute in Toronto on February 8, 1879, Fleming revised his system to link with the anti-meridian of Greenwich (the 180th meridian). He suggested that a prime meridian be chosen and analyzed shipping numbers to suggest Greenwich as the meridian. Fleming&#x27;s two papers were considered so important that in June 1879 the British Government forwarded copies to eighteen foreign countries and to various scientific bodies in England.

Fleming went on to advocate his system at several major international conferences including the Geographical Congress at Venice in 1881, a meeting of the Geodetic Association at Rome in 1883, and the International Meridian Conference of 1884. The International Meridian Conference accepted the Greenwich Meridian and a universal day of 24 hours beginning at Greenwich midnight. However, the conference&#x27;s resolution specified that the universal day &quot;shall not interfere with the use of local or standard time where desirable&quot;. The conference also refused to accept his zones, stating that they were a local issue outside its purview.

Fleming authored the pamphlet &quot;Time-Reckoning for the 20th Century&quot;, published by the Smithsonian Institution in its annual report for 1886.

By 1929, all major countries in the world had accepted time zones. In the present day, UTC offsets divide the world into zones, and military time zones assign letters to the 24 hourly zones, similarly to Fleming&#x27;s system.

Fleming was also interested in global calendar reform. He met Moses B. Cotsworth in 1908 when Cotsworth visited Ottawa. They discussed the International Fixed Calendar over lunch and Fleming agreed to present Cotsworth&#x27;s paper on his 13-month calendar to the Royal Society of Canada. Fleming maintained a close friendship with Cotsworth and they often corresponded by letter. Fleming became the president of the International Fixed Almanak Reform League which, in 1922, became the International Fixed Calendar League. He supported the campaign until his death. Cotsworth later wrote The Greatest Canadian as a tribute to Fleming.

==Later life==
When the railway privatization instituted by Tupper in 1880 forced him out of a job with government, he retired from the world of surveying, and took the position of Chancellor of Queen&#x27;s University in Kingston, Ontario. He held this position for his last 35 years, where his former Minister George Monro Grant was principal from 1877 until Grant&#x27;s death in 1902. Not content to leave well enough alone, he tirelessly advocated the construction of a submarine telegraph cable connecting all of the British Empire, the All Red Line, which was completed in 1902.

Being a man of ideas, in 1882 he authored a book on the land policy of the HBC.

He also kept up with business ventures, becoming in 1882 one of the founding owners of the Nova Scotia Cotton Manufacturing Company in Halifax. He was a member of the North British Society. He also helped found the Western Canada Cement and Coal Company, which spawned the company town of Exshaw, Alberta. In 1910, this business was captured in a hostile take-over by stock manipulators acting under the name Canada Cement Company, an action which Fleming took as a personal blow.

In 1880 he served as the vice president of the Ottawa Horticultural Society. In 1888, he became the first president of the Rideau Curling Club, after leaving the Ottawa Curling Club in protest of its temperance policy.

In early 1890s he turned his attention to electoral reform and the need for proportional representation. He authored two books on the subject &quot;An Appeal to the Canadian Institute on the Rectification of Parliament&quot; (1892) and &quot;Essays on the Rectification of Parliament&quot; (1893), which included an essay by Australian reformer Catherine Helen Spence.

He became a strong advocate of a telecommunications cable from Canada to Australia, which he believed would become a vital communications link of the British Empire. The Pacific Cable was successfully laid in 1902. He authored the book &quot;Canada and British Imperial Cables&quot; in 1900.

His accomplishments were well known worldwide, and in 1897 he was knighted by Queen Victoria. He was a freemason, having joined St Andrew&#x27;s Lodge No 1 [Now No 16] in York [now Toronto].

In 1883, while surveying the route of the Canadian Pacific Railway with George Monro Grant, he met Major A. B. Rogers near the summit of Rogers Pass (British Columbia) and co-founded the first &quot;Alpine Club of Canada&quot;. That early alpine club was short-lived, but in 1906 the modern Alpine Club of Canada was founded in Winnipeg, and the by then Sir Sandford Fleming became the club&#x27;s first Patron and Honorary President.
In his later years he split his time between Ottawa at his house named &quot;Winterholme&quot; and Halifax where he owned a mansion known as &quot;Blenheim Cottage&quot;, but often called &quot;The Lodge&quot; at the corner of Oxford Street and South Street overlooking the Northwest Arm as well as a summer estate across the Arm called &quot;The Dingle&quot; which included the Sandford Fleming Cottage, a small rustic residence he built in 1886. He later deeded the 95 acres (38 hectares) of &quot;the Dingle&quot; to the city, now known as Sir Sandford Fleming Park (Dingle Park). Fleming died at his Dingle summer Cottage while being cared for by his daughter on July 22, 1915. He was buried in Ottawa&#x27;s Beechwood Cemetery.

== Legacy ==

Fleming was designated a National Historic Person in 1950, on the advice of the national Historic Sites and Monuments Board. On January 7, 2017, Google celebrated Sandford Fleming&#x27;s 190th birthday with a Google Doodle.

<doc id="155591" wikidata="Q2714636" url="?curid=155591" title="La Fortune des Rougon">
<text> &quot;(The Fortune of the Rougons)&quot;, originally published in 1871, is the first novel in Émile Zola&#x27;s monumental twenty-volume series &quot;Les Rougon-Macquart&quot;. The novel is partly an origin story, with a large cast of characters - many of whom become the central figures of later novels in the series - and partly an account of the December 1851 coup d&#x27;état that created the French Second Empire under Napoleon III. The events are experienced through the eyes of a large provincial town in southern France. The title refers not only to the &quot;fortune&quot; chased by protagonists Pierre and Felicité Rougon, but also to the fortunes of the various disparate family members Zola introduces, whose lives are of central importance to later books in the series.

==Plot summary==
After a stirring opening on the eve of the coup d&#x27;état, involving an idealistic young village couple joining up with the republican militia in the middle of the night, Zola then spends the next few chapters going back in time to pre-Revolutionary Provence, and proceeds to lay the foundations for the entire Rougon-Macquart cycle, committing himself to what would become the next twenty-two years of his life&#x27;s work. The fictional town of Plassans (loosely based on the real city of Aix-en-Provence, where Zola grew up and Lorgues, in the Var, where the insurrectional events described in the novel took place in December 1851) is established as the setting for the novel and described in intimate detail, and then we are introduced to the eccentric heroine Adelaide Fouque, later known as &quot;Tante Dide&quot;, who becomes the common ancestor for both the Rougon and Macquart families. Her legitimate son from her short marriage to her late husband, a labourer named Rougon who worked on Dide&#x27;s land, is forced to grow up alongside two illegitimate children — a boy and a girl — from Dide&#x27;s later romance with the smuggler, poacher and alcoholic Macquart, while the ageing Dide slides further and further into a state of mental illness and borderline senile dementia. From this premise, the next nineteen novels all get their central protagonists and to a certain extent their themes.

The narrative continues along double lines, following both &quot;branches&quot; of the family. We see Pierre Rougon (the legitimate son) in his attempts to disinherit his Macquart half-siblings, his marriage to Felicité Puech, the voraciously ambitious daughter of a local merchant, and their continued failure to establish the fortune, fame and renown they seek, despite their greed and relatively comfortable lifestyles. Approaching old age, the Rougon couple finally admit defeat and settle, crushed, into their lower middle class destinies, until by a remarkable stroke of luck their eldest son Eugène reports from Paris that he has some news that they might find interesting. Eugène has become one of the closest allies of the future Emperor Napoleon III and informs his parents that a coup is imminent. Having been effectively given insider information about which side to back in the coming revolution, the Rougons then make a series of seemingly bold moves to show their loyal and steadfast support for Napoleon III, winning the admiration of the most influential people in the town, mostly royalists who are themselves afraid of showing too much commitment for fear of backing the &quot;wrong horse&quot; and losing their standing and fortune.

The narrative then switches over to the Macquart side of the family, whose grim working-class struggles to survive are juxtaposed keenly with the Rougons&#x27; seemingly trivial quest for greater wealth and influence in genteel drawing-room society. Descended from a drunken ne&#x27;er-do-well and a madwoman, Zola effectively predestines the Macquarts to lives of toil and misery. Zola&#x27;s theories of heredity, laid out in the original preface to this novel, were a cornerstone of his entire philosophy and a major reason for his embarking on the mammoth Rougon-Macquart project in the first place in order to illustrate them. Largely discredited nowadays, the theories are largely &quot;present but unseen&quot; in most of the novels in the Rougon-Macquart cycle, allowing those books to be enjoyed without the overshadowing effect of Zola&#x27;s somewhat suspect scientific ideas. Due to the original story nature of , the theories are placed much more to the fore, and can appear somewhat heavy-handed as a result.

A third branch of the family, the Mourets, descended from Macquart and Dide&#x27;s daughter, are then introduced before the novel&#x27;s focus is brought back to the &quot;present&quot;, the night of the coup, via a quite brilliantly told love story. The idealistic but naïve Silvère Mouret falls madly in love with the innocent Miette Chantegreil, and after a long courtship they decide to join up with the republicans to fight the coup. The rest of the novel then picks up from where the opening chapter left off, and from then on is basically a dual narrative telling the story of the old Rougon couple and their increasingly Machiavellian machinations to get themselves into a position of fortune and respect in Plassans, juxtaposed with Silvère and Miette&#x27;s continuing love story and the doomed republican militia&#x27;s disastrous attempt to take the town back. Eventually, the Rougons exploit their half-brother Antoine Macquart into inadvertently helping crush the republican threat, and they achieve their life&#x27;s ambition, fortune and favour. For Silvère and Miette, who committed themselves so completely to a doomed cause, there can be no such happy ending and Zola wisely leaves their half of the story at a bleak dead end.

==Translations==
The second English translation by Henry Vizetelly was published in 1886 and extensively revised (to meet Victorian standards of propriety and avoid prosecution for issuing an indecent publication) by Ernest Vizetelly in 1898, issued under the title &quot;The Fortune of the Rougons&quot; by Chatto &amp; Windus. It is of reasonably poor quality, not helped by Vizetelly&#x27;s boast that he had changed one in every three sentences in the course of his editing. No other translation was available until 2012, when Brian Nelson published one under the Oxford World&#x27;s Classics imprint.

<doc id="155592" wikidata="Q1754235" url="?curid=155592" title="Son Excellence Eugène Rougon">
<text> is the sixth novel in the &quot;Rougon-Macquart&quot; series by Émile Zola. It was serialized in 1876 in &quot;Le Siècle&quot; before being published in novel form by Charpentier. It was translated into English by Brian Nelson in 2018.

The novel is set in the highest echelons of Second Empire government. It follows the career of Eugène Rougon and a dozen or so of his cronies as they jockey for political favor and personal gain, and embraces the public and personal life of Emperor Napoleon III.

The main character is Eugène Rougon (b. 1811), the eldest son of Pierre and Félicité Rougon. Eugène is first introduced in &quot;La fortune des Rougon&quot; as a key player in the coup d&#x27;état of 1851 which established Napoleon III as Emperor of the French. Eugène&#x27;s maneuverings establish his parents&#x27; control over the town of Plassans and lay the foundations for solidifying the family fortune. Eugène, acknowledged as one of the prime movers in legitimizing the Emperor, has remained in Paris to further his quest for power.

Eugène&#x27;s brothers are Pascal, who is the main character of &quot;Le docteur Pascal&quot;, and Aristide, whose story is told in &quot;La curée&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;argent&quot;. He also has two sisters: Sidonie, who appears in &quot;La curée&quot;, and Marthe, one of the protagonists of &quot;La conquête de Plassans&quot;.

==Plot summary==

The novel opens in 1856 with Rougon&#x27;s career at a low ebb. In conflict with the Emperor over an inheritance claim involving a relative of the Empress, Rougon resigns from his position as premier of the Corps législatif before he can be dismissed. This puts the plans and dreams of Rougon&#x27;s friends in limbo, as they are counting on his political influence to win various personal favors. His greatest ally and his greatest adversary is Clorinde Balbi, an Italian woman of dubious background and devious intent. Clorinde desires power as much as Rougon does but, because she is a woman, she is forced to act behind the scenes. Rougon refuses to marry her because he believes two such dominant personalities would inevitably destroy each other. Instead, he encourages her to marry M. Delestang, a man of great wealth who can easily be wheedled, while he himself takes a respectable nonentity of a wife who will not hinder his ambition.

Rougon learns of an assassination plot against the Emperor, but decides to do nothing about it. In consequence, after the attempt is made (the Orsini incident of 1858), the Emperor makes him Minister of the Interior with power to maintain peace and national security at any cost. Rougon uses this as an opportunity to punish his political adversaries, deport anti-imperialists by the hundreds, and reward his loyal friends with honors, commissions, and political appointments. Through his influence, Delestang is made Minister of Agriculture and Commerce.

As Rougon&#x27;s power expands, however, his cronies begin to desert him despite his fulfilling their personal requests. They feel that he has not done enough for them and what he has done either has not been good enough or has had consequences so disastrous as to be no help at all. Moreover, they consider him ungrateful, given all the work they claim to have done to have him reinstated as Minister. Eventually, Rougon is involved in several great scandals based on the favors he has shown to his inner circle.

At the center of all this conflict is Clorinde. As Rougon&#x27;s power has grown, so has hers, until she has influence at the highest level and on an international scale, including as the Emperor&#x27;s mistress. Now having the upper hand, she is able to punish Rougon for his refusal to marry her. To silence political and personal opposition, Rougon decides to submit his resignation to the Emperor, confident that it will not be accepted. However, it is accepted, and Delestang is made Minister of the Interior, the implication being that both actions are founded on Clorinde’s authority over the Emperor.

The novel ends in 1862. The Emperor has returned Rougon to service as Minister without Portfolio, giving him unprecedented powers in the wake of Italian unification. Ostensibly, the appointment is meant to reconfigure the country on less imperialistic, more liberal lines, but in reality Rougon has a free hand to crush resistance, curtail opposition, and control the press.

==Historical basis==

In a preface to the English translation (&quot;His Excellency&quot;. London: Chatto &amp; Windus), Vizetelly states that. in his opinion:

&quot;with all due allowance for its somewhat limited range of subject, &quot;Son Excellence Eugene Rougon&quot; is the one existing French novel which gives the reader a fair general idea of what occurred in political spheres at an important period of the Empire. But His Excellency Eugene Rougon is not, as many critics and others have supposed, a mere portrait or caricature of His Excellency Eugène Rouher, the famous Vice-Emperor of history. Symbolism is to be found in every one of Zola&#x27;s novels, and Rougon, in his main lines, is but the symbol of a principle, or, to be accurate, the symbol of a certain form of the principle of authority. His face is Rouher&#x27;s, like his build and his favorite gesture; but with Rouher&#x27;s words, actions, opinions, and experiences are blended those of half a dozen other personages. He is the incarnation of that craving, that lust for power which impelled so many men of ability to throw all principle to the winds and become the instruments of an abominable system of government. And his transformation at the close of the story is in strict accordance with historical facts.&quot;
== Relation to the other &quot;Rougon-Macquart&quot; novels ==

Zola&#x27;s plan for the &quot;Rougon-Macquart&quot; novels was to show how heredity and environment worked on members of one family over the course of the Second Empire. All of the descendants of Adelaïde Fouque (Tante Dide), Eugène&#x27;s grandmother, demonstrate what today would be called obsessive-compulsive behaviors to varying degrees. Eugène is obsessed with power and controlling the lives of others, as Zola makes clear in chapter 6:
&quot;With him it was love of power for sheer power&#x27;s sake, a love, what is more, untrammelled by any craving for personal glory or wealth or honours. Shockingly ignorant and terribly mediocre in all but the management of other men, it was only by his need to dominate others that he really rose to any height. He loved the mere effort of it, and worshipped his own ability.&quot; (trans. Alec Brown) [&quot;C&#x27;était, chez lui, un amour du pouvoir pour le pouvoir, dégagé des appétits de vanité, de richesses, d&#x27;honneurs. D&#x27;une ignorance crasse, d&#x27;une grande médiocrité dans toutes les choses étrangères au maniement des hommes, il ne devenait véritablement supérieur que par ses besoins de domination. Là, il aimait son effort, il idolâtrait son intelligence.&quot;]
Eugène also resembles his avaricious parents Pierre and Félicité. Their desire for power over their hometown of Plassans becomes in Eugène a desire for power on a national scale. (In this, he shows an affinity to his brothers Aristide, who lusts for money, and Pascal, who thirsts for knowledge.) Zola also strongly suggests that the corrupt environment of Second Empire politics and society is what allows Eugène&#x27;s personality and desire for power to be nurtured and fulfilled.

In &quot;La conquête de Plassans&quot; (set in 1864-1865), Eugène is the unnamed &quot;friend&quot; who sends Abbé Faujas to Plassans to solidify support for the Emperor there.

In &quot;L&#x27;argent&quot; (which opens in 1864), Eugène&#x27;s refusal to help his brother Aristide after a financial setback by the latter is the catalyst for the novel, spurring Aristide to ruthless and unethical speculations that eventually lead to the financial ruination of thousands. To disassociate himself from the scandal and to keep Aristide from prison, Eugène arranges for his brother&#x27;s exile to Belgium.

In &quot;Le docteur Pascal&quot; (set in 1872), Zola tells us that Eugène becomes a deputy in the legislative assembly and remains a staunch defender of the Emperor and the Empire after the Franco-Prussian War. He has no children.

<text>&quot;&quot;&#x27; (English: &quot;The Kill&quot;) is the 2nd novel in Émile Zola&#x27;s 20-volume series Les Rougon-Macquart serialised from 1871 to 1872 and published in book form in 1872. It deals with property speculation and the lives of the extremely wealthy Nouveau riche of the Second French Empire, against the backdrop of Baron Haussmann&#x27;s reconstruction of Paris in the 1850s and 1860s.

Vastly different from its predecessor and prequel , - the portion of the game thrown to the dogs after a hunt, and thus usually translated as &quot;The Kill&quot; - is a character study of three personalities: Aristide Rougon (renamed &quot;Saccard&quot;)--the youngest son of the ruthless and calculating peasant Pierre Rougon and the bourgeois Félicité (by whom he is much spoiled), both of them Bonapartistes and consumed by a desire for wealth, Aristide&#x27;s young second wife Renée (his first dying not long after their move from provincial Plassans to Paris) and Maxime, Aristide&#x27;s foppish son from his first marriage.

== Plot summary ==

The book opens with scenes of astonishing opulence, beginning with Renée and Maxime lazing in a luxurious horse-drawn carriage, very slowly leaving a Parisian park (the Bois de Boulogne) in the 19th century-equivalent of a traffic jam. It is made clear very early on that these are staggeringly wealthy characters not subject to the cares faced by the public; they arrive at their mansion and spend hours being dressed by their servants prior to hosting a banquet attended by some of the richest people in Paris. There seems to be almost no continuity between this scene and the end of the previous novel, until the second chapter begins and Zola reveals that this opulent scene takes place almost fourteen years later. Zola then rewinds time to pick up the story practically minutes after ended.

Following Eugene Rougon&#x27;s rise to political power in Paris in &quot;La Fortune&quot;, his younger brother Aristide, featured in the first novel as a talentless journalist, a comic character unable to commit himself unequivocally to the imperial cause and thus left out in the cold when the rewards were being handed out, decides to follow Eugene to Paris to help himself to the wealth and power he now believes to be his birthright. Eugene promises to help Aristide achieve these things on the condition that he stay out of his way and change his surname to avoid the possibility of bad publicity from Aristide&#x27;s escapades rubbing off on Eugene and damaging his political chances. Aristide chooses the surname Saccard and Eugene gets him a seemingly mundane job at the city planning permission office. The renamed Saccard soon realises that, far from the disappointment he thought the job would be, he is actually in a position to gain insider information on the houses and other buildings that are to be demolished to build Paris&#x27;s bold new system of boulevards. Knowing that the owners of these properties ordered to be demolished by the city government were compensated handsomely, Saccard contrives to borrow money in order to buy up these properties before their status becomes public and then make massive profits.

Saccard is at first unable to get the money to make his initial investments but then his wife falls victim to a terminal illness. Even while she lies dying in the next room, Saccard (in a brilliant scene of breathtaking callousness) is already making arrangements to marry rich girl Renée, who is pregnant and whose family wishes to avoid scandal by offering a huge dowry to any man who will marry her and claim the baby as his own. Saccard accepts and his career in speculation is born. He sends his youngest daughter back home to Plassans and packs his older son Maxime off to a Parisian boarding school; we meet Maxime again when he leaves school several years later and meets his new stepmother Renée, who is at least seven years older.

The flashback complete, the rest of the novel takes place after Saccard has made his fortune, against the backdrop of his luxurious mansion and his profligacy and is concerned with a three-cornered plot of sexual and political intrigue. Renée and Maxime begin a semi-incestuous love affair, which Saccard suspects but appears to tolerate, perhaps due to the commercial nature of his marriage to Renée. Saccard is trying to get Renée to part with the deeds to her family home, which would be worth millions but which she refuses to give up. The novel continues in this vein with the tensions continuing to mount and culminates in a series of bitter observations by Zola on the hypocrisy and immorality of the nouveau riche.

A near-penniless journalist at the time of writing , Zola himself had no experience of the scenes he describes. In order to counter this lack, he toured a large number of stately homes around France, taking copious notes on subjects like architecture, ladies&#x27; and men&#x27;s fashions, jewellery, garden design, greenhouse plants (a seduction scene takes place in Saccard&#x27;s hothouse), carriages, mannerisms, servants&#x27; liveries; these notes (volumes of which are preserved) were time well spent, as many contemporary observers praised the novel for its realism.

* Immorality (common theme in Zola)

== Primary characters ==
* Aristide (Rougon) Saccard, speculator

* Sidonie Rougon, sister of Aristide; procuress
* Eugène Rougon, brother of Aristide; politician

== English translations ==
The novel was first translated (translator unknown) very poorly and with many bowdlerizations and reissued by Henry Vizetelly in the 1880s and 1890s under the title &quot;The Rush for the Spoil&quot;, with an introduction by George Moore.

An unexpurgated translation by the poet and critic Alexander Texeira de Mattos was published in a limited edition in 1895 under the French title, with an English equivalent (&quot;The Hounds&#x27; Fee&quot;) in parentheses. This translation, retitled &quot;The Kill&quot; upon its 1954 reprinting, was the standard English text of the novel for over a century. The critic Graham King remarked that &quot;its remarkably timeless tone no doubt acts as a deterrent to a more modern competitor.&quot;

In 2004, two new English translations by Arthur Goldhammer (Modern Library) and Brian Nelson (Oxford World&#x27;s Classics) were published to acclaim.

== Adaptations==
 was adapted in the 1917 silent Italian film &quot;La cuccagna&quot;, directed by Baldassarre Negroni.

Director Roger Vadim updated the setting to modern-day Paris in the 1966 film , released in English-speaking markets as &quot;The Game Is Over&quot;. The film starred Jane Fonda, Peter McEnery and Michel Piccoli.

<text> (&quot;Money&quot;) is the eighteenth novel in the &quot;Rougon-Macquart&quot; series by Émile Zola. It was serialized in the periodical &quot;Gil Blas&quot; beginning in November 1890 before being published in novel form by Charpentier et Fasquelle in March 1891.

The novel focuses on the financial world of the Second French Empire as embodied in the Paris Bourse and exemplified by the fictional character of Aristide Saccard. Zola&#x27;s intent was to show the terrible effects of speculation and fraudulent company promotion, the culpable negligence of company directors, and the impotency of contemporary financial laws.

Aristide Saccard (b. 1815 as Aristide Rougon) is the youngest son of Pierre and Félicité Rougon. He is first introduced in &quot;La fortune des Rougon.&quot; &quot;L&#x27;argent&quot; is a direct sequel to &quot;La curée&quot; (published in 1871), which details Saccard&#x27;s first rise to wealth using underhanded methods. Sensing his unscrupulous nature, his brother Eugène Rougon prompts Aristide to change his surname from Rougon to Saccard.

Aristide&#x27;s other brother Pascal is the main character of &quot;Le docteur Pascal&quot;. He also has two sisters: Sidonie, who appears in &quot;La curée&quot;, and Marthe, one of the protagonists of &quot;La conquête de Plassans.&quot;

==Plot summary==

The novel takes place in 1864–1869, beginning a few months after the death of Saccard&#x27;s second wife Renée (see &quot;La curée&quot;). Saccard is bankrupt and an outcast among the Bourse financiers. Searching for a way to reestablish himself, Saccard is struck by plans developed by his upstairs neighbor, the engineer Georges Hamelin, who dreams of restoring Christianity to the Middle East through great public works: rail lines linking important cities, improved roads and transportation, renovated eastern Mediterranean ports, and fleets of modern ships to move goods around the world.

Saccard decides to institute a financial establishment to fund these projects. He is motivated primarily by the potential to make incredible amounts of money and reestablish himself on the Bourse. In addition, Saccard has an intense rivalry with his brother Eugène Rougon, a powerful Cabinet minister who refuses to help him after his bankruptcy and who is promoting a more liberal, less Catholic agenda for the Empire. Furthermore, Saccard, an intense anti-Semite, sees the enterprise as a strike against the Jewish bankers who dominate the Bourse. 
From the beginning, Saccard&#x27;s Banque Universelle (Universal Bank) stands on shaky ground. In order to manipulate the price of the stock, Saccard and his confreres on the syndicate he has set up to jumpstart the enterprise buy their own stock and hide the proceeds of this illegal practice in a dummy account fronted by a straw man.

While Hamelin travels to Constantinople to lay the groundwork for their enterprise, the Banque Universelle goes from strength to strength. Stock prices soar, going from 500 francs a share to more than 3,000 francs in three years. Furthermore, Saccard buys several newspapers which serve to maintain the illusion of legitimacy, promote the Banque, excite the public, and attack Rougon.

The novel follows the fortunes of about 20 characters, cutting across all social strata, showing the effects of stock market speculation on rich and poor. The financial events of the novel are played against Saccard&#x27;s personal life. Hamelin lives with his sister Caroline, who, against her better judgment, invests in the Banque Universelle and later becomes Saccard&#x27;s mistress. Caroline learns that Saccard fathered a son, Victor, during his first days in Paris. She rescues Victor from his life of abject poverty, placing him in a charitable institution. But Victor is completely unredeemable, given over to greed, laziness, and thievery. After he attacks one of the women at the institution, he disappears into the streets, never to be seen again.

Eventually, the Banque Universelle cannot sustain itself. Saccard&#x27;s principal rival on the Bourse, the Jewish financier Gundermann, learns about Saccard&#x27;s financial trickery and attacks, loosing stock upon the market, devaluing its price, and forcing Saccard to buy millions of shares to keep the price up. At the final collapse, the Banque holds one-fourth of its own shares worth 200 million francs. The fall of the Banque is felt across the entire financial world. Indeed, all of France feels the force of its collapse. The effects on the characters of &quot;L&#x27;argent&quot; are disastrous, including complete ruin, suicide, and exile, though some of Saccard&#x27;s syndicate members escape and Gundermann experiences a windfall. Saccard and Hamelin are sentenced to five years in prison. Through the intervention of Saccard&#x27;s brother Eugène Rougon, who doesn&#x27;t want a brother in jail, their sentences are commuted and they are forced to leave France. Saccard goes to Belgium, and the novel ends with Caroline preparing to follow her brother to Rome.

==Historical background==
Because the financial world is closely linked with politics, &quot;L’argent&quot; encompasses many historical events, including:
*The 1860 Druze massacre of Maronite Christians in Syria
*France&#x27;s invasion of Mexico (1861–1867)
*The construction of the Suez Canal, opened in 1869
*The Austro-Prussian War, including the Battle of Königgrätz at Sadowa in 1866
*The Third Italian War of Independence (1866)
*The Universal Exposition of 1867
*The publication of &quot;Das Kapital&quot; in 1867 and the advent of Marxism
*The 1882 collapse of the Union Générale bank
*The Marquis of Salamanca, a fabulously wealthy Spanish speculator, is the inspiration behind the Prince of Oviedo. 

By the end of the novel, the stage is set for the Franco-Prussian War (1870–1871) and the fall of the Second Empire.

== Relation to the other &quot;Rougon-Macquart&quot; novels ==

Zola&#x27;s plan for the &quot;Rougon-Macquart&quot; novels was to show how heredity and environment worked on members of one family over the course of the Second Empire. All of the descendants of Adelaïde Fouque (Tante Dide), Saccard&#x27;s grandmother, demonstrate what today would be called obsessive-compulsive behaviors to varying degrees. Saccard is obsessed with money and the building of wealth, to which everything in his life holds second place. In &quot;Le docteur Pascal,&quot; Zola describes the influence of heredity on Saccard as an &quot;adjection&quot; in which the natures of his avaricious parents are commingled.

Two other members of the Rougon-Macquart family also appear in &quot;L&#x27;argent&quot;: Saccard&#x27;s sons Maxime (b. 1840) and Victor (b. 1853). If his father&#x27;s obsession is with building wealth, Maxime&#x27;s obsession is with keeping it. A widower, Maxime (who played a central role in &quot;La curée&quot;) lives alone in opulence he does not share. In &quot;Le docteur Pascal&quot;, Maxime is described as prematurely aged, afraid of pleasure and indeed of all life, devoid of emotion, and cold, characteristics introduced in &quot;L&#x27;argent&quot;. Maxime is described as a &quot;dissemination&quot; of characteristics, having the moral prepotency of his father and the pampered egotism of his mother (Saccard&#x27;s first wife).

Victor, on the other hand, brought up in squalor, is the furthest extreme Zola illustrates of the Rougon family&#x27;s degeneracy. Like his great-grandmother Tante Dide, Victor suffers from neuralgic attacks. Unlike Jacques Lantier (his second cousin, see &quot;La bête humaine&quot;), he is unable to control his criminal impulses, and his disappearance into the streets of Paris is no surprise. Victor is described as a &quot;fusion&quot; of the lowest characteristics of his parents (his mother was a prostitute).

In &quot;Le docteur Pascal&quot; (set in 1872), Zola tells us that Saccard returns to Paris, institutes a newspaper, and is again making piles of money.

Rougon is the protagonist of &quot;Son Excellence Eugène Rougon,&quot; the events of which predate &quot;L&#x27;argent.&quot; Saccard&#x27;s daughter Clotilde (b. 1847) is the main female character in &quot;Le docteur Pascal.&quot;

<doc id="155600" wikidata="Q2357164" url="?curid=155600" title="The Master (Doctor Who)">
<text>The Master, or &quot;Missy&quot; (short for &quot;Mistress&quot;) in their female incarnation, is a recurring character and one of the main antagonists of the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and its associated spin-off works.

Multiple actors have played the Master since the character&#x27;s introduction in 1971. Within the show&#x27;s narrative, the change in actors and subsequent change of the character&#x27;s appearance is sometimes explained as the Master taking possession of other characters&#x27; bodies or as a consequence of regeneration, which is a biological attribute that allows Time Lords to survive fatal injuries or old age.

The Master was originally played by Roger Delgado from 1971 until his death in 1973. The role was subsequently played by Peter Pratt, Geoffrey Beevers, and Anthony Ainley, with Ainley reprising the role regularly through the 1980s until the series’s cancellation in 1989. Eric Roberts took on the role for the 1996 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; TV film. Since the show&#x27;s revival in 2005, the Master has been portrayed by Derek Jacobi, John Simm, Michelle Gomez, and Sacha Dhawan.

Beevers, Roberts, Jacobi, Simm, and Gomez have reprised the role in audio dramas produced by Big Finish Productions. At the same time, Alex Macqueen, Gina McKee, Mark Gatiss, James Dreyfus, and Milo Parker portrayed incarnations unique to Big Finish.

== Origins ==
The creative team conceived of the Master as a recurring villain, first appearing in &quot;Terror of the Autons&quot; (1971). The Master&#x27;s title was deliberately chosen by producer Barry Letts and script editor Terrance Dicks because, like the Doctor, it was a title conferred by an academic degree. A sketch of three &quot;new characters&quot; for 1971 (the other two being Jo Grant and Mike Yates) suggested he was conceived to be of &quot;equal, perhaps even superior rank, to the Doctor.&quot;

Letts only had one man in mind for the role: Roger Delgado, who had a long history of playing villains and had already made three attempts to be cast in the series. He had worked previously with Letts and was a good friend of Jon Pertwee.

Malcolm Hulke spoke of the character and his relationship with the Doctor: &quot;There was a peculiar relationship between the Master and the Doctor: one felt that the Master wouldn&#x27;t really have liked to eliminate the Doctor...you see the Doctor was the only person like him at the time in the whole universe, a renegade Time Lord and in a funny sort of way they were partners in crime.&quot;

An unrelated character also known as the Master, who ruled over the Land of Fiction, had previously appeared in the 1968 serial &quot;The Mind Robber&quot; opposite the Second Doctor.

== Aims and character ==
A would-be universal conqueror, the Master wants to control the universe. In &quot;The Deadly Assassin&quot; (1976), his ambitions are described as becoming &quot;the master of all matter&quot;. He also had a secondary objective: to make the Doctor suffer. In &quot;The Sea Devils&quot; (1972), the Master mentions that the &quot;pleasure&quot; of seeing the destruction of the human race, of which the Doctor is fond, would be &quot;a reward in itself.&quot;

== History within the show ==

=== Encounters with the Third Doctor ===
The Master, as played by Roger Delgado, makes his first appearance in &quot;Terror of the Autons&quot; (1971), where he allies with the Nestene Consciousness to help them invade Earth. The Third Doctor (Jon Pertwee) convinces the Master to stop this plan at the last minute, and the Master subsequently escapes, albeit with his TARDIS left non-functioning after the Doctor confiscates the ship&#x27;s dematerialisation circuit.

Having become a main character in the show&#x27;s eighth season, the Master reappears in &quot;The Mind of Evil&quot;, where he regains his TARDIS&#x27;s circuit from the Doctor after attempting to launch a nerve gas missile that would initiate World War III. The Master is seen again in another incursion on Earth in &quot;The Claws of Axos&quot;, and then fails to hold the galaxy to ransom using a doomsday weapon on the planet Uxarieus in the year 2472 in &quot;Colony in Space.&quot; In &quot;The Dæmons,&quot; The Master is finally captured on Earth by the organization UNIT after Jo Grant (Katy Manning) prevents the alien Azal (Stephen Thorne) from giving The Master his powers.

In &quot;The Sea Devils&quot; (1972), the Master is shown to be imprisoned on an island off the coast of England. He convinces the governor of the prison, Colonel Trenchard (Clive Morton), to help him steal electronics from HMS Seaspite, the nearby naval base. This allows the Master to contact the reptilian Sea Devils, the former rulers of Earth, so he can help them retake the planet from humanity. The Master convinces the Doctor to help him build machinery that would bring the Sea Devils out of their millions of years of hibernation. Still, the Doctor sabotages the device by overloading it, destroying the Sea Devil base, and preventing war between humanity and reptiles. The Master subsequently escapes in a hovercraft. The Doctor reveals in this serial that the Master was once a &quot;very good friend&quot; of his.

Delgado&#x27;s last appearance as the Master is in &quot;Frontier in Space&quot; (1973), where he works alongside the Dalek and Ogron races to provoke a war between the Human and Draconian Empires. The scheme fails, and the Master escapes after he shoots at the Doctor.

Delgado was slated to return in a serial called &quot;The Final Game&quot;, which would have been the season 11 finale. However, he died in a car crash in June 1973, and the story was never produced.

=== A new regeneration cyclethe long serving Master===
Played by Peter Pratt in his next appearance, the Master returns in &quot;The Deadly Assassin&quot; (1976), opposite the Fourth Doctor (Tom Baker). Special effects makeup was applied to Pratt to give the Master a corpse-like appearance. Found by Chancellor Goth (Bernard Horsfall) on the planet Tersurus, the Master is revealed to be in his final regeneration and near the end of his final life. The Master attempts to gain a new regeneration cycle by using the artefacts of Rassilon, the symbols of the President of the Council of Time Lords, to manipulate the Eye of Harmony at the cost of Gallifrey. But the Doctor stops the Master, who escapes after his assumed death.

The Master later returns in &quot;The Keeper of Traken&quot;, the role taken over by Geoffrey Beevers. Still dying, the Master came to the Traken Union to renew his life by using the empire&#x27;s technological Source. Though the plot fails, the Master manages to cheat death by transferring his essence into the body of a Traken scientist named Tremas (Anthony Ainley) and overwriting his host&#x27;s mind.

The Master (Ainley, in a total of 31 episodes as the character) confronted the next three regenerations of the Doctor on and off for the rest of the classic series, still seeking to extend his life – preferably with a new set of regenerations. Subsequently, in &quot;The Five Doctors&quot; (1983), the Time Lords offer the Master a new regeneration cycle in exchange for his help, though the promise was not fulfilled at the time.

The Master&#x27;s final appearance in the classic series is in &quot;Survival&quot; (1989, the final story of the series&#x27; original 26-year run), trapped on the planet of the Cheetah People and under its influence, which drives its victims to savagery. Though the Master manages to escape the doomed planet, he ends up back on the planet prior to its destruction when he attempts to kill the Seventh Doctor (Sylvester McCoy).

=== Dalek trial and &#x27;execution&#x27; ===
The Master was the primary antagonist of the 1996 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; television movie. He was played by American actor Eric Roberts.

In the prologue, the Master (portrayed briefly by Gordon Tipple) is executed by the Daleks as a punishment for his &quot;evil crimes&quot;. But before his apparent death, the Master requests his remains to be brought back to Gallifrey by the Seventh Doctor. However, as posited in the novelisation of the movie by Gary Russell, the Master&#x27;s self-alterations to extend his lifespan allow him to survive his execution by transferring his mind into a snake-like entity called a &quot;morphant.&quot; This interpretation is made explicit in the first of the Eighth Doctor Adventures novels, &quot;The Eight Doctors&quot; by Terrance Dicks, and also used in the &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; comic strip story &quot;The Fallen&quot;, which states that the &quot;morphant&quot; was a shape-shifting animal native to Skaro.

Using his morphant body to break free from the container holding his remains, the Master sabotages the Doctor&#x27;s TARDIS console to force it to crash land in San Francisco in December, 1999. From there, the Master, as the morphant, enters the body of a paramedic named Bruce to take control of him. However, the Master finds his human host to be unsustainable as the body slowly begins to degenerate, although the Master has the added abilities to spit an acid-like bile, both as a weapon and to mentally control victims as an alternative to his usual hypnotic abilities. The Master attempts to access the Eye of Harmony to steal the remaining regenerations of the Eighth Doctor (Paul McGann), but instead is sucked into it and supposedly killed.

=== Professor Yana and Harold Saxon ===
In &quot;Utopia&quot;, a scientist called Professor Yana (Derek Jacobi) is revealed to be the Master, disguised in biological human form to hide from the Time War. Yana overhears a conversation between the Doctor and Jack Harkness about the time vortex and time travel in general. He used the Chameleon Arch to temporarily place his Time Lord identity within a Fob Watch. This makes Yana curious about his own fob watch and when he opens it he is reunited with the Master&#x27;s consciousness. The Master is shot and regenerates into a new body (John Simm) and steals the Doctor&#x27;s TARDIS.

In &quot;The Sound of Drums,&quot; the Doctor makes his way back to Earth to find the Master has become Prime Minister of the UK under the alias of Harold Saxon. The Master kidnaps Martha&#x27;s family and conquers Earth.

In &quot;Last of the Time Lords&quot;, Martha spends a year working to save her family and to thwart the Master&#x27;s plan to wage war against the universe. The Master himself mentions that looking into the vortex as a child made &quot;the drumming&quot; choose him as a &quot;call to war&quot; in his head. When fatally shot by his human wife, Lucy Saxon (Alexandra Moen), the Master refuses to regenerate, knowing it will haunt the Doctor.

The Master returns in &quot;The End of Time&quot; (2009–2010) when his disciples attempt a resurrection ritual using a surviving piece of the Master&#x27;s body. However, Lucy sabotages the ritual, bringing the Master back as an unstable creature, hungry for human flesh and leaking electrical energy. The Master proceeds with a plot to transform the entire human race into his own clones. The Master is sent back to Gallifrey when the Time Lords are sealed away in the Time War, trapped once more.

=== Missy ===
The Master influences the Doctor&#x27;s life in the seventh series episode &quot;The Bells of Saint John&quot;, when an unseen &quot;woman in the shop&quot; gives Clara Oswald the phone number to the TARDIS, initiating Clara&#x27;s time as a companion. Independent of any connection to the &quot;woman in the shop&quot;, an unidentified woman (Michelle Gomez) appears briefly in the eighth series episodes &quot;Deep Breath&quot; and “Into the Dalek”, welcoming a character to the afterlife. This mystery woman, and the fact that she is the &quot;woman in the shop&quot;, is not revealed to be the Doctor&#x27;s childhood friend until &quot;Dark Water&quot;, when she formally introduces herself to the Doctor as a new female incarnation called &quot;Missy&quot;, which is short for &quot;Mistress&quot;. She reveals that she has created an &quot;afterlife&quot; from a Gallifreyan Matrix Data Slice, which stores the consciousness of dead people so they can eventually be made into Cybermen.

In &quot;Death in Heaven&quot;, Missy offers the Doctor control of her Cybermen army in the hopes of compromising his morality. She is defeated when her Cyber army is destroyed, and appears vaporised when shot by the posthumously cyber-converted Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart. Missy returns in &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Apprentice&quot;/&quot;The Witch&#x27;s Familiar&quot; (2015), revealed to have faked her demise using a teleporter powered by the energy of the Cyberman laser weapon that shot her.

In the tenth series episode &quot;Extremis&quot;, it is revealed that the Doctor is keeping Missy in the well appointed Vault, having spared her from execution but vowing to keep her locked away for one thousand years. In &quot;The Lie of the Land&quot;, the Doctor&#x27;s crew visits Missy in the Vault to gain intelligence on the Monks. Her demeanour seems little changed, and she has low regard for human life, but in the episode&#x27;s , she sheds remorseful tears for all the millions of deaths she has caused. In &quot;Empress of Mars,&quot; she returns the Doctor&#x27;s TARDIS to Mars to rescue the Doctor and Bill. In &quot;The Eaters of Light,&quot; she has been released from her cage by the Doctor to run repairs on his TARDIS, which is isomorphically locked so that she cannot pilot it.

The Doctor attempts to test Missy&#x27;s reformation in the tenth series finale &quot;World Enough and Time&quot;/&quot;The Doctor Falls&quot; by sending Missy, Bill, and Nardole (Matt Lucas) on a rescue mission aboard a spaceship experiencing time dilation near a black hole. However, the Master (John Simm) is aboard the ship and has initiated the Cybermen&#x27;s genesis. Missy&#x27;s loyalties are torn between the Doctor and her old self. After initially betraying the Doctor, she later stands alongside him against a Cyberman army, stabbing her past self causing the Master to regenerate. Enraged at Missy becoming the Doctor&#x27;s ally, the Master shoots Missy with his laser screwdriver, ostensibly disabling her ability to regenerate and killing her.

=== Spy Master and Grigori Rasputin ===

During &quot;Spyfall&quot; the Thirteenth Doctor seeks out a former MI6 agent known as &#x27;O&#x27; (Sacha Dhawan) who reveals himself as a new incarnation of the Master during the cliffhanger, having killed the real O and assumed his identity. In &quot;The Timeless Children&quot;, the Master takes the Doctor into the ruins of Gallifrey, and reveals how the Time Lords secretly acquired the power to regenerate by harvesting the DNA of the Timeless Child, who is revealed to be the Doctor, who lived throughout Gallifrey&#x27;s civilisation and had her memory wiped on at least one occasion.

The Master attempts to kill the Lone Cyberman and persuades the Cyberium, an AI containing all Cyberman knowledge and history, to use his body as a host. Using the Cyberium, the Master creates a new Cyberman race with regenerative abilities from dead Time Lords. The Doctor fails to defeat the Master using the &quot;Death Particle&quot;, which can destroy all organic life on a planet. Ko Sharmus, the Boundary guardian, blames himself for the new Cyberman race as he was responsible for hiding the Cyberium and failed. As the Doctor escapes, Ko Sharmus sacrifices himself by detonating the Death Particle, ostensibly killing the Master and his army of Cyber Masters.

After a hint in &quot;The Vanquishers&quot; (2021), Dhawan&#x27;s Master returned in &quot;The Power of the Doctor&quot; (2022), Jodie Whittaker&#x27;s final episode as the Thirteenth Doctor. In the episode, the Master, having survived the Death Particle, becomes Grigori Rasputin in 1916 Russia and allies with his Cybermasters and the Daleks. After baiting UNIT by defacing famous paintings, he and his allies capture the Doctor, whom he takes back to 1916. He reveals his plan to turn the Earth into a foundry for the Cybermen and Daleks, and uses the energy of a captured being called a Qurunx to forcibly regenerate the Doctor into him.

The Master, now possessing the Doctor&#x27;s body and TARDIS, intends to tarnish her name by using it as a force for terror, and begins to enact his plan. However, companion Yasmin &quot;Yaz&quot; Khan shoves him out of the TARDIS, and uses a failsafe holographic AI of the Doctor to help former companions Tegan Jovanka and Ace stop the Cybermen and the Daleks while she recaptures the Master, using the Master&#x27;s own equipment and the energies of the Time Lord/Cyberman hybrids to reverse the regeneration, returning the Doctor to her thirteenth body. After the restored Doctor and her various allies stop the Cybermen and Daleks, she frees the Qurunx and has it destroy the Master&#x27;s planet with an energy beam. In his weakened, original body, the Master aims the beam at the Doctor (triggering her next regeneration) before collapsing near his own TARDIS. Yaz manages to rescue the Doctor, but the Master is left behind on the imploding planet, seemingly perishing along with it.

=== Trapped by the Toymaker ===
In the 2023 special &quot;The Giggle,&quot; the Toymaker tells the Fourteenth Doctor that the Master is one of several beings that he has won games against. The Toymaker reveals that having won a game against the Master as he was &quot;begging for his life&quot;, he had trapped him inside a golden tooth for all eternity. Later, when the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Doctors banish the Toymaker from existence, the tooth is left on the floor and picked up by someone unknown.

== Characteristics ==
=== Intelligence and attitude ===
The Master and the Doctor are shown to have similar levels of intelligence, and were classmates at the Time Lord Academy on Gallifrey, where the Master outperformed the Doctor. A similar connection between the two was also referenced in &quot;The End of Time&quot; in which the Master reminisces with the Tenth Doctor about his father&#x27;s estates on Gallifrey and his childhood with the Doctor before saying &quot;look at us now&quot;. In the 2007 episode &quot;Utopia&quot;, the Tenth Doctor calls the transformed and disguised Master a genius and shows admiration for his intellect before discovering his true identity. The Tenth Doctor further expresses admiration for the Master&#x27;s intellect in &quot;The End of Time&quot; by calling him &quot;stone cold brilliant&quot; and yet states that the Master could be more if he would just give up his desire for domination. The Twelfth Doctor states that Missy is &quot;the one person almost as smart as me&quot; (&quot;The Lie of the Land&quot;).

Delgado&#x27;s portrayal of the Master was that of a suave and charming psychopathic individual, able to be polite and murderous at almost the same time. His design is an homage to the classic Svengali character: a black Nehru outfit with a beard and moustache. This version of the Master, like his opponent the Third Doctor, possessed considerable fighting skills; at one point in the episode &quot;The Sea Devils&quot;, the Master and the Doctor engage in a swordfight. Also like the Doctor, the Master enjoyed using various scientific gadgets, devices, and weapons in his schemes, with the most prominent being a weapon called the Tissue Compression Eliminator (or TCE for short), that kills anyone it&#x27;s used on by compressing their body to the size of a toy doll. In &quot;The Mind of Evil&quot;, he not only creates the &quot;Keller machine&quot; to drain evil impulses from the minds of anyone subjected to it, but also makes use of a mind control device (that can also be used to amplify the effects of the Keller machine, as he demonstrates on the Doctor).

In the portrayals of the Master on his last regeneration (first by Peter Pratt in &quot;The Deadly Assassin&quot;, then by Geoffrey Beevers in &quot;The Keeper of Traken&quot;), he is shown to still retain his scientific intelligence and deviousness despite being in a extreme state of physical decay. However, the trauma his body has been put through has driven him insane as he obsessively attempts to find a way to obtain a new cycle of regenerations without regard to what the cost might be.

When Anthony Ainley takes over as the Master (in &quot;The Keeper of Traken&quot;, the Master possesses the body of the noble Tremas, who was played by Ainley throughout the story), his portrayal showed the Master as almost singularly obsessed with humiliating and destroying the Doctor; while possessing the same level of intelligence and cunning that his previous incarnations had, the Ainley version of the character often had a much shorter temper, flying into a rage more often than the cool, suave version that Delgado portrayed. Ainley&#x27;s Master was also much more outwardly villainous, at times murdering people (usually with his familiar TCE) not because they jeopardized his schemes, but simply because he enjoyed killing (often accompanying these deaths with his trademark sinister low and throaty chuckle). Nearly all of the schemes of this particular incarnation revolve around setting a trap to lure the Doctor into; as an example, near the beginning of &quot;The Mark of the Rani&quot;, the Master is shown to be hiding out in a field disguised as a scarecrow, for no apparent reason other than to wait for the Doctor to show up. During the same story, the Rani (a fellow villainous Time Lord that the Master strongarms into assisting him) remarked that the Master would &quot;get dizzy if he tried to walk in a straight line&quot;, a reference to the Master&#x27;s often convoluted and complicated schemes he devised in order to trap the Doctor. Ainley&#x27;s portrayal of the Master is notable for being the only incarnation of the character to have met and interacted with every one of the Doctor&#x27;s incarnations during the show&#x27;s run in the 1980s, having met the First, Second and Third Doctors during &quot;The Five Doctors&quot;, as well as being one of the primary antagonists of the Fifth Doctor throughout his run (starting with &quot;Castrovalva&quot; and last encountering him in &quot;Planet of Fire&quot;), and having encountered the Fourth Doctor (&quot;Logopolis&quot;), Sixth Doctor (&quot;The Mark of the Rani&quot;, as well as turning up during the events of &quot;The Trial of a Time Lord&quot;), and Seventh Doctor (&quot;Survival&quot;, which was the final time Ainley played the Master during the original series&#x27; run, as well as the final story of the original series overall).

Though only appearing onscreen as the Master for a brief time during the events of &quot;Utopia&quot;, Derek Jacobi&#x27;s portrayal of the Master shows him as still possessing the evil nature of his predecessors (just prior to opening the fob watch that was secretly his biodata module, the Master heard voices of his past selves, including dialogue from Roger Delgado as well as Anthony Ainley&#x27;s sinister chuckle). Transformed from the kindly Professor Yana after opening the fob watch, the Master rages at Chantho for not ever asking him about his fob watch, angrily blaming her for leaving him trapped in his secret identity; wielding a high voltage electric cable, the Master tells Chantho who he really is just before murdering her. Even after being shot by the dying Chantho, the Master snarls that he was killed by &quot;an insect...a girl&quot; before deciding to regenerate into a &quot;young and strong&quot; body like that of the Doctor&#x27;s.

Aspects of Simm&#x27;s portrayal of the Master parallel David Tennant&#x27;s Doctor, primarily in his ability to make light of tense situations and his rather quirky and hyperactive personality. According to the producers, this was done to make the Master more threatening to the Doctor by having him take one of his opponent&#x27;s greatest strengths, as well as making the parallels between the two characters more distinctive. This rationale is written into dialogue by the Master in &quot;Utopia,&quot; in which he explicitly states, as he is regenerating, that if the Doctor can be young and strong, then so can he.

Michelle Gomez maintained Simm&#x27;s portrayal of the character, specifically the psychopathic behaviour and inappropriate emotional responses to certain situations. She also portrayed the original traditions of ruthless, murderous behaviour and grandiose, Machiavellian criminal intelligence that have been consistent throughout all incarnations. However, she also displayed a much more coquettish manner, with her new female identity allowing her to fully express aspects of the Master&#x27;s ambiguous bond with the Doctor (as previously explored by Simm&#x27;s incarnation in &quot;The Sound of Drums&quot;). While determined to torment and corrupt the Doctor with moral temptation while inflicting pain and death to humanity, she frequently referred to him as her &quot;boyfriend&quot; or &quot;friend&quot; and appeared to desire his acquiescence and company ultimately. She is also well aware that she is even more dangerously psychopathic than before, describing herself as &quot;bananas&quot; to UNIT agent Osgood right before killing her (&quot;Death in Heaven&quot;). However, when circumstances result in Missy being kept in a vault and monitored by the Doctor after an averted execution, Missy actually comes to show signs of remorse for what she had done in the past, to the point that she prepares to side with the Doctor over her own past incarnation (&quot;The Doctor Falls&quot;).

Dhawan&#x27;s Master returns to the Master&#x27;s love of evil for the sake of being evil, proclaiming at one point that he kills because he&#x27;s good at it and asking why he should ever stop. Where Missy&#x27;s actions were based around a twisted attraction to the Doctor, Dhawan&#x27;s Master destroys Gallifrey simply because he cannot bring himself to accept a discovery that suggests Time Lord society owes regeneration and other secrets of its past to the child that became the Doctor. He perceives this as creating a twisted link between the Doctor and himself.

=== Mental abilities ===
Both the Doctor and the Master have been shown to be skilled hypnotists, although the Master&#x27;s capacity to dominate—even by stare and voice alone—has been shown to be far more pronounced. In &quot;Logopolis,&quot; the Doctor said of the Master, &quot;He&#x27;s a Time Lord. In many ways, we have the same mind.&quot; The Master is often able to anticipate the Doctor&#x27;s moves, as seen in stories such as &quot;Castrovalva&quot;, &quot;The Keeper of Traken&quot;, &quot;Time-Flight&quot;, and &quot;The King&#x27;s Demons&quot;, where he plans elaborate traps for the Doctor, only revealing his presence at the key moment. In &quot;The Deadly Assassin&quot;, the Master was able to send a false premonition as a telepathic message to the Doctor, but it is unclear whether he performed this through innate psychic ability, or was aided technologically.

In &quot;The End of Time,&quot; the Master uses a kind of psychic technique, previously used by the Doctor to read the minds of others, allowing the Doctor to hear the constant &#x27;drumming&#x27; inside the Master&#x27;s mind.

=== TARDIS ===
In the original series, the Master&#x27;s TARDISes have had fully functioning chameleon circuits, having appeared as various things, including a horsebox, a spaceship, a fir tree, a computer bank, a grandfather clock, a fluted architectural column, an iron maiden, a fireplace, a British Airways jet, a cottage and a triangular column. Of the Master&#x27;s TARDISes seen in &quot;The Keeper of Traken&quot;, one appears as the calcified, statue-like Melkur, able to move and even walk; the other appears as a grandfather clock. The Melkur TARDIS is destroyed. At one point in &quot;Logopolis&quot;, the Master&#x27;s TARDIS even appears as a police box, like the Doctor&#x27;s.

Missy uses a vortex manipulator rather than a TARDIS in series nine. She used a pair of them which were linked to one another, to transport herself and Clara Oswald to the Doctor&#x27;s &#x27;farewell party&#x27; in medieval Essex (&quot;The Magician&#x27;s Apprentice&quot;). They are destroyed in &quot;The Witch&#x27;s Familiar&quot; when, to avoid being killed by Daleks, they channel energy from the Daleks&#x27; weapons to teleport them away, looking as if they were exterminated.

In &quot;The Doctor Falls&quot;, the Master acquired a TARDIS before leaving Gallifrey but burnt out its dematerialisation circuit while attempting to get away from a black hole too fast. His future incarnation Missy provides him with a spare, and the Master can fix his TARDIS and depart.

In &quot;Spyfall, Part 1&quot;, the disguised Master lives in an outback shack which he later reveals to be his TARDIS. In Part 2, he is shown flying this TARDIS to London in 1834 and Paris in 1943. The Thirteenth Doctor later steals it from him to return to the present after being trapped in the past without her TARDIS. This is the first time since the show&#x27;s revival that the Master&#x27;s TARDIS interior is shown on screen and is noted to be the same size on the inside.

=== Handheld weaponry ===
The Master&#x27;s weapon of choice in the original show&#x27;s run was the &quot;tissue compression eliminator,&quot; which shrinks its target to doll-like proportions, killing them in the process. Its appearance is similar to that of the Doctor&#x27;s tool, the sonic screwdriver.
Despite his own fondness for the weapon, Russell T Davies decided against bringing it back for the Master&#x27;s reappearance in &quot;The Sound of Drums&quot; because the Master had too many new &quot;tricks&quot; to use against the Doctor.

During the course of &quot;The Sound of Drums,&quot; the Master unveils a new handheld weapon: a laser screwdriver. The device functions as a powerful laser weapon, capable of killing with a single shot. It also carries the ability to age victims rapidly using a miniaturised version of the genetic manipulator developed by Professor Lazarus (&quot;The Lazarus Experiment&quot;). The screwdriver is biometrically secured so that only the Master can use it. In &quot;The Doctor Falls,&quot; the Master uses a laser screwdriver again to battle the Cybermen. After being stabbed by Missy, the Master shoots her with the laser screwdriver at &quot;full blast,&quot; which he said would prevent her regeneration and kill her permanently.

In &quot;Dark Water&quot;/&quot;Death in Heaven,&quot; Missy uses a small hand-held device, about the size of a large mobile phone, which allows her to control her technology and scan her surroundings remotely. It also contains a weapon that she uses to disintegrate Dr. Chang, Osgood, and Seb. In &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Apprentice,&quot; Missy uses a newer, upgraded version of this device which appears to be more powerful. It allowed her to control airborne planes after she had frozen them in time and simultaneously disintegrate several UNIT guards.

Missy&#x27;s parasol is revealed to be a disguised sonic/laser device in &quot;The Doctor Falls.&quot; She uses it to defend against an attacking Cyberman. A more unusual feature, demonstrated in &quot;Death in Heaven,&quot; allows her to travel through the air like Mary Poppins.

Missy says her brooch contains a Gallifreyan Dark Star alloy pin, given to her by the Doctor which she uses to pierce a Dalek&#x27;s armoured shell. In &quot;The Doctor Falls,&quot; Missy uses a small blade concealed in her sleeve to stab her own past self, triggering his off-screen regeneration.

In &quot;Spyfall,&quot; the Tissue Compression Eliminator returns as the Master, having regained his manic state, reveals he used it to steal the identity of an ally of the Doctor. He also used it to bring the Doctor to his mercy by threatening to use it on people in 1834. In &quot;The Timeless Children,&quot; the Master threatens the Doctor&#x27;s human friends with it to get her to return to Gallifrey with him and later kills Ashad, the Lone Cyberman, with the Tissue Compression Eliminator. The Master used it again in &quot;The Power of the Doctor,&quot; revealing that the Tissue Compression Eliminator could work in reverse and unleashing a Cyberman army, including Ashad, encapsulated in a single miniaturised Cyberman.

== In other media ==
The Master has featured in numerous &quot;Doctor Who&quot; spin-offs. One of the most notable of these other appearances is David A. McIntee&#x27;s &quot;Master trilogy&quot; of novels comprising &quot;The Dark Path&quot; and &quot;First Frontier&quot; in the Virgin Publishing lines and &quot;The Face of the Enemy&quot; for BBC Books, and the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audio dramas produced by Big Finish Productions, in which various actors have reprised the role from the TV series or played original versions of the Master.

=== Novels ===
The Master&#x27;s past with the Doctor is explored in &quot;The Dark Path&quot;, which reveals that his name before taking the alias of the Master is Koschei, when he encounters the Second Doctor during their travels. Although initially a somewhat anti-heroic version of the Doctor, willing to murder to save the day but generally still trying to do the right, Koschei turns to evil and becomes the Master after he discovers that his companion and lover Ailla is an undercover agent of the Celestial Intervention Agency sent to spy on him. During the course of the novel, Ailla is shot and killed. Koschei, not knowing that she is a Time Lord and will simply regenerate, completes a time-based weapon to benefit the anti-alien efforts of soldiers from Earth&#x27;s Empire in an attempt to bring her back. The weapon is used to destroy the planet Teriliptus and its inhabitants. When Ailla turns up alive, the knowledge that he has destroyed a planet for nothing, coupled with the revelation of Ailla&#x27;s betrayal, proves too much. Koschei resolves to bring his own order to the universe at the expense of free will and becoming its Master. Thanks to the Doctor reprogramming his weapon, Koschei is trapped in a black hole at the end of the novel, with it being left uncertain how he will escape. The cover art of &quot;The Dark Path&quot; depicts Koschei as being already the same regeneration as the Delgado-era Master.

&quot;The Face of the Enemy&quot; centres around the Delgado-era Master, but includes a cameo by a Koschei from an alternate timeline (specifically, the timeline the Third Doctor visited in &quot;Inferno&quot;) who never became the Master. This version of Koschei is a loyal Time Lord who was stranded on the alternate Earth after that universe&#x27;s version of &quot;The Web of Fear&quot; destroyed his TARDIS. He is subsequently captured and forced to work for the fascist rulers, who keep him alive in agony using life support systems. When the Master, crossing over from the other universe, learns of this, he ends his counterpart&#x27;s life in a rare moment of compassion.

&quot;Last of the Gaderene&quot; by Mark Gatiss and &quot;Deadly Reunion&quot; by Terrance Dicks and Barry Letts are both close homages to the Delgado/Pertwee stories. In &quot;Last of the Gaderene&quot;, the Master, disguised as Police Inspector Lemaitre, assists an alien race called the Gaderene to invade Earth, starting with a small village. In &quot;Deadly Reunion&quot;, he attempts to control powerful forces through a cult, but finds himself at the mercy of a godlike alien. The Delgado Master also appears in &quot;Verdigris&quot; by Paul Magrs, a more parodic take on the Pertwee era. The eponymous genie spends much of the novel impersonating the Master, who is in fact controlling him: the real Master appears in the novel&#x27;s epilogue, buying a Chinese takeaway.

The reason the Master is so emaciated when he appears in &quot;The Deadly Assassin&quot; is explored in John Peel&#x27;s novel &quot;Legacy of the Daleks&quot;, in which he attempts to capture the Doctor&#x27;s granddaughter Susan Foreman, resulting in an out-of-sequence encounter with the Eighth Doctor when the Doctor receives a telepathic cry of distress from Susan and attempts to trace it back to before its origin. The Master is badly burned when she attacks him in self-defence and takes possession of his TARDIS. After Susan escapes, the dying Master is eventually found by Chancellor Goth on the planet Tersurus, which leads directly into the events of &quot;The Deadly Assassin&quot;.

The Ainley-era Master appears in the novel &quot;The Quantum Archangel&quot; by Craig Hinton, a direct sequel to &quot;The Time Monster&quot;. In this novel, he poses as a Serbian businessman called Gospodar (prompting the Sixth Doctor to wonder if he&#x27;s &quot;running out of languages&quot;) while attempting to subvert the power of the higher dimensions to turn himself into a god. However, it to be revealed that this plan was actually the result of the machinations of the Chronovore/Eternal hybrid Kronos trying to trick the Master into punishing the Chronovores for his lifetime of imprisonment, with one of the Master&#x27;s pawns being transformed into the titular Quantum Archangel when she absorbs the higher-dimensional energy as the Master tests his equipment. As the novel concludes, the Master briefly regresses to his crippled and burned form while the Doctor absorbs more of the excess energy to delay the Quantum Archangel on her level, but the story ends with the Master having restored himself to physical health with a boost of the last dregs of higher-dimensional power (although he is apparently subsequently attacked by a group of chronovores).

&quot;First Frontier&quot; shows the Master (apparently the Ainley version) finally acquiring a new body, who according to McIntee is based on the cinema persona of Basil Rathbone, using nanites provided by the alien race known as the Tzun in exchange for his help in setting up their &#x27;invasion&#x27; of Earth. This incarnation reappears in &quot;Happy Endings&quot; by Paul Cornell, Virgin Publishing&#x27;s celebratory fiftieth Virgin New Adventures novel, once again trying to restore his ability to regenerate, suggesting that the Tzun nanites failed to sustain him long-term.

Before the end of the Virgin Missing Adventures series, the Delgado version of the Master appears in the novel &quot;Who Killed Kennedy&quot;, depicting him setting up a complex plan to manipulate a journalist to bother UNIT by convincing him that they are part of a corrupt conspiracy. The novel, while published by Virgin, was not considered part of the Missing Adventures series.

Another version of the Master appears in &quot;The Infinity Doctors&quot; (also by Parkin), where he is known as the Magistrate and is, once again, the Doctor&#x27;s friend, although when this takes place in continuity is unclear. Parkin has stated that the novel can fit into continuity and that its incarnation of the Master is based on Richard E. Grant.

During the Faction Paradox arc that runs through the Eighth Doctor Adventures, a character known as the War King is featured, which is implied to be a future incarnation of the Master. The character is also referenced in &quot;The Book of the War&quot;, published by Mad Norwegian Press when the &quot;Faction Paradox&quot; stories spun off into their own continuity. Later Faction Paradox stories confirm the Magistrate is the younger version of the War King, which had been implied in &quot;The Taking of Planet 5&quot;.

Alastair Reynolds&#x27; novel &quot;Harvest of Time&quot;, published in 2013, features the Roger Delgado incarnation, set after his capture at the end of &quot;The Dæmons&quot; and before he escapes from prison in &quot;The Sea Devils&quot;. In the course of the novel, the Master is nearly erased from history by an ancient race known as the Sild, who have captured multiple incarnations of the Master to create a complex temporal manipulator by linking the Masters in a neural network, but the Doctor and the Master track the Sild to their origin, allowing the Master to take control of the Sild&#x27;s network and turn it against them before his other selves rebel against his control, forcing him to allow the other Masters to escape.

=== Comic strips ===
The &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; (DWM) 1992 Winter Special comic &quot;Flashback&quot; shows a young Master (here called &quot;Magnus&quot;) and Doctor on Gallifrey. The Master plans to use a living entity to harness Arton Energy, only for the Doctor to thwart his plans.

The Master returns in a new body and guise, that of a street preacher, in the previously mentioned the &quot;DWM&quot; comic strip story &quot;The Fallen&quot;, although the Doctor does not recognise him. The Master reveals himself a few stories later, in &quot;The Glorious Dead&quot;. The Master had survived the events of the television movie by encountering a cosmic being named Esterath in the time vortex. Esterath controls the Glory, the focal point of the Omniversal spectrum which underlies all existence. The Master&#x27;s scheme to take control of the Glory fails, and he is banished to parts unknown (see Kroton).

In &quot;Character Assassin&quot; in &quot;DWM&quot; No. 311, the Delgado Master visits the Land of Fiction and steals part of the technology behind it, wiping out several nineteenth century fictional villains as he goes. He can also be seen in the following comic strips set during the Pertwee era:
* &quot;The Glen of Sleeping&quot; by Gerry Haylock and Dick O&#x27;Neill (&quot;TV Action 107–111&quot;)
* &quot;Fogbound&quot; by Frank Langford (&quot;Doctor Who Holiday Special 1973&quot;)
* &quot;The Time Thief&quot; by Steve Livesey (&quot;Doctor Who Annual 1974&quot;)
* &quot;The Man in the Ion Mask&quot; by Brian Williamson and Dan Abnett (&quot;Doctor Who Magazine Winter Special 1991&quot;)

In the IDW publication &quot;Prisoners of Time&quot;, a 12-issue series to celebrate the 50th anniversary of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, the Master (drawn based on Ainley&#x27;s portrayal) plays a major part. He is the villain in issues 6 and 7, attempting to trap the Sixth Doctor in an Auton-staffed asylum and encountering the Seventh as he attempts to drain the energy from a pair of higher-dimensional beings. The Ainley Master is revealed to have teamed up with the Ninth Doctor&#x27;s disgraced ex-companion Adam Mitchell, who is traveling through time kidnapping the Doctor&#x27;s companions as revenge, the Master having presented himself as another &#x27;victim&#x27; of the Doctor rather than the villain he truly is. His role in the plan after Adam abducts Clara Oswald culminates in an out-of-sequence encounter with the Eleventh Doctor, the Doctor observing that it has been a pleasantly long time since he saw this version of the Master. However, when the Eleventh Doctor manages to summon his previous ten selves to Adam&#x27;s fortress to rescue their companions when Adam threatens to kill them all, the Master reveals that his true plan is to channel his stolen chronal energies through the Doctors&#x27; combined TARDISes, thus destroying the Universe. Horrified at the Master&#x27;s evil scale and encouraged to take action by Rose and the Ninth, Tenth, and Eleventh Doctors, Adam stands up to the Master, sacrificing himself to disable the Master&#x27;s equipment. The Master escapes, noting that he enjoyed the chance to cause further chaos, but his plan has been thwarted. This is the only story in any medium in which the Ninth and Eleventh Doctors encounter the Master.

2017 sees the return of Delgado&#x27;s incarnation in &quot;Doorway to Hell&quot;, a &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; comic strip printed in DWM #508–511, set after the events of &quot;Frontier in Space&quot; from the Master&#x27;s perspective. This depicts an out-of-sequence encounter between Delgado&#x27;s Master and the Twelfth Doctor in the year 1973, with the Master initially assuming that the Twelfth Doctor is the Fourth who regenerated after an explosion in the TARDIS that left the Doctor trapped on Earth in this time, until the Doctor informs his foe that he is from far in the Master&#x27;s future. At the story&#x27;s conclusion the critically wounded Master regenerates inside his TARDIS after the Doctor and the human family he has been living with deflects an attack with the &quot;artron energy&quot; the family absorbed while the Doctor&#x27;s TARDIS was healing in their garden.

Titan Comics published a series of comics which included a Master who was a contemporary of the War Doctor. This Master has the appearance of a young boy. In his final appearance, he regenerated into the Derek Jacobi incarnation seen in &quot;Utopia&quot;.

=== Audio plays ===

The Master has made regular appearances in various audio plays produced by Big Finish. Geoffrey Beevers, Derek Jacobi, Michelle Gomez, Eric Roberts, John Simm and Sacha Dhawan have all reprised the role from the television series, while Mark Gatiss, Alex Macqueen, Gina McKee, James Dreyfus and Milo Parker portray versions of the Master original to Big Finish. Jon Culshaw has performed as the Roger Delgado and Anthony Ainley incarnations of the Master.

The Master appears in the Big Finish Productions &quot;Dust Breeding&quot;, where Geoffrey Beevers reprised the role. The story reveals that at some point after &quot;Survival&quot;, the Master&#x27;s Trakenite body is damaged when he attempts to take control of a psychic weapon trapped in the painting &quot;The Scream&quot;, which returns him to his walking corpse state once again. He is presented using the alias Mr Seta, another anagram of Master.

In &quot;Master&quot;, the origin of the Master and the Doctor&#x27;s enmity is explored. As children, a school bully attempted to drown the Master but was killed by the Doctor in defence. Unable to cope with the guilt and grief, the young Doctor made a deal with Death to take away his pain, inadvertently transferring the memories and guilt of the murder to the Master. In the main plot, the Seventh Doctor (Sylvester McCoy) has made another deal with Death to remove the Master&#x27;s memory and let him live in peace for ten years, in exchange for the Master then becoming Death&#x27;s Champion. Upon learning this, the Master absolves the Doctor of his actions as a child before having his memories restored and becoming Death&#x27;s servant once again.

An alternate-universe Master appears in the Big Finish audio play &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot;, voiced by Mark Gatiss, as part of the &quot;Doctor Who Unbound&quot; series. In this version of events, an alternate Third Doctor—now voiced by David Warner—does not arrive for his exile on Earth until 1997. Without the Doctor&#x27;s help, UNIT was unable to cope with a series of extraterrestrial disasters, and the political landscape of the planet changed drastically. Stranded on Earth, the Master worked as an advisor to the United Nations. This version of the Master later appears in Big Finish&#x27;s &quot;The New Adventures of Bernice Summerfield&quot; range, opposite Warner&#x27;s Doctor, when Bernice Summerfield is temporarily pulled into the &quot;Unbound&quot; universe. He later escapes to Benny&#x27;s universe and is recruited by the Daleks to stop a plan by his main universe counterpart that threatens to destroy the universe. Another alternate version of the Master, played by Beevers, appeared opposite Colin Baker&#x27;s alternate Doctor (known as The Warrior) in the &quot;Doctor Who Unbound&quot; duology—&quot;Doctor of War&quot;.

The Master was set to appear in the television story &quot;The Hollows of Time&quot;, proposed for the show&#x27;s 23rd season but ultimately never produced. When Big Finish adapted the story for their Lost Stories range, while Colin Baker and Nicola Bryant voiced their original roles as the Sixth Doctor and Peri, rights to the Master could not be obtained (and Anthony Ainley had died), so the role of Professor Stream (originally meant as the Master&#x27;s alias—another anagram) was played by David Garfield and left ambiguous as to his true identity, the story presented as a semi-flashback with the Doctor and Peri&#x27;s memories distorted so that they cannot clearly recall certain key details.

The Master, played by Geoffrey Beevers, returns in the Fourth Doctor audio plays &quot;Trail of the White Worm&quot;, &quot;The Oseidon Adventure&quot;, &quot;The Evil One&quot;, &quot;Requiem for the Rocket Men&quot; and &quot;Death Match&quot;. Beevers also appears in the fiftieth anniversary story &quot;The Light at the End&quot;, where he attempts to erase the Doctor&#x27;s travels by using an advanced weapon to erase the TARDIS from existence, and in the Companion Chronicle &quot;Mastermind&quot;, which looks at how he stole a new body in the early twentieth century after his essence escaped from the Eighth Doctor&#x27;s TARDIS, and survived by possessing a series of human hosts until he tricked UNIT into helping him regain access to his TARDIS.

Alex Macqueen plays a new incarnation of the Master – existing after Eric Roberts&#x27; incarnation (and the subsequent corpse form played by Beevers) – in the Seventh Doctor release &quot;&quot; pretending to be a future version of the Doctor before his true identity is revealed. He goes on to become a recurring antagonist in the Eighth Doctor&#x27;s &quot;Dark Eyes&quot; series where it is explained that the Time Lords resurrected the Master to fight in an approaching conflict, implied to be the Time War. The events surrounding the Master&#x27;s resurrection were depicted in the &quot;Ravenous&quot; series five years later.

Chris Finney plays a character named &#x27;Keith Potter&#x27; in the story &quot;The End of the Line&quot; from the audio anthology &quot;The Sixth Doctor: The Last Adventure&quot;, later revealed to be an avatar under the control of the Master.

The Master, played again by Geoffrey Beevers, makes a cameo appearance in series 10 of the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; spin-off &quot;Jago &amp; Litefoot&quot;, and later featured as the main villain for the eleventh series.

To mark forty-five years since the Master&#x27;s first appearance, Big Finish released a trilogy of stories featuring the Geoffrey Beevers and Alex Macqueen incarnations of the Master in 2016. &quot;And You Will Obey Me&quot; features the Beevers Master encountering the Fifth Doctor, while &quot;Vampire of the Mind&quot; pits the Sixth Doctor against Macqueen&#x27;s Master. In both stories, the two Masters are characterized very differently from their previous appearances. In the final story of the trilogy – &quot;The Two Masters&quot; – it is explained that the two Masters swapped bodies after the Macqueen Master went back in time and caused the event that gave the Beevers Master his emaciated corpse form. This results in a universe-destroying paradox fixed by the Seventh Doctor, returning the two Masters to their rightful bodies and erasing their memories of the events.

In December 2017, Derek Jacobi reprised his role as the Master for &quot;The War Master&quot;, an ongoing series of audios set during the Time War, having originally appeared in the 2007 episode &quot;Utopia&quot;. The first series ends with the Master using a chameleon arch to turn himself into an infant human, setting up the events of &quot;Utopia&quot;. Subsequent series occur earlier in the War Master&#x27;s life and depict him getting involved with various battles in the Time War, sometimes at the behest of the Time Lords and sometimes for his own ends. Mark Gatiss made a guest appearance as the alternate-universe Master in series four and Paul McGann briefly plays the Master in series five. In the tenth volume—&quot;Rogue Encounters&quot;—Jacobi plays Professor Yana, the Master&#x27;s human alter-ego seen in &quot;Utopia&quot;. Jacobi has also appeared as the War Master in several other Big Finish ranges, including &quot;UNIT: Cyber-Reality&quot; and the first volume of &quot;Gallifrey: Time War&quot;.

James Dreyfus portrays an early incarnation of the Master opposite David Bradley as the First Doctor in &quot;Doctor Who: The First Doctor Adventures&quot;. Dreyfus also appears in the Second Doctor audio &quot;The Home Guard&quot;, the Fourth Doctor audio &quot;Solo&quot; (in the story &quot;Blood of the Time Lords&quot;) and the Seventh Doctor audio &quot;The Psychic Circus&quot;.

In May 2018, it was announced that the fifth series of &quot;The Diary of River Song&quot; would feature the title character, River Song, encountering four incarnations of the Master. As well as Beevers and Jacobi returning, this release saw Eric Roberts and Michelle Gomez make their Big Finish debuts as their incarnations of the Master. This release explains how the Master (Roberts) was able to escape the Eye of Harmony, stuck in the time vortex until River&#x27;s intervention enables him to escape back into the universe.

Like Jacobi, Michelle Gomez also performs her incarnation of the Master (renamed Missy) for an ongoing audio series. &quot;Missy&quot; premiered in February 2019 and featured The Monk played by Rufus Hound. The second series introduced a character known as The Lumiat – revealed to be the next incarnation of The Master, the immediate successor to Missy – played by Gina McKee. It is explained that, after her &quot;poetic&quot; death at the hands of her predecessor, Missy used an Elysian field to rebuild her body at a cellular level, triggering a regeneration. Motivated by her recent attempt at redemption, she used the field to remove all negative aspects of her personality from her reconstructed body and became a benevolent force in the universe, adopting the title Lumiat. Missy encounters the Lumiat trying to undo some of her earlier incarnation&#x27;s evil deeds. Sickened by her future self, Missy kills the Lumiat and abandons her to regenerate, implying the process might cause them to return to evil. In the third volume, Gomez and Hound were joined by Gemma Whelan as the Meddling Nun – another incarnation of the Monk. A fourth volume was released in May 2024.

Gomez returned for a story in Big Finish&#x27;s &quot;The Eighth of March&quot; range, which saw Missy stranded in Earth&#x27;s past and threatening a young Amy Pond (Caitlin Blackwood) in a bid to get the Doctor&#x27;s attention. Marking the 60th anniversary of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, Gomez and McKee reprised their roles as Missy and The Lumiat respectively in separate stories of the &quot;Once and Future&quot; series. Gomez appears in &quot;The Martian Invasion of Planetoid 50&quot; and McKee in &quot;Time Lord Immemorial&quot;.

Beevers, Jacobi, Roberts, and Gomez appeared in the fourth volume of the Eighth Doctor series &quot;Ravenous&quot; in October 2019. In &quot;Planet of Dust&quot;, the Doctor and his companions encounter the Burnt Master (Beevers) on the planet Parrak, where it is explained that he has once again returned to his emaciated corpse form following his time in the body of Bruce (Roberts) before being killed by the Ravenous. In &quot;Day of the Master&quot;, the Eighth Doctor encounters the Bruce Master. At the same time, his companions Liv Chenka and Helen Sinclair are confronted by the War Master (Jacobi) and Missy (Gomez), respectively, although Helen does not realise that the Time Lady she met is the Master, the Doctor speculating (without meeting Missy himself) that she is actually a new incarnation of the Rani. By the end of the story, the War Master, Missy, and the Bruce Master are sent by the Time Lords to the tomb where the Burnt Master is buried, using technology acquired earlier in the story to grant him a new regeneration cycle and, it is implied, turning him into the Alex Macqueen incarnation of the Master. The story also suggests the Bruce Master has his memory wiped and is flung into the time vortex by his future selves, ultimately leading him back to Parrak in his Burnt Master form to preserve the timeline.

As part of the &quot;Time Lord Victorious&quot; multi-platform storyline, a pair of Short Trips stories introduced the Roger Delgado and Anthony Ainley incarnations of the Master to Big Finish – &quot;Master Thief&quot; by Fio Trethewey and &quot;Lesser Evils&quot; by Simon Guerrier were released in October 2020 with Jon Culshaw serving as narrator and voicing both incarnations of the Master.

In January 2021, to mark the fiftieth anniversary of the Master&#x27;s first television appearance, Big Finish released &quot;Masterful&quot;, a three-part special written by James Goss uniting every living television and audio incarnation of the Master (other than Sacha Dhawan due to licensing). It saw John Simm reprise his role as the Harold Saxon version of the Master and introduced Milo Parker as a young incarnation of the Master. Beevers, Gatiss, Jacobi, Macqueen, Roberts, and Gomez all reprised their roles. Gina McKee makes a cameo appearance as the Lumiat and Jon Culshaw voices Kamelion impersonating the Ainley Master. In the story, the Saxon Master has killed the Doctor and taken control of the universe using an entropy wave that has destabilized his body and threatens to destroy the universe. He summons his previous selves in an attempt to steal their lives and heal himself. The intervention of Missy, the alternate-universe Master and Jo Grant thwarts Saxon&#x27;s plans and, after discovering that the entropy wave is a sentient manifestation of the Master from the future – their final incarnation, a being of pure rage and insanity – the War Master kills his other incarnations (including himself) to cause a paradox and return the universe to normal. The special edition release included an original audiobook &quot;Terror of the Master&quot; written by Trevor Baxendale, narrated by Jon Culshaw and featuring the Delgado Master and the Third Doctor. This story was given a standalone re-release in March 2023.

Roberts returned as the Master once again in March 2021 for a three-part special release entitled &quot;Master!&quot;, featuring Chase Masterson as Vienna Salvatore. Following the events of &quot;Ravenous&quot;, the Master is rescued from the vortex by a scientist named Lila Kreeg (Laura Aikman) – whom the Master had manipulated using a psychic link into freeing him – and steals the identity of a business magnate on twenty-third century Earth. Vienna is hired by the Daleks to assassinate the Master but, with Kreeg&#x27;s help, succeeds only in sending the Master back into the time vortex. Masterson and Roberts returned for a second series—&quot;Nemesis Express&quot;—released in October 2022 and a third—&quot;Planet Doom&quot;—in February 2024.

At Big Finish Day 2022, it was announced that Sacha Dhawan would reprise the role of The Master from the television series for a new audio series, &quot;Call Me Master&quot;.

Eric Saward included Anthony Ainley&#x27;s incarnation of the Master in his short story, &quot;Birth of a Renegade,&quot; in the &quot;Doctor Who 20th Anniversary Special&quot; one-off magazine, published by &quot;Radio Times&quot; (and in the United States by Starlog Press) in 1983.

In &quot;The Feast of the Stone,&quot; a short story by Cavan Scott and Mark Wright that follows on from the Scream of the Shalka, the story pivots around the nature of the android version of the Master, his reality as an extension of the reality of the TARDIS, and his relationship with the Doctor.

The Master is seen to escape the Eye of Harmony in the short story &quot;Forgotten&quot; by Joseph Lidster, published in &quot;Short Trips: The Centenarian&quot;. The story ends with him left in 1906 in possession of a human male&#x27;s body.

Martha Jones&#x27; year long journey across a Master-controlled planet Earth is detailed in the short story collection &quot;The Story of Martha&quot;, which was released on 26 December 2008.

In the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; short eBook &quot;The Spear of Destiny&quot; by Marcus Sedgwick, featuring the Third Doctor, the Master disguises himself as a Viking called Frey (Old Norse for Master) and tries to take the Spear of Destiny.

=== Webcasts ===
In 2003, an android version of the character (resembling the Delgado version of the Master and voiced by Derek Jacobi) appeared in the animated webcast &quot;Scream of the Shalka&quot;. This version of the Master exists as a companion to the Doctor, albeit a slightly sinister one. Exactly why the Doctor created an android duplicate of the Master is not stated, but it is revealed the Master was faced with the choice of permanent death or one last chance at life on a leash to make amends for the harm he had caused over the years. This version&#x27;s Master possesses weak psychic abilities, and is able to pilot the Doctor&#x27;s TARDIS but physically unable to leave the ship.

To promote the audio series &quot;Master!&quot;, Eric Roberts reprised the role of the Master onscreen for the first time since 1996 in a series of video prequels posted to social media by Big Finish Productions; starting with a Halloween-themed video in November 2020 and subsequent Christmas and Valentine&#x27;s Day messages. In the final message, the Master is heard calling out to &quot;Lila,&quot; a character from the audio series that the Master manipulates into granting his freedom from the vortex.

=== Audio book ===
* &quot;The Killing Stone&quot; (BBV Audio, read by Richard Franklin)

=== Computer game ===
* &quot;Doctor Who: Destiny of the Doctors&quot;, played by Ainley. This was his last performance as the Master before his death.
* &quot;Lego Dimensions&quot;, featuring a Lego version of Missy voiced by Gomez.

=== Role playing game ===
The &quot;Doctor Who&quot; role-playing game published by FASA in 1985 has two modules outlining the Master&#x27;s personal history, a timeline of his activities, and an inventory of much of the equipment he has obtained during his travels. Most notably, the modules identify the Meddling Monk as an alias the Master has used in his early attempts to alter the history of Earth.

=== Board game ===
The 1980 board game &quot;Doctor Who: The Game of Time &amp; Space&quot; features information on the characters within the game.
Of note, it states that &quot;The Monk,&quot; The War Chief and the Master are all the same person.

=== Parody ===
In the Comic Relief sketch &quot;The Curse of Fatal Death&quot;, the Master was played by Jonathan Pryce.

===Stage===
Alex Macqueen appeared as The Master on stage for a live recording of the Big Finish audio play &quot;The Stuff of Legend&quot;, written by Robert Valentine. Four performances took place over Saturday 14th and Sunday 15th September 2024 at Cadogan Hall in London. A version of the story recorded in studio was released on the day of the first performance and a &quot;live&quot; version, combining recordings from all four performances, was released in December 2024.

<text>The Royal Canadian Institute for Science (RCIScience), known also as the Royal Canadian Institute, is a Canadian nonprofit organization dedicated to connecting the public with Canadian science.

==History==
The organization was formed in Toronto as the Canadian Institute on June 20, 1849, by Sandford Fleming, Kivas Tully, and Hamilton Hartley Killaly. It was conceived of originally as an organization for surveyors, civil engineers, and architects practising in and about Toronto, Ontario. It quickly became more general in its scientific interests.

A royal charter was granted on November 4, 1851, in which the objects of the organization are declared to be &quot;the encouragement and general advancement of the physical sciences, the arts and the manufactures&quot;. It is now the oldest scientific society in Canada.

==Presidents==
Notable past presidents include John Charles Fields (1919–1925; founder of the Fields Medal), William Edmond Logan, Daniel Wilson, John Henry Lefroy, John Beverley Robinson, George William Allan, William Henry Draper, Oliver Mowat and Henry Holmes Croft.

==Museum==
Its first museum collection consisted mostly of archaeological and ethnographic items from native groups in Canada. Its first curator was David Boyle. During 1896, needing more room for the museum, the collection was transferred to the Toronto Normal School (The Museum of Natural History and Fine Arts or Ontario Provincial Museum); Boyle cared for it until his death during 1911. Its collection was later transferred to the Royal Ontario Museum.

==Journal==
The Institute regularly published a journal, &#x27;the Canadian Journal&#x27;, by various titles 1852–1878, as Proceedings 1879–1890 and later Transactions 1890–1969. &#x27;Early Days of the Canadian Institute&#x27; by Sandford Fleming was published during 1899. The Royal Canadian Institute Centennial Volume, published in 1949, summarizes one hundred years of science in Canada and the history of the Royal Canadian Institute, 1849–1949. Since 2018, RCIScience has published an annual magazine for the public, featuring interviews and articles with scientists across Canada.

==Activities==
RCIScience first started hosting public lectures on the University of Toronto campus starting in 1913. Since then, RCIScience has expanded its activities to include in-person and online events, and novel initiatives such as Science is a Drag (winner of the Special Award for Inclusive Science Engagement at the 2022 Falling Walls Summit Science Breakthrough of the Year, Science Engagement category. In 2021, RCIScience received the NSERC Award for Science Promotion which honours individuals and groups who make an outstanding contribution to the promotion of science in Canada through activities encouraging popular interest in science or developing science abilities 

==Awards==
Every year since 1982, RCIScience has awarded the Sandford Fleming Award to a Canadian who has made major contributions to the public understanding of science. The Sir William Edmond Logan Award was created in 2015 as a companion to the Fleming Medal to recognize the contribution that an organization (rather than an individual) has made to increasing science culture in Canada through communication of science. It is presented to an organization operating in Canada that demonstrates continued passion, aptitude and expertise in science communication to the public.

<doc id="155604" wikidata="Q634152" url="?curid=155604" title="La Conquête de Plassans">
<text> (1874) is the fourth novel in Émile Zola&#x27;s twenty-volume series Les Rougon-Macquart. In many ways a sequel to the first novel in the cycle, (1871), this novel is again centred on the fictional Provençal town of Plassans and its plot revolves around a sinister cleric&#x27;s attempt at political intrigue with disastrous consequences for some of the townsfolk.

At the start of the novel, the home life of Francois Mouret and his wife and cousin Marthe (née Rougon) is portrayed as a generally pleasant and relaxed existence. Francois is slightly compulsive in his behaviour and Marthe clearly suffers from some sort of mental illness, which Zola intended to portray as a genetic consequence of the Rougon-Macquart family&#x27;s tangled ancestry. Their three children include the eldest son Octave, an intelligent but feckless ladies&#x27; man (featured as the principal character of two later novels in the cycle, &quot;Pot-Bouille&quot; (1882) and (1883), but here little more than a footnote), as well as the quiet and introverted younger son Serge and the mentally handicapped daughter Desirée. Their home lives are shattered by the arrival of a strange cleric, Abbé Faujas, and his mother, who rent a room in the Mourets&#x27; house. Slowly, it transpires that the mysterious stranger has arrived to try to win influence in the town for outside political forces (which never manifest themselves) through a series of Machiavellian intrigues, plots, slanders and insinuations; in the process of doing so, he proceeds to unravel the Mourets&#x27; lives to such an extent that the bewildered Francois is unwillingly and unnecessarily committed to a mental institution, while poor Marthe becomes obsessively religious, though whether her devotion is to God or Faujas becomes increasingly unclear. In Mouret&#x27;s absence, and Marthe&#x27;s indifference, Faujas unscrupulous sister Olympe and brother in law Trouche take over the Mouret&#x27;s house, and live high at their expense. The reaction of the townsfolk to Faujas&#x27; outside influence is fascinatingly drawn by Zola, and the tactics of the groups who are in &quot;resistance&quot; to Abbé Faujas&#x27; clever machinations are very keenly observed. The narrative is kept up at a tremendous pace and builds to a quite astonishing climax of violence and horror as Zola ends the novel in a near-apocalyptic fury.

Although the novel does assume in its readers a degree of familiarity with the battle between clerical political interests and governmental influence in the provincial towns of the Second Empire - knowledge which Zola&#x27;s contemporary readers would certainly have taken for granted, but which seems obscure and almost arcane now - its strength lies not in its politics but in its human drama. On the face of it this could have been a relatively dull series of political observations, but instead by the end it is almost a melodrama, such is the anticlerical fury which Zola instils in his work.

The English translation done by Ernest Vizetelly in the 1880s, still in print under the title &quot;The Conquest of Plassans&quot;, is much more readable than many of the other Vizetelly texts. A more modern retranslation was undertaken by Brian Rhys for Elek Books and published in 1957 under the more expressive but less faithful title &quot;A Priest in the House&quot;, but it is no longer widely available. The 2014 translation by Helen Constantine was published by Oxford World Classics.

<text>Ma Ying-jeou (; pinyin: &quot;Mǎ Yīngjiǔ&quot;; ; born 13 July 1950) is a Taiwanese politician, lawyer, and legal scholar who served as the 6th president of the Republic of China from 2008 to 2016. A member of the Kuomintang (KMT), he was previously the mayor of Taipei from 1998 to 2006 and the chairman of the Kuomintang from 2005 to 2007 and from 2009 to 2014.

Ma was born in British Hong Kong to a &quot;waishengren&quot; family that moved to Taiwan in 1952. After graduating from National Taiwan University, Ma joined the Republic of China Marine Corps and attained the rank of lieutenant before studying law in the United States, where he earned a master&#x27;s degree from New York University in 1976 and his doctorate from Harvard University in 1981. Ma then returned to Taiwan and began working for President Chiang Ching-kuo as a bureau director and English translator at the Presidential Office Building in Taipei. 

From 1988 to 1996, Ma held office first as chair of the Research, Development and Evaluation Commission, becoming the youngest cabinet member in the ROC at age 38, and then as head of the Ministry of Justice, where he launched anti-corruption and anti-drug campaigns. In the 1998 Taipei mayoral election, he successfully ran against incumbent Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). During his mayoralty, he was elected as KMT chairman in 2005 and left the position in 2007 to announce his candidacy in the 2008 Taiwanese presidential election, eventually defeating DPP nominee Frank Hsieh in a landslide majority of 58.45 percent.

Ma&#x27;s presidency was defined by closer cross-strait relations with mainland China. He initiated a series of cross-strait summits (2008–2015) with the mainland, was elected again as party chairman in 2009, and signed the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement with the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) in 2010. After defeating Tsai Ing-wen and being re-elected in the 2012 presidential election, Ma&#x27;s second term saw the September 2013 power struggle and the Sunflower Student Movement protests damage party reputation in the 2014 elections, leading to his resignation as KMT chair. Subsequently, he held the 2015 Ma–Xi meeting in Singapore, marking the first meeting between the leaders of the PRC and ROC since the Chinese Civil War. After leaving the presidency in 2016, Ma became a law professor at Soochow University and has remained active in KMT politics. 

==Early life and education==

=== Youth and baptism ===
Ma was born in Kwong Wah Hospital in Yau Ma Tei in Kowloon (then part of British Hong Kong) on 13 July 1950. In a family of five children, Ma was the fourth child and the only son. Their ancestral home was in Fufeng, Shaanxi Province, and Ma&#x27;s ancestors had migrated from Shaanxi to Jiangxi and then finally to Hunan. His mother was Chin Hou-hsiu (1922–2013). His father, Ma Ho-ling, was born in Xiangtan and had joined the Kuomintang and its youth army in 1941. Ho-ling moved to Taiwan during the 1949 Kuomintang retreat but briefly returned to mainland China, where he eventually moved from Chongqing to Hong Kong. In October 1951, Ho-ling once again moved his family to Taiwan, where he worked as a mid-rank Kuomintang official.

Ma is of Hakka ancestry and speaks Hakka Chinese. He was a one year old infant when the family moved to Taiwan. Since the family was Catholic, he was raised in the Catholic faith. While growing up in Taiwan in the 1950s, Ma attended Catholic services and went with his grandmother every Sunday to Catholic mass and confession. At age eight, he was baptised a Catholic at a Catholic Church in Hong Kong. He also received a baptism at Resurrection church on Dali Street in Taipei near the Huaxi Street Night Market.

Because he was the family&#x27;s only son, Ma was pressured to succeed academically by his father, who insisted that he study the Chinese classics, master Chinese calligraphy, and practice track and field. In 1966, while a high school student, Ma decided to study law in college after being advised by his father to pursue a career similar to that of diplomat Wellington Koo. After graduating from Taipei Municipal Chien Kuo High School, he joined the KMT in June 1968 and became a young activist for the party. He passed with high marks on the General Scholastic Ability Test and entered National Taiwan University (NTU) in September 1968 to study law.

=== College and law school ===
As an undergraduate student at NTU, Ma was the leader of a small KMT student group, became secretary-general of the university&#x27;s student council, and encountered the &quot;baodiao&quot; movement. In his third year at the university, he was selected by the United States Department of State to travel to the U.S. as a student leader for its International Visitors Program and stayed in the country for 70 days from January 1971 to March 1971. Ma traveled to Honolulu, Hawaii, and resided with an American family in San Francisco for three weeks. He visited 20 universities, including the University of Chicago, Harvard University, Georgetown University, and the University of Texas at Austin. Upon returning to Taiwan, he led student groups at NTU to march to the American Institute in Taiwan and the Japan–Taiwan Exchange Association in Taipei in protest of Japanese involvement in the Senkaku Islands dispute.

In 1972, Ma graduated with a Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.) degree from National Taiwan University. After graduation, he was conscripted into the Republic of China Marine Corps of the ROC Navy and was stationed at the Naval Logistics Command in Zuoying District. After serving two years in the navy, Ma was awarded the KMT&#x27;s Sun Yat-sen Scholarship in 1974 to complete graduate studies in the United States, first at New York University (NYU) and then at Harvard University. In 1976, he earned his Master of Laws (LL.M.) degree specializing in international law from the New York University School of Law, where he studied public international law under professor Thomas M. Franck and aviation law under professor Andreas Lowenfeld. George Zeitlin, the associate dean at NYU, recognized Ma at graduation for an &quot;outstanding academic record and performance&quot;.

Upon completing his master&#x27;s degree at NYU, Ma enrolled in Harvard Law School as a doctoral student studying under professors Louis B. Sohn, Jerome A. Cohen, and Harold J. Berman. He also did research under Judge Richard Reeve Baxter of the International Court of Justice. While at Harvard, he was classmates with Taiwanese vice-president Annette Lu in 1978, diplomat Stephen Orlins, and legal scholar William Alford. Although Lu and Ma were not on speaking terms, Cohen, who was Ma&#x27;s teacher and Lu&#x27;s advisor, recalled in 2006 that Ma &quot;was a brilliant student&quot; and that both he and Lu were &quot;entitled to be there&quot;.

In 1981, Ma received his Doctor of Juridical Science (S.J.D.) in ocean law and international economic law from Harvard. As he completed his doctorate, Ma attended congressional hearings at the U.S. Congress and served as the editor-in-chief of &quot;Free Chinese Monthly&quot;, an anti-communist Chinese magazine published in Boston. His doctoral thesis, completed in December 1980, was titled &quot;Trouble over Oily Waters: legal problems of seabed boundaries and foreign investment in the East China Sea&quot; and was supervised by Sohn and Detlev F. Vagts. The dissertation analyzed the Sino-Japanese sovereignty conflicts over the Senkaku Islands. 

==Rise in politics==
After earning his doctorate, Ma worked as an associate for a Wall Street law firm in New York City and as a legal consultant for a major bank in Massachusetts in the U.S. Ma also spent time doing research at the University of Maryland School of Law and published some academic papers. In 1981, Ma returned to Taiwan and started working for President Chiang Ching-kuo. That same year, he became an adjunct associate professor of law at National Chengchi University, a role he remained in until 1998.

In the 1980s Ma Ying-jeou started working for President Chiang Ching-kuo as Deputy Director of the First Bureau of the Presidential Office and the President&#x27;s English interpreter. Ma was later promoted to the chair of the Research, Development and Evaluation Commission under the Executive Yuan at the age of 38, becoming the youngest cabinet member in the ROC government.

Ma was deputy secretary-general of the KMT from 1984 to 1988, also serving for a period as deputy of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), a cabinet-level body in charge of Cross-Strait relations. President Lee Teng-hui appointed him as Justice Minister in 1993. Ma was relieved of his post in 1996. His supporters claim that firing was caused by his efforts at fighting corruption among politicians and the police. He remained a supporter of the Kuomintang, rather than supporting the New Party formed by KMT supporters who campaigned on an anti-corruption platform. Ma returned to academia and most people at the time believed his political career to have effectively ended.

==Mayoralty==

In 1998, the KMT fielded Ma to challenge the then-incumbent Taipei mayor Chen Shui-bian of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), who was seeking re-election. Despite Chen&#x27;s public approval rating of around 70%, he was defeated.

In the 2000 presidential election, Ma remained loyal to the KMT and supported its candidate, Lien Chan, over James Soong, who had bolted from the party and was running as an independent. The competition between Lien and Soong split the Pan-Blue vote and allowed his former rival Chen to win the presidential election with less than 50% of the popular vote. The election result, combined with other factors, incited a great deal of anger against Ma when he tried to dissuade discontented Lien and Soong supporters from protesting by appealing to them in his dual capacities as Taipei City mayor and a high-ranking KMT member.

Ma was able to repair the political damage and, in December 2002, became the leading figure in the KMT by easily winning reelection as mayor of Taipei with the support of 64% of Taipei voters while DPP challenger Lee Ying-yuan received 36%. His solid victory, especially in light of opposition from both President Chen and former President and KMT chairman Lee Teng-hui, led many to speculate about his chances as the KMT candidate for the 2004 presidential elections, although nothing came of it.

Ma again dissuaded angry Pan-Blue supporters from protesting, following the very close re-election victory of President Chen in 2004 after the 3–19 shooting incident. Ma chose not to join in calls to challenge or contest the election. Ma also avoided associating himself with claims that the assassination was staged.

Ma suffered some political damage as a result of the SARS epidemic in early 2003 and was criticized for not mobilizing the Taipei city government quickly enough and for keeping Chiu Shu-ti, the public health director, who was previously criticized for her lack of concern for the outbreak. Flooding in metropolitan Taipei in 2004 also led to public questioning of his leadership and caused Ma&#x27;s approval rating to slide.

During his time as Taipei&#x27;s mayor, Ma had many conflicts with the central government over matters such as health insurance rates and control of the water supply during the drought. Ma also was implicated in a scandal of Taipei Bank stock releases in 2003. However, the case was dismissed after an investigation by the Taipei prosecutor. He was strongly criticized by the DPP for not allowing the ROC national flag to be flown along with a PRC flag during Asian Women&#x27;s Football Championship held in Taipei. Ma responded that he was merely following Olympic protocol, which only officially recognizes the Chinese Taipei Olympic flag and forbids ROC national flags from being shown in an Olympic Game Stadium.

His initiatives in administering the city of Taipei include changing the transliterations of street names and the line and stations of the Taipei Metro to Hanyu Pinyin, as opposed to Tongyong Pinyin. Ma has expressed mild support for Chinese unification and opposition to the Taiwan independence movement. He opposed the 2004 Taiwanese cross-Strait relations referendum, which had been widely criticized by the U.S. and PRC. Nevertheless, his opposition to the Anti-Secession Law of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, while other leaders of his party remained silent on the issue, led to him being banned from visiting Hong Kong to make a public speaking tour in 2005. He also criticized the PRC for the Tiananmen crackdown.

===Mayoral controversies===
While often nicknamed as the &quot;Teflon pot&quot; for his extreme preservation of his personal image, Ma was nonetheless caught in some political controversies. A series of mishaps during his tenure as the mayor of Taipei, including the administration problems that enlarged the extent of the Typhoon Nari (納莉風災), the shutdown of Hoping Hospital (和平封院事件), the Phosgene Incident (捷運光氣事件), the Scalping Incident (捷運扯頭皮事件) and the Human Ball Scandal (邱小妹人球事件) (in which a severely beaten four-year-old girl was bounced from hospital to hospital without treatment, until she died of her injuries), impaired Ma&#x27;s reputation. 

One of Ma&#x27;s most satisfactory mayoral constructions was the Maokong Gondola. However, the frequent breakdown of the gondola earned the residents&#x27; distrust of the new transportation system. One poll showed only 14% of the Taipei City residents were satisfied with it, and it even led to protests. The Taiwan Environmental Information Center (台灣環境資訊協會) states that the choice to use a gondola lift intended for temperate zones in a tropical zone shows the failure of the Taipei City government led by Ma.

===Corruption allegations===
On 14 November 2006, Ma was questioned by prosecutors over his alleged misuse of a special expenses account as Taipei mayor. This occurred after Chen Shui-Bian was being investigated for corruption, and many KMT supporters believed that this prosecution was politically motivated.

At the same time, rumors surfaced that former party chairman Lien Chan would run in the presidential election of 2008. The incident may have affected the clean image of Ma and his political future. The next day, Ma admitted one of his aides forged receipts to claim Ma&#x27;s expenses as Taipei mayor, and apologized for the latest political scandal. However, Ma argued that he, like most other government officials, regarded the special expense account as supplemental salary for personal expenses undertaken in the course of official duties and that his use of this account was legal.

On 13 February 2007, Ma was indicted by the Taiwan High Prosecutors Office on charges of allegedly embezzling approximately NT$11 million (US$339,000), regarding the issue of &quot;special expenses&quot; while he was mayor of Taipei. The prosecutor&#x27;s office said that Ma had allegedly used government funds for personal use, such as paying for one of his daughter&#x27;s living expenses while studying abroad and paying for his household utilities. Before that, Ma had admitted personal usage and claims that the special funds were simply a part of his salary but had used all funds for public use or public benefit (charity donations).

Shortly after the indictment, he submitted his resignation as chairman of the Kuomintang in accordance with party rules which prohibit an indicted person from serving as KMT chairman The resignation was initially rejected but then accepted by the party&#x27;s Central Standing Committee before amending a clause that barred members from running for office if charged with a crime. Shortly after the resignation, however, Ma announced his presidential candidacy.

On 14 August 2007, the Taipei District Court found Ma not guilty of corruption. Ma&#x27;s defense is that he viewed &quot;Special Expenses&quot; as essentially &quot;Special Allowance&quot;, originally designed to compensate for mayor&#x27;s &quot;social spending&quot; without actually raising salary. On 28 December 2007, the Taiwan High Court found Ma again not guilty of graft charges.

On 24 April 2008, the Supreme Court cleared Ma of corruption charges, delivering a final ruling in this matter before his inauguration on 20 May 2008. The island&#x27;s highest court said Ma had neither collected illegal income nor tried to break the law. Ma&#x27;s secretary, however, was found guilty and faced a year in prison for his own failures in administrative duties.

==KMT chairmanship==

Ma&#x27;s prestige increased after the loss by Lien Chan in the 2004 Taiwanese presidential election, as he is widely seen as the successor of Lien Chan. His handling of the post-election demonstrations of the Pan-Blue Coalition, in which he at one point sent riot police to control the demonstrations of his pan-blue party supporters, was generally seen as impartial. In 2005, Ma and Wang Jin-pyng were candidates in the first competitive election for KMT chairmanship. On 5 April 2005, in an exclusive interview with CTV talk show host Sisy Chen, Ma said he wished to lead the opposition Kuomintang with Wang, if he were elected its chairman, as their support bases are complementary.

On 16 July 2005, Ma defeated Wang by a 72% to 28% margin, a margin larger than anticipated by either camp or news sources, despite Wang receiving a last-minute endorsement by the People First Party (PFP) chairman James Soong, who had retained significant following within the KMT. Some, particularly the supporters of Wang Jin-pyng, accuse Ma of unfairly implying that Wang is involved in &quot;black gold&quot; and criticized Ma&#x27;s aides for being rude to Wang during the campaign. After the election, Ma had stated repeatedly that he wishes Wang to remain as first-ranked deputy chairman. Wang, however, has so far rebuffed the gesture, instead stating that he wishes to serve as a &quot;permanent volunteer.&quot; Wang has, indeed, accepted a party post that is incompatible with vice chairmanship, effectively ending the possibility that he would be vice chairman, although after meeting with Wang, Ma had stated that he would &quot;leave the position open&quot; for Wang. Ma has also repeatedly stated that he had no plans to resign from the Taipei mayorship, even after he formally took over the chairmanship from incumbent Lien Chan during the 17th Party Congress of the KMT in August 2005.

Led by Ma Ying-jeou, the Kuomintang made a resounding win in the three-in-one election held on 3 December 2005. The KMT gained six more seats in the mayoral/magistratical race, from eight seats in the last election, to a total of fourteen seats. Before the election, Ma swore that he would quit the chairmanship if his party could not win over half of the seats, which was a first for a KMT chairman. It was a decisive win for Ma Ying-jeou as well, since he took over the party chairmanship only 110 days before. In the election, the KMT won back the counties of Taipei and Yilan, and the city of Chiayi, which had been the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)&#x27;s strongholds for over twenty years. It was the first time in many years that the KMT regained popularity as far south as Cho-Shui River (Zhuoshui River).

== Presidential campaigns ==

=== 2008 ===
On the same day he resigned as chairman of the KMT, Ma also announced his intention to run in the 2008 presidential election. He was the official nominee of the Kuomintang for the 2008 presidential election.

Ma visited India and Singapore in June 2007 to increase bilateral exchanges as well as to gain legitimacy and experience for his 2008 presidential bid.

Ma&#x27;s vice-presidential running mate was former premier Vincent Siew, Lien Chan&#x27;s running mate in the 2000 presidential election.

During a campaigning event in an aboriginal community, Ma made a controversial remark. Responding to a question from an aboriginal woman, Ma said, &quot;If you come into the city, you are a Taipei citizen... Aborigines should adjust their mentality – if you come into the city you have to play by its rules.&quot; This statement was thought to be extremely inappropriate.

====U.S. green card issue====
Democratic Progressive Party candidate Frank Hsieh questioned Ma for his possession of a US green card. Ma denied having one and publicly expressed that no members of his family had one. However, the fact that Ma and his wife had applied for green cards and that his sisters and his elder daughter Lesley Weichung Ma are United States citizens caused controversy, as the DPP continued to question Ma&#x27;s loyalty to the country. In response to the DPP attack on the US citizenship of his sisters and daughter, Ma commented that having a US passport or green card did not necessarily mean that someone was not loyal to Taiwan.

A week before the presidential election, incumbent President Chen Shui-bian vowed to quit if Ma could provide legal documents of the invalidation of his green card. Frank Hsieh also said that he was willing to withdraw from the race if Ma could prove, using official documents, that his green card was invalidated twenty years ago. Ma responded the next day to the president that he should work on improving Taiwan&#x27;s economy instead of caring about the election so much; earlier, Ma also provided copies of US non-immigrant visas issued to him during the 1980s and 1990s, claiming the card was invalid, as such visas are not issued to green card holders.

===2012===
Ma was eligible for a second term as president and ran for re-election. In June 2011, when incumbent Vice President Vincent Siew announced he will retire and not seek a second term, Premier Wu Den-yih was chosen to replace Siew on the KMT&#x27;s 2012 ticket. Ma was re-elected President with 51.6% of the vote against Democratic Progressive Party chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen.

==Presidency==

===Inauguration===

Ma officially won on 22 March 2008 with 58% of the vote, ending eight years of DPP rule and becoming officially recognized as the sixth president of the Republic of China. Ma won with 7,659,014 votes against Hsieh&#x27;s 5,444,949 votes. Ma&#x27;s overwhelming victory in the presidential election gave him political mandate to make changes in Taiwan.

Ma took office on 20 May 2008. The inaugural ceremony took place in the Taipei Arena in Taipei. A state dinner took place in Kaohsiung the same day.

Ma was named among the 2008 Time 100 in its &quot;Leaders &amp; Revolutionaries&quot; section. He is described by &quot;Time&quot; as &quot;one of those rare politicians who have an opportunity to shape the destiny not only of their own nation but also of an entire region&quot;.

On 12 August 2008, Ma embarked on his first foreign trip as president. Ma&#x27;s visit centered upon improving relations with Taiwan&#x27;s Latin American allies. He attended the inaugurations of both Leonel Fernández of the Dominican Republic and Fernando Lugo of Paraguay. Ma also made a stop at Panama and met with President Martín Torrijos. There was an emphasis that there would be no new aid packages during the visits; if any new economic aid were to be announced, they would be announced from Taiwan and not from abroad. The trip included U.S. stop-overs in Los Angeles, Austin, and San Francisco. Ma&#x27;s trip across the Pacific was via commercial flight and only chartered a smaller jet from the United States; he was accompanied by an 81-member delegation.

===Cross-strait relations===

After his success in the presidential election, Ma Ying-jeou said he had no immediate plans to visit mainland China and would work to fulfill his campaign pledge to improve relations with mainland China, starting direct charter flights, allowing mainland Chinese tourists to visit Taiwan and lifting the ROC&#x27;s legislative restrictions on the financial sector to invest in mainland China. Ma, in his inaugural address, laid out his promise in dealing with cross-strait relations that there would be &quot;no reunification, no independence, and no war&quot; () during his tenure as president. Critics argue that Ma, rather than follow his campaign promise, has been following his father&#x27;s will instead, where Ma Ho-ling clearly states his final words were &quot;Repress independence supporters; Lead (Taiwan) to unification.&quot; During an interview in England in 2006, Ma affirmed that his goal was to lead Taiwan to &quot;eventual unification&quot;.

An article published in the 11 August 2008 edition of the &quot;Time&quot; magazine said that in less than three months&#x27; time, &quot;relations between Taiwan and PRC have arguably seen the most rapid advancement in the six-decade standoff between the two governments. Ma launched direct weekend charter flights between PRC and Taiwan for the first time, opened Taiwan to mainland Chinese tourists, eased restrictions on Taiwan investment in mainland China and approved measures that will allow mainland Chinese investors to buy Taiwan stocks.&quot; He has also loosened bans on &quot;Chinese brides,&quot; leading to social unrest over Chinese women who marry old veterans but file for divorce after they obtain citizenship.

During the Second Chen–Chiang summit visit by Chen Yunlin on 3 November 2008, chairman of the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARAT), the opposition Pan-Green Coalition criticized the visit as &quot;taking steps toward eventual reunification&quot; and damaging Taiwan&#x27;s sovereignty. Opposition to the visit by the chairman of the ARAT also sparked massive peaceful rallies and protests organised by the opposition DPP party on 25 October 2008. Preliminary estimates place the number of protesters at around 500,000. Protesters accused Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou &quot;of making too many concessions and moving too fast in relaxing restrictions on trade and investment with China.&quot; Government&#x27;s polls have suggested that Chen Yunlin&#x27;s visit and the government&#x27;s policy of normalising cross-strait relations have support of 50% to 60% of the Taiwanese population.

Chen&#x27;s visit was the highest level visit from mainland China to Taiwan that had taken place since the Chinese Civil War in 1949. Chen was expected to meet with his Taipei-based counterpart, Chiang Pin-kung beginning on 4 November 2008. The two sides signed four agreements on 5 November, detailing the loosening of restrictions with regards to air, marine, and postal links as well as better regulations on food safety. The Ma government refused to disclose the treaties only until days before they went into effect.

During Chen&#x27;s visit in Taipei, he was met with a series of strong protests directed at himself and Ma Ying-jeou, some of which were violent, with Molotov cocktails being thrown by the protesters at riot police. A series of arrests were made after the protests, with a secret letter being sent from the police to a member of the media. Local police reported that 149 of its officers were injured during the opposition protests. Chen referred to Ma simply as &quot;Mr. Ma,&quot; not as &quot;President&quot;. However, this is consistent with the previous convention in 2008, when KMT ex-politician Lien Chan met PRC leader Hu Jintao in Peru. Lien did not call Hu Jintao &quot;President,&quot; but instead used his title &quot;General Secretary&quot; as the leader of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the top position in PRC government.

After the chaos during and after Chen&#x27;s visit, college students and professors launched a peaceful sitout, known as the Wild Strawberry student movement (), demanding a more reasonable assembly law and a stop to police violence. A few days into the sitout, the prime minister Liu Chao-shiuan accidentally spoke of his opinion during an interview on air that he did not think the movement would last more than three days, angering students, professors, and the general public. In the end, the sitout lasted one month. Then, it moved into an organizational direction. However, the polls in two of Taiwan&#x27;s biggest newspapers after the visit still reported that about 70% of the Taiwanese public considered Chen&#x27;s visit to have a positive effect on Taiwan&#x27;s development, while 22% of the respondents thought the effect would be negative, with the remaining 8% not expressing an opinion. The Pan-Green caucus have continuously alleged this result being a form of media manipulation by the KMT. However, other major polls in Taiwanese newspapers and news websites have shown similar results regardless of political alignment.

A free trade agreement with China was signed in 2010 called the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA), which was accompanied by a debate and protests. Ma attempted to pass the Cross-Strait Service Trade Agreement in his second term, building on the ECFA. This sparked the Sunflower Student Movement, initiated by a coalition of students and civic groups in the Legislative Yuan and later also the Executive Yuan. On 26 September 2014, a student protester hurled the book &quot;Formosa Betrayed&quot; at Ma and hit the president, who was not hurt by the incident. The Presidential Office condemned the act of violence.
On 7 November 2015, Ma met and shook hands with the Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping in Singapore within their capacity as &quot;Leader of Taiwan&quot; and &quot;Leader of Mainland China&quot; respectively. The meeting marked the first ever meeting between leaders of both sides since the end of Chinese Civil War in 1949. Both leaders addressed each other using the honorific &quot;xiānshēng&quot; (Chinese: , &quot;Mister&quot;).

====Direct links policy====
On 15 December 2008, Taiwan and the Chinese mainland resumed direct sea, air, and mail links, ending an almost six-decade-long ban between the two sides on such trips. Previous flights between the two regions required a connection in Hong Kong. As many as 108 flights per week as well as 60 cargo flights per month were scheduled, evenly divided between Taiwanese and mainland Chinese airlines.

Shipping companies, due to shorter voyages and time savings, are able to save up to US$120 million (TWD $4 billion) each year. Previously, shipping companies from both sides of the strait were required to reroute their ships into third-country waters. The two sides also agreed that neither the ROC nor the PRC flag will be displayed when a ship enters port.

In July 2009, Ma rejected the proposal to open the airspace of the Taiwan Strait to accommodate higher passenger traffic, citing that the Taiwan Strait airspace is important to Taiwanese security.

===Economic issues===

One of Ma&#x27;s promises as presidential candidate was called the &quot;633 Plan&quot;, which promised economic growth rate of 6%, unemployment rate of less than 3%, and per capita income of more than US$30,000. At the time, the high unemployment rate (~4.06% in July) and consumer price index three months after Ma&#x27;s inauguration were unprecedented, having not been seen in 28 years.

The economic downturn caused about 2,000 companies in Taiwan to go bankrupt in the six months following Ma&#x27;s inauguration, according to a governmental commercial office in Taipei. The Taiwan Stock Exchange also fell to two-year lows in September 2008.

On 11 September 2008, Ma&#x27;s cabinet unveiled a $5.6-billion USD ($180-billion TWD) economic stimulus package. Among the items of the package were infrastructure projects, economic incentives to small businesses, and other tax cuts. Stock transaction taxes were also halved for the next six months. Taiwan&#x27;s economy was projected to grow 4.3% in 2008, down from 5.7 in 2007, according to Fitch Ratings.

Although an economic stimulus plan was introduced, Taiwan stocks still closed lower on 11 September 2008. The Financial Times describes Taiwan&#x27;s economic downturn as results from &quot;downward pressure driven by global factors&quot;. Analysts also point out that, &quot;during its first 100 days in office, the government has made a series of bold steps to deregulate economic Cross-Strait ties. But as these policies coincided with the global downturn and foreign investors had already bought Taiwan stocks heavily before the election, betting on the reforms, the island&#x27;s market has seen a sell-off worse than the regional average.&quot; Taiwan&#x27;s government reported that the economy contracted 8.36 percent during the last three months of 2008. Taiwan&#x27;s economy rebounded by growing 10% in 2010.

===Bid for KMT leadership===
Ma Ying-jeou registered as the sole candidate for the election of the KMT chairman on 25 June 2009 and won the next day with 93.87% of the vote. Ma inaugurated as the chairman of the Kuomintang on 12 September 2009. This would have allowed Ma to be able to meet with People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) paramount leader Hu Jintao (at the time the CCP general secretary) and other PRC delegates, as he would be able to represent the KMT as the leader of a Chinese political party, rather than as head-of-state of a political entity unrecognized by the PRC. Ma, however, ruled out meeting his PRC counterpart Hu Jintao in a 14 July 2009 interview with Taiwan&#x27;s Commercial Times newspaper. In the interview, Ma states, &quot;A meeting in the capacity of a party chairman will not solve the problem because other people would still insist that I meet him as the president.&quot;

===Typhoon Morakot===

Typhoon Morakot, the worst typhoon to strike Taiwan in fifty years, hit Taiwan on 8 August 2009. In the storm&#x27;s aftermath, President Ma was criticized for his handling of the disaster by both sides of Taiwan&#x27;s political spectrum. Many news outlets likened Typhoon Morakot to being Ma&#x27;s &quot;Hurricane Katrina.&quot; Editorials and political commentators accused Ma of, among other charges, poor leadership and poor crisis management. Many critics believe that hundreds of lives could have been spared, had the Ma administration been aware of the typhoon&#x27;s seriousness. Taiwan&#x27;s political commentators were most critical of Ma&#x27;s refusal to declare a state of emergency and fully mobilize the military. Instead, Ma Ying-jeou blamed the local governments, which were under the control of the DPP in Southern Taiwan, for not having the villagers evacuated earlier. Ma&#x27;s approval ratings sank from 52% (in May) to 29% in a United Daily News poll. In an August 2009 CNN online poll, 82% of respondents wanted Ma to resign. 

Following pressure from the opposition, Ma took steps to publicly apologize for his government&#x27;s failure to respond swiftly with rescue and recovery efforts. Ma cancelled 2009&#x27;s Double Ten Day national celebrations and his state visit to the Solomon Islands for the Third Taiwan-South Pacific summit. A probe was launched to investigate why government response was slow and inadequate, and vice foreign minister Andrew Hsia tendered his resignation to Ma&#x27;s premier, Liu Chao-shiuan. Defense minister Chen Chao-min also resigned before Liu himself stepped down.

Another controversy arose in the disaster&#x27;s aftermath involved a document leaked from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that instructed the ROC embassies and representative offices to turn down aid from foreign nations. Vice Foreign Minister Andrew Hsia made an explanation, saying that it was meant to say &quot;presently&quot; foreign aids were not needed, but nevertheless took the blame and offered to resign. However, critics were convinced that Hsia&#x27;s resignation was only to cover-up the fact that Ma gave the order to turn down foreign aid.
==Post-presidency==

On 1 June 2016, it was announced that Ma planned to visit Hong Kong on 15 June to attend the 2016 Award for Editorial Excellence dinner at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre and would deliver a speech on Cross-Strait relations and East Asia. The Tsai Ing-wen administration blocked Ma from traveling to Hong Kong, and he gave prepared remarks via teleconference instead.

In August 2016, Soochow University confirmed that Ma had rejoined the faculty as a lecturer. On 26 September 2016, Ma gave his first lecture which was about the history of Taiwan. Yet, as a chair professor of law, Ma was protested by students at Soochow University to ask for his resignation since he has repeatedly controversial legal opinions.On 11 October 2016, Ma&#x27;s office announced that he had accepted an invitation to attend and become one of the speakers at the World Chinese Economic Summit in Malacca, Malaysia which would take place on 16–17 November 2016.

In October 2017, a court ruled in Ma&#x27;s favor in a defamation case he had brought against Liang Wen-chieh (梁文傑) of the Democratic Progressive Party in 2011, after Liang had claimed on TV that Ma had received NT$300 million in illegal political donations during a meeting with Chen Ying-chu (). The court ordered Liang to pay NT$1.2 million (US$39,643).

In 2023, Ma became the first ROC leader to visit mainland China since the civil war of 1949, with a trip slated for 27 March to 7 April, pledging peace between the two countries. Ma&#x27;s party, the Kuomintang has sat in opposition since the 2016 elections. The trip comes amidst rising tension between mainland China and Taiwan.

==Family==
Ma&#x27;s father is Ma Ho-ling and his mother is Chin Hou-hsiu (). Ma is an alleged descendant of Ma Chao. Researchers purportedly visited the old residence of Ma&#x27;s father, in Kaiyun Town, Hengshan County, Hunan, where they discovered a genealogy book stating that Ma descended from Ma Chao.

Ma married Christine Mei-ching in 1977, and the couple has two daughters. Lesley (Ma Wei-chung, ) was born in 1981 in New York City while Ma was attending Harvard. She completed her undergraduate studies in life sciences at Harvard University and then her graduate studies at New York University. Ma&#x27;s youngest daughter, Ma Yuan-chung, was born in Taiwan and completed her master&#x27;s degree at the London School of Economics and pursued a doctorate at Nanyang Technological University.

Ma and his wife sponsor children of low-income families in El Salvador through World Vision International. On an official trip to Central America in June 2009, Mrs. Ma was able to meet with one of her sponsored children, an 11-year-old boy in San Salvador.

Ma is the uncle of Gene Yu, an American, former United States Army Special Forces captain and the author of the &quot;Yellow Green Beret: Stories of an Asian-American Stumbling Around U.S. Army Special Forces&quot; series of books. Yu was instrumental in negotiating, locating and working to free Taiwanese citizen Chang An-wei from Abu Sayyaf militants with Filipino special forces and private security contractors in 2013.

Ma speaks Taiwanese Hokkien, Hunanese (his ancestral native dialect), Mandarin (national language) as well as English fluently.

==Political positions==
===View on independence===

In February 2006, while visiting Europe, Ma said that although he and the KMT favor eventual unification, the KMT respects the opinions of Taiwanese people and independence is a choice for the people of Taiwan. This caused widespread criticism within the party and from the PRC. In a December 2005 Newsweek International interview, when asked about unification, Ma stated that &quot;for our party, the eventual goal is reunification, but we don&#x27;t have a timetable.&quot; Perhaps to deflect heavy criticism from the Pan-Green Coalition, the KMT later published an advertisement in the &quot;Liberty Times&quot; recognizing that independence is an option for the Taiwanese people. Wang Jin-pyng praised Ma for the policy shift, since Wang himself made a similar statement during the 2004 election, but James Soong said he was &quot;shocked&quot; and Lien Chan said he was never consulted. This event actually won some welcome voices from Southern Taiwan, where voters customarily favor the Pan-Green Coalition. One top KMT official said &quot;we might as well let the measles out now so that we will be immune to it when election year comes close, because reunification or independence can be a hot topic by then&quot;.

Ma clarified later that the current KMT policy of retaining the status quo has not changed and has reiterated this position several times; further, he has also reiterated his party&#x27;s support of the one-China policy. Ma has defined the status quo as the &quot;Five No&#x27;s.&quot; During a visit to the United States in March 2006, he proposed a &quot;proactive&quot; approach to cross-strait relations which he called the &quot;Five Do&#x27;s.&quot;

On 17 March 2008, Ma threatened to boycott the Beijing Olympics if elected, should the Tibetan unrest spiral out of control. After he was elected president, he refused to let the Dalai Lama visit Taiwan, citing the timing as inappropriate. He later approved a visit by the Dalai Lama to lead prayers for Typhoon Morakot victims in August 2009.

In April 2009, President Ma became the first ROC president to pay homage in person to the Yellow Emperor who is believed to have founded China as a nation more than 5,000 years ago. Accompanied by all his government leaders, the president sang the ROC&#x27;s national anthem as the starter. Ma&#x27;s spokesman said the president wanted to pay his respects to the Yellow Emperor on National Tomb-Sweeping Day in person to stress the importance of the Chinese ancestor-worshipping tradition. However, others saw the precedent-making ceremonies at the Martyrs&#x27; Shrine as meant to be a show by President Ma of his unprofessed commitment to maintain a close relationship between Taiwan and mainland China. During his time at the tomb of the Yellow Emperor, Ma said that most Taiwanese people have a strong belief in Chinese culture and national identity.

===Cross-strait relations===
Ma Ying-jeou has emphasized the &quot;1992 Consensus&quot; as the existing basis for constructive dialogue and exchange between mainland China and Taiwan. On 12 April 2008, then Vice-President-elect Vincent Siew formally met with CCP General Secretary Hu Jintao at the Boao Forum in Hainan.

On 2 September 2008, Ma declared that the relations between Taiwan and mainland China were a &quot;special relationship not between two nations&quot;, but one that can be handled invoking the &quot;1992 consensus&quot; between the two sides. While the governing authorities on mainland China and Taiwan cannot recognise each other as a legitimate government due to legal and constitutional reasons, Ma seeks that they would refrain from denying the other side being the &quot;de facto&quot; governing authority of one area of the state. On 18 October 2008, Ma said he hoped that a cross-strait peace accord could be reached during his term in office.

Ma has received criticism from the DPP, the opposition party, for allegedly praising the PRC on human rights, especially during the 20th anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre. Departing from his usual critical view of the Communists&#x27; handling of the 1989 protests, Ma made a statement about the PRC&#x27;s recent improvements in human rights. That same day, he also asked the PRC government to face its history directly and honestly. In June 2009, Ma also postponed an appointment with Wang Dan, a student leader in Tiananmen, three times and eventually cancelled the appointment with Wang. In a press meeting with DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen, Wang Dan spoke of how it has become more difficult to see &quot;President Ma&quot; in comparison to &quot;Mayor Ma of Taipei City.&quot; Wang stated that he understood the importance of the cross strait relationship to Taiwan&#x27;s economy but also stated that a confident government should have nothing to be afraid of.

Within a week of his remarks on Tiananmen, Ma voiced support for the acceptance of simplified Chinese for written text and the continued use of traditional Chinese for printed text. Ma had to clarify his remarks regarding simplified characters at a 15-minute speech before the sixth International Conference on Internet Chinese Education on 19 June 2009. Ma reiterated his policy of urging the Chinese to learn the traditional system; his previous call was for the ability of Taiwan&#x27;s population to recognize simplified characters and not for simplified characters to supplant the traditional system in Taiwan. In a 2004 speech hosted by Microsoft Taiwan, he had proposed for traditional Chinese characters (; literally: complicated characters) to be instead called &#x27;orthodox characters&#x27; () (then the translation &#x27;traditional Chinese characters&#x27; would be more appropriate as well).

In 2009, Ma spoke at a leadership conference in Taipei and called for peace with Beijing and for Taiwan&#x27;s greater participation in international affairs. He said: &quot;The Chinese civil war of the 1940s must never happen again. Peace never comes easily, because over 1,000 missiles deployed by Beijing are still aimed at Taiwan.&quot; In 2014, Ma received the Eisenhower Medallion from People to People International for his efforts in the East China Sea Peace Initiative, set up to mediate territorial disputes.

<text>Finbar Patrick &quot;Barry&quot; McGuigan MBE (born 28 February 1961) is an Irish boxing promoter and former professional boxer. Born in Clones, County Monaghan, McGuigan was nicknamed &quot;The Clones Cyclone&quot; and held the WBA and lineal featherweight titles from 1985 to 1986. At regional level he also held the British and European featherweight titles between 1983 and 1985. In 1985, McGuigan became BBC Sports Personality of the Year. In 2005, he was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame.

==Background==

Barry McGuigan was born in Clones, County Monaghan, Ireland. His father was singer Pat McGuigan (died 1987). Pat McGuigan sang &quot;Danny Boy&quot; before several of his son&#x27;s matches. This inspired the Hacienda Brothers&#x27; song &quot;If Daddy Don&#x27;t Sing Danny Boy&quot;, written by boxer and musician Chris Gaffney.

As an amateur, McGuigan represented Northern Ireland in the Commonwealth Games at Edmonton in 1978 and represented Ireland at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. He became a UK citizen so that he could compete for British titles.

During his professional career, McGuigan fought at a number of venues in Ireland and Britain. He attracted an enormous following in the mid-1980s, particularly to the King&#x27;s Hall in Belfast which he regularly filled to capacity. McGuigan is a Roman Catholic, and at a time when Catholics and Protestants were clashing during The Troubles, he married a Protestant, Sandra Mealiff. As of 2010, they remain married after over three decades.

McGuigan stated that the support he received from both Protestants and Catholics in Ireland was because:&quot;[the] shadows ran deep. And my fights felt a little like sunshine. Both sides would say: &#x27;Leave the fighting to McGuigan.&#x27; You see, it was also entertainment – people loved to forget the Troubles a while. The fact that I wouldn&#x27;t wear green, white and gold or put on a sign that said this is who I represent was powerful. It was a very mature and dangerous thing to do. I wouldn&#x27;t choose sides. People appreciated that.&quot; He and his wife have both been patrons for children&#x27;s cancer charity CLIC Sargent.

==Amateur career==

McGuigan began his juvenile boxing career at the Wattlebridge Amateur Boxing Club, County Fermanagh, and later moved to the Smithborough Amateur Boxing Club, County Monaghan. Under the guidance of trainers Danny McEntee and Frank Mulligan, he rapidly established himself as an exceptional boxer. He won the All Ireland Amateur Championship in 1976 having defeated Martin Brereton. Notable opponents during his teenage years included Dubliner James Coughlan, whom he defeated at the age of 15, and Gordon McNeil (of Heaton, Newcastle upon Tyne) and Eric Clarke (of Hackney, London).

McGuigan represented Northern Ireland in the Commonwealth Games at Edmonton 1978 and represented Ireland at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow.

===1980 Olympic results===

Barry McGuigan competed at the 1980 Moscow Olympics as a featherweight; his record was:

* Round of 32: defeated Issack Mabushi (Tanzania) referee stopped contest in third round
* Round of 16: lost to Winfred Kabunda (Zambia) by decision, 1-4

==Professional career==

McGuigan began his professional boxing career on 10 May 1981, beating Selvin Bell by technical knockout (TKO) in two rounds in Dublin. After another win, he suffered his first setback, losing a hotly disputed decision to Peter Eubank (brother of Chris Eubank) over eight rounds at Corn Exchange at the Brighton Dome. After his first loss, McGuigan notched up two more wins, including one over Terry Pizzarro, and then he was given a rematch with Eubank. The second time around, McGuigan prevailed, by a knockout in the eighth round.

In 1982, McGuigan won eight fights, seven by knockout, but one of these almost destroyed his career and his life. Fighting Young Ali, on 14 June 1982, McGuigan won by a knockout in six rounds; Ali fell into a coma and died two days later. According to the book &quot;The Ring: Boxing The 20th Century&quot;. Ali&#x27;s death affected McGuigan so much that he was not sure he wanted to carry on as a boxer. He also defeated Paul Huggins and Angelo Licata during this period. In 1983, he won four fights, earning the British Title against Vernon Penprase. This period marked his first trip to fight outside Europe (when he beat Lavon McGowan by a knockout in the first round in Chicago), before he got his first try at a European title.

On 16 November, Italy&#x27;s Valerio Nati boxed McGuigan for the vacant European Featherweight title in Belfast. McGuigan won the crown with a knockout in the sixth round. He then became the number one featherweight challenger for the WBA. In 1984, he won six bouts, all by knockout. Among the fighters he beat were former world title challengers Jose Caba and Felipe Orozco. McGuigan also overcame contenders Paul DeVorce and Charm Chiteule, retained his British and European titles against Clyde Ruan, and held on to the latter belt against Esteban Eguia to keep alive his chances of a world title fight.

In 1985, McGuigan met former world featherweight champion Juan Laporte and won by a decision after ten rounds. Following one more win (a defence of his European title against Farid Gallouze), McGuigan finally earned a tilt at a world title. Long-reigning WBA featherweight champion, Eusebio Pedroza of Panama, put his title on the line at Loftus Road football stadium in London. McGuigan became the champion by dropping Pedroza in round seven and winning a unanimous fifteen-round decision in a fight refereed by hall of fame referee Stanley Christodoulou. McGuigan and his wife were feted in a public reception through the streets of Belfast that attracted hundreds of thousands of well-wishers. Later that year, he was named BBC Sports Personality of the Year, becoming the first person not born in the United Kingdom to win the award.

McGuigan made his first defences against American Bernard Taylor, who was stopped in the ninth round, and Danilo Cabrera, who was knocked out in fourteen rounds. This proved to be a controversial stoppage: the fight was ended when the challenger bent over to pick up his mouthpiece after losing it, a practice that is allowed in many countries but not in Ireland. Cabrera was not aware of this rule and the fight was stopped. Although Cabrera&#x27;s corner protested the outcome, McGuigan remained the winner by a knockout. For his next defence, he went to Las Vegas in June 1986, where he faced relatively unknown Steve Cruz from Texas as a late replacement for Ramon Fernando Sosa who pulled out for having two detached retinas. It proved to be a gruelling fifteen-round title bout under a blazing late-afternoon sun and 110-degree heat in the ring. McGuigan held the lead halfway through, but suffered dehydration because of the extreme heat and wilted near the end, being knocked down in rounds ten and fifteen. He eventually lost a close decision and his world belt, which he was never to reclaim. After the fight, McGuigan required hospitalisation because of his dehydrated state.

After that fight McGuigan retired partly due to the death of his father in 1987. WIth his relationship with previous manager Barney Eastwood at an end, McGuigan returned to the ring between 1988 and 1989, under the management of Frank Warren. He beat former world title challengers Nicky Perez and Francisco Tomas da Cruz, and contender Julio César Miranda, before facing former EBU featherweight champ and future WBC and WBA super featherweight challenger Jim McDonnell. McGuigan lost by TKO when a gash over his right eye, caused by a McDonnell left hook in the second round, forced the referee to stop the fight in the fourth. McGuigan then retired permanently from boxing. His record was 32 wins and 3 losses, with 28 victories by knockout.

McGuigan is the founder and president of the Professional Boxing Association (PBA). He is also the founder and CEO of Cyclone Promotions.
==Professional boxing record==


==After boxing==

McGuigan attempted to establish an association to protect the rights of boxers against what he, and others, considered omnipotent managers and promoters. In this regard, McGuigan maintains he had had a difficult time during his own career. A previously very close relationship with his manager, Barney Eastwood, deteriorated badly over time and led to a successful libel case against him by Eastwood several years later. He participated in &quot;The Grand Knockout Tournament&quot; 1987 charity event television special. In the 1980s, he was a chat show host on BBC1.

McGuigan lives near Whitstable, Kent, with his wife. He currently works as a boxing pundit for Sky TV. Two biographies of McGuigan have been written. He is currently a boxing manager and promoter through Cyclone Promotions. McGuigan&#x27;s relationship with world champion, Carl Frampton, whom he managed and promoted, ended in 2017. The matter was finally settled out of court in November 2020. McGuigan&#x27;s daughter, Nika, died in 2019 aged 33.

He is the Chairman of the Professional Boxing Association, an organisation he has wanted to set up for over a decade, with the intention of teaching boxers the importance of education, and indeed educating them.

McGuigan has tried his hand at acting, appearing in the movie &quot;Malicious Intent&quot; in 2000. He also served as referee on the UK television game show &quot;Grudge Match&quot;, hosted by Nick Weir. He appeared in the third series of ITV&#x27;s &quot;Hell&#x27;s Kitchen&quot; in September 2007, where he was eventually crowned the winner after winning the public vote. In August 2009, he co-presented &quot;Charity Lords of the Ring&quot; with Lucy Kennedy.

On 15 August 2009, McGuigan went on The Weakest Link

On 3 January 2024, Cyclone Promotions Ltd and McGuigan&#x27;s Gym Ltd, of which McGuigan was a director, passed into liquidation.

McGuigan is credited as appearing in the film One Night in Millstreet.

In November 2024, McGuigan appeared as a contestant on the twenty-fourth series of &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot; and was the fifth contestant to be eliminated, finishing in eighth place.

==Other recognition==

McGuigan was inducted into the World Boxing Hall of Fame in 2000 and International Boxing Hall of Fame in 2005. He also fought in &quot;Ring Magazine&quot;&#x27;s 1986 Fight of the Year, and was a title character in the 8-bit computer game, Barry McGuigan World Championship Boxing. McGuigan was honoured in an Irish ballad song released in 1984, &quot;Clones Cyclone&quot;, written by Johnny McCauley and sung by Big Tom. The popular German musician and composer Udo Lindenberg also dedicated his song &quot;Jonny Boxer&quot; to McGuigan in 1986. The Bournemouth-based band The Worry Dolls named a track &quot;Barry McGuigan&quot; on their album, &quot;The Man That Time Forgot&quot;. 

McGuigan was the subject of a comedy record by Dermot Morgan, &#x27;Thank You Very Much Mr Eastwood&#x27;, in which Morgan impersonated him and his habit of thanking his manager and family in post-fight interviews. The record reached number one in the Irish singles charts in December 1985. 

He was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 1994. McGuigan is a dual citizen of both Ireland and the United Kingdom.

<text>Christopher William Bradshaw Isherwood (26 August 1904 – 4 January 1986) was an Anglo-American novelist, playwright, screenwriter, autobiographer, and diarist. His best-known works include &quot;Goodbye to Berlin&quot; (1939), a semi-autobiographical novel which inspired the musical &quot;Cabaret&quot; (1966); &quot;A Single Man&quot; (1964), adapted into a film directed by Tom Ford in 2009; and &quot;Christopher and His Kind&quot; (1976), a memoir which &quot;carried him into the heart of the Gay Liberation movement&quot;.

== Biography ==
=== Early life and work ===
Isherwood was born in 1904 on his family&#x27;s estate in Cheshire near Stockport in the north-west of England. He was the elder son of Francis Edward Bradshaw Isherwood (1869–1915), known as Frank, a professional soldier in the York and Lancaster Regiment, and Kathleen Bradshaw Isherwood, née Machell Smith (1868–1960), the only daughter of a successful wine merchant. He was the grandson of John Henry Isherwood, squire of Marple Hall and Wyberslegh Hall, Cheshire, and he included among his ancestors the Puritan judge John Bradshaw, who signed the death warrant of King Charles I and served for two years as Lord President of the Council, effectively President of the English Republic. 

Isherwood&#x27;s father Frank was educated at the University of Cambridge and Sandhurst Military Academy, fought in the Boer War, and was killed in the First World War. Isherwood&#x27;s mother, Kathleen, was, through her own mother, a member of the wealthy Greene brewing family of Greene King, and Isherwood was a third cousin of the novelist Graham Greene, who was also related to the brewing family. Frank and Kathleen christened their first son Christopher William Bradshaw Isherwood, which Isherwood simplified on becoming a United States citizen in 1946. Christopher was enrolled at St. Edmund&#x27;s school, Hindhead, Surrey beginning in 1914, where he met W. H. Auden who became a life-long friend and colleague and left for Repton in 1918.
At Repton, his boarding school in Derbyshire, Isherwood met his lifelong friend Edward Upward, with whom he invented an imaginary English village called Mortmere, as related in his fictional autobiography, &quot;Lions and Shadows&quot; (1938). He went up to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, as a history scholar, wrote jokes and limericks on his second year Tripos and was asked to leave without a degree in 1925.

At Christmas 1925, he was reintroduced to a prep school friend, W. H. Auden. Through Auden, Isherwood met the younger poet Stephen Spender, who printed Auden&#x27;s first collection, &quot;Poems&quot; (1928). Upward, Isherwood, Auden, and Spender were identified as the most exciting new literary group in England in the 1930s. Auden dubbed Isherwood the novelist in what came to be known as the Auden Group or Auden Generation. With Cecil Day-Lewis and Louis MacNeice, Auden and Spender later attracted the name the MacSpaunday Poets, with which Isherwood is also associated.

After leaving Cambridge, Isherwood worked as a private tutor and later as secretary to a string quartet led by the violinist André Mangeot while he completed his first novel. This was &quot;All the Conspirators&quot;, published in 1928, about the struggle for self-determination between children and their parents. In October 1928, Isherwood enrolled as a medical student at King&#x27;s College London, but he left after six months.

=== Sojourn in Berlin ===
In March 1929, Isherwood joined Auden in Berlin, where Auden was spending a post-graduate year. His primary motivation for making the trip was the sexual freedom that Weimar-era Berlin offered, as he later wrote: &quot;To Christopher, Berlin meant Boys.&quot; The ten-day visit changed Isherwood&#x27;s life. He began an affair with a German boy whom he met at a cellar bar called The Cosy Corner, and he was &quot;brought face to face with his tribe&quot; at Magnus Hirschfeld&#x27;s Institute for Sexual Science. Isherwood visited Berlin again in July and relocated there in November.
In Berlin, Isherwood completed his second novel, &quot;The Memorial&quot; (1932), about the impact of the First World War on his family and his generation. He also continued his habit of keeping a diary. In his diary, he gathered raw material for &quot;Mr. Norris Changes Trains&quot; (1935), inspired by his real-life friendship with Gerald Hamilton, and for &quot;Goodbye to Berlin&quot; (1939), his portrait of the city in which Adolf Hitler was rising to power — enabled by poverty, unemployment, increasing attacks on Jews and Communists, and ignored by the defiant hedonism of night life in the cafés, bars, and brothels. &quot;Goodbye to Berlin&quot; included stories published in the leftist magazine &quot;New Writing&quot;, and it included Isherwood&#x27;s 1937 novella &quot;Sally Bowles&quot;, in which he created his most famous character, based on a young Englishwoman, Jean Ross, with whom he briefly shared a flat.

In the United States, the Berlin novels were published together as &quot;The Berlin Stories&quot; in 1945. In 1951, &quot;Goodbye to Berlin&quot; was adapted for the New York stage by John van Druten using the title &quot;I Am a Camera&quot;, taken from Isherwood&#x27;s opening paragraphs. The play inspired the hit Broadway musical &quot;Cabaret&quot; (1966), later adapted to film as &quot;Cabaret&quot; in 1972.

In 1932, a 27-year-old Isherwood started a relationship with a 16-year-old German boy, Heinz Neddermeyer. They fled Nazi Germany together in May 1933, traveling initially to Greece. Neddermeyer was refused entry to England in January 1934, launching an odyssey in search of a country where they could settle together. They lived in the Canary Islands, Copenhagen, Brussels, Amsterdam, and Sintra, Portugal, while trying to obtain a new nationality and passport for Neddermeyer. 

In May 1937, while he and Isherwood were living in Luxembourg, Neddermeyer was suddenly expelled to Germany. Neddermeyer was arrested the next day by the Gestapo for draft evasion and reciprocal onanism. Neddermeyer was sentenced to three and a half years of hard labor and military service. He married in 1938 and the couple had one child, a son, born in 1940. Neddermeyer survived the war and in 1956 sent Isherwood a letter asking for money to help escape East Germany, which Isherwood provided. The last known contact between the two men was a note of condolence from Neddermeyer to Isherwood on the death of Isherwood&#x27;s mother in 1960. 

During this period, Isherwood returned often to London where he took his first movie-writing job, working with Viennese director Berthold Viertel on the film &quot;Little Friend&quot; (1934). He collaborated with Auden on three plays – &quot;The Dog Beneath the Skin&quot; (1935), &quot;The Ascent of F6&quot; (1936), and &quot;On the Frontier&quot; (1938) – all produced by Robert Medley and Rupert Doone&#x27;s Group Theatre. He also worked on &quot;Lions and Shadows&quot; (1938), a fictionalized autobiography of his education — both in and out of school — in the 1920s.

In January 1938, Isherwood and Auden traveled to China to write &quot;Journey to a War&quot; (1939), about the Sino-Japanese conflict. They returned to England the following summer via the United States and decided to emigrate there in January 1939.

=== Life in the United States ===
While living in Hollywood, California, Isherwood befriended Truman Capote, an up-and-coming young writer who would be influenced by Isherwood&#x27;s &quot;Berlin Stories&quot;, most specifically in the traces of the story &quot;Sally Bowles&quot; that surface in Capote&#x27;s famed novella &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot;.

Isherwood also befriended Dodie Smith, a British novelist and playwright who had also moved to California, and who became one of the few people to whom Isherwood showed his work in progress.

Isherwood considered becoming an American citizen in 1945 but balked at taking an oath that included the statement that he would defend the country. The next year he applied for citizenship and answered questions honestly, saying he would accept non-combatant duties like loading ships with food. The fact that he had volunteered for service with the Medical Corps also helped. At the naturalisation ceremony, he found he was required to swear to defend the nation and decided to take the oath since he had already stated his objections and reservations. He became an American citizen on 8 November 1946.

He began living with the photographer William &quot;Bill&quot; Caskey. In 1947, the two traveled to South America. Isherwood wrote the prose and Caskey took the photographs for a 1949 book about their journey entitled &quot;The Condor and the Cows&quot;. In a 1949 letter to Gore Vidal, Isherwood discussed gay relationships like his own:

=== Meeting Don Bachardy ===
On Valentine&#x27;s Day 1953, at the age of 48, he met the teenager Don Bachardy among a group of friends on the beach at Santa Monica. Reports of Bachardy&#x27;s age at the time vary, but Bachardy later said: &quot;At the time I was probably 16.&quot; In fact, he was 18. Despite the age difference, this meeting began a partnership that, though interrupted by affairs and separations, continued until Isherwood&#x27;s death.

During the early months of their affair, Isherwood finished — and Bachardy typed — the novel on which he had worked for some years, &quot;The World in the Evening&quot; (1954). Isherwood also taught a course on modern English literature at Los Angeles State College (now California State University, Los Angeles) for several years during the 1950s and early 1960s.

The 30-year age difference between Isherwood and Bachardy raised eyebrows at the time, with Bachardy, in his own words, &quot;regarded as a sort of child prostitute&quot;, but the two became a well-known and well-established couple in Southern Californian society with many Hollywood friends.

&quot;Down There on a Visit&quot;, a novel published in 1962, comprised four related stories that overlap the period covered in his Berlin stories. In the opinion of many reviewers, Isherwood&#x27;s finest achievement was his 1964 novel &quot;A Single Man&quot;, that depicted a day in the life of George, a middle-aged, gay Englishman who is a professor at a Los Angeles university. The novel was adapted into a film of the same name in 2009.

During 1964, Isherwood collaborated with American writer Terry Southern on the screenplay for the Tony Richardson film adaptation of &quot;The Loved One&quot;, Evelyn Waugh&#x27;s caustic satire on the American funeral industry.

=== Final years and death ===
Isherwood and Bachardy lived together in Santa Monica for the rest of Isherwood&#x27;s life. Isherwood was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1981, and died of the disease on 4 January 1986 at his Santa Monica home, aged 81. His body was donated to medical science at UCLA, and his ashes were later scattered at sea. Bachardy became a successful artist with an independent reputation, and his portraits of the dying Isherwood became well known after Isherwood&#x27;s death.

=== Association with Vedanta ===

Gerald Heard had introduced British writer Aldous Huxley to Vedanta (Hindu-centered philosophy) and meditation. After migrating to America in 1937, Heard and Huxley became Vedantists attending functions at the Vedanta Society of Southern California, under the guidance of founder Swami Prabhavananda, a monk of the Ramakrishna Order of India. Both were initiated by the Swami. Heard and Huxley introduced Isherwood to the Swami&#x27;s Vedanta Society. Over time, Isherwood developed a close friendship with Huxley, with whom he sometimes collaborated. Isherwood became a dedicated Vedantist himself and was initiated by Prabhavananda, his guru.

The process of conversion to Vedanta was so intense that Isherwood was unable to write another novel between the years 1939–1945, while he immersed himself in study of the Vedanta Scriptures, even becoming a monk for a time at the Society. For the next 35 years Isherwood collaborated with the Swami on translations of various Vedanta scriptures, including the &quot;Bhagavad Gita – The Song of God&quot;, writing articles for the Society&#x27;s journal, and occasionally lecturing at the Hollywood and Santa Barbara temples. For many years he would come to the Hollywood temple on Wednesday nights to read the &quot;Gospel of Ramakrishna&quot; for a half an hour, then the Swami would take questions from the devotees.

From 1950 to 1978, Isherwood gave 53 lectures at the Hollywood and Santa Barbara Vedanta Temples. He mentions in his diaries and the book, &quot;My Guru and His Disciple&quot;, that he feels unqualified to preach, so most of his lectures were readings of papers written by others, primarily Swami Vivekananda. There were a few original lectures including, &quot;Who Is Ramakrishna&quot;, &quot;The Writer and Vedanta&quot;, and a lecture on Girish Chandra Ghosh, a householder disciple of Ramakrishna.

Isherwood was also very involved in the production of the bi-monthly journal of the Vedanta Society of Southern California, &quot;Vedanta and the West&quot;. From 1943 to 1945 he was Managing Editor, from 1951 to 1962 he was an Editorial Advisor together with Aldous Huxley, Gerald Heard, and additionally with John van Druten from 1951 to 1958. From 1949 to 1969 he wrote 40 articles for the journal.

=== Isherwood and war ===
Isherwood&#x27;s father, Frank Bradshaw-Isherwood, was a colonel in the British Army. He was killed during World War I in the Battle of Ypres, France in May 1915, at the age of 46. Isherwood was 10 years old at the time. His father&#x27;s death &quot;...deeply affected him, not only in his perspective of his father and how he would relate to his mother, but in his attitude towards the military and war itself.&quot; Isherwood&#x27;s second novel, &quot;The Memorial&quot;, published in 1932, describes the impact on a family from the death of the father in World War I. &quot;The Memorial&quot; was the first of what would become the trademark for Isherwood: reflecting his life experience into the plot of a novel.

After being asked to leave Cambridge, he lived in Berlin and witnessed the rising power of Fascism, the Nazi Party, and Hitler. Isherwood describes the times in his autobiographical novels &quot;The Berlin Stories&quot;. In 1933, Isherwood fled Germany with his friend Heinz Neddermeyer seeking asylum for Heinz — who was refused entry to England. Heinz was finally arrested in May 1937 by the Gestapo for draft evasion and practicing homosexuality.

Back in London, Isherwood&#x27;s sympathies were with the left, but although the Anti-war movement flourished after World War I, it was fractured into opposing ideological groups. Some wanted to join the fight in the Spanish Civil War, others wanting to just let the Germans in, rather than go to war, still others advocated non-violent resistance, all of which had the effect of weakening their political power. The fighting in Spain was savage, and &quot;...the left tore itself apart with squabbling and paranoia. Veterans came to feel that the idealism of the cause had been exploited, and many resented being policed by shadowy Communist enforcers.&quot;

In 1937, two of the largest peace groups joined forces; the No More War Movement merged into the Peace Pledge Union. The members attested to the following pledge: &quot;War is a crime against humanity. I renounce war, and am therefore determined not to support any kind of war. I am also determined to work for the removal of all causes of war&quot;. Some of the leading authors and intellectuals of the time gave speeches and lent their names to the cause, including Gerald Heard, Aldous Huxley, and Bertrand Russell.

Inspired by Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s reporting from the Spanish Civil War, in January 1938, Isherwood and his friend W. H. Auden traveled to China to cover the invasion by Japan and wrote &quot;Journey to a War&quot; (1939). They returned to England the following summer via the United States and decided to emigrate there in January 1939. At this point Isherwood wasn&#x27;t clear about his own anti-war beliefs. On the way to America, he realized he was a Pacifist, as he would be unwilling to kill his friend Heinz, &quot;Heinz is in the Nazi army. I wouldn&#x27;t kill Heinz. Therefore I have no right to kill anybody&quot;. He had lost his political faith, &quot;I couldn&#x27;t repeat the left-wing slogans which I had been repeating throughout the last few years.&quot;

After moving to California, Isherwood sought &quot;...advice from Gerald Heard and Aldous Huxley about becoming a pacifist, and, like them, he became a disciple of the Ramakrishna monk, Swami Prabhavananda, head of the Vedanta Society of Southern California.&quot; He applied for citizenship and registered as a Conscientious Objector. In Pennsylvania, he worked in a Quaker Hostel, helping to settle European Jews who were fleeing the Nazis.

In 1944, the translation of the Hindu scripture, &quot;Bhagavad Gita – The Song of God&quot; that the Swami and Isherwood had been working on was published. In the appendix, there is an essay by Isherwood titled &quot;The Gita and War&quot;. There Isherwood explains the Vedantic view of war and duty. The plot of the poem is that the whole of India is drawn into a great battle, and on the eve of the fight, Arjuna, the hero warrior of the epic poem, &quot;The Mahabharata&quot;, is taken between the two armies and sees friends, family, and worthy people on both sides, throws down his weapons and says, &quot;I will not fight.&quot; The rest of the book has Lord Krishna, Arjuna&#x27;s friend and advisor, explaining the nature of duty. It may be, for some person, at some time, proper to refuse to fight, but if the cause is righteous, and it&#x27;s your duty as a warrior to fight, it would be a moral hazard to refuse.

== Legacy and recognition ==
* The house in the district of Berlin where Isherwood lived bears a memorial plaque to mark his stay there between 1929 and 1933.
* Isherwood is mentioned in Susan Sontag&#x27;s &quot;Notes on &quot;Camp&quot;&quot; (1964): &quot;Apart from a lazy two-page sketch in Christopher Isherwood&#x27;s novel &quot;The World in the Evening&quot; (1954), [camp] has hardly broken into print.&quot;
* The 2008 film &quot;Chris &amp; Don: A Love Story&quot; chronicled Isherwood and Bachardy&#x27;s lifelong relationship.
* &quot;A Single Man&quot; was adapted into a film, &quot;A Single Man&quot;, in 2009.
* In 2010, Isherwood&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Christopher and His Kind&quot;, was adapted into a television film by the BBC, starring Matt Smith as Isherwood and directed by Geoffrey Sax. The closing credits list Don Bachardy as Consultant. It was broadcast in France and Germany on the Arte channel in February 2011, and in Britain on BBC 2 the following month. 
* The annual &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; – Christopher Isherwood Prize for Autobiographical Prose was established in partnership with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; in 2016.
