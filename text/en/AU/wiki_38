<doc id="151003" wikidata="Q1132883" url="?curid=151003" title="Ashland, Pennsylvania">
<text>Ashland is a borough in Schuylkill and Columbia counties in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania, northwest of Pottsville. It is part of Northeastern Pennsylvania. A small part of the borough also lies in Columbia County, although all of the population resided in the Schuylkill County portion as of the 2020 census. The borough lies in the anthracite coal region of eastern Pennsylvania. Settled in 1850, Ashland was incorporated in 1857, and was named for Henry Clay&#x27;s estate near Lexington, Kentucky. The population in 1900 was 6,438, and in 1940, 7,045, but had dropped to 2,471 at the 2020 census.

It is the location of Pioneer Tunnel, a tourist attraction featuring a tour of a coal mine on mine cars and a separate narrow gauge steam train ride.

==History==

For a long time after southern Pennsylvania was settled, the area that is now Ashland was mostly wilderness except for a hotel in the area in 1820. A prominent citizen of the county, Burd S. Patterson, however, predicted that the area would eventually become a prominent mining town. In 1845, John P. Brock and James Hart joined Patterson in buying of land in the Ashland area. In 1846, a group of miners led by Patrick Devine developed coal seams in veins in the area. However, the town progressed little over the next three years. By 1857, though, the town had 3,500 people, and Ashland became a borough, detaching itself from Butler Township. The first post office was built in 1853, and the first church was built in 1855.

 The Mothers&#x27; Memorial, also known as the Whistlers Mother Statue, is located at the junction of Pennsylvania Route 54 and Pennsylvania Route 61. The Mothers&#x27; Memorial is a bronze reproduction of the famous James Abbott McNeill Whistler artistic painting: &quot;An Arrangement in Grey and Black No. 1&quot;, commonly known as &quot;Whistler&#x27;s Mother&quot;. The WPA-built &quot;Mothers&#x27; Memorial&quot; honors all mothers of the United States and it&#x27;s the only one of its kind in the world. It was designed by the sculptor Emil Siebern, carried out by Julius C. Loester, commissioned and erected during the misery of the Great Depression in the United States by the Ashland Boys&#x27; Association and dedicated on Sunday, September 4, 1938, during Labor Day weekend. President Franklin D. Roosevelt economic recovery plan of the Works Progress Administration (WPA) carried out the stone masonry work. On September 17, 2020, the Mothers&#x27; Memorial, Hoffman Memorial, and the Veterans&#x27; Memorial, were added by the National Park Service to the National Register of Historic Places as a Historic District.
The Ashland Boys&#x27; Association (A.B.A.) was an inspirational story of former residents of Ashland who had to leave town for work when the anthracite mining failed in the late 1800s. Ashland men returned home every Labor Day weekend for little more than a century to visit the old hometown and march in the grand Ashland Boys&#x27; Association Mummers&#x27; Parade. This unique show of attachment to family, friends, and comforts of home erected the WPA-built Mothers&#x27; Memorial statue that became the Ashland Boys&#x27; Association&#x27;s legacy – an American icon and a symbol of motherhood in the United States. The Ashland Boys&#x27; Association was honored with a State Historical Marker () by the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission on August 31, 2013. The historical marker was unveiled by Adam J. Bernodin, III and James Klock.
Goyne Brothers was a family-owned firm that came into existence in 1881. Goyne Brothers which later changed the name in 1903 to Goyne Steam Pump Company were manufacturers of general mining machinery, and in 1883, they determined to make the manufacture of mining pumps as a specialty. The Goyne Steam Pump Company in 1911, became known as one of the most substantial exclusive mine pump manufacturing plants in the United States. The importance of coal mining drainage launched out mine pumpers exclusively and the Goyne Steam Pump Company invented, engineered, manufactured, and sold over 250 different mining pump designs and sizes, ranging from single pump up to the largest compound condensing duplex machines practicable for mining purposes throughout the anthracite and bituminous coal regions of Pennsylvania, and the United States. The Goyne Steam Pump Company changed the name to Goyne Pump Company in 1955, and the company was purchased in 1979 by Goulds Pumps

<doc id="151004" wikidata="Q1184154" url="?curid=151004" title="Shippensburg, Pennsylvania">
<text>Shippensburg is a borough in Cumberland and Franklin counties in the U.S. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Settled in 1730, Shippensburg lies in the Cumberland Valley, southwest of Harrisburg, and is part of the Harrisburg–Carlisle Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 5,478 at the 2020 census.

Shippensburg was incorporated as a borough on January 21, 1819. In the past, there were furniture factories, engine and pump works, and other industrial works located within the town. Shippensburg is the home of the Beistle Company, the oldest manufacturer of decorations and party goods in the U.S. In May 2012, Volvo Construction Equipment began a $100 million expansion project to bring its American headquarters to Shippensburg.

Shippensburg University of Pennsylvania, one of 14 universities of the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education, is located just north of the borough limits in Shippensburg Township.

==History==
Shippensburg is the oldest community of the Cumberland Valley, and the second oldest west of the Susquehanna River in Pennsylvania (after York to the east). In July 1730, 12 Scots-Irish families came to the site of the present-day Shippensburg and built cabin homes along Burd&#x27;s Run. Shippensburg began as the western outpost of colonial settlement.

The village received its name from Edward Shippen, a prominent resident of Lancaster (and onetime mayor of Philadelphia) who obtained the patent to the land from the heirs of William Penn. Edward Shippen&#x27;s granddaughter, Peggy Shippen, was historically notable as the wife of General Benedict Arnold, who betrayed the Continental Army by defecting to the British during the American Revolutionary War.

In 1735, Samuel Perry built the Widow Piper&#x27;s Tavern, which stands at the southwest corner of East King Street and Queen Street. This building was selected as the place for the first Cumberland County Courts in 1750 and 1751. The building has been restored and serves today as the home of the Shippensburg Civic Club.

On July 9, 1755, Edward Morris, the governor of Shippensburg, ordered that a fort be built after he learned of General Braddock&#x27;s defeat at the hands of the French and Indians. His intent was to provide protection for the troops and colonists during the French and Indian War. Over the next year, several buildings, a well, and a log palisade were built. Fort Morris was garrisoned until 1759 but preserved for several more years due to the efforts of Edward Shippen. There is also a record that an officer and eighteen provincial troops were stationed in Shippensburg during the winter of 1763–1764. On March 24, 1761, Shippen wrote, &quot;I desire everybody in Shippensburg to take care of ye Fort for I will suffer a log of it to be thrown down on any pretense whatever.&quot;

Shippensburg University of Pennsylvania was founded in 1871 as a normal school.

In 2009, a team of archaeologists reported they had discovered the site of Fort Morris on Burd Street. Among the artifacts found were pottery, coins, buttons, musket balls, flints and musket parts. Some of these artifacts are housed in Shearer Hall on the Shippensburg University campus, while others are currently on display at the Shippensburg Historical Society.

The Shippensburg Historic District, Dykeman&#x27;s Spring, the Benjamin Blythe Homestead, Cumberland Valley State Normal School Historic District, the Shippen House, and Widow Piper&#x27;s Tavern are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==
Shippensburg is located in south-central Pennsylvania primarily in Cumberland County, but extending west into Franklin County.

U.S. Route 11 passes through the center of town as King Street; US 11 leads northeast to Carlisle, the Cumberland County seat, and southwest to Chambersburg, the Franklin County seat. Pennsylvania Route 696 leads north out of Shippensburg as Earl Street and south as Fayette Street. Via PA 696, it is north to Newburg and south to Exit 24 on Interstate 81. Pennsylvania Route 533 leads west out of town as Morris Street, to Orrstown. Pennsylvania Route 174 (Walnut Bottom Road) split east from US 11 at the east edge of the borough, leading to Exit 29 on Interstate 81 and to the village of Walnut Bottom in South Newton Township.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the borough of Shippensburg has a total area of , of which , or 0.18%, is water. Gum Run flows through the center of town, entering from the south and becoming Middle Spring Creek, a northward-flowing tributary of Conodoguinet Creek and part of the Susquehanna River watershed. Outside the town, the area consists of mostly field and pasture, some forest, few streams and water holes.

<doc id="151005" wikidata="Q1132213" url="?curid=151005" title="Ardmore, Pennsylvania">
<text>Ardmore is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) spanning the border between Delaware and Montgomery counties in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. The population was 12,455 at the time of the 2010 census and had risen to 13,566 in the 2020 census.
Ardmore is a suburb on the west side of Philadelphia within Lower Merion Township in Montgomery County and Haverford Township in Delaware County.

==History==
Originally named &quot;Athensville&quot; in 1853, the community and its railroad station were renamed Ardmore in 1873 by the Pennsylvania Railroad, on whose Main Line, west out of Philadelphia, Ardmore sits at Milepost 8.5. The Autocar Company moved its headquarters to Ardmore in 1899 and constructed a factory on the edge of the downtown area. The factory closed in 1954; during demolition in 1956, a major fire broke out that threatened the downtown area before it was extinguished. Today, Ardmore consistently ranks among the most desirable suburbs of Philadelphia.

===Eminent domain controversy===
In 2004–2006, Ardmore&#x27;s business district was the subject of a hotly contested eminent domain battle. A grassroots organization, the Save Ardmore Coalition, along with local businesses and other civic groups, opposed an eminent domain/redevelopment program that would have involved the demolition of historic buildings, in favor of preserving those buildings for other commercial use. In March 2006, the Lower Merion Township Board of Commissioners adopted a resolution disavowing the use of eminent domain for the benefit of private redevelopment projects. The Ardmore battle was also instrumental in prompting the Pennsylvania General Assembly to enact legislation in 2006 restricting the use of eminent domain for private projects.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Ardmore has a total area of , all land. Ardmore is adjacent to Wynnewood (east), Haverford (west), Gladwyne (north), and Havertown (southwest).

Ardmore&#x27;s downtown, primarily centered around Lancaster Ave, Rittenhouse Place, and Cricket Ave, is home to many shops, restaurants, and small businesses. The western end of downtown features more traditional retail establishments, including the Ardmore West and Ardmore Plaza Shopping Centers. Similarly, the eastern portion of Ardmore along Lancaster Ave is home to several car dealerships, offices, and apartments, as well as the Wynnewood Plaza Shopping Center. Suburban Square, opened in 1928 as one of the earliest shopping centers in the United States, is located just north of the Ardmore train station. Ardmore contained the nation&#x27;s first suburban branch of a major department store, the former Strawbridge &amp; Clothier which opened there in 1930.

The Merion Golf Manor neighborhood, named for the adjacent Merion Golf Club, is roughly bounded by Ardmore Avenue to the north, Darby Road to the West, Hathaway Lane to the South, and the Norristown High Speed Line to the East. Another neighborhood in the Haverford Township portion of town is Ardmore Park, roughly bounded by Haverford Road to the South, Ardmore Avenue to the west, and County Line Road to the North. While originally developed and marketed as Ardmore Park, today it is more commonly referred to today as South Ardmore (not to be confused with a separate housing development of the same name located in nearby Havertown). This neighborhood is home to Normandy Park, Chestnutwold Elementary, and businesses along Haverford Road and County Line Road.

Residents from portions of southeastern Ardmore and Wynnewood cooperate as the ArdWood Civic Association. The Ardmore Progressive Civic Association serves the historically black section of Ardmore bordered by ArdWood Civic Association, Haverford College, Montgomery Avenue, and the Montgomery/Delaware County line. The North Ardmore Civic Association represents residents of North Ardmore and Wynnewood north of Montgomery Avenue. The South Ardmore Betterment Alliance is a community group in the Haverford Township portion of Ardmore which organizes various community activities.

Young Memorial Park (home to the Ardmore Ave Pool and the community center known as &quot;The Shack&quot;). South Ardmore Park is located in neighboring Wynnewood, and Merwood Park and Elwell Field are both adjacent to Ardmore. The Ardmore Post Office and Ardmore Public Library (part of the Lower Merion Library System) are both found on Ardmore Ave, and the Merion Fire Company of Ardmore is located nearby on Greenfield Ave.

Two sites, located in the Haverford Township section of Ardmore, the Merion Golf Club East Course and Pont Reading are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

== Education ==
Pupils living in the Lower Merion Township portion attend schools in the Lower Merion School District (LMSD), while pupils living in the Haverford Township portion attend schools in the School District of Haverford Township.

, in regards to the Lower Merion Township section, school zoning is as follows: Most of it is zoned to Penn Valley Elementary School, while portions are zoned to Penn Wynne and Gladwyne elementaries. For middle school, most of the section is zoned to Welsh Valley Middle School, while some of it is zoned to Black Rock Middle School. For high school, there are portions in the Lower Merion High School walking zone, some in the Harriton High School area, and some in a choice area where students may choose between Harriton and Lower Merion high schools.

Among the many notable graduates of Lower Merion High School in Ardmore are General Henry H. &quot;Hap&quot; Arnold (1903), Commanding General of the U.S. Army Air Forces in WWII; General Alexander M. Haig, Jr. (1942), the 59th United States Secretary of State; James H. Billington (1946), the Librarian of Congress, and; Kobe Bryant (1996), NBA Hall of Fame basketball player.

Ardmore Avenue Elementary School, of the LMSD district and in the African-American section of Ardmore, had 80% of its students as African-Americans. The district closed the school in 1963 during the Civil Rights Movement. An LMSD website stated that the school had a building that was in a poor condition and that the dissolution of the school was &quot;marking the beginning of the true desegregation at the primary level&quot;. By 1996, South Ardmore residents were divided between three elementary schools, but that year there was a plan to rezone so two elementary schools instead of three had portions of the community.

==Infrastructure==
=== Transit ===
Ardmore&#x27;s train station is served by SEPTA Regional Rail&#x27;s Paoli/Thorndale Line (commuter) and Amtrak (intercity) passenger trains. Additionally, the Norristown High Speed Line runs through the Haverford Township portion of town, and Ardmore Junction, Wynnewood Road, and Ardmore Avenue stations are all within or adjacent to the boundaries of Ardmore.

A streetcar line built by the Ardmore and Llanerch Street Railway in 1902 once ran from the 69th Street Transportation Center in Upper Darby to a two-track terminal in downtown Ardmore, now the site of Schauffele Plaza. After the line was acquired by SEPTA in the 1960s, it was converted to a bus route. A section of the line, running alongside Pont Reading Creek and Hathaway Lane, was paved over and is now used by SEPTA as a private busway.

<doc id="151007" wikidata="Q7592291" url="?curid=151007" title="St Albion Parish News">
<text>St Albion Parish News was a regular feature in the British satirical magazine &quot;Private Eye&quot; during the premiership of Tony Blair. It was in the &quot;Private Eye&quot; tradition of featuring a fortnightly column lampooning the Prime Minister of the day and their close associates, seemingly written in a gossipy style by an insider. This has taken either of two broad formats. &quot;Mrs Wilson&#x27;s Diary&quot; and &quot;Dear Bill&quot; were supposedly the observations of spouses Mary Wilson and Denis Thatcher respectively. &quot;Heathco - A Message from the Managing Director&quot; was a motivational newsletter sent to staff of a small company from the boss (Edward Heath, nicknamed &quot;Grocer&quot;), and &quot;St Albion Parish News&quot; was in this broad style.

The format was a spoof of the parish magazine typically published by English churches. Prime Minister Tony Blair was depicted as the earnest and trendy young vicar of St Albion, &quot;Rev ARP Blair, MA (Oxon)&quot;. Leading political figures were given satirical roles within a typical Anglican community, for example, Gordon Brown was the PCC Treasurer, John Prescott was in charge of the working men&#x27;s club and the Home Secretary was Chairman of Neighbourhood Watch. Foreign dignitaries were described as Ministers in other Churches: for example, George W. Bush usually appeared in the Parish News each week as &quot;Rev Dubya Bush of the Church of the Latter-Day Morons&quot; (or, in some issues in 2003—during the Invasion of Iraq and early Iraq War—the Latter-Day Morbombs), in reference to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Bill Clinton belonged to the Church of the Seventh Day Fornicators. Great play was made in the issue of 4 August 2006 of Bush&#x27;s misheard greeting, &quot;Yo, Blair&quot;, to the Prime Minister at the &quot;G8&quot; summit in St Petersburg.

== Structure and general tone ==
The general structure was a message from the vicar, i.e. Prime Minister, plus a few smaller, varying columns. These usually included the Parish Postbag, often containing a letter from a parish member (i.e. minister) complaining about something or other but cut short &quot;for reasons of space&quot; by the editor (in the past this was Alastair Campbell).

In the case of Tony Blair, the &#x27;incumbent vicar&#x27;, the message was nearly always a defence of his recent actions which then turned into a self-loving eulogy. Bible passages were frequently modified, or invented, to reflect kindly and reverently on the vicar. There would sometimes be a hymn with up-beat slogan words, marked &quot;Words and Music T. Blair&quot; to emphasise the message. Despite frequent promises of not blaming others it was very common for the ensuing sentence or paragraph to do just that, all under a pretence of friendliness and half-heartedness.

== Running jokes from the Blair era ==
The tone of the sketch was set by the magazine&#x27;s satirical take on the Blair government and its personalities. The vicar&#x27;s message always began with &#x27;hullo&#x27;, any appearance by Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott featured attempts at formal, well-written language plagued by mistakes and misunderstandings of words (e.g. &quot;there have been many alligators made about me&quot;), and threats to sue were frequently made by the vicar&#x27;s wife (Cherie Blair is a leading barrister).

Some weeks there was an item &quot;To Remember In Your Prayers&quot;, seeking understanding for former colleagues who had resigned or been sacked, for example Mo Mowlam, Clare Short and Charles Clarke. They are depicted as obviously deluded and mentally ill, hence the need for prayers.

== TV adaptation ==
In 1998 &quot;Sermon from St. Albion&#x27;s&quot;, an ITV television series based on the column was shown. It starred Harry Enfield as the Rev. Blair.

== Influence ==
During the run-up to the 2001 General Election, Tony Blair started his campaign at St Olave&#x27;s and St Xavier&#x27;s School, during which he was photographed making a speech in front of a stained-glass window, with the choir surrounding him. It was noted that this made Blair look like the &quot;vicar of St Albions&quot;.

<text>Bethlehem is a city in Northampton and Lehigh counties in the Lehigh Valley region of eastern Pennsylvania, United States. As of the 2020 census, Bethlehem had a total population of 75,781, making it the second-largest city in the Lehigh Valley after Allentown and the seventh-largest city in the state. Among its total population as of 2020, 55,639 were in Northampton County and 19,343 were in Lehigh County. The city is located along the Lehigh River, a tributary of the Delaware River.

Bethlehem lies in the geographic center of the Lehigh Valley, a metropolitan region of with a population of 861,899 people as of the 2020 census that is Pennsylvania&#x27;s third-most populous metropolitan area and the 68th-most populated metropolitan area in the U.S. Bethlehem borders Allentown to its west and is north of Philadelphia and west of New York City.

There are four sections to the city: central Bethlehem, the south side, the east side, and the west side. Each of these sections blossomed at different times in the city&#x27;s development and each contains areas recognized under the National Register of Historic Places. Norfolk Southern Railway&#x27;s Lehigh Line, formerly the main line of the Lehigh Valley Railroad, runs through Bethlehem heading east to Easton and across the Delaware River to Phillipsburg, New Jersey. The Norfolk Southern Railway&#x27;s Reading Line runs through Bethlehem and west to Allentown and Reading.

Bethlehem has a long historical relationship with the celebration of Christmas. The city was christened as Bethlehem on Christmas Eve 1741 by Nicolaus Zinzendorf, a Moravian bishop. In 1747, Bethlehem was the first U.S. city to feature a decorated Christmas tree. On December 7, 1937, at a grand ceremony during the Great Depression, the city adopted the nickname Christmas City USA in a large ceremony. It is one of several Lehigh Valley locations, including Egypt, Emmaus, Jordan Creek, and Nazareth, whose names were inspired by locations in the Bible.

==History==

===Settlement===
Prior to European settlements, the areas around present-day Bethlehem and its surrounding locales along the Delaware River and its tributaries in eastern Pennsylvania were inhabited by various indigenous peoples, including the Algonquian-speaking Lenape, which had three main divisions, known by the dialects, the Unami, Unalachtigo, and Munsee. They traded with the Dutch and then British colonialists in the Mid-Atlantic region in present-day Connecticut, Delaware, Long Island, Maryland, New Jersey, and the lower Hudson Valley in New York, and other regions in Pennsylvania.

===18th century===

On April 2, 1741, William Allen, a wealthy Philadelphia merchant and political figure, who later founded the city of Allentown, deeded along the banks of the Monocacy Creek and Lehigh River to the Moravian Church. On Christmas Eve of that year, David Nitschmann and Nicolaus Zinzendorf, leading a small group of Moravians, founded the mission community of Bethlehem at the confluence of the Monocacy and Lehigh rivers. They established missionary communities among the Native Americans and unchurched German-speaking Christians and named the settlement after the Biblical town Bethlehem of Judea, said to be the birthplace of Jesus. &quot;Count Zinzendorf said, &#x27;Brothers, how more fittingly could we call our new home than to name it in honor of the spot where the event we now commemorate took place. We will call this place Bethlehem.&#x27; And so was Bethlehem named after the birthplace of the Man of Peace.&quot;

Bethlehem was started as a typical Moravian Settlement Congregation, where the Church owned all the property. Until the 1850s, officially only members of the Moravian Church were permitted to lease land plots in Bethlehem. But a member of a group of families who were Huguenots also settled in Bethlehem. In the late 1700s, Bethlehem established grist and saw mills, known as Calvin&#x27;s Mills. The historic Brethren&#x27;s House, Sisters&#x27; House, Widows&#x27; House, and &quot;Gemeinhaus&quot; (Congregation House), with the Old Chapel, are remnants of this period of communal living.

The Moravians ministered to the regional Lenape Native Americans through their mission in the area, and to others further east in the New York colony. In historic Bethlehem&#x27;s God&#x27;s Acre cemetery, converted Lenape were buried alongside Moravians. In 1762, Bethlehem built the first waterworks in America to pump water for public use.

In the autumn of 1777, during the American Revolutionary War, many patriots fled from Philadelphia to Bethlehem and the surrounding area as the British Army advanced from the east. The Marquis de Lafayette recovered from an injury received at the Battle of Brandywine in Bethlehem, and several of the most prominent members of the Continental Congress fled north to Bethlehem before the congress eventually reconvened in Lancaster. Before, during, and after the American Revolution, Bethlehem was visited by George Washington and his wife Martha, Alexander Hamilton, Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, Samuel Adams, John Hancock, and the Marquis de Lafayette. On September 22, 1777, fourteen members of the Second Continental Congress signed the Moravian Sun Inn register in Bethlehem and stayed there overnight.

George Washington stored his personal effects at the James Burnside farm at 1461 Schoenersville Road in Bethlehem. , this site is operated as a historical museum known as James Burnside Plantation.

===19th century===

In 1845, Bethlehem was a prosperous village that was incorporated into a free borough in the County of Northampton. After the Unity Synod of 1848, Bethlehem became the headquarters of the Northern Province of the Moravian Church in North America. On March 27, 1900, the Bach Choir of Bethlehem presented the United States debut of German Lutheran composer Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s Mass in B Minor in the city&#x27;s Central Moravian Church. Bethlehem was one of the four leading Moravian communities in the Northeastern United States; Emmaus, Lititz, and Nazareth, each in Pennsylvania, were the three others.

In 1865, after the end of the Civil War, the Borough of South Bethlehem was formed. In 1886, the Borough of West Bethlehem in Lehigh County was formed.

===20th century===
In 1901, the Borough of Northampton Heights was incorporated. Starting in 1904, the borough of Bethlehem began a concerted effort to merge with its neighboring municipalities. In 1904 Bethlehem absorbed West Bethlehem followed shortly after in 1905 by Hottlesville. South Bethlehem would attempt to resist merger and incorporated themselves as their own city in 1913, however, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania struck down their incorporation as unconstitutional in 1915 and in 1917 South Bethlehem would be annexed.

Following the merger with South Bethlehem, the new consolidated City of Bethlehem was incorporated. Bethlehem Steel executive Archibald Johnston was elected the new city&#x27;s first mayor. Northampton Heights was incorporated into the city in 1920 after significant local resistance and a failed proposed merger between Northampton Heights and Hellertown to make a rival city. With the annexation of Hottlesville, Macada, Altonah, and the former town of Shimersville, Bethlehem&#x27;s present borders were established.
== Geography ==

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (0.88%) is water. Because large volumes of water were required in the steelmaking process, the city purchased of land in the Pocono Mountains, where its water is stored in reservoirs. The Lehigh River, a tributary of the Delaware, flows through Bethlehem. Monocacy and Saucon Creeks empty into the Lehigh River in Bethlehem.

==Economy==
===Bethlehem Steel===

Bethlehem became a center of heavy industry and trade during the Industrial Revolution. Bethlehem Steel (1857–2003), founded and based in Bethlehem, was once the second-largest steel producer in the United States, after Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel. The company was a powerhouse in the mid-twentieth century, with over 30,000 employees at its peak. Bethlehem Steel was also one of the largest shipbuilding companies in the world and one of the most powerful symbols of American industrial manufacturing leadership, and it manufactured over 1,100 warships used in World War II.

Bethlehem Steel began producing the first wide-flange structural shapes made in the United States and they pioneered the production of the now-ubiquitous &quot;I-beam&quot; used in construction of steel-framed buildings, including skyscrapers. It manufactured construction materials for numerous New York City and other city skyscrapers and major bridges.

The company became a major supplier of armor plate and ordnance products during World War I and World War II. After roughly 140 years of metal production at its Bethlehem plant, Bethlehem Steel ceased operations there in 1995, in the face of overseas competition and declining demand, and the company&#x27;s liquidation was completed in 2003.

===Wind Creek Bethlehem===

In December 2006, Las Vegas Sands Corp was awarded a Category 2 Slot Machine License by the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board. LVSC began work on the site, categorized as both the largest brownfield redevelopment project in the nation and the largest casino development investment made to date in Pennsylvania. Its mission was to create reinvestment and urbanization in the area. At a projected cost of $743 million, the historic Bethlehem Steel plant is being redeveloped as a fully integrated resort, to include 3,000 slot machines, over 300 hotel rooms, 9 restaurants, of retail outlet shopping, and of flexible multi-purpose space. In 2007, the casino resort company of Las Vegas Sands began the construction of Sands Casino Resort Bethlehem, later rebranded as Wind Creek Bethlehem. The casino has been projected to bring in approximately one million dollars in revenue per day as of 2009.

Another major economic anchor to the city is St. Luke&#x27;s Hospital located in neighboring Fountain Hill. That Hospital and Health Network is the second-largest of its type in the Lehigh Valley. Other major employers include B. Braun, Lehigh University, and the Guardian Life Insurance Company of America.

Other companies in Bethlehem include the candy company Just Born. Zulily has a large logistics operation in the city that serves the United States.

===Retail development===

In the early 21st century, several shops and restaurants have opened in the city&#x27;s downtown and South Side. In the mid-1970s, West Broad Street between New and Guetter Streets in center city was converted to a pedestrian plaza. The buildings on the south side of the block were torn down and replaced by an enclosed mall and an eleven-story office tower. The tower, at One Bethlehem Plaza on the corner of Broad and New, continues to operate, but the 80,000-square-foot mall, which was erected in response to the development of suburban shopping malls, failed. Since then, the block has been reopened to traffic, and the mall has been converted into offices for PowerSchool, a software company based in Folsom, California, and the Internal Revenue Service.

Retail business in downtown Bethlehem on Main Street south of Broad Street has experienced growth. The two-block shopping area is anchored by the campus of Moravian University, Central Moravian Church in the south, Bethlehem Common indoor mall, and the historic Moravian Sun Inn, built in 1758, in the north.

Among the blocks&#x27; attractions are the Moravian Book Shop, the country&#x27;s oldest continuously operating bookstore built in 1756, and the historic Hotel Bethlehem, built in 1922.

On the city&#x27;s South Side, new stores and restaurants opened on 3rd and 4th streets in the early 21st century, due partly to the presence of Lehigh University and the 2009 openings of Wind Creek Bethlehem casino and SteelStacks, a 10-acre campus dedicated to music and the arts, on property that was previously part of Bethlehem Steel&#x27;s global manufacturing headquarters prior to the company&#x27;s 2001 liquidation.

Outside center city Bethlehem, there are five additional shopping centers:
* Bethlehem Square on the edge of the city in Bethlehem Township
* Lehigh Center Shopping Center on Union Boulevard near the Allentown border
* Martin Court Shopping Center on 8th Avenue near Route 378
* Stefko Boulevard Shopping Center between Washington and Easton Avenues
* Westgate Mall, an enclosed mall, on Schoenersville Road

==Arts and culture==
===Christmas celebrations===

Bethlehem has a long historical relationship with the celebration of Christmas, which is prominently celebrated in the city annually. The city was christened as Bethlehem on Christmas Eve, 1741 by Nicolaus Zinzendorf, a Moravian bishop. In 1747, Bethlehem was the first U.S. city to feature a decorated Christmas tree.

On December 7, 1937, at a grand ceremony during the Great Depression, the city adopted the nickname &quot;&#x27;Christmas City USA&quot; in a large ceremony that included Marion Brown Grace, the daughter of former South Bethlehem burgess Charles F. Brown and wife of Bethlehem Steel president Eugene Grace. Hundreds of citizens attended the ceremony and thousands more listened to the speeches and musical performances on the radio, which was held at Hotel Bethlehem, then a two-room log house, where the original settlers conducted their evening worship on Christmas Eve in 1741. As their benefactor, Count Zinzendorf, observed the farm animals that shared the space and listened to the settlers sing the hymn, &quot;Not Jerusalem, But Lowly Bethlehem&quot;, he proclaimed the name of the settlement to be Bethlehem. The people gathered at the 1937 ceremony heard the same words when the Bach Choir sang the old German hymn, &quot;Jesu, Rufe Mich (Jesus, Call Thou Me)&quot;, by Adam Drese.

The &quot;Bethlehem Globe-Times&quot;, which later merged into &quot;The Express-Times&quot;, paid for the large wooden star erected on the top of South Mountain, at a cost of $460. The original star was created with four wooden planks, overlapped to create an eight-point star, which was 60 feet high and 51 feet wide, mounted on two wooden poles, and lit by 150 50-watt light bulbs. PPL Corporation and the Bethlehem Water Department installed the star, which was erected at the top of South Mountain on property owned by the Water Department, in Lower Saucon Township.

In 1939, the wooden star was replaced with a star made of steel from Bethlehem Steel, at a cost of $5,000. It had eight rays, with the main horizontal ray 81 feet wide and the main vertical ray 53 feet high. In 1967, the current star, 91 feet high, was installed on the old steel frame and set in a concrete base 25 feet wide by 5 feet deep. Plexiglas was installed to protect the 250 50-watt light bulbs. In the summer of 2006, the city repaired the base. A crew of municipal electricians changes the bulbs every two years. Beginning in the mid-1990s, the star was lit from 4:30 p.m. until midnight, every day of the year.

<doc id="151011" wikidata="Q708732" url="?curid=151011" title="François Barbé-Marbois">
<text>François, [[Marquess|marquis]] de Barbé-Marbois (31 January 1745 – 12 February 1837) was a French civil servant, diplomat, and politician.

He was ambassador of France to the United States (1784–1785), where he married the daughter of the Governor of Pennsylvania, William Moore. He then became Napoleon I&#x27;s Minister of the Treasury (1801–1806), before Napoleon appointed him First President of the &quot;Cour des Comptes&quot;, (&quot;Court of Accounts&quot;), France&#x27;s supreme audit institution (1807–1814).

==Early career==
Born in Metz, where his father was director of the local mint, Barbé-Marbois tutored the children of the Marquis de Castries. In 1779, he was made secretary of the French legation to the United States. In 1780, Barbé-Marbois sent a questionnaire to the governors of all thirteen former American colonies, seeking information about each state&#x27;s geography, natural resources, history, and government. Thomas Jefferson, who was then finishing his final term as Virginia&#x27;s governor, responded to this query with a manuscript that later became his famous &quot;Notes on the State of Virginia&quot;.

Barbé-Marbois was elected a Foreign Honorary Member to both the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society in 1781. When the minister Chevalier de la Luzerne returned to France in 1783, Barbé-Marbois remained in America as chargé d&#x27;affaires in 1784. That year he married Elizabeth Moore, the daughter of William Moore, former governor of Pennsylvania.

In 1785, he became intendant of the colony of Saint-Domingue under the &quot;Ancien Régime&quot;.

==In the Revolution==
At the close of 1789, he returned to France, and then placed his services at the disposal of the French Revolutionary government. In 1791 he was sent to Regensburg to help the Marquis de Noailles, the French ambassador. Suspected of treason, he was arrested on his return but soon freed.

In 1795, he was elected to the Council of Ancients, where the general moderation of his attitude, especially in his opposition to the exclusion of nobles and the relations of &quot;émigrés&quot; from public life, brought him under suspicion of being a royalist, though he pronounced a eulogy on Napoleon Bonaparte for his success in Italy.

During the anti-Royalist &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; of the 18th Fructidor (4 September) 1797, he was arrested and transported to French Guiana. Transferred to the island of Oléron in 1799, he was set free by Bonaparte after the Coup of 18 Brumaire. In 1801, under the Consulate, he became councillor of state and director of the &quot;Trésor public&quot; (Treasury), and in 1802 a senator.

In 1803 he negotiated the Louisiana Purchase treaty by which Louisiana was ceded to the United States, and was rewarded by the First Consul with a gift of 152,000 francs.

==Empire, Restoration, and July Monarchy==
Loyal to the First Empire, he was made grand officer of the Legion of Honour and a count in 1805, and in 1808 he became president of the &quot;Cour des Comptes&quot;. His career as Head of the Treasury ended in 1806. In return for these favours, he heaped praise upon Napoleon; yet, in 1814, he helped to draw up the act of abdication of the emperor, and declared to the &quot;Cour des Comptes&quot;, with reference to the invasion of France by the Sixth Coalition:
:&quot;...united for the most beautiful of causes, it is long since we have been as free as we are now, in the presence of the foreigner in arms.&quot;

In June of that year, under the First Restoration, Barbé-Marbois was made Peer of France by King Louis XVIII, and confirmed in his office as president of the &quot;Cour des Comptes&quot;. Deprived of his positions by Napoleon during the Hundred Days, he was appointed Minister of Justice under the Duc de Richelieu (August 1815), tried unsuccessfully to gain the confidence of the Ultra-Royalists, and withdrew at the end of nine months (10 May 1816).

In 1830, when the July Revolution brought Louis Philippe and the Orléans Monarchy, Barbé-Marbois went, as president of the &quot;Cour des Comptes&quot;, to compliment the new king, and was confirmed in his position. He held his office until April 1834.

==Works==
In 1829, he wrote the book &quot;Histoire de la Louisiane et la cession de cette colonie par la France aux Etats-Unis de l&#x27;Amérique septentrionale; précédée d&#x27;un discours sur la constitution et le gouvernement des Etats-Unis&quot; (&quot;History of Louisiana and of Its Cession to the United States of Northern America; Preceded by a Discourse on the Constitution and Government of the United States&quot;).

He published various texts, including:
* &quot;Reflexions sur la colonie de Saint-Domingue&quot; (&quot;Thought on the Colony of Saint-Domingue&quot;, 1794)
* &quot;De la Guyane&quot;, etc. (&quot;On [French] Guiana&quot;, 1822)
* &quot;Journal d&#x27;un deporté non-jugé&quot; (&quot;Diary of a Non-Tried Deportee&quot;, 2 vols., 1834)
Written in 1780, while secretary to the French legation to the US Army: &quot;D&#x27;Complot du Benedict Arnold &amp; Sir Henri Clinton contre Eunas` States du America General George Washington&quot;, one of the first accounts of Arnold&#x27;s treason, was not published until 1816.

<text>Welney is a village and civil parish in the Fens of England and the county of Norfolk. The village is about south-west of the town of Downham Market, south of the town of King&#x27;s Lynn and west of the city of Norwich. The county boundary with Cambridgeshire is adjacent, with the city of Cambridge to the south.
Welney is immediately to the west of the Old Bedford River, River Delph and New Bedford River, which are parallel channels and are here crossed by the A1101 road.

Welney is on the Ouse Washes, an area of wildlife conservation. WWT Welney, near the village, is a nature reserve in the care of the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust. Nearby there are also the RSPB Ouse Washes, a reserve managed by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.

The parish covers an area of and had a population of 528 in 217 households at the 2001 census, which had increased to 542 by the 2011 Census. For the purposes of local government the parish falls within the district of King&#x27;s Lynn and West Norfolk.

== History ==
In the 14th century Welney was called &quot;Wellenhe&quot;, meaning ‘a river called Welle’ (the old name of the Old Croft River). In the 18th century Woad was grown in the parish.
In 1820 a road was built from Welney across The Wash to the New Bedford River (also known as the Hundred Foot Drain), where a ferry-boat was established opposite the public house of Thomas Golding, formerly Washington&#x27;s; this provided a direct route into Lincolnshire through Wisbech from Bury St Edmunds, Ely and Cambridge.
In the second half of the 19th century Welney became significant for its skaters. On 21 February 1855 Turkey Smart of Welney became champion skater of the Fens. James Smart of Welney became champion on 21 January 1891. William Loveday of Welney came 2nd to James Aveling of March in the amateur championship.

St Mary&#x27;s Church in Welney is dedicated to the Virgin Mary.

<doc id="151013" wikidata="Q142270" url="?curid=151013" title="T-symmetry">
<text>T-symmetry or time reversal symmetry is the theoretical symmetry of physical laws under the transformation of time reversal,
:formula_1

Since the second law of thermodynamics states that entropy increases as time flows toward the future, in general, the macroscopic universe does not show symmetry under time reversal. In other words, time is said to be non-symmetric, or asymmetric, except for special equilibrium states when the second law of thermodynamics predicts the time symmetry to hold. However, quantum noninvasive measurements are predicted to violate time symmetry even in equilibrium, contrary to their classical counterparts, although this has not yet been experimentally confirmed.

Time &quot;asymmetries&quot; (see Arrow of time) generally are caused by one of three categories:
# intrinsic to the dynamic physical law (e.g., for the weak force)
# due to the initial conditions of the universe (e.g., for the second law of thermodynamics)
# due to measurements (e.g., for the noninvasive measurements)

== Macroscopic phenomena ==
===The second law of thermodynamics===

Daily experience shows that T-symmetry does not hold for the behavior of bulk materials. Of these macroscopic laws, most notable is the second law of thermodynamics. Many other phenomena, such as the relative motion of bodies with friction, or viscous motion of fluids, reduce to this, because the underlying mechanism is the dissipation of usable energy (for example, kinetic energy) into heat.

The question of whether this time-asymmetric dissipation is really inevitable has been considered by many physicists, often in the context of Maxwell&#x27;s demon. The name comes from a thought experiment described by James Clerk Maxwell in which a microscopic demon guards a gate between two halves of a room. It only lets slow molecules into one half, only fast ones into the other. By eventually making one side of the room cooler than before and the other hotter, it seems to reduce the entropy of the room, and reverse the arrow of time. Many analyses have been made of this; all show that when the entropy of room and demon are taken together, this total entropy does increase. Modern analyses of this problem have taken into account Claude E. Shannon&#x27;s relation between entropy and information. Many interesting results in modern computing are closely related to this problem—reversible computing, quantum computing and physical limits to computing, are examples. These seemingly metaphysical questions are today, in these ways, slowly being converted into hypotheses of the physical sciences.

The current consensus hinges upon the Boltzmann–Shannon identification of the logarithm of phase space volume with the negative of Shannon information, and hence to entropy. In this notion, a fixed initial state of a macroscopic system corresponds to relatively low entropy because the coordinates of the molecules of the body are constrained. As the system evolves in the presence of dissipation, the molecular coordinates can move into larger volumes of phase space, becoming more uncertain, and thus leading to increase in entropy.

=== Big Bang===
One resolution to irreversibility is to say that the constant increase of entropy we observe happens &quot;only&quot; because of the initial state of our universe. Other possible states of the universe (for example, a universe at heat death equilibrium) would actually result in no increase of entropy. In this view, the apparent T-asymmetry of our universe is a problem in cosmology: why did the universe start with a low entropy? This view, supported by cosmological observations (such as the isotropy of the cosmic microwave background) connects this problem to the question of &quot;initial conditions&quot; of the universe.

===Black holes===
The laws of gravity seem to be time reversal invariant in classical mechanics; however, specific solutions need not be.

An object can cross through the event horizon of a black hole from the outside, and then fall rapidly to the central region where our understanding of physics breaks down. Since within a black hole the forward light-cone is directed towards the center and the backward light-cone is directed outward, it is not even possible to define time-reversal in the usual manner. The only way anything can escape from a black hole is as Hawking radiation.

The time reversal of a black hole would be a hypothetical object known as a white hole. From the outside they appear similar. While a black hole has a beginning and is inescapable, a white hole has an ending and cannot be entered. The forward light-cones of a white hole are directed outward; and its backward light-cones are directed towards the center.

The event horizon of a black hole may be thought of as a surface moving outward at the local speed of light and is just on the edge between escaping and falling back. The event horizon of a white hole is a surface moving inward at the local speed of light and is just on the edge between being swept outward and succeeding in reaching the center. They are two different kinds of horizons—the horizon of a white hole is like the horizon of a black hole turned inside-out.

The modern view of black hole irreversibility is to relate it to the second law of thermodynamics, since black holes are viewed as thermodynamic objects. For example, according to the gauge–gravity duality conjecture, all microscopic processes in a black hole are reversible, and only the collective behavior is irreversible, as in any other macroscopic, thermal system.

===Kinetic consequences: detailed balance and Onsager reciprocal relations===

In physical and chemical kinetics, T-symmetry of the mechanical microscopic equations implies two important laws: the principle of detailed balance and the Onsager reciprocal relations. T-symmetry of the microscopic description together with its kinetic consequences are called microscopic reversibility.

===Effect of time reversal on some variables of classical physics===

====Even====
Classical variables that do not change upon time reversal include:
:formula_2, position of a particle in three-space
:formula_3, acceleration of the particle
:formula_4, force on the particle
:formula_5, energy of the particle
:formula_6, electric potential (voltage)
:formula_7, electric field
:formula_8, electric displacement
:formula_9, density of electric charge
:formula_10, electric polarization
:Energy density of the electromagnetic field
:formula_11, Maxwell stress tensor
:All masses, charges, coupling constants, and other physical constants, except those associated with the weak force.

====Odd====
Classical variables that time reversal negates include:
:formula_12, the time when an event occurs
:formula_13, velocity of a particle
:formula_14, linear momentum of a particle
:formula_15, angular momentum of a particle (both orbital and spin)
:formula_16, electromagnetic vector potential
:formula_17, magnetic field
:formula_18, magnetic auxiliary field
:formula_19, density of electric current
:formula_20, magnetization
:formula_21, Poynting vector
:formula_22, power (rate of work done).

====Example: Magnetic Field and Onsager reciprocal relations====
Let us consider the example of a system of charged particles subject to a constant external magnetic field: in this case the canonical time reversal operation that reverses the velocities and the time formula_12 and keeps the coordinates untouched is no more a symmetry for the system. Under this consideration, it seems that only Onsager–Casimir reciprocal relations could hold; these equalities relate two different systems, one subject to formula_17 and another to formula_25, and so their utility is limited. However, it was proved that it is possible to find other time reversal operations which preserve the dynamics and so Onsager reciprocal relations; in conclusion, one cannot state that the presence of a magnetic field always breaks T-symmetry.

==Microscopic phenomena: time reversal invariance==

Most systems are asymmetric under time reversal, but there may be phenomena with symmetry. In classical mechanics, a velocity &quot;v&quot; reverses under the operation of &quot;T&quot;, but an acceleration does not. Therefore, one models dissipative phenomena through terms that are odd in &quot;v&quot;. However, delicate experiments in which known sources of dissipation are removed reveal that the laws of mechanics are time reversal invariant. Dissipation itself is originated in the second law of thermodynamics.

The motion of a charged body in a magnetic field, &quot;B&quot; involves the velocity through the Lorentz force term &quot;v&quot;×&quot;B&quot;, and might seem at first to be asymmetric under &quot;T&quot;. A closer look assures us that &quot;B&quot; also changes sign under time reversal. This happens because a magnetic field is produced by an electric current, &quot;J&quot;, which reverses sign under &quot;T&quot;. Thus, the motion of classical charged particles in electromagnetic fields is also time reversal invariant. (Despite this, it is still useful to consider the time-reversal non-invariance in a &quot;local&quot; sense when the external field is held fixed, as when the magneto-optic effect is analyzed. This allows one to analyze the conditions under which optical phenomena that locally break time-reversal, such as Faraday isolators and directional dichroism, can occur.)

In physics one separates the laws of motion, called kinematics, from the laws of force, called dynamics. Following the classical kinematics of Newton&#x27;s laws of motion, the kinematics of quantum mechanics is built in such a way that it presupposes nothing about the time reversal symmetry of the dynamics. In other words, if the dynamics are invariant, then the kinematics will allow it to remain invariant; if the dynamics is not, then the kinematics will also show this. The structure of the quantum laws of motion are richer, and we examine these next.

===Time reversal in quantum mechanics===

This section contains a discussion of the three most important properties of time reversal in quantum mechanics; chiefly,
# that it must be represented as an anti-unitary operator,
# that it protects non-degenerate quantum states from having an electric dipole moment,
# that it has two-dimensional representations with the property (for fermions).

The strangeness of this result is clear if one compares it with parity. If parity transforms a pair of quantum states into each other, then the sum and difference of these two basis states are states of good parity. Time reversal does not behave like this. It seems to violate the theorem that all abelian groups be represented by one-dimensional irreducible representations. The reason it does this is that it is represented by an anti-unitary operator. It thus opens the way to spinors in quantum mechanics.

On the other hand, the notion of quantum-mechanical time reversal turns out to be a useful tool for the development of physically motivated quantum computing and simulation settings, providing, at the same time, relatively simple tools to assess their complexity. For instance, quantum-mechanical time reversal was used to develop novel boson sampling schemes and to prove the duality between two fundamental optical operations, beam splitter and squeezing transformations.

===Formal notation===
In formal mathematical presentations of T-symmetry, three different kinds of notation for T need to be carefully distinguished: the T that is an involution, capturing the actual reversal of the time coordinate, the T that is an ordinary finite dimensional matrix, acting on spinors and vectors, and the T that is an operator on an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space.

For a real (not complex) classical (unquantized) scalar field formula_26, the time reversal involution can simply be written as

:formula_27

as time reversal leaves the scalar value at a fixed spacetime point unchanged, up to an overall sign formula_28. A slightly more formal way to write this is

:formula_29

which has the advantage of emphasizing that formula_30 is a map, and thus the &quot;mapsto&quot; notation formula_31 whereas formula_32 is a factual statement relating the old and new fields to one-another.

Unlike scalar fields, spinor and vector fields formula_33 might have a non-trivial behavior under time reversal. In this case, one has to write

:formula_34

where formula_35 is just an ordinary matrix. For complex fields, complex conjugation may be required, for which the mapping formula_36 can be thought of as a 2x2 matrix. For a Dirac spinor, formula_35 cannot be written as a 4x4 matrix, because, in fact, complex conjugation is indeed required; however, it can be written as an 8x8 matrix, acting on the 8 real components of a Dirac spinor.

In the general setting, there is no &quot;ab initio&quot; value to be given for formula_35; its actual form depends on the specific equation or equations which are being examined. In general, one simply states that the equations must be time-reversal invariant, and then solves for the explicit value of formula_35 that achieves this goal. In some cases, generic arguments can be made. Thus, for example, for spinors in three-dimensional Euclidean space, or four-dimensional Minkowski space, an explicit transformation can be given. It is conventionally given as

:formula_40

where formula_41 is the y-component of the angular momentum operator and formula_42 is complex conjugation, as before. This form follows whenever the spinor can be described with a linear differential equation that is first-order in the time derivative, which is generally the case in order for something to be validly called &quot;a spinor&quot;.

The formal notation now makes it clear how to extend time-reversal to an arbitrary tensor field formula_43 In this case,

:formula_44

Covariant tensor indexes will transform as formula_45 and so on. For quantum fields, there is also a third T, written as formula_46 which is actually an infinite dimensional operator acting on a Hilbert space. It acts on quantized fields formula_47 as

:formula_48

This can be thought of as a special case of a tensor with one covariant, and one contravariant index, and thus two formula_49&#x27;s are required.

All three of these symbols capture the idea of time-reversal; they differ with respect to the specific space that is being acted on: functions, vectors/spinors, or infinite-dimensional operators. The remainder of this article is not cautious to distinguish these three; the &quot;T&quot; that appears below is meant to be either formula_30 or formula_35 or formula_46 depending on context, left for the reader to infer.

===Anti-unitary representation of time reversal===

Eugene Wigner showed that a symmetry operation &quot;S&quot; of a Hamiltonian is represented, in quantum mechanics either by a unitary operator, , or an antiunitary one, where &quot;U&quot; is unitary, and &quot;K&quot; denotes complex conjugation. These are the only operations that act on Hilbert space so as to preserve the &quot;length&quot; of the projection of any one state-vector onto another state-vector.

Consider the parity operator. Acting on the position, it reverses the directions of space, so that . Similarly, it reverses the direction of &quot;momentum&quot;, so that , where &quot;x&quot; and &quot;p&quot; are the position and momentum operators. This preserves the canonical commutator , where &quot;ħ&quot; is the reduced Planck constant, only if &quot;P&quot; is chosen to be unitary, .

On the other hand, the &quot;time reversal&quot; operator &quot;T&quot;, it does nothing to the x-operator, , but it reverses the direction of p, so that . The canonical commutator is invariant only if &quot;T&quot; is chosen to be anti-unitary, i.e., .

Another argument involves energy, the time-component of the four-momentum. If time reversal were implemented as a unitary operator, it would reverse the sign of the energy just as space-reversal reverses the sign of the momentum. This is not possible, because, unlike momentum, energy is always positive. Since energy in quantum mechanics is defined as the phase factor exp(–&quot;iEt&quot;) that one gets when one moves forward in time, the way to reverse time while preserving the sign of the energy is to also reverse the sense of &quot;i&quot;, so that the sense of phases is reversed.

Similarly, any operation that reverses the sense of phase, which changes the sign of &quot;i&quot;, will turn positive energies into negative energies unless it also changes the direction of time. So every antiunitary symmetry in a theory with positive energy must reverse the direction of time. Every antiunitary operator can be written as the product of the time reversal operator and a unitary operator that does not reverse time.

For a particle with spin &quot;J&quot;, one can use the representation

::formula_53

where &quot;J&quot;&quot;y&quot; is the &quot;y&quot;-component of the spin, and use of has been made.

===Electric dipole moments===

This has an interesting consequence on the electric dipole moment (EDM) of any particle. The EDM is defined through the shift in the energy of a state when it is put in an external electric field: , where &quot;d&quot; is called the EDM and δ, the induced dipole moment. One important property of an EDM is that the energy shift due to it changes sign under a parity transformation. However, since d is a vector, its expectation value in a state |ψ⟩ must be proportional to ⟨ψ| &quot;J&quot; |ψ⟩, that is the expected spin. Thus, under time reversal, an invariant state must have vanishing EDM. In other words, a non-vanishing EDM signals both &quot;P&quot; and &quot;T&quot; symmetry-breaking.

Some molecules, such as water, must have EDM irrespective of whether T is a symmetry. This is correct; if a quantum system has degenerate ground states that transform into each other under parity, then time reversal need not be broken to give EDM.

Experimentally observed bounds on the electric dipole moment of the nucleon currently set stringent limits on the violation of time reversal symmetry in the strong interactions, and their modern theory: quantum chromodynamics. Then, using the CPT invariance of a relativistic quantum field theory, this puts strong bounds on strong CP violation.

Experimental bounds on the electron electric dipole moment also place limits on theories of particle physics and their parameters.

===Kramers&#x27; theorem===
For &quot;T&quot;, which is an anti-unitary &quot;Z&quot;2 symmetry generator
: &quot;T&quot;2 = &quot;UKUK&quot; = &quot;UU&quot;* = &quot;U&quot; (&quot;U&quot;T)−1 = Φ,

where Φ is a diagonal matrix of phases. As a result, and , showing that
:&quot;U&quot; = Φ &quot;U&quot; Φ.

This means that the entries in Φ are ±1, as a result of which one may have either . This is specific to the anti-unitarity of &quot;T&quot;. For a unitary operator, such as the parity, any phase is allowed.

Next, take a Hamiltonian invariant under &quot;T&quot;. Let |&quot;a&quot;⟩ and &quot;T&quot;|&quot;a&quot;⟩ be two quantum states of the same energy. Now, if , then one finds that the states are orthogonal: a result called Kramers&#x27; theorem. This implies that if , then there is a twofold degeneracy in the state. This result in non-relativistic quantum mechanics presages the spin statistics theorem of quantum field theory.

Quantum states that give unitary representations of time reversal, i.e., have , are characterized by a multiplicative quantum number, sometimes called the T-parity.

===Time reversal of the known dynamical laws===
Particle physics codified the basic laws of dynamics into the standard model. This is formulated as a quantum field theory that has CPT symmetry, i.e., the laws are invariant under simultaneous operation of time reversal, parity and charge conjugation. However, time reversal itself is seen not to be a symmetry (this is usually called CP violation). There are two possible origins of this asymmetry, one through the mixing of different flavours of quarks in their weak decays, the second through a direct CP violation in strong interactions. The first is seen in experiments, the second is strongly constrained by the non-observation of the EDM of a neutron.

Time reversal violation is unrelated to the second law of thermodynamics, because due to the conservation of the CPT symmetry, the effect of time reversal is to rename particles as antiparticles and &quot;vice versa&quot;. Thus the second law of thermodynamics is thought to originate in the initial conditions in the universe.

===Time reversal of noninvasive measurements===
Strong measurements (both classical and quantum) are certainly disturbing, causing asymmetry due to the second law of thermodynamics. However,
noninvasive measurements should not disturb the evolution, so they are expected to be time-symmetric. Surprisingly, it is true only in classical physics but not in quantum physics, even in a thermodynamically invariant equilibrium state. This type of asymmetry is independent of CPT symmetry but has not yet been confirmed experimentally due to extreme conditions of the checking proposal.

===Negative group delay in quantum systems===
In 2024, experiments by the University of Toronto showed that under certain quantum conditions, photons can exhibit &quot;negative time&quot; behavior. When interacting with atomic clouds, photons appeared to exit the medium before entering it, indicating a negative group delay, especially near atomic resonance. Using the cross-Kerr effect, the team measured atomic excitation by observing phase shifts in a weak probe beam. The results showed that atomic excitation times varied from negative to positive, depending on the pulse width. For narrow pulses, the excitation time was approximately -0.82 times the non-post-selected excitation time (τ₀), while for broader pulses, it was around 0.54 times τ₀. These findings align with theoretical predictions and highlight the non-classical nature of quantum mechanics, opening new possibilities for quantum computing and photonics.

Due in part to the high rate of poverty in the community, both Ware Shoals Primary School and Ware Shoals Elementary Middle School are designated as Title I schools.

== History ==
Ware Shoals is the site of an old water wheel gristmill, which William Ware operated in the early 19th century at Rutledge Ford on the Saluda River.

Senator Nathaniel Barksdale Dial of Laurens County envisioned the possibility of damming this river to power a cotton mill. Dial started the project, but ran out of funds before the power plant was completed. Benjamin D. Riegel then bought the project from Dial and founded both the Ware Shoals Manufacturing Company and the town of Ware Shoals in 1902. The construction of a power plant was completed in 1904 as a prelude to the construction of a state-of-the-art textile mill in 1906. That power plant originally provided for 4,800 horse power. The mill contained 30,000 spindles. By 1916 a new mill was constructed containing 70,200 spindles and 1,300 looms.

From 1904 to 1916, the population of Ware Shoals grew from two men employed to maintain the newly constructed power plant to 2,000. By the 1960s the mill employed 5,000 people. The founders of the mill and the original officers of the Ware Shoals Manufacturing Corporation were Benjamin Riegel, president and treasurer; James MacEnroe, assistant treasurer; and R. S. Oliver secretary. MacEnroe was instrumental in the construction of the town&#x27;s first school at the cost of $20,000. The mill employed the school&#x27;s eight teachers and required many of its employees and their children to attend classes.

Benjamin Riegel helped organize the town&#x27;s first church when he brought a Presbyterian preacher, Rev. J.M. Dallas. That first church building was intended as a union church building and the Methodists and Presbyterians used it together, while the Baptists constructed their own facility.

By 1916, the town was as new and modern as any in South Carolina. In addition to the cotton mill and the school, the Ware Shoals Manufacturing Corporation, later known as Riegel Textile Corporation, helped give the town electric lights, water and sewerage and good streets. The mill operated a bank, a railway, an ice factory, a cotton gin and a cotton seed oil mill. A community center was built by the textile company at a cost of $40,000.

&quot;The People&#x27;s Amusement Hall&quot; is what Benjamin Riegel set out to build, but was so proud of it that he named it the Katherine Hall in honor of his daughter. Katherine Hall at various times housed or hosted a movie theater, the community library, a Masonic Lodge, a pool hall, a teen canteen as well as showers and dressing rooms for the adjacent public swimming pool.

The mill also operated a department store, or company store, as was common in mill towns through the South. The store began as a one-room shanty in 1906. By 1920, a newly constructed store was on its way to becoming one of the best and most modern department stores in the state. There was a soda fountain where the community members socialized, toy department, pharmacy, candy counter, men&#x27;s shop, ladies&#x27; ready-to-wear section, furniture department, bargain basement, grocery store, and cloth shop. The store&#x27;s motto was &quot;You can buy in one store anything from a paper and pen to a Ford automobile, from a baby girl&#x27;s rattle to her wedding dress.&quot;

In 1926 a large school building was constructed to accommodate the Caucasian students. This building is still used today as the Ware Shoals High School and remains one of the oldest South Carolina school buildings still in use.

Riegel Stadium was built in 1931. The stadium was first used for football games in 1934. Lighting was installed a year later, allowing night games as well. Through the decades, Riegel Stadium has hosted high school teams, textile baseball leagues, and the Negro baseball leagues. In 1954, the stadium hosted an exhibition game between the Cincinnati Red Legs and The Washington Senators.

In 1939 muralist Alice Kindler was commissioned by the WPA to complete a mural for the local post office. The WPA was a New Deal agency that employed individuals to carry out public works projects. The mural was completed in 1940 and titled, &quot;American Landscape&quot;.Beginning in the 1940s, &quot;The Big Friendly&quot; began an early shopper loyalty program by conducting a drawing just before Christmas to award an automobile to one lucky patron. &quot;The Big Friendly&quot; remained a central part of life in Ware Shoals until its closing in 1963. It soon became the SEO, or Southern Executive Offices of the Riegel Textile Corporation. With the closing of the mill and the end of Riegel Textile, the town bought the building and located its City Hall in the now-historic building.

In the 1950s, the Emma Maddox School was completed for African American students. Maddox was a stern disciplinarian and much respected teacher and principal. The Emma Maddox Building of the current Ware Shoals Middle School was named in her honor, in recognition of her contributions to the educational, spiritual and civic lives of African Americans in the greater Ware Shoal&#x27;s area. When public schools were integrated in 1969, Emma Maddox School became the middle school for all students in the community.

Portions of the movie &quot;Leatherheads&quot; was filmed in Ware Shoals.

The Ware Shoals Inn was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007.

==Education==
Ware Shoals is contained within Greenwood School District 51, also known as the Ware Shoals School District. Areas in all three counties are within this school district:

The district is home to Ware Shoals Primary School, Ware Shoals Elementary Middle School, and Ware Shoals High School. The high school is especially unique in that its library serves both the school and the public as a branch of the Greenwood County Library System.

<text>Clemson () is a city in Pickens and Anderson counties in the U.S. state of South Carolina. Clemson is adjacent to Clemson University, and is identified with it. In 2015, &quot;the Princeton Review&quot; cited the town of Clemson as ranking #1 in the United States for &quot;town-and-gown&quot; relations with its resident university. The population of the city was 17,681 at the 2020 census.

Clemson is part of the Greenville-Anderson-Greer, SC Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included in the Greenville-Spartanburg-Anderson, SC Combined Statistical Area.

==History==
European Americans settled here after the Cherokee were forced to cede their land in 1819. They had lived at Keowee, and six other towns along the Keowee River as part of their traditional homelands in the Southeast. They migrated and settled in Tennessee and deeper into Georgia and Alabama, before most were subjected to forced Indian Removal in 1839 to Indian Territory (now Oklahoma).

The community was originally named Calhoun. Clemson University, founded in 1889 and located adjacent to Clemson, has developed as a large public university that defines the town and serves as a cultural center. Its campus developed south of the original town. This was renamed as Clemson in 1943, reflecting its identification with the university. A small, multi-block downtown has some housing, retail and restaurants.

The university provides housing for students, but many students live off campus in a wide variety of apartment complexes. Outside the downtown, there are few paved sidewalks, but some streets have bike paths. The city&#x27;s comprehensive plan has a historic preservation component to apply to keep a range of structures in the area.

The Clemson (train) Depot, built in 1893, was renovated in 2001; it now houses the local chamber of commerce and visitor center. The station was temporarily closed in 2016 for a road project, but was reopened in 2019. U.S. Route 123 runs along the northern end of the city and its edges have been developed with typical suburban-style shopping centers.

===Development of Clemson College/University===
Clemson University was founded as an agricultural college starting in 1889, on the former Fort Hill Plantation of statesman John C. Calhoun, which he had acquired by marriage. The plantation was originally owned by his mother-in-law, mother of his wife Floride. Floride Calhoun inherited the property after her mother&#x27;s death in 1836 but, under South Carolina law, she likely lost any individual rights to it because of her marriage.

In the meantime, Floride and John C. Calhoun had a daughter named Anna Maria. At age 21, she married Thomas Green Clemson. After her father John C. Calhoun died in 1850; his widow Floride Calhoun gained total ownership of Fort Hill Plantation.

Because Anna Maria was the only living child, she inherited a part of Fort Hill when Floride died in 1866. Anna Maria bequeathed Thomas G. Clemson a portion of the property in her will. When Anna Maria died in 1875, he inherited the plantation. He knew that Anna Maria had wanted the land to be used as the site of an agricultural college, so Thomas Green Clemson bequeathed land for such a college in his will. After his death in 1888, what developed as Clemson University was founded on that land.

The portion of Clemson within Pickens County is in the Pickens County School District, which covers the entire county. Students living in the city of Clemson attend Clemson Elementary School, RC Edwards Middle School and D.W. Daniel High School.

Clemson Elementary School was originally called the Calhoun-Clemson School and was on College Avenue. In 1964, the school burned down, destroying everything but the cafeteria, and the newer first and second grade wing, a separate building. The school was rebuilt on Frontage Road and was named Margaret Morrison Elementary School. The once segregated Calhoun Colored School was renamed Morrison annex and was used to house the primary grades and self-contained resource students. After the schools had outgrown their buildings, construction began in 1999 on a new school building on Berkeley Drive. This is now the site of the current Clemson Elementary. Clemson Elementary colors are orange and blue, and its mascot is the tiger cub.

RC Edwards was built and opened in 1971, and named for the President of Clemson University. It currently educates sixth-, seventh- and eighth-graders. The campus is located in Central, and has about 800 students. Its colors are purple and white, and the mascot is the panther.

As the university is not in the City of Clemson corporate limits, the university does not have to abide by City of Clemson municipal ordinances nor receive permission to do any undertaking from the City of Clemson. The South Carolina General Assembly designated Clemson University as a &quot;municipal corporation&quot; in 1894.

<doc id="151020" wikidata="Q121130" url="?curid=151020" title="Philip of Swabia">
<text>Philip of Swabia (February/March 1177 – 21 June 1208), styled Philip II in his charters, was a member of the House of Hohenstaufen and King of Germany from 1198 until his assassination.

The death of Philip&#x27;s older brother Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor, in 1197 meant that the Hohenstaufen rule (which reached as far as the Kingdom of Sicily) collapsed in imperial Italy and created a power vacuum to the north of the Alps. Reservations about the kingship of Henry&#x27;s underage son, Frederick, led to two royal elections in 1198, which resulted in the German throne dispute: the two elected kings, Philip of Swabia and Otto of Brunswick, claimed the throne for themselves. Both opponents tried in the following years through European and papal support, with the help of money and gifts, through demonstrative public appearances and rituals, to decide the conflict for oneself by raising ranks or by military and diplomatic measures. Philip was able to increasingly assert his kingship against Otto in the north part of the Alps. However, at the height of his power, he was assassinated in 1208. This ended the dispute for the throne; his opponent Otto quickly found recognition. Philip was the first German king to be murdered during his reign. In posterity, Philip is one of the little-noticed Hohenstaufen rulers.

==Life==
===Early years===

Philip was born in or near Pavia in the Imperial Kingdom of Italy as the tenth child and eighth (but fifth and youngest surviving) son of Frederick Barbarossa, King of Germany and Holy Roman Emperor and his second wife Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy. His paternal family was the noble House of Hohenstaufen, the name given to the dynasty by historians since the 15th century. The origins of the family are still unclear today; the ancestors on the paternal side were minor nobles and their names have not been preserved. All that is known about Barbarossa&#x27;s great-grandfather Frederick of Büren is that he married a woman named Hildegard (whose own parentage was disputed: she was a member of either the Comital family of Egisheim–Dagsburg or the obscure Schlettstadt family). A few years ago it was assumed that the Schlettstadt property did not belong to Hildegard but to her husband himself and the Hohenstaufen were therefore not a Swabian but an Alsatian family. It wasn&#x27;t until around 1100 that the family under Duke Frederick I of Swabia located into the East Swabian Rems valley.

Much more important for the Hohenstaufen family was the prestigious connection with the Salian dynasty. Frederick Barbarossa&#x27;s grandmother was Agnes, a daughter of Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor. Philip&#x27;s father saw himself as a direct descendant of the first Salian ruler Conrad II, to whom he referred several times as his ancestor in documents. After the extinction of the Salian dynasty in the male line in 1125 firstly Frederick II, Duke of Swabia (Barbarossa&#x27;s father) and then his brother Conrad tried in vain to claim the royal dignity invoking his descent from the Salians. In 1138, Conrad III was finally elected King of Germany, being the first scion of the Swabian Hohenstaufen dynasty to be elected King of the Romans, against the fierce resistance of the rival House of Welf. In 1152 the royal dignity passed smoothly to Conrad III&#x27;s nephew, Frederick Barbarossa, who was also Holy Roman Emperor from 1155 onwards. Barbarossa became embroiled in a conflict with Pope Alexander III. It was not until 1177 that the long standing conflict of the Emperor with the Pope and the Italian cities of the Lombard League could be resolved in the Treaty of Venice.

The Hohenstaufen had never used the name Philip before. The prince was named after the Archbishop Philip of Cologne, who was an important helper and confidante of Barbarossa at this time. The name of the Archbishop of Cologne was thus accepted into a royal family. For historian Gerd Althoff, this demonstrative honor makes &quot;Barbarossa&#x27;s preparations for the confrontation with Henry the Lion tangible&quot;. A little later, the Archbishop of Cologne played a key role in the overthrow of the powerful Duke of Bavaria and Saxony.

As a child, Philip was initially prepared for an ecclesiastical career. He learned to read and also learned Latin, and was placed at the Premonstratensian Monastery in Adelberg for his further education. From April 1189 to July 1193 Philip was provost at the collegiate church of Aachen Cathedral, while his father left Germany for the Third Crusade in 1189, but he drowned in the Göksu (Saleph) River in Anatolia the next year. In 1190 or 1191 Philip was elected Prince-bishop of Würzburg, though without being consecrated, probably due to intervention of his brother Henry VI. In 1186 Henry VI married with Constance, the aunt of the reigning King William II of Sicily; this gave the Hohenstaufen the possibility of a union of the Kingdom of Sicily with the Holy Roman Empire (&quot;unio regni ad imperium&quot;). As a result, however, the relationship with the Pope deteriorated, because the Holy See wanted to maintain the feudal claim over the Kingdom of Sicily. In the spring of 1193 Philip forsook his ecclesiastical calling, perhaps because of the childlessness of the imperial couple; also, Philip&#x27;s three other brothers were also without male heirs: Duke Frederick VI of Swabia had already died in 1191 and Conrad of Rothenburg, who succeeded him as Duke of Swabia, was unmarried. In addition, Otto I, Count Palatine of Burgundy, although already married, had no male descendants yet. However, the concerns of the imperial couple turned out to be unfounded. Empress Constance gave birth to a son on 26 December 1194 in Jesi, the later Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor. While the Emperor was absent, the princes elected his two-year-old son Frederick as King of the Romans in Frankfurt at the end of 1196; with this move, Henry VI wanted to see his succession secured before he prepared for the Crusade of 1197.

To improve relationships with the Byzantine Empire, in April 1195 Henry VI betrothed Philip to Irene Angelina, a daughter of Emperor Isaac II and the widow of junior King Roger III of Sicily, a lady who was described by Walther von der Vogelweide as &quot;the rose without a thorn, the dove without guile&quot;: she was among those taken prisoner by Henry VI when he invaded Sicily in 1194. In early 1195, Philip accompanied his imperial brother on his journey to Sicily and at Easter 1195 he was made Margrave of Tuscany, receiving the disputed Matildine lands; in his retinue in Italy was the Minnesinger Bernger von Horheim. Philip&#x27;s rule in Tuscany there earned him the enmity of Pope Celestine III, who excommunicated him. On 3 May 1196, Philip was documented for the last time as Margrave of Tuscany. After the murder of his brother Conrad in August 1196, Philip succeeded him as Duke of Swabia. The marriage of Philip and Irene Angelina (renamed Maria upon her wedding) probably took place at Pentecost (25 May) 1197 in the Gunzenle hill near Augsburg. Five daughters were certainly born from the union:

* Beatrix (April/June 1198 – 11 August 1212), who married her father&#x27;s rival, Emperor Otto IV on 22 July 1212 and died three weeks later without issue.
* Maria (1199/1200 – 29 March 1235), who married the future Duke Henry II of Brabant before 22 August 1215 and had issue.
* Kunigunde (February/March 1202 – 13 September 1248), who married King Wenceslaus I of Bohemia in 1224 and had issue.
* Elisabeth (March/May 1205 – 5 November 1235), who married King Ferdinand III of Castile on 30 November 1219 and had issue.
* Daughter (posthumously born and died 20/27 August 1208). She and her mother died following childbirth complications.

Sources identified two short-lived sons, Reinald and Frederick, also born from the union of Philip and Irene-Maria Angelina, being both buried at Lorch Abbey alongside their mother. However, there were no contemporary sources who could ascertain their existence without doubt.

===Struggle for the throne===
====Outbreak of the conflict====

Philip enjoyed his brother Henry VI&#x27;s confidence to a very great extent, and appears to have been designated as guardian for the king&#x27;s minor son, in the event of his early death. In September 1197 Philip had set out to fetch Frederick from Apulia for his coronation as King of the Romans in Aachen. While staying in Montefiascone, he heard of Henry VI&#x27;s sudden death in Messina on 28 September 1197 and returned at once to Germany. He appears to have desired to protect the interests of his nephew and to quell the disorder which arose on Henry VI&#x27;s death: On 21 January 1198, Philip issued a charter for the citizens of Speyer, in which he indicated that he was acting in the name of King Frederick; however, he was overtaken by events.

Meanwhile, a number of Princes of the Holy Roman Empire hostile to the ruling Hohenstaufen dynasty under the leadership of Prince-Archbishop Adolph of Cologne took the occasion to elect a German anti-king in the person of the Welf Otto of Brunswick, the second surviving son of the former Saxon duke Henry the Lion and a nephew of King Richard I of England. He was by no means Adolph&#x27;s preferred candidate, because the Archdiocese of Cologne had benefited considerably from the fall of the powerful Duke Henry the Lion. Rather, a group of financially strong citizens ran Otto&#x27;s election. In exchange for his support, the Archbishop was able to reduce the high debt burden of his diocese. The hostility to the kingship of a child was growing, so Philip was chosen by Ghibellines as defender of the empire during Frederick&#x27;s minority, and Otto I of Burgundy, the only living elder brother of Philip who was passed over for being considered inefficient and busy solving problems in his own fief, also supported him. He finally consented to his own election at Nordhausen. On 6 March 1198, in front of the ecclesiastical and secular greats present in Ichtershausen, he declared his willingness to be elected king. Two days later (8 March) Philip was elected German King at Mühlhausen in Thuringia. The election took place on Laetare Sunday, a day that was of considerable symbolic importance in the Hohenstaufen royal tradition. Otherwise there were a number of symbolic deficits: Although backed in the election by Duke Leopold VI of Austria, Duke Ottokar I of Bohemia, Duke Berthold V of Zähringen, and Landgrave Hermann I of Thuringia, all the three Rhenish Archbishops (Cologne, Mainz and Trier), who traditionally performed an important ceremonial act of institution, were absent from Philip&#x27;s election, and Mühlhausen was an unusual location for a king&#x27;s election. For Mühlhausen, in the Hohenstaufen period up to Philip&#x27;s election as king, only one single residence as a ruler can be proven. With this choice of location, Philip may have wanted to symbolically erase the humiliation that his great-uncle Conrad III suffered in autumn 1135 in Mühlhausen during his submission to Lothair III. Instead, the Imperial Regalia (crown, sword and orb) were in Philip&#x27;s possession. His rival Otto was only elected on 9 June 1198 in Cologne by Archbishop Adolph (who had bought the votes of the absent archbishops). Only the Bishop of Paderborn, Bishop Thietmar of Minden, and three Prince-Provosts took part in the election of the Welf. After his election, Philip failed to make up for the coronation quickly. Rather, he moved to Worms next to his confidant, Bishop Luitpold. The hesitant behavior of Philip gave Otto the opportunity to be crowned by the rightful coronator (&quot;Königskröner&quot;) Adolph of Cologne on 12 July 1198 at the traditional royal place in Aachen, which had to be captured before against the resistance of loyal Hohenstaufen liensmen.

In an empire without a written constitution, a solution had to be found under the conditions of a consensual system of rule where there were competing claims. These habits were agreed upon through consultation at court meetings, synods, or other gatherings. The consensus thus established was the most important process for establishing order in the Middle Ages. In the controversy for the German throne, one of the rivals was only able to prevail in the long term if the other side was offered noticeable compensation. With inferior opponent a balance had to be found of him to abandon the kingship while preserving his honor easier.

In the first few months after his election as king, Philip failed to issue documents and thereby assert his kingship. His first surviving royal document, issued to Bishop Bertram of Metz, dated from Worms on 27 June 1198. Two days later, Philip forged an alliance with King Philip II of France. In Mainz Cathedral on 8 September 1198, it wasn&#x27;t the Archbishop of Cologne, as usual, but Archbishop Aymon II of Tarentaise who crowned Philip as German King. It is uncertain whether his wife was also crowned alongside him. Despite these violations of the &quot;consuetudines&quot; (Customs) when he was elected and crowned as King, Philip was able to unite the majority of the princes behind him. For the princes, property, ancestry and origins were essential for their support of Philip. Nevertheless, he knew that he had to settle the conflict with Otto and his supporters. A first attempt to mediate by Archbishop Conrad of Mainz in 1199 was rejected by the Welf.

Both sides strived for the coronation as Holy Roman Emperor by Pope Innocent III and with it the recognition of their rule. The pontiff himself acted tactically before decided on one of the conflicting parties; this gave the opportunity to contact the Holy See several times through letters and embassies. Pope Innocent III wanted to prevent by all means the &quot;unio regni ad imperium&quot; (the reunification of the Holy Roman Empire and the Kingdom of Sicily, whose liege lord he was and wanted to remain) and he was also concerned about the Hohenstaufen claims to central Italy. For the pontiff, the question of obedience was a decisive factor in determining which candidate would have the papal recognition (&quot;favor apostolicus&quot;). In contrast to Otto, Philip expressed himself much more cautiously towards the Pope on this question.

In the first months of 1199, the Welf party asked for confirmation of the decision and for an invitation from the Pope for Otto IV to be crowned Holy Roman Emperor. On 28 May 1199, the supporters of the Hohenstaufen drew the Speyer Prince Declaration (&quot;Speyerer Fürstenerklärung&quot;), whereby they rejected any papal exertion of influence on the Imperial line of succession. At this point in time, Philip could have 4 archbishops, 23 imperial bishops, 4 imperial abbots and 18 secular imperial princes behind him; they confidently appealed to the princely majority and announced the march to Rome for the imperial coronation.

At the turn of the year 1200/01, the Pope subjected the candidates for the imperial coronation to a critical examination. In the Bull &quot;Deliberatio domni pape Innocentii super facto imperii de tribus electis&quot;, the Pope set out the reasons for and against the suitability of the respective candidates: Philip&#x27;s nephew Frederick II was put aside due to his youth, and Philip himself was in the eyes of the Pope as &quot;the son of a race of persecutors&quot; of the church (&quot;genus persecutorum&quot;) because his father Frederick Barbarossa had fought against the Papacy for years. In contrast, Otto&#x27;s ancestors were always loyal followers of the church. Otto had also sworn extensive concessions to the Holy See in the Neuss oath on 8 June 1201, assuring him that he would not strive for a union of the Holy Roman Empire with the Kingdom of Sicily. Thus, the Pope chose the Welf and excommunicated Philip and his associates. The papal judgment for Otto had no major effect in the empire.

====Consolidation of rule====

From then on, both kings tried to win over the undecided or opponents. In order to achieve this goal, there were fewer major decisive battles, but personal bonds between rulers and greats had to be strengthened. This happened because faithful, relatives and friends were favored by gifts or the transfer of imperial property, or by a marriage policy that was supposed to strengthen partisanship or promote a change of party. In an aristocratic society both rivals for the German throne this had regard for the rank and reputation of the great, on their honor take. 

In the next few years of the controversy for the throne, the acts of representation of power were of immense importance, because in them not only the kingship was on display, but the role of the great in the respective system of rule was revealed. Philip did little to symbolically represent his kingship. In 1199, Philip and Irene-Maria celebrated Christmas with tremendous splendor (&quot;cum ingenti magnificentia&quot;) in Magdeburg —close to Otto&#x27;s residence in Brunswick—in the presence of the Ascanian Duke Bernard of Saxony and numerous Saxon and Thuringian nobles. Contemporary sources had criticized the large expenditures on farm days as a waste, assuming a consistent modernization and more effective rulership; more recent studies, however, see the expenses of the court festival less as useless expenditure, but as a result of the goal of acquiring fame and honor. The Magdeburg Court Day at Christmas is considered to be the first high point in the fight for royal dignity. Some of the princes present expressed their first public support for the Hohenstaufen by participating. The chronicler of the &quot;Gesta&quot; of the Bishops of Halberstadt and the poet (&quot;Minnesänger&quot;) Walther von der Vogelweide were present. Walther&#x27;s description of the great splendor of Magdeburg Court festivities in a series of poems and songs called &quot;The Saying for Christmas in Magdeburg&quot; (&quot;Spruch zur Magdeburger Weihnacht&quot;) in order to spread the reputation of Philip as a capable ruler. Philip&#x27;s ability to rule as a king should be demonstrated by the rich clothing and the stately appearance of the participants in the festival. On Christmas Day the king went in a solemn procession with his splendidly dressed wife to the service under the crown. The Saxon Duke Bernard carried the king&#x27;s sword in front of him and showed his support for the Hohenstaufen. The sword bearer service was not only an honorable distinction, as research has long assumed, but according to historian Gerd Althoff was also a sign of demonstrative subordination. In such event, personal ties were emphasized, because Bernard himself had intended in 1197 to fight for royal dignity. In addition, Bernard saw himself best protected against the possible expropriation of his Duchy of Saxony by the Welf through his support of the Hohenstaufen. The elevation of the bones of the Empress Cunigunde of Luxembourg, who was canonized by the Pope in 1200, was solemnly celebrated in Magdeburg Cathedral on 9 September 1201 in Philip&#x27;s presence.

Also in 1201, Philip was visited by his cousin Boniface of Montferrat, the leader of the Fourth Crusade. Although Boniface&#x27;s exact reasons for meeting with Philip are unknown, while at Philip&#x27;s court he also met Alexius Angelus, Philip&#x27;s brother-in-law. Some historians have suggested that it was here that Alexius convinced Boniface, and later the Venetians, to divert the Crusade to Constantinople and restore Isaac II to the throne, as he had recently been deposed by his brother Alexius III, Alexius and Irene-Maria&#x27;s uncle.

In contrast to his father Frederick Barbarossa, marriage projects with foreign royal families were out of the question for Philip; his marriage policy was exclusively related to the dispute for the German throne. In 1203 he tried to find a balance with the Holy See through a marriage project, in which Philip wanted to arranged the betrothal of one of his daughters with a nephew of Pope Innocent III. However, Philip did not agree with important points required by the Pope, such as carrying out a crusade, returning unlawfully confiscated goods to the Roman Church or concession to canonical elections, which was why the marriage negotiations with the Pope failed.

In contrast to Otto, Philip was ready to honor the achievements of his loyal followers. The Hohenstaufen was able to attract high-ranking Welf supporters to his side through gifts and rewards. Rewarding the faithful was one of the most important duties of the ruler. Duke Ottokar I of Bohemia received the royal dignity in 1198 for his support. Philip rewarded Count Wilhelm II of Jülich with valuable gifts for his expressed will to win over all of Otto&#x27;s important supporters for the Hohenstaufen. Otto, however, refused to give his brother Henry, the city of Braunschweig and Lichtenberg Castle in the spring of 1204. Henry then went over to the Hohenstaufen side. For his change of loyalty, not only was the County Palatine of the Rhine restored to him by Philip, but he was also enfeoffed with the &quot;Vogtei&quot; over Goslar and rewarded with monetary payments. The change of the Count Palatine was decisive for a broad movement away from the Welf.

During the siege of Weißensee on 17 September 1204, Landgrave Hermann of Thuringia humbly submitted to the Hohenstaufen. It is the only case of submission (&quot;deditio&quot;) through which the historical sources provide detailed information. According to chronicler Arnold of Lübeck, Philip held up to the Landgrave &quot;while he was lying on the ground for so long&quot; about his &quot;disloyalty and stupidity&quot;. Only after the intercession of those present was he lifted from the floor and received the peace kiss from the King. Hermann had initially supported Otto, switched to Philip in 1199 and then again joined Otto in 1203/04. The Landgrave was able to retain his title and property after his submission and stayed in the Hohenstaufen side until Philip was murdered.

In November 1204 Archbishop Adolph of Cologne and Duke Henry I of Brabant also switched to Philip&#x27;s side in Koblenz. The Duke of Brabant received Maastricht and Duisburg and the Archbishop of Cologne was able to retain his position in the election and ordination of a King and was rewarded with 5,000 marks for sided with Philip. The growing money traffic in the High Middle Ages influenced the princes in their decisions for military support or in the question of their partisanship. With the transfer of the Archbishop of Cologne to his side, Philip&#x27;s documentary production also increased considerably. However, the majority of Cologne&#x27;s citizens remained on the Welf&#x27;s side. The support commitments of Archbishop Adolph and Henry I of Brabant were the first one documented since the Hohenstaufen-Zähringen agreement from 1152. The double election is therefore also seen as a turning point, as it marked the beginning of written alliances in the northern Alpine empire. The number of contracts concluded also rose during the controversy for the throne. However, these written agreements were regularly broken for political reasons. The nobles tried to use the political situation to expand their regional principalities. Landgrave Hermann of Thuringia, Philip&#x27;s cousin, changed sides five times between the outbreak of the controversy and the election of Frederick II in September 1211. According to historian Stefan Weinfurter, the relativization of the oath by the Pope was also essential for the breach of contract. Pope Innocent III advised the spiritual and secular princes to submit to his judgment only. With the Duke of Brabant, Philip strengthens ties in 1207 with the betrothal of his daughter Maria with Henry, heir of the Duchy of Brabant. As a result, Henry I should be closely tied to the Hohenstaufen monarchy.

After the protracted conflicts between the Archbishop of Cologne and Philip, order had to be restored in a demonstrative way. Philip moved into Cologne on the symbolic Palm Sunday. The &quot;adventus&quot; (formally entry to a city) had &quot;the function of a homage, a solemn recognition of the rule of the king&quot;. In addition, numerous Welf supporters on the Lower Rhine and from Westphalia had joined the Hohenstaufen side. Philip has now been able to unite a large number of supporters in the Holy Roman Empire behind him. The basis for Philip&#x27;s success against Otto&#x27;s followers was “a mixture of threats, promises and gifts”. On the occasion of the renewed coronation in Aachen, the Archbishop of Cologne went to meet Philip with “the greatest display of splendor and service” in front of the walls. In this way the Archbishop publicly recognized Philip as monarch. On 6 January 1205, Philip was crowned again with great ceremony at the traditional coronation site in Aachen by the correct coronator (&quot;Königskröner&quot;), the Archbishop of Cologne. With this measure Philip took the honor of the Archbishop into consideration and, by safeguarding his coronation right in Aachen, made submission to the long-fought king acceptable to him. The repetition of the coronation also cleared up the taint of his first coronation in 1198.

On 27 July 1206, Philip defeated a Cologne army loyal to Otto in Wassenberg. This was the only time that the armies of the two kings met. After the battle, the two kings met for the first time. It took place in an atmosphere of confidentiality (&quot;colloquium familiare&quot;) and offered the necessary consideration for the honor of the two kings. Direct negotiations in public were rather unusual at the time. However, the negotiations failed. Pope Innocent III also noticed Otto&#x27;s decline in the empire and a month or two later Philip was loosed from the papal ban. In 1207/08 the Pope approached Philip and negotiations about the imperial coronation began, and also it seemed probable that a treaty was concluded by which were renewed the marriage negotiations of the nephew of the Pope with one of Philip&#x27;s daughters and to receive the disputed territory of Tuscany.

===Court===
From the 12th century the court developed into a central institution of royal and princely rule. It was a “decision-making center and theater of power, consumer and entertainment center, distribution center, broker&#x27;s seat for and for power, money and goods and social opportunities, for tastes, ideas and fashions of all kinds”. Medieval kingship was exercised in an empire without a capital through outpatient rulership practice. Philip had to go through the kingdom and thereby give his rule validity and authority. The greats of the empire gathered for deliberations on the court days. For Philip&#x27;s reign, 28 &quot;Hoftag&quot; are known, of which only 12 took place within the Hohenstaufen sphere of influence. Somewhat more than 630 people can be found at Philip&#x27;s court between 1198 and 1208, of whom around 100 belonged to the King&#x27;s inner court, being &quot;attested in a somewhat more noticeable density in the Hohenstaufen circle&quot;. The Bishops Konrad of Hildesheim, Hartwig of Eichstätt and Konrad IV of Regensburg and especially Konrad of Speyer joined to Philip&#x27;s court. By contrast, none of the secular princes is as closely and frequently attested to at court as Bishop Konrad of Speyer. Duke Bernhard of Saxony, Duke Louis I of Bavaria and Margrave Theodoric I of Meissen probably had the most intensive contact within the court. They had profited significantly from the fall of Henry the Lion and feared that his son Otto IV would gain access to the Welf inheritance. The &quot;ministeriales&quot; had in Henry of Kalden their most outstanding representant: he was not only a military leader, but also influenced Philip&#x27;s politics by arranging a personal encounter with Otto. He is mentioned in more than 30 charters and also in narrative sources.

The most important part of the court was the Chancery. Philip&#x27;s Chancery was in the personal tradition of Henry VI. In other ways, too, Philip&#x27;s document system does not differ from that of his Hohenstaufen predecessors. In contrast to his predecessors, his rival Otto IV and his nephew Frederick II, Philip had few seals. The ducal seals for Tuscany and Swabia as well as a wax seal and a gold bull for the royal period are verifiable. This is probably due to the fact that he did not obtain the imperial crown, because it would have led to a change in title. With his awarding of charters, Philip reached considerably further north, north-west (Bremen, Utrecht, Zutphen) and south-west (Savoy, Valence) to assert his kingship. With the issuing of charters, Philip wanted to bind his followers more closely to himself in these areas as well. His &quot;itinerarium&quot; is shaped like no other ruling rulers from the Hohenstaufen era by the political situation of the controversy for the throne. An almost orderly move through the empire with continuous notarial activity did not take place. Rather, a regionalization of itinerary, awarding of charters and visits to the court can be identified, which historian Bernd Schütte interpreted as a “withdrawal of the royal central authority”.

Philip is considered to be the &quot;first Roman-German ruler whose court can be shown to have courtly poetry and who himself became the subject of courtly poetry.&quot; Walther von der Vogelweide dedicated a special song to the Magdeburg Court Day of 1199, in which he honored Philip as ruler. During his short reign, Philip didn&#x27;t have the opportunity to promote art or build buildings. Spiritual institutions were not particularly promoted by him.

==Death==

Since the end of May 1208, Philip had been preparing for a campaign against Otto IV and his allies. He interrupted the planning to attend the wedding of his niece Countess Beatrice II of Burgundy with Duke Otto of Merania on 21 June in Bamberg. After the marriage, the King retired to his private apartments. In the afternoon he was murdered by Count Otto VIII of Wittelsbach. After the murder, Count Otto VIII was able to flee with his followers. Bishop Ekbert of Bamberg and his brother, Margrave Henry II of Istria, were suspected of having known about the plans. Other medieval historians expressed doubts about complicity or ignored other possible perpetrators.

For the first time since the end of the Merovingian dynasty a king had been murdered. Besides Albert I of Habsburg (1308), Philip is the only Roman-German ruler to be assassinated. No chronicler witnessed the murder. In contemporary sources there is little agreement about the course of the murder. Most medieval chroniclers saw the withdrawal of the promise of marriage as a motive for murder. Even in distant Piacenza, Philip&#x27;s murder was still associated with a failed marriage project. Allegedly the Wittelsbach scion, already known for his unstable character, had fallen into a rage when he learned of the dissolution of his betrothal to Gertrude of Silesia by her father, the Piast Duke Henry I the Bearded, who was apparently informed of Count Otto VIII&#x27;s cruel tendencies and in an act of concern for his young daughter decided to terminate the marriage agreement. Later, after an unfortunate campaign to Thuringia, Philip had betrothed his third daughter Kunigunde to Count Otto VIII in the summer of 1203 in order to make him a reliable ally in the fight against Landgrave Hermann I of Thuringia. In the following years Philip increasingly succeeded in gaining acceptance for his kingship, so the betrothal with the Wittelsbach became without purpose to him; in November 1207 the King engaged Kunigunde to Wenceslaus, son and heir of King Ottokar I of Bohemia, on the &quot;Hoftag&quot; in Augsburg. Philip hoped that this alliance would gain permanent support from Bohemia. For Count Otto VIII this behavior was an act of treason and also felt that his social status was threatened; he swore revenge on the German King, whom he blame for both spurned betrothals, culminating in the murder at Bamberg.

Since historian Eduard Winkelmann&#x27;s careful analysis in the 19th century, research has assumed that Otto VIII of Wittelsbach acted as a lone perpetrator. In contrast, historian Bernd Ulrich Hucker made a “comprehensive conspiratorial plan” in 1998 and suspected a “coup d&#x27;état”. The Andechs Dukes of Merania, King Philip II of France and Duke Henry I of Brabant should have been involved in this comprehensive plot; allegedly, the conspirators had planned to put the Duke of Brabant on the German throne. But Hucker&#x27;s coup hypothesis did not prevail. It remains to be seen what use the French king would have had from the removal of Philip and his replacement by the Duke of Brabant. The House of Andechs, as loyal followers of Philip, who often stayed at his court and were protected by him, had no interest in his death.

==Aftermath==
Philip was initially buried in Bamberg Cathedral, the burial place of Emperor Henry II and King Conrad III. His rival Otto IV let the assassins be persecuted relentlessly and wanted to prove his innocence. Only the &quot;Annales Pegaviensis&quot; (chronicle of the Pegau Abbey) held Otto IV&#x27;s supporters responsible for the murder. Philip&#x27;s widow, Irene-Maria, pregnant at that time, took refuge in Hohenstaufen Castle, dying only two months after the Bamberg regicide as a result of a miscarriage. After Philip&#x27;s death, Otto IV quickly prevailed against the remaining Hohenstaufen supporters, was acknowledged as German monarch at an Imperial Diet in Frankfurt in November 1208 and crowned Holy Roman Emperor by Pope Innocent III the next year. For the new fully recognized German King, the most important goal was to restore order in the realm. A &quot;Landfrieden&quot; was established for this purpose and the Imperial ban on Philip&#x27;s murderer and alleged accomplices, the Andechs brothers Bishop Ekbert of Bamberg and Margrave Henry II of Istria, was imposed. As a result, they lost all offices, rights and property. In addition, Otto IV&#x27;s engagement to Beatrix, Philip&#x27;s eldest daughter, was agreed. Philip&#x27;s murderer Otto VIII of Wittelsbach (now condemned as &quot;vogelfrei&quot;) was found in March 1209 by &quot;Reichsmarschall&quot; Henry of Kalden in a granary on the Danube near Regensburg and beheaded. The Andechs brothers, however, were politically rehabilitated three years later.

However, Otto IV soon entered into conflict with Pope Innocent III when he tried to conquer the Kingdom of Sicily in 1210, which led to his excommunication. The Welf lost the consensus on his rule in the part of the empire north of the Alps, and part of the princes renounced to their vow of obedience to Otto IV and chose Philip&#x27;s nephew Frederick II as a rival emperor (&quot;alium imperatorem&quot;). In 1212 Frederick II moved to the northern part of the empire. At the turn of the year 1213/14, Frederick II&#x27;s rule in the empire north of the Alps was not yet secured. In this situation, Frederick II had Philip&#x27;s remains transferred from Bamberg to Speyer. Personally, Frederick II does not seem to have come to Bamberg for the transfer of the body. Bamberg was possibly avoided by the later Hohenstaufen rulers because of Philip&#x27;s murder. At Christmas 1213 Philip&#x27;s mortal remains were re-interred in Speyer Cathedral, which was considered a memorial of the Salian-Staufen dynasty and was the most important burial place of the Roman-German kingship. By transferring there his uncle Philip&#x27;s remains, Frederick II was able to gain the trust of the Hohenstaufen partisans and strengthened his position against his opponents. From the mid-13th century, the death anniversary of Philip was celebrated in Speyer in a way similar to that of the Salian Emperor Henry IV. Philip is the last Roman-German king who is listed in both medieval dead books of the Speyer Cathedral. The Bamberg Horseman, a figure carved in stone on Bamberg Cathedral around 1235, has repeatedly been referred to as Philip; so historian Hans Martin Schaller sees in him the attempt to maintain Philip&#x27;s memory. But the figure was also mistaken for either the Roman Emperor Constantine the Great, King Saint Stephen I of Hungary, or Emperors Henry II and Frederick II.

===Medieval judgements===
Many chroniclers saw the divine order represented by the ruler as a result of the conflict between the two kings for the throne. Philip is described in detail in the chronicle of the premonstratensian priest Burchard of Ursperg. Burchard wrote a continuation of the World Chronicle (&quot;Chronicon universale&quot;) of Ekkehard of Aura and Frutolf of Michelsberg in 1229/30. The chronicle is one of the most important sources for the history of the empire at the beginning of the 13th century. For the chronicler (who was loyal to the Hohenstaufen), Philip was of a meek and mild disposition, of affable speech, kind and quite generous, while Otto IV was not named with the title of king until Philip was murdered. Despite great physical strength, the Welf lacked all the important virtues of rulership; for Burchard, he was “haughty and stupid, but brave and tall” (&quot;superbus et stultus, sed fortis videbatur viribus et statura procerus&quot;). The chronicler Arnold of Lübeck, despite being loyal to the Welf dynasty, called Philip an &quot;ornament of virtues&quot;. Arnold portrayed Otto IV&#x27;s rule through the murder of Philip as being cursed by God. The image of Philip in posterity had a major impact on Walther von der Vogelweide, who referred to him in an honorable short form as &quot;young and brave man&quot;.

The Bamberg regicide had no major impact on the further history of the empire. Later chroniclers and annals describe the transition of the royal rule from Philip to Otto IV as smooth. However, after the experience of the dynastic dispute over in the empire, a considerable development spurt began, which led to a rethink in writing down the customs. The &quot;Sachsenspiegel&quot; of Eike of Repgow is an important testimony to this.

===Artistic reception===
In modern times, little was remembered of Philip of Swabia. He fell significantly behind the other Hohenstaufen rulers Frederick Barbarossa and Frederick II. His reign, which was limited to a few years, was never undisputed, and he was never crowned Holy Roman Emperor. In addition, he hadn&#x27;t fought a major conflict with the Pope, in which the alleged failure of the medieval central authority could have been exemplified. In addition, his name cannot be associated with any extraordinary conception of power. Furthermore, his murder could not be instrumentalized for sectarian disputes or for the establishment of a German nation-state in the 19th century.

Representations of the Bamberg regicide are rarely found in history painting. Alexander Zick made a drawing of the murder in 1890, and Karl Friedrich Lessing made a draft without converting it into a painting. On 4 July 1998, Rainer Lewandowski&#x27;s play “The King&#x27;s Murder in Bamberg” was premiered at the E.T.A.-Hoffmann-Theater in Bamberg.

===Historical research===
Historical research of the 19th and early 20th century was hampered by historians anachronistically projecting their contemporary political preferences backwards in time. Due to the contemporary Kulturkampf, nationalist Protestant historians viewed the Catholic church or anything that smacked of ultramontanism extremely negatively. Likewise Kleinstaaterei was seen as a historical calamity and there was a search for culpable parties in history. The historians of the 19th century were therefore interested in a strong monarchical central power and therefore looked for the reasons for the late emergence of a unified German nation state. The &quot;sources of strength of the German nation&quot; were located in the Middle Ages. The kings and emperors were presented as early representatives of a strong monarchical power that was also longed for by the nationalist historians for their own time. The decisive factor for the historians&#x27; judgment was whether the medieval rulers increased the royal development of power over the nobility and the church or whether they were seen to be responsible for the loss of power. The image of history shaped by this aspect emerged after the 1806 dissolution of the HRE and the Wars of Liberation against Napoleon and was heavily colored by romantic nationalism. From this point of view, the German kings and emperors under the Ottonian, Salian and Hohenstaufen dynasties appeared to be extremely powerful, since they had a predominant position in Europe. In the course of the Middle Ages, however, the emperors lost this position of power. The papacy and the princes were held responsible for this. They were considered to be the &quot;gravedigger of the German royal power&quot; for Protestant, nationalist German historiography. Two turning points were considered to be decisive for the central authority&#x27;s loss of power: the first one, was the Road to Canossa by Henry IV in 1077 (where he lost royal influence over the church) and the second one was the double election of 1198. The nobility used their right to vote for kings to obtain privileges from the monarchy and thus expand their own rule. This view of a loss of power for the German kingship through the double election of 1198 has long remained the predominant one. In Karl Bosl&#x27;s work “&quot;Die Reichsministerialität&quot;” from 1950, Philip and Otto IV&#x27;s government signified “a huge, if not perhaps the decisive, setback that the German monarchy suffered in its last attempt to build a state”.

The historical study of Philip of Swabia began in 1852 with the monograph &quot;König Philipp der Hohenstaufe&quot; by Heinrich Friedrich Otto Abel, who made no secret of his sympathies for Philip. Eduard Winkelmann&#x27;s Yearbooks of German History (&quot;Jahrbücher der Deutschen Geschichte&quot;) under Philip of Swabia and Otto IV (1878) became the standard reference work of later historiography. With 541 closely described pages, they are the most detailed account of the Hohenstaufen to date. Winkelmann wrote about Philip that he was &quot;attractive as a person, as a king to be counted among the best and most capable”. In 1866 Wilhelm Grotefend published his dissertation. Unlike Winkelmann and Abel, he passed a damning verdict on Philip. To him, he was regarded as a &quot;dependent, weak personality with a smooth form and graceful appearance, but without nobility of disposition.&quot; The decisive factor for this judgment was that Philip didn&#x27;t fight energetically enough for his kingship and, through the alliance with the French king, granted &quot;the &quot;Erbfeind&quot;&quot; influence over the Holy Roman Empire. In addition, he had allowed to an arrogant Pope and selfish princes to make too many concessions.

Since the 1980s, historical research on the Middle Ages has gained numerous new insights into high medieval royalty. The German royal rule in the Middle Ages was no longer perceived as a history of decline. Rather, the king and the nobility are seen as &quot;natural main partners in the empire&quot;. The older image of the selfish princes who only wanted to weaken the kingship was put into perspective by pointing out that the nobility repeatedly tried to settle the throne dispute. The newer research shifted the focus to the communication and interaction of the ruler with his great ones. Philip&#x27;s actions were no longer questioned about the increase in monarchical power, but rather about the means by which he tried to enforce his kingship in the aristocratic network of relationships.

In contrast to other Staufers, Philip remained a neglected ruler for a long time in medieval studies. For several decades no major accounts of Philip appeared. His murder in Bamberg didn&#x27;t attract the interest of even the Historical Association of Bamberg (&quot;Historischer Verein Bamberg&quot;) in 1908 or 1958. Only recently has Philip received greater attention in historical studies. In 1998, historian Bernd Ulrich Hucker characterized Philip as a &quot;weak king&quot; who was completely dependent on his &quot;ministeriales&quot;, whereby the imperial princes would have lost their influence on the king. He no longer saw the regicide of Bamberg as a private vengeance, but as a “coup d&#x27;état” by important imperial elites. This hypothesis sparked controversial discussions, but did not prevail. Since 2002 the edition of the diplomas of Philip of Swabia has been prepared on behalf of the &quot;Monumenta Germaniae Historica&quot;. The edition published in 2014 has a total of 216 documents and &quot;deperdita&quot; (lost documents that have been handed down in other sources, for example chronicles), including 199 documents from Philip&#x27;s ten-year reign as king, of which around 2/3 are products of his court. Bernd Schütte&#x27;s work, published in 2002, examined the scope of action and the ability to integrate Philip&#x27;s monarchy on the basis of itinerary, award of certificates and court; he contradicted Hucker&#x27;s thesis of a weak kingship of Philip of Swabia. Schütte interpreted the increase in document production from an average of 1.5 pieces per month to just over two pieces due to the transfer of Archbishop Adolph of Cologne in November 1204 as a &quot;yardstick for the recognition of his kingship&quot;. He also found that Philip&#x27;s radius of action had extended beyond the rooms of personal presence through the award of diplomas. In 2003, Peter Csendes published the first modern biography of Philip of Swabia in 130 years. On the 800th anniversary of the murder of Philip in 2008, the Society for Staufer History (&quot;Gesellschaft für staufische Geschichte&quot;) dedicated a volume to Philip. In the working group for regional and local history in the Association of Württemberg History and Antiquity Associations (&quot;Arbeitskreis für Landes- und Ortsgeschichte im Verband der württembergischen Geschichts- und Altertumsvereine&quot;), the spring meeting on 25 April 2008 was entitled &quot;Philipp von Schwaben († 1208) and the rule in the German southwest&quot;. His rule was viewed from a regional historical perspective. A conference also took place in Vienna in May 2008, the contributions of which were published in 2010. Based on the edition of the documents for Philip&#x27;s reign, the studies reveal new possibilities for knowledge.

<text>Piedmont is a census-designated place (CDP) along the Saluda River in Anderson and Greenville counties in the U.S. state of South Carolina. The population was 5,411 at the 2020 census.

Piedmont is a part of the Greenville-Anderson metropolitan area.

==History==

Native Americans and early settlers of Piedmont called the area &quot;Big Shoals of the Saluda&quot; after the Saluda River. The Native Americans used the shoals as a crossing. David Garrison established a grist mill around 1850 upon the shoals changing the name of the area to Garrison Shoals. Henry Pinckney Hammett bought this property for his cotton mill that used water power of the shoals. The name of the area changed again to Piedmont, &quot;foot of the Mountains&quot; and became a mill town. The American Civil War disrupted Hammett&#x27;s project until 1876 when his plant began operations. Piedmont was added to Hammett&#x27;s charter for Piedmont Manufacturing Company and a railroad station. Water power from the Saluda River was also used to produce electricity to run the machinery from the 1880s to the 1920s. The machinery of the Piedmont Manufacturing Company was from Saco Lowell and Whitin Machine Works that helped finance Hammett&#x27;s company. In 1946 the mills were sold to J.P. Stevens and Company where it then was updated with modern features. Manufacturing continued until 1977 and in 1983 most of Piedmont Manufacturing Company burned down.

<text>Yemassee () is a small Lowcountry town in Beaufort and Hampton counties in the U.S. state of South Carolina. The population was 1,027 at the 2010 census. Yemassee is near the borders of Colleton and Jasper counties. The town is divided by the county line between Beaufort and Hampton counties, which follows the roadbed of the CSX railroad. Most of the town&#x27;s population presently lies within Hampton County (as of 2019). As defined by the U.S. Census Bureau, the Beaufort County portion of Yemassee is included within the Hilton Head Island-Bluffton-Beaufort, SC Metropolitan Statistical Area. Yemassee hosts one of the few commercial breeding facilities of non-human primates in the entire United States, Alpha Genesis, Inc., which serves as a major employer for the town. Also, the Frank Lloyd Wright-designed Auldbrass Plantation house and outbuildings lie just outside the town limits of Yemassee.

==History==
The town takes its name from the Native American tribe of the same name, the Yamasee, which was the most important Indian ally of South Carolina until the Yamasee War of 1715. The first attack that began the Yamasee War occurred in the Yamasee town of Pocotaligo, today part of the town of Yemassee.

The site of the present town is surrounded by both Revolutionary and Civil War sites. The remains of Civil War field fortifications can be observed along U.S. 21 and 17A between Yemassee and Pocotaligo (that section of highway is now a part of Yemassee, as the town has now greatly expanded into Beaufort County. Within the town limits are three historical plantations including Bindon, Cotton Hall, and Tomotley, with the latter two annexed into the town in 2021.

William Gilmore Simms published the novel &quot;The Yemassee: A Romance of Carolina&quot; in the 19th century, and the University of South Carolina in Columbia publishes a literary journal titled &quot;Yemassee&quot;.
The Yemassee Train Depot was the final stop for Marine Corps Recruits to Parris Island for much of the 19th and 20th centuries.

==Geography==

<doc id="151023" wikidata="Q754064" url="?curid=151023" title="Dillo">
<text>Dillo is a minimalistic web browser particularly intended for older or slower computers and embedded systems. It supports only plain HTML/XHTML (with CSS rendering) and images over HTTP and HTTPS; scripting is ignored entirely. Current versions of Dillo can run on Linux, BSD, OS X, IRIX and Cygwin. Due to its small size, it was the browser of choice in several space-conscious Linux distributions. Dillo is free software, released under the GNU GPL-3.0-or-later.

Chilean software engineer Jorge Arellano Cid conceived the Dillo project in late 1999, publishing the first version of Dillo in December of that year. His primary goal in creating Dillo was to democratize access to information. Arellano Cid believed that no one should have to buy a new computer or pay for broadband in order to enjoy the World Wide Web. To this end, he designed Dillo to be small, fast, and efficient, capable of performing well even on an Intel 80486 CPU with a dial-up Internet access.

==Development==
Dillo was originally written in the C programming language with the GTK+ GUI toolkit. The first versions were based on an earlier browser called &quot;Armadillo&quot;, hence the name.

Dillo 2 was written with both C and C++ components and the Fast Light Toolkit (FLTK), and was released on October 14, 2008. Text antialiasing, support for character sets other than Latin-1, HTTP compression capability, and improved page rendering were all added. The move to FLTK from GTK+ also removed many of the project&#x27;s dependencies and reduced Dillo&#x27;s memory footprint by 50%.

In 2011, Dillo-3.x was released, using FLTK-1.3. According to the Changelog, this change was prompted in part by the lack of an official release of FLTK-2, which stopped Dillo-2&#x27;s inclusion in lightweight distributions for which it would otherwise have been suitable.

Jorge Arellano Cid is still Dillo&#x27;s lead developer today. Dillo is funded by private donations; efforts to obtain public grants and corporate sponsors have been unsuccessful. Lack of funding led to a slowdown in development in 2006, and a complete stop in 2007. The project restarted again in 2008 and two months later received a €115 donation from DistroWatch.

==Features==
Features of Dillo include bookmarks, tabbed browsing, and support for JPEG, PNG (including alpha transparency), and GIF images. Partial support for CSS was introduced in release 2.1. Settings such as the default fonts, background color, downloads folder, and home page are customizable through configuration files. Cookies are supported but disabled by default due to privacy concerns. While most web browsers retain the web cache and history after the program is closed, Dillo automatically clears them to improve both privacy and performance.

A developer tool called the &quot;bug meter&quot; is provided in the lower-right corner. When clicked, it displays information about validation problems, such as unclosed tags, that Dillo found in the web page. Unlike most browsers, Dillo does not have a quirks mode to improve compatibility with web pages that use invalid HTML. Instead, Dillo processes all web pages according to the published web standards.

In 2003, two Linux enthusiasts successfully ran Dillo on an Intel 486 processor and demonstrated that even with such meager hardware, Dillo could render Home - BBC News in 10–15 seconds. Furthermore, Dillo can run on a variety of software platforms, including Linux, BSD, Solaris, Mac OS X, DOS, and some handheld devices. However, Dillo&#x27;s developers have made little effort to make the browser work on Microsoft Windows. Arellano Cid stated that Windows goes against Dillo&#x27;s goal of democratization by artificially increasing hardware requirements and software costs. Nevertheless, Dillo has been reported to work on Windows via Cygwin. Additionally, Dillo-Win32 was a project to port Dillo to Windows which is now defunct.
D+ browser or Dplus continues where Dillo-Win32 left off, it&#x27;s forked from the final Dillo-Win32 release (3.0p9) and does not attempt to maintain upstream compatibility with Dillo. Last version is 0.5b (Oct 15, 2013).
Dillo does not support JavaScript, Java, Flash, right-to-left text, or complex text layout. Support for frames is also very limited; Dillo presents a link to each frame to allow the user to view them one at a time.

=== Forks ===
The original domain had expired in June 2022. Developers had lost access to it and a Wordpress zombie lookalike is operating without their oversight ever since.

DilloNG is a fork hosted on GitHub which moved the code from Mercurial while adding new features like a speed dial main page, support for opening videos in an external video player and merged some previously published fixes. It was last updated in 2021.

A fork called Dillo-browser appeared in 2019 forked from the then-current version of DilloNG. It stalled until 2023 when its development resumed and is ongoing as of 2024.

Dillo+ (Dillo-Plus) started in 2023 based on Dillo 3.0.5 source code found in the OpenBSD 6.8 package. It had applied numerous patches from DilloNG and added support for rendering Gopher, Gemini and markdown pages, reader mode and extended CSS support. A new Python scripting system was introduced with modules for rendering RSS, EPUB, public Telegram channel logs and zip file contents. It is still maintained as of 2024.

==Reception==
Reviews of Dillo have praised its extraordinary speed, but noted that this speed comes at a price. The most visible cost is Dillo&#x27;s inability to display complex web pages as they were meant to be. A 2008 review by Linux.com commented that Dillo&#x27;s user interface may be &quot;intimidating&quot; for new users, and pointed out the scarcity of plug-ins for Dillo. In all, Dillo&#x27;s global usage share is less than one hundredth of one percent.

Dillo is, however, the browser of choice in several space-conscious Linux distributions, such as Damn Small Linux, Feather Linux, VectorLinux, antiX and Mustang Linux.

==History==
Although the city of Goose Creek was established in 1961, its history dates back many centuries. In the 1670s the Etiwan moved to the area to escape the Westo, seeking protection among the plantations of early colonists who were often referred to as the &quot;Goose Creek men&quot;, mostly settled a few miles north of Charleston near a stream called Goose Creek, a tributary of the Cooper River. The Goose Creek men became leaders of the early Indian trade, and by the 1690s many held important offices in the colonial government. At first the Goose Creek men dealt mainly in Indian slaves, while later the deerskin trade dominated. Several colonial governors were Goose Creek men, such as James Moore and Robert Daniell. Other prominent men included brothers Daniel and Pierre Bacot.

The Otranto Plantation Indigo Vats and St. James Church are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Portions of the Charleston metropolitan area (Charleston, North Charleston, Goose Creek, and Hanahan) are home to branches of the United States military. During the Cold War, the Naval Base (1902–1996) became the third largest U.S. homeport serving over 80 ships and submarines. In addition, the Charleston Naval Shipyard repaired frigates, destroyers, cruisers, sub tenders, and submarines. The shipyard was also equipped for the refueling of nuclear subs.

During this period, the Weapons Station was the Atlantic Fleet&#x27;s loadout base for all nuclear ballistic missile submarines. Two SSBN &quot;Boomer&quot; squadrons and a sub tender were homeported at the Weapons Station, while one SSN attack squadron, Submarine Squadron 4, and a sub tender were homeported at the Naval Base. At the 1996 closure of the Station&#x27;s Polaris Missile Facility Atlantic (POMFLANT), over 2,500 nuclear warheads and their UGM-27 Polaris, UGM-73 Poseidon, and UGM-96 Trident I delivery missiles (SLBM) were stored and maintained, guarded by a U.S. Marine Corps security force company.

In 2010, the Air Force base (3,877 acres) and Naval Weapons Station (&gt;17,000 acres) merged to form Joint Base Charleston. Today, Joint Base Charleston, encompassing over and supporting 53 military commands and federal agencies, provides service to over 79,000 airmen, sailors, soldiers, Marines, Coast Guardsmen, DOD civilians, dependents, and retirees.

<text>Summerville is a town in the U.S. state of South Carolina situated mostly in Dorchester County, with small portions in Berkeley and Charleston counties. Summerville is seventh biggest city in the state. The town lies approximately five miles from the Ashley River. It is part of the Charleston-North Charleston-Summerville, SC Metropolitan Statistical Area. Summerville&#x27;s population at the 2020 census was 50,915.

==History==
The first settlement in Summerville began following the American Revolutionary War; it was called Pineland Village in 1785. Development in the area resulted from plantation owners who resided in the Charleston area and came to Summerville to escape seasonal insects and their attendant swamp fever.

Summerville became an official town on December 17, 1847. That year, the town passed a law against cutting down trees, the nation&#x27;s first such law, and a $25 fine was issued to anyone who did so without permission. The town&#x27;s official seal reads &quot; (The Pine is Sacred)&quot;.

The 1886 Charleston earthquake affected Summerville, which resulted in a fire that reduced many of the buildings in the town square to ruins. During this earthquake, the Old White Meeting House Ruins and Cemetery, located near Summerville, was also destroyed. Today, Summerville is located within the Middleton Place-Summerville Seismic Zone, which is the most active seismic zone in South Carolina.

In 1899, the International Congress of Physicians (or &quot;Tuberculosis Congress&quot;) listed Summerville as one of the world&#x27;s two best areas for treatment of and recovery from lung and throat disorders, due to its dry and sandy location and the many pine trees that release turpentine derivatives into the air. This notation is credited with aiding Summerville&#x27;s commercial and residential development.

The former Summerville post office built in 1938 contains a mural, &quot;Train Time – Summerville&quot;, painted by Bernadine Custer in 1939. Federally commissioned murals were produced from 1934 to 1943 in the U.S. through the Section of Painting and Sculpture, later called the Section of Fine Arts, of the Treasury Department.

In 2019 Dorchester County announced that it was redeveloping 500 N. Main Street, the biggest tract of land in Downtown Summerville.

<text>North Charleston is a city in Berkeley, Charleston, and Dorchester counties in the U.S. state of South Carolina. As of the 2020 census, North Charleston had a population of 114,852, making it the third-most populous city in the state, and the 248th-most populous city in the United States. North Charleston is a principal city within the Charleston-North Charleston, SC Metropolitan Statistical Area, which had an estimated population of 849,417 in 2023.

==History==
===1680–1901: Plantations===
From the 17th century until the Civil War, plantations cultivated commodity crops, such as rice and indigo. Some of the plantations in what is now North Charleston were:
* Archdale Hall Plantation – dating from 1680, Archdale Hall was on the Ashley River. By 1783, it had grown to almost . Its primary crops were indigo and rice. The plantation was the longest family-owned plantation in South Carolina. It has since been redeveloped into the Archdale subdivision. (Archdale subdivision is not in corporate city limits of, but is surrounded by North Charleston)
* Camp Plantation – dating from 1705, Camp Plantation covered around .
* Elms Plantation – dating from 1682, Elms Plantation was founded by Ralph Izard. Its principal crop was rice. It covered nearly , stretching across parts of what are now the cities of Goose Creek and North Charleston. Charleston Southern University is on part of the original plantation lands.
* French Botanical Garden – established between 1786 and 1796, this small plantation/garden area of was owned and maintained by the French botanist André Michaux. It was closed by Michaux&#x27;s son in 1803. The garden was near what is today the Charleston International Airport, and the parkway connecting Dorchester Road with International Boulevard is named in his honor.
* Marshlands, &quot;Mons Repos&quot; and Retreat plantations – the Retreat Plantation dates from 1672 and the Marshlands Plantation dates from 1682. &quot;Mons Repos&quot; was developed around 1798. The land from all three plantations was acquired by the federal government for development of the Charleston Naval Base and Charleston Naval Shipyard. The Marshlands Plantation&#x27;s main house has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places. To preserve the house, it was moved in 1961 to land at Fort Johnson on James Island and is currently used as offices for the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources.
* Oak Grove Plantation – dating from 1680, Oak Grove originally covered along the Cooper River. By 1750, its owners had expanded the plantation to about .
* Tranquil Hill Plantation – started in 1683, Tranquil Hill was originally known as White Hall Plantation, a name it kept until 1773. Its principal crop was rice. It encompassed about . In the late 20th century, it was redeveloped as the Whitehall residential subdivision.
* Windsor Hill Plantation – established in 1701, Windsor Hill was an inland rice plantation that covered nearly ; parts of the cities of Goose Creek and North Charleston now occupy some of this area. General William Moultrie, victor at the Battle of Sullivan&#x27;s Island in 1776 and governor from 1785 to 1787 and 1792–94, was originally buried here. His remains were exhumed and reburied at Fort Moultrie on Sullivan&#x27;s Island in 1977. The Windsor Hill Plantation subdivision was developed on a portion of the eponymous plantation&#x27;s property.

The large plantations were subdivided into smaller farms in the late 19th century as the urban population began moving northward. Due to the large labor forces of enslaved African Americans who worked these properties for over two centuries, the population of Charleston County in 1870 was 73 percent black; they were freedmen by this time. After the Civil War, phosphate fertilizer plants were developed, with extensive strip mining between the Ashley River and Broad Path (Meeting Street Road). The main route for transportation of these phosphates eventually became known as Ashley Phosphate Road.

===1901–1972: Incorporation===
Since the early 20th century, the section of unincorporated Charleston County that later became North Charleston had been designated by Charleston business and community leaders as a place for the development of industry, military and other business sites. The first industry started in this area was the E.P. Burton Lumber Company. In 1901, the Charleston Naval Shipyard was established with agreements between the federal government and local Charleston city leaders. Shortly thereafter, the General Asbestos and Rubber Company (GARCO) built the world&#x27;s largest asbestos mill under one roof.

In 1912, a group of businessmen from Charleston formed a development company that bought the E.P. Burton Lumber Company tract and began to lay out an area for further development. The Park Circle area was one of the first to be designed and developed, allocating sections for industrial, commercial, and residential usage. Park Circle was planned as one of only two English Garden Style communities in the US, and most of the original planning concept remains today. Some of the streets in the area still bear the names of these original developers: Durant, Buist, Mixon, Hyde, and O&#x27;Hear. During World War II, substantial development occurred as the military bases and industries expanded, increasing the personnel assigned there. New residents moved to the region to be closer to their work.

From World War II through the 1960s, many whites who lived in this region (referred to by Charlestonians as the North Area) were unhappy about the way parts of their community were being developed. They wanted the citizens in the area to have direct control over future development. African Americans were still excluded from the political system due to the state&#x27;s 1895 disfranchising constitution. Many white Democrats&#x27; attempts to create an independent city were defeated via court rulings.

The Voting Rights Act of 1965 gave the federal government the means to enforce citizens&#x27; constitutional rights, and African Americans in South Carolina gradually reclaimed their franchise. As a means of bringing the government closer to the people, an incorporation referendum was held on April 27, 1971. On June 12, 1972, after a series of legal battles, the South Carolina Supreme Court upheld the referendum results. North Charleston became a city and elected John E. Bourne Jr. as its first mayor.

===1972–1982: First decade===
When North Charleston was incorporated on June 12, 1972, it consisted of several areas, including the Russelldale, Ferndale, Morningside, Liberty Park, Palmetto Heights, Singing Pines, Dewey Hill, Liberty Homes and John C. Calhoun Homes neighborhoods. Within the first week of operation, the city passed a 61-page Code and signed a five-year lease for 308 Montague Avenue for $300.00 per month. Also during June, the city hired a police chief, and treasurer and annexed its first industry, which was Textone Incorporated Plywood, Westvaco. On June 21, a ribbon was cut on the first city park on Virginia Avenue. At the end of the first month, the city officials reached an agreement for garbage collection and fire protection by the local public service district. The month concluded with the city&#x27;s first big annexation, south of Bexley Street between Spruill Avenue and the Charleston Naval Shipyard. By December, North Charleston had become the fourth-largest city in the state after annexing the Naval Base, the Air Force Base and the Charleston International Airport.

In February 1973, North Charleston doubled its area through annexation, and in March expanded into Berkeley County. In May 1973, the city launched its new police department, which included 21 officers and six cars. By the end of North Charleston&#x27;s first year, the population had increased from 22,000 to 53,000, largely through annexation. Through continued growth and the development of 20 churches, a 62-store shopping mall and other large tracts of residential neighborhoods, the city was ranked as the third-largest city in South Carolina on July 3, 1976.

On June 12, 1982, North Charleston had a population of 65,000 in a area. In ten years, the city&#x27;s growth rate was 250 percent. It had made $15 million in capital investments; $1.95 million invested in parks and recreation facilities, and $2.28 million in economic development.

===1982–1996===
In 1983, North Charleston became the first city in South Carolina to implement a computer-aided dispatch system. Baker Hospital opened a new facility on the banks of the Ashley River. Plans were revealed in 1985 for the Centre Pointe retail development.

By 1986, North Charleston&#x27;s population had reached 78,000, spanning . A monument to honor Vietnam veterans was erected and dedicated in front of City Hall, where it stood for over 20 years before being moved to Patriots Point in 2008. The city celebrated its 15th anniversary the next year, marked by such events as the opening of the Northwoods Center shopping complex and the development of a beach in the middle of the city with the opening of Treasure Lake.

In September 1989, Hurricane Hugo devastated the area, causing a total of over $2.8 billion in damage to the South Carolina Lowcountry.

In 1991, John E. Bourne, Jr., lost his bid for a sixth term as mayor to Bobby Kinard, who became the city&#x27;s second mayor. Kinard&#x27;s tenure as mayor was tumultuous and was marked by repeated conflict with the City Council; its members stripped Kinard of his mayoral powers during a council meeting. Kinard resigned in 1994 on the grounds that his relationship with the council was damaged irreparably. R. Keith Summey was elected the city&#x27;s third mayor to fill the vacant seat. Kinard returned to his law practice. In 2023, former North Charleston Police Chief Reggie Burgess was elected mayor, the first Black person to serve in the role.

In 1993 a squadron of C-17 Globemaster III aircraft was established at Charleston Air Force Base, bringing more residents and jobs. The North Charleston Coliseum opened, and the South Carolina Stingrays of the ECHL began play later that year.

===1996–present: redevelopment===

The Charleston Naval Base ranked as the largest employer of civilians in South Carolina into the 1990s. The influence of Lowcountry legislators and the threat of nuclear attack played an important role in keeping North Charleston&#x27;s bases open in the face of periodic attempts at closure.

In the early 1990s, with the resolution of the Cold War and the fall of the Soviet Union, plus impending defense budget cuts, the Charleston Navy Base was proposed for closure. In 1993, the Charleston Naval Base was given a closure date of April 1, 1996. Given its annual expenditures of approximately 1.4 billion dollars in the region, the base&#x27;s closing represented a major loss of jobs and a blow to the entire Tri-County economy. Over the years, billions of federal dollars had flowed into the region&#x27;s economy and hundreds of thousands of jobs were filled by military and civilian personnel, the vast majority civilians. Many military personnel who worked at or passed through the base returned to the city to retire. After the Charleston Naval Base and Charleston Naval Shipyard closed, parts of the base and dry docks were leased to various government and private businesses. Community parks for North Charleston were established on old base grounds, including Riverfront Park.

After years of development, community input and revisions, the Noisette Community Master Plan for the old naval base was finalized in a contractual agreement in early 2004. The plan sought to preserve historic architectural styles, neighborhood diversity, and the area&#x27;s unique social fabric. It is also intended to restore environmental stability and beauty, attract jobs, improve services such as education and health care, reduce dependence on car travel, promote recreation, eliminate the foundations of crime and poverty, and strengthen residents&#x27; sense of pride.

In 2005, city officials discovered that Noisette had borrowed $3 million against the land on the former base without their knowledge. The next year, Noisette borrowed $23.7 million from Capmark Investing Group, using most of its remaining land on the base as collateral. Noisette failed to make timely repayment to Capmark, and the property went into foreclosure. Noisette representatives insisted at the time that they would be able to repay Capmark and make good on their vision for redeveloping the old Navy base.

In July 2014, the City of North Charleston and Chicora Garden Holdings, LLC announced the planned redevelopment of the old Naval Hospital property, to be known as the Chicora Life Center. As part of that announcement, Chicora Garden Holdings announced an initial $3 million investment in the project. The City of North Charleston announced that the Chicora Life Center &quot;will feature myriad social, government, non-profit and care facilities—all in one building conveniently located in the heart of Charleston County.&quot;

On October 7, 2014, &quot;Palmetto Business Daily&quot; reported that UC Funds was funding $13.9 million in loans to the Chicora Life Center for completion of the project. That newspaper also reported that Bennett Hofford Construction Company also completed Phase 1 of a new Heating, Ventilation and Air Condition (HVAC) for the portion of the building leased by the County of Charleston.

Discussion between city and state officials regarding the industrial development of the remaining portions of the former base stalled in 2009, primarily due to a dispute over rail access to a proposed intermodal terminal to occupy the central portion of the area. Representatives of the state government sought to have rail access from both the north and south. This notion was contradicted by Mayor Summey, who insisted that the northern rail access be abandoned to avoid heavy rail traffic through the slowly revitalizing Park Circle neighborhood.

In October 2009, Boeing announced the selection of North Charleston for its new 787 Dreamliner aircraft assembly and delivery prep center. This positioned North Charleston as one of the major aircraft centers of the world, with the potential for thousands of new jobs to provide quality work for residents of the city and the entire Tri-County area.

In December 2010, a Delaware corporation with ties to former state Commerce Secretary Bob Faith bought the largest parcel (approximately at the north end of the former base) of Noisette land. The corporation transferred the deed for that land to the state&#x27;s Commerce Department&#x27;s Public Railways Division, which had the impetus to move forward with their proposed railyard with northern and southern access despite Summey&#x27;s objections. Summey announced his intent to sue the state Commerce Department on the grounds that its plan violated the city&#x27;s agreement with the State Ports Authority that no rail be run through the north end of the former base.
On April 4, 2015, a shooting incident took place, in which Walter L. Scott, who was driving a car with a suspected broken taillight in North Charleston, was fatally shot after being stopped by Officer Michael T. Slager. A video by a bystander was broadcast nationally. Slager was charged with murder. A mistrial was declared on December 5, 2016. The second trial in state court and separate federal charges are still pending.

===Military presence===
North Charleston, Goose Creek, and Hanahan are home to branches of the United States Military. During the Cold War, the Naval Base (1902–1996) became the third largest U.S. homeport serving over 80 ships and submarines. The Charleston Naval Shipyard repaired frigates, destroyers, cruisers, sub tenders, and submarines. The Shipyard was also equipped for the refueling of nuclear subs.

During this period, the Weapons Station was the Atlantic Fleet&#x27;s load out base for all nuclear ballistic missile submarines. Two SSBN &quot;Boomer&quot; squadrons and a sub tender were homeported at the Weapons Station, while one SSN attack squadron, Submarine Squadron 4, and a sub tender were homeported at the Naval Base. At the 1996 closure of the Station&#x27;s Polaris Missile Facility Atlantic (POMFLANT), hundreds of nuclear warheads and their UGM-27 Polaris, UGM-73 Poseidon, and UGM-96 Trident I delivery missiles (SLBM) were stored and maintained, guarded by a U.S. Marine Corps Security Force Company.

==Crime==
The following table shows North Charleston&#x27;s crime rate for calendar year 2020 in six crimes that Morgan Quitno uses for their calculation for &quot;America&#x27;s most dangerous cities&quot; ranking, in comparison to the national average. The statistics provided are for a crime rate based on the number of crimes committed per 100,000 people.
Since 1999, the overall crime rate of North Charleston has begun to decline. The total violent crime index rate for North Charleston for 1999 was 1043.5 crimes committed per 100,000 people, with the United States average at 729.6 per 100,000. North Charleston had a total violent crime index rate of 489.4 per 100,000 for the year of 2012, versus a national average of 296.0 per 100,000.

According to the &quot;Congressional Quarterly Press&quot; &quot;2012 City Crime Rankings: Crime in Metropolitan America&quot;, North Charleston ranked as the 126th most dangerous American city larger than 75,000 inhabitants. The entire Charleston-North Charleston-Summerville, SC Metropolitan Statistical Area had a lower overall crime rate ranking at #35.

The 2010 &quot;Congressional Quarterly Press&quot; list of America&#x27;s 400 most dangerous cities placed North Charleston at No. 63. The homicide rate alone decreased by 61%, and the lower crime rate removed North Charleston from the company of such cities as Detroit and St. Louis, placing it more in line with average, medium-sized Southern cities like Columbia and Chattanooga. City officials attributed the drop to the hard work of the North Charleston Police Department and the cooperation of city residents through &quot;community policing&quot; programs. U.S. Attorney for the District of South Carolina Bill Nettles made community policing one of his statewide initiatives, starting the program in North Charleston in 2011.

<doc id="151032" wikidata="Q3264045" url="?curid=151032" title="Sutton Bridge">
<text>Sutton Bridge is a village and civil parish in the South Holland district of Lincolnshire, England. It is situated on the A17 road, north from Wisbech and west from King&#x27;s Lynn. The village includes a commercial dock on the west bank of the River Nene over which spans a swing bridge, and the parish, two 19th-century lighthouses to the north from the village on the Nene.

==Geography==

The village lies very close to the county borders of both Norfolk and Cambridgeshire in the extreme south east of Lincolnshire. The parish boundary to the east, next to the Wash, meets Terrington St Clement and Norfolk. A mile north of the A17, it meets Walpole Cross Keys. At &quot;King John Bank&quot; it crosses the A17, meeting Walpole. At the junction of the North Level Main Drain with the River Nene, it follows the Nene northwards, meeting Tydd St Mary (Lincolnshire). At South Holland Bridge it follows South Holland Main Drain westwards to South Holland Lodge, where it meets Little Sutton, and follows Hospital Drove northwards, crossing the A17 where the pylons cross the bypass. It crosses the former A17 next to the large Premier Foods factory. At Maze Farm it briefly meets Long Sutton then meets Lutton. It follows the Lutton Leam eastwards through Old Leam Farm.

Sutton Bridge and the surrounding area has recently seen an influx of new residents, mostly from the southern part of the United Kingdom. This has resulted in a healthy housing construction and improvement plan. In 1999, Sutton Bridge Power Station, a 790 MW gas-fired power station that feeds electricity into the UK&#x27;s National Grid was opened, it is situated on &quot;Centenary Way&quot;, close to the River Nene.

In 2024, a 57.3-mile stretch of the King Charles III England Coast Path opened from Sutton Bridge to Skegness. An existing stretch of the England Coast Path reaches Hunstanton.

==History==
The early 19th-century village consisted of a few farmhouses and cottages straggled along the track which passed for a main road. The parish church is dedicated to St Matthew, and is the only flint church in Lincolnshire.

===Marshes===
Stretching to the east and north was a vast, fast flowing expanse of marshes known as Cross Keys Wash, through which the River Nene (earlier, the Wellstream) wound its way to the sea. The whole area is composed of sand and silt, shifting regularly as the water cut new channels. The track across the marshes between Lincolnshire and Norfolk was passable at low water and needed a guide for a safe passage. Livestock, travellers, wagons and coaches were lost into the quicksand of the marshes.

Since reclamation began in the 16th century of the estuary between Long Sutton and Sutton Bridge, The Wash House (now the Bridge Hotel) marked the start of the safe track and it was possible to hire guides to help the general travellers and also the drovers with their herds of cattle, flocks of sheep or geese safely over the marsh.

===King John losing the Crown Jewels===

It was recorded by contemporary chroniclers that on 12 October 1216 King John&#x27;s crown jewels and other valuable crown possessions were lost in marshland when the horse-drawn baggage train of his army, in passing from Bishop&#x27;s Lynn (now King&#x27;s Lynn) en route to Sleaford, attempted to cross the causeway and ford across the mouth of the Wellstream without a guide. John, on departing from Bishop&#x27;s Lynn, had apparently chosen the safer route via Wisbech in the Isle of Ely. The baggage train route was usable only at low tide. The horse-drawn wagons moved too slowly for the incoming tide or flood tide, and most were lost with only a few men surviving. The king died a week later of dysentery, and was succeeded to the throne by his 9-year-old son, Henry III.

The location of the incident is usually supposed to be somewhere near the site of Sutton Bridge, on the River Nene. The name of the river changed as a result of the redirection of the Great Ouse during the 17th century, and Bishop&#x27;s Lynn became King&#x27;s Lynn as a result of Henry VIII&#x27;s rearrangement of the English Church.

During the early part of the 20th century, several privately sponsored archaeological attempts were made to discover the exact location of King John&#x27;s long-lost treasure, on of reclaimed land between Sutton Bridge and Wisbech. Modern scientific equipment, such as the magnetic variometer method were implemented, from the headquarters of Fen Research Ltd., located at Dovecote Farm in Walpole St. Peter, which had been purposely formed to search for King John&#x27;s treasure. The research company was financially sponsored by the wealthy American James R. H. Boone of Baltimore, and included on the board Sir Francis Hill and Sir R. E. Mortimer Wheeler, keeper of the London Museum.

In 2021 it was reported in the local newspaper that another treasure hunter had claimed to have found the location of the treasure.

===Railway===

The first railway reached the village in 1862 with Sutton Bridge railway station. The actual operation of the railways caused problems when ships were using the river. With no radio communication between the two, news of the approaching ship depended on visual warning.

===The Great War===
A war memorial to those who gave their lives for their country 1914-1918 was erected in the churchyard of St Matthew&#x27;s church. The war memorials online website states that the names of 48 men are inscribed on the memorial and also those from the Second World War.

==Port Sutton Bridge==
The (38 &amp; 39 Vict. c. ccvii) authorised the construction of the dock and other necessary works, including connecting the dock to the existing railway. The wet dock was to be some by with a lock from the river of . The length of the quayside was to be with a long timber jetty on the east side. On the west side was to be a coal jetty, equipped with a hydraulic lift to raise coal trucks to tip their loads into ships waiting beneath.

The dock gates weighed 35 tons each and 1.5 million bricks were used in constructing the dock entrance. An area of was taken up by the dock itself and of soil were excavated. The first sod was cut on 1 January 1878 and 100 men, 50 horses and carts, 1 steam dredger and several barges were involved in the work.

The work was completed and the first ship to enter the dock (SS &quot;Garland&quot;) did so on 14 May 1881, carrying 1200 tons of cargo destined for Messrs English of Wisbech. The excitement was spoilt somewhat as the dock entrance had not been dredged to a sufficient depth and the ship had to unload some of her cargo before entering the dock. However, towed by the tugs, &quot;Pendennis&quot; and &quot;the Isle of Ely&quot;, she floated into the dock. In the following week, four other ships used the dock.

The official opening was planned for 29 June with great public festivities, however on 9 June part of the ground at the south west corner of the lock sank , leaving the concrete facing unsupported. At the same time, a strip of earth at the back of the lock on the north side sank, carrying with it, two steam traction engines which had been used for pumping. They were buried deep in the silt. Frantic efforts were made to repair the damage. Trainloads of sand, silt, rubble, clay and limestone were poured into the gaps to no avail. On the following Tuesday of concrete facing on the opposite, west side of the dock itself were dislodged because the footings had been scoured away. On Wednesday, many more yards of the concrete cracked and subsided. All three ships which had been in the dock had got away safely with some difficulty. The great weight of concrete laid on shifting silt, together with inadequate timber piling would appear to have led to the collapse. Efforts to save the dock were soon seen to be futile and the plan was abandoned. The railway company lost a fortune and Sutton Bridge&#x27;s growth as a port was halted for over 100 years.

Sutton Bridge Golf Club, established in 1914, is a nine-hole golf course in and around the abandoned dock basin. The concrete walls of the dock, some 15 feet high, form part of the course.

The modern Port Sutton Bridge opened in 1987. It is a 62-acre dry cargo port and warehouse complex. The port provides a 350 metre long wharf accommodating between four and five vessels, with a maximum vessel length of 120 metres and 17 metre beam. Vessels up to 5,000 DWT, with a draught of 6 metres can be accommodated at spring tide.

==Swing bridge==

The swing bridge which spans the River Nene is a notable feature of the village and the current version, known as Cross Keys Bridge, was built in 1897 at a cost of £80,000 and is the third bridge to cross the river. The bridge was originally dual purpose, serving both road and rail traffic until 1959 when the railway closed.

The first bridge, opened in 1831, was designed by John Rennie the Younger and Thomas Telford as part of the Wash Embankment works. It was of a timber and cast iron construction and opened up rather like London&#x27;s famous Tower Bridge. However it was eventually found to be awkwardly sited and in 1850, its replacement designed by Robert Stephenson was opened.

The position of the second bridge was approximately halfway between the original and the present day bridge. It was a swing bridge and was used only for road traffic until 1864 when the Midland Railway acquired powers to also use it for rail traffic. When the current bridge was constructed it was hoped that the 1850 bridge could be left in position for rail use but the river authorities decided that two bridges so close together constituted a hazard for shipping, and it was removed.

==Lighthouses==
Twin lighthouses were built on the banks of the mouth of the River Nene in 1831, to commemorate the opening of the Nene outfall cut (the Commissioners of the Nene Outfall having been given permission to establish lighthouses and beacons without the sanction of Trinity House). In 1861, however, it was officially reported that &#x27;they have never been used, nor are they considered at all necessary, as the system of lighting adopted in this port is found to answer all purposes required&#x27;.

Contrary to belief these were lit and acted as lighthouses although they were not lit throughout the night, there being no rocks to protect ships from. The River Nene has however always been an important navigation for shipping and if a high tide occurred after dark, they were lit for approximately one and a half hours before and after high tide to guide ships through the sand banks and into the river. The towers are circular but the top lantern sections are hexagonal. Both have a circular window facing the channel entry. Each has in addition a half moon window to the north on the west bank lighthouse and to the south on the east bank lighthouse. A ship picking up either side light is not in the channel. The side lights would however be used by skilled pilots to triangulate their way through the twisting sand banks by picking them up and losing them.

The East Bank Lighthouse is known as the Sir Peter Scott Lighthouse: before the Second World War it was inhabited by the naturalist and artist Sir Peter Scott who bought a large area of the Ouse Washes and established a nature reserve of what is now the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust. It also inspired the setting for Paul Gallico&#x27;s novella &quot;The Snow Goose: A Story of Dunkirk&quot;.

==Wartime Sutton Bridge==
The village and community of Sutton Bridge played a supportive role of national importance during the Second World War; it was home to a Royal Air Force (RAF) airfield and prisoner-of-war camp. Its most pivotal role was when Sutton Bridge became the RAF&#x27;s Central Gunnery School (CGS), training both fighter pilots from RAF Fighter Command and air gunners from RAF Bomber Command, and in the words of Group Captain Allan Wright &quot;the Central Gunnery School itself was the first of its kind in the world&quot;.

===RAF Sutton Bridge===

On 1 September 1926 the Air Ministry established RAF Practice Camp Sutton Bridge on acquired farmland bordering Sutton Bridge village, adjacent the River Nene, in close vicinity to Cross Keys Bridge. As a gunnery training camp, it was to operate ground and towed targets for live practice machine gun fire and bomb dropping by aircraft, its principal gunnery range was located along the Lincolnshire coast marshland on The Wash around 8 miles North-Northeast of Holbeach. Becoming well established and expanded, RAF Practice Camp Sutton Bridge was renamed to No. 3 Armament Training Camp Sutton Bridge and later simply RAF Sutton Bridge. In October 1939 No. 266 Squadron RAF was reformed at RAF Sutton Bridge as a fighter squadron operating the Fairey Battle light bomber aircraft before taking delivery of the Supermarine Spitfire in January 1940, becoming the RAF&#x27;s second Spitfire fighter Squadron after RAF Duxford’s No. 19 Squadron RAF.

On inception, training combat pilots of biplanes such as the Gloster Gamecock, Bristol F.2 Fighter, Armstrong Whitworth Atlas, Armstrong Whitworth Siskin, Bristol Bulldog and Fairey Flycatcher, Sutton Bridge later became accustomed to the intense activity of aircraft such as the Boulton Paul Defiant, Fairey Battle, Bristol Blenheim, Bristol Beaufort, Supermarine Spitfire, Hawker Hurricane, Airspeed Oxford, Miles M.19 Master II, P-51 Mustang, A-35 Vengeance, Lockheed Hudson, Vickers Wellington and Avro Lancaster bombers, to name a few, stationed at RAF Sutton Bridge over the course of its operational life. In 1937, the village of Sutton Bridge also attracted some 5000 people to its open day flying display on Empire Day, which included amongst its highlights, bombing a moving car and attacks on towed targets.
RAF Sutton Bridge not only trained British combat pilots but also the RAF&#x27;s commonwealth and foreign allied pilots, especially trainee Polish, Czech and French pilots. Many distinguished Second World War combat pilots passed through RAF Sutton Bridge training, such as Air Marshal Sir Richard Atcherley, Group Captain Billy Drake, Group Captain Sir Douglas Bader serving with No. 23 Squadron RAF and Dam Busters legend Wing Commander Guy Gibson. Along with RAF Sutton Bridge came also a stream of local crash landing incidents and mid-air collisions, many resulting in pilot fatalities. At the end of the Second World War, RAF Sutton Bridge was also used for dismantling aircraft such as the Vickers Wellington bomber, Avro Lancaster bomber and other British combat aircraft scheduled to be sold as scrap metal.

Today, small remnants of RAF Sutton Bridge airfield exist, in 1958 RAF Sutton Bridge was closed, its land site transferred to the Ministry of Agriculture and continues to be used by the Potato Marketing Board as one of the UK&#x27;s leading agricultural experiment stations.

In 1947, a memorial in Saint Matthew&#x27;s church was dedicated in memory of Commonwealth and Allied airmen who gave their lives whilst serving at RAF Sutton Bridge. The church also includes a Roll of Honour as well as a war grave cemetery. A memorial plinth-mounted propeller blade situated at the side of Cross Keys Bridge was also erected in 1993 in memory of all that served at RAF Sutton Bridge; the propeller blade came from a crashed Hawker Hurricane that was based at RAF Sutton Bridge. The marshland gunnery range itself, located along The Wash, survived as RAF Holbeach Bombing Range becoming parented to RAF Marham, it continues active service as a practice bombing range for the RAF as well as NATO-allied air forces.

===Dam Busters Raid 1943===
During the early part of 1943 Sutton Bridge and Cross Keys Bridge was used by 617 Squadron from RAF Scampton to practise their low-level flying needed for Operation Chastise (the legendary Dam Busters raid). The mission was led by commanding officer Guy Gibson, who was familiar with the village of Sutton Bridge having participated in advanced training at RAF Sutton Bridge during the summer of 1937.

RAF Sergeant George (Johnny) Johnson DFM, Bomb-Aimer on board Lancaster bomber ED825/AJ-T commanded by Joe McCarthy that attacked the Sorpe Dam from a height of just 30 feet, recounts that in the village of Sutton Bridge there were electric cables that cross the River Nene just before the bridge itself and to hone their low-level flying skills they would regularly practice flying the Lancasters under the electric cables and skim up over Cross Keys Bridge, missing the bridge itself by only a few feet each time.

===Sutton Bridge Prisoner of War (POW) Camp===
Sutton Bridge POW Camp (designated POW Camp No. 254, Working Camp) was a relatively low-security prisoner of war confinement camp to a number of captured &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; soldiers, airmen, sailors and submariners from respectively the German Army, Luftwaffe (airforce) and Kriegsmarine (navy) during and after the Second World War. The Camp was located on the West Bank, next to what once was Travis &amp; Arnold timber yard and offices, just off the road (left side) leading towards the old dock. Whilst in captivity the Sutton Bridge POWs were used by the Ministry of Agriculture and hired out to civilian contractors to perform local land labour work. Many German POWs throughout the UK were used as a labour force in agriculture and although interpreted as within the confines of Articles 27–32 of the Geneva Convention (1929), it caused debate in the UK; words such as &quot;slave labour&quot; was increasingly used in the media and in the House of Commons (see Treatment of POWs by the Western Allies).

The Sutton Bridge POW camp was designed to hold up to 250 POWs, consisting of wooden barracks and Nissen huts. Living conditions and facilities at the camp were sparse at best, with no electric lighting nor heating stoves until well after the War had ended. On 28 August 1948, an official inspection visit by the International Committee of the Red Cross reported prisoner conditions at Sutton Bridge POW Camp had improved significantly since their previous visit; 160 German &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; POWs were at that time interned in the camp quasi-hostel, electric lighting and coal heating stoves had found their way into the POW accommodation, each dormitory contained between 8 and 14 single beds, lockable lockers had just been delivered and doors had been fitted to toilet cubicles.

The interned POWs became a familiar part of Sutton Bridge community life while working the local farmland during their years of captivity and long after the war ended awaiting their repatriation (see Termination of captivity, unconditional surrender without armistice). On being formally discharged from captivity that finally occurred in late 1948 and early 1949, the few ex-POWs who remained in local employment sponsorship settled in the local community. Sutton Bridge continued to function as a boarding camp well into the early 1950s for some billeted ex-POWs who were either still awaiting repatriation or had elected to remain settled in local employment, until vacating to suitable local dwellings in and around Sutton Bridge. Remnants of Sutton Bridge POW camp site (location at: ) and its buildings remained visible until the late 1970s–80s.

<doc id="151033" wikidata="Q77255" url="?curid=151033" title="William II of Holland">
<text>William II (February 1227 – 28 January 1256) was the Count of Holland and Zeeland from 1234 until his death. He was elected anti-king of Germany in 1248 and ruled as sole king from 1254 onwards.

== Early life==
William was the eldest son and heir of Count Floris IV of Holland and Matilda of Brabant. When his father was killed at a tournament at Corbie, William was only seven years old. His paternal uncles William and Otto, bishop of Utrecht, were his guardians until 1239.

==Kingship==
With the help of his maternal uncle Duke Henry II of Brabant and the Cologne archbishop Konrad von Hochstaden, William was elected king of Germany after Emperor Frederick II was excommunicated by Pope Innocent IV. He succeeded Landgrave Henry Raspe of Thuringia who had died within a year after his election as anti-king in 1246.

The next year, William decided to extend his father&#x27;s hunting residence to a palace which met his new status. This would later be called the Binnenhof (&quot;Inner Court&quot;) and was the beginning of the city of The Hague. Meanwhile, after a siege of five months, William besieged Aachen for six months before capturing it from Frederick&#x27;s followers. Only then could he be crowned as king by Archbishop Konrad of Cologne. He gained a certain amount of theoretical support from some of the German princes after his marriage to Elizabeth, daughter of the Welf duke Otto of Brunswick-Lüneburg, on 25 January 1252. He was elected as King of the Romans a second time on 25 March 1252 at Brunswick. The electors were the Archbishops of Cologne, Mainz and Trier, the Margrave of Brandenburg and the Duke of Saxony. The Count Palatine Otto II, who was also Duke of Bavaria, was excluded from taking part in the election on the ground that, as a supporter of Conrad IV, he was under sentence of excommunication. After the election, the King of Bohemia sent ambassadors conveying his consent to it. However, although &quot;William lacked neither courage nor chivalrous qualities... his power never extended beyond the Rhineland.&quot;

In his home county, William fought with Countess Margaret II of Flanders for control of Zeeland. As king of Germany, he made himself count of Zeeland. In July 1253, he defeated the Flemish army at Westkapelle (in modern-day Belgium) and a year later a pause in hostilities followed. His anti-Flemish policy worsened his relationship with France. From 1254 to his death he fought a number of wars against the West Frisians. He built some strong castles in Heemskerk and Haarlem and created roads for the war against the Frisians.

William gave city rights to Haarlem, Delft, &#x27;s-Gravenzande and Alkmaar. According to the &quot;Annales Wormatienses&quot;, on 10 November 1255 William &quot;eliminated the rights of citizens who are called Pfahlbürger so that among other restrictions, none of the cities were permitted to have them or receive them&quot;; a later scribe added a gloss to clarify that the &quot;Pfahlburger&quot;s &quot;were citizens who were not resident in the city&quot;.

==Marriage and issue==
William married Elisabeth of Brunswick-Lüneburg, daughter of Otto the Child, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, in 1252. They had a son, Floris V (1254 – 1296).

== Death ==
In battle near Hoogwoud on 28 January 1256, William tried to traverse a frozen lake by himself, because he was lost, but his horse fell through the ice. In this vulnerable position, William was killed by the Frisians, who secretly buried him under the floor of a house. His body was recovered 26 years later by his son Floris V, who took terrible vengeance on the West-Frisians. William was then buried in Middelburg. Contemporary sources, including the chronicle of Melis Stoke, portray William as an Arthurian hero. A golden statue of William can be found on the Binnenhof in The Hague, the inner court of the parliamentary complex of the Netherlands.

==History==

The towns of Rosemary and Harpers Crossroads were settled along the Georgetown and Western Railroad, which started operation in 1886. In 1905, the Seaboard Air Line Railroad built a route through the town, along with a sizable maintenance shop. In 1909, voters agreed to incorporate the two separate towns into a single community, which was named Andrews, after Colonel Walter H. Andrews, who played an important role in the incorporation. Andrews worked for the Atlantic Coast Lumber Co. and served as mayor through most of the 1920s. In 1915, a town hall was built, which is now a museum. By 1919, Andrews had reached a population of 2,000 and continued to grow. During the 1920s, Andrews had the title of being the fastest growing town in the United States for its age. The two schools were the Andrews School and the Rosemary School. These were segregated, with the Andrews School being the white school and Rosemary being the black.

When the Great Depression of the 1930s started, Andrews was hit hard, with population down by 700 when Seaboard scaled back its operations. In 1932, the local economy was dealt a further blow when the Atlantic Coast Lumber Co. closed its nearby plant. The lumber business never regained prominence in the area. The economy subsequently improved in the late 1930s when an International Paper paper mill was built in Georgetown County.

After World War II, the Andrews Development Board was incorporated to attract businesses to the area. Among the industries added were Brooks Veneer Co., the Beale and the Ingram lumber companies, the Rogers Saw Mill Co., the Hardee livestock market, the Andrews Ice Co., and the Oneita Knitting Mill. In 1970, the schools were integrated. Rosemary became a middle school. The Andrews school became the elementary/high school. In 1984, Andrews Elementary School was built.

<doc id="151037" wikidata="Q647464" url="?curid=151037" title="Greer, South Carolina">
<text>Greer is a city in Greenville and Spartanburg counties in the U.S. state of South Carolina. As of the 2020 census, the population was 35,308, making it the 14th-most populous city in South Carolina. Greer is included in the Greenville-Anderson-Greer, SC Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is part of the Greenville-Spartanburg-Anderson, SC Combined Statistical Area in Upstate South Carolina.

==History==
Greer was named for James Manning Greer, who was Scottish. Many of his descendants still reside in the region. James Manning Greer was a descendant of John Greer Sr., who surveyed his land in Laurens County in 1750. John and his family were already in Laurens County, prior to the Greer passengers who arrived aboard the ship &quot;The Falls&quot; in 1764. John, Sr.&#x27;s great grandson, James Manning Greer, settled his family near Greenville in an area that eventually became known as Greer&#x27;s Station.
The area now known as Greer was once part of the &quot;Domain of the Cherokees&quot; prior to the American Revolutionary War. In 1777, the area was added to the state of South Carolina. Development toward the birth of the town occurred in 1873, when the Richmond and Danville Air Line Railway (now the Norfolk Southern Railway) established a line between Atlanta and Charlotte. A station was built on land that belonged to James Manning Greer, and was named Greer&#x27;s Station. The first post office was located in the new depot, Greer&#x27;s Depot. That depot was a red brick, Victorian structure with a slate roof and a cupola. It was located immediately adjacent to the current Norfolk Southern rail line between Trade Street and Depot Street, facing toward Moore Street. It was demolished in 1976 by its then owner, the Southern Railway System, in order to avoid property taxes. When the town was incorporated in 1876, it was named Town of Greer&#x27;s. One hundred years later, the name was officially changed to the City of Greer without an &quot;s&quot; on the end.

Merchants, blacksmiths and physicians set up shop in what is now the downtown area of Greer. In 1900, Greer&#x27;s first bank, the Bank of Greer&#x27;s, opened. The Piedmont and Northern Railway laid a second railroad line through Greer in 1914. With two active train lines, Greer became an attractive site for commerce. The railway meant big business for local farmers, enabling them to ship their crops, mainly cotton and peaches, out of state. Greer also became a textile-manufacturing center, with flourishing mills that included Victor, Franklin, Apalache and Greer Mills. The communities that grew up around the mills were as close-knit as the outlying farming communities.

In 1939, artist Winfred Walkley painted a mural, &quot;Cotton and Peach Growing&quot;, for the town&#x27;s old post office as one of thirteen works commissioned by the U.S. Treasury Department&#x27;s Section of Fine Arts between 1938 and 1941 for post offices and federal buildings throughout South Carolina. The building is now home to the Greer Heritage Museum.

After World War II, the city began to grow and diversify its industrial base. A new hospital and high school were built. People came to downtown Greer from Spartanburg and Greenville to shop. In the early 1960s, Interstate 85 was opened, as well as the Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport. Imports derailed the textile industry in the 1970s and threatened to turn Greer into a ghost town, but the citizens of Greer worked together to attract new industry.

<text>Batesburg-Leesville is a town located in Lexington and Saluda counties, South Carolina, United States. The town&#x27;s population was 5,362 as of the 2010 census and an estimated 5,415 in 2019.

==History==
The town of Batesburg-Leesville was formed in 1992 by the consolidation of the neighboring towns of Batesburg and Leesville. Leesville was incorporated on February 23, 1875, and Batesburg on May 31, 1877. The first mayor of Batesburg-Leesville was also the last mayor of Batesburg, Dr. Elza S. &quot;Sandy&quot; Spradley, Jr. Spradley had been a practicing pharmacist and business owner in the town, a town council member, a member of the Batesburg Water Commission, a founding member of the community’s rescue squad, and an 18-year Fire Chief on the Batesburg Fire Department, retiring after 33 years. Batesburg was named for Captain Tom Bates, a prominent citizen of the community and a captain in the American Civil War. Leesville was named for Colonel John W. Lee, a prominent resident of the community.
The D. D. D. Barr House, Batesburg Commercial Historic District, Simon Bouknight House, Cartledge House, Cedar Grove Lutheran Church, Church Street Historic District, Broadus Edwards House, Hampton Hendrix Office, Hartley House, Henry Franklin Hendrix House, Thomas Galbraith Herbert House, J.B. Holman House, A.C. Jones House, Leesville College Historic District, Crowell Mitchell House, McKendree Mitchell House, Mitchell-Shealy House, Old Batesburg Grade School, John Jacob Rawl House, Rawl-Couch House, Southern Railway Depot, and Rev. Frank Yarborough House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

In February 1946 a black World War II veteran, Sergeant Isaac Woodard, was removed from a Greyhound bus in Batesburg after an argument with the driver. While still in uniform he was severely beaten by local police officers, including Sheriff Lynwood Shull, and permanently blinded. The attack became a cause celebre, becoming the subject of multiple radio commentaries by Orson Welles in July and August 1946, and the subject of Woody Guthrie&#x27;s song, The Blinding of Isaac Woodard. Due to South Carolina&#x27;s reluctance to pursue the case, President Harry S. Truman ordered a federal investigation. Shull was federally indicted and later acquitted by an all-white jury. This incident helped lead to Truman setting up the President&#x27;s Committee on Civil Rights and issuing Executive Order 9981 desegregating the armed forces. 

In early 2018, the town of Batesburg-Leesville, with Town Attorney Christian Spradley, Police Chief W. Wallace Oswald, and Mayor Lancer Shull (no relation to Linwood Shull ), reopened the Woodard case to consider dismissing the 1946 charges. During a regular term of municipal court on June 5, 2018, Woodard&#x27;s &quot;drunk and disorderly&quot; case was reopened and the conviction was vacated by Town Judge Robert Cook.

After a fundraising campaign, a permanent historic plaque now stands on the corner of West Church Street and Fulmer Street in old Batesburg commemorating the civil rights incident at the site of the original police station.

==Law and government==

==Education==

===Public schools===
The public school system in all parts of Batesburg-Leesville census-designated place is administered by Lexington County School District Three, which consists of:
*Batesburg-Leesville Primary School (grades K-2)
*Batesburg-Leesville Elementary School (grades 3–5)

===Historic public schools===
The Batesburg-Leesville Primary School opened in 1984. At that time the district began operating just four schools, as they consolidated smaller, older schools into the new school. Historical schools which closed in 1984 included Hampton Elementary School (1954), Utopia Elementary School (1953), Leesville Elementary School and Batesburg Primary School.

The Batesburg-Leesville Elementary School opened 1996 and replaced the Old Batesburg Grade School which had served the fourth and fifth grades and now serves as the Lexington School District Three Administrative Office. The new school allowed third grade to be shifted from the B-L Primary School to the new Elementary School give the current school breakdown by grade.

The Batesburg-Leesville Middle School opened in 1999. This led to the closing of the old middle school campus which had originally been built as Batesburg-Leesville High School in 1921 with numerous additions through the years.

The Batesburg-Leesville High School opened in 1975. The new school was built on the former Summerland College campus on Summerland Avenue. The construction of a new school had been spurred by integration and student population increases. With integration a former building of Summerland College was used as a middle school in the early 1970s but a fire heavily damaged the building and eventually sped up the construction of the new high school. The first class to graduate in Panther Stadium was the class of 1976.

Prior to racial integration statewide, the local African-American students attended Twin-City High School and Hampton School. Twin-City High School was located on Maple Street in Batesburg where the Twin-City High School Park is now located. The park is owned by the Twin-City Alumni Association. The original two-story wooden Hampton School (1922) was replaced in 1954 by a single-story brick structure on South Lee Street in Leesville. The original wooden building was subsequently torn down, but a marker remains under a large tree in the parking lot of Friendship Baptist Church on South Lee Street. Other &quot;colored&quot; schools included Leesville Colored Primary School and Batesburg-Saluda Colored School.

There were other older schools which had closed previously to include Delmar School which was located a few miles outside of town. View the Delmar School historical marker at. More photographs of these old school buildings may be seen at SC School Insurance Photos 1935-50.

===Private schools===
W. Wyman King Academy and the Ridge Christian School are private, nondenominational Christian schools accepting students in grades K-12.

===Colleges and universities===
In 2008, Midlands Technical College opened a new Batesburg-Leesville satellite campus in the Leesville Historic District. The campus is within the boundaries of the Leesville College Park at the intersection of Main Street and College Street.

===Historic colleges===
*Leesville College, 1890–1911, originally called the Leesville English and Classical Institute (1881–1890). The Haynes Auditorium (built 1883) in the Leesville College Historic District at the intersection of Main Street and College Street was the original classroom building. Two neighboring houses were the college President&#x27;s House and Dormitory. The two homes were a single building during the college days and known as Salisto Hall (a modifier combining the name of two neighboring rivers, Saluda and Edisto). The school was said to have been the first in the state to include practical and technical training in its curriculum, to have a girls&#x27; basketball team, to teach tennis and to teach higher mathematics to females. A.B. degrees were granted after four years of Latin, two years of French or German, mathematics, natural science, history, English, philosophy, and Greek. A Master&#x27;s Degree was offered for a year of post-graduate work. There were departments of music, arts, commercial law, bookkeeping, typing, and one devoted to the Pitman system of shorthand.
*Summerland College, 1912–30. Originally known as Summerland Resort, this property was converted to an all-female college of the Lutheran Church in 1912. It was located on the site of the current Batesburg-Leesville High School. It was closed after the 1930 school year and then consolidated with the all-male Newberry College.

<doc id="151040" wikidata="Q260060" url="?curid=151040" title="CPT symmetry">
<text>Charge, parity, and time reversal symmetry is a fundamental symmetry of physical laws under the simultaneous transformations of charge conjugation (C), parity transformation (P), and time reversal (T). CPT is the only combination of C, P, and T that is observed to be an exact symmetry of nature at the fundamental level. The CPT theorem says that CPT symmetry holds for all physical phenomena, or more precisely, that any Lorentz invariant local quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must have CPT symmetry. In layman terms, this stipulates that an antimatter, mirrored, and time reversed universe would behave exactly the same as our regular universe.

==History==
The CPT theorem appeared for the first time, implicitly, in the work of Julian Schwinger in 1951 to prove the connection between spin and statistics. In 1954, Gerhart Lüders and Wolfgang Pauli derived more explicit proofs, so this theorem is sometimes known as the Lüders–Pauli theorem. At about the same time, and independently, this theorem was also proved by John Stewart Bell. These proofs are based on the principle of Lorentz invariance and the principle of locality in the interaction of quantum fields. Subsequently, Res Jost gave a more general proof in 1958 using the framework of axiomatic quantum field theory.

Efforts during the late 1950s revealed the violation of P-symmetry by phenomena that involve the weak force, and there were well-known violations of C-symmetry as well. For a short time, the CP-symmetry was believed to be preserved by all physical phenomena, but in the 1960s that was later found to be false too, which implied, by CPT invariance, violations of T-symmetry as well.

==Derivation of the CPT theorem==

Consider a Lorentz boost in a fixed direction &quot;z&quot;. This can be interpreted as a rotation of the time axis into the &quot;z&quot; axis, with an imaginary rotation parameter. If this rotation parameter were real, it would be possible for a 180° rotation to reverse the direction of time and of &quot;z&quot;. Reversing the direction of one axis is a reflection of space in any number of dimensions. If space has 3 dimensions, it is equivalent to reflecting all the coordinates, because an additional rotation of 180° in the &quot;x-y&quot; plane could be included.

This defines a CPT transformation if we adopt the Feynman–Stueckelberg interpretation of antiparticles as the corresponding particles traveling backwards in time. This interpretation requires a slight analytic continuation, which is well-defined only under the following assumptions:
#The theory is Lorentz invariant;
#The vacuum is Lorentz invariant;
#The energy is bounded below.

When the above hold, quantum theory can be extended to a Euclidean theory, defined by translating all the operators to imaginary time using the Hamiltonian. The commutation relations of the Hamiltonian, and the Lorentz generators, guarantee that Lorentz invariance implies rotational invariance, so that any state can be rotated by 180 degrees.

Since a sequence of two CPT reflections is equivalent to a 360-degree rotation, fermions change by a sign under two CPT reflections, while bosons do not. This fact can be used to prove the spin-statistics theorem.

==Consequences and implications==
The implication of CPT symmetry is that a &quot;mirror-image&quot; of our universe — with all objects having their positions reflected through an arbitrary point (corresponding to a parity inversion), all momenta reversed (corresponding to a time inversion) and with all matter replaced by antimatter (corresponding to a charge inversion) — would evolve under exactly our physical laws. The CPT transformation turns our universe into its &quot;mirror image&quot; and vice versa. CPT symmetry is recognized to be a fundamental property of physical laws.

In order to preserve this symmetry, every violation of the combined symmetry of two of its components (such as CP) must have a corresponding violation in the third component (such as T); in fact, mathematically, these are the same thing. Thus violations in T-symmetry are often referred to as CP violations.

The CPT theorem can be generalized to take into account pin groups.

In 2002 Oscar Greenberg proved that, with reasonable assumptions, CPT violation implies the breaking of Lorentz symmetry.

CPT violations would be expected by some string theory models, as well as by some other models that lie outside point-particle quantum field theory. Some proposed violations of Lorentz invariance, such as a compact dimension of cosmological size, could also lead to CPT violation. Non-unitary theories, such as proposals where black holes violate unitarity, could also violate CPT. As a technical point, fields with infinite spin could violate CPT symmetry.

The overwhelming majority of experimental searches for Lorentz violation have yielded negative results. A detailed tabulation of these results was given in 2011 by Kostelecky and Russell.

<doc id="151042" wikidata="Q4197135" url="?curid=151042" title="Viz.">
<text>The abbreviation viz. (or viz without a full stop) is short for the Latin , which itself is a contraction of the Latin phrase videre licet, meaning &quot;it is permitted to see&quot;. It is used as a synonym for &quot;namely&quot;, &quot;that is to say&quot;, &quot;to wit&quot;, &quot;which is&quot;, or &quot;as follows&quot;. It is typically used to introduce examples or further details to illustrate a point: for example, &quot;all types of data &quot;viz.&quot; text, audio, video, pictures, graphics, can be transmitted through networking&quot;.

==Etymology==

&quot;Viz.&quot; is shorthand for the Latin adverb using scribal abbreviation, a system of medieval Latin shorthand. It consists of the first two letters, &quot;vi&quot;, followed by the last two, &quot;et&quot;, using . With the adoption of movable type printing, the (then current) blackletter form of the letter , formula_1, was substituted for this symbol since few typefaces included it.

==Usage==
In contrast to &quot;i.e.&quot; and &quot;e.g.&quot;, &quot;viz.&quot; is used to indicate a detailed description of something stated before, and when it precedes a list of group members, it implies (near) completeness.

* &quot;Viz.&quot; is usually read aloud as &quot;that is&quot;, &quot;namely&quot;, or &quot;to wit&quot;, but is sometimes pronounced as it is spelled, viz.: .
* &quot;Videlicet&quot; is pronounced or in English-speaking countries.

===Examples===
* This was the intended meaning of his speech, &quot;viz.&quot; that our attitude was in fact harmful, was not understood.
* The later two problems, &quot;viz.&quot; his debt and his back pain, could not be so easily solved.
* &quot;My grandfather had four sons who grew up, viz. Thomas, John, Benjamin and Josiah.&quot;
* The noble gases, viz. helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and radon, show an unexpected behaviour when exposed to this new element.

== Compared with &quot;scilicet&quot; ==

A similar expression is , from earlier , abbreviated as &quot;sc.&quot;, which is Latin for &quot;it is permitted to know.&quot; &quot;Sc.&quot; provides a parenthetic clarification, removes an ambiguity, or supplies a word omitted in preceding text, while &quot;viz.&quot; is usually used to elaborate or detail text which precedes it.

In legal usage, &quot;scilicet&quot; appears abbreviated as &quot;ss.&quot; It can also appear as a section sign (§) in a caption, where it is used to provide a statement of venue, that is to say a location where an action is to take place.

&quot;Scilicet&quot; can be read as &quot;namely,&quot; &quot;to wit,&quot; or &quot;that is to say,&quot; or pronounced in English-speaking countries, or also anglicized as .

<text>Adolf (c. 1255 – 2 July 1298) was the count of Nassau from about 1276 and the elected king of Germany from 1292 until his deposition by the prince-electors in 1298. He was never crowned by the pope, which would have secured him the imperial title. He was the first physically and mentally healthy ruler of the Holy Roman Empire ever to be deposed without a papal excommunication. Adolf died shortly afterwards in the Battle of Göllheim fighting against his successor Albert of Habsburg.

He was the second in the succession of so-called count-kings of several rivalling comital houses striving after the Roman-German royal dignity.

==Family==
Adolf was the reigning count of a small German state. He was born about 1255 and was the son of Walram II, Count of Nassau and his wife, Adelheid of Katzenelnbogen. Adolf’s brother was Diether of Nassau, who was appointed Archbishop of Trier in 1300.

Adolf was married in 1270 to Imagina of Isenburg-Limburg (died after 1313) and they had eight children. Agnes of Isenburg-Limburg, the sister of Imagina, was married to Henry (Heinrich) of Westerburg, the brother of Siegfried II of Westerburg, the Archbishop of Cologne.

==Career as Count of Nassau==
In 1276 or 1277, Adolf followed his father as Count of Nassau. From his father, he inherited the family’s lands south of the Lahn River in the Taunus Mountains. These included Wiesbaden and Idstein, as fiefdoms, and the Vogtship in Weilburg under the Bishopric of Worms. He also shared ownership of the family homelands around the castles of Nassau and Laurenburg.

Around 1280, Adolf became involved in the with the Lords of Eppstein, in which the city of Wiesbaden was devastated and Sonnenberg Castle destroyed. The feud was settled in 1283, after which the city and the castle were rebuilt. Sonnenberg, along with Idstein, became Adolf’s residence. He granted Idstein town privileges in 1287 and built its fortifications.

Through his uncle, Eberhard I of Katzenelnbogen, Adolf came to the court of King Rudolf I of Habsburg. King Rudolf awarded him with the Burghauptmannamt (Castle Lordship) of Kalsmunt Castle in Wetzlar and a year later that of Gutenfels Castle near Kaub (where he became a vassal of the Counts Palatine of the Rhine).

Before his election, Adolf’s political activities had been limited to his role as Bundesgenosse of the Archbishop of Cologne. Adolf had no particular office, but likely became known through his involvement with the Archbishops of Cologne and Mainz in the politics of the Middle Rhine and Mainz areas. He spoke German, French, and Latin, which was rare at that time for nobles.

After his election, King Adolf of Nassau would only rarely be in his home country, having transferred the government there to his burgmen. On 17 January 1294, he purchased Weilburg for 400 pounds from the Bishopric of Worms. He granted Weilburg town privileges on 29 December 1295. He also established the Clarisse abbey of Klarenthal near Wiesbaden in 1296.

== Election as King of the Romans ==

Rudolf I of Habsburg died on 15 July 1291. For many years before his death, Rudolf had tried to secure the election of his eldest son Albert (Albrecht) as his successor. He was thwarted, however, by the opposition of the Archbishop of Cologne, Siegfried II of Westerburg, and the King of Bohemia, Wenceslaus (&quot;Václav/Wenzel&quot;) II. Only the Count Palatine Louis II of Upper Bavaria &quot;the Rigorous&quot; promised to choose Albert. Wenceslaus, despite Rudolf&#x27;s recognition of his electoral vote, refused to support Albert because he would not cede Carinthia to him. He took the side of the nobles in the core Habsburg areas of Swabia and in their newly acquired territories in Austria, with whom Albert was unpopular. Wenceslaus was supported by Duke Otto III of Lower Bavaria, whose family were traditional enemies of the Habsburgs. Wenceslaus succeeded in bringing the Electors of Brandenburg and Saxony over to his side: Albert II of Saxony signed an elector pact on 29 November 1291 that he would vote the same as Wenceslaus; Otto IV of Brandenburg made a similar commitment.

Archbishop Siegfried believed that the Emperor should not receive the crown as an inheritance from his father, but should be freely selected by the College of Electors. He convinced the Archbishop of Mainz, , to select a king who would principally serve their interests. Gerard in turn recruited the new Archbishop of Trier, Bohemund I. Thereupon, the Count Palatine was forced to submit to the majority of the College of Electors. Siegfried therefore proposed to the Elector College to select Adolf of Nassau as king. They were ready to elect him, provided he make extensive concessions to the Electors and follow their political demands.

A few days before the election, on 27 April 1292, the first of the electors, Archbishop Siegfried issued the Treaty of Andernach, stating that for Adolf to be chosen king he must promise a long list of acknowledgments of possession (including the imperial cities of Dortmund and Duisburg, and the Vogtship of Essen), pledges of imperial cities and castles, and a sum of 25,000 marks in silver. Furthermore, Adolf promised assistance against specifically listed opponents, but also the general promise that he would not admit any enemy of Siegfried II into his council. After the election, Adolf had to give the archbishop sufficient collateral for the fulfilment of the promise; otherwise he would lose his throne. The last clause is evidence of the fact that at the end of the 13th century, the coronation of the king as the constitutive moment of his rule was still very critical. Adolf promised the archbishop to ask him first for his coronation only after he had raised the agreed collateral.

The other electors extracted similar concessions from Adolf, but only after the election. Among the most far-reaching were the concessions to King Wenceslaus of Bohemia on 30 June 1292. Adolf promised Wenceslaus to remove the two duchies of Austria and Styria from Albert of Habsburg. This was to be done as the previous King Rudolf had removed these territories from King Ottokar II of Bohemia, the father of Wenceslaus. Albert would be charged to agree to this arrangement at a court hearing. If Albert would not bend, the decision of the court would be executed by force within a year. Wenceslaus would then recover the lost territories of his father. Gerhard, the Archbishop of Mainz would receive the imperial cities of Mühlhausen and Nordhausen, which corresponded with the interests of Mainz in the Thuringian region. Furthermore, Gerhard received financial benefits. Like his counterpart in Cologne, the Mainz elector also forbade the presence of his opponents in Adolf’s court. In comparison to the benefits which the electors of Mainz, Cologne and Bohemian received, the donations to the Count Palatine and the Archbishop of Trier were modest.

On 5 May 1292 in Frankfurt am Main, the Archbishop of Mainz, in the name of all the electors, elected Adolf King of the Germans (Emperor-Elect). He was crowned in Aachen on 24 June by the Archbishop of Cologne.

== Reign ==
At the start of his reign, Adolf had neither influence nor power, and was elected &quot;Rex Romanorum&quot; because of the electors&#x27; preference for a weak king. His power was limited from the outset because of the commitments he made.

As he had agreed with the Archbishop of Cologne, Adolf remained in his dominion for four months after his election. The archbishop awaited from the king a revision of the results of the Battle of Worringen in 1288. He had hoped to win again greater influence in the city of Cologne. Despite the tight specifications, Adolf soon emancipated himself from his Electors and concluded pacts with their opponents. Thus, for example, he confirmed the rights of the nobles and the city of Cologne, who had turned against their ruler, and even extended these rights.

Adolf also very quickly broke the promises concerning the Duchies of Austria and Styria. As a clever diplomat, Albert of Habsburg avoided a confrontation with the new king. In exchange for his surrender of the Imperial Regalia, which he still had in his possession, he received, in November 1292, a formal enfeoffment with Austria, Styria, the Windic March, and the Lordship of Pordenone. The disposition of the prestigious insignia and relics of the empire was an additional and important sign for the legitimacy of the reign of the king, but not a mandatory prerequisite. With each new document, Adolf moved a little farther away from his promises, without having to open himself up to breach of contract accusations.

Adolf acted as a self-assured ruler in other ways as well. His court was an attraction for all who sought protection from the powerful emerging territorial lords. He held numerous court days. At the beginning of his reign, he renewed the general public peace (&quot;Landfrieden&quot;) of Rudolf I for another ten years, and brought about at least two regional peaces.

Adolf used the feudal system as one of his major tools of power. He demanded from the spiritual princes a payment, called &quot;Lehnsware&quot;, for their enfeoffment with regalian rights, and increased this demand to the level of a nuisance. Many of Adolf’s contemporaries considered this action to be simony. Many of today&#x27;s historians, however, view it as an innovative way to open up new state revenue sources, as other Western European kings did.

Also, the recovery and management of imperial property was important to him. He succeeded, through clever marriage policy, to bring former imperial properties back under the control of the emperor.

=== Alliance with England ===

In 1294, when Adolf’s rule was at its height, he concluded an alliance with the King Edward I of England against France and was awarded 60 000 pounds sterling, which corresponded to 90 000 gold marks. The pact had been preceded by attempts by Philip IV of France to conquer the Duchy of Burgundy and the County of Flanders. The Count of Flanders, Guy of Dampierre, mediated, therefore, the alliance between Edward I and Adolf for his protection against France. That the alliance was construed by his contemporaries as purely mercenary, and the fact that Adolf did not comply with its obligations, damaged his reputation, but this was initially without consequences.

Adolf began recruiting troops in the empire for a war against France. On 31 August 1294, he sent a declaration of war to the French king, alleging that the latter had seized rights and possessions of the empire. King Philip responded contemptuously on 9 March 1295. Pope Boniface VIII, however, ordered peace in 1295 and threatened to commence the excommunication of Adolf in the event of an outbreak of war.

=== Policies in Thuringia ===

A little later, Adolf intervened in war-torn Thuringia, where fighting had erupted between Landgrave Albert the Degenerate and his sons Frederick and Theodoric IV of Lusatia. He bought the Landgraviate from Albert in his capacity as king and probably using the payments from England. Legally, it was perfectly acceptable for Adolf to induce the feudal lord to abandon his fief and to bring the land under the empire. Furthermore, he seized the Margraviate of Meissen as an imperial fief, since it had been literally ownerless after the extinction of a collateral line of the House of Wettin and had been occupied by a son of Albert the Degenerate.

This purchase and the Margraviate of Meissen, however, affected the interests of four of the electors. The Archbishop of Mainz asserted that a part of Thuringia was not an imperial fief, but rather a fief of the Archdiocese of Mainz. Wenceslaus II of Bohemia was not thrilled by the growing power of the emperor on his northern border, especially since Adolf had promised to give him the Margraviate of Meissen. Also, all the electors hoped to profit from the turmoil in Thuringia. In addition to the ostensible return of imperial fiefs to the empire, it can not be ruled out that Adolf was anxious to build a dynastic power base (albeit a small one).

First, Adolf succeeded in securing his acquisitions diplomatically and provoking the Margrave of Brandenburg toward active support and the Archbishop of Mainz and the Duke of Saxony toward at least acquiescence of the purchase. Two bloody campaigns against the sons of Albert the Degenerate were necessary to secure the acquisitions and a peace assured the achievements. Two years later, in the summer of 1296, Adolf proudly announced on the invitation to a court day that he had by his actions significantly increased the possessions of the empire.

== Deposition==
The electors probably did not plan from the beginning to depose the king, but as events unfolded this result became more inevitable. The reason for the clashes was Adolf’s Thuringia policy. On Pentecost 1297 the elector of Brandenburg, duke of Saxony, and king of Bohemia joined together to enforce their interests. The elector of Mainz, Gerhard II, was associated with this group.

In February 1298, the situation became alarming for Adolf because Wenceslaus II and Albert of Habsburg put aside their years of disputes over Austria and Styria, and reached an agreement in the event that Adolf was deposed and Albert elected in his place. There may have been a meeting of the electors as early as the coronation of King Wenceslaus of Bohemia, on 2 June 1297. In January 1298, through the efforts of the archbishop of Mainz, Albert of Habsburg was brought to testify before an imperial court in order to find a compromise between Adolf and Albert. This did not happen; the two came close to battle in the Upper Rhine Valley and the matter was not resolved.

On 1 May 1298, the archbishop of Mainz invited the king to his court, so that the dispute could be decided there. Archbishop Gerhard claimed he was authorised to do so as imperial arch-chancellor of Germany, according to an old legal principle. Adolf, as a party to the conflict, could not at the same time act as judge and saw these charges as a provocation given that Albert was raising arms against him, the rightful king. Therefore, the meeting planned for 15 June, at which the dispute was to be resolved, did not take place.

A meeting between the archbishop of Mainz, Count Albrecht of Saxony-Wittenberg, and three margraves of Brandenburg (Otto IV, Margrave of Brandenburg-Stendal, Henry I, Margrave of Brandenburg and Herman, Margrave of Brandenburg-Salzwedel) on 23 June 1298 then led to a lawsuit against the king himself. The archbishop of Cologne and the king of Bohemia had previously authorised the archbishop of Mainz to act in their names. In these proceedings Adolf was charged with numerous crimes, including the continued breach of the peace in Thuringia and the breaking of the promises he had made to the archbishop of Mainz. Adolf was deemed unworthy of his office and had forfeited his royal dignity.

It is remarkable that Adolf was not excommunicated by the Pope before being deposed. The pope was probably not even included in the deposition procedure. The princes, it is true, did try to formulate their arguments similarly to Innocent IV’s statement in the deposition of Frederick II, but the process was unprecedented. Because Adolf had been elected and crowned, the contemporary understanding was that he had been chosen by God to be the ruler and that the princes were breaking their oath in which they swore loyalty to the king. Therefore, included in the list of charges were some that, at first glance, appear peculiar today, such as the desecration of communion wafers and the simonistic extortion of money. Furthermore, there was no imperial legal procedure for the ousting of the king. Therefore, the princes relied on their right to vote, from which also they derived their right to oust a king. This argument was problematic insofar as the deposition of Frederick II was already a precedent for this case. According to church law, only the pope had the power to depose a king.

==Election of Albert and death of Adolf==
Following Adolf’s deposition came the election of Albert I of Habsburg as the new king. How this election took place is not very clear today, as the chroniclers have little to report. The question is open, for example, whether Albert actually initially did not want to accept the choice, as he would later assert against Pope Boniface VIII.

To depose Adolf was one thing; it was another to enforce the decision against him. Adolf refused to accept this decision, but the conflict between him and the princely opposition was soon decided on the battlefield. On 2 July 1298 the armies of Adolf and Albert met at the Battle of Göllheim. The small village of Göllheim is situated in northern Rhineland-Palatinate between Kaiserslautern and Worms in present-day Donnersbergkreis. After violent attacks, Adolf fell together with his standard-bearers and a few faithful. Adolf’s army turned to flee and quickly dispersed.

Albert did not allow the followers of Adolf to bury the body of the fallen king in the &quot;Kaiserdom&quot;, the Imperial Cathedral of Speyer. Therefore, Adolf was initially buried in the Cistercian monastery of in present-day Kerzenheim and was only later transferred to Speyer.

==Historical legacy==
On 29 August 1309, Albert I’s successor, Emperor Henry VII transferred Adolf’s remains to the Speyer Cathedral, where he was buried next to Albert, who had been murdered in 1308. In 1824, Duke William of Nassau built a grave monument in the vestibule of the cathedral. Leo von Klenze was commissioned with the design, which shows King Adolf in armor kneeling in prayer.

Probably in the 19th century, the legend arose that Adolf was a count from the Nuremberg area. This misconception was probably based on confusion with Emich I of Nassau-Hadamar, who after his marriage to Anne of Nuremberg around 1300 was the holder of Kammerstein Castle.

In 1841 Duke Adolf of Nassau commissioned a portrait of Adolf by the Düsseldorf painter Heinrich Mücke. In 1843 this painting was hung in the Frankfurt &quot;Kaisersaal&quot; (Hall of Kings). The picture depicts King Adolf with chest armor, a white coat; and wearing an iron crown with an &quot;implied spiked helmet”; in his right hand he holds a sword and in the left a shield with an eagle. It also bears the Latin phrase &quot;Praestat vir sine pecunia quam pecunia sine viro&quot; (Better a man without money than money without a man). Since no contemporary images of the King exist, the portrait is an idealized representation by the artist in the spirit of historicism. It is not based on previous portraits, since Mücke considered other representations, such as the one attributed to Georg Friedrich Christian Seekatz, to be too moderate

On 8 May 1858, Duke Adolf of Nassau established a Military and Civil Order of Merit for the Duchy. It was named for King Adoph as the most important representative of Walram line of the House of Nassau. Although the Duchy of Nassau was annexed by Prussia in 1866, Duke Adolf maintained and renewed the Order when he became Grand Duke of Luxembourg. Until today, it is a respected Order of Merit of the House of Nassau.

Thomas Carlyle calls him &quot;a stalwart but necessitous Herr&quot;.

==Marriage and children==
He married Imagina of Isenburg-Limburg, daughter of Gerlach IV of Isenburg-Limburg and Imagina of Blieskastel. Their children were:
# Henry (&quot;Heinrich&quot;), died young.
# Robert (&quot;Ruprecht&quot;) (died 2 December 1304), betrothed to Agnes of Bohemia, daughter of Wenceslaus II of Bohemia
# Gerlach I, Count of Nassau-Wiesbaden.
# Adolf (1292–1294).
#Walram III van Nassau.
# Adelheid, Abbess of Klarenthal Abbey, died 26 May 1338.
# Imagina, died young.
# Matilda (before 1280 – 19 June 1323, Heidelberg), married Rudolf I &quot;the Stammerer&quot;, Duke of Upper Bavaria.

==History==
A post office has been in operation in Wessington since 1882. The city took its name from the nearby Wessington Hills.

The early growth of Wessington began because it was a transshipment point for locally produced grains because of the railroad (C. &amp; N.W. Ry. Co.). This allowed local producers lower shipping costs compared to villages further from railroads, encouraging the location of other businesses in the town. Wessington originally was located in Beadle County, and the cohesiveness the community soon led to growth into neighboring Hand County.

In 1918 there was a flourishing natural ice business that provisioned refrigerated freight cars. The cattle industry in the area has increased the market quality of the nation&#x27;s cattle through improvements in herd management and adaptations to changing consumer demands. Many producers have received national recognition throughout the years.

<doc id="151050" wikidata="Q287417" url="?curid=151050" title="Beresford, South Dakota">
<text>Beresford (; ) is a city in Lincoln and Union counties in the U.S. state of South Dakota. The population was 2,180 as of the 2020 census. The southern two-thirds is part of the Sioux City, IA-NE-SD Metropolitan Statistical Area, while the northern one-third is part of the Sioux Falls Metropolitan Statistical Area. The &quot;Beresford Republic&quot; is the weekly newspaper.

==History==

Beresford was originally called Paris, and under the latter name was laid out in 1873. The city was renamed after Lord Charles Beresford
d and was formally incorporated on July 12, 1884.

Following the end of the Civil War, thousands of people settled in Dakota Territory during the years 1871 and 1872. If certain requirements (laid out in the Homestead Act of 1862) were met, the government gave title to the land to the homesteaders. Those who settled faced many hardships; however, by settling and starting farms to transform the land into a productive agricultural area.

In 1872, the family of Eli Ricard was the first to settle on a homestead in section five of Prairie Township of what is now Union County. This land became the original location of what is now the town of Beresford. As early as 1873, this small town known as Paris, Dakota Territory. Mr. Ricard operated the Paris Post Office from the frame house he built on his homestead.

In the fall of 1882, it became known that the Iroquois-Hawarden line of the Central division of the Chicago and North Western had built its grade to a point near the Big Sioux River and would be extending it through in the spring of 1883. It was also announced that a town would be established in the area at that time. Mr. Ricard was reported to have offered the rail road company 80 acres if they would build the railroad across the area where Paris was located. Subsequently, the railroad was built along Elie Ricard&#x27;s claim. The surveyor laid out the plat of the town with the assistance of Patrick H. Farley, who helped carry the chain. Beresford was named after Lord Beresford by English capitalists interested in the railroad. The town was not formally incorporated until July 12, 1884.

In the spring of 1883, farmers pushed in to establish a number of businesses in Beresford. The first structure in the pioneer town was the saloon built and operated by D. C. Choquette. This structure was later destroyed by a fire. The second structure was a drug store built by G. S. Joscelyn on the west side of Third Street. This structure was later moved and used as a work shop; and, it was still standing as recently as 1934. The J. W. Reedy residence was believed to have been the first home built in Beresford. When J. N. Wass came to Beresford, he counted a total of seventeen structures.

There were a number of other pioneers in Beresford. J. R. Carleton established the “Beresford News” in 1883 and was the town&#x27;s first newspaper editor.

==Climate==
Beresford is located very near to the center of the North American continent, far removed from any major bodies of water. This lends the area a humid continental climate, with hot, humid summers, cold snowy winters, and wide temperature extremes. Summers can bring daytime temperatures that climb into the 90s Fahrenheit, and winter lows can be well below zero.

==Education==
Beresford High School is the only high school in the Beresford School District. The Beresford High School and Middle School are located on the South Campus of the Beresford School District, and the Beresford Elementary School is located at the North Campus, along with the Community Education Building, which houses the Beresford Pre-School Program.

===Library===
The Beresford Library was originally conceived and nurtured by the Beresford Study Club. In 1923, a committee was appointed to come up with the necessary planning and arrangements. At first, the club members were the ones who contributed books to the library via a book shower, which resulted in forty volumes of reference works as well as fiction. Not long after this, the public was invited to donate books to the collection, and this effort produced another hundred books. The study club started up a fund for the library foundation, and through various fundraising efforts accrued $300 for the purchase of more books. In 1924, both the size and popularity of the library were too much for the women of the study club to sponsor, so they appealed to the city attorney to see if the city would take over responsibility, and at the December meeting of the library board meeting that same year, it was officially announced that the city would take over the library.

The original library occupied a small area on the second floor of the fire station. As of 1959, there were approximately 10,000 volumes classified with the Dewey Decimal System. In 1963, with the help of the local Boy Scouts, the library moved to a new home in the former Post Office building. This was also the time when new forms of media were added to the collection, such as talking books, film strips, and movie projectors. In 1972, the library was expanded further by refurbishing the basement, which would house the youth library. By 1983, the library collection consisted of approximately 20,000 books and much media. The current library resides on 3rd Street, and was opened to the public in that venue in the fall of 1992. The library currently holds nearly 30,000 items.

<doc id="151051" wikidata="Q131335" url="?curid=151051" title="Sioux Falls, South Dakota">
<text>Sioux Falls ( ) is the most populous city in the U.S. state of South Dakota and the 118th-most populous city in the United States. It is the county seat of Minnehaha County and also extends into northern Lincoln County. The population was 192,517 at the 2020 census, and in 2023, its estimated population was 206,410. According to city officials, the estimated population had grown to 219,588 as of early 2025. The Sioux Falls metro area accounts for more than 30% of the state&#x27;s population. Chartered in 1856 on the banks of the Big Sioux River, the city is situated in the rolling hills at the junction of interstates 29 and 90.

==History==

The history of Sioux Falls revolves around the cascades of the Big Sioux River. The falls were created about 14,000 years ago during the last ice age. The lure of the falls has been a powerful influence. Ho-Chunk, Ioway, Otoe, Missouria, Omaha (and Ponca at the time), Quapaw, Kansa, Osage, Arikara, Sioux, and Cheyenne people inhabited and settled the region previous to Europeans and European descendants. Numerous burial mounds still exist on the high bluffs near the river and are spread throughout the general vicinity. Indigenous people maintained an agricultural society with fortified villages, and the later arrivals rebuilt on many of the same sites that were previously settled. Lakota populate urban and reservation communities in the contemporary state and many Lakota, Dakota, and numerous other Indigenous Americans reside in Sioux Falls today.

French voyagers/explorers visited the area in the early 18th century. The first documented visit by an American of European descent was by Philander Prescott, who camped overnight at the falls in December 1832. Captain James Allen led a military expedition out of Fort Des Moines in 1844. Jacob Ferris described the Falls in his 1856 book &quot;The States and Territories of the Great West&quot;.

Two separate groups, the Dakota Land Company of St. Paul and the Western Town Company of Dubuque, Iowa organized in 1856 to claim the land around the falls, considered a promising townsite for its beauty and water power. Each laid out claims, but worked together for mutual protection. They built a temporary barricade of turf which they dubbed &quot;Fort Sod&quot;, in response to native tribes attempting to defend their land from the settlers. Seventeen men then spent &quot;the first winter&quot; in Sioux Falls. The following year the population grew to near 40.

Although conflicts in Minnehaha County between Native Americans and white settlers were few, the Dakota War of 1862 engulfed nearby southwestern Minnesota. The town was evacuated in August of that year when two local settlers were killed as a result of the conflict. The settlers and soldiers stationed here traveled to Yankton in late August 1862. The abandoned townsite was pillaged and burned.

Fort Dakota, a military reservation established in present-day downtown, was established in May 1865. Many former settlers gradually returned and a new wave of settlers arrived in the following years. The population grew to 593 by 1873, and a building boom was underway in that year. The Village of Sioux Falls, consisting of , was incorporated in 1876 and was granted a city charter by the Dakota Territorial legislature on March 3, 1883.

The arrival of the railroads ushered in the great Dakota Boom decade of the 1880s. The population of Sioux Falls mushroomed from 2,164 in 1880 to 10,167 at the close of the decade. The growth transformed the city. A severe plague of grasshoppers and a national depression halted the boom by the early 1890s. The city grew by only 89 people from 1890 to 1900.

In the 1890s Sioux Falls became a destination for women seeking divorce due to having some of the nation&#x27;s most permissive divorce laws and being accessible by rail. It was known as the &quot;Divorce Colony&quot; and remained a popular venue for divorces until South Dakota changed its residency requirements in 1908.

But prosperity eventually returned with the opening of the John Morrell meat packing plant in 1909, the establishment of an airbase and a military radio and communications training school in 1942, and the completion of the interstate highways in the early 1960s. Much of the growth in the first part of the 20th century was fueled by agriculturally based industry, such as the Morrell plant and the nearby stockyards (one of the largest in the nation).

In 1955 the city decided to consolidate the neighboring incorporated city of South Sioux Falls. At the time South Sioux Falls had a population of nearly 1,600 inhabitants, according to the 1950 census. It was the third largest city in the county after Sioux Falls and Dell Rapids. By October 18, 1955, South Sioux Falls residents voted 704 in favor and 227 against to consolidate with Sioux Falls. On the same issue, Sioux Falls residents voted on November 15 by the vote 2,714 in favor and 450 against.

In 1981, to take advantage of recently relaxed state usury laws, Citibank relocated its primary credit card center from New York City to Sioux Falls. Some claim that this event was the primary impetus for the increased population and job growth rates that Sioux Falls has experienced over the past quarter-century. Others point out that Citibank&#x27;s relocation was only part of a more general transformation of the city&#x27;s economy from an industrially based one to an economy centered on health care, finance, and retail trade.

Sioux Falls has grown at a rapid pace since the late 1970s, with the city&#x27;s population more than doubling from 81,182 in 1980 to 192,517 in 2020.

Then-President Bill Clinton made his final stop of the 1996 presidential campaign in Sioux Falls.

===2019 tornadoes===
On the night of September 10, 2019, the south side of Sioux Falls was hit by three strong EF2 tornadoes, severely damaging at least 37 buildings, including the Plaza 41 Shopping Center. One tornado hit the Avera Heart Hospital, damaging portions of the roof and windows, and causing seven injuries, including a man who fractured his skull as he was thrown into an exterior wall of the hospital. Another tornado hit the busy commercial district near the Empire Mall, injuring one woman inside her home. Another touched down on the far south side in a suburban residential area, tearing the roofs off homes. The total damage was more than $5 million.

===Arts===

In the beginning of the 21st century, Sioux Falls experienced a renaissance of cultural interest. The Sioux Empire Arts Council continues to lead in the Sioux Falls area arts scene and gives out Mayor&#x27;s Awards each year in several categories for excellence demonstrated by Sioux Falls residents. The Sioux Falls SculptureWalk was the first visual evidence of the renaissance and is an attraction for both visitors and resident artists, hosting over 55 sculptures including a replica of the Michelangelo&#x27;s David. Work was essential to the renovation of the original Washington High School into the Washington Pavilion (housing two performing arts, a visual arts, and a science center).

The Northern Plains Indian Art Market (NPIAM) was established in 1988 by American Indian Services, Inc., of Sioux Falls as the Northern Plains Tribal Arts Show (NPTA). Northern Plains Tribal Arts dominated the Sioux Falls art scene from its inception in 1988. American Indian Services produced the juried art show and market from 1988 to 2003. Since 2004, Sinte Gleca University of Rosebud has been the producing organization. In the first 25 years of its existence—one of the longest-running Indian art shows in the country—over 800 artists from 7 northern plains states and two Canadian provinces exhibited at NPTA/NPIAM. Writers for national publications, filmmakers, and researchers have all joined the audiences over the years.

A permanent Northern Plains Tribal Arts collection is housed in the Egger Gallery at the Washington Pavilion. Since the Washington Pavilion opened its doors to the public in 1999, the collection has called the Visual Arts Center home. Originally the pieces were on an extended loan from American Indian Services, Inc.; in 2013, thanks to many supporters, the works were acquired under the title of the Augustana Tribal Arts Collection, and now officially belong to the Visual Arts Center.

As the 21st century began, poetry and literary events became more popular with the opening of the Sioux Empire Arts Council Horse Barn Gallery and due to a National Endowment for the Arts-supported Y Writer&#x27;s Voice. The Y Writer&#x27;s Voice included an annual reading series of 38 nationally known poets and writers, who performed works and youth workshops through the Sioux Falls Writers Voice in local performance spaces, at the YMCA after-school program, and in local schools, gaining national attention.

The Sioux Falls mayor&#x27;s awards in literary arts designated movers and shakers during the growth and development of the literary arts scene. In addition to literary awards, there are mayor&#x27;s awards in visual arts, performing arts, music, organizing in the arts, advocacy, and lifetime achievement, per the mayor&#x27;s discretion.

The Sioux Falls Jazz and Blues Festival is a three-day outdoor musical event featuring two stages and is free to the public. It is held the third weekend in July at Yankton Trail Park. The Sioux Falls Jazz &amp; Blues Society hosts national musicians during its annual concert series. Each year the series includes approximately five concerts with acts from all over the world. JazzFest, with over 125,000 in annual attendance, has expanded over the years to include the Jazziest Diversity Project, the All-City Jazz Ensemble, the Concert Series, and JazzFest Jazz Camp. 2016 was the festival&#x27;s 25th anniversary year.

==Government==
The city of Sioux Falls is led by a mayor–council (strong mayor) form of government. Mayoral elections occur every four years. City council seats are also contested every four years. Not all council members are elected in the same year, as the elections are staggered throughout even-numbered years. The council consists of five members elected to represent specific sections of the city and three additional seats that represent the city as a whole (that is, at-large). The council member position is designed to be part-time. Sioux Falls operates under a home rule charter as permitted by the South Dakota constitution.

In the 2004 presidential election, George W. Bush won both Minnehaha and Lincoln counties, receiving 56% and 65% of the vote, respectively. In 2008, Barack Obama won Minnehaha County by 0.7%, while John McCain won Lincoln County by 15%. Both counties have voted for the Republican nominee in every presidential election since 2012.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
====Roads====
Most Sioux Falls residents travel and commute by car. Interstate 90 passes east to west across the northern edge of the city, while Interstate 29 bisects the western portion of the city from the north and south. Interstate 229 forms a partial loop around Sioux Falls, and connects with I-90 to the northeast and I-29 to the southwest. A grid design system for city streets is the standard for the central (older) area of the city; secondary streets in newer residential areas have largely abandoned this plan.

Due to current and expected regional growth, several large construction projects have been or will be undertaken. New interchanges have recently been added to I-29. An interchange was also completed on I-90 at Marion Road. I-29 has recently been improved from I-90 to 57th Street. This upgrade includes additional lanes and auxiliary lanes. Over the next decade, the city of Sioux Falls and the South Dakota Department of Transportation plan to construct a limited-access highway around the city&#x27;s outer edges to the south and east, known as South Dakota Highway 100. This highway will start at the northern Tea exit (Exit 73 on I-29, 101st Street), run east on 101st Street, curve northeast east of Western Avenue, then turn north near Sycamore Avenue. It will end at the Timberline Avenue exit (Exit 402 on I-90). Sioux Falls&#x27; major roads include W 41st, Minnesota, Main, W 26th (which becomes Louise as it turns south), 12th, 49th, 57th, and Western.

====Public/mass transit====

Sioux Area Metro, the local public transit organization, operates 16 bus lines within the city, with most routes operating Monday through Saturday. Recently, the city added a new transfer station in Sioux Falls on Louise Avenue between 49th and 57th Streets. The Sioux Area Metro Paratransit serves members of the community who would otherwise not be able to travel by providing door-to-door service. Public transportation is supplemented with the SAM On Demand service that offers microtransit options.

Jefferson Lines runs long-distance bus routes to the Sioux Falls Bus Station. Non-transfer destinations include Grand Forks, Kansas City, Minneapolis, and Omaha. Until 1965 a branch of the Milwaukee Road train from Chicago, the &quot;Arrow,&quot; made a stop in Sioux Falls.

====Air====
Many domestic airlines serve Sioux Falls Regional Airport.

====Rail====
The BNSF Railway provides freight rail service. Amtrak does not directly serve any community in South Dakota. The closest station is in Omaha, nearly 200 miles away.

The age distribution was 34.6% under the age of 18, 13.1% from 18 to 24, 30.9% from 25 to 44, 18.2% from 45 to 64, and 3.3% 65 or older. The median age was 26 years. For every 100 females, there were 98.9 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 95.7 males.

The median household income was $32,344 and the median family income was $35,020. Males had a median income of $24,596 versus $17,313 for females. The per capita income for the city was $12,692. About 13.0% of families and 15.9% of the population were below the poverty line, including 21.3% of those under age 18 and 6.9% of those aged 65 or over.

<doc id="151053" wikidata="Q960480" url="?curid=151053" title="Ellsworth Air Force Base">
<text>Ellsworth Air Force Base (AFB) is a United States Air Force (USAF) base located about northeast of Rapid City, South Dakota, just north of the town of Box Elder.

The host unit at Ellsworth is the [[28th Bomb Wing]] (28 BW). Assigned to the Global Strike Command&#x27;s Eighth Air Force, the 28 BW is one of the USAF&#x27;s two B-1B Lancer wings, along with the 7th Bomb Wing at Dyess AFB, Texas. In 2023, the 28th Bomb Wing is commanded by Colonel Derek Oakley; its command chief master sergeant was Chief Master Sergeant Adam Vizi.

Ellsworth has a population of about 8,000 military members, family members and civilian employees. Rapid City itself has a population of 78,824. There are about 3,800 military retirees in western South Dakota.

For decades, Ellsworth&#x27;s main entrance included a symbolic B-52 Stratofortress, a gift from the citizens of Rapid City. This entrance has recently been replaced.

An expansion of a bomber training area encompassing the Northern Plains known as the Powder River Training Complex began in 2008.

==History==
Ellsworth AFB was established in 1941 as Rapid City Army Air Base (AAB). It was later renamed for Brigadier General Richard E. Ellsworth (1911–1953), a 28th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing commander killed when his RB-36 Peacemaker aircraft crashed near Burgoyens Cove, Newfoundland, during a training flight.

===World War II===
On 2 January 1942 during World War II, the United States War Department established Rapid City Army Air Base to train B-17 Flying Fortress heavy bomber units to fight the Axis in Europe. The control tower opened on 30 September 1942; runways, quarters, offices, and facilities were complete on 1 October 1942, and five hangars were completed in late 1942. The airfield had three concrete runways, 7050x300 (N/S), 7000x300 (E/W), and 7872x300 (NW/SE). Rapid City AAF was assigned to the 17th Bombardment Training Wing, II Bomber Command. The 88th Bombardment Group was reassigned to the new base in October 1942 to be the base&#x27;s Operational Training Unit.

In March 1944, the 225th Army Air Force Base Unit switched from training entire units to training individual replacement personnel to send to units deployed overseas. The field&#x27;s instructors taught thousands of pilots, navigators, radio operators and gunners from nine heavy bombardment groups and numerous smaller units. On 15 July 1945, the 225th AAFBU was inactivated and Rapid City AAB was placed on standby status as the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) began to demobilize.

===Postwar era, 19451947===
Rapid City AAB was reactivated on 11 October 1945 and was assigned to Continental Air Forces. It was designated a permanent facility by the USAAF. The base briefly trained weather reconnaissance and combat squadrons using P-61 Black Widow, P-38 Lightning, P-51 Mustang, and B-25 Mitchell aircraft.

From September 1946 to March 1947, the airfield was shut down for major improvements to accommodate the B-29 Superfortress. An extension to the runway was completed in spring 1948.

===28th Bombardment Wing, 1948–1958===

When operations resumed in 1947, its primary unit was the new 28th Bombardment Wing (28 BMW) flying the B-29.

The installation changed names a few more times during its early years. In January 1948, Air Force Chief of Staff general Carl A. Spaatz renamed it Weaver Air Force Base in honor of brigadier general Walter R. Weaver, one of the pioneers in the development of the United States Air Force as an independent service. In June of that year, in response to overwhelming public appeals, Secretary of the Air Force Stuart Symington returned the base name to its previous name of Rapid City AFB.

More runway improvements were completed in July 1949, allowing the 28 BMW to switch from B-29s to the huge B-36 Peacemaker. In April 1950, the Air Staff reassigned the base from 15th Air Force to 8th Air Force.

In March 1953, an RB-36 crashed in Newfoundland while returning from a routine exercise in Europe, killing all 23 aboard, including brigadier general Richard E. Ellsworth, commander of the 28th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing. On 13 June 1953, president Dwight D. Eisenhower visited the base to re-dedicate it in memory of Ellsworth. The base was subsequently renamed Ellsworth AFB, and unlike the previous local controversy in 1948, there was no community objection to the name change.

On August 27, 1954, another RB-36H crashed into a hill while performing a landing, following a routine training mission. 24 of the 27 crewmembers were killed in the initial crash, and the remaining 3 were critically injured; 2 later died from their injuries, leaving only one survivor. At a total death toll of 26, this crash remains the deadliest in B-36 history, surpassing the record set by the crash in Newfoundland the previous year. An investigation revealed multiple factors contributed to the crash. A previous lightning storm had damaged the warning lights on the hillside and they had not been fixed. Additionally, both the plane&#x27;s altimeter and the ground radar had been incorrectly calibrated, causing both pilot and ground control to misinterpret the distance and angle at which the aircraft was approaching.

Headquarters Strategic Air Command (SAC) reassigned the 28 BMW from 8th Air Force back to 15th Air Force in October 1955. About one year later, SAC set plans in motion to replace the 28th&#x27;s B-36s with the new all-jet B-52 Stratofortress. The last B-36 left Ellsworth on 29 May 1957 and the first B-52 arrived sixteen days later. In 1958, all base units came under the command of the 821st Strategic Aerospace Division, headquartered at Ellsworth.

====Air Defense Command, 1953–1962====
Air Defense Command (ADC) activated the 740th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron at Rapid City AFB on 1 February 1953 under the ADC 31st Air Division. The site was located on the base, and was given designation M-97. The site was part of the ADC&#x27;s planned deployment of 44 mobile radar stations across the United States to support the permanent air defense radar network established during the Cold War. The squadron was reassigned to the 29th Air Division on 16 February 1953, and Rapid City AFB was re-designated Ellsworth AFB.

The 740th AC&amp;W Squadron began operations in 1955 with AN/MPS-7 search radar, and initially the station functioned as a ground-controlled interception (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron&#x27;s role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit&#x27;s radar scopes.

An AN/MPS-14 height-finder radar was added in 1956. In 1959 an AN/FPS-20A search radar replaced the AN/MPS-7 set. The squadron was reassigned to the Minot Air Defense Sector on 1 January 1961.

Air Defense Command deactivated the Ellsworth radar site on 15 August 1962 and the 740th was discontinued. After M-97 closed, coverage was assumed by Sundance AFS, Wyoming (TM-201/Z-201).

====Nike missiles, 1957–1962====
To provide air defense of the base, the United States Army established the Ellsworth AFB Defense Area in 1957 and constructed Nike-Ajax surface-to-air missile sites. Sites were located near Ellsworth AFB: E-01 was north , E-20 was east-northeast , E-40 was south-southeast , and E-70 was west-southwest . Headquarters facilities were located at Ellsworth. In 1958, batteries E-20, E-40, and E-70 were removed from service and E-01 was converted to fire Nike Hercules missiles. This battery remained in service until 1961 as part of the reduction of the air defenses in the United States against aircraft.

An Army Air-Defense Command Post (AADCP) was established at Ellsworth in 1960 for Nike missile command-and-control functions. The site was equipped with the AN/GSG-5(V) BIRDIE solid-state computer system. The AADCP was integrated with the Air Defense Command general surveillance radar facilities. The AADCP ceased all operations when the ADC radar site shut down in 1962.

After the Army closed their facilities, the military housing at the Nike Integrated Fire Control sites was transferred to control of Ellsworth, and was used as USAF military family housing until about 1990.

====4th Airborne Command and Control Squadron====
From 1 April 1970 to 30 September 1992, the 4th Airborne Command and Control Squadron (ACCS), part of the 28th BMW, provided airborne command post responsibilities with specially modified Boeing EC-135 airborne command post aircraft for Strategic Air Command. The 4th ACCS was the workhorse of Airborne Launch Control System (ALCS) operations. Three dedicated Airborne Launch Control Centers (ALCC) (pronounced &quot;Al-see&quot;), designated ALCC No. 1, ALCC No. 2, and ALCC No. 3 were on ground alert around-the-clock providing ALCS coverage for five of the six Minuteman intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) Wings. These dedicated ALCCs were mostly EC-135A aircraft but sometimes were EC-135C or EC-135G aircraft, depending on availability. ALCC No. 1 was on ground alert at Ellsworth and during a wartime scenario, its role would have been to take off and orbit between the Minuteman Wings at Ellsworth AFB and F.E. Warren AFB, Wyoming, providing ALCS assistance if needed. ALCCs No. 2 and No. 3 were routinely on forward deployed ground alert at Minot AFB, North Dakota. During a wartime scenario, ALCC No. 3&#x27;s role would have been to take off and orbit between the Minuteman ICBM Wings at Minot AFB and Grand Forks AFB, North Dakota, providing ALCS assistance if needed. ALCC No. 2&#x27;s dedicated role was to take off and orbit near the Minuteman ICBM Wing at Malmstrom AFB, Montana, providing ALCS assistance if needed. The 4th ACCS also maintained an EC-135C or EC-135G on ground alert at Ellsworth as the West Auxiliary Airborne Command Post (WESTAUXCP), which was a backup to SAC&#x27;s Looking Glass Airborne National Command Post (ABNCP), as well as a radio relay link between the Looking Glass and ALCCs when airborne. Although equipped with ALCS, the WESTAUXCP did not have a dedicated Minuteman ICBM wing to provide ALCS assistance to.

===B-1B Lancer, 1987–present===
In 1986, the base and the 28 BMW made extensive preparations to phase out the B-52 fleet and become the second home for the advanced B-1B Lancer bomber. Contractors completed new unaccompanied enlisted dormitories in March, a new security police squadron headquarters in October, and gave Ellsworth&#x27;s runway a much-needed facelift. In addition, they completed new aircraft maintenance facilities for the complex new aircraft. The last of the 28 BMW&#x27;s B-52Hs left in early 1986 and in January 1987, the wing received the first of 35 B-1B bombers.

The 12th Air Division moved to Ellsworth on 15 July 1988. This organization was responsible for training B-1B, B-52, and KC-135 Stratotanker aircrews at Ellsworth and other SAC bases in the region. Headquarters SAC activated a third wing, the 99th Strategic Weapons Wing, at Ellsworth on 10 August 1989. This wing assumed primary responsibility for B-1B advanced aircrew training.

===44th Strategic Missile Wing===
====HGM-25A Titan I Missile, 1960–1965====
In October 1960, Ellsworth entered the &quot;Space Age,&quot; with the activation of the 850th Strategic Missile Squadron, initially assigned to the 28 BMW. For more than a year this squadron prepared for the emplacement of HGM-25A Titan I intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM), which finally arrived in 1962, shortly after the activation of the 44th Strategic Missile Wing (44 SMW) in January. Headquarters SAC named the 44th SMW &#x27;host wing&#x27; at Ellsworth. The Titan I Missile retired in 1965.

====LGM-30 Minuteman Missile, 1962–1994====
In July 1962, SAC activated the 66th Missile Squadron, the first of three such units slated to operate 150 LGM-30B Minuteman I ICBMs under the 44th Strategic Missile Wing (SMW). The 67th Missile Squadron joined the 44th in August, followed by the 68th Missile Squadron in September 1962. The older Titan I&#x27;s were inactivated in March 1965.

On 1 June 1971, SAC inactivated the 821st Strategic Aerospace Division and by October of that year, an upgraded LGM-30F Minuteman II also replaced the Minuteman I missiles.

Ellsworth soon became known as one of &quot;The Showplaces of SAC&quot; along with Minot AFB and Grand Forks AFB as it continued to fight the Cold War by maintaining two legs of America&#x27;s strategic triad: strategic bombardment and ICBMs. It carried out these missions for more than 15 years with relatively little change. The 1980s brought many new challenges.

===Modern era, 1990–present===
After the Berlin Wall fell in November 1989, presaging the demise of the Soviet Union, the USAF reshuffled its organizations and resources to meet a shifting, diminishing, threat. On 3 January 1990, SAC re-designated the 812th Combat Support Group as the 812th Strategic Support Wing (812 SSW), which, for a short time, became Ellsworth&#x27;s fourth wing. The 812 SSW consolidated all combat support activities into one organization. On 31 July 1990, SAC replaced the 12th Air Division with the Strategic Warfare Center (SWC), which provided operational command and administrative control over Ellsworth&#x27;s subordinate units. Then, as part of SAC&#x27;s intermediate headquarters and base-level reorganization plan, on 1 September 1991, SAC renamed the 28 BMW the 28th Wing (28 WG), the 44 SMW the 44th Wing (44 WG) and the 99 SWW the 99th Tactics and Training Wing (99 TTW). Ten days later, SAC inactivated both the SWC and the 812 SSW. Once again, the 28th became Ellsworth&#x27;s host organization and it soon absorbed all previous 812 SSW functions. It was also during this period that, in acknowledgment of the elimination of the Warsaw Pact, that the President, via the Secretary of Defense, ordered all strategic nuclear alert operations to stand-down. The decades-long Cold War was over.On 1 June 1992, as part of the first major reorganization since the creation of USAF, the Air Force inactivated Strategic Air Command and assigned Ellsworth&#x27;s organizations (including a renamed 28th Bomb Wing (28 BW)) to the newly activated Air Combat Command (ACC). After less than a year under the new command, the 28th&#x27;s mission changed from that of strategic bombardment to one of worldwide conventional munitions delivery. The mission of the 99th Tactics and Training Wing (later to become the 99th Wing) also continued, albeit slightly modified to fit the requirements of the new force concept.

The 44th Missile Wing, however, had ably accomplished its deterrence mission. On 3 December 1991, the wing permanently pulled the first Minuteman II missile from its silo and on 6 April 1992, the first Minuteman II launch control center shut down. Inactivation of the entire missile complex ended in April 1994. In keeping with its patriotic Minuteman tradition, the 44th Missile Wing formally inactivated on 4 July 1994. Under conditions of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, all of the 44th Missile Wing&#x27;s Minuteman silos and launch control centers were slated for demolition with the exception of Sites Delta-01 and Delta-09. These latter two sites were turned over to the National Park Service for preservation as part of the Minuteman Missile National Historic Site.

In March 1994, Ellsworth welcomed the 34th Bomb Squadron, a Geographically Separate Unit (GSU) that was awaiting airfield upgrades before it could return to its parent organization, the 366th Wing (366 WG), at Mountain Home AFB, Idaho. While under the aegis of the 366 WG, the 34th&#x27;s B-1Bs were part of one of the USAF&#x27;s composite wings, which also included C/D and E model F-15 Eagles, C/D model F-16 Fighting Falcons, and R model KC-135 Stratotankers.

Also during 1994, the USAF selected Ellsworth as the exclusive location from which to conduct a Congressionally mandated operational readiness assessment of the B-1B, known locally as &quot;Dakota Challenge.&quot; After six months of hard work, under both peacetime and simulated wartime conditions, the 28 BW and Ellsworth, relying on extensive personnel, technical and logistical support from sister B-1 units at McConnell, Grand Forks and Dyess Air Force Bases, passed the test &quot;with flying colors&quot;; and proved the B-1 to be a reliable and capable weapons system; the mainstay of America&#x27;s heavy bomber fleet for years to come.

In 1995, the 99th Wing departed Ellsworth for a new assignment at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, although a small contingent formerly attached to that wing remained behind to continue bomber tactics training and radar munitions scoring from a handful of dispersed detachments. The year also saw the inactivation of one of Ellsworth&#x27;s oldest units, the 77th Bomb Squadron. While the unit (as an administrative entity) departed to save USAF dollars for development of new follow-on B-1 munitions, the organization&#x27;s aircraft remained at Ellsworth (in a flying reserve status) under the able care of its sister unit, the 37th Bomb Squadron.

In early 1996 on 26 March, an announcement was made that the 77th Bomb Squadron would soon return to Ellsworth. On 1 April, the squadron again activated at Ellsworth as the geographically separated 34th Bomb Squadron completed its transfer to its new home with the 366th Wing at Mountain Home AFB, Idaho. By June 1998, the 77th had six of its B-1Bs out of the reconstitution reserve. This number balanced those lost by the 34th BS.

In March 1999, the USAF announced a reorganization plan that makes Ellsworth AFB and the 28 BW partners in the new Expeditionary Air Force (EAF) concept, now known as the Air &amp; Space Expeditionary Force (AEF). The 28 BW was named a lead wing in the EAF, which enabled the 77 BS to gain six additional B-1Bs, and Ellsworth AFB to gain about 100 additional military personnel. The expeditionary force construct enables the USAF to respond quickly to any worldwide crisis while making life more predictable for military members.

The summer of 2007 marked the last time that Ellsworth hosted a college/university level Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps Field Training (FT) encampment. All college AFROTC FT encampments were subsequently consolidated at the Air Force Officer Training School at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama.

====Operation Allied Force, 1999====

It was not long before Ellsworth and the 28th Bomb Wing were taking the lead in the AEF concept. Five B-1Bs from the 28th Bomb Wing joined NATO forces in Operation Allied Force and began striking military targets in Kosovo on 1 April 1999. By the end of the conflict in June 1999, B-1Bs from Ellsworth had flown 100 combat missions and dropped over 1,260 tons of Mk 82 general-purpose bombs.

====Operation Enduring Freedom 2001–present====

After the September 11, 2001 attacks, Ellsworth deployed a number of B-1s in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. Aircraft from the 37th BS at Ellsworth AFB joined additional B-1s from the 34th BS at Mountain Home AFB and formed the 34th Expeditionary Bomb Squadron. This squadron, along with other elements from Ellsworth, deployed to Diego Garcia and joined the 28th Air Expeditionary Wing. Their combat mission effectiveness was greater than 95% and they flew 5% of the total strike aircraft missions. They dropped 39% of the total tonnage of bombs, which was more than any other platform. During their deployment the 28th EBS dropped 2,974 JDAMs, 1,471 Mk-82, 135 Mk-84, and 70 CBU-87 bombs. Currently, the 28th Bomb Wing and personnel from Ellsworth Air Force Base continue to be the lead wing for AEF 8, and Ellsworth personnel continue to prepare for ongoing deployments in support of operations around the globe.

====34th BS replaces the 77th BS, 2001====

On 19 September 2001 the &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; of the 34th Bomb Squadron arrived from Mountain Home AFB, Idaho to rejoin the Ellsworth team. Due to a drawdown in the number of active B-1B aircraft in the USAF inventory, the 77th BS at Ellsworth was inactivated.

====Base realignment and closure 2004–2005====
During the 2004 Senate race in South Dakota, Republican challenger John Thune made Ellsworth a campaign issue, stating in a 16 April 2004 appearance at the base that if he were elected over incumbent Democrat and Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle: &quot;It puts Ellsworth in a lot stronger position than having someone who&#x27;s going to be in the minority and someone who doesn&#x27;t have a relationship with the President of the U.S.&quot; In a debate between the two men broadcast on KSFY-TV and KOTA-TV television on 17 October 2004, Thune said: &quot;I think we have got to have somebody that has a relationship with the President of the United States, can work constructively across party lines in the Congress to get this done if we&#x27;re going save Ellsworth&quot; and was later quoted in the &quot;Rapid City Journal&quot; newspaper on 27 October 2004 claiming that: &quot;an all-Democratic congressional delegation would have little political influence if President Bush is elected to a second term.&quot;

On 24 May 2004 campaigning in South Dakota for Thune, Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist said of Daschle: &quot;Who is the president going to listen to more? The majority leader of the Senate, who he works with on almost a daily basis, or a senator from another party who every day is saying things on the floor that demonstrate a lack of support?&quot; also adding: &quot;This time around, the President is appointing who&#x27;s on that BRAC commission, all of them.&quot;

Thune defeated Daschle with 51% of the vote in the election, and president Bush was elected to a second term. Nevertheless, on 13 May 2005, the Department of Defense recommended that Ellsworth Air Force Base be closed. Thune stated in protest he would vote against confirmation of the president&#x27;s nominee for United Nations Ambassador, John Bolton.

On 26 August 2005 the nine-member BRAC commission voted 8–1 to spare Ellsworth from the closure list. Commissioner Harold Gehman said, &quot;We have no savings, we&#x27;re essentially moving the airplanes from one very, very good base to another very, very good base, which are essentially equal.&quot; Senator Thune called the move a good, nonpolitical decision.

====Expansion of bomber training area====
Since 2008, a bomber training area Powder River Training Complex is being expanded to about 28,000 square miles, including portions of Wyoming, Montana and the Dakotas.

====Move to the Eighth Air Force====

* 850-C, 10 miles SE of Sturgis, South Dakota 
* 850-C has been destroyed - after trying to sell it for a few years, owner gave up and let a scrapper excavate and destroy the entire complex

LGM-30 Minuteman ICBM Missile Alert Facilities (MAF) (each controlling 10 missiles) were located as follows:

*66th Missile Squadron (1 Sep 1962 – 1 Sep 1993)

: A-01 19.9 mi S of Howes, SD, 
: B-01 7.5 mi NxNW of Wall SD, 
: C-01 10.1 mi N of Philip SD, 
: *D-01 6.7 mi SxSW of Cottonwood SD, 
:: *D-09 (Launch Facility) 4.4 mi SxSW of Quinn SD, 
:: *Designated as part of the Minuteman Missile National Historic Site
: E-01 6.3 mi NxNE of Kadoka SD, 

*67th Missile Squadron (1 Sep 1962 – 15 Aug 1992)

: F-01 61.0 mi NxNE of Ellsworth AFB, SD. 
: G-01 11.3 mi N of Union Center SD, 
: H-01 10.0 mi SW of Union Center SD, 
: I-01 5.7 mi E of White Owl SD,

: L-01 6.2 mi SxSE of Vale SD, 
: M-01 17.7 mi NxNW of Belle Fourche SD, 
: N-01 6.7 mi NW of Newell SD, 
: O-01 38.5 mi W of Opal, SD, 

A complete list of Minuteman missile launch control facilities and missile silos can be found here.

The Titan-I sites still exist, in various states of abandonment. Site &quot;A&quot; is still fenced, with all the missile silos capped and in place. Most of the concrete roads remain, along with what remains of the launch control blockhouse and several axillary buildings. Site &quot;B&quot; is in similar condition, abandoned with prairie grass in a very remote location. Site &quot;C&quot; also has the three missile silos capped, but much of the concrete has been removed and appears to be part of a grazing rangeland, the outlines of the missile site still very visible in aerial imagery.

Most Minuteman Launch Control Facilities appear to be still in federal government ownership, as after fifteen or more years of inactivation, all are standing but abandoned; the buildings still standing within the locked security fence. Some are used by farmers seemingly. The missile launch sites (again, with the exception of D-09) are all in private ownership, most being used for agricultural use, the remainder abandoned and returning to a natural state.

==Environmental contamination==

Ellsworth Air Force Base is a military superfundsite, listed in August 1990. Contaminants are petroleum products, waste solvents and radioactive waste polluting soil and groundwater. The Air Force has been cleaning up 12 areas, under supervision by EPA, including landfills, a fire protection training area, spill sites, industrial areas and an explosive-ordnance disposal area. Remedies have included groundwater pump-and-treat systems, bio-dechlorination, soil excavation, landfill covers, and institutional controls (fences/signs). In 2007, in-place reductive treatment for groundwater cleanup replaced the pump-and-treat systems. operation and maintenance activities and groundwater monitoring are ongoing.

In February 2014 the air force found 12 places that needed more testing due to possible PFC contamination from A-FFF, a fire-fighting foam. 300 wells across Ellsworth are being sampled for PFCs. in addition a site at the south end of the base, where former firefighters trained using A-FFF will be investigated with field work completed in August 2016.

<doc id="151054" wikidata="Q2565542" url="?curid=151054" title="Rocky Top, Tennessee">
<text>Rocky Top (formerly Coal Creek and Lake City) is a city in Anderson and Campbell counties in the eastern part of the U.S. state of Tennessee, northwest of Knoxville. The population was 1,628 at the 2020 US Census. Most of the community is in Anderson County and is included in the Knoxville Metropolitan Statistical Area. On June 26, 2014, the city officially changed its name from Lake City to Rocky Top, after a last-ditch effort by the copyright owners of the song &quot;Rocky Top&quot; was denied by a federal court.

==History==
===Founding and Coal Creek era===

The town was originally named Coal Creek when it was founded in the early 19th century, after the 1798 Treaty of Tellico opened the area to settlement, taking its name from the stream that runs through the town. Coal Creek and the nearby town of Briceville were the sites of a major lockout of coal miners in 1891, which resulted in the town of Coal Creek being occupied by the state militia for over a year after miners attempted to force an end to the use of unpaid convict labor in the mines. This labor struggle, known as the Coal Creek War, was eventually resolved in the coal miners&#x27; favor with the abolition of Tennessee&#x27;s convict labor program. The Fraterville Mine disaster of 1902 occurred nearby, in the village of Fraterville.

===Lake City era===
The town adopted the name &quot;Lake City&quot; in 1936 after the Tennessee Valley Authority&#x27;s completion of nearby Norris Dam formed an artificial lake, Norris Lake. Some area residents, including the nonprofit Coal Creek Watershed Foundation, urged a return to the old name of &quot;Coal Creek&quot; to commemorate the community&#x27;s heritage.

===Rocky Top era to present day===
In 2013, a business group proposed to construct and operate a water park in the city if its name was changed to &quot;Rocky Top&quot; to take advantage of the song of the same name. On November 7, 2013, Lake City&#x27;s city council voted to ask the Tennessee General Assembly to amend the city charter to adopt the proposed name. The House of Bryant, which owned the copyright to the song, as well as multiple trademarks and copyrights associated with it due to its status as the main University of Tennessee fight song, objected to the name change, asserting that it would violate intellectual property rights. On May 29, U.S. District Judge Thomas A. Varlan denied the House of Bryant&#x27;s request for a preliminary injunction, holding that renaming the town was not likely to be deemed to be a use in commerce as required for trademark infringement.

On June 26, 2014, the name change was official after District Judge Varlan denied a last-minute attempt by House of Bryant to prevent the vote. House of Bryant appealed to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.

As of 2018, the plans for the $100 million water park remain in development as the company in charge of the project was waiting for approval of the land usage by the state government. Since 2014, the City of Rocky Top has seen minimal growth, with several retail and restaurants opening near the I-75 exit in the city&#x27;s limits.

The original Rocky Top in Tennessee is a peak on the border of North Carolina in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, at 35.5642 degrees north latitude, 83.7138 degrees west longitude. It is from Gatlinburg, Tennessee, where the song &quot;Rocky Top&quot; was written in Room 388 of The Gatlinburg Inn in 1967 by Boudleaux and Felice Bryant, but there is no record that the couple were aware of the peak when they wrote the song.

<doc id="151055" wikidata="Q48809" url="?curid=151055" title="Oak Ridge, Tennessee">
<text>Oak Ridge is a city in Anderson and Roane counties in the eastern part of the U.S. state of Tennessee, about west of downtown Knoxville. Oak Ridge&#x27;s population was 31,402 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Knoxville Metropolitan Area. Oak Ridge&#x27;s nicknames include &quot;the Atomic City&quot;, &quot;the Secret City&quot;, and &quot;the City Behind a Fence&quot;.

In 1942, the United States federal government forcibly purchased nearly of farmland in the Clinch River valley for the development of a planned city supporting 75,000 residents. It was constructed with assistance from architectural and engineering firm Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill, from 1942 to 1943. Oak Ridge was established in 1942 as a production site for the Manhattan Project—the massive American, British, and Canadian operation that developed the atomic bomb. Being the site of Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Y-12 National Security Complex, and several private nuclear facilities, scientific and technological development still plays a crucial role in the city&#x27;s economy and culture in general. In 2016, the element tennessine was named for Tennessee, in recognition of the role played by Oak Ridge and other institutions in the state in its discovery. 

==History==
The earliest substantial occupation of the Oak Ridge area occurred during the Woodland period ( – 1000), although artifacts dating to the Paleo-Indian period have been found throughout the Clinch River valley. Two Woodland mound sites—the Crawford Farm Mounds and the Freels Farm Mounds—were uncovered in the 1930s as part of the Norris Basin salvage excavations. Both sites were just southeast of the former Scarboro community. The Bull Bluff site, which was occupied during the Woodland and Mississippian (c. 1000–1600) periods, was uncovered in the 1960s in anticipation of the construction of Melton Hill Dam. Bull Bluff is a cliff immediately southeast of Haw Ridge, opposite Melton Hill Park. 

The Oak Ridge area was largely uninhabited when Euro-American explorers and settlers arrived in the late 18th century, although the Cherokee claimed the land as part of their s. The European-American settlers who founded these communities arrived in the late 1790s after the American Revolutionary War and after the Cherokee signed the Treaty of Holston, ceding what is now Anderson County to the United States.

During the early 19th century, several rural farming communities developed in the Oak Ridge area, namely Edgemoor and Elza in the northeast, East Fork and Wheat in the southwest, Robertsville in the west, and Bethel and Scarboro in the southeast. 

A popular legend holds that John Hendrix (1865-1915), a largely unknown local man, predicted the creation of the city of Oak Ridge around 40 years before construction on the project began. Hendrix lacked any formal education and was a simple logger for much of his life. Following the death of his youngest daughter, Ethel, to diphtheria, and the subsequent departure of his wife and three remaining children, Hendrix began hearing voices in his head. These voices urged him to stay in the woods and pray for guidance for 40 days and 40 nights, which Hendrix proceeded to do. As the story is told, following these 40 days spent in rugged isolation, Hendrix began seeing visions of the future, and he sought to spread his prophetic message to any who would listen. According to published accounts, one vision that he described repeatedly was a description of the city and production facilities built 28 years after his death, during World War II.

The version recalled by neighbors and relatives reported:

Hendrix, in light of his tales of prophetic visions, was considered insane by most and at one point was institutionalized. His grave lies in an area of Oak Ridge now known as the Hendrix Creek Subdivision. There are ongoing concerns over the preservation of his gravestone, as the man who owns the lot adjacent to the grave wishes to build a home there, while members of the Oak Ridge Heritage and Preservation Association are fighting to have a monument placed on the site of his grave.

===Manhattan Project===

In 1942, the United States federal government chose the area as a site for developing materials for the Manhattan Project. Major General Leslie Groves, military head of the Manhattan Project, liked the area for several reasons. Its relatively low population made acquisition affordable, yet the area was accessible by highway and rail, and utilities such as water and electricity were readily available with the recent completion of Norris Dam. The project location was established within a valley. This feature was linear and partitioned by several ridges, providing natural protection against the spread of disasters at the four major industrial plants—so the plants would not blow up &quot;like firecrackers on a string&quot;.

In October 1942, the United States Army Corps of Engineers began acquiring approximately in the Oak Ridge area for the United States&#x27; Manhattan Project. Due to the urgency and secrecy of the Manhattan Project, the Corps&#x27; &quot;declaration of taking&quot; was swift and final. Many residents came home to find eviction notices tacked to their doors. Others found out when their children came home from school with a message from the principal: Senator McKellar wants me to tell you to go home and tell your parents you are going to have to find another place to live.&quot; There was no further explanation as to why. All the students were told was this: &quot;The government is going to take your property for the war effort.&quot; There were several families who had moved to the Oak Ridge area after the displacements by the Tennessee Valley Authority who were displaced again by the Manhattan Project campaign. The average price per acre paid was $46.86.

By March 1943 the Corps had removed the area&#x27;s earlier communities and established fences and checkpoints. Anderson County lost one-seventh of its land and $391,000 in annual property tax revenue. The manner by which the Oak Ridge area was acquired by the government created a tense, uneasy relationship between the Oak Ridge complex and the surrounding towns. Although the area&#x27;s original residents were allowed to be buried in existing cemeteries, every coffin was reportedly opened for inspection. The Corps&#x27; Manhattan Engineer District (MED) managed the acquisition and clearing for what was to be first known as the Clinton Engineer Works. The Y-12, K-25, and S-50, plants were each built in Oak Ridge to separate the fissile isotope uranium-235 from natural uranium, which consists almost entirely of the isotope uranium-238. The X-10 site, now the site of Oak Ridge National Laboratory, was established as a pilot plant for production of plutonium using the Graphite Reactor, used to develop full-scale plutonium production at the Hanford Site.

During construction of the electromagnets required for the uranium separation process at the Y-12 site, a shortage of copper forced the MED to borrow 14,700 tons of silver bullion from the United States Treasury as a copper substitute in wire for the electromagnet coils. 

When the Tennessee Governor Prentice Cooper was officially handed the July 1943 presidential proclamation by a junior officer (a lieutenant)—making Oak Ridge a military district not subject to state control—he tore it up and refused to see the Manhattan Project engineer, Lieutenant Colonel James C. Marshall. The new district engineer, Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth Nichols, had to placate him. Cooper came to see the project (except for the production facilities under construction) on November 3, 1943; and he appreciated the bourbon-laced punch served (although Anderson County was &quot;dry&quot;). 

House and dormitory accommodations to support construction workers contracted to build the Clinton Engineer Works (CEW) in Oak Ridge were basic, consisting of trailers, barracks, and many &quot;hutments&quot; — pre-fabricated five-person huts heated by a central coal-powered furnace. Construction camps were segregated between black workers and white workers. Two of the largest camps were known as Gamble Valley, with up to 4,000 trailer spaces, and Happy Valley which grew from a population of about 5,000 to about 15,000. In addition to trailers and hutments, the camp towns included various recreational buildings (e.g. theaters, bowling alleys), cafeterias, and commissaries. Medical care was provided by Army doctors and hospitals, with civilians paying $2.50 per month ($5 for families) to the medical insurance fund. 

=== Planned community ===
The location and low population helped keep the town a secret, though the settlement grew from 3,000 to 3,750 in 1942 to about 75,000 by 1945. Because of the large number of workers recruited to the area for the Manhattan Project, the Army planned a town for project workers at the eastern end of the valley. The time required for the project&#x27;s completion caused the Army to opt for a relatively permanent establishment rather than an enormous camp. The name &quot;Oak Ridge&quot; was chosen for the settlement in 1943 from suggestions submitted by project employees. The name evoked the settlement&#x27;s location along Black Oak Ridge, and officials thought the rural-sounding name &quot;held outside curiosity to a minimum&quot;. The name was formally adopted in 1949. 

The architectural and engineering firm Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill was contracted to provide the layout for the town and house designs. John O. Merrill moved to Tennessee to take charge of designing the secret buildings at Oak Ridge. He directed the creation of a town, which soon had of roads, of railroad track, ten schools, seven theaters, 17 restaurants and cafeterias, and 13 supermarkets. A library with 9,400 books, a symphony orchestra, sporting facilities, church services for 17 denominations, and a Fuller Brush Company salesman served the new city and its 75,000 residents. No airport was built, for security reasons. Prefabricated modular homes, apartments, and dormitories, many made from cemesto (bonded cement and asbestos) panels, were quickly erected. Streets were laid out in the manner of a &quot;planned community&quot;.

The original streets included several main east-to-west roads, namely the Oak Ridge Turnpike, Tennessee Avenue, Pennsylvania Avenue, Hillside Road, Robertsville Road, and Outer Drive. North-to-south oriented streets connecting these main roads were designated &quot;avenues&quot;, and streets branching off from the avenues were designated &quot;roads&quot;, &quot;places&quot;, &quot;lanes&quot;, or &quot;circles&quot;. &quot;Roads&quot; connected two streets, while &quot;lanes&quot; and &quot;places&quot; were dead ends. The names of the main avenues generally progressed alphabetically from east to west (e.g., Alabama Avenue in the east, Vermont Avenue in the west), and the names of the smaller streets began with the same letter as the main avenue from which they started (e.g., streets connected to Florida Avenue began with &quot;F&quot;).

The dramatic population increase, and the secret nature of the project, meant chronic shortages of housing and supplies during the war years. The town was administered by Turner Construction Company through a subsidiary named the Roane-Anderson Company. For most residents, however, their &quot;landlord&quot; was known as &quot;MSI&quot; (Management Services, Inc.). All workers wore badges. The town was surrounded by guard towers and a fence with seven gates.

=== Segregation and desegregation ===
Oak Ridge was developed by the federal government as a segregated community, required by the Southern bloc of Democrats in Congress to authorize funding for the project. Due to generally holding lower-ranked jobs, their assigned dwellings were predominantly government-built &quot;hutments&quot; (one-room shacks) located very close to the Y-12 plant, in the one residential area designated as colored. Nichols, the MED District Engineer, was told by the main construction contractor for the K-25 plant that the black construction labor force had a large turnover rate, so Nichols gave permission to set up a separate black women&#x27;s camp. When Groves visited the plant with K. T. Keller of Chrysler, Keller saw twelve Black women sweeping the 30-foot wide alley between the production units, and said &quot;Nichols, don&#x27;t you know there is a machine made to sweep a concrete floor like this?&quot; Nichols replied &quot;Sure I do, but these gals can do more than one of those machines&quot;. The men now had an opportunity to &quot;fracas&quot; on Saturday night, and labor turnover had reduced. 

During the war, plans were made for a colored neighborhood of houses equal in quality to those provided for whites, but it was not implemented because of limited resources. After the war, all hutments were dismantled, and a colored neighborhood of permanent houses was developed in the Gamble Valley area of Oak Ridge, which during wartime had been occupied by a white trailer community.

Oak Ridge elementary education prior to 1954 was segregated; it was legally part of the Anderson County system though built and operated primarily with federal funds. Black children could attend only the Scarboro Elementary School. Oak Ridge High School was closed to black students, who had to be bused to Knoxville for an education. Starting in 1950, Scarboro High School was established at Scarboro Elementary School to offer classes for African-American students. In 1955, 85 young Black students from the Scarboro community were the first to enter all-white classes in Oak Ridge High School and Robertsville Junior High School (now Robertsville Middle School). In 2023, on the 68th anniversary, a Scarboro 85 Monument was erected in Oak Ridge.

Robertsville Junior High School, serving the west half of Oak Ridge, was desegregated at the same time as the high school. Elementary schools in other parts of the city and Jefferson Junior High School, serving the east half of the city, were desegregated slowly as African-American families moved into housing outside of Gamble Valley. In 1967 Scarboro Elementary School was closed, and African-American students from Gamble Valley were bused to other schools around the city.

The nearby high school in Clinton was desegregated in the fall of 1956. On October 5, 1958, the school was severely damaged after a series of dynamite explosions. An estimated 75 to 100 sticks of dynamite had been placed in three locations in the building. No one was injured, however the school was closed while being rebuilt. Oak Ridge provided space at a recently vacated elementary school building (the original Linden Elementary School) for the education of high school students from Clinton for two years while Clinton High School was being rebuilt.

Following the &quot;Brown&quot; decision, public accommodations in Oak Ridge were gradually integrated, which took several years. In 1955, the spring-fed Oak Ridge Municipal Outdoor Swimming Pool, which had been completed in June 1945, became integrated. In the early 1960s, Oak Ridge briefly experienced protest picketing against racial segregation in public accommodations, notably outside a local cafeteria and a laundromat.

===Since World War II===
Two years after World War II ended, Oak Ridge was shifted to civilian control, under the authority of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. The Roane Anderson Company administered community functions, including arranging housing and operating buses, under a government contract. In 1959 the town was incorporated. The community adopted a city manager and City Council form of government rather than direct federal control.

The S-50 liquid thermal diffusion plant was demolished soon after the war. The K-25 building, where uranium was enriched by the gaseous diffusion process until 1985 as the Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion Plant (ORGDP), was demolished in 2013–15 under Superfund as well as the other nearby production and support facilities in the years after. Much of the land associated with the former ORGDP has been transferred or leased for private and federal industrial reuse or dedicated as a National Historic Park.

Two of the four major plants created for the wartime bomb production remain in use today:
* Y-12, originally used for electromagnetic separation of uranium, is now used for nuclear weapons processing and materials storage and known as the Y-12 National Security Complex. Y-12 is managed by the National Nuclear Security Administration.
* X-10, site of a graphite test reactor, is now Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL).The Department of Energy (DOE) runs ORNL, a nuclear and high-tech research establishment. 
In 1983, the DOE declassified a report showing that significant amounts of mercury had been released from the Oak Ridge Reservation into the East Fork Poplar Creek between 1950 and 1977. Circa 1989, a federal court ordered the DOE to bring the Oak Ridge Reservation into compliance with federal and state environmental regulations, such as RCRA. In addition, the Oak Ridge Reservation was put on the Environmental Protection Agency&#x27;s National Priorities List as a Superfund site.

Oak Ridge National Laboratory is the largest multipurpose lab in the DOE&#x27;s National Laboratory system. It is home to the Spallation Neutron Source, a $1.4 billion project completed in 2006, and &quot;Titan&quot;, one of the world&#x27;s most powerful scientific supercomputers, which has peak performance of more than one quadrillion operations per second. In June 2018 IBM and ORNL unveiled Summit, the &quot;world&#x27;s fastest supercomputer&quot;, claimed to be more than twice as powerful as the previous world leader, with a peak performance of 200,000 trillion calculations per second.

The Y-12 National Security Complex is a component of the U.S. nuclear weapons complex. The DOE&#x27;s Environmental Management office is conducting an extensive program of decontamination and decommissioning, environmental cleanup, and waste management to remove or stabilize the hazardous residues remaining from decades of government production and research activities.

Oak Ridge&#x27;s scientific heritage is curated in the American Museum of Science and Energy. Its role in the Manhattan Project is preserved in the Manhattan Project National Historical Park (along with sites in Hanford, Washington and Los Alamos, New Mexico), run cooperatively by the National Park Service and the Department of Energy. A bus tour and several virtual tours are available for the public.

==Economy==

The federal government projects at Oak Ridge are reduced in size and scope, but are still the city&#x27;s principal economic activity and one of the largest employers in the Knoxville metropolitan area. The DOE — including the Office of Science, the Office of Environmental Management, and NNSA — owns the federal sites and maintains a major office in the city. Several federal prime contractors fulfill different roles on the Oak Ridge Reservation, including Consolidated Nuclear Security, UCOR (an Amentum-led company), and UT–Battelle.

The DOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information disseminates government research and development information and operates the science.gov website. The Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education, operated by Oak Ridge Associated Universities, conducts research and education programs for the DOE, Department of Homeland Security, and other federal agencies. The Atmospheric Turbulence and Diffusion Division (ATDD), one of several field divisions of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Air Resources Laboratory, is also located in the city. ATDD began under AEC sponsorship in 1948 as a Weather Bureau research office providing meteorological information and expertise for the AEC. Currently its main function is to perform air quality-related research directed toward issues of national and global importance.

The nuclear industry continues to grow in Oak Ridge following the demolition of the K-25 site. To date, more than 1,700 acres of the Oak Ridge Reservation have been transferred to the community that now house other nuclear companies, including Triso-X (nuclear fuel production), Kairos Power (small modular reactor project) and Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation. In September 2024, Oak Ridge was selected by Orano USA as the future site of a new multibillion dollar uranium enrichment facility.

Boeing operated a manufacturing plant in the city beginning in the early 1980s which closed in 2007. IPIX, Remotec (now a subsidiary of Northrop Grumman), ZYP Coatings, and several other technology-based companies have been founded in Oak Ridge, including Greg LeMond&#x27;s carbon fiber-manufacturing business, LeMond Composites. Several radioactive waste processing companies, including EnergySolutions, have operations in Oak Ridge.

The infrastructure that was new in the 1940s is aging. The once-isolated city is now incorporated into the Knoxville metropolitan area. Oak Ridge is now challenged to blend into the suburban orbit of Knoxville as its heritage as a &quot;super secret&quot; government installation subsides. Changing economic forces have led to continuing changes in the commercial sector. For example, the Oak Ridge City Center, a shopping center built in the 1950s and converted to an indoor shopping mall in the 1980s, sat largely empty in the years leading to its eventual partial demolition and redevelopment.

In 2003, the city of Oak Ridge extended its borders west beyond the Clinch River boundary for the annexation of the master planned community, the Preserve at Oak Ridge, paving the way for economic growth into the 21st century. In January 2020, the city council of Oak Ridge approved the &quot;Wilson Street Corridor&quot; project plan, intended to develop and construct a downtown area in the city situated along Wilson Street. The plan consists of a mixed-use development of retail, residential usage, and restaurants with a primary focus of multi-story residential space. 

==Geography==
Immediately northeast of Oak Ridge, the southwestward-flowing Clinch River bends sharply to the southeast for roughly toward Solway, where it turns again to the southwest. After flowing for approximately , the river bends sharply to the northwest at Copper Ridge, and continues in this direction for nearly . At the K-25 plant, the Clinch turns southwest again and flows for another to its mouth along the Tennessee River at Kingston. This series of bends creates a half-rectangle formation—surrounded by water on the northeast, east, and southwest—in which Oak Ridge is situated.

The Oak Ridge area is striated by five ridges that run roughly parallel to one another in a northeast-to-southwest direction. In order from west-to-east, the five ridges are Blackoak Ridge (which connects the Elza and K-25 bends of the Clinch and thus &quot;walls off&quot; the half-rectangle), East Fork Ridge, Pine Ridge, Chestnut Ridge, and Haw Ridge. The five ridges are divided by four valleys: East Fork Valley (between Blackoak Ridge and East Fork Ridge), Gamble Valley (between East Fork Ridge and Pine Ridge), Bear Creek Valley (between Pine Ridge and Chestnut Ridge), and Bethel Valley (between Chestnut and Haw). These ridges and valleys are part of the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians physiographic province. The main section of the city is located in the northeast, where East Fork and Pine Ridge give way to low, scattered hills. Many of the city&#x27;s residences are located along the relatively steep northeastern slope of Blackoak Ridge.

The completion of Melton Hill Dam (along the Clinch near Copper Ridge) in 1963 created Melton Hill Lake, which borders the city on the northeast and east. The lakefront on the east side of the city is a popular recreation area, with bicycling trails and picnic areas lining the shore. The lake is well known as a venue for rowing competitions. Watts Bar Lake, an impoundment of the Tennessee River which covers the lower of the Clinch, borders Oak Ridge to the south and southwest.

<text>Oliver Springs is a town in Anderson, Morgan, and Roane counties in the U.S. state of Tennessee. Its population was 3,231 at the 2010 census. It is included in the Harriman, Tennessee Micropolitan Statistical Area, which consists of Roane County.

==History==

Oliver Springs was founded in 1821 as Winter&#x27;s Gap. It was named for its first permanent settler of European descent, Major Moses Winters, who had settled in the area before 1799.

Before that time, the area around Oliver Springs had been used by Native Americans as a hunting ground and campsite. Natural mineral springs and abundant wildlife on Windrock Mountain encouraged Native Americans to stay. The springs, whose reputation for miraculous medicinal properties lasted until the 20th century, were called &quot;Tah-hah-lehaha&quot;, which meant &quot;healing waters&quot; in the Cherokee language.

The land remained unexplored by European settlers until 1761. At this time, a long hunting expedition led by Elisha Walden explored much of the Clinch and Powell River valleys. However, settlement in the area did not begin in earnest until the 1790s, and growth remained slow.

In 1826, Richard Oliver became the town&#x27;s first postmaster. The town was renamed Oliver&#x27;s Springs in his honor. The town&#x27;s name was briefly changed to Poplar Springs, and then to Oliver Springs. Oliver provided mail service from his 35-room mansion, which also served as an inn. He was the first to develop the commercial potential of the mineral springs. He would transport his guests between the springs and the inn. During the Civil War, the inn was used as a hospital by both sides.
Joseph Richards bought Oliver&#x27;s land in 1873. He built the first resort hotel, and in 1894 replaced this first structure with a 150-room hotel with then-modern amenities. Oliver Springs became a popular resort town. The Oliver Springs Hotel catered to wealthy guests, who came from all over the U.S. and Europe to drink the waters and bathe in the springs. In 1888, the railroad came to Oliver Springs and brought thousands of visitors to the springs.

The hotel burned in 1905. The town decided to cover the springs rather than rebuild the hotel. Evidence of water conduits and reservoirs can still be seen on the site.

Oliver Springs had a base camp during the Coal Creek War in the 1890s.

In the early part of the 20th-century, the area became dependent on the coal industry. According to historian Keith Glass, the Windrock Coal and Coke Company, a subsidiary of the Bessemer Coal, Iron and Land Company of Birmingham, began operating a coal mine near Oliver Springs &quot;circa&quot; 1904.

In 1942, during World War II, the U.S. government bought up the neighboring communities of Robertsville, Edgemoor, East Fork, Elza, Bethel, Scarborough, and Wheat and built the secret city of Oak Ridge as part of the Manhattan Project. During this period, one of the most prominent buildings in Oliver Springs — the Dr. Fred Stone Sr. Hospital — was built by Dr. Fred Stone, who worked as a physician and examiner for new Manhattan Project employees. Eventually, the economy of Oliver Springs became dependent on government employment in Oak Ridge, and suffered when employment levels declined at the end of the Cold War in the early 1990s.

In the years following the end of the Cold War, Oliver Springs and its neighbors have struggled to re-establish a solid foundation on which to base their economies. Oliver Springs has experimented with several industries. In the late 1990s, the movie &quot;October Sky&quot; was filmed in nearby coal mining areas as well as the city&#x27;s downtown area. Currently, the local economy is beginning to take advantage of the mountains, which are very popular among all-terrain vehicle (ATV) riders.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land. The town lies at the northwestern boundary between the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians and the Cumberland Plateau. Walden Ridge, which marks the boundary between these two physiographic provinces, is visible just beyond the immediate hill tops. The Crab Orchard Mountains, which comprise the southern extreme of the Cumberland Mountains, rise atop the Cumberland Plateau just west of Oliver Springs.

<doc id="151057" wikidata="Q2265487" url="?curid=151057" title="Seymour, Tennessee">
<text>Seymour is a census-designated place (CDP) and unincorporated community in Blount and Sevier counties in the U.S. state of Tennessee. The CDP population was 14,705 at the 2020 U.S. census. It is part of the Knoxville, Tennessee Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

Seymour was originally the site of Newell&#x27;s Station, a frontier station established by early Sevier County pioneer Samuel Newell (1754–1841) in 1783. The first court of Sevier County, State of Franklin, was held at Newell&#x27;s Station in March 1785. During the 19th century, the community was known as Trundles Crossroads where the main road from Sevierville forked, with one branch continuing northward to Knoxville and one branch westward to Maryville (now the intersection of Boyds Creek Highway and Old Sevierville Pike).

After the completion of the Knoxville, Sevierville and Eastern Railway on December 18, 1909, the community&#x27;s station was named Seymour in honor of the line&#x27;s chief engineer, Charles Seymour. The Trundles Crossroads Post Office changed its name soon afterwards to reflect the community&#x27;s designation.

=== Unsuccessful attempts to incorporate ===
On multiple occasions, residents have met to discuss the possibility of incorporating as a town or city. The majority of residents have opposed incorporation, arguing it would bring higher taxes and expanded government, while others say that the community would benefit from having a community center, along with sidewalks that might be constructed with the added revenue. Some Blount County residents want their portion of the 37865 zip code to be included within the proposed city limits; however the incorporation meeting was geared primarily toward the Sevier County portion of the community. In the end, the voters overwhelmingly voted to keep Seymour unincorporated.

==Geography==
Seymour is located in the northwest corner of Sevier County and the northeast corner of Blount County. The community is situated in a rolling valley where the foothills of the Great Smoky Mountains give way to the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians. Bluff Mountain, the northern terminus of the Chilhowee Mountain ridge, rises prominently to the south while the Bays Mountain ridge passes to the north.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which , or 0.07%, is water.

Chapman Highway (part of U.S. Route 441) traverses Seymour, connecting the community with Knoxville to the northwest. Near the center of Seymour, Chapman Highway forms a four-way intersection with U.S. Route 411, which approaches from Maryville to the west, and Boyds Creek Highway (State Route 338), which approaches from Boyds Creek to the east. At the intersection, Chapman Highway merges with US 411 and continues eastward to Sevierville.

==Demographics==

As of the 2020 United States census, there were 14,705 people, 4,403 households, and 3,181 families residing in the CDP.

===2000 census===

The average household size was 2.57 and the average family size was 2.93. In the CDP, the population was spread out, with 24.3% under the age of 18, 7.8% from 18 to 24, 29.5% from 25 to 44, 26.6% from 45 to 64, and 11.8% who were aged 65 years or older. The median age was 38 years. For every 100 females, there were 95.4 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 91.3 males.

The median income for a household in the CDP was $40,896, and the median income for a family was $45,244. Males had a median income of $30,568 versus $24,611 for females.

<text>Vonore is a town in Monroe County and Blount County, Tennessee, in the southeastern portion of the state. The population was 1,574 as of the 2020 census. The city hall, library, community center, police department, and fire department are located on Church Street.

==History==

Vonore developed at the confluence of the Little Tennessee River and the Tellico River, a place of indigenous settlement for thousands of years. It was a center of numerous Cherokee towns along the rivers.

Vonore is near the center of one of the richest archaeological regions in the southeastern United States. The now-submerged Icehouse Bottom site was occupied by indigenous cultures in the region as early as 7500 B.C.

The now-submerged Rose Island was home to a significant Woodland period (c. 1000 B.C. – 1000 A.D.) settlement. Later the Cherokee had the town there known as Mialoguo. A substantial South Appalachian Mississippian period (c. 1000–1600 A.D.) village was located at Toqua, immediately south of present-day Vonore. There is some evidence that Toqua&#x27;s Mississippian village was the village of &quot;Tali&quot;, recorded as visited by the Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto&#x27;s expedition in 1540. The historic Cherokee also had a town at Toqua.

This area was part of the homelands of the historic Cherokee people, which extended into western Virginia, North and South Carolina, and northeastern Georgia, long before these colonies or states were founded. By the time Euro-American explorers arrived in the area in the 18th century, the Cherokee had established several towns along the Little Tennessee. They included Tanasi, the name source for the state of Tennessee, Chilowhee, and Chota, the &quot;mother town&quot; of the Overhill Cherokee in the mid to late 18th century. The English traders and colonists referred to these places as the Overhill Towns, because they crossed the Appalachian Mountains from the east to reach them. Cherokee chief Dragging Canoe came from Mialoquo, which was located just north of the site of the modern US-411 bridge. Tuskegee, which developed adjacent to Fort Loudoun, was the birthplace of Sequoyah (c. 1770–1843), creator of the written Cherokee syllabary.

Fort Loudoun was a British colonial-era fort built in 1756 as part of their promise to the Cherokee of supporting their people, to gain an alliance against the French and Indian allies during the French and Indian War. It was one of the first major British outposts west of the Appalachian Mountains. It was garrisoned only until 1760, when the Cherokee captured it after a lengthy siege, in retaliation for the murder of Cherokee chiefs by South Carolina officials.

After the American Revolutionary War, the United States built the Tellico Blockhouse in 1794, an American outpost located across the Tellico River from Fort Loudoun. It was designed to hold a garrison to help keep the peace between the Cherokee and the fast-encroaching American settlers. The Tellico agent, the chief American diplomat to the Cherokee, operated out of the blockhouse and ran a trading post there for a decade. He was married to a Cherokee woman.

In 1819, the Cherokee signed the Calhoun Treaty, ceding what is now Monroe County to the United States. The county was established shortly thereafter.

Niles Ferry, the primary crossing of the Little Tennessee River along the Old Federal Road (the predecessor of US-411), was established in 1805 by early settler Barclay McGhee. He leased the rights from the US Tellico agent. The ferry operated at this site until 1947, when the US-411 bridge was completed. Barclay McGhee operated the ferry until his death in 1819. It eventually was owned by his son, John McGhee. The ferry is named for J.W.J. Niles, a son-in-law of John McGhee who assumed ownership of the ferry in the 1850s.

In 1890, the Atlanta, Knoxville and Northern Railroad laid tracks through Monroe County. A stopover known as Upton Station was established just beyond the railroad&#x27;s Little Tennessee River crossing. Three years later, area doctor Walter Kennedy applied for a post office for Upton Station. When the US postal service informed him that the name of Upton Station had been taken, Kennedy chose the name &quot;Vonore&quot;, a combination of the German word &quot;von&quot; (meaning &quot;of&quot;) and the English word &quot;ore&quot;, as Kennedy believed the town would become a mining town.

In the 1930s during the Great Depression, preservationists aided by Works Progress Administration (WPA) funds of President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s administration reconstructed Fort Loudoun. This served as the anchor for a state historic park along the river.

The older part of town developed along Depot and Hall streets. In the 21st century, it includes many older houses, the library, the town hall, and other municipal buildings. A more modern retail corridor, with numerous franchises, spans most of the Vonore section of US-411.

Most of the valley&#x27;s archaeological sites were flooded in 1979 when the Tennessee Valley Authority completed Tellico Dam at the mouth of the Little Tennessee. Additional reconstruction of Fort Loudoun was undertaken in the 1970s and 1980s. The fort was moved above the range of the water level of the newly created reservoir.

Archaeological surveys and excavations were undertaken along the Little Tennessee River prior to flooding in order to salvage artifacts from known pre-historic and historic sites, including the Cherokee town sites of Tanasi and Chota, and the early US federal period Tellico Blockhouse.

Sites were established above the level of the flood waters, with monuments to mark these two important Cherokee town sites. The one at Chota has eight plaques: seven for the Cherokee clans and one for the nation overall.

Excavators also located the foundation of the Tellico Blockhouse. An area was raised above the water level, and posts and fill were place in order to show visitors its layout on the historic site. The Tanasi and Tellico Blockhouse sites are both now within Fort Loudoun State Park.

==Geography==
Vonore is located along the northern border of Monroe and Blount Counties. The eastern portion extends into Blount County along Ninemile Creek and around the Ft Loudon State Park. Vonore is situated primarily along the southwestern bank of the Little Tennessee River at its confluence with the Tellico River. This section of the Little Tennessee and the lower Tellico River are both part of Tellico Lake, an artificial reservoir created by Tellico Dam.

<text>Johnson City is a city in Washington, Carter, and Sullivan counties in the U.S. state of Tennessee, mostly in Washington County. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 71,046, making it the eighth-most populous city in Tennessee. Johnson City is the principal city of the Johnson City Metropolitan Statistical Area, which consists of Carter, Unicoi, and Washington counties and had a population of 207,285 as of 2020. The MSA is also a component of the Tri-Cities region. This CSA is the fifth-largest in Tennessee, with a population of 514,899 as of 2020.

==History==
William Bean, traditionally recognized as Tennessee&#x27;s first white settler, built his cabin along Boone&#x27;s Creek near Johnson City in 1769. In the 1780s, Colonel John Tipton (1730–1813) established a farm (now the Tipton-Haynes State Historic Site) just outside what is now Johnson City. During the State of Franklin movement, Tipton was a leader of the loyalist faction, residents of the region who wanted to remain part of North Carolina rather than form a separate state. In February 1788, an armed engagement took place at Tipton&#x27;s farm between Tipton and his men and the forces led by John Sevier, the leader of the Franklin faction.

Founded in 1856 by Henry Johnson as a railroad station called &quot;Johnson&#x27;s Depot&quot;, Johnson City became a major rail hub for the Southeast, as three railway lines crossed in the downtown area.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Johnson City served as headquarters for the narrow gauge East Tennessee and Western North Carolina Railroad (the &quot;ET&amp;WNC&quot;, nicknamed &quot;Tweetsie&quot;) and the standard gauge Clinchfield Railroad. Both rail systems featured excursion trips through scenic portions of the Blue Ridge Mountains and were engineering marvels of railway construction. The Southern Railway (now Norfolk Southern) also passes through the city.

During the American Civil War, before it was formally incorporated in 1869, the name of the town was briefly changed to &quot;Haynesville&quot; in honor of Confederate Senator Landon Carter Haynes.

Henry Johnson&#x27;s name was quickly restored following the war, with Johnson elected as the city&#x27;s first mayor on January 3, 1870. The town grew rapidly from 1870 until 1890 as railroad and mining interests flourished. However, the national depression of 1893, which caused many railway failures (including the Charleston, Cincinnati and Chicago Railroad or &quot;3-Cs&quot;, a predecessor of the Clinchfield) and resulting financial panic, halted Johnson City&#x27;s boom town momentum.

In 1901, the Mountain Branch of the National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers (now the U.S. Veterans Affairs Medical Center and National Cemetery), Mountain Home, Tennessee was created by an act of Congress introduced by Walter P. Brownlow. Johnson City began growing rapidly and became the fifth-largest city in Tennessee by 1930.

Together with neighboring Bristol, Johnson City was a hotbed for old-time music. It hosted noteworthy Columbia Records recording sessions in 1928 known as the Johnson City Sessions. Native son &quot;Fiddlin&#x27; Charlie&quot; Bowman became a national recording star via these sessions. The Fountain Square area in downtown featured a host of local and traveling street entertainers including Blind Lemon Jefferson.

During the 1920s and the Prohibition era, Johnson City&#x27;s ties to the bootlegging activity of the Appalachian Mountains earned the city the nickname of &quot;Little Chicago&quot;. 

For many years, the city had a municipal &quot;privilege tax&quot; on carnival shows, in an attempt to dissuade traveling circuses and other transient entertainment businesses from doing business in town. The use of drums by merchants to draw attention to their goods is prohibited. Title Six, Section 106 of the city&#x27;s municipal code, the so-called &quot;Barney Fife&quot; ordinance, empowers the city&#x27;s police force to draft into involuntary service as many of the town&#x27;s citizens as necessary to aid police in making arrests and in preventing or quelling any riot, unlawful assembly or breach of peace.
