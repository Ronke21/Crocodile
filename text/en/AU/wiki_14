<text>Queer theory is a field of post-structuralist critical theory that emerged in the early 1990s out of queer studies (formerly often known as gay and lesbian studies) and women&#x27;s studies. The term &quot;queer theory&quot; is broadly associated with the study and theorization of gender and sexual practices that exist outside of heterosexuality, and which challenge the notion that heterosexuality is what is normal. Following social constructivist developments in sociology, queer theorists are often critical of what they consider essentialist views of sexuality and gender. Instead, they study those concepts as social and cultural phenomena, often through an analysis of the categories, binaries, and language in which they are said to be portrayed.

Scholars associated with the development of queer theory are French post-structuralist philosopher Michel Foucault, and American feminist authors Gloria Anzaldúa, Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, and Judith Butler. 

==History==

Informal use of the term &quot;queer theory&quot; began with Gloria Anzaldúa and other scholars in the 1990s, themselves influenced by the work of French post-structuralist philosopher Michel Foucault, who viewed sexuality as socially constructed and rejected identity politics. 

Teresa de Lauretis organized the first queer theory conference in 1990. David Halperin, an early queer theorist, writes in his article &quot;The Normalization of Queer Theory&quot; that de Lauretis&#x27; usage was somewhat controversial at first, as she chose to combine the word &quot;queer&quot; which was just starting to be used in a &quot;gay-affirmative sense by activists, street kids, and members of the art world,&quot; and the word &quot;theory&quot; which was seen as very academically weighty. In the early 1990s, the term started to become legitimized in academia.

Although it is an academic discipline that gained traction within academia, queer theory&#x27;s roots can also be traced back to activism, with the reclaiming of the derogatory term &quot;queer&quot; as an umbrella term for those who do not identify with heteronormativity in the 1980s. This would continue on in the 1990s, with Queer Nation&#x27;s use of &quot;queer&quot; in their protest chants, such as &quot;We&#x27;re here! We&#x27;re queer! Get used to it!&quot;

As an academic discipline, queer theory itself was developed by American academics Judith Butler at University of California, Berkley, and Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick at Duke University. 

Other early queer theorists include Michael Warner, Lauren Berlant, and Adrienne Rich.

==Definition==
The term &quot;queer&quot; itself intentionally remains loosely defined in order to encompass the difficult-to-categorize spectrum of gender, sexuality and romantic attraction. Similarly, queer theory remains difficult to objectively define as academics from various disciplines have contributed varying understanding of the term. At its core, queer theory relates to queer people, their lived experience and how their lived experience is culturally or politically perceived, specifically referring to the marginalization of queer people. This thinking is then applied to various fields of thinking.

In an influential essay, Michael Warner argued that queerness is defined by what he called &#x27;heteronormativity&#x27;; those ideas, narratives and discourses which suggest that heterosexuality is the default, preferred, or normal mode of sexual orientation. Warner stated that while many thinkers had been theorising sexuality from a non-heterosexual perspective for perhaps a century, queerness represented a distinctive contribution to social theory for precisely this reason. Lauren Berlant and Warner further developed these ideas in their seminal essay, &quot;Sex in Public&quot;. Critics such as Edward Carpenter, Guy Hocquenghem and Jeffrey Weeks had emphasised what they called the &#x27;necessity of thinking about sexuality as a field of power, as a historical mode of personality, and as the site of an often critical utopian aim&#x27;. Whereas the terms &#x27;homosexual&#x27;, &#x27;gay&#x27; or &#x27;lesbian&#x27; which they used signified particular identities with stable referents (i.e. to a certain cultural form, historical context, or political agenda whose meanings can be analysed sociologically), the word &#x27;queer&#x27; is instead defined in relation to a range of practices, behaviours and issues that have meaning only in their shared contrast to categories which are alleged to be &#x27;normal&#x27;. Such a focus highlights the indebtedness of queer theory to the concept of normalisation found in the sociology of deviance, particularly through the work of Michel Foucault, who studied the normalisation of heterosexuality in his work &quot;The History of Sexuality&quot;.

In &quot;The History of Sexuality&quot;, Foucault argues that repressive structures in society police the discourse concerning sex and sexuality and are thus relegated in the private sphere. As a result, heterosexuality is normalized while homosexuality (or queerness) is stigmatized. Foucault then points out that this imposed secrecy has led to sexuality as a phenomenon that needs to be frequently confessed and examined. Foucault&#x27;s work is particularly important to queer theory in that he describes sexuality as a phenomenon that &quot;must not be thought of as a kind of natural given which power tries to hold in check&quot; but rather &quot;a historical construct.&quot; Judith Butler extends this idea of sexuality as a social construct to gender identity in &quot;Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity&quot;, where they theorize that gender is not a biological reality but rather something that is performed through repeated actions.

Because this definition of queerness does not have a fixed reference point, Judith Butler has described the subject of queer theory as a site of &#x27;collective contestation&#x27;. They suggest that &#x27;queer&#x27; as a term should never be &#x27;fully owned, but always and only redeployed, twisted, queered from a prior usage and in the direction of urgent and expanding political purposes&#x27;. While proponents argue that this flexibility allows for the constant readjustment of queer theory to accommodate the experiences of people who face marginalisation and discrimination on account of their sexuality and gender, critics allege that such a &#x27;subjectless critique&#x27;, as it is often called, runs the risk of abstracting cultural forms from their social structure, political organization, and historical context, reducing social theory to a mere &#x27;textual idealism&#x27;.

==Analysis of same-sex partnerships==
Queer theory deals with the micro level (the identity of the individual person), the meso level (the individual in their immediate groups such as family, friends, and work), and the macro level (the larger context of society, culture, politics, policies and law). Accordingly, queer theory not only examines the communities surrounding the queer people, but also the communities they form. Same-sex living communities have a significant priority in the formation of a queer theory. The standard work of Andreas Frank, &quot;Committed Sensations&quot;, highlights comprehensively the life situation of coming out, homosexuality and same-sex communities to the millennium.

== Queer theory and communication studies ==
As an interdisciplinary concept, queer theory is applied to different disciplines, including communication studies and research. It was introduced to the field of communication through Jeffrey Ringer&#x27;s &quot;Queer Words, Queer Images: Communication and the Construction of Homosexuality&quot; in 1994, which offered a queer perspective to communication research findings. Queer theory has also contributed to communication research by challenging the heteronormative society&#x27;s notions of what&#x27;s considered deviant and taboo—what is considered normative and non-normative.

==Queering family communication==
Queer theory&#x27;s interdisciplinarity is evident in its application in and critique of family communication. One of the criticisms regarding family communication is its focus on &quot;mainstream&quot; families, often focusing on heterosexual parents and children.

Although more studies on family communication have started to include nontraditional families, critical rhetorical scholar Roberta Chevrette argues that researchers continue to look at nontraditional families, including families with openly queer members, from a heteronormative lens. That is, when studying LGBTQ+ families, many scholars continue to compare these families to their cis-heterosexual counterparts&#x27; norms. As Chevrette writes, &quot;Queering family communication requires challenging ideas frequently taken for granted and thinking about sexual identities as more than check marks.&quot;

Chevrette describes four ways that scholars can &quot;queer&quot; family communication: (1) revealing the biases and heteronormative assumptions in family communication; (2) challenging the treatment of sexuality and queerness as a personal and sensitive topic reserved for the private sphere rather than the public; (3) interpreting identity as a socially constructed phenomenon and sexuality as being fluid in order to expose the ways gender roles and stereotypes are reinforced by notions of identity and sexuality as being fixed; and (4) emphasizing intersectionality and the importance of studying different identity markers in connection with each other.

== Queer theory in philosophy ==
In the field of philosophy, queer theory falls under an adjacent category to critical disability theory and feminist theory for their similar approaches in defending communities discriminated against by questioning a societal status quo. Although all three are distinct fields of study, they all work towards a common activist goal of inclusion.

Critical disability theory is a comprehensive term that is used to observe, discuss and question how people marginalized due to a difference in their social context (such as physical or mental disability as well as any other difference that would cause them to be othered in society) are treated in society.

==Lens for power==
Queer theory is the lens used to explore and challenge how scholars, activists, artistic texts, and the media perpetrate gender- and sex-based binaries, and its goal is to undo hierarchies and fight against social inequalities. Due to controversy about the definition of &quot;queer&quot;, including whether the word should even be defined at all or should be left deliberately open-ended, there are many disagreements and often contradictions within queer theory. In fact, some queer theorists, like Berlant and Warner and Butler, have warned that defining it or conceptualizing it as an academic field might only lead to its inevitable misinterpretation or destruction, since its entire purpose is to critique academia rather than become a formal academic domain itself.

Fundamentally, queer theory does not construct or defend any particular identity, but instead, grounded in post-structuralism and deconstruction, it works to actively critique heteronormativity, exposing and breaking down traditional assumptions that sexual and gender identities are presumed to be heterosexual or cisgender.

==Intersectionality and queer theory==

The concept of queer theory has emerged from multiple avenues that challenge the definition of normality. However, institutions often tend to prioritize one marginalized group over others, resulting in limited social change. As activist Charlene A. Carruthers describes in her book &quot;Unapologetic&quot;, it is important to imagine &quot;alternative economics, alternative family structures, or something else entirely&quot; from an imagination of cross-sectional communities – such as her stance as a Black queer feminist. Imagination is a crucial aspect of queer theory. It is a tool for creating new worlds that are currently not viable for under-represented or oppressed communities, prompting a transformative stance to current norms. An intersectional approach decentralizes queer theory and thus shifts power to a more radical set of narratives, aligning with the definition of queerness itself: challenging prominent, white, and heterosexual discourses.

According to critical theorist Daniel J. Gil De Lamadrid, intersectionality can be used to examine how queer identity is racialized as normatively white, and the intersectional stigma and resistance that comes from such racialization.

Intersectionality recognizes that complex identities and social categories form from &quot;structured multiple oppression.&quot; Therefore, the personal identities of intersectional people are inherently political. Groups such as the Human Rights Campaign have previously employed this understanding in formal rights advocacy for queer legal protection. However, queer theorists and activists like Lisa Duggan have noted that such groups prioritize the voices of some groups over others by focusing on specific identities like &quot;gay middle-class men&quot; rather than complex and intersectional ones. They have emphasized the importance of intersectionality in queer discourse and activism. New directions in queer intersectionality include Jones&#x27; &quot;euphorias&quot; studies showing intersectional differences in diverse LGBTIQA+ peoples&#x27; experiences of happiness. Specifically, Jones found that happiness was often used as a reward for performance of intersectional normativity; those who were lesbian and yet also cisgender and mothers were more likely to experience euphoric moments even in discriminatory settings. However, LGBTIQA+ people who had &quot;other othered&quot; identities such as disabilities were less likely to report experiencing euphoria. Jones argues being euphorically queer should not presume typical happiness narrative arcs and should make room for negativity; queer diverse people will need to critique society and critique critique of society but can still be euphoric about being queer and intersectional.

== Criticisms ==
According to Adam Isaiah Green, a professor at the University of Toronto, queer theory might be doing a disservice to the study of queer people for, among other reasons, unduly doing away with categories of sexuality and gender that had an explanatory role in their original context. He argues that for instance the lesbians documented in Cherry Grove, Fire Island chose to identify specifically as either &quot;ladies&quot;, &quot;dykes&quot; or &quot;postfeminists&quot; for generational, ethnic and class reasons. While they have a shared sexuality, flattening their diversity of identity, culture and expression to &quot;the lesbian community&quot; might be undue and hide the social contigencies that queer theory purports to foreground (race, class, ethnicity, gender).

According to Joshua Gamson, due to its engagement in social deconstruction, it is nearly impossible for queer theory to talk about a &quot;lesbian&quot; or &quot;gay&quot; subject, as all social categories are denaturalized and reduced to discourse. Thus, according to Adam I. Green, queer theory can only examine discourses and not subjectivities.

A recurring criticism of queer theory, which often employs sociological jargon, is that it is written, according to Brent Pickett, by a &quot;small ideologically oriented elite&quot; and possesses an evident social class bias. It is not only class biased but also, in practice, only really referred to at universities and colleges. Likewise, Ros Coward writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, says that advocates of queer theory are like other elite academics that engage in obscurantism with their use of jargon to protect their field from outside criticism and fail to deconstruct their own role and perspective as academics at elite institutions.

For some feminists, queer theory undermines feminism by blurring the boundaries between gendered social classes, which it explains as personal choices rather than consequences of social structures.

Bruno Perreau, the Cynthia L. Reed Professor of French Studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, discusses various facets of the French response to queer theory, from the mobilization of activists and the seminars of scholars to the emergence of queer media and translations. Perreau sheds new light on events around gay marriage in France, where opponents to the 2013 law saw queer theory as a threat to French family. Perreau questions the return of French Theory to France from the standpoint of queer theory, thereby exploring the way France conceptualizes America. By examining mutual influences across the Atlantic, he seeks to reflect on changes in the idea of national identity in France and the United States, offering insight on recent attempts to theorize the notion of &quot;community&quot; in the wake of Maurice Blanchot&#x27;s work. Perreau offers in his book a theory of minority politics that considers an ongoing critique of norms as the foundation of citizenship, in which a feeling of belonging arises from regular reexamination of it.

In their work &quot;Cynical Theories&quot;, scholars Helen Pluckrose and James A. Lindsay characterize the largely unscientific view on biology and objective reality as an intentional feature. They state that, &quot;queer theory is a political project and its aim is to disrupt&quot;. As such within it, &quot;there can be absolutely no quarter given to any discourse—even matters of scientific fact—that could be interpreted as promoting biological essentialism.&quot; Thus, according to them, queer theory knowingly misrepresents biological facts and research, especially on intersex people, to conflate them with completely unrelated issues concerning constructed gender identities such as transgender.

==Queer theory in online discourse==
One of the ways queer theory has made its way into online discourse is through the popularity of Adrienne Rich&#x27;s 1980 essay &quot;Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence&quot;. Rich&#x27;s theory regarding compulsory heterosexuality (or comp-het)—the socio-cultural expectation that women must be attracted to men and desire a romantic heterosexual relationship—inspired the creation of the &quot;lesbian masterdoc&quot;, a 30-page Google Document originally written in 2018 by Anjeli Luz, a Tumblr user who was in the midst of questioning her own sexuality as a teenager.

Katelyn McKenna and John Bargh&#x27;s studies of online groups consisting of marginalized groups found an interesting phenomenon called &quot;identity demarginalization&quot; — how participation in a group consisting of people with shared marginalized identity can lead to a higher level of self-acceptance, which could lead to eventually coming out to their friends and family.

Online groups and interactions also contribute to normalizing queerness and challenging heteronormativity by serving as a networked counterpublic. Sarah Jackson, Moya Bailey, and Brooke Foucault Welles&#x27; discourse analysis of the hashtag #GirlsLikeUs shows how trans women have used the hashtag to build community in ways that normalize being trans and offering counter-narratives to the often stereotypical and caricatured portrayal of trans people&#x27;s lives in popular mainstream media.

<text>Chlorpromazine (CPZ), marketed under the brand names Thorazine and Largactil among others, is an antipsychotic medication. It is primarily used to treat psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia. Other uses include the treatment of bipolar disorder, severe behavioral problems in children including those with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, nausea and vomiting, anxiety before surgery, and hiccups that do not improve following other measures. It can be given orally (by mouth), by intramuscular injection (injection into a muscle), or intravenously (injection into a vein).
Chlorpromazine is in the typical antipsychotic class, and, chemically, is one of the phenothiazines. Its mechanism of action is not entirely clear but is believed to be related to its ability as a dopamine antagonist. It has antiserotonergic and antihistaminergic properties.
Common side effects include movement problems, sleepiness, dry mouth, low blood pressure upon standing, and increased weight. Serious side effects may include the potentially permanent movement disorder tardive dyskinesia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, severe lowering of the seizure threshold, and low white blood cell levels. In older people with psychosis as a result of dementia, it may increase the risk of death. It is unclear if it is safe for use in pregnancy.
Chlorpromazine was developed in 1950 and was the first antipsychotic on the market. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. Its introduction has been labeled as one of the great advances in the history of psychiatry. It is available as a generic medication.

==Medical uses==
Chlorpromazine is used in the treatment of both acute and chronic psychoses, including schizophrenia and the manic phase of bipolar disorder, as well as amphetamine-induced psychosis.

Controversially, some psychiatric patients may be given Chlorpromazine by force, even if they do not suffer any of the typical conditions the drug is prescribed for.

In a 2013 comparison of fifteen antipsychotics in schizophrenia, chlorpromazine demonstrated mild-standard effectiveness. It was 13% more effective than lurasidone and iloperidone, approximately as effective as ziprasidone and asenapine, and 12–16% less effective than haloperidol, quetiapine, and aripiprazole.

A 2014 systematic review carried out by Cochrane included 55 trials that compared the effectiveness of chlorpromazine versus placebo for the treatment of schizophrenia. Compared to the placebo group, patients under chlorpromazine experienced less relapse during 6 months to 2 years follow-up. No difference was found between the two groups beyond two years of follow-up. Patients under chlorpromazine showed a global improvement in symptoms and functioning. The systematic review also highlighted the fact that the side effects of the drug were &#x27;severe and debilitating&#x27;, including sedation, considerable weight gain, a lowering of blood pressure, and an increased risk of acute movement disorders. They also noted that the quality of evidence of the 55 included trials was very low and that 315 trials could not be included in the systematic review due to their poor quality. They called for further research on the subject, as chlorpromazine is a cheap benchmark drug and one of the most used treatments for schizophrenia worldwide.

Chlorpromazine has also been used in porphyria and as part of tetanus treatment. It is still recommended for short-term management of severe anxiety and psychotic aggression. Resistant and severe hiccups, severe nausea/emesis, and preanesthetic conditioning are other uses. Symptoms of delirium in hospitalized AIDS patients have been effectively treated with low doses of chlorpromazine.

===Other uses===
Chlorpromazine is occasionally used off-label for treatment of severe migraine. It is often, particularly as palliation, used in small doses to reduce nausea by opioid-treated cancer patients and to intensify and prolong the analgesia of the opioids as well. Efficacy has been shown in treatment of symptomatic hypertensive emergency.

In Germany, chlorpromazine still carries label indications for insomnia, severe pruritus, and preanesthesia.

Chlorpromazine has been used as a hallucinogen antidote or &quot;trip killer&quot; to block the effects of serotonergic psychedelics like psilocybin, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), and mescaline. However, the results of clinical studies of chlorpromazine for this use have been inconsistent, with reduced effects, no change in effects, and even enhanced effects all reported.

Chlorpromazine and other phenothiazines have been demonstrated to possess antimicrobial properties, but are not currently used for this purpose except for a very small number of cases. For example, Miki &quot;et al.&quot; 1992 trialed daily doses of chlorpromazine, reversing chloroquine resistance in &quot;Plasmodium chabaudi&quot; isolates in mice. Weeks &quot;et al.&quot;, 2018 find that it also possesses a wide spectrum anthelmintic effect.

Chlorpromazine is an antagonist of several insect monoamine receptors. It is the most active antagonist known of silk moth (&quot;Bombyx mori&quot;) octopamine receptor α, intermediate for &quot;Bm&quot; tyramine receptors 1 &amp; 2, weak for &quot;Drosophila&quot; octopamine receptor β, high for &quot;Drosophila&quot; tyramine receptor 1, intermediate for migratory locust (&quot;Locusta migratoria&quot;) tyramine receptor 1, and high for American cockroach (&quot;Periplaneta americana&quot;) octopamine receptor α and tyramine receptor 1.

==Adverse effects==
There appears to be a dose-dependent risk for seizures with chlorpromazine treatment. Tardive dyskinesia (involuntary, repetitive body movements) and akathisia (a feeling of inner restlessness and inability to stay still) are less commonly seen with chlorpromazine than they are with high potency typical antipsychotics such as haloperidol or trifluoperazine, and some evidence suggests that, with conservative dosing, the incidence of such effects for chlorpromazine may be comparable to that of newer agents such as risperidone or olanzapine.

Chlorpromazine stably and for life alters natural processes in the biological systems of the mitochondria of the nervous system, and inhibits the efficiency of the electron transport chain.

Chlorpromazine may deposit in ocular tissues when taken in high dosages for long periods of time.

===Contraindications===

Absolute contraindications include:

* Circulatory depression
* CNS depression
* Coma
* Drug intoxication
* Bone marrow suppression
* Phaeochromocytoma
* Hepatic failure
* Active liver disease

* Previous hypersensitivity (including jaundice, agranulocytosis, etc.) to phenothiazines, especially chlorpromazine, or any of the excipients in the formulation being used.

Relative contraindications include:

* Epilepsy
* Parkinson&#x27;s disease
* Myasthenia gravis
* Hypoparathyroidism
* Prostatic hypertrophy
Very rarely, elongation of the QT interval, due to hERG blockade, may occur, increasing the risk of potentially fatal arrhythmias.

===Interactions===

Consuming food prior to taking chlorpromazine orally limits its absorption; likewise, cotreatment with benztropine can also reduce chlorpromazine absorption. Alcohol can also reduce chlorpromazine absorption. Antacids slow chlorpromazine absorption. Lithium and chronic treatment with barbiturates can increase chlorpromazine clearance significantly. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) can decrease chlorpromazine clearance and hence increase chlorpromazine exposure. Cotreatment with CYP1A2 inhibitors like ciprofloxacin, fluvoxamine or vemurafenib can reduce chlorpromazine clearance and hence increase exposure and potentially also adverse effects. Chlorpromazine can also potentiate the CNS depressant effects of drugs like barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opioids, lithium and anesthetics and hence increase the potential for adverse effects such as respiratory depression and sedation.

Chlorprozamine is also a moderate inhibitor of CYP2D6 and a substrate for CYP2D6 and hence can inhibit its own metabolism. It can also inhibit the clearance of CYP2D6 substrates such as dextromethorphan, potentiating their effects. Other drugs like codeine and tamoxifen, which require CYP2D6-mediated activation into their respective active metabolites, may have their therapeutic effects attenuated. Likewise, CYP2D6 inhibitors such as paroxetine or fluoxetine can reduce chlorpromazine clearance, increasing serum levels of chlorpromazine and potentially its adverse effects. Chlorpromazine also reduces phenytoin levels and increases valproic acid levels. It also reduces propranolol clearance and antagonizes the therapeutic effects of antidiabetic agents, levodopa (a Parkinson&#x27;s medication. This is likely because chlorpromazine antagonizes the D2 receptor which is one of the receptors dopamine, a levodopa metabolite, activates), amphetamines and anticoagulants. It may also interact with anticholinergic drugs such as orphenadrine to produce hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar).

Chlorpromazine may also interact with epinephrine (adrenaline) to produce a paradoxical fall in blood pressure. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and thiazide diuretics may also accentuate the orthostatic hypotension experienced by those receiving chlorpromazine treatment. Quinidine may interact with chlorpromazine to increase myocardial depression. Likewise, it may also antagonize the effects of clonidine and guanethidine. It also may reduce the seizure threshold and hence a corresponding titration of anticonvulsant treatments should be considered. Prochlorperazine and desferrioxamine may also interact with chlorpromazine to produce transient metabolic encephalopathy.

Other drugs that prolong the QT interval, such as quinidine, verapamil, amiodarone, sotalol and methadone, may also interact with chlorpromazine to produce additive QT interval prolongation.

===Discontinuation===
The British National Formulary recommends a gradual withdrawal when discontinuing antipsychotics to avoid acute withdrawal syndrome or rapid relapse. Symptoms of withdrawal commonly include nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. Other symptoms may include restlessness, increased sweating, and trouble sleeping. Less commonly, there may be a feeling of the world spinning, numbness, or muscle pains. Symptoms generally resolve after a short period of time.

There is tentative evidence that discontinuation of antipsychotics can result in psychosis. It may also result in reoccurrence of the condition that is being treated. Rarely, tardive dyskinesia can occur when the medication is stopped.

==Pharmacology==
Chlorpromazine is classified as a low-potency typical antipsychotic. Low-potency antipsychotics have more anticholinergic side effects, such as dry mouth, sedation, and constipation, and lower rates of extrapyramidal side effects, while high-potency antipsychotics (such as haloperidol) have the reverse profile.

===Pharmacodynamics===
Chlorpromazine is a very effective antagonist of D2 dopamine receptors and similar receptors, such as D3 and D5. Unlike most other drugs of this genre, it also has a high affinity for D1 receptors. Blocking these receptors causes diminished neurotransmitter binding in the forebrain, resulting in many different effects. Dopamine, unable to bind with a receptor, causes a feedback loop that causes dopaminergic neurons to release more dopamine. Therefore, upon first taking the drug, patients will experience an increase in dopaminergic neural activity. Eventually, dopamine production in the neurons will drop substantially and dopamine will be removed from the synaptic cleft. At this point, neural activity decreases greatly; the continual blockade of receptors only compounds this effect.

Chlorpromazine acts as an antagonist (blocking agent) on different postsynaptic and presynaptic receptors:

*Dopamine receptors (subtypes D1, D2, D3 and D4), which account for its different antipsychotic properties on productive and unproductive symptoms, in the mesolimbic dopamine system accounts for the antipsychotic effect whereas the blockade in the nigrostriatal system produces the extrapyramidal effects
*Serotonin receptors (5-HT2, 5-HT6 and 5-HT7), with anxiolytic, antidepressant and antiaggressive properties as well as an attenuation of extrapyramidal side effects, but also leading to weight gain and ejaculation difficulties.
*Histamine receptors (H1 receptors, accounting for sedation, antiemetic effect, vertigo, and weight gain)
*α1- and α2-adrenergic receptors (accounting for sympatholytic properties, lowering of blood pressure, reflex tachycardia, vertigo, sedation, hypersalivation and incontinence as well as sexual dysfunction, but may also attenuate pseudoparkinsonism – controversial. Also associated with weight gain as a result of blockage of the adrenergic alpha 1 receptor as well as with intraoperative floppy iris syndrome due to its effect on the iris dilator muscle.
*M1 and M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (causing anticholinergic symptoms such as dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, difficulty or inability to urinate, sinus tachycardia, electrocardiographic changes and loss of memory, but the anticholinergic action may attenuate extrapyramidal side effects).

The presumed effectiveness of the antipsychotic drugs relied on their ability to block dopamine receptors. This assumption arose from the dopamine hypothesis that maintains that both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are a result of excessive dopamine activity. Furthermore, psychomotor stimulants like cocaine that increase dopamine levels can cause psychotic symptoms if taken in excess.

Chlorpromazine and other typical antipsychotics are primarily blockers of D2 receptors. An almost perfect correlation exists between the therapeutic dose of a typical antipsychotic and the drug&#x27;s affinity for the D2 receptor. Therefore, a larger dose is required if the drug&#x27;s affinity for the D2 receptor is relatively weak. A correlation exists between average clinical potency and affinity of the antipsychotics for dopamine receptors.
Chlorpromazine tends to have a greater effect at serotonin receptors than at D2 receptors, which is notably the opposite effect of the other typical antipsychotics. Therefore, chlorpromazine&#x27;s effects on dopamine and serotonin receptors are more similar to the atypical antipsychotics than to the typical antipsychotics.

Chlorpromazine and other antipsychotics with sedative properties such as promazine and thioridazine are among the most potent agents at α-adrenergic receptors. Furthermore, they are also among the most potent antipsychotics at histamine H1 receptors. This finding is in agreement with the pharmaceutical development of chlorpromazine and other antipsychotics as anti-histamine agents. Furthermore, the brain has a higher density of histamine H1 receptors than any body organ examined which may account for why chlorpromazine and other phenothiazine antipsychotics are as potent at these sites as the most potent classical antihistamines.

In addition to influencing the neurotransmitters dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and acetylcholine it has been reported that antipsychotic drugs could achieve glutamatergic effects. This mechanism involves the direct effects of antipsychotic drugs on glutamate receptors. By using the technique of functional neurochemical assay chlorpromazine and phenothiazine derivatives have been shown to have inhibitory effects on NMDA receptors that appeared to be mediated by action at the Zn site. It was found that there is an increase of NMDA activity at low concentrations and suppression at high concentrations of the drug. No significant difference in glycine activity from the effects of chlorpromazine was reported. Further work will be necessary to determine if the influence in NMDA receptors by antipsychotic drugs contributes to their effectiveness.

Chlorpromazine does also act as a FIASMA (functional inhibitor of acid sphingomyelinase).

===Peripheral effects===
Chlorpromazine is an antagonist to H1 receptors (provoking antiallergic effects), H2 receptors (reduction of forming of gastric juice), M1 and M2 receptors (dry mouth, reduction in forming of gastric juice) and some 5-HT receptors (different anti-allergic/gastrointestinal actions).

Because it acts on so many receptors, chlorpromazine is often referred to as a &quot;dirty drug&quot;.

===Pharmacokinetics===

==History==
In 1933, the French pharmaceutical company Laboratoires Rhône-Poulenc began to search for new antihistamines. In 1947, it synthesized promethazine, a phenothiazine derivative, which was found to have more pronounced sedative and antihistaminic effects than earlier drugs. A year later, the French surgeon Pierre Huguenard used promethazine together with pethidine as part of a cocktail to induce relaxation and indifference in surgical patients. Another surgeon, Henri Laborit, believed the compound stabilized the central nervous system by causing &quot;artificial hibernation&quot; and described this state as &quot;sedation without narcosis&quot;. He suggested to Rhône-Poulenc that they develop a compound with better-stabilizing properties. In December 1950, the chemist Paul Charpentier produced a series of compounds that included RP4560 or chlorpromazine.

Chlorpromazine was distributed for testing to physicians between April and August 1951. Laborit trialled the medicine at the Val-de-Grâce military hospital in Paris, using it as an anaesthetic booster in intravenous doses of 50 to 100 mg in surgery patients and confirming it as the best drug to date in calming and reducing shock, with patients reporting improved well being afterward. He also noted its hypothermic effect and suggested it may induce artificial hibernation. Laborit thought this would allow the body to better tolerate major surgery by reducing shock, a novel idea at the time. Known colloquially as &quot;Laborit&#x27;s drug&quot;, chlorpromazine was released onto the market in 1953 by Rhône-Poulenc and given the trade name &quot;Largactil&quot;, derived from &quot;large&quot; &quot;broad&quot; and &quot;acti*&quot; &quot;activity&quot;.

Following on, Laborit considered whether chlorpromazine may have a role in managing patients with severe burns, Raynaud&#x27;s phenomenon, or psychiatric disorders. At the Villejuif Mental Hospital in November 1951, he and Montassut administered an intravenous dose to psychiatrist Cornelia Quarti, who was acting as a volunteer. Quarti noted the indifference but fainted upon getting up to go to the toilet, and so further testing was discontinued. (Orthostatic hypotension is a known side effect of chlorpromazine). Despite this, Laborit continued to push for testing in psychiatric patients during early 1952. Psychiatrists were reluctant initially, but on 19 January 1952, it was administered (alongside pethidine, pentothal and ECT) to Jacques Lh., a 24-year-old manic patient, who responded dramatically; he was discharged after three weeks, having received 855 mg of the drug in total.

Pierre Deniker had heard about Laborit&#x27;s work from his brother-in-law, who was a surgeon, and ordered chlorpromazine for a clinical trial at the Sainte-Anne Hospital Center in Paris where he was chief of the men&#x27;s service. Together with the hospital director Jean Delay, they published their first clinical trial in 1952, in which they treated thirty-eight psychotic patients with daily injections of chlorpromazine without the use of other sedating agents. The response was dramatic; treatment with chlorpromazine went beyond simple sedation, with patients showing improvements in thinking and emotional behaviour. They also found that doses higher than those used by Laborit were required, giving patients 75–100 mg daily.

Deniker then visited America, where the publication of their work alerted the American psychiatric community that the new treatment might represent a real breakthrough. Heinz Lehmann of the Verdun Protestant Hospital in Montreal trialled it in seventy patients and also noted its striking effects, with patients&#x27; symptoms resolving after many years of unrelenting psychosis. By 1954, chlorpromazine was being used in the United States to treat schizophrenia, mania, psychomotor excitement, and other psychotic disorders.
Rhône-Poulenc licensed chlorpromazine to Smith Kline &amp; French (today&#x27;s GlaxoSmithKline) in 1953. In 1955 it was approved in the United States for the treatment of emesis (vomiting). The effect of this drug in emptying psychiatric hospitals has been compared to that of penicillin on infectious diseases. 

The popularity of the drug fell in the late 1960s as newer drugs came on the scene. From chlorpromazine several other similar antipsychotics were developed, leading to the discovery of antidepressants.

Chlorpromazine largely replaced electroconvulsive therapy, hydrotherapy, psychosurgery, and insulin shock therapy. By 1964, about fifty million people worldwide had taken it. Chlorpromazine, in widespread use for fifty years, remains a &quot;benchmark&quot; drug in the treatment of schizophrenia, an effective drug although not a perfect one.

== Society and culture ==
=== In literature ===
Thorazine was often depicted in Tom Wolfe&#x27;s The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test to abort bad trips on LSD. Thorazine is also mentioned in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, where it was reported to negate the effects of LSD.

=== In Film ===
Thorazine is mentioned several times in the “Halloween” movie franchise. 

In the original Halloween (1978) Dr. Samuel Loomis (Played by Donald Pleasance) mentions the drug when speaking with his nurse about sedating Michael Myers before transporting him to court.

In the 1982 sequel Halloween 3: Season of the Witch, Dr. Don Challis (Played by Tom Atkins) orders an administration of Thorazine to a patient who suffered a traumatic incident. “Nurse, Hundred Milligrams, Thorazine.”

=== Names ===
Brand names include Thorazine, Largactil, Hibernal, and Megaphen (sold by Bayer in West-Germany since July 1953).

==Research==
Chlorpromazine has tentative benefit in animals infected with &quot;Naegleria fowleri&quot; and shows antifungal and antibacterial activity in vitro.

==Veterinary use==
The veterinary use of chlorpromazine has generally been superseded by the use of acepromazine.

Chlorpromazine may be used as an antiemetic in dogs and cats, or, less often, as a sedative before anesthesia. In horses, it often causes ataxia and lethargy and is therefore seldom used.

It is commonly used to decrease nausea in animals that are too young for other common antiemetics. It is sometimes used as a preanesthetic and muscle relaxant in cattle, swine, sheep, and goats.

The use of chlorpromazine in food-producing animals is not permitted in the European Union, as a maximum residue limit could not be determined following assessment by the European Medicines Agency.

<text>Bobby Barisford Brown Sr. (born February 5, 1969) is an American singer, songwriter, rapper, and dancer. Alongside frequent collaborator Teddy Riley, he is recognized as a pioneer of new jack swing: a fusion of hip hop and R&amp;B. Brown rose to fame as a founding member of the R&amp;B/pop vocal group New Edition, contributing to hits like &quot;Candy Girl&quot;, &quot;Cool It Now&quot;, and &quot;Mr. Telephone Man&quot;. He left the group in 1985 to pursue a solo career but later reunited with them for their &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 number-one album &quot;Home Again&quot; (1996).

Brown&#x27;s debut album, &quot;King of Stage&quot; (1985), featured the number-one R&amp;B single &quot;Girlfriend&quot;. However, it was his second album, &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Cruel&quot; (1988), that brought him commercial and critical success, producing five &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 top 10 singles, including the number-one hit &quot;My Prerogative&quot; and the Grammy Award–winning &quot;Every Little Step&quot;. In 1989, Brown contributed two songs to the &quot;Ghostbusters II&quot; soundtrack. His next album, &quot;Bobby&quot; (1992), was certified 3× Platinum by the RIAA and featured the singles &quot;Humpin&#x27; Around&quot;, &quot;Get Away&quot;, and &quot;Good Enough&quot;. Brown has also appeared in films, including &quot;A Thin Line Between Love and Hate&quot; (1996) and &quot;Two Can Play That Game&quot; (2001).

In 1992, Brown married Whitney Houston, with whom he had a daughter, Bobbi Kristina Brown. Their widely publicized relationship was marked by drug issues and domestic disputes, attracting significant media attention. Brown and Houston starred in the 2005 reality television series &quot;Being Bobby Brown&quot;. Houston filed for divorce in 2006, and it was finalized the next year.

== Early life ==
Brown was born in Boston, Massachusetts, as one of eight children. His mother Carole Elizabeth (born Williams) was a substitute teacher, and his father Herbert James Brown was a construction worker. Brown grew up in Roxbury&#x27;s Orchard Park Projects. Brown&#x27;s first taste of performing on stage occurred when he was age three, and one of his childhood idols James Brown performed in Boston. This performance sparked his dream of becoming a professional singer. Brown joined the church choir, where he recognized and developed his singing abilities. Brown&#x27;s musical influences also include singer-songwriters Rick James, Michael Jackson, Marvin Gaye, and Prince.

== Music career ==

=== New Edition ===

New Edition was founded in 1980 by 12-year-old Brown and childhood friends Michael Bivins and Ricky Bell. Ralph Tresvant joined the group at the suggestion of Bell who sang with Tresvant as a duo. Brown was also familiar with Tresvant since they were children. In 1982, they became a quintet when their manager Brooke Payne insisted on bringing in his nephew Ronnie DeVoe, to complete the group. After performing in several talent shows in the Boston area in 1979, they signed a deal with fellow Bostonian Arthur Baker&#x27;s Streetwise Records, who released their debut album &quot;Candy Girl&quot;. The title track, on which Brown sang co-lead alongside Bell and Tresvant, was a top-20 hit on Billboard&#x27;s R&amp;B Singles Chart in 1983. Brown&#x27;s first full lead vocal performance was on the New Edition ballad &quot;Jealous Girl&quot;, which was a minor hit when it also charted in 1983. The group became pop sensations with their self-titled second release. The album included the crossover hits &quot;Cool It Now&quot; and &quot;Mr. Telephone Man&quot;, which Brown also co-led.

Despite the group&#x27;s success, however, Brown felt the group was never rightfully paid the money they felt they had earned, later saying, &quot;The most I saw from all the tours and all of the records we sold was $500 and a VCR.&quot; Brown also allegedly grew jealous of the attention given to fellow New Edition member Ralph Tresvant, and during some of their tour performances would often step out of his position and perform out of turn, singing and performing seductively, which caused concern within the group&#x27;s management team. Brown was featured on two more New Edition albums before leaving the group in early 1986. Brown later said he felt that the group&#x27;s management treated them &quot;like little slaves by people who were only interested in money and power, and not in the welfare of New Edition&quot;. Some controversy arose over the way Brown was removed from the group. Some say Brown asked to be let out of New Edition, but a VH-1 &quot;Behind the Music&quot; documentary on the group claimed Brown was voted out by the group via their management team, with the members—most prominently Tresvant—against the decision.

=== Solo career ===
Following his exit from New Edition, Brown signed a contract with his former group&#x27;s label, MCA (which had earlier promised Brown a solo deal if he had decided to leave New Edition), and also signed with manager Steven Machat, who had also worked with New Edition. The label released his debut album &quot;King of Stage&quot; in 1986. Brown had a number-one R&amp;B hit with the ballad &quot;Girlfriend&quot;, but the album otherwise failed to perform well.

Brown laid low for more than a year while working on his follow-up album. With the help of Machat and MCA representative Louil Silas, Brown began working with some of the top R&amp;B producers and songwriters of the time, including Babyface, Antonio &quot;L.A.&quot; Reid and Teddy Riley. The producers helped to compose what became Brown&#x27;s most successful solo album of his career, &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Cruel&quot;. Released in 1988, the album launched five top-ten hits on the &quot;&quot;Billboard&quot;&quot; Hot 100, including the number-one single, the self-penned &quot;My Prerogative&quot;, which became, along with &quot;Every Little Step&quot; and the title track, signature hits for the performer. After topping both the pop and R&amp;B charts, album sales would eventually reach twelve million copies worldwide, making it the bestselling album of 1989. In February 1990, he won the Grammy Award for Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance for the album&#x27;s fourth single &quot;Every Little Step&quot;. &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Cruel&quot; also garnered Brown two American Music Awards, a Soul Train Music Award and a People&#x27;s Choice Award.

In 1989, Brown contributed two songs to the soundtrack of &quot;Ghostbusters II&quot;, and he also had a cameo role in the film. The first track on that album, &quot;On Our Own&quot; became another top-ten single for the singer, peaking at number two. The same year, a remix compilation, &quot;Dance!...Ya Know It!&quot;, was released, and found fans in the United Kingdom. Brown embarked on a 120-day world tour to promote &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Cruel&quot; in 1988, with Al B. Sure! opening for him, and New Edition also opening for him on some dates. The tour lasted into the spring of 1991, but not without Brown gaining notoriety for simulating sexual acts onstage, which got him into trouble with local law enforcement. In 1990, Brown performed &quot;Tap into My Heart&quot; at the 1990 MTV Awards, and was set to release the album &quot;Mystical Magic&quot;, but it was eventually shelved for reasons unknown and wasn&#x27;t released. In 1990, Brown was featured on the number-one hit &quot;She Ain&#x27;t Worth It&quot; by Glenn Medeiros, making it his second number 1 hit on the pop chart, and also collaborated with Babyface for the remix of the latter&#x27;s single &quot;Tender Lover&quot; that same year. In 1991, Brown collaborated with New Edition member Ralph Tresvant on the latter&#x27;s single &quot;Stone Cold Gentleman&quot;, which was a top-five R&amp;B hit.

Brown&#x27;s next album &quot;Bobby&quot; was released in 1992. Despite its release during the final days of the New Jack Swing era it was a success, selling more than 3 million copies, and spawning several hit singles including &quot;Humpin&#x27; Around&quot;, &quot;Get Away&quot;, and &quot;Good Enough&quot;. He received his second Grammy Award for Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance nomination for &quot;Humpin&#x27; Around&quot;. He received his third American Music Award in January 1993. However, sales of &quot;Bobby&quot; did not match its predecessor. Whitney Houston and Brown had recorded a song together, &quot;Something in Common&quot;, which was released as a single from the &quot;Bobby&quot; album.

In 1994, dance producers K-Klass remixed &quot;Two Can Play That Game&quot; from the Bobby album, it would become Brown&#x27;s biggest single in the UK peaking at No.3 in 1995.

Four years later, he would release his fourth solo album &quot;Forever&quot;, in 1997. The album&#x27;s only single, &quot;Feeling Inside&quot;, was not successful.

Prior to the release of &quot;Forever&quot;, Brown had been in negotiations with rapper Tupac Shakur to sign with Shakur&#x27;s new label Makaveli Records, or with the proposed label Death Row East. However, Shakur died before that could take place. Leaving MCA following &quot;Forever&quot;, Brown laid low for several years, appearing as a featured artist in 2001 on two tracks from &quot;The Benzino Project&quot;, and in 2002 he was featured in a duet with rapper Ja Rule on the song &quot;Thug Lovin&#x27;&quot;. Brown was signed to Murder Inc. Records, but that label had already begun to dissolve, so Brown&#x27;s tenure with them was brief. In 2006, Brown appeared adding vocals to Damian Marley&#x27;s song &quot;Beautiful&quot; on Marley&#x27;s album, &quot;Welcome to Jamrock&quot;.

In 2008, Brown planned to release a book titled &quot;Bobby Brown: The Truth, the Whole Truth and Nothing But&quot;, written by author Derrick Handspike. When controversial comments that Brown made about his ex-wife, Whitney Houston, were leaked to the media, he backed out of the project. Handspike released the book after Houston&#x27;s death in 2012.

In 2010, Brown was featured in a duet with singer Macy Gray on the song &quot;Real Love&quot; on Gray&#x27;s album &quot;The Sellout&quot;. About this project, Gray explained to &quot;Essence&quot;, &quot;Actually, he came to the studio, since he doesn&#x27;t live far, and knocked out his recording in two hours. We&#x27;re friends, and his one-year-old son is my godson. His fiancée is one of my best friends in the whole world. I met Bobby a long time ago, but we really got to know each other through her.&quot;

On June 5, 2012, Brown released his fifth album, &quot;The Masterpiece&quot;, which debuted at number 41 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B album chart.

On February 14, 2017, Brown performed at the Valentine&#x27;s Day Music Festival with Keith Sweat, Avant and El DeBarge.

=== New Edition reunions ===
Brown made his first reunited appearance with New Edition at the 1990 MTV Video Music Awards. Their performance later sparked the recording of Bell Biv DeVoe&#x27;s &quot;Word to the Mutha!&quot; in 1991 (on which Brown, Ralph Tresvant and later NE member Johnny Gill were included). A fully-fledged reunion occurred with the 1996 release of the album, &quot;Home Again&quot;. Brown contributed lead vocals on two hit singles, &quot;Hit Me Off&quot; and &quot;You Don&#x27;t Have to Worry&quot;. However, a subsequent 1997 tour to support the album led to problems between Brown and the other New Edition members. Brown later admitted that he was struggling with drug addiction and alcoholism during the tour.

In 2005, at the BET 25th Anniversary Special, Brown again reunited with New Edition. In 2008, Brown, Ralph Tresvant, and Johnny Gill then formed a splinter group, Heads of State, to compete with Bell Biv DeVoe. At the 2009 BET Awards, following the death of the group&#x27;s idol Michael Jackson, all six of the New Edition members again reunited to perform a medley of Jackson 5 hits in honor of Jackson. This sparked rumors of another full-fledged New Edition reunion, which was confirmed the following year.

Brown and New Edition continue to perform together, including The Culture Tour, which began in early 2022.

== Acting and television career ==
Brown made his acting debut with a cameo appearance in the 1989 film, &quot;Ghostbusters II&quot;, playing the Mayor&#x27;s doorman. The following year, he appeared in the HBO kids show, &quot;Mother Goose Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Rhyme&quot; playing all three characters of Three Blind Mice. In 1995, he made another guest appearance in the film, &quot;Panther&quot;, and had a major role in the Martin Lawrence film, &quot;A Thin Line Between Love and Hate&quot;. Brown made other guest appearances in the films &quot;Two Can Play That Game&quot;, &quot;Gang of Roses&quot;, &quot;Nora&#x27;s Hair Salon&quot; and &quot;Go for Broke&quot;.

In 2005, Brown was in negotiations with the Bravo television network for a reality series entitled &quot;Being Bobby Brown&quot;. Bravo, however, was not ready to commit to the deal unless Brown&#x27;s superstar wife Whitney Houston agreed to be part of the cast, which she did. The show then received the greenlight from Bravo and was a massive success in the ratings, with Houston proving so popular on the series that she received as much screen time as the show&#x27;s name-sake. The series showed Brown and Houston not always in their best moments. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; said that the show was &quot;undoubtedly the most disgusting and execrable series ever to ooze its way onto television&quot;. Despite the perceived train-wreck nature of the show, it continued Houston&#x27;s unbroken string of hit motion pictures and television projects, and it gave Bravo its highest ratings ever of any of its ongoing series. The show lasted one season and ended in 2006 after Houston stated she would not appear in season two and Bravo and Brown could not settle on a new deal.

In June 2007, Brown took part in the ITV television series &quot;24 Hours With...&quot;, a chat show format as celebrity and interviewer spend an intense 24 hours locked in a room together. The show&#x27;s host, Jamie Campbell, asked Brown questions about his career and private life, and infamously joked about making &quot;sexual moves&quot; towards the singer. Brown was furious and threatened to beat Campbell up live on air. Brown&#x27;s later tenures in reality shows included appearances on &quot;Real Husbands of Hollywood&quot;, &quot;Celebrity Fit Club&quot; and &quot;Gone Country&quot;.

In 2021, Brown competed in season five of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as the wild card contestant &quot;Crab&quot;. At one point after performing Rick James&#x27;s song &quot;Give It to Me Baby&quot;, Brown had to be briefly taken to his dressing room when he became overheated and short of breath in his costume. He was later eliminated on Week 7 alongside Tamera Mowry as &quot;Seashell&quot;.

In May 2022, &quot;Biography: Bobby Brown&quot; and &quot;Bobby Brown: Every Little Step&quot; began airing on A&amp;E. Brown is an executive-producer of both the documentary-style and reality television series about his life.

== Personal life ==
In 1995, Brown was with Steven Sealy when Sealy was targeted in a drive-by shooting. Sealy, Brown&#x27;s sister&#x27;s boyfriend, was killed and Brown was unharmed. The shooter, John Tibbs, took a plea agreement in 2001.

Brown&#x27;s parents, Carole and Herbert Brown, died within a year of each other. Carole died in 2011 and Herbert &quot;Pops&quot; in January 2012, a month before Bobby&#x27;s former wife Whitney Houston&#x27;s death.

=== Marriages ===
Brown first met Whitney Houston at the Soul Train Music Awards in 1989 when he was 20. They began a close friendship after Houston invited Brown to her 26th birthday party that August. Their friendship developed into a romance. In 1991, Brown proposed to Houston and the couple married at Houston&#x27;s estate on July 18, 1992. Their daughter Bobbi Kristina Brown was born in 1993. Houston and Brown later collaborated on the hit single &quot;Something in Common&quot;, which included their daughter at the end of the music video.

Throughout their marriage, there were rumors of infidelity on Brown&#x27;s part, alcohol and drug abuse, and domestic violence. Their personal issues became fodder for talk shows and sketch comedy shows. Some sketch comedy shows portrayed Brown as a has-been who was jealous of his wife&#x27;s celebrity status. In 2003, Brown was charged with battery after an altercation with Houston.

In 2005, the couple participated in the reality show &quot;Being Bobby Brown&quot;, which gave a picture of their lives behind the scenes. In September 2006, Houston filed for legal separation and later divorce. Their divorce was finalized on April 24, 2007, with Houston receiving custody of their 14-year-old daughter. In a September 2009 interview with Oprah Winfrey, Houston admitted to sometimes using drugs with Brown, stating that Brown had &quot;laced marijuana with cocaine&quot;. Houston also told Winfrey that Brown had been abusive during their marriage and even spat on her on one occasion while drunk.

Following the death of Houston on February 11, 2012, six days after his 43rd birthday, Brown struggled to perform at a New Edition show, shouting &quot;I love you, Whitney&quot; in tears. Brown then excused himself from the stage and New Edition finished the remainder of the show. Brown appeared at Houston&#x27;s memorial service in New Jersey but was asked to leave by the family&#x27;s security. In an interview given to &quot;The Today Show&quot; in May 2012, Brown said security was the reason he and his family left the service; Brown stated that he loved Houston&#x27;s family and told Matt Lauer that he had spent &quot;14 beautiful years&quot; with Houston as his wife. Along with Clive Davis, Ray J, and others, Brown has been accused of contributing to the singer&#x27;s death, which he denies.

In 2009, Brown had a son named Cassius with his partner of two years, manager Alicia Etheredge. Brown and Etheredge became engaged in May 2010, when Brown proposed during a performance at the Funk Fest in Jacksonville, Florida. The couple married on June 18, 2012, in Hawaii and have since had two daughters.

=== Children ===
Brown has fathered seven children. His eldest, Landon, was born on June 22, 1986, to Melika Williams. He has two children with Kim Ward, whom he met around 1980; daughter La&#x27;Princia (b. 1989) and son Bobby Brown Jr. (1991–2020). His and Ward&#x27;s on-and-off 11-year relationship ended in 1991. At three months pregnant, Ward found out Brown was engaged to Whitney Houston. Houston suffered miscarriages in 1992, 1994, and 1996. His only child with Houston was Bobbi Kristina Brown (1993–2015). Brown has three children with Alicia Etheredge: a son born in 2009, and daughters born in 2015 and 2016.

In January 2015, Brown&#x27;s daughter Bobbi Kristina was found unconscious in her bathtub at her residence in Roswell, Georgia. The 21-year-old was rushed to North Fulton Hospital where she was placed on a ventilator in a medically induced coma to stop the swelling of her brain. It was reported her brain activity was &quot;low&quot;. Brown rushed to his daughter&#x27;s side and released a statement to the press requesting them to respect the family&#x27;s privacy. She was later transferred to Emory University Hospital. After doctors concluded significant brain function was unlikely to occur, Bobbi Kristina was removed from the ventilator and put in the care of Hospice in Duluth, Georgia. She died there on July 26, 2015, at age 22.

On November 18, 2020, Brown&#x27;s son Bobby Jr., age 28, was found dead in his home. His death was ruled an accidental overdose of cocaine, fentanyl, and alcohol.

=== Health and drug use ===
As a child, Brown was diagnosed with ADD and later with bipolar disorder at age 32. Brown said that his drug of choice was marijuana and that he had developed alcoholism at an early age. Brown was doing drugs all his life before he met Whitney Houston &quot;I never used cocaine until after I met Whitney. Before then, I had experimented with other drugs, but marijuana was my drug of choice,&quot; he said. Throughout the 1990s, his drug addiction worsened and at one point he was cooking cocaine and using heroin.

According to former gang member David Collins, Brown was kidnapped by New York street gang the Preacher Crew over a $25,000 drug debt in 1993. Houston paid a $400,000 ransom to the gang who threatened to kill Brown. The incident was never reported to authorities.

=== Arrests ===
Since 1989, Brown has been arrested multiple times for various offenses:
* In September 1990, Brown was charged with disorderly conduct for refusing to leave a restaurant after his brother Tommy was arrested.
* In April 1995, Brown and two friends were charged in the beating of a nightclub patron in Orlando. Police reported that, after his arrest, Brown urinated in a police patrol car and scratched four-letter words in the vinyl. The charges were dropped after the victim settled a civil lawsuit against Brown.
* In August 1995, Brown was cited for battery after police said he kicked a hotel security guard who was sent to his room to investigate noise complaints.
* In January 1998, Brown was convicted in Florida of driving under the influence and causing property damage. The charges stemmed from 1996, when Brown crashed Houston&#x27;s sports car into a condominium sign. He served five days in jail then was released on probation.
* In June 1998, Brown was arrested on suspicion of sexual battery for allegedly slapping a woman&#x27;s bottom at the Beverly Hills Hotel. The case was dropped due to insufficient evidence.
* From May to June 2000, Brown spent 26 days in jail after he was arrested by U.S. Customs agents in New Jersey following a trip from the Bahamas. The arrest stemmed from an outstanding warrant for violating probation in his 1996 drunken driving conviction. The warrant had been issued in June 1999, after Brown&#x27;s probation officer reported that cocaine had been found in his urine test twice.
* In November 2002, Brown was arrested on drug and traffic charges, and later discovered he was wanted on the 1996 warrant.
* In January 2003, Brown served an eight-day sentence in the DeKalb County, Georgia, jail after he pleaded guilty to a 1996 drunken driving charge and a count of speeding.
* In August 2003, Brown was sentenced to 14 days in jail for probation violations stemming from a 1996 drunken driving charge. His sentence was followed by 60 days of house arrest.
* In December 2003, Brown was charged with battery for striking his wife, Whitney Houston, and threatening to beat her.&quot; Police reported that Houston had visible injuries to her face.
* In March 2004, Brown was sentenced to 90 days in jail for owing $63,000 in back child support to Kim Ward. After one night in jail, he was released when Houston paid off the debt.
* In June 2004, Brown received a suspended 90-day prison sentence for missing three consecutive child support payments. The sentence was suspended after six days when Brown made the back payments.
* In February 2007, Brown was sentenced to 30 days in jail for unpaid child support in the amount of $20,000 to Kim Ward. He was released after three days when a radio station paid his fees.
* In April 2012, Brown was arrested for drunken driving. He spent time in a &quot;confidential rehabilitation center&quot; as part of his plea deal.
* In October 2012, Brown was arrested for drunken driving. He was ordered to attend at least three Alcoholics Anonymous sessions each week until he reported to the Los Angeles County jail. In February 2013, Brown was sentenced to 55 days in jail and four years of summary probation following his second drunken driving conviction in a year. He was released after serving nine hours and put on electronic monitoring by Los Angeles County Probation.

== In popular culture ==
Brown popularized the Roger Rabbit dance (aka the &quot;backwards&quot; running man), as performed in the music video for his song &quot;Every Little Step&quot; (1989), along with the Gumby-style hi-top fade. Brown has claimed that he taught Michael Jackson how to do the moonwalk.

Brown was spoofed by Aries Spears on &quot;MADtv&quot;, with Whitney Houston portrayed by Debra Wilson. He was also spoofed by Tracy Morgan and Finesse Mitchell on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. Brown was portrayed by Arlen Escarpeta in the television film &quot;Whitney&quot;, by Woody McClain in the 2017 miniseries &quot;The New Edition Story&quot; and in the 2018 miniseries about his life, &quot;The Bobby Brown Story&quot;. Brown is also portrayed by Ashton Sanders in the Whitney Houston biopic, &quot;Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody&quot;, that was released Christmas 2022.

In 2022, Brown also claimed he started wearing the &quot;diaper pants&quot; that MC Hammer altered and made famous, on his A&amp;E show &quot;Bobby Brown: Every Little Step&quot;. However, Brown wore a less sagging variation during some concerts and in music videos, such as &quot;My Prerogative&quot; (1988) and &quot;Every Little Step&quot; (1989).

<text>Lānaʻi (, , ,) is the sixth-largest of the Hawaiian Islands and the smallest publicly accessible inhabited island in the chain. It is colloquially known as the Pineapple Island because of its past as an island-wide pineapple plantation. The island&#x27;s only settlement of note is the small town of Lanai City. The island is 98% owned by Larry Ellison, cofounder and chairman of Oracle Corporation;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTM 2014/09/28&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; the remaining 2% is owned by the state of Hawaii or individual homeowners.

Lanai has a land area of , making it the 43rd largest island in the United States. It is separated from the island of Molokaʻi by the Kalohi Channel to the north, and from Maui by the Auʻau Channel to the east. The United States Census Bureau defines Lanai as Census Tract 316 of Maui County. Its total population rose to 3,367 as of the 2020 United States census, up from 3,193 as of the 2000 census and 3,131 as of the 2010 census. As visible via satellite imagery, many of the island&#x27;s landmarks are accessible only by dirt roads that require a four-wheel drive vehicle.

There is one school, Lanai High and Elementary School, serving the entire island from kindergarten through 12th grade. There is also one hospital, Lanai Community Hospital, with 24 beds, and a community health center providing primary care, dental, behavioral health and selected specialty services in Lanai City. There are no traffic lights on the island.

==History==
Lanai has been under the control of nearby Maui since before recorded history. Its first inhabitants may have arrived as late as the 15th century.

The Hawaiian-language name is of uncertain origin, but the island has historically been called , which can be rendered in English as &quot;day of the conquest of Kauluāʻau&quot;. This epithet refers to a legend about a Mauian prince who was banished to Lanai because of his wild pranks at his father&#x27;s court in Lāhainā. The island was said to be haunted by Akua-ino, ghosts and goblins that Kauluāʻau chased away, bringing peace and order to the island and regaining his father&#x27;s favor as a consequence.

The first people to migrate here, most likely from Maui and Molokaʻi, probably established fishing villages along the coast at first, and then spread into the interior, where they raised taro in the fertile volcanic soil. During most of this period, the Mōʻī of Maui had control over Lanai, but generally left its inhabitants alone. However, at some point, King Kamehameha I or Kalaniʻōpuʻu-a-Kaiamamao invaded and killed many of them. The population must have been mostly eradicated by 1792, because in that year Captain George Vancouver reported that he had ignored the island during his voyage because of its apparent lack of inhabitants or villages. Lanai is said to have been Kamehameha&#x27;s favorite fishing spot among Hawaii&#x27;s main eight islands.

The history of sugar cultivation in Hawaii begins in Lanai, when in 1802 a farmer from China, Wong Tse Chun, produced a small amount there. He used a crude stone mill that he had brought with him to crush the cane.

In 1854 a group of members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints were granted a lease in the ahupuaʻa of Pālāwai. In 1862 Walter M. Gibson arrived on Lanai to reorganize the settlement. A year later he bought the ahupuaʻa of Pālāwai for $3000; he used money of the church but titled the land in his own name. When the members of the Church found this out they excommunicated him, but he was still able to retain ownership of the land. By the 1870s, Gibson, then the leader of the colony on the island, had acquired most of the island&#x27;s land, which he used for ranching.

By 1890, the population of Lanai had been reduced to 200. In 1899, Gibson&#x27;s daughter and son-in-law formed Maunalei Sugar Company, headquartered in Keomuku, on the windward (northeast) coast, downstream from Maunalei Valley. The company failed in 1901. However, between 1899 and 1901 nearly 800 laborers, mostly from Japan, had been contracted to work for the plantations. Many Native Hawaiians continued to live along the less arid windward coast, supporting themselves by ranching and fishing.

By 1907, approximately half of the island was owned by cattle rancher Charles Gay. Backed by sugar planter William G. Irwin, Gay worked to acquire the remaining land. While the Hawaiian Organic Act would have made it illegal for the territorial government to sell such a large portion of land to Gay, a land exchange deal circumvented that law. Gay transferred several acres of land of what is now downtown Honolulu in exchange for the rest of the land on Lanai. The transfer was completed on April 10, 1907 and Gay mortgaged the land the very same day to Irwin for $200,000. By 1909, Gay had defaulted on the mortgage and officially conveyed the land to Irwin for a rebuttable presumption of consideration of $1. From this conveyance comes the common myth that the land was bought for a mere $1, when the true cost of the land included the $200,000 mortgage.

In 1921, Charles Gay planted the first pineapple plant on Lanai. The population had decreased again - to 150 - most of whom were the descendants of the traditional families of the island. A year later, James Dole, the president of Hawaiian Pineapple Company (later renamed Dole Food Company), bought the island and developed a large portion of it into the world&#x27;s largest pineapple plantation.

Upon Hawaii statehood in 1959, Lanai became part of the Maui County.

In 1985, Lanai passed into the control of David H. Murdock as a result of his purchase of Castle &amp; Cooke, which was then the owner of Dole. High labor and land costs led to a decline in Hawaii pineapple production in the 1980s, and Dole phased out its pineapple operations on Lanai in 1992.

In June 2012, Larry Ellison, then CEO of Oracle Corporation, purchased Castle &amp; Cooke&#x27;s 98 percent share of the island for $300 million. The state and individual homeowners own the remaining 2 percent, which includes the harbor and the private homes where the 3,000 inhabitants live. Ellison stated his intention to invest as much as $500 million to improve the island&#x27;s infrastructure and create an environmentally friendly agricultural industry. Ellison had spent an estimated $450 million to remodel his Four Seasons Resort Lanai, which reopened in April 2016. He would also remodel his other resort in 2020 and has explained plans for further green energy projects by buying out diesel-powered utility assets, though he has since ended this plan.

==Legends==
According to Hawaiian legends, man-eating spirits have occupied the island. For generations, Maui chiefs believed in these man-eating spirits. Differing legends say that either the prophet Lanikāula drove the spirits from the island or the unruly Maui prince Kauluāʻau accomplished that heroic feat. The more popular myth is that the mischievous Kauluāʻau pulled up every breadfruit tree (&quot;ʻulu&quot;) he could find on Maui. Finally his father, Kakaʻalaneo had to banish him to Lanai, expecting him not to survive in that hostile place. However, Kauluāʻau outwitted the spirits and drove them from the island. The chief looked across the channel from Maui and saw that his son&#x27;s fire continued to burn nightly on the shore, and he sent a canoe to Lanai to bring the prince back, redeemed by his courage and cleverness. As a reward, Kakaʻalaneo gave Kauluāʻau control of the island and encouraged emigration from other islands. Kauluāʻau had, in the meantime, pulled up all the breadfruit trees on Lanai, accounting for the historic lack of them on that island.

==Geography==
The highest point in Lanai is Mount Lānaʻihale. It is an inactive volcano near the center of the island and to the east of Lanai City. The elevation of Mount Lānaʻihale is .

Lanai was traditionally administered in 13 political subdivisions (Ahupuaʻa), grouped into two districts (&quot;mokuoloko&quot;): &quot;kona&quot; (Leeward) and &quot;koʻolau&quot; (Windward). The &quot;ahupuaʻa&quot; are listed below, in clockwise sequence, and with original area figures in acres, starting in the northwest of the island.


Kamoku hosts the largest share of population, because the bigger part of Lanai City falls into it. Parts of Lanai City stretch to Kaa and Paomai. , the remaining &quot;ahupuaʻa&quot; were virtually uninhabited. According to the census of 2020, Lanai City accounts for 99 percent of the island population (3332 of 3367). As a census-designated place, Lanai City is defined solely for statistical purposes, and not by administrative boundaries.

A volcanic collapse in Lanai 100,000 years ago generated a megatsunami that inundated land at elevations higher than .

==Tourism==

Tourism on Lanai began to be prominent in more recent history as the pineapple and sugarcane industries were phased out in the islands. The number of visitors coming to the island is still relatively small, however, with around 59,000 arrivals forecast for 2016. Of all the publicly accessible Hawaiian islands, only Molokaʻi attracts fewer visitors.

, the two resort hotels on Lanai were managed by Four Seasons Hotels; the Four Seasons Resort Lanai in Manele Bay at Hulupoe Beach. The Hotel Lanai in Lanai City was built in 1923 by James Dole of the Hawaiian Pineapple Company as a lodge to house the executives overseeing the island&#x27;s pineapple production. It was the island&#x27;s only hotel until 1990.
Lanai is also home to three golf courses, one at each Four Seasons resort and a third, free course.
* &quot;The Challenge at Manele&quot; borders the ocean and was designed by Jack Nicklaus. Bill Gates was married on the 12th hole tee-box at The Challenge at Manele.
* &quot;The Experience at Koele&quot; is located in the mountains of Lanai and was designed by noted Southern California golf course architect Ted Robinson Sr, with input from Greg Norman.
* &quot;The Cavendish&quot; is a public golf course designed by E.B. Cavendish in 1947. It is a nine-hole course surrounded by Norfolk pines.

&quot;Shipwreck Beach&quot; on the north shore of the island is so named because of the remains of a wrecked vessel aground a short distance offshore. This is popularly referred to as a WW II Liberty Ship, although it is YOG-42, one of several concrete barges built during the war.

== Transportation ==
In Lanai City, there are no traffic lights. Public transportation is supplied by the hotels. Most attractions outside of the hotels and town can be visited only via dirt roads that require an off-road vehicle, bicycle or walking.

Lanai is served by Lanai Airport, which offers air taxi and scheduled commercial operations to other Hawaiian islands.

==Notable people==
* Danny Lockin, actor, dancer, born in Lanai in 1943. Best known for his role as Barnaby Tucker in the 1969 movie &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot;, he played the same role in the Broadway play when it went on tour across the United States.

<doc id="148988" wikidata="Q42497" url="?curid=148988" title="Lower Austria">
<text>Lower Austria ( , abbreviated LA or NÖ; ; ; ) is one of the nine states of Austria, located in the northeastern corner of the country. Major cities are Amstetten, Krems an der Donau, Wiener Neustadt and Sankt Pölten, which has been the capital of Lower Austria since 1986, replacing Vienna, which became a separate state in 1921. With a land area of and a population of 1.7 million people, Lower Austria is the largest and second-most-populous state in Austria (after Vienna).

== Geography ==

With a land area of situated east of Upper Austria, Lower Austria is the country&#x27;s largest state. Lower Austria derives its name from its downriver location on the river Enns, which flows from the west to the east. Lower Austria has an international border, long, with the Czech Republic (South Bohemia and South Moravia) and Slovakia (Bratislava and Trnava Regions). The state has the second-longest external border of all Austrian states. It also borders the other Austrian states of Upper Austria, Styria and Burgenland as well as surrounding Vienna.

Lower Austria is divided into four regions, known as &quot;Viertel&quot; (quarters):
* &quot;Weinviertel&quot; or Tertiary Lowland (below the Manhartsberg)
* &quot;Waldviertel&quot; or Bohemian Plateau (above the Manhartsberg)
* &quot;Mostviertel&quot; (above the Vienna Woods)
* &quot;Industrieviertel&quot; (below the Vienna Woods).

These regions have different geographical structures. Whilst the &quot;Mostviertel&quot; is dominated by the foothills of the Limestone Alps with mountains up to (6,500 ft) high, most of the &quot;Waldviertel&quot; is a granite plateau. The hilly &quot;Weinviertel&quot; lies to the northeast, descends to the plains of Marchfeld in the east of the state, and is separated by the Danube from the Vienna Basin to the south, which in turn is separated from the Vienna Woods by a line of thermal springs (the &quot;Thermenlinie&quot;) running north to south.

=== Rivers ===


Almost all of Lower Austria is drained by the Danube. The only river that flows into the North Sea (via the Moldau and the Elbe) is the Lainsitz in northern &quot;Waldviertel&quot;.

The most important rivers north of the Danube (on its left bank) are the Ysper, Kamp, Krems, Lainsitz, March and Thaya. South of the Danube (on its right bank) are the Enns, Ybbs, Erlauf, Melk, Pielach, Traisen, Schwechat, Fischa, Schwarza, Triesting, Pitten and the Leitha.

=== Lakes ===
* Ottenstein Reservoir (4.3 km)
* Lunzer See (0.69 km)
* Erlaufsee (0.56 km, of which about half lies in Lower Austria)
* Erlauf Reservoir
* Wienerwaldsee (0.32 km)

=== Caves ===

Lower Austria is rich in natural caves; in all 4,082 have been recorded. Most of the caves have formed in limestone and dolomite rocks and are therefore called karst caves. Cavities also form in the marble of the Central Alps and the Bohemian Massif. Among the largest caves in Lower Austria are:
* Ötscherhöhlensystem (Ötscher): 27,003 m long; union of the Taubenloch and Geldloch

== History ==
 
More than 200 Neolithic people were killed during the massacre in the Linear Pottery settlement area of Schletz 7000 years ago. 

The history of Lower Austria is very similar to the history of Austria. Many castles are located in Lower Austria. Klosterneuburg Abbey, located here, is one of the oldest abbeys in Austria. Before World War II, Lower Austria had the largest number of Jews in the country.

The names &quot;Lower Austria&quot; and &quot;Upper Austria&quot; are derived from the earlier names &quot;Austria below the Enns&quot; and &quot;Austria above the Enns&quot;, references to the river Enns. Going down from its source on the northern edge of the Central Eastern Alps, the river crosses Upper Austria, then on its lower reaches forms the boundary between Upper Austria and Lower Austria.

In the mid-13th century, it became known as the Principality below the river Enns (&quot;&quot;).

The Battle on the Marchfeld on 26 August 1278 marked the beginning of the ascendancy of the House of Habsburg in Austria and Central Europe.

During the Ottoman wars in Europe, Lower Austria was the target of repeated raids by the Tatars and Ottoman &quot;Akinji&quot; mounted paramilitary units, with many people taken into slavery.

Lower Austria was the site of the Battles of Wagram and Aspern, fought between invading French troops under Napoleon and an Austrian army led by Archduke Charles in 1809. 

== Economy ==
The gross domestic product (GDP) of the state was 61.0 billion € in 2018, accounting for 15.8% of Austria&#x27;s economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 32,300 €, or 107% of the EU27 average in the same year. Lower Austria is the state with the second-lowest GDP per capita in Austria.

== Demographics ==
== Administrative divisions ==
Lower Austria is divided into four regions: &quot;Waldviertel&quot;, &quot;Mostviertel&quot;, &quot;Industrieviertel&quot;, and &quot;Weinviertel&quot;. The Wachau valley, situated between Melk and Krems in the Mostviertel region, is famous for its landscape, culture, and wine.

Administratively, the state is divided into 20 districts (&quot;Bezirke&quot;), and four independent towns (&quot;Statutarstädte&quot;). In total, there are 573 municipalities within Lower Austria.

<text>The Kinsey scale, also called the Heterosexual–Homosexual Rating Scale, is used in research to describe a person&#x27;s sexual orientation based on one&#x27;s experience or response at a given time. The scale typically ranges from 0, meaning exclusively heterosexual, to a 6, meaning exclusively homosexual. In both the male and female volumes of the &quot;Kinsey Reports&quot;, an additional grade, listed as &quot;X&quot;, indicated &quot;no socio-sexual contacts or reactions&quot; (asexuality). The reports were first published in &quot;Sexual Behavior in the Human Male&quot; (1948) by Alfred Kinsey, Wardell Pomeroy, and others, and were also prominent in the complementary work &quot;Sexual Behavior in the Human Female&quot; (1953).

==History ==
Alfred Kinsey, the creator of the Kinsey scale, is known as &quot;the father of the sexual revolution.&quot; The Kinsey scale was created in order to demonstrate that sexuality does not fit into two strict categories: homosexual and heterosexual. Instead, Kinsey believed that sexuality is fluid and subject to change over time.

Rather than using sociocultural labels, Kinsey primarily used assessments of behavior in order to rate individuals on the scale. Kinsey&#x27;s first rating scale had thirty categories that represented thirty different case studies, but his final scale has only seven categories. Over 8,000 interviews were conducted throughout his research.

Introducing the scale, Kinsey wrote:

== Table of the scale ==
The Kinsey scale ranges from 0 for those interviewed who solely had desires for or sexual experiences with the opposite sex, to 6 for those who had exclusively same sex desires or experiences, and 1–5 for those who had varying levels of desire or experiences with both sexes, including &quot;incidental&quot; or &quot;occasional&quot; desire for sexual activity with the same sex. It did not reference whether they &quot;identified&quot; as heterosexual, bisexual, or homosexual.

Kinsey recognized that the seven categories of the scale could not fully capture every individual&#x27;s sexuality. He wrote that &quot;it should be recognized that the reality includes individuals of every intermediate type, lying in a continuum between the two extremes and between each and every category on the scale.&quot; Although sociologists Martin S. Weinberg and Colin J. Williams write that, in principle, people who rank anywhere from 1 to 5 could be considered bisexual, Kinsey disliked the use of the term &quot;bisexual&quot; to describe individuals who engage in sexual activity with both males and females, preferring to use &quot;bisexual&quot; in its original, biological sense as hermaphroditic; he stated, &quot;Until it is demonstrated [that] taste in a sexual relation is dependent upon the individual containing within his anatomy both male and female structures, or male and female physiological capacities, it is unfortunate to call such individuals bisexual.&quot;

Psychologist Jim McKnight writes that while the idea that bisexuality is a form of sexual orientation intermediate between homosexuality and heterosexuality is implicit in the Kinsey scale, that conception has been &quot;severely challenged&quot; since the publication of &quot;&quot; (1978) by Weinberg and the psychologist Alan P. Bell. Furthermore, although the additional X grade used to mean &quot;no socio-sexual contacts or reactions&quot; is today described as asexuality, psychologist Justin J. Lehmiller stated, &quot;the Kinsey X classification emphasized a lack of sexual behavior, whereas the modern definition of asexuality emphasizes a lack of sexual attraction. As such, the Kinsey Scale may not be sufficient for accurate classification of asexuality.&quot;

== Findings ==
=== Kinsey reports ===
The Kinsey Reports are two published works, &quot;Sexual Behavior in the Human Male&quot; (1948) and &quot;Sexual Behavior in the Human Female&quot; (1953). These reports discuss the sexual attractions, behaviors, and development of human males and females. The data to scale the participants comes from their &quot;psychosexual responses and/or overt experience&quot; in relation to sexual attraction and activity with the same and opposite sexes. The inclusion of psychosexual responses allows someone with less sexual experience to rank evenly with someone of greater sexual experience.

* Men: 11.6% of white males aged 20–35 were given a rating of 3 for this period of their lives. The study also reported that 10% of American males surveyed were &quot;more or less exclusively homosexual for at least three years between the ages of 16 and 55&quot; (in the 5 to 6 range).
* Women: 7% of single females aged 20–35 and 4% of previously married females aged 20–35 were given a rating of 3 for this period of their lives. 2% to 6% of females, aged 20–35, were given a rating of 5 and 1% to 3% of unmarried females aged 20–35 were rated as 6.

The results found in &quot;Sexual Behavior in the Human Female&quot; show a higher number of men who lean towards homosexuality than recorded for the women. Kinsey addresses that the result is contrary to reports that women have more homosexual leanings than men. He posits that such reports are due to the &quot;wishful thinking on the part of such heterosexual males.&quot;

== Impact and later developments ==
===General===
The Kinsey scale is credited as one of the first attempts to &quot;acknowledge the diversity and fluidity of human sexual behavior&quot; by illustrating that &quot;sexuality does not fall neatly into the dichotomous categories of exclusively heterosexual or exclusively homosexual.&quot; Most studies regarding homosexuality, at the time, were conducted by medical professionals who were sought out by individuals that wanted to change their sexual orientation. Alfred Kinsey&#x27;s publications on human sexuality, which encompasses the Kinsey scale, were widely advertised and had a huge impact on society&#x27;s modern conceptions of sexuality, post–World War II.

Galupo et al. argued, &quot;Despite the availability of the Kinsey Scale, assessment via sociocultural labels (i.e., heterosexual, homosexual, and bisexual) is the predominant modality for determining the sexual orientation of research participants.&quot; Many sexologists see the Kinsey scale as relevant to sexual orientation, but not comprehensive enough to cover all sexual identity aspects. Measures of sexual orientation do not always correlate with individuals&#x27; self-identification labels. As such, sexual identity involves more than one component and may also involve biological sex and gender identity. However, Bullough et al. argued that this &quot;wide-scale public discussion of human sexuality&quot; ultimately led Americans to challenge traditional heteronormative behaviors. His research and findings encouraged gay men and lesbians to come out by debunking much of the stigma revolved around homosexuality.

Others have further defined the scale. In 1980, Michael Storms proposed a two dimensional chart with an X and Y axis. This scale explicitly takes into account the case of asexuality and the simultaneous expression of hetero-eroticism and homo-eroticism. Fritz Klein, in his Klein Sexual Orientation Grid, included factors such as how orientation can change throughout a person&#x27;s lifetime, as well as emotional and social orientation. Kinsey, Storm, and Klein are only three of more than 200 scales to measure and describe sexual orientation. For example, there are scales that rate homosexual behaviors from 1 to 14, and measures for gender, masculinity, femininity, and transgender identity.

===Surveys and other studies===
There have been similar studies using a scale from 0 to 10. In such studies, the person would be asked a question such as &quot;If 0 is completely gay and 10 is completely hetero, what is your orientation number?&quot;.

A study published in 2014 aimed to explore &quot;sexual minority individuals&#x27; qualitative responses regarding the ways in which the Kinsey Scale [...] captures (or fail to capture) their sexuality.&quot; Participants completed the [Kinsey] scale and then were asked to respond to the following question: &quot;In what ways did this scale capture or fail to capture your sexuality?&quot; &quot;A diverse sample of sexual minority participants, including individuals who (1) identify outside the traditional sexual orientation labels (i.e. pansexual, queer, fluid, asexual) and (2) identify as transgender, were recruited to complete an online questionnaire.&quot; Participants represented a convenience sample of 285 individuals who self-identified as non-heterosexual. &quot;Approximately one third of participants self-identified primarily as monosexual (31.5%), whereas 65.8% identified as nonmonosexual, and 2.8% identified as asexual. Monosexual participants represented those who self-identified as lesbian (18.5%) or gay (12.2%) or homosexual (0.8%). Nonmonosexual participants included bisexual (24.1%), pansexual (16.8%), queer (19.6%), and fluid (1.4%) participants. A small minority of participants identified as &#x27;other&#x27; (3.8%).&quot; Participants represented all regions of the continental United States. For this study, the use of &quot;X&quot; was intended to describe asexuality or individuals who identify as nonsexual.

A study published in 2017 questioned how people who do not identify as heterosexual felt about their representation on the Kinsey scale. The study takes a group of minority individuals who sexually identify as something other than heterosexual, and has them rate the Kinsey scale according to how well they feel represented by their value. Each group gave it a rating between 1 and 5. In the results, the group that rated the scale the highest was the group that identified as lesbian or gay with a rating of 4.66. The bisexual group rated it lower at 3.78, and the pansexual/queer group gave it the lowest rating at 2.68. Another trend that the study noted was that cisgender participants on average rated themselves higher on the scale than transgender participants (where the authors use &quot;transgender&quot; as a category to describe participants of various trans and non-binary identities). Namely, the cisgender participants average rating was 4.09 while the transgender participants was 2.78. The authors also found that trans and non-binary participants rated the Kinsey scale to be a less valid measure of their sexual orientation than the cisgender participants, due to its reliance on binary terminology.

<doc id="148994" wikidata="Q42880" url="?curid=148994" title="Tyrol (state)">
<text>Tyrol ( ; ; ) is an Austrian federal state. It comprises the Austrian part of the historical Princely County of Tyrol. It is a constituent part of the present-day Euroregion Tyrol–South Tyrol–Trentino (together with South Tyrol and Trentino in Italy). The capital of Tyrol is Innsbruck.

==Geography==
Tyrol is separated into two parts, divided by a strip of Salzburg State. The two constituent parts of Tyrol are the northern and larger North Tyrol () and the southeastern and smaller East Tyrol (&quot;&quot;). Salzburg State lies to the east of North Tyrol, while on the south Tyrol has a border to the Italian province of South Tyrol, which was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire before the First World War. With a land area of , Tyrol is the third-largest federal state in Austria.

North Tyrol shares its borders with the federal states Salzburg in the east and Vorarlberg in the west. In the north, it adjoins the German federal state of Bavaria; in the south, it shares borders with the Italian province of South Tyrol and the Swiss canton of Graubünden. East Tyrol shares its borders with the federal state of Carinthia to the east and Italy&#x27;s Province of Belluno (Veneto) to the south.

The federal state&#x27;s territory is located entirely within the Eastern Alps at the Brenner Pass. The highest mountain in the federal state is the Großglockner, part of the Hohe Tauern range on the border with Carinthia. It has a height of 3,797 m (12,457.35 ft), making it the highest mountain in Austria.

==History==


In ancient times, the region was split between the Roman provinces of Raetia (west of the Inn River) and Noricum. From the mid-6th century, it was resettled by Germanic Bavarii tribes. In the Early Middle Ages it formed the southern part of the German stem duchy of Bavaria, until the Counts of Tyrol, former &quot;Vogt&quot; officials of the Trent and Brixen prince-bishops at Tyrol Castle, achieved imperial immediacy after the deposition of the Bavarian duke Henry the Proud in 1138, and their possessions formed a state of the Holy Roman Empire in its own right.

When the Counts of Tyrol died out in 1253, their estates were inherited by the Meinhardiner Counts of Görz. In 1271, the Tyrolean possessions were divided between Count Meinhard II of Görz and his younger brother Albert I, who took the lands of East Tyrol around Lienz and attached them (as &quot;outer county&quot;) to his committal possessions around Gorizia (&quot;inner county&quot;).

The last Tyrolean countess of the Meinhardiner Dynasty, Margaret, bequeathed her assets to the Habsburg duke Rudolph IV of Austria in 1363. In 1420, the committal residence was relocated from Merano to Innsbruck. The Tyrolean lands were reunited when the Habsburgs inherited the estates of the extinct Counts of Görz in 1500.

In the course of the German mediatization in 1803, the prince-bishoprics of Trent and Brixen were secularized and merged into the County of Tyrol (which in the next year became a constituent land of the Austrian Empire), but Tyrol was ceded to the Kingdom of Bavaria in 1805. Andreas Hofer led the Tyrolean Rebellion against the French and Bavarian occupiers. Later, South Tyrol was ceded to the Kingdom of Italy, a client state of the First French Empire, by Bavaria in 1810. After Napoleon&#x27;s defeat, the whole of Tyrol was returned to Austria in 1814.

Tyrol was a Cisleithanian &quot;Kronland&quot; (royal territory) of Austria-Hungary from 1867. The County of Tyrol then extended beyond the boundaries of today&#x27;s federal state, including North Tyrol and East Tyrol; South Tyrol and Trentino (&quot;Welschtirol&quot;) as well as three municipalities, which today are part of the adjacent province of Belluno. After World War I, these lands became part of the Kingdom of Italy according to the 1915 London Pact and the provisions of the Treaty of Saint Germain. From November 1918, it was occupied by 20,000–22,000 soldiers of the Italian Army.

Tyrol was the center of an important resistance group against Nazi Germany around Walter Caldonazzi, which united with the group around the priest Heinrich Maier and the Tyrolean Franz Josef Messner. The Catholic resistance group very successfully passed on plans and production facilities for V-1 rockets, V-2 rockets, Tiger tanks, Messerschmitt Me 163 Komet and other aircraft to the Allies, with which they could target German production facilities. Maier and his group informed the American secret service OSS very early on about the mass murder of Jews in Auschwitz. For after the war they planned an Austria united with South Tyrol and Bavaria.

After World War II, North Tyrol was governed by France and East Tyrol was part of the British Zone of occupation until Austria regained independence in 1955.

==Towns==

The capital, Innsbruck, is known for its university, and especially for its medicine. Tyrol is popular for its famous ski resorts, which include Kitzbühel, Ischgl and St. Anton. The 15 largest towns in Tyrol are:
==Demographics==
The historical population is given in the following chart:
== Economy ==
The federal state&#x27;s gross domestic product (GDP) was 34.6 billion euro in 2018, accounting for 9% of Austria&#x27;s economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 40,900 euro or 136% of the EU27 average in the same year.

== Transport ==
Tyrol has long been a central hub for European long-distance routes and thus a transit land for trans-European trade over the Alps. As early as the 1st century B.C. Tyrol had one of the most important north–south links of the Roman Empire, the Via Claudia Augusta. Roman roads crossed the Tyrol from the Po Plain in present-day Italy, following the course of the Etsch and Eisack in present South Tyrol over the Brenner and then following the northern Wipp valley to Hall. From there roads branched along the River Inn. The Via Raetia went westwards and up onto the Seefeld Plateau, where it crossed into Bavaria where Scharnitz is today. The Porta Claudia, built in the early 17th century is a fortification that underlines the importance of the road in the Early Modern Period.

Today Tyrol has international road, rail and air connections. Innsbruck Airport is Tyrol&#x27;s international airport. In addition there are several smaller airports in various places such as St. Johann in Tirol, Höfen in the Außerfern or Langkampfen. Many public transit companies operate a common tariff scheme as part of the Tyrol Transport Association.

==Administrative divisions==

The federal state is divided into nine districts (&quot;Bezirke&quot;); one of them, Innsbruck, is a statutory city. There are 277 municipalities. The districts and their administrative centres, from west to east and north to south, are:

; North Tyrol:
* Landeck District, (capital: Landeck)
* Reutte District, (Reutte)
* Imst District, (Imst)
* Innsbruck-Land, (Innsbruck, not part of the district)
* Innsbruck Stadt
* Schwaz District, (Schwaz)
* Kufstein District, (Kufstein)
* Kitzbühel District, (Kitzbühel)

; East Tyrol:
* Lienz District, (Lienz)

== Sister relationships ==
* Special Region of Yogyakarta, Indonesia

== Culture ==
The traditional form of mural art known as Lüftlmalerei is typical of Tyrolean villages and towns.

Kletzenbrot is a sweet bread made with dried fruits and nuts for the Advent season. Because it is associated with Tyrol it is also known as &quot;Tyrolean Dried Fruit Bread&quot;.

== Identity ==

The question of which regional unit was the bearer of primary identification was raised in the 1987 Austrian Consciousness Survey.
The possible answers were: the hometown (local patriotism), one&#x27;s own province (regional patriotism), (Central) Europe (European consciousness), the world (cosmopolitanism).

A research project led by Peter Diem offers a thoroughly comparable picture: In Vienna and Lower Austria, Austria patriotism dominated (1988) over territorial consciousness. In Upper Austria, Salzburg and Styria, national patriotism slightly outweighed federal state patriotism. In Carinthia, Tyrol and Vorarlberg, national patriotism clearly dominated. When asked to rate their own national patriotism on a ten-point scale, 83% of Carinthians, 69% of Tyroleans, 63% of Vorarlbergers, Burgenlanders and Styrians, 59% of Upper Austrians, 55% of Lower Austrians, 47% of Viennese and 43% of Salzburgers gave it the highest value.

The results of this study underline the assumption of a highly developed sense of national identity in most Austrian provinces. Peculiarly, the federal provinces are also largely &quot;endogamous&quot; in relation to other provinces, i.e. they correspond to what ethnologists would call a gentile association, a &quot;tribe&quot;.

It is therefore also permissible to identify the inhabitants of the Austrian provinces as the &quot;tribes&quot; that a book published in London would like to portray. (The Times Guide to the Peoples of Europe, London 1994The Times guide to the peoples of Europe)

<text>Electroclash (also known as synthcore, retro-electro, tech-pop, nouveau disco, and the new new wave) is a genre of popular music that fuses 1980s electro, new wave and synth-pop with 1990s techno, retro-style electropop and electronic dance music. It emerged in the late 1990s and was pioneered by and associated with acts such as I-F, DJ Hell, Miss Kittin and The Hacker, and Fischerspooner.

==Terminology and characteristics==
The term electroclash describes a musical movement that combined synthpop, techno, punk and performance art. The genre was in reaction to the rigid formulations of techno music, putting an emphasis on song writing, showmanship and a sense of humour, and was described by &quot;The Guardian&quot; as one of &quot;the two most significant upheavals in recent dance music history&quot;. The visual aesthetic of electroclash has been associated with the 1982 cult film &quot;Liquid Sky&quot;. DJ Hell is widely credited as inventor and name giver of the genre, while DJ and promoter Larry Tee later popularized the term in the US by naming the Electroclash 2001 Festival in New York after it.

==History==
===Role of International Deejay Gigolos===
Electroclash emerged in the late 1990s. The Munich-based label International DeeJay Gigolo Records, founded by DJ Hell, is considered the &quot;germ cell&quot; and &quot;THE home&quot; of the electroclash sound. Gigolo featured many of the early electroclash songs, such as for example Christopher Just&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m a Disco Dancer&quot; from 1997 or Chris Korda&#x27;s &quot;Save the Planet, Kill Yourself&quot;, which originally even had been released as early as 1993. Then in 1998, Gigolo released the songs &quot;1982&quot; and &quot;Frank Sinatra&quot; by French recording duo Miss Kittin &amp; The Hacker, which were among the most successful early hits of the new genre. This was followed by the hit &quot;Emerge&quot; by New York duo Fischerspooner, as well as the remake of Corey Hart&#x27;s &quot;Sunglasses at Night&quot; by Canadian duo Tiga &amp; Zyntherius, both released on Gigolo in 2001. DJ Hell brought the artists of the new genre together on the label and acted primarily as their mentor. But also Hell&#x27;s own releases like the album &quot;Munich Machine&quot; from 1998 are seen as groundbreaking for the genre Electroclash. In the widely recognized film documentary &quot;Welcome to the club! 25 years of electronic dance music&quot; by European television network Arte, Miss Kittin describes the origination of the first songs of the new style together with DJ Hell and declares him the inventor of the Electroclash genre. Since DJ Hell gathered the international artists of the new genre at Gigolo in Munich and many of them gave their first performances in the city&#x27;s nightclubs, Munich is considered the city in which electroclash &quot;was significantly co-invented, if not invented&quot;. Soon the new style of music also spread to other cities such as Berlin, London and New York.

===Other early artists===
Also I-F&#x27;s track &quot;Space Invaders Are Smoking Grass&quot;, released in 1998 on Disko B, with its &quot;old-fashioned verse-chorus dynamics to burbling electro in a vocodered homage to Atari-era hi-jinks&quot; is considered one of the pioneering tracks of the electroclash genre. Further early artists include Chicks on Speed, Peaches, ADULT. and Toktok vs. Soffy O with their year 2000 hit &quot;Missy Queen&#x27;s Gonna Die&quot;.

During their early years, Ladytron were sometimes labeled as electroclash, but others stated that they were not entirely electroclash and they also rejected this tag themselves. Goldfrapp&#x27;s albums &quot;Black Cherry&quot; (2003) and &quot;Supernature&quot; (2005) incorporated electroclash influences.

==Electroclash revival==

From around 2022, electroclash experienced a resurgence, led by several prominent artists. DJ Hell launched a new Electroclash tour, while Konerytmi presented a distinctive Electroclash 2022 live act in a steampunk-themed environment. Norbert Thunder contributed to the revival with his &quot;Fembot Actress EP&quot; in 2022, which included the festival hit track &quot;Groove, Style, Lights, Euphoria.&quot; The EP was marketed as an attempt to reintroduce the electroclash sound to contemporary audiences. Several record labels also began releasing electroclash vinyl records and EPs again, including the Spanish label Veintidós Rec. and the Italian label Rapid Eye Movement Records.

===Electroclash in the U.S.===
In the U.S. the genre gained media attention when the Electroclash Festival was held in New York in October 2001, aiming to &quot;make a local breakthrough with this scene, presenting a select group of superstar and pioneer artists from Europe and the U.S.&quot; The Electroclash Festival returned in 2002, followed by live tours across the US and Europe in 2003 and 2004. Notable artists who performed at the festival and subsequent tours include Scissor Sisters, ADULT., Erol Alkan, Princess Superstar, Mignon, Mount Sims, Tiga and Spalding Rockwell.

== Criticism ==
The electroclash label and the hype around it were fiercely criticized by some of its acclaimed protagonists in the early 2000s. For example, I-F and other artists signed an &quot;Anti-Electroclash-Manifest&quot;, where they complained about the sellout of the style by those who would &quot;rule the media waves&quot; and only &quot;sell the old freshly packaged&quot;. In 2002, Toktok vs. Soffy O. stated that when they were first asked about electroclash they just thought: &quot;This is nothing else than what we&#x27;ve known for at least five years and what is now reaching the recycling peak for the third or fourth time&quot;.

<text>Leonding () is a town southwest of Linz in the Austrian state of Upper Austria. It borders Puchenau and the river Danube in the north, Wilhering and Pasching in the west, Traun in the south and Linz in the east. Leonding is the most populous town of the Linz-Land district and the fourth most populous town in Upper Austria.

It is very close to Linz and offers views of the Alps and therefore attracts the upper social classes for living without providing much infrastructure on its own. Due to the proximity of Linz and transport connections (like West railway, Westautobahn, &quot;B1 Wiener Straße&quot; or Linz Airport) it attracts companies like Rosenbauer, Ebner Industrieofenbau, Poloplast or Neuson. Other major employers are the UNO Shopping Center (approximately 850 jobs) as well as the Plus City Shopping Center (approximately 2200 jobs).

From 1898 to 1905 Adolf Hitler lived in Leonding where he attended the local primary school and later a grammar school in nearby Linz. The graves of his parents Alois and Klara are in Leonding. His brother Edmund, who died of measles, was buried there too. A delegation of Passau National Socialists visited the family&#x27;s grave illegally. Hitler visited the grave in 1938. In 2012, when a relative of Alois Hitler&#x27;s first wife, Anna, did not renew the lease, the grave was dissolved.

In 1903, Hitler&#x27;s father died when drinking a glass of wine in a guesthouse in Leonding.

Leonding is split up into 22 localities: Aichberg, Alharting, Berg, Bergham, Buchberg, Doppl, Enzenwinkl, Felling, Friesenegg, Gaumberg, Haag, Hart, Holzheim, Imberg, Jetzing, Leonding, Reith, Rufling, St. Isidor, Staudach, Untergaumberg and Zaubertal.

==Population==
The Town of Leonding grew rapidly since the year 2000 and the Population in 2018 was 28,698 jumping up from 22,203 in 2001. This rapid growth was mainly due to affordable, decently sized homes that were much cheaper than those in neighboring Linz. Leonding is also a very attractive living area for middle class Families which is another reason for the speedy growth.

<doc id="149006" wikidata="Q158067" url="?curid=149006" title="Vivienne Westwood">
<text>Dame Vivienne Isabel Westwood (; 8 April 1941 – 29 December 2022) was an English fashion designer and businesswoman, largely responsible for bringing modern punk and new wave fashions into the mainstream. In 2022, &quot;Sky Arts&quot; ranked her the 4th most influential artist in Britain of the last 50 years.

Westwood came to public notice when she made clothes for the boutique that she and Malcolm McLaren ran on King&#x27;s Road, which became known as Sex. Their ability to synchronise clothing and music shaped the 1970s UK punk scene, which included McLaren&#x27;s band, the Sex Pistols. She viewed punk as a way of &quot;seeing if one could put a spoke in the system&quot;.

Westwood opened four shops in London and eventually expanded throughout Britain and the world, selling a varied range of merchandise, some of which promoted her political causes such as the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, climate change and civil rights groups.

==Life and career==
===Early years===
Westwood was born in Hollingworth, Cheshire, on 8 April 1941. She grew up in nearby Tintwistle, and was the daughter of Gordon Swire and Dora Swire (née Ball), who had married two years previously, two weeks after the outbreak of the Second World War. At the time of Vivienne&#x27;s birth, her father was employed as a storekeeper in an aircraft factory; he had previously worked as a greengrocer.

In 1958, her family moved to Harrow, Greater London. Westwood took a jewellery and silversmith course at the University of Westminster, then known as the Harrow Art School, but left after one term, saying: &quot;I didn&#x27;t know how a working-class girl like me could possibly make a living in the art world&quot;. After taking a job in a factory and studying at a teacher-training college, she became a primary-school teacher. During this period, she created her own jewellery, which she sold at a stall on Portobello Road.

In 1962, she met Derek Westwood, an apprentice at the Hoover factory, in Harrow. They married on 21 July 1962; Westwood made her own wedding dress. In 1963, she gave birth to a son, Benjamin.

===Malcolm McLaren===
Westwood&#x27;s marriage to Derek ended after she met Malcolm McLaren. Westwood and McLaren moved to Thurleigh Court in Balham, where their son Joseph Corré was born in 1967. Westwood continued to teach until 1971 and also created clothes which McLaren designed. McLaren became manager of the punk band the Sex Pistols, and subsequently the two garnered attention as the band wore Westwood&#x27;s and McLaren&#x27;s designs.

===Punk era===
Westwood was one of the architects of the punk fashion phenomenon of the 1970s, saying &quot;I was messianic about punk, seeing if one could put a spoke in the system in some way&quot;. Westwood&#x27;s emergence as a designer who made garments that reflected the economic, social, and political contexts of 1970s Britain coincided with a disillusioned youth, who developed a unique style of dress and musical expression which was instantly identifiable through its aesthetic and sound.

Westwood&#x27;s boutique, originally managed with McLaren, was a meeting place for early members of the London punk scene. The boutique regularly changed names and interior design through the 1970s to fit with collections and design inspirations. It remains in its original location at 430 Kings Road, Chelsea, London (under the name Worlds End since 1980, following a short period of closure in the 1980s) to this day.

McLaren and Westwood were keen entrepreneurs, and their designs sold in their boutique – named &quot;Let It Rock&quot;, &quot;Too Fast To Live Too Young To Die&quot;, &quot;Sex,&quot; and subsequently &quot;Seditionares&quot; – helped to define and market the punk look at the exact moment that it exploded in popularity on the streets of London. Westwood&#x27;s designs during the Punk Era and thereafter were informed by historicism; the V&amp;A describing Westwood as &quot;a meticulous researcher&quot;. Westwood began challenging gender norms and promoting experimentation in her designs, which at the outset were created in collaboration with McLaren.

Initially, Westwood created garments referencing the dress of the 1950s Teddy Boys, which were worn by McLaren. Upon opening &quot;Let It Rock&quot; in 1971, the first incarnation of Westwood and McLaren&#x27;s boutique, early creations for the shop incorporated such influences reminiscent of the youth subculture fashions of the 1950s. Inspired by the rebellious nature of the 1950s youth, Let It Rock referenced the clothing, music, and décor of the immediate postwar era.

In 1972, Let It Rock was refashioned into &quot;Too Fast To Live Too Young To Die&quot;, in homage to the death of James Dean. Though design references for garments retailed under Too Fast To Live Too Young To Die focussed on the rocker aesthetic of the 1960s, the boutique still sold Teddy Boy inspired garments under the Let It Rock label. The new politically leaning design inspirations for Too Fast To Live Too Young To Die were conveyed through Westwood&#x27;s sleeveless T-shirts, bearing various statements such as ‘PERV’ and ‘ROCK’, created using a combination of safety pins, chicken bones, and glitter glue.

Two years later, in 1974, Westwood and McLaren&#x27;s boutique was re-modelled, and reopened as &quot;Sex&quot;. Pieces sold in Sex were intentionally abrasive and challenging, with designs grounded in fetish and sado-masochism, seeking to provoke a comfortable middle class and inspire young punks into political action by challenging the status quo. Garments retailed at Sex included skirts and dresses made from rubber as well as t-shirts with pornographic material printed on them. The clothes often had large intentional rips in them and sizeable zippers incorporated into the garments.

Sex became a meeting point at the centre of the punk scene, and transformed into &quot;Seditionaries&quot; in 1976. Clothing retailed at &quot;Seditionaries (Seditionaries: Clothes for Heroes)&quot; retained the familiar references of Sex, including historicism, the challenging of gender norms, and fetish. However, Seditionaries pieces were made from different cloths and fibres. The development of Westwood signatures - bondage trousers covered with straps to restrict, ‘unravelling’ loose-knit jumpers made of mohair, and long-sleeved tops fashioned from soft muslins, which featured graphic screen printed designs and fastenings to the sleeves to give the effect of a straight-jacket – during this period quickly became archetypal punk staples.

Westwood also inspired the style of punk icons, such as Viv Albertine, who wrote in her memoir, &quot;Vivienne and Malcolm use clothes to shock, irritate and provoke a reaction but also to inspire change. Mohair jumpers, knitted on big needles, so loosely that you can see all the way through them, T-shirts slashed and written on by hand, seams and labels on the outside, showing the construction of the piece; these attitudes are reflected in the music we make. It&#x27;s OK to not be perfect, to show the workings of your life and your mind in your songs and your clothes.&quot;

Westwood was disenchanted with the direction that adoptees had taken punk in, many of them uninterested in punk&#x27;s political values, viewing the style of the movement as a marketing opportunity instead of a medium for radical change; with the dissolution of the Sex Pistols, Westwood&#x27;s inspiration for her eponymous line shifted instead to the 18th century. She was particularly influenced by Pirates and the Incroyables and merveilleuses a radical movement amongst nobles who had survived the French Revolution which referenced the guillotine to which many had lost family members.

===Fashion collections===
Westwood&#x27;s designs were independent and represented a statement of her own values. She collaborated on occasion with Gary Ness, who assisted Westwood with inspirations and titles for her collections.

McLaren and Westwood&#x27;s first fashion collection to be shown to the media and potential international buyers was &quot;Pirate&quot;, combining 18th and 19th century dress, British history and textiles with African prints. This was the first time in which Westwood explored her inspiration of historic sources in current day couture, the &quot;Pirate&quot; runway had featured both rap and an array of ethnic music. Subsequently, their partnership, which was underlined by the fact that both their names appeared on all labelling, produced collections in Paris and London with the thematic titles &quot;Savages&quot; (shown late 1981), &quot;Buffalo/Nostalgia Of Mud&quot; (shown spring 1982), &quot;Punkature&quot; (shown late 1982), &quot;Witches&quot; (shown early 1983) and &quot;Worlds End 1984&quot; (later renamed &quot;Hypnos&quot;, shown late 1983). After the partnership with McLaren was dissolved, Westwood showed one more collection under the Worlds End label: &quot;Clint Eastwood&quot; (late 1984–early 1985).She dubbed the period 1981–85 &quot;New Romantic&quot; (during which time she created the famous look of the band Adam and the Ants) and 1988–91 as &quot;The Pagan Years&quot; during which &quot;Vivienne&#x27;s heroes changed from punks and ragamuffins to &quot;Tatler&quot; girls wearing clothes that parodied the upper class&quot;. From 1985 to 1987, Westwood took inspiration from the ballet &quot;Petrushka&quot; to design the mini-crini, an abbreviated version of the Victorian crinoline. Its mini-length, bouffant silhouette inspired the puffball skirts widely presented by more established designers such as Christian Lacroix. The mini-crini was described in 1989 as a combination of two conflicting ideals - the crinoline, representing a &quot;mythology of restriction and encumbrance in woman&#x27;s dress&quot;, and the miniskirt, representing an &quot;equally dubious mythology of liberation&quot;. Westwood continued her research in fashion history by studying garments found in museum collections, which are evident through her incorporations of neck ruffs, corsets, bustles, breeches, and paniers in her various collections. Works from the artists Jean-Antione Watteau, Anthony van Dyck, and François Boucher have been used as inspiration for several pieces of Westwood&#x27;s garments including scarves, corsets, and leggings. 

For Autumn-Winter 1987/88, Westwood showcased the &#x27;&quot;Harris Tweed&quot;&#x27; collection which launched her long-standing relationship with the Scottish cloth, Harris tweed, and the Harris Tweed Authority. The collection is often credited as being instrumental in reviving its use as a fashion fabric, thereby boosting the local industry. In the collection, she had also adopted the use of the Orb logo, an orb resembling the Sovereign&#x27;s Orb with a satellite ring around it like the one around Saturn. This sparked heavy controversy as it was very similar to Orb Mark of the Harris Tweed Authority (at the time named &quot;The Harris Tweed Association&quot;).

Following her death, The Harris Tweed Authority released the following statement: 

In 2007, Westwood was approached by the Chair of King&#x27;s College London, Patricia Rawlings, to design an academic gown for the college after it had successfully petitioned the Privy Council for the right to award degrees. In 2008, the Westwood-designed academic dresses for King&#x27;s College were unveiled. On the gowns, Westwood commented: &quot;Through my reworking of the traditional robe I tried to link the past, the present and the future. We are what we know.&quot;

In July 2011, Westwood&#x27;s collections were presented at The Brandery fashion show in Barcelona.

Westwood worked closely with Richard Branson to design uniforms for the Virgin Atlantic crew. The uniform for the female crew consisted of a red suit, which accentuated the women&#x27;s curves and hips, and had strategically placed darts around the bust area. The men&#x27;s uniform consisted of a grey and burgundy three-piece suit with details on the lapels and pockets. Westwood and Branson were both passionate about using sustainable materials throughout their designs to reduce the impact on the environment and so used recycled polyester.

==Vivienne Westwood companies==
In March 2012, Vivienne Westwood Group reached agreement to end a long-standing UK franchise relationship with Manchester-based Hervia, which operated seven stores for the fashion chain. The deal brought to a conclusion a legal dispute, which included Hervia issuing High Court proceedings for alleged breach of contract, after Westwood sought to end the franchise deal before the agreed term. The subsequent transition of some of the Hervia stores to Westwood, along with cost-savings, was credited for a jump in Vivienne Westwood Ltd&#x27;s pre-tax profits by nearly a factor of 10, to £5 million from £527,683 the previous year.

The next year, the company announced: &quot;Over the last year margins have been under pressure due to the nature of wider retail conditions.&quot;

Shortly after, Westwood announced she would cease further expansion of her business as a way of tackling environmental and sustainability issues.

In March 2015, the company announced that it would open a three-story outpost in midtown Manhattan in New York City. This was followed by a new shop in a building also housing the company&#x27;s offices and showrooms in Rue Saint-Honoré in Paris, opening in early 2016.

As of December 2015, Vivienne Westwood Ltd operated 12 retail stores in the UK, including an outlet store in Bicester Village. There were 63 Westwood shops worldwide including nine in China, nine in Hong Kong, 18 in South Korea, six in Taiwan, two in Thailand, and two in the United States.

===Tax fine and perception===
In August 2011, Westwood&#x27;s company Vivienne Westwood Ltd agreed to pay £350,000 in tax plus interest of £144,112, due in 2009, to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) for underestimating the value of her brand. Her UK business had sold the rights to her trademarks to Luxembourg-based Latimo, which she controlled, for £840,000 in 2002. After examining the deal, HMRC argued that the brand had been undervalued. The £2 million valuation triggered additional taxes.

Accounts for Vivienne Westwood Ltd showed that since 2011, the company had continued to pay £2 million a year to offshore company Latimo for the right to use Westwood&#x27;s name on her own fashion label. Latimo, which Westwood controlled as the majority shareholder in her companies, was set up in 2002. Such arrangements, while legal, were against the Green Party policy to eliminate use of tax havens such as Luxembourg. In March 2015, Westwood said, &quot;It is important to me that my business affairs are in line with my personal values. I am subject to UK tax on all of my income&quot;. Later in 2015, she said that she had restructured her corporate tax arrangements to try to align them with the Green Party&#x27;s policy.

=== Criticism by &quot;Eluxe Magazine&quot; over sustainability of Westwood clothing ===
In 2013, sustainable luxury fashion publication &quot;Eluxe Magazine&quot; accused Westwood of using the green movement as a marketing tool because some of Westwood&#x27;s fashion and accessories lines are made in the People&#x27;s Republic of China. These were found to include PVC, polyester, rayon and viscose, all derived from harmful chemicals. &quot;Eluxe&quot; wrote that, despite Westwood&#x27;s statements that consumers should &#x27;buy less&#x27;, her company produces nine collections a year compared to the average designer&#x27;s two. &quot;Eluxe&quot; accused Westwood of using unpaid interns in her fashion house and making them work over 40 hours per week and wrote that some interns complained about their treatment by the fashion house.

==Notable clients and commissions==
In 1993, Westwood designed many of the colorful suits and outfits Duran Duran wore during their tour for The Wedding Album, as well as those that appeared in the three videos for that album: &quot;Ordinary World&quot;, &quot;Come Undone&quot; and &quot;Too Much Information&quot;.

Dita Von Teese wore a purple Westwood gown for her formal wedding ceremony when she married Marilyn Manson in 2005.

Marion Cotillard wore a Westwood red satin strapless dress at the London premiere of her film &quot;Public Enemies&quot; in 2009. In 2013, she wore a Westwood Couture pink and ivory striped dress at the Chopard lunch in Cannes.

In 2011, Princess Eugenie wore three Westwood designs for the pre-wedding dinner, the wedding ceremony and the after-wedding party at the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton.

Pharrell Williams wore a Westwood Buffalo hat that was originally in Westwood&#x27;s 1982–83 collection to the 2014 56th Annual Grammy Awards. The hat was so popular that it inspired its own Twitter account. Williams was first seen wearing a similar Westwood Buffalo hat in 2009.

Dua Lipa wore custom Westwood on the red carpet of the 2021 Brit Awards.

In &quot;Final Fantasy XV&quot;, Lunafreya Nox Fleuret&#x27;s wedding dress was designed by Westwood.

===&quot;Sex and the City&quot;===
Westwood&#x27;s designs were featured in the 2008 film adaptation of the television series &quot;Sex and the City&quot;. In the film, Carrie Bradshaw becomes engaged to long-term lover Mr. Big. Being a writer at &quot;Vogue&quot;, she is invited by her editor to model wedding dresses, including a design made by Westwood. The dress is subsequently sent to Carrie as a gift, with a handwritten note from Westwood herself, and Carrie decides to use the Westwood gown. The wedding dress has also been described as one of the movie&#x27;s most iconic features, leading Westwood to approach the producers about being involved in making a sequel. A version of the dress was subsequently made available for purchase on Net-a-porter, and sold out in a matter of hours. It was available as a knee-length version.

==Political involvement==
In April 1989, Westwood appeared on the cover of &quot;Tatler&quot; dressed as Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. The suit that Westwood wore had been ordered for Thatcher but not yet delivered. The cover, which bore the caption &quot;This woman was once a punk&quot;, was included in &quot;The Guardian&quot; list of the best ever UK magazine covers.

In September 2005, Westwood joined forces with the British civil rights group Liberty and launched exclusive limited design T-shirts and baby wear bearing the slogan &quot;I AM NOT A TERRORIST, please don&#x27;t arrest me&quot;. She said she was supporting the campaign and defending habeas corpus. &quot;When I was a schoolgirl, my history teacher, Mr. Scott, began to take classes in civic affairs. The first thing he explained to us was the fundamental rule of law embodied in &quot;habeas corpus&quot;. He spoke with pride of civilisation and democracy. The hatred of arbitrary arrest by the &quot;lettres de cachet&quot; of the French monarchy caused the storming of the Bastille. We can only take democracy for granted if we insist on our liberty&quot;, she said. The sale of the £50 T-shirts raised funds for the organisation. Westwood stated on television in 2007 that she had transferred her long-standing support for the Labour Party to the Conservatives, due to concerns about civil liberties and human rights.

On Easter Sunday 2008, she campaigned in person at the biggest Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament demonstration in ten years, at the Atomic Weapons Establishment, Aldermaston, Berkshire.
The next year, she cut off her hair to highlight the dangers of climate change. She also appeared in a PETA ad campaign to promote World Water Day and vegetarianism, drawing attention to the meat industry&#x27;s water consumption.

In 2014, Westwood bought a controlling interest in the equity crowdfunding platform Trillion Fund, which was dissolved in 2019.

In January 2015, Westwood stated her support of the Green Party: &quot;I am investing in the Green Party because I believe it is in the best interests of our country and our economy&quot;. It was reported that she had donated £300,000 to fund the party&#x27;s election campaign. In February 2015, Westwood was announced as the special guest on the Greens&#x27; &quot;We Are The Revolution&quot; campaigning tour of English universities in such cities as Liverpool, Norwich, Brighton and Sheffield. On the eve of the tour, Westwood was excluded from appearing by the youth wing of the Green Party due to her avoidance of UK corporate tax, which contravened party policy on usage of off-shore tax havens. She later condemned this as &quot;a wasted opportunity&quot; for the Greens. &quot;I wasn&#x27;t pure enough for them&quot;, she wrote in her online diary. Subsequently, Westwood switched her support to campaigning on behalf of Nigel Askew, the &#x27;We are the Reality Party&#x27; candidate opposing UKIP leader Nigel Farage in the Kent constituency of Thanet South. Askew polled 126 votes in the election.

In June 2017, Westwood endorsed Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn for the 2017 general election. She said, &quot;I&#x27;m excited about the Labour Party manifesto because it&#x27;s all about the fair distribution of wealth.&quot; She added &quot;Jeremy clearly wants to go green and creating a fair distribution of wealth is the place to start, from there we can build a green economy which will secure our future.&quot; In November 2019, along with other public figures, Westwood signed a letter supporting Corbyn that described him as &quot;a beacon of hope in the struggle against emergent far-right nationalism, xenophobia and racism in much of the democratic world&quot; and endorsed him in the 2019 UK general election.

===Active Resistance manifesto===
In a 2007 interview, Westwood spoke out against what she perceived as the &quot;drug of consumerism&quot;. She said: &quot;I don&#x27;t feel comfortable defending my clothes. But if you&#x27;ve got the money to afford them, then buy something from me. Just don&#x27;t buy too much&quot; in response to claims that anti-consumerism and fashion contradict each other.

Later, Westwood created a manifesto called &quot;Active Resistance to Propaganda&quot;, which she said deals with the pursuit of art in relation to the human predicament and climate change. She claimed that her manifesto &quot;penetrates to the root of the human predicament and offers the underlying solution. We have the choice to become more cultivated and therefore more human – or by muddling along as usual we shall remain the destructive and self-destroying animal, the victim of our own cleverness.&quot; The manifesto was read by Westwood at a number of venues including the London Transport Museum and distributed after readings as a booklet. It was then written in the form of a play and staged at the Bloomsbury Ballroom by Forbidden London and Dave West on 4 December 2009. It starred Michelle Ryan and a number of other British actors.

Westwood&#x27;s manifesto was criticized by eco-activists who claimed that despite her calls to save the environment, she herself made no concessions to making her clothing or her business eco-friendly.

===Julian Assange and WikiLeaks===
Westwood was a longtime supporter of Julian Assange and WikiLeaks, and called for his release from custody. In June 2013, Westwood dedicated one of her collections to Chelsea Manning and at her fashion show she and all her models wore large image badges of Manning with the word &quot;Truth&quot; under her picture. In 2012, she used her appearances at London Fashion Week to push for Assange&#x27;s release by presenting &quot;I am Julian Assange&quot; t-shirts. She visited him several times during his political asylum at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and in Belmarsh Prison after his arrest in April 2019. In July 2020, she protested outside London&#x27;s Old Bailey court against Assange&#x27;s possible extradition to the United States by wearing a yellow pantsuit and suspending herself in a giant birdcage. Describing herself as the canary in the coal mine, she said she was &quot;half-poisoned already from government corruption of law and gaming of the legal system by government&quot;.

For Assange&#x27;s wedding to Stella Moris in March 2022 in Belmarsh Prison, the groom wore an outfit based on a Scottish kilt and the bride a dress with a graffiti application, both designs by Westwood and her husband, Austrian fashion designer Andreas Kronthaler.

==Books==
Westwood was also a noted author or co-author of books, such as &quot;Fashion in Art: The Second Empire and Impressionism&quot;, in which she explored the worlds of fashion and the arts and the links between them.

&quot;Vivienne Westwood Opus 2008 limited edition&quot; was published for London Fashion Week 2008, documents Westwood&#x27;s work and is also a unique work of art. The book measures , weighs , with a total limited edition of 900. There are 9 different covers and titles each numbered 1 to 100: manifesto, cockroach propaganda, pirate squiggle, propaganda eyes, I am expensive, AR-Vivienne Westwood, innocent, active resistance to propaganda and union jack. The Opus contains 97 large-format Polaroid photographs, each measuring . The subjects include Westwood, her friends and models, including Naomi Campbell, Kate Moss, Jerry Hall, Georgina May-Jagger, the Duchess of York Sarah Ferguson, Tim Burton, Sir Bob Geldof, Jasmine Guinness, and Helena Bonham Carter.

==Recognition==
In the 1992 Birthday Honours, Westwood was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for services to fashion design. She received her medal from Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace; at the ceremony, Westwood wore nothing but sheer tights with a reinforced bikini top under her skirt, which was later captured by a photographer in the courtyard of the Palace. Westwood later said, &quot;I wished to show off my outfit by twirling the skirt. It did not occur to me that, as the photographers were practically on their knees, the result would be more glamorous than I expected,&quot; and added: &quot;I have heard that the picture amused the Queen.&quot; Westwood advanced from OBE to Dame Commander of the same Order (DBE) in the 2006 New Year Honours &quot;for services to British fashion&quot;, and earned the award for British Designer of the Year on three occasions.

She was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts (FRSA).

Westwood was awarded a Fellowship at King&#x27;s College London in 2007, and in 2008 she designed 20 new academic gowns and hoods for King&#x27;s students to wear at their graduation ceremonies. In 2008, Heriot-Watt University awarded Westwood an honorary degree of Doctor of Letters for her contribution to the industry and use of Scottish textiles.

In January 2011, Westwood was featured in a Canadian-made television documentary called &quot;Vivienne Westwood&#x27;s London&quot; in which she takes the viewer through her favourite parts of London, including the Courtauld Institute of Art, the Wallace Collection, Whitechapel (accompanied by Sara Stockbridge), Hampton Court, the London Symphony Orchestra, Brixton Market and Electric Avenue, and the National Gallery.

In 2012, Westwood was among the British cultural icons selected by artist Sir Peter Blake to appear in a new version of his most famous artwork – the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; album cover – to celebrate the British cultural figures of his life that he most admires. Also in 2012, Westwood was chosen as one of &quot;The New Elizabethans&quot; to mark the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. A panel of seven academics, journalists and historians named Westwood among a group of 60 people in the UK &quot;whose actions during the reign of Elizabeth II have had a significant impact on lives in these islands and given the age its character&quot;. A tartan outfit designed by Westwood featured on a commemorative UK postage stamp issued by the Royal Mail in 2012, celebrating Great British Fashion.

In October 2014, the authorised biography &quot;Vivienne Westwood&quot; by Ian Kelly was published by Picador. Paul Gorman described it as &quot;sloppy&quot; and &quot;riddled with inaccuracies&quot; on the basis of multiple errors in the book including misspelling the names of popular rock stars &quot;Jimmy&quot; Hendrix and Pete &quot;Townsend&quot; and misidentifying the date of the Sex Pistols&#x27; first concert and McLaren&#x27;s age when he died. Regarding Gorman&#x27;s claims, Picador publisher Paul Baggaley told &quot;The Bookseller&quot;: &quot;We always take very seriously any errors that are brought to our attention and, where appropriate, correct them.&quot; A spokesman for Macmillan Publishers, which published an Australian edition of the biography, confirmed that the matter was being handled by the publisher&#x27;s lawyers.

In 2016, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, acquired a Tits t-shirt, designed by McLaren and sold at Seditionaries between 1976 and 1980.

In 2018, a documentary film about Westwood, called &quot;Westwood: Punk, Icon, Activist&quot;, premiered. The next year, Isabel Sanches Vegara wrote and Laura Callaghan illustrated &quot;Vivienne Westwood&quot;, one of the series, &quot;Little People, Big Dreams&quot;, published by Frances Lincoln Publishing.

In 2022, the documentary &quot;ART LOVERS UNITE!&quot; starring Vivienne Westwood, directed by Patrick J. Thomas &amp; Dacob, had its world premiere at the Melbourne Documentary Film Festival in Australia.

==Personal life==
Westwood had two children. Ben Westwood (born 1963) is her son with first husband Derek Westwood; he is a photographer of erotica. Her second son, Joseph Corré (born 1967) with second husband Malcolm McLaren, is the founder of lingerie brand Agent Provocateur. Cora Corré, activist and model, is her granddaughter.

Westwood married her former fashion student, Andreas Kronthaler, in 1992.

For 30 years, Westwood lived in an ex–council flat on Nightingale Lane, Clapham. In 2000, Kronthaler convinced her to move into a Queen Anne style house in Clapham built in 1703. She was a keen gardener and a vegetarian. She identified spiritually as a Taoist.

===80th birthday===
To celebrate her 80th birthday, Westwood was commissioned by CIRCA, an art platform founded in 2020 by British-Irish artist Josef O&#x27;Connor, to present a new video work on the Piccadilly Lights screen in Piccadilly Circus, London. In the ten-minute film created with her brother, the punk icon performed a rewritten rendition of &quot;Without You&quot; from &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; to offer a stark warning of societal indifference to the looming environmental catastrophes, a call against the arms trade, and its link to climate change: &quot;I have a plan 2 save the World. Capitalism is a war economy + war is the biggest polluter, therefore Stop War + change economy 2 fair distribution of wealth at the same time: NO MANS LAND. Let&#x27;s be clear, U + I can&#x27;t stop war just like that. But we can stop arms production + that would halt climate change cc + financial Crash. Long term this will stop war&quot;. In an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, her husband Andreas Kronthaler was quoted as saying, &quot;It was a beautiful day because for once she let herself enjoy it.&quot;

===Death===
Westwood died in Clapham, London, on 29 December 2022, aged 81.

Former Sex Pistols bass guitarist Glen Matlock paid tribute to Westwood on Twitter, stating that it was &quot;a privilege to have rubbed shoulders with her in the mid &#x27;70s at the birth of punk and the waves it created that still resound today for the disaffected.&quot; Chrissie Hynde, singer and guitarist of The Pretenders, who had previously been employed as a shop assistant by Westwood and McLaren at Sex during the 1970s, tweeted: &quot;Vivienne is gone and the world is already a less interesting place.&quot; Others who paid tribute to Westwood on social media included singer Simon Le Bon from Duran Duran, Boy George, comedian Russell Brand, former Frankie Goes to Hollywood singer Holly Johnson, pop band Bananarama, singer and multimedia artist Yoko Ono, singer Paul McCartney, and the fashion house Alexander McQueen.

Former co-leader of the Green Party MP Caroline Lucas said of Westwood: &quot;Such a legend, a huge inspiration, brilliantly creative and always a committed activist for people and planet – my thoughts are with her family and friends – RIP.&quot;

In January 2023 a private funeral was held at Christ Church in Tintwistle, Derbyshire, the village where Westwood grew up, where the church was decorated with of MacLeod Harris Tweed tartan, worth around £45,000. A memorial service for Westwood was held, at Southwark Cathedral in London, on 16 February 2023.

==Portraits of Vivienne Westwood==
The National Portrait Gallery holds 18 images of Westwood taken between 1990 and 2014, including those by Mario Testino, Jane Bown, Juergen Teller, Anne-Katrin Purkiss, and Martin Parr.

<doc id="149007" wikidata="Q325377" url="?curid=149007" title="Malcolm McLaren">
<text>Malcolm Robert Andrew McLaren (22 January 1946 – 8 April 2010) was an English fashion designer and music manager. He was a promoter and a manager for punk rock and new wave bands such as New York Dolls, Sex Pistols, Adam and the Ants, and Bow Wow Wow, and was an early commercial architect of the punk subculture.

McLaren was brought up by his grandmother after his father, Peter, left the family home. He attended several British art colleges in the 1960s, where he became involved in underground art and left-wing activism. From 1974 to 1976, he operated the Chelsea boutique Sex with his girlfriend Vivienne Westwood, which helped shape early punk fashion and became an early hub for the subculture in London. After a period advising the New York Dolls in the United States, McLaren managed the Sex Pistols, for which he recruited frontman Johnny Rotten. The issue of a controversial record, &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;, satirizing the Queen&#x27;s Jubilee in 1977, was typical of McLaren&#x27;s shock tactics, and he gained publicity by being arrested after a promotional boat trip outside the Houses of Parliament.

In the 1980s, McLaren continued managing other London based acts and performed as a solo artist, initially focusing on hip hop and world music and later diversifying into funk, disco, and electronic dance music. When accused of turning popular culture into a cheap marketing gimmick, he joked that he hoped it was true. His first album, &quot;Duck Rock, w&quot;as certified silver in the UK and spawned the top-ten singles &quot;Buffalo Gals&quot; and &quot;Double Dutch&quot;.

In his later years, he lived in Paris and New York City and died of peritoneal mesothelioma in a Swiss hospital.

== Early years ==
McLaren was born on 22 January 1946 to Scottish-born&lt;ref name=&quot;forward/mclaren-jewish&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; engineer Peter McLaren, an upper-middle-class Londoner who was at that time serving with the Royal Engineers, and Emily Isaacs, the daughter of tailor Mick Isaacs and independently wealthy Rose Corré Isaacs, whose father had been a Portuguese Sephardic Jewish diamond dealer.

McLaren&#x27;s parents divorced when he was two after Peter McLaren left the family home due to his wife&#x27;s serial infidelity: McLaren later alleged that her lovers included the Selfridges magnate Sir Charles Clore and Sir Isaac Wolfson, owner of Universal Stores.

&quot;We&#x27;ve talked to Malcolm&#x27;s mum. Even she doesn&#x27;t like him.&quot; — Judy and Fred Vermorel,&lt;ref name=&quot;google-books/HuhxPAAACAAJ&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;richmond.ac.uk/vermorel&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 1984

Subsequently, McLaren was raised by his grandmother Rose, alone,&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph/out-of-will&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; next door at No. 49. 

At age 16, McLaren left Orange Hill with three O-levels and was briefly employed in a handful of jobs before attending classes at St Martin&#x27;s School of Art and then undertaking a foundation course at Harrow School of Art. Other arts institutions attended by McLaren over the next seven years included the South East Essex School of Art in Walthamstow and Goldsmiths.

== Fashion design and music ==

=== 430 King&#x27;s Road, Vivienne Westwood and New York Dolls ===
In October 1971, McLaren took over the back part of the retail premises at 430 King&#x27;s Road in Chelsea, West London, and sold rock and roll records, refurbished 1950s radiograms and dead stock clothing as &quot;In The Back Of Paradise Garage&quot;. With the assistance of art school friend Patrick Casey, McLaren converted the entire ground floor into the store and renamed it Let It Rock initially selling clothing (dead stock, military surplus) and objects he&#x27;d sourced. When the shop became a success, he enlisted the help of his then-girlfriend Vivienne Westwood who customized and repaired original clothing and made facsimiles.

Let It Rock was patronised by teddy boys and McLaren and Westwood&#x27;s designs also appeared in such theatrical and cinematic productions such as &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot; and &quot;That&#x27;ll Be The Day&quot;. In spring 1973 the store was renamed Too Fast To Live Too Young To Die and began selling original 1950s-inspired leather clothing. Among the commissions were costumes for Ken Russell&#x27;s film &quot;Mahler&quot;. In August 1973, McLaren and Westwood visited New York to participate in the National Boutique Fair, where they began an association with the New York Dolls, supplying them with stage wear and joining their group on tour in the UK and France. In October 1974, he renamed the outlet Sex to reflect its move towards fetish fashion and provocation. In January 1975, McLaren and Westwood designed red patent leather costumes for the New York Dolls and used a Soviet-style hammer and sickle motif for their stage shows in the US as an attempt to attract attention through provocation. This ploy was not successful and the Dolls soon broke up, with guitarist Johnny Thunders specifically naming McLaren as &quot;the reason why we broke up.&quot; McLaren instead blamed Thunders and drummer Jerry Nolan&#x27;s drug addictions for the split. In May 1975, McLaren returned to Britain.

=== Sex Pistols ===
From 1974, McLaren had advised Sex customers Paul Cook and Steve Jones on their musical aspirations, having proposed that one of his shop assistants, Glen Matlock, join them as the bass-player in a group McLaren named Kutie Jones and his Sex Pistols. In the summer of 1975, McLaren ejected frontman Wally Nightingale from the line-up because he did not fit with McLaren&#x27;s vision for the band&#x27;s image. His one-time associate Bernie Rhodes, who would later become the manager of the Clash, claimed he spotted a new frontman in another customer, John Lydon, then sporting green hair and torn clothes with the words &quot;I hate&quot; written on a Pink Floyd T-shirt above the band&#x27;s name. After Lydon joined, McLaren dubbed him &quot;Johnny Rotten&quot; and shortened the band&#x27;s name to simply Sex Pistols, stating that he wanted to give the impression of &quot;sexy young assassins&quot;.

In May 1977, a few months after McLaren replaced Matlock with Sid Vicious (supposedly because Matlock &quot;liked The Beatles&quot;), the band released the anti-monarchy protest song &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; during the week of Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s Silver Jubilee. McLaren organised a boat trip down the Thames in which the Sex Pistols would perform their music outside the Houses of Parliament. The boat was raided by the police and McLaren was arrested, thus achieving his goal to obtain publicity.

The band released their album &quot;Never Mind the Bollocks, Here&#x27;s the Sex Pistols&quot; in October 1977 and played their last UK gig before embarking upon a U.S. tour in January 1978. McLaren was accused by the band of mismanaging them and refusing to pay them when they asked him for money. McLaren stated that he had planned out the entire career path of the Sex Pistols, which he illustrated in the film &quot;The Great Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Swindle.&quot; Lydon&#x27;s feelings of being used by McLaren formed the creative impetus for his subsequent band Public Image Ltd. The contractual rights to the Sex Pistols&#x27; name were disputed in a case brought by Lydon, Jones, Cook and the estate of Sid Vicious in 1979 against McLaren&#x27;s management company Glitterbest. In 1986 the High Court awarded the rights to the group&#x27;s name, &quot;The Great Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Swindle&quot;, the artwork, master tapes and the group&#x27;s income to Lydon and the others. In the 2000 film &quot;The Filth and the Fury&quot;, the surviving members of the Sex Pistols gave their version of events. McLaren is portrayed during his time as the Sex Pistols&#x27; manager by David Hayman in the film &quot;Sid and Nancy&quot; and by Thomas Brodie-Sangster in the miniseries &quot;Pistol&quot;.

=== Other artists ===
McLaren was approached by Adam Ant to manage Adam and the Ants following their debut album release in late 1979. Shortly thereafter, three members of the band left to form Bow Wow Wow under McLaren&#x27;s management. McLaren continued to manage Ant as he formed a new lineup of the Ants and also advised the Slits and Jimmy the Hoover.

The members of Bow Wow Wow were dressed in clothing designed by McLaren and Westwood, and he embroiled the group in such controversies as plans to publish a magazine titled &quot;Chicken&quot;, to celebrate sex between individuals under the age of consent.

=== Solo music career ===
In 1983, McLaren released &quot;Duck Rock&quot;, an album that, in collaboration with producer and co-writer Trevor Horn and the World&#x27;s Famous Supreme Team (a duo of hip hop radio disc jockeys from New York City who hosted a hip hop and classic R&amp;B show on WHBI 105.9 FM and were among the first DJs to introduce the art of scratching to the world), mixed up influences from Africa and the Americas, including hip hop. The album helped bring hip-hop to a wider audience. The singles &quot;Buffalo Gals&quot; and &quot;Double Dutch&quot; became top-10 hits in the UK, with the former also a minor regional hit in the US.

In 1984 McLaren turned to electronic music and opera on the single &quot;Madame Butterfly&quot;, which reached No.13 in the UK and No.16 in Australia. The producer of the single, Stephen Hague, became much sought after following his work with McLaren on the LP &quot;Fans&quot;.

McLaren&#x27;s 1989 album &quot;Waltz Darling&quot; was a funk and disco album inspired by the voguing subculture. The singles &quot;Waltz Darling&quot; and &quot;Something&#x27;s Jumpin&#x27; in Your Shirt&quot; became top-20 radio hits in Europe. A remix of &quot;Deep in Vogue&quot; was instrumental in bringing voguing and ball culture to wider public attention, topping the U.S. dance chart in July 1989 (some nine months before the global success of Madonna&#x27;s similarly themed &quot;Vogue&quot;). &quot;Deep in Vogue&quot; is also notable for McLaren&#x27;s collaborations with vogue performer Willi Ninja and filmmaker Jennie Livingston, who directed the promotional music video and gave McLaren and remix producers Mark Moore and William Orbit permission to sample audio from the soundtrack of her then-unreleased voguing documentary &quot;Paris Is Burning&quot;.

McLaren personally hired Creative Director John Carver to handle the design and art direction for &quot;Waltz Darling&quot;. He was introduced to John by mutual friend Tommy Roberts at The Titanic nightclub, near Berkeley Square. McLaren and Carver spent a week together discussing visual references. McLaren returned to New York and Carver was left to design and art direct the album and singles sleeves.

In 1989, McLaren and composer Yanni arranged the &quot;Flower Duet&quot; into a work called &quot;Aria on Air&quot;. The &quot;Flower Duet&quot; theme, taken from the French opera &quot;Lakmé&quot; by Léo Delibes, had already been used by composer Howard Blake to accompany British Airways commercials since 1984. However, in 1989 McLaren and Yanni further arranged the &quot;Flower Duet&quot; and it featured in BA&#x27;s &quot;World&#x27;s Favourite Airline&quot; global advertising campaign of the 1980s and 1990s.

In 1992, McLaren co-wrote the song &quot;Carry On Columbus&quot; for the feature film of the same name. The song plays over the end credits of the film.

In 1994, he recorded the concept album &quot;Paris&quot;, with appearances by such prominent French stars as actress Catherine Deneuve, musician Françoise Hardy, and fashion designer Sonia Rykiel.

In 1998, McLaren released &quot;Buffalo Gals Back 2 Skool&quot; (Virgin Records), an album featuring hip hop artists Rakim, KRS-One, De La Soul and producer Henri Scars Struck revisiting tracks from the original &quot;Duck Rock&quot; album. That year, he also created a band called Jungk. This project was not a commercial success. Around this time he released a track called &quot;The Bell Song&quot; as a single available in a variety of remixes.

McLaren contributed a track, &quot;About Her&quot;, to the soundtrack of Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s 2004 film &quot;Kill Bill: Volume 2&quot;. The song heavily samples &quot;She&#x27;s Not There&quot; by the Zombies, and uses Bessie Smith&#x27;s &quot;St. Louis Blues&quot; by looping the phrase: &quot;My man&#x27;s got a heart like a rock cast in the sea&quot;. In November 2005, a court in Angers, France, cleared McLaren of plagiarism accusations made by French audio engineer Benjamin Beduneau. Beduneau, who had worked for McLaren and was paid by him through the studio, had taken McLaren&#x27;s unfinished demos and fraudulently registered them under his own name at the French Composer Society, Sacem. The court ruled in McLaren&#x27;s favor and ordered Beduneau to pay damages, which he never did.

McLaren&#x27;s solo work, particularly from the &quot;Duck Rock&quot; period, has been sampled by other artists. In 1999, Dope Smugglaz had a UK Top 20 hit with the track &quot;Double Double Dutch&quot;, which made extensive use of samples from McLaren&#x27;s original &quot;Double Dutch&quot;. In 1997, Mariah Carey&#x27;s &quot;Honey&quot; and its &quot;Bad Boy Remix&quot; sampled &quot;Hey DJ&quot;. In 2002, Eminem released a track called &quot;Without Me&quot;, which incorporated &quot;Buffalo Gals&quot;. In 2007, McLaren&#x27;s song &quot;World&#x27;s Famous&quot; was sampled by R&amp;B singer Amerie on the song &quot;Some Like It&quot; from her album &quot;Because I Love It&quot;.

In 2001, author Paul Gorman published his book &quot;The Look: Adventures In Rock &amp; Pop Fashion&quot; with a foreword and contributions from McLaren. The 2006 second edition included a CD featuring the track &quot;Deux&quot; from the &quot;Paris Remixes&quot; album.

=== Royalty payment controversies ===
In 1982, McLaren visited Johannesburg in South Africa. His hit song, &quot;Double Dutch&quot; was taken from &quot;Puleng&quot;, by mbaqanga band &quot;The Boyoyo Boys&quot;, as was the flip side &quot;Zulus on a Time Bomb&quot;, from &quot;Tsotsi&quot;. &quot;On The Road To Soweto&quot; was lifted from a General MD Shirinda and the Gaza Sisters song, &quot;He Mdjadji&quot;, while two songs were taken from the Mahotella Queens, with &quot;Thina Siyakhanyisa&quot; becoming &quot;Jive My Baby&quot;, and &quot;Kgarebe Tsaga Mothusi&quot; becoming &quot;Punk It Up&quot;.

McLaren had previously plagiarised the Mahotella Queens song &quot;Umculo Kawupheli&quot;, which formed the basis of the Bow Wow Wow hit &quot;See Jungle! (Jungle Boy)&quot;. None of the artists concerned received any royalty payments at the time. McLaren was later sued, with a UK judge freezing royalty payments to McLaren. The case was then settled out of court for an undisclosed sum of money.

== Film production ==
In 1984, McLaren turned away from record-making in favour of theatrical and film production, starting with a musical version of the Fans album to be staged off-Broadway with the impresario Joseph Papp. This was to remain in development for three years and involved contributions from the choreographer Tommy Tune.

Simultaneously, McLaren worked with various collaborators on a film treatment which mixed the story of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; with the life of the couturier Christian Dior. Titled &quot;Fashion Beast,&quot; this was among a slate of productions McLaren pitched in Hollywood in the first half of 1985 to such film industry bigwigs as entertainment mogul David Geffen and Geffen&#x27;s head of production at his company, Lynda Obst.

In the summer of 1985 McLaren was appointed to the position of production executive at CBS Theatrical Films, the TV and stage arm of CBS Films. Working from an office on the CBS lot and living in a house in the hills above the Hollywood Bowl, McLaren focused on &quot;Fans: The Musical&quot; and &quot;Fashion Beast&quot;, for which he commissioned British comic book writer Alan Moore to write a script, and developed a raft of properties including &quot;Heavy Metal Surfing Nazis&quot;, about post-apocalyptic turf wars among gangs on California&#x27;s environmentally damaged beaches; &quot;The Rock&#x27;n&#x27;Roll Godfather&quot;, a biopic of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s manager Peter Grant; and &quot;Wilde West&quot;, based on the notion of Oscar Wilde discovering the roots of rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll during his celebrated 1882 lecture tour of the US.

McLaren gained interest in the latter project and &quot;Fans: The Musical&quot; from Steven Spielberg, and when CBS Theatrical Films closed at the end of 1985, was employed as an ideas guru at Spielberg&#x27;s Amblin Entertainment while continuing to pitch his projects to other studios on a freelance basis. McLaren succeeded in attracting development funding for Fashion Beast from Manhattan nightlife entrepreneur Robert Boykin and the film was optioned by the newly founded independent production house Avenue Pictures, but after several rewrites the project faltered not least when Boykin&#x27;s health suffered. He died from complications arising from Aids in 1988.

In 2012, Alan Moore adapted the &quot;Fashion Beast&quot; script for serialisation as a 10-issue comic book published by Avatar Press.

In the early 90s McLaren returned to Europe and working out of London and Paris subsequently produced several film and television projects, starting with The Ghosts of Oxford Street, which he co-directed, wrote and starred in. This was broadcast on Christmas Eve that year by British national TV channel Channel 4. This musical history of London&#x27;s Oxford Street was also narrated by McLaren and included performances by Happy Mondays, Tom Jones, Rebel MC, Kirsty MacColl, John Altman and Sinéad O&#x27;Connor.

In 2000, McLaren scripted and performed in the six-part series &quot;Being Malcolm&quot; for the French digital youth channel Jimmy and continued to develop film properties, the most successful of which was the 2006 film &quot;Fast Food Nation&quot;, which he produced from Eric Schlosser&#x27;s book &quot;Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal&quot;, having appointed British producer Jeremy Thomas, with whom he had worked with on &quot;The Great Rock&#x27;n&#x27;Roll Swindle&quot;, and director Richard Linklater to the project.

== Campaign to become Mayor of London ==
An article in the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, published on 20 December 1999, titled &quot;My Vision for London&quot;, included the &quot;McLaren Manifesto&quot;, prompting speculation that McLaren might stand to be elected as Mayor of London. With funds sourced from Sony Music by the rock music entrepreneur Alan McGee, McLaren subsequently launched a campaign to stand as an independent candidate in the inaugural elections for the position in May 2000.

With a range of policy proposals, from environmentally-sensitive traffic calming to providing public libraries with licences to serve alcohol, McLaren took to the hustings in protest at &quot;the great political swindle of the mainstream parties who are plotting to make London expensive, oppressive and boring&quot;.

According to McLaren&#x27;s campaign manager, the late entry into the mayoral race by Ken Livingstone forced him out of the running.

== Radio and TV projects ==
In 2006, McLaren presented the documentary series &quot;Malcolm McLaren&#x27;s Musical Map of London&quot; for BBC Radio 2, followed in 2007 by &quot;Malcolm McLaren&#x27;s Life and Times in L.A.&quot;

Also in 2007, McLaren competed in a reality TV show for ITV titled &quot;The Baron&quot;, filmed in the small Scottish fishing village of Gardenstown. The series was due to be shown in August 2007 but was postponed owing to the death of fellow contestant actor Mike Reid shortly after filming was completed. It was eventually broadcast starting on 24 April 2008. During filming McLaren was seen urinating into the harbour and loudly telling assembled inhabitants of the devout town, &quot;Jesus is a sausage&quot;, at which point he was physically assaulted by a resident. McLaren came last in the competition, which was won by Reid.

It was announced on 7 November 2007 that McLaren would be one of the contestants in the seventh series of the ITV reality show &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!&quot;, set in the outback of Australia and premiered on British television on Monday 12 November 2007, but he pulled out the day he had flown to Australia. He told the press &quot;it is fake&quot;, that he didn&#x27;t know any of the other celebrities and quite frankly, &quot;he didn&#x27;t have the time&quot;. He was replaced by Katie Hopkins. The following year he featured as one of the &#x27;celebrity hijackers&#x27; in the UK TV series &quot;Big Brother: Celebrity Hijack&quot;, which was broadcast on E4. In his hijack, he encouraged the housemates to remove their clothes, daub themselves in paint and produce artwork using only their bodies and a bicycle.

About his contribution to culture, McLaren has said about himself: &quot;I have been called many things: a charlatan, a con man, or, most flatteringly, the culprit responsible for turning British popular culture into nothing more than a cheap marketing gimmick. This is my chance to prove that these accusations are true.&quot;

== Visual art and exhibitions ==
While still an art student, McLaren had the first public exhibition of his work in 1967, which was based on an environmental installation staged at the Kingly Street Art Gallery in central London, run by a group of artists including Keith Albarn.

In 1986, McLaren participated in the 6th Sydney Biennale at the invitation of Australian curator Nick Waterlow. Waterlow chose as the theme of the arts festival &quot;Origins Originality + Beyond&quot;, and McLaren&#x27;s involvement was based around his appropriation of Édouard Manet&#x27;s &quot;Le Déjeuner sur l&#x27;herbe&quot; for the cover of Bow Wow Wow&#x27;s second album.

In 1988, McLaren&#x27;s work across activism, art, design, fashion and music was the subject of the exhibition &quot;Impresario: Malcolm McLaren and the British New Wave&quot; at New York&#x27;s New Museum Of Contemporary Art.

The 1996 London exhibition &quot;I Groaned With Pain&quot; presented the fashion designs McLaren created with Vivienne Westwood. In an accompanying video interview by curators Paul Stolper and Andrew Wilson, McLaren declared of the clothing, &quot;I don&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s art. It might be bigger than art. Art has been defined today as not much more than a commodity, and I don&#x27;t think these things are. They remain, even now, set up in frames, as artefacts, enigmatic.&#x27;

In the last decade or so of his life, McLaren returned formally to the visual arts. In 1999, an installation created by McLaren was shown as part of the Bonnefanten&#x27;s 1999 exhibit &quot;Smaak – On Taste&quot; in Maastricht. In 2005, this formed the basis of the exhibition &quot;Casino of Authenticity and Karaoke&quot; at the Zentrum für Kunst und Medientechnologie (Center for Arts and Media Karlsruhe) in Karlsruhe, Germany.

In 2008, New York City public arts group Creative Time premiered nine pieces of McLaren&#x27;s 21-part sound painting series &quot;Shallow&quot; via MTV&#x27;s massive HD screen in Times Square. The series, which was first shown at Art 39 Basel in June that year, was the first instalment of an ongoing public arts content partnership between Creative Time and MTV. The complete version of &quot;Shallow 1–21&quot; was given its full U.S. museum premiere in the Morris Gallery of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (PAFA), in Philadelphia, from 24 October 2009 until 3 January 2010.

In 2009, JRP Ringier published McLaren&#x27;s book &quot;Musical Painting&quot;, which featured contributions from other visual artists including Damien Hirst and Jim Lambie. In the afterword, publisher Lionel Bovier wrote, &quot;Malcolm McLaren is and has been an artist in the purest sense for his entire adult life.&quot;

At the time of his death, McLaren had recently finished a new film work entitled &quot;Paris: Capital Of The XXIst Century&quot;, which was first shown at the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art in Gateshead, UK.

In 2011, the U.S. performance-art biennial festival Performa instituted &quot;The Malcolm&quot;, an award for the most thought-provoking entry named after McLaren and designed by Marc Newson.

In 2013, The Costume Institute of the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art exhibition &quot;Punk: From Chaos To Couture&quot; included the section &quot;The Couturier Situationists&quot; dedicated to McLaren and Westwood.

=== Posthumous exhibitions ===
An exhibition about McLaren&#x27;s engagement in fashion was held as part of the Copenhagen International Fashion Fair in August 2014. &quot;Let It Rock: The Look of Music The Sound of Fashion&quot; was curated by Young Kim and Paul Gorman and included sections focusing on each of the six retail outlets McLaren operated with Vivienne Westwood. Original clothing, photographs and ephemera were loaned by the Malcolm McLaren Estate archive and such collectors as British fashion designer Kim Jones and musician Marco Pirroni. British fashion writer Charlie Porter praised the curation, writing on his blog: &quot;At the Malcolm McLaren show in Copenhagen, the hang of the garments is exceptional.&quot;

McLaren&#x27;s background in the visual arts as a student and practitioner was a major focus of the exhibition Art in Pop held at the contemporary art gallery Le Magasin, the Centre National d&#x27;Art Contemporain in Grenoble, France, from October 2014 to February 2015. &quot;The main central space is dedicated to Malcolm McLaren, who embodies more than anyone the breaking open of perceptions of what constitutes an artist,&quot; wrote Magasin&#x27;s Yves Aupetitallot in the exhibition introduction.

Aupetitallot curated Art in Pop with Paul Gorman, Young Kim and participating artists John Armleder and John Miller. The exhibition also included contributions from musicians Daniel Johnston, Don Van Vliet (Captain Beefheart), Genesis Breyer P-Orridge and Alan Vega as well as artists who have engaged with music such as Alix Lambert and Takuji Kogo.

The McLaren space at Art in Pop included original examples of fashion designs created with Westwood, including loans from Kim Jones, Marco Pirroni, anthropologist/writer Ted Polhemus and streetwear guru Hiroshi Fujiwara. Photography, ephemera and images from a 1969 student art show were displayed, as well as a painting from the mid-1980s entitled &quot;I Will Be So Bad&quot;. The exhibition also included a soundtrack of music made by McLaren, prompting Marie France to describe it as &quot;an invigorating exhibition not just to see but hear as well&quot;.

== Personal life ==
McLaren&#x27;s relationship with Vivienne Westwood ended in about 1980; their son is Joseph Corré. Subsequently, McLaren was romantically involved with Andrea Linz, who was studying fashion at Saint Martin&#x27;s School of Art. Linz had been a member of the German pop-disco act Chilly and went on to become a fashion designer and model. Their relationship ended when McLaren moved to Los Angeles in 1985.

In Los Angeles, McLaren became the partner of the model/actress Lauren Hutton and they lived together in Hollywood for several years. Hutton ended the relationship in the late 1980s.

McLaren was then engaged to the fashion agent Eugena Melián, with whom he lived in Los Angeles and Paris. They worked on a series of projects together; it was at Melián&#x27;s urging that McLaren recorded his 1994 album &quot;Paris&quot;.

Subsequently, McLaren briefly dated the architect Charlotte Skene-Catling Their relationship ended in the late 1990s when McLaren began a romance with Young Kim, an American woman he met at a party.

== Later life and death ==

McLaren met Young Kim at a party in Paris. She was 26 and he was 25 years older. She moved in with him in 2002, and they lived together in Paris and New York. Kim was his girlfriend for the last 12 years of his life. She is the sole executor and heir of his estate.

He was diagnosed with peritoneal mesothelioma in October 2009, and died of the disease on 8 April 2010 in a hospital in Switzerland. McLaren&#x27;s last words were said by his son Joseph Corré to have been &quot;Free Leonard Peltier&quot;.

Tributes poured in from friends, associates and fans – including John Lydon, who had been at odds with McLaren since the demise of the Sex Pistols. &quot;For me, Malc was always entertaining, and I hope you remember that. Above all else, he was an entertainer and I will miss him, and so should you,&quot; he said in a statement as Johnny Rotten. Steve Jones issued a statement: &quot;I had a soft spot for Malcolm. I have known him since I was 17 before the Pistols formed. I used to drive him around in Vivienne Westwood&#x27;s car, to the tailors in London. Malcolm was the Brian Epstein of punk - without him, it wouldn&#x27;t have happened the way it did. I stayed friends with him throughout the years, despite some of our differences. My fondest memory of Malcolm, and I loved the guy, was his birthday present to me when I turned 21 - he got me a hooker and some heroin.&quot;

In a coffin sprayed with the slogan &quot;Too Fast To Live Too Young To Die&quot;, McLaren&#x27;s funeral was attended by Westwood, Sex Pistols bandmates Paul Cook and Glen Matlock, and celebrities such as Bob Geldof, Tracey Emin and Adam Ant. The funeral was held at One Marylebone, a deconsecrated church in central London.

Bob Geldof later told John Lydon that, at the funeral, &quot;there was a huge row between Vivienne [Westwood] and Bernie Rhodes. I mean, the man&#x27;s dead – what are you people doing?&quot;. Lydon recalled, &quot;And hearing this and the way Bob told it – so Irish and brilliant, so full of humour – I felt really, really sorry for Malcolm at that point. That these sods couldn&#x27;t even let him die in peace. They were out for their own little angles.&quot;

McLaren&#x27;s body was buried in Highgate Cemetery, North London, to the strains of the Sid Vicious version of &quot;My Way&quot;.

In 2012, probate was granted to Young Kim by McLaren&#x27;s will, which excluded his son Joe Corré from the inheritance.

In April 2013, a headstone was placed on McLaren&#x27;s grave featuring the slogan &quot;Better a spectacular failure, than a benign success&quot;, a paraphrasing of McLaren&#x27;s claim that the best advice he received came from an art-school teacher was &quot;It is better to be a flamboyant failure than any kind of benign success.&quot;

== TV and radio documentaries about McLaren ==

&quot;The South Bank Show: Malcolm McLaren&quot; was first broadcast on British regional channel London Weekend Television on 8 December 1984. Directed by Andy Harries and introduced by Melvyn Bragg (who noted that McLaren had been described as the &quot;Diaghilev of punk&quot;), the film hinged on McLaren recording tracks in America for his album Fans, and investigated his upbringing, art school years, and work with the New York Dolls, the Sex Pistols, Bow Wow Wow and others. Contributors included Sex Pistol Steve Jones, Boy George and Adam Ant.

&quot;Malcolm McLaren: Artful Dodger&quot; was screened by BBC Two in the wake of McLaren&#x27;s death on 24 April 2010. Produced and directed by Jeremy Marre and presented by Alan Yentob, the programme included archive footage and contributions from Joe Corré, Young Kim and others.

&quot;Malcolm McLaren: Spectacular Failure&quot; was an hour-long examination of his life and legacy first broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on 25 April 2020 to mark the 10th anniversary of McLaren&#x27;s death. Produced by Just Radio, with whom McLaren made several radio documentaries, and presented by McLaren&#x27;s biographer Paul Gorman, contributors included his friend and mayoral campaign manager Peter Culshaw and the British writer and cultural commentator Lou Stoppard, who said: &quot;Malcolm McLaren served as a precursor to the boundary-blurring, genre-defying creativity that is prevalent today. His mix of intense ambition, excitement and engagement with an almost nihilistic, bubbling apathy is something that young people today can very much relate to.&quot;

<text>Televangelism (from televangelist, a blend of &quot;television&quot; and &quot;evangelist&quot;) and occasionally termed radio evangelism or teleministry, denotes the utilization of media platforms, notably radio and television, for the marketing of religious messages, particularly Christianity.

Televangelists are either official or self-proclaimed ministers who devote a large portion of their ministry to television broadcasting. Some televangelists are also regular pastors or ministers in their own places of worship (often a megachurch), but the majority of their followers come from TV and radio audiences. Others do not have a conventional congregation, and work primarily through television. The term is also used derisively by critics as an insinuation of aggrandizement by such ministers.

Televangelism began as a uniquely American phenomenon, resulting from a largely deregulated media where access to television networks and cable TV is open to virtually anyone who can afford it, combined with a large Christian population that is able to provide the necessary funding. It became especially popular among Evangelical Protestant audiences, whether independent or organized around Christian denominations. However, the increasing globalisation of broadcasting has enabled some American televangelists to reach a wider audience through international broadcast networks, including some that are specifically Christian in nature.

Some countries have a more regulated media with either general restrictions on access or specific rules regarding religious broadcasting. In such countries, religious programming is typically produced by TV companies (sometimes as a regulatory or public service requirement) rather than private interest groups.

==Terminology==
The word &quot;televangelism&quot; is a portmanteau of television and evangelism and it was coined in 1958 as the title of a television miniseries by the Southern Baptist Convention. Jeffrey K. Hadden and Charles E. Swann have been credited with popularising the word in their 1981 survey &quot;Prime Time Preachers: The Rising Power of Televangelism&quot;. However, the term &quot;televangelist&quot; was employed by &quot;Time&quot; magazine already in 1952, when telegenic Roman Catholic Bishop Fulton Sheen was referred to as the &quot;first televangelist&quot;.

== History ==
===Radio===

Christianity has always emphasized preaching the gospel to the whole world, taking as inspiration the Great Commission. Historically, this was achieved by sending missionaries, beginning with the Dispersion of the Apostles, and later, after the invention of the printing press, included the distribution of Bibles and religious tracts. Some Christians realized that the rapid uptake of radio beginning in the 1920s, provided a powerful new tool for this task, and they were amongst the first producers of radio programming. Radio broadcasts were seen as a complementary activity to traditional missionaries, enabling vast numbers to be reached at relatively low cost, but also enabling Christianity to be preached in countries where this was illegal and missionaries were banned. The aim of Christian radio was to both convert people to Christianity and to provide teaching and support to believers. These activities continue today, particularly in the developing world. Shortwave radio stations with a Christian format broadcast worldwide, such as HCJB in Quito, Ecuador, Family Radio&#x27;s WYFR, and the Bible Broadcasting Network (BBN), among others.

One of the first ministers to use radio extensively was S. Parkes Cadman, beginning in 1923. In 1923, Calvary Baptist Church in New York City was the first church to operate its own radio station.&quot;Tell It From Calvary&quot; is a radio show that the church still produces weekly; it&#x27;s heard on WMCA AM570. By 1928, Cadman had a weekly Sunday afternoon radio broadcast on the NBC radio network, his powerful oratory reaching a nationwide audience of five million persons.

Aimee Semple McPherson was another pioneering tent-revivalist who soon turned to radio to reach a larger audience. Radio eventually gave her nationwide notoriety in the 1920s and 1930s, and she even built one of the earliest Pentecostal megachurches.

In the U.S., the Great Depression of the 1930s saw a resurgence of revival-tent preaching in the Midwest and South, as itinerant traveling preachers drove from town to town, living off donations. Several preachers began radio shows as a result of their popularity.

In the 1930s, a famous radio evangelist of the period was Roman Catholic priest Father Charles Coughlin, whose strongly anti-Communist and antisemitic radio programs reached millions of listeners. Other early Christian radio programs broadcast nationwide in the U.S. beginning in the 1920s–1930s, include (years of radio broadcast shown): Bob Jones, Sr. (1927–1962), Ralph W. Sockman (1928–1962), G. E. Lowman (1930–1965), &quot;Music and the Spoken Word&quot; (1929–present), &quot;The Lutheran Hour&quot; (1930–present), and Charles E. Fuller (1937–1968). &quot;Time&quot; magazine reported in 1946 that Rev. Ralph Sockman&#x27;s &quot;National Radio Pulpit&quot; on NBC received 4,000 letters weekly and Roman Catholic archbishop Fulton J. Sheen received between 3,000 and 6,000 letters weekly. The total radio audience for radio ministers in the U.S. that year was estimated to be 10 million listeners.

An association of American Evangelical Protestant religious broadcasters, the National Religious Broadcasters, was founded in 1944.

===Television===

Although television also began in the 1930s, it was not used for religious purposes until the early 1950s. Jack Wyrtzen and Percy Crawford switched to TV broadcasting in the Spring of 1949. Another television preacher of note was Fulton J. Sheen, who successfully switched to television in 1951 after two decades of popular radio broadcasts and whom &quot;Time&quot; called &quot;the first &#x27;televangelist&#x27;&quot;. Sheen would win numerous Emmy Awards for his program that ran from the early 1950s, until the late 1960s.

In 1951, producer Dick Ross and Baptist evangelist Billy Graham founded the film production company World Wide Pictures, which would make videos of his preaching and Christian films.
After years of radio broadcasting in 1952 Rex Humbard became the first to have a weekly church service broadcast on television. By 1980, the Rex Humbard programs spanned the globe across 695 stations in 91 languages and to date the largest coverage of any evangelistic program. Oral Roberts&#x27;s broadcast by 1957 reached 80% of the possible television audience through 135 of the possible 500 stations. In Uruguay, Channel 4 airs the Roman Catholic Church mass since 1961.

Christian Broadcasting Network, the first Christian channel, was founded in 1961, by Baptist Pastor Pat Robertson. Its show &quot;The 700 Club&quot;, is one of the oldest on the American television scene and was broadcast in 39 languages in 138 countries in 2016.

The 1960s and early 1970s, saw television replace radio as the primary home entertainment medium, but also corresponded with a further rise in Evangelical Christianity, particularly through the international television and radio ministry of Billy Graham. Many well-known televangelists began during this period, most notably Oral Roberts, Jimmy Swaggart, Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker, Jerry Falwell, Jesse Duplantis and Pat Robertson. Most developed their own media networks, news exposure, and political influence. In the 21st century, some televised church services continue to attract large audiences. In the US, there are Joel Osteen, Joyce Meyer and T. D. Jakes. In Nigeria, there are Enoch Adeboye and Chris Oyakhilome. Trinity Broadcasting Network is the world&#x27;s largest religious television network.

== Controversies and criticism ==
Televangelists frequently draw criticism from other Christian ministers. For example, preacher John MacArthur published a number of articles in December 2009 that were highly critical of some televangelists.

Similarly, Ole Anthony wrote very critically of televangelists in 1994.

A proportion of their methods and theology are held by some to be conflicting with Christian doctrine taught in long existing traditionalist congregations. Many televangelists are featured by &quot;discernment ministries&quot; run by other Christians that are concerned about what they perceive as departures from sound Christian doctrine.

* Many televangelists exist outside the structures of Christian denominations, meaning that they are not accountable to anyone.
* The financial practices of many televangelists are unclear. A 2003 survey by the &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; indicated that only one out of the 17 televangelists researched were members of the Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability.
* The prosperity gospel taught by many televangelists promises material, financial, physical, and spiritual success to believers, which can run counter to several aspects of Christian teaching that warn of suffering for following Christ and recommend surrendering one&#x27;s material possessions &quot;(see: Jesus and the rich young man)&quot;.
* Some televangelists have significant personal wealth and own large properties, luxury cars, and various transportation vehicles such as private aircraft or ministry aircraft. This is seen by critics to be contradictory to traditional Christian thinking.
* Televangelism requires substantial amounts of money to produce programs and purchase airtime on cable and satellite networks. Televangelists devote time to fundraising activities. Products such as books, CDs, DVDs, and trinkets are promoted to viewers.
* Televangelists claim to be reaching millions of people worldwide with the gospel and producing numerous converts to Christianity. However, such claims are difficult to verify independently and are often disputed.
* Several televangelists have been very active in the national or international political arena (e.g., Pat Robertson, Jerry Falwell, Jimmy Swaggart, John Hagee), and often espouse conservative politics on their programs. Such televangelists may occasionally arouse controversy by making remarks deemed offensive on their programs or elsewhere, or by endorsing partisan political candidates on donor-paid airtime, which runs afoul of the Johnson Amendment&#x27;s ban on tax-exempt organizations supporting or opposing candidates for political office.

===Senate probe===
In 2007, Senator Chuck Grassley opened a probe into the finances of six televangelists who preach a &quot;prosperity gospel&quot;. The probe investigated reports of lavish lifestyles by televangelists including fleets of Rolls-Royces, palatial mansions, private jets, and other expensive items purportedly paid for by television viewers who donate due to the ministries&#x27; encouragement of offerings. The six that were investigated are:

*Kenneth and Gloria Copeland of Kenneth Copeland Ministries of Newark, Texas;
*Creflo Dollar and Taffi Dollar of World Changers Church International and Creflo Dollar Ministries of College Park, Georgia;
*Benny Hinn of World Healing Center Church Inc. and Benny Hinn Ministries of Grapevine, Texas;
*Eddie L. Long of New Birth Missionary Baptist Church and Bishop Eddie Long Ministries of Lithonia, Georgia; &quot;DocuSeries – Sex Scandals and Religion&quot; did a 2011 investigative episode on his alleged sexual misconduct
*Joyce Meyer and David Meyer of Joyce Meyer Ministries of Fenton, Missouri and
*Randy White and ex-wife Paula White of the Without Walls International Church and Paula White Ministries of Tampa.

On January 6, 2011, Grassley released his review of the six ministries response to his inquiry. He called for a further congressional review of tax-exemption laws for religious groups.

== In Islam ==
In Islam, the related concept of &quot;dawah&quot;, which encourages Muslims to go and spread the religion to Non-Muslims similar to the Evangelical tradition of evangelizing, has also given rise to figures who are often described as &quot;Islamic televangelists&quot; who preach using Television and Internet videos like their Evangelical counterparts. Examples include Moez Masoud, Zakir Naik and Amr Khaled, amongst others. These figures may build on the longstanding &quot;da&#x27;i&quot; tradition but also draw inspiration from Christian televangelists. Similarly to Christian televangelists, critics have argued that some Islamic televangelists may be too political, especially those pandering to fundamental Islamism including the far-right. Critics also claim that many will make significant amounts of money from their work and therefore may not be motivated by spiritual or charitable causes.

Examples of well-known Islamic televangelist TV channels include Muslim Television Ahmadiyya, Islam Channel, ARY Qtv and Peace TV. Some of these channels, but not all, have come under scrutiny from national television or communications regulators such as Ofcom in the UK and the CRTC in Canada, with Ofcom having censured both Islam Channel and Peace TV in the past for biased coverage of political events, incitement to illegal acts including marital rape, and homophobia. The Islamic televangelist channel Peace TV is banned in India, Bangladesh, Canada, Sri Lanka, and the United Kingdom.

<text>Yothu Yindi (Yolngu for &quot;child and mother&quot;, pronounced , natively ) are an Australian musical group with Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal members, formed in 1986 as a merger of two bands formed in 1985 – a white rock group called the Swamp Jockeys (Todd Williams, Michael Wyatt, Cal Williams, Stuart Kellaway, Andrew Bellety), and an unnamed Aboriginal folk group consisting of Mandawuy Yunupingu, Witiyana Marika, and Milkayngu Mununggur. The Aboriginal members came from Yolngu homelands near Yirrkala on the Gove Peninsula in Northern Territory&#x27;s Arnhem Land. Founding members included Stuart Kellaway on bass guitar, Cal Williams on lead guitar, Andrew Belletty on drums, Witiyana Marika on manikay (traditional vocals), bilma (ironwood clapsticks) and dance, Milkayngu Mununggurr on yidaki, Geoffrey Gurrumul Yunupingu on keyboards, guitar, and percussion, past lead singer Mandawuy Yunupingu and present Yirrnga Yunupingu on vocals and guitar.

The band combines aspects of both musical cultures. Their sound varies from traditional Aboriginal songs to modern pop and rock songs, where they blended the typical instruments associated with pop/rock bands, such as guitars and drums, with the traditional yidaki (didgeridoo) and bilma (clap stick). They adapted traditional Yolngu dance performances to accompany their music. More broadly, they promoted mutual respect and understanding in the coming together of different cultures.

Yothu Yindi&#x27;s most widely known song, &quot;Treaty&quot;, peaked at No. 11 on the ARIA singles charts in 1991 and the related album &quot;Tribal Voice&quot; peaked at No. 4 on the ARIA albums charts.

The group established the Yothu Yindi Foundation in 1990 to promote Yolngu cultural development, including from 1999 producing the annual Garma Festival of Traditional Cultures and from May 2007 running the Dilthan Yolngunha (meaning &quot;Healing Place&quot;). Chairman of the foundation was Galarrwuy Yunupingu. He was Mandawuy&#x27;s older brother, a Yolngu clan leader and sometimes a member of Yothu Yindi on bilma and guitar. Galarrwuy had been named Australian of the Year in 1978 for his work for Aboriginal communities and Mandawuy was Australian of the Year for 1992 for his work with Yothu Yindi. In December 2012, the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) inducted the band into the ARIA Hall of Fame, as part of the ARIA Music Awards of 2012. In 2023, the band were inducted into the National Indigenous Music Awards Hall of Fame.

==Career==
===1986–1990: Early years===
Swamp Jockeys were formed in 1985 by &quot;balanda&quot; (European/non-Aboriginal people) Todd Williams songwriter and lead singer, Michael Wyatt, songwriter and lead singer, Andrew Belletty on drums, Stuart Kellaway on bass guitar and Cal Williams on lead guitar. On their tour of Arnhem Land, in Australia&#x27;s Northern Territory, they were supported by a Yolngu band composed of Witiyana Marika on &quot;manikay&quot; (traditional vocals), &quot;bilma&quot; (ironwood clapsticks) and dance, Milkayngu Mununggurr on &quot;yidaki&quot; (didgeridoo), Gurrumul &#x27;The Guru&#x27; Yunupingu on keyboards, guitar and percussion, and Bakamana Yunupingu on vocals and guitar. They united to form Yothu Yindi (pronounced ). &quot;Yothu yindi&quot; is a Yolngu &quot;matha&quot; (Yolngu language) kinship term for &quot;child and mother&quot;.

The band combines aspects of both musical cultures. Their sound varies from traditional Aboriginal songs to modern pop and rock songs in which they blend the typical instruments of pop/rock bands, such as guitars and drums, with the traditional yidaki and bilma. They have adapted traditional Yolngu dance performances to accompany their music. More broadly they promote mutual respect and understanding of different cultures. Michael Wyatt, from the Swamp Jockeys, went on to become Yothu Yindi&#x27;s pilot and with Stephen Johnson made Yothu Yindi&#x27;s multiple award winning music video clips. He was also stage manager on Australian tours and their tour to the New York&#x27;s World Music festival.

Bakamana Yunupingu was a tertiary student studying to become a teacher. He became principal at his own Yirrkala Community School, and touring by Yothu Yindi was restricted to school holidays in the band&#x27;s early years. In August 1988 they performed in Townsville, Queensland, at the South Pacific Festival of Arts. The next month they represented Australia in Seoul, South Korea at the Cultural Olympics. Bart Willoughby (ex-No Fixed Address, Coloured Stone) joined on drums in late 1988 and Yothu Yindi toured USA and Canada as support act to Midnight Oil. Upon their return to Australia, they were signed to Mushroom Records, and with Leszek Karski (ex-Supercharge) producing, recorded their debut single &quot;Mainstream&quot;, released in March 1989. It was followed by debut album &quot;Homeland Movement&quot; in May; a second single &quot;Djäpana (Sunset Dreaming)&quot; was released in August. Neither their singles nor album had any major chart success. Yothu Yindi toured with Neil Young in Australia, then head-lined in Papua New Guinea and Hong Kong. In 1990 they toured New Zealand with Tracy Chapman, and then performed in festivals in the UK. In 1990 five clans of the Yolngu formed the Yothu Yindi Foundation to promote Yulngu cultural development. Chairman of the foundation was Galarrwuy Yunupingu, Mandawuy&#x27;s older brother, a Yolngu clan leader and sometimes a member of Yothu Yindi on &quot;bilma&quot; and guitar. Galarrwuy had been named Australian of the Year in 1978 for his work for Aboriginal communities. Around this time, a relative of Bakamana who bore the same name died, and he therefore changed his first name to Mandawuy, in line with Yolngu tradition.

The band commissioned their friend and relative (married to Gurrumul&#x27;s sister), master yiḏaki-maker Djalu Gurruwiwi, to make their didgeridoos, which also brought his skills to the attention of the world.

===1991–1992: &quot;Treaty&quot; and &quot;Tribal Voice&quot;===
In 1988, as part of Bicentennial celebrations, Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke visited the Northern Territory for the Barunga festival where he was presented with a statement of Aboriginal political objectives by Galarrwuy Yunupingu and Wenten Rubuntja. Hawke responded to the Barunga Statement with a promise that a treaty would be concluded with Indigenous Australians by 1990. By 1991, Yothu Yindi were Hughie Benjamin on drums, Sophie Garrkali and Julie Gungunbuy as dancers, Kellaway, Marika, Mununggurr, Gurrumul Yunupingu, Makuma Yunupingu on &quot;yidaki&quot;, vocals, &quot;bilma&quot;, Mandawuy Yunupingu, Mangatjay Yunupingu as a dancer. Mandawuy, with his older brother Galarrwuy, wanted a song to highlight the lack of progress on the treaty between Aboriginal peoples and the federal government. Mandawuy recalls:

&quot;Treaty&quot; was written by Australian musician Paul Kelly and Yothu Yindi members Mandawuy Yunupingu, Kellaway, Williams, Gurrumul Yunupingu, Mununggurr and Marika. The initial release had little interest, but when Melbourne-based dance remixers Filthy Lucre&#x27;s Gavin Campbell and Robert Goodge adapted the song, their version peaked at No. 11 on the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) singles charts by September. The song contains lyrics in both English and in Yolngu &quot;matha&quot;. It was accompanied by a video showing band members performing vocals, music, and dance.

Success for the single was transferred to the related album &quot;Tribal Voice&quot; which peaked at No. 4 on the ARIA albums charts, The album, produced by Mark Moffatt for Mushroom Records, was released in September 1991. Mandawuy Yunupingu took leave of absence from his duties as principal to tour and promote the single and album. Other singles from the album were a re-released &quot;Djäpana (Sunset Dreaming)&quot; which peaked at No. 13 in 1992 and &quot;Tribal Voice&quot; which peaked at number 51.

At the 1992 ARIA Awards Yothu Yindi won awards for ARIA Award for Best Cover Art for &quot;Tribal Voice&quot; by Louise Beach and Mushroom Art; ARIA Award for Engineer of the Year for &quot;Maralitja&quot; (&quot;maralitja&quot; is Yolngu &quot;matha&quot; for crocodile man – one of Mandawuy&#x27;s tribal names), &quot;Dharpa&quot; (&quot;dharpa&quot; is tree), &quot;Treaty&quot;, &quot;Treaty (Filthy Lucre remix)&quot; and &quot;Tribal Voice&quot; by David Price, Ted Howard, Greg Henderson and Simon Polinski; ARIA Award for Best Indigenous Release for &quot;Tribal Voice&quot;; ARIA Award for Song of the Year and Single of the Year for &quot;Treaty. Both &quot;Treaty&quot; in 1992 and &quot;Djäpana (Sunset Dreaming)&quot; in 1993 charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Club Play singles charts, with &quot;Treaty&quot; peaking at No. 6, &quot;Tribal Voice&quot; peaked at No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top World Music Albums chart in 1992.

In October 1992, then Prime Minister Paul Keating&#x27;s government awarded Yothu Yindi with a $30,000 grant. The money was used to travel to New York, where they performed at the United Nations for the launch of International Year for the World&#x27;s Indigenous People. Mandawuy Yunupingu was named Australian of the Year by the Keating government on 26 January 1993. His older brother, Galarrwuy had been named Australian of the Year in 1978 for his work for Aboriginal communities.

In 2009 &#x27;Treaty&#x27; was added to the National Film and Sound Archive&#x27;s Sounds of Australia Registry.

===1993–2000: Continued success===
At the 1993 ARIA Awards, Yothu Yindi won &#x27;Best Video&#x27;, Burrundi Pictures Michael Wyatt and Stephen Johnson, directed by Stephen Maxwell Johnson, and &#x27;Best Indigenous Release&#x27; for &quot;Djäpana (Sunset Dreaming)&quot; and &#x27;Engineer of the Year&#x27; for Greg Henderson&#x27;s work on &quot;Djäpana&quot; and &quot;Tribal Voice&quot;.

Yothu Yindi&#x27;s third album &quot;Freedom&quot; was released in November 1993, the line-up included Mandawuy, Gurrumul, Makuna and Mangatjay Yunupingu, Marika, Williams, Kellaway, Benjamin and Munumggurr; and new members Banula Marika on vocals and dance, Bunimburr Marika on &quot;yidaki&quot;, Natalie Gillespie on vocals, Jodie Cockatoo Creed on vocals and clan leader Galarrwuy Yunupingu on &quot;bilma&quot; and vocals. After intense touring in 1994, Williams left Yothu Yindi and was replaced by Colin Simpson on guitar, they added Ben Hakalitz (ex-Not Drowning Waving) on drums and Baruka Tau-Matagu on keyboards. Gurrumul Yunupingu had left by 1995 to live full-time on Elcho Island, he later formed Saltwater Band to record three albums, and in 2008 released his self-titled solo album. Yothu Yindi&#x27;s fourth album &quot;Birrkuta&quot; (&quot;birrkuta&quot; means wild honey) was released in August 1996.

&quot;I Am Australian&quot; is a popular song written in 1987 by Dobe Newton of The Bushwackers and Bruce Woodley of The Seekers. It was released as a single in 1997 by trio Judith Durham of The Seekers, Russell Hitchcock from Air Supply and Yothu Yindi&#x27;s Mandawuy Yunupingu by EMI Australia and it peaked at No. 17 on the ARIA Singles Charts in June.

Yothu Yindi&#x27;s fifth album &quot;One Blood&quot; was released in 1999 and included &quot;Treaty &#x27;98&quot;. They sponsored the Yothu Yindi Foundation, which produces the annual Garma Festival of Traditional Cultures celebrating Yolngu culture from 1999, and their sixth album &quot;Garma&quot; was released in 2000, with Cal Williams returning on guitars. In 2000, Yothu Yindi performed at the closing ceremony of the Sydney Olympic Games.

On 9 August 2000, 30-year-old Betsy Yunupingu was kicked in the head. She subsequently died, Yothu Yindi band member Gavin Makuma Yunupingu was found guilty of &quot;committing a dangerous act causing death&quot; and in June 2002 he was sentenced to 15 months imprisonment at Berrimah Jail, Darwin. Gavin is the son of Galarrwuy and nephew of Mandawuy.

===2001–2020===
In May 2001 the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA), as part of its 75th-anniversary celebrations, named &quot;Treaty&quot; as one of the Top 30 Australian songs of all time. In 2003 Yothu Yindi toured through Northern Territory schools with Mandawuy Yunupingu, &quot;yidaki&quot; players Gapanbulu Yunupingu and Nicky Yunupingu, and Kellaway using songs, storytelling and open discussions to inspire and encourage some of Australia&#x27;s most vulnerable young people to attend school and stay healthy. The Yothu Yindi Foundation in May 2007 established the Dilthan Yolngunha (Healing Place) using traditional healing practices and mainstream medicines. On 23 July 2008 a 23-year-old woman was stabbed numerous times; &quot;yidaki&quot; player N. Yunupingu, who was described by Northern Territory police as the offender, was later found dead by hanging. N. Yunupingu was the nephew of both Galarrwuy and Mandawuy Yunupingu, and, as members of Yothu Yindi, they had just played a concert for Prime Minister Kevin Rudd some hours before the stabbing of the woman, who was admitted to hospital, and N. Yunupingu&#x27;s subsequent death.

In 2009, News.com.au reported that Yothu Yindi lead singer Mandawuy Yunupingu needed a kidney transplant. Yunupingu said he drank up to four cartons of alcohol a day. &quot;Alcohol was a big influence in my life. I didn&#x27;t know what harm it did to my body. Before I knew, it was too late,&quot; he said.

At the ARIA Music Awards of 2012, Yothu Yindi were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame, with Peter Garrett (then a former member of Midnight Oil) and Paul Kelly introducing the group.

ARIA Chairman and CEO of Sony Music Entertainment Australia and New Zealand, Denis Handlin said &quot;On behalf of the ARIA Board it is with great honour that we induct Yothu Yindi into the ARIA Hall of Fame. Yothu Yindi created a special place in the Nation&#x27;s heart through their passionate and ground breaking music. Their achievements remain a lasting heritage in both our community and overseas and we look forward to celebrating their induction at the ARIAs in is what is sure to be a magic moment&quot;. The group were joined by Garrett, Kelly, Jessica Mauboy and Dan Sultan to perform &quot;Treaty&quot; at the ceremony. In 2019 Double J&quot;s Dan Condon described this as one of &quot;7 great performances from the history of the ARIA Awards.&quot;

The &quot;best of&quot; compilation, &quot;Healing Stone (The Best of Yothu Yindi)&quot;, was released in November 2012 which included the new track &quot;Healing Stone&quot;, produced by Andrew Farriss of INXS.

On 2 June 2013 lead singer M. Yunupingu died of renal failure. In line with Yolngu cultural protocols, on 4 June 2013 the family requested that the first names of the deceased no longer be used until further notice.

In 2015 they collaborated with rock-reggae band East Journey on a project called The Genesis Project, which included an EP and a performance at the National Indigenous Music Awards 2015.

====Yothu Yindi &amp; The Treaty Project====
In 2017, inspired by the 25th anniversary remix of &quot;Treaty (Filthy Lucre remix)&quot;, some of the original members of Yothu Yindi, along with several new artists, created an electronica project entitled Yothu Yindi &amp; The Treaty Project (YYATTP). Longtime members Witiyana Marika, Malngay Yunupingu and Stuart Kellaway were joined by blues singer Yirrmal (Marika&#x27;s son), vocalists Yirrnga Yunupingu and Constantina Bush (aka Kamahi Djordon King), multi-instrumentalist Ania Reynolds (director of Circus Oz) and guitarist Megan Bernard, while the Filthy Lucre duo Nick Coleman and Gavin Campbell worked on mixing and production.

The group played on ABC Radio&#x27;s &quot;The Friday Revue&quot; and at the Homeground festival at the Sydney Opera House, which celebrates Indigenous culture (November 2017), and created a hip hop version of &quot;Treaty&quot; with Baker Boy. Inn January 2018 they were booked to play at the Enmore Theatre with The Herd. They also played Strawberry Fields Festival, Queenscliff Music Festival at the opening night of the Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games, continuing live performances into at least March 2019, including a tour to New Zealand, playing on Waitangi Day 2019 in Auckland.

The group have been described as a &quot;fluid collective&quot;, with other musicians quite often joining them on stage. Shane Howard, frontman of the band Goanna, has regularly played with them. They released the Yothu Yindi song &quot;Mabo&quot; for the first time as a single in April 2019.

===2021–present===
On 26 June 2021, Yothu Yindi played at the Yarrapay Festival, which was directed by Witiyana Marika, at Buku-Larrnggay Mulka Art Centre in Yirrkala, along with the Andrew Gurruwiwi Band, Yirrmal, and East Journey.

In August 2023, Yothu Yindi were inducted into the NIMAs (National Indigenous Music Awards) Hall of Fame for their trailblazing contribution to Indigenous music and the rights of First Nations people.

<text>Homeland Movement is the debut studio album by Australian rock band Yothu Yindi that was released in April 1989 on the Mushroom Records label. The album peaked at number 59 on the ARIA Chart in 1992.

==Background and release==
Following a tour of Australia and North America in late 1988, supporting Midnight Oil, the band signed with Mushroom Records and spent a day in Sydney recording a demo tape. Mushroom Records released the demo as the band&#x27;s debut album.

One side of the album comprised punchy politicised rock songs, such as &quot;Mainstream&quot;, whilst the other side concentrated on traditionally based songs like &quot;Djapana (Sunset Dreaming)&quot;, written by former teacher Mandawuy Yunupingu.

<doc id="149028" wikidata="Q7840323" url="?curid=149028" title="Tribal Voice">
<text>Tribal Voice is the second studio album by Yothu Yindi, released in September 1991 on the Mushroom Records label. The album peaked at number 4 on the ARIA Charts and was certified 2× Platinum.

At the 1992 ARIA Awards Yothu Yindi won Best Cover Art for &quot;Tribal Voice&quot; by Louise Beach and Mushroom Art with photography by Serge Thomann; Engineer of the Year for &quot;Maralitja&quot;, &quot;Dharpa&quot; and &quot;Tribal Voice&quot; by David Price, Ted Howard, Greg Henderson and Simon Polinski; Best Indigenous Release for &quot;Tribal Voice&quot;; Song of the Year and Single for the Year for &quot;Treaty&quot;.

The album did not receive a domestic vinyl release until 2018, however it was released on vinyl in Europe in 1992.

==Reception==

AllMusic&#x27;s reviewer, Jonathon Lewis commented &quot;the traditional songs are stunning, and Mandawuy Yunupingu&#x27;s voice is suited perfectly to these, but it is the rock tracks that are the weak links in this disc. Yunupingu is not a particularly good pop singer, and the music is sometimes insipid&quot; but went on to say &quot;despite this, &quot;Tribal Voice&quot; is a fine example of both traditional and modern Aboriginal music.&quot;

<doc id="149031" wikidata="Q1070623" url="?curid=149031" title="Victorian fashion">
<text>Victorian fashion consists of the various fashions and trends in British culture that emerged and developed in the United Kingdom and the British Empire throughout the Victorian era, roughly from the 1830s through the 1890s. The period saw many changes in fashion, including changes in styles, fashion technology and the methods of distribution. Various movement in architecture, literature, and the decorative and visual arts as well as a changing perception of gender roles also influenced fashion.

Under Queen Victoria&#x27;s reign, England enjoyed a period of growth along with technological advancement. Mass production of sewing machines in the 1850s as well as the advent of synthetic dyes introduced major changes in fashion. Clothing could be made more quickly and cheaply. Advancement in printing and proliferation of fashion magazines allowed the masses to participate in the evolving trends of high fashion, opening the market of mass consumption and advertising. By 1905, clothing was increasingly factory made and often sold in large, fixed-price department stores, spurring a new age of consumerism with the rising middle class who benefited from the industrial revolution.

==Women&#x27;s fashions==
During the Victorian Era, women generally worked in the private, domestic sphere. Unlike in earlier centuries when women would often help their husbands and brothers in family businesses and in labour, during the nineteenth century, gender roles became more defined. The requirement for farm labourers was no longer in such a high demand after the Industrial Revolution, and women were more likely to perform domestic work or, if married, give up work entirely. Dress reflected this new, increasingly sedentary lifestyle, and was not intended to be utilitarian.

Clothes were seen as an expression of women&#x27;s place in society, hence were differentiated in terms of social class. Upper-class women, who did not need to work, often wore a tightly laced corset over a bodice or chemisette, and paired them with a skirt adorned with numerous embroideries and trims; over layers of petticoats. Middle-class women exhibited similar dress styles; however, the decorations were not as extravagant. The layering of these garments make them very heavy. Corsets were also stiff and restricted movement. Although the clothes were not comfortable, the type of fabrics and the numerous layers were worn as a symbol of wealth.
* Neck-line: Bertha is the low shoulder neck-line worn by women during the Victorian Era. The cut exposed a woman&#x27;s shoulders and it sometimes was trimmed over with a three to six-inch deep lace flounce, or the bodice has neckline draped with several horizontal bands of fabric pleats. However, the exposure of neck-line was only restricted to the upper and middle class, working-class women during the time period were not allowed to reveal so much flesh.The décolleté style made shawls to become an essential feature of dresses. Corsets lost their shoulder straps, and fashion was to produce two bodices, one closed décolletage for day and one décolleté for evening.
* Boning: Corsets were used in women&#x27;s gowns for emphasizing the small waist of the female body. They function as an undergarment which can be adjusted to bind tightly around the waist, hold and train a person&#x27;s waistline, so to slim and conform it to a fashionable silhouette. It also helped stop the bodice from horizontal creasing. With the corset, a very small tight fitting waist would be shown.Corsets have been blamed for causing many diseases because of tight lacing, but the practice was less commonplace than generally thought today (Effects of tightlacing on the body).

* Sleeves: Sleeves were tightly fit during the early Victorian era. It matched with the tight fit women&#x27;s small waist in the design, and the shoulder sleeve seamline was drooped more to show a tighter fit on the arm. This eventually limited women&#x27;s movements with the sleeves.However, as crinolines started to develop in fashion, sleeves turned to be like large bells which gave the dress a heavier volume. Engageantes, which were usually made of lace, linen, or lawn, with cambric and broderie anglaise, were worn under the sleeves. They were easy to remove, launder and restitch into position, so to act as false sleeves, which was tacked to the elbow-length sleeves during the time. They commonly appear under the bell-shaped sleeves of day dresses.
* Silhouette: Silhouette changed over time supported by the evolution of the undergarment. In earlier days, wide skirts were supported by fabrics like linen which used horsehair in the weave. Crinolines were used to give skirts a beehive shape, with at least six layers petticoats worn under the skirt, which could weigh as much as fourteen pounds. Later, the cage crinoline was developed. Women were freed from the heavy petticoats, and were able to move their legs freely beneath the cage. Silhouette later began to emphasise a slope toward the back of the skirt. Polonaise style was introduced where fullness bunched up at the back of the skirt. Crinolines and cages also started to disappear with it being more dangerous to working-class women. Tournures or bustles were developed.

Victorian-era cosmetics were typically minimal, as makeup was associated with promiscuity. Many cosmetics contained toxic or caustic ingredients like lead, mercury, ammonia, and arsenic.

=== 1830s dress style ===
During the start of Queen Victoria&#x27;s reign in 1837, the ideal shape of the Victorian woman was a long slim torso emphasised by wide hips. To achieve a low and slim waist, corsets were tightly laced and extended over the abdomen and down towards the hips. A chemise was commonly worn under the corset, and cut relatively low in order to prevent exposure. Over the corset, was the tight-fitting bodice featuring a low waistline. Along with the bodice was a long skirt, featuring layers of horsehair petticoats worn underneath to create fullness; while placing emphasis on the small waist. To contrast the narrow waist, low and straight necklines were thus used.

=== 1840s dress style ===

In the 1840s, collapsed sleeves, low necklines, elongated V-shaped bodices, and fuller skirts characterised the dress styles of women.

At the start of the decade, the sides of bodices stopped at the natural waistline, and met at a point in the front. In accordance with the heavily boned corset and seam lines on the bodice as well, the popular low and narrow waist was thus accentuated.

Sleeves of bodices were tight at the top, because of the , but expanded around the area between the elbow and before the wrist. It was also initially placed below the shoulder, however; this restricted the movements of the arm.

As a result, the middle of the decade saw sleeves flaring out from the elbow into a funnel shape; requiring undersleeves to be worn in order to cover the lower arms.

Skirts lengthened, while widths increased due to the introduction of the horsehair crinoline in 1847; becoming a status symbol of wealth.

Extra layers of flounces and petticoats, also further emphasised the fullness of these wide skirts. In compliance with the narrow waist though, skirts were therefore attached to bodices using very tight organ pleats secured at each fold. This served as a decorative element for a relatively plain skirt. The 1840s style was perceived as conservative and &quot;Gothic&quot; compared to the flamboyance of the 1830s.

=== 1850s dress style ===


A similar silhouette remained in the 1850s, while certain elements of garments changed. Necklines of day dresses dropped even lower into a V-shape, causing a need to cover the bust area with a chemisette. In contrast, evening dresses featured a Bertha, which completely exposed the shoulder area instead. Bodices began to extend over the hips, while the sleeves opened further and increased in fullness. The volume and width of the skirt continued to increase, especially during 1853, when rows of flounces were added.

Nevertheless, in 1856, skirts expanded even further; creating a dome shape, due to the invention of the first artificial cage crinoline. The purpose of the crinoline was to create an artificial hourglass silhouette by accentuating the hips, and fashioning an illusion of a small waist; along with the corset. The cage crinoline was constructed by joining thin metal strips together to form a circular structure that could solely support the large width of the skirt. This was made possible by technology which allowed iron to be turned into steel, which could then be drawn into fine wires. Although often ridiculed by journalists and cartoonists of the time as the crinoline swelled in size, this innovation freed women from the heavy weight of petticoats and was a much more hygienic option.

Meanwhile, the invention of synthetic dyes added new colours to garments and women experimented with gaudy and bright colours. Technological innovation of 1860s provided women with freedom and choices.

=== 1860s dress style ===


During the early and middle 1860s, crinolines began decreasing in size at the top, while retaining their amplitude at the bottom. In contrast, the shape of the crinoline became flatter in the front and more voluminous behind, as it moved towards the back since skirts consisted of trains now. Bodices on the other hand, ended at the natural waistline, had wide pagoda sleeves, and included high necklines and collars for day dresses; low necklines for evening dresses. However, in 1868, the female silhouette had slimmed down as the crinoline was replaced by the bustle, and the supporting flounce overtook the role of determining the silhouette. Skirt widths diminished even further, while fullness and length remained at the back. In order to emphasise the back, the train was gathered together to form soft folds and draperies

=== 1870s dress style ===


The trend for broad skirts slowly disappeared during the 1870s, as women started to prefer an even slimmer silhouette. Bodices remained at the natural waistline, necklines varied, while sleeves began under the shoulder line. An overskirt was commonly worn over the bodice, and secured into a large bow behind. Over time though, the overskirt shortened into a detached basque, resulting in an elongation of the bodice over the hips. As the bodices grew longer in 1873, the polonaise was thus introduced into the Victorian dress styles. A polonaise is a garment featuring both an overskirt and bodice together. The tournure was also introduced, and along with the polonaise, it created an illusion of an exaggerated rear end.

By 1874, skirts began to taper in the front and were adorned with trimmings, while sleeves tightened around the wrist area. Towards 1875 to 1876, bodices featured long but even tighter laced waists, and converged at a sharp point in front. Bustles lengthened and slipped even lower, causing the fullness of the skirt to further diminish. Extra fabric was gathered together behind in pleats, thus creating a narrower but longer tiered, draped train too. Due to the longer trains, petticoats had to be worn underneath in order to keep the dress clean.

However, when 1877 approached, dresses moulded to fit the figure, as increasing slimmer silhouettes were favoured. This was allowed by the invention of the cuirass bodice which functions like a corset, but extends downwards to the hips and upper thighs. Although dress styles took on a more natural form, the narrowness of the skirt limited the wearer in regards to walking.

=== 1880s dress style ===

The early 1880s was a period of stylistic confusion. On one hand, there is the over-ornamented silhouette with contrasting texture and frivolous accessories. On the other hand, the growing popularity of tailoring gave rise to an alternative, severe style. Some credited the change in silhouette to the Victorian dress reform, which consisted of a few movements including the Aesthetic Costume Movement and the Rational Dress Movement in the mid-to-late Victorian Era advocating natural silhouette, lightweight underwear, and rejecting tightlacing. However, these movements did not gain widespread support. Others noted the growth in cycling and tennis as acceptable feminine pursuits that demanded a greater ease of movement in women&#x27;s clothing. Still others argued that the growing popularity of tailored semi-masculine suits was simply a fashionable style, and indicated neither advanced views nor the need for practical clothes. Nonetheless, the diversification in options and adoption of what was considered menswear at that time coincided with growing power and social status of women towards the late-Victorian period.

The bustle made a re-appearance in 1883, and it featured a further exaggerated horizontal protrusion at the back. Due to the additional fullness, drapery moved towards the sides or front panel of the skirt instead. Any drapery at the back was lifted up into poufs. Bodices on the other hand, shortened and ended above the hips. Yet the style remained tailored, but was more structured.

However, by 1886, the silhouette transformed back to a slimmer figure again. Sleeves of bodices were thinner and tighter, while necklines became higher again. Furthermore, an even further tailored-look began to develop until it improved in the 1890s.

=== 1890s dress style ===
By 1890, the crinoline and bustle was fully abandoned, and skirts flared away naturally from the wearer&#x27;s tiny waist. It evolved into a bell shape, and were made to fit tighter around the hip area. Necklines were high, while sleeves of bodices initially peaked at the shoulders, but increased in size during 1894. Although the large sleeves required cushions to secure them in place, it narrowed down towards the end of the decade. Women thus adopted the style of the tailored jacket, which improved their posture and confidence, while reflecting the standards of early female liberation.

==Hats==

Hats were crucial to a respectable appearance for both men and women. To go bareheaded was simply not proper. The top hat, for example, was standard formal wear for upper- and middle-class men. For women, the styles of hats changed over time and were designed to match their outfits.

During the early Victorian decades, voluminous skirts held up with crinolines, and then hoop skirts, were the focal point of the silhouette. To enhance the style without distracting from it, hats were modest in size and design, straw and fabric bonnets being the popular choice. Poke bonnets, which had been worn during the late Regency period, had high, small crowns and brims that grew larger until the 1830s, when the face of a woman wearing a poke bonnet could only be seen directly from the front. They had rounded brims, echoing the rounded form of the bell-shaped hoop skirts.

The silhouette changed once again as the Victorian era drew to a close. The shape was essentially an inverted triangle, with a wide-brimmed hat on top, a full upper body with puffed sleeves, no bustle, and a skirt that narrowed at the ankles (the hobble skirt was a fad shortly after the end of the Victorian era). The enormous wide-brimmed hats were covered with elaborate creations of silk flowers, ribbons, and above all, exotic plumes; hats sometimes included entire exotic birds that had been stuffed. Many of these plumes came from birds in the Florida everglades, which were nearly made entirely extinct by overhunting. By 1899, early environmentalists like Adeline Knapp were engaged in efforts to curtail the hunting for plumes. By 1900, more than five million birds a year were being slaughtered, and nearly 95 per cent of Florida&#x27;s shore birds had been killed by plume hunters.

=== Shoes ===
The women&#x27;s shoes of the early Victorian period were narrow and heelless, in black or white satin. By 1850s and 1860s, they were slightly broader with a low heel and made of leather or cloth. Ankle-length laced or buttoned boots were also popular. From the 1870s to the twentieth century, heels grew higher and toes more pointed. Low-cut pumps were worn for the evening.

== Men&#x27;s fashion ==

During the 1840s, men wore tight-fitting, calf length frock coats and a waistcoat or vest. The vests were single- or double-breasted, with shawl or notched collars, and might be finished in double points at the lowered waist. For more formal occasions, a cutaway morning coat was worn with light trousers during the daytime, and a dark tail coat and trousers was worn in the evening. Shirts were made of linen or cotton with low collars, occasionally turned down, and were worn with wide cravats or neck ties. Trousers had fly fronts, and breeches were used for formal functions and when horseback riding. Men wore top hats, with wide brims in sunny weather.

During the 1850s, men started wearing shirts with high upstanding or turnover collars and four-in-hand neckties tied in a bow, or tied in a knot with the pointed ends sticking out like &quot;wings&quot;. The upper-class continued to wear top hats, and bowler hats were worn by the working class.

In the 1860s, men started wearing wider neckties that were tied in a bow or looped into a loose knot and fastened with a stickpin. Frock coats were shortened to knee-length and were worn for business, while the mid-thigh length sack coat slowly displaced the frock coat for less-formal occasions. Top hats briefly became the very tall &quot;stovepipe&quot; shape, but a variety of other hat shapes were popular.

During the 1870s, three-piece suits grew in popularity along with patterned fabrics for shirts. Neckties were the four-in-hand and, later, the Ascot ties. A narrow ribbon tie was an alternative for tropical climates, especially in the Americas. Both frock coats and sack coats became shorter. Flat straw boaters were worn when boating.

During the 1880s, formal evening dress remained a dark tail coat and trousers with a dark waistcoat, a white bow tie, and a shirt with a winged collar. In mid-decade, the dinner jacket or tuxedo, was used in more relaxed formal occasions. The Norfolk jacket and tweed or woolen breeches were used for rugged outdoor pursuits such as shooting. Knee-length topcoats, often with contrasting velvet or fur collars, and calf-length overcoats were worn in winter. Men&#x27;s shoes had higher heels and a narrow toe.

Starting from the 1890s, the blazer was introduced, and was worn for sports, sailing, and other casual activities.

Throughout much of the Victorian era most men wore fairly short hair. This was often accompanied by various forms of facial hair including moustaches, side-burns, and full beards. A clean-shaven face did not come back into fashion until the end of the 1880s and early 1890s.

Distinguishing what men really wore from what was marketed to them in periodicals and advertisements is difficult, as reliable records do not exist.

In Britain, black is the colour traditionally associated with mourning for the dead. The customs and etiquette expected of men, and especially women, were rigid during much of the Victorian era. The expectations depended on a complex hierarchy of close or distant relationship with the deceased. The closer the relationship, the longer the mourning period and the wearing of black. The wearing of full black was known as First Mourning, which had its own expected attire, including fabrics, and an expected duration of 4 to 18 months. Following the initial period of First Mourning, the mourner would progress to Second Mourning, a transition period of wearing less black, which was followed by Ordinary Mourning, and then Half-mourning. Some of these stages of mourning were shortened or skipped completely if the mourner&#x27;s relationship to the deceased was more distant. Half-mourning was a transition period when black was replaced by acceptable colours such as lavender and mauve, possibly considered acceptable transition colours because of the tradition of Church of England (and Catholic) clergy wearing lavender or mauve stoles for funeral services, to represent the Passion of Christ.

The mourning dress on the right was worn by Queen Victoria, &quot;it shows the traditional touches of mourning attire, which she wore from the death of her husband, Prince Albert (1819–1861), until her own death.&quot;

=== Norms for mourning===

&quot;Manners and Rules of Good Society, or, Solecisms to be Avoided&quot; (London, Frederick Warne &amp; Co., 1887) gives clear instructions, such as the following:

The complexity of these etiquette rules extends to specific mourning periods and attire for siblings, step-parents, aunts and uncles distinguished by blood and by marriage, nieces, nephews, first and second cousins, children, infants, and &quot;connections&quot; (who were entitled to ordinary mourning for a period of &quot;1–3 weeks, depending on level of intimacy&quot;). Men were expected to wear mourning black to a lesser extent than women, and for a shorter mourning period. After the mid-19th century, men would wear a black hatband and black suit, but for only half the prescribed period of mourning expected of women. Widowers were expected to mourn for a mere three months, whereas the proper mourning period expected for widows was up to four years. Women who mourned in black for longer periods were accorded great respect in public for their devotion to the departed, the most prominent example being Queen Victoria herself.

Women with lesser financial means tried to keep up with the example being set by the middle and upper classes by dyeing their daily dress. Dyers made most of their income during the Victorian period by dyeing clothes black for mourning.

== Technological advancement ==
Technological advancements not only influenced the economy but brought a major change in the fashion styles worn by men and women. As the Victorian era was based on the principles of gender, race and class. Much advancement was in favor of the upper class as they were the ones who could afford the latest technology and change their fashion styles accordingly. In 1830s there was introduction of horse hair crinoline that became a symbol of status and wealth as only the upper-class women could wear it. In 1850s there were more fashion technological advancements hence 1850s could rightly be called a revolution in the Victorian fashion industry such as the innovation of artificial cage crinoline that gave women an artificial hourglass silhouette this meant that women did not have to wear layers of petticoats anymore to achieve illusion of wide hips and it was also hygienic. Synthetic dyes were also introduced that added new bright colours to garments. These technological advancement gave women freedom and choices. In 1855&#x27;s &quot;Haute couture&quot; was introduced as tailoring became more mainstream in years to follow.

Charles Frederick Worth, a prominent English designer, became popular amongst the upper class though its city of destiny always is Paris. Haute couture became popular at the same time when sewing machines were invented. Hand sewn techniques arose and were a distinction in compared to the old ways of tailoring. Princess Eugenie of France wore the Englishman dressmaker, Charles Frederick Worth&#x27;s couture and he instantly became famous in France though he had just arrived in Paris a few years ago. In 1855, Queen Victoria and Prince Albert of Britain welcomed Napoleon III and Eugenie of France to a full state visit to England. Eugenie was considered a fashion icon in France. She and Queen Victoria became instant friends. Queen Victoria, who had been the fashion icon for European high fashion, was inspired by Eugenie&#x27;s style and the fashions she wore. Later Queen Victoria also appointed Charles Frederick Worth as her dress maker and he became a prominent designer amongst the European upper class. Charles Frederick Worth is known as the father of the haute couture as later the concept of labels were also invented in the late 19th century as custom, made to fit tailoring became mainstream.

By the 1860s, when Europe was all about made-to-fit tailoring, crinolines were considered impractical. In the 1870s, women preferred more slimmer silhouettes, hence bodices grew longer and the polonaise, a skirt and bodice made together, was introduced. In 1870s the Cuirass Bodice, a piece of armour that covers the torso and functions like a corset, was invented. Towards the end of Victoria&#x27;s reign, dresses were flared naturally as crinolines were rejected by middle-class women. Designers such as Charles Frederick Worth were also against them. All these inventions and changes in fashion led to women&#x27;s liberation as tailored looks improved posture and were more practical.

== Home decor ==
Home decor started spare, veered into the elaborately draped and decorated style we today regard as Victorian, then embraced the retro-chic of William Morris as well as pseudo-Japonaiserie.

== Contemporary stereotypes ==

=== Modesty ===


Many myths and exaggerations about the period persist to the modern day. Examples include the idea of men&#x27;s clothing is seen as formal and stiff, women&#x27;s as elaborate and over-done; clothing covered the entire body, and even the glimpse of an ankle was scandalous. Critics contend that corsets constricted women&#x27;s bodies and women&#x27;s lives. Homes are described as gloomy, dark, cluttered with massive and over-ornate furniture and proliferating bric-a-brac. Myth has it that even piano legs were scandalous, and covered with tiny pantalettes.

In truth, men&#x27;s formal clothing may have been less colourful than it was in the previous century, but brilliant waistcoats and cummerbunds provided a touch of colour, and smoking jackets and dressing gowns were often of rich Oriental brocades. This phenomenon was the result of the growing textile manufacturing sector, developing mass production processes, and increasing attempts to market fashion to men. Corsets stressed a woman&#x27;s sexuality, exaggerating hips and bust by contrast with a tiny waist. Women&#x27;s evening gowns bared the shoulders and the tops of the breasts. The jersey dresses of the 1880s may have covered the body, but the stretchy novel fabric fit the body like a glove.

Home furnishing was not necessarily ornate or overstuffed. However, those who could afford lavish draperies and expensive ornaments, and wanted to display their wealth, would often do so. Since the Victorian era was one of increased social mobility, there were ever more &quot;nouveaux riches&quot; making a rich show.

The items used in decoration may also have been darker and heavier than those used today, simply as a matter of practicality. London was noisy and its air was full of soot from countless coal fires. Hence those who could afford it draped their windows in heavy, sound-muffling curtains, and chose colours that didn&#x27;t show soot quickly. When all washing was done by hand, curtains were not washed as frequently as they might be today.

There is no actual evidence that piano legs were considered scandalous. Pianos and tables were often draped with shawls or cloths—but if the shawls hid anything, it was the cheapness of the furniture. There are references to lower-middle-class families covering up their pine tables rather than show that they couldn&#x27;t afford mahogany. The piano leg story seems to have originated in the 1839 book, &quot;A Diary in America&quot; written by Captain Frederick Marryat, as a satirical comment on American prissiness.

Victorian manners may have been as strict as imagined—on the surface. One simply did not speak publicly about sex, childbirth, and such matters, at least in the respectable middle and upper classes. However, as is well known, discretion covered a multitude of sins. Prostitution flourished. Upper-class men and women indulged in adulterous liaisons.

<doc id="149034" wikidata="Q3044790" url="?curid=149034" title="Department for Protection and Security">
<text>The Department for Protection and Security (DPS) () is the security branch of the National Rally (RN) political party of France (formerly the &quot;National Front&quot;), which depends directly on the RN&#x27;s president and is led by Eric Staelens . , it consists of 1,500 members.

==Mission==

The mission of the DPS is providing physical protection of the leaders of National Rally and the monitoring of events or meetings of the party. One feature of DPS compared to other political parties&#x27; security services is its quasi-military character, both in the origin of many of its members (former military, police or security guards) and in its equipment consisting of helmets and uniforms similar to those worn by the mobile brigades of law enforcement. There is a fairly strong tradition of red berets (Paratroops) and Green Berets (Foreign Legion). In 2022, the DPS changed their military style to a more formal one with suits, but still maintaining their mission of protecting party leaders, especially Le Pen.

== 1998 Parliamentary Commission on the acts of the DPS ==

In 1998, a Parliamentary Commission, led by Socialist MP Bernard Grasset (Green MP Noël Mamère and conservative MP Patrick Devedjian were also part of it), was created to investigate its acts, after several violent incidents during demonstrations and other occasions. The report was published on 3 June 1999, and pinpointed several cases of DPS member checking identity card of demonstrators instead of the police. It also pinpointed links with the &quot;Groupe Union Défense&quot; (GUD), former OAS members, mercenaries and private military contractors. The Parliamentary commission declared that the DPS should have been dissolved end of 1996, after the Montceau-les-Mines affair on 25 October 1996, when a DPS unit acted like an ordinary police order force, alike to the &quot;C.R.S.&quot; anti-riot units. After the creation of the &quot;Mouvement National Républicain&quot; (MNR) by Bruno Mégret, an offshoot from the RN, the DPS itself also split into two organizations, the DPS on one side and the DPA (&quot;Département Protection Assistance&quot;) on the other side.

A former member of the DPS has given a long interview to daily &quot;Libération&quot;. Using the pseudonym &quot;Dominique&quot;, he explained that the DPS has special &quot;unofficial&quot; intervention squads made up of former paratroopers and Foreign Legionnaires, veterans of French interventions in Chad, Lebanon, and the Central African Republic. Some members of the DPS were present in covert operations in Zaire (1997 and 2001), Madagascar (in 2002, Didier Ratsiraka called for some mercenaries to resolve the political crisis ), Ivory Coast (2001–2003).

== Bernard Courcelle&#x27;s leadership until Bruno Mégret&#x27;s scission ==

DPS is equipped with helmets and shields, gas masks, tear gas launchers, guns that fire rubber bullets, bulletproof vests, clubs, and gloves with lead weights. DPS is alleged to have compiled computerized lists of journalists and anti-fascist activists with their names, addresses, and photos. They engage in punitive actions against their opponents but have, Dominique said, excellent relations with the police, including the police commissioners. They are organized in terms of military ranks such as colonel and captain. According to Liberation, the DPS now has 3,000 members. Since 1993, the group has been commanded by Bernard Courcelle, who claims, &quot;We only defend ourselves. We never attack the meetings of other groups.&quot; According to &quot;Reporters Sans Frontières&quot;, the DPS has records on journalists who follow the National Rally&#x27;s activities and, on several occasions, was responsible for the beating up of reporters. After Bruno Mégret&#x27;s split, Bernard Courcelle followed him with 1,700 members from the DPS, and Jean-Marie Le Pen named Marc Bellier to fill his place, and then Jean-Pierre Chabrut

In 1980, Bernard Courcelle was a member, along with Bruno Gollnisch, of the &quot;Direction de la Protection de la Sécurité et de la Défense&quot; (DPSD), an official Ministry of Defence organization in charge of recruiting mercenaries and informing on weapons traffic. The DPSD allegedly has or had ties, between the two wars, with the terrorist group &quot;La Cagoule&quot;. In 1983, Bernard Courcelle allegedly created a mercenary firm with his brother. The next year, he became the former security director of the French armaments manufacturer, Luchaire. In 1989, he was in charge of security for the Musée d&#x27;Orsay, which responsibility was assumed by none other than Anne Pingeot, president François Mitterrand&#x27;s secret mistress. In 1993, Courcelle became the leader of the DPS, before becoming in 1999 the leader of Republic of the Congo&#x27;s president Denis Sassou-Nguesso&#x27;s personal guard. He then took charge of the security of the oil company Elf&#x27;s infrastructures in Pointe-Noire.

<doc id="149044" wikidata="Q275102" url="?curid=149044" title="Voivode">
<text>Voivode ( ), also spelled voivod, voievod or voevod and also known as vaivode ( ), voivoda, vojvoda, vaivada or wojewoda, is a title denoting a military leader or warlord in Central, Southeastern and Eastern Europe in use since the Early Middle Ages. It primarily referred to the medieval rulers of the Romanian-inhabited states and of governors and military commanders of Poles, Hungarian, Lithuanian, Balkan, Russian people and other Slavic-speaking populations.

In the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, &quot;voivode&quot; was interchangeably used with &quot;palatine&quot;. In the Tsardom of Russia, a voivode was a military governor. Among the Danube principalities, &quot;voivode&quot; was considered a princely title.

==Etymology==

The term &quot;voivode&quot; comes from two roots. (&quot;voi&quot;[&quot;na&quot;]) means &quot;war, fight,&quot; while (&quot;vodya&quot;) means &#x27;leading&#x27; in Old Slavic, together meaning &#x27;war leader&#x27; or &#x27;warlord&#x27;. The Latin translation is for the principal commander of a military force, serving as a deputy for the monarch. In early Slavic, &quot;vojevoda&quot; meant the , the military leader in battle. The term has also spread to non-Slavic languages, like Romanian, Hungarian and Albanian, in areas with Slavic influence.

==History==

During the Byzantine Empire it referred to military commanders mainly of Slavic-speaking populations, especially in the Balkans, the Bulgarian Empire being the first permanently established Slavic state in the region. The title () originally occurs in the work of the 10th-century Byzantine emperor Constantine VII in his &quot;De Administrando Imperio&quot;, in reference to Hungarian military leaders.

The title was used in medieval: Bohemia, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Hungary, Macedonia, Moldavia, Poland, Rügen, Russian Empire, Ukraine, Serbia, Transylvania and Wallachia. In the Late Middle Ages the voivode, Latin translation is for the principal commander of a military force, deputising for the monarch gradually became the title of territorial governors in Poland, Hungary and the Czech lands and in the Balkans.

During the Ottoman administration of Greece, the Ottoman Voivode of Athens resided in the ancient Gymnasium of Hadrian.

The Serbian Autonomous Province of Vojvodina descends from the Serbian Vojvodina, with Stevan Šupljikac as Vojvoda or Duke, that became later Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar.

==Title of nobility and provincial governorship==

The transition of the voivode from military leader to a high ranking civic role in territorial administration (Local government) occurred in most Slavic-speaking countries and in the Balkans during the Late Middle Ages. They included Bulgaria, Bohemia, Moldavia and Poland. Moreover, in the Czech lands, but also in the Balkans, it was an aristocratic title corresponding to &quot;dux&quot;, Duke or Prince. Many noble families of the &quot;Illyricum&quot; still use this title despite the disputes about the very existence of nobility in the Balkans.

=== Bosnian grand dukes ===

Grand Duke of Bosnia (; ) was a court title in the Kingdom of Bosnia, bestowed by the king to highest military commanders, usually reserved for most influential and most capable among highest Bosnian nobility who already held title of vojvoda. To interpret it as an office post rather than a court rank could be even more accurate. Unlike usage in Western Europe, Central Europe, or in various Slavic lands from Central to North-East Europe, where analogy between &quot;grand duke&quot; and &quot;grand prince&quot; was significant, with both titles corresponding to sovereign lower than king but higher than duke. In Bosnia, the title &quot;grand duke&quot; corresponded more to the Byzantine military title megas doux. It is possible to register some similarities with equivalent titles in neighboring Slavic lands, such as Serbia; however, in neighboring countries, the title &quot;duke&quot;, in Slavic &quot;vojvoda&quot;, also had military significance, but in that sense &quot;grand duke&quot; was specifically, even exclusively, Bosnian title.

=== Ottoman Empire ===

In some provinces and vassal states of the Ottoman Empire, the title of &quot;voivode&quot; (or &quot;voyvoda&quot;) was employed by senior administrators and local rulers. This was common to the extent in Ottoman Bosnia, but especially in the Danubian Principalities, which protected the northern borders of the empire and were ruled by the Greek Phanariotes. The title &quot;Voyvoda&quot; turned into another position at the turn of the 17th century. The governors of provinces and sanjaks would appoint someone from their own households or someone from the local elites to collect the revenues.

==== Ottoman Greece ====
The chief Ottoman administrator of Athens was also called the voivode. One such holder of this title, Hadji Ali Haseki, was voivode on five separate occasions before his final banishment and execution in 1795 after angering both the Greek and Turkish residents of Athens and making powerful enemies at the Porte.

=== Polish–Lithuanian usage ===
==== Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth ====
In 16th-century Poland and Lithuania, the &quot;wojewoda&quot; was a civic role of senatorial rank and neither heritable nor a title of nobility. His powers and duties depended on his location. The least onerous role was in Ruthenia while the most powerful &quot;wojewoda&quot; was in Royal Prussia. The role began in the crown lands as that of an administrative overseer, but his powers were largely ceremonial. Over time he became a representative in the local and national assemblies, the Sejm. His military functions were entirely reduced to supervising a mass mobilization and in practice he ended up as little more than overseer of weights and measures.

Appointments to the role were usually made until 1775 by the king. The exceptions were the voivodes of Polock and Vitebsk who were elected by a local poll of male electors for confirmation by the monarch. In 1791, it was decided to adopt the procedure throughout the country but the 18th-century Partitions of Poland put a stop to it. Polish voivodes were subject to the &quot;Law of Incompatibility&quot; (1569) which prevented them from simultaneously holding ministerial or other civic offices in their area.

====Second Polish Republic====

Following the declaration of independence and the establishment of the Second Polish Republic and its armed forces, the legal basis for establishing voivodeships and restoring the institution of the voivode was the Act of 2 August 1919. The Ordinance of the President of the Republic of Poland of 19 January 1928 did not depart from the voivodeships and the voivodes who headed them. Pursuant to the Act of 2 August 1919, the voivoe retained a double position in the voivodeship: he was a representative of the central government in the voivodeship, as well as the head of the general administration bodies subordinated to him. As part of the first function, apart from representing the government at state ceremonies, the voivode was responsible for coordinating the activities of the entire state administration in the voivodeship in accordance with the basic political line of the government.The scope of the voivode was therefore broad and went beyond the area of matters belonging to the Ministry of the Interior. He also had the right to issue legal acts with force in the territory of the voivodeship. 

His duties included carrying out the orders of individual ministers and taking care of all matters of state administration, excluding tasks falling within the competence of the military, judicial, fiscal, educational, railway, postal and telegraph administration and land offices. Since he had to take care of public security and order in the territory under his control, he was the head of the State Police, in certain situations he could declare a state of emergency and even request military assistance.

The process of organizing and unifying the territorial administration intensified in the 1920s, especially after the May Coup. Their culmination was the regulation of the President of Poland, Ignacy Mościcki, of 1928, on the organization and scope of operation of general administration authorities. This act stipulated that the general administration authorities in the regions were voivodes.

Confidential resolutions of the Council of Ministers issued on 6, 9, and 18 August 1923 established a catalogue of means of influence for the voivodes in relation to all non-combined branches. Since the main task of the voivode was still to ensure security and order, as well as the authority of the government, which required a strong position and quick decision-making, the Council of Ministers, by the regulation of 11 February 1924, enabled voivodes to independently shape the structure of offices subordinate to them and establish departments and divisions with the consent of the minister responsible for a given group of matters and the minister of internal affairs. Only the presidential and budget-economic departments mandatorily existed in each voivodeship office.

Contrary to the provisions of the Act of 1919, the competences of the voivode according to the new legislation was much more wide-ranging. It granted the voivode special supervisory and intervention powers in relation to non-combined administration (). It could convene meetings of heads of non-combined administration bodies for the purpose of coordination their work from the point of view of the interests of the state, demand explanations from them in specific matters and suspend the enforcement of orders contrary to government policy, could also interfere in personnel matters of non-combined administration bodies.

The voivode was nominated by the president, personally subordinated to the minister of internal affairs, to the chairman of the Council of Ministers and to individual ministers. In cyclical reports, the voivodes informed among other things, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and other voivodes about the public mood and actions taken, paying attention mainly to the political activity opposed to the ruling camp. In the thirties, the voivode was responsible for the implementation of the goals and policies of the Sanation camp, hence this position was held by people belonging to the most loyal members of the ruling political group.

====Polish People&#x27;s Republic====
=====1944–1950=====
The Polish Committee of National Liberation (PKWN) in its Manifesto of 22 July 1944, referred to the March Constitution of 1921, but at the same time stated that it exercises power through Voivodeship, Powiat, city and gmina national councils and through authorized representatives. Where national councils do not exist, democratic organizations are obliged to establish them immediately. According to the decree of the Polish Committee of National Liberation of 21 August 1944, these &quot;authorised representatives&quot; were voivodes and starostes. The provincial department (), introduced for the first time in Poland, was the executive body of the Voivodeship National Council. The chairman was the voivode or his deputy. Voivodes were initially appointed by the PKWN at the request of the minister of public administration. The Voivode was appointed and dismissed by the PKWN, from 31 December 1944, the Provisional Government did so at the request of the minister of public administration, and after the adoption of the Small Constitution of 1947 the President of Poland at the request of the minister of public administration in consultation with the president of the Council of Ministers after consulting the competent Voivodeship National Council. The dismissal of a voivode by the appointing authority required a request from the minister of public administration. The voivode&#x27;s resignation could be demanded by the voivodeship national council on its own initiative or on the initiative of one of the poviat national councils. 

The tasks of the voivode with the help of the voivodeship departments:

*Preparation of matters to be discussed by the voivodeship national council or its presidium;
*Deciding on all matters not reserved for the decision of the council or its presidium;
*Implementing the resolution of the council or its presidium;
*Performing, at the request of the council or its presidium, control over the activities of executive bodies of the lower level of self-government and state administration bodies;
* Exercising orderly authority over presidents, vice-presidents, members of city councils, and members of poviat departments;
*Perform other activities entrusted to it by the laws;
* Reporting on its activities to the presidium of the appropriate national council, at least once a month.

From 1946 the voivode was subjected to social control of the voivodeship national council and was obliged to submit periodic reports to it (actually the presidium) on the general line of his activities. The voivode ceased to be the chairman of the voivodeship national council, but due to the position he held, he was a member of the voivodeship national council. Instead, he was the chairman of the provincial government department (the executive body of the council and elected by it), reporting to the provincial national council in this regard. In according to statue of 20 March 1950, the institution of the Voivode was abolished and his competences was transferred to the Voivodeship National Council and it&#x27;s presidium.

=====1973–1990=====
As part of the 1972-1975 administrative reform, the Voivode position was reintroduced according to the law published on 22 November 1973. receiving powers which were at the hands of the Presidium of the Voivodeship National Councils. Thus, the model of the collegial structure of administrative bodies was abandoned. Although the presidiums were left in the system of national councils, their role and position was reduced to the internal organ of the council, representing the council outside. Since the publishing of the law amending the Act on National Councils of 1973, departments and other organizational units previously subordinated directly to the Presidium of National Councils were transformed into a comprehensively recognized office () with the help of which the voivode was to perform his tasks as state administration body. The Voivodes were to be appointed by the Prime Minister following a consultation with the respective Voivodeship National Council. Their competencies included

* Undertake actions aimed at performing tasks resulting from the social and economic development plan of the country;
* Develop, on the basis of the guidelines of the Council of Ministers, draft plans for the socio-economic development of the area and draft budgets;
* Responsible for carrying out tasks resulting from these plans;
* Responsible for ensuring the proper use of funds allocated for &quot;socio-economic development of the area and improvement of the living, educational, social and cultural conditions of the inhabitants&quot;;
* Coordinate the activities related to local economy of all state and cooperative units and social organizations, issuing recommendations regarding the implementation of tasks resulting from the socio-economic development plan of a given voivodeship;
* Control the performance of tasks specified in the socio-economic plan by state and cooperative units and social organizations;
* Undertake activities in the field of development of socialized and individual agriculture, tasks aimed at protecting the natural environment, ensuring cleanliness and order as well as fire and flood protection;
* Coordinate activities in the field of development of science, higher education and technology;
* Carry out the tasks entrusted by law in the field of state defense;
* Organize social forces and means for the protection of public order and security, supervise and control the activities of the Milicja Obywatelska and Volunteer Reserve of the Milicja Obywatelska in this regard, and issued orders to these bodies;
* Visit prisons and familiarized themselves with their conditions and made appropriate recommendations or applied to superior units.
*Ensure compliance of the operation of organizational units not subordinated to national councils with the socio-economic plan and the needs of the voivodeship. To support this, the voivode had the right to apply to the heads of these units for punishing, suspending or dismissing an employee who neglects his official duties, shows an inappropriate attitude towards people or violates work discipline. Secondly, the voivode had the right to suspend the head of an organizational unit not subordinated to the national council in &quot;in the event of a gross violation of official duties causing serious social and economic damage&quot;.

The Voivode, providing conditions for the Voivodeship National Council to perform its statutory tasks, participated in its sessions and meetings of its presidium, ensured the implementation of the Voivodeship National Council resolutions and decisions of the presidium and submitted reports on their implementation, presented the WRN with draft plans for the social and economic development of the voivodeship and the budget, submitted reports from their implementation and cooperated with the presidium of the Voivodeship National Council in matters related to the implementation of the tasks of the presidium and the preparation of the council session, applied to the presidium to convene a session of the WRN and the subject of its deliberations. In addition, the voivode cooperated with the Voivodeship National Council committees and councillors, assisted them in the implementation of tasks, in maintaining communication with residents and the residents&#x27; self-government and in conducting control activities, and presented drafts of major ordinances and decisions to the WRN committees for consultation and informed about the implementation of the committee&#x27;s conclusions. 

Voivodes were served by voivodeship offices. The voivode could also perform some of his tasks with the help of &quot;united field offices, enterprises, plants and institutions&quot; subordinated to him. The functions and status of the voivode were clarified in January 1978 in the regulation of the Council of Ministers. The preamble to this act states, inter alia, that &quot;the voivode, while performing his tasks in the field of managing the national economy in the voivodeship, is guided by the resolutions of the Polish United Workers&#x27; Party as the guiding political force of society in socialist construction. This regulation specified the basic rights and duties of the voivode as the representative of the government, the executive and managing body of the Voivodeship National Council and the local state administration body at the voivodeship level.&quot; An important competence of the voivode in this function was to exercise control over the implementation of voters&#x27; postulates and motions. The voivode, on the basis of the guidelines of the council of ministers, also prepared draft plans for the socio-economic development of the voivodeship and draft budgets, implemented the plan and budget adopted by the voivodeship national council and performed other tasks related to the comprehensive development of the voivodeship and meeting the needs of society, focusing on key problems, especially concerning the complex of agriculture and food economy, improving market supply, housing construction and housing management, as well as meeting the communal and living needs of the population.

It was also specified that the voivode performed and organized the performance of tasks in the voivodeship resulting from the provisions of generally applicable law, orders of the Prime Minister and resolutions of the WRN. Voivodes also controlled the performance by units subordinated and not subordinated to national councils of tasks resulting from laws and other acts of law. In this regard, they had the right to take the necessary decisions to ensure their full implementation.

In 1988 further regulations clarified the voivode&#x27;s competences and tasks compared to the earlier regulations of 1975 and 1983. As the representative of the central government in the voivodeship, the voivode coordinated the work of all state administration bodies operating in the voivodeship in the field of meeting the needs of the population and socio-economic development of the area; organized control over the performance of state administration tasks in the voivodeship resulting from acts and ordinances, resolutions and orders of the chief state administration bodies; ensured the cooperation of organizational units operating in the voivodeship in the field of maintaining law and order, as well as preventing natural disasters and removing their effects. In addition, he was responsible for the ad hoc tasks commissioned by the council of ministers, the government presidium, the prime minister and the minister responsible for administration. Such a definition of competences constituted a qualitative change in relation to the amended regulation. Acting as a government representative, the voivode also represented the central authorities at state ceremonies and during official meetings in the voivodeship.

==== Modern Poland ====

=====1991–1999=====
The reactivation, by the Act of 8 March 1990, of a self-governing commune with legal personality, its own sphere of public tasks, its own authorities and territory, independent of other local bodies of state (government) administration, forced a new look at the role of the voivode as a local body of state administration. The legal position of the voivode after 1990 was in line with the territorial division of the country, where communes were the basic territorial division units, while the voivodeship was the basic territorial division unit for the performance of government administration. In this concept, the voivode as a body of general government administration, in particular:
*Manages and coordinated the work and ensured the conditions for the operation of the government administration in the voivodeship, voivodeship services and inspections and others provincial units;
*Supervises the activities of local government units to the extent and on the terms specified by laws;
*Issues decisions in individual cases in the field of government administration belonging to its properties;
*Represents the State Treasury on the terms and to the extent specified by statutes and exercised the powers and duties of the founding body towards state-owned enterprises;
*Publishes the provincial official journal;
*Issues orders in matters within its jurisdiction;
*Performs other tasks specified by law.
The voivode was also a higher-ranking authority within the meaning of the regulations of the Code of Administrative Procedure in 
relations to heads of regional offices of general government administration and local government bodies within the scope of commissioned government administration tasks carried out by these bodies.

The voivode, as a representative of the government, also performed tasks commissioned by the Council of Ministers. He had the right to issue recommendations to local government administration bodies operating in the voivodeship and, in particularly justified cases, he could suspend the activities of each body conducting administrative enforcement for a specified period of time. Special administration bodies and municipal bodies, within the scope of government administration tasks performed by them, were obliged to provide the voivode, at his request, with explanations in every case conducted in the voivodeship. The voivode also issued opinions on the appointment and dismissal of heads of special administration and appointed and dismissed, in consultation with the competent minister, heads of services, inspections and other organizational units. However, in relation to state-owned companies, the voivode issued opinions on candidates for members of supervisory bodies appointed by the representative of the state treasury and had the right to nominate candidates for members of the company&#x27;s supervisory body.

The position of voivodes at that time was justified by the fact that there was no self-government voivodeship, and the administrative voivodeship was strictly governmental in nature and was headed by the voivode as the land manager, who, together with the local government assembly, represented the voivodeship outside. However, its position was not as strong as before 1990, because the Constitutional Act of 1992 clearly indicated that local government was the basic form of organizing local public life, while other types of local government units were to be defined by law. Also, the establishment of new bodies - financial supervision in the form of the Regional Chamber of Accounts and the Adjudication Committee and Boards of Appeals changed the scope of competences of voivodes.

Within the scope of his competence and competence, the voivode as a representative of the government and the representative of the state&#x27;s interests could organize control of tasks in the field of government administration, defined detailed objectives of the government&#x27;s policy in the voivodeship, adapted to local conditions, coordinated the cooperation of all organizational units of government and local government administration operating on in the area of the voivodeship in the field of preventing threats to human life and health, environmental threats, maintaining public order and state security, protecting civil rights, preventing natural disasters, preventing threats as well as combating and removing their effects. The voivode also coordinated tasks in the field of defense and state security in the voivodeship, represented the government at state ceremonies and performed other tasks commissioned by the Council of Ministers. The Small Constitution of 1992 did not assign any special tasks to the voivodes in the field of taking care of the development of the voivodeship or the development of its resources, because already then it was realized that the administrative division into 49 administrative units does not meet the requirements of the time and that the voivode is in fact not the host of region, but a representative of the Council of Ministers and, on its behalf, the Prime Minister.

=====1999–present=====
The 1999 administrative reform in Poland reduced the numbers of voivodeships from 49 to 16 thus making each voivodeship much larger in size. This caused many discussions, also protests and conflicts and questions regarding the role of the voivodes in the system. The new act of 5 June 1998 on government administration in the voivodeship
it was specified that the voivode is:
* Representative of the Council of Ministers in the voivodeship;
* Head of the combined government administration;
* A supervisory authority over local government units;
* A higher-level authority within the meaning of the provisions on administrative proceedings.

The voivode, as a representative of the Council of Ministers, was responsible for implementing the government&#x27;s policy. The voivode&#x27;s powers also included issuing orders binding on all government administration bodies, and in emergency situations also binding on the bodies of local government units. The voivode could also, in particularly justified cases, suspend the activities of each body conducting administrative enforcement for a specified period of time. On the other hand, the non-combined administration bodies () were obliged to agree with the voivode on the drafts of local law enacted by them, in order to ensure compliance of their activities with the voivode&#x27;s orders and to submit annual information to the voivode on their activities in the voivodeship. In addition, the voivode&#x27;s competences included all matters in the field of government administration not reserved for other bodies and supervision over the activities of local government units, representing the State Treasury in relation to state property and exercising other powers resulting from representing the State Treasury and exercising the powers and duties of the founding body towards state-owned enterprises. The voivode, at the request of the staroste, with the opinion of the competent head of the combined service, inspection or voivodeship guard, could create, transform and liquidate organizational units constituting the auxiliary apparatus of the heads of powiat services, inspections and guards, unless separate provisions provided otherwise. Governor could appoint and dismiss the heads of combined services, inspections and guards voivodeships, except for Voivodeship Police Commander, who was appointed after consultation opinion of the voivode.

In addition, the voivode has powers and responsibilities regarding defense in the voivodeship, as specified in the Homeland Defence Act:

*Defines detailed directions of action for the heads of combined services, inspections and guards, and non-combined administration bodies and local government units in the implementation of defense tasks;
*Manages the implementation of projects related to increasing the state&#x27;s defense readiness carried out by marshals of voivodeships, starostes, commune heads (mayors, presidents of cities), entrepreneurs and other organizational and social organizations based in the voivodeship;
*Coordinates the undertakings necessary to secure the mobilization of military units and the provision of defense services;
*Manages the implementation of projects related to the preparation of management positions for local authorities;
*Organizes the use of local forces and resources for the needs of the defense of the state and the area of the voivodship, including protecting the population, material and cultural goods against means of destruction, as well as providing assistance to the injured;
*Controls and evaluates the performance of defense tasks by authorities, entities, entrepreneurs and organizational units;
*Organizes public education on defense preparation and conducts defense training and exercises.

In 2001 the powers and competences of the voivodes was reduced as some of their authority was transferred to the Voivodeship sejmik.

Voivodes continue to have a role in local government in Poland today, as authorities of voivodeships and overseers of self-governing local councils, answerable not to the local electorate but as representatives/emissaries of the central government&#x27;s Council of Ministers. They are appointed by the Chairman of the Council of Ministers and among their main tasks are budgetary control and supervision of the administrative code.

<doc id="149045" wikidata="Q284500" url="?curid=149045" title="Turner Prize">
<text>The Turner Prize, named after the English painter J. M. W. Turner, is an annual prize presented to a British visual artist. Between 1991 and 2016, only artists under the age of 50 were eligible (this restriction was removed for the 2017 award). The prize is awarded at Tate Britain every other year, with various venues outside of London being used in alternate years. Since its beginnings in 1984 it has become the UK&#x27;s most publicised art award. The award represents all media.

As of 2004, the monetary award was established at £40,000. There have been different sponsors, including Channel 4 television and Gordon&#x27;s Gin. A prominent event in British culture, the prize has been awarded by various distinguished celebrities: in 2006 this was Yoko Ono, and in 2012 it was presented by Jude Law.

It is a controversial event, mainly for the exhibits, such as &quot;The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living&quot; – a shark in formaldehyde by Damien Hirst – and &quot;My Bed&quot;, a dishevelled bed by Tracey Emin. Controversy has also come from other directions, including Culture Minister Kim Howells criticising exhibits, a guest of honour (Madonna) swearing, prize judge Lynn Barber writing in the press, and a speech by Sir Nicholas Serota about the purchase of a trustee&#x27;s work.

==Background==
The prize was named after Turner, because, though he is now considered one of the country&#x27;s greatest artists, when he was active, his work was controversial. While he is now looked at as a traditionalist, his new approach to landscape painting changed the course of art history, as many of the Turner Prize winners aspire to do.

Each year after the announcement of the four nominees and during the build-up to the announcement of the winner, the Prize receives intense attention from the media. Much of this attention is critical and the question is often asked, &quot;Is this art?&quot;

The shortlisted and winning artists are chosen by the prize&#x27;s jury based upon a showing of their work that they have staged in the preceding year. Nominations for the prize are usually invited from the public, although these suggestions are not a significant part of the selection process according to Lynn Barber, one of the 2006 judges. Public nominations were not actively sought for the prize in 2020 or 2021 &quot;given the uncertainties of lockdown&quot;. The shortlist (usually of four or five artists) is announced in July; a show of the nominees&#x27; work opens at Tate Britain in late October; the prize itself is announced at the beginning of December. The exhibition remains on view until January. The prize is officially not judged on the Tate show, however, but on the earlier exhibition for which the artist was nominated.

The exhibition and prize rely on commercial sponsorship. By 1987, money for the prize was provided by Drexel Burnham Lambert; its withdrawal after its demise led to the cancellation of the prize for 1990. Channel 4, an independent television channel, stepped in for 1991, doubling the prize money to £20,000, and supporting the event with documentaries and live broadcasts of the prize-giving. Channel 4&#x27;s head of arts at the time, Waldemar Januszczak, was influential in helping set the format for the prize in the following years, such as arguing for the age limit of 50 that was in place from 1991 until 2017. In 2004, they were replaced as sponsors by Gordon&#x27;s Gin, doubling the prize money to £40,000, with £5,000 going to each of the shortlisted artists, and £25,000 to the winner. At a press conference for the 2019 prize, bus operator Stagecoach were announced as the lead sponsors of that year&#x27;s prize, drawing questions from journalists as to whether the company was an appropriate sponsor, due to the chairman Brian Souter&#x27;s support of Section 28 laws and campaigning against the legalisation of same-sex marriage. It was announced the following day that Tate and Turner Contemporary (the gallery hosting that year&#x27;s prize) had mutually agreed to terminate the sponsorship with Stagecoach.

As much as the shortlist of artists reflects the state of British Art, the composition of the panel of judges, which includes curators and critics, provides some indication of who holds influence institutionally and internationally, as well as who are rising stars. Former Tate Director Sir Nicholas Serota was the Chair of the jury from the start of his tenure at the Tate in 1988 until 2006. There are conflicting reports as to how much personal sway he has over the proceedings.

The media success of the Turner Prize contributed to the success of (and was in turn helped by) such late 1990s phenomena as the Young British Artists (several of whom were nominees and winners), Cool Britannia, and exhibitions such as the Charles Saatchi-sponsored &quot;Sensation&quot; exhibition.

Most of the artists nominated for the prize selection become known to the general public for the first time as a consequence. Some have talked of the difficulty of the sudden media exposure. Sale prices of the winners have generally increased. Chris Ofili, Anish Kapoor and Jeremy Deller later became trustees of the Tate. Some artists, including Sarah Lucas and Julian Opie, have declined the invitation to be nominated.

==Winners and nominees==
==History==
The identity of the Turner Prize is deeply associated with conceptual art. For two of its first editions, Art &amp; Language was nominated in 1986, and Terry Atkinson, one of the founders and historical member of Art &amp; Language, was nominated in 1985.

In 2000, Tillmans was the first photographer and first non-British artist to receive the Turner Prize.

===1984===
Malcolm Morley is awarded the inaugural Turner Prize for his installation of two oil-on-canvas paintings inspired by a trip to Greece. Morley&#x27;s win sparked controversy because he had been living in New York for the previous 20 years. Other nominees included Richard Long, Richard Deacon and Gilbert &amp; George, all of whom went on to win the Turner Prize themselves. The prize was awarded by Lord Gowrie, Minister for the Arts at the time.

===1985===
Howard Hodgkin was awarded the Turner Prize for &quot;A Small Thing But My Own&quot;. Other nominees included Terry Atkinson, sculptor Tony Cragg, Ian Hamilton Finlay, Milena Kalinovska and painting/printing artist John Walker. The prize was awarded by celebrity presenter Sir Richard Attenborough.

===1986===
The controversial art duo Gilbert &amp; George were awarded the prize after a previous nomination in 1984. Other nominees included Art &amp; Language (collaborative group composed of Michael Baldwin and Mel Ramsden), sculpture/printing artist Victor Burgin, painter Derek Jarman, painter Stephen McKenna and sculptor Bill Woodrow.

===1987===
Sculpture artist Richard Deacon was awarded the prize. Other nominees included graphic-style painter/printer Patrick Caulfield, Helen Chadwick, Richard Long, Declan McGonagle and Thérèse Oulton. The prize was presented by George Melly.

===1988===
Sculpture artist Tony Cragg was awarded the prize by Alan Yentob. Other nominees included figurative/portrait painter Lucian Freud, Pop artist Richard Hamilton, Richard Long, David Mach (graduate of Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art), printer Boyd Webb, sculptor Alison Wilding and Richard Wilson. The appointment of Tate Director Nicholas Serota led to many changes such as the introduction of an annual rehang of the Collection and giving priority to modern and contemporary art. During this period the future of the Prize was uncertain. The Turner Prize was modified to be an artist-only prize without a published shortlist and a solo exhibition was awarded to the winner, Tony Cragg.

===1989===
Sculpture and installation artist Richard Long was presented with the prize after three previous nominations. Controversially, Long was awarded for his lifetime body of work rather than an exhibition of work in 1989. Other nominees included painter Gillian Ayres, figurative painter Lucian Freud, sculptor Giuseppe Penone, painter Paula Rego, abstract painter Sean Scully and Richard Wilson. Italian-born Giuseppe Penone became the first foreign artist to be nominated for the strength of his exhibitions in Britain.

===1990===
No prize was awarded due to lack of sponsorship. Under Tate Director and Turner Prize chairman Nicholas Serota, changes are made to involve the public in the viewing of the nominated artist such as a published shortlist, a nomination of four shortlisted artists and an individual exhibition of nominated work within the Tate.

===1991===
Anish Kapoor received the prize for an untitled piece in sandstone and pigment. Other nominees included abstract painters Ian Davenport, Fiona Rae and sculptor Rachel Whiteread.

===1992===
Grenville Davey received the prize for &quot;HAL&quot;, a work consisting of two abstract steel objects, each measuring 244 x 122 cm (96 x 48 in). Other nominees included the Young British Artist (yBA) Damien Hirst for his installations, photographer David Tremlett and sculptor Alison Wilding.

===1993===
Rachel Whiteread was the winner for &quot;House&quot;, a concrete cast of the inside of a house on Grove Road, near Roman Road, London E3. Jimmy Cauty and Bill Drummond of the K Foundation received media coverage for the award of the &quot;Anti-Turner Prize&quot;, £40,000 to be given to the &quot;worst artist in Britain&quot;, voted from the real Turner Prize&#x27;s short-list. Rachel Whiteread was awarded their prize. She refused to accept the money at first, but changed her mind when she heard the cash was to be burned instead, and gave £30,000 of it to artists in financial need and the other £10,000 to the housing charity, Shelter. The K Foundation went on to make a film in which they burned £1 million of their own money (&quot;Watch the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid&quot;). Other nominees included painter Sean Scully, Laotian-born Vong Phaophanit and printer Hannah Collins.

===1994===
Popular sculptor Antony Gormley was awarded the 1994 Turner Prize. Other nominees included video artist Northern Irish-born Willie Doherty, whose work &quot;The Only Good One Is A Dead One&quot; was the first video piece to be nominated for the prize, painter Peter Doig and multi-media Shirazeh Houshiary.

===1995===
Damien Hirst was awarded the 1995 Turner Prize, which included his notorious sculpture &quot;Mother and Child, Divided&quot;. Other nominees included Lebanese-born installation/video artist Mona Hatoum, abstract painter Callum Innes and multi-media artist Mark Wallinger.

===1996===
Douglas Gordon became the first video artist to win the Turner Prize. Other nominees included photographer Craigie Horsfield, painter Gary Hume and installation artist Simon Patterson.

===1997===

The winner, Gillian Wearing, showed a video &quot;60 minutes of Silence&quot; (1996), where a group of actors were dressed in police uniforms and had to stand still for an hour (occasional surreptitious scratching could be observed).

A drunken Tracey Emin walked out of a live Channel 4 discussion programme, presented as part of the coverage of the award. The discussion was chaired by Tim Marlow and also included Roger Scruton, Waldemar Januszczak, Richard Cork, David Sylvester and Norman Rosenthal. Emin wrote about the incident in her 2005 book &quot;Strangeland&quot;, describing her shock at reading &quot;The Guardian&quot; writeup the following day.

This was the only time in history with an all-female shortlist including sculptor Christine Borland, Angela Bulloch and sculptor Cornelia Parker.

===1998===
The talking point was Chris Ofili&#x27;s use of balls of elephant dung attached to his mixed media images on canvas, as well as being used as supports on the floor to prop them up. An illustrator deposited dung on the steps in protest against his work. Ofili won the prize and it was the first time in twelve years that a painter had done so; it was presented by French fashion designer agnès b. Ofili joked, &quot;Oh man. Thank God! Where&#x27;s my cheque?&quot; and said: &quot;I don&#x27;t know what to say. I am just really happy. I can&#x27;t believe it. It feels like a film and I will watch the tape when I get home.&quot; One of Ofili&#x27;s works, &quot;No Woman No Cry&quot; is based on the murder of Stephen Lawrence, killed in a race attack.

The jury included musician Neil Tennant, author Marina Warner, curator Fumio Nanjo and British Council officer Ann Gallagher, chaired by Nicholas Serota.

Other nominees included installation artist Tacita Dean, sculptor Cathy de Monchaux and video artist Sam Taylor-Wood. In addition to being the first black person to win the prize, Ofili also became the first painter to win since Howard Hodgkin in 1985.

===1999===

The Prize was given to Steve McQueen for his video based on a Buster Keaton film. Some media attention was given to Tracey Emin&#x27;s exhibit &quot;My Bed,&quot; which was a double bed in a dishevelled state with stained sheets, surrounded by detritus such as soiled underwear, condoms, slippers and empty drink bottles. Two artists, Yuan Chai and Jian Jun Xi, jumped onto the bed, stripped to their underwear, and had a pillow fight. Police detained the two, who called their performance &quot;Two Naked Men Jump into Tracey&#x27;s Bed&quot;. Other nominees included Steven Pippin and collaborative sibling duo Jane and Louise Wilson.

===2000===

The prize was won by Wolfgang Tillmans. Other entries included a large painting by Glenn Brown based very closely on a science fiction illustration published some years previously. Michael Raedecker and Tomoko Takahashi were also nominated.
The Stuckist art group staged their first demonstration against the prize, dressed as clowns, describing it as an &quot;ongoing national joke&quot; and &quot;a state-funded advertising agency for Charles Saatchi&quot;, adding &quot;the only artist who wouldn&#x27;t be in danger of winning the Turner Prize is Turner&quot;, and concluding that it &quot;should be re-named The Duchamp Award for the destruction of artistic integrity&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; announced the winner of Turner Prize with the headline &quot;Turner Winner Riles the Stuckists&quot;.

===2001===

Controversy was caused by winner Martin Creed&#x27;s installation &quot;Work No. 227: The lights going on and off&quot; consisting of an empty room whose lighting periodically came on and went off. Artist Jacqueline Crofton threw eggs at the walls of the room containing Creed&#x27;s work as a protest. At the prize ceremony, Madonna gave him the prize and said, &quot;At a time when political correctness is valued over honesty I would also like to say &quot;Right on, motherfuckers!&quot;. This was on live TV before the 9 pm watershed and an attempt to &quot;bleep&quot; it out was too late. Channel 4 were subsequently given an official rebuke by the Independent Television Commission.

Other nominees included photographer Richard Billingham, video/installation artist (and now film director) Isaac Julien and installation artist Mike Nelson.

===2002===
The media focused on a large display by Fiona Banner whose wall-size text piece, &quot;Arsewoman in Wonderland,&quot; described a pornographic film in detail. &quot;The Guardian&quot; asked, &quot;It&#x27;s art. But is it porn?&quot; calling in &quot;Britain&#x27;s biggest porn star&quot;, Ben Dover, to comment. Culture Minister Kim Howells made a scathing criticism of the exhibits as &quot;conceptual bullshit&quot;. Prince Charles wrote to him: &quot;It&#x27;s good to hear your refreshing common sense about the dreaded Turner prize. It has contaminated the art establishment for so long.&quot; Graffiti artist Banksy stencilled &quot;Mind the crap&quot; on the steps of the Tate, who called in emergency cleaners to remove it. The prize was won by Keith Tyson.

Other nominees included Liam Gillick and Catherine Yass.

===2003===

Jake and Dinos Chapman caused press attention for a sculpture, &quot;Death&quot;, that appeared to be two cheap plastic blow-up sex dolls with a dildo. It was in fact made of bronze, painted to look like plastic.

Attention was also given to Grayson Perry who exhibited pots decorated with sexual imagery, and was the prize winner. He wore a flouncy skirt to collect the prize, announced by Sir Peter Blake, who said, after being introduced by Sir Nicholas Serota, &quot;Thank you very much Nick. I&#x27;m quite surprised to be here tonight, because two days ago I had a phone call asking if I would be a judge for the &quot;Not the Turner Prize&quot;. And two years ago I was asked by the Stuckists to dress as a clown and come and be on the steps outside, so I am thrilled and slightly surprised to be here.&quot;

Other nominees included Willie Doherty (his second nomination since 1994) and Anya Gallaccio.

===2004===
The media focused on a large computer simulation of a former hideout of Osama bin Laden by Ben Langlands and Nikki Bell, as well as the fact that one of their exhibits, a film in a Kabul courtroom was withdrawn as it related to an ongoing trial of a suspected Afghan warlord. Betting favourite Jeremy Deller won the prize with his film &quot;Memory Bucket&quot;, documenting both George W. Bush&#x27;s hometown Crawford, Texas – and the siege in Waco nearby. The prize money was increased this year with £25,000 to the winner, and, for the first time, other nominees were rewarded (with £5,000 each).

Other nominees included Kutluğ Ataman and installation/photograph/sculpture artist Yinka Shonibare, who was tipped as the public&#x27;s favourite among the other nominees.

===2005===

A great deal was made in the press about the winning entry by Simon Starling, which was a shed that he had converted into a boat, sailed down the River Rhine and turned back into a shed again. Two newspapers bought sheds and floated them to parody the work. The prize was presented by Culture Minister, David Lammy. Before introducing him, Sir Nicholas Serota, in an &quot;unusual, possibly unprecedented&quot; move, took the opportunity to make &quot;an angry defence&quot; of the Tate&#x27;s purchase of &quot;The Upper Room&quot;.

===2006===

The nominees were announced on 16 May 2006. The exhibition of nominees&#x27; work opened at Tate Britain on 3 October. Yoko Ono, the celebrity announcer chosen for the year, declared Tomma Abts the winner on 4 December during a live Channel 4 broadcast, although this was part of the evening news broadcast, rather than in a dedicated programme as in recent years. The total prize money was £40,000: £25,000 awarded to the winner and £5,000 to each of the other 3 nominees. The prize was sponsored by the makers of Gordon&#x27;s Gin.

Under the Freedom of Information Act, &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; obtained emails between the Tate and judge Lynn Barber, which revealed that the judges had been sent a list of shows by artists too late to be able to see them and instead were being supplied with catalogues and photographs of work.

More controversy ensued when Barber wrote in &quot;The Observer&quot; about her troubles as a judge, even asking, &quot;Is it all a fix?&quot;, a comment subsequently displayed on a Stuckist demonstration placard, much to her chagrin.

The judges were:
:Lynn Barber, journalist, &quot;The Observer&quot;
:Margot Heller, director, South London Gallery
:Matthew Higgs, Director and Chief Curator, White Columns, New York
:Andrew Renton, writer and Director of Curating, Goldsmiths College
:Nicholas Serota, director, Tate and Chairman of the Jury

===2007===

The winner of the £25,000 Prize was Mark Wallinger. His display at the Turner Prize show was &quot;Sleeper&quot;, a film of him dressed in a bear costume wandering around an empty museum, but the prize was officially given for &quot;State Britain&quot;, which recreated all the objects in Brian Haw&#x27;s anti-war display in Parliament Square, London. The judges commended Wallinger&#x27;s work for its &quot;immediacy, visceral intensity and historic importance&quot;, and called it &quot;a bold political statement with art&#x27;s ability to articulate fundamental human truths.&quot; The prize was presented by Dennis Hopper.

For the first time in its 23-year history, the Turner Prize was held outside London, in Tate Liverpool (in support of Liverpool being the European Capital of Culture in 2008), following a suggestion by gallery worker Jason Richardson. Concurrently there was an exhibition of previous winners at Tate Britain in London.

Unlike recent years, Sir Nicholas Serota was not the jury chairman; instead, the chairman was Christoph Grunenberg, the Director of Tate Liverpool. The panel was:
:Fiona Bradley, Director of the Fruitmarket Gallery, Edinburgh
:Michael Bracewell, critic and writer
:Thelma Golden, Director and Chief Curator of the Studio Museum, Harlem
:Miranda Sawyer, writer and broadcaster
:Christoph Grunenberg, Director of Tate Liverpool (Chairman of the Jury)

The nominees were:
:Mark Wallinger for his Tate Britain installation, &quot;State Britain&quot;
:Nathan Coley, a Glasgow artist, who makes installations based on buildings
:Zarina Bhimji, a Ugandan Asian photographer and filmmaker
:Mike Nelson, an installation artist

Nelson and Wallinger had both previously been nominated for the prize.

The Stuckists announced that they were not demonstrating for the first time since 2000, because of &quot;the lameness of this year&#x27;s show, which does not merit the accolade of the traditional demo&quot;. Instead, art group AAS re-enacted previous Stuckist demonstrations in protest against their own practice at the Royal Standard Turner Prize Extravaganza.

===2008===

Mark Leckey was the winner of the Turner Prize of 2008.

For the second year running, Sir Nicholas Serota did not chair the Turner Prize jury; instead Stephen Deuchar, director of Tate Britain, was the chair. The other members were Jennifer Higgie, editor of &quot;frieze&quot;, Daniel Birnbaum, rector of the Städelschule international art academy, Frankfurt, architect David Adjaye, and Suzanne Cotter, senior curator, Modern Art Oxford. The prize winner received £25,000 and the other three nominees £5,000 each. In recent years the prize has attracted commercial sponsorship, but did not have any during the 2008 events. The nominees were Runa Islam, Mark Leckey, Goshka Macuga, and Cathy Wilkes; the Prize exhibition opened at Tate Britain on 30 September and the winner was announced on 1 December.

===2009===

The winner of the £25,000 Prize was Richard Wright.
Stephen Deuchar again chaired the jury.

The other shortlisted artists were Enrico David, Roger Hiorns and Lucy Skaer.

===2010===

The winner was Susan Philipsz who graduated from Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art &amp; Design in Dundee. She was the first artist ever to win with a purely aural work, having made an installation under three bridges in Glasgow in which she sang folklorised versions of the sea shanty &quot;Lowlands Away&quot;. For the Turner Prize, the work consisted simply of loudspeakers installed along the walls in a gallery room. The other artists nominated were Dexter Dalwood, Angela de la Cruz, and the Otolith Group.

===2011===

The 2011 Turner Prize took place in Gateshead at the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art, away from the Tate in London for the first time since 2007. The winner was Martin Boyce. The other nominees were Karla Black, Hilary Lloyd and George Shaw. The prize ceremony was interrupted by the international streaker Mark Roberts who was hired by the artist Benedikt Dichgans.

149,770 people visited the exhibition in Gateshead making it the most visited Turner Prize exhibition ever.

===2012===

The nominees for the 2012 prize were Spartacus Chetwynd, Luke Fowler (graduate of Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art), Paul Noble and Elizabeth Price.

Former Talulah Gosh member Elizabeth Price was awarded the £25,000 prize.

===2013===

The 2013 Turner Prize were held at Ebrington Square in Derry, the first-time the prize was awarded outside England, as part of the UK City of Culture celebrations.
The prize jury was chaired by Penelope Curtis, Director of Tate Britain.
The nominees for the 2013 award were Laure Prouvost, Tino Sehgal, David Shrigley, and Lynette Yiadom-Boakye.
The winner of the 2013 prize was Laure Prouvost.

===2014===

The nominees for the 2014 award were Duncan Campbell, Ciara Phillips, James Richards and Tris Vonna-Michell. The winner of the 2014 prize was Duncan Campbell.

===2015===

The nominees for the 2015 award were Bonnie Camplin, Janice Kerbel, Nicole Wermers, and Assemble. The winner of the 2015 prize was Assemble. The exhibition was held in Glasgow, Scotland, in the Tramway, a contemporary art, theatre and dance space.

=== 2016 ===
The nominees for the 2016 award were Michael Dean, Anthea Hamilton, Helen Marten, and Josephine Pryde. The winner was Helen Marten.

===2017===

The nominees for the 2017 award were Lubaina Himid, Rosalind Nashashibi, Hurvin Anderson, and Andrea Büttner. The exhibition was held in Hull, at the Ferens Art Gallery, as part of Hull UK City of Culture 2017. The winner was Lubaina Himid.

===2018===
The nominees for the 2018 award were Forensic Architecture, Naeem Mohaiemen, Charlotte Prodger, and Luke Willis Thompson. All four were video artists.

The shortlist was drawn up by writer and critic Oliver Basciano, Elena Filipovic, director, Kunsthalle Basel; Lisa Le Feuvre, executive director of Holt/Smithson Foundation; and novelist Tom McCarthy. The winner was Charlotte Prodger.

===2019===
The 2019 award was hosted at the Turner Contemporary in Margate, Kent. The shortlisted artists were Lawrence Abu Hamdan, Helen Cammock, Oscar Murillo and Tai Shani, who were jointly awarded the prize as a collective following their request to be considered as a single group.

===2020===
It was announced in May, at a late stage in judging, that this year&#x27;s award would be replaced by a bursary for 10 artists who would be announced in July due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom.

The 10 artists to receive bursaries were: Oreet Ashery, Liz Johnson Artur, Shawanda Corbett, Jamie Crewe, Sean Edwards, Sidsel Meineche Hansen, Ima-Abasi Okon, Imran Perretta, Alberta Whittle, and the political arts organisation Arika.

===2021===
Hosted in Coventry, the 2021 nominees were Array Collective, Black Obsidian Sound System, Cooking Sections, Gentle/Radical, and Project Art Works. Array Collective were announced as the winners on 1 December 2021.

===2022===
On 12 April 2022, it was announced that the nominees for the prize were Heather Phillipson, Ingrid Pollard, Veronica Ryan, and Sin Wai Kin. Veronica Ryan was announced as the winner.

===2023===
Jesse Darling won the award in 2023, hosted in Eastbourne. Nominees were Jesse Darling, Ghislaine Leung, Rory Pilgrim and Barbara Walker

===2024===
On 24 April 2024, it was announced that the nominees for the prize were Jasleen Kaur, Pio Abad, Claudette Johnson, and Delaine Le Bas. On 3 December, Kaur was announced as the winner, for her animations of everyday objects. She won £25,000.

The 2024 Turner Prize ceremony was held at the Tate Britain. In her winner&#x27;s speech, Kaur voiced her supported for protestors outside the venue, called for a ceasefire in the Middle East, and referenced a letter signed by &quot;over 1,200 artists and art workers&quot; in November 2024, which called on &quot;Tate to sever ties with two of its funding partners, Outset Contemporary Art Fund and Zabludowicz Art Trust&quot;.

The Delaine Le Bas installation at the 2024 Turner Prize came under scrutiny for suspected plagiarism of an earlier work by Edgeworth Johnstone, who was protesting outside Tate Britain on the day of the award ceremony.

==Public perception==
===In favour===

*Critic Richard Cork said, &quot;there will never be a substitute for approaching new art with an open mind, unencumbered by rancid clichés. As long as the Turner Prize facilitates such engagement, the buzz surrounding it will remain a minor distraction.&quot;
*In 2006, newspaper columnist Janet Street-Porter condemned the Stuckists&#x27; &quot;feeble knee-jerk reaction&quot; to the prize and said, &quot;The Turner Prize and Becks Futures both entice thousands of young people into art galleries for the first time every year. They fulfil a valuable role&quot;.
*Sarah Thornton said that the Turner Prize &quot;has a reputation for being a reliable indicator of an artist&#x27;s ability to sustain a vibrant art practice over the long term, but perhaps it is a self-fulfilling prophecy. The personal confidence gained from being nominated can galvanize an artist&#x27;s ambitions, while the museum&#x27;s public endorsement leads to further exhibition opportunities.&quot;
*Dan Fox, associate editor of &quot;frieze&quot;, said that the Turner Prize should be considered a barometer for the mood of the nation.

===Opposed===

*The &quot;Evening Standard&quot; critic Brian Sewell wrote &quot;The annual farce of the Turner Prize is now as inevitable in November as is the pantomime at Christmas&quot;.
*Critic Matthew Collings wrote: &quot;Turner Prize art is based on a formula where something looks startling at first and then turns out to be expressing some kind of banal idea, which somebody will be sure to tell you about. The ideas are never important or even really ideas, more notions, like the notions in advertising. Nobody pursues them anyway, because there&#x27;s nothing there to pursue.&quot;
*The art critic David Lee has argued that since the re-organisation of the prize in 1991 the shortlist has been dominated by artists represented by a small number of London dealers, namely Nicholas Logsdail of the Lisson Gallery, and others closely linked to the collector Charles Saatchi: Jay Jopling, Maureen Paley and Victoria Miro. The Lisson Gallery has had the most success of any gallery with the Turner Prize from 1991 to 2004.
*In 2002, Culture Minister and former art student Kim Howells pinned the following statement to a board in a room specially-designated for visitors&#x27; comments: &quot;If this is the best British artists can produce then British art is lost. It is cold mechanical, conceptual bullshit. &lt;br&gt;Kim Howells. &lt;br&gt;P.S. The attempts at conceptualisation are particularly pathetic and symptomatic of a lack of conviction.&quot;

==Alternative and spoof prizes==
The Turner Prize has spawned various other prizes in reaction to or ridiculing it. In 1993, the K Foundation gave an &quot;Anti-Turner Prize&quot; of £40,000 for the &quot;worst artist in Britain&quot; with the same short list as the official prize: the winner of both prizes was Rachel Whiteread. In 1999, Trevor Prideaux organized the ongoing Turnip Prize as &quot;a crap art competition... You can enter anything you like, but it must be rubbish&quot;; the judging criteria include &quot;Lack of effort&quot; and &quot;Is it shit?&quot; 

In 2000, the Stuckists instituted &quot;The Real Turner Prize&quot; for painters, and an &quot;Art Clown of the Year Award&quot; for &quot;outstanding idiocy in the visual arts,&quot; both continued in the subsequent years (the Clown award given in 2002 to Serota).

<text>The M1 Garand or M1 rifle is a semi-automatic rifle that was the service rifle of the U.S. Army during World War II and the Korean War.

The rifle is chambered for the .30-06 Springfield cartridge and is named after its Canadian-American designer, John Garand. It was the first standard-issue autoloading rifle for the United States. By most accounts, the M1 rifle performed well. General George S. Patton called it &quot;the greatest battle implement ever devised&quot;. The M1 replaced the (bolt-action) M1903 Springfield as the U.S. service rifle in 1936, and was itself replaced by the (selective-fire) M14 rifle on 26 March 1958.

==Pronunciation==
Sources differ on the pronunciation of the M1 Garand. Some, such as General Julian Hatcher&#x27;s &quot;The Book of the Garand&quot; (1948), give , identical to the pronunciation of John Garand&#x27;s surname. However, a 1952 issue of &quot;Armed Forces Talk&quot;, a periodical published by the U.S. Department of Defense, gives the pronunciation as , saying &quot;popular usage has placed the accent on the second syllable, so that the rifle has become the &#x27;guh-RAND. &quot;American Rifleman&quot; magazine, while acknowledging as the pronunciation favored by U.S. servicemen, deemed either pronunciation valid.

==History==

===Development===
French Canadian-born Garand went to work at the United States Army&#x27;s Springfield Armory and began working on a .30 caliber primer actuated blowback Model 1919 prototype. In 1924, twenty-four rifles, identified as &quot;M1922s&quot;, were built at Springfield. At Fort Benning during 1925, they were tested against models by Berthier, Hatcher-Bang, Thompson, and Pedersen, the latter two being delayed blowback types. This led to a further trial of an improved &quot;M1924&quot; Garand against the Thompson, ultimately producing an inconclusive report. As a result, the Ordnance Board ordered a .30-06 Garand variant. In March 1927, the cavalry board reported trials among the Thompson, Garand, and &#x27;03 Springfield had not led to a clear winner. This led to a gas-operated .276 (7 mm) model (patented by Garand on 12 April 1930).

In early 1928, both the infantry and cavalry boards ran trials with the .276 Pedersen T1 rifle, calling it &quot;highly promising&quot; (despite its use of waxed ammunition, shared by the Thompson). On 13 August 1928, a semiautomatic rifle board (SRB) carried out joint Army, Navy, and Marine Corps trials among the .30 Thompson, both cavalry and infantry versions of the T1 Pedersen, &quot;M1924&quot; Garand, and .256 Bang, and on 21 September, the board reported no clear winner. The .30 Garand, however, was dropped in favor of the .276.

Further tests by the SRB in July 1929, which included rifle designs by Colt–Browning, Garand, Holek, Pedersen, Rheinmetall, Thompson, and an incomplete one by White, led to a recommendation that work on the (dropped) .30 gas-operated Garand be resumed, and a T1E1 was ordered 14 November 1929.

Twenty gas-operated .276 T3E2 Garands were made and competed with T1 Pedersen rifles in early 1931. The .276 Garand was the clear winner of these trials. The .30 caliber Garand was also tested, in the form of a single T1E1, but was withdrawn with a cracked bolt on 9 October 1931. A 4 January 1932 meeting recommended adoption of the .276 caliber and production of approximately 125 T3E2s. Meanwhile, Garand redesigned his bolt and his improved T1E2 rifle was retested. The day after the successful conclusion of this test, Army Chief of Staff General Douglas MacArthur personally disapproved any caliber change, in part because there were extensive existing stocks of .30 M1 ball ammunition. On 25 February 1932, Adjutant General John B. Shuman, speaking for the Secretary of War, ordered work on the rifles and ammunition in .276 caliber cease immediately and completely, and all resources be directed toward identification and correction of deficiencies in the Garand .30 caliber.

On 3 August 1933, the T1E2 became the &quot;semi-automatic rifle, caliber 30, M1&quot;. In May 1934, 75 M1s went to field trials; 50 went to infantry, 25 to cavalry units. Numerous problems were reported, forcing the rifle to be modified, yet again, before it could be recommended for service and cleared for procurement on 7 November 1935, then standardized 9 January 1936. The first production model was successfully proof-fired, function-fired, and fired for accuracy on 21 July 1937.

Production difficulties delayed deliveries to the Army until September 1937. Machine production began at Springfield Armory that month at a rate of ten rifles per day, and reached an output of 100 per day within two years. Despite going into production status, design issues were not at an end. The barrel, gas cylinder, and front sight assembly were redesigned and entered production in early 1940. Existing &quot;gas-trap&quot; rifles were recalled and retrofitted, mirroring problems with the earlier M1903 Springfield rifle that also had to be recalled and reworked approximately three years into production and foreshadowing rework of the M16 rifle at a similar point in its development. Production of the Garand increased in 1940 despite these difficulties, reaching 600 a day by 10 January 1941, and the Army was fully equipped by the end of 1941. Following the outbreak of World War II in Europe, Winchester was awarded an &quot;educational&quot; production contract for 65,000 rifles, with deliveries beginning in 1943.

===Service use===

The M1 Garand was made in large numbers during World War II; approximately 5.4 million were made. They were used by every branch of the United States military. The rifle generally performed well. General George S. Patton called it &quot;the greatest battle implement ever devised.&quot; The typical opponent of a US soldier during World War II was usually armed with a slower-firing bolt-action rifle (e.g. the Karabiner 98k for Germany, the Carcano M1891 for Italy, and the Type 38 or Type 99 Arisaka rifle for Japan). The effect of faster-firing infantry small arms in general soon stimulated both Allied and Axis forces to greatly increase their issue of semi- and fully automatic firearms then in production, as well as to develop new types of infantry firearms.

Many M1s were repaired or rebuilt after World War II. While U.S. forces were still engaged in the Korean War, the Department of Defense decided more were needed. Springfield Armory ramped up production, but two new contracts were awarded. During 1953–56, M1s were produced by International Harvester and Harrington &amp; Richardson in which International Harvester alone produced a total of 337,623 M1 Garands. A final, very small, lot of M1s was produced by Springfield Armory in early 1957, using finished components already on hand. Beretta also produced Garands using Winchester tooling.

In 1939, the British Army looked at the M1 as a possible replacement for its bolt-action Lee–Enfield No.1 Mk. III, but decided against it as by January 1940 the Birmingham Small Arms Company was already preparing production of the Lee-Enfield No. 4 Mk 1. However, surplus M1 rifles were provided as foreign aid to American allies, including South Korea, West Germany, Italy, Japan, Denmark, Greece, Turkey, Iran, South Vietnam, the Philippines, etc. Most Garands shipped to allied nations were predominantly manufactured by International Harvester Corporation during the period of 1953–1956, and second from Springfield Armory from all periods.

Some Garands were still being used by the United States into the Vietnam War in 1963; despite the M14&#x27;s official adoption in 1958, it was not until 1965 that the changeover from the M1 Garand was fully completed in the active-duty component of the Army (with the exception of the sniper variants, which were introduced in World War II and saw action in Korea and Vietnam). The Garand remained in service with the Army Reserve, Army National Guard, and the Navy into the early 1970s. The South Korean Army was using M1 Garands in the Vietnam War as late as 1966.

Due to widespread United States military assistance as well as their durability, M1 Garands have also been found in use in recent conflicts such as with the insurgencies in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Some military drill teams still use the M1 rifle, including the U.S. Marine Corps Silent Drill Team, the United States Air Force Academy Cadet Honor Guard, the U.S. Air Force Auxiliary, almost all Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) and some Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps (JROTC) teams of all branches of the U.S. military. It is also used by the drill team of His Majesty the King&#x27;s Guard of Norway.

==Design details==

===Features===
The M1 rifle is a .30 caliber, gas-operated, eight-shot clip-fed, semi-automatic rifle. It is long and it weighs about .

The M1&#x27;s safety catch is located at the front of the trigger guard, easily operated by the trigger finger. It is engaged when it is pressed rearward into the trigger guard, and disengaged when it is pushed forward and is protruding outside of the trigger guard.

The M1 Garand was designed for simple assembly and disassembly to facilitate field maintenance. It can be field stripped (broken down) without tools in just a few seconds.

The rifle has an iron sight line consisting of rear receiver aperture sight protected by sturdy &quot;ears&quot; calibrated for in increments. The bullet drop compensation is set by turning the range knob to the appropriate range setting. The bullet drop compensation/range knob can be fine adjusted by setting the rear sight elevation pinion. The elevation pinion can be fine adjusted in approximately one MOA increments. The aperture sight is also able to correct for wind drift operated by turning a windage knob that moves the sight in approximately one MOA increments. The windage lines on the receiver to indicate the windage setting are four MOA apart. The front sighting element consists of a wing-guard-protected front post.

During World War II the M1 rifle&#x27;s semiautomatic operation gave United States infantrymen a significant advantage in firepower and shot-to-shot recovery time over enemy infantrymen armed primarily with bolt-action rifles. The semi-automatic operation and reduced recoil allowed soldiers to fire eight rounds as quickly as they could pull the trigger, without having to move their hands on the rifle and therefore disrupt their firing position and point of aim. The Garand&#x27;s fire rate, in the hands of a trained soldier, averaged 40–50 accurate shots per minute at a range of 300 yards (270 m). &quot;At ranges over 500 yards (460 m), a battlefield target is hard for the average rifleman to hit. Therefore, 500 yards (460 m) is considered the maximum effective range, even though the rifle is accurate at much greater ranges.&quot;

===&quot;En bloc&quot; clip===


The M1 rifle is fed by a reversible &quot;en bloc&quot; clip which holds eight rounds of .30-06 Springfield ammunition. When the last cartridge is fired, the rifle ejects the clip and locks the bolt open. The M1 is then ready to reload. Once the clip is inserted, the bolt snaps forward on its own as soon as thumb pressure is released from the top round of the clip, chambering a round and leaving it ready to fire.

Contrary to widespread misconception, partially expended or full clips can be easily ejected from the rifle by means of the clip latch button. It is also possible to load single cartridges into a partially loaded clip while the clip is still in the magazine, but this requires both hands and a bit of practice. In reality, this procedure was rarely performed in combat, as the danger of getting debris inside the action along with the cartridges increased the chances of malfunction. Instead, it was much easier and quicker to simply manually eject the clip, and insert a fresh one, which is how the rifle was originally designed to be operated. Later, special clips holding two (8+2=10 for target shooting) or five rounds (to meet hunting regulations) became available on the civilian market, as well as a single-loading device which stays in the rifle when the bolt locks back.

In battle, the manual of arms called for the rifle to be fired until empty, and then recharged quickly. Due to the well-developed logistical system of the U.S. military at the time, this consumption of ammunition was generally not critical, though this could change in the case of units that came under intense fire or were flanked or surrounded by enemy forces. When using the rifle to launch grenades, it requires the removal of a partially loaded clip of ball ammunition and replacement with a clip of M3 rifle grenade cartridges.

Officials in Army Ordnance circles demanded a fixed, non-protruding magazine for the new service rifle. At the time, it was believed that a detachable magazine on a general-issue service rifle would be easily lost by U.S. soldiers (a criticism made of British soldiers and the Lee–Enfield dozens of years previously), would render the weapon too susceptible to clogging from dirt and debris and that a protruding magazine would complicate existing manual-of-arms drills. As a result, inventor John Garand developed an &quot;en bloc&quot; clip system that allowed ammunition to be inserted from above, clip included, into the fixed magazine. While this design provided the requisite flush-mount magazine, the clip system increased the rifle&#x27;s weight and complexity, and made only single loading ammunition possible without a clip.

Ejection of an empty clip created a distinctive metallic &quot;clanging&quot; sound. In World War II, it was rumored that German and Japanese infantry were making use of this noise in combat to alert them to an empty M1 rifle in order to catch their American enemies with an unloaded rifle. It was reported that the U.S. Army&#x27;s Aberdeen Proving Ground began experiments with clips made of various plastics in order to soften the sound, though no improved clips were ever adopted. Conversely, former German soldiers have said that the sound was inaudible during engagements and not particularly useful when heard, as other squad members might have been nearby ready to fire. Due to the often intense deafening noise of combat and gunfire it is highly unlikely any U.S. servicemen were killed as a result of being given away by the clang noise; however some soldiers still took the issue very seriously. Some U.S. veterans recalling combat in Europe are convinced that German soldiers did respond to the ejection clang, and would throw an empty clip down to simulate the sound so the enemy would expose themselves.

===Gas system===
Garand&#x27;s original design for the M1 used a complicated gas system involving a special muzzle extension gas trap, later dropped in mid-1940 in favor of a simpler drilled gas port. Because most of the older rifles were retrofitted, pre-1940 &quot;gas-trap&quot; M1s are very rare today and are prized collector&#x27;s items. In both systems, expanding gases from a fired cartridge are diverted into the gas cylinder. Here, the gases meet a long-stroke piston attached to the operating rod, which is pushed rearward by the force of this high-pressure gas. Then, the operating rod engages a rotating bolt inside the receiver. The bolt is locked into the receiver via two locking lugs, which rotate, unlock, and initiate the ejection of the spent cartridge and the reloading cycle when the rifle is discharged. The operating rod (and subsequently the bolt) then returns to its original position.

The M1 Garand was one of the first self-loading rifles to use stainless steel for its gas tube, in an effort to prevent corrosion. As the stainless metal could not be parkerized, the gas tubes were given a stove-blackening that frequently wore off in use. Unless the gas tube could be quickly repainted, the resultant gleaming muzzle could make the M1 Garand and its user more visible to the enemy in combat.

==Accessories==

Several accessories were used with the Garand rifle. Several different styles of bayonets fit the rifle: the M1905, with a 16-inch (406 mm) blade; the M1 with a 10-inch (254 mm) blade (either made standard or shortened from existing M1905 bayonets); and the M5 bayonet with a 6.75-inch (171 mm) blade.

Also available was the M7 grenade launcher that could easily be attached to the end of the barrel. It could be sighted using the M15 sight, which was attached with screws to the left side of the stock, just forward of the trigger.

A cleaning tool, oiler and grease containers could be stored in two cylindrical compartments in the buttstock for use in the field.

The M1907 two-piece leather rifle sling was the most common type of sling used with the weapon through World War II. In 1942, a cheaper and more adjustable olive drab canvas sling was introduced and gradually replaced the M1907 after the war.

Another accessory was the &quot;winter trigger&quot;, developed during the Korean War. It consisted of a small mechanism installed on the trigger guard, allowing the soldier to remotely pull the trigger by depressing a lever just behind the guard. This enabled the shooter to fire his weapon while using winter gloves, which could get &quot;stuck&quot; on the trigger guard or not allow for proper movement of the finger.

==Variants==
===Sniper models===

Most variants of the Garand, save the sniper variants, never saw active duty. The sniper versions were modified to accept scope mounts, and two versions (the &quot;M1C&quot;, formerly M1E7, and the &quot;M1D&quot;, formerly M1E8) were produced, although not in significant quantities during World War II. The only difference between the two versions is the mounting system for the telescopic sight. In June 1944, the M1C was adopted as a standard sniper rifle by the U.S. Army to supplement the venerable M1903A4, but few saw combat; wartime production was 7,971 M1Cs.

The procedure required to install the M1C-type mounts through drilling/tapping the hardened receiver reduced accuracy by warping the receiver. Improved methods to avoid reduction of accuracy were inefficient in terms of tooling and time. This resulted in the development of the M1D, which utilized a simpler, single-ring Springfield Armory mount attached to the barrel rather than the receiver. The M1C was first widely used during the Korean War. Korean War production was 4,796 M1Cs and 21,380 M1Ds; although few M1Ds were completed in time to see combat.

The U.S. Marine Corps adopted the M1C as their official sniper rifle in 1951. This USMC 1952 sniper&#x27;s rifle, or MC52, was an M1C with the commercial Stith Bear Cub scope manufactured by the Kollmorgen Optical Company under the military designation: telescopic sight - Model 4XD-USMC. The Kollmorgen scope with a slightly modified Griffin &amp; Howe mount was designated MC-1. The MC52 was also too late to see extensive combat in Korea, but it remained in Marine Corps inventories until replaced by bolt-action rifles during the Vietnam War. The U.S. Navy has also used the Garand, but rechambered for the popular at the time 7.62×51mm NATO round and calling it the M1 mod 0&amp;1.The Mod 0 has a metal bushing and during testing was prone to fail and fall out. The Mod 1 was fit with a new barrel; and a piece of plastic to make sure the user didn’t put the original 30-06 cartridge in the gun.
A detachable M2 conical flash hider, adopted 25 January 1945 slipped over the muzzle and was secured in place by the bayonet lug. A T37 flash hider was developed later. Flash hiders were of limited utility during low-light conditions around dawn and dusk, but were often removed as potentially detrimental to accuracy.

===Tanker models===
The &quot;Tanker&quot; name was invented after the war as a marketing gimmick for commercial Garands built on welded demilled receivers. There are three 18-inch M1 Garand variants, the M1E5 and T26, which never saw service, and the Pacific Warfare Board rifle, which saw very limited service in the Pacific. The M1E5 is equipped with a shorter 18-inch (457 mm) barrel and a folding buttstock. The T26 also uses an 18-inch (457 mm) barrel but retains the standard buttstock. The PWB rifle uses an 18-inch (457 mm) barrel, retains the standard buttstock, and has a foregrip secured by M1903 barrel band.

A weapon with those features was potentially valuable for paratroopers, as it was more powerful than the carbines and submachine guns currently in use. Preliminary testing revealed it had excessive recoil and muzzle blast, but it was recommended that it be developed further. The Infantry Board directed Col. Rene Studler to proceed with the project.

The task was assigned to Springfield Armory, and John Garand began work in January 1944. The resultant experimental arm, designated as the &quot;U.S. Carbine, Cal. 30, M1E5&quot;, was fitted with a specially made 18-inch barrel (not a shortened standard M1 rifle barrel) marked &quot;1 SA 2-44&quot; and a pantograph metal stock that folded underneath the rifle. The receiver was marked &quot;U.S. Carbine/Cal. .30 M1E5/Springfield/Armory/1&quot;. It was designated as a carbine and not a rifle.

Other than the folding stock, the basic M1 rifle was essentially unchanged with the exception of the short barrel, a correspondingly shortened operating rod (and spring) and the lack of a front handguard. The overall length was 37½ inches and it weighed approximately 8 lbs., 6 ozs.

The M1E5 &quot;Garand carbine&quot; was tested at Aberdeen Proving Ground in May 1944. It was determined that while accuracy at 300 yards was on par with the standard M1 rifle, recoil, muzzle blast and flash were excessive. It was recommended that a pistol grip be installed, which was done for subsequent testing.

While the M1E5 was more compact than the standard Garand rifle, the short barrel made it an unpleasant gun to fire—and the advantages were not judged to be sufficient to offset the disadvantages. Further development of the M1E5 was suspended as other projects at Springfield, such as the selective-fire T20 series, were deemed to have a higher priority. Only one example of the M1E5 was fabricated for testing, and the gun resides today in the Springfield Armory National Historic Site Museum.

Despite the concept being shelved at Springfield Armory, the idea of a shortened M1 rifle was still viewed as potentially valuable for airborne and jungle combat use. Particularly in the Pacific Theater, there was widespread dissatisfaction with the M1 carbine&#x27;s range, power and foliage-penetration (&quot;brush-cutting&quot;) capability. The Ordnance Department was not responsive to these complaints coming in from the Pacific and maintained that the M1 rifle and M1 carbine each filled a specific niche.

Nonetheless, by late 1944, the Pacific Warfare Board (PWB) decided to move forward with the development of a shortened M1 rifle. Colonel William Alexander, chief of the PWB, directed an Army ordnance unit of the 6th Army in the Philippines to fabricate 150 rifles in this configuration for testing. Since the previous M1E5 project was not widely disseminated, it is entirely possible that the PWB may not have been aware of Springfield Armory&#x27;s development of a similar rifle, and conceived the idea independently.

Some of the shortened M1 rifles were field-tested in October 1944 on Noemfoor Island, New Guinea, by an ad hoc test committee, which included three platoon leaders of the 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment (PIR) combat team. While the members of the test committee liked the concept of the short M1 rifle, it was determined that the muzzle blast was excessive and was compared to a flash bulb going off in the darkened jungle. The conclusion of the test report stated that the shortened rifle was &quot;totally unsuitable for a combat weapon&quot;.

Even while the shortened M1 rifles were being evaluated by the 503rd PIR, two of them were sent to the Ordnance Dept. in Washington, D.C., by special courier for evaluation. One of these rifles was then forwarded to Springfield Armory.

The M1s shortened in the Philippines under the auspices of the PWB had been well-used prior to modification, and the conversion exhibited rather crude craftsmanship, including hand-cut splines on the barrel.

Upon receipt of the PWB rifle, Springfield Armory&#x27;s model shop fabricated a very similar shortened M1 that was designated as the &quot;T26&quot;. One of the more noticeable differences was that the shortened PWB rifle had a cut-down front handguard (secured by an M1903 rifle barrel band), while the T26 rifle was not fitted with a front handguard. It had been determined that the full-length stock was superior to the M1E5&#x27;s folding stock, so the T26 used a standard M1 rifle stock.

The PWB rifle, serial No. 2437139, and Springfield Armory&#x27;s T26 were sent to Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG) on 26 July 1945, for testing. The APG report related that a standard M1 rifle, serial No. 1,032,921, was the &quot;control&quot; rifle to which the shorter rifle was compared during the testing. The results mirrored those of the M1E5&#x27;s previous testing. The test report found that the modified rifle&#x27;s muzzle flash, blast, and recoil were all significantly higher than that of the standard rifle. Additionally, it was less reliable, leading to it being declared &quot;totally unsuitable as a combat weapon&quot;. Nonetheless, in July 1945, 15,000 short M1 rifles were requested for use by airborne troops. The rifles were supposed to be produced within the next five months, but the procurement was canceled due to the Surrender of Japan in August 1945.

Springfield Armory made 637,420 more M1 rifles from 1952 to 1957 and contracts were met with two private firms. Harrington &amp; Richardson made 428,600 from 1953 to 1956 and International Harvester made 337,623 from 1953 to 1957. In total 5,468,772 M1 rifles were made from 1937 to 1957.

===T20E2===
Another variant that never saw duty was the T20E2. It was an experimental, gas-operated, selective fire rifle with a slightly longer receiver than the M1 and modified to accept 20-round Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR) magazines. The rifle was machined and tapped on the left side of the receiver for a scope mount, and included the same hardware for mounting a grenade launcher as the M1. The bolt had a hold-open device on the rear receiver bridge, as well as a fire selector similar to the M14. Full automatic fire was achieved by a connector assembly which was actuated by the operating rod handle. This, in turn, actuated a sear release or trip which, with the trigger held to the rear, disengaged the sear from the hammer lugs immediately after the bolt was locked. In automatic firing, the cyclic rate of fire was 700 rpm. When the connector assembly was disengaged, the rifle could only be fired semi-automatically and functioned in a manner similar to the M1 rifle. The T20 had an overall length of inches, a barrel length of 24 inches, and weighed 9.61 lb without accessories and 12.5 lb with bipod and empty magazine. It was designated as limited procurement in May 1945. Due to the cessation of hostilities with Japan, the number for manufacture was reduced to 100. The project was terminated in March 1948.

===Quick reference===
===Demilitarized versions===
Demilitarized models are rendered permanently inoperable, unless proper techniques, tools, and replacement parts are used to restore the rifle to safe operation. Their barrels have been drilled out to destroy the rifling. A steel rod is then inserted into the barrel and welded at both ends. Sometimes, their barrels are also filled with molten lead or solder. Their gas ports or operating system are also welded closed. Their barrels are then welded to their receivers to prevent replacement. Their firing pin holes are welded closed on the bolt face. As a result, they cannot be loaded with, much less fire live ammunition. However, they may still be used for demonstration or instructional purposes.

===Rechambered versions===
M1 Garands in Pakistan were found to be chambered in 7.92×57 mm due to a lack of .30-06 ammo in the country.

Modern Garands can be gunsmith built in several novel cartridges, with examples known up to .458 Winchester Magnum. While not common, 6.5×55mm Swedish barrels are occasionally available to convert with nothing more than a barrel change, though the en bloc clips are more difficult to load and often require a tool.

==Copies and postwar derivatives==

===Japanese Type 4===

The Type 4 Rifle, often referred to as the Type 5 Rifle (Japanese: 四式自動小銃 &quot;Yon-shiki jidousyoujyuu&quot;), was a Japanese prototype semi-automatic rifle. It was a copy of the American M1 Garand but with an integral 10-round magazine and chambered for the Japanese 7.7×58mm Arisaka cartridge. Where the Garand used an &quot;en bloc&quot; clip, the Type 4&#x27;s integral magazine was charged with two 5-round stripper clips and the rifle also used Japanese style tangent sights. The Type 4 had been developed alongside several other prototypical semi-automatic rifles. However, none of the rifles entered into service before the end of World War II, with only 250 being made and many others were never assembled. There were several problems with jamming and feed systems, which also delayed its testing.

===Beretta models===

During the 1950s, Beretta produced Garands in Italy at the behest of NATO, by having the tooling used by Winchester during World War II shipped to them by the U.S. government. These rifles were designated &quot;Model 1952&quot; in Italy. Using this tooling, Beretta developed the BM59 series of rifles. The BM59 was essentially a rechambered 7.62×51mm NATO caliber M1 fitted with a removable 20-round magazine, folding bipod and a combined flash suppressor-rifle grenade launcher. The BM59 is capable of selective fire. These rifles were produced under license in Indonesia as the &quot;SP-1&quot; series.

===M14 rifle===

The M14 rifle, officially the United States Rifle, 7.62 mm, M14, is an American selective fire automatic rifle that fires 7.62×51mm NATO (.308 Winchester) ammunition. The M14 rifle is basically an improved select-fire M1 Garand with a 20-round magazine.

===Ruger Mini-14===

Designed by L. James Sullivan and William B. Ruger, and produced by Sturm, Ruger &amp; Co. the Mini-14 rifle employs an investment cast, heat-treated receiver and a version of the M1/M14 rifle locking mechanism.

===Springfield Armory commercial production===

In 1982, years after the closure of the U.S. Springfield Armory in Springfield, MA, a commercial firm was created of the same name in Illinois– Springfield Armory, Inc. – began production of the M1 Rifle using a cast, heat-treated receiver with serial numbers in the 7,000,000+ range, along with commercially produced barrels (marked Geneseo, IL) and G.I. military surplus parts.

==Civilian use==

United States citizens meeting certain qualifications may purchase U.S. military surplus M1 rifles through the Civilian Marksmanship Program (CMP). The CMP is run by the Corporation for the Promotion of Rifle Practice and Firearms Safety (CPRPFS), a not-for-profit corporation chartered by the United States Congress in 1996 to instruct citizens in marksmanship and promote practice and safety in the use of firearms. The group holds a congressional charter under Title 36 of the United States Code. From 1903 to 1996, the CMP was sponsored by the Office of the Director of Civilian Marksmanship (DCM), a position first within the Department of War and later in the Department of the Army. The DCM was normally an active-duty Army colonel.

In 2009, an effort by the South Korean government to export about 850,000 firearms to the United States, including 87,000 M1 rifles, for eventual sale to civilians, was initially approved by the Obama administration, but it later blocked the sale in March 2010. A State Department spokesman said the administration&#x27;s decision was based on concerns that the guns could fall into the wrong hands and be used for criminal activity. However, in January 2012, the U.S. and South Korea agreed on the sale of 87,000 M1 Garand rifles, and the South Korean government entered into discussion with U.S. civilian arms dealers. Korea has sold tens of thousands of M1 Garand rifles to the U.S. civilian market between 1986 and 1994. In 2018, the CMP reported they had received a shipment of more than 90,000 M1 Garand rifles from the Philippines and also stated plans to restore many of those rifles for civilian sale.

In August 2013, the Obama administration banned future private importation of all U.S. made weapons, including the M1 Garand. This action did not preclude the return of surplus U.S. weapons, including M1 Garands, previously loaned by the U.S. to friendly nations, to the custody of the U.S. Government; in recent years, the CMP has received most of its surplus weapons through such returns from foreign countries. However, all civilian and military firearms imported into the U.S. after 30 January 2002, are required by federal law to have the name of the importer conspicuously stamped on the barrel, slide, or receiver of each weapon. This requirement significantly lowers a military weapon&#x27;s value relative to those without the importation markings as they distract from its original state.

Military surplus Garands and post-war copies made for the civilian market are popular among enthusiasts. In 2015, John F. Kennedy&#x27;s personal M1 Garand was auctioned by Rock Island Auction Company and sold for $149,500. This rifle was acquired by Kennedy in 1959 from the Director of Civilian Marksmanship and has the serial number 6086970.

<text>Nicholas Wulstan Park (born 6 December 1958) is an English filmmaker and animator who created &quot;Wallace &amp; Gromit&quot;, &quot;Creature Comforts&quot;, &quot;Chicken Run&quot;, &quot;Shaun the Sheep&quot;, and &quot;Early Man&quot;. Park has been nominated for an Academy Award seven times and won four with &quot;Creature Comforts&quot; (1989), &quot;The Wrong Trousers&quot; (1993), &quot;A Close Shave&quot; (1995) and &quot;Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit&quot; (2005).

He has also received seven BAFTA Awards, including the BAFTA for Best Short Animation for &quot;A Matter of Loaf and Death&quot;, which was believed to be the most-watched television programme in the United Kingdom in 2008. His 2000 film &quot;Chicken Run&quot; is the highest-grossing stop motion animated film.

In 1985 Park joined Aardman Animations, based in Bristol, and for his work in animation he was among the British cultural icons selected by artist Peter Blake to appear in a 2012 version of Blake&#x27;s most famous artwork - the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; album cover - to celebrate the British cultural figures of his life.

Park was appointed a CBE by Queen Elizabeth II in the 1997 Birthday Honours for &quot;services to the animated film industry&quot;.

== Early life ==
Nicholas Wulstan Park was born on 6 December 1958 in Preston, Lancashire, to seamstress Mary Cecilia (&quot;née&quot; Ashton; born 1930) and Roger Wulstan Park (1925–2004), an architectural photographer. The middle child of five siblings, he grew up in Penwortham; the family later moved to Walmer Bridge. His sister Janet lives in Longton, Lancashire. He attended Cuthbert Mayne High School (now Our Lady&#x27;s Catholic High School).

Park grew up with a keen interest in drawing cartoons, and as a 13-year-old, he made films with the help of his mother, her home film camera and cotton bobbins. He also took after his father, an amateur inventor, and would submit to &quot;Blue Peter&quot; homemade items such as a bottle that squeezed out different coloured wools.

He studied Communication Arts at Sheffield City Polytechnic (now Sheffield Hallam University) and then went to the National Film and Television School, where he started making the first Wallace and Gromit film, &quot;A Grand Day Out&quot;.

== Career ==
In 1985, Park joined the staff of Aardman Animations in Bristol, where he worked as an animator on commercial products (including the dance scene involving oven-ready chickens for the music video for Peter Gabriel&#x27;s &quot;Sledgehammer&quot;). He also had a part in animating the Penny cartoons from the first season of &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot;, which featured Paul Reubens as his character Pee-wee Herman.

Along with all this, he had finally completed &quot;A Grand Day Out&quot;, and with that in post-production, he made &quot;Creature Comforts&quot; as his contribution to a series of shorts called &quot;Lip Synch&quot;. &quot;Creature Comforts&quot; matched animated zoo animals with a soundtrack of people talking about their homes. The two films were nominated for a host of awards. &quot;A Grand Day Out&quot; beat &quot;Creature Comforts&quot; for the BAFTA Award, but it was &quot;Creature Comforts&quot; that won Park his first Oscar.

In 1990, Park worked alongside advertising agency GGK to develop a series of highly acclaimed television advertisements for the &quot;Heat Electric&quot; campaign. The &quot;Creature Comforts&quot; advertisements are now regarded as among the best advertisements ever shown on British television, as voted (independently) by viewers of the United Kingdom&#x27;s main commercial channels ITV and Channel 4.

Two more Wallace and Gromit shorts, &quot;The Wrong Trousers&quot; (1993) and &quot;A Close Shave&quot; (1995), followed, both winning Oscars. He then made his first feature-length film, &quot;Chicken Run&quot; (2000), co-directed with Aardman founder Peter Lord. He also supervised a new series of &quot;Creature Comforts&quot; films for British television in 2003.
His second theatrical feature-length film and first Wallace and Gromit feature, &quot;Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit&quot;, was released on 5 October 2005, and won Best Animated Feature Oscar at the 78th Academy Awards, 6 March 2006.

On 10 October 2005, a fire gutted one of Aardman Animations&#x27; archive warehouses. The fire resulted in the loss of some of Park&#x27;s creations, including the models and sets used in the movie &quot;Chicken Run&quot;. Some of the original Wallace and Gromit models and sets, as well as the master prints of the finished films, were elsewhere and survived.

In 2007 and 2008, Park&#x27;s work included a United States version of &quot;Creature Comforts&quot;, a weekly television series that was on CBS every Monday evening at 8 pm ET. In the series, Americans were interviewed about a range of subjects. The interviews were lip-synced to Aardman animal characters.

In September 2007, it was announced that Park had been commissioned to design a bronze statue of Wallace and Gromit, which will be placed in his home town of Preston. In October 2007, it was announced that the BBC had commissioned another Wallace and Gromit short film to be entitled &quot;Trouble at Mill&quot; (retitled later to &quot;A Matter of Loaf and Death&quot;).

Park studied at Preston College, which has since named its library for the art and design department after him: the Nick Park Library Learning Centre. He is the recipient of a gold &quot;Blue Peter&quot; badge.

By the beginning of 2010, Park had won four Academy Awards, and had the distinction of having won an Academy Award every time he had been nominated (his only loss being when he was nominated twice in the same category). This streak ended in the 2010 Oscars when &quot;A Matter of Loaf and Death&quot; failed to win the best animated short Academy Award.

Park had his first acting role in February 2011, voicing himself in a cameo on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Angry Dad: The Movie&quot;. In the episode, the fictional Park&#x27;s new Willis and Crumble short, &quot;Better Gnomes and Gardens&quot;, is a parody of &quot;Wallace and Gromit&quot;.

In the end of 2011, Park directed a music video for &quot;Plain Song&quot;—a song by Native and the Name, a Sheffield band led by Joe Rose, the son of an old university friend. The video was filmed at Birkdale School, Sheffield, and Park also selected the track as one of his &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; when he went on the show in 2011, which led to suggestions that Park was using his fame to give a friend a leg up in his career. Park denied these claims, insisting it had become one of his favourite songs. The song and video can be found on YouTube.

In April 2013, Park was involved in the British stage adaptation of Hayao Miyazaki&#x27;s animated film, &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot;. He was the executive producer of &quot;Shaun the Sheep Movie&quot; and he also voiced himself in a cameo.

For 2018, he directed another Aardman Animations stop-motion film, titled &quot;Early Man&quot;, which tells a story of a caveman who unites his tribe against the Bronze Age while unintentionally inventing football.

On 21 May 2019, Park announced that a new Wallace and Gromit project was currently in the works, with no projected release date. In January 2022, Park announced that the project was currently in production as a television film for release in 2024 for the BBC and Netflix. The film, &quot;Wallace &amp; Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl&quot;, was first shown on BBC One on Christmas Day 2024, and also featured the return of &quot;Wrong Trousers&quot; villain Feathers McGraw.

== Personal life ==
&quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; remarked Park has taken on some attributes of Wallace, just &quot;as dog owners come to look like their pets&quot;, overexpressing himself, possibly as a result of having to show animators how he wants his characters to behave.

Park married Mags Connolly at the Gibbon Bridge Hotel near Chipping on 16 September 2016. Although by his own admission, he was not especially interested in football growing up, he has always nominally supported his hometown&#x27;s local team, Preston North End.

==Honours==
In 1996 he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Bath.

On 25 October 1997, Park was awarded the Honorary Freedom of Preston, his home town (now city), which is the highest award a Council can bestow on an individual.

In 2016, and following a vote by students on a number of nominated &#x27;Preston Legends&#x27;, the University of Central Lancashire named one of three new meeting rooms in the students&#x27; union after Park, who was born in the city where it is based. In response, Park sent the university a message to say how honoured he was by it.

==Influences==
Nick Park has stated that his main influences have been Ray Harryhausen, Oliver Postgate, Peter Firmin, Chuck Jones, Hayao Miyazaki, Yuri Norstein, Richard Williams, Terry Gilliam, and Bob Godfrey. He was inspired by Gilliam&#x27;s animation in Monty Python &quot;to be a bit wacky and off the wall.&quot; He is a fan of Gerry Anderson, known for &quot;Supermarionation&quot; as seen in &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;.

He is a fan of &quot;The Beano&quot; comic, and guest-edited the 70th-anniversary issue dated 2 August 2008. He stated, &quot;My dream job was always to work on &quot;The Beano&quot; and it&#x27;s such an honour for me to be Guest Editor.&quot; He also contributed to &quot;Classics from the Comics&quot; at the same time, picking his favourite classic stories for the comic reprint magazine&#x27;s new Classic Choice feature.

His film-making ideas were encouraged by his old English teacher; however, Park has denied that the character of Wallace was based on him.

<doc id="149058" wikidata="Q391752" url="?curid=149058" title="Bulletproof vest">
<text>A bulletproof vest, also known as a ballistic vest or bullet-resistant vest, is a type of body armor designed to absorb impact and prevent the penetration of firearm projectiles and explosion fragments to the torso. The vest can be either soft—as worn by police officers, security personnel, prison guards, and occasionally private citizens to protect against stabbing attacks or light projectiles—or hard, incorporating metallic or para-aramid components. Soldiers and police tactical units typically wear hard armour, either alone or combined with soft armour, to protect against rifle ammunition or fragmentation. Additional protection includes trauma plates for blunt force and ceramic inserts for high-caliber rounds. Bulletproof vests have evolved over centuries, from early designs like those made for knights and military leaders to modern-day versions. Early ballistic protection used materials like cotton and silk, while contemporary vests employ advanced fibers and ceramic plates. Ongoing research focuses on improving materials and effectiveness against emerging threats.

==History==
===Early modern era===
In 1538, Duke Francesco Maria della Rovere, a condottiero, commissioned Filippo Negroli to create a bulletproof vest. In 1561, Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor is recorded as testing his armour against gun-fire. Similarly, in 1590 Henry Lee of Ditchley expected his Greenwich armour to be &quot;pistol proof&quot;. Its actual effectiveness was controversial at the time.

During the English Civil War, Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s Ironside cavalry were equipped with lobster-tailed pot helmet and musket-proof cuirasses which consisted of two layers of armour plating. The outer layer was designed to absorb the bullet&#x27;s energy and the thicker inner layer stopped further penetration. The armour would be left badly dented but still serviceable.

===Industrial era===
One of the first examples of commercially sold bulletproof armour was produced by a tailor in Dublin in the 1840s. &quot;The Cork Examiner&quot; reported on his line of business in December 1847.
Another soft ballistic vest, Myeonje baegab, was invented in Joseon Korea in the 1860s shortly after the punitive 1866 French expedition to Korea. The regent of Joseon ordered the development of bulletproof armour because of increasing threats from Western armies. Kim Gidu and Gang Yun found that cotton could protect against bullets if 10 layers of cotton fabric were used. The vests were used in battle during the United States expedition to Korea, when the US Navy attacked Ganghwa Island in 1871. The US Navy captured one of the vests and took it to the US, where it was stored at the Smithsonian Museum until 2007. The vest has since been sent back to Korea and is currently on display to the public.

Simple ballistic armor was sometimes constructed by criminals. In 1880, a gang of Australian bushrangers led by Ned Kelly devised their own suits of bulletproof armour. The suits had a mass of around and were fashioned from stolen plough mouldboards, most likely in a crude bush forge and possibly with the assistance of blacksmiths. With a cylindrical helmet and apron, the armour protected the wearer&#x27;s head, torso, upper arms, and upper legs. In June 1880, the four outlaws wore the suits in a gunfight with the police, during which Kelly survived at least 18 bullets striking his armour.

In the 1890s, American outlaw and gunfighter Jim Miller was infamous for wearing a steel breastplate under his frock coat as a form of body armor. This plate saved Miller on two occasions, and it proved to be highly resistant to pistol bullets and shotguns. One example can be seen in his gun battle with a sheriff named George A. &quot;Bud&quot; Frazer, where the plate managed to deflect all bullets from the lawman&#x27;s revolver.
In 1881, the Tombstone, Arizona physician George E. Goodfellow noticed that Charlie Storms, who was shot twice by faro dealer Luke Short, had one bullet stopped by a silk handkerchief in his breast pocket that prevented that bullet from penetrating. In 1887, he wrote an article titled &quot;Impenetrability of Silk to Bullets&quot; for the &quot;Southern California Practitioner&quot; documenting the first known instance of bulletproof fabric. He experimented with silk vests resembling gambesons that used 18 to 30 layers of silk to protect the wearers from penetration.

Kazimierz Żegleń used Goodfellow&#x27;s findings to develop a silk bulletproof vest at the end of the 19th century, which could stop the relatively slow rounds from black powder handguns. The vests cost US$800 each in 1914, .

A similar vest made by Polish inventor Jan Szczepanik in 1901 saved the life of Alfonso XIII of Spain when he was shot by an attacker. By 1900, US gangsters were wearing $800 silk vests to protect themselves.

===First World War===

The combatants of World War I started the war without any attempt at providing the soldiers with body armor. Various private companies advertised body protection suits such as the Birmingham Chemico Body Shield, although these products were generally far too expensive for an average soldier.

The first official attempts at commissioning body armor were made in 1915 by the British Army Design Committee, Trench Warfare Section in particular a &#x27;Bomber&#x27;s Shield&#x27;; &quot;bomber&quot; being the term for those who threw grenades rather than grenadier. The Experimental Ordnance Board also reviewed potential materials for bullet and fragment proof armor, such as steel plate. A &#x27;necklet&#x27; was successfully issued on a small scale (due to cost considerations), which protected the neck and shoulders from bullets traveling at with interwoven layers of silk and cotton stiffened with resin. The Dayfield body shield entered service in 1916 and a hardened breastplate was introduced the following year.

The British army medical services calculated towards the end of the War that three quarters of all battle injuries could have been prevented if an effective armor had been issued.

The French experimented with steel visors attached to the Adrian helmet and &#x27;abdominal armor&#x27; designed by General Adrian, in addition to shoulder &quot;epaulets&quot; to protect from falling debris and darts. These failed to be practical, because they severely impeded the soldier&#x27;s mobility. The Germans officially issued body armor in the form of nickel and silicon armor plates that was called &quot;sappenpanzer&quot; (nicknamed &#x27;Lobster armor&#x27;) from late 1916. These were similarly too heavy to be practical for the rank-and-file, but were used by static units, such as sentries and occasionally machine-gunners. An improved version, the Infanterie-Panzer, was introduced in 1918, with hooks for equipment.

The United States developed several types of body armor, including the chrome nickel steel Brewster Body Shield, which consisted of a breastplate and a headpiece and could withstand Lewis Gun bullets at , but was clumsy and heavy at . A scaled waistcoat of overlapping steel scales fixed to a leather lining was also designed; this armor weighed , fit close to the body, and was considered more comfortable.

===Interwar period===

During the late 1920s through the early 1930s, gunmen from criminal gangs in the United States began wearing less-expensive vests made from thick layers of cotton padding and cloth. These early vests could absorb the impact of handgun rounds such as .22 Long Rifle, .25 ACP, .32 S&amp;W Long, .32 S&amp;W, .380 ACP, .38 Special and .45 ACP traveling at speeds of up to . To overcome these vests, law enforcement agents began using the newer and more powerful .38 Super, and later the .357 Magnum cartridge.

===Second World War===
In 1940, the Medical Research Council in Britain proposed the use of a lightweight suit of armour for general use by infantry, and a heavier suit for troops in more dangerous positions, such as anti-aircraft and naval gun crews. By February 1941, trials had begun on body armour made of mangalloy plates. Two plates covered the front area and one plate on the lower back protected the kidneys and other vital organs. Five thousand sets were made and evaluated to almost unanimous approval – as well as providing adequate protection, the armour didn&#x27;t severely impede the mobility of the soldier and were reasonably comfortable to wear. The armor was introduced in 1942 although the demand for it was later scaled down. In northwestern Europe, The 2nd Canadian Division during World War II also adopted this armour for medical personnel.

The British company Wilkinson Sword began to produce flak jackets for bomber crews in 1943 under contract with the Royal Air Force. The majority of pilot deaths in the air were due to low-velocity fragments rather than bullets. The Surgeon General of the United States Air Force, Colonel M. C. Grow, who was stationed in Britain, thought that many wounds he was treating could have been prevented by some kind of light armor. Two types of armor were issued for different specifications. These jackets were made of nylon and capable of stopping flak and fragmentation, but were not designed to stop bullets. Although they were considered too bulky for pilots using the Avro Lancaster, they were adopted by the United States Army Air Forces.

In the early stages of World War II, the United States also designed body armor for infantrymen, but most models were too heavy and mobility-restricting to be useful in the field and incompatible with existing required equipment. Near the middle of 1944, development of infantry body armor in the United States restarted. Several vests were produced for the US military, including but not limited to the T34, the T39, the T62E1, and the M12. The United States developed a vest using doron plate, a fiberglass-based fibre-reinforced plastic. These vests were first used in the Battle of Okinawa in 1945.
The Soviet Armed Forces used several types of body armour, including the SN-42 (from &quot;Stalnoi Nagrudnik&quot;, Russian for &quot;steel breastplate&quot; and the number denotes the design year). All were tested, but only the SN-42 was put in production. It consisted of two pressed steel plates that protected the front torso and groin. The plates were 2 mm thick and weighed 3.5 kg (7.7 lb). This armour was generally supplied to assault engineers (SHISBr) and &quot;tank desantniki&quot;. The SN armour protected wearers from 9×19mm bullets fired by an MP 40 submachine gun at around , and sometimes it was able to deflect 7.92 Mauser rifle bullets (and bayonet blades), but only at very low angle. This made it useful in urban battles such as the Battle of Stalingrad. However, the SN&#x27;s weight made it impractical for infantry in the open. Some apocryphal accounts note point blank deflection of 9mm bullets, and testing of similar armour supports this theory.

===Postwar===
During the Korean War several new vests were produced for the United States military, including the M-1951, which made use of fibre-reinforced plastic or aluminium segments woven into a nylon vest. These vests represented &quot;a vast improvement on weight, but the armor failed to stop bullets and fragments very successfully,&quot; although officially they were claimed to be able to stop 7.62×25mm Tokarev pistol rounds at the muzzle. Such vests equipped with Doron Plate have, in informal testing, defeated .45 ACP handgun ammunition. Developed by Natick Laboratories (now the Combat Capabilities Development Command Soldier Center) and introduced in 1967, T65-2 plate carriers were the first vests designed to hold hard ceramic plates, making them capable of stopping 7 mm rifle rounds.

These &quot;Chicken Plates&quot; were made of either boron carbide, silicon carbide, or aluminium oxide. They were issued to the crew of low-flying aircraft, such as the UH-1 and UC-123, during the Vietnam War.

Conscious of US developments during the Korean War, the Soviet Union also began the development of body armour for its troops, resulting in the adoption of the 6b1 vest in 1957. This marked a shift away from previous systems like the SN-42, which relied on large, monolithic plates that were inflexible and substantially affected a soldier&#x27;s balance. The 6b1, and all subsequent Soviet body armour, would rely upon ballistic-fabric wrapped plates, initially steel and later titanium and boron carbide. Between 1957 and 1958, anywhere between 1500 and 5000 6b1 vests were produced, but they were subsequently put in storage and not issued until the early years of the Soviet–Afghan War, where they were used in limited quantities, and were able to resist shrapnel and Tokarev rounds.

In 1969, American Body Armor was founded and began to produce a patented combination of quilted nylon faced with multiple steel plates. This armor configuration was marketed to American law enforcement agencies by Smith &amp; Wesson under the trade name &quot;Barrier Vest.&quot; The Barrier Vest was the first police vest to gain wide use during high-threat police operations.

In 1971, research chemist Stephanie Kwolek discovered a liquid crystalline polymer solution. Its exceptional strength and stiffness led to the invention of Kevlar, a synthetic fibre, woven into a fabric and layered, that, by weight, has five times the tensile strength of steel. In the mid-1970s, DuPont, the company which employed Kwolek, introduced Kevlar. Immediately Kevlar was incorporated into a National Institute of Justice (NIJ) evaluation program to provide lightweight, able body armour to a test pool of American law enforcement officers to ascertain if everyday able wearing was possible. Lester Shubin, a program manager at the NIJ, managed this law enforcement feasibility study within a few selected large police agencies and quickly determined that Kevlar body armor could be comfortably worn by police daily, and would save lives.

In 1975 Richard A. Armellino, the founder of American Body Armor, marketed an all Kevlar vest called the K-15, consisting of 15 layers of Kevlar that also included a 5&quot; × 8&quot; ballistic steel &quot;Shok Plate&quot; positioned vertically over the heart and was issued US Patent #3,971,072 for this innovation. Similarly sized and positioned &quot;trauma plates&quot; are still used today on most vests, reducing blunt trauma and increasing ballistic protection in the center-mass heart/sternum area.

In 1976, Richard Davis, founder of Second Chance Body Armor, designed the company&#x27;s first all-Kevlar vest, the Model Y. The lightweight, able vest industry was launched and a new form of daily protection for the modern police officer was quickly adopted. By the mid-to-late 1980s, an estimated 1/3 to 1/2 of police patrol officers wore able vests daily. By 2006, more than 2,000 documented police vest &quot;saves&quot; were recorded, validating the success and efficiency of lightweight able body armor as a standard piece of everyday police equipment.

===Recent years===

During the 1980s, the US military issued the PASGT kevlar vest, tested privately at NIJ level IIA by several sources, able to stop pistol rounds (including 9 mm FMJ), but intended and approved only for fragmentation. West Germany issued a similar rated vest called the Splitterschutzweste.

During the early 1980s, body armor vests began to see widespread use by several countries in addition to more prolific users like the US and UK. Following the 1982 Israeli intervention during the Lebanese Civil War, body armor was widely issued to Israeli troops as well as European peacekeepers and to a lesser degree, by Syrian troops. During the Soviet-Afghan war the obsolete 6b1 was rapidly replaced by the 6b2, which was issued from 1980 onward and by 1983 was issued to the vast majority of the 40th army.

Kevlar soft armor had its shortcomings because if &quot;large fragments or high velocity bullets hit the vest, the energy could cause life-threatening, blunt trauma injuries&quot; in selected, vital areas. Ranger Body Armor was developed for the American military in 1991. Although it was the second modern US body armor that was able to stop rifle caliber rounds and still be light enough to be worn by infantry soldiers in the field, (first being the ISAPO, or Interim Small Arms Protective Overvest,) it still had its flaws: &quot;it was still heavier than the concurrently issued PASGT (Personal Armor System for Ground Troops) anti-fragmentation armor worn by regular infantry and ... did not have the same degree of ballistic protection around the neck and shoulders.&quot; The format of Ranger Body Armor (and more recent body armor issued to US special operations units) highlights the trade-offs between force protection and mobility that modern body armor forces organizations to address.
Newer armor issued by the United States armed forces to large numbers of troops includes the United States Army&#x27;s Improved Outer Tactical Vest and the United States Marine Corps Modular Tactical Vest. All of these systems are designed with the vest intended to provide protection from fragments and pistol rounds. Hard ceramic plates, such as the Small Arms Protective Insert, as used with Interceptor Body Armor, are worn to protect the vital organs from higher level threats. These threats mostly take the form of high velocity and armor-piercing rifle rounds. Similar types of protective equipment have been adopted by modern armed forces over the world.
Since the 1970s, several new fibers and construction methods for bulletproof fabric have been developed besides woven Kevlar, such as DSM&#x27;s Dyneema, Honeywell&#x27;s Gold Flex and Spectra, Teijin Aramid&#x27;s Twaron, Pinnacle Armor&#x27;s Dragon Skin, and Toyobo&#x27;s Zylon. The US military has developed body armor for the working dogs who aid soldiers in battle.

==Performance standards==

Due to the various types of projectile, it is often inaccurate to refer to a particular product as &quot;bulletproof&quot; because this implies that it will protect against any and all threats. Instead, the term bullet resistant is generally preferred. Vest specifications will typically include both penetration resistance requirements and limits on the amount of impact force that is delivered to the body. Even without penetration, heavy bullets can deal enough force to cause blunt force trauma under the impact point. On the other hand, some bullets can penetrate the vest, but deal low damage to its wearer due to the loss of speed or small/reduced mass/form. Armour piercing ammunition tends to have poor terminal ballistics due to it being specifically not intended to fragment or expand.

Body armor standards are regional. Around the world ammunition varies and as a result the armor testing must reflect the threats found locally. Law enforcement statistics show that many shootings where officers are injured or killed involve the officer&#x27;s own weapon. As a result, each law enforcement agency or para-military organization will have their own standard for armor performance if only to ensure that their armor protects them from their own weapons.

While many standards exist, a few standards are widely used as models. The US National Institute of Justice ballistic and stab documents are examples of broadly accepted standards. In addition to the NIJ, the UK Home Office Scientific Development Branch (HOSDB – formerly the Police Scientific Development Branch (PSDB)) and VPAM (German acronym for the Association of Laboratories for Bullet Resistant Materials And Constructions), originally from Germany, are other widely accepted standards. In the Russian area, the GOST standard is dominant.

==Soft and hard armor==

Modern body armor is generally split into one of two categories: soft armor and hard armor. Soft armor is typically made of woven fabrics, like Dyneema or Kevlar, and usually provides protection against fragmentation and handgun threats. Hard armor usually refers to ballistic plates; these hardened plates are designed to defend against rifle threats, in addition to the threats covered by soft armor.

===Soft armor===
Soft armour is usually made of woven fabrics (synthetic or natural) and protects up to NIJ level IIIA. Soft armour can be worn stand-alone or can be combined with hard armor as part of an &quot;In-Conjunction&quot; armor system. In these in-conjunction systems, a soft armor &quot;plate backer&quot; is usually placed behind the ballistic plate and the combination of soft and hard armor provides the designated level of protection.

=== Hard armor ===
Broadly, there are three basic types of hard armor ballistic plates: ceramic plate-based systems, steel plate with spall fragmentation protective coating (or backer), and hard fiber-based laminate systems. These hard armor plates may be designed to be used stand-alone or &quot;In-Conjunction&quot; with soft armor backers, also called &quot;plate backers&quot;.

Many systems contain both hard ceramic components and laminated textile materials used together. Various ceramic materials types are in use, however: aluminum oxide, boron carbide and silicon carbide are the most common. The fibers used in these systems are the same as found in soft textile armor. However, for rifle protection, high pressure lamination of ultra high molecular weight polyethylene with a Kraton matrix is the most common.

The Small Arms Protective Insert (SAPI) and the enhanced SAPI plate for the United States Department of Defense generally has this form. Due to the use of ceramic plates for rifle protection, these vests are 5–8 times as heavy on an area basis as handgun protection. The weight and stiffness of rifle armor is a major technical challenge. Density, hardness and impact toughness are among the materials properties that are balanced to design these systems. While ceramic materials have some outstanding properties for ballistics, they have poor fracture toughness. Failure of ceramic plates by cracking must also be controlled. For this reason many ceramic rifle plates are a composite. The strike face is ceramic with the backface formed of laminated fiber and resin materials. The hardness of the ceramic prevents the penetration of the bullet while the tensile strength of the fiber backing helps prevent tensile failure. The U.S. military&#x27;s Small Arms Protective Insert family is a well-known example of these plates.

When a ceramic plate is shot, it cracks in the vicinity of the impact, which reduces the protection in this area. Although NIJ 0101.06 requires a Level III plate to stop six rounds of 7.62×51mm M80 ball ammunition, it imposes a minimum distance between shots of 2.0 inches (51mm); if two rounds impact the plate closer than this requirement permits, it may result in a penetration. To counter this, some plates, such as the Ceradyne Model AA4 and IMP/ACT (Improved Multi-hit Performance/Advanced Composite Technology) series, use a stainless steel crack arrestor embedded between the strike face and backer. This layer contains cracks in the strike face to the immediate area around an impact, resulting in markedly improved multi-hit ability; in conjunction with NIJ IIIA soft armor, a 3.9 lb IMP/ACT plate can stop eight rounds of 5.56×45mm M995, and a 4.2 lb plate such as the MH3 CQB can stop either ten rounds of 5.56×45mm M995 or six rounds of 7.62×39mm BZ API.

The standards for armor-piercing rifle bullets are not clear-cut, because the penetration of a bullet depends on the hardness of the target armor, and the armor type. However, there are a few general rules. For example, bullets with a soft lead-core and copper jacket are too easily deformed to penetrate hard materials, whereas rifle bullets intended for maximum penetration into hard armor are nearly always manufactured with high-hardness core materials such as tungsten carbide. Most other core materials would have effects between lead and tungsten carbide. Many common bullets, such as the 7.62×39mm M43 standard cartridge for the AK-47/AKM rifle, have a steel core with hardness rating ranging from Rc35 mild steel up to Rc45 medium hard steel. However, there is a caveat to this rule: with regards to penetration, the hardness of a bullet&#x27;s core is significantly less important than the sectional density of that bullet. This is why there are many more bullets made with tungsten instead of tungsten carbide.

Additionally, as the hardness of the bullet core increases, so must the amount of ceramic plating used to stop penetration. Like in soft ballistics, a minimum ceramic material hardness of the bullet core is required to damage their respective hard core materials, however in armor-piercing rounds the bullet core is eroded rather than deformed.

The US Department of Defense uses several hard armor plates. The first, the Small Arms Protective Insert (SAPI), called for ceramic composite plates with a mass of 20–30 kg/m2 (4–5 lb/ft2). SAPI plates have a black fabric cover with the text &quot;7.62mm M80 Ball Protection&quot;; as expected, they are required to stop three rounds of 7.62×51mm M80 ball, with the plate tilted thirty degrees towards the shooter for the third shot; this practice is common for all three-hit-protective plates in the SAPI series. Later, the Enhanced SAPI (ESAPI) specification was developed to protect from more penetrative ammunition. ESAPI ceramic plates have a green fabric cover with the text &quot;7.62mm APM2 Protection&quot; on the back and a density of 35–45 kg/m2 (7–9 lb/ft2); they are designed to stop bullets like the .30-06 AP (M2) with a hardened steel core. Depending on revision, the plate may stop more than one. Since the issuance of CO/PD 04-19D on January 14, 2007, ESAPI plates are required to stop three rounds of M2AP. The plates may be differentiated by the text &quot;REV.&quot; on the back, followed by a letter. A few years after the fielding of the ESAPI, the Department of Defense began to issue XSAPI plates in response to a perceived threat of AP projectiles in Iraq and Afghanistan. Over 120,000 inserts were procured; however, the AP threats they were meant to stop never materialized, and the plates were put into storage. XSAPI plates are required to stop three rounds of either the 7.62×51mm M993 or 5.56×45mm M995 tungsten-carbide armor-piercing projectiles (like newer ESAPIs, the third shot occurs with the plate tilted towards the shooter), and are distinguished by a tan cover with the text &quot;7.62mm AP/WC Protection&quot; on the back.

Cercom (now BAE Systems), CoorsTek, Ceradyne, TenCate Advanced Composites, Honeywell, DSM, Pinnacle Armor and a number of other engineering companies develop and manufacture the materials for composite ceramic rifle armor.

Body armor standards in the Russian Federation, as established in GOST R 50744-95, differ significantly from American standards, on account of a different security situation. The 7.62×25mm Tokarev round is a relatively common threat in Russia and is known to be able to penetrate NIJ IIIA soft armor. Armor protection in the face of the large numbers of these rounds, therefore, necessitates higher standards. GOST armor standards are more stringent than those of the NIJ with regards to protection and blunt impact.

For example, one of the highest protection level, GOST 6A, requires the armor to withstand three 7.62×54mmR B32 API hits fired from 5.10m away with 16mm of back-face deformation (BFD). NIJ Level IV-rated armor is only required to stop 1 hit of .30–06, or 7.62×63mm, M2AP with 44mm BFD.

===Trauma plates===
Trauma plates, also called trauma pads, are inserts or pads which are placed behind ballistic armour plates/panels and serve to reduce the blunt force trauma absorbed by the body; they do not necessarily have any ballistic protective properties. While an armour system (hard or soft) may stop a projectile from penetrating, the projectile may still cause significant indentation and deformation of the armour, also called backface deformation. Trauma plates help protect against damage to the body from this backface deformation. Trauma plates should not be confused with soft armor or with ballistic plates, both of which do inherently provide ballistic protection.

==Explosive protection==

Bomb disposal officers often wear heavy armor designed to protect against most effects of a moderate sized explosion, such as bombs encountered in terror threats. Full head helmet, covering the face and some degree of protection for limbs is mandatory in addition to very strong armor for the torso. An insert to protect the spine is usually applied to the back, in case an explosion throws the wearer. Visibility and mobility of the wearer is severely limited, as is the time that can be spent working on the device. Armor designed primarily to counter explosives is often somewhat less effective against bullets than armor designed for that purpose. The sheer mass of most bomb disposal armor usually provides some protection, and bullet-specific armor plates are compatible with some bomb disposal suits. Bomb disposal technicians try to accomplish their task if possible using remote methods (e.g., robots, line and pulleys). Actually laying hands on a bomb is only done in an extremely life-threatening situation, where the hazards to people and critical structures cannot be lessened by using wheeled robots or other techniques.

It is notable that despite the protection offered, much of it is in fragmentation. According to some sources, overpressure from ordnance beyond the charge of a typical hand grenade can overwhelm a bomb suit.

In some media, an EOD suit is portrayed as a heavily armoured bulletproof suit capable of ignoring explosions and gunfire; in real life, this is not the case, as much of a bomb suit is made up of only soft armor.

==Stab and stab-ballistic armor==
===Early &quot;ice pick&quot; test===
In the mid-1980s the state of California Department of Corrections issued a requirement for a body armor using a commercial ice pick as the test penetrator. The test method attempted to simulate the capacity of a human attacker to deliver impact energy with their upper body. As was later shown by the work of the former British PSDB, this test overstated the capacity of human attackers. The test used a drop mass or sabot that carried the ice pick. Using gravitational force, the height of the drop mass above the vest was proportional to the impact energy. This test specified 109 joules (81 ft·lb) of energy and a 7.3 kg (16 lb) drop mass with a drop height of 153 cm (60 in).

The ice pick has a 4 mm (0.16 in) diameter with a sharp tip with a 5.4 m/s (17 ft/s) terminal velocity in the test. The California standard did not include knife or cutting-edge weapons in the test protocol. The test method used the oil/clay (Roma Plastilena) tissue simulant as a test backing. In this early phase only titanium and steel plate offerings were successful in addressing this requirement. Point Blank developed the first ice pick certified offerings for CA Department of Corrections in shaped titanium sheet metal. Vests of this type are still in service in US corrections facilities as of 2008.

Beginning in the early 1990s, an optional test method was approved by California which permitted the use of 10% ballistic gelatin as a replacement for Roma clay. The transition from hard, dense clay-based Roma to soft low-density gelatin allowed all textile solutions to meet this attack energy requirement. Soon all textile &quot;ice pick&quot; vests began to be adopted by California and other US states as a result of this migration in the test methods. It is important for users to understand that the smooth, round tip of the ice pick does not cut fiber on impact and this permits the use of textile based vests for this application.

The earliest of these &quot;all&quot; fabric vests designed to address this ice pick test was Warwick Mills&#x27;s TurtleSkin ultra tightly woven para-aramid fabric with a patent filed in 1993. Shortly after the TurtleSkin work, in 1995 DuPont patented a medium density fabric that was designated as Kevlar Correctional. These textile materials do not have equal performance with cutting-edge threats and these certifications were only with ice pick and were not tested with knives.

===HOSDB-Stab and Slash standards===
Parallel to the US development of &quot;ice pick&quot; vests, the British police, PSDB, was working on standards for knife-resistant body armor. Their program adopted a rigorous scientific approach and collected data on human attack capacity. Their ergonomic study suggested three levels of threat: 25, 35 and 45 joules of impact energy. In addition to impact energy attack, velocities were measured and were found to be 10–20 m/s (much faster than the California test). Two commercial knives were selected for use in this PSDB test method. In order to test at a representative velocity, an air cannon method was developed to propel the knife and sabot at the vest target using compressed air. In this first version, the PSDB ’93 test also used oil/clay materials as the tissue simulant backing. The introduction of knives which cut fiber and a hard-dense test backing required stab vest manufacturers to use metallic components in their vest designs to address this more rigorous standard. The current standard HOSDB Body Armour Standards for UK Police (2007) Part 3: Knife and Spike Resistance is harmonized with the US NIJ OO15 standard, use a drop test method and use a composite foam backing as a tissue simulant. Both the HOSDB and the NIJ test now specify engineered blades, double-edged S1 and single-edge P1 as well as the spike.

In addition to the stab standards, HOSDB has developed a standard for slash resistance (2006). This standard, like the stab standards, is based on drop testing with a test knife in a mounting of controlled mass. The slash test uses the Stanley Utility knife or box cutter blades. The slash standard tests the cut resistance of the armor panel parallel to the direction of blade travel. The test equipment measures the force at the instant the blade tip produces a sustained slash through the vest. The criteria require that slash failure of the armor be greater than 80 newtons of force.

===Combination stab and ballistic vests===
Vests that combined stab and ballistic protection were a significant innovation in the 1990s period of vest development. The starting point for this development were the ballistic-only offerings of that time using NIJ Level 2A, 2, and 3A or HOSDB HG 1 and 2, with compliant ballistic vest products being manufactured with areal densities of between 5.5 and 6 kg/m2 (1.1 and 1.2 lb/ft2 or 18 and 20 oz/ft2). However police forces were evaluating their &quot;street threats&quot; and requiring vests with both knife and ballistic protection. This multi-threat approach is common in the United Kingdom and other European countries and is less popular in the USA. Unfortunately for multi-threat users, the metallic array and chainmail systems that were necessary to defeat the test blades offered little ballistic performance. The multi-threat vests have areal densities close to the sum of the two solutions separately. These vests have mass values in the 7.5–8.5 kg/m2 (1.55–1.75 lb/ft2) range. Ref (NIJ and HOSDB certification listings). Rolls-Royce Composites -Megit and Highmark produced metallic array systems to address this HOSDB standard. These designs were used extensively by the London Metropolitan Police Service and other agencies in the United Kingdom.

===Standards update US and UK===

As vest manufacturers and the specifying authorities worked with these standards, the UK and US Standards teams began a collaboration on test methods. A number of issues with the first versions of the tests needed to be addressed. The use of commercial knives with inconsistent sharpness and tip shape created problems with test consistency. As a result, two new &quot;engineered blades&quot; were designed that could be manufactured to have reproducible penetrating behavior. The tissue simulants, Roma clay and gelatin, were either unrepresentative of tissue or not practical for the test operators. A composite-foam and hard-rubber test backing was developed as an alternative to address these issues. The drop test method was selected as the baseline for the updated standard over the air cannon option. The drop mass was reduced from the &quot;ice pick test&quot; and a wrist-like soft linkage was engineered into the penetrator-sabot to create a more realistic test impact. These closely related standards were first issued in 2003 as HOSDB 2003 and NIJ 0015. (The Police Scientific Development Branch (PSDB) was renamed the Home Office Scientific Development Branch in 2004.)

===Stab and spike vests===
These new standards created a focus on Level 1 at , Level 2 at , Level 3 at protection as tested with the new engineered knives defined in these test documents. The lowest level of this requirement at 25 joules was addressed by a series of textile products of both wovens, coated wovens and laminated woven materials. All of these materials were based on Para-aramid fiber. The co-efficient of friction for ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) prevented its use in this application. The TurtleSkin DiamondCoat and Twaron SRM products addressed this requirement using a combination of Para-Aramid wovens and bonded ceramic grain. These ceramic-coated products do not have the flexibility and softness of un-coated textile materials.

For the higher levels of protection L2 and L3, the very aggressive penetration of the small, thin P1 blade has resulted in the continued use of metallic components in stab armor. In Germany, Mehler Vario Systems developed hybrid vests of woven para-aramid and chainmail, and their solution was selected by London&#x27;s Metropolitan Police Service. Another German company BSST, in cooperation with Warwick Mills, has developed a system to meet the ballistic-stab requirement using Dyneema laminate and an advanced metallic-array system, TurtleSkin MFA. This system is currently implemented in the Netherlands. The trend in multi threat armor continues with requirements for needle protection in the Draft ISO prEN ISO 14876 norm. In many countries there is also an interest to combine military style explosive fragmentation protection with bullet-ballistics and stab requirements.

==Armor carriers==
In order for ballistic protection to be wearable, the ballistic panels and/or hard rifle-resistant plates are placed within a carrier. The term &quot;plate carrier&quot; is used specifically to refer to armour carriers which can hold ballistic plates. Broadly, there are two major types of carriers: overt carriers, and low-profile carriers which are meant to be concealed:&lt;ref name=&quot;spartan armor overt/covert&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overt/Tactical carriers===
Overt/Tactical armour carriers typically include pouches and/or mounting systems, like MOLLE, for carrying gear and are usually designed to provide higher amounts of protection. The Improved Outer Tactical Vest and Soldier Plate Carrier Systems are examples of military carriers design to be used with ballistic plate inserts.

In addition to load carriage, this type of carrier may include pockets for neck protection, side plates, groin plates, and backside protection. As this style of carrier is not close fitting, sizing in this system is straightforward for both men and women, making custom fabrication unnecessary.

===Low-Profile/Concealable carriers===

Low profile/concealable carriers holds the ballistic panels and/or ballistic plates close to the wearer&#x27;s body and a uniform shirt may be worn over the carrier. This type of carrier must be designed to conform closely to the officer&#x27;s body shape. For concealable armor to conform to the body it must be correctly fitted to a particular individual. Many programs specify full custom measurement and manufacturing of armor panels and carriers to ensure good fit and comfortable armor. Officers who are either female or significantly overweight have more difficulty in getting accurately measured and having comfortable armor fabricated.

===Vest slips===
A third textile layer is often found between the carrier and the ballistic components. The ballistic panels are covered in a coated pouch or slip. This slip provides the encapsulation of the ballistic materials. Slips are manufactured in two types: heat sealed hermetic slips and simple sewn slips. For some ballistic fibers such as Kevlar the slip is a critical part of the system. The slip prevents moisture from the user&#x27;s body from saturating the ballistic materials. This protection from moisture cycling increases the useful life of the armor.

==Research==

===Non-standard designs of hard armour===
The vast majority of hard body armor plates, including the U.S. military&#x27;s Small Arms Protective Insert family, are monolithic; their strike faces consist of a single ceramic tile. Monolithic plates are lighter than their non-monolithic counterparts, but suffer from reduced effectiveness when shot multiple times in a close area (i.e., shots spaced less than two inches/5.1 cm apart). However, several non-monolithic armor systems have emerged, the most well-known being the controversial Dragon Skin system. Dragon Skin, composed of dozens of overlapping ceramic scales, promised superior multi-hit performance and flexibility compared to the then-current ESAPI plate; however, it failed to deliver. When the U.S. Army tested the system against the same requirements as the ESAPI, Dragon Skin showed major issues with environmental damage; the scales would come apart when subjected to temperatures above 120 °F (49 °C) – not uncommon in Middle Eastern climates – when exposed to diesel vehicle fuel, or after the two four-foot drop tests (after these drops, ESAPI plates are put in an X-ray machine to determine the location of cracks, and then shot directly on said cracks), leaving the plate unable to reach its stated threat level and suffering 13 first- or second-shot complete penetrations by .30–06 M2 AP (the ESAPI test threat) out of 48 shots.

Perhaps less-well known is LIBA (Light Improved Body Armor), manufactured by Royal TenCate, ARES Protection, and Mofet Etzion in the early 2000s. LIBA uses an innovative array of ceramic pellets embedded in a polyethylene backer; although this layout lacks the flexibility of Dragon Skin, it provides impressive multi-hit ability as well as the unique ability to repair the armor by replacing damaged pellets and epoxying them over. In addition, there are variants of LIBA with multi-hit capacity against threats analogous to 7.62×51mm NATO M993 AP/WC, a tungsten-cored armor-piercing round. Field tests of LIBA have yielded successful results, with 15 AKM hits producing only minor bruises.

===Progress in material science===
Ballistic vests use layers of very strong fibers to &quot;catch&quot; and deform a bullet, mushrooming it into a dish shape, and spreading its force over a larger portion of the vest fiber. The vest absorbs the energy from the deforming bullet, bringing it to a stop before it can completely penetrate the textile matrix. Some layers may be penetrated but as the bullet deforms, the energy is absorbed by a larger and larger fiber area.

In recent years, advances in material science have opened the door to the idea of a literal &quot;bulletproof vest&quot; able to stop handgun and rifle bullets with a soft textile vest, without the assistance of additional metal or ceramic plating. However, progress is moving at a slower rate compared to other technical disciplines. The most recent offering from Kevlar, Protera, was released in 1996. Current soft body armor can stop most handgun rounds (which has been the case for roughly 15 years ), but armor plates are needed to stop rifle rounds and steel-core handgun rounds such as 7.62×25mm. The para-aramids have not progressed beyond the limit of 23 grams per denier in fiber tenacity.

Modest ballistic performance improvements have been made by new producers of this fiber type. Much the same can be said for the UHMWPE material; the basic fiber properties have only advanced to the 30–35 g/d range. Improvements in this material have been seen in the development of cross-plied non-woven laminate, e.g. Spectra Shield. The major ballistic performance advance of fiber PBO is known as a &quot;cautionary tale&quot; in materials science. This fiber permitted the design of handgun soft armor that was 30–50% lower in mass as compared to the aramid and UHMWPE materials. However this higher tenacity was delivered with a well-publicized weakness in environmental durability.

Akzo-Magellan (now DuPont) teams have been working on fiber called M5 fiber; however, its announced startup of its pilot plant has been delayed more than 2 years. Data suggests if the M5 material can be brought to market, its performance will be roughly equivalent to PBO. In May 2008, the Teijin Aramid group announced a &quot;super-fibers&quot; development program. The Teijin emphasis appears to be on computational chemistry to define a solution to high tenacity without environmental weakness.

The materials science of second generation &quot;super&quot; fibers is complex, requires large investments, and represent significant technical challenges. Research aims to develop artificial spider silk which could be super strong, yet light and flexible. Other research has been done to harness nanotechnology to help create super-strong fibers that could be used in future bulletproof vests. In 2018, the US military began conducting research into the feasibility of using artificial silk as body armor, which has the advantages of its light weight and its cooling capability.

===Textile wovens and laminates research===
Finer yarns and lighter woven fabrics have been a key factor in improving ballistic results. The cost of ballistic fibers increases dramatically as the yarn size decreases, so it&#x27;s unclear how long this trend can continue. The current practical limit of fiber size is 200 denier with most wovens limited at the 400 denier level. Three-dimensional weaving with fibers connecting flat wovens together into a 3D system are being considered for both hard and soft ballistics. Team Engineering Inc is designing and weaving these multi layer materials. Dyneema DSM has developed higher performance laminates using a new, higher strength fiber designated SB61, and HB51. DSM feels this advanced material provides some improved performance, however the SB61 &quot;soft ballistic&quot; version has been recalled. At the Shot Show in 2008, a unique composite of interlocking steel plates and soft UHWMPE plate was exhibited by TurtleSkin. In combination with more traditional woven fabrics and laminates a number of research efforts are working with ballistic felts. Tex Tech has been working on these materials. Like the 3D weaving, Tex Tech sees the advantage in the 3-axis fiber orientation.

===Fibers used===
Ballistic nylon (until the 1970s) or Kevlar, Twaron or Spectra (a competitor for Kevlar) or polyethylene fiber could be used to manufacture bullet proof vests. The vests of the time were made of ballistic nylon &amp; supplemented by plates of fiber-glass, steel, ceramic, titanium, Doron &amp; composites of ceramic and fiberglass, the last being the most effective.

===Developments in ceramic armor===
Ceramic materials, materials processing and progress in ceramic penetration mechanics are significant areas of academic and industrial activity. This combined field of ceramics armor research is broad and is perhaps summarized best by The American Ceramics Society. ACerS has run an annual armor conference for a number of years and compiled a proceedings 2004–2007. An area of special activity pertaining to vests is the emerging use of small ceramic components. Large torso sized ceramic plates are complex to manufacture and are subject to cracking in use. Monolithic plates also have limited multi hit capacity as a result of their large impact fracture zone. These are the motivations for new types of armor plate. These new designs use two- and three-dimensional arrays of ceramic elements that can be rigid, flexible, or semi-flexible. Dragon Skin body armor is one of these systems. European developments in spherical and hexagonal arrays have resulted in products that have some flex and multi hit performance. The manufacture of array type systems with flex, consistent ballistic performance at edges of ceramic elements is an active area of research. In addition advanced ceramic processing techniques arrays require adhesive assembly methods. One novel approach is use of hook and loop fasteners to assemble the ceramic arrays.

===Nanomaterials in ballistics===
Currently, there are a number of methods by which nanomaterials are being implemented into body armor production. The first, developed at University of Delaware is based on nanoparticles within the suit that become rigid enough to protect the wearer as soon as a kinetic energy threshold is surpassed. These coatings have been described as shear thickening fluids. These nano-infused fabrics have been licensed by BAE systems, but as of mid-2008, no products have been released based on this technology.

In 2005 an Israeli company, ApNano, developed a material that was always rigid. It was announced that this nanocomposite based on tungsten disulfide nanotubes was able to withstand shocks generated by a steel projectile traveling at velocities of up to 1.5 km/s. The material was also reportedly able to withstand shock pressures generated by other impacts of up to 250 metric tons-force per square centimeter (24.5 gigapascals; 3,550,000 psi). During the tests, the material proved to be so strong that after the impact the samples remained essentially unmarred. Additionally, a study in France tested the material under isostatic pressure and found it to be stable up to at least 350 tf/cm2 (34 GPa; 5,000,000 psi).

As of mid-2008, spider silk bulletproof vests and nano-based armors are being developed for potential market release. Both the British and American militaries have expressed interest in a carbon fiber woven from carbon nanotubes that was developed at University of Cambridge and has the potential to be used as body armor. In 2008, large format carbon nanotube sheets began being produced at Nanocomp. 

===Graphene composite===
In late 2014, researchers began studying and testing graphene as a material for use in body armor. Graphene is manufactured from carbon and is the thinnest, strongest, and most conductive material on the planet. Taking the form of hexagonally arranged atoms, its tensile strength is known to be 200 times greater than steel, but studies from Rice University have revealed it is also 10 times better than steel at dissipating energy, an ability that had previously not been thoroughly explored. To test its properties, the University of Massachusetts stacked together graphene sheets only a single carbon atom thick, creating layers ranging in thickness from 10 nanometers to 100 nanometers from 300 layers. Microscopic spherical silica &quot;bullets&quot; were fired at the sheets at speeds of up to 3 km (1.9 mi) per second, almost nine times the speed of sound. Upon impact, the projectiles deformed into a cone shape around the graphene before ultimately breaking through. In the three nanoseconds it held together however, the transferred energy traveled through the material at a speed of 22.2 km (13.8 mi) per second, faster than any other known material. If the impact stress can be spread out over a large enough area that the cone moves out at an appreciable velocity compared with the velocity of the projectile, stress will not be localized under where it hit. Although a wide impact hole opened up, a composite mixture of graphene and other materials could be made to create a new, revolutionary armor solution.

==Legality==
===Australia===
In Australia, it is illegal to import body armour without prior authorisation from Australian Customs and Border Protection Service. It is also illegal to possess body armour without authorization in South Australia, Victoria, Northern Territory, ACT, Queensland, New South Wales, and Tasmania.

===Canada===
In all Canadian provinces except for Alberta, British Columbia and Manitoba, it is legal to wear and to purchase body armour such as ballistic vests. Under the laws of these provinces, it is illegal to possess body armour without a license (unless exempted) issued by the provincial government.

As of February 2019, Nova Scotia allows “only those who require such armour due to their employment” to own body armor, such as police and corrections officers, citing the use of body armor by criminals.

According to the Body Armour Control Act of Alberta which came into force on June 15, 2012, any individual in possession of a valid firearms licence under the Firearms Act of Canada can legally purchase, possess and wear body armour.

===European Union===

In the European Union, the import and sale of ballistic vests and body armor is allowed. There is an exception for vests that are developed under strict military specifications and/or for main military usage; shield above the level of protection NIJ 4 are considered by the law as &quot;armament materials&quot; and forbidden for civilian use. There are many shops in the EU that sell ballistic vests and body armor, used or new.

In Italy, the purchase, ownership and wear of ballistic vests and body armor is not subject to any restriction, except for those ballistic protections that are developed under strict military specifications and/or for main military usage, thus considered by the law as &quot;armament materials&quot; and forbidden to civilians. Furthermore, a number of laws and court rulings during the years have rehearsed the concept of a ballistic vest being mandatory to wear for those individuals who work in the private security sector.

In the Netherlands the civilian ownership of body armour is subject to the European Union regulations. Body armour in various ballistic grades is sold by a range of different vendors, mainly aimed at providing to security guards and VIP&#x27;s. The use of body armour while committing a crime is not an additional offence in itself, but may be interpreted as so under different laws such as resisting arrest.

===Hong Kong===
Under Schedule C (item ML13) of Cap. 60G Import and Export (Strategic Commodities) Regulations, &quot;armoured or protective equipment, constructions and components&quot; are not regulated &quot;when accompanying their user for the user&#x27;s own personal protection&quot;.

===United States===
United States law restricts possession of body armor for convicted violent felons. Many U.S. states also have penalties for possession or use of body armor by felons. In other states, such as Kentucky, possession is not prohibited, but probation or parole is denied to a person convicted of committing certain violent crimes while wearing body armor and carrying a deadly weapon. Most states do not have restrictions for non-felons.

<text>South Hamilton is a postal address assigned to ZIP code 01982 by the Postal Service and is part of the town of Hamilton, Essex County, Massachusetts, United States (ZIP code 01936). The designation arose in the 1960s when the Postal Service built a new modern post office in downtown Hamilton with the intention of closing the original post office 2 miles north on the same road. Due to public objection, the original post office was preserved and remains open to this day. To distinguish between the two post offices in an era when the use of ZIP code was not yet mandatory, the new post office was designated the &quot;South Hamilton&quot; post office.

The Postal Service followed through with moving most of their operations, including all delivery operations, to the new post office. Thus almost all mail delivered within the town of Hamilton carries the &quot;South Hamilton&quot; postal address and the 01982 ZIP code. Only mail destined for P.O. Boxes located within the old post office and a few nearby buildings still carries the &quot;Hamilton&quot; postal address and the 01936 zip code.

==In popular culture==
Bo Burnham&#x27;s song &quot;I&#x27;m Bo Yo&quot; includes the lyric &quot;I&#x27;m representing you/I&#x27;m representing the people from the 01982&quot;, a reference to Burnham&#x27;s home town of Hamilton.

<text>== Introduction ==
Sir Edward Sabine (; 14 October 1788 – 26 June 1883) was an Irish Physicist, Geodesistastronomer, geophysicist, ornithologist, Polar explorer, soldier, and the 30th president of the Royal Society.

He led the effort to establish a system of magnetic observatories in various parts of British territory all over the globe. Much of his life was devoted to their direction and to analysing their observations. Other research focused on the birds of Greenland, ocean temperatures, the Gulf Stream, barometric measurement of heights, arc of the meridian, glacial transport of rocks, the volcanoes of the Hawaiian Islands and various points of meteorology.

== Early life ==
Edward Sabine was born 14 October 1788 in Great Britain St. (Parnell St.), Dublin. His Father, Joseph Sabine, was a member of a prominent Anglo-Irish family who was visiting his Irish relatives at the time of his son&#x27;s birth. The family connections with Ireland can be traced back to the 17th century. His mother, Sarah Hunt was the daughter of Rowland Hunt of Shropshire. His Great Grandfather was also named Joseph Sabine. He was an English settler who owned land in Killmolin, Wicklow. 

However his mother Sarah died when he was just one month old. He was the couple&#x27;s fifth son and ninth child. One of his older brothers was naturalist called Joseph Sabine (1770-1837). In fact, it is said that Edward developed his love for science, that he would later turn into a career, through conversations with his brother, Joseph Sabine and also his brother in law Henry Browne. His interest in the sciences ranged from ornithology, horticulture and the earth sciences.

His father returned to their home of Tewin in Hertfordshire soon after his birth.

He was educated at Marlow and at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. In 1803, at age 15, he obtained a commission in the Royal Artillery as a second lieutenant, becoming a captain ten years later and eventually attaining the rank of general in 1870.

== Serving in the Army. ==
Sabine’s family had a long history of serving in the military. For example, His Great Grandfather, Joseph Sabine was in the army of William III (qv) in Ireland. He ranked as major general in the Royal Welch Fusiliers. Edward Sabine followed this tradition at fourteen years old when he attended to Royal Military Academy at Woolwich. He was named a lieutenant in the Royal Artillery in December 1803 and was sent to Gibraltar in 1804. He became a second captain when he was sent to Quebec and fought the Americans in the Niagara campaign. 

Sabine was stationed in Gibraltar during the Peninsular War, but it was in the War of 1812 that he had his first taste of combat. On 24 June 1813, while traveling to Canada, the English packet ship was attacked by an American privateer. In the ensuing battle Sabine, who was the Manchester&#x27;s astronomer, reportedly handled a gun &quot;to good effect&quot;. The ship was captured and after his release Sabine travelled from Halifax to Quebec. During the times of 1813 - 14, Sabine fought along the St Lawrence River in Upper and Lower Canada.

Sabine continued to see action in the War of 1812, particularly in the Niagara Campaign in August and September 1814. Under George Gordon Drummond he commanded the batteries at the Siege of Fort Erie and was mentioned twice in dispatches. He returned to England and devoted the remainder of his life to the pursuits of astronomy, terrestrial magnetism and physical geography.

== Sabine’s Scientific Career ==

Sabine was a renowned scientist known for his work on Earth&#x27;s magnetism, magnetic instruments, and polar exploration. In 1818, he joined the North-West Passage expedition with John Ross as an astronomer and scientific officer. He made significant observations, including measurements of tides, currents, and magnetic properties. Despite a dispute with Ross over credit, Sabine contributed a report on biological findings, including a new bird species, &quot;Larus sabini&quot;.

In 1819, Sabine returned to the Arctic with William Parry, conducting a magnetic survey on their expedition to Melville Island. His work earned him the Copley Medal in 1821, and Parry named a peninsula after him. Sabine’s ongoing research in magnetism led him to become a central figure in the &quot;magnetic crusade,&quot; a global effort to study Earth&#x27;s magnetic field. In 1821, he also embarked on a scientific voyage to the South Atlantic and Caribbean, later conducting studies in Greenland, where Sabine Island was named in his honor.

Sabine received support for his magnetic research from Sir John Barrow, secretary of the Admiralty, and the Royal Society. From 1830 to 1837, stationed in Ireland, Sabine worked with Professor Humphrey Lloyd on a magnetic survey of Ireland, later extended to Scotland and England. Many of the instruments used were developed by Lloyd and Sabine and built by Howard Grubb &amp; Son in Dublin. He also served as the secretary of the Royal Society from 1827 to 1829.

In 1839, Sabine played a key role in securing support for an Antarctic expedition led by James Clark Ross aboard HMS &quot;Erebus&quot;, with Capt. Francis Crozier commanding HMS &quot;Terror&quot;.The expedition set up geomagnetic observatories in the Southern Hemisphere, providing valuable data on terrestrial magnetism. Sabine was skilled at managing large datasets, employing clerks at the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich. Despite criticism for his tight control over the project, he identified periodic magnetic phenomena.

Sabine also had a professional dispute with G. B. Airy at the Royal Observatory, during which he successfully advocated for Kew to become the central hub for magnetic observatories. His leadership, interpersonal skills, and ability to secure funding helped him build a broad international network.

He held various leadership roles at the Royal Society, including Foreign Secretary in 1845, Treasurer in 1850, and President from 1861 to 1871. Promoted to General in 1870, Sabine received numerous prestigious awards, including a DCL from Oxford, an LLD from Cambridge, and the KCB (Knight Commander of the Bath), along with several foreign honors.

== More Detailed Analysis of his Scientific expeditions. ==

===Ross expedition===
Sabine was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in April 1818, and it was thanks to the society&#x27;s recommendations that he was invited to take part that year in Captain John Ross&#x27;s first Arctic expedition. As the expedition&#x27;s appointed astronomer, Sabine was told to assist Ross &quot;in making such observations as may tend to the improvement of geography and navigation and the advancement of science in general&quot;.

Although the principal purpose of the voyage was to find the Northwest Passage, several objects of scientific curiosity were deemed worthy of investigation, such as the location of the Earth&#x27;s north magnetic pole and the behaviour of pendulums in high latitudes which provided information on the shape of the earth. Sabine also made ornithological observations.

The expedition failed to discover the Northwest Passage and ended in controversy. When Ross found his progress through Lancaster Sound blocked by sea ice, he turned around and headed back to Britain, much to the annoyance of the other members of the expedition. Both Sabine and Ross&#x27;s second-in-command, William Edward Parry, doubted the very existence of the so-called Croker Mountains, which it seems only Ross saw. Objecting to Ross&#x27;s precipitate retreat, Sabine later recalled his &quot;very visible mortification at having come away from a place which I considered as the most interesting in the world for magnetic observations and where my expectations had been raised to the highest pitch, without having had an opportunity of making them&quot;.

To make matters worse, a very public row broke out between the two men when they arrived home. Sabine objected when Ross claimed the credit for certain magnetic observations. He also accused Ross of stealing magnetic measurements without giving him due credit and of refusing to allow him enough time on the expedition to take accurate readings. Sabine was later able to recover credit for them.

The results of Sabine&#x27;s magnetic researches were published in the &quot;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society&quot;. Although he viewed his work as confirming and extending the discoveries of earlier &quot;magnetic collectors&quot;, he stressed the need for the multiplication and repetition of observations. Sabine was a diligent and careful scientist. He generally avoided theoretical discussion in his writings, believing that a true understanding of terrestrial magnetism would only be arrived at after exhaustive observations had been made on a global scale.

===Parry expedition===
The following year, in May 1819, both Edward and Joseph Sabine returned to the Arctic as members of Lieutenant William Edward Parry&#x27;s expedition in search of the Northwest Passage aboard the &quot;Hecla&quot;. The Admiralty once again instructed the participants to gather such scientific data as &quot;must prove most valuable and interesting to the science of our country.&quot; They were to pay particular attention to magnetic measurements, especially the possible interactions between magnetic needles, atmospheric electricity and the aurora borealis. They were also to attempt to establish the location of the Earth&#x27;s North Magnetic Pole, then believed to lie somewhere along the western shore of Baffin Bay.

Like Ross, Parry did not find the passage, but he did set a new record for the &quot;furthest west,&quot; which stood for several decades. In order to alleviate the tedium of the long Arctic winter, Sabine produced a weekly newspaper for the amusement of the crew. Known as the &quot;North Georgia Gazette and Winter Chronicle&quot;, it ran for twenty-one issues. Due to public demand, it was actually published on their return to Britain – much to Sabine&#x27;s surprise.

During this expedition, which lasted until November 1820, Sabine noted that changes in magnetic intensity had taken place since his previous visit. He attributed such changes to either a fluctuation in the Earth&#x27;s magnetic intensity or the shifting positions of the terrestrial magnetic poles. For his work in the Arctic, Sabine received the Copley Medal from the Royal Society in 1821.

== Geodetic measurement ==
Sabine next turned his attention to geodesy, which had already engaged his attention during the first of his Arctic voyages and in particular the determination of the length of the seconds pendulum. By measuring the length of a seconds pendulum in different latitudes, one can calculate the &quot;oblateness&quot; of the Earth - i.e. the degree to which the &quot;figure of the Earth&quot; departs from perfect sphericity. Attempts to do this had been made in the eighteenth century, but it was not until Sabine&#x27;s lifetime that precision instruments were available to allow sufficiently accurate measurements to be made.

Sabine threw himself into the task with his usual diligence. Between 1821 and 1823 he travelled halfway around the world with his pendulums and carried out innumerable measurements at many different latitudes including the intertropical coasts of Africa and the Americas. He also returned to the Arctic, journeying up the eastern coast of Greenland with Captain Douglas Clavering on Parry&#x27;s old ship the &quot;Griper&quot;. Observations were made at Little Pendulum Island, in latitude 74°30&#x27; and among the snows of Spitsbergen. Sabine Island was named in his honour during this expedition.

The results of his research were published in 1825. They represented the most accurate assessment of the figure of the earth that had ever been made. Not content to rest on his laurels, Sabine conducted further pendulum experiments throughout the 1820s, determining the relative lengths of the second&#x27;s pendulum in Paris, London, Greenwich and Altona.

==Leave of absence==
On 31 December 1827 he was promoted 1st captain. Between 1827 and 1829, the Duke of Wellington granted Sabine general leave of absence from the army on the understanding &quot;that he was usefully employed in scientific pursuits&quot;. He acted as one of the secretaries of the Royal Society. In 1828 he was appointed a scientific adviser to the Admiralty, following the abolition of the Board of Longitude. But his leave from the army did not last very long. Political agitation in Ireland necessitated an increased military presence in the country and in 1830 Sabine was recalled to military duty. He remained in his native land for the next seven years, but he did not allow his new military duties to interrupt his scientific endeavours. He continued his pendulum investigations and in 1834 commenced a systematic magnetic survey of Ireland—the first of its kind in what was then the United Kingdom. It was extended to Scotland in 1836 and to England the following year.

== Scientific advisor to the Admiralty ==
On the abolition of the Board of Longitude in 1828, it was arranged that three scientific advisers to the Admiralty should be nominated from the council of the Royal Society. Sabine, Michael Faraday and Thomas Young were chosen. Sabine&#x27;s appointment was violently attacked by Charles Babbage in a pamphlet entitled &quot;Reflections on the Decline of Science in England and on Some of its Causes&quot;. Sabine, however, refused to be drawn into the controversy.

== Magnetic crusade ==
During the decades that the Royal Navy and Royal Society devoted much energy to magnetic variation and its problems, magnetism came to be seen as an eminently &quot;British&quot; science. There was intense interest in figuring out what many called &quot;the great remaining physical mystery since Newton&#x27;s work on gravitation&quot;. By the beginning of the nineteenth century, it was widely recognized that the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field was continually changing over time in a complicated way that interfered with compass readings. It was a mystery which some scientists believed might be associated with weather patterns.

To solve this mystery once and for all, a number of physicists recommended that a magnetic survey of the entire globe be carried out. Sabine was one of the instigators of this &quot;Magnetic Crusade&quot;, urging the government to establish magnetic observatories throughout the empire. He also recruited many associates to the cause—most notably James Clark Ross, a nephew of Sir John&#x27;s, the German explorer Alexander von Humboldt, the Astronomer Royal George Airy at Greenwich Observatory and Francis Ronalds, Honorary Director of the Kew Observatory.

A committee, of which Sabine was a prominent member, was established to work out the details. Suitable locations for the observatories were selected in both hemispheres and representations were made to dispatch an expedition to the Southern Ocean to carry out a magnetic survey of the Antarctic. In the spring of 1839, the government approved the scheme. Observatories were to be established at Toronto, St. Helena, Cape Town, Tasmania and at stations to be determined by the East India Company, while other nations were invited to co-operate. Sabine was appointed to superintend the entire operation.

Most of these observatories were of limited size and were dismantled as soon as the initial survey was complete, but the one founded by Sabine at Toronto in 1840 is still in existence. Originally housed in a modest building at the newly established University of Toronto, it was called the Toronto Magnetic and Meteorological Observatory. It was the first scientific institution in the country.

The birthplace of Canadian astronomy was a simple log building held together with copper nails and brass fastenings. Non-magnetic materials were used to avoid the problem of &quot;local attraction.&quot; A second room was built to house a telescope, which was used to make accurate time readings based on the movement of the Sun and stars. The modern stone observatory was erected in 1855.

In the early years, there was no way to take continuous readings: everything had to be done by hand. Thousands of painstaking observations were taken by the staff— sometimes as frequently as every five minutes. These observations were all carefully scrutinised by Sabine back in Britain. By 1846, photo-magnetographs had been developed by Francis Ronalds and Airy&#x27;s associate Charles Brooke to continuously record the magnet&#x27;s movements using the recent invention of photography. The new instruments were first installed at the Toronto Observatory in the later 1840s as well as at Kew and Greenwich.

In 1852, Sabine recognized from the Toronto records that magnetic variations could be divided into a regular diurnal cycle and an irregular portion. The irregularity correlated very closely with fluctuations in the number of sunspots, whose cyclic nature had been discovered in 1844 by the German amateur astronomer Heinrich Schwabe. Sabine was the first to recognize that solar disturbances affected the Earth&#x27;s magnetic environment. On 6 April 1852, he announced that the Sun&#x27;s 11-year sunspot cycle was &quot;absolutely identical&quot; to the Earth&#x27;s 11-year geomagnetic cycle.

The following year, Sabine also made a similar correlation with the Moon, establishing that that celestial body too had an influence on the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field. He concluded that the Moon must have a significant magnetic field of its own to cause such an effect. But for once he was mistaken: the effect is actually the result of gravitational tides in the ionosphere.

Throughout the 1840s and 1850s, Sabine continued to superintend the operation of magnetic observatories throughout the British Empire. The result was Sabine&#x27;s magnum opus: as complete a magnetic survey of the globe as was then humanly possible.

== Later life ==
Throughout his long life, Sabine received numerous decorations for his contributions to science. In 1849, the Royal Society awarded him one of its gold medals for his work on terrestrial magnetism. Sabine was president of the society from November 1861 until his resignation in November 1871. He was a member of the Royal Commission of 1868–1869, for standardizing weights and measures. Both Oxford and Cambridge bestowed honorary doctorates on him. He was a fellow of the Linnean Society and the Royal Astronomical Society and president of the British Association for the Advancement of Science.

In 1867, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He became a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in 1869. He retired from the army on full pay in 1877, having been promoted full general on 7 February 1870. He had been a member of the American Philosophical Society since 1841.

He married Elizabeth Juliana Leeves (1807-79) in 1826. She was an accomplished woman in her own right, she had assisted her husband in his scientific endeavours for more than half a century. Her four-volume translation of Alexander von Humboldt&#x27;s monumental textbook of geophysics &quot;Kosmos&quot;, was published from 1849 to 1858.Her husband, Sabine wrote an introduction and added notes to this. They translated &quot;Humboldt&#x27;s Aspects of nature (1850)&quot;, &quot;Meteorological essays&quot; by Francois Arago. She was also responsible for the English translation of Ferdinand von Wrangel&#x27;s &quot;Narrative of an Expedition to the Polar Sea&quot;, working from a German translation by Georg von Engelhardt.

Sabine authored numerous books, wrote hundreds of scientific papers (103 of which are cataloged in the Royal Society&#x27;s collection), and contributed articles and literature reviews on topics related to terrestrial physics.

Sir Edward Sabine died aged 94 in his home in Richmond, Surrey on 26 June 1883, and was buried in the family vault at Tewin, Hertfordshire. His wife is also buried there.

A portrait of Sabine can be found at the Royal Society, while another, painted by G. F. Watts, RA, in 1876, hangs in the Royal Artillery mess in Woolwich. Additionally, there is an oil painting of him by Stephen Pearce (1850) in the National Portrait Gallery in London.

== Namesake ==
Sabine is the namesake of Sabine&#x27;s gull, Sabine&#x27;s puffback and Sabine&#x27;s spinetail.

Geographical features named after Sabine include Sabine Land, the Sabine Islands and Sabinebukta (all in Svalbard), Mount Sabine among Antarctica&#x27;s Admiralty Mountains; Sabine Island on Greenland&#x27;s east coast; and the lunar Sabine crater.

==Human rights==

The Maldives has become a very strong advocate for the promotion and protection of human rights following the democratic transition in 2008.

<text>Ludwig Bamberger (22 July 1823 – 14 March 1899) was a German Jewish economist, politician, revolutionary and writer.

== Early life ==
Bamberger was born into the wealthy Ashkenazi Jewish Bamberger family in Mainz. After studying at Giessen, Heidelberg, and Göttingen, he became a lawyer.

== Career ==
When the revolution of 1848 broke out Bamberger took an active part as one of the leaders of the republican party in his native city, both as a popular orator and as editor of the &quot;Mainzer Zeitung&quot; newspaper. In 1849 he took part in the republican uprising in the Palatinate and Baden; on the restoration of order he was condemned to death, but by then with other leading revolutionaries like Germain Metternich, Louis Blenker, and Franz Zitz he had escaped to Switzerland. The next years he spent in exile, at first in London, then in the Netherlands; in 1852 he went to Paris, where, by means of private connections to the Bischoffsheim family, he received an appointment in the bank of Bischoffsheim, Goldschmidt &amp; Cie, of which he became managing director, a post which he held till 1866. During these years he saved a competence and gained a thorough acquaintance with the theory and practice of finance. This he put to account when the amnesty of 1866 enabled him to return to Germany.

He was elected a member of the &quot;Reichstag&quot;, where he joined the National Liberal Party, for, like many other exiles, he was willing to accept the results of Otto von Bismarck’s work. Bamberger represented the electoral district of Bingen-Alzey and married Anna Belmont, a relative of the famous banker August Belmont, who had emigrated to the United States. In 1868 he published a short life of Bismarck in French, with the object of producing a better understanding of German affairs, and in 1870, owing to their intimate acquaintance with France and with finance, he and Gerson Bleichröder were summoned by Bismarck to Versailles to help in the discussion of terms of peace.

In the German &quot;Reichstag&quot; he was the leading authority on matters of finance and economics, as well as a clear and persuasive speaker, and it was chiefly owing to him that a gold currency was adopted and that the Reichsbank took form; in his later years he wrote and spoke strongly against bimetallism. He was the leader of the free traders, and after 1878 refused to follow Bismarck in his new policy of protection, state socialism and colonial development. On account of his opposition to Bismarck&#x27;s economic policy, he left the National Liberal Party and joined the “Secessionists” which later merged into the German Free-minded Party. He was also a founder of the Verein zur Förderung der Handelsfreiheit (Group for the Promotion of Free Trade).

With private banker Adelbert Delbrück, on 22 January 1870, he founded Deutsche Bank in Berlin as a specialist bank for foreign trade.
In 1892 he retired from political life and died in 1899.

== Writings ==
Bamberger was a clear and attractive writer and was a frequent contributor on political and economic questions to the &quot;Nation&quot; and other periodicals. Among his noted publications—which include works on the currency, on the French war indemnity, his criticism of socialism and his apology for the Secession—are:
* &quot;Erlebnisse aus der pfälzischen Erhebung&quot; (Experiences from the Palatine Uprising, 1849)
* &quot;Monsieur de Bismarck&quot; (Herr von Bismarck, 1868; English translation, 1869)
* &quot;La colonie allemande&quot; (in &quot;Paris Guide&quot;, 1868; English translation &quot;Germans in Paris&quot; 2016)
* &quot;Die fünf Milliarden&quot; (The five billion, 1873)
* &quot;Deutschland und der Sozialismus&quot; (Germany and Socialism, 1878)
* &quot;Deutschtum und Judentum&quot; (Germans and Jews, 1880)
* &quot;Die Stichworte der Silberleute besprochen&quot; (Terminology of the silver advocates explained, 4th ed., 1893)
* &quot;Erinnerungen&quot; (Reminiscences, published by Nathan, 1899).

<doc id="149077" wikidata="Q224650" url="?curid=149077" title="Sarah McLachlan">
<text>Sarah Ann McLachlan (born January 28, 1968) is a Canadian singer-songwriter. As of 2015, she had sold over 40 million albums worldwide. McLachlan&#x27;s best-selling album to date is &quot;Surfacing&quot; (1997), for which she won two Grammy Awards (out of four nominations) and four Juno Awards. In addition to her personal artistic efforts, she founded the Lilith Fair tour, which showcased female musicians.

==Early and personal life==
McLachlan was born on January 28, 1968, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. The daughter of a woman named Judy James, McLachlan was raised by her adoptive parents, Jack, an American-born marine biologist, and Dorice McLachlan. The family also included two older adopted brothers, Stewart and Ian. As a child, she was a member of Girl Guides of Canada, participating in Guiding programs.

McLachlan played music from a very young age, beginning with the ukulele when she was four. She studied classical guitar, classical piano, and voice at the Maritime Conservatory of Music through the curriculum of The Royal Conservatory of Music. At 17, while she was still a student at Queen Elizabeth High School, in Halifax, she fronted a short-lived rock band called the October Game, whose members also included drummer Creighton Doane. One of the band&#x27;s songs, &quot;Grind&quot;, credited as a group composition, can be found on the independent Flamingo Records release &quot;Out of the Fog&quot; and the CD &quot;Out of the Fog Too&quot;. It has yet to be released elsewhere.

Following the October Game&#x27;s first concert at Dalhousie University opening for Moev, McLachlan was offered a recording contract with Vancouver-based independent record label Nettwerk by Moev&#x27;s Mark Jowett. McLachlan&#x27;s parents insisted that she finish high school and complete one year of studies at the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design before moving to Vancouver and embarking on a new life as a recording artist. She finally signed to Nettwerk two years later before having written a single song. When she was 19, a mutual acquaintance introduced her to her birth mother. McLachlan did not seek her out and was ambivalent about meeting her.

In 1994, McLachlan was sued by Uwe Vandrei, an obsessed fan from Ottawa, who alleged that his letters to her had been the basis of the single &quot;Possession&quot;. The lawsuit was also challenging for the Canadian legal system since Vandrei was an admitted stalker whose acknowledged goal in filing the lawsuit was to be near McLachlan. Precautions were taken to ensure McLachlan&#x27;s safety if she had to be in the same location as Vandrei. Before the trial began, Vandrei was found dead in an apparent suicide. Vandrei&#x27;s preoccupation with McLachlan was explored at length in Canadian author Judith Fitzgerald&#x27;s book, &quot;Building a Mystery: The Story of Sarah McLachlan &amp; Lilith Fair&quot;.

McLachlan married her drummer, Ashwin Sood, in Jamaica in 1997. In December 2001, while McLachlan was pregnant with her first child, her mother died from cancer. McLachlan gave birth to her daughter, India, in Vancouver on April 6, 2002. Five years later, she gave birth to her second daughter Taja, also in Vancouver, on June 22. McLachlan announced her separation from Sood in September 2008 and they divorced the same year.

In 2014, when asked what religion she practices, she answered, &quot;I don&#x27;t adhere to any particular religion. I view the concept of God as an energy that we all are part of and share. If I had any spiritual leanings, it would be towards buddhism. But again, I follow my own path most of my life.&quot;

==Career and albums==

=== 1987–92: &quot;Touch&quot; and &quot;Solace&quot; ===
The signing with Nettwerk prompted McLachlan to move to Vancouver, British Columbia. There she recorded her first album, &quot;Touch&quot;, in 1987, which received both critical and commercial success and included the song &quot;Vox&quot;. During this period she also contributed to an album by Moev, provided vocals on Manufacture&#x27;s &quot;As the End Draws Near&quot;, and embarked on her first national concert tour as an opening act for the Grapes of Wrath.

McLachlan&#x27;s 1991 album, &quot;Solace&quot;, was her mainstream breakthrough in Canada, spawning the hit singles &quot;The Path of Thorns (Terms)&quot; and &quot;Into the Fire&quot;. &quot;Solace&quot; also marked the beginning of her partnership with Pierre Marchand. Marchand and McLachlan have been collaborators ever since, with Marchand producing many of McLachlan&#x27;s albums and occasionally co-writing songs.

=== 1993–2002: &quot;Fumbling Towards Ecstasy&quot;, &quot;Surfacing&quot;, and &quot;Mirrorball&quot; ===

1993&#x27;s &quot;Fumbling Towards Ecstasy&quot; was an immediate hit in Canada. From her Nettwerk connection, her piano version of the song &quot;Possession&quot; was included on the first &quot;Due South&quot; soundtrack in 1996. Over the next two years, &quot;Fumbling Towards Ecstasy&quot; became McLachlan&#x27;s international breakthrough as well, scaling the charts in a number of countries.

Following the success from &quot;Fumbling Towards Ecstasy&quot;, McLachlan returned in 1997 with &quot;Surfacing&quot;, her best-selling album to date. The album earned her two 1998 Grammy Awards, one for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance (for &quot;Building a Mystery&quot;) and one for Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance (for &quot;Last Dance&quot;), and four Juno Awards, including Album of the Year for &quot;Surfacing&quot; and Song of the Year and Songwriter of the Year for &quot;Building a Mystery&quot;. Reaching number one on the Canadian Albums Chart and number two on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, the album has since sold over 16 million copies worldwide and brought her much international success.

Still in the spotlight from the album, McLachlan launched the highly popular Lilith Fair tour. Her song &quot;Angel&quot;—inspired by the fatal overdose of Smashing Pumpkins touring keyboardist Jonathan Melvoin—made sales skyrocket. Fellow adoptee Darryl McDaniels was so touched by &quot;Angel&quot; that it inspired him to reassess his life and career. He credits McLachlan and her album &quot;Surfacing&quot; (on which &quot;Angel&quot; appeared) with saving his life; the two have collaborated on many projects in support of the rights of adoptees. In 1998, &quot;Angel&quot; featured in the motion picture &quot;City of Angels&quot;. Its soundtrack reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. More than five months after the film disappeared from the theatres, the soundtrack remained firmly entrenched among &quot;Billboard&quot;″s top 40 albums and earned quadruple-platinum status. Another song from &quot;Surfacing&quot;, &quot;Full of Grace&quot;, featured in the Season 2 finale of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;; Season 1 episode 4 of &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;; and the film &quot;Moll Flanders&quot;.

McLachlan released the live album &quot;Mirrorball&quot; in June 1999. The album&#x27;s singles included a new live version of her earlier song, &quot;I Will Remember You&quot;, a studio recording of which had previously been released on &quot;The Brothers McMullen&quot; soundtrack as well as &quot;Rarities, B-Sides and Other Stuff&quot;. Originally released as a single in 1995, where it peaked No. 65 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and No. 10 in Canada, the 1999 version peaked at No. 14 on the Hot 100, reached No. 10 again in Canada, and garnered McLachlan her third Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 42nd Grammy Awards. Later that year, McLachlan recorded the Randy Newman song &quot;When She Loved Me&quot; on the &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; soundtrack as the off-screen singing voice of the character Jessie. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 2000, and McLachlan performed it at the awards ceremony, but did not win.

Following the death of her mother in December 2001, and the birth of her first daughter India, Mclachlan took a break from writing music, and shifted her focus to motherhood.

=== 2003–2006: &quot;Afterglow&quot; and &quot;Wintersong&quot; ===
McLachlan released her fifth studio album, &quot;Afterglow&quot;, in November 2003. The album was preceded by the single &quot;Fallen&quot; in September, while two of its tracks, &quot;Stupid&quot; and &quot;World on Fire&quot;, were released as supporting singles the following year. McLachlan had contemplated the prospect of losing career momentum during the album&#x27;s creation and has described its writing process as similar to &quot;extracting blood from a stone&quot;. All songs for the album were written over a two and a half year period and recorded at either Marchand&#x27;s home studio in Montreal or McLachlan&#x27;s home studio in Vancouver. &quot;Afterglow&quot; topped the Canadian Albums Chart, and debuted at No. 2 in the US with over 300,000 copies sold in its opening week. It has since been certified 5× platinum in Canada, and 2× platinum in the US. &quot;Fallen&quot; was later nominated for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 46th Annual Grammy Awards, while &quot;Afterglow&quot; received a nomination for Best Pop Vocal Album at the 47th Annual Grammy Awards.

Prior to embarking on the Afterglow Live tour in May 2004, McLachlan released the digital extended play &quot;Acoustic Live&quot;, which included renditions of two songs from &quot;Afterglow&quot;, and rerecorded &quot;World on Fire&quot; with Robbie Robertson for the TNT series &quot;Into the West&quot;. The tour took place through 2005. &quot;Afterglow Live&quot;, a CD+DVD recording package of one of the Canada stops was released in November 2004.
In October 2006, McLachlan released a Christmas album, &quot;Wintersong&quot;. The album included 11 new recordings, featuring covers of Joni Mitchell&#x27;s &quot;River&quot;, Gordon Lightfoot&#x27;s &quot;Song for a Winter&#x27;s Night&quot;, and John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Happy Xmas (War Is Over)&quot;, which she recorded with her outreach children and youth choir, and seasonal favourites: &quot;Christmas Time Is Here&quot;, &quot;O Little Town of Bethlehem&quot;, &quot;Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas&quot;, &quot;Silent Night&quot;, &quot;The First Noel&quot;, and &quot;Greensleeves (What Child Is This?)&quot;, among others. The title track is an original work of McLachlan&#x27;s. &quot;Wintersong&quot; debuted at No. 42 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 for the week ending November 4, 2006, and peaked at No. 7. It was certified Platinum in the US in December 2007. According to Nielsen Music, the album has sold 1.1 million copies in the country as of November 2016. In Canada, it is certified 3× Platinum. &quot;Wintersong&quot; was nominated for both a Grammy Award, in the Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album category, as well as for a Juno Award, for &quot;Pop Album of the Year&quot;.

On October 3, 2006, the live album &quot;Mirrorball&quot; was re-released as &quot;Mirrorball: The Complete Concert&quot;. This release contains two discs that were compiled from two concerts performed on consecutive nights in April 1998 at the Rose Garden arena in Portland, Oregon.

=== 2014–2015: &quot;Shine On&quot; ===
In late January 2014, McLachlan announced the release of her next studio album, &quot;Shine On&quot;, which was inspired by the death of her father. It was her first release on Verve Records, after leaving Nettwerk/Arista after over twenty years. Released on May 6, the album debuted at No. 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with 42,000 copies sold during the week ending May 11. She embarked on the Shine On tour across the United States in support of the album. Its opening show took place in Seattle on June 20. The tour visited 30 cities all together. The Canadian leg included 25 shows in 21 cities.

McLachlan won Adult Contemporary Album of the Year for &quot;Shine On&quot; at the Juno Awards in March 2015 and was additionally nominated for Artist of the Year, but did not win.

After this release, McLachlan mostly stepped back from public life to focus on motherhood and philanthropic work.

=== 2016–present: &quot;Wonderland&quot; ===
On October 21, 2016, McLachlan released &quot;Wonderland&quot;, her ninth studio and second Christmas album; it contains interpretations of 13 traditional and contemporary holiday classics. She promoted the album with various televised performances, including at the &quot;Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade&quot; on November 24; ABC&#x27;s &quot;CMA Country Christmas&quot; special on November 28; and NBC&#x27;s annual &quot;Christmas in Rockefeller Center&quot; special on November 30. That December, McLachlan released the single &quot;The Long Goodbye&quot;.

In January 2019, McLachlan was announced as the host of the Juno Awards of 2019. In an interview the following month, McLachlan stated that she was set to debut a new song titled &quot;Wilderness&quot; during her then-current tour.

McLachlan participated in an all-star recording of Serena Ryder&#x27;s 2012 song &quot;What I Wouldn&#x27;t Do&quot; in 2023. It was released as a charity single on March 2 to benefit the Feel Out Loud campaign by Kids Help Phone in support of youth mental health. At the end of the year, she announced a 30-city tour to be held in 2024 for the 30th anniversary of &quot;Fumbling Towards Ecstasy&quot; (1993), with the setlist comprising the album&#x27;s entire tracklist in addition to other songs from her repertoire;in November 2024, she canceled the tour due to acute laryngitis, having postponed the tour earlier.

In April 2024, McLachlan stated she was working on new music with producer Tony Berg.

== Lilith Fair ==

In 1996, McLachlan became frustrated with concert promoters and radio stations that refused to feature two female musicians in a row. Bucking conventional industry wisdom, she booked a successful tour for herself and Paula Cole. At least one of their appearances together – in McLachlan&#x27;s home town, on September 14, 1996 – went by the name &quot;Lilith Fair&quot; and included performances by McLachlan, Cole, Lisa Loeb, and Michelle McAdorey, formerly of Crash Vegas.

The next year, McLachlan founded the Lilith Fair tour, taking &quot;Lilith&quot; from the medieval Jewish legend that Lilith was Adam&#x27;s first wife.

In 1997, Lilith Fair, featuring McLachlan as one of the headlining acts, garnered a $16 million gross, making it the top-grossing of any touring festival. Among all concert tours for that year, it was the 16th highest grossing. Lilith Fair tour brought together two million people over its three-year history and raised more than $7 million for charities. It was the most successful all-female music festival in history, one of the biggest music festivals of the 1990s, and helped launch the careers of several well-known female artists. Subsequent Lilith Fairs followed in 1998 and 1999 before the tour was discontinued.

Nettwerk CEO and Lilith Fair co-founder Terry McBride announced that the all-female festival would make its return in mid-2010 in Canada, the United States, and Europe. A list of 36 North American shows was released, but poor ticket sales, financial problems, and headliners&#x27; withdrawing out of fear of not being paid, caused 13 of the shows to be cancelled. The two-week European tour never materialized.

== Additional projects and guest appearances ==

In 1997, McLachlan co-wrote and provided guest vocals on the Delerium song &quot;Silence&quot; for their album &quot;Karma&quot;. The song achieved significant US top 40 airplay when released as a single in late 2000, and also featured on the soundtrack for the movie &quot;Brokedown Palace&quot;. It has been hailed as one of the greatest trance songs of all time, over a decade after its initial release. The Tiësto remix of the song was voted by &quot;Mixmag&quot; readers as the 12th greatest dance record of all time.

In 2001, McLachlan provided background vocals, guitar, and piano on the closing track &quot;Love Is&quot; from Stevie Nicks&#x27; eighth solo album, &quot;Trouble in Shangri-La&quot;, in addition to drawing the dragon used for the &quot;S&quot; in Stevie&#x27;s name on the album cover. In May 2002, her duet with Bryan Adams, &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Go&quot;, was released on the &quot;&quot; soundtrack. She sang harmonies and played the piano on the song while Sood did the drum work.

In 2003, she appeared as a celebrity NPC in &quot;The Sims Superstar&quot;.

In November 2006, McLachlan contributed &quot;Ordinary Miracle&quot; to the soundtrack of &quot;Charlotte&#x27;s Web&quot;. There were rumors of a potential Oscar nomination for the song, but it was not nominated. She performed the song on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;; during the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade; and at the opening ceremony of the 2010 Winter Olympics.

McLachlan participated in Dave Stewart&#x27;s 2007 single &quot;Go Green&quot;, alongside Nadirah X, Imogen Heap, Natalie Imbruglia, and others. The song was released in April of that year in honor of Earth Day.

In 2009, McLachlan provided backing vocals and piano on Susan Enan&#x27;s song &quot;Bring on the Wonder&quot;, which was featured in the television show &quot;Bones&quot;. Enan and McLachlan included the song on their &quot;Plainsong&quot; and &quot;Laws of Illusion&quot; (2010) albums respectively. 

On September 10, 2011, McLachlan performed &quot;I Will Remember You&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot; at a ceremony in Stonycreek, Pennsylvania, commemorating the passengers and crew of hijacked United Airlines Flight 93 who fought the hijackers and brought down their airplane on September 11, 2001. The event marked the dedication of the Flight 93 National Memorial and was attended by former President George W. Bush, former First Lady Laura Bush, former President Bill Clinton, Vice President Joe Biden and Speaker John Boehner.

On June 13, 2019, McLachlan sang &quot;O Canada&quot; before Game 6 of the 2019 NBA Finals.

In 1998, she won Female Vocalist of the Year, Songwriter of the Year (along with Pierre Marchand), Single of the Year for &quot;Building a Mystery&quot;, and Album of the Year for &quot;Surfacing&quot;. In 2000, she won an International Achievement award and in 2004, won Pop Album of the Year for &quot;Afterglow&quot; and again shared the Songwriter of the Year award with Pierre Marchand for the singles &quot;Fallen&quot;, &quot;World on Fire&quot;, and &quot;Stupid&quot;. In 2009 she was presented with the Humanitarian Award and she won the Adult Contemporary Album of the year award in 2015 for &quot;Shine On&quot; and again in 2017 for &quot;Wonderland&quot;.

McLachlan&#x27;s song &quot;Building a Mystery&quot; came in at 91 on VH1&#x27;s 100 Greatest Songs of the 90s.

McLachlan was awarded the Elizabeth Cady Stanton Visionary Award in 1998 for advancing the careers of women in music. In 1999, she was appointed as an Officer of the Order of Canada by then-Governor General Adrienne Clarkson in recognition of her successful recording career, her role in Lilith Fair, and the charitable donations she made to women&#x27;s shelters across Canada. In 2001, she was inducted to the Order of British Columbia.

On June 15, 2011, she was recognized with an honorary degree from Simon Fraser University.

On September 17, 2024 Canada Post released stamp honoring McLachlan.

==Philanthropy==
===Sarah McLachlan School of Music===
McLachlan also funds an outreach program in Vancouver that provides music education for inner city children. In 2007, the provincial government announced $500,000 in funding for the outreach program. Originating at the &quot;Sarah McLachlan Music Outreach&quot;, this program evolved into the Sarah McLachlan School of Music. This program provided children with high quality music instruction in guitar, piano, percussion and choir.

In 2011 McLachlan opened the Sarah McLachlan School of Music in Vancouver, a free music school for at-risk youth. The School of Music provides group and private lessons to hundreds of young people every year. It is their goal that through music education, students will develop a love of the arts and have greater self-esteem.

On May 25, 2016, the Sarah McLachlan School of Music expanded to Edmonton, Alberta, opening in Rundle Elementary School and Eastglen High School. The music school contains the same initiative as the Vancouver school.

===ASPCA===
McLachlan supported the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals by appearing in advertisements. She filmed a two-minute advertisement for the organization which featured her song &quot;Angel&quot;. The advertisement&#x27;s imagery of shelter animals mixed with the soundtrack and McLachlan&#x27;s simple appeal for donations has raised $30 million for the ASPCA since it began to air in 2006, which allowed the organization to air appeals in higher profile prime-time cable ad slots; subsequently the organization produced a new ad for the 2008 holiday season featuring McLachlan appealing for the ASPCA over her &quot;Wintersong&quot; performance of &quot;Silent Night&quot;, and a new ad with her was released in January 2009 featuring the song &quot;Answer&quot;. In 2012, McLachlan wrote a letter on behalf of PETA to then-Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, protesting that country&#x27;s annual seal hunt. During Super Bowl XLVIII on February 3, 2014, McLachlan parodied her ASPCA appeals in an Audi commercial featuring a &quot;Doberhuahua&quot; dog gnawing on the neck of her guitar. She would also do another parody of these appeals on Super Bowl LVII on February 12, 2023, this time for a commercial for Busch Light.

=== Other charitable contributions ===

McLachlan contributed the track &quot;Hold On&quot; to the 1993 AIDS-benefit album &quot;No Alternative&quot;, produced by the Red Hot Organization. She also performed at the Leonard Peltier Defense Fund Benefit Concert on February 12, 1997, and went on to release a cover version of &quot;Unchained Melody&quot; created as part of her support for Peltier. It was later included on the album &quot;Rarities, B-Sides and Other Stuff Volume 2&quot;.

In early 2005, McLachlan took part in a star-studded tsunami disaster relief telethon on NBC. On January 29 McLachlan was a headliner for a benefit concert in Vancouver along with other Canadian superstars such as Avril Lavigne and Bryan Adams. The show also featured a performance by the Sarah McLachlan Musical Outreach Choir &amp; Percussion Ensemble, a children&#x27;s choir and percussion band from the aforementioned Vancouver outreach program. Entitled &quot;One World: The Concert for Tsunami Relief&quot;, the concert raised approximately $3.6 million for several Canadian aid agencies working in south and southeast Asia.

On July 2, 2005, McLachlan participated in the Philadelphia installment of the Live 8 concerts, where she performed her hit &quot;Angel&quot; with Josh Groban. These concerts were intended to coincide with the G8 summit to put pressure on the leaders of the world&#x27;s richest nations to fight poverty in Africa by cancelling debt.

In 2008, she donated a song to Aid Still Required&#x27;s CD to assist with the restoration of the devastation done to Southeast Asia from the 2004 tsunami.

On November 30, 2012, McLachlan lent her support to Kate Winslet&#x27;s Golden Hat Foundation together with Tim Janis, Loreena McKennitt, Andrea Corr, Hayley Westenra, Sleepy Man Banjo Boys, Dawn Kenney, Jana Mashonee, Amy Petty and a choir etc. performing on &quot;The American Christmas Carol&quot; concert in Carnegie Hall.

McLachlan is a member of the Canadian charity Artists Against Racism.

<text>Chantal Jennifer Kreviazuk ( ; born May 18, 1973) is a Canadian singer, songwriter, composer, and pianist. Born in Winnipeg, she played music from a young age before signing with Columbia Records in the 1990s. Her debut studio album, &quot;Under These Rocks and Stones&quot;, was first released in Canada in 1996 and saw commercial success before being issued in the United States the following year to critical praise.

Kreviazuk released two more studio albums with the Columbia label, &quot;Colour Moving and Still&quot; (1999) and &quot;What If It All Means Something&quot; (2002), both of which brought moderate commercial success worldwide. She signed with Sony BMG for her fourth album, &quot;Ghost Stories&quot; (2006), which reached number two on the Canadian Albums Chart.

Since 2003, Kreviazuk has co-written and composed numerous songs for other artists as well as film soundtracks, and has appeared in several Canadian independent and short films. Her fifth album, &quot;Plain Jane&quot;, was released by Canadian independent label MapleMusic Recordings in 2009. Her most recent albums, &quot;Hard Sail&quot; and &quot;Get To You&quot;, were released by Warner Music Canada in 2016 and 2020, respectively. She also released a Christmas album in 2019, called &quot;Christmas Is A Way Of Life, My Dear&quot;.

From the beginning of her career to 2016, Kreviazuk was the 51st best-selling Canadian artist in Canada.

Kreviazuk is a three-time Juno Award winner and she has collaborated with several other musicians, including Drake, Pitbull, Christina Aguilera, Carrie Underwood, Kendrick Lamar and Pink.

==Career==
===Albums===
Kreviazuk&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Under These Rocks and Stones&quot;, was first issued in Canada in October 1996 before being released in the US June 1997 to critical praise. The album sold over 150,000 copies in Canada according to SoundScan, fueled mostly by the singles &quot;Surrounded&quot; and &quot;God Made Me&quot;. Three videos from the album received modest play on the video channel MuchMusic and radio (&quot;God Made Me&quot;, &quot;Believer&quot; and &quot;Wayne&quot;), but it was a fourth, &quot;Surrounded&quot;, that became her first major Canadian airplay hit in 1997. That year, Kreviazuk received her first Juno Award nomination as Best New Artist. She also took part in the 1998 Lilith Fair music festival; &quot;Surrounded&quot; was included in the live compilation album from that year.

In 1999, Kreviazuk released her second album. Titled &quot;Colour Moving and Still&quot;, it featured tracks written with her new husband, Raine Maida, lead singer of Our Lady Peace. The lead single from the album &quot;Before You&quot; became a huge radio hit in Canada and she performed the single on the 2000 Juno Awards, where she won two awards for &quot;Best Adult/Pop Album&quot; and &quot;Best Female Artist&quot;. Kreviazuk released two more videos from the album, &quot;Dear Life&quot; and &quot;Far Away&quot;, as well as an additional radio release, &quot;Souls&quot;, which was also remixed and was released as a promo vinyl for the M1 &amp; Steve Fernandez Remix.

Her third album, &quot;What If It All Means Something&quot;, was released in 2002. This album also featured multiple collaborations with Maida. The first single, &quot;In This Life&quot;, was a hit in Canada. Kreviazuk performed the song live on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;.

Kreviazuk began writing and recording her fourth album in her home studio in August, 2005, with Maida producing. The first single off the album, &quot;All I Can Do&quot;, was made available on her official website and MySpace page prior to the release of the album. On July 24 the album premiered on the Canadian music channel Much More Music along with a behind the scenes special. The album, &quot;Ghost Stories&quot;, was released August 29, 2006.

On October 28, 2008, she released her first compilation album, &quot;Since We Met: The Best of 1996-2006&quot;.

On October 13, 2009, she released her fifth studio album, &quot;Plain Jane&quot;.

She is featured on a song called &quot;Over My Dead Body&quot; by fellow Canadian recording artist Drake from his 2011 album &quot;Take Care&quot;.

Her first live album, entitled &quot;In This Life&quot;, was released on July 3, 2012.

She featured on rapper Jay Rock&#x27;s track &quot;Pay for It&quot;, which she performed alongside Jay Rock and Kendrick Lamar on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on November 15, 2014.

In November 2014, Kreviazuk released a new single called &quot;I Will Be&quot;, speaking to her desire to want to help those who feel alone and isolated. She sang the song live on December 12 on the Toronto radio station 104.5 CHUM FM.

<text>The L game is a simple abstract strategy board game invented by Edward de Bono. It was introduced in his book &quot;The Five-Day Course in Thinking&quot; (1967).

==Description==
The L game is a two-player game played on a board of 4×4 squares. Each player has a 3×2 L-shaped tetromino, and there are two 1×1 neutral pieces.

===Rules===
On each turn, a player must first move their L piece, and then may optionally move either one of the neutral pieces. The game is won by leaving the opponent unable to move their L piece to a new position.

Pieces may not overlap or cover other pieces, or let the pieces off the board. On moving the L piece, it is picked up and then placed in empty squares anywhere on the board. It may be rotated or even flipped over in doing so; the only rule is that it must end in a different position from the position it started—thus covering at least one square it did not previously cover. To move a neutral piece, a player simply picks it up then places it in an empty square anywhere on the board.

==Strategy==
One basic strategy is to use a neutral piece and one&#x27;s own piece to block a 3×3 square in one corner, and use a neutral piece to prevent the opponent&#x27;s L piece from swapping to a mirror-image position. Another basic strategy is to move an L piece to block a half of the board, and use the neutral pieces to prevent the opponent&#x27;s possible alternate positions.

These positions can often be achieved once a neutral piece is left in one of the eight killer spaces on the perimeter of the board. The killer spaces are the spaces on the perimeter, but not in a corner. On the next move, one either makes the previously placed killer a part of one&#x27;s square, or uses it to block a perimeter position, and makes a square or half-board block with one&#x27;s own L and a moved neutral piece.

==Analysis==

In a game with two perfect players, neither will ever win or lose. The L game is small enough to be completely solvable. There are 2296 different possible valid ways the pieces can be arranged, not counting a rotation or mirror of an arrangement as a new arrangement, and considering the two neutral pieces to be identical. Any arrangement can be reached during the game, with it being any player&#x27;s turn. Each player has lost in 15 of these arrangements, if it is that player&#x27;s turn. The losing arrangements involve the losing player&#x27;s L piece touching a corner. Each player will also soon lose to a perfect player in an additional 14 arrangements. A player will be able to at least force a draw (by playing forever without losing) from the remaining 2267 positions.

Even if neither player plays perfectly, defensive play can continue indefinitely if the players are too cautious to move a neutral piece to the killer positions. If both players are at this level, a sudden-death variant of the rules permits one to move both neutral pieces after moving. A player who can look three moves ahead can defeat defensive play using the standard rules.

<doc id="149083" wikidata="Q7410863" url="?curid=149083" title="Samuel Bamford">
<text>Samuel Bamford (28 February 1788 – 13 April 1872) was an English radical reformer and writer born in Middleton, Lancashire. He wrote on the subject of northern English dialect and wrote some of his better known verse in it.

==Biography==
Bamford was one of five children born to Daniel Bamford (a muslin weaver and part-time teacher, and later master of the Salford workhouse), and his wife, Hannah. He was baptised on 11 April 1788 at St Leonard&#x27;s Church, Middleton.

After his father withdrew him from Manchester Grammar School, Bamford became a weaver and then a warehouseman in Manchester. Exposure to Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; and to the poems of John Milton influenced Bamford to begin writing poetry himself.

On 24 June 1810, he married Jemema (or Jemima) Sheppard at the Collegiate Church of St Mary, St Denys and St George, in Manchester, now known as Manchester Cathedral. In 1851 or thereabouts, Bamford obtained a situation as a messenger for the Inland Revenue at Somerset House, but soon returned to weaving. The 1861 England Census records that Samuel, as a &quot;public reader and agent&quot; resided with Jemina in Hall Street, Manchester. They appear to have been childless.

==Radicalism==
Bamford&#x27;s radical political beliefs led him to be heavily involved in resistance to the British government and to witness to several important historical events relating to working-class advocacy and public defiance.

===Arrests for treason===
In 1817 he was remanded in jail to the New Bailey Prison in Salford on suspicion of high treason, on account of his political activities. From there he was taken to London and examined before the Privy Council, presided over by Lord Sidmouth as Home Secretary. After promising future good behaviour, Bamford was released and allowed to return to his cottage at Middleton with his wife Jemima.

In August 1819, he led a group from Middleton to St Peter&#x27;s Fields for a meeting that pressed for parliamentary reform and repeal of the Corn Laws. There they witnessed the Peterloo Massacre, and Bamford was arrested and charged with treason. Although there was no evidence shown that either he or any of his group had been involved in the violence, he was found guilty of inciting a riot and sentenced to a year in Lincoln prison.

The massacre had a deep impact on Bamford, convincing him that state power always succeeded against radical militancy. He came to be seen as a voice for radical reform, but opposed to activism involving physical force. Bamford responded to the claim that his political group had used violence to pursue their reforming ends, in &quot;Passages in the Life of a Radical and Early Days&quot; (1840–1844), &quot;It was not until we became infested by spies, incendiaries, and their dupes – distracting, misleading, and betraying – that physical force was mentioned amongst us. After that our moral power waned, and what we gained by the accession of demagogues, we lost by their criminal violence, and the estrangement of real friends.&quot;

===Poetry and other writings===
Bamford was the author of poetry mostly in standard English, but of those in dialect, several that showed sympathy with the conditions of the working classes became widely popular. Around 1840 he also became associated with the Sun Inn Group, a collective of fellow working class poets who met regularly at the Sun Inn on Long Millgate in Manchester, where his status as a Peterloo veteran made him an inspiration for younger peers. This was also when he authored &quot;Passages in the Life of a Radical&quot; (1840–1844), his authoritative history of the condition of the working classes in the years after the Battle of Waterloo.

In 1850, he published &quot;Tawk o&#x27;Seawth Lankeshur, by Samhul Beamfort,&quot; which, following the first one written in standard English, even adds a second title page and publishing information in local dialect. It begins:

&lt;poem&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;

Continuing his interest in dialect, he also compiled &quot;The Dialect of South Lancashire&quot; in 1854.

===Death and legacy===
In the 1871 England Census, taken the year before Bamford&#x27;s death, he is recorded as living at 109 Hall Street, Harpurhey, as a widower, with a widowed housekeeper, Elizabeth Hilton.

Bamford died in Harpurhey on the 13th of April 1872 at the age of 84 and was given a public funeral in Middleton on the 20th, attended by several thousand people. A memorial obelisk unveiled in Middleton Cemetery in 1877 reads in part, &quot;Bamford was a reformer when to be so was unsafe, and he suffered for his faith.&quot;

In 2000 &quot;The Diaries of Samuel Bamford&quot; were released, edited by Robert Poole and a critical Martin Hewitt, according to whom &quot;Bamford&#x27;s career, not least its virulent anti-Chartism, have tainted him with reformism, and left him to be invoked as an example of the weaknesses and limitations of early nineteenth-century working-class political assertion.&quot;

<doc id="149088" wikidata="Q953452" url="?curid=149088" title="Lihou">
<text>Lihou () is a small tidal island located just off the west coast of the island of Guernsey, in the English Channel, between Great Britain and France. Administratively, Lihou forms part of the Parish of St. Peter&#x27;s in the Bailiwick of Guernsey, and is now owned by the parliament of Guernsey (the States of Guernsey), although there have been a number of owners in the past. Since 2006, the island has been jointly managed by the Guernsey Environment Department and the Lihou Charitable Trust. In the past the island was used by locals for the collection of seaweed for use as a fertiliser, but today Lihou is mainly used for tourism, including school trips. Lihou is also an important centre for conservation, forming part of a Ramsar wetland site for the preservation of rare birds and plants as well as historic ruins of a priory and a farmhouse.

==Etymology==
In common with several nearby islands, such as Jethou and Brecqhou, the name contains the Norman suffix &quot;&quot;-hou&quot; which means a small hill or a mound. The name could have developed from the Breton words &quot;lydd&quot; or &quot;ligg&quot;, which means &quot;in or near water&quot;. Historically, there have also been a number of alternative forms of the name including &quot;Lihoumel&quot;, which was attested as early as the twelfth century, and &quot;Lehowe&quot;, which was mentioned in the sixteenth century.

Lihou is also a common family name on Guernsey, with records suggesting that the name has been in use in the Channel Islands since at least the eighteenth century, including Royal Navy Captain John Lihou, who discovered and named the Australian Port Lihou Island and Lihou Reef. The name is also attested further afield, in a number of other countries, such as Australia, where for example, Sergeant James Lihou, the son of a migrant from Guernsey, enlisted in the Australian forces in 1916 and was killed in action in 1918 in France. There are also numerous instances of people with the surname having migrated from the Channel Islands to the United States.

==Geography and climate==
Lihou is the furthest west of the Channel Islands and at low tide it is linked to the nearby L&#x27;Erée headland, on Guernsey, by a stone causeway. Apart from shingle beaches, the island has a high ridge running approximately north–south. Lihou is mainly composed of weathered rock below which are found granite and gneiss bedrock. The island has a mild oceanic climate like other Channel Islands, due to being buffered by the nearby English and French coastlines. Lihou shares the weather features of Guernsey, with winter temperatures falling to in February and summers with a high of in August.
Two small islets, close to the island, called Lissroy and Lihoumel, are breeding places for a number of endangered species of birds, including Eurasian oystercatchers and common ringed plovers. Numerous other species of birds and plants are found on Lihou such as peregrine falcons and sea storksbill. The Guernsey Environment Department does not allow visitors to go to the two islets and the shingle bank at certain times of the year in order to allow the birds to breed. Approximately north of the island is a submerged ledge called Grand Etacre, which was considered to be a hazard to navigation in the nineteenth century.

Lihou island was identified as a &quot;Site of Nature Conservation Importance&quot; in 1989, and as part of an &quot;Important Bird Area&quot;&quot; which includes parts of the shoreline of Guernsey. On 1 March 2006, Lihou and the L&#x27;Erée headland were designated a part of Guernsey&#x27;s first Ramsar wetland site, covering about of land and sea. This has created a marine reserve for the extensive variety of wildlife including more than 200 species of seaweed on the shores of Lihou, and more than 150 species of birds observed in the area.

The geology of Lihou Island is rather complex, but closely associated with neighbouring Guernsey.

==History==

The history of Lihou is closely linked to the history of Guernsey in particular and the Channel Islands in general. The earliest evidence of habitation are Mesolithic era objects recovered from archaeological digs of the 1990s, along with Neolithic era tombs on the nearby mainland. The recorded history of Lihou began in 933 AD when the Channel Islands were seized from Brittany by the ruler of Normandy. Lihou and the nearby Neolithic tombs were traditionally believed to have been meeting places for local witches, and fairies. This led to conflict with church authorities, especially when a priory was established on Lihou, dedicated to St. Mary (known locally as &quot;Our Lady of Lihou&quot;). A number of dates have been suggested for the establishment of the priory, with estimates ranging from as early as 1114, to as late as 1156. Records suggest that the priory was an &quot;arriére-fief&quot; of the Benedictine abbey of Mont St. Michel under whose authority it operated. Ownership of the island was granted to the abbey by Robert I, Duke of Normandy, in the early part of the eleventh century. The priory is thought to have been constructed with contributions from the Guernseymen, who appear to have been fairly affluent at the time.
In the early fourteenth century, Lihou may have become the origin of a local legend about a wealthy Bailiff of Guernsey who attempted to have an innocent peasant executed on false charges of theft of silver cups. In either 1302 or 1304, a priory servant called Thomas le Roer was alleged to have murdered one of the monks. The Bailiff and several assistants attempted to apprehend Le Roer but he did not surrender and was subsequently killed by Ranulph Gautier, one of the Bailiff&#x27;s assistants. Gautier tried to find sanctuary in a nearby church and eventually fled to England, before returning to Guernsey when the king pardoned him. However, some years later Gautier was tortured to death in Castle Cornet, but it is not known why.

The priory was seized in 1414 by King Henry V of England along with a number of alien priories. In the first three centuries, there were several Priors appointed, sometimes with short tenures, but in 1500 Ralph Leonard was installed as Prior for life. However, within decades the Priory was abandoned, with evidence of Thomas de Baugy being the final Prior around 1560. There is also evidence that the priory was allocated to John After in 1566, who had also been appointed as the Dean of Guernsey.
In 1759 the Governor of Guernsey, John West, had the priory destroyed to prevent French forces from capturing the island during the Seven Years&#x27; War. In the early nineteenth century, a farmhouse was built on Lihou, and the island was listed as being owned by Eleazar le Marchant, who held the post of lieutenant bailiff of Guernsey. Eleazar made an ultimately unsuccessful attempt, in 1815, to suppress the seaweed industry based around Lihou. In a book published in the same year, William Berry noted the presence of an &quot;iron hook of a gate hinge&quot; on some rocks, approximately three miles out at sea from Lihou, along with the remains of old roads, and surmised that Lihou may have been significantly larger in the past but that the sea had eroded a considerable portion. Through the remainder of the nineteenth century and the start of the twentieth century, the island changed hands between a succession of owners including James Priaulx in 1863, Arthur Clayfield in 1883, and Colonel Hubert de Lancey Walters in 1906.

During World War II, the Channel Islands were occupied by the Germans from 1940 to 1945, and Lihou was used for target practice by the German artillery, causing the farmhouse to collapse completely. During the summer of 1952, the ruins of the priory were studied in some detail by John and Jean Le Patourel. In 1961, Lieutenant-Colonel Patrick Wootton purchased Lihou. Wootton had plans to develop the island, beginning in the following year first by clearing the area of the old farmhouse, in preparation for the building of a new farmhouse, with construction work continuing into 1963. He organized summer camps for young adults on the island and imported sheep from the Orkney Islands which could consume seaweed. In 1983 Wootton decided to emigrate to Prince Edward Island, in Canada, and the island was sold to Robin and Patricia Borwick. In 1995 the island was bought by the States of Guernsey. The ruins of the priory are possibly the most extensive religious relic in Guernsey. There have been several studies and excavations of the ruins, including archaeological investigations in 1996, and in 1998, when several twelfth-fourteenth century graves were unearthed.

==Economy==

Historically, Lihou was an important location for a commercially significant industry based around the harvesting of seaweed (or &quot;vraic&quot; in the local language, Guernésiais). Records suggest considerable activity as early as the beginning of the nineteenth century. The value of the seaweed as a fertiliser was so great that in 1815 Eleazor Le Marchant, lieutenant bailiff of Guernsey and owner of Lihou, initiated a court case to prevent islanders from drying seaweed on the beaches of Lihou. The case eventually led to new regulations issued in 1818 by the Bailiwick legislature, known as the Chief Pleas at the time, based on a review of ancient royal decrees. However, the Royal Court of Guernsey ruled in favour of the islanders in 1821, with the effect that permission to harvest seaweed on Lihou was granted to inhabitants of the parishes of St Peters and St Saviours. More than a century later, in 1927, a factory was established on the island to produce iodine from the seaweed.

The economic mainstay of the island is now ecological tourism, based around the farmhouse, which is operated by the Lihou Charitable Trust, although overall responsibility for the island remains with the Environment Department of the States of Guernsey. Lihou and several other small Channel Islands such as Herm and Sark, issued their own stamps until 1969, when the States of Guernsey assumed responsibility for postal services in the Bailiwick, which had previously been provided by the UK Government.

==Protection==
The whole of the building known as the Priory of St Mary, Lihou and surrounding area was listed as a Protected Monument on 26 March 1938, reference PM236. From 1 March 2006, Lihou and the L&#x27;Erée headland were designated a part of Guernsey&#x27;s first Ramsar wetland site.

<text>A Man Called Horse by Dorothy M. Johnson was originally published as a short story in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; magazine, January 7, 1950, and was reprinted in 1953 as a short story in her book &quot;Indian Country&quot;. It was later made into a &quot;Wagon Train&quot; episode in 1958 and into a film in 1970 with Richard Harris in the lead role as John Morgan and Manu Tupou as Yellow Hand.

==Plot summary==
The protagonist is a Boston aristocrat who is captured by a Native American tribe. Initially enslaved, he later comes to respect his captors&#x27; culture and gains their respect. He joins the tribe by showing his bravery and, later, gets back his dignity by marrying his owner&#x27;s daughter, killing rival Indians and taking their horses. Taking the native name &quot;Horse&quot; (he was treated as a horse), he becomes a respected member of the tribe.
