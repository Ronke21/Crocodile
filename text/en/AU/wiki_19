<text>Shivaji I (Shivaji Shahaji Bhonsale, ; 19 February 1630 – 3 April 1680) was an Indian ruler and a member of the Bhonsle dynasty. Shivaji carved out his own independent kingdom from the Sultanate of Bijapur that formed the genesis of the Maratha Confederacy. Shivaji I was the founder of the Maratha Empire which later become the Maratha Confederacy.

Shivaji offered passage and his service to the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb to invade the declining Sultanate of Bijapur. After Aurangzeb&#x27;s departure for the north due to a war of succession, Shivaji conquered territories ceded by Bijapur in the name of the Mughals. Following his defeat at the hands of Jai Singh I in the Battle of Purandar, Shivaji entered into vassalage with the Mughal empire, assuming the role of a Mughal chief and was conferred with the title of &quot;Raja&quot; by Aurangzeb. He undertook military expeditions on behalf of the Mughal empire for a brief duration. Over the course of his life, Shivaji engaged in both alliances and hostilities with the Mughal Empire, the Sultanate of Golconda, the Sultanate of Bijapur and the European colonial powers.

In 1674, Shivaji was crowned as the king despite opposition from local Brahmins. Praised for his chivalrous treatment of women, Shivaji employed people of all castes and religions, including Muslims and Europeans, in his administration and armed forces. Shivaji&#x27;s military forces expanded the Maratha sphere of influence, capturing and building forts, and forming a Maratha navy.

Shivaji&#x27;s legacy was revived by Jyotirao Phule about two centuries after his death. Later on, he came to be glorified by Indian nationalists such as Bal Gangadhar Tilak, and appropriated by Hindutva activists.

== Early life ==

Shivaji was born in the hill-fort of Shivneri, near Junnar, which is now in Pune district. Scholars disagree on his date of birth; the Government of Maharashtra lists 19 February as a holiday commemorating Shivaji&#x27;s birth (Shivaji Jayanti). Shivaji was named after a local deity, the Goddess Shivai Devi.

Shivaji belonged to a Maratha family of the Bhonsle clan. Shivaji&#x27;s father, Shahaji Bhonsle, was a Maratha general who served the Deccan Sultanates. His mother was Jijabai, the daughter of Lakhuji Jadhavrao of Sindhkhed, a Mughal-aligned sardar claiming descent from a Yadav royal family of Devagiri. His paternal grandfather Maloji (1552–1597) was an influential general of Ahmadnagar Sultanate, and was awarded the epithet of &quot;Raja&quot;. He was given &quot;deshmukhi&quot; rights of Pune, Supe, Chakan, and Indapur to provide for military expenses. He was also given Fort Shivneri for his family&#x27;s residence ().

At the time of Shivaji&#x27;s birth, power in the Deccan was shared by three Islamic sultanates: Bijapur, Ahmednagar, Golkonda, and the Mughal Empire. Shahaji often changed his loyalty between the Nizamshahi of Ahmadnagar, the Adilshahi of Bijapur and the Mughals, but always kept his &quot;jagir&quot; (fiefdom) at Pune and his small army. 

Scholar James Laine states that Shivaji was imbued with the dream of re-establishing a Hindu kingdom by his mother, Jijabai, who was aware of her Yadava heritage and considered her husband &quot;a collaborator of low birth.&quot;

== Ancestry ==

== Conflict with Bijapur Sultanate ==

=== Background and context ===
In 1636, the Sultanate of Bijapur invaded the kingdoms to its south. The sultanate had recently become a tributary state of the Mughal Empire. It was being helped by Shahaji, who at the time was a chieftain in the Maratha uplands of western India. Shahaji was looking for opportunities of rewards of &quot;jagir&quot; land in the conquered territories, the taxes on which he could collect as an annuity.

Shahaji was a rebel from brief Mughal service. Shahaji&#x27;s campaigns against the Mughals, supported by the Bijapur government, were generally unsuccessful. He was constantly pursued by the Mughal army, and Shivaji and his mother Jijabai had to move from fort to fort.In 1636, Shahaji joined in the service of Bijapur and obtained Poona as a grant. Shahaji, being deployed in Bangalore by the Bijapuri ruler Adilshah, appointed Dadoji Kondadeo as Poona&#x27;s administrator. Shivaji and Jijabai settled in Poona. Kondadeo died in 1647 and Shivaji took over its administration. One of his first acts directly challenged the Bijapuri government.

=== Independent generalship ===
In 1646, 16-year-old Shivaji captured the Torna Fort through stratagem or bribery, taking advantage of the confusion prevailing in the Bijapur court due to the illness of Sultan Mohammed Adil Shah, and seized the large treasure he found there. In the following two years, Shivaji took several important forts near Pune, including Purandar, Kondhana, and Chakan. He also brought areas east of Pune around Supa, Baramati, and Indapur under his direct control. He used the treasure found at Torna to build a new fort named Rajgad. That fort served as the seat of his government for over a decade. After this, Shivaji turned west to the Konkan and took possession of the important town of Kalyan. The Bijapur government took note of these happenings and sought to take action. On 25 July 1648, Shahaji was imprisoned by a fellow Maratha sardar called Baji Ghorpade, under the orders of the Bijapur government, in a bid to contain Shivaji.

Shahaji was released in 1649, after the capture of Jinji secured Adilshah&#x27;s position in Karnataka. During 1649–1655, Shivaji paused in his conquests and quietly consolidated his gains. Following his father&#x27;s release, Shivaji resumed raiding, and in 1656, under controversial circumstances, killed Chandrarao More, a fellow Maratha feudatory of Bijapur, and seized the valley of Javali, near the present-day hill station of Mahabaleshwar. The conquest of Javali allowed Shivaji to extend his raids into south and southwest Maharashtra. In addition to the Bhonsle and the More families, many others—including Sawant of Sawantwadi, Ghorpade of Mudhol, Nimbalkar of Phaltan, Shirke, Gharge of Nimsod, Mane, and Mohite—also served Adilshahi of Bijapur, many with Deshmukhi rights. Shivaji adopted different strategies to subdue these powerful families, such as forming marital alliances, dealing directly with village Patils to bypass the Deshmukhs, or subduing them by force. Shahaji in his later years had an ambivalent attitude toward his son, and disavowed his rebellious activities. He told the Bijapuris to do whatever they wanted with Shivaji. Shahaji died around 1664–1665 in a hunting accident.

=== Combat with Afzal Khan ===

The Bijapur Sultanate was displeased with their losses to Shivaji&#x27;s forces, with their vassal Shahaji disavowing his son&#x27;s actions. After a peace treaty with the Mughals, and the general acceptance of the young Ali Adil Shah II as the sultan, the Bijapur government became more stable, and turned its attention towards Shivaji. In 1657, the sultan, or more likely his mother and regent, sent Afzal Khan, a veteran general, to arrest Shivaji. Before engaging him, the Bijapuri forces desecrated the Tulja Bhavani Temple, a holy site for Shivaji&#x27;s family, and the Vithoba temple at Pandharpur, a major pilgrimage site for Hindus.

Pursued by Bijapuri forces, Shivaji retreated to Pratapgad fort, where many of his colleagues pressed him to surrender. The two forces found themselves at a stalemate, with Shivaji unable to break the siege, while Afzal Khan, having a powerful cavalry but lacking siege equipment, was unable to take the fort. After two months, Afzal Khan sent an envoy to Shivaji suggesting the two leaders meet in private, outside the fort, for negotiations.

The two met in a hut in the foothills of Pratapgad fort on 10 November 1659. The arrangements had dictated that each come armed only with a sword, and attended by one follower. Shivaji, suspecting Afzal Khan would arrest or attack him, wore armour beneath his clothes, concealed a &quot;bagh nakh&quot; (metal &quot;tiger claw&quot;) on his left arm, and had a dagger in his right hand. What transpired is not known with historical certainty, mainly Maratha legends tell the tale; however, it is agreed that the two wound up in a physical struggle that proved fatal for Khan. Khan&#x27;s dagger failed to pierce Shivaji&#x27;s armour, but Shivaji disembowelled him; Shivaji then fired a cannon to signal his hidden troops to attack the Bijapuri army.

In the ensuing Battle of Pratapgarh, Shivaji&#x27;s forces decisively defeated the Bijapur Sultanate&#x27;s forces. More than 3,000 soldiers of the Bijapur army were killed; and one sardar of high rank, two sons of Afzal Khan, and two Maratha chiefs were taken prisoner. After the victory, a grand review was held by Shivaji below Pratapgarh. The captured enemy, both officers and men, were set free and sent back to their homes with money, food, and other gifts. Marathas were rewarded accordingly.

=== Siege of Panhala ===
Having defeated the Bijapuri forces sent against him, Shivaji and his army marched towards the Konkan coast and Kolhapur, seizing Panhala fort, and defeating Bijapuri forces sent against them, under Rustam Zaman and Fazl Khan, in 1659. In 1660, Adilshah sent his general Siddi Jauhar to attack Shivaji&#x27;s southern border, in alliance with the Mughals who planned to attack from the north. At that time, Shivaji was encamped at Panhala fort with his forces. Siddi Jauhar&#x27;s army besieged Panhala in mid-1660, cutting off supply routes to the fort. During the bombardment of Panhala, Siddi Jauhar purchased grenades from the English at Rajapur, and also hired some English artillerymen to assist in his bombardment of the fort, conspicuously flying a flag used by the English. This perceived betrayal angered Shivaji, who in December would retaliate by plundering the English factory at Rajapur and capturing four of the owners, imprisoning them until mid-1663.

After months of siege, Shivaji negotiated with Siddi Jauhar and handed over the fort on 22 September 1660, withdrawing to Vishalgad; Shivaji retook Panhala in 1673.

=== Battle of Pavan Khind ===
Shivaji escaped from Panhala by cover of night, and as he was pursued by the enemy cavalry, his Maratha sardar Baji Prabhu Deshpande of Bandal Deshmukh, along with 300 soldiers, volunteered to fight to the death to hold back the enemy at Ghod Khind (&quot;horse ravine&quot;) to give Shivaji and the rest of the army a chance to reach the safety of the Vishalgad fort.

In the ensuing battle of Pavan Khind, the smaller Maratha force held back the larger enemy to buy time for Shivaji to escape. Baji Prabhu Deshpande was wounded but continued to fight until he heard the sound of cannon fire from Vishalgad, signalling Shivaji had safely reached the fort, on the evening of 13 July 1660. &quot;Ghod Khind&quot; (&quot;khind&quot; meaning &quot;a narrow mountain pass&quot;) was later renamed &quot;Paavan Khind&quot; (&quot;sacred pass&quot;) in honour of Bajiprabhu Deshpande, Shibosingh Jadhav, Fuloji, and all other soldiers who fought there.

== Conflict with the Mughals ==

Until 1657, Shivaji maintained peaceful relations with the Mughal Empire. Shivaji offered his assistance to Aurangzeb, the son of the Mughal Emperor and viceroy of the Deccan, in conquering Bijapur, in return for formal recognition of his right to the Bijapuri forts and villages in his possession. Dissatisfied with the Mughal response, and receiving a better offer from Bijapur, he launched a raid into the Mughal Deccan. Shivaji&#x27;s confrontations with the Mughals began in March 1657, when two of Shivaji&#x27;s officers raided the Mughal territory near Ahmednagar. This was followed by raids in Junnar, with Shivaji carrying off 300,000 &quot;hun&quot; in cash and 200 horses. Aurangzeb responded to the raids by sending Nasiri Khan, who defeated the forces of Shivaji at Ahmednagar. However, Aurangzeb&#x27;s countermeasures against Shivaji were interrupted by the rainy season and his battles with his brothers over the succession to the Mughal throne, following the illness of the emperor Shah Jahan.

=== Attacks on Shaista Khan and Surat ===

At the request of Badi Begum of Bijapur, Aurangzeb, now the Mughal emperor, sent his maternal uncle Shaista Khan, with an army numbering over 150,000, along with a powerful artillery division, in January 1660 to attack Shivaji in conjunction with Bijapur&#x27;s army led by Siddi Jauhar. Shaista Khan, with his better equipped and well provisioned army of 80,000 seized Pune. He also took the nearby fort of Chakan, besieging it for a month and a half before breaching the walls. He established his residence at Shivaji&#x27;s palace of Lal Mahal.

On the night of 5 April 1663, Shivaji led a daring night attack on Shaista Khan&#x27;s camp. He, along with 400 men, attacked Shaista Khan&#x27;s mansion, broke into Khan&#x27;s bedroom and wounded him. Khan lost three fingers. In the scuffle, Shaista Khan&#x27;s son and several wives, servants, and soldiers were killed. The Khan took refuge with the Mughal forces outside of Pune, and Aurangzeb punished him for this embarrassment with a transfer to Bengal.

In retaliation for Shaista Khan&#x27;s attacks, and to replenish his now-depleted treasury, in 1664 Shivaji sacked the port city of Surat, a wealthy Mughal trading centre and decamped with plunder exceeding Rs 10 million. On 13 February 1665, he also conducted a naval raid on Portuguese-held Basrur in present-day Karnataka, and gained a large plunder.

=== Treaty of Purandar ===


The attacks on Shaista Khan and Surat enraged Aurangzeb. In response, he sent the Rajput general Jai Singh I with an army numbering around 15,000 to defeat Shivaji. Throughout 1665, Jai Singh&#x27;s forces pressed Shivaji, with their cavalry razing the countryside, and besieging Shivaji&#x27;s forts. The Mughal commander succeeded in luring away several of Shivaji&#x27;s key commanders, and many of his cavalrymen, into Mughal service. By mid-1665, with the fortress at Purandar besieged and near capture, Shivaji was forced to come to terms with Jai Singh. Shivaji is noted to have said when receiving Jai Singh &quot;I have come as a guilty slave to seek forgiveness, and it is for you to pardon or kill me at your pleasure.&quot;

In the Treaty of Purandar, signed by Shivaji and Jai Singh on 11 June 1665, Shivaji agreed to give up 23 of his forts, keeping 12 for himself, and pay compensation of 400,000 gold hun to the Mughals. Shivaji agreed to become a vassal of the Mughal empire, and to send his son Sambhaji, along with 5,000 horsemen, to fight for the Mughals in the Deccan, as a &quot;mansabdar&quot;.

Sambhaji was taken as a political prisoner to ensure compliance with the treaty. Shivaji himself wished to be excused from attending the court. To this end, he wrote letters to Aurangzeb, requesting forgiveness for his actions and security for himself along with a robe of honour. He also requested Jai Singh to support him in getting his crimes pardoned by the emperor, stating &quot;Now you are protector and a father to me, so I beg you to fulfil the ambition of your son.&quot; On September 15, 1665, Aurangzeb granted his request and sent him a letter and a firman along with a robe of honor. Shivaji responded with a letter thanking the emperor:
=== Arrest in Agra and escape ===
In 1666, Aurangzeb summoned Shivaji to Agra (though some sources instead state Delhi), along with his nine-year-old son Sambhaji. Aurangzeb planned to send Shivaji to Kandahar, now in Afghanistan, to consolidate the Mughal empire&#x27;s northwestern frontier. However, on 12 May 1666, Shivaji was made to stand at court alongside relatively low-ranking nobles, men he had already defeated in battle. Shivaji took offence, stormed out, and was promptly placed under house arrest. Ram Singh, son of Jai Singh, guaranteed custody of Shivaji and his son. The emperor also withheld the previous honors bestowed upon him such as his robe of honour, elephant and jewels.

Shivaji&#x27;s position under house arrest was perilous, as Aurangzeb&#x27;s court debated whether to kill him or continue employing him. Jai Singh, having assured Shivaji of his personal safety, tried to influence Aurangzeb&#x27;s decision. While Shivaji regarded himself as a king, in the eyes of the Mughal emperor, he was only a relatively successful rebel zamindar.

By the time the order for his posting to Kabul arrived, a rumor had already spread at the court that Shivaji would be killed along the way. However, the order was canceled when Shivaji refused to go. During the negotiations that followed, Shivaji demanded the transfer of his forts before becoming a mansabdar, a demand the emperor rejected. The orders to kill him were prevented only by Jai Singh&#x27;s intervention. In the end, Shivaji&#x27;s request to leave for Banaras as a sannyasi was also rejected.

Meanwhile, Shivaji hatched a plan to free himself. He sent most of his men back home and asked Ram Singh to withdraw his guarantees to the emperor for the safe custody of himself and his son. He surrendered to Mughal forces. Shivaji then pretended to be ill and began sending out large baskets packed with sweets to be given to the Brahmins and poor as penance. On 17 August 1666, by putting himself in one of the baskets and his son Sambhaji in another, Shivaji escaped and left Agra. Stewart Gordon opines that there is no contemporary evidence to support this story. He also states that, despite Aurangzeb&#x27;s suspicions regarding Ram Singh&#x27;s involvement in Shivaji&#x27;s escape, nothing was proven and Shivaji likely bribed the guards to facilitate his escape.

=== Peace with the Mughals ===

After Shivaji&#x27;s escape, hostilities with the Mughals ebbed, with the Mughal sardar Jaswant Singh acting as an intermediary between Shivaji and Aurangzeb for new peace proposals. Between 1666 and 1668, Aurangzeb also conferred the title of Raja on Shivaji, although he did not restore his right over forts. Sambhaji was also restored as a Mughal mansabdar with 5,000 horses. Shivaji at that time sent Sambhaji, with general Prataprao Gujar, to serve with the Mughal viceroy in Aurangabad, Prince Mu&#x27;azzam. Sambhaji was also granted territory in Berar for revenue collection. Aurangzeb also permitted Shivaji to attack Bijapur, ruled by the decaying Adil Shahi dynasty; the weakened Sultan Ali Adil Shah II sued for peace and granted the rights of &quot;sardeshmukhi&quot; and &quot;chauthai&quot; to Shivaji.

== Reconquest ==
The peace between Shivaji and the Mughals lasted until 1670, after which Aurangzeb became suspicious of the close ties between Shivaji and Mu&#x27;azzam, who he thought might usurp his throne, and may even have been receiving bribes from Shivaji. Also at that time, Aurangzeb, occupied in fighting the Afghans, greatly reduced his army in the Deccan; many of the disbanded soldiers quickly joined Maratha service. The Mughals also took away the jagir of Berar from Shambhaji to recover the money lent a few years earlier for his father&#x27;s trip to Agra. In response, Shivaji launched an offensive against the Mughals and in a span of four months recovered a major portion of the territories that had been surrendered to them.

Shivaji sacked Surat for a second time in 1670; the English and Dutch factories were able to repel his attack, but he managed to sack the city itself, including plundering the goods of a Muslim prince from Mawara-un-Nahr, who was returning from Mecca. Angered by the renewed attacks, the Mughals resumed hostilities with the Marathas, sending a force under Daud Khan to intercept Shivaji on his return home from Surat; this force was defeated in the Battle of Vani-Dindori near present-day Nashik.

In October 1670, Shivaji sent his forces to harass the English at Bombay; as they had refused to sell him war materiel, his forces blocked English woodcutting parties from leaving Bombay. In September 1671, Shivaji sent an ambassador to Bombay, again seeking materiel, this time for the fight against Danda-Rajpuri. The English had misgivings of the advantages Shivaji would gain from this conquest, but also did not want to lose any chance of receiving compensation for his looting their factories at Rajapur. The English sent Lieutenant Stephen Ustick to treat with Shivaji, but negotiations failed over the issue of the Rajapur indemnity. Numerous exchanges of envoys followed over the coming years, with some agreement as to the arms issues in 1674, but Shivaji was never to pay the Rajapur indemnity before his death, and the factory there dissolved at the end of 1682.

=== Battles of Umrani and Nesari ===
In 1674, Prataprao Gujar, the &quot;sarnaubat&quot; (commander-in-chief of the Maratha forces) and Anandrao, was sent to push back the invading force led by the Bijapuri general, Bahlol Khan. Prataprao&#x27;s forces defeated and captured the opposing general in the battle, after cutting-off their water supply by encircling a strategic lake, which prompted Bahlol Khan to sue for peace. In spite of Shivaji&#x27;s specific warnings against doing so, Prataprao released Bahlol Khan, who started preparing for a fresh invasion.

Shivaji sent a letter to Prataprao, expressing his displeasure and refusing him an audience until Bahlol Khan was re-captured. Upset by this rebuke, Prataprao found Bahlol Khan and charged his position with only six other horsemen, leaving his main force behind, and was killed in combat. Shivaji was deeply grieved on hearing of Prataprao&#x27;s death, and arranged for the marriage of his second son, Rajaram, to Prataprao&#x27;s daughter. Prataprao was succeeded by Hambirrao Mohite, as the new &quot;sarnaubat&quot;. Raigad Fort was newly built by Hiroji Indulkar, as a capital of the nascent Maratha kingdom.

== Coronation ==

Shivaji had acquired extensive lands and wealth through his campaigns, but lacking a formal title, he was still technically a Mughal zamindar or the son of a Bijapuri jagirdar, with no legal basis to rule his de facto domain. A kingly title could address this and also prevent any challenges by other Maratha leaders, who were his equals. Such a title would also provide the Hindu Marathis with a fellow Hindu sovereign in a region otherwise ruled by Muslims.

The preparation for a proposed coronation began in 1673. However, some controversies delayed the coronation by almost a year. One controversy erupted amongst the Brahmins of Shivaji&#x27;s court: they refused to crown Shivaji as a king because that status was reserved for those of the &quot;kshatriya varna&quot; (warrior class) in Hindu society. Shivaji was descended from a line of headmen of farming villages, and the Brahmins accordingly categorized him as a Maratha, not a Kshatriya. They noted that Shivaji had never had a sacred thread ceremony, and did not wear the thread, such as a kshatriya would. When Shivaji came to know about this conspiracy, he later bribed and summoned Gaga Bhatt, a pandit of Varanasi, who stated that he had found a genealogy proving that Shivaji was descended from the Sisodias, and thus indeed a kshatriya, albeit one in need of the ceremonies befitting his rank. To enforce this status, Shivaji was given a sacred thread ceremony, and remarried his spouses under the Vedic rites expected of a kshatriya. However, according to historical evidence, Shivaji&#x27;s claim to Rajput, and specifically of Sisodia ancestry, may be seen as being anything from tenuous, at best, to purely inventive.

On 28 May, Shivaji did penance for his and his ancestors&#x27; not observing Kshatriya rites for so long. Then he was invested by Gaga Bhatt with the sacred thread. On the insistence of other Brahmins, Gaga Bhatt omitted the Vedic chant and initiated Shivaji into a modified form of the life of the twice-born, instead of putting him on a par with the Brahmins. Next day, Shivaji made atonement for the sins, deliberate or accidental, committed in his own lifetime. He was weighed separately against seven metals including gold, silver, and several other articles, such fine linen, camphor, salt, sugar etc. All these articles, along with a lakh (one hundred thousand) of hun, were distributed among the Brahmins. According to Sarkar, even this failed to satisfy the greed of the Brahmins. Two of the learned Brahmins pointed out that Shivaji, while conducting his raids, had killed Brahmins, cows, women, and children. He could be cleansed of these sins for a price of Rs. 8,000, which Shivaji paid. The total expenditure for feeding the assemblage, general almsgiving, throne, and ornaments approached 1.5 million rupees.

On 6 June 1674, Shivaji was crowned king of the Maratha Empire (&quot;Hindavi Swaraj&quot;) in a lavish ceremony at Raigad fort. In the Hindu calendar it was the 13th day (&quot;trayodashi&quot;) of the first fortnight of the month of &quot;Jyeshtha&quot; in the year 1596. Gaga Bhatt officiated, pouring water from a gold vessel filled with the waters of the seven sacred rivers—Yamuna, Indus, Ganges, Godavari, Narmada, Krishna, and Kaveri—over Shivaji&#x27;s head, and chanted the Vedic coronation mantras. After the ablution, Shivaji bowed before his mother, Jijabai, and touched her feet. Nearly fifty thousand people gathered at Raigad for the ceremonies. Shivaji was entitled &quot;Shakakarta&quot; (&quot;founder of an era&quot;) and &quot;Chhatrapati&quot; (&quot;Lord of the Umbrella&quot;). He also took the title of &quot;Haindava Dharmodhhaarak&quot; (protector of the Hindu faith) and &quot;Kshatriya Kulavantas&quot;: &quot;Kshatriya&quot; being the varna of Hinduism and meaning the &#x27;head of the , or clan&#x27;.

Shivaji&#x27;s mother died on 18 June 1674. The Marathas summoned Nischal Puri Goswami, a tantric priest, who declared that the original coronation had been held under inauspicious stars, and a second coronation was needed. This second coronation, on 24 September 1674, mollified those who still believed that Shivaji was not qualified for the Vedic rites of his first coronation, by being a less controversial ceremony.

== Conquest in southern India ==
Beginning in 1674, the Marathas undertook an aggressive campaign, raiding Khandesh (October), capturing Bijapuri Ponda (April 1675), Karwar (mid-year), and Kolhapur (July). In November, the Maratha navy skirmished with the Siddis of Janjira, but failed to dislodge them. Having recovered from an illness, and taking advantage of a civil war that had broken out between the Deccanis and the Afghans at Bijapur, Shivaji raided Athani in April 1676.

In the run-up to his expedition, Shivaji appealed to a sense of Deccani patriotism, that Southern India was a homeland that should be protected from outsiders. His appeal was somewhat successful, and in 1677 Shivaji visited Hyderabad for a month and entered into a treaty with the Qutubshah of the Golkonda sultanate, who agreed to renounce his alliance with Bijapur and jointly oppose the Mughals.

In 1677, Shivaji invaded Karnataka with 30,000 cavalry and 40,000 infantry, backed by Golkonda artillery and funding. Proceeding south, Shivaji seized the forts of Vellore and Gingee; the latter would later serve as a capital of the Marathas during the reign of his son Rajaram I. This conquest gave him possession of vast territory in Mysore plateau and Madras Carnatic, containing 100 forts.

Shivaji intended to reconcile with his half-brother Venkoji (Ekoji I), Shahaji&#x27;s son by his second wife, Tukabai (née Mohite), who ruled Thanjavur (Tanjore) after Shahaji. The initially promising negotiations were unsuccessful, so whilst returning to Raigad, Shivaji defeated his half-brother&#x27;s army on 26 November 1677 and seized most of his possessions on the Mysore plateau. Venkoji&#x27;s wife Dipa Bai, whom Shivaji deeply respected, took up new negotiations with Shivaji and also convinced her husband to distance himself from his Muslim advisors. In the end, Shivaji consented to turn over to her and her female descendants many of the properties he had seized, with Venkoji consenting to a number of conditions for the proper administration of the territories and maintenance of Shahji&#x27;s tomb (&quot;samadhi&quot;).

== Death and succession ==
The question of Shivaji&#x27;s heir-apparent was complicated. In 1678, Shivaji confined his son Sambhaji to Panhala Fort for having an addiction to sensual pleasures or violating a Brahmin woman. Only to have the prince escape with his wife and defect to the Mughals where he fought against Shivaji in the Battle of Bhupalgarh. Upon returning home, unrepentant, he was again confined to Panhala Fort.

Shivaji died around 3–5 April 1680 at the age of 50, at Raigad Fort, on the eve of Hanuman Jayanti. The cause of Shivaji&#x27;s death is disputed. British records states that Shivaji died of bloody flux, after being sick for 12 days. In a contemporary work in Portuguese, in the Biblioteca Nacional de Lisboa, the recorded cause of death of Shivaji is anthrax. However, Krishnaji Anant Sabhasad, author of &quot;Sabhasad Bakhar&quot;, a biography of Shivaji has mentioned fever as the cause of death. Putalabai, the childless eldest of the surviving wives of Shivaji committed &quot;sati&quot; by jumping into his funeral pyre. Another surviving spouse, Sakwarbai, was not allowed to follow suit because she had a young daughter. There were also allegations, though doubted by later scholars, that his second wife Soyarabai had poisoned him in order to put her 10-year-old son Rajaram on the throne.

After Shivaji&#x27;s death, Soyarabai made plans, with various ministers, to crown her son Rajaram rather than her stepson Sambhaji. On 21 April 1680, ten-year-old Rajaram was installed on the throne. However, Sambhaji took possession of Raigad Fort after killing the commander, and on 18 June acquired control of Raigad, and formally ascended the throne on 20 July. Rajaram, his mother Soyarabai and wife Janki Bai were imprisoned, and Soyrabai was executed on charges of conspiracy that October.

== Governance ==

=== Ashta Pradhan Mandal ===
The Council of Eight Ministers, or &quot;Ashta Pradhan Mandal&quot;, was an administrative and advisory council set up by Shivaji. It consisted of eight ministers who regularly advised Shivaji on political and administrative matters. The eight ministers were as follows:

Except the Panditrao and Nyayadhis, all other ministers held military commands, their civil duties often being performed by deputies.

=== Promotion of Marathi and Sanskrit ===
At his court, Shivaji replaced Persian, the common courtly language in the region, with Marathi, and emphasised Hindu political and courtly traditions. Shivaji&#x27;s reign stimulated the deployment of Marathi as a systematic tool of description and understanding. Shivaji&#x27;s royal seal was in Sanskrit. Shivaji commissioned one of his officials to make a comprehensive lexicon to replace Persian and Arabic terms with their Sanskrit equivalents. This led to the production of the &quot;Rājavyavahārakośa&quot;, the thesaurus of state usage in 1677.

=== Religious policy ===
Many modern commentators have deemed Shivaji&#x27;s religious policies as tolerant. While encouraging Hinduism, Shivaji not only allowed Muslims to practice without harassment, but supported their ministries with endowments.

Noting that Shivaji had stemmed the spread of the neighbouring Muslim states, his contemporary, the poet Kavi Bhushan stated:

However, Gijs Kruijtzer, in his book &quot;Xenophobia in Seventeenth-Century India&quot;, argues that the foundation for modern Hindu-Muslim communalism was laid in the decade 1677–1687, in the interplay between Shivaji and Aurangzeb (though Shivaji died in 1680). During the sack of Surat in 1664, Shivaji was approached by Ambrose, a Capuchin friar who asked him to spare the city&#x27;s Christians. Shivaji left the Christians untouched, saying &quot;the Frankish Padrys are good men.&quot;

Shivaji was not attempting to create a universal Hindu rule. He was tolerant of different religions and believed in syncretism. He urged Aurangzeb to act like Akbar in according respect to Hindu beliefs and places. Shivaji had little trouble forming alliances with the surrounding Muslim nations, even against Hindu powers. He also did not join forces with certain other Hindu powers fighting the Mughals, such as the Rajputs. His own army had Muslim leaders from early on. The first Pathan unit was formed in 1656. His admiral, Darya Sarang, was a Muslim.

====Ramdas====
Shivaji was a contemporary of Samarth Ramdas. Historian Stewart Gordon concludes about their relationship:

=== Seal ===
Seals were a means to confer authenticity on official documents. Shahaji and Jijabai had Persian seals. But Shivaji, right from the beginning, used Sanskrit for his seal. The seal proclaims: &quot;This seal of Shiva, son of Shah, shines forth for the welfare of the people and is meant to command increasing respect from the universe like the first phase of the moon.&quot;

== Mode of warfare ==
Shivaji maintained a small but effective standing army. The core of Shivaji&#x27;s army consisted of peasants of Maratha and Kunbi castes. Shivaji was aware of the limitations of his army. He realised that conventional warfare methods were inadequate to confront the big, well-trained cavalry of the Mughals, which was equipped with field artillery. As a result, Shivaji mastered guerilla tactics which became known as &quot;Ganimi Kawa&quot; in the Marathi language. His strategies consistently perplexed and defeated armies sent against him. He realized that the most vulnerable point of the large, slow-moving armies of the time was supply. He utilised knowledge of the local terrain and the superior mobility of his light cavalry to cut off supplies to the enemy. Shivaji refused to confront the enemy in pitched battles. Instead, he lured the enemies into difficult hills and jungles of his own choosing, catching them at a disadvantage and routing them. Shivaji did not adhere to a particular tactic but used several methods to undermine his enemies, as required by circumstances, such as sudden raids, sweeps and ambushes, and psychological warfare.

Shivaji was contemptuously called a &quot;Mountain Rat&quot; by Aurangzeb and his generals, because of his guerilla tactics of attacking enemy forces and then retreating into his mountain forts.

=== Military ===
Shivaji demonstrated great skill in creating his military organisation, which lasted until the demise of the Maratha Empire. His strategy rested on leveraging his ground forces, naval forces, and series of forts across his territory. The Maval infantry served as the core of his ground forces (reinforced by Telangi musketeers from Karnataka) and supported by Maratha cavalry. His artillery was relatively underdeveloped and reliant on European suppliers, further inclining him to a very mobile form of warfare.

=== Hill forts ===

Hill forts played a key role in Shivaji&#x27;s strategy. Ramchandra Amatya, one of Shivaji&#x27;s ministers, describes the achievement of Shivaji by saying that his empire was created from forts. Shivaji captured important Adilshahi forts at Murambdev (Rajgad), Torna, Kondhana (Sinhagad), and Purandar. He also rebuilt or repaired many forts in advantageous locations. In addition, Shivaji built a number of forts, numbering 111 according to some accounts, but it is likely the actual number &quot;did not exceed 18.&quot; The historian Jadunath Sarkar assessed that Shivaji owned some 240–280 forts at the time of his death. Each was placed under three officers of equal status, lest a single traitor be bribed or tempted to deliver it to the enemy. The officers acted jointly and provided mutual checks and balances.

=== Navy ===

Aware of the need for naval power to maintain control along the Konkan coast, Shivaji began to build his navy in 1657 or 1659, with the purchase of twenty galivats from the Portuguese shipyards of Bassein. Marathi chronicles state that at its height his fleet counted some 400 warships, although contemporary English chronicles counter that the number never exceeded 160.

With the Marathas being accustomed to a land-based military, Shivaji widened his search for qualified crews for his ships, taking on lower-caste Hindus of the coast who were long familiar with naval operations (the famed &quot;Malabar pirates&quot;), as well as Muslim mercenaries. Noting the power of the Portuguese navy, Shivaji hired a number of Portuguese sailors and Goan Christian converts, and made Rui Leitao Viegas commander of his fleet. Viegas was later to defect back to the Portuguese, taking 300 sailors with him.

Shivaji fortified his coastline by seizing coastal forts and refurbishing them. He built his first marine fort at Sindhudurg, which was to become the headquarters of the Maratha navy. The navy itself was a coastal navy, focused on travel and combat in the littoral areas, and not intended for the high seas.

== Legacy ==
Shivaji was well known for his secularism, warrior code of ethics, and exemplary character.

=== Contemporaneous view ===
Shivaji was admired for his heroic exploits and clever stratagems in the contemporary accounts of English, French, Dutch, Portuguese, and Italian writers. Contemporary English writers compared him with Alexander, Hannibal, and Julius Caesar. The French traveller Francois Bernier wrote in his &quot;Travels in Mughal India&quot;:

I forgot to mention that during pillage of Sourate, Seva-Gy, the Holy Seva-Gi! respected the habitation of the Reverend Father Ambrose, the Capuchin missionary. &#x27;The Frankish Padres are good men&#x27;, he said &#x27;and shall not be attacked.&#x27; He spared also the house of a deceased Delale or Gentile broker, of the Dutch, because assured that he had been very charitable while alive.

Mughal depictions of Shivaji were largely negative, referring to him simply as &quot;Shiva&quot; without the honorific &quot;-ji&quot;. One Mughal writer in the early 1700s described Shivaji&#x27;s death as (). His chivalrous treatment of enemies and women has been praised by Mughal authors, including Khafi Khan. Jadunath Sarkar writes:

His chivalry to women and strict enforcement of morality in his camp was a wonder in that age and has extorted the admiration of hostile critics like Khafi Khan.

=== Early depictions ===
The earliest depictions of Shivaji by authors not affiliated with Maratha court in Maharashtra are to be found in the bakhars that depict Shivaji as an almost divine figure, an ideal Hindu king who overthrew Muslim dominion. The current academic consensus is that while these Bakhars are important for understanding how Shivaji was viewed in his time, they must be correlated with other sources to decide historical truth. &quot;Sabhasad Bakhar&quot; and &quot;91 Kalami Bakhar&quot; are considered the most reliable of all bakhars by scholars.

=== Nineteenth century ===

In the mid–19th century, Marathi social reformer Jyotirao Phule wrote his interpretation of the Shivaji legend, portraying him as a hero of the shudras and dalits. Phule&#x27;s 1869 ballad-form story of Shivaji was met with great hostility by the Brahmin-dominated media.

In 1895, the Indian nationalist leader Lokmanya Tilak organised what was to be an annual festival to mark the birthday of Shivaji. He portrayed Shivaji as the &quot;opponent of the oppressor&quot;, with possible negative implications concerning the colonial government. Tilak denied any suggestion that his festival was anti-Muslim or disloyal to the government, but simply a celebration of a hero. These celebrations prompted a British commentator in 1906 to note: &quot;Cannot the annals of the Hindu race point to a single hero whom even the tongue of slander will not dare call a chief of dacoits...?&quot;

One of the first commentators to reappraise the critical British view of Shivaji was M. G. Ranade, whose &quot;Rise of the Maratha Power&quot; (1900) declared Shivaji&#x27;s achievements as the beginning of modern nation-building. Ranade criticised earlier British portrayals of Shivaji&#x27;s state as &quot;a freebooting power, which thrived by plunder and adventure, and succeeded only because it was the most cunning and adventurous ... This is a very common feeling with the readers, who derive their knowledge of these events solely from the works of English historians.&quot;

In 1919, Sarkar published the seminal Shivaji and His Times. Sarkar was able to read primary sources in Persian, Marathi, and Arabic, but was challenged for his criticism of the &quot;chauvinism&quot; of Marathi historians&#x27; views of Shivaji. Likewise, although supporters cheered his depiction of the killing of Afzal Khan as justified, they decried Sarkar&#x27;s terming as &quot;murder&quot; the killing of the Hindu raja Chandrao More and his clan.

In 1937, Dennis Kincaid, a British civil servant in India, published &quot;The Grand Rebel&quot;. This book portrays Shivaji as a heroic rebel and a master strategist fighting a much larger Mughal army.

=== Post independence ===
In modern times, Shivaji is considered as a national hero in India, especially in the state of Maharashtra, where he remains an important figure in the state&#x27;s history. Stories of his life form an integral part of the upbringing and identity of the Marathi people.

Hindutva activists are noted for appropriating Shivaji by presenting him as &quot;Hindu king&quot; who &quot;fought against Muslim rulers&quot;, contrary to historic accounts that show he belonged to a marginalised caste and held secular values.

==== Political parties ====
In 1966, the Shiv Sena () political party was formed to promote the interests of Marathi-speaking people in the face of migration to Maharashtra from other parts of India, and the accompanying loss of power of locals. His image adorns literature, propaganda, and icons of the party.

Shivaji is seen as a hero by regional political parties and also by the Maratha-caste-dominated Indian National Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party.

=== Controversies related to Shivaji&#x27;s depiction ===
In the late 20th century, Babasaheb Purandare became one of the most significant authors in portraying Shivaji in his writings, leading him to be declared in 1964 as the &quot;Shiv-Shahir&quot; (). However, Purandare, a Brahmin, was also accused of overstating the influence of Brahmin gurus on Shivaji, and his Maharashtra Bhushan award ceremony in 2015 was protested by those claiming he had defamed Shivaji.

In 1993, the &quot;Illustrated Weekly&quot; published an article suggesting that Shivaji was not opposed to Muslims &quot;per se&quot;, and that his style of governance was influenced by that of the Mughal Empire. Congress Party members called for legal actions against the publisher and writer, Marathi newspapers accused them of &quot;imperial prejudice&quot;, and Shiv Sena called for the writer&#x27;s public flogging. Maharashtra brought legal action against the publisher under regulations prohibiting enmity between religious and cultural groups, but a High Court found that the &quot;Illustrated Weekly&quot; had operated within the bounds of freedom of expression.

In 2003, the American academic James W. Laine published his book &quot;Shivaji: Hindu King in Islamic India&quot; to, what Ananya Vajpeyi terms, a regime of &quot;cultural policing by militant Marathas&quot;. As a result of this publication, the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, in Pune, where Laine had done research, was attacked by the Sambhaji Brigade. Laine was even threatened with arrest, and the book was banned in Maharashtra in January 2004. The ban was lifted by the Bombay High Court in 2007, and in July 2010 the Supreme Court of India upheld the lifting of the ban. This lifting was followed by public demonstrations against the author and the decision of the Supreme Court.

== Commemorations ==
Statues of Shivaji are found in every taluka in Maharashtra as well as in many places across India, including Mumbai, Pune, New Delhi, Surat, and Yellur. There are also statues outside of India including in San Jose, California, and Mauritius.

Several Mumbai landmarks were renamed for Shivaji in the 1990s, around the same time that Bombay was renamed Mumbai. The Prince of Wales Museum, which is devoted to Indian history, was renamed Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya. Victoria Terminus, Mumbai&#x27;s main railway station and the headquarters of the Central Railway zone, was initially renamed Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus and later renamed Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus. Similarly, Mumbai&#x27;s busiest airport, Sahar International Airport, was first renamed Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport and further renamed to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport.

Other commemorations include the Indian Navy&#x27;s INS Shivaji station and numerous postage stamps. In 2022, the Indian prime minister unveiled the new ensign of the Indian Navy, which was inspired by the seal of Shivaji. In Maharashtra, there has been a long tradition of children building replica forts with toy soldiers and other figures during the festival of Diwali, in memory of Shivaji.

A proposal to build a giant memorial called Shiv Smarak was approved in 2016; the memorial is to be located near Mumbai on a small island in the Arabian Sea. It will be tall, which will make it the world&#x27;s tallest statue when completed. As of August 2021, the project has been stalled since January 2019, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Only the bathymetry survey has been completed, while the geotechnical survey was underway. Consequently, the state public works department proposed extending the completion date by a year, from 18 October 2021 to 18 October 2022.

== Name ==
Prior to belonging to the Roman Empire, which gave it the Latin name Siscia, the region was Celtic and Illyrian and the city there was named Segestica or Segesta. Writers in Greek referred to the city as , , and .

In German the town is known as , , and in Kajkavian and Slovene as &quot;&quot;.

== History ==

=== Roman empire ===

Siscia is described by Roman writers as a great town in the south of Upper Pannonia, on the southern bank of the Savus, on an island formed by that river and two others, the Colapis and Odra, a canal dug by Tiberius completing the island. It was on the great road from Aemona to Sirmium. According to Pliny the name Segestica belonged only to the island, and the town was called Siscia; while Strabo says that Siscia was a fort in the neighbourhood of Segestica; but if this was so, it must be supposed that subsequently the fort and town became united as one place. Siscia was from the first a strongly fortified town; and after its capture by Tiberius, in the reign of Augustus, it became one of the most important places of Pannonia; for being on two navigable rivers, it not only carried on considerable commerce, but became the central point from which Augustus and Tiberius carried on their undertakings against the Pannonians and Illyrians. Tiberius did much to enlarge and embellish the town, which as early as that time seems to have been made a , for Pliny mentions it as such: in the time of Septimius Severus it received fresh colonists, whence in inscriptions it is called &quot;Col. Septimia Siscia&quot;. The town contained an imperial mint, which produced coins under a series of emperors between 262 and 383 AD.

The Christian martyr Quirinus of Sescia, presumed the first bishop of the Diocese of Sescia, was tortured and nearly killed during Diocletian&#x27;s persecution of Christians. Legend has it that they tied him to a millstone and threw him into a river, but he freed himself from the weight, escaped and continued to preach his faith. Today he is the patron saint of Sisak. When Diocletian split Pannonia into four provinces, Siscia became the capital of Pannonia Savia, the southwestern one, for which Siscia contained the treasury; at the same time it was the station of the small fleet kept on the Savus. Siscia maintained its importance until Sirmium began to rise, for in proportion as Sirmium rose, Siscia sank and declined.

===Middle Ages===
Braslav of Lower Pannonia reigned from Sisak until he was killed in the Hungarian invasion ca. 898. According to &quot;Historia Salonitana&quot;, Duke Tomislav reclaimed it soon after.

===Early modern===

The 16th-century triangular fortress of the Old Town, well-preserved and turned into the Native Museum, is the main destination of every tourist. The fortress is famous for the victory of the joint forces of Croats, Austrians and Carniolans (Slovenes) over the Ottomans in 1593, known as the Battle of Sisak. It was one of the early significant defeats of the up-to-then invincible Ottoman army on European territory. The Croatian Ban Thomas Erdődy who led the defense in this battle became famous throughout Europe. However this victory didn&#x27;t prevent Sisak from Ottoman conquest on 24 August 1593. During their brief rule, it was called &quot;Siska&quot;. Its fortress was manned, a sanjak beg was appointed and a mosque was built in the fortress. On 11 August 1594, Ottoman forces fled and set the fortress on fire after a powerful Habsburg-Croat army approached.

The Baroque palace of &quot;Mali Kaptol&quot;, the classicist &quot;Veliki Kaptol&quot;, the brick &quot;Stari most&quot; (&quot;Old Bridge&quot;) over the Kupa, and the ethnological park are the most frequently visited landmarks.

=== Modern ===
In the late 19th and early 20th century, Sisak was a district capital in the Zagreb County of the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia.

=== Modern history ===

From 1929 to 1939, Sisak was part of the Sava Banovina, and from 1939 to 1941, of the Banovina of Croatia within the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. During World War II, the Sisak children&#x27;s concentration camp was set up by the Croatian Axis Ustaše government for Serbian, Jewish and Romani children. It is estimated that 1,160–1,600 children lost their lives at the camp.
On 22 June 1941, the day Germany invaded the Soviet Union, the Sisak People&#x27;s Liberation Partisan Detachment, also known as the 1st Sisak Partisan Detachment, was formed by the outlawed Croatian Communist Party in the Brezovica Forest, near Sisak. It was the first Partisan armed anti-fascist resistance unit formed in occupied Yugoslavia following the invasion of Yugoslavia by the Axis powers in April 1941.
It had 79 members, mainly Croats with the exception of one notable Serb woman, Nada Dimić, and was commanded by a Croat, Vladimir Janjić-Capo.

With the outbreak of the Croatian War of Independence in 1991, Sisak remained in Government hands while the territory to the south was controlled by rebelling Serbs. During the war, the Serb forces often shelled the city, causing dozens of civilian casualties and extensive damage to the city&#x27;s industry. According to Amnesty International, Serb civilians in Sisak and surrounding areas were subjected to abductions, killings, assault and threats with at least 33 killed between 1991 and 1992, while local human rights activists in Croatia claim that over 100 Serb residents of the Sisak region were killed during the entirety of the war. The frontline dramatically moved eastwards as a result of Operation Storm (1995), effectively ending the war.

Sisak suffered much damage during the 2020 Petrinja earthquake. The town, located roughly northeast of the epicenter, reported damage to the hospital as well as city hall and various churches. Most of the damage was inflicted on old buildings in the center of the town. However, early figures estimate that 700 to 1,000 homes were damaged in Sisak and nearby villages.

<text>Kopački Rit is a nature park in eastern Croatia in the municipalities of Bilje and Kneževi Vinogradi. It is located northwest of the confluence of the Drava and the Danube, situated at the border with Serbia. It comprises many backwaters and ponds along the Danube. It is one of the most important, largest and most attractive preserved intact wetlands in Europe.

==Fauna &amp; Flora==
 A part of Kopački Rit has been designated as a zoological reserve. Around 260 various bird species breed here including geese and ducks, great white egret, white stork, black stork, white-tailed eagle, crows, Eurasian coot, gulls, terns, common kingfisher and European green woodpecker.Many other species use this area as a temporary shelter on migration from the northern, cooler regions to the southern, warmer areas and vice versa.

There are around 40 fish species including pike, ide, tench, bream, carp, catfish, pike-perch and perch. Mammals in the area include red deer, roe deer, wild boar, European wildcat, pine marten, stone marten, least weasel, sable and the Eurasian otter. Daily passes can be purchased at the visitors center.

Kopački Rit also has over 140 recorded species of plant—some of which are very rare and only found in a few places in Croatia. Notable species include white water lily (&quot;Nymphaea alba&quot;), the iris (&quot;Iris variegata&quot;); azola, black sedge (&quot;Carex nigra&quot;), common reed (&quot;Phragmites australis&quot;); siberian cattail; graceful cattail (&quot;Typha laxmannii&quot;); and flowering rush (&quot;Butomus umbellatus&quot;).

==Access==
 The proximity of the big town of Osijek and its surroundings, as well as excellent communications (by road, railway, plane and ship) provide ready access to visitors. The beauty of &quot;intact&quot; nature, the multitude of waters, flora and fauna attract not only excursionists and visitors but also many experts and scientists from the whole of Europe.
Guided tourist visits by panoramic ships, boats, horse-drawn wagons or on foot are available. Some packages offer the possibility of photographing or video-recording animals, birds in particular.

Angling and hunting are allowed in certain parts of Kopački Rit that are put under less strict protection such as Vemeljski Dunavac, Danube river, Podunavlje channels, and the area by the Zlatna Greda pump station.

The international bicycle routes &quot;Pannonian Peace Route&quot; and &quot;Danube Route&quot; lead through Kopački Rit, which has become the first centre for cycle-tourists in Croatia. Bikes are also available for rent through the visitors center.

<doc id="149343" wikidata="Q835406" url="?curid=149343" title="Fuggerei">
<text>The Fuggerei is the world&#x27;s oldest public housing complex still in use. It is a walled enclave within the city of Augsburg, Bavaria. It takes its name from the Fugger family and was founded in 1516 by Jakob Fugger the Younger (known as &quot;Jakob Fugger the Rich&quot;) as a place where the needy citizens of Augsburg could be housed. By 1523, 52 houses had been built, and in the coming years the area expanded with various streets, small squares and a church. The gates were locked at night, so the Fuggerei was, in its own right, very similar to a small independent medieval town. It is still inhabited today, affording it the status of being the oldest public housing project in the world.

==Description==

The rent was and still is one Rhenish &quot;gulden&quot; per year (equivalent to 0.88 euros), as well as to make three daily prayers for the current owners of the  – the Lord&#x27;s Prayer, Hail Mary, and the Nicene Creed – and to work a part-time job in the community. The conditions to live there remain the same as they were 500 years ago: one must have lived at least two years in Augsburg, be of the Catholic faith and have become indigent without debt. The five gates are still locked every day at 10 PM.

Housing units in the area consist of 45 to 65 square metre (500–700 square foot) apartments, but because each unit has its own street entrance it simulates living in a house. There is no shared accommodation; each family has its own apartment, which includes a kitchen, a parlour, a bedroom and a tiny spare room, altogether totalling about 60 square metres (600 sq. ft.). Ground-floor apartments all have a small garden and garden shed, while upper-floor apartments have an attic. All apartments have modern conveniences such as television and running water. One ground-floor apartment is uninhabited, serving as a museum open to the public. The doorbells have elaborate shapes, each being unique, dating back to before the installation of streetlights when residents could identify their door by feeling the handle in the dark.

==History==
The Fugger family initially established their wealth in weaving and merchandising. Jakob the Rich expanded their interests into silver mining and trading with Venice. Additionally he was a financier and counted the Vatican as a notable client. The family became financial backers of the Habsburg family, and he financed the successful election of Charles V as Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire in 1519.

The Fuggerei was first built between 1514 and 1523 under the supervision of the architect Thomas Krebs, and in 1582, Hans Holl added St. Mark&#x27;s Church to the settlement. Expanded further in 1880 and 1938, the Fuggerei today comprises 67 houses with 147 apartments, a well and an administrative building.

Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart&#x27;s great-grandfather, the mason Franz Mozart, lived in the Fuggerei between 1681 and 1694 and is commemorated today by a stone plaque.

The Fuggerei was heavily damaged by the bombings of Augsburg during World War II but has been rebuilt in its original style.

==Upkeep==
The Fuggerei is supported by a charitable trust established in 1520 which Jakob Fugger funded with an initial deposit of 10,000 guilders. According to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, the trust has been carefully managed with most of its income coming from forestry holdings, which the Fugger family favoured since the 17th century after losing money on higher yielding investments. The annual return on the trust has ranged from an after-inflation rate of 0.5% to 2%. The Fugger family foundation is currently headed by Maria-Elisabeth Gräfin Thun-Fugger, &quot;née&quot; Gräfin Fugger von Kirchberg, who lives at Kirchberg Castle. Other members of the foundations&#x27;s board are Alexander Graf Fugger-Babenhausen and Maria-Theresia Gräfin Fugger-Glött. All three still existing branches of the Fugger family are thus represented. The trust is administered by Wolf-Dietrich Graf von Hundt.

As of 2020, the fee for a tour into the Fuggerei is 6.50 euro, over seven times the annual rent.

<doc id="149344" wikidata="Q171009" url="?curid=149344" title="Drava">
<text>The Drava or Drave (, ; ; ; ; ), historically known as the Dravis or Dravus, is a river in southern Central Europe. With a length of , or , if the length of its Sextner Bach source is added, it is the fifth or sixth longest tributary of the Danube, after the Tisza, Sava, Prut, Mureș and likely Siret. The Drava drains an area of about 40,154 square kilometers. Its mean annual discharge is seasonally to . Its source is near the market town of Innichen, in the Puster Valley of South Tyrol, Italy. The river flows eastwards through East Tyrol and Carinthia in Austria into the Styria region of Slovenia. It then turns southeast, passing through northern Croatia and, after merging with its main tributary the Mur, forms most of the border between Croatia and Hungary, before it joins the Danube near Osijek, in Croatia.

==Name==
In ancient times the river was known as &quot;Dravus&quot; or &quot;Draus&quot; in Latin, and in Greek as Δράος and Δράβος. Medieval attestations of the name include &quot;Dravis&quot; ( AD 670), &quot;Drauva&quot; (in 799), &quot;Drauus&quot; (in 811), &quot;Trauum&quot; (in 1091), and &quot;Trah&quot; (in 1136). The name is pre-Roman and pre-Celtic, but probably of Indo-European origin, from the root &quot;*dreu̯-&quot; &#x27;flow&#x27;. The river gives its name to the dravite species of tourmaline.

=== Carpis ===
The Carpis (Greek: Κάρπίς) was a river which, according to Herodotus, flowed from the upper country of the Ombricans northward into the Ister (Danube), whence it has been supposed that this river is the same as the Dravus.

==Geography==
The Drava (along with one of its tributaries, the Slizza) and the Spöl are the only two rivers originating in Italy that belong to the Danube drainage basin. Its main left tributaries (from the north) are the Isel (contributes 39 m3/s), the Möll (25 m3/s), the (22 m3/s), the Gurk (30 m3/s) and the Lavant (12 m3/s) in Austria, and the Mur (166 m3/s) near Legrad at the Croatian–Hungarian border. Its main right tributaries (from the south) are the Gail (45 m3/s) in Austria, the Meža (12 m3/s) and Dravinja (11 m3/s) in Slovenia, and the Bednja (? m3/s) in Croatia.
Mean discharge is for the last station in the country mentioned in the source.

==Course==

The sources of the Drava are located at the drainage divide between the market town of Innichen/San Candido and neighbouring Toblach/Dobbiaco in the west, where the Rienz River rises, a tributary of the Adige/Etsch. At Innichen itself the 16+ km , originating near the Sextener Rotwand, joins the ~2 km long source creek. The river than flows eastwards and after 8 kilometres crosses into East Tyrol in Austria. At Lienz it flows into the Isel, sourced from the glaciers of the Venediger and Glockner Groups. The Isel (average discharge 39 m³/s) is almost three times larger than the Drava (14 m³/s) where they meet and, starting from the source of its tributary under the Rötspitze, the Isel (ca. 64 km) is also longer than the combined Drava and Sextner Bach (ca. 60 km) to that point.

The river then flows east into Carinthia at Oberdrauburg. The river separates the Kreuzeck range of the High Tauern in the north and the Gailtal Alps in the south, passes the Sachsenburg narrows and the site of the ancient city of Teurnia, before it reaches the town of Spittal an der Drau. Downstream of Villach, it runs along the northern slopes of the Karawanks to Ferlach and Lavamünd.

The Drava passes into Slovenia at Gorče near Dravograd, from where it runs for via Vuzenica, Muta, Ruše, and Maribor to Ptuj and the border with Croatia at Ormož. The river then passes Varaždin, Belišće and Osijek in Croatia, and Barcs in Hungary. It is navigable for about from Čađavica in Croatia to its mouth.

The hydrological parameters of Drava are regularly monitored in Croatia at Botovo, Terezino Polje, Donji Miholjac and Osijek.

==Discharge==

The Drava&#x27;s mean annual discharge (Q) at Drávaszabolcs (Hungary, 77.7 rkm). Period from 1995 to 2023.
== Hydroelectric power plants ==
Currently, there are 22 hydroelectric power plants on the Drava. The power plants are listed beginning at the headwaters:

The Drava is one of the most exploited rivers in the world in terms of hydropower, with almost 100% of its water potential energy being exploited. As the region of the river is a place of exceptional biodiversity, this raises several ecological concerns, together with other forms of exploitation such as use of river deposits.

<text>Lüneburg is a district in Lower Saxony, Germany. It is bounded by (from the southeast and clockwise) the districts of Lüchow-Dannenberg, Uelzen, Heidekreis and Harburg, and the states of Schleswig-Holstein (district of Lauenburg) and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania (district of Ludwigslust-Parchim).

== History ==

The &quot;Amt&quot; of Lüneburg appeared in 1862. At that time the &quot;Amt&quot; of Lüne moved its seat from Lüne Abbey into the Lüneburg Riding Academy and its name was changed. The district was established after the Kingdom of Hanover was annexed by Prussia in 1866. From 1867 the &quot;Ämter&quot; of Lüneburg, Bleckede and the town of Lüneburg became parts of the district of Lüneburg, which was exclusively responsible for taxes and the military.

The history of the region has always been influenced by the town of Lüneburg: see there for more details.

In 1993 the municipality of Amt Neuhaus joined Lower Saxony and the District of Lüneburg. This region had always been ruled by Lüneburg before the division of Germany made it a part of East Germany after 1945. It is hence one of the very few municipalities of the former East Germany that are now in a state that was formerly in West Germany.

The district is one of the core areas for monuments and archaeological discoveries from prehistory. Ernst Sprockhoff noted 17 sites west of the Ilmenau and 32 east of it. The most outstanding are the sites of the Soderstorf Necropolis and the Oldendorfer Totenstatt.

== Geography ==

The district is characterised by the Lüneburg Heath (&quot;Lüneburger Heide&quot;) in the south and the riverside woodlands along the Elbe. Though most of the district is located south of the river, there is a small portion around the municipality of Amt Neuhaus on the opposite side.

== Coat of arms ==

The coat of arms displays:
* the heraldic lion of the Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg
* the hearts of the Danish national arms (since Duke Wilhelm of Lüneburg was married to a Danish princess in the 14th century)

<doc id="149349" wikidata="Q1295" url="?curid=149349" title="Dortmund">
<text>Dortmund (; ; ) is the third-largest city in North Rhine-Westphalia, after Cologne and Düsseldorf, and the ninth-largest city in Germany. With a population of 612,065 inhabitants, it is the largest city (by area and population) of the Ruhr as well as the largest city of Westphalia. It lies on the Emscher and Ruhr rivers (tributaries of the Rhine) in the Rhine-Ruhr Metropolitan Region, the second biggest metropolitan region by GDP in the European Union, and is considered the administrative, commercial, and cultural centre of the eastern Ruhr. Dortmund is the second-largest city in the Low German dialect area, after Hamburg.

Founded around 882, Dortmund became an Imperial Free City. Throughout the 13th to 14th centuries, it was the &quot;chief city&quot; of the Rhine, Westphalia, and the Netherlands Circle of the Hanseatic League. During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the city was destroyed and decreased in significance until the onset of industrialization. The city then became one of Germany&#x27;s most important coal, steel, and beer centres; as a consequence, it was one of the most heavily bombed cities in Germany during World War II. The devastating bombing raids of 12 March 1945 destroyed 98% of buildings in the inner city centre. The raids, with more than 1,110 aircraft, were the largest for a single target in World War II. Today around 30 % of the city consists of buildings from before World War II.

Since the collapse of its century-long steel and coal industries, the region has adapted and shifted to high-technology biomedical technology, micro systems technology, and also services. Other key sectors include retail, leisure and the visitor economy, creative industries, and logistics. Dortmund was classified as a &quot;Node city&quot; in the Innovation Cities Index, ranked among the twelve innovation cities in European Union, and is the most sustainable and digital city in Germany. With its central station and airport, the third-busiest in North Rhine-Westphalia, Dortmund is an important transport junction for the surrounding Ruhr area as well as the Benelux countries, and with the largest canal port in Europe it has a connection to important seaports on the North Sea.

Dortmund is home to many cultural and educational institutions. It is the location of the Technical University of Dortmund, Dortmund University of Applied Sciences and Arts, the International School of Management, and other educational, cultural and administrative facilities, with over 49,000 students. It has many museums, such as Museum Ostwall, Museum of Art and Cultural History, and German Football Museum, as well as theatres and music venues like the Konzerthaus or the Opera House of Dortmund. Nearly half the municipal territory consists of waterways, woodland, agriculture, and green spaces with spacious parks such as Westfalenpark and Rombergpark. This stands in a stark contrast with nearly a hundred years of extensive coal mining and steel milling in the past, which created a rich Gründerzeit architectural heritage. Borussia Dortmund is one of the most successful German football clubs.

==History==
===Etymology===

Dortmund was first mentioned in the Werden Abbey, which was built between 880 and 884. The Latin entry reads: &quot;In Throtmanni liber homo Arnold viii den nob solvit&quot; (German: &quot;In Throtmanni zahlt uns der freie Mann Arnold 8 Pfennige&quot;, and English: &quot;In Throtmanni the free man Arnold pays us 8 pfennigs&quot;).
According to this, there are a large number of different names, but they all go back to the same phoneme stem. Their respective use in the sources appears arbitrary and random.

In the course of time the name changed many times: &quot;trut munia&quot; 899, &quot;Thortmanni, Trutmania, Trotmunni&quot; 939, &quot;Tremonia&quot; 1152. From the 13th century on, the &quot;Dortmunde&quot; appeared for the first time, but it was not until a few centuries later that it became generally accepted.

In the Middle Ages 1389, when the city had withstood the siege of 1,200 knights under the leadership of the Archbishop of Cologne, it chose as its motto a saying that is still upheld today by traditional societies: &quot;So fast as Düörpm&quot; (High German: &quot;as firm as Dortmund&quot;).

In the past, the city was called &quot;&quot;Dortmond&quot; in Dutch, &quot;Tremonia&quot; in Spanish, and &quot;Trémoigne&quot;&quot; in Old French. However, these exonyms have fallen into disuse and the city is now internationally known by its German name of &quot;Dortmund&quot;. The common abbreviation for the name of the city is &quot;DTM&quot;, the IATA code for Dortmund Airport.

===Early history===

The Sigiburg was a hillfort in the south of present-day Dortmund, overlooking the River Ruhr near its confluence with the River Lenne. The ruins of the later Hohensyburg castle now stand on the site of the Sigiburg. The hillfort is presumably of Saxon origin, but there is no archeological or documentary proof of this. During the Saxon Wars, it was taken by the Franks under Charlemagne in 772, retaken by the Saxons (possibly under Widukind) in 774, and taken again and refortified by Charlemagne in 775. Archaeological evidence suggests the Sigiburg site was also occupied in the Neolithic era.

The first time Dortmund was mentioned in official documents was around 882 as Throtmanni – In throtmanni liber homo arnold[us] viii den[arios] nob[is] soluit [solvit]. In 1005 the &quot;Ecclesiastical council&quot; and in 1016 the&quot;Imperial diet&quot; met in Dortmund.

===Middle Ages and early modern period===

After it was destroyed by a fire, the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I (Barbarossa) had the town rebuilt in 1152 and resided there (among other places) for two years. In 1267 St. Mary&#x27;s Church, Dortmund, and three years later in 1270 St. Reinold&#x27;s Church first mentioned. The combination of crossroad, market place, administrative centre – town hall, made Dortmund an important centre in Westphalia. 
It became an Imperial Free City and one of the first cities in Europe with an official Brewing right in 1293. Throughout the 13th to 14th centuries, it was the &quot;chief city&quot; of the Rhine, Westphalia, the Netherlands Circle of the Hanseatic League.

After 1320, the city appeared in writing as &quot;Dorpmunde&quot;. In the years leading up to 1344, the English King, Edward III, even borrowed money from well-heeled Dortmund merchant families Berswordt and Klepping, offering the regal crown as security. In 1388, the Count of Mark joined forces with the Archbishop of Cologne and issued declarations of a feud against the town. Following a major siege lasting 18 months, peace negotiations took place and Dortmund emerged victorious. In 1400 the seat of the first Vehmic court () was in Dortmund, in a square between two linden trees, one of which was known as the &quot;Femelinde&quot;. With the growing influence of Cologne during the 15th century, the seat was moved to Arnsberg in 1437. After Cologne was excluded after the Anglo-Hanseatic War (1470–74), Dortmund was made capital of the Rhine-Westphalian and Netherlands Circle. This favors the founding of one of the oldest schools in Europe in 1543 – . In 1661 an earthquake made the Reinoldikirche collapse.

===18th, 19th and early 20th centuries===

With the &quot;Reichsdeputationshauptschluss&quot; resolution in 1803, Dortmund was added to the Principality of Nassau-Orange-Fulda, with as a result that it was no longer a free imperial city. William V, Prince of Orange-Nassau did not want stolen areas and therefore let his son Prince Willem Frederik (the later King William I of the Netherlands) take possession of the city and the principality. This prince held its entry on 30 June 1806, and as such the County of Dortmund then became part of the principality. On 12 July 1806, most of the Nassau principalities were deprived of their sovereign rights by means of the Rhine treaty. In October of the same year, the County of Dortmund was occupied by French troops and was added to the Grand Duchy of Berg on 1 March 1808. It is the capital of the Ruhr department. In 1808 Dortmund becomes capital of French satellite Ruhr (department). At the Congress of Vienna in 1815, the entire Grand Duchy of Berg, including Dortmund, was added to the Kingdom of Prussia. The state mining authority of the Ruhr area was founded in 1815 and moved from Bochum to Dortmund. Within the Prussian Province of Westphalia, Dortmund was a district seat within Regierungsbezirk Arnsberg until 1875, when it became an urban district within the region.
During the industrialisation of Prussia, Dortmund became a major centre for coal and steel. The town expanded into a city, with the population rising from 57,742 in 1875 to 379,950 in 1905. Sprawling residential areas like the North, East, Union and Kreuz district sprang up in less than 10 years. In 1920, Dortmund was one of the centres for resistance to the Kapp Putsch – a right-wing military coup launched against the Social Democratic-led government. In the Ruhr uprising, radical workers formed the 50,000-man Ruhr Red Army in hopes of setting up a soviet-style government. They were defeated with considerable loss of life by government and Freikorps units. On 11 January 1923, French and Belgian troops occupied the Ruhr. French Prime Minister Raymond Poincaré was responding to Germany&#x27;s failure to comply with the reparations demands of the Treaty of Versailles. The occupation lasted until August 1925.

===World War II===
Under Nazi Germany, the Old Synagogue, which had opened in 1900, was destroyed in 1938. With a capacity of 1,300 seats, it was one of the largest Jewish houses of worship in Germany. Also, the Aplerbeck Hospital in Dortmund transferred mentally and/or physically disabled patients to the Hadamar Killing Facility as part of &quot;Aktion T4&quot;, where they were murdered. An additional 229 children were murdered in the &quot;Children&#x27;s Specialist Department&quot;, which was transferred from Marburg in 1941.

Dortmund was the location of the Stalag VI-D prisoner-of-war camp for Polish, French, Belgian, British, Serbian, Soviet and Italian POWs with some 300 forced labour units in the city alone, a camp for Sinti and Romani people (see &quot;Romani Holocaust&quot;), and a subcamp of the Buchenwald concentration camp for 800 predominantly Polish women. In September 1943, the local Gestapo carried out a mass execution of 17 Polish POWs, who escaped the Oflag VI-B POW camp, but were soon captured.

Bombing targets of the Oil Campaign of World War II in Dortmund included Hoesch-Westfalenhütte AG, the &quot;Hoesch-Benzin GmbH&quot; synthetic oil plant, and the &quot;Zeche Hansa&quot;. The bombings destroyed about 66% of Dortmund homes. The devastating bombing raids of 12 March 1945 with 1,108 aircraft (748 Lancasters, 292 Halifaxes, 68 Mosquitos) destroyed 98% of buildings in the inner city centre, and 4,851 tonnes of bombs were dropped on Dortmund city centre and the south of the city; this was a record for a single target in the whole of World War II.

The Allied ground advance into Germany reached Dortmund in April 1945. The US 95th Infantry Division attacked the city on 12 April 1945 against a stubborn German defense. The division, assisted by close air support, advanced through the ruins in urban combat and completed its capture on 13 April 1945.

===Postwar period===
Post-war, most of the historic buildings in the city centre were not restored, and large parts of the inner city area were completely rebuilt in the style of the 1950s. A few historic buildings such as the main churches Reinoldikirche and Marienkirche were restored or rebuilt, and extensive parks and gardens were laid out. The simple but successful postwar rebuilding has resulted in a very mixed and unique inner cityscape. Today nearly 30 % of the city consists of buildings from before World War II. Dortmund was in the British zone of occupation of Germany, and became part of the new state (Land) of North Rhine-Westphalia in 1946. The LWL-Industriemuseum was founded in 1969. In 1987 the pit Minister Stein closed, marking the end of more than 150 years of coal mining. Dortmund has since adapted, with its century-long steel and coal industries having been replaced by high-technology areas, including biomedical technology, micro systems technology, and services. This has led Dortmund to become a regional centre for hi-tech industry.

In 2001 a new era began for the district Hörde in Dortmund, 160 years of industrial history ended with the beginning of the Phoenix See. The development of the Phoenix See area was carried out by a subsidiary of the Stadtwerke AG. In 2005 the first cornerstone was laid on the Phoenix area. The work started with full speed to manage the work with over 2.5 million meters of ground motion and 420.000 cubic meters of ferroconcrete. On 1 October 2010, the largest and most highly anticipated milestone could be celebrated: the launch of the flooding of the Phoenix See. Since 9 May 2011, the fences disappeared and the Phoenix See has been completed. In 2009, Dortmund was classified as a &quot;Node city&quot; in the Innovation Cities Index published by 2thinknow and is the most sustainable city in Germany.

On 3 November 2013, more than 20,000 people were evacuated after a 4,000-pound bomb from World War II was found. German authorities safely defused the bomb. The bomb was found after analysing old aerial photographs while searching for unexploded bombs dropped by Allied aircraft over Germany&#x27;s industrial Ruhr region.

==Geography==

===Location===

Dortmund is an independent city located in the east of the Ruhr area, one of the largest urban areas in Europe (see also: megalopolis), comprising eleven independent cities and four districts with some 5.3million inhabitants. The city limits of Dortmund itself are long and border twelve cities, two independent and ten &quot;kreisangehörig&quot; (i.e., belonging to a district), with a total population of approximately 2.4million. The following cities border Dortmund (clockwise starting from west): Bochum, Castrop-Rauxel, Waltrop, Lünen, Kamen, Unna, Holzwickede, Schwerte, Hagen, Herdecke, and Witten. Historically speaking, Dortmund is a part of Westphalia which is situated in the Bundesland North Rhine-Westphalia. Moreover, Dortmund is part of Westphalian Lowland and adjoins with the Ardey Hills, in the south of the city, to the Sauerland.

The Ruhr forms the reservoir on the Hengsteysee next to the borough of Syburg in the south of Dortmund between the cities of Hagen and Herdecke, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. The Klusenberg, a hill that is part of the Ardey range, is located just north of the Hengsteysee and the highest point of Dortmund . There is also a pumped-storage plant on this reservoir, named Koepchenwerk. The lowest point can be found in the northern borough of Brechten at .

The Emscher is a small river and has its wellspring in Holzwickede, east of the city of Dortmund, and flows west through Dortmund. Towns along the Emscher take in Dortmund, Castrop-Rauxel, Herne, Recklinghausen, Gelsenkirchen, Essen, Bottrop, Oberhausen, and Dinslaken, where it flows into the Rhine.

===Boroughs===
Dortmund comprises 62 neighbourhoods which in turn are grouped into twelve boroughs (called &quot;Stadtbezirke&quot;), often named after the most important neighbourhood. Three boroughs cover the area of the inner city (Innenstadt-West (City centre West), Innenstadt-Nord (City centre North), Innenstadt-Ost (City centre East)) and the remaining nine boroughs make up the surrounding area (Eving, Scharnhorst, Brackel, Aplerbeck, Hörde, Hombruch, Lütgendortmund, Huckarde, Mengede). Each &quot;Stadtbezirk&quot; is assigned a Roman numeral and has a local governing body of nineteen members with limited authority. Most of the boroughs were originally independent municipalities but were gradually annexed from 1905 to 1975. This long-lasting process of annexation has led to a strong identification of the population with &quot;their&quot; boroughs or districts and to a rare peculiarity: The borough of Hörde, located in the south of Dortmund and independent until 1928, has its own coat of arms.

The centre can be subdivided into historically evolved city districts, whose borders are not always strictly defined, such as:
*Stadtzentrum &quot;(City centre)&quot;
*Hafenviertel &quot;(Harbour Quarter)&quot;
*Nordmarkt &quot;(Northern market)&quot;
*Borsigplatz
*Kaiserviertel &quot;(Emperor Quarter)&quot;
*Kronenviertel &quot;(Crown Quarter)&quot;
*Kreuzviertel &quot;(Cross Quarter)&quot;
*Klinikviertel &quot;(Clinical Quarter)&quot;
*Saarlandstraßenviertel &quot;(Saarland street Quarter)&quot;
*Unionviertel &quot;(Union Quarter)&quot;
*Gartenstadt &quot;(Garden Town)&quot;

===Climate===
Dortmund is situated in the temperate climate zone with oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;). Winters are cool; summers are warm. The average annual temperature lies at approximately , the total average annual amount of precipitation lies at approximately . Precipitation evenly falls throughout the year; steady rain (with some snow), prevails in the wintertime, isolated showers dominate the summer season. Dortmund features characteristics of densely populated areas as for example the occurrence of urban heat islands is typical.

==Demographics==
Dortmund&#x27;s population grew rapidly in the time of the 19th century industrialisation, when coal mining and steel processing in the city began. 1904 marks the year when Dortmund saw a population of more than 100,000 for the first time in its history. During the 19th century the area around Dortmund, called Ruhr, attracted up to 500,000 ethnic Poles, Masurians, and Silesians from East Prussia and Silesia, in a migration known as &quot;Ostflucht&quot; (flight from the east). Most of the new inhabitants came from Eastern Europe, but immigrants also came from France, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. Almost all their descendants today speak German as a mother tongue, and for various reasons, they do not identify with their Polish roots and traditions; often only their Polish family names remaining as a sign of their past. Not taking the fluctuation of war years into account, the population figures rose constantly to 657,804 in 1965. As a result of the city&#x27;s post-industrial decline, the population fell to just under 580,000 in 2011. Today, with a population of 601.402 (2017), the City of Dortmund is the eighth largest city in Germany after Berlin, Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart, and Düsseldorf. It is also the largest city in the Ruhr agglomeration.

Contrary to earlier projections, population figures have been on the rise in recent years due to net migration gains. Dortmund has seen a moderate influx of younger people (18 to 25 years of age) mainly because of its universities. Data of the EU-wide 2011 census revealed massive inaccuracies with regard to German population figures. Consequently, respective figures have been corrected, which resulted in a statistical &quot;loss&quot; of 9,000 inhabitants in Dortmund. In 2016 it was announced that the population was back above 600,000.

, Dortmund had a population of 571,403, of whom about 177,000 (roughly 30%) were of non-German origin. The table shows the number of first and second generation immigrants in Dortmund by nationality as of 31 December 2014. As with much of the Ruhr area, Dortmund has sizable Turkish and South European communities (particularly Spanish), and had one of Germany&#x27;s most visible Slavic populations.

===Religion===
, the largest Christian denominations were Protestantism (23,7%) and Catholicism (22,6% of the population). Furthermore, in Dortmund the Greek Orthodox Church, the Serbian Orthodox Church, and the Macedonian Orthodox Church are represented. The Church of the Holy Apostles (gre. I.N. Αγίων Αποστόλων Ντόρτμουντ – I.N. Agíon Apostólon Dortmund) was the first Greek church in Germany to be founded due to the influx of &quot;guest workers&quot;. Also Dortmund is home of the New Apostolic Church in North Rhine-Westphalia, with more than 84,944 community members.

The Jewish community has a history dating back to Medieval times and has always ranked among the largest in Westphalia. Dortmund is home to the National Association of Jewish Communities of Westfalen-Lippe. The synagogues operate there in City center, Hörde, and Dorstfeld. Due to the growing immigration of people from Muslim countries beginning in the 1960s, Dortmund has a large Muslim community with more than 30 mosques.

In June 2019 Dortmund hosted the 37th Evangelischer Kirchentag – German Evangelical Church Assembly.

== Government and politics ==

Dortmund is one of nineteen independent district-free cities (&quot;kreisfreie Städte&quot;) in North Rhine-Westphalia, which means that it does not form part of another general-purpose local government entity, in this case it is not part of a Landkreis. Since 1975, Dortmund is divided into twelve administrative districts. Each district (&quot;Bezirk&quot;) has its own elected district council (Bezirksvertretung) and its own district mayor (Bezirksbürgermeister). The district councils are advisory only.

Dortmund is often called the &quot;Herzkammer der SPD&quot; (roughly translated as &quot;heartland of the Social democrats&quot;), after the politically dominant party in the city. During the Nazi era (1933–1945), mayors were installed by the Nazi Party. After World War II, the military government of the British occupation zone installed a new mayor and a municipal constitution modeled on that of British cities. The first major elected by the population of Dortmund was Fritz Henßler. Since the end of the war, the SPD has held a plurality in the city council, except for the period from 1999 to 2004.

===Mayor===

The current mayor of Dortmund is Thomas Westphal of the Social Democratic Party (SPD), who was elected in 2020.

The most recent mayoral election was held on 13 September 2020, with a runoff held on 27 September, and the results were as follows:

==Cityscape==

===City centre===

Dortmund&#x27;s city centre offers a picture full of contrasts. Historic buildings like Altes Stadthaus or the Krügerpassage rub shoulders with post-war architecture like Gesundheitshaus and concrete constructions with Romanesque churches like the Reinoldikirche and the Marienkirche. The near-complete destruction of Dortmund&#x27;s city centre during World War II (98%) has resulted in a varied architectural landscape. The reconstruction of the city centre followed the style of the 1950s, while respecting the old layout and naming of the streets. The downtown of Dortmund still retains the outline of the medieval city. A ring road marks the former city wall, and the Westen-/Ostenhellweg, part of a medieval salt trading route, is still the major (pedestrian) street bisecting the city centre.

Thus, the inner city today is characterized by simple and modest post-war buildings, with a few interspersed pre-war buildings which were reconstructed due to their historical importance. Some buildings of the &quot;Wiederaufbauzeit&quot; (era of reconstruction), for example the opera house are nowadays regarded as classics of modern architecture.

===Urban districts===
Unlike the Dortmund city centre, much of the inner districts around the old medieval centre escaped damage in the second world war and post war redevelopment.

====Kreuzviertel====

The Kreuzviertel is characterised by old buildings, the majority of which come from the turn of the 20th century (1884 to 1908). Over 80% of all housing in this area was constructed before 1948, with the oldest building the Dortmund University of Applied Sciences and Arts still standing being from 1896. In the Second World War, relatively few buildings were destroyed in comparison to other areas of the city. Today, Kreuzviertel forms a nearly homogeneous historic building area. Over 100 buildings remain protected as historic monuments, like the Kreuzkirche at Kreuzstraße and the first concrete church in Germany St.-Nicolai. Nowadays the Kreuzviertel is a trendy district with pubs, restaurants, cafés, galleries, and little shops. Moreover, local efforts to beautify and invigorate the neighbourhood have reinforced a budding sense of community and artistic expression. The West park is the green lung of the Kreuzviertel and in the months between May and October a centre of the student urban life. The district has the highest real estate prices in Dortmund.

Even today many artists choose Kreuzviertel as their residence: Sascha Schmitz, Christina Hammer, and players of Borussia Dortmund.

==== Nordstadt ====

The northern downtown part of Dortmund called Nordstadt, situated in a territory of is shaped by a colorful variety of cultures. As the largest homogeneous old building area in Ruhr the Nordstadt is a melting pot of different people of different countries and habits just a few steps from the city center. The Nordstadt is an industrial urban area that was mainly developed in the 19th century to serve the Westfalenhütte steelworks, port and rail freight depot. All of the residents live in a densely populated 300 hectare area (the most densely populated residential area in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia with steelworks, port and railway lines acting as physical barriers cutting off the area from the city centre and other residential districts).

The area has been badly affected by the deindustrialisation of these heavy industries, with the target area developing a role as the home for growing numbers of immigrants and socially disadvantaged groups partly because of the availability of cheaper (although poor quality) accommodation. Nevertheless, two parks – Fredenbaumpark and Hoeschpark – are situated there. There is also much equipment for children to spend their free time. For example, the 35 meters high Big Tipi, which was brought in from the Expo 2000 in Hanover. All of that should attract families to settle in, but low prices of apartments and a variety of renting offers speak for the contrary. This developed into the youngest population of Dortmund is living and created a district with art house cinemas to ethnic stores, from exotic restaurants to student pubs.

The Borsigplatz is probably one of the best known squares in Germany. Ballspielverein Borussia Dortmund was founded nearby, north-east of the main railway station. The streets radiating outward to form a star shape, the sycamore in the middle of the square and the tramline running diagonally across the square give Borsigplatz its very own flair.

====Kaiserviertel====

The Kaiserstraßen District is located east of the former ramparts of Dortmund and follows the course of the Westenhellweg. In this district numerous magnificent buildings from the 1900s and new buildings from the 1950s are located next to the heritage-protected State Mining Office Dortmund, several Courts, Consulate and the East Cemetery. The district is characterize by the employee of the Amtsgericht, Landgericht (the first and second instances of ordinary jurisdiction) and the Prison.

Today the historical Kaiserbrunnen and the entrance sign for Kaiserstraße are important starting points for a tour to the popular shopping district. The Moltkestreet also known as the Cherry Blossom Avenue, became famous after photographers started posting pictures of blooming trees. Every spring, usually in April, the street in the Kaiserstraßen district is booming with pink blossoms and attracts tourists.

====Unionviertel====

The Union District is located west of the former ramparts of Dortmund and follows the course of the Westenhellweg. For a long time, the neighbourhood at the Dortmunder U and along the Rheinische Straße was marked by vacancy and social distortion due to structural change. Today it is developing an inspiring young artist scene, with more and more students thanks to cheaper apartments near the university and a vibrant gastronomy. This development benefits strongly from the new, widely visible beacon, the art and creative centre Dortmunder U, opened in 2010. Yet, for a time, it was mainly the Union Gewerbehof activists and other single stakeholders who initiated change.

====Hörde on Lake Phoenix====

Hörde is borough in the south of the city of Dortmund. Originally Hörde was a separate town (until 1929) and was founded by the Counts of Mark in opposition to their principal enemy, the town of Dortmund. In 1388, the &quot;Großen Dortmunder Fehde&quot; (great feud of Dortmund) took place, where the city of Dortmund battled against the alliance of surrounding towns. The struggle ended in 1390, with defeat for Hörde and its allies of Herdecke, Witten, Bochum, Castrop, Lünen, Unna, and Schwerte. Today Hörde is a part of Dortmund with restored old buildings combined with modern architecture. The Hörder Burg (Hörde castle) was built in the 12th century and is located in the east of the town, close to the Emscher and Lake Phoenix.

Lake Phoenix was one of the largest urban redevelopment projects in Europe. On the area of the former blast furnace and steel plant site of ThyssenKrupp newly formed and developed a new urban resident and recreational area from the city centre of Dortmund. The development of the Phoenix See area cost €;170 million. The lake is 1.2 km long directed to east–west and 320 meters wide in north–south direction. The water surface area of 24 acres is larger than the Hamburg Alster. Lake Phoenix is a shallow water lake with a depth of 3 to 4 meters and a capacity of around 600,000 cubic meters. Attractive high priced residential areas were thus created on the southern and northern sides of the Lake.

==Transportation==

===Road transport===

Dortmund also serves as a major European and German crossroads for the Autobahnsystem. The Ruhrschnellweg follows old Hanseatic trade routes to connect the city with the other metropolises of the Ruhr Area. It crosses the Dutch-German border as a continuation of the Dutch A67 and crosses the Rhine, leads through the Ruhr valley toward Bochum, becoming B 1 (Bundesstraße 1) at the Kreuz Dortmund West and eventually merging into the A 44 near Holzwickede. It has officially been named Ruhrschnellweg (Ruhr Fast Way), but locals usually call it Ruhrschleichweg (Ruhr Crawling Way) or &quot;the Ruhr area&#x27;s longest parking lot&quot;. According to &quot;Der Spiegel&quot;, it is the most congested motorway in Germany.

Connections to more distant parts of Germany are maintained by Autobahn routes A1 and A2, which traverse the north and east city limits and meet at the Kamener Kreuz interchange north-east of Dortmund.
In combination with the Autobahn A45 to the west these form the Dortmund Beltway (&quot;Dortmunder Autobahnring&quot;).

===Cycling===
Cycling in Dortmund is supported by urban planners – an extensive network of cycle paths exists which had its beginnings in the 1980s. Dortmund was admitted to the German &quot;Association of Pedestrian and Bicycle-Friendly Cities and Municipalities in NRW&quot; (AGFS) on August 8, 2007. Dortmund is connected to a number of long-distance cycle paths and a Bike freeway called the &quot;Radschnellweg Ruhr&quot; (Ruhr Area Fast Cycle Path).

===Rail transport===

As with most communes in the Ruhr area, local transport is carried out by a local, publicly owned company for transport within the city, the DB Regio subsidiary of for regional transport and itself for long-distance journeys. The local carrier, Dortmunder Stadtwerke (DSW21), is a member of the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Ruhr (VRR) association of public transport companies in the Ruhr area, which provides a uniform fare structure in the whole region. Within the VRR region, tickets are valid on lines of all members as well as DB&#x27;s railway lines (except the high-speed InterCity and Intercity-Express networks) and can be bought at ticket machines and service centres of DSW21, all other members of VRR, and DB.

The central train station (Dortmund Hauptbahnhof) is the third largest long-distance traffic junction in Germany. Dortmund has a railway service with InterCity and ICE-trains stopping at &quot;Dortmund Hauptbahnhof&quot; (Dortmund Main Station). ICE and TGV Thalys high-speed trains link Dortmund with Amsterdam, Brussels (in 2h 30) and Paris (in 3h 50). There are frequent ICE trains to other German cities, including Frankfurt am Main, Berlin and other cities in the Rhein-Ruhr Region.

=== Public transportation ===
For public transportation, the city has an extensive Stadtbahn and bus system. The Stadtbahn has eight lines (U41 to U47 and U49) serving Dortmund and the large suburb of Lünen in the north. The trains that run on the line are in fact lightrails as many lines travel along a track in the middle of the street instead of underground further from the city centre. The minimum service interval is 2.5 minutes, although the usual pattern is that each line runs at 5 to 10 minute intervals. On Sundays the trains run at a 15-minute interval. In April 2008, the newly constructed east–west underground light rail line was opened, completing the underground service in the city centre and replacing the last trams on the surface.

A number of bus lines complete the Dortmund public transport system. Night buses replace Stadtbahn services between 1:30 am and 7:30 am on weekends and public holidays. The central junction for the night bus service is Reinoldikirche in the city centre, where all night bus lines start and end.

The H-Bahn at Technical University of Dortmund is a hanging monorail built specifically to shuttle passengers between the university&#x27;s two campuses, which are now also flanked by research laboratories and other high-tech corporations and startups. A nearly identical monorail system transfers passengers at Düsseldorf Airport.

===Air transport===
Dortmund Airport is a medium-sized, but fast growing airport east of the city centre at the city limit to Holzwickede. The airport serves the area of the Ruhrgebiet, Sauerland, Westphalia and parts of the Netherlands and features flights to Munich, London, Vienna, Porto and a lot of eastern European city and leisure destinations. The airport is served by an express bus to Dortmund main station, a shuttle bus to the nearby railway station &quot;Holzwickede/Dortmund Flughafen&quot;, a bus to the city&#x27;s metro line &quot;U47&quot;, as well as a bus to the city of Unna.

Lüneburg has been allowed to use the title (&#x27;Hanseatic Town&#x27;) in its name since 2007, in recognition of its membership in the former Hanseatic League. Lüneburg is also home to Leuphana University.

== History ==

=== Prehistory ===
The first signs of human presence in the area of Lüneburg date back to the time of Neanderthal Man: 56 axes, estimated at 150,000 years old, were uncovered during the construction in the 1990s of the autobahn between Ochtmissen and Bardowick. The site of the discovery at Ochtmissen was probably a Neanderthal hunting location where huntsmen skinned and cut up the animals they had caught.

The area was almost certainly not continuously inhabited at that time, however, due to the various glaciations that lasted for millennia. The first indication of a permanent, settled farming culture in the area was found not far from the site of the Neanderthal discovery in the river Ilmenau between Lüne and Bardowick. This was an axe that is described as a &quot;Schuhleistenkeil&quot; or &quot;shoe last wedge&quot; due to its shape. It dates to the 6th century BC and is now in the collection of the Lüneburg Museum.

Since the Bronze Age, the Lüneburg hill known as the &quot;Zeltberg&quot; has concealed a whole range of prehistoric and early historic graves, which were laid out by people living in the area of the present-day town of Lüneburg. One of the oldest finds from this site is a so-called Unetice flanged axe (&quot;Aunjetitzer Randleistenbeil&quot;) which dates to 1900 BC.

The land within the town itself has also yielded a number of ice age urns that were already being reported in the 18th century. These discoveries are, however, like those from the Lüneburger Kalkberg — they went into the private collections of several 18th century scholars and, with a few exceptions, were lost when the scholars died.

Also worth mentioning in this regard are the Lombard Urnfield graves on the Lüneburg Zeltberg and Oedeme from the first few centuries AD. In the Middle Ages, there several discoveries were made on the site of the town, for example on the site of the old village of Modestorpe not far from St. John&#x27;s Church (&quot;Johanniskirche&quot;), at the Lambertiplatz near the saltworks and in the old Waterside Quarter.

The ancient town may be that identified as Leufana or Leuphana (), a town listed in Ptolemy (2.10) in the north of Germany on the west of the Elbe.

=== From village to commercial town ===

Lüneburg was first mentioned in medieval records in a deed signed on 13 August, 956 AD, in which Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor granted &quot;the tax from Lüneburg to the monastery built there in honour of Saint Michael&quot; (German: &quot;den Zoll zu Lüneburg an das zu Ehren des heiligen Michaels errichtete Kloster&quot;, Latin: &quot;teloneum ad Luniburc ad monasterium sancti Michahelis sub honore constructum&quot;). An older reference to the place in the &quot;Royal Frankish Annals&quot; for 795 states:&quot;ad fluvium Albim pervenit ad locum, qui dicitur Hliuni&quot;, i.e. &quot;on the river Elbe, at the location, which is called &quot;Hliuni&quot;&quot;) and refers to one of the three core settlements of Lüneburg; probably the castle on the Kalkberg which was the seat of the Billunger nobles from 951. The Elbe-Germanic name &quot;Hliuni&quot; corresponds to the Lombard word for &quot;refuge site&quot;.

From archaeological finds, it is clear that the area around Lüneburg had already been settled (in the museum of the Principality of Lüneburg, for example, there is a whole range of artefacts that were found here) and the saltworks had already started production.

According to tradition, the salt was first discovered by a hunter who observed a wild boar bathing in a pool of water, shot and killed it, and hung the coat up to dry. When it was dry, he discovered white crystals in the bristles — salt. Later he returned to the site of the kill and located the salt pool, the first production of salt on the site took place. In the town hall is a bone preserved in a glass case; legend has it that this is the preserved leg-bone of the boar. It was here that the Lüneburg Saltworks was subsequently established for many centuries.

In spite of its lucrative saltworks, Lüneburg was originally subordinated to the town of Bardowick only a few miles to the north. Bardowick was older and was an important trading post for the Slavs. Bardowick&#x27;s prosperity – it had seven churches – was based purely on the fact that no other trading centres were tolerated. Only when Bardowick refused to pay allegiance to Henry the Lion it was destroyed by him in 1189, whereupon Lüneburg was given town privileges (&quot;Stadtrechte&quot;) and developed into the central trading post in the region in place of Bardowick.

The Polabian name for Lüneburg is &quot;Glain&quot; (written as &quot;Chlein&quot; or &quot;Glein&quot; in older German sources), probably derived from &quot;glaino&quot; (Slavonic: &quot;glina&quot;) which means &quot;clay&quot;. In the Latin texts Lüneburg surfaces not only as the Latinised &quot;Lunaburgum&quot;, but also as &quot;Selenopolis&quot;.

=== Hanseatic period ===

As a consequence of the monopoly that Lüneburg had for many years as a supplier of salt within the North German region, a monopoly not challenged until much later by French imports, it very quickly became a member of the Hanseatic League. The League was formed in 1158 in Lübeck, initially as a union of individual merchants, but in 1356 it met as a federation of trading towns at the first general meeting of the &quot;Hansetag&quot;. Lüneburg&#x27;s salt was needed in order to pickle the herring caught in the Baltic Sea and the waters around Norway so that it could be preserved for food inland during periods of fasting when fish (not meat) was permitted.

The Scania Market at Scania in Sweden was a major fish market for herring and became one of the most important trade events in Northern Europe in the Middle Ages. Lüneburg&#x27;s salt was in great demand and the town quickly became one of the wealthiest and most important towns in the Hanseatic League, together with Bergen and Visby (the fish suppliers) and Lübeck (the central trading post between the Baltic and the interior). In the Middle Ages salt was initially conveyed overland up the Old Salt Road to Lübeck. With the opening of the Stecknitz Canal in 1398 salt could be transported by cog from the Lübeck salt warehouses, the &quot;Salzspeicher&quot;.

Around the year 1235, the Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg emerged, ruled by a family whose aristocratic lines repeatedly divided and re-united. The smaller states that kept re-appearing as a result, and which ranked as principalities, were usually named after the location of the ducal seat. Thus between 1267 and 1269 a &quot;Principality of Lüneburg&quot; was created for the first time, with Lüneburg as the seat of the royal &quot;Residenz&quot;. In 1371, in the wake of the Lüneburg War of Succession, rebel citizens threw the princes out of the town and destroyed their royal castle on the Kalkberg along with the nearby monastery. The state peace treaty in 1392 granted their demand to become a free imperial town, a status they were able to defend until 1637. The money now stayed in the town, enabling fine houses and churches to be built. In 1288, a Judenstrasse was recorded, indicating that there was a Medieval Jewish community in Lüneburg.

In 1392, Lüneburg was accorded the staple right. This forced merchants who travelled through the area with their carts to stop in Lüneburg, unload their wares, and offer them for sale for a certain period. So that merchants could not go around Lüneburg, an impassable defensive barrier was built west of the town in 1397; a similar barrier was built east of the town in 1479.

The Lüneburg Prelates&#x27; War caused a crisis from 1446 to 1462. This was not a war in the proper sense, but rather a bitter dispute between the town council and those members of the clergy who were also part-owners of the town&#x27;s saltworks. It was not resolved until the intervention of the Danish King Christian I, the Bishop of Schwerin and the Lübeck Bishop, Arnold Westphal.

In 1454, the citizens demanded even more influence over public life.

Since 2007, Lüneburg has once again held the title of a Hanseatic town.

=== Modern period to the end of the Second World War ===

With the demise of the Hanseatic League – and the absence of herrings around 1560 around Falsterbo in Scania – the biggest customers of Lüneburg&#x27;s salt broke away and the town rapidly became impoverished. Hardly any new houses were built in central Lüneburg after this time, which is why the historical appearance of the town centre has remained almost unchanged until the present day.

The town became part of the Electorate of Hanover in 1708, the Kingdom of Westphalia in 1807, the First French Empire in 1810, the Kingdom of Hanover in 1814, and the Prussian Province of Hanover in 1866.

In the centuries after the collapse of the League, it was as if Lüneburg had fallen into a Sleeping Beauty slumber. Heinrich Heine, whose parents lived in Lüneburg from 1822 to 1826, called it his &quot;residence of boredom&quot; (&quot;Residenz der Langeweile&quot;). Near the end of the 19th century Lüneburg evolved into a garrison town, and it remained so until the 1990s.

The horticulturist Curt Backeberg was born in Lüneburg in 1894.

After the Nazi anti-Jewish pogroms known as Kristallnacht in the night of November 9, 1938, the city ordered the Lüneburg Synagogue to be torn down at the costs of the local Jewish community.

In the Lüneburg Special Children&#x27;s Ward, part of the Lüneburg State Mental Hospital, it is suspected that over 300 children were killed during the Second World War as part of the official Nazi child euthanasia programme.

When World War II broke out, Lüneburg became a target. During the bombing of Lüneburg, the town was attacked 19 times between 1940 and 1945 but miraculously survived without major damage to its city center, unlike nearby Hamburg. The biggest and most destructive bombing on Lüneburg took place on 22 February. Between 10:10 and 14:15, 39 airplanes bombed the city and its surroundings. As a result, multiple trenches near the Lüneburg station and the station&#x27;s air raid shelter were hit by bombs, killing a total 350 people. The railway bridge over the Dahlenburger Landstraße also collapsed. The houses around the railway station were severely damaged or completely destroyed. In Wandrahmstraße, the Lüneburg Museum, whose holdings had not been completely removed, was completely destroyed. Furthermore, the terminus of the Lüneburg-Bleckede railway line, the marshalling yard, a dairy on Lüner Weg and a factory in the Am Schwalbenberg street were severely damaged. A second big raid happened on 7 April 1945 with 13 aircraft. The target was once more the railway station and its surroundings, where a train with 400 prisoners from the &quot;Alter Banter Weg&quot; satellite camp near Wilhelmshaven, who were to be taken to Neuengamme, was parked. Because the prisoners were locked in the carriages, they were unable to flee when the bombs fell, killing 256 in total. The goods station was completely destroyed, as were the waterworks and the Wachsbleiche factory. The teachers&#x27; seminar on Wilschenbrucher Weg, which housed an auxiliary hospital and was then used by the Leuphana University of Lüneburg, was badly damaged by a direct bomb hit, as was the auxiliary hospital Zur Hasenburg on Soltauer Straße. Many bombs also hit the Rote Feld, which was still largely undeveloped at the time. While the attacks resulted in 608 casualties, Lüneburg itself was largely spared and only a total of 270 homes were destroyed or damaged beyond repair.

1945 is also the year where on Lüneburg Heath the unconditional surrender of the three German armies operating in Northwest Germany was signed. The location is presently inaccessible to the general public as it lies within a military out-of-bounds area. Only a small monument on a nearby track alludes to the event. On 23 May 1945, Reichsführer SS Heinrich Himmler took his own life in Lüneburg whilst in British Army custody by biting into a potassium cyanide capsule embedded in his teeth before he could be properly interrogated. He was subsequently buried in an unmarked location in a nearby forest.

=== Post-war period ===
Even before the Nuremberg Trials took place, the first war crimes trial, the so-called Belsen Trial (&quot;Bergen-Belsen-Prozess&quot;), began in Lüneburg on 17 September 1945 conducted against 45 former SS men, women and &quot;kapos&quot; (prisoner functionaries) from the Bergen-Belsen and Auschwitz concentration camps. 
After World War II, Lüneburg became part of the new state of Lower Saxony. But the dilapidated state of its buildings led to various plans to try to improve living conditions. One proposition that was seriously discussed was to tear down the entire &quot;Altstadt&quot; and replace it with modern buildings. The ensuing public protest resulted in Lüneburg becoming the focal point for a new concept: cultural heritage conservation. Since the early 1970s the town has been systematically restored. A leading figure in this initiative since the late 1960s has been Curt Pomp: against much opposition from politicians and councillors he founded and championed the Lüneburg &quot;Altstadt&quot; Working Group (&quot;Arbeitskreis Lüneburger Altstadt&quot;) for the preservation of historic buildings. His engagement was rewarded with the German Prize for Cultural Heritage Conservation and the German Order of Merit. Today Lüneburg is a tourist attraction as a result of the restoration and important sectors of the town&#x27;s economy also depend on tourism.

Between Lüneburg and Soltau to the southwest, a large military training area, the Soltau-Lüneburg Training Area (SLTA), was established by the British and Canadian military, which was used from 1963 to 1994. It was governed by the Soltau-Lüneburg Agreement between the Federal Republic of Germany, the United Kingdom and Canada. The area was located on the Lüneburg Heath and was heavily used particularly by tanks and other armoured vehicles.

The salt mine was closed in 1980, ending the thousand-year tradition of salt mining, although small amounts are still mined for ceremonial purposes. Small bags of salt may be purchased in the town hall, and bags are given as a gift from the town to all couples married in the town. After the closing of the salt mines, the town gained new relevance from its university, which was founded in 1989.

As part of the restructuring of Defence in 1990 two of the three &quot;Bundeswehr&quot; barracks in the town were closed and the remaining one reduced in size. The &quot;Bundesgrenzschutz&quot; barracks was also closed. Lüneburg University moved to the site of the old Scharnhorst barracks. The university grew out of the new economics and cultural studies departments set up in the 1980s and their amalgamation with the College of Education (&quot;Pädagogischen Hochschule&quot; or &quot;PH&quot;) that took place in 1989. Since its move to the former barracks site the university has enrolled increasing numbers of students. The expansion of the university is an important contribution to the restructuring of the town into a service centre.

Today an industrial estate, the &quot;Lünepark&quot;, has been built on the terrain of the old &quot;Bundesgrenzschutz&quot; barracks with its new industrial premises for entrepreneurs. The promotion of trade and industry has resulted in many firms from the ICT area locating themselves there. In May 2006 the nearby Johannes Westphal Bridge was opened to traffic. This links the newly created &quot;Lünepark&quot; with the suburb of Goseburg on the far side of the Ilmenau. Since 5 October 2007 Lüneburg has been able to call itself a Hanseatic Town; together with Stade it is one of only two towns in Lower Saxony to bear the title.

=== Amalgamated villages/communities ===
* 1943: Hagen and Lüne
* 1974: Häcklingen, Ochtmissen, Oedeme and Rettmer as well as the &quot;Ortsteile&quot; of Alt-Hagen, Ebensberg and Pflegerdorf/Gut Wienebüttel.

== Geography ==

=== Location ===
Lüneburg lies on the river Ilmenau, about from its confluence with the Elbe. The river flows through the town and is featured in its song; it was formerly traversed by cogs taking salt from the town to the other, larger, ports of the Hanseatic League nearby.

To the south of the town stretches the Lüneburg Heath which emerged as a result of widespread tree-felling, forest fires and grazing. The tradition that the heath arose from centuries of logging undertaken to meet the constant need of the Lüneburg salt works for wood is not historically confirmed. More likely, the heath was originally formed by clearances during the Bronze Age. The old town (&quot;Altstadt&quot;) of Lüneburg lies above a salt dome which is the town&#x27;s original source of prosperity. However, the constant mining of the salt deposits over which the town stands has also resulted in the sometimes gradual, sometimes dramatically pronounced, sinking of various areas of the town. On the western edge of the town is the Kalkberg, a small hill and former gypsum quarry.

=== Neighbouring towns and cities ===
There are several towns, cities, and urban areas around Lüneburg in all directions:
=== Town layout ===

==== Historical quarters ====

The motto &quot;Mons, Pons, Fons&quot; (&quot;Hill, bridge, spring&quot;) characterised the development of the town from the 8th century as it coalesced from initially three, and later four, areas of settlement. These areas were the refuge castle on the — at that time considerably higher — Kalkberg, together with its adjoining settlement (the &quot;Marktviertel&quot; or &quot;Market Quarter&quot;), the village of Modestorpe between the bridge over the river Ilmenau and the large square, &quot;Am Sande&quot; (the &quot;Sandviertel&quot; or &quot;Sand Quarter&quot;), and the saline with its walled settlement for the work force (the &quot;Sülzviertel&quot; or &quot;Salt Quarter&quot;). Not until the 13th century was the river port settlement (the &quot;Wasserviertel&quot; or &quot;Waterside Quarter&quot;) built between the market place and the Ilmenau. The resulting shape of the town thus formed did not change until its expansion in the late 19th century and it is still clearly visible today.
Lüneburg&#x27;s six historic town gates were the &quot;Altenbrücker Tor&quot;, the &quot;Bardowicker Tor&quot;, the &quot;Rote Tor&quot;, the &quot;Sülztor&quot;, the &quot;Lüner Tor&quot; and the &quot;Neue Tor&quot;.

==== &quot;Stadtteile&quot; ====
Lüneburg has the following &quot;Stadtteile&quot;: Altstadt, Bockelsberg, Ebensberg, Goseburg-Zeltberg, Häcklingen, Kaltenmoor (the largest &quot;Stadtteil&quot;, with around 8,000 inhabitants), Kreideberg, Lüne, Moorfeld, Mittelfeld, Neu Hagen, Ochtmissen, Oedeme, Rettmer, Rotes Feld, Schützenplatz, Weststadt and Wilschenbruch.

Jüttkenmoor, Klosterkamp, Bülows Kamp, In den Kämpen, Krähornsberg, Schäferfeld, Volgershall and Zeltberg are the names of individual blocks within a single &quot;Stadtteil&quot;.

=== Subsidence ===
The houses in the historic quarter between the Lüneburg Saltworks (today the German Salt Museum) and the Kalkberg were built above a salt dome that was excavated by the saltworks and which extended to just below the surface of the ground. As a result of the increasing quantities of salt mined with improved technical equipment after 1830, the ground began to sink by several metres. This resulted in the so-called &quot;Senkungsgebiet&quot; or &quot;subsidence area&quot;. The houses there and the local church (St. Lambert&#x27;s) lost their stability and had to be demolished. Because of this subsidence, and because salt mining was increasingly unprofitable, the saltworks were finally closed in 1980. Today, only small amounts of brine are extracted for the health spa in the Lüneburg Thermal Salt Baths (the &quot;Salztherme Lüneburg&quot; or &quot;SaLü&quot;). One side of the saltworks now houses a supermarket, while the other is the German Salt Museum.

The subsidence has been monitored at about 240 stations since 1946 every two years. The land has not quite stopped subsiding yet, but it is stable enough that new construction has taken place on it, and several historic buildings which had previously been damaged or demolished have been restored. The subsidence can still be clearly seen even today. Those who walk from &quot;Am Sande&quot; to the end of the &quot;Grapengießerstraße&quot; can clearly sense the degree of subsidence for themselves: the hollow in front of them was formerly at the same level as the &quot;Grapengießerstraße&quot;. This depression extends as far as the &quot;Lambertiplatz&quot; square.

In the &quot;Frommestraße&quot;, another sign of earth movements caused by salt mining may be seen: the &quot;Tor zur Unterwelt&quot; (&quot;Door to the Underworld&quot;), where two cast iron doors have been pushed on top of one another.

Near the church St. Michaelis, other consequences of the subsidence can be seen in its sloping columns and the west wing of the nave. Current subsidence movements can be seen in the road known as &quot;Ochtmisser Kirchsteig&quot;.

=== Climate ===
Lüneburg has an oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;; Trewartha: &quot;Dolk&quot;). The average temperature ranges from in winter to in summer. Precipitation is evenly distributed throughout the year, with slightly more precipitation in summer than in winter.

The Lüneburg weather station has recorded the following extreme values:
* Its highest temperature was on 9 August 1992.
* Its lowest temperature was on 24 February 1956.
* Its greatest annual precipitation was in 1954.
* Its least annual precipitation was in 1959.
* The longest annual sunshine was 1,861.1 hours in 1953.
* The shortest annual sunshine was 1,277.8 hours in 1962.

== Demographics ==

Lüneburg already had about 14,000 inhabitants in the Late Middle Ages and beginning of the Modern Period and was one of the largest &#x27;cities&#x27; of its time, but its population shrank with the economic downturn to just 9,400 in 1757; then rose again to 10,400 in 1813. With the onset of industrialisation in the 19th century, population growth accelerated. If 13,000 were living in the town in 1855, by 1939 there were as many as 35,000. Shortly after the Second World War, refugees and displaced persons from Germany&#x27;s eastern territories brought an increase in population within just a few months of around 18,000 people so that the total number in December 1945 was 53,000. In 2003 the 70,000 level was exceeded for the first time.

The town of Lüneburg, its eponymous district and the neighbouring district of Harburg belong to the few regions in Germany that have experienced such a massive growth. The reasons for this include the growth of areas around the Hamburg Metropolitan Region and the consequent shift of people to those areas. The Lower Saxon State Office for Statistics has forecast that the town of Lüneburg will have a population of 89,484 by the year 2021. More realistic estimates, however, put the future size Lüneburg at between 75,000 and 79,000 in that time frame.

On 31 December 2008, according to the Statistics Office, the official census for Lüneburg recorded 72,492 people (those who had their main residence in the town and after adjustments with other states offices) – the highest number in its history. Currently Lüneburg is the eleventh largest centre of population in Lower Saxony. In addition Lüneburg has particularly close relations with its adjacent municipalities which are also growing and with which it is forming an agglomeration. The town, together with the nearby villages of Adendorf, Bardowick, Deutsch Evern, Reppenstedt, Vögelsen and Wendisch Evern, has a total population of about 103,000 and, on that basis, would qualify as a city (in Germany cities or &quot;Großstädte&quot; are defined as settlements with a population of over 100,000). The town council has the plan to extend the population by adding these villages to the town area.

The following overview shows the population figures based on the situation at the time. Up to 1813 they were mostly estimates; thereafter based on censuses (*) or official projections by the State Office of Statistics. From 1871 the figures were based on those &#x27;present in the town&#x27;, from 1925 on those &#x27;living in the town&#x27; and since 1987 on the &#x27;population who have their main residence in the town&#x27;. Before 1871 the numbers were based on inconsistent survey methods.
== Economy ==
At one time Lüneburg had over 80 breweries. The &quot;Lüneburger Kronen Brewery of 1485&quot; in &quot;Heiligengeiststraße&quot; brewed beers such as &quot;Lüneburger Kronen-Pilsener&quot; and &quot;Moravia Pilsener&quot; that were very well known in North Germany. These beers are brewed today by the Holsten Brewery in Hamburg, although the original yeast stock (&quot;Hefestämme&quot;) was destroyed when the Kronen Brewery was taken over. Only the original &quot;Lüneburger Pilsener&quot; is still produced as before, although it is now made by the Holsten Brewery and only sold on tap. Today there are just two small inn breweries left in Lüneburg. In the Nolte Inn Brewery (&quot;Gasthausbrauerei Nolte&quot;) some distance from the centre on the &quot;Dahlenburger Landstraße&quot; and in the &quot;Brau- und Tafelhaus Mälzer&quot; in &quot;Heiligengeiststraße&quot; the tradition of Lüneburger breweries lives on.

Recently Lüneburg has increasingly developed into a venue for tourists. Nevertheless, medium-sized and small businesses still play a major role in Lüneburg&#x27;s economy. The &quot;University of Lüneburg&quot; has also generated changes which, together with its student population, have stimulated the economy of the region.

=== Important local firms ===

==== Industry and trade ====
Many small and medium-sized businesses are based in Lüneburg. They include the fashion company &quot;Roy Robson&quot;, &quot;DeVauGe Gesundkostwerk&quot; one of the largest German manufacturers of vegetarian food and the dairy, which today is part of &quot;Hochwald Nahrungsmittel-Werke&quot; and makes products, &quot;e.g.&quot;, yoghurt, under the &quot;Lünebest&quot; label. (The knitware firm &quot;Lucia&quot;, once the biggest employer in the town, went bankrupt in 2008.) In the industrial field there are large local firms like the car interior manufacturers, &quot;Johnson Controls&quot;, &quot;H. B. Fuller&quot;, &quot;Impreglon&quot; and the electronics company of &quot;Sieb &amp; Meyer&quot;. Also based in Lüneburg is the &quot;von Stern&#x27;schen Druckerei&quot;, founded in 1614, the oldest printing firm still in family ownership in the world. &quot;Werum IT Solutions&quot; is the largest information technology firm based in the town.

==== Tourism, new technologies and the service sector ====
The town nursery has created a spa park for tourists and visitors with a &#x27;graduation works&#x27;, ponds, numerous herbaceous borders and herb gardens which is immediately next to the health spa centre (&quot;Kurzentrum&quot;). The spa centre has wave pools, salt baths, wellness and sauna facilities, etc. (&quot;Salztherme Lüneburg&quot;); in addition there is a brine therapy centre which is used for those with skin and respiratory problems. Lüneburg is not an official health spa like e. g. the neighbouring town of Bad Bevensen, but does have special medicinal resources like, for example, Lüneburg brine (containing about 26% salt), which is used especially to relieve those suffering from psoriasis. In addition, since 1978, the headquarters of the conference hotel group &quot;Seminaris&quot; has been based here. Among firms in the technology and service sectors is &quot;Gründungszentrum e-novum&quot;, which supports new venture firms.

== Governance ==
The town of Lüneburg is part of &#x27;State Constituency 49 Lüneburg&#x27; and &#x27;Federal Constituency No. 38 Lüchow-Dannenberg – Lüneburg&#x27;.

=== Council ===
Local election results in 2016 for the town council of Lüneburg:

=== Mayor ===
Before the Second World War the lord mayor (&quot;Oberbürgermeister&quot;) was the full-time head of the town&#x27;s administration. On the introduction of the North German council constitution by the British occupation forces power was separated: the voluntary lord mayor and chairman of the town body was the political representative of the town who, like all the members of the town council was elected by the people, whilst the administration was headed up by a full-time chief municipal director, who was elected by the town council. Since 1996, as a result of the reform of the local constitution, both functions (again) have been combined in the post of a full-time lord mayor, who is now directly elected by the townsfolk. In addition to the lord mayor there are other mayors (elected by the council) who support and represent the lord mayor in his civic duties.

The current mayors are: &quot;Eduard Kolle&quot; (SPD), &quot;Ulrich Löb&quot; (Bündnis 90/Die Grünen), and &quot;Christel John&quot; (CDU).
==Twin towns – sister cities==

Lüneburg is twinned with:

* Scunthorpe, England, UK (1960)
* Naruto, Japan (1974)
* Clamart, France (1975)
* Ivrea, Italy (1988)
* Viborg, Denmark (1992)
* Tartu, Estonia (1993)
In addition Lüneburg has friendly relations with German towns Kulmbach and Köthen.

== Arts and culture ==




=== Theatre ===
The Lüneburg Theatre (&quot;Theater Lüneburg&quot;) is one of the smallest, three-stage theatres in Germany. Not only are plays of all styles put on, but also operas, operettas, musicals and ballets. Although the financial means of the Lüneburg Theatre are comparatively limited, it is no &#x27;provincial stage&#x27; and can hold its ground successfully against the many theatres in nearby Hamburg. In addition Lüneburg has a large number of amateur theatres, that also produce regular performances. Such a variety in amateur drama is otherwise only found in large cities like Hamburg or Hanover.

=== Museums ===
The historic town is itself a kind of open-air museum (a &quot;Rothenburg of the North&quot;), but there are numerous museums and historic churches: St. Michaelis, St. Johannis, St. Nicolai. The most important museums are the German Salt Museum in the premises of the old Lüneburg Saltworks, in which the significance of salt in the Middle Ages and the extraction of salt is portrayed, and the Museum of the Principality of Lüneburg, in which the town&#x27;s history and the history of the surrounding area is captured. Also worthy of mention are the East Prussian Regional Museum, the nearby North German Brewery Museum with a gallery of valuable drinking vessels (over 1200 years), the 1485 Kronen Brewery of Lüneburg and the Lüneburg Nature Museum on the edge of the subsidence zone.

=== Town architecture ===
Lüneburg is one of the few towns in North Germany whose historic centre was not destroyed during the Second World War. Nevertheless, the general neglect of its buildings until the 1960s and the damage in the area of subsidence has led to gaps in the historic architecture of the town. In addition the demolition of ramshackle buildings in the 1950s and 1960s and the construction of shops with a contemporary design broke up the historic appearance of many rows of houses. Since the beginning of the 1970s, however, Lüneburg has been carefully restored. The restoration process revealed hitherto hidden ceiling frescos, medieval pottery workshops and many historic soakaways (&quot;Sickergruben&quot;) from which a considerably better picture of life in the Middle Ages resulted.

In the Lüneburg &quot;Stadtteil&quot; of Kaltenmoor is St. Stephen&#x27;s (&quot;St. Stephanus&quot;), the oldest ecumenical building in the town, with Protestant and Catholic churches under one roof. Other buildings worthy of mention are the three remaining town churches: St. Johannis am Sande (completed 1370), St. Michaelis where Johann Sebastian Bach was a choirboy from 1700 to 1702, and the relatively &#x27;modern&#x27; St. Nicolai which was built in 1407. The Church of St. Lambertus (&quot;St. Lamberti&quot;) was demolished in 1850 due to its dilapidated state; it stood in the subsidence area.

In addition there are the &quot;Glockenhaus&quot; (&quot;Bell House&quot;, an old armoury) on the &quot;Glockenhof&quot;, the &quot;Rathsapotheke&quot; (town chemist&#x27;s), dating to 1598, in &quot;Große Bäckerstraße&quot; and the historic town hall or &quot;Rathaus&quot; with its famous town council meeting room, the &quot;Gerichtslaube&quot;. The Luna Fountain (&quot;Lunabrunnen&quot;) in front of the town hall is graced by a bronze statue of the moon goddess with bow and arrow; the original dating to 1532 was stolen in 1970 and melted down; the present statue is a replica dating to 1972. In the area of the old port can still be seen the Baroque façade of the &quot;Old Store&quot; (&quot;Altes Kaufhaus&quot;), most of the rest of which was burned down and had to be replaced by one that was more suitable for a fire station. The port is also home to the &quot;Old Crane&quot; (&quot;Alter Kran&quot;), a wooden, medieval riverside crane that is still in working order today and which has two large wheels inside that enable the crane cable to be raised and lowered. The fire station moved in autumn 2007 to a new building on the edge of the town centre; the &quot;Altes Kaufhaus&quot; has since (2009) been converted into a hotel.

On the southern edge of the town centre is the Lüneburg Water Tower which now acts as an observation tower.

In front of the gates of the old town is Lüne Abbey, a former Benedictine nunnery. It was built in 1172 and has been restored.

About west of Lüneburg, in the villages of Reppenstedt and Vögelsen, is a well-preserved section of the historic Lüneburg Landwehr, a boundary embankment and ditch, that can be walked.

<text>Computational biology refers to the use of techniques in computer science, data analysis, mathematical modeling and computational simulations to understand biological systems and relationships. An intersection of computer science, biology, and data science, the field also has foundations in applied mathematics, molecular biology, cell biology, chemistry, and genetics.

== History ==
Bioinformatics, the analysis of informatics processes in biological systems, began in the early 1970s. At this time, research in artificial intelligence was using network models of the human brain in order to generate new algorithms. This use of biological data pushed biological researchers to use computers to evaluate and compare large data sets in their own field. 

By 1982, researchers shared information via punch cards. The amount of data grew exponentially by the end of the 1980s, requiring new computational methods for quickly interpreting relevant information.

Perhaps the best-known example of computational biology, the Human Genome Project, officially began in 1990. By 2003, the project had mapped around 85% of the human genome, satisfying its initial goals. Work continued, however, and by 2021 level &quot; a complete genome&quot; was reached with only 0.3% remaining bases covered by potential issues. The missing Y chromosome was added in January 2022.

Since the late 1990s, computational biology has become an important part of biology, leading to numerous subfields. Today, the International Society for Computational Biology recognizes 21 different &#x27;Communities of Special Interest&#x27;, each representing a slice of the larger field. In addition to helping sequence the human genome, computational biology has helped create accurate models of the human brain, map the 3D structure of genomes, and model biological systems.

== Global contributions ==

=== Colombia ===
In 2000, despite a lack of initial expertise in programming and data management, Colombia began applying computational biology from an industrial perspective, focusing on plant diseases. This research has contributed to understanding how to counteract diseases in crops like potatoes and studying the genetic diversity of coffee plants. By 2007, concerns about alternative energy sources and global climate change prompted biologists to collaborate with systems and computer engineers. Together, they developed a robust computational network and database to address these challenges. In 2009, in partnership with the University of Los Angeles, Colombia also created a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) to improve the integration of computational biology and bioinformatics.

=== Poland ===
In Poland, computational biology is closely linked to mathematics and computational science, serving as a foundation for bioinformatics and biological physics. The field is divided into two main areas: one focusing on physics and simulation and the other on biological sequences. The application of statistical models in Poland has advanced techniques for studying proteins and RNA, contributing to global scientific progress. Polish scientists have also been instrumental in evaluating protein prediction methods, significantly enhancing the field of computational biology. Over time, they have expanded their research to cover topics such as protein-coding analysis and hybrid structures, further solidifying Poland&#x27;s influence on the development of bioinformatics worldwide.

==Applications==

===Anatomy===

Computational anatomy is the study of anatomical shape and form at the visible or gross anatomical formula_1 scale of morphology. It involves the development of computational mathematical and data-analytical methods for modeling and simulating biological structures. It focuses on the anatomical structures being imaged, rather than the medical imaging devices. Due to the availability of dense 3D measurements via technologies such as magnetic resonance imaging, computational anatomy has emerged as a subfield of medical imaging and bioengineering for extracting anatomical coordinate systems at the morpheme scale in 3D.

The original formulation of computational anatomy is as a generative model of shape and form from exemplars acted upon via transformations. The diffeomorphism group is used to study different coordinate systems via coordinate transformations as generated via the Lagrangian and Eulerian velocities of flow from one anatomical configuration in formula_2 to another. It relates with shape statistics and morphometrics, with the distinction that diffeomorphisms are used to map coordinate systems, whose study is known as diffeomorphometry.

=== Data and modeling ===

Mathematical biology is the use of mathematical models of living organisms to examine the systems that govern structure, development, and behavior in biological systems. This entails a more theoretical approach to problems, rather than its more empirically-minded counterpart of experimental biology. Mathematical biology draws on discrete mathematics, topology (also useful for computational modeling), Bayesian statistics, linear algebra and Boolean algebra.

These mathematical approaches have enabled the creation of databases and other methods for storing, retrieving, and analyzing biological data, a field known as bioinformatics. Usually, this process involves genetics and analyzing genes.

Gathering and analyzing large datasets have made room for growing research fields such as data mining, and computational biomodeling, which refers to building computer models and visual simulations of biological systems. This allows researchers to predict how such systems will react to different environments, which is useful for determining if a system can &quot;maintain their state and functions against external and internal perturbations&quot;. While current techniques focus on small biological systems, researchers are working on approaches that will allow for larger networks to be analyzed and modeled. A majority of researchers believe this will be essential in developing modern medical approaches to creating new drugs and gene therapy. A useful modeling approach is to use Petri nets via tools such as esyN.

Along similar lines, until recent decades theoretical ecology has largely dealt with analytic models that were detached from the statistical models used by empirical ecologists. However, computational methods have aided in developing ecological theory via simulation of ecological systems, in addition to increasing application of methods from computational statistics in ecological analyses.

=== Systems biology ===
Systems biology consists of computing the interactions between various biological systems ranging from the cellular level to entire populations with the goal of discovering emergent properties. This process usually involves networking cell signaling and metabolic pathways. Systems biology often uses computational techniques from biological modeling and graph theory to study these complex interactions at cellular levels.

===Evolutionary biology===
Computational biology has assisted evolutionary biology by:
* Using DNA data to reconstruct the tree of life with computational phylogenetics
* Fitting population genetics models (either forward time or backward time) to DNA data to make inferences about demographic or selective history
* Building population genetics models of evolutionary systems from first principles in order to predict what is likely to evolve

=== Genomics ===

Computational genomics is the study of the genomes of cells and organisms. The Human Genome Project is one example of computational genomics. This project looks to sequence the entire human genome into a set of data. Once fully implemented, this could allow for doctors to analyze the genome of an individual patient. This opens the possibility of personalized medicine, prescribing treatments based on an individual&#x27;s pre-existing genetic patterns. Researchers are looking to sequence the genomes of animals, plants, bacteria, and all other types of life.

One of the main ways that genomes are compared is by sequence homology. Homology is the study of biological structures and nucleotide sequences in different organisms that come from a common ancestor. Research suggests that between 80 and 90% of genes in newly sequenced prokaryotic genomes can be identified this way.

Sequence alignment is another process for comparing and detecting similarities between biological sequences or genes. Sequence alignment is useful in a number of bioinformatics applications, such as computing the longest common subsequence of two genes or comparing variants of certain diseases.

An untouched project in computational genomics is the analysis of intergenic regions, which comprise roughly 97% of the human genome. Researchers are working to understand the functions of non-coding regions of the human genome through the development of computational and statistical methods and via large consortia projects such as ENCODE and the Roadmap Epigenomics Project.

Understanding how individual genes contribute to the biology of an organism at the molecular, cellular, and organism levels is known as gene ontology. The Gene Ontology Consortium&#x27;s mission is to develop an up-to-date, comprehensive, computational model of biological systems, from the molecular level to larger pathways, cellular, and organism-level systems. The Gene Ontology resource provides a computational representation of current scientific knowledge about the functions of genes (or, more properly, the protein and non-coding RNA molecules produced by genes) from many different organisms, from humans to bacteria.

3D genomics is a subsection in computational biology that focuses on the organization and interaction of genes within a eukaryotic cell. One method used to gather 3D genomic data is through Genome Architecture Mapping (GAM). GAM measures 3D distances of chromatin and DNA in the genome by combining cryosectioning, the process of cutting a strip from the nucleus to examine the DNA, with laser microdissection. A nuclear profile is simply this strip or slice that is taken from the nucleus. Each nuclear profile contains genomic windows, which are certain sequences of nucleotides - the base unit of DNA. GAM captures a genome network of complex, multi enhancer chromatin contacts throughout a cell.

===Neuroscience===

Computational neuroscience is the study of brain function in terms of the information processing properties of the nervous system. A subset of neuroscience, it looks to model the brain to examine specific aspects of the neurological system. Models of the brain include:
* Realistic Brain Models: These models look to represent every aspect of the brain, including as much detail at the cellular level as possible. Realistic models provide the most information about the brain, but also have the largest margin for error. More variables in a brain model create the possibility for more error to occur. These models do not account for parts of the cellular structure that scientists do not know about. Realistic brain models are the most computationally heavy and the most expensive to implement.
* Simplifying Brain Models: These models look to limit the scope of a model in order to assess a specific physical property of the neurological system. This allows for the intensive computational problems to be solved, and reduces the amount of potential error from a realistic brain model.
It is the work of computational neuroscientists to improve the algorithms and data structures currently used to increase the speed of such calculations.

Computational neuropsychiatry is an emerging field that uses mathematical and computer-assisted modeling of brain mechanisms involved in mental disorders. Several initiatives have demonstrated that computational modeling is an important contribution to understand neuronal circuits that could generate mental functions and dysfunctions.

===Pharmacology===
Computational pharmacology is &quot;the study of the effects of genomic data to find links between specific genotypes and diseases and then screening drug data&quot;. The pharmaceutical industry requires a shift in methods to analyze drug data. Pharmacologists were able to use Microsoft Excel to compare chemical and genomic data related to the effectiveness of drugs. However, the industry has reached what is referred to as the Excel barricade. This arises from the limited number of cells accessible on a spreadsheet. This development led to the need for computational pharmacology. Scientists and researchers develop computational methods to analyze these massive data sets. This allows for an efficient comparison between the notable data points and allows for more accurate drugs to be developed.

Analysts project that if major medications fail due to patents, that computational biology will be necessary to replace current drugs on the market. Doctoral students in computational biology are being encouraged to pursue careers in industry rather than take Post-Doctoral positions. This is a direct result of major pharmaceutical companies needing more qualified analysts of the large data sets required for producing new drugs.

=== Oncology ===

Computational biology plays a crucial role in discovering signs of new, previously unknown living creatures and in cancer research. This field involves large-scale measurements of cellular processes, including RNA, DNA, and proteins, which pose significant computational challenges. To overcome these, biologists rely on computational tools to accurately measure and analyze biological data. In cancer research, computational biology aids in the complex analysis of tumor samples, helping researchers develop new ways to characterize tumors and understand various cellular properties. The use of high-throughput measurements, involving millions of data points from DNA, RNA, and other biological structures, helps in diagnosing cancer at early stages and in understanding the key factors that contribute to cancer development. Areas of focus include analyzing molecules that are deterministic in causing cancer and understanding how the human genome relates to tumor causation.

=== Toxicology ===

Computational toxicology is a multidisciplinary area of study, which is employed in the early stages of drug discovery and development to predict the safety and potential toxicity of drug candidates.

== Techniques ==
Computational biologists use a wide range of software and algorithms to carry out their research.

===Unsupervised Learning===
Unsupervised learning is a type of algorithm that finds patterns in unlabeled data. One example is k-means clustering, which aims to partition &quot;n&quot; data points into &quot;k&quot; clusters, in which each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean. Another version is the k-medoids algorithm, which, when selecting a cluster center or cluster centroid, will pick one of its data points in the set, and not just an average of the cluster.

The algorithm follows these steps:
# Randomly select &quot;k&quot; distinct data points. These are the initial clusters.
# Measure the distance between each point and each of the &#x27;k&#x27; clusters. (This is the distance of the points from each point &quot;k&quot;).
# Assign each point to the nearest cluster.
# Find the center of each cluster (medoid).
# Repeat until the clusters no longer change.
# Assess the quality of the clustering by adding up the variation within each cluster.
# Repeat the processes with different values of k.
# Pick the best value for &#x27;k&#x27; by finding the &quot;elbow&quot; in the plot of which k value has the lowest variance.

One example of this in biology is used in the 3D mapping of a genome. Information of a mouse&#x27;s HIST1 region of chromosome 13 is gathered from Gene Expression Omnibus. This information contains data on which nuclear profiles show up in certain genomic regions. With this information, the Jaccard distance can be used to find a normalized distance between all the loci.

===Graph Analytics===
Graph analytics, or network analysis, is the study of graphs that represent connections between different objects. Graphs can represent all kinds of networks in biology such as protein-protein interaction networks, regulatory networks, Metabolic and biochemical networks and much more. There are many ways to analyze these networks. One of which is looking at centrality in graphs. Finding centrality in graphs assigns nodes rankings to their popularity or centrality in the graph. This can be useful in finding which nodes are most important. For example, given data on the activity of genes over a time period, degree centrality can be used to see what genes are most active throughout the network, or what genes interact with others the most throughout the network. This contributes to the understanding of the roles certain genes play in the network.

There are many ways to calculate centrality in graphs all of which can give different kinds of information on centrality. Finding centralities in biology can be applied in many different circumstances, some of which are gene regulatory, protein interaction and metabolic networks.

===Supervised Learning===
Supervised learning is a type of algorithm that learns from labeled data and learns how to assign labels to future data that is unlabeled. In biology supervised learning can be helpful when we have data that we know how to categorize and we would like to categorize more data into those categories.
A common supervised learning algorithm is the random forest, which uses numerous decision trees to train a model to classify a dataset. Forming the basis of the random forest, a decision tree is a structure which aims to classify, or label, some set of data using certain known features of that data. A practical biological example of this would be taking an individual&#x27;s genetic data and predicting whether or not that individual is predisposed to develop a certain disease or cancer. At each internal node the algorithm checks the dataset for exactly one feature, a specific gene in the previous example, and then branches left or right based on the result. Then at each leaf node, the decision tree assigns a class label to the dataset. So in practice, the algorithm walks a specific root-to-leaf path based on the input dataset through the decision tree, which results in the classification of that dataset. Commonly, decision trees have target variables that take on discrete values, like yes/no, in which case it is referred to as a classification tree, but if the target variable is continuous then it is called a regression tree. To construct a decision tree, it must first be trained using a training set to identify which features are the best predictors of the target variable.

===Open source software===
Open source software provides a platform for computational biology where everyone can access and benefit from software developed in research. PLOS cites four main reasons for the use of open source software:
* Reproducibility: This allows for researchers to use the exact methods used to calculate the relations between biological data.
* Faster development: developers and researchers do not have to reinvent existing code for minor tasks. Instead they can use pre-existing programs to save time on the development and implementation of larger projects.
* Increased quality: Having input from multiple researchers studying the same topic provides a layer of assurance that errors will not be in the code.
* Long-term availability: Open source programs are not tied to any businesses or patents. This allows for them to be posted to multiple web pages and ensure that they are available in the future.

==Research==
There are several large conferences that are concerned with computational biology. Some notable examples are Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology, European Conference on Computational Biology and Research in Computational Molecular Biology.

There are also numerous journals dedicated to computational biology. Some notable examples include Journal of Computational Biology and PLOS Computational Biology, a peer-reviewed open access journal that has many notable research projects in the field of computational biology. They provide reviews on software, tutorials for open source software, and display information on upcoming computational biology conferences. Other journals relevant to this field include Bioinformatics, Computers in Biology and Medicine, BMC Bioinformatics, Nature Methods, Nature Communications, Scientific Reports, PLOS One, etc.

==Related fields==

Computational biology, bioinformatics and mathematical biology are all interdisciplinary approaches to the life sciences that draw from quantitative disciplines such as mathematics and information science. The NIH describes computational/mathematical biology as the use of computational/mathematical approaches to address theoretical and experimental questions in biology and, by contrast, bioinformatics as the application of information science to understand complex life-sciences data.

Specifically, the NIH defines

While each field is distinct, there may be significant overlap at their interface, so much so that to many, bioinformatics and computational biology are terms that are used interchangeably.

The terms computational biology and evolutionary computation have a similar name, but are not to be confused. Unlike computational biology, evolutionary computation is not concerned with modeling and analyzing biological data. It instead creates algorithms based on the ideas of evolution across species. Sometimes referred to as genetic algorithms, the research of this field can be applied to computational biology. While evolutionary computation is not inherently a part of computational biology, computational evolutionary biology is a subfield of it.

<text>Information science is an academic field which is primarily concerned with analysis, collection, classification, manipulation, storage, retrieval, movement, dissemination, and protection of information. Practitioners within and outside the field study the application and the usage of knowledge in organizations in addition to the interaction between people, organizations, and any existing information systems with the aim of creating, replacing, improving, or understanding the information systems.

Historically, information science is associated with informatics, computer science, data science, psychology, technology, documentation science, library science, healthcare, and intelligence agencies. However, information science also incorporates aspects of diverse fields such as archival science, cognitive science, commerce, law, linguistics, museology, management, mathematics, philosophy, public policy, and social sciences.

== Foundations ==

=== Scope and approach ===
Information science focuses on understanding problems from the perspective of the stakeholders involved and then applying information and other technologies as needed. In other words, it tackles systemic problems first rather than individual pieces of technology within that system. In this respect, one can see information science as a response to technological determinism, the belief that technology &quot;develops by its own laws, that it realizes its own potential, limited only by the material resources available and the creativity of its developers. It must therefore be regarded as an autonomous system controlling and ultimately permeating all other subsystems of society.&quot;

Many universities have entire colleges, departments or schools devoted to the study of information science, while numerous information-science scholars work in disciplines such as communication, healthcare, computer science, law, and sociology. Several institutions have formed an I-School Caucus (see &quot;List of I-Schools&quot;), but numerous others besides these also have comprehensive information foci.

Within information science, current issues include:
* Human–computer interaction for science
* Groupware
* The Semantic Web
* Value sensitive design
* Iterative design processes
* The ways people generate, use and find information

===Definitions===
The first known usage of the term &quot;information science&quot; was in 1955. An early definition of Information science (going back to 1968, the year when the &quot;American Documentation Institute&quot; renamed itself as the &quot;American Society for Information Science and Technology&quot;) states:

:&quot;Information science is that discipline that investigates the properties and behavior of information, the forces governing the flow of information, and the means of processing information for optimum accessibility and usability. It is concerned with that body of knowledge relating to the origination, collection, organization, storage, retrieval, interpretation, transmission, transformation, and utilization of information. This includes the authenticity of information representations in both natural and artificial systems, the use of codes for efficient message transmission, and the study of information processing devices and techniques such as computers and their programming systems. It is an interdisciplinary science derived from and related to such fields as mathematics, logic, linguistics, psychology, computer technology, operations research, the graphic arts, communications, management, and other similar fields. It has both a pure science component, which inquires into the subject without regard to its application, and an applied science component, which develops services and products.&quot; .

====Related terms====
Some authors use informatics as a synonym for &quot;information science&quot;. This is especially true when related to the concept developed by A. I. Mikhailov and other Soviet authors in the mid-1960s. The Mikhailov school saw informatics as a discipline related to the study of scientific information.
Informatics is difficult to precisely define because of the rapidly evolving and interdisciplinary nature of the field. Definitions reliant on the nature of the tools used for deriving meaningful information from data are emerging in Informatics academic programs.

Regional differences and international terminology complicate the problem. Some people note that much of what is called &quot;Informatics&quot; today was once called &quot;Information Science&quot; – at least in fields such as Medical Informatics. For example, when library scientists also began to use the phrase &quot;Information Science&quot; to refer to their work, the term &quot;informatics&quot; emerged:
* in the United States as a response by computer scientists to distinguish their work from that of library science
* in Britain as a term for a science of information that studies natural, as well as artificial or engineered, information-processing systems

Another term discussed as a synonym for &quot;information studies&quot; is &quot;information systems&quot;. Brian Campbell Vickery&#x27;s &quot;Information Systems&quot; (1973) placed information systems within IS. , on the other hand, provided a bibliometric investigation describing the relation between two &quot;different&quot; fields: &quot;information science&quot; and &quot;information systems&quot;.

===Philosophy of information===
Philosophy of information studies conceptual issues arising at the intersection of psychology, computer science, information technology, and philosophy. It includes the investigation of the conceptual nature and basic principles of information, including its dynamics, utilisation and sciences, as well as the elaboration and application of information-theoretic and computational methodologies to its philosophical problems. Robert Hammarberg pointed out that there is no coherent distinction between information and data: &quot;an Information Processing System (IPS) cannot process data except in terms of whatever representational language is inherent to it, [so] data could not even be apprehended by an IPS without becoming representational in nature, and thus losing their status of being raw, brute, facts.&quot;&quot;

=== Ontology ===
In science and information science, an ontology formally represents knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain, and the relationships between those concepts. It can be used to reason about the entities within that domain and may be used to describe the domain.

More specifically, an ontology is a model for describing the world that consists of a set of types, properties, and relationship types. Exactly what is provided around these varies, but they are the essentials of an ontology. There is also generally an expectation that there be a close resemblance between the real world and the features of the model in an ontology.

In theory, an ontology is a &quot;formal, explicit specification of a shared conceptualisation&quot;. An ontology renders shared vocabulary and taxonomy which models a domain with the definition of objects and/or concepts and their properties and relations.

Ontologies are the structural frameworks for organizing information and are used in artificial intelligence, the Semantic Web, systems engineering, software engineering, biomedical informatics, library science, enterprise bookmarking, and information architecture as a form of knowledge representation about the world or some part of it. The creation of domain ontologies is also essential to the definition and use of an enterprise architecture framework.

=== Science or discipline?===

Authors such as Ingwersen argue that informatology has problems defining its own boundaries with other disciplines. According to Popper &quot;Information science operates busily on an ocean of commonsense practical applications, which increasingly involve the computer ... and on commonsense views of language, of communication, of knowledge and Information, computer science is in little better state&quot;. Other authors, such as Furner, deny that information science is a true science.

== Careers ==

=== Information scientist ===
An information scientist is an individual, usually with a relevant subject degree or high level of subject knowledge, who provides focused information to scientific and technical research staff in industry or to subject faculty and students in academia. The industry *information specialist/scientist* and the academic information subject specialist/librarian have, in general, similar subject background training, but the academic position holder will be required to hold a second advanced degree—e.g. Master of Library Science (MLS), Military Intelligence (MI), Master of Arts (MA)—in information and library studies in addition to a subject master&#x27;s. The title also applies to an individual carrying out research in information science.

=== Systems analyst ===
A systems analyst works on creating, designing, and improving information systems for a specific need. Often systems analysts work with one or more businesses to evaluate and implement organizational processes and techniques for accessing information in order to improve efficiency and productivity within the organization(s).

=== Information professional ===
An information professional is an individual who preserves, organizes, and disseminates information. Information professionals are skilled in the organization and retrieval of recorded knowledge. Traditionally, their work has been with print materials, but these skills are being increasingly used with electronic, visual, audio, and digital materials. Information professionals work in a variety of public, private, non-profit, and academic institutions. Information professionals can also be found within organisational and industrial contexts, and are performing roles that include system design and development and system analysis.

==History==
===Early beginnings===

Information science, in studying the collection, classification, manipulation, storage, retrieval and dissemination of information has origins in the common stock of human knowledge. Information analysis has been carried out by scholars at least as early as the time of the Assyrian Empire with the emergence of cultural depositories, what is today known as libraries and archives. Institutionally, information science emerged in the 19th century along with many other social science disciplines. As a science, however, it finds its institutional roots in the history of science, beginning with publication of the first issues of &quot;Philosophical Transactions,&quot; generally considered the first scientific journal, in 1665 by the Royal Society (London).

The institutionalization of science occurred throughout the 18th century. In 1731, Benjamin Franklin established the Library Company of Philadelphia, the first library owned by a group of public citizens, which quickly expanded beyond the realm of books and became a center of scientific experimentation, and which hosted public exhibitions of scientific experiments. Benjamin Franklin invested a town in Massachusetts with a collection of books that the town voted to make available to all free of charge, forming the first public library of the United States. Academie de Chirurgia (Paris) published &quot;Memoires pour les Chirurgiens&quot;, generally considered to be the first medical journal, in 1736. The American Philosophical Society, patterned on the Royal Society (London), was founded in Philadelphia in 1743. As numerous other scientific journals and societies were founded, Alois Senefelder developed the concept of lithography for use in mass printing work in Germany in 1796.

===19th century===

By the 19th century the first signs of information science emerged as separate and distinct from other sciences and social sciences but in conjunction with communication and computation. In 1801, Joseph Marie Jacquard invented a punched card system to control operations of the cloth weaving loom in France. It was the first use of &quot;memory storage of patterns&quot; system. As chemistry journals emerged throughout the 1820s and 1830s, Charles Babbage developed his &quot;difference engine&quot;, the first step towards the modern computer, in 1822 and his &quot;analytical engine&quot; by 1834. By 1843 Richard Hoe developed the rotary press, and in 1844 Samuel Morse sent the first public telegraph message. By 1848 William F. Poole begins the &quot;Index to Periodical Literature,&quot; the first general periodical literature index in the US.

In 1854 George Boole published &quot;An Investigation into Laws of Thought...,&quot; which lays the foundations for Boolean algebra, which is later used in information retrieval. In 1860 a congress was held at Karlsruhe Technische Hochschule to discuss the feasibility of establishing a systematic and rational nomenclature for chemistry. The congress did not reach any conclusive results, but several key participants returned home with Stanislao Cannizzaro&#x27;s outline (1858), which ultimately convinces them of the validity of his scheme for calculating atomic weights.

By 1865, the Smithsonian Institution began a catalog of current scientific papers, which became the &quot;International Catalogue of Scientific Papers&quot; in 1902. The following year the Royal Society began publication of its &quot;Catalogue of Papers&quot; in London. In 1868, Christopher Sholes, Carlos Glidden, and S. W. Soule produced the first practical typewriter. By 1872 Lord Kelvin devised an analogue computer to predict the tides, and by 1875 Frank Stephen Baldwin was granted the first US patent for a practical calculating machine that performs four arithmetic functions. Alexander Graham Bell and Thomas Edison invented the telephone and phonograph in 1876 and 1877 respectively, and the American Library Association was founded in Philadelphia. In 1879 &quot;Index Medicus&quot; was first issued by the Library of the Surgeon General, U.S. Army, with John Shaw Billings as librarian, and later the library issues &quot;Index Catalogue,&quot; which achieved an international reputation as the most complete catalog of medical literature.

===European documentation===

The discipline of &quot;documentation science&quot;, which marks the earliest theoretical foundations of modern information science, emerged in the late part of the 19th century in Europe together with several more scientific indexes whose purpose was to organize scholarly literature. Many information science historians cite Paul Otlet and Henri La Fontaine as the fathers of information science with the founding of the International Institute of Bibliography (IIB) in 1895. A second generation of European Documentalists emerged after the Second World War, most notably Suzanne Briet. However, &quot;information science&quot; as a term is not popularly used in academia until sometime in the latter part of the 20th century.

Documentalists emphasized the utilitarian integration of technology and technique toward specific social goals. According to Ronald Day, &quot;As an organized system of techniques and technologies, documentation was understood as a player in the historical development of global organization in modernity – indeed, a major player inasmuch as that organization was dependent on the organization and transmission of information.&quot; Otlet and Lafontaine (who won the Nobel Prize in 1913) not only envisioned later technical innovations but also projected a global vision for information and information technologies that speaks directly to postwar visions of a global &quot;information society&quot;. Otlet and Lafontaine established numerous organizations dedicated to standardization, bibliography, international associations, and consequently, international cooperation. These organizations were fundamental for ensuring international production in commerce, information, communication and modern economic development, and they later found their global form in such institutions as the League of Nations and the United Nations. Otlet designed the Universal Decimal Classification, based on Melville Dewey&#x27;s decimal classification system.

Although he lived decades before computers and networks emerged, what he discussed prefigured what ultimately became the World Wide Web. His vision of a great network of knowledge focused on documents and included the notions of hyperlinks, search engines, remote access, and social networks.

Otlet not only imagined that all the world&#x27;s knowledge should be interlinked and made available remotely to anyone, but he also proceeded to build a structured document collection. This collection involved standardized paper sheets and cards filed in custom-designed cabinets according to a hierarchical index (which culled information worldwide from diverse sources) and a commercial information retrieval service (which answered written requests by copying relevant information from index cards). Users of this service were even warned if their query was likely to produce more than 50 results per search.
By 1937 documentation had formally been institutionalized, as evidenced by the founding of the American Documentation Institute (ADI), later called the American Society for Information Science and Technology.

===Transition to modern information science===

With the 1950s came increasing awareness of the potential of automatic devices for literature searching and information storage and retrieval. As these concepts grew in magnitude and potential, so did the variety of information science interests. By the 1960s and 70s, there was a move from batch processing to online modes, from mainframe to mini and microcomputers. Additionally, traditional boundaries among disciplines began to fade and many information science scholars joined with other programs. They further made themselves multidisciplinary by incorporating disciplines in the sciences, humanities and social sciences, as well as other professional programs, such as law and medicine in their curriculum.

Among the individuals who had distinct opportunities to facilitate interdisciplinary activity targeted at scientific communication was Foster E. Mohrhardt, director of the National Agricultural Library from 1954 to 1968.

By the 1980s, large databases, such as Grateful Med at the National Library of Medicine, and user-oriented services such as Dialog and Compuserve, were for the first time accessible by individuals from their personal computers. The 1980s also saw the emergence of numerous special interest groups to respond to the changes. By the end of the decade, special interest groups were available involving non-print media, social sciences, energy and the environment, and community information systems. Today, information science largely examines technical bases, social consequences, and theoretical understanding of online databases, widespread use of databases in government, industry, and education, and the development of the Internet and World Wide Web.

== Information dissemination in the 21st century ==

===Changing definition===
Dissemination has historically been interpreted as unilateral communication of information. With the advent of the internet, and the explosion in popularity of online communities, social media has changed the information landscape in many respects, and creates both new modes of communication and new types of information&quot;, changing the interpretation of the definition of dissemination. The nature of social networks allows for faster diffusion of information than through organizational sources. The internet has changed the way we view, use, create, and store information; now it is time to re-evaluate the way we share and spread it.

===Impact of social media on people and industry===

Social media networks provide an open information environment for the mass of people who have limited time or access to traditional outlets of information diffusion, this is an &quot;increasingly mobile and social world [that] demands...new types of information skills&quot;. Social media integration as an access point is a very useful and mutually beneficial tool for users and providers. All major news providers have visibility and an access point through networks such as Facebook and Twitter maximizing their breadth of audience. Through social media people are directed to, or provided with, information by people they know. The ability to &quot;share, like, and comment on...content&quot; increases the reach farther and wider than traditional methods. People like to interact with information, they enjoy including the people they know in their circle of knowledge. Sharing through social media has become so influential that publishers must &quot;play nice&quot; if they desire to succeed. Although, it is often mutually beneficial for publishers and Facebook to &quot;share, promote and uncover new content&quot; to improve both user base experiences. The impact of popular opinion can spread in unimaginable ways. Social media allows interaction through simple to learn and access tools; &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; offers an app through Facebook, and &quot;The Washington Post&quot; goes a step further and offers an independent social app that was downloaded by 19.5 million users in six months, proving how interested people are in the new way of being provided information.

===Social media&#x27;s power to facilitate topics===

The connections and networks sustained through social media help information providers learn what is important to people. The connections people have throughout the world enable the exchange of information at an unprecedented rate. It is for this reason that these networks have been realized for the potential they provide. &quot;Most news media monitor Twitter for breaking news&quot;, as well as news anchors frequently request the audience to tweet pictures of events. The users and viewers of the shared information have earned &quot;opinion-making and agenda-setting power&quot; This channel has been recognized for the usefulness of providing targeted information based on public demand.

== Research sectors and applications ==

The following areas are some of those that information science investigates and develops.

===Information access===
Information access is an area of research at the intersection of Informatics, Information Science, Information Security, Language Technology, and Computer Science. The objectives of information access research are to automate the processing of large and unwieldy amounts of information and to simplify users&#x27; access to it. What about assigning privileges and restricting access to unauthorized users? The extent of access should be defined in the level of clearance granted for the information. Applicable technologies include information retrieval, text mining, text editing, machine translation, and text categorisation. In discussion, information access is often defined as concerning the insurance of free and closed or public access to information and is brought up in discussions on copyright, patent law, and public domain. Public libraries need resources to provide knowledge of information assurance.

===Information architecture===
Information architecture (IA) is the art and science of organizing and labelling websites, intranets, online communities and software to support usability. It is an emerging discipline and &quot;community of practice&quot; focused on bringing together principles of design and architecture to the &quot;digital landscape&quot;. Typically it involves a model or concept of information which is used and applied to activities that require explicit details of complex information systems. These activities include library systems and database development.

===Information management===
Information management (IM) is the collection and management of information from one or more sources and the distribution of that information to one or more audiences. This sometimes involves those who have a stake in, or a right to that information. Management means the organization of and control over the structure, processing and delivery of information. Throughout the 1970s this was largely limited to files, file maintenance, and the life cycle management of paper-based files, other media and records. With the proliferation of information technology starting in the 1970s, the job of information management took on a new light and also began to include the field of data maintenance.

===Information retrieval===
Information retrieval (IR) is the area of study concerned with searching for documents, for information within documents, and for metadata about documents, as well as that of searching structured storage, relational databases, and the World Wide Web. Automated information retrieval systems are used to reduce what has been called &quot;information overload&quot;. Many universities and public libraries use IR systems to provide access to books, journals and other documents. Web search engines are the most visible IR applications.

An information retrieval process begins when a user enters a query into the system. Queries are formal statements of information needs, for example search strings in web search engines. In information retrieval a query does not uniquely identify a single object in the collection. Instead, several objects may match the query, perhaps with different degrees of relevancy.

An object is an entity that is represented by information in a database. User queries are matched against the database information. Depending on the application the data objects may be, for example, text documents, images, audio, mind maps or videos. Often the documents themselves are not kept or stored directly in the IR system, but are instead represented in the system by document surrogates or metadata.

Most IR systems compute a numeric score on how well each object in the database match the query, and rank the objects according to this value. The top ranking objects are then shown to the user. The process may then be iterated if the user wishes to refine the query.

===Information seeking===
Information seeking is the process or activity of attempting to obtain information in both human and technological contexts. Information seeking is related to, but different from, information retrieval (IR).

Much library and information science (LIS) research has focused on the information-seeking practices of practitioners within various fields of professional work. Studies have been carried out into the information-seeking behaviors of librarians, academics, medical professionals, engineers and lawyers (among others). Much of this research has drawn on the work done by Leckie, Pettigrew (now Fisher) and Sylvain, who in 1996 conducted an extensive review of the LIS literature (as well as the literature of other academic fields) on professionals&#x27; information seeking. The authors proposed an analytic model of professionals&#x27; information seeking behaviour, intended to be generalizable across the professions, thus providing a platform for future research in the area. The model was intended to &quot;prompt new insights... and give rise to more refined and applicable theories of information seeking&quot; . The model has been adapted by who proposes a model of the information seeking of lawyers. Recent studies in this topic address the concept of information-gathering that &quot;provides a broader perspective that adheres better to professionals&#x27; work-related reality and desired skills.&quot; .

===Information society===
An information society is a society where the creation, distribution, diffusion, uses, integration and manipulation of information is a significant economic, political, and cultural activity. The aim of an information society is to gain competitive advantage internationally, through using IT in a creative and productive way. The knowledge economy is its economic counterpart, whereby wealth is created through the economic exploitation of understanding. People who have the means to partake in this form of society are sometimes called digital citizens.

Basically, an information society is the means of getting information from one place to another . As technology has become more advanced over time so too has the way we have adapted in sharing this information with each other.

Information society theory discusses the role of information and information technology in society, the question of which key concepts should be used for characterizing contemporary society, and how to define such concepts. It has become a specific branch of contemporary sociology.

=== Knowledge representation and reasoning ===
Knowledge representation (KR) is an area of artificial intelligence research aimed at representing knowledge in symbols to facilitate inferencing from those knowledge elements, creating new elements of knowledge. The KR can be made to be independent of the underlying knowledge model or knowledge base system (KBS) such as a semantic network.

Knowledge Representation (KR) research involves analysis of how to reason accurately and effectively and how best to use a set of symbols to represent a set of facts within a knowledge domain. A symbol vocabulary and a system of logic are combined to enable inferences about elements in the KR to create new KR sentences. Logic is used to supply formal semantics of how reasoning functions should be applied to the symbols in the KR system. Logic is also used to define how operators can process and reshape the knowledge. Examples of operators and operations include, negation, conjunction, adverbs, adjectives, quantifiers and modal operators. The logic is interpretation theory. These elements—symbols, operators, and interpretation theory—are what give sequences of symbols meaning within a KR.

<text>Dorothea Lynde Dix (April 4, 1802July 17, 1887) was an American advocate on behalf of the indigent mentally ill who, through a vigorous and sustained program of lobbying state legislatures and the United States Congress, created the first generation of American mental asylums. During the Civil War, she served as a Superintendent of Army Nurses.

==Early life==
Born in the town of Hampden in the District of Maine, she grew up in Worcester, Massachusetts, among her parents&#x27; relatives. She was the first child of three born to Joseph Dix and Mary Bigelow, who had deep ancestral roots in Massachusetts Bay Colony. Her mother suffered from poor health, thus she wasn&#x27;t able to provide consistent support to her children. Her father was an itinerant bookseller and Methodist preacher. At the age of twelve, she and her two brothers were sent to their wealthy grandmother, Dorothea Lynde (married to Dr. Elijah Dix) in Boston to get away from her alcoholic parents and abusive father. She began to teach in a school all for girls in Worcester, Massachusetts at fourteen years old and had developed her own curriculum for her class, in which she emphasized ethical living and the natural sciences. In about 1821 Dix opened a school in Boston, which was patronized by well-to-do families. Soon afterward she also began teaching poor and neglected children out of the barn of her grandmother&#x27;s house, but she suffered poor health. It has been suggested that Dorothea suffered from major depressive episodes, which contributed to her poor health. From 1824 to 1830, she wrote mainly devotional books and stories for children. Her &quot;Conversations on Common Things&quot; (1824) reached its sixtieth edition by 1869, and was reprinted 60 times and written in the style of a conversation between mother and daughter. Her book &quot;The Garland of Flora&quot; (1829) was, along with Elizabeth Wirt&#x27;s &quot;Flora&#x27;s Dictionary&quot;, one of the first two dictionaries of flowers published in the United States. Other books of Dix&#x27;s include &quot;Private Hours, Alice and Ruth,&quot; and &quot;Prisons and Prison Discipline.&quot;

Although raised Catholic and later directed to Congregationalism, Dix became a Unitarian.
After Dix&#x27;s health forced her to relinquish her school, she began working as a governess on Beacon Hill for the family of William Ellery Channing, a leading Unitarian intellectual. It was while working with his family that Dix traveled to St. Croix, where she first witnessed slavery at first hand, though her experience did not dispose her sympathies toward abolitionism. In 1831, she established a model school for girls in Boston, operating it until 1836, when she suffered a breakdown. Dix was encouraged to take a trip to Europe to improve her health. While she was there she met British social reformers who inspired her. These reformers included Elizabeth Fry, Samuel Tuke and William Rathbone with whom she lived during the duration of her trip in Europe. In hopes of a cure, in 1836 she traveled to England, where she met the Rathbone family. During her trip in Europe and her stay with the Rathbone family, Dorothea&#x27;s grandmother died and left her a &quot;sizable estate, along with her royalties&quot; which allowed her to live comfortably for the remainder of her life. It was also during this trip that she came across an institution in Turkey, which she used as a model institution despite its conditions being just like other facilities. The Rathbones were Quakers and prominent social reformers. They invited her as a guest to Greenbank, their ancestral mansion in Liverpool. At Greenbank, Dix met their circle of men and women who believed that government should play a direct, active role in social welfare. She was also introduced to Great Britain&#x27;s reform movement for care of the mentally ill, known as lunacy reform. Its members were making deep investigations of madhouses and asylums, publishing their studies in reports to the House of Commons.

==Antebellum career==
Reform movements for treatment of the mentally ill were related in this period to other progressive causes: abolitionism, temperance, and voter reforms. After returning to America, in 1840–41 Dix conducted a statewide investigation of care for the mentally ill poor in Massachusetts. Dorothea&#x27;s interest for helping out the mentally ill of society started while she was teaching classes to female prisoners in East Cambridge. She saw how these individuals were locked up and whose medical needs weren&#x27;t being satisfied since only private hospitals would have such provisions. It was during her time at the East Cambridge prison, that she visited the basement where she encountered four mentally ill individuals, whose cells were &quot;dark and bare and the air was stagnant and foul&quot;. She also saw how such individuals were labeled as &quot;looney paupers&quot; and were being locked up along with violently deranged criminals and received treatment that was inhumane.

In most cases, towns contracted with local individuals to care for mentally ill people who could not care for themselves and lacked family/friends to do so. Unregulated and underfunded, this system resulted in widespread abuse. Dix published the results in a fiery report, a &quot;Memorial&quot;, to the state legislature. &quot;I proceed, Gentlemen, briefly to call your attention to the present state of Insane Persons confined within this Commonwealth, in cages, stalls, pens! Chained, naked, beaten with rods, and lashed into obedience.&quot; Her lobbying resulted in a bill to expand the state&#x27;s mental hospital in Worcester.

During the year 1844 Dix visited all the counties, jails and almshouses in New Jersey in a similar investigation. She prepared a memorial for the New Jersey Legislature, giving a detailed account of her observations and facts. Dix urgently appealed to the legislature to act and appropriate funds to construct a facility for the care and treatment of the mentally ill. She cited a number of cases to emphasize the importance of the state taking responsibility for this class of unfortunates. Dix&#x27;s plea was to provide moral treatment for the mentally ill, which consisted of three values: modesty, chastity, and delicacy.

She gave as an example a man formerly respected as a legislator and jurist, who, suffering from mental decline, fell into hard times in old age. Dix discovered him lying on a small bed in a basement room of the county almshouse, bereft of even necessary comforts. She wrote: &quot;This feeble and depressed old man, a pauper, helpless, lonely, and yet conscious of surrounding circumstances, and not now wholly oblivious of the past—this feeble old man, who was he?&quot; Many members of the legislature knew her pauper jurist. Joseph S. Dodd introduced her report to the Senate on January 23, 1845.

Dodd&#x27;s resolution to authorize an asylum passed the following day. The first committee made their report February 25, appealing to the New Jersey legislature to act at once. Some politicians secretly opposed it due to taxes needed to support it. Dix continued to lobby for a facility, writing letters and editorials to build support. During the session, she met with legislators and held group meetings in the evening at home. The act of authorization was taken up March 14, 1845, and read for the last time. On March 25, 1845, the bill was passed for the establishment of a state facility.

Dix traveled from New Hampshire to Louisiana, documenting the condition of the poor mentally ill, making reports to state legislatures, and working with committees to draft the enabling legislation and appropriations bills needed. In 1846, Dix traveled to Illinois to study mental illness. While there, she fell ill and spent the winter in Springfield recovering. She submitted a report to the January 1847 legislative session, which adopted legislation to establish Illinois&#x27; first state mental hospital.

In 1848, Dix visited North Carolina, where she again called for reform in the care of mentally ill patients. Her first attempt to bring reform to North Carolina was denied. However, after a board member&#x27;s wife requested, as a dying wish, that Dix&#x27;s plea be reconsidered, the bill for reform was approved. In 1849, when the (North Carolina) State Medical Society was formed, the legislature authorized construction of an institution in the capital, Raleigh, for the care of mentally ill patients. Dix Hill Asylum, named in honor of Dorothea Dix&#x27;s father, was eventually opened in 1856. One hundred years later, the Dix Hill Asylum was renamed the Dorothea Dix Hospital, in honor of her legacy. A second state hospital for the mentally ill was authorized in 1875, Broughton State Hospital in Morganton, North Carolina; and ultimately, the Goldsboro Hospital for the Negro Insane was also built in eastern part of the state. Dix had a biased view that mental illness was related to conditions of educated whites, not minorities (Dix, 1847).
She was instrumental in the founding of the first public mental hospital in Pennsylvania, the Harrisburg State Hospital. In 1853, she established its library and reading room.

The high point of her work in Washington was the Bill for the Benefit of the Indigent Insane, legislation to set aside of Federal land to be used for the benefit of the mentally ill and the remainder for the &quot;blind, deaf, and dumb&quot;. Proceeds from its sale would be distributed to the states to build and maintain asylums. Dix&#x27;s land bill passed both houses of the United States Congress; but in 1854, President Franklin Pierce vetoed it, arguing that social welfare was the responsibility of the states. Stung by the defeat of her land bill, in 1854 and 1855 Dix traveled to England and Europe. She reconnected with the Rathbone family and, encouraged by British politicians who wished to increase Whitehall&#x27;s reach into Scotland, conducted investigations of Scotland&#x27;s madhouses. This work resulted in the formation of the Scottish Lunacy Commission to oversee reforms.

Dix visited the British colony of Nova Scotia in 1853 to study its care of the mentally ill. During her visit, she traveled to Sable Island to investigate reports of mentally ill patients being abandoned there. Such reports were largely unfounded. While on Sable Island, Dix assisted in a shipwreck rescue. Upon her return to Boston, she led a successful campaign to send upgraded life-saving equipment to the island. The day after supplies arrived, a ship was wrecked on the island. Thankfully, because of Dix&#x27;s work, 180 people were saved.

In 1854, Dix investigated the conditions of mental hospitals in Scotland, and found them to be in similarly poor conditions. In 1857, after years of work and opposition, reform laws were finally passed. Dix took up a similar project in the Channel Islands, finally managing the building of an asylum after thirteen years of agitation. Extending her work throughout Europe, Dix continued on to Rome. Once again finding disrepair and maltreatment, Dix sought an audience with Pope Pius IX. The pope was receptive to Dix&#x27;s findings and visited the asylums himself, shocked at their conditions. He thanked Dix for her work, saying in a second audience with her that &quot;a woman and a Protestant, had crossed the seas to call his attention to these cruelly ill-treated members of his flock.&quot;

==The Civil War==
During the American Civil War, Dix, on June 10, 1861, was appointed Superintendent of Army Nurses by the Union Army, beating out Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell.

Dix set guidelines for nurse candidates. Volunteers were to be aged 35 to 50 and plain-looking. They were required to wear unhooped black or brown dresses, with no jewelry or cosmetics. Dix wanted to avoid sending vulnerable, attractive young women into the hospitals, where she feared they would be exploited by the men (doctors as well as patients). Dix often fired volunteer nurses she hadn&#x27;t personally trained or hired (earning the ire of supporting groups like the United States Sanitary Commission).

At odds with Army doctors, Dix feuded with them over control of medical facilities and the hiring and firing of nurses. Many doctors and surgeons did not want any female nurses in their hospitals. To solve the impasse, the War Department introduced Order No. 351 in October 1863. It granted both the Surgeon General (Joseph K. Barnes) and the Superintendent of Army Nurses (Dix) the power to appoint female nurses. However, it gave doctors the power of assigning employees and volunteers to hospitals. This relieved Dix of direct operational responsibility. As superintendent, Dix implemented the Federal army nursing program, in which over 3,000 women would eventually serve. Meanwhile, her influence was being eclipsed by other prominent women such as Dr. Mary Edwards Walker and Clara Barton. She resigned in August 1865 and later considered this &quot;episode&quot; in her career a failure. Although hundreds of Catholic nuns successfully served as nurses, Dix distrusted them; her anti-Catholicism undermined her ability to work with Catholic nurses, lay or religious.

Her even-handed caring for Union and Confederate wounded alike assured her memory in the South. Her nurses provided what was often the only care available in the field to Confederate wounded. Georgeanna Woolsey, a Dix nurse, said, &quot;The surgeon in charge of our camp ... looked after all their wounds, which were often in a most shocking state, particularly among the rebels. Every evening and morning they were dressed.&quot; Another Dix nurse, Julia Susan Wheelock, said, &quot;Many of these were Rebels. I could not pass them by neglected. Though enemies, they were nevertheless helpless, suffering human beings.&quot;

When Confederate forces retreated from Gettysburg, they left behind 5,000 wounded soldiers. These were treated by many of Dix&#x27;s nurses. Union nurse Cornelia Hancock wrote about the experience: &quot;There are no words in the English language to express the suffering I witnessed today ...&quot;.

She was well respected for her work throughout the war because of her dedication. This stemmed from her putting aside her previous work to focus completely on the war at hand. With the conclusion of the war her service was recognized formally. She was awarded with two national flags, these flags being for &quot;the Care, Succor, and Relief of the Sick and wounded Soldiers of the United States on the Battle-Field, in Camps and Hospitals during the recent war.&quot; Dix ultimately founded thirty-two hospitals, and influenced the creation of two others in Japan.

==Postwar life==
At the end of the war, Dix helped raise funds for the national monument to deceased soldiers at Fortress Monroe. Following the war, she resumed her crusade to improve the care of prisoners, the disabled, and the mentally ill. Her first step was to review the asylums and prisons in the South to evaluate the war damage to their facilities. In addition to pursuing prisons reforms after the civil war, she also worked on improving life-saving services in Nova Scotia, establishing a war memorial at Hampton Roads in Virginia and a fountain for thirsty horses at the Boston Custom Square.

In 1881, Dix moved into the New Jersey State Hospital, formerly known as Trenton State Hospital, that she built years prior. The state legislature had designated a suite for her private use as long as she lived. Although in poor health, she carried on correspondence with people from England, Japan, and elsewhere. Dix died on July 17, 1887. She was buried in Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

==Honors==
* Dix was elected &quot;President for Life&quot; of the Army Nurses Association (a social club for Civil War Volunteer Nurses), but she had little to do with the organization. She opposed its efforts to get military pensions for its members.
* In December 1866 she was awarded two national flags for her service during the Civil War. This award was awarded for &quot;the Care, Succor, and Relief of the Sick and wounded Soldiers of the United States on the Battle-Field, in Camps and Hospitals during the recent War.&quot;
* In 1979 she was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame.
* In 1983 the United States Postal Service honored her life of charity and service by issuing a 1¢ Dorothea Dix Great Americans series postage stamp.

<doc id="149356" wikidata="Q158056" url="?curid=149356" title="Nam June Paik">
<text>Nam June Paik (; July 20, 1932 – January 29, 2006) was a South Korean artist. He worked with a variety of media and is considered to be the founder of video art. He is credited with the first use (1974) of the term &quot;electronic super highway&quot; to describe the future of telecommunications.

Born in Seoul to a wealthy business family, Paik trained as a classical musician, spending time in Japan and West Germany, where he joined the Fluxus collective and developed a friendship with experimental composer John Cage. He moved to New York City in 1964 and began working with cellist Charlotte Moorman to create performance art. Soon after, he began to incorporate televisions and video tape recorders into his work, acquiring growing fame. A stroke in 1996 left him partially paralyzed for the last decade of his life.

==Early life and education==
Paik was born in Keijō (Seoul), Korea, Empire of Japan in 1932. He was the youngest of three brothers and two sisters. His , who in 2002 was revealed to be a Korean who collaborated with the Japanese during the latter&#x27;s occupation of Korea, owned a major textile manufacturing firm. As he was growing up, he was trained as a classical pianist. By virtue of his affluent background, Paik received an elite education in modern (largely Western) music through his tutors.

In 1950, during the Korean War, Paik and his family fled from their home in Korea, first fleeing to Hong Kong, but later moved to Japan. Paik graduated with a BA in aesthetics from the University of Tokyo in 1956, where he wrote a thesis on the composer Arnold Schoenberg.

Paik then moved to West Germany in 1957 to study music history with composer Thrasybulos Georgiades at Munich University. While studying in Germany, Paik met the composers Karlheinz Stockhausen and John Cage and the conceptual artists Sharon Grace, George Maciunas, Joseph Beuys, and Wolf Vostell.
==Career==
In 1961, Paik returned to Tokyo to explore the country&#x27;s advanced technologies. While living in Japan between 1962 and 1963, Paik first acquired a Sony Portapak, the first commercially available video recorder, perhaps by virtue of his close friendship with Nobuyuki Idei, who was an executive at (and later president of) the Sony corporation.

From 1962, Paik was a member of the experimental art movement Fluxus.

In 1964, Paik immigrated to the United States of America and began living in New York City, where he began working with classical cellist Charlotte Moorman, to combine his video, music, and performance.
From 1979 to 1996 Paik was professor at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf.

After nearly 35 years of being exiled from his motherland of Korea, Paik returned to South Korea on June 22, 1984. From the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, Paik played an integral role in Korea&#x27;s art scene. As the curator Lee Sooyon has argued, Paik became more than just an illustrious visitor to Korea, he became the leader who helped open Korea&#x27;s art scene to the broader international art world.

He opened solo exhibitions in Korea and mounted two world-wide broadcast projects for the 1986 Asia Games and the 1988 Olympics, both hosted in Seoul, and organized a number of exhibitions in Korea. Some exhibitions coordinated by Paik introduced John Cage, Merce Cunningham, and Joseph Beuys to Korea&#x27;s art scene; others brought recent developments in video art and interactivity from Europe and the U.S. to Korea, in ways that bridged similar activities in Korea&#x27;s art scene. Paik was also involved in bringing the 1993 Whitney Biennial to Seoul, as well as in founding the Gwangju Biennale and establishing the Korea Pavilion at the Venice Biennale.

Beginning with his artistic career in Germany in the 1960s—and on through his immigration to the U.S., later involvement in South Korea&#x27;s art scene, and broader participation in international artistic currents—Paik&#x27;s transnational path informed both his identity and his artistic practice in complex ways. At the outset of his career in Europe, Paik declared, &quot;The yellow peril! C&#x27;est moi,&quot; in a 1964 pamphlet, a reference to his Asian identity that, as the curators June Yap and Lee Soo-yon have noted, appropriates a xenophobic phrase coined by Kaiser Wilhelm II as Paik referenced his Asian identity.

Curator John Hanhardt observed that certain works recall Paik&#x27;s lived experience of transnational immigration from South Korea to Japan, Germany, and on the U.S.; one example is &quot;Guadalcanal Requiem&quot; (1977), which invokes &quot;the history and memories of World War II in the Pacific.&quot; Hanhardt has also concluded that—though &quot;no single story&quot; of Nam June Paik can capture the complexity of who he was and the places that shaped him—as Paik grew in public, transcultural, and global recognition, he held onto the significance of his birthplace in Korea. Similarly, the curator Lee Sook-kyung has called identifying what is Korea, Japanese, American, or German about Nam June Paik to be a &quot;futile&quot; effort, yet she has observed that Paik consistently emphasized his Korean heritage and &quot;Mongolian&quot; lineages.

==Works==

Nam June Paik then began participating in the Neo-Dada art movement, known as Fluxus, which was inspired by the composer John Cage and his use of everyday sounds and noises in his music. He made his big debut in 1963 at an exhibition known as &quot;Exposition of Music-Electronic Television&quot; at the Galerie Parnass in Wuppertal in which he scattered televisions everywhere and used magnets to alter or distort their images. In a 1960 piano performance in Cologne, he played Chopin, threw himself on the piano and rushed into the audience, attacking Cage and pianist David Tudor by cutting their clothes with scissors and dumping shampoo on their heads.

Cage suggested Paik look into Zen Buddhism. Though Paik was already well familiar with Buddhism from his childhood in Korea and Japan, Cage&#x27;s interest in Zen philosophy compelled Paik to re-examine his own intellectual and cultural foundation.

During 1963 and 1964 the engineers Hideo Uchida and Shuya Abe showed Paik how to interfere with the flow of electrons in color TV sets, work that led to the Abe-Paik video synthesizer, a key element in his future TV work.

In 1965, Paik acquired a Sony TCV-2010, a combination unit that contained the first consumer-market video-tape recorder CV-2000. Paik used this VTR to record television broadcasts, frequently manipulating the qualities of the broadcast, and the magnetic tape in process. In 1967 Sony introduced the first truly portable VTR, which featured a portable power supply and handheld camera, the Sony Portapak. With this, Paik could both move and record things, for it was the first portable video and audio recorder. From there, Paik became an international celebrity, known for his creative and entertaining works.

In a notorious 1967 incident, Moorman was arrested for going topless while performing in Paik&#x27;s &quot;Opera Sextronique&quot;. Two years later, in 1969, they performed &quot;TV Bra for Living Sculpture&quot;, in which Moorman wore a bra with small TV screens over her breasts. Throughout this period it was Paik&#x27;s goal to bring music up to speed with art and literature, and make sex an acceptable theme. One of his Fluxus concept works (&quot;Playable Pieces&quot;) instructs the performer to &quot;Creep into the Vagina of a living Whale.&quot; Of the &quot;Playable Pieces,&quot; the only one actually to have been performed was by Fluxus composer Joseph Byrd (&quot;Cut your left forearm a distance of ten centimeters.&quot;) in 1964 at UCLA&#x27;s New Music Workshop.

In 1971, Paik and Moorman made &quot;TV Cello&quot;, a cello formed out of three television sets stacked up on top of each other and some cello strings. During Moorman&#x27;s performance with the object, she drew her bow across the &quot;cello,&quot; as images of her and other cellists playing appeared on the screens. Paik and Moorman created another TV Cello in 1976 as a Kaldor Public Art Project in Sydney, Australia.

In 1974 Nam June Paik used the term &quot;super highway&quot; in application to telecommunications, which gave rise to the opinion that he may have been the author of the phrase &quot;Information Superhighway&quot;. In fact, in his 1974 proposal &quot;Media Planning for the Postindustrial Society – The 21st Century is now only 26 years away&quot; to the Rockefeller Foundation he used a slightly different phrase, &quot;electronic super highway&quot;:
&quot;The building of new electronic super highways will become an even huger enterprise. Assuming we connect New York with Los Angeles by means of an electronic telecommunication network that operates in strong transmission ranges, as well as with continental satellites, wave guides, bundled coaxial cable, and later also via laser beam fiber optics: the expenditure would be about the same as for a Moon landing, except that the benefits in term of by-products would be greater.

Also in the 1970s, Paik imagined a global community of viewers for what he called a Video Common Market which would disseminate videos freely. In 1978, Paik collaborated with Dimitri Devyatkin to produce a light hearted comparison of life in two major cities, &quot;Media Shuttle: New York-Moscow&quot; on WNET. The video is held in museum collections around the world.

Possibly Paik&#x27;s most famous work, &quot;TV Buddha&quot; is a video installation depicting a Buddha statue viewing its own live image on a closed circuit TV. Paik created numerous versions of this work using different statues, the first version is from 1974.
Another piece, &quot;Positive Egg&quot;, displays a white egg on a black background. In a series of video monitors, increasing in size, the image on the screen becomes larger and larger, until the egg itself becomes an abstract, unrecognizable shape. In &quot;Video Fish&quot;, from 1975, a series of aquariums arranged in a horizontal line contain live fish swimming in front of an equal number of monitors which show video images of other fish.
Paik completed an installation in 1993 in the NJN Building in Trenton, NJ. This work was commissioned under the public building arts inclusion act of 1978. The installation&#x27;s media is neon lights incorporated around video screens. This particular piece is currently non-operational, though there are plans to make necessary upgrades/repairs to restore it to working order.

During the New Year&#x27;s Day celebration on January 1, 1984, he aired &quot;Good Morning, Mr. Orwell,&quot; a live link between WNET New York, Centre Pompidou Paris, and South Korea. With the participation of John Cage, Salvador Dalí, Laurie Anderson, Joseph Beuys, Merce Cunningham, Allen Ginsberg and Peter Orlovsky, George Plimpton, and other artists, Paik showed that George Orwell&#x27;s Big Brother had not arrived.

As the curator Suh Jinsuk has observed, after returning to Korea in 1984, Nam June Paik increasingly explored symbols of global exchange with Asia, such as the Silk Road and Eurasia. Moreover, as Paik became involved in Korea&#x27;s art scene, he spearheaded projects that drew upon his connections with business and government circles in South Korea. &quot;Bye Bye Kipling&quot;, a tape that mixed live events from Seoul, South Korea; Tokyo, Japan; and New York, USA, demonstrates this new phase in Paik&#x27;s practice. Broadcast on the occasion of the Asia Games in Seoul, &quot;Bye Bye Kipling&quot;&#x27;s title referenced a poem by Rudyard Kipling, &quot;East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet,&quot; as it fostered collaborations such as between the American artist Keith Haring and the Japan-based fashion designer Issey Miyake. As curator Lee Sooyon has argued, &quot;Bye Bye Kipling&quot; also contributed to the Korea government&#x27;s agendas of &quot;the advancement and internationalization of culture&quot; by bringing together video sketches of shaman rituals and Korean drum dancers with Seoul&#x27;s &quot;economic miracle&quot; and the bustling business of Namdaemun Market.

In 1988, Paik installed &quot;The More, The Better&quot; in the atrium of the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, Gwacheon. A giant tower, the work is made of 1003 monitors—a number that references October 3 as the day of Korea was founded by Dangun, according to legend. &quot;The More, The Better&quot; appears prominently in Paik&#x27;s 1988 broadcast &quot;Wrap Around the World,&quot; which was made for the Seoul Olympics. The same year, he unveiled &quot;Metrobot&quot;, his largest statue and his first outdoor installation, at the Contemporary Arts Center in Cincinnati.

For the German pavilion at the 1993 Venice Biennale, Paik created an array of robot sculptures of historic figures, such as Catherine the Great and the legendary founder of Korea, Dangun, so as to emphasize the connections between Europe and Asia.

Paik&#x27;s 1995 piece &quot;Electronic Superhighway: Continental U.S., Alaska, Hawaii&quot;, is on permanent display at the Lincoln Gallery of the Smithsonian American Art Museum.
Paik was known for making robots out of television sets. These were constructed using pieces of wire and metal, but later Paik used parts from radio and television sets.

Despite his stroke, in 2000, he created a millennium satellite broadcast entitled &quot;Tiger is Alive&quot; and in 2004 designed the installation of monitors and video projections Global Groove 2004 for the Deutsche Guggenheim in Berlin. Global Groove was turned into an NFT-based artwork and put up online at Christie&#x27;s, the global art auction house It sold for $56,250.

==Exhibitions==

Paik&#x27;s first exhibition, entitled &quot;Exposition of Music – Electronic Television&quot;, was held in 1963 at Galerie Parnass in Wuppertal, Germany. A retrospective of Paik&#x27;s work was held at the Whitney Museum in New York City in the spring of 1982. Major retrospectives of Paik&#x27;s work have been organized by Kölnischer Kunstverein (1976), Musée d&#x27;art moderne de la Ville de Paris (1978), Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City (1982), San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (1989), and the Kunsthalle Basel (1991).

Nam June Paik&#x27;s first major retrospective in Korea, &quot;Video Time – Video Space&quot;, opened at the Gwacheon location of the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, Korea on July 30, 1992. Although the exhibition lasted merely 34 days, it saw 117,961 paid visitors; the unofficial visitor count reached nearly 200,000. The exhibition involved the participation of major entities of media and business—including the Korea Broadcasting Corporation and Samsung Electronics. The exhibition presented approximately 150 artworks, beginning with &quot;The More, The Better&quot; as the exhibition&#x27;s starting point. According to Lee Sooyon, Paik carefully tailored the exhibition&#x27;s works to his audiences. Knowing that Korea&#x27;s audience was not familiar with international art world conversations of video art, Fluxus, and performance art, Paik selected artworks that appealed to popular subjects of Korean culture and history. The exhibition also featured works from Paik&#x27;s &quot;TV Buddha&quot; and &quot;My Faust&quot; series.

A final retrospective of his work was held in 2000 at the Guggenheim Museum in New York City, with the commissioned site-specific installation &quot;Modulation in Sync&quot; (2000) integrating the unique space of the museum into the exhibition itself. This coincided with a downtown gallery showing of video artworks by his wife Shigeko Kubota, mainly dealing with his recovery from a stroke he had in 1996.

In 2011, an exhibition centered on Paik&#x27;s video sculpture &quot;One Candle, Candle Projection&quot; (1988–2000) opened at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. Another retrospective was mounted at the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, D.C., in 2012–2013. As a leading expert in Paik&#x27;s work, art historian John G. Hanhardt was the curator for three landmark exhibitions devoted to the artist, the ones at the Whitney Museum, the Guggenheim Museum, and the Smithsonian American Art Museum.
Paik&#x27;s work also appeared in important group exhibitions such as São Paulo Biennale (1975), Whitney Biennial (1977, 1981, 1983, 1987, and 1989), Documenta 6 and 8 (1977 and 1987), and Venice Biennale (1984 and 1993).

From April 24, 2015, to September 7, 2015, Paik&#x27;s works &quot;T.V. Clock&quot;, &quot;9/23/69: Experiment with David Atwood,&quot; and &quot;ETUDE1&quot; were displayed at &quot;Watch This! Revelations in Media Art&quot; at the Smithsonian American Art Museum.

Although Paik&#x27;s pioneering experimentalism and foresight of the important role media would continue to play in society has been examined across many exhibitions, for a 2019 exhibition, the Tate Modern turned its focus upon Paik as a collaborator. This exhibition later travelled to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, where it was presented at the first West-coast retrospective of Paik&#x27;s work from May 8, 2021, through October 3, 2021. It was later presented at the National Gallery Singapore from 10 December 2021 to 27 March 2022, a first time that such an expansive and ambitious presentation of Paik&#x27;s oeuvre was presented in Southeast Asia 

In late 2022, the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, Korea, will present an exhibition that focuses on Paik as cultural organizer who made an immense impact upon South Korea&#x27;s art scene; it aims to bring into greater focus Paik&#x27;s relationship with national identity.

==Archive==
Given its largely antiquated technology, Paik&#x27;s oeuvre poses a unique conservation challenge. In 2006, Nam June Paik&#x27;s estate asked a group of museums for proposals on how each would use the archive. Out of a group that included the Museum of Modern Art, the J. Paul Getty Museum, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and the Whitney Museum of American Art, it chose the Smithsonian American Art Museum. The archive includes Paik&#x27;s early writings on art history, history and technology; correspondence with other artists and collaborators like Charlotte Moorman, John Cage, George Maciunas and Wolf Vostell; and a complete collection of videotapes used in his work, as well as production notes, television work, sketches, notebooks, models and plans for videos. It also covers early-model televisions and video projectors, radios, record players, cameras and musical instruments, toys, games, folk sculptures and the desk where he painted in his SoHo studio.

Curator John Hanhardt, an old friend of Paik, said of the archive: &quot;It came in great disorder, which made it all the more complicated. It is not like his space was perfectly organized. I think the archive is like a huge memory machine. A wunderkammer, a wonder cabinet of his life.&quot; Hanhardt describes the archives in the catalog for the 2012 Smithsonian show in the book &quot;Nam June Paik: Global Visionary&quot;.

Michael Mansfield, associate curator of film and media arts at the Smithsonian American Art Museum, supervised the complex installation of several hundred CRT TV sets, the wiring to connect them all, and the software and servers to drive them. He developed an app on his phone to operate every electronic artwork on display.

Many of Paik&#x27;s early works and writings are collected in a volume edited by Judson Rosebush titled &quot;Nam June Paik: Videa &#x27;n&#x27; Videology 1959–1973,&quot; published by the Everson Museum of Art, Syracuse, New York, in 1974.

==Influence==
As a pioneer of video art his influence was from a student he met at CalArts named Sharon Grace he described her as &quot;pure genius&quot; from the moment they met. The two met while she was filming fellow students at random with her Sony Portapak as an artistic sociological practice akin to the artist in the studio. This led to &quot;TV Buddha&quot; and people&#x27;s model of the internet as we know it today with such art pieces as &quot;Send / Receive&quot;. The artwork and ideas of Nam June Paik were a major influence on late 20th-century art and continue to inspire a new generation of artists. Contemporary artists considered to be influenced by Paik include Christian Marclay, Jon Kessler, Cory Arcangel, Ryan Trecartin and Haroon Mirza.

Nam June Paik&#x27;s work was first screened in South Korea on March 20, 1974, at the United States Information Center in Seoul. The artist Park Hyunki was among the audience (which featured Paik&#x27;s Global Groove); the screening notably inspired Park Hyunki to first experiment with video.

==Art market==
Christie&#x27;s holds the auction record for Paik&#x27;s work since it achieved $646,896 in Hong Kong in 2007 for his &quot;Wright Brothers&quot;, a 1995 propeller-plane-like tableau comprising 14 TV monitors.

In 2015, Gagosian Gallery acquired the right to represent Paik&#x27;s artistic estate.

==Personal life==
Paik moved to New York City in 1964. In 1977, he married the video artist Shigeko Kubota. After marrying Kubota and living in the United States for several decades, Paik became a naturalized American citizen.

Paik was a lifelong Buddhist who never smoked nor drank alcoholic beverages, and never drove a car.

==Health deterioration and death==
In 1996, Paik had a stroke, which paralyzed his left side. He used a wheelchair the last decade of his life, though he was able to walk with assistance.

He died on January 29, 2006, in Miami, Florida, due to complications from a stroke.

Paik was survived by his wife, his brother, Ken Paik, and a nephew, Ken Paik Hakuta, an inventor and television personality best known for creating the Wacky WallWalker toy, and who managed Paik&#x27;s studios in New York City.

In one of his last interviews, Paik voiced his belief that to be buried in a cemetery would be futile, and expressed a desire for his ashes to be scattered around the world, and for some of his ashes to be buried in Korea.

<text>Lüchow-Dannenberg is a district in Lower Saxony, Germany, which is usually referred to as Hanoverian Wendland (&quot;Hannoversches Wendland&quot;) or Wendland. It is bounded by (from the west and clockwise) the districts of Uelzen and Lüneburg and the states of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania (district of Ludwigslust-Parchim), Brandenburg (district of Prignitz) and Saxony-Anhalt (districts of Stendal and Altmarkkreis Salzwedel).

==History==
In medieval times the counties of Lüchow and Dannenberg occupied the area (from the early 12th century on). These counties were originally Slavic states that lost their independence to the Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg in the beginning of the 14th century.

Since that time it was always an eastern extension of different entities, usually states like West Germany.

The area was ruled by Lüneburg until 1705 and then became a part of the Electorate of Hanover. When the Kingdom of Hanover was annexed by Prussia (1866), the districts of Lüchow and Dannenberg were established within the new Province of Hanover.

A Slavic language persisted here until the 18th century.

In 1932 the two districts of Lüchow and Dannenberg were merged into the current district with Dannenberg as capital. In 1951 the seat of the administration was moved to Lüchow.

==Current issues==
Since the end of the 1990s the financial problems of the municipalities in the district grew more and more severe. To save money spent for administration a major municipal reform is currently discussed. The two most likely outcomes of the reform will be either a conversion of the district to an urban district, in which the 27 municipalities will then become boroughs of one town. The other discussed solution is the merger into two &quot;Samtgemeinden&quot;. The dissolution of the district and inclusion of the two remaining &quot;Samtgemeinden&quot; into the districts of Lüneburg and Uelzen are also discussed.

==Geography==
The district is named for the two main towns. It is better known as the Wendland, a designation referring to the Slavic people of the Wends from Obotrite tribe Drevani, who lived there till the 18th century — the last known user of the local dialect of Polabian language died in 1752. The landscape is characterised by riverside woodlands along the Elbe river and a hilly countryside.

In addition, the Wendland is known for the small village of Gorleben (part of the &quot;Samtgemeinde&quot; Gartow), where the establishment of a final disposal place for radioactive waste is planned. The salt dome Gorleben, a deep geological repository is proposed. Moreover, an interim storage for spent nuclear fuel is located in Gorleben. The area has been a site of clashes between the police and anti-nuclear protesters since the 1980s.

Lüchow-Dannenberg has a sister-city relationship with Steglitz-Zehlendorf, a borough of Berlin since 1979.

Lüchow-Dannenberg is the least populous of Germany&#x27;s 402 districts, and has the lowest population density of any district in West Germany.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms displays:
* a fir, which was the heraldic symbol of the counts of Dannenberg
* three yellow rhombs from the arms of the counts of Lüchow

<doc id="149362" wikidata="Q7388695" url="?curid=149362" title="SAPHIRE">
<text>SAPHIRE is a probabilistic risk and reliability assessment software tool. SAPHIRE stands for &quot;Systems Analysis Programs for Hands-on Integrated Reliability Evaluations&quot;. The system was developed for the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) by the Idaho National Laboratory.

Development began in the mid-1980s when the NRC began exploring two notions: 1) that Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) information could be displayed and manipulated using the emerging microcomputer technology of the day and 2) the rapid advancement of PRA technology required a relatively inexpensive and readily available platform for teaching PRA concepts to students.

==The history of SAPHIRE==

1987 Version 1 of the code called IRRAS (now known as SAPHIRE) introduced an innovative way to draw, edit, and analyze graphical fault trees.

1989 Version 2 is released incorporating the ability to draw, edit, and analyze graphical event trees.

1990 Analysis improvements to IRRAS led to the release of Version 4 and the formation of the IRRAS Users Group.

1992 Creation of 32-bit IRRAS, Version 5, resulted in an order-of-magnitude decrease in analysis time. New features included: end state analysis; fire, flood, and seismic modules; rule-base cut set processing; and rule-based fault tree to event tree linking.

1997 SAPHIRE for Windows, version 6.x, is released. Use of a Windows user-interface makes SAPHIRE easy to learn. The new &quot;plug-in&quot; feature allows analysts to expand on the built-in probability calculations.

1999 SAPHIRE for Windows, version 7.x, is released. Enhancements are made to the event tree &quot;linking rules&quot; and to the use of dual language capability inside the SAPHIRE database.

2005 SAPHIRE for Windows, version 8.x, undergoes development.

2008 SAPHIRE for Windows, version 8.x, release as a beta version.

2010 SAPHIRE for Windows, version 8.x, release for U.S. Government and industry use.

The evolution of software and related analysis methods has led to the current generation of the SAPHIRE tool. The current SAPHIRE software code-base started in the mid-1980s as part of the NRC&#x27;s general risk activities. In 1986, work commenced on the precursor to the SAPHIRE software – this software package was named the Integrated Reliability and Risk Analysis System, or IRRAS. IRRAS was the first IBM compatible PC-based risk analysis tool developed at the Idaho National Laboratory, thereby allowing users to work in a graphical interface rather than with mainframe punch cards. While limited to the analysis of only fault trees of medium size, version 1 of IRRAS was the initial step in the progress that today has led to the SAPHIRE software, software that is capable of running on multiple processors simultaneously and is able to handle extremely large analyses.

== NASA use ==

Historically, NASA relied on worst-case Failure mode and effects analysis for safety assessment. However, this approach has problems, such as it is qualitative and does not aggregate risk at a system or mission level. On October 29, 1986, the investigation of the Challenger accident criticized NASA for not “estimating the probability of failure of the various [Shuttle] elements.” Further, in January 1988, the Post-Challenger investigation recommended that “probabilistic risk assessment approaches be applied to the Shuttle risk management program.&quot;

Consequently, probabilistic methods are now being used at NASA. Specifically, the following projects have all used the SAPHIRE software as the primary analysis tool for risk:

* PRA for the International Space Station
* PRA for the Space Shuttle
* PRA studies in support of nuclear missions
* PRA for conceptual designs (e.g., Constellation)
* PRA for the Mars Exploration Rover

== Advanced analysis ==
SAPHIRE contains an advanced minimal cut set solving engine. This solver, which has been fine tuned and optimized over time, has a variety of techniques for analysis, including:
* Extensive use of recursive routines
* Restructuring and expansion of the logic model
* Conversion of complemented gates and treatment of success branches
* Logic pruning due to TRUE or FALSE house events
* Coalescing gates and the identification of modules and independent sub-trees
* Intermediate results caching
* Bit-table Boolean absorption

Use of these and other optimization methods has resulted in SAPHIRE having one of the most powerful analysis engines in use for probabilistic risk assessment today.

== Basic event probabilities ==

General basic event probability capabilities for SAPHIRE include:

* Four different Markov models to represent the failure of a single component
* A common cause module to determine a group common cause failure probability for groups of up to six redundant components
* A load-capacity calculation allowing the user to specify a load and capacity distribution to determine P(Capacity &lt; Load)
* A human reliability analysis calculator to determine a human failure event probability based upon the task type and compounding performance shaping factors
* The use of template events which allow for failure information to be shared where applicable
* A seismic fragility method that uses an associated earthquake acceleration level to determine a components failure probability
* House events to set basic events to logically true or false or to ignore the event
* A module to determine the loss-of-offsite power frequency and recoverability

SAPHIRE has been designed to handle large fault trees, where a tree may have up to 64,000 basic events and gates. To handle the fault trees, two mechanisms for developing and modifying the fault tree are available – a graphical editor and a hierarchical logic editor. Analysts may use either editor; if the logic is modified SAPHIRE can redraw the fault tree graphic. Conversely, if the user modifies the fault tree graphic, SAPHIRE automatically updates the associated logic. Applicable objects available in the fault tree editors include basic events and several gate types, including: OR, AND, NOR, NAND, and N-of-M. In addition to these objects, SAPHIRE has a unique feature known as “table events” that allows the user to group up to eight basic events together on the fault tree graphic, thereby compacting the size of the fault tree on the printed page or computer screen. All of these objects though represent traditional static-type Boolean logic models. Models explicitly capturing dynamic or time-dependent situations are not available in current versions of SAPHIRE.

<doc id="149365" wikidata="Q352878" url="?curid=149365" title="Chris Waddle">
<text>Christopher Roland Waddle (born 14 December 1960) is an English former professional football player and manager. He had a spell as Burnley manager during the 1997–98 season, but has not returned to coaching since. Largely since retiring he has worked in the media for BBC Radio 5 Live as part of their Premier League and Champions League team. He currently works as a commentator.

Nicknamed &quot;Magic Chris&quot;, football journalist Luke Ginnell wrote that Waddle was &quot;widely acknowledged as one of the finest attacking midfielders in Europe&quot;. During his professional career, which lasted from 1978 to 1998, he played for several clubs, including Newcastle United, Tottenham Hotspur, Olympique de Marseille and Sheffield Wednesday. In 1989, his transfer from Tottenham to Marseille for £4.5 million made him the third most valuable player in the world, and he won three successive Ligue 1 titles with the club and played in the 1991 European Cup Final. While playing for Wednesday in the Premier League he was voted FWA Footballer of the Year for his performances in the 1992-93 season. He also played in the Premier League for Sunderland, in the Scottish Premiership with Falkirk and in the Football League for Bradford City, Burnley and Torquay United. He finished his career in non-League football with Worksop Town, Glapwell and Stocksbridge Park Steels, later whilst in his fifties, he continued to play at semi-professional level for Northern Counties East League side Hallam. 
Waddle earned 62 caps for England between 1985 and 1991, which included being a member of the teams which reached the quarter-finals of the 1986 FIFA World Cup and the semi-finals of the 1990 World Cup. He also played for England at UEFA Euro 1988.

==Club career==

===Early career===
Waddle began his footballing career with Pelaw Juniors, moving on to Whitehouse SC, Mount Pleasant SC, HMH Printing, Pelaw SC, Leam Lane SC and Clarke Chapman before joining Tow Law Town before the start of the 1978–79 season.

===Newcastle United===
While working in food processing (a seasoning factory), Waddle had unsuccessful trials with Sunderland and Coventry City. He joined Newcastle United as a 19-year-old in July 1980 for £1,000.

He made his Second Division debut for them in a 1–0 home win over Shrewsbury Town on 22 October 1980 and quickly established himself as an effective attacking midfielder, playing alongside Kevin Keegan and Peter Beardsley as Newcastle won promotion to the First Division at the end of 1983–84 season.

In one of his first games in the top flight, against Queen&#x27;s Park Rangers at Loftus Road on 22 September 1984, Waddle scored a first half hat-trick for Newcastle, who had a 4–0 lead at half time. However, a fight back by QPR saw the game end 5–5.

===Tottenham Hotspur===
After 46 goals in 170 league games for Newcastle, Waddle joined Tottenham Hotspur on 1 July 1985 for a fee of £590,000 (decided by a transfer tribunal). He scored twice on his league debut, a 4–0 home win over Watford on the opening day of the league season, although Spurs had a disappointing season where they finished tenth a year after finishing third, resulting in the dismissal of Peter Shreeves as manager and the appointment of David Pleat from Luton Town as his successor.

He won an FA Cup runners-up medal in 1987 when Spurs were beaten by Coventry, while they also finished third in the League and got to the semi-finals of the League Cup.

===Marseille===
On 1 July 1989, after scoring 33 times in 138 league appearances for Tottenham, Waddle moved to French club Olympique de Marseille for a fee of £4.5 million; the third highest sum ever paid for a footballer at the time. During his time in France the club were French champions three times (1990, 1991 and 1992). They were also on the losing side to Red Star Belgrade in the 1991 European Cup Final. In 1991–92, he also played alongside fellow England midfielder Trevor Steven, who spent a year in France after signing from Rangers, only to return to Scotland after a single season there.

During his years at Marseille, the fans gave him the nickname &quot;Magic Chris&quot;. He was known as the successor to former Marseille player Roger Magnusson. Waddle was also voted second best OM player of the century behind Jean Pierre Papin for the club&#x27;s century anniversary in 1998. Waddle and Marseille reached the 1991 European Cup Final. Although he did not take a penalty, Waddle ended up on the losing side in a penalty shoot-out once again, after the game had ended 0–0 in normal time.

===Sheffield Wednesday===
Waddle returned to England in July 1992 in a £1 million move to Sheffield Wednesday, then managed by Trevor Francis. The club reached both domestic cup finals in the 1992–93 season (losing both to Arsenal – Waddle scored Wednesday&#x27;s goal in the FA Cup final replay) and Waddle was voted the Football Writers&#x27; Association Footballer of the Year in 1993.

He helped Wednesday reach the semi-finals of the League Cup in the 1993–94 season, but this latest attempt at winning silverware was foiled by Manchester United, and the next two seasons brought bottom-half finishes in the league for Wednesday. Waddle&#x27;s past also came back to haunt him in Wednesday&#x27;s exit from the 1994–95 FA Cup, when a tie against Wolverhampton Wanderers was decided on a penalty shoot out, Waddle again missing an attempt. Francis was axed in 1995 and Waddle&#x27;s former Tottenham manager David Pleat took over.

In January 1996, Kevin Keegan attempted to re-sign Waddle for Newcastle United as cover for David Ginola during a suspension, but Keegan&#x27;s £500,000 bid to re-sign the player who had played alongside him in the Newcastle team more than a decade earlier was rejected and Keegan was unwilling to meet manager David Pleat&#x27;s £1million asking price for the 35-year-old. Around this time, Celtic, Leeds United and Sunderland were also interested in signing Waddle, but none of these transfers ever happened. Burnley also expressed an interest in appointing him as their player-manager – a role he would finally take the following year – but Waddle saw out the season at Hillsborough.

Waddle&#x27;s later career at Hillsborough was marred by injuries and he was released 5 games into the 1996–97 season (when the Owls were top of the premiership and having taken young sensation Ritchie Humphreys – 4 goals in 5 games – under his wing) after being frozen out of the team by David Pleat, having played 109 games and scored 10 goals with many more assists.

===Falkirk and Bradford City===
Waddle joined Falkirk, in the Scottish First Division, in September 1996, but returned south of the border to play for Division One strugglers Bradford City the following month. Although short, his time at City was a success and he was a firm fans favourite. In a match away to Huddersfield Town he scored direct from a corner in a 3–3 draw live on TV. He also scored a goal in a 3-2 FA Cup win against Everton at Goodison Park which came second in the February 1997 Match of the Day Goal of the Month. His efforts with Bradford contributed to their survival in Division One, although he did not complete the season there.

===Sunderland===
Waddle moved to Sunderland, the side he had supported as a boy, for a nominal fee of £75,000 in March 1997, but could not help Sunderland from being relegated from the Premier League at the end of the season, despite scoring once against Everton and providing the assist for all other Sunderland goals scored in that period.

===Burnley===
In May 1997 Waddle was appointed player-manager of Burnley, moving from Roker Park on a free transfer. Burnley had a disappointing season, only just avoiding relegation at the end of the season. He scored once during his spell at Burnley, the goal coming in a 2–2 draw with AFC Bournemouth in October 1997.

===Torquay United===
Waddle left Burnley in the summer, and in September 1998 joined Torquay United. He played just 7 times for Torquay, before returning to Sheffield Wednesday as a coach. He was appointed reserve team coach in July 1999, and played for a local pub side, but left in June 2000 on the appointment of Paul Jewell as manager, just after the club (now blighted by financial problems) suffered relegation from the Premier League.

===Non-League career===
Following his departure from Torquay United, Waddle enjoyed two seasons with non-League Worksop Town making 60 appearances and scoring 3 goals. His most notable appearance was in a 12–0 Northern Premier League record win against Frickley Athletic. He also had a brief spell with Glapwell and one appearance for Stocksbridge Park Steels in the Northern Premier League First Division, continuing his playing career at non-League level into his early forties. Waddle later played regularly for Brunsmeer Athletic in the Meadowhall Sheffield &amp; District Sunday Football League.

===Hallam===
Having played at amateur level in the Sheffield Wragg Over-40s league for Hallam during 2012–13 season he came out of retirement after 11 years on the sidelines and signed for Sheffield based non-League side Hallam in the Counties East League (tier 10 of the pyramid) on 22 July 2013. He made his debut against Chesterfield in a pre-season friendly, coming on as a substitute at half time. The game ended in a 6–2 defeat for Hallam FC. Waddle signed a one-year deal on 1 August 2013, committing to Hallam for the 2013–14 season promotion push while remaining part of the ESPN commentary team. He later rejoined in 2023.

==International career==
Despite being in his 25th year, he was called up for the England Under-21 side and made his full squad debut against Ireland in March 1985.

On 26 March 1985, when still a Newcastle player, Waddle was capped at senior level by Bobby Robson&#x27;s England for the first time in a 2–1 win over Republic of Ireland. He soon became a regular member of the England squad and on 16 October that year he scored his first England goal, on his tenth international appearance, in a 5–0 win over Turkey.

Waddle was in England&#x27;s squad at the 1986 and 1990 FIFA World Cup as well as UEFA Euro 1988. Although England were eliminated at the group stages of Euro 88 after losing all three games, they did reach the quarter-finals of the 1986 World Cup and the semi-finals in 1990. Waddle had an eventful match in the semi-final against West Germany, which ended in defeat on a penalty shootout. Waddle hit the post with a shot in extra time, which could have been the winning goal, but then missed the decisive penalty in the shootout defeat as he put it inches over the bar. He says he only took the fifth penalty because Paul Gascoigne, who had been suspended from playing in the next game if England progressed, was too upset to take it. He subsequently blamed a chance meeting with Uri Geller and Michael Jackson prior to the tournament for missing his penalty. Waddle&#x27;s performances in the 1990 World Cup were described as &quot;superb&quot; by Rob Bagchi, writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2010.

He won the last of his 62 England caps on 16 October 1991 in a 1–0 win over Turkey, more than six years after making his international debut, and having rarely missed an England game since then. He had scored six goals for England, the last against Scotland on 27 May 1989.

Waddle had fallen out of favour under coach Graham Taylor, but after a poor run of results for the national team, when Terry Venables became the new England manager at the beginning of 1994, he was keen to include Waddle in the squad for his first game against Denmark. However, Waddle was injured at the time and unavailable for selection.

==Media career==
In 1987, Waddle recorded the song &quot;Diamond Lights&quot; in a duet with Spurs and England teammate Glenn Hoddle. The song reached number 12 in the UK Singles Chart in May of that year and the pair appeared on Top Of The Pops. Whilst at Marseille he joined teammate Basile Boli in recording a song entitled &quot;We&#x27;ve Got a Feeling&quot;.

Despite spending the 1997–98 season as a manager, Waddle never returned to the coaching side of the game following his retirement and became a TV football pundit, commentator and sports newspaper writer. He previously worked for Setanta Sports and ESPN, he currently works as an analyst for BBC Radio Five Live&#x27;s Premier League football coverage.

Waddle appeared on BBC Radio 5 Live as a summariser at Premier League matches and also writes a column in &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper. Waddle signed a deal with Setanta Sports to commentate on all England away matches in 2008–09. Waddle then went on to co-commentate for ESPN&#x27;s English Premier League football coverage and is a pundit on Showsports Arabia, covering the English Premier League, from the studio in Dubai, UAE.

In 2003, Thierry Henry named Waddle in his all-time Dream Team Line up. Following England&#x27;s heavy defeat to Germany in the second round of the 2010 FIFA World Cup, Waddle criticised the English Football Association, claiming: &quot;The FA sit on their backsides and do nothing tournament after tournament after tournament. Why don&#x27;t they listen? Why don&#x27;t they look at other countries and ask &#x27;how do they keep producing talent?&#x27; We coach talent out of players ... We lack so many ideas and it is so frustrating. The amount of money in our league is frightening and all we do is waste it on rubbish ideas ... We kid ourselves thinking we have a chance if we keep the tempo up. We can only play one way and it is poor. You can&#x27;t go on playing football and hoping to win trophies playing a hundred miles an hour and putting teams under pressure for 90 minutes. You&#x27;ve got to be able to play slow, slow, quick and we can&#x27;t do it.&quot;

In 2019 Waddle featured in the first season of ITV show Harry&#x27;s Heroes, which featured former football manager Harry Redknapp attempting get a squad of former England international footballers back fit and healthy for a game against Germany legends.

==Personal life==
Waddle has one daughter, Brooke, a son called Jack. On 29 April 2012, Jack was given a one-year first-team contract at Chesterfield.
His cousin, Alan Waddle, played league football for Halifax Town, Liverpool, Leicester City, Swansea City, Newport County, Mansfield Town, Hartlepool United and Peterborough United.

In 2005, he was arrested following claims he was involved in a brawl in a pub in Dore, Sheffield. No charges were brought due to lack of evidence.

==In popular culture==
Waddle was a key part of the pool of popular culture references used in the BBC comedy &quot;The Fast Show&quot;. References to, and photographs of, Waddle made regular appearances during the &quot;Chanel 9&quot; news segment of the show.

<text>St. Joseph is a city in Andrew and Buchanan counties and the county seat of Buchanan County, Missouri, United States. Located on the Missouri River, it is the principal city of the St. Joseph Metropolitan Statistical Area, which includes Buchanan, Andrew, and DeKalb counties in Missouri and Doniphan County, Kansas. As of the 2020 census, St. Joseph had a total population of 72,473, making it the 8th most populous city in the state, and the 3rd most populous in Northwest Missouri. St. Joseph is located roughly thirty miles north of the Kansas City, Missouri, city limits and approximately south of Omaha, Nebraska.

The city was named after the town&#x27;s founder Joseph Robidoux and the biblical Saint Joseph. St. Joseph is home to Missouri Western State University. In the nineteenth century, it was the death place of American outlaw Jesse James. It was also the starting point of the Pony Express serving the West.

==History==

St. Joseph was founded on the Missouri River by Joseph Robidoux, a local fur trader of French Canadian descent. It was officially incorporated in 1843. In its early days, it was a bustling outpost and rough frontier town, serving as a last supply point and jumping-off point for travelers on the Missouri River toward the &quot;Wild West&quot;. It was the westernmost point in the United States accessible by rail until after the American Civil War.

The main east–west downtown streets were named for Robidoux&#x27;s eight children: Faraon, Jules, Francois (Francis), Felix, Edmond, Charles, Sylvanie, and Messanie. The street between Sylvanie and Messanie was named for his second wife, Angelique.

St. Joseph, or &quot;St. Joe&quot;, as it was called by many, was a &quot;Jumping-Off Point&quot; for those migrants headed to the Oregon Territory in the mid-1800s. Such cities, including Independence, and St. Joseph, were where pioneers would stay and purchase supplies before they headed out in wagon trains across the Great Plains. The town was a very lively place.

Between April 3, 1860, and late October 1861, St. Joseph was one of the two endpoints of the Pony Express, which operated for a short period over the land then inaccessible by rail, to provide fast mail service. Today the Pony Express Museum hosts visitors in the former stables of the company. St. Joseph is identified by the slogan, &quot;Where the Pony Express started and Jesse James ended.&quot;

The town&#x27;s main hotel was Patee House. In the post-Civil War years, when the economy was down, the hotel was used for a time by the Patee Female College. It was occupied by the St. Joseph Female College up to 1880.

In 1874 the State Lunatic Asylum #2 was opened just East of St. Joseph. The asylum, originally built for 250 patients opened its doors with more than 300. The asylum was mostly self-sustaining with three large farms, power plant, fire department, metal shops, wood shops, dairy and more, all worked by the patients. Over the decades the asylum grew rapidly, reaching its peak of close to 3,000 patients by the 1940s. In 1968 occupational therapist George Glore with the help of his patients, recreated several historic treatment devices for Mental Health Awareness Month. This was the start of the Glore Psychiatric Museum. Now the largest museum of its kind in the world, the museum shows the history mental health treatment and still houses the original exhibits created by George Glore and his patients.

Outlaw Jesse James lived here under the alias &quot;Mr. Howard&quot;. The song, &quot;Jesse James&quot;, includes the lines, &quot;...that dirty little coward that shot Mr. Howard has laid poor Jesse in his grave.&quot; On April 3, 1882, James was killed at his home, originally located at 1318 Lafayette. It has been relocated next to the Patee House and still has the visible bullet hole from the fatal shot. It is now operated as the Jesse James Home Museum.

The Heaton-Bowman-Smith Funeral Home maintains a small museum about Jesse James. Their predecessors conducted his funeral.

St. Joseph was the second city in the US to install electric streetcars; regular service was initiated on July 4, 1888. Among properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are Robidoux Row, buildings owned by the founder and used for his family trading and mercantile business; the Patee House, now serving as a museum displaying St. Joseph&#x27;s history, and the Missouri Theatre, an ornate movie palace. The Walnut Park Farm Historic District near St. Joseph was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999.

St. Joseph&#x27;s population peaked in 1900, with a census population of 102,979. This population figure is questionable, as civic leaders were known to have tried to raise the numbers for that census. At the time, Saint Joseph was home to one of the largest wholesale companies in the Midwest, the Nave &amp; McCord Mercantile Company, as well as the Hannibal and St. Joseph Railroad, and the C.D. Smith &amp; Company. C.D. Smith later became C.D. Smith Healthcare.

Prior to 1954 and desegregation, Bartlett High School served St. Joseph&#x27;s African American students. It became Horace Mann Elementary with desegregation. St. Joseph&#x27;s African American community leaders and Nathaniel C. Bruce were involved in and supported the establishment of Bartlett Agricultural and Industrial School in Dalton, Missouri. It was modeled after Tuskegee Institute and Hampton Institute.

==Media==
St. Joseph currently ranks 201st largest designated market area out of 210 media markets in the United States (as ranked by Nielsen Media Research); the market covers six counties in northwestern Missouri (Holt, Worth, Nodaway, Andrew, DeKalb and Buchanan) and Doniphan County in northeastern Kansas. The St. Joseph area has three low-power and two full-power television stations, and ten radio stations. News-Press &amp; Gazette, a media corporation, is headquartered in Saint Joseph. They have interests in numerous television, radio, and newspaper markets throughout the midwestern and western United States.

===Television===
Due to its proximity to Kansas City, stations from that market serve as default affiliate of MyNetworkTV (KSMO-TV/Kansas City) and default member station of PBS (KCPT/Kansas City) due to the lack of stations of either network licensed to the market. ABC affiliate KQTV had long been the only major commercial station in St. Joseph, but in June 2012, the locally based News-Press &amp; Gazette Company signed on KNPN-LD as a Fox affiliate, KBJO-LD as a CW+ affiliate, and KNPG-LD as a Telemundo affiliate. This in turn was followed by the conversions of KBJO-LD to NBC affiliate KNPG-LD in November 2016 (retaining the CW+ as a LD2 subchannel), and the original KNPG-LD (which assumed the KBJO-LD call letters) to CBS affiliate KCJO-LD in June 2017, ending out-of-market reliance for major network programming.

<doc id="149373" wikidata="Q98929208" url="?curid=149373" title="Queer studies">
<text>Queer studies, sexual diversity studies, or LGBTQ studies is the study of topics relating to sexual orientation and gender identity usually focusing on lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, gender dysphoric, asexual, aromantic, queer, questioning, and intersex people and cultures.

Originally centered on LGBT history and literary theory, the field has expanded to include the academic study of issues raised in archaeology, sociology, psychiatry, anthropology, the history of science, philosophy, psychology, sexology, political science, ethics, communication, and other fields by an examination of the identity, lives, history, and perception of being queer.

Queer studies is not the same as queer theory, which is an analytical viewpoint within queer studies (centered on literary studies and philosophy) that challenges the existence of &quot;socially constructed&quot; categories of sexual identity.

==Background==
Queer refers to the implicit identity of gender and sex and how it is integrated into individuals&#x27; lives. It can function as an adjective, verb, or noun. In academia, queer has become a mode of analysis recognizing the intersectionality of sex, gender, and sexuality intersecting with aspects of human identity such as class, race, age, and ethnicity. Once considered a slur, queer now encompasses inclusivity in the 21st century. Some people find that the term &quot;queer studies&quot; is more defining of universal experiences compared to &quot;LGBTQ+ Studies.&quot;

Many topics within queer studies focus on the open possibilities beyond heteronormativity; detailing texts, cultural artifacts produced by queer individuals, as well as expanding beyond into how queer interacts with daily life.

Though a new discipline, a growing number of colleges have begun offering academic programs on the expansive topics of queer. This has been a trend in higher education since the early 90&#x27;s.

=== Queer as a reclaimed slur ===
The term Queer itself has become the topic of controversy over the reclaiming of a word which has been used against LGBTQ+ individuals for the last century. There is an ongoing debate within the community itself between the use of LGBTQ+ studies or queer studies. LGBTQ+ provides a more categorical description of its subjects. In contrast, queer has a history of going from being a common descriptor for someone who exhibited any emotion from happy to drunk in the 19th century to being used as a slur against same-sex individuals in the 20th century. The term did not have an implicit sexual definition until the early 20th century, and reclamation of the slur started during the late 80&#x27;s and 90&#x27;s. This was a response to the overall LGBTQ+ movement, with influence from the AIDs crisis of the time. Some people believe that &quot;queer&quot; expands the definition without categorical labels, while others reject the term due to its harmful history.

==History==

During the 1920s, same-sex subcultures were beginning to become more established in several larger US cities. Studies centering around queer life and culture originated in the 1970s with the publication of several &quot;seminal works of gay history. Inspired by ethnic studies, women&#x27;s studies, and similar identity-based academic fields influenced by the critical theory of the Frankfurt School, the initial emphasis was on &quot;uncovering the suppressed history of gay and lesbian life;&quot; it also made its way into literature departments, where the emphasis was on literary theory. Queer theory soon developed, challenging the &quot;socially constructed&quot; categories of sexual identity.

The first undergraduate course in the United States on LGBTQ studies was taught at the University of California, Berkeley in the spring of 1970. It was followed by similar courses in the fall of 1970 at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville and at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln (UNL).

According to Harvard University, the City University of New York began the first university program in gay and lesbian studies in 1986. The City College of San Francisco claims to be the &quot;First Queer Studies Department in the U.S.&quot;, with English instructor Dan Allen developing one of the first gay literature courses in the country in the fall of 1972, and the college establishing what it calls &quot;the first Gay and Lesbian Studies Department in the United States&quot; in 1989. Then-department chair Jonathan David Katz was the first tenured faculty in queer studies in the country. Hobart and William Smith Colleges in upstate New York were among the first to offer a full-fledged major in LGBTQ Studies in the late 1990s. These colleges currently have one of the few tenure lines in a stand-alone LGBT Studies program, while many such programs are being absorbed into Women and Gender Studies programs.

Historians John Boswell and Martin Duberman made Yale University a notable center of lesbian and gay studies in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Each historian published several books on gay history; Boswell held three biennial conferences on the subject at the university, and Duberman sought to establish a center for lesbian and gay studies there in 1985. However, Boswell died in 1994, and in 1991, Duberman left for the City University of New York, where he founded its Center for Lesbian and Gay Studies. A 1993 alumnus gift evolved into the faculty committee-administered Fund for Lesbian and Gay Studies, which developed a listing of courses relevant to lesbian and gay studies called the &quot;Pink Book&quot; and established a small lending library named for Boswell. The committee began to oversee a series of one-year visiting professorships in 1994.

=== Anti-gay curriculum laws ===
Anita Bryant, a popular face in the media and widely known by the public, was at the forefront of the &quot;Save Our Children&quot; movement in 1977, born in response to an Oklahoma ordinance criminalizing discrimination due to sexual preference. This campaign aimed to discourage the hiring of homosexual schoolteachers. Bryant claimed that they would molest the children and wrongfully serve as an example that any marriage outside of one between a man and a woman is respectable. The movement and its publicity gained Bryant much public support and eventually resulted in the overturning of the gay rights ordinance just half a year after it was implemented.

Bryant&#x27;s campaign caught the attention of California state Senator John Briggs, who eagerly expressed his interest in expanding the Save Our Children campaign to his state, which initially took the form of Proposition 6 or the Briggs Initiative. This initiative allowed for employment discrimination against those who engaged in homosexual activity in public, or publicly encouraged or promoted homosexual activity towards co-workers and their students. Unlike Bryant&#x27;s movement, which focused solely on gay teachers, Briggs&#x27; campaign could be applied to homosexual and heterosexual people alike since his initiative discriminated against the discussion of homosexual behavior, which anyone could do. Briggs&#x27; initiative was ultimately denied in 1978.

===Yale–Kramer controversy===
In 1997, writer and AIDS activist Larry Kramer offered his alma mater, Yale, $4 million (and his personal papers) to endow a permanent, tenured professorship in gay studies and possibly build a gay and lesbian student center. His requirements were specific, as Yale was to use the money solely for &quot;1) the study of and/or instruction in gay male literature...&quot; including a tenured position, &quot;and/or 2) the establishment of a gay student center at Yale...&quot;

With gender, ethnic, and race-related studies still relatively new, Yale Provost Alison Richard said that gay and lesbian studies was too narrow a specialty for a program in perpetuity, indicating a wish to compromise on some of the conditions Kramer had asserted. Negotiations broke down as Kramer, frustrated by what he perceived to be &quot;homophobic&quot; resistance, condemned the university in a front-page story in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. According to Kramer, he subsequently received letters from more than 100 institutions of higher learning &quot;begging me to consider them.&quot;

In 2001, Yale accepted a $1 million grant from his older brother, money manager Arthur Kramer, to establish the Larry Kramer Initiative for Lesbian and Gay Studies. The five-year program aimed to bring in visiting faculty, host conferences and lectures, and coordinate academic endeavors in lesbian and gay studies. Jonathan David Katz assumed the role of executive coordinator in 2002; in 2003, he commented that while women&#x27;s studies or African American studies have been embraced by American universities, lesbian and gay studies have not. He blamed institutionalized fear of alienating alumni of private universities, or legislators who fund public ones. The five-year program ended in 2006.

In June 2009, Harvard University announced that it would establish an endowed chair in LGBT studies. Believing the post to be &quot;the first professorship of its kind in the country,&quot; Harvard President Drew G. Faust called it &quot;an important milestone.&quot; Funded by a $1.5 million gift from the members and supporters of the Harvard Gay &amp; Lesbian Caucus, the F. O. Matthiessen Visiting Professorship of Gender and Sexuality is named for a mid-20th century gay Harvard American studies scholar and literary critic who chaired the undergraduate program in history and literature. Harvard Board of Overseers member Mitchell L. Adams said, &quot;This is an extraordinary moment in Harvard&#x27;s history and in the history of this rapidly emerging field ... And because of Harvard&#x27;s leadership in academia and the world, this gift will foster continued progress toward a more inclusive society.&quot;

===Academic field of queer studies===

The concept of perverse presentism is often taught in queer studies classes at universities. This is the understanding that queer history cannot and should not be analyzed through contemporary perspectives. Ways to find out how people historically identified can include studying queer community archives.

While queer studies initially emerged in the North American and, to a lesser extent, European academy and mostly relates to Western contexts, it recently has also developed in other parts of the world. For instance, since the 2000s there has been an emergent field of Queer African Studies, with leading scholars such as Stella Nyanzi (Uganda), Keguro Macharia (Kenya), Zethu Matebeni (South Africa), S.N. Nyeck (Cameroon), Kwame E. Otu (Ghana), and Gibson Ncube (Zimbabwe) contributing to the development of this field. Their work critiques the eurocentric orientation of Western queer studies and examines the longstanding traditions of sexual and gender diversity, ambiguity, and fluidity in African cultures and societies.

==Queer studies at non-U.S. universities==
===Brazil===
At Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (UFMG) in Brazil, there are many initiatives on Queer Studies. UFMG offers a multidisciplinary program on Gender and Sexuality for undergrad students: &quot;Formação Transversal em Gênero e Sexualidade: Perspective Queer/LGBTI&quot; (https://www.ufmg.br/prograd/). In its Faculty of Law, ranked amongst the best in the country, Marcelo Maciel Ramos established in 2014 &quot;Diverso UFMG - Legal Division of Gender and Sexual Diversity&quot; (www.diversoufmg.com) and a study group on Gender, Sexuality and Law, which is now led also by Pedro Nicoli. Diverso UFMG organizes since 2016 the Congress of Gender and Sexual Diversity (Congresso de Diversidade Sexual e de Gênero: ) that has become one of the biggest and most important academic events on Women and LGBT studies in Brazil. At the Faculty of Philosophy and Social Sciences, Marco Aurélio Máximo Prado has been running since 2007 Nuh UFMG (Human Rights and LGBT Citizenship Division), a successful initiative on LGBT studies. Scholars who focus on queer studies at other universities in Brazil include Luiz Mott and Moisés Lino e Silva, among others who write on LGBT rights in Brazil and on LGBT history in Brazil.

===China===
Fudan University, located in Shanghai, China, opened the country&#x27;s first course on homosexuality and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) prevention in 2003 entitled &quot;Homosexual Health Social Sciences&quot;. In an article focusing on this college course, Gao and Gu utilize feedback from participants, detailed interviews with professors, and a review of course documents to discuss China&#x27;s first course with homosexuality at its core. Their article analyzes the tactics used to create such a course and the strategies used to protect the course from adverse reactions in the press. The authors especially take note of the effects of the course on its attendees and the wider gay community in China. The authors note that &quot;Homosexual Health Social Sciences&quot; was described as a &quot;breakthrough&quot; by &quot;South China Morning Post&quot; and &quot;Friends&#x27; Correspondence&quot;, a periodical for gay health intervention. Surveys were given to attendees of the class and many responded that the class helped them understand the homosexual perspective better. One student stated, &quot;Even if we cannot fully understand these people, we need to respect them. That is the basis for real communication.&quot; Many of the course attendees admitted that the course changed their lives. One Chinese police officer who had been hiding his sexuality his entire life stated, &quot;The course really enhanced my quality of life...&quot; Another man who had been prescribed treatment for his homosexuality for 30 years heard talk of the course in a newspaper and expressed, &quot;This precious news has relieved my heart.&quot;

&quot;Homosexual Health Social Sciences&quot; was developed to be interdisciplinary to cover the social sciences, humanities, and public health. Interdependence on different academic focuses was achieved in the curriculum by covering &quot;Theories of homosexuality and Chinese reality&quot;, &quot;homosexual sub-culture&quot; and &quot;Men seeking men (MSM) intervention in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention,&quot; in addition to reading literature with gay characters and themes and taking field trips to a gay bar. The article goes on to describe the attendance of this course and its significance by clarifying that the official registration in the class was low, with only one student in 2003 and two in 2004. Officially registered students were not the only people attending the classes, though, because the course was open to the general public. The average attendance in 2003 was 89.9 and rose to 114 in 2004.

Gao and Gu also reveal the precautions taken by the creators of the course to shelter the new class from harsh criticism. The authors depict the creators&#x27; fear of attracting too much negative attention from the Chinese media could adversely affect the course and its continuation. Most coverage of this course at Fudan University was delivered in English at the beginning. This phenomenon was explained by one journalist from China Radio International—Homosexuality is very sensitive issue in Chinese culture so by discussing it in English, it is distanced from the conservative Chinese culture. Fudan University led Chinese academia to develop a more comprehensive curriculum that will educate future health care professionals on the needs of more Chinese citizens.

=== South Africa ===
On the African continent, South Africa has been setting the trend of developing queer studies. This is partly due to the country&#x27;s constitutional framework, which explicitly protects against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. One of the leading South African queer studies scholars Zethu Matebeni, who is an activist, writer, documentary film maker, and academic, working as Professor and South Africa Research Chair in Sexualities, Genders and Queer Studies at the University of Fort Hare. She curated the volume &quot;Reclaiming Afrikan: Queer Perspectives on Sexual and Gender Identities&quot; (2014) and co-edited the book &quot;Queer in Africa: LGBTQI Identities, Citizenship, and Activism&quot; (2018).

== Present-day issues in the US ==
The US Supreme Court has made gay marriage legal, but, as a result, the discourse has shifted from the issue of legalizing gay marriage to attacking queer studies and prohibiting certain conversations around the queer community. Attempts are now being made in school settings to prohibit teachers from encouraging same-sex relationships and sex before marriage, therefore leaving same-sex relationships outside the definition of marriage. This also results in a regulation on the education of safe sex, HIV, and AIDS.

In recent years, homophobic curriculum laws have continued to be present in schools across the US. In 2017, studies showed that 20 states had implemented anti-gay laws affecting school curriculums. These included laws that made it mandatory for teachers to educate from an anti-gay standpoint and ones that gave teachers the freedom to choose between using these homophobic curriculums or not including sex education in their curriculum at all. Many states also have curriculum laws that require teachers to educate their students from the viewpoint that abstinence before marriage is the sole option for safe prevention against pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases. With an emphasis on abstinence before marriage, this often excludes same-sex couples due to their absence from the definition of marriage in their state.

=== Book bans ===
In 2022, an estimated 5,000 books featuring LGBTQ characters and stories have been banned from bookshelves, libraries, and classrooms according to a report by PEN America. Their research shows that 41% of books banned featured queer protagonists or secondary characters, 40% featured protagonists or secondary characters of color, and 22% featured sexual content. Regardless of topic, 40% of these book bans are estimated to be in direct result of lawmakers&#x27; public opinion and presence, as well as enacted legislation. PEN America also reports that the overwhelming majority of these titles are books for young adults, restricting education relating to gender, sexuality, diversity, and differences from 13 to 17 years old. PEN America also reports that 96% of these bans were put into place against the National Coalition Against Censorship and ALA&#x27;s guidelines.

PEN America reports that Maia Kokabe&#x27;s &quot;Gender Queer: A Memoir&quot; is the most banned title, with bans in 30 districts. Kokabe&#x27;s memoir discusses their experience growing up feeling outside of the gender binary and not feeling like they fit into their body. It follows parts of Kokabe&#x27;s childhood into their early adult years and experiences coming to terms with their gender identity and coming out. &quot;Gender Queer&quot; was met with a contrast of responses, many expressing gratitude and love for the sharing of their story, as it was written with an audience of family, friends, and those that can identify and sympathize with Kokabe in mind. Others claimed the book is too sexually explicit, specifically in its illustrations which include that of the human body, but no sex scenes. In an interview with NPR, Kokabe discusses how they felt they included the appropriate amount of illustrations to tell their story accurately and due to their importance in the representation of their journey with gender and sexuality. They also express their stance that they illustrated the book in a much less explicit manner than it could have been had it been written by a different author.

Attempts to educate and fight against these book bans have been taking place across the country. Free libraries, library pop-ups, and book giveaways have been go-to methods for grassroots organizations and activists to make banned books accessible. Little Free Library members install wooden curbside mini-library boxes and fill them with books of their choice. These books are available to take for free for any passers by. In 2022, the organization reported 140,000 Little Free Libraries had been installed across the nation, with 87% of their owners stating that they make banned books available in their boxes. Bookstore owners and booksellers have been taking actions into their own hands and giving their books away, covering some costs out of their own pocket and gaining donations both in person and through social media. Authors and publishers have started taking similar actions, carrying around their own books, handing them out, and donating to free libraries. While in most cases a book ban hurts the book&#x27;s sale rate and the author&#x27;s exposure, some bans result in higher publicity and recognition, like in the case of &quot;All Boys Aren&#x27;t Blue&quot; by George M. Johnson, now a bestseller. The publicity of its ban put it on the radar of many readers who would otherwise have never found it, and it is now in its 10th printing. In an increasingly accessible digital age, digital libraries and book websites are also making banned books more accessible. Free library apps, like the Brooklyn Public Library, allow digital library cards and access to readers which can be used from any device anywhere in the country.

=== &quot;Don&#x27;t Say Gay&quot; bill or act ===
The Florida Parental Rights in Education Act (HB 1557), also known as &quot;Don&#x27;t Say Gay&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Say Gay or Trans&quot;, was signed by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis on March 28, 2022. The act prohibits public schools from discussing sensitive topics such as sex education, gender identity, and sexual orientation in grades kindergarten through third grade, and prohibits any discussion deemed to be not age-appropriate by state standards. The act does not specify what is inappropriate or who makes this decision. This act also includes restrictions on a public school&#x27;s ability to protect and maintain the privacy of a student&#x27;s gender identity or sexual orientation from their parents. As a result, school counselors will be limited in how they serve as a confidential resource for students. The act also gives parents the right to sue the school district if they feel their rights have been violated. On May 17, 2023, DeSantis signed a new bill expanding his measures on LGBTQ education in schools in the state of Florida, including lengthening the prohibition of sex and gender topics in kindergarten through eighth grade, as well as restricting these topics in sixth through twelfth. The bill also requires that schools teach &quot;that sex is determined by biology and reproductive function at birth; that biological males impregnate biological females by fertilizing the female egg with male sperm; that the female then gestates the offspring; and that these reproductive roles are binary, stable, and unchangeable.&quot;

There has been an increase in protests as students and parents across the country respond negatively to the bill, as some assert that the broad language is meant to specifically target the LGBTQ community. As a result, some public schools have punished and suspended students for staging demonstrations on campus. Other educators have faced backlash for showing support for the LGBTQ community, such as discussions about gender identity in class and showing movies or documentaries that showed openly gay characters. Some have been censored, suspended, and even fired. Equality Florida, an LGBTQ group that is currently suing the DeSantis administration for the proposed law, argues that it marks an &quot;extraordinary government intrusion on the free speech and equal protection rights&quot; in public schools.

The discourse surrounding this legislation also resulted in backlash from The Walt Disney Co. employees, who shared their disappointment with the company on social media for not publicly denouncing the bill. According to Disney CEO Bob Chapek, Disney leaders were opposed to the bill &quot;from the outset, but we chose not to take a public position on it because we thought we could be more effective working behind-the-scenes, engaging directly with lawmakers — on both sides of the aisle.&quot; He has stated that Disney has pledged 5 million dollars to the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) in support of protecting LGBTQ rights, but the HRC has declined to accept the money until they further their commitment to supporting the LGBTQ community.

On February 1, 2023, College Board, the organization that is responsible for creating standardized tests such as the SAT and AP, revealed the changes that it made to its African American studies course. This came after Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and the Republican party condemned the class and banned the original version from Florida schools. The new version is without names of major events in contemporary history, mention of the Black Lives Matter movement, black feminism, black queer theory, critical race theory, or intersectionality. According to a College Board representative, however, &quot;To be clear, no states or districts have seen the official framework that will be released on February 1, much less provided feedback on it.&quot; However, College Board has historically given in to many conservative leaders&#x27; demands in other courses, such as AP United States History, where readings would focus less on colonial settlers&#x27; harm towards indigenous people and more on founding fathers and their religious influences.

Since 2021, 42 different versions of the &quot;Don&#x27;t Say Gay&quot; bill have been proposed in 22 state legislatures, including Arkansas, Georgia, Indiana, and many others. All of these bills similarly prohibit discussion and inclusion of LGBTQ related topics. These bills are also associated with many other bans that have taken place in Florida and many other states, such as bans on gender-affirming medical care, pride flags in public places, drag shows, and others.

=== Intersectionality ===
As more and more universities and schools begin to add more resources and classes for students to take about queer studies, there is also a growing recognition that gender, sex, and identity also coincide with race, nationalities, class, disabilities, etc. This overlap is also known as &quot;intersectionality&quot;, a word that has roots in black feminist activism. This term was coined by Columbia professor and activist Kimberlé Crenshaw. According to Crenshaw, &quot;Intersectionality is a lens through which you can see where power comes and collides, where it interlocks and intersects. It&#x27;s not simply that there&#x27;s a race problem here, a gender problem here, and a class or LBGTQ problem there. Many times that framework erases what happens to people who are subject to all of these things.&quot; The word intersectionality was added to the Oxford Dictionary in 2015.

While this was originally used as a term to describe the specific type of oppression that African American women face, it has grown relevant to many other groups of people. According to them, &quot;The theory of &#x27;intersectionality&#x27; — which posits that individuals simultaneously experience oppression based on multiple social categorizations, and that this oppression is multiplicative — has made queer studies more inclusive.&quot; The idea of intersectionality came to be after second-wave feminism, which is thought to only benefit straight, white, middle-class women. Third-wave feminism became the springboard for intersectionality when there became an awareness that women faced different types of oppression based on their race, gender, and class. Kimberlé Crenshaw maintains the fact that the idea of intersectionality and true feminism is lost if black women continue to be overshadowed by their white counterparts. The idea of intersectionality began when discussing feminism but has become relevant in many other subjects, such as LGBTQ discrimination.

<doc id="149380" wikidata="Q973755" url="?curid=149380" title="Dave Williams (singer)">
<text>David Wayne Williams (February 29, 1972 – August 14, 2002) was an American singer best known as the original lead vocalist for the rock band Drowning Pool.

== Biography ==
He grew up in Princeton, Texas, living with his parents Charles Edward and Jo-Ann Williams. He grew up in a pious family which caused him to move away from religion. Notably, he also used to wear a T-shirt that read &quot;Worship Satan and Smoke Crack&quot;. He idolized David Lee Roth and Vince Neil for their public personas.

In 1999, he joined Drowning Pool, which had formed in 1996 and had previously performed as an instrumental three-piece. The band released their debut album with Williams, &quot;Sinner&quot;, in 2001. Williams soon gained recognition for his performances with the band; his nickname &quot;Stage&quot; came from Pantera guitarist Dimebag Darrell, who gave it to him because of his known stage personality.

==Death==
On August 14, 2002, Williams was found dead in the band&#x27;s tour bus in Manassas, Virginia. The band was traveling with Ozzfest and set to play in nearby Bristow the next day. An autopsy established that he had died from heart failure caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (heart muscle disease), which went undiagnosed until his death.

A public funeral was held in Plano, Texas, on August 18, 2002, at 2:00 P.M. A DVD titled &quot;Sinema&quot; has since been released, chronicling his life. His lifelong dream was to buy his parents a house; the sales from &quot;Sinner&quot; fulfilled his dream posthumously.

Williams&#x27;s microphone was given to Cristian Machado from Ill Niño. They were good friends, so Drowning Pool and Williams&#x27; family gave it to Machado as a token of respect after his death.

==Legacy==
The Dallas, Texas music community honored Williams and his legacy with a multi-venue music festival named &quot;Stage Fest&quot;. Stage Fest was held in downtown Dallas&#x27; Deep Ellum district on August 14, 2007, the fifth anniversary of his death, and played in seven Deep Ellum venues including Club Dada, The Curtain Club, The Lizard Lounge, The Darkside Lounge, Red Blood Club, Reno&#x27;s Chop Shop, and Tomcat&#x27;s.

One of Williams&#x27;s previous bands, Fugly, digitally released an album dedicated to him in 2008.

On August 14, 2012, the 10th anniversary of his death, Drowning Pool released the ballad &quot;In Memory Of...&quot; dedicated to him.

For the 13th anniversary of &quot;Sinner&quot;, Bicycle Music Company released previously unreleased footage of Dave Williams and his bandmates answering questions about music, movies, and the Sinner album via their YouTube channel.

České Budějovice 5 forms an exclave of the municipal territory.

==Etymology==
The name Budějovice is derived from personal Slavic name Budivoj, meaning &quot;the village of Budivoj&#x27;s people&quot;. The name first appeared as &quot;Budoywicz&quot;, then it appeared in various similar forms. The German name was created by transcribing and shortening the Czech name. When the royal city was founded in 1265, the name appeared as &quot;Budwoyz&quot; and then it was adapted to &quot;Budweis&quot;. The name &quot;Budvicium&quot; was used in Latin. After the Hussite revolution in the first half of the 15th century, the name &quot;České Budějovice&quot; (&quot;Bohemian Budějovice&quot;) appeared to distinguish it from Moravské Budějovice (&quot;Moravian Budějovice&quot;).

==Geography==
České Budějovice is located about south of Prague. It lies in the České Budějovice Basin, only a small eastern part of the municipal territory extends into the Třeboň Basin. The city is spread mostly across a plain making it nearly flat in the inner parts with hillier areas in the eastern suburbs. The highest point, located in the city&#x27;s exclave, is at above sea level. The main part of the municipal territory does not exceed .

České Budějovice is situated in the valley of the Vltava River, at its confluence with the Malše. A set of large fishponds is located in the northwestern part of the municipal territory. The largest pond is Novohaklovský rybník with an area of . Several of the ponds lies within the nature reserve of Vrbenské rybníky.

===Climate===
České Budějovice has a cooler and wet inland version of a humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dfb&quot;; Trewartha: &quot;Dcbo&quot;) with an average annual temperature of . There are four seasons, with a murky dry winter between early December and early March, a sunny and wetter spring between half of March up to half of May changing to a rainy and warm summer during late May and early September when a dry autumn lasting to late November begins. There are between 1,550 and 1,800 hours of sunshine in most years. The extreme temperature throughout the year ranged from on 11 February 1929 to on 27 July 1983, the extreme minimum temperature was also the lowest ever recorded in the Czech Republic.

==History==

===13th–18th centuries===

The first written mention of Budějovice is from 1251, when it was only a village. The royal city was founded on its site by King Ottokar II in 1265. The siting and planning of the city was carried out by the king&#x27;s knight Hirzo. The city was fortified and had three gates. It immediately became the political and economic capital of south Bohemia. The city quickly became rich thanks to the development of trade and crafts and thanks to silver mining in the nearby area. The German-speaking settlers were coming from the Bohemian Forest and Upper Austria.

In 1341, King John of Bohemia allowed Jewish families to reside within the city walls. The first synagogue was built in 1380. At the turn of the 15th and 16th centuries, the Jewish community had about 100 inhabitants. In 1505–1506, a pogrom occurred and the Jews were expelled from the city. During the 16th century, the number of German craftsmen in the city increased. In the 18th century, Germans became the majority.

The city&#x27;s fortifications were able to resist the Hussites during the Hussite Wars, but the city&#x27;s development was disrupted by the Thirty Years&#x27; War and an extensive fire in 1641, during which two-thirds of the city was destroyed. Reconstructions in the Baroque style, which took place in the following decades, changed the architectural character of the city. In 1785, Pope Pius VI founded the Roman Catholic Diocese of České Budějovice and the Church of Saint Nicholas was promoted to a cathedral.

===19th–20th centuries===
In the 19th century, the city was industrialized. During his time, České Budějovice became a major trade hub. The Budweis–Linz Horse-Drawn Railway was built in 1825–1832 and became the second oldest public line in continental Europe (after the Saint-Étienne-Andrézieux line in France). The production of Koh-i-Noor Hardtmuth pencils was relocated from Vienna to České Budějovice in 1847. Aside from Hardtmuth brothers, Adalbert Lanna the Elder belonged among the city&#x27;s most prominent industrialists of the 19th century. In 1895, &quot;Český akciový pivovar&quot; (later known as Budweiser Budvar Brewery) was founded.

From 1848 until World War II, there was again a Jewish community here, which in 1925 numbered over 1,400 people. The city remained a German-speaking enclave until 1880, after which Czechs became the majority. Until the end of World War II, the city contained a significant German minority (about 15.5% in 1930). The ratios between the Germans and the Czechs were in 1880: 11,829 Germans to 11,812 Czechs, in 1890: 11,642 to 16,585, in 1900: 15,436 to 23,427, in 1910: 16,903 to 27,309 and in 1921: 7,415 to 35,800. The reason for the change in the ratio was the high increase in the city&#x27;s population, mainly caused by newly immigrated Czechs. The share of Germans fell below the legal limit of 20% and thus the Czech language became the only official language.

The coexistence of Czechs and Germans was mostly peaceful, which changed only in the 1930s, when most of Germans tended to Nazism. During the Occupation of Czechoslovakia in 1939–1945, the city was part of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. There was said to be established then a Gestapo prison and a forced labour camp in the city. During the final stages of World War II, in March 1945, České Budějovice was significantly damaged by United States Army Air Forces raids on strategic locations. At the end of the war, on 9 or 10 May 1945, Soviet troops occupied the city. The almost entire German population, which numbered 6,000 people, was then expelled under the Beneš decrees.

==Demographics==

==Economy==
České Budějovice is the economic centre of the entire South Bohemian Region and the seat of many large corporations. The largest employers with its headquarters in České Budějovice and at least 1,000 employees are:

The České Budějovice agglomeration was defined as a tool for drawing money from the European Structural and Investment Funds. It is an area that includes the city and its surroundings, linked to the city by commuting and migration. It has about 180,000 inhabitants.

===Beer brewing===


Since its foundation in the 13th century, České Budějovice has been well known for brewing. In 1351, they obtained the so-called &quot;mile right&quot; from the king, i.e. that no pubs outside the city can be located within a radius of 10 km, and from 1410, not even breweries. For a time, the town was the imperial brewery for the Holy Roman Emperor, and &quot;Budweiser Bier&quot; (i.e. beer from Budweis) became, along with &quot;Pilsner&quot; from Plzeň, one of the best-known lagers. Brewing remains a major industry.

The largest brewery, founded in 1895, is Budweiser Budvar, which has legal rights to market its beer under the &quot;Budweiser&quot; brand name in much of Europe. The same product is also sold elsewhere under the names &quot;Budvar&quot; and &quot;Czechvar&quot; due to legal disagreements with Anheuser-Busch over the Budweiser brand and Anheuser-Busch sells its beer as &quot;Bud&quot; in most of the European Union. The American lager was originally brewed as an imitation of the famous Bohemian original, but over time has developed its own identity and attained remarkable commercial success. Anheuser-Busch has made offers to buy out the Czech brewing company in order to secure global rights to the name &quot;Budweiser&quot;, but the Czech government has refused all such offers, regarding the Czech Budweiser name as a matter of national pride.

The oldest operating and second largest brewery, founded in 1795, was renamed to &quot;Pivovar Samson&quot;, replacing its original German name &quot;Budweiser Bürgerbräu&quot; during the communist period. It also exported, mostly under the &quot;Samson&quot; and &quot;Crystal&quot; labels. Recently, they reacquired naming rights for Budweiser for Europe while offering &quot;B. B. Bürgerbräu&quot; in the US since 2005.

==Transport==

The European route E55 (the section from Prague to the Czech-Austrian border at Dolní Dvořiště) passes through České Budějovice. The section from Prague to České Budějovice is formed by the D3 motorway. The section from České Budějovice to the Czech-Austrian border is formed by the I/3 road. The second notable road connection is the I/20 road (part of the European route E49), which connects České Budějovice with Plzeň and Karlovy Vary.

Direct international railways were built via České Budějovice by the Czech-Austrian companies Emperor Franz Joseph Railway in 1868 and Empress Elisabeth Railway in 1871, connecting Vienna with Plzeň and Prague with Zürich, via Linz and Salzburg. Today, the most important lines in operation are Prague–České Budějovice, České Budějovice–Linz and Plzeň–Jihlava. The city is served by four train stations.

Intra-city transport is provided by buses and trolleybuses. Buses provide 16 lines (including 3 electric buses) and trolleybuses provide 7 lines. The transport company is owned by the city.

==Culture==
The most important annual event in the city is the Země Živitelka (&#x27;Earth the Breadwinner&#x27;) exhibition. It is focused on agriculture and food industry. It takes place in the Výstaviště České Budějovice area, which is the largest area for holding exhibitions, cultural and social events in the city. Země Živitelka has been held regularly since 1973 and followed up on the exhibitions held here in 1960 and 1970.

Most of the houses have a Gothic core.

In the middle of the square is Samson Fountain. It is a Baroque fountain built in 1721–1727, which is the largest fountain in the Czech Republic with a diameter of . Originally, it was not only decorative, but also served to supply the city with water from the Vltava river. Next to the fountain is the so-called Lost Rock, the only remnant of the original pavement.

The City Hall is the most distinctive house on the square. It was originally a Renaissance house from the mid-16th century, completely rebuilt in the Baroque style in 1727–1730 according to the design of Anton Erhard Martinelli. The façade with three towers is decorated with four allegorical sculptures. On the highest tower there is a carillon from 1995. The City Hall still serves its purpose today, but it also offers guided tours.

===Sacral monuments===

The Dominican monastery with the Church of the Presentation of the Blessed Virgin Mary are the oldest monuments in the historic centre of České Budějovice. The monastery was founded in 1265 together with the city. The originally Gothic buildings were rebuilt in the Baroque style. The monastery was abolished in 1785.

===Museums===

The Museum of South Bohemia was founded in 1870 and opened to the public in 1877 in a house next to the city hall. The current museum was built in

<text>Jean-André Deluc or de Luc (8 February 1727 – 7 November 1817) was a geologist, natural philosopher and meteorologist from the Republic of Geneva. He also devised measuring instruments.

== Biography ==
Jean-André Deluc was born in Geneva. His family had come to the Republic of Geneva from Lucca, Italy, in the 15th century. His mother was Françoise Huaut. His father, Jacques-François Deluc, had written in refutation of Bernard Mandeville and other rationalistic writers, but he was also a decided supporter of Jean-Jacques Rousseau.

As a student of Georges-Louis Le Sage, Jean-André Deluc received a basic education in mathematics and in natural philosophy. He engaged early in business, which occupied a large part of his first adult years, with the exception of scientific investigation in the Alps. With the help of his brother Guillaume-Antoine, he built a splendid collection of mineralogy and fossils.

Deluc also took part in politics. In 1768, sent on an embassy to the duc de Choiseul in Paris, he succeeded in gaining the duke&#x27;s friendship. In 1770 he became a member of the Council of Two Hundred in Geneva.

Three years later, business reverses forced him to leave his native town; he returned, briefly, only once. The change freed him for non-scientific pursuits; with little regret he moved to Great Britain in 1773, where he was appointed reader to Queen Charlotte, a position he held for forty-four years and that afforded him both leisure and income.

Despite his duties at court, he was given leave to make several tours of Switzerland, France, Holland and Germany. At the beginning of his German tour (1798–1804), he was distinguished with an honorary professorship of philosophy and geology at the University of Göttingen, which helped to cover diplomatic missions for the king George III. Back to Britain, he undertook a geological tour of the country (1804–1807).

In 1773 Deluc was made a fellow of the Royal Society; he was a correspondent of the French Academy of Sciences and a member of several other learned societies. He died at Windsor, Berkshire, England, in 1817, after nearly 70 years of research. Deluc, an impact crater on the Moon, was given his name.

== Scientific contributions ==

=== Observations and theory ===
Deluc&#x27;s main interests were geology and meteorology; Georges Cuvier mentions him as an authority on the former subject. His major geological work, &quot;Lettres physiques et morales sur les montagnes et sur l&#x27;histoire de la terre et de l&#x27;homme&quot; (6 vol., 1778–1780), was dedicated to Queen Charlotte. He published volumes on geological travels: in northern Europe (1810), in England (1811), and in France, Switzerland and Germany (1813).

Deluc noticed the disappearance of heat in the thawing of ice about the same time that Joseph Black made it the foundation of his hypothesis of latent heat. He ascertained that water was densest at about 5 °C (and not at the freezing temperature). He was the originator of the theory, later reactivated by John Dalton, that the quantity of water vapour contained in any space is independent of the presence or density of the air, or of any other elastic fluid.

His book &quot;Lettres sur l&#x27;histoire physique de la terre&quot; (Paris, 1798), addressed to Johann Friedrich Blumenbach, develops a theory of the Earth divided into six periods modelled on the six days of Creation. It contains an essay on the existence of a General Principle of Morality and gives an interesting account of conversations with Voltaire and Rousseau. Deluc was an ardent admirer of Francis Bacon, on whose writings he published two works: &quot;Bacon tel qu&#x27;il est&quot; (Berlin, 1800), showing the bad faith of the French translator, who had omitted many passages favorable to revealed religion, and &quot;Précis de la philosophie de Bacon&quot; (2 vols 8vo, Paris, 1802), giving an interesting view of the progress of natural science. &quot;Lettres sur le christianisme&quot; (Berlin and Hanover, 1803) was a controversial correspondence with Wilhelm Abraham Teller of Berlin in regard to the Mosaic cosmogony. His &quot;Traité élémentaire de géologie&quot; (Paris, 1809, translated into English by Henry de la Fite the same year) was principally intended as a refutation of James Hutton and John Playfair. They had shown that geology was driven by the operation of internal heat and erosion, but their system required much more time than Deluc&#x27;s Mosaic variety of neptunism allowed.

Many other papers were in the &quot;Journal de Physique&quot;, in the &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot; and in the &quot;Philosophical Magazine&quot;.

=== Instruments ===
Deluc dedicated a large part of his activity to perfecting or inventing measuring instruments.

He devised a portable barometer for use in geological expeditions. His &quot;Recherches sur les modifications de l&#x27;atmosphère&quot; (2 vols. 4to, Geneva, 1772; 2nd ed., 4 vols. Paris, 1784) contain experiments on moisture, evaporation and the indications of hygrometers and thermometers. He applied the barometer to the determination of heights. The &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot; published his account of a new hygrometer, which resembled a mercurial thermometer, with an ivory bulb, which expanded by moisture, and caused the mercury to descend. He later devised a whalebone hygrometer which sparked a bitter controversy with Horace-Bénédict de Saussure, himself inventor of a hair hygrometer. He gave the first correct rules for measuring heights with the help of a barometer.

Based on his experiments in 1772, Deluc advocated the use of mercury, instead of alcohol or other fluids, in thermometers, as its volume varies the most linearly with the method of mixtures. In detail, if two portions of water of equal masses A, B were mixed, and let the resulting water be C, and if we immerse a thermometer in A, B, C, we obtain lengths formula_1. Deluc expected that formula_2, and similarly for other ratios of mixtures. He found that thermometers made using mercury allowed the closest fit to his expectation of linearity.

In 1809 he sent a long paper to the Royal Society on separating the chemical from the electrical effect of the dry pile, a form of Voltaic pile, with a description of the electric column and aerial electroscope, in which he advanced opinions contradicting the latest discoveries of the day; they were deemed inappropriate to admit into the &quot;Transactions&quot;. The dry column described by Deluc was constructed by various scientists and his improvement of the dry pile has been regarded as his most important work, although he was not in fact its inventor. He was a valued mentor to the young Francis Ronalds, who published several papers on dry piles in 1814–15.

===Scriptural and observational data===
The last decades of Deluc&#x27;s life were occupied with theological considerations. In his controversy with Hutton, &quot;while never arguing that Hutton was an atheist, Deluc did accuse him of failing to counter atheism sufficiently&quot;.

He took care in reconciling observational data and the Scriptures considered as a description of the history of the world. In his &quot;Lettres physiques et morales&quot; he explained the six days of the creation as epochs preceding the current state of the globe, and attributed the deluge to the filling up of cavities in the interior of the earth.

The subject is discussed at length by Martina Kölbl-Ebert in &quot;Geology and Religion&quot;.

<text>Hubert Howe Bancroft (May 5, 1832 – March 2, 1918) was an American historian and ethnologist who wrote, published, and collected works concerning the Western United States, Texas, California, Alaska, Mexico, Central America, and British Columbia.

==Early life==
Hubert Howe Bancroft was born on May 5, 1832, in Granville, Ohio, to Azariah Ashley Bancroft and Lucy Howe Bancroft. The Howe and Bancroft families originally hailed from the New England states of Vermont and Massachusetts, respectively. Bancroft&#x27;s parents were staunch abolitionists and the family home was a station on the Underground Railroad.

Bancroft attended the Doane Academy in Granville for a year, and he then became a clerk in his brother-in-law&#x27;s bookstore in Buffalo, New York.
==Move to California==
In March 1852, Bancroft was provided with an inventory of books to sell and was sent to the booming California city of San Francisco to set up a West Coast regional office of the firm. Bancroft was successful in building his company, entering the world of publishing in the process. He also became a serious collector of books, building a collection numbering into the tens of thousands of volumes.

In 1868, he resigned from his business in favor of his brother, A.L. Bancroft. He had accumulated a great library of historical material and abandoned business to devote himself entirely to writing and publishing history.

Bancroft&#x27;s library consisted of books, maps, and printed and manuscript documents, including a large number of narratives dictated to Bancroft or his assistants by pioneers, settlers, and statesmen. The indexing of the vast collection employed six persons for ten years. The library was moved in 1881 to a fireproof building and, in 1900, numbered about 45,000 volumes.

He developed a plan to publish a history in 39 volumes of the entire Pacific coast region of North America, from Central America to Alaska. He employed writers and wrote some of the material himself, though he credited only himself as an author. In 1886, the publishing establishment of A.L. Bancroft &amp; Company burned, and the sheets of seven volumes of the history he had written were destroyed.

==Personal life==
Bancroft&#x27;s first marriage was to Emily Ketchum in 1859. They had one child, a daughter named Kate who was born in 1859. Emily died in childbirth in 1869. In 1879, Bancroft married his second wife, Matilda Coley Griffing, with whom he had four children.

Although he never graduated from college, in 1875 Bancroft was awarded an honorary Master of Arts degree from Yale in recognition of his massive historical work on &quot;Native Races of the Pacific States.&quot; He was also elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1875.

==Death==
He died on March 2, 1918, at his country home in Walnut Creek, California. &quot;Acute peritonitis&quot; was blamed as the cause of death in published
newspaper reports. Bancroft was 85 at his death. His body was interred in the Cypress Lawn Memorial Park in Colma, California.

==Legacy==

In the late 19th century, it was determined that much of the work of which Bancroft claimed authorship had in fact been written by others. This tainted his legacy in the eyes of some scholars, on the principle &quot;false in one thing, false in all.&quot; The &quot;Salt Lake Tribune&quot; called him a &quot;purloiner of other peoples&#x27; brains&quot; in 1893.

The Bancroft Library at UC Berkeley, reflects the collector&#x27;s name. The University of California purchased his 60,000-volume book collection in 1905. 
In 1885 Bancroft purchased a ranch with an adobe cottage located in Spring Valley, in San Diego County, as a retirement home. The Hubert H. Bancroft Ranch House is now a National Historic Landmark. In addition, part of a property Bancroft bought around 1880 in Contra Costa County, California, later became the Ruth Bancroft Garden, when three acres of the remaining farm land was given by Bancroft&#x27;s grandson Philip to his wife, Ruth Bancroft.

Several schools are named for Bancroft, including Bancroft Middle School (Long Beach, California), Bancroft Middle School (Los Angeles, California), Hubert H. Bancroft Elementary School in Sacramento, California, Bancroft Middle School in San Leandro, California, Bancroft Elementary School in Walnut Creek, California, and Bancroft Community School in Spring Valley, California.

Contrary to some sources, including Bancroft&#x27;s own obituary, Bancroft Way in Berkeley, California is not named for Hubert Howe Bancroft, but rather for historian and statesman George Bancroft.

An archive of Bancroft family correspondence, collected by his daughter Kate, is held in Special Collections and Archives at Geisel Library at the University of California, San Diego.

&quot;Recollections of Hubert Howe Bancroft and the Bancroft Family&quot;, an oral history interview with Margaret Wood Bancroft, widow of Bancroft&#x27;s son Griffing, is held in the Oral History Center of the Bancroft Library at the University of California, Berkeley.

* &quot;Why a World Centre of Industry at San Francisco Bay&quot; (1916)
* &quot;In These Latter Days&quot; (1917)

===Note on production methods===
Bancroft made use of index cards in the organization and compilation of facts for his lengthy and massive series of historical volumes. In the course of his organization of source material and writing, Bancroft made use of scores of research assistants, the contributions of some of whom amounted to the output of co-writers.

Originally he seems to have intended to use topical sections of writing produced by his assistants as the basis of a broad narrative which he himself would write, but as the work progressed he came to use the statements as they were, with only slight changes. He said his assistants were capable investigators, and there is evidence that some of them deserved his confidence; Frances Fuller Victor, in particular, was a well-known author. However, his failure to acknowledge each contribution created doubt about the quality of the work. Overall, although Bancroft considered himself the author of his works, in contemporary terms it is more accurate to consider him an editor and compiler.

Neither Bancroft, nor most of his assistants, had enough training to avoid stating their personal opinions and enthusiasms, but their works were generally well received in their time. Historian Francis Parkman praised Bancroft&#x27;s &quot;The Native Races&quot; in &quot;The North American Review. Lewis Henry Morgan&#x27;s essay, &quot;Montezuma&#x27;s Dinner,&quot; rebuts Lewis Henry Morgan&#x27;s ideas about gradations of civilization. In turn, Morgan&#x27;s essay was based on Friedrick Engel&#x27;s &quot;The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State: in the Light of the Researches of Lewis H. Morgan.&quot; Bancroft critiqued Morgan&#x27;s understanding of stages of civilization and savagery. Both Morgan&#x27;s and Engel&#x27;s ideas are most certainly antiquated and reveal a profound and mechanistic understanding of human development.

<text>Bregenz (; ) is the capital of Vorarlberg, the westernmost state of Austria. The city lies on the east and southeast shores of Lake Constance, the third-largest freshwater lake in Central Europe, between Switzerland in the west and Germany in the northwest.

Bregenz is located on a plateau falling in a series of terraces to the lake at the foot of Pfänder mountain. It is a junction of the arterial roads from the Rhine valley to the German Alpine foothills, with cruise ship services on Lake Constance.

It is famous for the annual summer music festival &quot;Bregenzer Festspiele&quot;, as well as the dance festival &quot;Bregenzer Spring&quot;.

==History==

The first settlements date from 1500 BC. The Brigantii are mentioned by Strabo as a Celtic sub-tribe in this region of the Alps. In the 5th century BC, the Celts settled at Brigantion, which became one of their most heavily fortified locations. After a series of battles in 15 BC, the Romans conquered Brigantion and the city became a Roman camp. It was conferred the status of a municipality (Brigantium) around 50 AD and was the seat of the Roman admiralty for Lake Constance. In 259/60 Brigantium was destroyed by the Alemanni, Germanic peoples who settled in the area in around 450.

From 610 to 612 Saint Columbanus and Saint Gall worked as missionaries in Bregenz. From 917 onwards the castle served as a residence of the Udalrichinger (ruling dynasty of Vorarlberg), who called themselves Counts of Bregenz. The house died out around 1150. The son of the first Ulrich was Saint Gebhard, born in 947. He became the Bishop of Konstanz. In around 1170 Hugo of Tübingen (Montfort) founded a town settlement (first documented in 1249), enlarged it in the 13th and 14th centuries and from 1650 to 1652.

The city was sold in 1451, and again in 1523, to the Habsburgs and continued under Austrian rule, with a brief occupation by Swedish forces under Carl Gustaf Wrangel during the 30 Years&#x27; War, until the 19th century. Bregenz was under Bavarian rule from 1805 to 1814. From 1842 to 1850, the harbour on Lake Constance was built, then enlarged in 1883 and from 1889 to 1891, and Austrian ship service was inaugurated in 1884. Railway services have existed since 1872, and since 1884 across the Arlberg massif.

Since 1726, Bregenz has been the main seat of Austrian administration in Vorarlberg (&quot;Obervogtei&quot;, in 1786 &quot;Kreisamt&quot;, since 1861 seat of the Landtag, since 1918 seat of the Landeshauptmann). Rieden-Vorkloster and Fluh were incorporated into Bregenz in 1919 and 1946, respectively. The town was bombed by the Allies in 1945, and 72 houses were destroyed.

==Culture==

=== Bregenzer Festspiele ===
The annual summer music festival Bregenzer Festspiele is world-famous, taking place in July and August each year on and around a stage on Lake Constance. This festival attracts more than 150,000 people every year to Bregenz (2011: 166,453, 2016: 159,172) and has a budget of around EUR 20 million. The program changes every two years.

In addition to the performances on the lake stage, orchestral concerts and operas also take place in the adjacent festival theatre. There is also a children&#x27;s and youth program during and before the beginning of the festival.

The lake stage (&quot;Seebühne&quot;) is the largest open-air lake stage theatre in the world, with an audience capacity of around 7,000.

=== Bregenz Jazz Festival ===
Since 2014, the Bregenz Jazz Festival has been held every year in June at the Kornmarktplatz.

<doc id="149405" wikidata="Q168912" url="?curid=149405" title="Flag of Sierra Leone">
<text>The national flag of Sierra Leone is a tricolour consisting of three horizontal green, white and blue bands. It was adopted in 1961, Sierra Leone&#x27;s independence year, to replace the British Blue Ensign defaced with the arms of the Crown Colony of Sierra Leone.

==History==
The British first arrived in what is now modern-day Sierra Leone in 1787, when philanthropists and abolitionists acquired of land situated close to Bunce Island for freed slaves. The site of the settlement is where Freetown is now located. It became a crown colony of the United Kingdom within its colonial empire in 1808, Colony of Sierra Leone.
Under colonial rule, Sierra Leone used the British Blue Ensign and defaced it with the arms of the territory. The emblem of Sierra Leone at the time consisted of a circle depicting an elephant, an oil palm tree and mountains, along with the letters &quot;S.L.&quot; standing for the initials of the territory&#x27;s name. Other than the initials, the rest of the emblem&#x27;s design was identical to the colonial arms of the Gold Coast, The Gambia and the Lagos Colony. Sierra Leone was granted its own unique coat of arms in 1914, and the emblem on the Blue Ensign was modified to reflect this change.

In 1960, the College of Arms formulated and then approved of a new flag and coat of arms for Sierra Leone, in anticipation of the colony&#x27;s independence the following year. The arms was designed first, and its predominant colours of green, white, and blue were subsequently used in the creation of the flag. It was first hoisted at midnight on 27 April 1961, the day Sierra Leone became an independent country. Two years later, the government passed a law making it illegal to &quot;insult&quot; the country&#x27;s flag, along with the flags of &quot;friendly&quot; nations.

==Design==
The colours of the flag carry cultural, political, and regional meanings. The green alludes to the country&#x27;s natural resources – specifically agriculture and its mountains. – while the white epitomizes &quot;unity and justice&quot;. The blue evokes the &quot;natural harbour&quot; of Freetown, the capital city of Sierra Leone, as well as the hope of &quot;contributing to world peace&quot; through its usage.

The flag is very similar to that of the official flag of Galápagos Province, Ecuador. The difference between the flags are very insignificant, with Sierra Leone&#x27;s one having a lighter blue and green than that of the Galápagos Province.

It is also very similar to the &quot;Erne flag&quot; used by ships on the Shannon–Erne Waterway in Ireland, except that that flag uses deeper shades of green and blue.

==Legal issues==
The Sierra Leonean flag is utilized as a flag of convenience by foreign merchant vessels. The &quot;minimum enforcement&quot; of admiralty law on such vessels has led to illegal and suspicious activity. This includes unlawful fishing, as well as the usage of the flag on vessels from countries under United Nations sanctions.

As a result, the Sierra Leonean government has taken measures to curtail registrations related to the practice of flag of convenience. In 2010, they stopped allowing fishing vessels to register in order to stymie unauthorized catches within both its domestic waters and in international seas. Two years later, they removed 10 ships from its registry believed to be from Iran. This followed the seizure of a ship in Lebanon that was carrying weapons for Syria and was purportedly flying the flag of Sierra Leone.

In 2015, following the establishment of their International Ship Registry (SLMARAD) which developed various mechanisms, such as due diligence procedure, FSIs and others, and through the ratification of major IMO and ILO Conventions and implementation of such in their Domestic law, the Sierra Leonean government managed to successfully eliminate such incidents.

<text>In gay culture, a bear is a man who is fat, hairy, or both.

The bear concept can function as an identity or an affiliation, and there is ongoing debate in bear communities about what constitutes a bear. Some bears place importance on presenting a clear masculine image and may disdain or shun men who exhibit effeminacy, while others consider acceptance and inclusion of all behavioral types to be an important value of the community.

== History ==
In the mid-1980s, gay men in the San Francisco Bay Area who called themselves &quot;bears&quot; met informally at Bear Hug (sex) parties and via the newly emerging Internet. The term &quot;bear&quot; was popularized by Richard Bulger, who, along with his then-partner Chris Nelson (1960–2006), founded &quot;Bear Magazine&quot; in 1987. George Mazzei wrote an article for &quot;The Advocate&quot; in 1979 called &quot;Who&#x27;s Who in the Zoo?&quot; that characterized gay men as seven types of animals, including bears.

At the onset of the bear movement, some bears separated from the gay community at large, forming &quot;bear clubs&quot; to create social and sexual opportunities of their own. Many clubs are loosely organized social groups; others are modeled on leather biker-patch clubs, with a strict set of bylaws, membership requirements, and charities. Bear clubs often sponsor large yearly events&quot;bear runs&quot; or &quot;bear gatherings&quot;like the annual events such as Southern HiBearNation in Melbourne; Bear Pride and Bear Essentials in Sydney; Bearstock in Adelaide; HiBearNation in St. Louis, Missouri; San Francisco Bear Weekend; CBL&#x27;s Bear Hunt; Bear Pride in Chicago; Atlanta Bear Pride; Texas Bear Round Up in Dallas; Orlando Bear Bash; and Bear Week in Provincetown, Massachusetts (since 2001). Many LGBTQ events attract a significant bear following, such as Southern Decadence in New Orleans.

&quot;Sociology of the Urban Gay Bear&quot;, written by Les K. Wright, was the first article to appear in print, in &quot;Drummer&quot; magazine, edited by Jack Fritscher. Fritscher was the founding editor of San Francisco&#x27;s &quot;California Action Guide&quot; (1982). With &quot;California Action Guide&quot;, Fritscher became the first editor to publish the word &quot;bear&quot; with the gay culture meaning on a magazine cover (November 1982).

As well, with producer Mark Hemry in 1984, Fritscher co-founded the pioneering Palm Drive Video featuring homomasculine entertainment. Palm Drive Video expanded in 1996 to Palm Drive Publishing, San Francisco. For Palm Drive, Fritscher wrote, cast, and directed more than 150 video features. His work includes documentary footage of the first bear contest (Pilsner Inn, February 1987). A bear contest is a feature at many bear events, a sort of masculine beauty pageant awarding titles and sashes (often made of leather) to winners. This footage is no longer for sale as Fritscher declined to shift to DVD format and he closed the video company.
One example of a bear contest was International Mr. Bear, formerly held each February at the International Bear Rendezvous in San Francisco. It attracted contestants, often with local titles, from all over the world. The first International Mr. Bear was held in 1992, and the last was held in 2011. The contest included Bear, Daddy, Cub, and Grizzly titles with the contestant who received the highest score winning the bear title, regardless of what type he was. Example: &quot;Mr. Washington, D.C. Bear, 2006&quot;. Gay &quot;leather-bears&quot; have competed in leather contests, and &quot;muscle-bears&quot; are another subculture noted by their muscular body mass.

The International Bear Brotherhood Flag is the pride flag of the bear community. Craig Byrnes created this flag in 1995.

The Bear History Project, founded by Les L. Wright in 1995, documented the emergence and early evolution of bear identity and bear community. It became the source material for much of &quot;The Bear Book&quot; (1999) and &quot;The Bear Book II&quot; (2001). Publication of &quot;The Bear Book&quot; led to the Library of Congress adding &quot;bear&quot; as a category. The Bear History Project is archived in the Human Sexuality Collection at Cornell University. It continues to be added to.

The bear community has spread all over the world, with bear clubs in many countries. Bear clubs often serve as social and sexual networks for their members, who can contribute to their local gay communities through fund-raising and other functions. Bear events have become very common, to include smaller-sized cities and many rural areas. Most gay-oriented campgrounds now include some type of bear-related event during their operating season.

The bear community constitutes a specialty niche in the commercial market. It offers T-shirts and other accessories as well as calendars and porn movies and magazines featuring bear icons, e.g., Jack Radcliffe. Catalina Video has a bear-themed line, the &quot;Furry Features Series&quot;. Other adult studios which feature bear-type men are &quot;Bear Magazine&quot;, &quot;100% BEEF Magazine&quot;, BearFilms, Bear, Butch Bear, Raging Stallion, and Titan Media. There are also social media websites and smartphone apps that market to men of the bear community.

As the bear community has matured, so has its music and literature, as well as other (non-pornographic) arts, media, and culture. Examples include Bearapalooza, a traveling bear music festival; Bear Bones Books, an imprint of LGBTQ publisher Lethe Press, which markets fiction, nonfiction, and poetry titles written by and for bears; BearRadio.net, which streams bear and LGBT music and bear-themed podcast shows. &quot;Bear Icons, the first bear-themed art exhibit (1999-2002), toured to Boston, Provincetown, New York City, and Washington, DC. The larger organized bear runs often host a &quot;bear market&quot; area where artisans, musicians, and others offer items for sale.

As more gay men have identified themselves as bears, more bars, especially leather or western bars, have become bear-friendly. Some bars cater specifically to bear patrons.

== Characteristics ==

Jack Fritscher notes that bears celebrate &quot;secondary sexual characteristics of the male: facial hair, body hair, proportional size, baldness.&quot; Since the late 2000s, cisgender women and transgender men with similar characteristics who identify as bears have been recognized in the culture.

Over the years, bear culture has been subdivided. Many claim discrimination has increased within the bear community, as some men who self-identify as &quot;bears&quot; or &quot;musclebears&quot; do not welcome higher-body fat men (see chub) at their events. A common criticism of the bear community is that some self-described bears tend to exclude men who do not fit their standards of a &quot;real bear&quot;. Fat (or lack of it) is seen by some as a political issue, some of whom see their overweight condition as a form of self-acceptance. Some also note a lack of racial diversity in the bear community, generally perceiving hirsuteness to be a standard of physical attractiveness that genetically favors white men aesthetically, socially and sexually among bears.
Example of a modern-day man, the beard is commonly thought of as a sign of masculinity.

== Bear media ==
A variety of media has been established specifically to cater to bears. The Internet comic strip &quot;Bear with Me&quot; centers around the life of the bear Andy McCubbin, a rich entrepreneur and heir to the Howell/McCubbin fortune, and his friends and family. A vast majority of the other characters are also bears. The comics are created by Tim Vanderburg under the pen name Bruin. In Tim Barela&#x27;s comic strip &quot;Leonard &amp; Larry&quot;, a majority of the male characters are bearded men, some self-identified as bears, most not. The webcomic &quot;Blur the Lines&quot; frequently features bearish men and the two main characters, Rick and Drew, associate with the bear community; the former identifies as a chub, whereas the latter identifies as a chaser/cub. (See below for term definitions.) The events and characters depicted in the strip are inspired by the life of the author and artist Bob Kusiak, who is also involved to some extent with the bear community.

Films depicting the bear community include &quot;BearCity&quot;, &quot;BearCity 2: The Proposal&quot; and &quot;Cachorro&quot;, and the comedy web series &quot;Where the Bears Are&quot;, &quot;BULK: The Series&quot;, and &quot;Skeleton Crew&quot;.

In 2012, &quot;Bear World&quot; was first published online in monthly PDF format. The magazine was the first lifestyle magazine for the bear community, offering an alternative from the beefcake and pornographic magazines in print. Over the years, &quot;Bear World&quot; has grown into the world&#x27;s leading bear lifestyle magazine, having transformed into a popular news and magazine website. 
In 2013, gay singer-songwriter Tom Goss released his song &quot;Bears&quot;, singing about the bear community&#x27;s open-mindedness and size-inclusivity.

== In popular culture ==

The International Bear Brotherhood Flag is the pride flag of the bear community. Craig Byrnes created this flag in 1995.

The December 2007 issue of &quot;Instinct&quot; featured an article by writer and director Kevin Smith on its &quot;The Last Word&quot; page. Smith wrote about his gay brother Don and about his (Kevin&#x27;s) being on the cover of &quot;A Bear&#x27;s Life&quot; magazine and the related cover story, and his feelings about being a &quot;bear icon&quot; in the gay community. Smith later made a cameo appearance in the 2012 film &quot;BearCity 2: The Proposal&quot;, playing himself in a brief conversation with a main character who works in the film industry.

The San Francisco South of Market Leather History Alley consists of four works of art along Ringold Alley honoring leather culture; it opened in 2017. One of the works of art is metal bootprints along the curb which honor 28 people (including T. Michael &quot;Lurch&quot; Sutton, biker and co-founder of the Bears of San Francisco) who were an important part of the leather communities of San Francisco.

==Criticism==
One study found bears were more likely than other gay men to engage in condomless anal sex with casual partners, which is concerning due to anal sex being the act with the highest rate of sexually transmitted infections. The study also found that bears were more likely than other gay men to have low self-esteem, which is a catalyst for their high rates of risky sexual behavior.

Some bears of color have been vocal about the greater bear community&#x27;s lack of racial diversity. Hence, bear of color subgroups were created so they feel more comfortable and seen.

== Terminology ==

Some slang terms relating to the bear community include the following:
* &quot;Big Boy&quot;An Afrocentric term for bears, particularly those of African or African American heritage. Similar to chubs, big boy culture may be considered distinct, if related to, bear culture.
* &quot;Chub&quot;A heavy-set man who might be described as overweight or obese. These men are also a distinct subculture within the gay community, and may or may not identify with the bear movement.
* &quot;Cub&quot; – a younger (or younger-looking) bear, sometimes (but not always) with a smaller frame.
* &quot;Otter&quot;Considered a sub-variant of bear by some, an otter is a hairy and slim or small-framed man.
* &quot;Panda&quot; (or &quot;Panda bear&quot;)A bear of Asian or Pacific Islander descent.
* &quot;Polar bear&quot;An older bear whose facial and body hair is predominantly or entirely white or grey.
* &quot;Trans bear&quot;A transgender person, typically a trans man or otherwise of transmasculine experience, who is hairy and heavy-set.
* &quot;Ursula&quot;A lesbian bear.
* &quot;Wolf&quot;A gay man with body and facial hair and a lean, muscular, athletic build.

<text>Richard Bancroft (1544 – 2 November 1610) was an English churchman, Archbishop of Canterbury from 1604 to 1610 and &quot;chief overseer&quot; of the King James Bible.

== Life ==
Bancroft was born in September 1544 at Farnworth, now part of Widnes, Cheshire, second son of Mary [Curwen] and John Bancroft. His mother was the daughter of James Curwen and niece to Hugh Curwen, Archbishop of Dublin from 1555 to 1567, then Bishop of Oxford until his death in November 1568.

He was initially educated at the local grammar school, founded by bishop William Smyth, also from Farnworth. He became a scholar of Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge in 1563, and graduated BA in 1567, MA in 1570 (at Jesus College, Cambridge), DD 1585.

Bancroft was older than most students at Cambridge, reportedly due to money problems, and was apparently more successful at sports (wrestling, boxing and quarterstaff) than study. During his many years there, Bancroft was one the students chosen to meet Queen Elizabeth I when she visited the University. 
In 1564, his uncle Hugh obtained a sinecure for him at St Patrick&#x27;s, Dublin. Ordained about that time, he was named chaplain to Richard Cox, then bishop of Ely, and in 1575 was presented to the rectory of Teversham in Cambridgeshire. The next year he was one of the preachers to the university.

In 1584 he was made rector of St Andrew, Holborn. In 1585 he was appointed treasurer of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, London, and in 1586 was made a member of the ecclesiastical commission. On 9 February 1589 he preached at Paul&#x27;s Cross a sermon, the substance of which was a passionate attack on the Puritans. He described their speeches and proceedings, caricatured their motives, denounced the exercise of the right of private judgment, and set forth the divine right of bishops in such strong language that Sir Francis Knollys, the Puritanically inclined Treasurer to the Household, held it to amount to a threat against the supremacy of the crown.

In the following year Bancroft was made a prebendary of St Paul&#x27;s; he had been canon of Westminster since 1587. He was chaplain successively to Lord Chancellor Hatton and Archbishop Whitgift. In June 1597, he was consecrated Bishop of London; and from this time, in consequence of the age and incapacity for business of Archbishop Whitgift, he was virtually invested with the power of primate, and had the sole management of ecclesiastical affairs. Among the more noteworthy cases which fell under his direction were the proceedings against &quot;Martin Marprelate&quot;, Thomas Cartwright and his friends, and John Penry, whose &quot;seditious writings&quot; he caused to be intercepted and given up to the Lord Keeper.

In 1600 he was sent on an embassy, with others, to Emden, for the purpose of settling certain matters in dispute between the English and the Danes. This mission, however, failed. Bancroft was present at the death of Queen Elizabeth.

Bancroft died having never married, 2 November 1610. He was interred in the parish Church at Lambeth with a simple stone slab marking the grave. A keen reader, he left behind a library of over 6,000 volumes. 

=== Archbishop of Canterbury ===
In March 1604 Bancroft, on Whitgift&#x27;s death, was appointed by royal writ president of convocation then assembled; and he there presented a book of canons collected by himself. It was adopted and received the royal approval, but was strongly opposed and set aside by Parliament two months afterwards. In the following November he was elected successor to Whitgift in the see of Canterbury. He continued to show the same zeal and severity as before, and with so much success that Lord Clarendon, writing in his praise, expressed the opinion that &quot;if Bancroft had lived, he would quickly have extinguished all that fire in England which had been kindled at Geneva.&quot;

In 1608 he was chosen chancellor of the University of Oxford. One of his last public acts was a proposal laid before Parliament for improving the revenues of the Church, and a project for a college of controversial divinity at Chelsea. In the last few months of his life he took part in the discussion about the consecration of certain Scottish bishops, and it was in pursuance of his advice that they were consecrated by several bishops of the English Church. By this act were laid the foundations of the Scottish Episcopal Church. Bancroft was &quot;the chief overseer&quot; of the authorized version of the Bible. He died at Lambeth Palace on 2 November 1610.

==Discovery of his coffin==
In 2016, during the refurbishment of the Garden Museum, which is housed at the medieval church of St Mary-at-Lambeth, 30 lead coffins were found; one with an archbishop&#x27;s red and gold mitre on top of it. On one of these coffins, a metal plate served to identify it as being that of Bancroft.

<text>Sir Squire Bancroft (14 May 1841 – 19 April 1926), born Squire White Butterfield, was an English actor-manager. He changed his name to Squire Bancroft Bancroft by deed poll just before his marriage. He and his wife Effie Bancroft are considered to have instigated a new form of drama known as &#x27;drawing-room comedy&#x27; or &#x27;cup and saucer drama&#x27;, owing to the realism of their stage sets.

==Early life and career==
Bancroft was born in Rotherhithe, London. His first appearance on the stage was in 1861 at Birmingham, and he played in the provinces with success for several years. His first London appearance was in 1865 as Jack Crawley in J. P. Wooler&#x27;s &quot;A Winning Hazard&quot; at the Prince of Wales&#x27;s Theatre off Tottenham Court Road. He was then using the stage name Sydney Bancroft; also in the cast was his future wife, Effie Wilton. This theatre was managed by Henry Byron and Wilton, whom Bancroft married in December 1867. After their marriage the Bancrofts became joint managers of the theatre.

Mr and Mrs Bancroft produced and starred in all the Thomas William Robertson comedies beginning in 1865: &quot;Society&quot; (1865), &quot;Ours&quot; (1866), &quot;Caste&quot; (1867), &quot;Play&quot; (1868), &quot;School&quot; (1869) and &quot;M.P.&quot; (1870), and, after Robertson&#x27;s death, in revivals of the old comedies, for which they surrounded themselves with an admired company. Together, Robertson and the Bancrofts are considered to have instigated a new form of drama known as &quot;drawing-room comedy&quot; or &quot;cup and saucer drama&quot;. The Bancrofts gave Robertson an unprecedented amount of directorial control over his plays, which was a key step to institutionalizing the power that directors wield in the theatre today.

The Bancroft management at the Prince of Wales&#x27;s Theatre constituted a new era in the development of the English stage and had the effect of reviving the London interest in modern drama. They were also responsible for making fashionable the &quot;box set&quot;, which Lucia Elizabeth Vestris had first used at the Olympic Theatre in the 1830s – this consisted of rooms on stage which were dressed with sofas, curtains, chairs, and carpets on the stage floor. They also provided their actors with salaries and wardrobes. Also, the Bancrofts redesigned their theatre to suit the increasingly upscale audience: &quot;The cheap benches near the stage, where the rowdiest elements of the audience used to sit were replaced by comfortable padded seats, carpets were laid in the aisles, and the pit was renamed the stalls.&quot;

Other plays they premiered or produced there were W. S. Gilbert&#x27;s &quot;Allow Me To Explain&quot; (1867) and his romantic comedy tribute to Robertson, &quot;Sweethearts&quot; (1874), as well as &quot;Tame Cats&quot; (1868), Lytton&#x27;s &quot;Money&quot; (1872), &quot;The School for Scandal&quot; (1874), Boucicault&#x27;s &quot;London Assurance&quot; (1877), and &quot;Diplomacy&quot; (1878), an adaptation of Sardou&#x27;s &quot;Dora&quot; by Clement Scott and B. C. Stephenson.
==Later life and career==
In the 1870s and 1880s, in addition to his management responsibilities, Bancroft continued to play leading roles in numerous contemporary plays, as well as in works by Shakespeare and Richard Brinsley Sheridan&#x27;s and other classic plays, often opposite his wife. In 1879, the Bancrofts moved to the Haymarket Theatre, where they produced or starred in a revival of &quot;Money&quot;, and in Sardou&#x27;s &quot;Odette&quot; (for which they engaged Madame Helena Modjeska), &quot;Fedora&quot;, and Pinero&#x27;s &quot;Lords and Commons&quot;, with revivals of previous successes.

Having made a considerable fortune, they retired from management in 1885, but Bancroft continued to act until 1918. Bancroft was knighted in 1897. Between 1917, and his death in 1926, Bancroft maintained rooms at the fashionable Albany, in Piccadilly. He and his wife are buried in Brompton Cemetery; a flat, arch-shaped memorial marks the graves, but their mausoleum was destroyed by bombing in World War II.

==Publications==
Bancroft wrote two books, and in collaboration with his wife, he wrote two volumes of reminiscences called &quot;Mr. and Mrs. Bancroft On and Off the Stage, Written by Themselves&quot; (London, 1888) and &quot;The Bancrofts: Recollections of Sixty Years&quot; (London: Dutton and Co., 1909).

<doc id="149411" wikidata="Q505619" url="?curid=149411" title="Insanity">
<text>Insanity, madness, lunacy, and craziness are behaviors caused by certain abnormal mental or behavioral patterns. Insanity can manifest as violations of societal norms, including a person or persons becoming a danger to themselves or to other people. Conceptually, mental insanity also is associated with the biological phenomenon of contagion (that mental illness is infectious) as in the case of copycat suicides. In contemporary usage, the term &quot;insanity&quot; is an informal, un-scientific term denoting &quot;mental instability&quot;; thus, the term insanity defense is the legal definition of mental instability. In medicine, the general term psychosis is used to include the presence of delusions and/or hallucinations in a patient; and psychiatric illness is &quot;psychopathology&quot;, not &quot;mental insanity&quot;.

In English, the word &quot;sane&quot; derives from the Latin adjective &quot;sanus&quot;, meaning &quot;healthy&quot;. Juvenal&#x27;s phrase &quot;mens sana in corpore sano&quot; is often translated to mean a &quot;healthy mind in a healthy body&quot;. From this perspective, insanity can be considered as poor health of the mind, not necessarily of the brain as an organ (although that can affect mental health), but rather refers to defective function of mental processes such as reasoning. Another Latin phrase related to our current concept of sanity is &quot;compos mentis&quot; (&quot;sound of mind&quot;), and a euphemistic term for insanity is &quot;non compos mentis&quot;. In law, &quot;mens rea&quot; means having had criminal intent, or a guilty mind, when the act (&quot;actus reus&quot;) was committed.

A more informal use of the term insanity is to denote something or someone considered highly unique, passionate or extreme, including in a positive sense. The term may also be used as an attempt to discredit or criticize particular ideas, beliefs, principles, desires, personal feelings, attitudes, or their proponents, such as in politics and religion.

==Historical views and treatment==
Madness, the non-legal word for insanity, has been recognized throughout history in every known society. Some traditional cultures have turned to witch doctors or shamans to apply magic, herbal mixtures, or folk medicine to rid deranged persons of evil spirits or bizarre behavior, for example. Archaeologists have unearthed skulls (at least 7000 years old) that have small, round holes bored in them using flint tools. It has been conjectured that the subjects may have been thought to have been possessed by spirits that the holes would allow to escape. More recent research on the historical practice of trepanning supports the hypothesis that this procedure was medical in nature and intended as means of treating cranial trauma.

===Ancient Greece===
The Greeks appeared to share something of the modern Western world&#x27;s secular and holistic view, believing that afflictions of the mind did not differ from diseases of the body. Moreover, they saw mental and physical illness as a result of natural causes and an imbalance in bodily humors. Hippocrates frequently wrote that an excess of black bile resulted in irrational thinking and behavior.
===Ancient Rome===
Romans made other contributions to psychiatry, in particular a precursor of some contemporary practice. They put forward the idea that strong emotions could lead to bodily ailments, the basis of today&#x27;s theory of psychosomatic illness. The Romans also supported humane treatment of the mentally ill, and in so doing, codified into law the principle of insanity as a mitigation of responsibility for criminal acts, although the criterion for insanity was sharply set as the defendant had to be found &quot;non compos mentis&quot;, a term meaning &quot;not sound of mind&quot;.

===From the Middle Ages onward===
The Middle Ages witnessed the end of the progressive ideas of the Greeks and Romans.

During the 18th century, the French and the British introduced humane treatment of the clinically insane, though the criteria for diagnosis and placement in an asylum were considerably looser than today, often including such conditions as speech disorder, speech impediments, epilepsy, and depression or being pregnant out of wedlock.

Europe&#x27;s oldest asylum was the precursor of today&#x27;s Bethlem Royal Hospital in London, known then as &quot;Bedlam&quot;, which began admitting the mentally ill in 1403 and is mentioned in Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot;. The first American asylum was built in Williamsburg, Virginia, circa 1773. Before the 19th century, these hospitals were used to isolate the mentally ill or the socially ostracized from society rather than cure them or maintain their health. Pictures from this era portrayed patients bound with rope or chains, often to beds or walls, or restrained in straitjackets.

== Medicine ==
Insanity is no longer considered a medical diagnosis but is a legal term in the United States, stemming from its original use in common law. The disorders formerly encompassed by the term covered a wide range of mental disorders now diagnosed as bipolar disorder, organic brain syndromes, schizophrenia, and other psychotic disorders.

==Law==

In United States criminal law, insanity may serve as an affirmative defense to criminal acts and thus does not need to negate an element of the prosecution&#x27;s case such as general or specific intent. Each U.S. state differs somewhat in its definition of insanity but most follow the guidelines of the Model Penal Code. All jurisdictions require a sanity evaluation to address the question first of whether or not the defendant has a mental illness.

Most courts accept a major mental illness such as psychosis but will not accept the diagnosis of a personality disorder for the purposes of an insanity defense. The second question is whether the mental illness interfered with the defendant&#x27;s ability to distinguish right from wrong. That is, did the defendant know that the alleged behavior was against the law at the time the offense was committed.

Additionally, some jurisdictions add the question of whether or not the defendant was in control of their behavior at the time of the offense. For example, if the defendant was compelled by some aspect of their mental illness to commit the illegal act, the defendant could be evaluated as not in control of their behavior at the time of the offense.

The forensic mental health specialists submit their evaluations to the court. Since the question of sanity or insanity is a legal question and not a medical one, the judge and or jury will make the final decision regarding the defendant&#x27;s status regarding an insanity defense.

In most jurisdictions within the United States, if the insanity plea is accepted, the defendant is committed to a psychiatric institution for at least 60 days for further evaluation, and then reevaluated at least yearly after that.

Insanity is generally no defense in a civil lawsuit, but an insane plaintiff can toll the statute of limitations for filing a suit until gaining sanity, or until a statute of repose has run.

==Feigning==
Feigned insanity is the simulation of mental illness in order to deceive. Amongst other purposes, insanity is feigned in order to avoid or lessen the consequences of a confrontation or conviction for an alleged crime. A number of treatises on medical jurisprudence were written during the nineteenth century, the most famous of which was Isaac Ray in 1838 (fifth edition 1871); others include Ryan (1832), Taylor (1845), Wharton and Stille (1855), Ordronaux (1869), Meymott (1882). The typical techniques as outlined in these works are the background for Dr. Neil S. Kaye&#x27;s widely recognized guidelines that indicate an attempt to feign insanity.

One famous example of someone feigning insanity is Mafia boss Vincent Gigante, who pretended for years to be suffering from dementia, and was often seen wandering aimlessly around his neighborhood in his pajamas muttering to himself. Testimony from informants and surveillance showed that Gigante was in full control of his faculties the whole time, and ruled over his Mafia family with an iron fist.

Today feigned insanity is considered malingering. In a 2005 court case, &quot;United States v. Binion&quot;, the defendant was prosecuted and convicted for obstruction of justice (adding to his original sentence) because he feigned insanity in a Competency to Stand Trial evaluation.

== Insult ==
In modern times, labeling someone as insane often carries little or no medical meaning and is rather used as an insult or as a reaction to behavior perceived to be outside the bounds of accepted norms. For instance, the definition of insanity is sometimes colloquially purported to be &quot;doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result.&quot; However, this does not match the legal definition of insanity.

<doc id="149413" wikidata="Q115793" url="?curid=149413" title="Adolph Bandelier">
<text>Adolph Francis Alphonse Bandelier (August 6, 1840March 18, 1914) was a Swiss and American archaeologist who particularly explored the indigenous cultures of the American Southwest, Mexico, and South America. He immigrated to the United States with his family as a youth and made his life there, abandoning the family business to study in the new fields of archeology and ethnology.

Bandelier National Monument in New Mexico was named for him, as his studies established the significance of this area in the Jemez Mountains for archeological and historic preservation of sites of Ancestral Puebloans dating to two eras from 1150 to 1600 CE.

==Life==

Bandelier was born in Bern, Switzerland. As a youth, he emigrated to the United States with his family, which settled in Highland, Illinois, a community established by other Swiss immigrants. He labored unhappily in the family business as a young man. He became acquainted with the pioneering anthropologist Lewis Henry Morgan of New York, who served as a mentor as Bandelier turned to scholarship. In particular, he undertook archaeological and ethnological work among the Native Americans of the southwestern United States, Mexico, and South America.

Beginning his studies in Sonora (Mexico), Arizona, and New Mexico, Bandelier developed as the leading authority on the history of this region. With F. H. Cushing and his successors, he became one of the leading authorities on its prehistoric civilization, at a time when archeology and ethnology were new fields of study.

In 1892, Bandelier left the Southwest to travel and conduct research in Ecuador, Bolivia, and Peru, where he continued ethnological, archaeological, and historical investigations. In the first field he was in a part of his work connected with the Hemenway Archaeological Expedition. In the second, he worked in NYC for Henry Villard and for the American Museum of Natural History. Bandelier had shown the falsity of various historical myths, notably in his conclusions respecting the Inca civilization of Peru.

While working at the Pueblo of Isleta (in New Mexico), Bandelier made some long-term friends. They included French-born missionary Father Anton Docher, who had served the Tiwa people since 1891 and was known as the Padre of Isleta. Another was American journalist and writer Charles Fletcher Lummis, who also wrote on ethnology. Lummis traveled with Bandelier for a time in South America, before returning to his base in Los Angeles.

==Legacy and honors==
* Bandelier National Monument in New Mexico was named for him, as his studies established the significance of this area for understanding ancient indigenous cultures of the Tuyongi canyon.
* Bandelier Elementary School in Albuquerque, New Mexico was named after him.
* Bandelier was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1881.

<doc id="149415" wikidata="Q1136420" url="?curid=149415" title="Neptunism">
<text>Neptunism is a superseded scientific theory of geology proposed by Abraham Gottlob Werner (1749–1817) in the late 18th century, who proposed that rocks formed from the crystallisation of minerals in the early Earth&#x27;s oceans.

The theory took its name from Neptune, the ancient Roman god of the sea. There was considerable debate between its proponents (neptunists) and those favouring a rival theory known as plutonism which gave a significant role to volcanic origins, and which in modified form replaced neptunism in the early 19th century as the principle of uniformitarianism was shown to fit better with the geological facts as they became better known.

Modern geology acknowledges many different forms of rock formation, and explains the formation of sedimentary rock through processes very similar to those described by neptunism.

==Historical development==
In the mid-eighteenth century as the investigation of geology found evidence such as fossils, naturalists developed new ideas which diverged from the Genesis creation narrative. Georges de Buffon proposed that the Earth was over 75,000 years old, possibly much older, and showed signs of historical development in a series of distinct epochs.

Abraham Gottlob Werner was the inspector of mines and professor of mining and mineralogy at the Mining Academy in Freiberg (Saxony) which became dominant in late eighteenth-century geology. His &quot;Short Classification and Description of Rocks&quot; of 1787 and his lectures set out a classification of rocks on the basis of their age based on the sequence of layers of differing material, rather than by the types of minerals as had been previous practice.

He based his historical sequence of rock formation on the theory that the Earth had originally consisted of water. According to this account, the water contained material which settled out of suspension in a process of sedimentation to form the core of the planet and the continents as a series of layers, the oldest and hardest being granite while newer layers showed an increasing number of fossils. Volcanoes had a minor effect, modifying the continents and adding more sediment as well as some volcanic rocks, and successive lesser floods added more layers, so that most rocks resulted from precipitates settling out of water. There is no indication that any of the floods in Werner&#x27;s cosmogony were Noah&#x27;s flood.

== The neptunist–plutonist controversy ==
A rival theory known as plutonism (or vulcanism) held that rocks were formed in fire. This was originally proposed by Abbé Anton Moro (1687–1750) with reference to his studies of volcanic islands, and was taken up by James Hutton who put forward a uniformitarian theory of a rock cycle extending over infinite time in which rocks were worn away by weathering and erosion, then were re-formed and uplifted by heat and pressure.

Neptunists differed from the plutonists in holding that basalt was a sedimentary deposit which included fossils and so could not be of volcanic origin. Hutton correctly asserted that basalt never contained fossils and was always insoluble, hard, and crystalline. He found geological formations in which basalt cut through layers of other rocks, supporting his theory that it originated from molten rock under the Earth&#x27;s crust.

The debate was not just between scientists. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, one of the most respected authors of the day, took sides with the neptunists. The fourth act of his famous work &quot;Faust&quot; contains a dialogue between a neptunist and a plutonist, the latter being Mephistopheles, the antagonist of the play who is a devil. Doing so he implicitly expressed his favour for the neptunist theory, though he also did so explicitly and sometimes even harshly elsewhere.

The controversy lasted into the early years of the 19th century, but the works of Charles Lyell in the 1830s gradually won over support for the uniformitarian ideas of Hutton and the plutonists. However, sedimentary rocks such as limestone are considered to have resulted from processes like those described by the neptunists, and so modern theory can be seen as a synthesis of the two approaches.

==Notable neptunists==
* Abraham Gottlob Werner (1749–1817)
* Juan Ignacio Molina (1740–1829): considered basalt a compacted slate
* Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749–1832)
* Robert Jameson (1774–1854): studied with Werner and supported neptunism
* Gustav Bischof, (1792–1870), founder of geochemistry

==Fictional account==
The theory, and its intellectual context, are treated in Daniel Kehlmann&#x27;s fictionalised account of the travels of Alexander von Humboldt, &quot;Die Vermessung der Welt&quot; (&quot;Measuring the World&quot;) of 2006.

<text>Joseph Jefferson Jackson (July 16, 1887 – December 5, 1951), nicknamed &quot;Shoeless Joe&quot;, was an American outfielder who played Major League Baseball (MLB) in the early 20th century. Although his .356 career batting average is the fourth highest in the history of Major League Baseball (MLB), he is often remembered for his association with the Black Sox Scandal, in which members of the 1919 Chicago White Sox participated in a conspiracy to fix the World Series. As a result, Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis banned Jackson from baseball after the 1920 season. During the World Series in question, Jackson had led both teams in several statistical categories and set a World Series record with 12 base hits. Jackson&#x27;s role in the scandal, banishment from the game, and exclusion from the Baseball Hall of Fame have been fiercely debated.

Jackson played for three MLB teams during his 12-year career, primarily in left field. He spent 1908–1909 as a member of the Philadelphia Athletics and 1910 with the minor league New Orleans Pelicans before joining the Cleveland Naps at the end of the 1910 season. He was still considered a rookie in 1911, when he hit for a .408 average, a single-season record for a rookie that still stands. He remained in Cleveland until early in the 1915 season; he then played for the White Sox through 1920. Later, Jackson played baseball under assumed names throughout the South.

Jackson holds the Cleveland Guardians and Chicago White Sox franchise records for triples in a season and career batting average. In 1999, he ranked number 35 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot;″ list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players and was a finalist for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. The fans voted him as the 12th-best outfielder of all time. He also ranks 33rd on the all-time list for non-pitchers according to the win shares formula developed by sabermetrician Bill James. Baseball legend Babe Ruth said that he modeled his hitting method after Jackson&#x27;s.

==Early life==
Jackson was born in Pickens County, South Carolina, the oldest son of George Jackson, a sharecropper. While Jackson was still a baby, his father moved the family to Pelzer, South Carolina. A few years later, the family moved to a company town called Brandon Mill on the outskirts of Greenville, South Carolina. An attack of measles almost killed him when he was 10. He was bedridden for two months, paralyzed, while he was nursed back to health by his mother.

Starting at the age of 6 or 7, Jackson worked in one of the town&#x27;s textile mills as a &quot;linthead&quot;, a derogatory name for a mill hand. Family finances required Joe to take 12-hour shifts in the mill, and since education at the time was a luxury the Jackson family couldn&#x27;t afford, Jackson was uneducated. His lack of education ultimately became an issue throughout Jackson&#x27;s life. It even affected the value of his memorabilia in the collectibles market; because Jackson was illiterate, he often had his wife sign his signature. Consequently, anything autographed by Jackson himself brings a premium when sold, including one autograph which was sold for $23,500 in 1990 (). In restaurants, rather than ask someone to read the menu to him, he would wait until his teammates ordered and then order one of the items that he heard.

In 1900, when he was 13 years old, his mother was approached by one of the owners of the Brandon Mill, and he started to play for the mill&#x27;s baseball team. He was the youngest player on the team. He was paid $2.50 to play on Saturdays (). He was initially a pitcher, but one day he accidentally broke another player&#x27;s arm with a fastball. No one wanted to bat against him, so the team manager placed him in the outfield. His hitting ability made him a celebrity around town. Around that time, he was given a baseball bat that he named Black Betsy. He was compared to Champ Osteen, another player from the mills who made it to the majors. He moved from mill team to mill team in search of better pay, playing semi-professional baseball by 1905.

===Nickname===
In an interview published in the October 1949 edition of &quot;Sport&quot; magazine, Jackson recalled he got his nickname during a mill game played in Greenville, South Carolina. Jackson had blisters on his foot from a new pair of cleats, which hurt so much that he took his shoes off before he was at bat. As play continued, a heckling fan noticed Jackson running to third base in his socks and shouted, &quot;You shoeless son of a gun, you!&quot; and the resulting nickname &quot;Shoeless Joe&quot; stuck with him throughout the remainder of his life.

==Professional career==

===Early professional career===
In 1908, Jackson began his professional baseball career with his hometown minor league team, the Greenville Spinners of the Carolina Association, married 15-year-old Katie Wynn, and eventually signed with Connie Mack to play for the Philadelphia Athletics.
Jackson started the season with the Spinners for $75 a month, and hit .346 to lead the Carolina Association in batting average, hits, and RBI for 1908. In August 1908, his contract was purchased by Connie Mack of the Philadelphia Athletics for $900. Jackson immediately reported to the Athletics and made his major league debut.

For the first two years of his career, Jackson had some trouble adjusting to life with the Athletics; reports conflict as to whether he did not like the big city or was bothered by hazing from teammates. Consequently, he spent much of that time in the minor leagues. Between 1908 and 1909, Jackson appeared in just 10 MLB games. During the 1909 season, Jackson played 118 games for the South Atlantic League&#x27;s Savannah Indians. He batted .358 for the year.

The Athletics gave up on Jackson in 1910 and traded him to the Cleveland Naps. He spent most of 1910 with the New Orleans Pelicans of the Southern Association, where he won the batting title and led the team to the pennant. Late in the season, he was called up to play on the big league team. He appeared in 20 games for the Naps, and managed a batting average of .387.

===Major League career===
In 1911, Jackson&#x27;s first full MLB season, he set several rookie records. His .408 batting average that season is a record that still stands and was good for second overall in the league behind Ty Cobb&#x27;s .419 - one of the few times in baseball history that a batting average above .400 did not win a batting title. His .468 on-base percentage led the league. The following season, Jackson batted .395 and led the American League in hits, triples, and total bases. On April 20, 1912, Jackson scored the first run in Tiger Stadium. The next year, he led the league with 197 hits and a .551 slugging percentage.

In August 1915, Jackson was traded to the Chicago White Sox. Two years later, Jackson and the White Sox won the American League pennant and also the World Series. During the series, Jackson hit .307 as the White Sox defeated the New York Giants.

Jackson missed most of the 1918 season while working in a shipyard because of World War I. In 1919, he returned strongly to post a .351 average during the regular season and .375 with perfect fielding in the World Series. However, the heavily favored White Sox lost the series to the Cincinnati Reds. The following season, the 32-year-old Jackson batted .382. He was having one of his best overall seasons, leading the American League in triples and setting by large margins career marks for home runs, RBIs, and fewest strikeouts per plate appearance when he was suspended, along with seven other members of the White Sox, after allegations surfaced that the team had thrown the previous World Series.

== Black Sox Scandal ==

After the White Sox lost the 1919 World Series to the Cincinnati Reds, Jackson and seven other White Sox players were accused of accepting $5,000 each () to throw the Series. In September 1920, a grand jury was convened to investigate the allegations.

Jackson&#x27;s 12 base hits set a Series record that was not broken until 1964, and he led both teams with a .375 batting average (.286 in the games the White Sox lost and .545 in the games they won). He committed no charged errors and threw out a runner at the plate. However, the Reds hit an unusually high number of triples, 3 out of 9 total, to Jackson&#x27;s position in left field. The Sox pitchers said the team&#x27;s outfielders were playing out of position and slowly fielding balls. 

It was alleged that Jackson admitted to participating in the fix during grand jury testimony on September 28, 1920.

In 1921, a Chicago jury acquitted Jackson and his seven teammates of wrongdoing. Nevertheless, Kenesaw Mountain Landis, the newly appointed Commissioner of Baseball, imposed a lifetime ban on all eight players. &quot;Regardless of the verdict of juries,&quot; Landis declared, &quot;no player that throws a ballgame; no player that undertakes or promises to throw a ballgame; no player that sits in a conference with a bunch of crooked players and gamblers where the ways and means of throwing games are planned and discussed and does not promptly tell his club about it, will ever play professional baseball.&quot;

After the grand jury returned its indictments, Charley Owens of the &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot; wrote a regretful tribute headlined, &quot;Say it ain&#x27;t so, Joe.&quot; The phrase became legendary when another reporter later erroneously attributed it to a child outside the courthouse: 

When Jackson left the criminal court building in the custody of a sheriff after telling his story to the grand jury, he found several hundred youngsters, aged from 6 to 16, waiting for a glimpse of their idol. One child stepped up to the outfielder, and, grabbing his coat sleeve, said:
&quot;It ain&#x27;t true, is it, Joe?&quot;
&quot;Yes, kid, I&#x27;m afraid it is,&quot; Jackson replied. The boys opened a path for the ball player and stood in silence until he passed out of sight.
&quot;Well, I&#x27;d never have thought it,&quot; sighed the lad.
In an interview in &quot;Sport&quot; nearly three decades later, Jackson confirmed that the legendary exchange never occurred.

===Dispute over Jackson&#x27;s guilt===

Jackson&#x27;s involvement in the scandal remains controversial to this day. He reportedly refused the $5,000 bribe twice—even though it would effectively double his salary—only to have teammate Lefty Williams toss the cash on the floor of his hotel room. Jackson then tried to tell White Sox owner Charles Comiskey about the fix. Still, Comiskey refused to meet with him. Unable to afford legal counsel, Jackson was represented by team attorney Alfred Austrian—a clear conflict of interest. Before Jackson&#x27;s grand jury testimony, Austrian allegedly elicited Jackson&#x27;s admission of his supposed role in the fix by plying him with whiskey. Austrian also persuaded the nearly illiterate Jackson to sign a waiver of immunity from prosecution.

Years later, the other seven players implicated in the scandal confirmed that Jackson was never at any meetings. Williams said they only mentioned Jackson&#x27;s name to give their plot more credibility, although he did not say why Jackson would have been paid $5,000 had that been the case. Jackson&#x27;s performance during the series itself lends further credence to his assertions, although the game records show that he hit far better during the &quot;clean&quot; games than those thrown. A 1993 article in &quot;The American Statistician&quot; reported the results of a statistical analysis of Jackson&#x27;s contribution during the 1919 World Series and concluded that there was &quot;substantial support to Jackson&#x27;s subsequent claims of innocence&quot;.

An article in the September 2009 issue of &quot;Chicago Lawyer&quot; magazine argued that Eliot Asinof&#x27;s 1963 book &quot;Eight Men Out&quot;, purporting to confirm Jackson&#x27;s guilt, was based on inaccurate information. For example, Jackson never confessed to throwing the series as Asinof claimed. Further, Asinof omitted key facts from publicly available documents, such as the 1920 grand jury records and proceedings of Jackson&#x27;s successful 1924 lawsuit against Comiskey to recover back pay for the 1920 and 1921 seasons. Asinof&#x27;s use of fictional characters within a supposedly non-fiction account also damaged the book&#x27;s historical accuracy.

In 1989, MLB Commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti declined to reinstate Jackson because the case was &quot;now best given to historical analysis and debate as opposed to a present-day review with an eye to reinstatement.&quot; In November 1999, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a resolution lauding Jackson&#x27;s sporting achievements and encouraging MLB to rescind his ineligibility. The resolution was symbolic since the U.S. government had no jurisdiction in the matter, and Jackson died in 1951, some 48 years earlier. Commissioner Bud Selig stated that Jackson&#x27;s case was under review, but no decision was issued during Selig&#x27;s tenure. In 2015, the Shoeless Joe Jackson Museum formally petitioned Commissioner Rob Manfred for reinstatement, on grounds that Jackson had &quot;more than served his sentence&quot; in the 95 years since his banishment by Landis. Manfred denied the request after an official review, writing: &quot;The results of this work demonstrate to me that it is not possible now, over 95 years since those events took place and were considered by Commissioner Landis, to be certain enough of the truth to overrule Commissioner Landis&#x27; determinations&quot;.

In 2020, ESPN reported that MLB had shifted its policy and that the league &quot;has no hold on banned players after they die because the ineligible list bars players from privileges that include a job with a major league club.&quot; It is unclear how that might affect Jackson&#x27;s Hall of Fame prospects.

==Career statistics==
See &quot;baseball statistics&quot; for an explanation of these statistics.
==Later life==

During the remaining 20 years of his baseball career, Jackson played with and managed several semi-professional teams, most located in Georgia and South Carolina, under assumed names. In 1922, Jackson moved to Savannah, Georgia, and opened a dry cleaning business with his wife.

In 1933, the Jacksons moved back to Greenville, South Carolina. After opening a barbecue restaurant, Jackson and his wife opened &quot;Joe Jackson&#x27;s Liquor Store&quot;, which they operated until his death. One of the better-known stories of Jackson&#x27;s post-major league life occurred at the store. Ty Cobb and sportswriter Grantland Rice entered the store, with Jackson showing no sign of recognition of Cobb. After making his purchase, Cobb finally asked Jackson, &quot;Don&#x27;t you know me, Joe?&quot; Jackson replied, &quot;Sure, I know you, Ty, but I wasn&#x27;t sure you wanted to know me. A lot of them don&#x27;t.&quot;

As he aged, Jackson began to suffer from heart trouble. In 1951, at the age of 64, he died of a heart attack. Jackson was the first of the eight banned players to die and is buried at Woodlawn Memorial Park in Greenville. He had no children, but he and his wife raised two of his nephews.

==Legacy==
Though Jackson was banned from Major League Baseball, statues and parks have been constructed in his honor. One of the landmarks built for him was a memorial park in Greenville, Shoeless Joe Jackson Memorial Park. A life-size statue of Jackson, created by South Carolina sculptor Doug Young, also stands in Greenville&#x27;s West End.

In 2006, Jackson&#x27;s original home was moved to a location adjacent to Fluor Field in downtown Greenville. The home was restored and opened in 2008 as the Shoeless Joe Jackson Museum. The address is 356 Field Street, in honor of his lifetime .356 batting average. The restoration and move were chronicled on TLC&#x27;s reality show &quot;The Real Deal&quot; episode &quot;A Home Run for Trademark&quot;, which aired March 31, 2007. Richard C. Davis, the owner of Trademark Properties, hired Josh Hamilton as the construction foreman.

In 1951, Jackson was inducted into the Cleveland Indians Hall of Fame as part of the inaugural class. The selection was controversial at the time because although he had not yet been barred from consideration for the National Baseball Hall of Fame, he had also not been enshrined therein. Additionally, his tenure with the Naps/Indians was relatively short. However, an outpouring of support from Indians fans convinced the sports editors voting on the selections to elect him unanimously.

Jackson was inducted into the Baseball Reliquary&#x27;s Shrine of the Eternals in 2002.

Jackson&#x27;s first relative to play professional baseball since his banishment was catcher Joseph Ray Jackson. The great-great-grandnephew of Shoeless Joe batted .386 for The Citadel in 2013 and was then drafted by the Texas Rangers. Later that year, he made his professional debut with the Northwest League&#x27;s Spokane Indians.

In October 2021, a signed photograph of Jackson sold for $1.47 million, making it the most expensive sports photograph.

===Films===
Shoeless Joe was depicted in several films in the late 20th century. &quot;Eight Men Out&quot;, a film directed by John Sayles, based on the Eliot Asinof book of the same name, details the Black Sox Scandal in general and has D. B. Sweeney portraying Jackson.

The Phil Alden Robinson film &quot;Field of Dreams&quot;, based on &quot;Shoeless Joe&quot; by W. P. Kinsella, stars Ray Liotta as Jackson. Kevin Costner plays an Iowa farmer who hears a mysterious voice instructing him to build a baseball field on his farm so Shoeless Joe—among others—can play baseball again.

<text>David Ian &quot;Joe&quot; Jackson (born 11 August 1954) is an English musician, singer and songwriter. Having spent years studying music and playing clubs, he scored a hit with his first release, &quot;Is She Really Going Out with Him?&quot;, in 1979. It was followed by a number of new wave singles, before he moved to more jazz-inflected pop music and had a Top-10 hit in 1982 with &quot;Steppin&#x27; Out&quot;. Jackson is associated with the 1980s Second British Invasion of the US. He has also composed classical music. He has recorded 21 studio albums and has received five Grammy Award nominations.

==Early years==
Born in Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire, England, David Jackson spent his first year in nearby Swadlincote, Derbyshire. He grew up in the Paulsgrove area of Portsmouth, where he attended Portsmouth Technical High School. Jackson&#x27;s parents moved to nearby Gosport when he was a teenager. He learned to play the violin but soon switched to the piano, and prevailed on his father to install one in the hall of their Paulsgrove council house. Jackson began playing piano in bars when he was 16, and won a scholarship to study musical composition at London&#x27;s Royal Academy of Music.

==Career==
Jackson&#x27;s first band, formed in Gosport, was called Edward Bear, later renamed Arms and Legs. The band broke up in 1976 after two unsuccessful singles. He was still known as David Jackson when he joined Arms and Legs, but picked up the nickname &quot;Joe&quot; based on his perceived resemblance to the British television puppet character Joe 90, a genius child spy. Jackson legally changed his name to Joe at age 20. Jackson then spent some time performing on the cabaret circuit to make money to record a demo.

===Joe Jackson Band===
In 1978, a record producer heard Jackson&#x27;s demo tape and signed him to A&amp;M Records. The next year, the newly formed Joe Jackson Band released their debut album, &quot;Look Sharp!&quot; The band consisted of Jackson, Gary Sanford on guitar, Graham Maby on bass, and David Houghton on drums. A mix of rock, melodic jazz, and new wave, it mined a vein similar to contemporaries Elvis Costello and Graham Parker. The album enjoyed wide critical success: in 2013, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine named &quot;Look Sharp!&quot; number 98 in a list of the 100 best debut albums of all time. Some commercial success also followed, as the debut single &quot;Is She Really Going Out with Him?&quot; reached the top 40 in five countries, and  9 in Canada.

The Joe Jackson Band released &quot;I&#x27;m the Man&quot; in 1979. The album followed a similar musical pattern, and received good, though not as strong, reviews. It did produce the single &quot;It&#x27;s Different for Girls&quot;, which became Jackson&#x27;s highest charting UK single, peaking at No. 5. &quot;Beat Crazy&quot; followed in 1980. Jackson also collaborated with Lincoln Thompson in reggae crossover.

The Joe Jackson Band toured extensively until it broke up at the end of 1980, when Houghton, weary of touring and fame, left the band. Though Maby would continue to work with Jackson in the following decades, the full band would not reunite until 2004&#x27;s &quot;Volume 4.&quot;

===Change in style===
In 1981, Jackson produced an album for the British power pop group the Keys. &quot;The Keys Album&quot; was the group&#x27;s only LP.

After the Joe Jackson Band disbanded, Jackson recorded &quot;Jumpin&#x27; Jive&quot;, an album of old-style swing and blues tunes. It included songs by Cab Calloway, Lester Young, Glenn Miller, and Louis Jordan. The album and associated single release were credited to &quot;Joe Jackson&#x27;s Jumpin&#x27; Jive&quot;.

Jackson&#x27;s 1982 album, &quot;Night and Day&quot;, was his only studio album to chart in the UK and US Top 10, peaking at No. 3 (UK) and at No. 4 (US). Two singles released from the album, &quot;Steppin&#x27; Out&quot; and &quot;Breaking Us in Two&quot;, were US top 20 hits. The tracks &quot;Real Men&quot; and &quot;A Slow Song&quot; referred obliquely to New York City&#x27;s early 1980s gay culture, critiquing its exclusiveness and asking for a slow song in the disco respectively. &quot;Real Men&quot; also became a top 10 hit in Australia.

By 1984, New York had become Jackson&#x27;s home base. He recorded &quot;Body and Soul&quot; there, an album he later said was &quot;from the point of view of a relative newcomer&quot;. Heavily influenced by pop, jazz standards and salsa, it had the US No. 15 hit single &quot;You Can&#x27;t Get What You Want (Till You Know What You Want)&quot;.

In 1985, Jackson played piano on Joan Armatrading&#x27;s album &quot;Secret Secrets&quot;, and in 1986 he collaborated with Suzanne Vega on the single &quot;Left of Center&quot; from &quot;Pretty in Pink&quot;″s soundtrack. Jackson&#x27;s next album was &quot;Big World&quot;, with all-new songs recorded live in front of an audience instructed to remain silent while music was playing. Released in 1986, it was a three-sided double record; the fourth side consisted of a single centering groove and a label stating &quot;there is no music on this side&quot;.

The instrumental album &quot;Will Power&quot; (1987), with heavy classical and jazz influences, set the stage for things to come later, but before Jackson left pop behind, he released two more albums, &quot;Blaze of Glory&quot; (which he performed in its entirety during the subsequent tour) and &quot;Laughter &amp; Lust&quot;. In 1995, Jackson contributed his version of &quot;Statue of Liberty&quot; on a tribute album for the English band XTC called &quot;A Testimonial Dinner: The Songs of XTC&quot;.

===Post-pop===
In the late 1990s, Jackson expanded into classical music; he signed with Sony Classical in 1997 and released &quot;Symphony No. 1&quot; in 1999, for which he received a Grammy for Best Pop Instrumental Album in 2001. In 2000, he released a follow-up album, &quot;Night and Day II&quot;.

In 2003, he reunited his original quartet for the album &quot;Volume 4&quot;, and a lengthy tour. In 2004, he contributed vocals to a cover of Pulp&#x27;s &quot;Common People&quot; with William Shatner for Shatner&#x27;s album &quot;Has Been&quot; (produced by Ben Folds). In 2005, he teamed up with Todd Rundgren and the string quartet ETHEL for a tour of the US and Europe. A dedicated smoker, he gave up his New York apartment in 2006 partly in protest over the ascendancy of smoking bans, and made the Berlin neighbourhood Kreuzberg his new home. It was there that he recorded, with longtime collaborators Graham Maby and Dave Houghton, his eighteenth studio album, &quot;Rain&quot; (Rykodisc, January 2008); the album was followed by a five-month tour.

In 2015, Jackson announced the completion of his follow-up to 2012&#x27;s &quot;The Duke&quot; via his official website. The album&#x27;s title, &quot;Fast Forward&quot;, and track list were confirmed in addition to North American tour dates. The titular first single was released for streaming via his official SoundCloud page. The entire record was briefly posted before being taken down a day later.

On 18 January 2019, Jackson released the album &quot;Fool&quot;. Jackson said about the album on his website: &quot;One of my inspirations for this album was the band I&#x27;ve been touring with on and off for the last 3 years. I&#x27;ve had many different line-ups but this one is special.&quot; Jackson and the band performed &quot;Fabulously Absolute&quot; on Jimmy Fallon&#x27;s &quot;Tonight Show&quot; on 21 January 2019. &quot;Fool&quot; debuted in the top 20 album charts in Holland, Belgium, Germany and Switzerland. In the US, it debuted at No. 25 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Top Album Sales Chart. In the UK, it entered the Indie Albums Chart at No. 13.

&quot; What a Racket!&quot;, also known as &quot;Mr. Joe Jackson Presents Max Champion in &#x27;What a Racket!&#x27; &quot;, his 21st studio album, was released by earMUSIC on 24 November 2023. 

==Personal life==
Jackson spent a number of years living in New York City, which served as an inspiration for his 1982 song &quot;Steppin&#x27; Out&quot;. In a 2018 interview, Jackson said &quot;I don&#x27;t like New York much these days. It&#x27;s as if the city and I had a hot love affair and now we&#x27;re just friends, but we still have to see each other to remain friends. Today I live in Berlin. The New York I knew in late &#x27;81 and &#x27;82 is gone.&quot; Jackson currently resides in Berlin; he also owns homes in New York and Portsmouth.

Jackson was married to his wife Ruth for two years, but the marriage ended in divorce and was later called a &quot;disaster&quot; by Jackson. In a 2001 interview with the &quot;Irish Independent&quot;, Jackson said he was in a relationship with a male partner. Jackson had previously discussed his bisexuality in his autobiography &quot;A Cure for Gravity&quot;. His questioning of potential homosexuality and same-sex attraction is explored in the 1982 single &quot;Real Men&quot;.

==Other activities==
Jackson has actively campaigned against smoking bans in both the United States and the United Kingdom, publishing a 2005 pamphlet (&quot;The Smoking Issue&quot;) and a 2007 essay (&quot;Smoke, Lies and the Nanny State&quot;), and recording a satirical song (&quot;In 20-0-3&quot;) on the subject.

Jackson&#x27;s 1999 autobiography, &quot;A Cure for Gravity&quot;, was described by him as a &quot;book about music, thinly disguised as a memoir&quot;. It traces his working-class upbringing in Portsmouth and charts his musical life from childhood until his 24th birthday. According to Jackson, life as a pop star was hardly worth writing about.

<doc id="149422" wikidata="Q165947" url="?curid=149422" title="Hunger">
<text>In politics, humanitarian aid, and the social sciences, hunger is defined as a condition in which a person does not have the physical or financial capability to eat sufficient food to meet basic nutritional needs for a sustained period. In the field of hunger relief, the term hunger is used in a sense that goes beyond the common desire for food that all humans experience, also known as an appetite. The most extreme form of hunger, when malnutrition is widespread, and when people have started dying of starvation through lack of access to sufficient, nutritious food, leads to a declaration of famine.

Throughout history, portions of the world&#x27;s population have often suffered sustained periods of hunger. In many cases, hunger resulted from food supply disruptions caused by war, plagues, or adverse weather. In the decades following World War II, technological progress and enhanced political cooperation suggested it might be possible to substantially reduce the number of people suffering from hunger. While progress was uneven, by 2015, the threat of extreme hunger had receded for a large portion of the world&#x27;s population. According to the FAO&#x27;s 2023 The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World report, this positive trend had reversed from about 2017, when a gradual rise in number of people suffering from chronic hunger became discernible. In 2020 and 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there was an increase in the number of people suffering from undernourishment. A recovery occurred in 2022 along with the economic rebound, though the impact on global food markets caused by the invasion of Ukraine meant the reduction in world hunger was limited.

While most of the world&#x27;s people continue to live in Asia, much of the increase in hunger since 2017 occurred in Africa and South America. The FAO&#x27;s 2017 report discussed three principal reasons for the recent increase in hunger: climate, conflict, and economic slowdowns. The 2018 edition focused on extreme weather as a primary driver of the increase in hunger, finding rising rates to be especially severe in countries where agricultural systems were most sensitive to extreme weather variations. The 2019 SOFI report found a strong correlation between increases in hunger and countries that had suffered an economic slowdown. The 2020 edition instead looked at the prospects of achieving the hunger related Sustainable Development Goal (SDG). It warned that if nothing was done to counter the adverse trends of the past six years, the number of people suffering from chronic hunger could rise by over 150 million by 2030. The 2023 report reported a sharp jump in hunger caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which leveled off in 2022.

Many thousands of organizations are engaged in the field of hunger relief, operating at local, national, regional, or international levels. Some of these organizations are dedicated to hunger relief, while others may work in several different fields. The organizations range from multilateral institutions to national governments, to small local initiatives such as independent soup kitchens. Many participate in umbrella networks that connect thousands of different hunger relief organizations. At the global level, much of the world&#x27;s hunger relief efforts are coordinated by the UN and geared towards achieving SDG 2 of &quot;Zero Hunger&quot; by 2030.

==Definition and related terms==
There is one globally recognized approach for defining and measuring hunger generally used by those studying or working to relieve hunger as a social problem. This is the United Nation&#x27;s FAO measurement, which is typically referred to as &quot;chronic undernourishment&quot; (or in older publications, as &#x27;food deprivation,&#x27; &#x27;chronic hunger,&#x27; or just plain &#x27;hunger.&#x27;) For the FAO:
* &quot;Hunger&quot; or &quot;chronic undernourishment&quot; exists when &quot;caloric intake is below the minimum dietary energy requirement (MDER). The MDER is the amount of energy needed to perform light activity and to maintain a minimum acceptable weight for attained height.&quot; The FAO use different MDER thresholds for different countries, due to variations in climate and cultural factors. Typically a yearly &quot;balance sheet&quot; approach is used, with the minimum dietary energy requirement tallied against the estimated total calories consumed over the year. The FAO definitions differentiate hunger from malnutrition and food insecurity:
* Malnutrition results from &quot;deficiencies, excesses or imbalances in the consumption of macro- and/or micro-nutrients.&quot; In the FAO definition, all hungry people suffer from malnutrition, but people who are malnourished may not be hungry. They may get sufficient raw calories to avoid hunger but lack essential micronutrients, or they may even consume an excess of raw calories and hence suffer from obesity.
* Food insecurity occurs when people are at risk, or worried about, not being able to meet their preferences for food, including in terms of raw calories and nutritional value. In the FAO definition, all hungry people are food insecure, but not all food-insecure people are hungry (though there is a very strong overlap between hunger and &quot;severe food insecurity&quot;.). The FAO have reported that food insecurity quite often results in simultaneous stunted growth for children, and obesity for adults. For hunger relief actors operating at the global or regional level, an increasingly commonly used metric for food insecurity is the IPC scale.
* &quot;Acute hunger&quot; is typically used to denote famine like hunger, though the phrase lacks a widely accepted formal definition. In the context of hunger relief, people experiencing &#x27;acute hunger&#x27; may also suffer from &#x27;chronic hunger&#x27;. The word is used mainly to denote severity, not long-term duration.
Not all of the organizations in the hunger relief field use the FAO definition of hunger. Some use a broader definition that overlaps more fully with malnutrition. The alternative definitions do however tend to go beyond the commonly understood meaning of hunger as a painful or uncomfortable motivational condition; the desire for food is something that all humans frequently experience, even the most affluent, and is not in itself a social problem.

Very low food supply can be described as &quot;food insecure with hunger.&quot; A change in description was made in 2006 at the recommendation of the Committee on National Statistics (National Research Council, 2006) in order to distinguish the physiological state of hunger from indicators of food availability. Food insecure is when food intake of one or more household members was reduced and their eating patterns were disrupted at times during the year because the household lacked money and other resources for food. Food security statistics is measured by using survey data, based on household responses to items about whether the household was able to obtain enough food to meet their needs.

==World statistics==

The United Nations publishes an annual report on the state of food security and nutrition across the world. Led by the FAO, the report was joint authored by four other UN agencies: the WFP, IFAD, WHO and UNICEF. The theme of the 2024 report is on how efforts to meet SDG 2.1 &amp; 2.2 can be financed. The FAO&#x27;s yearly report provides a statistical overview on the prevalence of hunger around the world, and is widely considered the main global reference for tracking hunger. No simple set of statistics can ever fully capture the multi dimensional nature of hunger however. Reasons include that the FAO&#x27;s key metric for hunger, &quot;undernourishment&quot;, is defined solely in terms of dietary energy availability – disregarding micro-nutrients such as vitamins or minerals. Second, the FAO uses the energy requirements for minimum activity levels as a benchmark; many people would not count as hungry by the FAO&#x27;s measure yet still be eating too little to undertake hard manual labour, which might be the only sort of work available to them. Thirdly, the FAO statistics do not always reflect short-term undernourishment.
An alternative measure of hunger across the world is the Global Hunger Index (GHI). Unlike the FAO&#x27;s measure, the GHI defines hunger in a way that goes beyond raw calorie intake, to include for example ingestion of micronutrients. GDI is a multidimensional statistical tool used to describe the state of countries&#x27; hunger situation. The GHI measures progress and failures in the global fight against hunger. The GHI is updated once a year. The data from the 2015 report showed that Hunger levels have dropped 27% since 2000. Fifty two countries remained at serious or alarming levels. The 2019 GHI report expresses concern about the increase in hunger since 2015. In addition to the latest statistics on Hunger and Food Security, the GHI also features different special topics each year. The 2019 report includes an essay on hunger and climate change, with evidence suggesting that areas most vulnerable to climate change have suffered much of the recent increases in hunger.

== The fight against hunger ==

===Pre World War II===

Throughout history, the need to aid those suffering from hunger has been commonly, though not universally, recognized. The philosopher Simone Weil wrote that feeding the hungry when you have resources to do so is the most obvious of all human obligations. She says that as far back as Ancient Egypt, many believed that people had to show they had helped the hungry in order to justify themselves in the afterlife. Weil writes that Social progress is commonly held to be first of all, &quot;...a transition to a state of human society in which people will not suffer from hunger.&quot;
Social historian Karl Polanyi wrote that before markets became the world&#x27;s dominant form of economic organization in the 19th century, most human societies would either starve all together or not at all, because communities would invariably share their food.

Holodomor

In 1932 and 1933, 3.8 million Ukrainians and other people alone died in the Holodomor, as a result of severe starvation, which was caused by an man-made famine and indrustial plan engineeried by Joseph Stalin and his government. The genocidal famine, caused by Stalin&#x27;s actions and indrustialization heavily affected UkSSR, during this time. Deceased carcasses of starved people littered the streets of large cities like Kharkov, and cannibalism (the consumption of human flesh) was actually common. Consuming the flesh of animals to survive was also common, as well as lynching people and then eating their carcass. People often left their houses, and walked for great distances, solely in search of edible food. Sometimes, entire villages or rural towns were wiped out because of the Holodomor genocidal famine. The genocidal famine lasted for more than nine months, and the oblasts which were most affected by the genocidal famine were the Kharkov and Dnepropetrovsk Oblasts, while the least affected was Chernigov Oblast. The 1937 census of USSR showed how many people died especially in Soviet Ukraine in the Holodomor. The administrators of the 1937 census, were arrested and executed on the orders of Joseph Stalin, because their census showed the severe decimation of UkSSR and therefore made Stalin look bad. The Holodomor was one of the largest genocides itself in human history, taking the form of a man-made famine and indrustial plan. It has been debated by scholars whether the genocide was fully intentional or not. This famine was most likely intentional by Joseph Stalin, who likely wanted to destroy Ukraine for good.

While some of the principles for avoiding famines had been laid out in the first book of the Bible, they were not always understood. Historical hunger relief efforts were often largely left to religious organizations and individual kindness. Even up to early modern times, political leaders often reacted to famine with bewilderment and confusion. From the first age of globalization, which began in the 19th century, it became more common for the elite to consider problems like hunger in global terms. However, as early globalization largely coincided with the high peak of influence for classical liberalism, there was relatively little call for politicians to address world hunger.

In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, the view that politicians ought not to intervene against hunger was increasingly challenged by campaigning journalists. There were also more frequent calls for large scale intervention against world hunger from academics and politicians, such as U.S. President Woodrow Wilson. Funded both by the government and private donations, the U.S. was able to dispatch millions of tons of food aid to European countries during and in the years immediately after WWI, organized by agencies such as the American Relief Administration. Hunger as an academic and social topic came to further prominence in the U.S. thanks to mass media coverage of the issue as a domestic problem during the Great Depression.

===Efforts after World War II===
While there had been increasing attention to hunger relief from the late 19th century, Dr David Grigg has summarised that prior to the end of World War II, world hunger still received relatively little academic or political attention; whereas after 1945 there was an explosion of interest in the topic.

After World War II, a new international politico-economic order came into being, which was later described as Embedded liberalism. For at least the first decade after the war, the United States, then by far the period&#x27;s most dominant national actor, was strongly supportive of efforts to tackle world hunger and to promote international development. It heavily funded the United Nation&#x27;s development programmes, and later the efforts of other multilateral organizations like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank (WB).

The newly established United Nations became a leading player in co-ordinating the global fight against hunger. The UN has three agencies that work to promote food security and agricultural development: the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the World Food Programme (WFP) and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). FAO is the world&#x27;s agricultural knowledge agency, providing policy and technical assistance to developing countries to promote food security, nutrition and sustainable agricultural production, particularly in rural areas. WFP&#x27;s key mission is to deliver food into the hands of the hungry poor. The agency steps in during emergencies and uses food to aid recovery after emergencies. Its longer term approaches to hunger helps the transition from recovery to development. IFAD, with its knowledge of rural poverty and exclusive focus on poor rural people, designs and implements programmes to help those people access the assets, services and opportunities they need to overcome poverty.

Following successful post WWII reconstruction of Germany and Japan, the IMF and WB began to turn their attention to the developing world. A great many civil society actors were also active in trying to combat hunger, especially after the late 1970s when global media began to bring the plight of starving people in places like Ethiopia to wider attention. Most significant of all, especially in the late 1960s and 70s, the Green revolution helped improved agricultural technology propagate throughout the world.

The United States began to change its approach to the problem of world hunger from about the mid 1950s. Influential members of the administration became less enthusiastic about methods they saw as promoting an over reliance on the state, as they feared that might assist the spread of communism. By the 1980s, the previous consensus in favour of moderate government intervention had been displaced across the western world. The IMF and World Bank in particular began to promote market-based solutions. In cases where countries became dependent on the IMF, they sometimes forced national governments to prioritize debt repayments and sharply cut public services. This sometimes had a negative effect on efforts to combat hunger.

Organizations such as Food First raised the issue of food sovereignty and claimed that every country on earth (with the possible minor exceptions of some city-states) has sufficient agricultural capacity to feed its own people, but that the &quot;free trade&quot; economic order, which from the late 1970s to about 2008 had been associated with such institutions as the IMF and World Bank, had prevented this from happening. The World Bank itself claimed it was part of the solution to hunger, asserting that the best way for countries to break the cycle of poverty and hunger was to build export-led economies that provide the financial means to buy foodstuffs on the world market. However, in the early 21st century the World Bank and IMF became less dogmatic about promoting free market reforms. They increasingly returned to the view that government intervention does have a role to play, and that it can be advisable for governments to support food security with policies favourable to domestic agriculture, even for countries that do not have a comparative advantage in that area. As of 2012, the World Bank remains active in helping governments to intervene against hunger.

Until at least the 1980s—and, to an extent, the 1990s—the dominant academic view concerning world hunger was that it was a problem of demand exceeding supply. Proposed solutions often focused on boosting food production, and sometimes on birth control. There were exceptions to this, even as early as the 1940s, Lord Boyd-Orr, the first head of the UN&#x27;s FAO, had perceived hunger as largely a problem of distribution, and drew up comprehensive plans to correct this. Few agreed with him at the time, however, and he resigned after failing to secure support for his plans from the US and Great Britain. In 1998, Amartya Sen won a Nobel Prize in part for demonstrating that hunger in modern times is not typically the product of a lack of food. Rather, hunger usually arises from food distribution problems, or from governmental policies in the developed and developing world. It has since been broadly accepted that world hunger results from issues with the distribution as well as the production of food. Sen&#x27;s 1981 essay &quot;Poverty and Famines: An Essay on Entitlement and Deprivation&quot; played a prominent part in forging the new consensus.

In 2007 and 2008, rapidly increasing food prices caused a global food crisis. Food riots erupted in several dozen countries; in at least two cases, Haiti and Madagascar, this led to the toppling of governments. A second &quot;global food crisis&quot; unfolded due to the spike in food prices of late 2010 and early 2011. Fewer food riots occurred, due in part to greater availability of food stock piles for relief. However, several analysts argue the food crisis was one of the causes of the Arab Spring.

===Efforts since the global 2008 crisis===

In the early 21st century, the attention paid to the problem of hunger by the leaders of advanced nations such as those that form the G8 had somewhat subsided. Prior to 2009, large scale efforts to fight hunger were mainly undertaken by governments of the worst affected countries, by civil society actors, and by multilateral and regional organizations. In 2009, Pope Benedict published his third encyclical, Caritas in Veritate, which emphasised the importance of fighting against hunger. The encyclical was intentionally published immediately before the July 2009 G8 Summit to maximise its influence on that event. At the Summit, which took place at L&#x27;Aquila in central Italy, the &quot;L&#x27;Aquila Food Security Initiative&quot; was launched, with a total of US$22 billion committed to combat hunger.

Food prices fell sharply in 2009 and early 2010, though analysts credit this much more to farmers increasing production in response to the 2008 spike in prices, than to the fruits of enhanced government action. However, since the 2009 G8 summit, the fight against hunger became a high-profile issue among the leaders of the worlds major nations and was a prominent part of the agenda for the 2012 G-20 summit.

In April 2012, the Food Assistance Convention was signed, the world&#x27;s first legally binding international agreement on food aid. The May 2012 Copenhagen Consensus recommended that efforts to combat hunger and malnutrition should be the first priority for politicians and private sector philanthropists looking to maximize the effectiveness of aid spending. They put this ahead of other priorities, like the fight against malaria and AIDS. Also in May 2012, U.S. President Barack Obama launched a &quot;new alliance for food security and nutrition&quot;—a broad partnership between private sector, governmental and civil society actors—that aimed to &quot;...achieve sustained and inclusive agricultural growth and raise 50 million people out of poverty over the next 10 years.&quot; The UK&#x27;s prime minister David Cameron held a hunger summit on 12 August, the last day of the 2012 Summer Olympics.

The fight against hunger has also been joined by an increased number of regular people. While folk throughout the world had long contributed to efforts to alleviate hunger in the developing world, there has recently been a rapid increase in the numbers involved in tackling domestic hunger even within the economically advanced nations of the Global North. This had happened much earlier in North America than it did in Europe. In the US, the Reagan administration scaled back welfare the early 1980s, leading to a vast increase of charity sector efforts to help Americans unable to buy enough to eat. According to a 1992 survey of 1000 randomly selected US voters, 77% of Americans had contributed to efforts to feed the hungry, either by volunteering for various hunger relief agencies such as food banks and soup kitchens, or by donating cash or food.
Europe, with its more generous welfare systems, had little awareness of domestic hunger until the food price inflation that began in late 2006, and especially as austerity-imposed welfare cuts began to take effect in 2010. Various surveys reported that upwards of 10% of Europe&#x27;s population had begun to suffer from food insecurity. Especially since 2011, there has been a substantial increase in grass roots efforts to help the hungry by means of food banks, both in the UK and in continental Europe.

By July 2012, the 2012 US drought had already caused a rapid increase in the price of grain and soy, with a knock on effect on the price of meat. As well as affecting hungry people in the US, this caused prices to rise on the global markets; the US is the world&#x27;s biggest exporter of food. This led to much talk of a possible third 21st century global food crisis. The &quot;Financial Times&quot; reported that the BRICS may not be as badly affected as they were in the earlier crises of 2008 and 2011. However, smaller developing countries that must import a substantial portion of their food could be hard hit. The UN and G20 has begun contingency planning so as to be ready to intervene if a third global crisis breaks out.
By August 2013 however, concerns had been allayed, with above average grain harvests expected from major exporters, including Japan, Brazil, Ukraine and the US. 2014 also saw a good worldwide harvest, leading to speculation that grain prices could soon begin to fall.

In an April 2013 summit held in Dublin concerning Hunger, Nutrition, Climate Justice, and the post 2015 MDG framework for global justice, Ireland&#x27;s President Higgins said that only 10% of deaths from hunger are due to armed conflict and natural disasters, with ongoing hunger being both the &quot;greatest ethical failure of the current global system&quot; and the &quot;greatest ethical challenge facing the global community.&quot;
$4.15 billion of new commitments were made to tackle hunger at a June 2013 Hunger Summit held in London, hosted by the governments of Britain and Brazil, together with The Children&#x27;s Investment Fund Foundation.

Despite the hardship caused by the 2007–2009 financial crisis and global increases in food prices that occurred around the same time, the UN&#x27;s global statistics show it was followed by close to year on year reductions in the numbers suffering from hunger around the world. By 2019 however, evidence had mounted that this progress seemed to have gone into reverse over the last four years. The numbers suffering from hunger had risen both in absolute terms and very slightly even as a percentage of the world&#x27;s population.

In 2019, FAO its annual edition of &quot;The State of Food and Agriculture&quot; which asserted that food loss and waste has potential effects on food security and nutrition through changes in the four dimensions of food security: food availability, access, utilization and stability. However, the links between food loss and waste reduction and food security are complex, and positive outcomes are not always certain. Reaching acceptable levels of food security and nutrition inevitably implies certain levels of food loss and waste. Maintaining buffers to ensure food stability requires a certain amount of food to be lost or wasted. At the same time, ensuring food safety involves discarding unsafe food, which then is counted as lost or wasted, while higher-quality diets tend to include more highly perishable foods. How the impacts on the different dimensions of food security play out and affect the food security of different population groups depends on where in the food supply chain the reduction in losses or waste takes place as well as on where nutritionally vulnerable and food-insecure people are located geographically.

In April and May 2020, concerns were expressed that the COVID-19 pandemic could result in a doubling in global hunger unless world leaders acted to prevent this. Agencies such as the WFP warned that this could include the number of people facing acute hunger rising from 135 million to about 265 million by the end of 2020. Indications of extreme hunger were seen in various cities, such as fatal stampedes when word spread that emergency food aid was being handed out. Letters calling for co-ordinated action to offset the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic were written to the G20 and G7, by various actors including NGOs, UN staff, corporations, academics and former national leaders.
The FAO found that 122 million more people experienced hunger in 2022 compared to 2019. Following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, concerns have been raised over hunger resulting from rising food prices. This is forecast to risk civil unrest even in many middle income countries, where government capability to protect their populations was largely exhausted by the Covid pandemic, and has not yet recovered.

==Hunger relief organisations==
Many thousands of hunger relief organisations exist across the world. Some but not all are entirely dedicated to fighting hunger. They range from independent soup kitchens that serve only one locality, to global organisations. Organisations working at the global and regional level will often focus much of their efforts on helping hungry communities to better feed themselves, for example by sharing agricultural technology. With some exceptions, organisations that work just on the local level tend to focus more on providing food directly to hungry people. Many of the entities are connected by a web of national, regional and global alliances that help them share resources, knowledge, and coordinate efforts.

===Global===
The United Nations is central to global efforts to relieve hunger, most especially through the FAO, and also via other agencies: such as WFP, IFAD, WHO and UNICEF. After the Millennium Development Goals expired in 2015, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) became key objectives to shape the world&#x27;s response to development challenges such as hunger. In particular Goal 2: &quot;Zero Hunger&quot; sets globally agreed targets to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture.

Aside from the UN agencies themselves, hundreds of other actors address the problem of hunger on the global level, often involving participation in large umbrella organisations. These include national governments, religious groups, international charities and in some cases international corporations. Though except perhaps in the cases of dedicated charities, the priority these organisations assign to hunger relief may vary from year to year. In many cases the organisations partner with the UN agencies, though often they pursue independent goals. For example, as consensus began to form for the SDG &quot;zero hunger&quot; goal to aim to end hunger by 2030, a number of organizations formed initiatives with the more ambitious target to achieve this outcome early, by 2025:
* In 2013 Caritas International started a Caritas-wide initiative aimed at ending systemic hunger by 2025. The One human family, food for all campaign focuses on awareness raising, improving the impact of Caritas programs and advocating the implementation of the right to food.
* The partnership Compact2025, led by IFPRI with the involvement of UN organisations, NGOs and private foundations develops and disseminates evidence-based advice to politicians and other decision-makers aimed at ending hunger and undernutrition in the coming 10 years, by 2025. It bases its claim that hunger can be ended by 2025 on a report by Shenggen Fan and Paul Polman that analyzed the experiences from Russia, China, Vietnam, Brazil and Thailand and concludes that eliminating hunger and undernutrition was possible by 2025.
* In June 2015, the European Union and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation launched a partnership to combat undernutrition especially in children. The program would initially be implemented in Bangladesh, Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya, Laos and Niger and will help these countries to improve information and analysis about nutrition so they can develop effective national nutrition policies.

==== Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2 or Goal 2) ====
The objective of SDG 2 is to &quot;end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture&quot; by 2030. SDG2 recognizes that dealing with hunger is not only based on increasing food production but also on proper markets, access to land and technology and increased and efficient incomes for farmers.

A report by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) of 2013 argued that the emphasis of the SDGs should be on eliminating hunger and under-nutrition, rather than on poverty, and that attempts should be made to do so by 2025 rather than 2030. The argument is based on an analysis of experiences in Russia, China, Vietnam, Brazil, and Thailand and the fact that people suffering from severe hunger face extra impediments to improving their lives, whether it be by education or work. Three pathways to achieve this were identified: 1) agriculture-led; 2) social protection- and nutrition- intervention-led; or 3) a combination of both of these approaches.

===Regional===
Much of the world&#x27;s regional alliances are located in Africa. For example, the &quot;Alliance for Food Sovereignty in Africa&quot; or the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa.

The Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN has created a partnership that will act through the African Union&#x27;s CAADP framework aiming to end hunger in Africa by 2025. It includes different interventions including support for improved food production, a strengthening of social protection and integration of the right to food into national legislation.

===National===

Examples of hunger relief organisations that operate on the national level include The Trussell Trust in the United Kingdom, the Nalabothu Foundation in India, and Feeding America in the United States.

===Local===
==== Food bank ====

A food bank (or foodbank) is a non-profit, charitable organization that aids in the distribution of food to those who have difficulty purchasing enough to avoid hunger. Food banks tend to run on different operating models depending on where they are located. In the U.S., Australia, and to some extent in Canada, foodbanks tend to perform a warehouse type function, storing and delivering food to front line food orgs, but not giving it directly to hungry peoples themselves. In much of Europe and elsewhere, food banks operate on the &quot;front line&quot; model, where they hand out parcels of uncooked food direct to the hungry, typically giving them enough for several meals which they can eat in their homes. In the U.S and Australia, establishments that hand out uncooked food to individual people are instead called &quot;food pantries&quot;, &quot;food shelves&quot; or &quot;food closets&#x27;.

In Less Developed Countries, there are charity-run food banks that operate on a semi-commercial system that differs from both the more common &quot;warehouse&quot; and &quot;frontline&quot; models. In some rural LDCs such as Malawi, food is often relatively cheap and plentiful for the first few months after the harvest, but then becomes more and more expensive. Food banks in those areas can buy large amounts of food shortly after the harvest, and then as food prices start to rise, they sell it back to local people throughout the year at well below market prices. Such food banks will sometimes also act as centers to provide small holders and subsistence farmers with various forms of support.

==== Soup kitchen ====

A soup kitchen, meal center, or food kitchen is a place where food is offered to the hungry for free or at a below market price. Frequently located in lower-income neighborhoods, they are often staffed by volunteer organizations, such as church or community groups. Soup kitchens sometimes obtain food from a food bank for free or at a low price, because they are considered a charity, which makes it easier for them to feed the many people who require their services.

====Others====
Local establishments calling themselves &quot;food banks&quot; or &quot;soup kitchens&quot; are often run either by Christian churches or less frequently by secular civil society groups. Other religions carry out similar hunger relief efforts, though sometimes with slightly different methods. For example, in the Sikh tradition of Langar, food is served to the hungry direct from Sikh temples. There are exceptions to this, for example in the UK Sikhs run some of the food banks, as well as giving out food direct from their Gurdwaras.

==Hunger and gender==

World Bank studies consistently find that about 60% of those who are hungry are female. Globally, women typically face greater economic barriers compared to men and have access to fewer resources, creating greater obstacles to food security. In both developing and advanced countries, parents sometimes go without food so they can feed their children. Women, however, seem more likely to make this sacrifice than men. Older sources sometimes claim this phenomenon is unique to developing countries, due to greater sexual inequality. More recent findings suggested that mothers often miss meals in advanced economies too. For example, a 2012 study undertaken by Netmums in the UK found that one in five mothers sometimes misses out on food to save their children from hunger.

One partner-households are especially vulnerable to food insecurity and highlight a gender disparity in food security. In the U.S., households with children raised by single-mothers are more likely to be food insecure compared to households with single-fathers. Differences in time allocation between paid work and unpaid work may also be an explanation for increased food disparity in women-lead households, as women tend to dedicate more time to unpaid work comparatively.

In several periods and regions, gender has also been an important factor determining whether or not victims of hunger would make suitable examples for generating enthusiasm for hunger relief efforts. James Vernon, in his &quot;Hunger: A Modern History&quot;, wrote that in Britain before the twentieth century, it was generally only women and children suffering from hunger who could arouse compassion. Men who failed to provide for themselves and their families were often regarded with contempt.

This changed after World War I, where thousands of men who had proved their manliness in combat found themselves unable to secure employment. Similarly, female gender could be advantageous for those wishing to advocate for hunger relief, with Vernon writing that being a woman helped Emily Hobhouse draw the plight of hungry people to wider attention during the Second Boer War.

==Hunger and age==
===United States===
The elderly have an increased risk of going hungry as well as increased negative effects of hunger. In the US the number of seniors experiencing hunger rose 88% between 2001 and 2011.

This age group suffers the most from chronic conditions, including heart disease, diabetes, and respiratory diseases. Eighty percent of this group has a minimum of one chronic condition, and almost 70% have two or more. These illnesses are exacerbated and are more likely to develop under the addition of hunger. A report from 2017 shows that seniors facing this issue are 60% more likely to experience depression than seniors who are not hungry, and 40% are more likely to develop congestive heart failure. The added stress of inconsistent and inadequate feedings make these conditions much more dangerous.

Fixed incomes often limit the elderly&#x27;s ability to freely purchase food necessities. Medical costs and housing may take priority over quality foods. Limited mobility makes it difficult for these individuals to physically leave their homes, especially in areas lacking public transportation or transportation catering to a disabled body. The COVID-19 pandemic made things more difficult, older people statistically suffer worse outcomes, and so could be reluctant to venture out for food.

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) provides aid to low-income seniors in relation to food security. This is an opportunity for seniors who receive benefits to allocate money in their budgets for other needs, such as medical or housing bills. However, participation is extremely low. Fewer than half of eligible seniors are enrolled and receive benefits; 3 out of five seniors are qualified but not enrolled.

<doc id="149424" wikidata="Q7660102" url="?curid=149424" title="Sydney Push">
<text>The Sydney Push was an intellectual subculture in Sydney from the late 1940s to the early 1970s. Its politics were predominantly left-wing libertarianism. The Push operated in a pub culture and included university students, academics, manual workers, musicians, lawyers, criminals, journalists and public servants. Rejection of conventional morality and authoritarianism was a common bond. Students and staff from Sydney University, mainly the Faculty of Arts, were prominent members. In the 1960s, students and staff from the University of New South Wales also became involved.

Well known associates of the Push include Richard Appleton, Jim Baker, Lex Banning, Eva Cox, Robyn Davidson, Margaret Fink, John Flaus, Germaine Greer, Lynne Segal, George Molnar, Robert Hughes, Harry Hooton, Clive James, Barry Humphries, Sasha Soldatow, David Makinson, Jill &quot;Blue&quot; Neville, Paddy McGuinness, Frank Moorhouse, David Perry, Lillian Roxon and Darcy Waters. From 1961 to 1962, poet Les Murray resided in Brian Jenkins&#x27;s Push household at Glen Street, Milsons Point, which became a mecca for associates visiting Sydney from Melbourne and other cities.

==Academic contributors==
Amongst the key intellectual figures in Push debates were philosophers David J. Ivison, George Molnar, Roelof Smilde, Darcy Waters and Jim Baker, as recorded in Baker&#x27;s memoir &quot;Sydney Libertarians and the Push&quot;, published in the libertarian &quot;Broadsheet&quot; in 1975. Other active people included psychologists Terry McMullen, John Maze and Geoff Whiteman, educationist David Ferraro, June Wilson, Les Hiatt, Ian Bedford, Ken Maddock and Alan Olding, among many others listed in the article. An understanding of Sydney libertarian values and social theory can be obtained from their publications, a few of which are available online. There are also interesting critical articles in the Arts Society&#x27;s annual journal &quot;Arna&quot; by Baker and Molnar whose essay on Zamyatin&#x27;s &quot;We&quot; concluded:
... Orwell spins out to its last conclusion the illusion that the fate of freedom depends mainly on the colour of the ruling party. &quot;We&quot;, precisely because it presents its rebels as apolitical, as individualists if you wish, cuts through this falsehood. Zamyatin&#x27;s superior social insight, although presented and presumably gained artistically and not by way of scientific analysis, consists first in his firm rejection of the rationality or finality of history and, second, in his recognition that anarchic protest against those in power, not the capture of power, is at the core of freedom.

Hiatt and Nestor Grivas&#x27;s &quot;Helenic Herald&quot; published a collection of Sydney libertarian essays as &quot;The Sydney Line&quot; in 1963.

==Social and cultural life==

The intellectual life of the Libertarians was mainly pursued in and around the university, including neighbouring pubs like May&#x27;s, the Forest Lodge and the British Lion. On evenings and weekends, it overflowed into the much larger &#x27;downtown&#x27; social milieu known as the Push, which flourished at a succession of pubs and other places of refreshment including the Tudor, Lincoln, Lorenzini&#x27;s Wine Bar and Repin&#x27;s Coffee Shop; however, of greatest notoriety, was the Royal George Hotel in Sussex Street, which Clive James described in his &quot;Unreliable Memoirs&quot;:

The Royal George was the headquarters of the Downtown Push, usually known as just the Push... As well as the Libertarians and the aesthetes there were the small-time gamblers, traditional jazz fans and the homosexual radio repair men who had science fiction as a religion. The back room had tables and chairs. If you stuck your head through the door of the back room you came face to face with the Push. The noise, the smoke and the heterogeneity of physiognomy were too much to take in. It looked like a cartoon on which Hogarth, Daumier and George Grosz had all worked simultaneously, fighting for supremacy.

Since the mid-1950s, before extended pub hours replaced 6 o&#x27;clock closing, Push night-life commonly consisted of a meal at an inexpensive restaurant such as the Athenian or Hellenic Club (&quot;the Greeks&quot;) or La Veneziana (&quot;the Italians&quot;) followed by parties held most nights of the week at private residences. These were very lively occasions with singing of folksongs and bawdy ditties such as &quot;Professor John Glaister&quot; and many others, often accompanied by transvestite piano player Herbert Dye. Accompaniments were also provided by accomplished guitarists and lutenists (Ian McDougall, John Earls, Terry Driscoll, Don Ayrton, Brian Mooney, John Roberts, Don Lee, Beth Schurr, Bill Berry, Marian Henderson and others). Don Henderson, Declan Affley and Martyn Wyndham-Read are three well-known artists who were influenced by their time in the Push.

==Protest and activism==
Sydney Libertarianism adopted an attitude of permanent protest recognisable in the sociological theories of Max Nomad, Vilfredo Pareto and Robert Michels, which predicted the inevitability of elites and the futility of revolutions. They used phrases such as &quot;anarchism without ends&quot;, &quot;non-utopian anarchism&quot;, and &quot;permanent protest&quot; to describe their activities and theories. Others labelled them as the &#x27;futilitarians&#x27;. An early Marx quotation, used by Wilhelm Reich as the motto for his &quot;The Sexual Revolution&quot;, was adopted as a motto, viz:

Since it is not for us to create a plan for the future that will hold for all time, all the more surely what we contemporaries have to do is the uncompromising critical evaluation of all that exists, uncompromising in the sense that our criticism fears neither its own results nor the conflict with the powers that be.

Nevertheless, Push associates regularly assisted in organising and turning out for street demonstrations, e.g., against South African apartheid and in support of victims of the 1960 Sharpeville massacre; against the initial refusal of immigration minister Alexander Downer, Sr. to grant political asylum to three Portuguese merchant seamen who jumped ship in Darwin; and against Australia&#x27;s participation in the Vietnam War.

In line with the Libertarians&#x27; rejection of conventional political models, electoral activism was foreign to the Push, save to urge non-voting and informal voting. At the election after prime minister Harold Holt failed to return from a swim, artist and film-maker David Perry produced a highly acclaimed poster featuring &quot;a continuum of pigs (inspired by Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Animal Farm&quot;)&quot; with the slogan &quot;Whoever you vote for, a politician always gets in.&quot;

==Events in the news==
The most dramatic public event to impinge on the Push was the mysterious Bogle-Chandler case of 1963 and its sequel, a heavily publicised inquest in which several Push personalities gave evidence. Another memorable incident involved the discovery of what news media recognised as a dismembered murder victim in an unlocked trunk at the foot of a city train-station escalator. This was later revealed to be a collection of body parts, the property of a doctor, found and used in a macabre practical joke by a notorious confidence trickster, the late Julian Ashleigh Sellors (known in the Push as &#x27;Flash Ash&#x27;).

==Dispersal after 1964==
The year 1964 saw the gradual demise of the Royal George Hotel as the prime focal venue of the Sydney Push which dispersed its bustling social life to other traditional venues like the Newcastle, Orient and Port Jackson hotels in The Rocks near Circular Quay and the Rose, Crown and Thistle at Paddington, New South Wales, but also to alternative central-city pubs including the United States and Edinburgh Castle. By the early 1970s, the Criterion Hotel on the corner of Liverpool and Sussex Streets had become the watering hole of the last of the Push diehards. Meanwhile, Push hangers-on and &#x27;tourists&#x27;, now numbering hundreds, patronised pubs like the Four-in-Hand (Paddington) and the Forth and Clyde at Balmain, but these were venues of social entertainment, lacking the intellectual camaraderie, the informal folksong and the bohemian flavour of the &#x27;George&#x27;.

The retired education professor Alan Barcan has published a personal account of his view of activism at Sydney University during the 1960s. Though he was not an eyewitness of Push life, he provides some relevant insights into how student life became infected by Push doctrines of freedom and rebellion, to a point at which the social movement was superseded and its leading personalities were dispersed or replaced with a new breed of social critics. As described by Barcan, this period saw the emergence of mainstream talents like poets Les Murray and Geoffrey Lehmann, journalists David Solomon, Mungo MacCallum (Jnr) and Laurie Oakes, Oz magazine satirists Richard Neville, Richard Walsh and Martin Sharp, and maverick writer Bob Ellis. These were people who did not actively embrace the Push life but were strongly influenced by it.

Push personalities who emigrated to the United Kingdom included Clive James, Paddy McGuinness, Chester (Philip Graham) and Ian Parker (pictured above) who returned to Sydney in the late 1970s and was knocked down and killed while drunk, in Dixon Street. For some reason, a false account was promulgated that he died in a London street. Paddy McGuinness returned to Australia in 1971, working as a film critic, Labor ministerial staffer, right-wing newspaper columnist and journal editor until his death in 2007. Folksinger John Earls went to Bolivia and former &quot;Tribune&quot; (Communist Party of Australia newspaper) cartoonist Harry Reade went to join Fidel Castro&#x27;s revolution in Cuba (and returned in 1971 at the same time as Paddy McGuinness). The disabled poet Lex Banning travelled to England and Greece from 1962 until 1964 but returned and died in Sydney in 1965. The folksinger Don Ayrton departed to settle at Kuranda in Queensland where he committed suicide in 1982. A tragedy occurred as Paddy McGuinness was departing for Italy by ship in May 1963. The farewelling crowd included a young Push lady, Janne (or Jan) Millar, who fell to the concrete dock floor from a height and suffered fatal head injuries. A number of other tragic deaths occurred in this decade, including some from substance abuse which was becoming a regular part of Sydney culture at the time.

Many young Push associates simply moved on to careers in the professions and academia. A reunion organised by André Frankovits at the Royal George/Slip Inn in 2000 attracted around 280. Another, at the Harold Park Hotel in February 2012, drew nearly 200, including some who had travelled from Hong Kong, North Queensland and Perth to attend. Later annual re-unions have attracted around 50.

On the demise of the Push, Anne Coombs has stated: &quot;[... things began to change] in 1964, the year the Beatles came and brought into the open that new phenomenon: &#x27;youth culture&#x27;.&quot; Citing this, Alan Barcan added &quot;In advocating free love and opposition to authority, the Push and the Libertarians anticipated the new post-1968 morality. But the adoption of many of their ideas by society undermined their &quot;&quot;&quot;.

<text>The Verve were an English rock band formed in Wigan in 1990 by lead vocalist Richard Ashcroft, guitarist Nick McCabe, bass guitarist Simon Jones and drummer Peter Salisbury. Guitarist and keyboard player Simon Tong later became a member in their first reunion only.

Beginning with a psychedelic, shoegaze sound with their debut LP, &quot;A Storm in Heaven&quot;, by 1997 the band had released three EPs and three albums. They endured name and line-up changes, break-ups, health problems, drug abuse and various lawsuits. The band&#x27;s commercial breakthrough was the 1997 album &quot;Urban Hymns&quot;, one of the best-selling albums in UK history. It features the hit singles &quot;Bitter Sweet Symphony&quot;, &quot;The Drugs Don&#x27;t Work&quot;, &quot;Sonnet&quot; and &quot;Lucky Man&quot;. In 1998, the band won two Brit Awards, winning Best British Group, appeared on the cover of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in March, and in February 1999, &quot;Bitter Sweet Symphony&quot; was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Rock Song.

Soon after their commercial peak, The Verve disbanded in 1999, citing internal conflicts. According to &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, &quot;the group&#x27;s rise was the culmination of a long, arduous journey that began at the dawn of the decade and went on to encompass a major breakup, multiple lawsuits, and an extensive diet of narcotics&quot;. During an eight-year split, Ashcroft dismissed talk of a reunion, saying: &quot;You&#x27;re more likely to get all four Beatles on stage.&quot; The band&#x27;s original line-up reunited in 2007, embarking on a tour later that year and releasing the album &quot;Forth&quot; in 2008, which spawned the hit single &quot;Love Is Noise&quot;. Amid revived tensions, the band broke up for the third time in 2009.

==History==
===Formation and &quot;Verve&quot; (1990–1992)===
The founding members of the Verve met at Winstanley Sixth Form College, in Wigan, Greater Manchester, when Liam Begley introduced Richard Ashcroft to the other band members. The band was initially known as just Verve, and their first gig was at a friend&#x27;s birthday party at the Honeysuckle Inn, in Wigan, on 15 August 1990. Most of the band&#x27;s early material was created through extensive jam sessions. Fronted by Ashcroft, the band caused a buzz in early 1991 for their ability to captivate audiences with their musical textures and avant-garde sensibilities.

The group were signed by Hut Records in 1991 and their first studio releases in 1992, &quot;All in the Mind&quot;, &quot;She&#x27;s a Superstar&quot;, and &quot;Gravity Grave&quot; (along with the December 1992 EP &quot;Verve&quot;) saw the band become a critical success, making an impression with freeform guitar work by McCabe and unpredictable vocals by Ashcroft. Those first three singles reached the first spot in the UK Indie charts, and &quot;She&#x27;s a Superstar&quot; entered the UK Top 75 Singles Chart. The band saw some support from these early days in the United States in some music scenes in big cities like New York connected with psychedelic music.

===&quot;A Storm in Heaven&quot; (1993–1994)===
1993&#x27;s &quot;A Storm in Heaven&quot; was the band&#x27;s full-length debut, produced by record producer John Leckie. &quot;Blue&quot; was released as the lead single and again managed to enter in the UK Top 75 at No. 69 and reached No. 2 in the Indie charts. The album was a critical success, but was only a moderate commercial success, reaching No. 27 in the UK album chart that summer. The second single from the album, &quot;Slide Away&quot;, topped the UK indie rock charts. During this period the band played a number of gigs with Oasis who, at the time, were relatively unknown. Furthermore, the band supported The Smashing Pumpkins on the European Part of their Siamese Dream Tour in autumn of 1993.

In 1994, the band released the album &quot;No Come Down&quot;, a compilation of B-sides plus a live version of &quot;Gravity Grave&quot; performed at Glastonbury Festival in 1993. It was the band&#x27;s first release under the name &quot;The Verve&quot;, following legal difficulties with jazz label Verve Records. The band then played on the travelling US alternative rock festival Lollapalooza in the summer of 1994. A new mix of &quot;Blue&quot; was released in the US to promote the band. The tour became notorious for the events of 11 July – Ashcroft was hospitalised for dehydration after a massive session of drinking and Salisbury was arrested for destroying a hotel room in Kansas in a drug-fuelled delirium. However, the band were performing again the very next day. Ashcroft later recalled: &quot;At the start, it was an adventure, but America nearly killed us.&quot;

===&quot;A Northern Soul&quot; and first breakup (1995–1996)===
The Verve&#x27;s physical and mental turmoil continued into the chaotic recording sessions of their second album, 1995&#x27;s &quot;A Northern Soul&quot;, produced by Owen Morris. The band departed from the experimental psychedelic sounds of &quot;A Storm in Heaven&quot; and focused more on conventional alternative rock, with Ashcroft&#x27;s vocals taking a more prominent role in the songs, although reminiscent of some of the early work. Around this period, Oasis guitarist and friend of Ashcroft Noel Gallagher dedicated the song &quot;Cast No Shadow&quot; on the album &quot;(What&#x27;s the Story) Morning Glory?&quot; to Ashcroft, who returned the gesture by dedicating the song &quot;A Northern Soul&quot; to Gallagher.

The band released the album&#x27;s first single &quot;This Is Music&quot; in May, and it reached No. 35, their first single to reach the Top 40. It was followed by &quot;On Your Own&quot; in June which performed even better, reaching No. 28. This single was particularly new for the Verve as it was a soulful ballad. The album reached the UK Top 20 upon its release in July, but Ashcroft broke up the band three months later, just before the release of the third single &quot;History&quot;, which reached No. 24 in September. Ashcroft later stated: &quot;I knew that I had to do it earlier on, but I just wouldn&#x27;t face it. Once you&#x27;re not happy in anything, there&#x27;s no point living in it, is there? But my addiction to playing and writing and being in this band was so great that I wouldn&#x27;t do anything about it. It felt awful because it could have been the greatest time of our lives, with &quot;History&quot; doing well, but I still think I can look myself in the mirror in 30 years time and say, &#x27;Yeah man, you did the right thing.&#x27; The others had been through the same thing. It was a mixture of sadness and regret, and relief that we would have some time away.&quot;

Ashcroft reunited with Jones and Salisbury just a few weeks after the break-up, but McCabe did not rejoin them. The new band hired former Suede guitarist Bernard Butler, but he spent only a couple of days with the band. The band then chose Simon Tong, a school friend credited with originally teaching Ashcroft and Jones to play guitar. The band made no live appearances in 1996, apart from a solo performance from Ashcroft supporting Oasis in New York; the year was spent playing and recording songs for a new album.

===&quot;Urban Hymns,&quot; success and second breakup (1997–1999)===
In early 1997, Ashcroft asked McCabe to return, saying: &quot;I got to the point where nothing other than The Verve would do for me.&quot; McCabe obliged and with the new line-up in place (Tong remained on guitar alongside McCabe), the group went through a &quot;spiritual&quot; recording process to finish their third album, &quot;Urban Hymns.&quot;

For the first time, the Verve achieved commercial success with their new material. The first single, &quot;Bitter Sweet Symphony&quot;, entered the UK charts at number 2 in June 1997. The BBC wrote that it &quot;became one of the anthems of the year&quot; and &quot;became almost inescapable&quot; after it was used in a television car advert.

The music video, which received heavy rotation on MTV, sees Ashcroft walking down a busy London pavement, oblivious to what is going on around and refusing to change his stride or direction. The song is based on a sample from a 1965 version of the Rolling Stones&#x27; song &quot;The Last Time&quot; by the Andrew Oldham Orchestra; Allen Klein, who owned the copyright, refused clearance for the sample, and took control of the songwriting credits and royalties.

In August 1997, The Verve began playing their first gigs in two years, beginning the Urban Hymns Tour. The next single, &quot;The Drugs Don&#x27;t Work&quot;, gave the band their first UK number one in September. &quot;Urban Hymns&quot; reached number one on the UK Albums Chart that month, knocking off Oasis&#x27; highly anticipated album &quot;Be Here Now&quot;. The Verve saw an overwhelming increase in popularity overseas; it reached the US top 30, going platinum in the process, and &quot;Bitter Sweet Symphony&quot; reached number 12 on the US charts, their highest ever American position. Critic Mike Gee of &quot;iZINE&quot; said of this time that the Verve &quot;had become the greatest band in the world. ...The Verve were no longer the question mark or the cliché. They were the statement and the definition.&quot; By November the band released &quot;Lucky Man&quot; in the UK and reached number 7. At the 1998 Brit Awards, The Verve won the awards for Best British Group and Best British Album (&quot;Urban Hymns&quot;). The band&#x27;s singles were given extensive airplay on US rock stations and Ashcroft, and bandmates, appeared on the cover of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine in March 1998. Then, as the band was on a successful tour to promote the album, Jones collapsed on stage. At the 1998 MTV Video Music Awards, &quot;Bitter Sweet Symphony&quot; was nominated for Video of the Year, Best Group Video, and Best Alternative Video.

On 24 May 1998, The Verve played a homecoming concert in front of 33,000 fans in the grounds of Haigh Hall &amp; Country Park, Aspull, supported by Beck and John Martyn. The band then played gigs in mainland Europe, but, on 7 June, a post-show fight at Düsseldorf-Philipshalle left McCabe with a broken hand and Ashcroft with a sore jaw. After this, McCabe decided he could not tolerate the pressures of life on the road any longer and pulled out of the tour, leaving the band&#x27;s future in jeopardy, with rumours of a split circulating in the press. The band continued with session musician B. J. Cole replacing McCabe, whose guitar work was also sampled and triggered on stage. The band played another American tour, which was riddled with problems as venues were downsized and support act Massive Attack dropped out. The band returned to England for two headline performances at V Festival, which received poor reviews; &quot;NME&quot; wrote that &quot;where songs used to spiral upwards and outwards, they now simply fizzle tamely&quot;. The Verve played their last gig at Slane Castle in Ireland on 29 August. A long period of inactivity followed. In February 1999, &quot;Bitter Sweet Symphony&quot; was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Rock Song. Finally, in April 1999, it was announced that The Verve had again split up.

===Post-breakup (2000–2006)===
By the time The Verve had split, Ashcroft was already working on solo material accompanied by, among others, Salisbury and Cole. In 2000, he released his first solo album, &quot;Alone with Everybody&quot;, which reached number 1 in the UK album charts.

The former members sometimes expressed bitter sentiments about the band&#x27;s later years. In his only interview after the split, McCabe said of &quot;Urban Hymns&quot;: &quot;By the time I got my parts in there it&#x27;s not really a music fan&#x27;s record. It just sits nicely next to the Oasis record.&quot; During his solo career, Ashcroft expressed regret at having asked McCabe to return for the album instead of releasing it under his own name, saying: &quot;Imagine being the guy that&#x27;s written an album on his own, bottles it near the end, feels like there&#x27;s unfinished business, rings Nick McCabe up who adds some guitars, puts it out as the Verve and the same problems arise again. Imagine being that mug. I&#x27;ve now got to rewrite history. Everyone thinks those songs are somehow associated with another bunch of people that I&#x27;m not with now.&quot; Jones claimed that &quot;The Verve were going off in a direction of strings and ballads, and that&#x27;s not where I was coming from at all. Loud guitars is it for me&quot;, though noting that this was not why the band split up.

===Reunion and &quot;Forth&quot; (2007–2008)===
Ashcroft had been adamant that The Verve would not re-form, once remarking: &quot;You&#x27;re more likely to get all four Beatles on stage&quot;. However, after Ashcroft learned that Salisbury was in contact with McCabe over a possible side project, Ashcroft contacted McCabe and Jones, making peace with them, and the band re-formed. Tong was not asked to rejoin, so as to keep the internal issues that split the band up a decade ago to an absolute minimum. Jones explained this decision by stating: &quot;It would have been too hard, it&#x27;s hard enough for the four of us. If you bring more people to it, it&#x27;s harder to communicate and communication has always been our difficulty&quot;. Paradoxically, McCabe would state years later on his Twitter account, that he intended to include the electric violinist and arranger Davide Rossi as a new member of the group. On 26 June 2007, the band&#x27;s reunion was announced by Jo Whiley on BBC Radio 1. The band, reuniting in their original line-up, announced they would tour in November 2007, and release an album in 2008. The band stated: &quot;We are getting back together for the joy of music&quot;, though they turned down a multi-album deal offer &quot;because the &#x27;treadmill&#x27; of releasing albums and touring marked the beginning of the end for the band a decade ago&quot;.
Tickets for their six-gig tour in early November 2007 sold out in less than 20 minutes. The tour began in Glasgow on 2 November, and included 6 performances at the Carling Academy Glasgow, The Empress Ballroom and the London Roundhouse. Since the 6-gig tour went extremely well in sales, the band booked a second, bigger tour for December. They played at O2 arena, the SECC in Glasgow, the Odyssey in Belfast, the Nottingham Arena and Manchester Central. Each show from the first and second part of the tour were sold out immediately. The band continued touring in 2008. They played at most of the biggest summer festivals and a few headline shows all over North America, Europe, Japan and the UK between April and August. Including shows at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, also at the Madison Square Garden Theater, and the Pinkpop festival, Glastonbury Festival, T in the Park, the V Festival, Oxegen Festival, Rock Werchter, Rock am Ring and Rock im Park and The Eden Project Sessions.

New single &quot;Love Is Noise&quot; was premiered by Zane Lowe on BBC Radio 1 on 23 June. They performed at the coveted Sunday night slot on the Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury on 29 June, closing the show with the new song. The Verve released a free download of a non-album track, &quot;Mover&quot;, on 30 June. The song had been performed by the band in 1994, but had never seen a proper recording until the reunion. The track was available for download from their official website for one week only.

The band announced the new album&#x27;s title: &quot;Forth&quot;, which was released in the UK on 25 August and the following day in North America. The album reached No. 1 on the UK Albums Chart on 31 August. The lead single &quot;Love Is Noise&quot; was released in the UK on 3 August digitally and one week later (11 August) on its physical form, peaking at No. 4 in the UK. The song was a moderate success in Europe, charting at No. 16 in the European chart (with 6 weeks in the Top 20). &quot;Rather Be&quot;, the second single from the album, was released in November but did not become as successful as &quot;Love Is Noise&quot; was, peaking at number 56 on the UK Singles Chart.

===Third breakup (2009–present)===
In August 2009, &quot;The Guardian&quot; speculated that The Verve had broken up for a third time, with Jones and McCabe no longer on speaking terms with Ashcroft as they felt he was using the reunion as a vehicle to get his solo career back on track. Being asked about the supposed split, Ashcroft told &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, &quot;I can confirm we did what we set out to do [...] Right now there are no plans to be doing anything in the near future.&quot;

Among the reasons for the breakup, it is known that in August 2008, McCabe was ordered to quit drinking by the band&#x27;s management team, however, the damage had been done to the band&#x27;s ambient and it was at a point of no return.

McCabe, Jones, Rossi (who served as a touring musician of the Verve) and the drummer Mig Schillace started a new band, The Black Ships, who later changed their name to Black Submarine. In September 2017, McCabe said he had not spoken to Ashcroft for over a year and that a possible reunion would be unlikely in the foreseeable future. That year also saw the release of the 20th-anniversary version of &quot;Urban Hymns&quot;.

In April 2019, the Rolling Stones agreed to return the royalties and songwriting credits for &quot;Bitter Sweet Symphony&quot; to Ashcroft. Ashcroft announced the agreement in May, when he received the Ivor Novello Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors. He said it was a &quot;kind and magnanimous&quot; move, and said: &quot;I never had a personal beef with the Stones. They&#x27;ve always been the greatest rock and roll band in the world. It&#x27;s been a fantastic development. It&#x27;s life-affirming in a way.&quot;

==Musical style==
Jason Ankeny of AllMusic described the Verve&#x27;s sound as &quot;&quot;, saying that it fused the &quot;exploratory vision of &#x27;60s-era psychedelia with the shimmering atmospherics of the shoegaze aesthetic&quot;. The band have been classified as neo-psychedelia, Britpop and alternative rock.

<text>A subnetwork, or subnet, is a logical subdivision of an IP network. The practice of dividing a network into two or more networks is called subnetting.

Computers that belong to the same subnet are addressed with an identical group of its most-significant bits of their IP addresses. This results in the logical division of an IP address into two fields: the &quot;network number&quot; or &quot;routing prefix&quot;, and the &quot;rest field&quot; or &quot;host identifier&quot;. The &quot;rest field&quot; is an identifier for a specific host or network interface.

The &quot;routing prefix&quot; may be expressed as the first address of a network, written in Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation, followed by a slash character (&quot;/&quot;), and ending with the bit-length of the prefix. For example, is the prefix of the Internet Protocol version 4 network starting at the given address, having 24 bits allocated for the network prefix, and the remaining 8 bits reserved for host addressing. Addresses in the range to belong to this network, with as the subnet broadcast address. The IPv6 address specification is a large address block with 296 addresses, having a 32-bit routing prefix.

For IPv4, a network may also be characterized by its subnet mask or netmask, which is the bitmask that, when applied by a bitwise AND operation to any IP address in the network, yields the routing prefix. Subnet masks are also expressed in dot-decimal notation like an IP address. For example, the prefix would have the subnet mask .

Traffic is exchanged between subnets through routers when the routing prefixes of the source address and the destination address differ. A router serves as a logical or physical boundary between the subnets.

The benefits of subnetting an existing network vary with each deployment scenario. In the address allocation architecture of the Internet using CIDR and in large organizations, efficient allocation of address space is necessary. Subnetting may also enhance routing efficiency, or have advantages in network management when subnets are administratively controlled by different entities in a larger organization. Subnets may be arranged logically in a hierarchical architecture, partitioning an organization&#x27;s network address space into a tree-like routing structure, or other structures, such as meshes.

==Network addressing and routing==

Computers participating in an IP network have at least one network address. Usually, this address is unique to each device and can either be configured automatically by a network service with the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), manually by an administrator, or automatically by the operating system with stateless address autoconfiguration.

An address fulfills the functions of identifying the host and locating it on the network in destination routing. The most common network addressing architecture is Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4), but its successor, IPv6, has been increasingly deployed since approximately 2006. An IPv4 address consists of 32 bits. An IPv6 address consists of 128 bits. In both architectures, an IP address is divided into two logical parts, the &quot;network prefix&quot; and the &quot;host identifier&quot;. All hosts on a subnet have the same network prefix. This prefix occupies the most-significant bits of the address. The number of bits allocated within a network to the prefix may vary between subnets, depending on the network architecture. The host identifier is a unique local identification and is either a host number on the local network or an interface identifier.

This addressing structure permits the selective routing of IP packets across multiple networks via special gateway computers, called routers, to a destination host if the network prefixes of origination and destination hosts differ, or sent directly to a target host on the local network if they are the same. Routers constitute logical or physical borders between the subnets, and manage traffic between them. Each subnet is served by a designated default router but may consist internally of multiple physical Ethernet segments interconnected by network switches.

The routing prefix of an address is identified by the &quot;subnet mask&quot;, written in the same form used for IP addresses. For example, the subnet mask for a routing prefix that is composed of the most-significant 24 bits of an IPv4 address is written as .

The modern standard form of specification of the network prefix is CIDR notation, used for both IPv4 and IPv6. It counts the number of bits in the prefix and appends that number to the address after a &quot;slash&quot; (/) character separator. This notation was introduced with Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR).
In IPv6 this is the only standards-based form to denote network or routing prefixes.

For example, the IPv4 network with the subnet mask is written as , and the IPv6 notation designates the address and its network prefix consisting of the most significant 32 bits.

In classful networking in IPv4, before the introduction of CIDR, the network prefix could be directly obtained from the IP address, based on its highest-order bit sequence. This determined the class (A, B, C) of the address and therefore the subnet mask. Since the introduction of CIDR, however, the assignment of an IP address to a network interface requires two parameters, the address and a subnet mask.

Given an IPv4 source address, its associated subnet mask, and the destination address, a router can determine whether the destination is on a locally connected network or a remote network. The subnet mask of the destination is not needed, and is generally not known to a router. For IPv6, however, on-link determination is different in detail and requires the Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP). IPv6 address assignment to an interface carries no requirement of a matching on-link prefix and vice versa, with the exception of link-local addresses.

Since each locally connected subnet must be represented by a separate entry in the routing tables of each connected router, subnetting increases routing complexity. However, by careful design of the network, routes to collections of more distant subnets within the branches of a tree hierarchy can be aggregated into a supernetwork and represented by single routes.

==Internet Protocol version 4==
===Determining the network prefix===
An IPv4 subnet mask consists of 32 bits; it is a sequence of ones (&quot;1&quot;) followed by a block of zeros (&quot;0&quot;). The ones indicate bits in the address used for the network prefix and the trailing block of zeros designates that part as being the host identifier.

The following example shows the separation of the network prefix and the host identifier from an address () and its associated subnet mask (). The operation is visualized in a table using binary address formats.

The result of the bitwise AND operation of IP address and the subnet mask is the network prefix . The host part, which is , is derived by the bitwise AND operation of the address and the ones&#x27; complement of the subnet mask.

===Subnetting===
Subnetting is the process of designating some high-order bits from the host part as part of the network prefix and adjusting the subnet mask appropriately. This divides a network into smaller subnets. The following diagram modifies the above example by moving 2 bits from the host part to the network prefix to form four smaller subnets each one quarter of the previous size.
===Special addresses and subnets===
IPv4 uses specially designated address formats to facilitate recognition of special address functionality. The first and the last subnets obtained by subnetting a larger network have traditionally had a special designation and, early on, special usage implications. In addition, IPv4 uses the &quot;all ones&quot; host address, i.e. the last address within a network, for broadcast transmission to all hosts on the link.
The first subnet obtained from subnetting a larger network has all bits in the subnet bit group set to zero. It is therefore called &quot;subnet zero&quot;. The last subnet obtained from subnetting a larger network has all bits in the subnet bit group set to one. It is therefore called the &quot;all-ones subnet&quot;.

The IETF originally discouraged the production use of these two subnets. When the prefix length is not available, the larger network and the first subnet have the same address, which may lead to confusion. Similar confusion is possible with the broadcast address at the end of the last subnet. Therefore, reserving the subnet values consisting of all zeros and all ones on the public Internet was recommended, reducing the number of available subnets by two for each subnetting. This inefficiency was removed, and the practice was declared obsolete in 1995 and is only relevant when dealing with legacy equipment.

Although the all-zeros and the all-ones host values are reserved for the network address of the subnet and its broadcast address, respectively, in systems using CIDR all subnets are available in a subdivided network. For example, a network can be divided into sixteen usable networks. Each broadcast address, i.e. , , …, , reduces only the host count in each subnets.

===Subnet host count===
The number of subnets available and the number of possible hosts in a network may be readily calculated. For instance, the network may be subdivided into the following four subnets. The highlighted two address bits become part of the network number in this process.
The remaining bits after the subnet bits are used for addressing hosts within the subnet. In the above example, the subnet mask consists of 26 bits, making it 255.255.255.192, leaving 6 bits for the host identifier. This allows for 62 host combinations (26−2).

In general, the number of available hosts on a subnet is 2&quot;h&quot;−2, where &quot;h&quot; is the number of bits used for the host portion of the address. The number of available subnets is 2&quot;n&quot;, where &quot;n&quot; is the number of bits used for the network portion of the address.

There is an exception to this rule for 31-bit subnet masks, which means the host identifier is only one bit long for two permissible addresses. In such networks, usually point-to-point links, only two hosts (the endpoints) may be connected and a specification of network and broadcast addresses is not necessary.

==Internet Protocol version 6==
The design of the IPv6 address space differs significantly from IPv4. The primary reason for subnetting in IPv4 is to improve efficiency in the utilization of the relatively small address space available, particularly to enterprises. No such limitations exist in IPv6, as the large address space available, even to end-users, is not a limiting factor.

As in IPv4, subnetting in IPv6 is based on the concepts of variable-length subnet masking (VLSM) and the Classless Inter-Domain Routing methodology. It is used to route traffic between the global allocation spaces and within customer networks between subnets and the Internet at large.

A compliant IPv6 subnet always uses addresses with 64 bits in the host identifier. Given the address size of 128 bits, it therefore has a /64 routing prefix. Although it is technically possible to use smaller subnets, they are impractical for local area networks based on Ethernet technology, because 64 bits are required for stateless address autoconfiguration. The Internet Engineering Task Force recommends the use of subnets for point-to-point links, which have only two hosts.

IPv6 does not implement special address formats for broadcast traffic or network numbers, and thus all addresses in a subnet are acceptable for host addressing. The all-zeroes address is reserved as the subnet-router anycast address. The subnet router anycast address is the lowest address in the subnet, so it looks like the “network address”. If a router has multiple subnets on the same link, then it has multiple subnet router anycast addresses on that link. The first and last address in any network or subnet is not allowed to be assigned to any individual host.

In the past, the recommended allocation for an IPv6 customer site was an address space with a 48-bit () prefix. However, this recommendation was revised to encourage smaller blocks, for example using 56-bit prefixes. Another common allocation size for residential customer networks has a 64-bit prefix.

<text>Karl Menger (January 13, 1902 – October 5, 1985) was an Austrian–American mathematician, the son of the economist Carl Menger. In mathematics, Menger studied the theory of algebras and the dimension theory of low-regularity (&quot;rough&quot;) curves and regions; in graph theory, he is credited with Menger&#x27;s theorem. Outside of mathematics, Menger has substantial contributions to game theory and social sciences.

==Biography==
Karl Menger was a student of Hans Hahn and received his PhD from the University of Vienna in 1924. L. E. J. Brouwer invited Menger in 1925 to teach at the University of Amsterdam. In 1927, he returned to Vienna to accept a professorship there. In 1930 and 1931 he was visiting lecturer at Harvard University and the Rice Institute. From 1937 to 1946 he was a professor at the University of Notre Dame. From 1946 to 1971, he was a professor at Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) in Chicago. In 1983, IIT awarded Menger a Doctor of Humane Letters and Sciences degree.

==Contributions to mathematics==

His most famous popular contribution was the Menger sponge (mistakenly known as Sierpinski&#x27;s sponge), a three-dimensional version of the Sierpiński carpet. It is also related to the Cantor set.

With Arthur Cayley, Menger is considered one of the founders of distance geometry; especially by having formalized definitions of the notions of &quot;angle&quot; and of &quot;curvature&quot; in terms of directly measurable physical quantities, namely ratios of &quot;distance&quot; values. The characteristic mathematical expressions appearing in those definitions are Cayley–Menger determinants.

He was an active participant of the Vienna Circle, which had discussions in the 1920s on social science and philosophy. During that time, he published an influential result on the St. Petersburg paradox with applications to the utility theory in economics; this result has since been criticised as fundamentally misleading. Later he contributed to the development of game theory with Oskar Morgenstern.

Menger was a founding member of the Econometric Society.

==Legacy==
Menger&#x27;s longest and last academic post was at the Illinois Institute of Technology, which hosts an annual IIT Karl Menger Lecture and offers the IIT Karl Menger Student Award to an exceptional student for scholarship each year.
