<text>Uno (; from Spanish and Italian for &#x27;one&#x27;), stylized as UNO, is a proprietary American shedding-type card game originally developed in 1971 by Merle Robbins in Reading, Ohio, a suburb of Cincinnati, that housed International Games Inc., a gaming company acquired by Mattel on January 23, 1992.

Played with a specially printed deck, the game is derived from the crazy eights family of card games which, in turn, is based on the traditional German game of mau-mau.

==History==

The game was originally developed in 1971 by Merle Robbins in Reading, Ohio, a suburb of Cincinnati. When his family and friends began to play more and more, he and his family mortgaged their home to raise $8,000 to have 5,000 copies of the game made. He sold it from his barbershop at first, and local businesses began to sell it as well. Robbins later sold the rights to Uno to a group of friends headed by Robert Tezak, a funeral parlor owner in Joliet, Illinois, for $50,000 plus royalties of 10 cents per game. Tezak formed International Games, Inc., to market Uno, with offices behind his funeral parlor. The games were produced by Lewis Saltzman of Saltzman Printers in Maywood, Illinois.

In 1992, International Games became part of the Mattel family of companies.

==Official rules==
The aim of the game is to be the first player to score 500 points, achieved (usually over several rounds of play) by being the first to play all of one&#x27;s own cards and scoring points for the cards still held by the other players.

Uno includes 108 cards: 25 in each of four color suits (red, yellow, green, blue), each suit consisting of one zero, two each of 1 through 9, and two each of the action cards &quot;Skip&quot;, &quot;Draw Two&quot;, and &quot;Reverse&quot;. The deck also contains four &quot;Wild&quot; cards and four &quot;Wild Draw Four&quot;. Sets manufactured since 2018 include 112 cards, adding one &quot;Wild Shuffle Hands&quot; and three customizable Wild cards.
For each hand, a dealer is determined by having each player randomly draw one card from the deck. The player with the highest number card deals, and all cards are reshuffled into the deck to begin the dealing.

To start a hand, seven cards are dealt to each player, and the top card of the remaining deck is flipped over and set aside to begin the discard pile. The player to the dealer&#x27;s left plays first unless the first card on the discard pile is an action or Wild card (see below). On a player&#x27;s turn, they must do one of the following:
* play one card matching the discard in color, number, or symbol
* play a Wild card, or a Wild Draw Four card if allowed to (see restrictions below)
* draw the top card from the deck, and optionally play it if possible

Cards are played by laying them face-up on top of the discard pile. Play initially proceeds clockwise around the table.

Action or Wild cards have the following effects:

* A player who draws a card from the deck must choose whether to play that card immediately or keep it. No cards already in their hand may be played on that turn.
* A Wild card may be played on any turn, even if the player holding it has cards that will match the current color, number, and/or symbol.
* A Wild Draw Four card may only be played if the player holding it has no cards matching the current color. The player may have cards of a different color matching the current number/symbol or a Wild card and still play the Wild Draw Four card. A player who plays a Wild Draw Four may be challenged by the next player in sequence (see Penalties) to prove that their hand meets this condition. An illegally played Wild Draw Four card incurs no penalty for its user unless challenged.
* A player using a Wild or Wild Draw Four card must declare the new matching color before ending their turn, and may declare the current color if desired.
* If the draw deck runs out during play, the top discard is set aside and the rest of the pile is shuffled to create a new deck. Play then proceeds normally.
* It is illegal to trade cards of any sort with any other player at any time.

A player who plays their penultimate card must call &quot;Uno&quot; as a warning to the other players.

The first player to get rid of their last card (&quot;going out&quot;) wins the hand and scores points for the cards held by each other player. Number cards count their face value, all action cards count 20, and Wild and Wild Draw Four cards count 50. If a Draw Two or Wild Draw Four card is played to go out, the next player in the sequence must draw the appropriate number of cards before the score is tallied.

The first player to score 500 points wins the game.

===Penalties===
* If a player does not call &quot;Uno&quot; while laying down their penultimate card and is caught before the next player in sequence takes their turn (i.e., plays a card from their hand, draws from the deck, or touches the discard pile), they must draw two cards as a penalty. If the player is not caught in time or remembers to call &quot;Uno&quot; before being caught, no penalty applies to that player.
* If a player plays a Wild Draw Four card, the next player in turn order may choose to challenge its use. The player who used the Wild Draw Four must privately show their hand to the challenging player in order to demonstrate that they had no cards of prior matching color. If the challenge is successful, the challenged player must draw four cards instead and play continues with the challenger. Otherwise, the challenger must draw six cards – the four cards they were already required to draw plus two more cards – and miss their turn. In either case, the Wild Draw Four stays with its chosen color.

===Two-player game===
In a two-player game, the Reverse card acts like a Skip card; when played, the other player misses a turn. This rule is not mentioned in the instruction sheets of modern copies of the game.

===House rules===
The following house rules are suggested in some official Uno instruction sets to alter the game:
* Progressive or Stacking Uno: If a draw card is played, and the next player in turn order has a card with the same symbol, that player can play that card and &quot;stack&quot; the penalty, which adds to the current penalty and passes it to the next player (although a +4 cannot be stacked on a +2, or vice versa). This house rule is so commonly used that there was widespread Twitter surprise in 2019 when Mattel stated that stacking was not part of the standard rules of Uno.
* Seven-O: Every time a &quot;7&quot; is played, whoever played it must swap hands with another player of their choice before ending their turn. Every time a &quot;0&quot; is played, all players pass their hands to the next player in the current direction of play, after which play continues normally.
* Jump-In: If a player has exactly the same card (both number and color) as the top card of the discard pile, they may play it immediately, even if it is not their turn. Play then continues as if that player had just taken their turn.

===2018 rule changes===
The two new types of Wild cards have the following functions:

* Wild Shuffle Hands: The player using this card collects all cards held by all players, then shuffles and re-deals them, starting from the player to their left.
* Wild Customizable: There are three copies of this; these cards are blank and can have a house rule assigned to them.

Each of these cards can be played on any turn and is worth 40 points when a player goes out.

===2022 rule changes===
The goal to reach a certain number of points has been demoted and replaced with the one commonly used by most players, which is to be the first player to go out. If played for points, each Wild card is worth 50 points regardless of type. There is no longer an official method to determine the dealer. In addition, if the first card flipped at the start of a game is an Action or Wild card, it is ignored and another card is flipped until a number card comes up.

== Card and deck styles ==
Modern Uno action cards bear symbols which denote their action, except for the Wild cards which still bear the word &quot;Wild&quot;. Before the design change, such cards in English versions of the game had letters only. Earlier English versions can be recognized by the absence of the white rim that surrounds the edge of most Uno cards.

Other versions of the game use symbols and images in both old and new designs, especially ones with Wild cards that do not bear the word &quot;Wild&quot;. There are also language-free versions of the newer styles that do not bear the word &quot;Wild&quot; but have the same styling.

The 2010 &quot;Uno Mod&quot; edition uses symbols instead of letters or numbers.

On September 16, 2017, Mattel released Uno ColorAdd, which was designed specifically for those suffering from color blindness.

On October 1, 2019, Mattel released a Braille version of their game with Mark Riccobono, president of the National Federation of the Blind. Riccobono said in a press release, &quot;The fact that a blind person is now able to play a classic game of UNO straight out of the box with both blind and sighted friends or family members is a truly meaningful moment for our community.&quot;

===Uno H2O===
Uno H2O differs from the standard game in that the cards are transparent and waterproof. Play is identical to the standard pre-2018 Uno game, with the addition of two types of &quot;Wild Downpour&quot; cards. When one of these is played, all other players must draw either one or two cards as indicated on the card. The player using it may then declare the next color to be matched. Several of the other sets have been released in this format.

===&quot;Uno Fandom&quot; series===
In 2023, Mattel&#x27;s imprint Mattel Creations released a special collector&#x27;s series of Uno games based on fandom of fictional properties and sports teams. The initial group of sets in this series included those based on all 32 NFL teams and several fictional properties, including &quot;Star Trek&quot;, &quot;Harry Potter&quot;, &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;Monster High&quot;. Most are exclusive to the Mattel online store and can only be purchased directly from the store.

== Variations ==

Many variations from standard gameplay exist, such as Elimination Uno, Speed Uno and Pirate Uno.

On February 13, 2018, Mattel released a spin-off of Uno entitled &quot;Dos&quot;; the game is differentiated primarily by having a &quot;center row&quot; of discard piles, where pairs of cards that add up to the sum of a card on the top of one of the piles may be discarded.

The game can be played with two decks of standard playing cards, if the jokers are marked up as the zeroes of the four suits, and the royalty treated as the special cards.

==Spin-offs==

=== Slot machines ===
In 2002, International Gaming Technology introduced a &quot;pod concept&quot; for grouping the prize winnings of similarly-themed and newly-released MegaJackpot games into one collective pool. Among these was the new Famous Games pod, unveiling two new Mattel-licensed machines, UNO Slots and Magic 8 Ball slots. In the following two years, additional properties were tied into the pod, along with the Video Slot versions of both UNO and Magic 8 Ball.

The UNO slot machine featured a basic vertical 3 wheel system, along with 3 additional horizontal wheels that would activate when 3 UNO bonus symbols in any position were landed with the maximum bet wagered. Meanwhile, the UNO Video Slot Machine featured a 5 reel, 15 line Video system with additional UNO Attack and UNO Triple bonus games awarded based on the symbols landed. Both versions saw limited releases to various Native American gaming centers.

=== Uno: The Game Show ===
In March 2013, it was announced that Mattel and the Gurin Company were teaming up to create a game show based on the card game, produced as a half-hour daily strip with a $100,000 cash jackpot along with a primetime version in which contestants competed for 1 million dollars. However, the idea was scrapped later on.

=== Film adaptation ===
On February 4, 2021, an action heist comedy film based on the game was announced to be in development for Mattel Films with Lil Yachty of record label Quality Control Music developing and being eyed for the lead role alongside the label&#x27;s managers Kevin &quot;Coach K&quot; Lee and Pierre &quot;P&quot; Thomas, and Brian Sher for Quality Films producing, Marcy Kelly writing, and Robbie Brenner and Kevin McKeon leading the project as executive producer and supervising producer, respectively.

==Reception==
The &quot;Games&quot; magazine included &quot;Uno&quot; in their &quot;Top 100 Games of 1980&quot;, noting that the game &quot;borrows so much from the familiar card game of Crazy Eights&quot; but that &quot;it&#x27;s a much better game and just as simple to learn&quot;. They would later include the game in their &quot;Top 100 Games of 1982&quot;, noting that its &quot;popularity is based on its simplicity, not on its strategic aspects&quot; and that &quot;the game has a rummylike scoring system&quot;.

<text>Thomas Merton (January 31, 1915December 10, 1968), religious name M. Louis, was an American Trappist monk, writer, theologian, mystic, poet, social activist and scholar of comparative religion. He was a monk in the Trappist Abbey of Our Lady of Gethsemani, near Bardstown, Kentucky, living there from 1941 to his death.

Merton wrote more than 50 books in a period of 27 years, mostly on spirituality, social justice, and pacifism, as well as scores of essays and reviews. Among Merton&#x27;s most widely-read works is his bestselling autobiography &quot;The Seven Storey Mountain&quot; (1948). 

Merton became a keen proponent of interfaith understanding, exploring Eastern religions through study and practice. He pioneered dialogue with prominent Asian spiritual figures including the Dalai Lama, Japanese writer D. T. Suzuki, Thai Buddhist monk Buddhadasa, and Vietnamese monk Thich Nhat Hanh.

==Early life==
Thomas Merton was born in Prades, Pyrénées-Orientales, France, on January 31, 1915, to parents of Welsh origin: Owen Merton, a New Zealand painter active in Europe and the United States, and Ruth Jenkins Merton, an American Quaker and artist. They had met at a painting school in Paris. He was baptized in the Church of England, in accordance with his father&#x27;s wishes. Merton&#x27;s father was often absent during his son&#x27;s childhood.

During World War I, in August 1915, the Merton family left France for the United States. They lived first with Ruth&#x27;s parents in Queens, New York, and then settled near them in Douglaston. In 1917, the family moved into an old house in Flushing, Queens, where Merton&#x27;s brother, John Paul, was born on November 2, 1918. The family was considering returning to France when Ruth was diagnosed with stomach cancer. She died from it on October 21, 1921, in Bellevue Hospital. Merton was six years old and his brother not yet three.

In 1926, when Merton was eleven, his father enrolled him in a boys&#x27; boarding school in Montauban, the Lycée Ingres. In the summer of 1928, he withdrew Merton from Lycée Ingres, saying the family was moving to England.

==College==
In October 1933, Merton, age 18, entered Clare College, Cambridge, as an undergraduate to study French and Italian. He was unhappy at Clare College, preferring loafing over studying, and fathered a child that he never met, although he later signed at least two official court documents stating that he had &quot;no children&quot;.

In January 1935, Merton enrolled as a sophomore at Columbia University in New York City. There he established close and long-lasting friendships with the painter Ad Reinhardt, poet Robert Lax, commentator Ralph de Toledano, and the law student John Slate. He also befriended the publisher Robert Giroux.

Merton attended an 18th-century English literature course during the spring semester taught by Mark Van Doren, a professor with whom he maintained a lifetime friendship.
In January 1938, Merton graduated from Columbia with a B.A. in English. In June, his friend Seymour Freedgood arranged a meeting with Mahanambrata Brahmachari, a Hindu monk visiting New York from the University of Chicago. Merton was impressed by him. While Merton expected Brahmachari to recommend Hinduism, instead he advised Merton to reconnect with Christianity. He suggested Merton read the &quot;Confessions&quot; of Augustine and &quot;The Imitation of Christ&quot;. Merton read them both. In August 1938, he attended Mass at Corpus Christi Church, located near the Columbia campus. He began to read more extensively in Catholicism.

On November 16, 1938, Thomas Merton underwent the rite of baptism at Corpus Christi Church and received Holy Communion. On February 22, 1939, Merton received his M.A. in English from Columbia University. Merton decided he would pursue his PhD at Columbia and moved from Douglaston to Greenwich Village. He then discerned a call to religious life.

==Monastic life==

On December 10, 1941, Thomas Merton arrived at the Abbey of Gethsemani and spent three days at the monastery guest house, waiting for acceptance into the order. On December 13 he was accepted into the monastery as a postulant by Frederic Dunne, Gethsemani&#x27;s abbot since 1935, and given the religious name &quot;Mary Louis&quot;. Merton had a severe cold from his stay in the guest house, where he sat in front of an open window to prove his sincerity. During his initial weeks at Gethsemani, Merton studied the Trappist sign language and daily work and worship routine.

In March 1942, during the first Sunday of Lent, Merton was accepted as a novice at the convent. In June, he received a letter from his brother John Paul stating he was soon to leave for the war and would be coming to Gethsemani to visit before leaving. On July 17 John Paul arrived in Gethsemani. John Paul expressed his desire to become a Catholic, and by July 26 was baptized at a church in nearby New Haven, Kentucky, leaving the following day. This would be the last time the two saw each other. John Paul died on April 17, 1943, when his plane failed over the English Channel. A poem by Merton to John Paul appears in &quot;The Seven Storey Mountain&quot;.

===Writer===
Merton kept journals throughout his stay at Gethsemani. Initially, he felt writing to be at odds with his vocation, worried it would foster a tendency to individuality. But his superior, Dunne, tasked Merton beginning in 1943 to translate religious texts and write biographies of saints.

On March 19, 1944, Merton made his temporary vows and was given the black scapular and leather belt. In November 1944 a manuscript Merton had given to friend Robert Lax the previous year was published by James Laughlin at New Directions: a book of poetry titled &quot;Thirty Poems&quot;. In 1946 New Directions published another poetry collection by Merton, &quot;A Man in the Divided Sea&quot;, which, combined with &quot;Thirty Poems&quot;, attracted some recognition for him. The same year Merton&#x27;s manuscript for &quot;The Seven Storey Mountain&quot; was accepted by Harcourt Brace &amp; Company. &quot;The Seven Storey Mountain&quot;, Merton&#x27;s autobiography, was written during two-hour intervals in the monastery scriptorium as a personal project.

On March 19, 1947 he took his solemn vows, binding for life. He also began corresponding with a Carthusian at St. Hugh&#x27;s Charterhouse in England. Merton had harbored an appreciation for the Carthusian order since coming to Gethsemani in 1941, and would later come to consider leaving the Cistercians for that order.

In 1948 &quot;The Seven Storey Mountain&quot; was published to critical acclaim, with fan mail to Merton reaching new heights. Merton also published several works for the monastery that year, which were: &quot;Guide to Cistercian Life&quot;, &quot;Cistercian Contemplatives&quot;, &quot;Figures for an Apocalypse&quot;, and &quot;The Spirit of Simplicity&quot;. That year Saint Mary&#x27;s College (Indiana) also published a booklet by Merton, &quot;What Is Contemplation?&quot; Merton published as well that year a biography, &quot;Exile Ends in Glory: The Life of a Trappistine, Mother M. Berchmans, O.C.S.O&quot;. Merton&#x27;s abbot, Dunne, died on August 3, 1948, while riding on a train to Georgia. Dunne&#x27;s passing was painful for Merton, who had come to look on the abbot as a father figure and spiritual mentor. On August 15 the monastic community elected Dom James Fox, a former US Navy officer, as their new abbot. In October Merton discussed with him his ongoing attraction to the Carthusian and Camaldolese orders and their eremitical way of life, to which Fox responded by assuring Merton that he belonged at Gethsemani. Fox permitted Merton to continue his writing, Merton now having gained substantial recognition outside the monastery. On December 21 Merton was ordained as a subdeacon. From 1948 on, Merton identified himself as an anarchist.

On January 5, 1949, Merton took a train to Louisville and applied for American citizenship. Published that year were &quot;Seeds of Contemplation&quot;, &quot;The Tears of Blind Lions&quot;, &quot;The Waters of Siloe&quot;, and the British edition of &quot;The Seven Storey Mountain&quot; under the title &quot;Elected Silence&quot;. On March 19, Merton became a deacon in the order, and on May 26 (Ascension Thursday) he was ordained a priest, saying his first Mass the following day. In June, the monastery celebrated its centenary, for which Merton authored the book &quot;Gethsemani Magnificat&quot; in commemoration. In November, Merton started teaching mystical theology to novices at Gethsemani, a duty he greatly enjoyed. By this time Merton was a huge success outside the monastery, &quot;The Seven Storey Mountain&quot; having sold over 150,000 copies. It is on &quot;National Review&quot;s list of the 100 best nonfiction books of the twentieth century.

In this particularly prolific period of his life, Merton is believed to have been suffering from loneliness and stress. One incident indicative of this is his drive with the monastery&#x27;s jeep, acting in a possibly manic state, during which he almost caused a head-on collision.

In 1953 he published a journal of monastery life titled &quot;The Sign of Jonas&quot;. Merton became well known for his dialogues with other faiths and his non-violent stand during the race riots and Vietnam War of the 1960s. By this time, he had adopted a broadly human viewpoint, concerned about issues like peace, racial tolerance, and social equality. In a letter to Nicaraguan liberation theologian Ernesto Cardenal (who had entered Gethsemani but left in 1959 to study theology in Mexico), Merton wrote: &quot;The world is full of great criminals with enormous power, and they are in a death struggle with each other. It is a huge gang battle, using well-meaning lawyers and policemen and clergymen as their front, controlling papers, means of communication, and enrolling everybody in their armies.&quot; He developed a personal radicalism which was political but not overtly sympathetic to Marxism, even though his Cisterican critic Louis Lekai identified Merton&#x27;s &quot;adherence to Marxian slogans.&quot; Merton was above all devoted to non-violence. He regarded his viewpoint as based on &quot;simplicity&quot; and expressed it as a Christian sensibility. His &quot;New Seeds of Contemplation&quot; was published in 1961.

Merton finally achieved the solitude he had long desired while living in a hermitage on the monastery grounds in 1965. Over the years he had occasional battles with some of his abbots about not being allowed out of the monastery despite his international reputation and voluminous correspondence with many well-known figures of the day.

At the end of 1968, the new abbot, Flavian Burns, allowed him the freedom to undertake a tour of Asia, during which he met the Dalai Lama in India on three occasions, and also the Tibetan Buddhist Dzogchen master Chatral Rinpoche, followed by a solitary retreat near Darjeeling, India. In Darjeeling, he befriended Tsewang Yishey Pemba, a prominent member of the Tibetan community. Then, in what was to be his final letter, he noted, &quot;In my contacts with these new friends, I also feel a consolation in my own faith in Christ and in his dwelling presence. I hope and believe he may be present in the hearts of all of us.&quot;

Merton&#x27;s role as a writer is explored in novelist Mary Gordon&#x27;s &quot;On Merton&quot; (2019).

==Personal life ==

According to &quot;The Seven Storey Mountain&quot;, the youthful Merton loved jazz, but by the time he began his first teaching job he had forsaken all but peaceful music. Later in life, whenever he was permitted to leave Gethsemani for medical or monastic reasons, he would catch what live jazz he could, mainly in Louisville or New York.

In April 1966, Merton underwent surgery to treat debilitating back pain. While recuperating in a Louisville hospital, he fell in love with Margie Smith, a student nurse assigned to his care. (He referred to her in his diary as &quot;M.&quot;) He wrote poems to her and reflected on the relationship in &quot;A Midsummer Diary for M.&quot; Merton struggled to maintain his vows while being deeply in love. It is not known if he ever consummated the relationship.

==Death==
On December 10, 1968, Merton was at a Red Cross retreat facility named () in Samut Prakan, a province near Bangkok, Thailand, attending a monastic conference. After giving a talk at the morning session, he was found dead later in the afternoon in the room of his cottage, wearing only shorts, lying on his back with a short-circuited Hitachi floor fan lying across his body. His associate, Jean Leclercq, stated: &quot;In all probability the death of Thomas Merton was due in part to heart failure, in part to an electric shock.&quot; Since there was no autopsy, there was no suitable explanation for the wound in the back of Merton&#x27;s head, &quot;which had bled considerably.&quot; Arriving from the cottage next to Merton&#x27;s, the Primate of the Benedictine order and presiding officer of the conference, Rembert Weakland, anointed Merton.

His body was flown back to the United States on board a US military aircraft returning from Vietnam. He is buried at the Gethsemani Abbey.

In 2018, Hugh Turley and David Martin published &quot;The Martyrdom of Thomas Merton: An Investigation&quot;, presenting the evidentiary record&#x27;s refutation of claims of accidental electrocution, and suggesting Merton was assassinated for his political opposition to the Vietnam War. A subsequent book by Turley, &quot;Thomas Merton&#x27;s Betrayers: The Case Against Abbot James Fox and Author John Howard Griffin&quot;, presents documentary evidence of manipulation and coverup by the Catholic Church and Merton&#x27;s political foes.

The Spring 2024 issue of &quot;The Catholic Historical Review&quot; published &quot;The Official Thai Reports on Thomas Merton&#x27;s Death&quot;. The official cause of death was a natural cause, &quot;sudden heart failure&quot; and not &quot;accidental electrocution.&quot; The police report states that Merton was already dead before he came into contact with a faulty fan that was found lying across his body.

==Spirituality beyond Catholicism==
===Eastern religions===
Merton was first exposed to and became interested in Eastern religions when he read Aldous Huxley&#x27;s &quot;Ends and Means&quot; in 1937, the year before his conversion to Catholicism. Throughout his life, he studied Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, Hinduism, Sikhism, Jainism, and Sufism in addition to his academic and monastic studies.

While Merton was not interested in what these traditions had to offer as doctrines and institutions, he was deeply interested in what each said of the depth of human experience. He believed that for the most part, Christianity had forsaken its mystical tradition in favor of Cartesian emphasis on &quot;the reification of concepts, idolization of the reflexive consciousness, flight from being into verbalism, mathematics, and rationalization.&quot;

Merton was perhaps most interested in—and, of all of the Eastern traditions, wrote the most about—Zen. Having studied the Desert Fathers and other Christian mystics as part of his monastic vocation, Merton had a deep understanding of what it was those men sought and experienced in their seeking. He found many parallels between the language of these Christian mystics and the language of Zen philosophy.

In 1959, Merton began a dialogue with D. T. Suzuki which was published nearly ten years later in Merton&#x27;s &quot;Zen and the Birds of Appetite&quot; as &quot;Wisdom in Emptiness&quot;. Merton wrote then that &quot;any attempt to handle Zen in theological language is bound to miss the point,&quot; calling his final statements &quot;an example of how not to approach Zen.&quot; Merton struggled to reconcile the Western and Christian impulse to catalog and put into words with the ideas of Christian apophatic theology and the unspeakable nature of the Zen experience. Zhong Fushi mentions having met Merton, who allegedly said to him “Zen, is a way of perceiving the substantial reality of all things—their goodness, their beauty, and their oneness (ichinyo). Zhong interpreted this as Merton aligning Zen Buddhism with an enlightment of the Aristotelean-Thomistic transcendentals common to everything that has or is or will exist.

In keeping with his idea that non-Christian faiths had much to offer Christianity in experience and perspective and little or nothing in terms of doctrine, Merton distinguished between Zen Buddhism, an expression of history and culture, and Zen. By Zen, Merton meant something not bound by culture, religion or belief. Merton was influenced by Aelred Graham&#x27;s book &quot;Zen Catholicism&quot; of 1963.

===American Indian spirituality===
Merton also explored American Indian spirituality. He wrote a series of articles on American Indian history and spirituality for &quot;The Catholic Worker&quot;, &quot;The Center Magazine&quot;, &quot;Theoria to Theory&quot;, and &quot;Unicorn Journal&quot;. He explored themes such as American Indian fasting and missionary work.

==Legacy==

Merton&#x27;s influence has grown since his death, and he is widely recognized as an important 20th-century Catholic mystic and thinker. Interest in his work contributed to a rise in spiritual exploration beginning in the 1960s and 1970s in the United States. Merton&#x27;s letters and diaries reveal the intensity with which their author focused on social justice issues, including the civil rights movement and proliferation of nuclear arms. He had prohibited their publication for 25 years after his death. Publication raised new interest in Merton&#x27;s life.

The Abbey of Gethsemani benefits from the royalties of Merton&#x27;s writing. In addition, his writings attracted much interest in Catholic practice and thought, and in the Trappist vocation.

In recognition of Merton&#x27;s close association with Bellarmine University, the university established an official repository for Merton&#x27;s archives at the Thomas Merton Center on the Bellarmine campus in Louisville, Kentucky.

The Thomas Merton Award, a peace prize, has been awarded since 1972 by the Thomas Merton Center for Peace and Social Justice in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

The 2015, in tribute to the centennial year of Merton&#x27;s birth, The Festival of Faiths in Louisville Kentucky honored his life and work with &quot;Sacred Journey’s the Legacy of Thomas Merton&quot;.

An annual lecture in his name is given at his alma mater, Columbia University in which the Columbia chaplaincy invites a prominent Catholic to speak.

The campus ministry building at St. Bonaventure University, the school where Merton taught English briefly between graduating from Columbia University with his M.A. in English and entering the Trappist order, is named after him. St. Bonaventure University also holds an important repository of Merton materials worldwide.

Bishop Marrocco/Thomas Merton Catholic Secondary School in downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada, which was formerly named St. Joseph&#x27;s Commercial and was founded by the Sisters of St. Joseph, is named in part after him.

Some of Merton&#x27;s manuscripts that include correspondence with his superiors are located in the library of the Monastery of the Holy Spirit in Conyers, Georgia. Antony Theodore has provided details of his encounters with Asian spiritual leaders and the influence of Confucianism, Taoism, Zen Buddhism and Hinduism on Merton&#x27;s mysticism and philosophy of contemplation.

Merton was one of four Americans mentioned by Pope Francis in his speech to a joint meeting of the United States Congress on September 24, 2015. Francis said, &quot;Merton was above all a man of prayer, a thinker who challenged the certitudes of his time and opened new horizons for souls and for the Church. He was also a man of dialogue, a promoter of peace between peoples and religions.&quot;

In 2023, Columbia University opened the Thomas Merton Institute for Catholic Life at the Church of Notre Dame.

==In popular culture==
Merton&#x27;s life was the subject of &quot;The Glory of the World&quot;, a play by Charles L. Mee. Roy Cockrum, a former monk who won the Powerball lottery in 2014, helped finance the production of the play in New York. Prior to New York the play was being shown in Louisville, Kentucky.

In the 2017 movie &quot;First Reformed&quot;, written and directed by Paul Schrader, Ethan Hawke&#x27;s character (a middle-aged Protestant minister) is influenced by Merton&#x27;s work.

Thomas Merton is portrayed briefly by Adam Kilgour as a character in the 1994 movie &quot;Quiz Show&quot;.

Starting in the early 1990s The Thomas Merton Society of Great Britain &amp; Ireland explores the life &amp; writings of Thomas Merton and his shaping on the modern world, with conferences, retreats and the publication of the Merton Journal.

<text>Culture Club are an English new wave band formed in London in 1981. The band comprises Boy George (lead vocals), Roy Hay (guitar and keyboards), and Mikey Craig (bass guitar), and formerly included Jon Moss (drums and percussion). Emerging in the New Romantic scene, they are considered one of the most representative and influential groups of the 1980s.

Led by singer and frontman Boy George, whose androgynous style of dressing caught the attention of the public and the media in the early 1980s, the band have sold more than 150 million records, including over six million BPI certified records sold in the UK and over seven million RIAA certified records sold in the US. Their hits include &quot;Do You Really Want to Hurt Me&quot;, &quot;Time (Clock of the Heart)&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ll Tumble 4 Ya&quot;, &quot;Church of the Poison Mind&quot;, &quot;Karma Chameleon&quot;, &quot;Victims&quot;, &quot;Miss Me Blind&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s a Miracle&quot;, &quot;The War Song&quot;, &quot;Move Away&quot;, and &quot;I Just Wanna Be Loved&quot;. In the UK they amassed twelve top 40 hit singles between 1982 and 1999, including the number ones &quot;Do You Really Want to Hurt Me&quot; and &quot;Karma Chameleon&quot;, the latter being the biggest selling single of 1983 in the UK, and hit number one on the US Hot 100 in 1984. The song &quot;Time (Clock of the Heart)&quot; is included on the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s list of 500 songs that shaped rock and roll.

Their second album, &quot;Colour by Numbers&quot;, sold more than 10 million copies worldwide. It appeared on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 100 Best Albums of the 1980s and is also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. Ten of their singles reached the US top 40, where they are associated with the Second British Invasion of British &quot;new music&quot; groups that became popular in the US due to the cable music channel MTV. Culture Club&#x27;s music has been described as combining new wave and American soul and pop. It also includes some elements of Jamaican reggae and other styles such as calypso, salsa, and, with &quot;Karma Chameleon&quot;, elements of country music.

In 1984, Culture Club won Brit Awards for Best British Group, Best British Single (&quot;Karma Chameleon&quot;), and the Grammy Award for Best New Artist. They were nominated the same year for the Grammy Award for Pop Vocal by Group or Duo. The band were also nominated for a Canadian Juno Award for International Album of the Year. In January 1985, Culture Club were nominated for an American Music Award for Favorite Pop/Rock Band/Duo/Group Video Artist, and in September 1985, they were nominated for two MTV Video Music Awards for Best Special Effects and Best Art Direction for their video &quot;It&#x27;s a Miracle&quot;. In 1987, they received another nomination for an American Music Award for Favorite Pop/Rock Band/Duo/Group Video Artist.

== History ==
=== 1981–1983: Formation and &quot;Kissing to Be Clever&quot; ===
In 1981, Blitz Club regular Boy George occasionally sang with the group Bow Wow Wow, performing under the stage name Lieutenant Lush with the group. After his tenure with that group ended, bassist Mikey Craig started Culture Club, inviting George to be the vocalist. Subsequently, drummer Jon Moss (formerly of the Damned and Adam and the Ants) and guitarist Roy Hay joined the new group. They originally called themselves Sex Gang Children, which would quickly be abandoned and adopted by another band. 

Realizing they had an Irish gay man as the lead singer, a black Briton on bass, a blond Englishman on guitar and keyboards, and a Jewish drummer, they came up with the name Culture Club. The group recorded demos, which were paid for by EMI Records, but the label was unimpressed and decided not to sign the group. Virgin Records heard the demos and signed the group in the UK, releasing their albums in Europe, while Epic Records released their albums in the United States and much of the rest of the world.

The band released two singles in May and June 1982, &quot;White Boy&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Afraid of Me&quot;, though both failed to chart. In September of that year, the group released their third single, &quot;Do You Really Want to Hurt Me&quot;, a reggae-influenced number, which became one of their biggest hits. The song went to No. 1 in the UK in late 1982 and became an international smash, topping the charts in twenty-three countries (No. 2 in the US), and the top ten in several more countries.

The band&#x27;s 1982 debut on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; created tabloid headlines, which focused on George&#x27;s androgynous style of dress and sexual ambiguity. Magazines began to feature George prominently on their covers. Pete Burns, lead singer of the pop band Dead or Alive, would later claim he was the first to wear braids, big hats, and colourful costumes, but George would cut back with a sharp-tongued remark, &quot;It&#x27;s not who did it first, it&#x27;s who did it better.&quot;

The band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Kissing to Be Clever&quot; (UK No. 5, US No. 14) was released in October 1982, and the follow-up single, &quot;Time (Clock of the Heart)&quot;, became another Top 10 hit in the US (Number 2) and UK (Number 3). &quot;I&#x27;ll Tumble 4 Ya&quot; also became a Top Ten hit in the US (Number 9) and in Canada. This gave Culture Club the distinction of being the first group since The Beatles to have three Top Ten hits in America from a debut album. &quot;Kissing to Be Clever&quot; was certified platinum in US for 1 million shipped copies.

=== 1983–1984: &quot;Colour by Numbers&quot; ===

The band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Colour by Numbers&quot; (UK No. 1, US No. 2), was released in 1983. The first single, &quot;Church of the Poison Mind&quot;, featuring backing vocalist Helen Terry, reached the UK and US Top 10. The second single, &quot;Karma Chameleon&quot;, gave the band their biggest hit, hitting No. 1 in the UK (the band&#x27;s second chart-topper there), where it became the best-selling single of 1983 and has sold 1.5 million copies there to date. It also peaked at No. 1 in the US for three consecutive weeks, and would ultimately hit No. 1 in 30 countries, thus becoming one of the top twenty best-selling singles of the 1980s sold seven million copies worldwide, with one of the most iconic images of Boy George on the cover shot by photographer David Levine.

The album &quot;Colour by Numbers&quot; would spawn more hits including &quot;Miss Me Blind&quot; (#5 US), &quot;It&#x27;s a Miracle&quot; (#4 UK, No. 13 US), and &quot;Victims&quot; (#3 UK), and sold four million copies in the US and another five million worldwide at its time of release. The album gave Culture Club the distinction of being the first group in music history to have an album certified diamond in Canada (for sales of one million copies in that country). The band also won the 1984 Brit Award for Best Group and the Grammy Award for Best New Artist, where George gave a speech via satellite stating, &quot;Thank you, America. You&#x27;ve got taste, style, and you know a good drag queen when you see one.&quot;

The group&#x27;s back-up singer, Helen Terry, began work on her solo album, for which George and Hay wrote the song &quot;Love Lies Lost&quot;. The pair also wrote &quot;Passing Friend&quot; for the Beach Boys&#x27; album. Culture Club wrote two songs for the soundtrack to the movie &quot;Electric Dreams&quot;. George and Hay wrote &quot;The Dream&quot; and &quot;Love Is Love&quot;, with the latter being released as a single in Canada, Japan and South America, the E.P &quot;Love is Love&quot; became a major hit in Brazil. George also collaborated on the song &quot;Electric Dreams&quot;, sung by P. P. Arnold. The song was written with Phil Pickett (former member of the 1970s band Sailor) who had also co-written &quot;Karma Chameleon&quot; and frequently played keyboards for the group.

Despite Culture Club&#x27;s commercial success, there were significant pressures within the band. George was using drugs with money from his new-found fame. George and Moss were also romantically involved with each other, which was unknown to the public and the media at the time. Their relationship lasted for over four years and was often turbulent, with alleged physical and verbal abuse from both sides. Their constant arguments and the pressure to hide the relationship from the public started to take its toll on the band.

=== 1984–1986: &quot;Waking Up with the House on Fire&quot;, &quot;From Luxury to Heartache&quot; and decline ===
In 1984, the group released their third album &quot;Waking Up with the House on Fire&quot; (UK No. 2, US No. 26). Although certified platinum in both the UK and the US, it was a commercial and critical disappointment compared to their first two albums. The album contained the hit single &quot;The War Song&quot;, which reached No. 2 in the UK, and Top 20 in the US. Other singles like &quot;Mistake No. 3&quot; (US No. 33) and &quot;The Medal Song&quot; (UK No. 32) would become modest hits. George later stated he felt the album experienced a lukewarm reception because of half-hearted material he felt they released due to pressure from Virgin and Epic. According to him, the band had just come off an exhausting world tour in 1984.
At the end of 1984, Boy George was recruited by Bob Geldof to join the Band Aid recording, consisting of mostly internationally known UK and Irish recording stars. George was in New York City for an appearance on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; when Geldof called him, but managed to catch the final Concorde of the day to London and was the last singer to record a lead vocal track for the song &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot;. The song would become the biggest selling single of all-time in the UK and a huge international hit, raising millions for famine victims in several African nations, particularly Ethiopia.

Due to the break-up of his relationship with Moss, and all the ensuing tension with the rest of the band, George turned to relief in drugs. Consequently, he soon developed a self-destructive drug addiction, which in merely four months escalated from marijuana to heroin. By 1986, George had become seriously addicted. The recording of their fourth studio album, 1986&#x27;s &quot;From Luxury to Heartache&quot; (UK No. 10, US No. 32) dragged on for so long that producer Arif Mardin had to abandon the sessions due to prior commitments and leave it to engineer Lew Hahn to finish the sessions. Nevertheless, the first single &quot;Move Away&quot; became a hit, peaking at UK No. 7 and US No. 12 and appeared the album would return the group back to its previous success. But by the time of the release of the second single &quot;God Thank You Woman&quot;, news of George&#x27;s drug addiction began to circulate in British and American tabloids, and the second single stalled on its way up the charts, failing to make a big impact.

George and Moss also no longer wanted to be around each other due to the constant relationship battles and with George&#x27;s addiction. &quot;From Luxury to Heartache&quot; began to fade from the charts as well, and the album ultimately sold fewer than one million copies worldwide at the time of release. By the summer of 1986, George finally admitted that he was indeed addicted to drugs. In July of that year, he was arrested by the British police for possession of heroin. The band broke up and George pursued a solo career, having several European hits and a couple of US Top 40 hits.

=== Reunions ===
==== 1989 ====
The band first tried to reunite in 1989, after many requests from Tony Gordon, the group&#x27;s former manager and George&#x27;s manager at that time. George agreed to try some songs with the band again, resulting in recording sessions and producing more than a dozen songs that remain unreleased. George, however, was more excited about his future projects like his record label, More Protein, and his new acid house project Jesus Loves You. The proposed reunion ended up being cancelled.

==== 1998–2000, 2002 ====
In 1998, George and Moss put their differences aside and the band reunited to do a reunion tour, kicking off with a performance on &quot;VH1 Storytellers&quot;. George said about the reunion, &quot;Culture Club&#x27;s reunion couldn&#x27;t have come at a better time for rock&quot;, adding that, &quot;It&#x27;s a nostalgia trip, there&#x27;s no way of avoiding that.&quot; The tour was a major success. &quot;Greatest Moments&quot;, a compilation album based around the &quot;Storytellers&quot; performance, was released, and went platinum in UK. It included new songs such as &quot;I Just Wanna Be Loved&quot;, which hit UK No. 4. However, their new-found success was short-lived and their fifth studio album, &quot;Don&#x27;t Mind If I Do&quot;, released in 1999, peaked at No. 64 in the UK. It included minor UK hits in &quot;Your Kisses Are Charity&quot; (UK No. 25) and &quot;Cold Shoulder&quot; (UK No. 43).

The band went on to tour, then reunited again for a 20th anniversary concert in 2002 at the Royal Albert Hall in London. This performance was released on DVD the following year. Culture Club then became inactive again, largely due to George&#x27;s successful DJ career, as well as his semi-autobiographical musical &quot;Taboo&quot;. It was a success in London, but was a flop on Broadway, only running for 100 performances, as well as losing $10 million for its producer, Rosie O&#x27;Donnell.

==== 2006 ====
In 2006, original members Craig and Moss tried to launch a new tour with another lead singer, as George and Hay had declined to tour. Early that year, the band&#x27;s record company placed an ad for a lead singer to &quot;...take part in a 2007 World Tour and TV Series.&quot; The new singer, Sam Butcher was selected because of his own personality, &quot;not a Boy George lookalike.&quot; After watching a video on MySpace, George described the singer who replaced him as &quot;terrible&quot; and &quot;dreadful&quot;. George said: &quot;I wanted to like it but I couldn&#x27;t. They&#x27;re my songs, they&#x27;re my heart, they&#x27;re my life.&quot; A proposed tour for December 2006 in the UK did not take place.

==== 2011 ====
In late 2011, George was part of a three-man Culture Club band that performed two live concerts, in Dubai and Sydney, the latter being a New Year&#x27;s Eve concert, although Moss did not appear due to a back injury. However, the band weren&#x27;t able to tour in the US, due to George being denied a visa 3 years prior.

==== 2014–present ====
In 2014, the band reformed and announced a tour and a new album. A new picture of the four members was also posted on the band&#x27;s official website, along with the list of the 11 UK concert dates.

The band travelled to Spain for a two-week recording session. 18 new tracks were completed for a new album produced by Youth. The new album, entitled &quot;Tribes&quot;, was scheduled for release in early 2015 on the band&#x27;s own label Different Man Music (via Kobalt Label Services). At the end of that year, the album had still not materialised.

On 19 July 2014, the band were among the line-up for a two-hour concert in Edinburgh Castle, ahead of the opening ceremony of the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. Hay did not perform with the band because he was in recovery after having knee surgery. The band played two songs, &quot;Do You Really Want to Hurt Me&quot; and &quot;Karma Chameleon&quot; which were shown on BBC TV.

In mid-November 2014, two days before the start of their 21-date US and UK tour, Culture Club announced they had to cancel the tour due to George suffering from a serious throat condition. The cancelled tour would have represented the full original line-up&#x27;s first tour in 12 years. The North American tour was eventually rescheduled and started on 17 July 2015 in Canada. A television documentary, &quot;Boy George and Culture Club: Karma to Calamity&quot;, aired on BBC Four on 6 March 2015. The programme documented the band&#x27;s reunion in 2014 and the making of their new album in Spain, up to the announcement to cancel the tour. Based on the popularity of 2015&#x27;s mini-tour, Culture Club embarked on a 60 city world tour in 2016. The major success of this tour culminated in a DVD/CD/Blu-ray release, &quot;Live at Wembley: World Tour 2016&quot;.

In August 2016, the band announced that the album &quot;Tribes&quot; was permanently shelved, and offered refunds to all those who had pre-ordered the album online.

In 2018, Culture Club toured the US and Europe from June to December. Dubbed &quot;The Life Tour&quot;, the band toured in support of their namesake album, along with supporting acts the B-52s, Tom Bailey (formerly of the Thompson Twins) and Belinda Carlisle (Europe dates only). Jon Moss was originally part of the line-up, but did not participate in the European leg of the tour. A spokeswoman for Boy George confirmed: &quot;Jon&#x27;s taking a break from Culture Club but the door is open in the future.&quot; In December 2019, Moss filed a writ at London&#x27;s High Court naming the band trio as defendants. Moss&#x27; lawyers say he was told to &quot;take a break&quot; by manager Paul Kemsley, demanding nearly £200,000 in missing payments and a share of profits. Moss officially left Culture Club in May 2021.

Culture Club returned to the SSE Arena in Wembley on 19 December 2020 for a livestream concert broadcast around the world, in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Titled &#x27;Rainbow in the Dark&#x27;, the concert saw the band play their classic hits, new material, including a new ballad version of &quot;Karma Chameleon&quot; featuring Mila, and covers of T. Rex&#x27;s &quot;Get It On (Bang a Gong)&quot; and George&#x27;s solo cover of Bread&#x27;s &quot;Everything I Own&quot;.

Culture Club toured in 2022 with a residency in Las Vegas and select amphitheaters across the United States. They also served as an opening act for Rod Stewart on his &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; tour in the UK in June and July 2023, and in addition to continuing their Las Vegas residency that February, Culture Club embarked on a U.S. summer tour titled &quot;The Letting It Go Show&quot;, with Howard Jones and Berlin serving as opening acts.

== Musical style and development ==
Culture Club are primarily a pop group, belonging to the British new pop and New Romantic movements of the early 1980s. They have also been described as new wave, combining it with American soul with Jamaican reggae and other styles such as calypso, salsa, and country.

&quot;Philadelphia Daily News&quot; described Culture Club as a hot new rock act, while William K Knoedelseder Jr from &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said about the group, &quot;Boy George of Culture Club, a rock group MTV helped make popular&quot;, adding that, &quot;There&#x27;s some debate in the record industry about MTV&#x27;s ability to directly increase record sales across the board but there&#x27;s no doubt that the channel has been responsible for exposing such rock artists as Def Leppard, Duran Duran and Men at Work to a national audience...&quot;

In the 1980s, Boy George said about the music style of his band Culture Club, &quot;We play rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll and I love rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll music but I don&#x27;t like the lifestyle. I don&#x27;t like people tipping beer over their heads... I just hate rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll in that way. It&#x27;s disgusting and boring. I look at what we&#x27;re doing as very intelligent.&quot;

Stephen Holden, music critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, said in his article &quot;Rock: British Culture Club&quot;, that &quot;Culture Club blends soul, rock, funk, reggae and salsa into a music that programmatically reconciles white, black and Latin styles&quot;, adding that, &quot;Mr. O&#x27;Dowd made the group&#x27;s best songs – the Motown-flavoured &#x27;Do You Really Want to Hurt Me&#x27; and the Latin-inflected dance tune &#x27;I&#x27;ll Tumble 4 Ya&#x27; – shine like jewels.&quot;

Star-News considered Culture Club as a &#x27;new rock&#x27; band of the 1980s; the newspaper said &quot;Now you see the more rhythm-oriented, &#x27;new rock of the 80s,&#x27; like Culture Club and the Eurythmics, fitting in more easily with urban contemporary formats.&quot;

Stephen Thomas Erlewine, senior editor for AllMusic, described specifically Culture Club as a new wave band and generically as the most successful pop/rock group in America and England during the 1980s, adding that, &quot;By 1986, the group had broken up, leaving behind several singles that rank as classics of the new wave era.&quot;

The music of Culture Club is described by George as, &quot;The aim is to be creatively fluid to make everything we do a little different. We want to be a bridge between white rock and black soul&quot;, adding that, &quot;I want Culture Club to represent all peoples and minorities&quot;.

The band were part of the Second British Invasion of the 1980s in the United States, as R. Serge Denisoff and William L. Schurk said in their book &quot;Tarnished Gold: The Record Industry Revisited&quot;, &quot;Here comes the rock and roll of 1984. The invaders were a mixed bunch led by Culture Club, whose sound has been described as &#x27;recycled Smokey Robinson&#x27; or &#x27;torchy American schmaltz and classic Motown&#x27;&quot;, adding that, &quot;Boy George&#x27;s drag-queen appearance made the group a natural for the visual demands of cable television&quot;.

In her book &quot;Magazines for Children: A Guide for Parents, Teachers, and Librarians&quot;, author Selma K. Richardson said that Culture Club&#x27;s music is soft rock that contains &quot;enough soul and new wave elements to cover almost all audiences.&quot;

<doc id="154310" wikidata="Q450529" url="?curid=154310" title="Frank Costello">
<text>Frank Costello (; born Francesco Castiglia ; January 26, 1891 – February 18, 1973) was an Italian-American crime boss of the Luciano crime family.

Born in Italy, he moved with his family to the United States as a child. As a youth he joined New York City gangs. Working with Charlie &quot;Lucky&quot; Luciano, Costello was involved in bootlegging operations during Prohibition. In 1929 they joined the National Crime Syndicate. From 1937, Costello was acting boss of the Luciano crime family. In the 1950s, he spent several years in prison for tax evasion. Costello retired in 1957 after he had survived an assassination attempt ordered by Vito Genovese.

== Early life ==
Costello was born Francesco Castiglia on January 26, 1891, in Lauropoli, a &quot;frazione&quot; of the town of Cassano allo Ionio in the province of Cosenza in the Calabria region, Italy. In 1895, he boarded a ship to the United States with his mother and his brother Edward to join their father, who had moved to New York City&#x27;s East Harlem several years earlier and opened a small neighborhood Italian grocery store.

While Costello was still a boy, his brother introduced him to gang activities. At 13, he had become a member of a local gang and started using the name Frankie. Costello committed petty crimes and went to jail for assault and robbery in 1908, 1912, and 1917. In 1918, he married Lauretta Geigerman, a Jewish woman who was the sister of a close friend. That same year, Costello served ten months in jail for carrying a concealed weapon.

== Criminal career ==
=== Alliance with Luciano ===

While working for the Morello gang, Costello met Charlie &quot;Lucky&quot; Luciano, the Sicilian leader of Manhattan&#x27;s Lower East Side gang. The two Italians immediately became friends and partners. Several older members of Luciano&#x27;s mob family disapproved of this growing partnership. They were mostly old-school &quot;mafiosi&quot; who were unwilling to work with anyone who was not Italian, and skeptical at best about working with non-Sicilians. To Luciano&#x27;s shock, they warned him against working with Costello, whom they called &quot;the dirty Calabrian.&quot;

Along with Italian American associates Vito Genovese and Tommy &quot;Three-Finger Brown&quot; Lucchese, and Jewish associates Meyer Lansky and Benjamin &quot;Bugsy&quot; Siegel, the gang became involved in robbery, theft, extortion, gambling and narcotics. The Luciano-Costello-Lansky-Siegel alliance prospered even further with the passage of Prohibition in 1920. The gang went into bootlegging, backed by criminal financier Arnold &quot;the Brain&quot; Rothstein.

The young Italians&#x27; success let them make business deals with the leading Jewish and Irish criminals of the era, including Dutch Schultz, Owney &quot;the Killer&quot; Madden and William &quot;Big Bill&quot; Dwyer. Rothstein became a mentor to Costello, Luciano, Lansky and Siegel while they conducted bootlegging business with Bronx beer baron Schultz. In 1922, Costello, Luciano, and their closest Italian associates joined the Sicilian crime family led by Joe &quot;the Boss&quot; Masseria, a top Italian underworld crime boss. By 1924, Costello had become a close associate of Hell&#x27;s Kitchen&#x27;s Irish crime bosses Dwyer and Madden. He became involved in their rum-running operations, known as &quot;The Combine&quot;; this might have prompted him to change his last name to the Irish &quot;Costello.&quot;

In 1925, Costello became a U.S. citizen.

On November 19, 1926, Costello and Dwyer were indicted on federal bootlegging charges. They were accused of bribing two U.S. Coast Guardsmen, presumably so that they would not disturb the unloading of liquor from boats in New York Harbor. The largest boat in the Combine fleet could carry 20,000 cases of liquor. In January 1927, the jury deadlocked on the bootlegging charges for Dwyer and Costello.

In 1926, Dwyer was convicted of bribing a Coast Guard official and sentenced to two years in jail. After Dwyer was imprisoned, Costello and Madden took over the Combine&#x27;s operations. This caused friction between Madden and a top Dwyer lieutenant, Charles &quot;Vannie&quot; Higgins, who believed he should have been running the Combine instead of Costello. Thus, the &quot;Manhattan Beer Wars&quot; began between Higgins on one side, and Costello, Madden, and Schultz on the other. At this time, Schultz was also having problems with gangsters Jack &quot;Legs&quot; Diamond and Vincent &quot;Mad Dog&quot; Coll, who had begun to rival Schultz and his partners with Higgins&#x27;s help. Eventually, the Costello-Madden-Schultz alliance was destroyed by New York&#x27;s underworld.

In the late 1920s, Johnny Torrio helped to organize a loose cartel of East Coast bootleggers, the Big Seven, in which a number of prominent gangsters, including Costello, Luciano, Longy Zwillman, Joe Adonis, and Meyer Lansky played a part. Torrio also supported creation of a national body that would prevent the sort of all-out turf wars between gangs that had broken out in Chicago and New York. His idea was well received, and a conference was hosted in Atlantic City by Torrio, Lansky, Luciano and Costello in May 1929; the National Crime Syndicate was created.

=== Castellammarese War ===
In early 1931, the Castellammarese War broke out between Masseria and Salvatore Maranzano. In a secret deal with Maranzano, Luciano agreed to engineer the death of his boss, Masseria, in return for receiving Masseria&#x27;s rackets and becoming Maranzano&#x27;s second-in-command. On April 15, 1931, Luciano had lured Masseria to a meeting where he was murdered at a restaurant called Nuova Villa Tammaro on Coney Island. While they played cards, Luciano allegedly excused himself to the bathroom, with the gunmen reportedly being Genovese, Albert Anastasia, Joe Adonis, and Benjamin &quot;Bugsy&quot; Siegel; Ciro &quot;The Artichoke King&quot; Terranova drove the getaway car, but legend has it that he was too shaken up to drive away and had to be shoved out of the driver&#x27;s seat by Siegel. Luciano took over Masseria&#x27;s family, with Genovese as his underboss.

In September 1931, Luciano and Genovese planned the murder of Maranzano. Luciano had received word that Maranzano was planning to kill him and Genovese, and prepared a hit team to kill Maranzano first. On September 10, 1931, when Maranzano summoned Luciano, Genovese, and Costello to a meeting at his office, they knew Maranzano would kill them there. Instead, Luciano sent to Maranzano&#x27;s office four Jewish gangsters whose faces were unknown to Maranzano&#x27;s people. They had been secured with the aid of Lansky and Siegel. After assassinating Maranzano, Luciano subsequently created The Commission to serve as the governing body for organized crime.

=== Years as consigliere ===
In 1931, after the Masseria and Maranzano murders, Luciano became the leader of the new Luciano crime family, with Genovese as underboss and Costello as &quot;consigliere&quot;. Costello quickly became one of the biggest earners for the Luciano family and began to carve his own niche in the underworld. He controlled the slot machine and bookmaking operations for the family with associate Philip &quot;Dandy Phil&quot; Kastel. Costello placed approximately 25,000 slot machines in bars, restaurants, cafes, drugstores, gas stations, and bus stops throughout New York. In 1934, Mayor Fiorello La Guardia confiscated thousands of Costello&#x27;s slot machines, loaded them on a barge, and dumped them into the river.

Costello&#x27;s next move was to accept Louisiana governor Huey Long&#x27;s proposal to put slot machines throughout Louisiana for 10% of the take. Costello made Kastel overseer of the Louisiana slot operation. Kastel had the assistance of New Orleans &quot;mafioso&quot; Carlos &quot;Little Man&quot; Marcello. Costello brought in millions of dollars in profit from slot machines and bookmaking to the Luciano family.

=== &quot;The Prime Minister&quot; ===
Costello and Luciano established extensive connections with Tammany Hall leaders early on; Luciano and Costello each shared hotel rooms with Tammany delegates to the 1932 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Costello continued to cultivate those relationships over the next two decades, intervening in Tammany&#x27;s affairs and collecting favors and pledges of loyalty from those politicians and judges he had helped, including William O&#x27;Dwyer, the two-term Mayor of New York City in the 1940s. Costello was able, in turn, to use those political debts to his advantage when other New York City crime families came to him for help.

The 1951 Kefauver Committee hearings on organized crime confirmed what observers of local politics already knew. Senator Kefauver concluded that Carmine DeSapio, leader of Tammany Hall, was assisting Costello and that Costello had become influential in decisions made by the Tammany Hall council. DeSapio admitted to having met Costello several times, but insisted that &quot;politics was never discussed&quot;.

=== Conflicts with Genovese ===
In 1936, Luciano was convicted of running a prostitution ring and was sentenced to a term of up to 30 to 50 years in state prison. He attempted to run the crime family from prison with the help of Costello and Lansky, but found it too difficult. With Luciano&#x27;s imprisonment, Genovese became acting boss of the Luciano crime family.

In 1937, Genovese fled to Italy to avoid prosecution for a 1934 murder. Luciano then appointed Costello as acting boss. Costello&#x27;s underboss was his cousin Willie Moretti.

Genovese returned to the United States in 1945. After the 1934 murder charges were dismissed following the death of two witnesses Genovese tried to convince Luciano to become a titular boss of bosses and let Genovese run everything. Luciano not only rejected Genovese&#x27;s proposal, but kept Costello and Moretti as acting boss and underboss.

=== Investigation, prosecution and imprisonment ===
From May 1950 to May 1951, the U.S. Senate conducted a large-scale investigation of organized crime, commonly known as the Kefauver Hearings, chaired by Senator Estes Kefauver of Tennessee. Costello attempted to minimize the impact of these hearings on his reputation when he was called as a witness, refusing to allow his face to be filmed during his questioning.

His demands had the opposite effect, as the news cameras focused instead on his hands as Costello fidgeted throughout the hearings, broadcasting his evasive answers and nervous gestures live to a huge nationwide audience. After sparring with the lawyers for the Committee for hours on the first day, he walked out of the hearing on the second day, claiming that he had a sore throat. When he returned to be questioned several days later he refused to answer questions about his net worth. Costello was eventually convicted of contempt of the Senate and sentenced to 18 months in prison for his refusal to answer questions.

The Kefauver hearings also led to the murder of Willie Moretti on October 4, 1951, on the orders of the Mafia Commission. The members of the Commission were concerned with Moretti&#x27;s erratic behavior before the Senate Committee and worried that Moretti&#x27;s advancing syphilis was affecting his brain and might lead him to talk to the press. Costello appointed Genovese as the new underboss after Moretti&#x27;s murder.

In 1952, the government began proceedings to strip Costello of his U.S. citizenship, and he was indicted for evasion of $73,417 in income taxes between 1946 and 1949 ($870,113 in 2024 dollars). He was sentenced to five years in prison and fined $20,000. In 1954, Costello appealed the conviction and was released on $50,000 bail; from 1952 to 1961 he was in and out of half a dozen federal and local prisons and jails, his confinement interrupted by periods when he was out on bail pending determination of appeals.

=== Assassination attempt and aftermath ===

In 1956, Adonis, a powerful Costello ally, chose deportation to Italy over a long prison sentence. His departure left Costello weakened, but Genovese still had to neutralize one more powerful Costello ally, Anastasia, who had taken over the Mangano crime family after the disappearance of boss Vincent Mangano and the murder of his brother Philip Mangano on April 14, 1951.

In early 1957, Genovese decided to move on Costello. Genovese ordered Vincent Gigante to murder Costello, and on May 2, 1957, Gigante shot and wounded Costello outside his apartment building. The altercation persuaded Costello to relinquish power to Genovese and retire. Genovese then controlled what is now called the Genovese crime family. A doorman identified Gigante as the gunman, but in 1958 Costello testified that he was unable to recognize his assailant; Gigante was acquitted of attempted murder.

On October 25, 1957, Anastasia was murdered at the barber shop of the Park Sheraton Hotel at 56th Street and 7th Avenue in Manhattan. Carlo Gambino was expected to be proclaimed boss of Anastasia&#x27;s family at the November 14, 1957 Apalachin Meeting that Genovese called to discuss the future of &quot;Cosa Nostra&quot; in light of his takeover. When police raided the meeting, to the detriment of Genovese&#x27;s reputation, Gambino&#x27;s appointment was postponed to a later meeting in New York City.

In 1959, Genovese was convicted of selling a large quantity of heroin. On April 17, 1959, Genovese was sentenced to 15 years in the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary in Atlanta, Georgia.

== Retirement and death ==

During his retirement, Costello was still known as &quot;The Prime Minister of the Underworld&quot;. He still retained power and influence in New York&#x27;s Mafia and remained busy throughout his final years. &quot;Cosa Nostra&quot; bosses and old associates such as Gambino and Lucchese still paid visits to Costello at his Waldorf Astoria penthouse, seeking advice on important Mafia affairs. Costello&#x27;s old friend Meyer Lansky also kept in touch. Costello occupied himself with gardening and displayed some of his flowers at local horticultural shows.

On February 20, 1961, the United States Supreme Court upheld a lower court order that stripped Costello of his US citizenship. But on February 17, 1964, the same court set aside a deportation order for Costello, citing a legal technicality.

In early February 1973, Costello suffered a heart attack at his Manhattan home and was rushed to Doctors Hospital in Manhattan, where he died on February 18. Costello&#x27;s sedate memorial service at a Manhattan funeral home was attended by 50 relatives, friends, and law enforcement agents. Costello is interred in a private mausoleum in St. Michael&#x27;s Cemetery in East Elmhurst, Queens. In 1974, after his enemy Carmine Galante was released from prison, he allegedly ordered the bombing of the doors to Costello&#x27;s mausoleum.

==In popular culture==
* Costello has been portrayed in several movies, including by actors Feodor Chaliapin Jr. in &quot;My Brother Anastasia&quot; (1973), James Andronica in &quot;Gangster Wars&quot; (1981), Carmine Caridi in &quot;Bugsy&quot; (1991), Costas Mandylor in &quot;Mobsters&quot; (1991), and by Kirk Baltz in the television movie &quot;&quot; (1995).
* Costello was referenced in the Allen Ginsberg poem &quot;Hadda Be Playing on the Jukebox&quot;. The line is written: &#x27;It had to be FBI chief J. Edgar Hoover / and Frank Costello syndicate mouthpiece / meeting in Central Park, New York weekends, / reported Time magazine&#x27;. The poem was later performed live (with music) by the band Rage Against the Machine on the album &quot;Live &amp; Rare&quot;.

<text>Charles William Morris (May 23, 1901 – January 15, 1979) was an American philosopher and semiotician.

==Early life and education==
A son of Charles William and Laura (Campbell) Morris, Charles William Morris was born on May 23, 1901, in Denver, Colorado.

Morris briefly attended the University of Wisconsin, and later studied engineering and psychology at Northwestern University, where he graduated with a B.S. in 1922. That same year, he entered the University of Chicago where he became a doctoral student in philosophy under the direction of George Herbert Mead. Morris completed his dissertation on a symbolic theory of mind and received a Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in 1925.

==Career==
After his graduation, Morris turned to teaching, first at Rice University, and later at the University of Chicago. In 1958 he became Research Professor at the University of Florida. His students included semiotician Thomas A. Sebeok. In 1937 Morris presided over the Western Division of the American Philosophical Association, and was Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

Morris was an instructor of philosophy for six years from 1925 to 1931 at Rice University in Houston, Texas. After leaving Rice, he was associate professor of philosophy at the University of Chicago from 1931 to 1947. Morris became a lecturing professor at Chicago in 1948, occupying the position until 1958 when he received an offer for a special appointment as a Research Professor at the University of Florida, where he remained until his death.

During his time at Rice University, Morris wrote and defended his philosophical perspective known as neo-pragmatism. He also worked on and published &quot;Six Theories of Mind&quot;. At the end of his term at Rice, Morris returned to the University of Chicago. In the early 1930s, the University of Chicago&#x27;s philosophy department was unstable, but in the midst of change and difficult economic times, Morris felt that philosophy would serve as a torch that would light the way to saving world civilization. Morris had hoped to create an institute of philosophy at the University of Chicago, but his efforts to convince the university president of such a venture were unsuccessful.

===Semiotics===

Morris&#x27;s development of a behavioral theory of signs—i.e., semiotics—is partly due to his desire to unify logical positivism with behavioral empiricism and pragmatism. Morris&#x27;s union of these three philosophical perspectives eventuated in his claim that symbols have three types of relations: 
# to objects,
# to persons, and
# to other symbols.
He later called these relations &quot;semantics&quot;, &quot;pragmatics&quot;, and &quot;syntactics&quot;. Viewing semiotics as a way to bridge philosophical outlooks, Morris grounded his sign theory in Mead&#x27;s social behaviorism. In fact, Morris&#x27;s interpretation of an interpretant, a term used in the semiotics of Charles Sanders Peirce, has been understood to be strictly psychological. Morris&#x27;s system of signs emphasizes the role of stimulus and response in the orientation, manipulation, and consummation phases of action. His mature semiotic theory is traced out in &quot;Signs, Language, and Behavior&quot; (1946). Morris&#x27;s semiotic is concerned with explaining the tri-relation between syntactics, semantics, and pragmatics in a dyadic way, which is very different from the semiotics of C. S. Peirce. This caused some to argue that Morris misinterpreted Peirce by converting the interpretant into a logically &quot;existent&quot; thing.

===Institute for American Thought===

Toward the end of his life in 1976, Morris sent two instalments of his work to the Institute for American Thought (IAT) at Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI). Three years later in 1979, Morris&#x27;s daughter, Sally Petrilli, arranged to have additional installments of his work sent to IUPUI. In 1984 Italian philosopher Ferruccio Rossi-Landi added to the Morris collection at IUPUI by sending his correspondence with Charles W. Morris. Among the vast Morris collection at the IAT are 381 titles of books and journal articles regarding pragmatism, logical empiricism, poetry, ethics, and Asian studies.

==Personal life==
In 1925, Morris married Gertrude E. Thompson, with whom he had a daughter, Sally Morris Petrilli. In 1951, he married his second wife, Ellen Ruth Allen, a psychologist.

Charles William Morris died on January 15, 1979, in Gainesville, Florida.

===Unity of Science Movement===
While on sabbatical from the University of Chicago in 1934, Morris traveled abroad, visiting Europe and meeting working philosophers such as Bertrand Russell and members of the Vienna Circle, like Rudolf Carnap, Otto Neurath, and Moritz Schlick. Morris was greatly impressed with the logical positivist (logical empiricist) movement. While presenting a paper in Prague at the Eighth International Congress of Philosophy, he discussed his hopes for a union of pragmatism and positivism. Sympathetic to the positivist&#x27;s philosophical project, Morris became the most vocal advocate in the United States for Otto Neurath&#x27;s &quot;Unity of Science Movement&quot;.

During the 1930s, Morris helped several German and Austrian philosophers emigrate to the United States, including Rudolf Carnap in 1936. As a part of the &quot;Unity of Science Movement&quot;, Morris worked closely with Neurath and Carnap to produce the &quot;International Encyclopedia of Unified Science&quot;. As co-editor of the &quot;Encyclopedia&quot;, Morris procured publication in America from the University of Chicago Press. His involvement with the &quot;Encyclopedia&quot; spanned for ten years when the project lost momentum in 1943. Both Morris and Carnap found it difficult to keep the &quot;Encyclopedia&quot; alive due to insufficient funds. In the latter part of the 1940s, Morris was finally able to secure funding that allowed the project to last until its final publication in the 1970s.

<text>Milton Hyland Erickson (5 December 1901 – 25 March 1980) was an American psychiatrist and psychologist specializing in medical hypnosis and family therapy. He was the founding president of the American Society for Clinical Hypnosis. He is noted for his approach to the unconscious mind as creative and solution-generating. He is also noted for influencing brief therapy, strategic family therapy, family systems therapy, solution focused brief therapy, and neuro-linguistic programming.

== Early life and education ==

Biographical sketches have been presented in a number of resources, the earliest being by Jay Haley in &quot;Advanced Techniques of Hypnosis and Therapy&quot; which was written in 1968 and in collaboration with Erickson himself. Though they never met Erickson, the authors of &quot;The Worlds Greatest Hypnotists&quot; wrote a biography. The following information about his life is documented in that source. 

Milton Hyland Erickson was the second child of nine of Albert and Clara Erickson. He was born in a mining camp in Aurum, Nevada where his father mined silver. The family moved to the farming community of Beaver Dam, Wisconsin when he was quite young and settled on a modest farm. The children (two boys and seven girls) all attended the one-room schoolhouse in nearby Lowell. The family farm demanded a great deal of physical labor.

Erickson was late in learning to speak and had difficulties in reading, which he described as dyslexia. He was also color blind and tone deaf. Later in life, when he explained what seemed to be extraordinary abilities, he stated that the disabilities (dyslexia, color blindness, being tone-deaf) helped him to focus on aspects of communication and behavior which most people overlooked. This is a typical example of emphasizing the positive, which is characteristic of his overall approach.

Though the family valued education, books were scarce. Erickson&#x27;s desire to learn led him to repeatedly read the dictionary from front to back, along with the few other texts that the family treasured. He claimed to have overcome his dyslexia and described the pivotal moments in a paper entitled &quot;Auto-hypnotic Experiences of Milton Erickson,&quot; which is found in &quot;The Collected Works of Milton H. Erickson, MD.&quot; He later characterized his early moments of creative change (which he described as a &quot;blinding flash of light&quot;) as an early spontaneous auto-hypnotic experience.

Erickson became interested in hypnosis at an early age when a traveling entertainer passed through the area. According to his later description, he felt that hypnosis was too powerful a tool to be left to entertainers. He decided to bring this tool into the realm of scientific evaluation as well as into the practice of medicine. Erickson already admired the local community doctor and had committed himself to becoming a physician.
At age 17, he contracted polio which left him with additional lifelong disabilities. Having long been interested in hypnosis, the year of his recovery gave him the opportunity to explore the potential of self-healing through hypnosis. He began to recall &quot;body memories&quot; of the muscular activity of his own body. By concentrating on these memories, he claimed to have learned to tweak his muscles and to regain control of parts of his body, to the point where he was eventually able to talk and use his arms. Still unable to walk, he claimed to have trained his body by embarking on a thousand-mile canoe trip with only a few dollars, following which he was able to walk with a cane. He continued to use a cane throughout his adult life, requiring a wheelchair only in his last decade of life. Erickson attributed his own self-healing to giving him additional insight into hypnosis.
After recovering his ability to walk Erickson attended the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where he attained graduate degrees in both psychology and medicine. There he also embarked on formal studies of hypnosis in the laboratory of Clark Hull. However, because his ideas were somewhat different from Hull&#x27;s, Erickson independently embarked upon rigorous scientific explorations regarding the nature of hypnosis. He received his M. D. degree from the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine with an emphasis on Neurology and Psychiatry in 1928. Between 1929 and 1948, Erickson then took a series of positions at state hospitals that facilitated active research. He continued research in hypnosis as he refined his practical therapeutic skills. He was already a prolific writer focusing primarily on case studies and experimental work. These earlier writings greatly advanced the general understanding of hypnosis and are included in &quot;The&quot; &quot;Collected Works of Milton Erickson, M.D.&quot;

During WWII, Erickson conducted physical and mental examinations of soldiers. Eventually the U.S. intelligence services asked him to meet with other experts in an effort to better understand the psychological and mental factors involved in communications relating to combat. In this capacity, Margaret Mead and Gregory Bateson were among those with whom Erickson worked and with whom he developed lifelong friendships. Over the subsequent decades these scholars collaborated on numerous projects.

In his late 40s Erickson developed post-polio syndrome. This resulted in additional muscle loss and pain. At that time Erickson, his wife Elizabeth, and his family of five children left Detroit and his position at Eloise State Hospital and relocated in Phoenix, Arizona, where they believed the weather conditions would be conducive to his healing. There Erickson established himself in private practice, working out of his home for the remainder of his life.

In Phoenix, Erickson became active in the Society for Clinical and Educational Hypnosis (SCEH). This organization promoted research and taught physicians how to use clinical hypnosis. Due to personality clashes and strong feelings regarding the most effective ways in which to bring clinical hypnosis into the hands of practicing physicians and dentists, Erickson broke away from the SCEH and formed the American Society of Clinical Hypnosis (ASCH) in July 1957. For a decade he was the founding editor of the &quot;American Journal of Clinical Hypnosis&quot; and had at least one article in every issue. He dedicated the next two decades of his life to professional writing, teaching other professionals, and maintaining a private practice. This was a productive period during which he developed and refined his own unique style of hypnotherapy, which caught the attention of other notables.

His ongoing relationship with Gregory Bateson led some to take an interest in Erickson&#x27;s unique communication skills and therapeutic approaches. In 1973 Jay Haley published &quot;Uncommon Therapy&quot;, a book that first brought Erickson and his approaches to the attention of those outside the clinical hypnosis community. Erickson&#x27;s fame and reputation spread rapidly, and so many people wished to meet him that he began holding teaching seminars. These continued until his death.

Throughout his professional career Erickson collaborated with a number of serious students. Colleagues who recognized the uniqueness and effectiveness of Erickson&#x27;s approaches collected his publications into many volumes. His weekly workshops remained popular until his death. Towards the end of his life, Erickson&#x27;s students began to formulate conceptual frameworks for his work and to explain and characterize it in their own way. Those efforts have influenced a vast number of psychotherapeutic directions, including brief therapy, family systems therapy, neuro-linguistic programming, among others.

Milton H. Erickson died in March 1980, aged 78, leaving behind his wife Elizabeth, four sons, four daughters.

==Hypnosis==
===Trance and the unconscious mind===
Erickson&#x27;s view of the unconscious mind was distinctly different from that of Freud whose ideas dominated the context of the times. Zeig quotes Erickson as describing &quot;The unconscious mind is made up of all your learnings over a lifetime, many of which you have forgotten, but which serve you in your automatic functioning&quot;. Andre Weitzenhoffer points out: &quot;The Ericksonian &#x27;unconscious&#x27; lacks in particular the hostile and aggressive aspects so characteristic of Freud&#x27;s system&quot;.

Erickson relied on a supposition of an active, significant, unconscious. It was Erickson&#x27;s perspective that hypnosis provided a tool with which to communicate with the unconscious mind and access the reservoir of resources held within. He describes in a 1944 article on unconscious mental activity, &quot;Since hypnosis can be induced by trance and manifests the unwarranted assumption is made that whatever develops from hypnosis must be completely a result of suggestion, and primarily an expression of it&quot;. In the same publication Erickson repeatedly comments about the autonomy of the unconscious mind and its capacity to solve problems.

The essential element of Erickson&#x27;s jokes was not hostility, but surprise. It was not uncommon for him to slip indirect suggestions into a myriad of situations. He also included humor in his books, papers, lectures and seminars.

Early in his career Erickson was a pioneer in researching the unique and remarkable phenomena that are associated with that state, spending many hours at a time with individual subjects, deepening the trance. Erickson&#x27;s work on depth of trance is detailed in his 1952 paper in which he provided history, justification, and ideas about its use. (&quot;Trance states for therapeutic purposes may be either light or deep, depending on such factors as the patient&#x27;s personality, the nature of his problem, and the stage of his therapeutic progress&quot;.)

Where traditional hypnosis is authoritative and direct and often encounters resistance in the subject, Erickson&#x27;s approach is permissive, accommodating and indirect.

=== Techniques ===
While Erickson explored a vast arena of induction methodologies and techniques of suggestions, there are certain areas where his name is known as key in the development or popularity of the approaches. He used direct and indirect approaches, though he is most known for his indirect and permissive suggestion techniques.

=== Indirect suggestions ===
Erickson maintained that it was not consciously possible to instruct the unconscious mind, and that authoritarian suggestions were likely to be met with resistance. The unconscious mind responds to opportunity, metaphors, symbols, and contradictions. Therefore, effective hypnotic suggestion should be &quot;artfully vague,&quot; leaving space for the subject to fill in the gaps with their own unconscious understandings – even if they do not consciously grasp what is happening. He developed both verbal and non-verbal techniques and pioneered the idea that the common experiences of wonderment, engrossment and confusion are, in fact, just kinds of trance. An excellent example of this can be viewed in the documentary film.

=== Metaphor ===
Erickson sometimes instructed people to climb a mountain or visit a botanical garden. His narrative and experiential metaphors are explored extensively in Sydney Rosen&#x27;s &quot;My Voice Will Go With You&quot;, but an example is given in the first chapter of David Gordon&#x27;s book &quot;Phoenix&quot;. The following quotes Erickson: I was returning from high school one day and a runaway horse with a bridle on sped past a group of us into a farmer&#x27;s yard looking for a drink of water. The horse was perspiring heavily. And the farmer didn&#x27;t recognize it so we cornered it. I hopped on the horse&#x27;s back. Since it had a bridle on, I took hold of the tick rein and said, &quot;Giddy-up.&quot; Headed for the highway, I knew the horse would turn in the right direction. &quot;I&quot; didn&#x27;t know what the right direction was. And the horse trotted and galloped along. Now and then he would forget he was on the highway and start into a field. So I would pull on him a bit and call his attention to the fact the highway was where he was supposed to be. And finally, about four miles from where I had boarded him, he turned into a farmyard and the farmer said, &quot;So that&#x27;s how that critter came back. Where did you find him?&quot; I said, &quot;About four miles from here.&quot; &quot;How did you know you should come here?&quot; I said, &quot;I didn&#x27;t know. The horse knew. All I did was keep his attention on the road.&quot; 

=== Interspersal technique ===
Erickson describes hypnotic technique as a means to an end while psychotherapy addresses guidance of the subject&#x27;s behaviors. As such, the same hypnotic technique can be applied towards diverse patient concerns. In his discussion of the applications of the interspersal technique, Erickson offers two case examples in which a similar application of the technique was made. One patient was suffering from intolerable malignant pain from a terminal condition, while the other subject was an intelligent though illiterate man who sought to relieve a disabling symptom of frequent urination. Erickson provides an interesting case write up for each of the cases chosen to illustrate his use of the interspersal technique. Erickson provides a transcript for the induction in which he interwove personalized therapeutic suggestion, selected specifically for the patient, within the hypnotic induction itself. The transcript offered illustrates how easily hypnotherapeutic suggestions can be included in the trance induction along with trance-maintenance suggestions. In the follow-up case discussions Erickson credits the patients&#x27; positive responses to the receptivity of their unconscious minds: they knew why they were seeking therapy, they were desirous of benefiting from suggestions. Erickson goes on to state that one should also give recognition to the readiness with which one&#x27;s unconscious mind picks up clues and information. Erickson stated that &quot;Respectful awareness of the capacity of the patient&#x27;s unconscious mind to perceive the meaningfulness of the therapist&#x27;s own unconscious behavior is a governing principle in psychotherapy. The patient&#x27;s unconscious mind is listening and understanding much better than is possible for his conscious mind&quot;.

=== Confusion technique ===
&quot;In all my techniques, almost all, there is a confusion&quot;. – Milton H. Erickson

Erickson describes the confusion technique of hypnotic induction that he developed as being done either through pantomime or through plays on words. Spoken to attentive listeners with complete earnestness, a burden of constructing a meaning is placed upon the subject, and before they can reject it another statement can be made to hold their attention. One example is offered in which he uses verb tenses to keep the subject &quot;…in a state of constant endeavor to sort out the intended meaning&quot;. He offers the following example: One may declare so easily that the present and the past can be so readily summarized by the simple statement &quot;That which is now will soon be yesterday&#x27;s future even as it will be tomorrow&#x27;s was. Thus the past, the present, and the future all used in reference to the reality of today&quot;. Erickson describes the second element of confusion to be the inclusion of irrelevancies and non-sequiturs. Taken in context these verbal distractions are confusing and lead progressively to the subject&#x27;s earnest desire for and an actual need to receive some communication they can readily understand. A primary consideration of the confusion technique is the consistent maintenance of a general causal but definitely interested attitude and speaking in a gravely earnest and intent manner expressive of a certain utterly complete expectation of the subject&#x27;s understanding. Erickson wrote several articles detailing the technique and results that can be achieved. This succinct overview comes from a 1964 article, one of several detailing the technique, the justification and the responses that could be achieved.

=== Handshake induction ===
Erickson describes the routine as follows:
* Initiation: When I begin by shaking hands, I do so normally. The &quot;hypnotic touch&quot; then begins when I let loose. The letting loose becomes transformed from a firm grip into a gentle touch by the thumb, a lingering drawing away of the little finger, a faint brushing of the subject&#x27;s hand with the middle finger – just enough vague sensation to attract the attention. As the subject gives attention to the touch of your thumb, you shift to a touch with your little finger. As your subject&#x27;s attention follows that, you shift to a touch with your middle finger and then again to the thumb.
* This arousal of attention is merely an arousal without constituting a stimulus for a response.
* The subject&#x27;s withdrawal from the handshake is arrested by this attention arousal, which establishes a waiting set, and expectancy.
* Then almost, but not quite simultaneously (to ensure separate neural recognition), you touch the under-surface of the hand (wrist) so gently that it barely suggests an upward push. This is followed by a similar utterly slight downward touch, and then I sever contact so gently that the subject does not know exactly when – and the subject&#x27;s hand is left going neither up nor down, but cataleptic.
* Termination: If you don&#x27;t want your subject to know what you are doing, you simply distract their attention, usually by some appropriate remark, and casually terminate. Sometimes they remark, &quot;What did you say? I got absentminded there for a moment and wasn&#x27;t paying attention to anything.&quot; This is slightly distressing to the subjects and indicative of the fact that their attention was so focused and fixated on the peculiar hand stimuli that they were momentarily entranced, so they did not hear what was said
* Utilization: Any utilization leads to increasing trance depth. All utilization should proceed as a continuation of extension of the initial procedure. Much can be done nonverbally. For example, if any subjects are just looking blankly at me, I may slowly shift my gaze downward, causing them to look at their hand, which I touch and say &quot;Look at this spot.&quot; This intensifies the trance state. Then, whether the subjects are looking at you or at their hand, or just staring blankly, you can use your left hand to touch their elevated right hand from above or the side – so long as you merely give the suggestion of downward movement. Occasionally a downward nudge or push is required. If a strong push or nudge is required, check for anesthesia.

=== Hand levitation ===
The nature of the induction is for the hypnotherapist to repeatedly suggest a lightness in the hand, which results in a dissociative response and the hand elevating unconsciously. Erickson was the first to describe the hand levitation method of induction, described as being broadly applicable.

Weitzenhoffer describes the technique as broadly applicable, quoting Lewis Wolberg&#x27;s opinion that the hand levitation method of induction is &quot;the best of all induction procedures. It permits the participation in the induction process by the patient and lends itself to non-directive and analytic techniques ... It is however, the most difficult of methods and calls for greater endurance on the part of the hypnotist&quot;.

=== Resistance ===
In the book &quot;Uncommon Therapy,&quot; Jay Haley identified several strategies that appeared repeatedly in Erickson&#x27;s therapeutic approach. For Erickson, the classic therapeutic request to &quot;Tell me everything about ...,&quot; was both aggressive and disrespectful. Instead he would ask the resistant patient to withhold information and only to tell what they were ready to reveal:[Erickson] &quot;I usually say, &quot;There are a number of things that you don&#x27;t want me to know about, that you don&#x27;t want to tell me. There are a lot of things about yourself that you don&#x27;t want to discuss, therefore let&#x27;s discuss those that you are willing to discuss.&quot; She has blanket permission to withhold anything and everything. But she did come to discuss things. And therefore, she starts discussing this, discussing that. And it&#x27;s always &quot;Well, this is all right to talk about.&quot; And before she&#x27;s finished, she has mentioned everything. And each new item – &quot;Well, this really isn&#x27;t so important that I have to withhold it. I can use the withholding permission for more important matters.&quot; Simply a hypnotic technique. To make them respond to the idea of withholding, and to respond to the idea of communicating.&quot;Some people might react to a direction by thinking &quot;Why should I?&quot; or &quot;You can&#x27;t make me.&quot; This is called a &quot;polarity response&quot; because it motivates the subject to consider the polar opposite of the suggestion. The conscious mind recognizes negation in speech (&quot;Don&#x27;t do X&quot;) but according to Erickson, the unconscious mind pays more attention to the &quot;X&quot; than the injunction &quot;Don&#x27;t do.&quot; Thus, Erickson used this as the basis for suggestions that deliberately played on negation and tonally marked the important wording, to provide that whatever the client did, it would be beneficial: &quot;You don&#x27;t have to &quot;go into a trance&quot;, so you can &quot;easily wonder&quot; about what you notice no faster than &quot;you feel ready&quot; to become aware that &quot;your hand is slowly rising.&quot;&quot;

=== Double bind ===
Providing a worse alternative (The &#x27;Double Bind&#x27;) – Example: &quot;Do you want to go into a trance now, or later?&quot; The &#x27;double bind&#x27; is a way of overloading the subject with two options, the acceptance of either of which represents acceptance of a therapeutic suggestion.

Erickson provides the following examples: &quot;My first well-remembered intentional use of the double bind occurred in early boyhood. One winter day, with the weather below zero, my father led a calf out of the barn to the water trough. After the calf had satisfied its thirst, they turned back to the barn, but at the doorway the calf stubbornly braced its feet, and despite my father&#x27;s desperate pulling on the halter, he could not budge the animal. I was outside playing in the snow and, observing the impasse, began laughing heartily. My father challenged me to pull the calf into the barn. Recognizing the situation as one of unreasoning stubborn resistance on the part of the calf, I decided to let the calf have full opportunity to resist, since that was what it apparently wished to do. Accordingly, I presented the calf with a double bind by seizing it by the tail and pulling it away from the barn, while my father continued to pull it inward. The calf promptly chose to resist the weaker of the two forces and dragged me into the barn&quot;.

=== Shocks and ordeals ===
Erickson is famous for pioneering indirect techniques, but his shock therapy tends to get less attention. Erickson was prepared to use psychological shocks and ordeals in order to achieve given results: The ordeal process is different from other therapeutic techniques originated by Erickson. Extending the dissociative effects of paradox and non sequitur, wherein confusion is used only as an entry to a trance state, the technique of ordeal superimposes a distressing but achievable challenge over the therapeutic aim such that the achievement of the former implies a positive outcome in the latter. Hence ordeal therapy is not merely an induction technique but a theory of change. The therapist&#x27;s task is to impose an ordeal, appropriate to the problem the person wishes to change, an ordeal more severe than the problem. The main requirement is that it will cause distress equal to or greater than that caused by the symptom. It is also best that the ordeal is good for the person. The ordeal must have another characteristic: it must be something the person can do. It must be of such a nature that the therapist can easily say &quot;This won&#x27;t violate any of your moral standards and is something you can do&quot;. The final characteristic is that it should not harm anyone else. One final aspect of the ordeal is that sometimes the person must go through it repeatedly to recover from the symptom.

=== Influence on others ===
One of Erickson&#x27;s first students and developers of his work was Jay Haley. Other important followers who studied directly with Erickson include Ernest Rossi, Stephen Gilligan, Jeffrey Zeig, Bill O&#x27;Hanlon, Michele Ritterman, Stephen Lankton, Richard Landis, Jane Parsons-Fein, Herb Lustig, Alex &amp; Annellen Simpkins and Sidney Rosen.

Erickson eschewed rigid approaches to therapy and thus never accepted a binding framework or schematic set of procedures during his lifetime, though a multitude of other approaches grew from his perspective and practice. He had a strong influence on the diverse areas of Strategic therapy, Family Systems, Brief Therapy, Ordeal Therapy, Narrative Therapy, and Neuro-Linguistic Programming.

=== Ericksonian approaches ===
Following Erickson&#x27;s death in 1980, The Erickson Foundation held a conference which at the time was the largest professional hypnosis conference ever held. Afterward, many participants began to teach Erickson&#x27;s ideas in their own way. It was not until after Erickson&#x27;s death that the word Ericksonian was used to describe his methodology. Over the decades that followed, there were various attempts to identify the key components that bring together the individual styles of an Ericksonian. In an attempt to identify the key elements of Erickson&#x27;s work, Stephen Lankton contributed an extensive overview of Erickson&#x27;s ideas and techniques which he referred to as the &quot;Ericksonian Footprint&quot;. More recently, the development of Ericksonian Core Competencies spearheaded by Dan Short and Scott Miller defines Ericksonian approaches in a manner that makes it amenable to evidence-based studies.

Lankton and Matthews state that perhaps Erickson&#x27;s greatest contribution to psychotherapy was not his innovative techniques, but his ability to de-pathologize people and consider a patient&#x27;s problematic behavior as indicative of a best choice available to the individual. His approach was to facilitate the patient&#x27;s access to inner resources to solve the problems.

A 1954 article by Erickson describes his technique of utilizing a patient&#x27;s own personality and ideas, &quot;Doing it His Own Way&quot;, in which a patient requested hypnosis for the explicit purpose of ceasing his reckless driving, and the patient did not want psychotherapy for any other purpose. Erickson worked with him and provided a summary of the case, after carefully assessing the patient&#x27;s potential for safe practices, as well as his motivation for change. The discussion of working with the patient while allowing him to guide his own healing is a clear example of the concept of utilization for which Erickson has become known. Another key principle that is associated with Erickson&#x27;s techniques is described in his 1964 paper entitled the &quot;Burden of Effective Psychotherapy&quot; whereby he describes the essential nature of the investment of the subject in the experiential process of healing.

An entry in the American Psychological Association Dictionary of Psychology defines Ericksonian psychotherapy as a &quot;form of psychotherapy in which the therapist works with the client to create, through hypnosis and specifically through indirect suggestion and suggestive metaphors and real life experiences, intended to activate previously dormant intra-psychic resources&quot;.

== Controversy ==
A colleague, friend and fellow researcher, André Weitzenhoffer, an author in the field of hypnosis himself, has criticized some ideas and influence of Erickson in various writings, such as his textbook &quot;The Practice of Hypnotism&quot;. Weitzenhoffer displays a clear and explicitly stated, opposition to Ericksonian hypnosis in his book, in favor of what he terms the semi-traditional, scientific, approach. For Erickson, the shift from conscious to unconscious functioning is the essence of trance. Nowhere in his writing however, can one find an explicit definition of the term &quot;unconscious&quot; or, for that matter, of &quot;conscious&quot;.

This criticism persists among clinicians and researchers of today, not only about Erickson himself, but also about his followers. Nash and Barnier note that some clinicians, especially those working in the tradition of Milton Erickson may discount the importance of hypnotizability.

In a book largely complementary to the works of Erickson, Rosen alludes to the uncertainty that can result from his clinical demonstrations: &quot;This has nevertheless raised the question of whether or not the patient is playing a role by pretending not to feel pain…&quot; Erickson&#x27;s daughter Roxanna Erickson-Klein, also a trained psychotherapist, validated this uncertainty about the completeness of Erickson&#x27;s case reports and demonstrations. She added that although he tirelessly advocated scientific investigations of hypnosis and was a prolific writer on techniques, he often left details out of case reports that could have been meaningful to clinicians of today. More importantly, critics often overlook the context of the times. He was a physician who worked from a framework of a country doctor, and clinicians of today are hasty to judge by today&#x27;s standards, while not taking into consideration the context of the times.

Self-professed &quot;skeptical hypnotist,&quot; Alex Tsander, cited concerns in his 2005 book &quot;Beyond Erickson: A Fresh Look at &quot;The Emperor of Hypnosis&quot;&quot;, the title of which alludes to Charcot&#x27;s characterization in the previous century as &quot;The Napoleon of the Neuroses.&quot; Tsander re-evaluates a swathe of Erickson&#x27;s accounts of his therapeutic approaches and lecture demonstrations in the context of scientific literature on hypnotism and his own experience in giving live demonstrations of hypnotic technique. Emphasizing social-psychological perspectives, Tsander introduces an &quot;interpretive filter&quot; with which he re-evaluates Erickson&#x27;s own accounts of his demonstrations and introduces prosaic explanations for occurrences that both Erickson and other authors tend to portray as remarkable.

In an audiotape that is attributed to him&quot;,&quot; Dharma Teacher Tenshin, Reb Anderson of the Zen tradition, has referred to Erickson as a &quot;Magician/Healer.&quot; Zeig concurs that professional skepticism and education is paramount for the advancement of a discipline. He states &quot;Among psychotherapists there are some who worship Erickson with a reverence that borders on idolatry. Every word, sentiment, opinion, or act is presumed to have an inspired meaning. Such deification rooted in expectation of timeless power and omnipotence can ultimately lead to disillusionment. Equally prejudiced are those who regard Erickson as a maverick whose egregious methods are a passing fancy that will eventually be consigned to the dustbin of outmoded schemes. [Both] these attitudes do injustice to a highly creative and imaginative original mind... A poignant criticism of Erickson&#x27;s strategic therapy is that it is overvalued by those who believe that clever tactics can substitute for disciplined training.&quot;

<text>Friedrich Salomon Perls (July 8, 1893 – March 14, 1970), better known as Fritz Perls, was a German-born psychiatrist, psychoanalyst and psychotherapist. Perls coined the term &quot;Gestalt therapy&quot; to identify the form of psychotherapy that he developed with his wife, Laura Perls, in the 1940s and 1950s. Perls became associated with the Esalen Institute in 1964 and lived there until 1969.

The core of the Gestalt therapy process is enhanced awareness of sensation, perception, bodily feelings, emotion, and behavior, in the present moment. Relationship is emphasized, along with contact between the self, its environment, and the other.

==Life==
Fritz Perls was born in Berlin, Germany, in 1893. He grew up in the bohemian scene in Berlin, participated in Expressionism and Dadaism, and experienced the turning of the artistic avant-garde toward the revolutionary left. Deployment to the front line, the trauma of war, antisemitism, intimidation, escape, and the Holocaust are further key sources of biographical influence.

He was expected to practice law, following his distinguished uncle Herman Staub, but instead he studied medicine. Perls joined the German Army during World War I and spent time in the trenches. After the war in 1918 he returned to his medical studies graduating two years later, specializing in neuropsychiatry as a medical doctor, and then became an assistant to Kurt Goldstein, who worked with brain injured soldiers. Perls gravitated toward psychoanalysis.

In 1927, Perls became a member of Wilhelm Reich&#x27;s technical seminars in Vienna. Reich&#x27;s concept of character analysis influenced Perls to a large extent. And in 1930 Reich became Perls&#x27; supervising senior analyst in Berlin.

In 1930, Perls married Laura Perls (born Lore Posner) and they had two children together, Renate and Stephen. In 1933, soon after the Hitler regime came to power, being of Jewish descent and because of their anti-fascist political activities in the time before, Perls, Laura, and their eldest child Renate fled to the Netherlands, and one year later they emigrated to South Africa, where Perls started a psychoanalytic training institute. In 1936 he had a brief and unsatisfactory meeting with Freud.

In 1942, Perls joined the South African army, and he served as an army psychiatrist with the rank of captain until 1946. While in South Africa, Perls was influenced by the &quot;holism&quot; of Jan Smuts. During this period Fritz Perls co-wrote his first book, &quot;Ego, Hunger, and Aggression&quot; (published in 1942 and re-published in 1947). Laura Perls wrote two chapters of the book, although when it was re-published in the United States she was not given any recognition for her work.

Fritz and Laura Perls left South Africa in 1946 and ended up in New York City, where Fritz Perls worked briefly with Karen Horney, and Wilhelm Reich. After living through a peripatetic episode, during which he lived in Montreal and served as a cruise ship psychiatrist, Perls finally settled in Manhattan. Perls wrote his second book with the assistance of New York intellectual and author, Paul Goodman, who drafted the theoretical second part of the book based upon Perls&#x27; hand-written notes. Perls and Goodman were influenced by the work of Kurt Lewin and Otto Rank. Along with the experiential first part, written with Ralph Hefferline, the book was entitled &quot;Gestalt Therapy&quot; and published in 1951.

Thereafter, Fritz and Laura Perls started the first Gestalt Institute in their Manhattan apartment. Fritz Perls began traveling throughout the United States in order to conduct Gestalt workshops and training.

In 1960 Fritz Perls left Laura Perls behind in Manhattan and moved to Los Angeles, where he practiced in conjunction with Jim Simkin. He started to offer workshops at Esalen Institute in Big Sur, California, in 1963. Perls became interested in Zen during this period, and incorporated the idea of &quot;mini-satori&quot; (a brief awakening) into his practice. He also traveled to Japan, where he stayed in a Zen monastery.

Eventually, he settled at Esalen, and even built a house on the grounds. One of his students at Esalen was Dick Price, who developed Gestalt Practice, based in large part upon what he learned from Perls. At Esalen, Perls collaborated with Ida Rolf, founder of Rolfing, to address the relationship between the mind and the body.

Perls has been widely cited outside the realm of psychotherapy for a quotation often described as the &quot;Gestalt prayer&quot;:

In 1969 Perls left Esalen and started a Gestalt community at Lake Cowichan on Vancouver Island, Canada. There, he hosted eight educational films on his gestalt therapy, which were directed by Stanley Fox for Aquarian Productions, a film production company started by Perls associate Norman Hirt.

Fritz Perls died of heart failure in Chicago, on March 14, 1970, after heart surgery at the Louis A. Weiss Memorial Hospital.

==Lifestyle==

Perls was a heavy smoker, first experiencing cigarettes at the age of eight but then becoming a chain smoker due to his experiences in the Second World War, Perls also used LSD recreationally during the 1960’s.

Perls practiced non-monogamy and had many sexual and romantic encounters outside of his marriage to Laura Perls, he describes his marriage to Laura as partners with shared goals that had episodes of love.

==Reception==

Perls&#x27; approach to therapy was included in criticism by Jeffrey Masson, a psychoanalyst who feuded with journalists and with the psychoanalytic community generally over his controversial theories disputing the effectiveness of psychotherapy. Masson said that Perls was sexist, as well as physically and emotionally abusive towards women in his private life. Masson quoted Perls from his autobiography, &quot;In and Out the Garbage Pail&quot;, where Perls wrote:
Once I was called to a group to calm down a girl who attacked everyone in the group physically. The group members tried to hold her and to calm her down. In vain. Again and again she got up and fought. When I came in she charged with her head down into my belly and nearly knocked me over: Then I let her have it until I had her on the floor. Up she came again. And then a third time. I got her down again and said, gasping: &quot;I&#x27;ve beaten up more than one bitch in my life.&quot; Then she got up, threw her arms around me: &quot;Fritz, I love you.&quot; Apparently she finally got what, all her life, she was asking for.

And there are thousands of women like her in the States. Provoking and tantalizing, bitching, irritating their husbands and never getting their spanking. You don&#x27;t have to be a Parisian prostitute to need that so as to respect your man. A Polish saying is: &quot;My husband lost interest in me, he never beats me any more.&quot;
Therapist Barry Stevens, who met Fritz Perls for the first time in 1967, described a different impression of him. She wrote: &quot;... I know that Fritz doesn&#x27;t like his arrogance, and along with it, he has such a beautiful humility.&quot; And later she said: &quot;Fritz is almost always a very warm and gentle old gentleman now.&quot;

Stevens also described another incident from a group therapy session: &quot;... Fritz Perls asked us all a question and waited for answers. ... I said nothing. He said &#x27;Barry?&#x27; &#x27;I&#x27;m blank,&quot; I said. He nodded and went on to someone or something else. How nice to have my blankness easily accepted.&quot;

Erving Polster, psychologist and Gestalt therapist, founding faculty member of the Gestalt Institute of Cleveland in 1953, said about Fritz Perls: “From Fritz I got the realization that a person could have incredible range in characteristics. I could experience Fritz as the most cutting and as the most tender of all people.”

<text>Virginia Satir (June 26, 1916 – September 10, 1988) was an American author, clinical social worker and psychotherapist, recognized for her approach to family therapy. Her pioneering work in the field of family reconstruction therapy honored her with the title &quot;Mother of Family Therapy&quot;. Her best known books are &quot;Conjoint Family Therapy&quot;, 1964, &quot;Peoplemaking&quot;, 1972, and &quot;The New Peoplemaking&quot;, 1988.

She is also known for creating the Virginia Satir Change Process Model, a psychological model developed through clinical studies. Change management and organizational &quot;gurus&quot; of the 1990s and 2000s embrace this model to define how change impacts organizations. She died in 1988 in Menlo Park, California, of pancreatic cancer, aged 72.

==Early years==

Virginia Satir was born on June 26, 1916 in Neillsville, Wisconsin. She was the eldest of five children born to Oscar Alfred Reinnard Pagenkopf and Minnie (Happe) Pagenkopf. When she was five years old, Satir suffered from appendicitis. Her mother, a devout Christian Scientist, refused to take her to a doctor. By the time Satir&#x27;s father decided to overrule his wife, the young girl&#x27;s appendix had ruptured. Doctors were able to save her life, but Satir was forced to stay in the hospital for several months.

When Satir was three years old, she taught herself to read and by age nine, she had read all of the books in the library of her small one-room school. 
From early years, Satir demonstrated an interest in family dynamics. When she was five, she decided that she would grow up to be &quot;a children&#x27;s detective on parents, inclinations that would later become true through her therapeutic practices.&quot; She later explained that &quot;I didn&#x27;t quite know what I would look for, but I realized a lot went on in families that didn&#x27;t meet the eye.&quot;

In 1929, her mother insisted that the family move from their farm to Milwaukee so that Satir could attend high school. Satir&#x27;s high school years coincided with the Great Depression, and to help her family she took a part-time job and also attended as many courses as she could so that she could graduate early. In 1932, she received her high school diploma and promptly enrolled in Milwaukee State Teachers College (now University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee.) To pay for her education she worked part-time for the Works Projects Administration and for Gimbels Department Store and further supplemented her income by babysitting. She graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in education, and worked as a teacher for a few years.

During her time as a schoolteacher, she recognized that involved and supportive parents not only help students in the classroom but could also heal family dynamics. Satir began meeting and cooperating with the parents of her students and saw the family system as a reflection of the world at large, stating &quot;if we can heal the family, we can heal the world.&quot;

Beginning in 1937, for three summers she took courses at Northwestern University in Chicago. Her interest in families led her to enroll full-time at the University of Chicago School of Social Services Administration where she obtained a master&#x27;s degree in social work. She finished her coursework for her master&#x27;s degree in 1943, and completed her thesis for her degree in 1948.

==Career as a therapist==
After graduating social work school, Satir began working in private practice. She met with her first family in 1951, and by 1955 was working with Illinois Psychiatric Institute, encouraging other therapists to focus on families instead of individual patients. By the end of the decade she had moved to California, where she cofounded the Mental Research Institute (MRI) in Palo Alto, California. MRI received a grant from NIMH in 1962, allowing them to begin the first formal family therapy training program ever offered; Satir was hired as its training director.

Satir&#x27;s skills and views about the important role the family has and its connection to an individual&#x27;s problems and/or healing process led her into becoming a renowned therapist.
One of Satir&#x27;s most novel ideas at the time was that the &quot;presenting issue&quot; or &quot;surface problem&quot; itself was seldom the real problem; rather, how people &quot;coped&quot; with the issue &quot;created&quot; the problem. Satir also offered insights into the particular problems that low self-esteem could cause in relationships. In addition to Satir&#x27;s influence in human sciences, she helped establish organizations with the purpose of educating therapists around the world and granting them with resources to help families and clients.

Long interested in the idea of networking, Satir founded two groups to help individuals find mental health workers or other people who were suffering from similar issues to their own. In 1970, she organized Beautiful People, which later became known as the International Human Learning Resources Network. In 1977 she founded the Avanta Network, which was renamed to the Virginia Satir Global Network in 2010.

Two years later, Satir was appointed to the Steering Committee of the International Family Therapy Association and became a member of the advisory board for the National Council for Self-Esteem.

She has also been recognized with several honorary doctorates, including a 1978 doctorate in Social Sciences from the University of Wisconsin–Madison.

Honors and awards received
* 1976: Awarded Gold Medal of &quot;Outstanding and Consistent Service to Mankind&quot; by the University of Chicago.
* 1978: Awarded honorary doctorate in Social Sciences from the University of Wisconsin–Madison.
* 1982: Selected by the West German Government as one of the twelve most influential leaders in the world today.
* 1985: &quot;Time&quot; magazine quotes a colleague, &quot;She can fill any auditorium in the country&quot;, after her stellar contribution to the Evolution of Psychotherapy Conference in Phoenix, Arizona.

==Work and influence==
Satir&#x27;s entire work was done under the umbrella of &quot;Becoming More Fully Human&quot;. From the possibility of a nurturing primary triad of father, mother, and child she conceived a process of Human Validation. She viewed the reconciliation of families as a way to reconcile the world. As she said: &quot;The family is a microcosm. By knowing how to heal the family, I know how to heal the world.&quot; (Align, 1988, p. 20) With this overview she established professional training groups in the Satir Model in the Middle East, the East Aisa, Western and Eastern Europe, Central and Latin America, and Russia. The Institute for International Connections, Avanta Network, and the International Human Learning Resources Network are concrete examples of teaching people how to connect with one another and then extend the connections. Her world impact could be summed up in her universal mantra: peace within, peace between, peace among.

In the mid-1970s, her work was extensively studied by the co-founders of neuro-linguistic programming (NLP), Richard Bandler and John Grinder, who used it as one of the three fundamental models of NLP. Bandler and Grinder also collaborated with Satir to author &quot;Changing With Families&quot; for Science and Behavior Books, which bore the subtitle &#x27;A Book About Further Education for Being Human&#x27;. The Virginia Satir Global Network, originally named AVANTA by Satir, is an international organization that carries on her work and promotes her approach to family therapy.

In 1984, Satir encouraged marriage and family therapists to shift their focus to relationship education:

Steve Andreas, one of Bandler and Grinder&#x27;s students, wrote &quot;Virginia Satir: The Patterns of Her Magic&quot; (1991) in which he summarized the major patterns of Satir&#x27;s work, and then showed how Satir applied them in a richly annotated verbatim transcript of a videotaped session titled &quot;Forgiving Parents&quot;. In this session, Satir works with a woman who hated her mother, and had difficulty connecting with others as a result. Using a variety of role-plays, including a &quot;family reconstruction&quot;, this woman came to see her mother as her &quot;best friend&quot;, as detailed in a 3½ year follow-up interview.

==Process of Change Model==

Another of Satir&#x27;s work that would have lasting impacts on many fields, including organizational management, is the Process of Change model. This model illustrates how individuals go through change and how they can cope with such change to improve their relationship with each other. The Process of Change Model is divided into four stages: late status quo, chaos, practice and integration, and new status quo.

In the first stage of change, the late status quo, Satir argued the individual is in a predictable environment. Status quo involves a set routine, fixed ideas about the world, and an established behavior. This stage is all about predictability and familiarity.

The second stage of change is chaos. Chaos, as described by Satir, occurs when something in the environment or in the individual changes. This change brings a sense of unfamiliarity and the previously stable routine can no longer be held. In the stage of chaos, here are many strong feelings like sadness, fear, confusion, stress, among others. Satir argues that in the change stage of chaos, therapists must help families and individuals navigate these emotions. 

The third stage of change is practice and integration. In this stage new ideas are being implemented and individuals are figuring out what works best. Like any other skill, it requires patience and practice.

The final stage of change is the new status quo. In this stage, the new ideas, behaviors, and changes are not so new anymore. Individuals tend to acclimate to the change, figure out what works, and become better at their new skill.

Satir points out that this change process is not linear. On some occasions, individuals might have found a temporary coping skill or solution, but if it does not bring the desired results, they might regress to the stage of chaos. For this reason, it is important that therapists are aware of this process to help guide their clients.

==Career as author==
Satir published her first book, &quot;Conjoint Family Therapy&quot;, in 1964, developed from the training manual she wrote for students at MRI. Her reputation grew with each subsequent book, and she travelled the world to speak on her methods. She also became a Diplomate of the Academy of Certified Social Workers and received the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy&#x27;s Distinguished Service Award.

Satir often integrated meditations and poetic writing into both her public workshops and writings. One of her most well-known works, &quot;I Am Me,&quot; was written by Satir in response to a question posed by an angry teenage girl.

<doc id="154331" wikidata="Q314252" url="?curid=154331" title="Gregory Bateson">
<text>Gregory Bateson (9 May 1904 – 4 July 1980) was an English anthropologist, social scientist, linguist, visual anthropologist, semiotician, and cyberneticist whose work intersected that of many other fields. His writings include &quot;Steps to an Ecology of Mind&quot; (1972) and &quot;Mind and Nature&quot; (1979).

In Palo Alto, California, Bateson and in these days his non-colleagues developed the double-bind theory of schizophrenia.

Bateson&#x27;s interest in systems theory forms a thread running through his work. He was one of the original members of the core group of the Macy conferences in Cybernetics (1941–1960), and the later set on Group Processes (1954–1960), where he represented the social and behavioral sciences. He was interested in the relationship of these fields to epistemology. His association with the editor and author Stewart Brand helped widen his influence.

== Early life and education ==
Bateson was born in Grantchester in Cambridgeshire, England, on 9 May 1904. He was the third and youngest son of (Caroline) Beatrice Durham and the distinguished geneticist William Bateson. He was named Gregory after Gregor Mendel, the Austrian monk who founded the modern science of genetics.

The younger Bateson attended Charterhouse School from 1917 to 1921, obtained a Bachelor of Arts in biology at St. John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, in 1925, and continued at Cambridge from 1927 to 1929.

According to Lipset (1982), Bateson&#x27;s life was greatly affected by the death of his two brothers. John Bateson (1898–1918), the eldest of the three, was killed in World War I. Martin Bateson (1900–1922), the second brother, was then expected to follow in his father&#x27;s footsteps as a scientist, but came into conflict with his father over his ambition to become a poet and playwright. The resulting stress, combined with a disappointment in love, resulted in Martin&#x27;s public suicide by gunshot under the statue of Anteros in Piccadilly Circus on 22 April 1922, which was John&#x27;s birthday. After this event, which transformed a private family tragedy into a public scandal, the parents&#x27; ambitious expectations fell on Gregory.

==Career==
In 1928, Bateson lectured in linguistics at the University of Sydney. 
From 1931 to 1937, he was a Fellow of St. John&#x27;s College, Cambridge. He spent the years before World War II in the South Pacific in New Guinea and Bali doing anthropology.

In the 1940s, he helped extend systems theory and cybernetics to the social and behavioral sciences.
Although initially reluctant to join the intelligence services, Bateson served in the OSS during World War II along with dozens of other anthropologists. He was stationed in the same offices as Julia Child (then Julia McWilliams), Paul Cushing Child, and others. He spent much of the war designing &#x27;black propaganda&#x27; radio broadcasts. He was deployed on covert operations in Burma and Thailand, and worked in China, India, and Ceylon as well. Bateson used his theory of schismogenesis to help foster discord among enemy fighters. He was upset by his wartime experience and disagreed with his wife over whether science should be applied to social planning or used only to foster understanding rather than action.

In Palo Alto, California, Bateson developed the double-bind theory, together with his non-colleagues Donald Jackson, Jay Haley and John H. Weakland, also known as the &quot;Bateson Project&quot; (1953–1963).

In 1956, he became a naturalised citizen of the United States.

Bateson was one of the original members of the core group of the Macy conferences in cybernetics (1941–1960), and the later set on Group Processes (1954–1960), where he represented the social and behavioral sciences.

In the 1970s, he taught at the Humanistic Psychology Institute in San Francisco, which was renamed the Saybrook University, and in 1972 joined the faculty of Kresge College at the University of California, Santa Cruz.

In 1976, he was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. 
California Governor Jerry Brown appointed him to the Regents of the University of California, a position he held until his death, although he resigned from the Special Research Projects committee in 1979 in opposition to the university&#x27;s work on nuclear weapons.

Bateson spent the last decade of his life developing a &quot;meta-science&quot; of epistemology to bring together the various early forms of systems theory developed in different fields of science.

==Personal life==
From 1936 until 1950, he was married to American cultural anthropologist Margaret Mead. He applied his knowledge to the war effort before moving to the United States. Bateson and Mead had a daughter, Mary Catherine Bateson (1939–2021), who also became an anthropologist. Bateson separated from Mead in 1947, and they were divorced in 1950. In 1951, he married Elizabeth &quot;Betty&quot; Sumner, the daughter of the Episcopalian Bishop of Oregon, Walter Taylor Sumner. They had a son, John Sumner Bateson (1951–2015), as well as twins who died shortly after birth in 1953. Bateson and Sumner were divorced in 1957, after which Bateson was married a third time, to therapist and social worker Lois Cammack (born 1928), in 1961. They had one daughter, Nora Bateson (born 1969).

Bateson was a lifelong atheist, as his family had been for several generations. He was a member of William Irwin Thompson&#x27;s esoteric Lindisfarne Association.

Bateson died on July 4, 1980, at age 76, in the guest house of the San Francisco Zen Center.
The 2014 novel &quot;Euphoria&quot; by Lily King is a fictionalized account of Bateson&#x27;s relationships with Mead and Reo Fortune in pre-WWII New Guinea.

==Philosophy==
Where others might see a set of inexplicable details, Bateson perceived simple relationships. In &quot;From Versailles to Cybernetics,&quot; Bateson argues that the history of the twentieth century can be perceived as the history of a malfunctioning relationship. In his view, the Treaty of Versailles exemplifies a whole pattern of human relationships based on betrayal and hate. He therefore claims that the Treaty of Versailles and the development of cybernetics—which for him represented the possibility of &quot;improved&quot; relationships—are the only two anthropologically important events of the twentieth century.

== Work ==

=== New Guinea ===
Bateson&#x27;s beginning years as an anthropologist were spent floundering, lost without a specific objective in mind. He began in 1927 with a trip to New Guinea, spurred by his mentor A. C. Haddon. His goal, as suggested by Haddon, was to explore the effects of contact between the Sepik natives and whites. Unfortunately for Bateson, his time spent with the Baining of New Guinea was halted and difficult. The Baining were not particularly accommodating of his research, and he missed out on many communal activities. They were also not inclined to share their religious practices with him. He left the Baining frustrated. Next, he set out to study the Sulka, belonging to another native population of New Guinea. Although the Sulka were very different from the Baining and their culture was more easily observed, he felt their culture was dying, which left him dispirited and discouraged.

He experienced more success with the Iatmul people, an indigenous people living along New Guinea&#x27;s Sepik River. The observations he made among the Iatmul people allowed him to develop his concept of schismogenesis. In his 1936 book &quot;Naven&quot; he defined the term, based on his Iatmul fieldwork, as &quot;a process of differentiation in the norms of individual behaviour resulting from cumulative interaction between individuals&quot; (p. 175). The book was named after the &#x27;naven&#x27; rite, an honorific ceremony among the Iatmul, still continued today, that celebrates first-time cultural achievements. The ceremony entails behaviours that are otherwise forbidden in everyday social life. For example, men and women reverse and exaggerate gender roles; men dress in women&#x27;s skirts, and women dress in men&#x27;s attire and ornaments. Additionally, some women smear mud in the faces of other relatives, beat them with sticks, and hurl bawdy insults. Mothers may drop to the ground so their celebrated &#x27;child&#x27; walks over them. And during a male rite, a mother&#x27;s brother may slide his buttocks down the leg of his honoured sister&#x27;s son, a complex gesture of masculine birthing, pride, and insult, rarely performed before women, that brings the honoured sister&#x27;s son to tears. Bateson suggested the influence of a circular system of causation, and proposed that women watched:

for the spectacular performances of the men, and there can be no reasonable doubt that the presence of an audience is a very important factor in shaping the men&#x27;s behavior. In fact, it is probable that the men are more exhibitionistic because the women admire their performances. Conversely, there can be no doubt that the spectacular behavior is a stimulus which summons the audience together, promoting in the women the appropriate … behavior.

In short, the behaviour of person X affects person Y, and the reaction of person Y to person X&#x27;s behaviour will then affect person X&#x27;s behaviour, which in turn will affect person Y, and so on. Bateson called this the &quot;vicious circle.&quot; He then discerned two models of schismogenesis: symmetrical and complementary. Symmetrical relationships are those in which the two parties are equals, competitors, such as in sports. Complementary relationships feature an unequal balance, such as dominance-submission (parent-child), or exhibitionism-spectatorship (performer-audience). Bateson&#x27;s experiences with the Iatmul led him to publish a book in 1936 titled &quot;Naven: A Survey of the Problems Suggested by a Composite Picture of the Culture of a New Guinea Tribe Drawn from Three Points of View&quot; (Cambridge University Press). The book proved to be a watershed in anthropology and modern social science.

Until Bateson published &quot;Naven,&quot; most anthropologists assumed a realist approach to studying culture, in which one simply described social reality. Bateson&#x27;s book argued that this approach was naive, since an anthropologist&#x27;s account of a culture was always and fundamentally shaped by whatever theory the anthropologist employed to define and analyse the data. To think otherwise, stated Bateson, was to be guilty of what Alfred North Whitehead called the &quot;fallacy of misplaced concreteness.&quot; There was no singular or self-evident way to understand the Iatmul naven rite. Instead, Bateson analysed the rite from three unique points of view: sociological, ethological, and eidological. The book, then, was not a presentation of anthropological analysis but an epistemological account that explored the nature of anthropological analysis itself.

The sociological point of view sought to identify how the ritual helped bring about social integration. In the 1930s, most anthropologists understood marriage rules to regularly ensure that social groups renewed their alliances. But Iatmul, argued Bateson, had contradictory marriage rules. Marriage, in other words, could not guarantee that a marriage between two clans would at some definite point in the future recur. Instead, Bateson continued, the naven rite filled this function by regularly ensuring exchanges of food, valuables, and sentiment between mothers&#x27; brothers and their sisters&#x27; children, or between separate lineages. Naven, from this angle, held together the different social groups of each village into a unified whole.

The ethological point of view interpreted the ritual in terms of the conventional emotions associated with normative male and female behaviour, which Bateson called ethos. In Iatmul culture, observed by Bateson, men and women lived different emotional lives. For example, women were rather submissive and took delight in the achievements of others; men were fiercely competitive and flamboyant. During the ritual, however, men celebrated the achievements of their nieces and nephews while women were given a ritual license to act raucously. In effect, naven allowed men and women to experience momentarily the emotional lives of each other, thereby to achieve a level of psychological integration.

The third and final point of view, the eidological, was the least successful. Here Bateson endeavoured to correlate the organisational structure of the naven ceremony with the habitual patterns of Iatmul thought. Much later, Bateson would harness the very same idea in the development of the double-bind theory of schizophrenia.

In the Epilogue to the book, Bateson was clear: &quot;The writing of this book has been an experiment, or rather a series of experiments, in methods of thinking about anthropological material.&quot; That is to say, his overall point was not to describe Iatmul culture of the naven ceremony but to explore how different modes of analysis, using different premises and analytic frameworks, could lead to different explanations of the same sociocultural phenomenon. Not only did Bateson&#x27;s approach re-shape fundamentally the anthropological approach to culture, but the naven rite itself has remained a locus classicus in the discipline. In fact, the meaning of the ritual continues to inspire anthropological analysis.

=== Bali===

From March 1936 until February 1938, Bateson traveled to Bali with his new wife Margaret Mead to study the people of the village of Bajoeng Gede. Here, Lipset states, &quot;in the short history of ethnographic fieldwork, film was used both on a large scale and as the primary research tool.&quot; Bateson took 25,000 photographs of their Balinese subjects.

He discovered that the people of Bajoeng Gede raised their children very unlike children raised in Western societies. Instead of attention being paid to a child who was displaying a climax of emotion (love or anger), Balinese mothers would ignore them. Bateson notes, &quot;The child responds to [a mother&#x27;s] advances with either affection or temper, but the response falls into a vacuum. In Western cultures, such sequences lead to small climaxes of love or anger, but not so in Bali. At the moment when a child throws its arms around the mother&#x27;s neck or bursts into tears, the mother&#x27;s attention wanders&quot;. This model of stimulation and refusal was also seen in other areas of the culture. Bateson later described the style of Balinese relations as stasis instead of schismogenesis. Their interactions were &quot;muted&quot; and did not follow the schismogenetic process because they did not often escalate competition, dominance, or submission.

===New Guinea, 1938===
In 1938, Bateson and Mead returned to the Sepik River, and settled in the village of Tambunum, where Bateson had spent three days in the 1920s. Their aim to replicate the Balinese project on the relationship between child-raising and temperament, and between conventions of the body – such as pose, grimace, holding infants, facial expressions, etc. – reflected wider cultural themes and values. Bateson snapped some 10,000 black and white photographs, and Mead typed thousands of pages of fieldnotes. But Bateson and Mead never published anything substantial from this research.

Bateson&#x27;s encounter with Mead on the Sepik river (Chapter 16) and their life together in Bali (Chapter 17) are described in Mead&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Blackberry Winter: My Earlier Years&quot; (Angus and Robertson. London. 1973). Their daughter Catherine&#x27;s birth in New York on 8 December 1939 is recounted in Chapter 18.

=== Double bind theory of schizophrenia ===

In 1956 in Palo Alto, Bateson and his colleagues Donald Jackson, Jay Haley, and John Weakland articulated a related theory of schizophrenia stemming from double bind situations. The double bind refers to a communication paradox described first in families with a schizophrenic member. The first place where double binds were described (though not named as such) was according to Bateson, in Samuel Butler&#x27;s &quot;The Way of All Flesh&quot; (a semi-autobiographical novel about Victorian hypocrisy and cover-up).

Full double bind requires several conditions to be met:

# The victim of double bind receives contradictory injunctions or emotional messages on different levels of communication (for example, love is expressed by words, and hate or detachment by nonverbal behaviour; or a child is encouraged to speak freely, but criticised or silenced whenever he or she actually does so).
# No metacommunication is possible – for example, asking which of the two messages is valid or describing the communication as making no sense.
# The victim cannot leave the communication field.
# Failing to fulfill the contradictory injunctions is punished (for example, by withdrawal of love).

The strange behaviour and speech of schizophrenics were explained by Bateson et al. as an expression of this paradoxical situation, and were seen in fact as an adaptive response, which should be valued as a cathartic and transformative experience.

The double bind was originally presented (probably mainly under the influence of Bateson&#x27;s psychiatric co-workers) as an explanation of part of the etiology of schizophrenia. Currently, it is considered to be a more important as an example of Bateson&#x27;s approach to the complexities of communication, which is what he understood it to be.

=== The role of somatic change in evolution ===
Bateson writes about how the actual physical changes in the body occur within evolutionary processes. He describes this through the introduction of the concept of &quot;economics of flexibility&quot;. In his conclusion he makes seven statements or theoretical positions which may be supported by his ideology.

The first is the idea that although environmental stresses have theoretically been believed to guide or dictate the changes in the (physical body), the introduction of new stresses does not automatically result in the physical changes necessary for survival as suggested by original evolutionary theory. In fact, the introduction of these stresses can greatly weaken the organism. An example that he gives is the sheltering of a sick person from the weather or the fact that someone who works in an office would have a hard time working as a rock climber and vice versa. The second position states that &quot;the economics of flexibility has a logical structure-each successive demand upon flexibility fractioning the set of available possibilities&quot;. This means that theoretically speaking each demand or variable creates a new set of possibilities. Bateson&#x27;s third conclusion is &quot;that the genotypic change commonly makes demand upon the adjustive ability of the soma&quot;. This, he states, is the commonly held belief among biologists although there is no evidence to support the claim. Added demands are made on the soma by sequential genotypic modifications in the fourth position. Through this he suggests the following three expectations:

# The idea that organisms that have been through recent modifications will be delicate.
# The belief that these organisms will become progressively harmful or dangerous.
# That over time these new &quot;breeds&quot; will become more resistant to the stresses of the environment and changes in genetic traits.

The fifth theoretical position which Bateson believes is supported by his data is that characteristics within an organism that have been modified due to environmental stresses may coincide with genetically determined attributes. His sixth position is that it takes less economic flexibility to create somatic change than it does to cause a genotypic modification. The seventh and final theory he believes to be supported is the idea that, on rare occasions there will be populations whose changes will not be in accordance with the thesis presented within this paper. According to Bateson, none of these positions (at the time) could be tested but he called for the creation of a test which could possibly prove or disprove the theoretical positions suggested within.

===Ecological anthropology and cybernetics===
In his book &quot;Steps to an Ecology of Mind&quot;, Bateson applied cybernetics to the field of ecological anthropology and the concept of homeostasis. He saw the world as a series of systems containing those of individuals, societies and ecosystems. Within each system is found competition and dependency. Each of these systems has adaptive changes which depend upon feedback loops to control balance by changing multiple variables. Bateson believed that these self-correcting systems were conservative by controlling exponential slippage. He saw the natural ecological system as innately good as long as it was allowed to maintain homeostasis and that the key unit of survival in evolution was an organism and its environment.

Bateson also viewed that all three systems of the individual, society and ecosystem were all together a part of one supreme cybernetic system that controls everything instead of just interacting systems. This supreme cybernetic system is beyond the self of the individual and could be equated to what many people refer to as God, though Bateson referred to it as Mind. While Mind is a cybernetic system, it can only be distinguished as a whole and not parts. Bateson felt Mind was immanent in the messages and pathways of the supreme cybernetic system. He saw the root of the system collapse as a result of Occidental or Western epistemology. According to Bateson, consciousness is the bridge between the cybernetic networks of individuals, society and ecology and the mismatch between the systems due to improper understanding will result in the degradation of the entire supreme cybernetic system or Mind. Bateson thought that consciousness as developed through Occidental epistemology was at direct odds with Mind.

At the heart of the matter is scientific hubris. Bateson argues that Occidental epistemology perpetuates a system of understanding which is purpose or means-to-an-end driven. Purpose controls attention and narrows perception, thus limiting what comes into consciousness and therefore limiting the amount of wisdom that can be generated from the perception. Additionally, Occidental epistemology propagates the false notion that man exists outside Mind and this leads man to believe in what Bateson calls the philosophy of control based upon false knowledge.

Bateson presents Occidental epistemology as a method of thinking that leads to a mindset in which man exerts an autocratic rule over all cybernetic systems. In exerting his autocratic rule man changes the environment to suit him and in doing so he unbalances the natural cybernetic system of controlled competition and mutual dependency. The purpose-driven accumulation of knowledge ignores the supreme cybernetic system and leads to the eventual breakdown of the entire system. Bateson claims that man will never be able to control the whole system because it does not operate in a linear fashion and if man creates his own rules for the system, he opens himself up to becoming a slave to the self-made system due to the non-linear nature of cybernetics. Lastly, man&#x27;s technological prowess combined with his scientific hubris gives him the potential to irrevocably damage and destroy the supreme cybernetic system, instead of just disrupting the system temporally until the system can self-correct.

Bateson argues for a position of humility and acceptance of the natural cybernetic system instead of scientific arrogance as a solution. He believes that humility can come about by abandoning the view of operating through consciousness alone. Consciousness is only one way in which to obtain knowledge and without complete knowledge of the entire cybernetic system disaster is inevitable. The limited conscious must be combined with the unconscious in a complete synthesis. Only when thought and emotion are combined in whole is man able to obtain complete knowledge. He believed that religion and art are some of the few areas in which a man acts as a whole individual in complete consciousness. By acting with this greater wisdom of the supreme cybernetic system as a whole man can change his relationship to Mind from one of schism, in which he is endlessly tied up in constant competition, to one of complementarity. Bateson argues for a culture that promotes the most general wisdom and is able to flexibly change within the supreme cybernetic system.

=== Other terms used by Bateson ===
*Abductive Process. Originally coined by American philosopher/logician Charles Sanders Peirce, abduction refers to the process by which scientific hypotheses are generated (along with induction and deduction). Bateson, however, thought of &quot;abductive process&quot; very differently. For Bateson, abductive process is the way one context becomes a description of another: &quot;Every abduction may be seen as a double or multiple description of some object or event or sequence.&quot; Bateson often used abductive process as a way to compare patterns of relationship and their symmetry or asymmetry (as in, for example, comparative anatomy), especially in complex organic (or mental) systems.
*Conscious Purpose. In a series of papers and talks during the late 1960s, Bateson formulated an argument that there was a deep-seated mismatch between the complex, cybernetic, self-corrective loop processes of nature and the linear, causal, selective problem-solving that characterizes much human activity. Bateson referred to this as &quot;conscious purpose&quot; – the tendency to &quot;follow the shortest logical or causal path&quot; to addressing a problem, or in reaching a desired goal.
*Creatura and Pleroma. Borrowed from Carl Jung who applied these gnostic terms in his &quot;Seven Sermons To the Dead&quot;. Like the Hindu term maya, the basic idea captured in this distinction is that meaning and organisation are projected onto the world. Pleroma refers to the non-living world that is undifferentiated by subjectivity; Creatura for the living world, subject to perceptual difference, distinction, and information.
*Criteria of Mental Process (i.e. Mind)
#A mind is an aggregate of interacting parts or components.
#The interaction between parts of the mind is triggered by difference…
#Mental process requires collateral energy.
#Mental process requires circular (or more complex) chains of determination.
#In the mental process the effects of difference are to be regarded as transforms (that is, coded versions) of the difference which preceded them.
#The description and classification of these processes of transformation disclose a hierarchy of logical types immanent in the phenomena.

*. A term he coined in the 1940s referring to the organisation of learning, or learning to learn:
* Information – Bateson defined information as &quot;a difference which makes a difference.&quot; This definition, however, is taken out of its context and lacks Bateson&#x27;s reference to the requirement of energy to make a difference, and his definition of a difference as a matter that can be abstract also. For Bateson, information in fact mediated Alfred Korzybski&#x27;s map–territory relation, and thereby resolved, according to Bateson, the mind-body problem.
*Schismogenesis – the emergence of divisions within social groups.

=== Continuing extensions of his work ===
In 1984, his daughter Mary Catherine Bateson published a joint biography of her parents (Bateson and Margaret Mead).
His other daughter the filmmaker Nora Bateson released &quot;An Ecology of Mind&quot;, a documentary that premiered at the Vancouver International Film Festival. This film was selected as the audience favourite with the &quot;Morton Marcus Documentary Feature Award&quot; at the 2011 Santa Cruz Film Festival, and honoured with the 2011 &quot;John Culkin Award for Outstanding Praxis in the Field of Media Ecology&quot; by the Media Ecology Association.

The Bateson Idea Group (BIG) initiated a web presence in October 2010. The group collaborated with the American Society for Cybernetics for a joint meeting in July 2012 at the Asilomar Conference Grounds in California.

The modern view of artificial intelligence based on social machines has deep links to Bateson&#x27;s ecological perspectives of intelligence.

<text>Air Malta, stylized as airmalta, was a Maltese airline headquartered in Luqa and based at Malta International Airport. It operated services as the country&#x27;s flag carrier to destinations in Europe, the Middle East and North Africa. Air Malta ceased operations on 30 March 2024 and was replaced on the next day with a new flag carrier, KM Malta Airlines.

==History==
===Early years===
Shortly after the Second World War, several small private airlines were formed in Malta. Amongst these were The Malta Instone Airline, BAS (Malta) Ltd, and Malta Airlines. In 1947, the former two companies merged to form Air Malta Ltd in fierce competition with the latter. Eventually, in 1951 Malta Airlines absorbed the operations of Air Malta Ltd and continued operating through an agreement with BEA until 1973. The owners of Air Malta Ltd used their real estate, staff, and equipment to set up a ground handling company called MAS, Malta Aviation Services.

In the early 1970s, the Maltese government appointed Albert Mizzi as chairman of the airline and made a call for an international airline partner to help set up an airline and Pakistan&#x27;s flag carrier PIA was selected for this purpose. The name chosen for the new airline was similar to that of its forerunner, Air Malta Co Ltd, and was established on 31 March 1973. BEA was chartered to continue its Malta operations, this time for Air Malta, until Air Malta&#x27;s first flight on 1 April 1974. The government took over both Malta Airlines and Malta Aviation Services and the private owners were given a shareholding in Air Malta Co. Ltd.

Air Malta started operations, with two wet leased Boeing 720Bs from Pakistan International Airlines that served Rome, Tripoli, London, Manchester, Frankfurt, Dublin for holiday charters, as well as Paris from Malta. It later bought three more Boeing 720Bs and bought the original two.

In 1981, three Boeing 737-200s were wet-leased, which were so successful that in 1983, three new fully owned Boeing 737-200s were delivered. In 1986, Air Malta bought three new Boeing 737-200s, and in 1987 ordered its first Airbus A320. In 1989, Air Malta exercised an option for one more A320, and in 1992, three more Boeing 737-300s were ordered and four Avro RJ70s were ordered for routes to Catania and Palermo, and to new destinations such as Tunis and Monastir.

After the opening of Malta International Airport in 1992, Air Malta created &quot;CargoSystems&quot;, which includes the transportation of cargo on Air Malta planes. In 1994, Air Malta inaugurated a cargo center at the airport. It was also during this time that a codesharing agreement with Trans World Airlines began.

===21st century developments===

Between 2002 and 2007, Air Malta embarked upon a fleet replacement programme, opting to change all aircraft to Airbus A319s and A320s. The last aircraft in this order, an A320, was delivered on 22 March 2007, and the fleet has not been replaced since.

Air Malta had around 190 interline ticketing agreements with other IATA airlines. According to the Association of European Airlines quarterly review of May 2006, Air Malta was the airline that lost the least amount of passenger baggage. The amount of baggage lost in the first quarter of 2006 was 4.1 bags massing per 1000 passengers.

In winter, the airline often leases out aircraft to maximize earnings during the low season. In September 2007, for instance, Air Malta made two agreements with Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways by which Air Malta wet-leased 2 Airbus aircraft to Etihad Airways for the winter period starting 1 September 2007, and provided operational support on another Airbus A320 aircraft leased by Etihad Airways. In January and February 2009 Air Malta wet-leased an A320 to Sky Airline of Chile. From 2011 to 2014 Air Malta wet-leased another A320 to Sky Airline.

In 2012 Air Malta underwent a re-branding process, which caused some controversy as the titles on aircraft and signage only say Malta, omitting the word &quot;Air&quot;. The airline insisted this was not a name change, and the full name of the airline remains Air Malta. Additionally, the titles on the engines still say &quot;airmalta.com&quot;. The first plane to show off the new colours was the Airbus A320-200 &quot;9H-AEN&quot; at the Malta International Airshow 2012. On the second and last day of the show the A320 and a Spitfire performed a flypast as the closing act.

As a commemoration of the airline&#x27;s 40 years of operation, the airline painted one of its aircraft, &quot;9H-AEI&quot;, an A320-200, in retro colours, depicting the livery used on the Boeing 720Bs. The 9H-AEI aircraft debuted on April 16, 2014.

In June 2017, the newly appointed Minister for Tourism announced the restructuring of Air Malta. This was also confirmed by the newly appointed chairman. Air Malta then opened a number of new routes, including Tunis, Malaga (reduced to seasonal in 2019), Comiso (terminated after summer 2018), Kyiv, Lisbon, Casablanca, Southend (terminated in 2019) and Cagliari (subsequently reduced to June–September only). Manchester and Frankfurt were restarted after being briefly terminated.

In March 2019, the airline announced that it had made a profit of €1.2 million in the fiscal year of 2018. This profit was the first the airline has made in 18 years.

===Closure and replacement===

In August 2022, the Maltese government announced it would dissolve Air Malta should the European Union deny further financial state aid to the airline. It would then relocate its assets to a succeeding carrier. Shortly after, the decision regarding the airline&#x27;s future had been delayed to the end of 2022; however, the route network and frequencies saw extensive cuts by October 2022, including the termination of several destinations.

On 18 April 2023, Chairman David Curmi announced that the European Commission declined to give permission to the Maltese government to inject 290 million euros of state aid into the airline. In 2023, Air Malta incorporated its aircraft with a new livery with red and dark red on the back of the plane. This livery would be subsequently used by the new airline. Also, a competitive process was to be launched for the new airline to acquire the tender for the Air Malta branding which is owned by a government owned company, IP Holdings, which was set up by former minister Konrad Mizzi to transfer assets to show that the company earned a profit in 2018.

On 2 October 2023, the Maltese government announced the closure of Air Malta for 30 March 2024, replaced by KM Malta Airlines the following day.

*On 21 December 1988, Air Malta Flight 180 played an unintentional role when an unaccompanied baggage containing a timed explosive was checked onto the flight out of Luqa Airport to Frankfurt Airport, where it was loaded as interline baggage to the first leg of Pan Am Flight 103 from Frankfurt to London-Heathrow Airport. The bomb in the unaccompanied baggage then exploded on Pan Am 103&#x27;s transatlantic leg while it was flying over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing a total of 270 people.
*On 9 June 1997, Air Malta Flight 830, a Boeing 737-200, was hijacked by two Turks on a flight from Malta to Istanbul, Turkey. They demanded the release of Mehmet Ali Ağca. The hijack ended in Cologne, Germany, with no casualties amongst the 74 passengers and 6 crew.
*On 19 January 2004, Air Malta Flight 642, an Airbus A320, hit a pylon at Malta International Airport while taxiing prior to takeoff. There were no injuries among the crew and 27 passengers on board, while damage to the aicraft&#x27;s wing amounted to around $2 million.

In addition, on 11 September 1990 a Faucett Perú Boeing 727 which had been leased to Air Malta disappeared in the Atlantic Ocean while it was being ferried back to Peru from Malta upon the end of its lease, with 16 presumed fatalities.

<text>Kuurne () is a municipality located in the Belgian province of West Flanders. The municipality comprises only the town of Kuurne proper. On January 1, 2006, Kuurne had a total population of 12,591. The total area is 10.01 km2 which gives a population density of 1258 inhabitants per km2. The Leie functions as a natural border between Kuurne and Harelbeke.

Inhabitants from Kuurne are nicknamed &#x27;donkeys&#x27;. This is said to be a term of derision given to them by the people of nearby Kortrijk because traders from Kuurne habitually set off for the Kortrijk market at an early hour, their ass-drawn carts laden with vegetables. Awoken by the rattle of the cart wheels and the braying of the asses, the people of Kortrijk exclaimed: &quot;It&#x27;s those asses from Kuurne again!&quot;

An alternative, more legendary explanation originates from the tale of a priest who had to hold a funeral on Ash Wednesday. He asked the sacrister to take over his regular service, but the latter couldn&#x27;t remember the Latin words &quot;Memento, homo, quia pulvis es, et in pulverem reverteris&quot; (Remember, man, that dust thou art, and unto dust thou shalt return), which are to be proclaimed while applying a cross of ash to the foreheads of the churchgoers. Later the priest spoke to him in exasperation, saying: &quot;You were born an ass, and you will die an ass!&quot; &quot;Aha,&quot; said the sacrister, &quot;I&#x27;ll remember that!&quot; and so saying, he continued giving the people of Kuurne their crosses of ash.

The best-known donkey in Kuurne is &#x27;Ambroos&#x27; (Ambrose), a larger-than-life and somewhat stylised statue in front of the town hall. The winner of the annual pro road cycling race Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne received a big bouquet and a soft toy version of &#x27;Ambroos&#x27; to wave from the stage.

<text>Menen (; ; or ) is a city and municipality located in the Belgian province of West Flanders. The municipality comprises the city of Menen proper and the towns of Lauwe and Rekkem. The city is situated on the French/Belgian border. On January 1, 2006, Menen had a total population of 32,413. The total area is 33.07 km2 which gives a population density of 980 inhabitants per km2.

The city of Menen gives its name to the Menin Gate in Ypres, which is a monument to those killed in World War I. The gate is so called as the road from that gate is the road to Menen.

The town hall of Menen, with its large belfry, was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1999 as part of the Belfries of Belgium and France site, because of its civic importance and architecture.

==History==
Menen&#x27;s position near the French border led to many sieges in the history of the city. There were as many as 22 sieges between 1579 and 1830.

The city was part of France between 1668 and 1713. Vauban turned Menen into a model-fortification (1679–1689).

The city was besieged and taken by the Duke of Marlborough&#x27;s allied Army in August 1706. Between 1744 and 1748, it was again under French rule after the Siege of Menin (1744). There was a devastating fire in 1750, that almost completely destroyed the city. During the Flanders Campaign of the Wars of the French Revolution the city changed hands several times. It was also the scene of a battle in September 1793.

Menen was a barrier town for the Dutch Republic against France from 1715 to 1781.

In 2013, the city drew international attention by forbidding its civil servants to speak French with francophones. The mayor, , ordered that, if necessary, the communication should be in sign language.

==Culture==
A new art museum, the Stadsmuseum ’t Schippershof, opened in 1999, holds many works by Menen-born sculptor Yvonne Serruys. Opposite &#x27;t Schippershof there is the cultural center CC De Steiger that houses the city&#x27;s theater, public library and a concert space for live music.

<text>Waregem (; ), sometimes known by the older spelling of Waereghem, is a municipality and city located in the Belgian province of West Flanders. The municipality lies in the valley of the river Leie, between Kortrijk and Ghent. It is part of the arrondissement of Kortrijk and comprises the towns of Beveren, Desselgem, Sint-Eloois-Vijve and Waregem proper. On January 1, 2019, Waregem had a total population of 38,260. The total area is 44.34 km² which gives a population density of 863 inhabitants per km².

==History==

===Origins===
The first inhabitants of this forested region settled along the Leie well before Roman times. Bronze coins and artifacts associated with the Gallo-Roman culture show extensive activity in this area in the first centuries of our era. This is not surprising given the fact that Sint-Eloois-Vijve stood at the intersection of two important Roman roads: Cassel-Tongeren and Bavai-Oudenburg. The name of the current municipality refers to a certain “Waro” clan or tribe, possibly dating from the Frankish period.

===Middle Ages===
In the 10th century, most of Waregem&#x27;s territory was given as a grant to the St Peter Abbey in Ghent. The local administrative center used by the Benedictines along the Leie River can still be seen today and is still known as the &quot;Munkenhof.&quot; At the end of the century, Baldwin IV, Count of Flanders, made this area the base from which he could advance against Kortrijk. During the following centuries, the medieval feudal system allowed the land to be progressively parceled out to landowners from places as far as Dendermonde and Tournai. At that time, like in the rest of Flanders, most of the population consisted of farmers, spinners and weavers. Tax documents from the 13th century attest to the strong economic activity of the time. Waregem&#x27;s attempt in 1635 at obtaining rights to hold its own market was opposed by the neighbouring towns. A Saturday market was finally approved by Joseph II of Austria in 1784.

===From the 18th century until today===
Much of the medieval land ownership structure remained unchanged until the end of the 18th century, when the town counted some 4,500 inhabitants. The construction of the main roadway between Kortrijk and Ghent made possible the building of an important coaching inn on the territory of Waregem, where horses could be hired. The French Revolution brought severe religious restrictions in its wake; it also gave the region a modern administrative system and more political autonomy. During the 19th century, the old textile economy went into decline. The proximity of the Leie River, however, was a boon for Waregem, as its flax industry drove the local economy until well into the 20th century. Waregem earned its official city title on January 1, 2000.

==Main sights==
* The Flanders Field American Cemetery and Memorial is the smallest World War I American cemetery in Europe and the only one in Belgium. It is located on the southeast edge of town and is the burial place for 368 American military who died during the liberation of Belgium in World War I. The chapel is inscribed with the names of 43 Missing in Action whose remains were never recovered or identified.
* The Gaverbeekhippodroom is one of the few hippodromes in Belgium.

==Sports and events==

*Waregem is well known for its annual horse races at the local hippodrome, including the Great Flanders Steeple Chase, which takes place the first Tuesday after the last Sunday of August. In the local language this week-long event, dating from 1847, is known as the &quot;Waregem Koerse.&quot;
*Waregem is notable in the UK for a prominent position in the song; &quot;Ordinary to Enschede&quot; by Half Man Half Biscuit.
*Waregem is the hometown of former football team K.S.V. Waregem and present team S.V. Zulte-Waregem.
*The town is the finish of the classic Dwars door Vlaanderen () road bicycle race. It also was the departure of the third stage of the 2007 Tour de France, going from Waregem to Compiègne.
*The Cyclocross Masters, the final round of the cyclo-cross season, has been hosted by Waregem since 2013.
*Waregem is home to rugbyclub Waereghem.

<text>Wevelgem () is a municipality located in the Belgian province of West Flanders. The municipality comprises the towns of Gullegem, Moorsele and Wevelgem proper. On January 1, 2006, Wevelgem had a total population of 31,020. The total area is 38.76 km2 which gives a population density of 800 inhabitants per km2.

Wevelgem is accessible by road (E403 – A19 – R8), by boat (De Leie), by air (Kortrijk-Wevelgem International Airport) or by train at Wevelgem railway station.

Wevelgem is known for the annual Gent–Wevelgem bicycle road race which finishes in the town.

== History ==
The earliest known mention dates from 1197. Wevelgem was home to the Cistercian Guldenberg Abbey in the 13th–14th centuries, which owned grain mills in various locations. From c. 1278 to 1310, abbess Ida was in charge, though Marc Brion lists it as an abbey for men.

In the old days, the river De Leie was important for Wevelgem. The people used the river to soak flax, before they processed it in one of the many flax factories in Wevelgem. That is also the reason De Leie got the nickname &quot;The Golden River&quot;, referring to the colour of the flax. Because selling flax was lucrative, many people came to Wevelgem and stayed there for many generations. Nowadays, the cultivation of flax is less important, but some factories still process it.

During the First World War, the Germans constructed an airport. The airport still exists and is now used for private purposes. Also remaining is the German Military cemetery, which is also partly situated in Menen. There are 47,864 soldiers buried there, who all died during WW1. This makes the cemetery the biggest German cemetery in Belgium. Across the cemetery, there used to be a (fake) airport, with wooden planes to mislead the enemy; there are still remains of the airport consisting of a big bunker and a small bunker near the railway. The bridge that connects Lauwe to Wevelgem was destroyed during the Second World War and was rebuilt later.

<doc id="154349" wikidata="Q777717" url="?curid=154349" title="Diabetic coma">
<text>Diabetic coma is a life-threatening but reversible form of coma found in people with diabetes mellitus.

Three different types of diabetic coma are identified:

#Severe low blood sugar in a diabetic person
#Diabetic ketoacidosis (usually type 1) advanced enough to result in unconsciousness from a combination of a severely increased blood sugar level, dehydration and shock, and exhaustion
#Hyperosmolar nonketotic coma (usually type 2) in which an extremely high blood sugar level and dehydration alone are sufficient to cause unconsciousness.

In most medical contexts, the term diabetic coma refers to the diagnostical dilemma posed when a physician is confronted with an unconscious patient about whom nothing is known except that they have diabetes. An example might be a physician working in an emergency department who receives an unconscious patient wearing a medical identification tag saying DIABETIC. Paramedics may be called to rescue an unconscious person by friends who identify them as diabetic. Brief descriptions of the three major conditions are followed by a discussion of the diagnostic process used to distinguish among them, as well as a few other conditions which must be considered.

An estimated 2 to 15 percent of people with diabetes will have at least one episode of diabetic coma in their lifetimes as a result of severe hypoglycemia.

==Types==

===Severe hypoglycemia===
People with type 1 diabetes mellitus who must take insulin in full replacement doses are most vulnerable to episodes of hypoglycemia (low blood glucose levels). This can occur if a person takes too much insulin or diabetic medication, does strenuous exercise without eating additional food, misses meals, consumes too much alcohol, or consumes alcohol without food. It is usually mild enough to reverse by eating or drinking carbohydrates, but blood glucose occasionally can fall fast enough and low enough to produce unconsciousness before hypoglycemia can be recognized and reversed. Hypoglycemia can be severe enough to cause unconsciousness during sleep. Predisposing factors can include eating less than usual or prolonged exercise earlier in the day. Some people with diabetes can lose their ability to recognize the symptoms of early hypoglycemia.

Unconsciousness due to hypoglycemia can occur within 20 minutes to an hour after early symptoms and is not usually preceded by other illness or symptoms. Twitching or convulsions may occur. A person unconscious from hypoglycemia is usually pale, has a rapid heart beat, and is soaked in sweat: all signs of the adrenaline response to hypoglycemia. The individual is not usually dehydrated and breathing is normal or shallow. Their blood sugar level, measured by a glucose meter or laboratory measurement at the time of discovery, is usually low but not always severely, and in some cases may have already risen from the nadir that triggered the unconsciousness.

Unconsciousness due to hypoglycemia is treated by raising the blood glucose with intravenous glucose or injected glucagon.

===Advanced diabetic ketoacidosis===
Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), most typically seen in those with type 1 diabetes, is triggered by the build-up of chemicals called ketones. These are strongly acidic and a build-up can cause the blood to become acidic. When these levels get too high it essentially poisons the body and causes DKA.

If it progresses and worsens without treatment it can eventually cause unconsciousness, from a combination of a very high blood sugar level, dehydration and shock, and exhaustion. Coma only occurs at an advanced stage, usually after 36 hours or more of worsening vomiting and hyperventilation.

In the early to middle stages of ketoacidosis, patients are typically flushed and breathing rapidly and deeply, but visible dehydration, pale appearance from diminished perfusion, shallower breathing, and a fast heart rate are often present when coma is reached. However these features are variable and not always as described.

If the patient is known to have diabetes, the diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis is usually suspected from the appearance and a history of 1–2 days of vomiting. The diagnosis is confirmed when the usual blood chemistries in the emergency department reveal a high blood sugar level and severe metabolic acidosis.

Treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis consists of isotonic fluids to rapidly stabilize the circulation, continued intravenous saline with potassium and other electrolytes to replace deficits, insulin to reverse the ketoacidosis, and careful monitoring for complications.

===Nonketotic hyperosmolar coma===
Nonketotic hyperosmolar coma usually develops more insidiously than diabetic ketoacidosis because the principal symptom is lethargy progressing to obtundation, rather than vomiting and an obvious illness. Extremely high blood sugar levels are accompanied by dehydration due to inadequate fluid intake. Coma occurs most often in patients who have type 2 or steroid diabetes and have an impaired ability to recognize thirst and drink. It is classically a nursing home condition but can occur in all ages.

The diagnosis is usually discovered when a chemistry screen performed because of obtundation reveals an extremely high blood sugar level (often above 1800 mg/dl (100 mM)) and dehydration. The treatment consists of insulin and gradual rehydration with intravenous fluids.

===Identifying the cause===
Diabetic coma was a more significant diagnostic problem before the late 1970s, when glucose meters and rapid blood chemistry analyzers were not available in all hospitals. In modern medical practice, it rarely takes more than a few questions, a quick look, and a glucose meter to determine the cause of unconsciousness in a patient with diabetes. Laboratory confirmation can usually be obtained in half an hour or less. Other conditions that can cause unconsciousness in a person with diabetes are stroke, uremic encephalopathy, alcohol, drug overdose, head injury, or seizure.

Most patients do not reach the point of unconsciousness or coma in cases of diabetic hypoglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, or severe hyperosmolarity before a family member or caretaker seeks medical help.

==Treatment==
Treatment depends upon the underlying cause:

* Hypoglycemic diabetic coma: administration of the hormone glucagon to reverse the effects of insulin, or glucose given intravenously.
* Ketoacidotic diabetic coma: intravenous fluids, insulin and administration of potassium and sodium.
* Hyperosmolar diabetic coma: plenty of intravenous fluids, insulin, potassium and sodium given as soon as possible.

<text>Georges Jacques Danton (; ; 26 October 1759 – 5 April 1794) was a leading figure in the French Revolution. A modest and unknown lawyer on the eve of the Revolution, Danton became a famous orator of the Cordeliers Club and was raised to governmental responsibilities as the French Minister of Justice following the fall of the monarchy on the tenth of August 1792, and was allegedly responsible for inciting the September Massacres. He was tasked by the National Convention to intervene in the military conquest of Belgium led by General Dumouriez, and in the spring of 1793 supported the foundation of a Revolutionary Tribunal, becoming the first president of the Committee of Public Safety.

During the Insurrection of 31 May – 2 June 1793, Danton changed his mind on the use of force and lost his seat in the committee afterwards, which solidified the rivalry between him and Maximilien Robespierre. In early October 1793, Danton left politics but was urged to return to Paris to plead, as a moderate, for an end to the Terror. His continual criticism of the Committee of Public Safety provoked further counter-attacks. Robespierre replied to Danton&#x27;s plea for an end to the Terror on 25 December (5 Nivôse, year II). At the end of March 1794, Danton made another speech announcing the end of the Terror. Within a week, Danton faced accusations of purported royalist inclinations, leading to his trial and subsequent guillotine execution on charges of conspiracy and venality.

Danton&#x27;s role in the onset of the Revolution has been disputed, especially during the French Third Republic; many historians describe him as &quot;the chief force in the overthrow of the French monarchy and the establishment of the First French Republic&quot;.

==Early life==
Danton was born in Arcis-sur-Aube (Champagne in northeastern France) to Jacques Danton, a respectable, but not wealthy lawyer, and Madeleine Camus. As a baby, he was attacked by a bull and a few years later, came down with a bout of smallpox which resulted in the disfigurement and scarring of his face. He initially attended the school in Sézanne, but at the age of thirteen he left his parents&#x27; home to enter the seminary in Troyes before making a transition to a boarding school in the same area. While attending school, his classmate and friend Jules-François Paré was to have his hands rapped as punishment, but Danton defended his friend and spoke out against corporal punishment in class. Danton spoke so persuasively that the head of the school decided to ban the practice. In 1780, he settled in Paris, where he became a clerk under the Barrister Maître Vinot. In 1783, he passed the Barrister examination in Reims, and in 1787 he became a member of the Conseil du Roi. He began to frequent a cafe known as the Parnasse, which is where he met Antoinette Gabrielle Charpentier, whom he would marry on 14 June 1787 at the church of Saint-Germain-l&#x27;Auxerrois. The couple lived in a six-room apartment in the heart of the Left Bank (near the Café Procope), and had three sons:
* François, born in May 1788, died in infancy on 24 April 1789.
* Antoine, born on 18 June 1790, died on 14 June 1858.
* François Georges, born on 2 February 1792, died on 18 June 1848.

==Revolution==

In the Spring of 1789, Danton found his revolutionary beginnings as one of the many people giving speeches to the crowds gathered in the Palais Royal. However, his demanding voice and rhetorical skill quickly gained him fame, as well as the nickname The Thunderer. As the Cordeliers district Danton resided in grew more persistent in its revolutionary ideals, it eventually formed its own street militia that was involved in the storming of the Bastille on July 14, 1789. Danton himself was not present for the event, however, he soon after led the Cordeliers militia, as well as other revolutionaries, on a mission to retake the Bastille from its provisional governor, which gained him more popular support from the revolutionaries. He and his district opposed the Marquis de LaFayette, the commander of the National Guard, as well as Jean Sylvain Bailly, the provisional mayor. In early October, he was elected president of his section (around the Cordeliers Convent) and deputy to the Commune and wrote the poster for the Cordeliers which called Parisians to arms.

His house in the Rue des Cordeliers was open to many people from the neighborhood. Danton, Desmoulins, and Marat, who lived around the corner, all used the nearby Cafe Procope as a meeting place. Danton protected Marat from legal proceedings, and in March 1790, LaFayette ordered Danton detained. Paris Commune was divided up into 48 sections and allowed to gather separately. Danton was removed from office by a redistricting of Paris, for which he was compensated.

On 27 April 1790, he became president of the Club de Cordeliers. On 2 August, Bailly became Paris&#x27; first elected mayor; Danton had 49 votes, Marat and Louis XVI only one each. In spring 1791, Danton suddenly began investing in property, in or near his birthplace, on a large scale.

Robespierre, Pétion, Danton, and Brissot dominated the Jacobin Club. On 17 July 1791, Danton initiated a petition. Robespierre went to the Jacobin club to cancel the draft of the petition, according to Albert Mathiez. Robespierre persuaded the Jacobin clubs not to support the petition by Danton and Brissot. After the Champ de Mars massacre, a series of repressive measures against the heads of popular societies forced him to take refuge in London for a few weeks. Since Jean-Paul Marat, Danton, and Robespierre were no longer delegates of the Assembly, politics often took place outside the meeting hall.

After the amnesty voted in the Assembly on 13 September 1791, Danton returned to Paris. He sought election to the new Legislative Assembly, but the opposition of the moderates in the electoral assembly of Paris led to his defeat. In December 1791, during the partial renewal of the municipality, there was significant abstention. This led to the defeat of LaFayette and the resignation of Bailly, which revealed the decline of the &quot;constitutional&quot; party which had until then dominated the Hôtel de Ville. Danton was elected second deputy &quot;procureur&quot; &quot;public&quot; of the Commune. The debate at the beginning of December 1791 on whether to go to war with neighboring powers opposing the Revolution, triggered conflict between Jacobins and led to the birth of the opposition between Montagnards and Girondins. Danton hesitated on the need for war. He leaned more towards Robespierre than the pro-war Brissot, but, overall, limited his participation in the dispute.

===1792===
On 9 August 1792, Danton returned from Arcis. In the evening before the storming of the Tuileries, he was visited by Desmoulins, his wife, and Fréron. After dinner, he went to the Cordeliers and preferred to go to bed early. It seems he went to the Maison-Commune after midnight. Faced with the insurrectionary Commune which relied on the insurgent sections and which held Paris, the Legislative Assembly had no choice but to suspend Louis XVI and replace him with a provisional Executive Council of six members composed of former Girondin ministers (Roland in the Interior, Servan in the War, Clavière in Finance, Monge in the Navy and Lebrun in Foreign Affairs). The Girondins, hostile to revolutionary Paris, needed a popular man committed to the insurgents to liaise with the insurrectional Commune and had Danton appointed to Minister of Justice the next day; he appointed Fabre and Desmoulins as his secretaries. More than a hundred decisions left the department within eight days. On 14 August, Danton invited Robespierre to join the Council of Justice, which Robespierre declined to do. 

Danton seems to have dined almost every day at the Rolands. On 28 August, the Assembly ordered a curfew for the next two days. At the behest of Danton, thirty commissioners from the sections were ordered to search in every suspect house for weapons, munition, swords, carriages and horses. By 2 September, between 520 and 1,000 people were taken into custody on the flimsiest of warrants. The exact number of those arrested will never be known.

On Sunday 2 September, at about 13:00, Danton, as a member of the provisional government, delivered a speech in the assembly: &quot;We ask that anyone refusing to give personal service or to furnish arms shall be punished with death&quot;. &quot;The we are about to ring is not an alarm signal; it sounds the charge on the enemies of our country.&quot; He continued after the applause: &quot;To conquer them we must dare, dare again, always dare, and France is saved!&quot;. His speech acted as a call for direct action among the citizens, as well as a strike against the external enemy. Many believe this speech was responsible for inciting the September Massacres. It is estimated that around 1,100–1,600 people were murdered. Madame Roland held Danton responsible for their deaths. Danton was also accused by the French historians Adolphe Thiers, Alphonse de Lamartine, Jules Michelet, Louis Blanc and Edgar Quinet. However, according to Albert Soboul, there is no proof that the massacres were organized by Danton or by anyone else, though it is certain that he did nothing to stop them.

He did intervene, however, in protecting Roland and Brissot from an arrest warrant from the Supervisory Committee of the Commune on 4 September, opposing Marat by having the mandates removed, and was complicit in the escape of Adrien Duport, Talleyrand, and Charles de Lameth. On 6 September, he was elected by his section, &quot;Théâtre Français&quot;, to be a deputy for the convention, gathering on 22 September. Danton remained a member of the ministry, although holding both positions simultaneously was illegal. Danton, Robespierre, and Marat were accused of forming a triumvirate. On 26 September, Danton was forced to give up his position in the government; he stepped down on 9 October.

At the new National Convention on 4 October 1792, Danton proposed to declare that the fatherland was no longer in danger, asking only to renounce extreme measures. He measured the risks posed to the Revolution by fratricidal quarrels between Republicans. He preached conciliation and calls the Assembly several times to &quot;holy harmony&quot;. “It was in vain that we complained to Danton about the Girondine faction&quot;, wrote Robespierre, &quot;he maintained that there was no faction there and that everything was the result of vanity and personal animosities&quot;. But the attacks from the Girondins concentrated on him, Marat and Robespierre—the “triumvirs”—accused of aspiring to dictatorship. Danton defends Robespierre at the end of October by declaring that &quot;all those who talk about the Robespierre faction are, in my eyes, either prejudiced men or bad citizens&quot;, but dissociates himself from Marat by pronouncing &quot;I don&#x27;t like the individual Marat. I say frankly that I have experiences his temperament: he is volcanic, cantankerous and unsociable.&quot; The Girondins attacked Danton for his management of the secret funds of the Ministry of Justice. Roland, Minister of the Interior, scrupulously gave his accounts but Danton would not. Harassed by Brissot, he only escaped through weariness of the Convention and for months the Girondins shouted “And the accounts?&quot; to interrupt him at the podium. Meanwhile, his influence began to decline in favor of Robespierre as the real leader of the Mountain.

===1793===
On 10 February 1793, while Danton was on a mission in Belgium, his wife died while giving birth to their fourth child, who also died. Robespierre sent Danton a message. Danton was so affected by their deaths that he recruited the sculptor Claude André Deseine and, a week after Charpentier&#x27;s death, brought him to Sainte-Catherine cemetery to exhume her body and execute a plaster bust of her appearance.

On 10 March, Danton supported the foundation of a Revolutionary Tribunal. He proposed the release of all imprisoned debtors as conscripts in the army. On 6 April, the Committee of Public Safety, which was then composed of only nine members, was installed on the proposal of Maximin Isnard, who was supported by Georges Danton. Danton was appointed a member of the committee. He and other members of the committee, despite its primary charge of defeating invasion and internal rebellions, were advocates of the moderation necessary to minimize popular resistance to military requisitions. Due to military reversals in 1793, manyespecially among the &quot;sans-culottes&quot;criticized its conduct, and subsequent committee membership included more radical thinkers who pressed for more extreme measures to ensure victory over enemies of the Revolution internal and external. On 20 March 1793 the National Convention send Danton and Delacroix to Leuven to investigate Dumouriez and his generals. On 27 April, the Convention decreed (on the proposal of Danton) to send additional military forces to the departments in revolt.

On 1 June Hanriot was ordered to fire a cannon on the Pont-Neuf as a sign of alarm. When the Convention assembled Danton rushed to the tribune: &quot;Break up the Commission of Twelve! You have heard the thunder of the cannon. Girondins protested against the closing of the city gates, against the tocsin and alarm-gun without the approval of the convention; Vergniaud suggested arresting Henriot. That night Paris changed into a military camp according to Otto Flake. On 2 June according to Louis Madelin and Mignet a large force of armed citizens, some estimated 80,000 or 100,000, but Danton spoke of only 30,000, surrounded the Convention with 48 pieces of artillery. The next day the Interior minister Garat forced Danton to disavow the events from the evening before.

On 1 July 1793, Danton married Louise Sébastienne Gély, aged 17, daughter of Marc-Antoine Gély, court usher (huissier-audiencier) at the Parlement of Paris and member of the Club des Cordeliers. He also married in a Catholic ceremony, confessing his sins first to the priest Pierre-Marie Grayo de Keravenan. On 10 July, he was not re-elected as a member of the Committee of Public Safety. Seventeen days later, Robespierre joined the Committee of Public Safety, nearly two years after Danton had extended an invitation to him to do so. On 5 September, Danton argued for a law to give the sans-culottes a small compensation for attending the twice-weekly section meetings, and to provide a gun to every citizen.

==Reign of Terror==

On 6 September, Danton refused to take a seat in the Committee of Public Safety, declaring that he would join no committee, but would be a spur to them all. He believed a stable government was needed which could resist the orders of the Committee of Public Safety. On 10 October, Danton, who had been dangerously ill for a few weeks, quit politics, and set off to Arcis-sur-Aube with his 16-year-old wife, who had pitied Marie Antoinette since her trial began. On 18 November, after the arrest of François Chabot, Edme-Bonaventure Courtois urged Danton to come back to Paris to again play a role in politics.

On 22 November, Danton attacked religious persecution and demanded frugality with human lives. He tried to weaken the Terror by attacking Jacques René Hébert. On 3 December, Robespierre accused Danton of feigning an illness with the intention to emigrate to Switzerland, declaring that Danton showed too often his vices and not his virtue. Robespierre was stopped in his attack. The gathering was closed after thunderous applause for Danton. Danton maintained that he had absolutely no intention of breaking the revolutionary impulse.

On 9 December, Danton became embroiled in a scandal concerning the bankruptcy proceedings of the French East India Company, when it was discovered that directors of the company had bribed certain government officials to allow the company to liquidate its own assets, rather than the government controlling the process. By December, a Dantonist party had been formed in support of Danton&#x27;s more moderate views and his insistence on clemency for those who had violated the Committee for Public Safety&#x27;s increasingly arbitrary and draconian &quot;counter-revolutionary&quot; measures. On 25 December (5 Nivôse, year II) Robespierre replied to Danton&#x27;s plea for an end to the Terror.

The French National Convention during the autumn of 1793 began to assert its authority further throughout France, creating the bloodiest period of the French Revolution, during which some historians assert approximately 40,000 people were killed in France. Following the fall of the Girondins, a group known as the Indulgents would emerge from amongst the Montagnards as the legislative right within the convention, with Danton as their most vocal leader. Having long supported the progressive acts of the Committee of Public Safety, Danton would begin to propose that the Committee retract legislation instituting terror as &quot;the order of the day.&quot;

On 26 February 1794, Saint-Just delivered a speech before the Convention in which he directed the assault against Danton, claiming that the Dantonists wanted to slow down the Terror and the Revolution. It seems Danton became exasperated by Robespierre&#x27;s repeated references to virtue. On 6 March, Barère attacked the Hébertists and Dantonists.

While the Committee of Public Safety was concerned with strengthening the centralist policies of the convention and its own grip over that body, Danton was in the process of devising a plan that would effectively move popular sentiment among delegates towards a more moderate stance. This meant adopting values popular among the sans-culottes, notably the control of bread prices that had seen drastic increase with the famine that was being experienced throughout France. Danton also proposed that the Convention begin taking actions towards peace with foreign powers, as the committee had declared war on the majority of European powers, such as Britain, Spain, and Portugal. Danton made a triumphant speech announcing the end of the Terror. As Robespierre listened, he was convinced that Danton was pushing for leadership in a post-Terror government. If Robespierre did not counter-attack quickly, the Dantonists could seize control of the National Convention and bring an end to his Republic of Virtue.

The Reign of Terror was not a policy that could be easily transformed. Indeed, it would eventually continue past the Thermidorian Reaction (27 July 1794), when some members of the Convention rose against the committee, executed its leaders, and placed power in the hands of new men with a new policyto dissolve Jacobinism (White Terror). However, in Germinalthat is, in March 1794the anti-Terror sentiment had not yet reached critical mass. The committees were still too strong to be overthrown, and Danton, heedless, instead of striking with vigor in the convention, waited to be struck. &quot;In these latter days&quot;, wrote Morley in the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition, &quot;a certain discouragement seems to have come over his spirit&quot;. Danton remarried, and, Morley continues, &quot;the rumour went that he was allowing domestic happiness to tempt him from the keen incessant vigilance proper to the politician in such a crisis.&quot;

Ultimately, Danton himself would become a victim of the Terror. In attempting to shift the direction of the revolution by collaborating with Camille Desmoulins on the production of &quot;Le Vieux Cordelier&quot;a newspaper that called for the end of the official Terror and Dechristianization, as well as for launching new peace overtures to France&#x27;s enemiesDanton had placed himself in a precarious position. Those most closely associated with the Committee of Public Safety, among them key figures such as Maximilien Robespierre and Georges Couthon, would eventually indict Danton for counter-revolutionary activities.

==Financial corruption and accusations==
Toward the end of the Reign of Terror, Danton was accused of various financial misdeeds, as well as using his position within the Revolution for personal gain. Many of his contemporaries commented on Danton&#x27;s financial success during the Revolution, certain acquisitions of money that he could not adequately explain. Many of the specific accusations directed against him were based on insubstantial or ambiguous evidence. For the Revolutionary Tribunal legal evidence was unnecessary, moral conviction by jury was enough to speed up the proceedings.

Between 1791 and 1793, Danton faced many allegations, including taking bribes during the insurrection of August 1792, helping his secretaries to line their pockets, and forging assignats during his mission to Belgium. Perhaps the most compelling evidence of financial corruption was a letter from Mirabeau to Danton in March 1791 that casually referred to 30,000 livres that Danton had received in payment.

During his tenure on the Committee of Public Safety, Danton organized a peace treaty agreement with Sweden. Although the Swedish government never ratified the treaty, on 28 June 1793, the convention voted to pay 4 million livres to the Swedish Regent for diplomatic negotiations. According to Bertrand Barère, a journalist and member of the convention, Danton had taken a portion of this money which was intended for the Swedish Regent. Barère&#x27;s accusation was never supported by any form of evidence.

The most serious accusation, which haunted him during his arrest and formed a chief ground for his execution, was his alleged involvement with a scheme to appropriate the wealth of the French East India Company. During the reign of the Old Regime, the original French East India Company went bankrupt. It was later revived in 1785, backed by royal patronage. The Company eventually fell under the notice of the National Convention for profiteering during the war. The company was soon liquidated while certain members of the Convention tried to push through a decree that would cause the share prices to rise before the liquidation. Discovery of the profits from this insider trading led to the blackmailing of the directors of the company to turn over half a million livres to known associates of Danton. While there was no hard evidence that Danton was involved, he was vigorously denounced by François Chabot, and implicated by the fact that Fabre d’Eglantine, a Dantonist, was implicated in the scandal. After Chabot was arrested on 17 November, Courtois urged Danton to return to Paris immediately.

In December 1793, the journalist Camille Desmoulins launched a new journal, &quot;Le Vieux Cordelier&quot;, attacking François Chabot and defending Danton in the first issue. In the second, Desmoulins attacked the use of terror as a governing tactic, comparing Robespierre with Julius Caesar and, in the following issue, arguing that the Revolution should return to its original ideas which were in vogue around 10 August 1792. Robespierre replied to Danton&#x27;s plea for an end to the Terror on 25 December (5 Nivôse, year II). Danton continued to defend Fabre d&#x27;Eglantine even after the latter had been exposed and arrested.

By February 1794, Danton was exasperated by Robespierre&#x27;s repeated references to virtue as the foundation of the revolutionary government. Danton&#x27;s continual criticism of the Committee of Public Safety provoked further counter-attacks. On 26 February 1794, Saint-Just, the president of the Convention, delivered a speech in which he directed the assault against Danton.

At the end of March 1794, Danton made a triumphant speech announcing the end of the Terror. Some government members were convinced that Danton was pushing for leadership in a post-Terror government. For several months, Robespierre had resisted arresting Danton. According to Linton, Robespierre had to choose between friendship and virtue. His aim was to sow enough doubt in the minds of the deputies regarding Danton&#x27;s political integrity to make it possible to proceed against him. Robespierre refused to see Desmoulins and rejected a private appeal. Then Robespierre broke with Danton, who had angered many other members of the Committee of Public Safety with his more moderate views on the Terror, but whom Robespierre had, until this point, persisted in defending.

==Arrest, trial, and execution==

On 30 March, the two committees reached a decision to apprehend Danton, Desmoulins, Marie-Jean Hérault de Séchelles, and Pierre Philippeaux. The trial began on 2 April, accusing them of conspiracy with count Mirabeau, Marquis de Lafayette, the Duke of Orléans and Dumouriez. In Robespierre&#x27;s eyes, the Dantonists had ceased to be true patriots prioritizing personal and foreign interests over the nation&#x27;s welfare.&lt;ref name=&quot;Le Siècle, 5 février 1898, p. 5/6&quot;&gt;Le Siècle, 5 février 1898, p. 5/6&lt;/ref&gt; The accusations of theft, corruption, and the scandal involving the French East India Company conveniently paved the way for Danton&#x27;s downfall.

Danton, Desmoulins, and several others faced trial from 3–5 April before the Revolutionary Tribunal, presided over by Martial Herman. Described as more politically charged than criminally focused, the trial proceeded in an irregular manner. The tribunal constituted a jury of five judges, including Souberbielle, and François Topino-Lebrun (who both hesitated to condemn Danton); the law required twelve jurors but only seven were present. Both Delacroix and Danton requested the right to present about 15 witnesses in their defense, but President Herman denied their request.

During the Convention, Louis Legendre, who was also one of the witnesses, proposed hearing from Danton within the assembly, but Robespierre replied, &quot;It would be violating the laws of impartiality to grant to Danton what was refused to others, who had an equal right to make the same demand.&quot; This answer silenced at once all solicitations in his favor. No friend of the Dantonists dared speak up, in case he too should be accused of putting friendship before virtue. The death of Hébert had rendered Robespierre master of the Paris Commune; the death of Danton would make him master of the convention as well.

During the trial, Delacroix and Danton&#x27;s disruptive behavior unsettled Fouquier-Tinville. Danton vigorously criticized the Committee of Public Safety, causing concern among the jury that he might win favor with the crowd. Following Robespierre&#x27;s advice, a decree was accepted to present Saint-Just&#x27;s account on Danton&#x27;s alleged royalist tendencies at the tribunal, effectively ending further debates and restraining any further insults to justice by the accused.

The Convention, amidst what was described as one of its &quot;worst fits of cowardice&quot;, approved Saint-Just&#x27;s proposal during the trial. This proposal allowed the tribunal to exclude any prisoner displaying disrespect for justice from further proceedings, enabling the tribunal to pronounce a sentence in the absentia of the accused.

President Herman struggled to control the proceedings until the Convention enacted the aforementioned decree, limiting the accused from further self-defense. These events were compounded by confusing and often incidental accusations, such as a report suggesting that while engaged as a commissioner in Belgium, Danton had allegedly appropriated a carriage filled with table linen worth two or three hundred thousand livres from the Archduchess of Austria. The &quot;Moniteur&quot; published an account of the discussion in the Jacobin Club: Danton was accused of wanting to arrest Francois Henriot on 31 May 1793 and to become regent for Louis XVII.

On the last day Fouquier-Tinville asked the tribunal to order the defendants who &quot;confused the hearing&quot; and insulted &quot;National Justice&quot; to the guillotine. &quot;I leave it all in a frightful welter&quot;, Danton said. &quot;Not a man of them has an idea of government. Robespierre will follow me; he is dragged down by me. Ah, better to be a poor fisherman than to meddle with the government of men!&quot;. Judge Souberbielle asked himself: &quot;Which of the two, Robespierre or Danton, is the more useful to the Republic?&quot;

Fouquier-Tinville resorted to his customary approach, &quot;asking&quot; the jury if they felt adequately &quot;enlightened,&quot; ultimately leading to a verdict of guilty. The defendants, of whom nine were députés of the Convention, were removed from the room before the verdict was delivered and, by cutting their hair, prepared for the guillotine. Danton was beheaded on 5 April 1794 at sunset, together with group of fifteen people which included Hérault de Séchelles, Westermann and Philippeaux among others. Hérault de Séchelle was first, Desmoulins died third and Danton last. It is said his last words, spoken to his executioner Sanson were &quot;show the people my head. It is well worth seeing.&quot;
Fabre d&#x27;Églantine, Delaunay, Junius Frey, Chabot, Bazire were involved in the scandal around the French East India Company. Robespierre was sharply critical of Amar&#x27;s report, which presented the scandal as purely a matter of fraud. Robespierre insisted that it was a foreign plot, demanded that the report be re-written, and used the scandal as the basis for rhetorical attacks on William Pitt the Younger who he believed was involved. The directors of the French East India Company were never interrogated at all. Some scholars have supported this view, pointing to links between the Pitt government and the Baron de Batz, who developed plans to use economic warfare to create discord among leaders of the Revolution.

Danton and his associates were buried in the Errancis Cemetery, a common place of interment for those executed during the Revolution. In the mid-19th century, their skeletal remains were transferred to the Catacombs of Paris. Martial Herman resigned as president on 7 April.

On 9 Thermidor, when Garnier de l’Aube witnessed Robespierre&#x27;s inability to respond, he shouted, &quot;The blood of Danton chokes him!&quot; Robespierre then finally regained his voice to reply with his one recorded statement of the morning, a demand to know why he was now being blamed for the other man&#x27;s death: &quot;Is it Danton you regret? ... Cowards! Why didn&#x27;t you defend him?&quot;

==Character disputes==
Danton&#x27;s influence and character during the French Revolution were, and still are, widely disputed among many historians, with the varied perspectives on him ranging from corrupt and violent to generous and patriotic. Danton did not leave very much in the way of written works, personal or political; therefore most information about his actions and personality has been derived from secondhand sources.

One view of Danton, presented by historians like Thiers and Mignet, suggested he was &quot;a gigantic revolutionary&quot; with extravagant passions, a high level of intelligence, and an eagerness for violence in the pursuit of his goals. Another portrait of Danton emerges from the work of Lamartine, who called Danton a man &quot;devoid of honor, principles, and morality&quot; who found only excitement and a chance for distinction during the French Revolution. He was a mere &quot;statesman of materialism&quot; who was bought anew every day. Any revolutionary moments were staged for the prospect of glory and more wealth.

A differing perspective on Danton is presented by Robinet, whose assessment is more positive and portrays him as a figure worthy of admiration. According to Robinet, Danton was a committed, loving, generous citizen, son, father, and husband. He remained loyal to his friends and the country of France by avoiding &quot;personal ambition&quot; and gave himself wholly to the cause of keeping &quot;the government consolidated&quot; for the Republic. He always had a love for his country and the laboring masses, who he felt deserved &quot;dignity, consolation, and happiness&quot;.

 wrote that Danton stands out as a master of commanding phrase. One of his fierce sayings has become a proverb. Against the Duke of Brunswick and the invaders, &quot;il nous faut de l&#x27;audace, et encore de l&#x27;audace, et toujours de l&#x27;audace&quot;&quot;We need daring, and yet more daring, and always daring!&quot;. According to Georges Lefebvre he was nonchalant and lazy. He is seen as an optimist, a leader full of energy, who liked the pleasures of life, carefree and indulgent.

==Fictionalized accounts==

* Danton&#x27;s last days were made into a play, &quot;Dantons Tod&quot; (&quot;Danton&#x27;s Death&quot;), by Georg Büchner.
** The play formed the basis of the 1921 German film &quot;Danton&quot;.
** On the basis of Büchner&#x27;s play, Gottfried von Einem wrote an opera with the same title, on a libretto by himself and Boris Blacher, which premiered on 6 August 1947 at the Salzburger Festspiele.
* Danton, Robespierre, and Marat are characters in Victor Hugo&#x27;s novel &quot;Ninety-Three&quot; (Quatrevingt-treize), set during the French Revolution.
* Danton is a central character in Romanian playwright Camil Petrescu&#x27;s play of the same name.
* Danton appears in the Hungarian play &quot;The Tragedy of Man&quot; and the animated movie of the same name as one of Adam&#x27;s incarnations throughout Lucifer&#x27;s illusion.
* Danton&#x27;s and Robespierre&#x27;s quarrels were turned into a 1983 film, &quot;Danton&quot;, directed by Andrzej Wajda. The film itself is loosely based on Stanisława Przybyszewska&#x27;s 1929 play &quot;Sprawa Dantona&quot; (&quot;The Danton Case&quot;).
* Danton&#x27;s and Robespierre&#x27;s relations were also the subject of an opera by American composer John Eaton, &quot;Danton and Robespierre&quot; (1978).
* Danton is extensively featured in &quot;La Révolution française&quot; (1989).
* In his novel &quot;Locus Solus&quot;, Raymond Roussel tells a story in which Danton makes an arrangement with his executioner for his head to be smuggled into his friend&#x27;s possession after his execution. The nerves and musculature of the head ultimately end up on display in the private collection of Martial Canterel, reanimated by special electrical currents and showing a deeply entrenched disposition toward oratory.
* The Revolution as experienced by Danton, Robespierre, and Desmoulins is the central focus of Hilary Mantel&#x27;s novel &quot;A Place of Greater Safety&quot; (1993).
* Danton and Desmoulins are the main characters of Tanith Lee&#x27;s &quot;The Gods Are ThirstyA Novel of the French Revolution&quot; (1996).
* Danton and Robespierre are briefly referred to in the book &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot;. The two men both applaud a guard for his work in catching aristocrats.
* In &quot;The Tangled Thread&quot;, Volume 10 of &quot;The Morland Dynasty&quot;, a series of historical novels by author Cynthia Harrod-Eagles, the character Henri-Marie Fitzjames Stuart, bastard offshoot of the fictional Morland family, allies himself with Danton in an attempt to protect his family as the storm clouds of revolution gather over France.
* Danton appears briefly in Rafael Sabatini&#x27;s adventure novel &quot;Scaramouche: A tale of romance in the French Revolution&quot;.
* Danton appears in a series of comics entitled &quot;The Last Days of Georges Danton&quot; in &quot;Step Aside, Pops: A Hark! A Vagrant Collection&quot; by Kate Beaton.
* Danton is one of six point-of-view characters in Marge Piercy&#x27;s novel &quot;City of Darkness, City of Light&quot; (1996).
* Danton, along with Marat and Robespierre, is a secondary character in the 1927 epic &quot;Napoléon&quot;. His portrayal in the film is somewhat cartoonish, as he is depicted as a decadent fop, albeit dedicated to republicanism and revolution, and it is he that allows Rouget de Lisle to premiere &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; at the Club des Cordeliers. (In reality, no such performance by Rouget de Lisle is known to have taken place.)

<text> (; ; ) is a Belgian city and municipality in the Flemish province of West Flanders. The municipality comprises the city of proper and the former communes of Beerst, Esen, Kaaskerke, Keiem, Lampernisse, Leke, Nieuwkapelle, Oostkerke, Oudekapelle, Pervijze, Sint-Jacobs-Kapelle, Stuivekenskerke, Vladslo and Woumen.

Most of the area west of the city is a polder riddled with drainage trenches. The major economic activity of the region is dairy farming, producing the famous butter of .

==History==

===Medieval origins===
The 9th-century Frankish settlement of &quot;Dicasmutha&quot; was situated at the mouth of a stream near the River Yser (). The name is a compound of the Dutch words (dike) and (river mouth). By the 10th century, a chapel and marketplace were already established. The city&#x27;s charter was granted two centuries later and defensive walls built in 1270. The economy was already then based mainly on agriculture, with dairy products and linen driving the economy.

From the 15th century to the French Revolution, Diksmuide was affected by the wars between the Netherlands, France, Spain, and Austria, with a corresponding decline in activity; it was captured by French forces in the Capitulation of Diksmuide in 1695. The 19th century was more peaceful and prosperous.

===World War I===
At the outset of World War I, German troops crossed the Belgian border near Arlon, then proceeded hurriedly towards the North Sea to secure the French ports of and Dunkirk. The Battle of the Yser started in October 1914. Thanks to the water the Belgians were able to stop the Germans; at the end of October, they opened the floodgates holding back the River Yser and flooded the area. As a result, the river became a front line throughout the First World War. The city was first attacked on 16 October 1914 and defended by Belgian and French troops, which marked the beginning of the battle. Colonel Alphonse Jacques led the troops that prevented from being taken by the German Army. Despite the heavy Belgian losses, the press, politicians, literary figures and the military itself created propaganda which formed public opinion into making the action appear strategic and heroic.

By the time the fighting ended, the town had been reduced to rubble. It was, however, completely rebuilt in the 1920s.

==Sights==

*The &quot;Trench of Death&quot; (), about from the centre of the city, preserves the trench setting where Belgian soldiers fought under the most perilous conditions until the final offensive of 28 September 1918.
*The Yser Tower peace monument was built during the 1920s but demolished in 1946 as it had been the scene of Nazi ceremonies and collaboration during World War II. A new tower was built in the 1950s which houses a World War I museum owned by the United Nations, where it is possible to experience mustard gas odour gas. The Yser Tower is also the scene of the yearly , a celebration of peace and of Flemish political autonomy. However, the tower had become associated with neo-Nazis from all over Europe but eventually the organisers succeeded in banning neo-Nazis. The more radical Flemish faction now organizes the .
*Several military cemeteries are located around , including the Vladslo German war cemetery, which is now the resting place for more than 25,000 German soldiers and has the famous sculpture of the &#x27;Mourning parents&#x27; by Käthe Kollwitz.

<text>Banned books are books or other printed works such as essays or plays which have been prohibited by law, or to which free access has been restricted by other means. The practice of banning books is a form of censorship, from political, legal, religious, moral, or commercial motives. This article lists notable banned books and works, giving a brief context for the reason that each book was prohibited. Banned books include fictional works such as novels, poems and plays and non-fiction works such as biographies and dictionaries.

Since there have been a large number of banned books, some publishers have sought out to publish these books. The best-known examples are the Parisian Obelisk Press, which published Henry Miller&#x27;s sexually frank novel &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot;, and Olympia Press, which published William Burroughs&#x27;s &quot;Naked Lunch&quot;. Both of these, the work of father Jack Kahane and son Maurice Girodias, specialized in English-language books which were prohibited, at the time, in Great Britain and the United States. , also located in Paris, specialized in books prohibited in Spain during the dictatorship of Francisco Franco. Russian literature prohibited during the Soviet period was published outside of Russia.

Many countries throughout the world have their own methods of restricting access to books, although the prohibitions vary strikingly from one country to another.

Despite the opposition from the American Library Association (ALA), books continue to be banned by school and public libraries across the United States. This is usually the result of complaints from parents, who find particular books not appropriate for their children (e.g., books with depictions of LGBTQ+ individuals, like&quot; Gender Queer: A Memoir&quot;). In many libraries, including the British Library and the Library of Congress, erotic books are housed in separate collections in restricted access reading rooms. In some libraries, a special application may be needed to read certain books. Libraries sometimes avoid purchasing controversial books, and the personal opinions of librarians have at times affected book selection.

The following list of countries includes historical states that no longer exist.

== Bible ==

The distribution, promotion of different Bible versions and verses or translation seen as incorrect that have been prohibited or impeded throughout its history. Violators of Bible prohibitions have at times been punished by imprisonment, forced labor, banishment and execution, as well as the destruction or confiscation of the Bibles. In most cases this was related to them being viewed as incorrect and different from the accepted canon within the religion but there are also examples of the distribution and promotion of the Bible and the religion being banned in general and are ongoing in various jurisdictions.

=== West Germany (1949–1990) and Germany (1990–present) ===
In today&#x27;s Germany, a book is considered banned if it has been confiscated by a court. The distribution of a confiscated book is prohibited, but private possession and reading is still legal (with the exception of child and youth pornographic material, where possession is already a criminal offense).

The official list of confiscated books was published by the Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons (Bundeszentrale für Kinder- und Jugendmedienschutz) in the magazine &quot;BzKJaktuell&quot; until the beginning of 2022.

The list of confiscated books should not be confused with books on the &quot;List of Media Harmful to Young Persons&quot; (colloquially known as the &quot;Index&quot;). Books indexed by the Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons are subject to strict restrictions and may only be offered and sold to adults.

* Section 86a: &quot;Use of symbols of unconstitutional and terrorist organisations&quot;
* Section 130: &quot;Incitement of masses&quot;
* Section 130a: &quot;Instructions for committing criminal offences&quot;

<text>Ostend ( ; ; ; ) is a coastal city and municipality in the province of West Flanders in the Flemish Region of Belgium. It comprises the boroughs of Mariakerke, Raversijde, Stene and Zandvoorde, and the city of Ostend proper – the largest on the Belgian coast.

==History==

===Middle Ages===
In the Early Middle Ages, Ostend was a small village built on the east-end () of an island (originally called Testerep) between the North Sea and a beach lake. Although small, the village rose to the status of &quot;town&quot; around 1265, when the inhabitants were allowed to hold a market and to build a market hall.

The major source of income for the inhabitants was fishing. The North Sea coastline has always been rather unstable due to the power of the water. In 1395 the inhabitants decided to build a new Ostend behind large dikes and further away from the always-threatening sea.

===15th–18th centuries===


The strategic position on the North Sea coast had major advantages for Ostend as a harbour but also proved to be a source of trouble. The town was frequently taken, ravaged, ransacked and destroyed by conquering armies. The Dutch rebels, the Gueuzen, took control of the town. The Siege of Ostend, 1601 to 1604, of which it was said that &quot;the Spanish assailed the unassailable and the Dutch defended the indefensible&quot;, cost a combined total of more than 80,000 dead or wounded, making it the single bloodiest battle of the Eighty Years&#x27; War. This shocking event set in motion negotiations that led to a truce several years later. When the truce broke down, it became a Dunkirker base.

After this era, Ostend was turned into a harbour of some importance. In 1722, the Dutch again closed off the entrance to the world&#x27;s biggest harbour of Antwerp, the Westerschelde. Therefore, Ostend rose in importance because the town provided an alternative exit to the sea. The Belgium Austriacum had become part of the Austrian Empire. The Austrian Emperor Charles VI granted the town the trade monopoly with Africa and the Far-East. The Oostendse Compagnie (Ostend trade company) was allowed to found colonies overseas. However, in 1727 the Oostendse Compagnie was forced to stop its activities because of Dutch and British pressure. The Netherlands and Britain would not allow competitors on the international trade level. Both nations regarded international trade as &quot;their&quot; privilege.

There was a Jewish community in Ostend, which was first noted in the 16th century.

===19th century===
On 19 September 1826, the local artillery magazine exploded. At least 20 people were killed and a further 200 injured. The affluent quarter of d&#x27;Hargras was levelled and scarcely a building in the city escaped damage. Disease followed the devastation leading to further deaths.

The harbour of Ostend continued to expand because the harbour dock, as well as the traffic connections with the hinterland, were improved. In 1838, a railway connection with Brussels was constructed. Ostend became a transit harbour to England in 1846 when the first ferry sailed to Dover. An October 1854 meeting of American envoys led to the Ostend Manifesto. Important for the image of the town was the attention it started to receive from the Belgian kings Leopold I and Leopold II. Both monarchs liked to spend their holidays in Ostend. Important monuments and villas were built to please the Royal Family, including the Hippodrome Wellington horse racing track and the Royal Galleries. The rest of aristocratic Belgium followed and soon Ostend became known as &quot;the queen of the Belgian sea-side resorts&quot;.

In 1866, Ostend was the venue for a crucial meeting of exile Spanish Liberals and Republicans which laid the framework for a major uprising in their country, culminating in Spain&#x27;s Glorious Revolution two years later.

===20th century===
Ostend (in common with nearly the entirety of the country) was occupied by German forces and used as an access point to the sea for submarines and other light naval forces for much of the duration of World War I. As a consequence, the port was subjected to two naval assaults by the Royal Navy.

The town hosted all of the sailing events for the 1920 Summer Olympics for Antwerp. Only the finals of the 12 foot dinghy were sailed in Amsterdam. Ostend also hosted the polo events.

World War II involved a second occupation of the town by Germany within a period of little more than twenty years; an occupation which it shared this time with most of northern Europe. Both conflicts brought significant destruction to Ostend. In addition, other opulent buildings which had survived the wars were later replaced with structures in the modernist architecture style.

===21st century===
Ostend&#x27;s Winter in the Park festival draws more than 600,000 people to the seaside city. During December, Ostend&#x27;s Christmas market, one of the largest in Europe, features vendors and food sellers along with ice skating, music and other events. A light-show tunnel on one of the major shopping streets attracts and amuses visitors from all over Belgium, Europe and beyond.

==Sights==
Ostend is known for its sea-side esplanade, including the Royal Galleries of Ostend, pier, and fine-sand beaches. Ostend is visited by many day-trippers heading to the beaches, especially during July and August. Tourists from inland Belgium and from abroad mostly arrive by train (day trips) and head for the closest beach area, the &quot;Klein Strand&quot;, located next to the pier. The locals and other residents in Belgium usually occupy the larger beach (het Groot Strand).

Near the beach is a well-preserved section of the fortified Atlantic Wall, open to the public as the Atlantic Wall Open Air Museum located in Raversijde. One can walk through the streets around &quot;Het Vissersplein&quot;. At certain times, there are markets in the neighbourhood streets and in the summer the &quot;Vissersplein&quot; has music festivals. The &quot;Vissersplein&quot; (&quot;Bonenstraat&quot;/&quot;Kadzandstraat&quot;) is a car free zone with many brasseries where patrons can sit outside and have a drink. Towards the port side there are many little fish outlets, and beyond that the ferries can be observed docking.

Notable sites include:

* the Casino and Fort Napoleon, Ostend
* Oostende railway station
* The &quot;Mercator&quot;, the ex–training sailing ship for Belgian merchant navy officers, now open to the public to view
* Hippodrome Wellington, horse racing venue
* St Petrus and St Paulus Church, Ostend (&quot;Sint-Petrus-en-Pauluskerk&quot;), built in Neo Gothic style
* King Leopold II statue
*Synagoge Oostende

==Museums==
The James Ensor museum can be visited in the house where the artist lived from 1917 until 1949.

The Mu.Zee (merged from the and the ) is the museum of modern art (from the 1830s to the present) and displays works of noted local painters such as James Ensor, Leon Spilliaert, Constant Permeke and the revolutionary post-war Belgian COBRA movement amongst others.

==Climate==
Ostend has a maritime temperate climate, influenced by winds from the North Sea, making summers cooler than inland Europe. 24-hour average temperatures below the freezing point is a rare occurrence. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Ostend has a marine west coast climate, abbreviated &quot;Cfb&quot; on climate maps.

==Transport==
Ostend–Bruges International Airport located 5 km (3 miles) from Ostend is primarily a freight airport but offers passenger flights to leisure destinations in Southern Europe and Turkey. TUI fly Belgium has its headquarters in Ostend. TAAG Angola Airlines&#x27;s Ostend offices are on the grounds of Ostend Airport.

The Ostend railway station is a major hub on the National Railway Company of Belgium network with frequent InterCity trains serving Brugge railway station, Gent-Sint-Pieters, Brussels South and Liège-Guillemins on Belgian railway line 50A. The Coast Tram connects Ostend with De Panne to the south and Knokke-Heist in the north.

Ostend formerly had busy ferry routes to Dover and Ramsgate, but the last of these services ended with the failure of TransEuropa Ferries in 2013.

<text>Oudenburg (; ; ; ) is a city and municipality located in the Belgian province of West Flanders. The municipality comprises the city of Oudenburg itself and the towns of Ettelgem, Roksem and Westkerke. On January 1, 2006 Oudenburg had a total population of 8,929. The total area is 35.38 km2 which gives a population density of 252 inhabitants per km2.

Oudenburg is situated on the location of a Roman &quot;castellum&quot; built in the 4th century, whose outline is still visible in the city&#x27;s streetplan. Some of the stones of the former walls were later used in the construction of the abbey. The former abbey of St. Peter at Oudenburg, founded by Arnold of Soissons, was destroyed during the French Revolution.

==History==
*1070 AD: Arnold of Soissons founded the Abbey of St. Peter in Oudenburg.
*1087: Death of Arnold of Soissons. (also known as Arnold of Oudenburg or Saint Arnold.)
*1226: The City is represented on a Seal.
*1843, February 2: The arms were granted.
The arms show a castle with the arms of the medieval Lords of Oudenburg in the gate. The castle (Burcht) is a canting element. The castle already appeared on the oldest seal of the city, dating from 1226. All later seals showed a castle, but the size and shape of the castle has changed considerably through the centuries. The small shield appeared for the first time in the 16th century.

In the 19th century, it was rumored that Attilla the Hun was responsible for the destruction of the town, which was claimed to have happened in the 5th century. 

==Notable people==
* Raphael de Mercatellis, church official and imperial counsellor.
* Felipe Diricksen, baroque painter primarily of portraits and religious paintings.
* Charles Geleyns, abbot of the abbey of St. Peter of Oudenburg.
* André Gennevoise, owner of the abbey of St. Peter of Oudenburg.

<text>The &#x27; (English: Index of Forbidden Books&quot;&quot;&#x27;) was a changing list of publications deemed heretical or contrary to morality by the Sacred Congregation of the Index (a former dicastery of the Roman Curia); Catholics were forbidden to print or read them, subject to the local bishop. Catholic states could enact laws to adapt or adopt the list and enforce it.

The &quot;Index&quot; was active from 1560 to 1966. It banned thousands of book titles and blacklisted publications, including the works of Europe&#x27;s intellectual elites.

The &quot;Index&quot; condemned religious and secular texts alike, grading works by the degree to which they were deemed to be repugnant, potentially misleading and / or heretical to the Sacred Congregation of the Index at the time. The aim of the list was to protect church members from reading theologically, culturally, or politically disruptive books. At times such books included the works of theologians, such as Robert Bellarmine and astronomers, such as Johannes Kepler&#x27;s (published in three volumes from 1618 to 1621), which was on the Index from 1621 to 1835; philosophers, such as Antonio Rosmini-Serbati and Immanuel Kant&#x27;s &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot; (1781); and editions and translations of the Bible that had not been approved. Editions of the &quot;Index&quot; also contained the rules of the Church relating to the reading, selling, and preemptive censorship of books.

==Background and history==

===European restrictions on the right to print===
The historical context in which the &quot;Index&quot; appeared involved the early restrictions on printing in Europe. The refinement of moveable type and the printing press by Johannes Gutenberg changed the nature of book publishing, and the mechanism by which information could be disseminated to the public. Books, once rare and kept carefully in a small number of libraries, could be mass-produced and widely disseminated.

In the 16th century, both the churches and governments in most European countries attempted to regulate and control printing because it allowed for the rapid and widespread circulation of ideas and information. The Protestant Reformation generated large quantities of polemical new writing by and within both the Catholic and Protestant camps, and religious subject matter was typically the area most subject to control. While governments and the church encouraged printing in many ways, which allowed the dissemination of Bibles and government information, works of dissent and criticism could also circulate rapidly. As a consequence, governments established controls over printers across Europe, requiring them to have official licenses to trade and produce books.

The early versions of prohibition indexes began to appear from 1529 to 1571. In the same time frame, in 1557 the English crown aimed to stem the flow of dissent by chartering the Stationers&#x27; Company. The right to print was restricted to the two universities (Oxford and Cambridge) and to the 21 existing printers in the city of London, which had between them 53 printing presses.

The French crown also tightly controlled printing, and the printer and writer Étienne Dolet was burned at the stake for atheism in 1546. The 1551 Edict of Châteaubriant comprehensively summarized censorship positions to date, and included provisions for unpacking and inspecting all books brought into France. The 1557 Edict of Compiègne applied the death penalty to heretics and resulted in the burning of a noblewoman at the stake. Printers were viewed as radical and rebellious, with 800 authors, printers and book dealers being incarcerated in the Bastille. At times, the prohibitions of church and state followed each other, e.g. René Descartes was placed on the Index in the 1660s and the French government prohibited the teaching of Cartesianism in schools in the 1670s.

The Copyright Act 1710 in Britain, and later copyright laws in France, eased this situation. Historian Eckhard Höffner claims that copyright laws and their restrictions acted as a barrier to progress in those countries for over a century, since British publishers could print valuable knowledge in limited quantities for the sake of profit. The German economy prospered in the same time frame since there were no restrictions.

===Early indexes (1529–1571)===
The first list of the kind was not published in Rome, but in Catholic Netherlands (1529); Venice (1543) and Paris (1551) under the terms of the Edict of Châteaubriant followed this example. By the mid-century, in the tense atmosphere of wars of religion in Germany and France, both Protestant and Catholic authorities reasoned that only control of the press, including a catalogue of prohibited works, coordinated by ecclesiastic and governmental authorities, could prevent the spread of heresy.

Paul F. Grendler (1975) discusses the religious and political climate in Venice from 1540 to 1605. There were many attempts to censor the Venetian press, which at that time was one of the largest concentrations of printers. Both church and government held to a belief in censorship, but the publishers continually pushed back on the efforts to ban books and shut down printing. More than once the index of banned books in Venice was suppressed or suspended because various people took a stand against it.

The first Roman &quot;Index&quot; was printed in 1557 under the direction of Pope Paul IV (1555–1559), but then withdrawn for unclear reasons. In 1559, a new index was finally published, banning the entire works of some 550 authors in addition to the individual proscribed titles: &quot;The Pauline Index felt that the religious convictions of an author contaminated all his writing.&quot; The work of the censors was considered too severe and met with much opposition even in Catholic intellectual circles; after the Council of Trent had authorised a revised list prepared under Pope Pius IV, the so-called &quot;Tridentine Index&quot; was promulgated in 1564; it remained the basis of all later lists until Pope Leo XIII, in 1897, published his .

The blacklisting of some Protestant scholars even when writing on subjects a modern reader would consider outside the realm of dogma meant that, unless they obtained a dispensation, obedient Catholic thinkers were denied access to works including: botanist Conrad Gesner&#x27;s ; the botanical works of Otto Brunfels; those of the medical scholar Janus Cornarius; to Christoph Hegendorff or Johann Oldendorp on the theory of law; Protestant geographers and cosmographers like Jacob Ziegler or Sebastian Münster; as well as anything by Protestant theologians like Martin Luther, John Calvin or Philipp Melanchthon. Among the inclusions was the Libri Carolini, a theological work from the 9th-century court of Charlemagne, which was published in 1549 by Bishop Jean du Tillet and which had already been on two other lists of prohibited books before being inserted into the Tridentine Index.

===Sacred Congregation of the Index (1571–1917)===

In 1571, a special congregation was created, the Sacred Congregation of the Index, which had the specific task to investigate those writings that were denounced in Rome as being not exempt of errors, to update the list of Pope Pius IV regularly and also to make lists of required corrections in case a writing was not to be condemned absolutely but only in need of correction; it was then listed with a mitigating clause (e.g., (&#x27;forbidden until corrected&#x27;) or (&#x27;forbidden until purged&#x27;)).

Several times a year, the congregation held meetings. During the meetings, they reviewed various works and documented those discussions. In between the meetings was when the works to be discussed were thoroughly examined, and each work was scrutinized by two people. At the meetings, they collectively decided whether or not the works should be included in the Index. Ultimately, the pope was the one who had to approve of works being added or removed from the Index. It was the documentation from the meetings of the congregation that aided the pope in making his decision.
This sometimes resulted in very long lists of corrections, published in the , which was cited by Thomas James in 1627 as &quot;an invaluable reference work to be used by the curators of the Bodleian Library when listing those works particularly worthy of collecting&quot;. Prohibitions made by other congregations (mostly the Holy Office) were simply passed on to the Congregation of the Index, where the final decrees were drafted and made public, after approval of the Pope (who always had the option to condemn an author personally—there are only a few examples of such condemnation, including those of Lamennais and Hermes).

An update to the Index was made by Pope Leo XIII, in the 1897 apostolic constitution , known as the . Subsequent editions of the Index were more sophisticated; they graded authors according to their supposed degree of toxicity, and they marked specific passages for expurgation rather than condemning entire books.

The Sacred Congregation of the Inquisition of the Roman Catholic Church later became the Holy Office, and since 1965 has been called the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. The Congregation of the Index was merged with the Holy Office in 1917, by the of Pope Benedict XV; the rules on the reading of books were again re-elaborated in the new . From 1917 onward, the Holy Office (again) took care of the Index.

===Holy Office (1917–1966)===
While individual books continued to be forbidden, the last edition of the Index to be published appeared in 1948. This 20th edition contained 4,000 titles censored for various reasons: heresy, moral deficiency, sexual explicitness, and so on. That some atheists, such as Schopenhauer and Nietzsche, were not included was due to the general (Tridentine) rule that heretical works (i.e., works that contradict Catholic dogma) are &quot;ipso facto&quot; forbidden. Some important works are absent simply because nobody bothered to denounce them. Many actions of the congregations were of a definite political content.

Among the denounced works of the period was the Nazi philosopher Alfred Rosenberg&#x27;s &quot;Myth of the Twentieth Century&quot; for scorning and rejecting &quot;all dogmas of the Catholic Church, and the fundamentals of the Christian religion&quot;. Markedly absent from the Index was Adolf Hitler&#x27;s book . After gaining access to the Vatican Apostolic Archive church historian Hubert Wolf discovered that had been studied for three years but the Holy Office decided that it should not go on the Index because the author was a head of state. The Holy Office justified that decision by referring to chapter 13 of Paul the Apostle&#x27;s Epistle to the Romans regarding state authority coming from God. However, somewhat later, the Vatican criticized in the encyclical (March 1937) about the challenges of the church in Nazi Germany.

===Abolition (1966)===
On 7 December 1965, Pope Paul VI issued the that reorganized the Holy Office as the &quot;Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith&quot;. The Index was not listed as being a part of the newly constituted congregation&#x27;s competence, leading to questioning whether it still was. This question was put to Cardinal Alfredo Ottaviani, pro-prefect of the congregation, who responded in the negative. The Cardinal also indicated in his response that there was going to be a change in the Index soon.

A June 1966 Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith notification announced that, while the &quot;Index&quot; maintained its moral force, in that it taught Christians to beware, as required by the natural law itself, of those writings that could endanger faith and morality, it no longer had the force of ecclesiastical positive law with the associated penalties.

The canon law of the Latin Church still recommends that works should be submitted to the judgment of the local ordinary (typically, the bishop) if they concern sacred scripture, theology, canon law, or church history, religion or morals. The local ordinary consults someone whom he considers competent to give a judgment and, if that person gives the (&#x27;nothing forbids&#x27;), the local ordinary grants the (&#x27;let it be printed&#x27;). Members of religious institutes require the (&#x27;it can be printed&#x27;) of their major superior to publish books on matters of religion or morals.

==Scope and impact==
===Censorship and enforcement===
The &quot;Index&quot; was not simply a reactive work. Roman Catholic authors had the opportunity to defend their writings and could prepare a new edition with necessary corrections or deletions, either to avoid or to limit a ban. Pre-publication censorship was encouraged.

The &quot;Index&quot; was enforceable within the Papal States, but elsewhere only if adopted by the civil powers, as happened in several Italian states. Other areas adopted their own lists of forbidden books. In the Holy Roman Empire, book censorship, which preceded the publication of the &quot;Index&quot;, came under the control of the Jesuits at the end of the 16th century, but had little effect, since the German princes within the empire set up their own systems. In France it was French officials who decided what books were banned and the Church&#x27;s &quot;Index&quot; was not recognized. Spain had its own , which corresponded largely to the Church&#x27;s, but also included a list of books that were allowed once the forbidden part (sometimes a single sentence) was removed or &quot;expurgated&quot;.

===Continued moral obligation===
On 14 June 1966, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith responded to inquiries it had received regarding the continued moral obligation concerning books that had been listed in the Index. The response spoke of the books as examples of books dangerous to faith and morals, all of which, not just those once included in the Index, should be avoided regardless of the absence of any written law against them. The Index, it said, retains its moral force &quot;inasmuch as&quot; () it teaches the conscience of Christians to beware, as required by the natural law itself, of writings that can endanger faith and morals, but it (the Index of Forbidden Books) no longer has the force of ecclesiastical law with the associated censures.

The congregation thus placed on the conscience of the individual Christian the responsibility to avoid all writings dangerous to faith and morals, while at the same time abolishing the previously existing ecclesiastical law and the relative censures, without thereby declaring that the books that had once been listed in the various editions of the Index of Prohibited Books had become free of error and danger.

In a letter of 31 January 1985 to Cardinal Giuseppe Siri, regarding the book &quot;The Poem of the Man-God&quot;, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (then Prefect of the Congregation, who later became Pope Benedict XVI), referred to the 1966 notification of the Congregation as follows: &quot;After the dissolution of the Index, when some people thought the printing and distribution of the work was permitted, people were reminded again in (15 June 1966) that, as was published in the (1966), the Index retains its moral force despite its dissolution. A decision against distributing and recommending a work, which has not been condemned lightly, may be reversed, but only after profound changes that neutralize the harm which such a publication could bring forth among the ordinary faithful.&quot;

===Changing judgments===
The content of the Index Librorum Prohibitorum saw deletions as well as additions over the centuries. Writings by Antonio Rosmini-Serbati were placed on the Index in 1849 but were removed by 1855, and Pope John Paul II mentioned Rosmini&#x27;s work as a significant example of &quot;a process of philosophical enquiry which was enriched by engaging the data of faith&quot;. The 1758 edition of the Index removed the general prohibition of works advocating heliocentrism as a fact rather than a hypothesis.

Some of the scientific theories contained in works in early editions of the &quot;Index&quot; have long been taught at Catholic universities. For example, the general prohibition of books advocating heliocentrism was removed from the &quot;Index&quot; in 1758, but two Franciscan mathematicians had published an edition of Isaac Newton&#x27;s (1687) in 1742, with commentaries and a preface stating that the work assumed heliocentrism and could not be explained without it.

== Listed works and authors ==

Noteworthy figures on the Index include Simone de Beauvoir, Nicolas Malebranche, Jean-Paul Sartre, Michel de Montaigne, Voltaire, Denis Diderot, Victor Hugo, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, André Gide, Nikos Kazantzakis, Emanuel Swedenborg, Baruch Spinoza, Desiderius Erasmus, Immanuel Kant, David Hume, René Descartes, Francis Bacon, Thomas Browne, John Milton, John Locke, Nicolaus Copernicus, Niccolò Machiavelli, Galileo Galilei, Blaise Pascal, and Hugo Grotius. The first woman to be placed on the list was Magdalena Haymairus in 1569, who was listed for her children&#x27;s book (&quot;Sunday Epistles on the whole Year, put into hymns&quot;). Other women include Anne Askew, Olympia Fulvia Morata, Ursula of Munsterberg (1491–1534), Veronica Franco, and Paola Antonia Negri (1508–1555). Contrary to a popular misconception, Charles Darwin&#x27;s works were never included.

In many cases, an author&#x27;s (complete works) were forbidden. However, the Index stated that the prohibition of someone&#x27;s did not preclude works that were not concerned with religion and were not forbidden by the general rules of the Index. This explanation was omitted in the 1929 edition, which was officially interpreted in 1940 as meaning that covered all the author&#x27;s works without exception.

Cardinal Ottaviani stated in April 1966 that there was too much contemporary literature and the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith could not keep up with it.

<text>Ingelmunster (; ) is a municipality located in the Belgian province of West Flanders. The municipality comprises only the town of Ingelmunster proper and the village of Kriek. As of January 1, 2006, Ingelmunster had a total population of 10,617. Its total area is 16.16 km². Thus, its population density is 657 inhabitants per km².

== History ==

===The Middle Ages===

The famous Flemish historian Sanderus mentioned Ingelmunster as &quot;Anglo-Monasterium&quot; (&quot;English monastery&quot;), but the name could also have originated from the term &quot;Angle-Monastère&quot; (&quot;monastery on the corner&quot;), as it was situated in the outskirts of the fiefdom.

It is said that Saint Amand ordered the locals to have a church built in the village, going so far as to plan a monastery. Additionally, Robrecht the Frisian thought of the village as a strategic point and considered it important enough to have a fortification built. The parish was transferred to the chapter of Harelbeke around 1200. In 1300, the castle and the fiefdom fell into the possession of the lords of Rode, from the region of Dendermonde.

In the Middle Ages, Ingelmunster was, partly owing to its fortification, an important location in the Castellany of Kortrijk and the canton of Harelbeke. The village fiefdom came under the rule of the lords of Gistel after the House of Rode. It then became part of Burgundy and Cleves, and ultimately subject to the French throne.

The most famous royal resident of the village was Philip the Fair, King of France, who resided in the castle in 1297, five years before the Battle of the Golden Spurs. At that time, Philip was on his way to punish Bruges. The people of Bruges met him halfway with an offer of submission to his rule, on the condition that they be allowed to keep the relic of the Holy Blood. The French king accepted.

===Religious conflict===

During the religious wars of the 16th century, Ingelmunster became the victim of both warring parties. In August 1566, the Beeldenstormers passed by the village and pillaged and destroyed the church. The church was rebuilt with a tower in its center. In 1739, that tower would be torn down and a new one rebuilt in front of the church. The new tower remains standing to this day.

In 1580, Ingelmunster became the battlefield of a clash between the French Huguenots, under François de la Noue, and the Spanish occupying the castle. The village was destroyed, but de la Noue was arrested and sent to the Spanish lord Alessandro Farnese, Duke of Parma and Piacenza. In 1878, a large tapestry was woven in the local factories in commemoration of &quot;The Battle of Ingelmunster, 1580.&quot; This tapestry currently hangs on the wall of the Town Hall.

The extensive fighting in France and the Southern Netherlands exhausted the French crown&#x27;s money. Paris was barely able to pay its German colonels. The fiefdom of Ingelmunster-Vijve-Dendermonde was given as pay to the colonels. Otto von Plotho, a German colonel serving in the French army, purchased the fiefdom in 1583. In doing so, he satisfied the needs of his superiors and also accumulated significant wealth for himself.

Otto von Plotho assigned to his bailiff, François de Cabootere, the mission to organize his Flemish regions and to create legislative order. Ingelmunster became the center of the region and the administration there had absolute power. Even the executions in the region were carried out in Ingelmunster. In 1789, the last execution was carried out and the body was put on display in the field behind the café called &quot;&#x27;t Leestje&quot;.

Fifteen generations of lords owned the fiefdom and ruled it, with variable luck. However, after 400 years, the wealth was exhausted and the last remnants of the old fiefdom, the park and castle, were sold in 1986 to the two brothers Vanhonsebrouck.

The 17th century was a troublesome time for the region. Many skirmishes and conflicts between the English, French, and Spanish soldiers made life in the village of Ingelmunster trying. In 1695, the castle and the village were again completely razed. Only 1050 inhabitants survived to the turn of the century. In that time, France had extended its control to the village border with Emelgem.

===Habsburg rule===

The Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 ameliorated the strife. The Southern Netherlands were transferred to Austrian rule. Between 1716 and 1794, five governors-general directed the local government. Proof of Ingelmunster&#x27;s revival was the reconstruction of the castle. The old fortification was demolished and a residential castle was built on its foundations around 1736.

Under the rule of Maria Theresa of Austria, the Kortrijk-Bruges road was rebuilt. In Ingelmunster, the bridge over the River Mandel was renewed and the toll rights were sold in 1751. A private company maintained the connection between Kortrijk and Bruges and operated a post in Ingelmunster.

Pastor Jacobus Dufort felt that something had to be done about the education of the local children. Paying from his own pocket, he constructed the Dufort Institute (later called &quot;Marullenschool&quot;), a school for the poor employing seven nuns. From this school, the local monastery was founded in 1881. This monastery is still a part of Ingelmunster.

===The French Revolution===

The French Revolution in 1789 marked a major turning point in European history. Even the enlightened Austrians were startled, and not even Ingelmunster escaped the radical changes to society. The castle lost a significant amount of power and was forced to pay taxes. The local authorities were reformed and a municipal council with a mayor was created for the 4705 &quot;citoyens.&quot; The rebellion against the regime led to an uprising, the Boerenkrijg, but subsequent to the Brigandszondag on October 28, 1798, all resistance was gone. Ingelmunster acquired its nickname &quot;Brigandsgemeente&quot; from this historical event.

The rural village continued to exist and changes were made, but life returned to normal for the villagers. The locals were happy they could celebrate Mass on Sunday again. Indeed, when Napoleon was defeated at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, there were no festivities in Ingelmunster.

===The 19th century===

William I of the Netherlands granted Ingelmunster a market day in 1825 in order to allow the villagers access to supplies without having to leave their town, and this initiative was lauded by the Orangists. Around 1830, dozens of windmills were erected throughout in the municipality.

The Belgian Revolution in 1830 first reached Ingelmunster on November 11, when a new council was to be elected. Of the 5585 inhabitants, only 114 upper-class citizens had suffrage. The Orangists lost and a local farmer, Jacobus Coussens, was elected the new mayor with 66 votes. At this time, the Catholics formed a political party. It was immediately popular and thenceforth no other political party has controlled the council or mayorship.

Between the years of 1845 and 1850, potato harvests failed. Meanwhile, the Industrial Revolution was devastating local weaving businesses. Additionally, the region was impacted by widespread cholera and typhus.

In 1847, the village saw some development with the laying of a railroad through the village. In the future, this improved access to transportation would reap both bounties and consequences for Ingelmunster. For example, during World War I, the castle was commandeered by the Germans as a headquarters, and during the war, thieves frequently robbed local businesses.

A second city planning project met with less success the construction of the railroad. Plans to connect the city of Roeselare to the river Leie met with resistance in Ingelmunster due to the presence of the castle park. However, in 1872 the first ship sailed to the Leie and a quay was built near the village bridge.

===The 20th Century===

Ingelmunster has been spared from heavy industry and strong pollution up until the present day and still possesses a castle park and nature reserve in the center of the village.

In 1976, the town was preserved from fusions with the neighboring towns of Meulebeke and Oostrozebeke. The mayor at the time, Vankeirsbilck, succeeded in safeguarding Meulebeke and Oostrozebeke from fusion as well.

<text>Roeselare (; ; ) is a Belgian city and municipality in the Flemish province of West Flanders. The municipality comprises the city of Roeselare proper and the towns of Beveren, Oekene and Rumbeke.

The name of the city is derived from two Germanic words meaning &quot;reed&quot; and &quot;open space&quot;, &quot;i.e.&quot;, a marsh in a forest glade. Roeselare&#x27;s minor seminary is famous for having hosted the famous Flemish poets Guido Gezelle, Albrecht Rodenbach and missionary Jesuit Constant Lievens. The city is also home to the Rodenbach brewery.

==History==

===Origins and Middle Ages===
Traces of early dwellings have been found in the area, including prehistoric flint tools, Gallo-Roman wells, and a small 9th century Frankish building. The first mention of &quot;Roslar&quot; dates from a document dated 821 or 822, whereby the former domain of the Menapii, also called the &quot;Rollare&quot; villa in later documents, was given to Elnon Abbey. According to legend, Baldwin Iron Arm, Count of Flanders, kidnapped Judith, the daughter of Charles the Bold in 862 in Senlis and brought her to a fortress that used to be where the present Rumbeke Castle stands. The Roeselare area soon became part of the County of Flanders. The rights to build fortifications and to hold a public market date from 957, during the lordship of Baldwin III.

The city received its charter of freedoms in the mid-13th century, period in which it also built its first city hall and belfry. The manufacturing of cloth was then the main driver of the local economy. The few defensive walls that the city had were no match against the forces of Maximilian of Austria, who utterly destroyed the city at the end of the 15th century. The market hall and Saint Michael church were rebuilt in the year 1500.

===16th century to Waterloo===

The center of Roeselare belonged throughout history to the Fiefdom of Wijnendale and therefore fell under the responsibility of the House of Cleves in the 15th and 16th century and under the Dukes of Palatinate-Neuburg in the 17th and 18th century.

The 16th century proved to be disastrous for the city as the Spanish rulers ruthlessly repressed any desire for autonomy in the Low Countries, both political and religious. Iconoclasts stormed the city in 1566 and destroyed most of the sacred art. The Eighty Years&#x27; War that followed put an end to the wool supply from England, which in turn resulted in the disappearance of the cloth industry in Roeselare. Starting with the reigns of Archdukes Albert and Isabella, the beginning of the 17th century was a lot kinder to Roeselare. New churches and religious houses were built and old ones repaired. New schools also appeared in the city and the cloth industry found a new life. The second half of the century, however, was marked by the wars of Louis XIV and Marshal Turenne against the Spanish, with further plundering and misery. The Treaty of Nijmegen in 1678 made Roeselare a border city, a situation that encouraged smuggling rather than regular economic development.

The 18th century was a generally prosperous period that saw the construction of the current city hall. In 1794, the area was the scene of a French victory over the Austrians. The victors imposed deep reforms on the country, such as a new legal system (the Napoleonic Code) and the curtailment of religious freedoms, which lasted until the Concordat of 1802 between Napoleon and Pope Pius VII.

===Modern era===

Several members of the Rodenbach family of Roeselare took part in the events leading to Belgian Independence in 1830. Other members of the family became soldiers or diplomats. Pedro and Alexander founded the brewery which is still in operation today. The general economy, however, did not fare very well as mechanization displaced many small artisans. The advent of the railway and the digging of a canal linking the city to the river Lys in the 1860s were beneficial. World War I stopped the economic boom in its tracks as the city became a large camp ground for the German troops fighting on the front lines in neighbouring Diksmuide. By the end of the war, two thirds of the city was destroyed due to British bombing. The Transport Office of the Devastated Territories of West Flanders was set-up in Spanjestraat 56 after the war.

During World War II, on 27 and 28 May 1940, the Belgian army lost its last stand here against the advancing Wehrmacht. This was followed by four years of German occupation, although without too much destruction. The city was liberated by the Polish 1st Armoured Division in September 1944 (see also &quot;Belgium–Poland relations&quot;).

The city today is a regional center that provides commercial and media services, as well as a variety of occupations in the food industry, to the surrounding area.

<text>Staden (; ) is a village and rural municipality in the Belgian province of West Flanders. The municipality has around 11 000 inhabitants.

In the local West-Flemish dialect, the &quot;d&quot; is not pronounced, which results in &quot;Stoan&quot; as pronunciation.

== Geography ==

In 1976, Staden fused with the smaller villages of Oostnieuwkerke and Westrozebeke into a single municipality. As Staden was the bigger village, its name was used for the resulting municipality. Next to those three village centres, there are also a number of smaller hamlets. At the boundary between Staden, Westrozebeke and Poelkapelle, you can find the hamlet Vijfwegen. And on the boundary between Oostnieuwkerke and Hooglede, you can find the hamlet Sleihage. Both these hamlets had their own church and parish. The remaining population is spread over even smaller hamlets.
:

The municipality of Staden borders the following villages and municipalities:
*a. Roeselare (town of Roeselare)
*b. Passendale (municipality of Zonnebeke)
*c. Poelkapelle (municipality of Langemark-Poelkapelle)
*d. Houthulst (municipality of Houthulst)
*e. Zarren (municipality of Kortemark)
*f. Handzame (municipality of Kortemark)
*g. Hooglede, (municipality of Hooglede)

== History ==
The village of Staden was founded nearby the castle of Staden, around 1100. That castle was built in the forests, near the road between Ypres and Bruges. The castle of Staden fell mostly under the control of Ypres, but also partially under the control of Bruges. The castle itself was completely destroyed in 1917, during the First World War. Only a part of the moat remains, and a bench built from the stones of the old castle.

== Politics ==

Staden has always been known as a Christian-democrat municipality, like so many other rural municipalities in West Flanders, where the CVP and later CD&amp;V always held the majority or even absolute majority of the seats, and thus was always able to deliver the mayor.

However, after the election of 2012, it appeared that the Christian-democrats only got 10 of the 21 seats. On the evening of the counting, the three opposition parties: Open Vld, N-VA and sp.a got to an agreement and formed the majority with 11 of 21 seats. After the inauguration in 2013, from the Open Vld was the mayor of Staden. But the tight majority where all seats are needed caused some troubles. Near the end of 2014, Koen Demonie threatened to leave the N-VA, which would cost the majority one seat, and would make the municipality ungovernable.

=== Mayors of Staden since the fusion ===

* 1976-1982: Eugene Dermaut, CVP
* 1983-1992: Godfried De Tavernier, CVP
* 1992-2012: Josiane Lowie, CD&amp;V
* 2013–present: Francesco Vanderjeugd, Open Vld

<text>Allan Jaffee (born Abraham Jaffee; March 13, 1921 – April 10, 2023) was an American cartoonist. He was notable for his work in the satirical magazine &quot;Mad&quot;, including his trademark feature, the &quot;Mad&quot; Fold-in. Jaffee was a regular contributor to the magazine for 65 years and is its longest-running contributor. In a 2010 interview, Jaffee said, &quot;Serious people my age are dead.&quot;

With a career running from 1942 until 2020, Jaffee holds the Guinness World Record for having the longest career as a comic artist.
In the half-century between April 1964 and April 2013, only one issue of &quot;Mad&quot; was published without containing new material by Jaffee.

In 2008, Jaffee was honored by the Reuben Awards as the Cartoonist of the Year. Cartoonist Arnold Roth of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; said, &quot;Al Jaffee is one of the great cartoonists of our time.&quot; &quot;Peanuts&quot; creator Charles M. Schulz wrote, &quot;Al can cartoon anything.&quot;

==Early life==
Al Jaffee was born March 13, 1921, in Savannah, Georgia, to Mildred and Morris Jaffee, the eldest of four sons. His parents were Jewish immigrants from Zarasai, Lithuania. His mother was described as devoutly religious, to the point she had the crucifixes removed from the hospital room before giving birth.

In 1927, Mildred took her four sons, with Morris&#x27;s consent, back to Zarasai. After a year, Morris took the family back to the United States. After another year, Mildred took the children back to Lithuania, where they lived in a shtetl. With reading material scarce in his new home, Morris mailed comic-strip clippings from the United States. Jaffee became known for his ability to trace figures like Little Orphan Annie in the sand, for the amusement of his friends as well as the local bullies. After four more years, Morris again took the eldest three sons back to the United States, where they lived in Far Rockaway, Queens. David, Jaffee&#x27;s youngest brother, returned to U.S. in 1940, months before much of Zarasai&#x27;s Jewish population was murdered in the Holocaust, including, apparently, Mildred herself.

Jaffee studied at the High School of Music &amp; Art in New York City in the late 1930s, along with his brother Harry and future &quot;Mad&quot; personnel Will Elder, Harvey Kurtzman, John Severin, and Al Feldstein.

While Morris&#x27;s perseverance probably saved his sons&#x27; lives, he later showed increasingly erratic behavior himself, thereby missing his son&#x27;s high school graduation, and inexplicably discarding all his belongings and art projects once he left for the Army.

These experiences of perpetual absurdity and repeated alienation were later credited by his friends and wife as having sharpened his satirical edge, making him recognize that authority figures in his life could be oppressive and absurd (something he called &quot;anti-adultism&quot;), and quick to find nuances others miss, especially in the semantics of the English language.

==Career==

Jaffee began his career in 1942, working as a comic book artist for several publications, including &quot;Joker Comics&quot;, in which he was first published in December 1942, and continuing in other comics published by Timely Comics and Atlas Comics, the 1940s and 1950s precursors of Marvel Comics. While working alongside future &quot;Mad&quot; cartoonist Dave Berg, Jaffee created several humor features for Timely, including &quot;Inferior Man&quot; and &quot;Ziggy Pig and Silly Seal&quot;.

Jaffee originally considered himself strictly an artist until he was disabused of the notion by editors and art directors who were reviewing his portfolio. &quot;When prospective clients laughed and asked &#x27;Who wrote the gag?&#x27; my response was &#x27;I did, sir.&#x27; Which was very confusing since I didn&#x27;t realize any writing had taken place. I mean, writers used typewriters, smoked pipes, wore scarves, right? When enough of them said, &#x27;Oh, then you&#x27;re a writer too,&#x27; I took their word for it. Who was I to argue with prospective employers?&quot;

Jaffee served in the U.S. Army during World War II, where he worked as an artist for the military in various capabilities. His work included the original floor plan for the Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine. During this time, he took advantage of the military&#x27;s free name change service, first to &quot;Alvin Jaffe&quot; by mistake, then to &quot;Allan Jaffee&quot;. While working at the Pentagon, he met Ruth Ahlquist, whom he married in 1945.

In 1946, Jaffee returned to civilian life, working for Stan Lee. For approximately a year and a half in the late 1940s, Jaffee was editing Timely&#x27;s humor and teenage comics, including the &quot;Patsy Walker&quot; line.

Jaffee recalled in a 2004 interview:

From 1957 to 1963, Jaffee drew the elongated &quot;Tall Tales&quot; panel for the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;, which was syndicated to over 100 newspapers. Jaffee credited its middling success with a pantomime format that was easy to sell abroad, but his higher-ups were unsatisfied with the strip&#x27;s status: &quot;The head of the syndicate, who was a certifiable idiot, said the reason it was not selling [better] is we gotta put words in it. So they made me put words in it. Immediately lost 28 foreign papers.&quot; A collection of Jaffee&#x27;s &quot;Tall Tales&quot; strips was published in 2008. Jaffee also scripted the short-lived strips &quot;Debbie Deere&quot; and &quot;Jason&quot; in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Since 1984, Jaffee has provided illustrations for &quot;The Shpy&quot;, a lighthearted Jewish-themed adventure feature in Tzivos Hashem&#x27;s bimonthly children&#x27;s publication &quot;The Moshiach Times&quot;.

===&quot;Mad&quot;===

Jaffee first appeared in &quot;Mad&quot; in 1955, one issue after its transformation from comic book format to magazine. When editor Harvey Kurtzman left in a dispute three issues later, Jaffee went with Kurtzman. Jaffee contributed to Kurtzman&#x27;s first two post-&quot;Mad&quot; publishing efforts, &quot;Trump&quot; and the creator-owned &quot;Humbug&quot;, though both were much less successful than Mad. In 2008, the first full reprint of &quot;Humbug&quot; was published as a two-volume set by Fantagraphics; the set includes a newly commissioned cover illustration by Jaffee, and a co-interview with Jaffee and Arnold Roth.

After &quot;Humbug&quot; folded in 1958, Jaffee brought his unpublished material to &quot;Mad&quot;, which bought the work. &quot;Bill Gaines took out every &quot;Trump&quot; and &quot;Humbug&quot;,&quot; remembered Jaffee, &quot;called me into his office, sat me down on the couch next to him, and went over every issue and said &quot;Which is yours?&quot; And as he came to each one, when he saw my stuff, he OK&#x27;d to hire me.&quot;

====The Fold-In====

In issue #86 of 1964, Jaffee created his longest-running &quot;Mad&quot; feature, the Fold-In. In each, a drawing is folded vertically and inward to reveal a new &quot;hidden&quot; picture (as well as a new caption). Originally, Jaffee intended it as a one-shot &quot;cheap&quot; satire of the triple fold-outs that were appearing in glossy magazines such as &quot;Playboy&quot;, &quot;National Geographic&quot;, and &quot;Life&quot;. But Jaffee was asked to do a second installment, and soon the Fold-In became a recurring feature on the inside back cover of the magazine. In 2011, Jaffee reflected, &quot;The thing that I got a kick out of was ... &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; showed a Fold-In and the contestants all came up with the word they were looking for, which was &#x27;Fold-In.&#x27; So I realized, I created an English language word.&quot;

In 2010, Jaffee described the earliest Fold-Ins:
The Fold-In became one of &quot;Mad&quot;″s signature features, and it appeared in almost every issue of the magazine from 1964 to 2020. A single issue in 1977 was published without a Fold-In (though Jaffee supplied the issue&#x27;s back cover), and a 1980 issue instead featured a unique double-visual gimmick by Jaffee in which the inside back cover and the outside back cover merged to create a third image when held up to the light. The third-ever Fold-In in 1964 featured a unique diagonal folding design, rather than the standard left-right vertical format. The image revealed the four members of The Beatles becoming bald (and thus losing their popularity).

In a &quot;Mad&quot;-like wrinkle, there are two answers to the question &quot;When was Jaffee&#x27;s last Fold-in?&quot; The final one he designed appeared in the June 2019 issue. But his last Fold-in to be published, a personal farewell to readers, appeared in the August 2020 issue. Jaffee had prepared it six years in advance, to be published after his own death. Instead, it ran after he officially announced his retirement at the age of 99, as the conclusion of an &quot;All Jaffee&quot; tribute issue. Cartoonist Johnny Sampson succeeded Jaffee on the feature.

&quot;The Far Side&quot; creator Gary Larson described his experience with the Fold-In: &quot;The dilemma was always this: Very slowly and carefully fold the back cover ... &quot;without&quot; creasing the page and quickly look at the joke. Jaffee&#x27;s artistry &quot;before&quot; the folding was so amazing that I suspect I was not alone in not wanting to deface it in any way.&quot; In 1972, Jaffee received a Special Features Reuben Award for his Fold-Ins.

Jaffee used a computer only for typographic maneuvers to make certain Fold-In tricks easier to design and he typically took two weeks to sketch and finalize an image. Otherwise, all his work was done by hand. &quot;I&#x27;m working on a hard, flat board ... I cannot fold it. That&#x27;s why my planning has to be so correct.&quot; In 2008, Jaffee told one newspaper, &quot;I never see the finished painting folded until it&#x27;s printed in the magazine. I guess I have that kind of visual mind where I can see the two sides without actually putting them together.&quot; Contrasting current art techniques and Jaffee&#x27;s approach, &quot;Mad&quot;″s art director, Sam Viviano, said, &quot;I think part of the brilliance of the Fold-In is lost on the younger generations who are so used to Photoshop and being able to do stuff like that on a computer.&quot;

===21st century===
Until 2019, Jaffee continued to do the Fold-In for &quot;Mad&quot;, as well as additional artwork for articles. His last original Fold-In appeared in the June 2019 issue, which was one that had originally been rejected from the June 2013 issue due to sensitivity about gun violence. Since August 2019, &quot;Mad&quot; has been either reprinting old Fold-Ins or publishing new ones by Johnny Sampson. In December 2019, Al&#x27;s original work was featured in the magazine for the last time. &quot;Mad&quot;″s oldest regular contributor, Jaffee&#x27;s work appeared in 500 of the magazine&#x27;s first 550 issues, a total unmatched by any other writer or artist. He said, &quot;I work for a magazine that&#x27;s essentially for young people, and to have them keep me going, I feel very lucky ... To use an old cliché, I&#x27;m like an old racehorse. When the other horses are running, I want to run too.&quot; He retains the record for being longest tenured contributor to the history of Mad magazine.

In August 2008, Jaffee was interviewed for an NY1 feature about his career. He said, &quot;It astonishes me that I still am functioning at a fairly decent level. Because there were a lot of dark days, but you have to reinvent yourself. You get knocked down and you pick up yourself and you move on.&quot;

A four-volume hardcover boxed set, &quot;The Mad Fold-In Collection: 1964–2010&quot;, was published by Chronicle Books in September 2011, .

Jaffee announced in June 2020 that he would be retiring. To honor this, &quot;Mad&quot; published a tribute issue that month.

===Frequent themes===

Will Forbis wrote: &quot;This is the core of Jaffee&#x27;s work: the idea that to be alive is to be constantly beleaguered by annoying idiots, poorly designed products and the unapologetic ferocity of fate. Competence and intelligence are not rewarded in life but punished.&quot; In the book &quot;Inside Mad&quot;, fellow &quot;Mad&quot; writer Desmond Devlin called Jaffee &quot;the irreplaceable embodiment of &quot;Mad Magazine&quot;″s range: smart but silly, angry but understanding, sophisticated but gross, upbeat but hopeless. ... He&#x27;s uncommonly interested in figuring out how things work, and exasperated because things NEVER work.&quot;

Jaffee contributed to hundreds of &quot;Mad&quot; articles as either a writer or an artist and often both. These included his long-running &quot;Snappy Answers to Stupid Questions&quot;, which present multiple putdowns for the same unnecessary or clueless inquiry, and several articles on inventions and gadgets, which were presented in an elaborately detailed &quot;blueprint&quot; style. Sergio Aragonés said of Jaffee, &quot;He is brilliant at many things, but especially inventions. When he draws a machine for &quot;Mad&quot;, no matter how silly the idea, it always looks like it works. He thinks that way because he is not only an artist, but a technician as well ... He is the guy who can do anything.&quot; In a patent file for a self-extinguishing cigarette, the inventor thanked Jaffee for providing the inspiration. Other actual inventions that have since come to pass had appeared earlier in Jaffee articles, such as telephone redial and address books (1961), snowboarding (1965), the computer spell-checker (1967), peelable stamps, multi-blade razors (1979), and graffiti-proof building surfaces (1982). &quot;I could imagine those things,&quot; Jaffee told an interviewer. &quot;I never had the problem of trying to figure out how to manufacture them.&quot;

During the Vietnam War, Jaffee also created the short-lived gag cartoon &quot;Hawks &amp; Doves&quot;, in which a military officer named Major Hawks is antagonized by Private Doves, an easygoing soldier who contrives to create surreptitious peace signs in various locations on a military base. In a 1998 issue, all the &quot;Hawks &amp; Doves&quot; strips were republished, along with an original strip in color on the back of the issue.

Some of Jaffee&#x27;s features were expanded into stand-alone books, including a 1997 collection of Fold-Ins titled &quot;Fold This Book!&quot; and eight &quot;Snappy Answers&quot; paperbacks. Referring to the latter, Jaffee said, &quot;I was going through a divorce when I started that. I got a lot of my hostility out through Snappy Answers.&quot;

==Techniques and materials==
When designing his &quot;Mad&quot; Fold-Ins, Jaffee started with the finished &quot;answer&quot; to the Fold-In, and then spread it apart and placed a piece of tracing paper over it in order to fill in the center &quot;throw-away&quot; aspect of the image, which is covered up when the page is folded over, using regular pencil at this stage. Jaffee would then trace the image onto another piece of illustration board using carbon paper. At this stage he used red or green color pencils, which were distinct from the black pencil of the original drawing, in order to discern his progress. Once the image was on the illustration board, he would then finish it by painting it. Because the illustration board was too stiff to fold, Jaffee did not see the finished Fold-In image until it was published.

==Awards and recognition==
Jaffee won the National Cartoonists Society Advertising and Illustration Award for 1973, its Special Features Award for 1971 and 1975, and its Humor Comic Book Award for 1979. In 2008, he won the Reuben Awards&#x27; Cartoonist of the Year.

In 2005, the production company Motion Theory created a video for recording artist Beck&#x27;s song &quot;Girl&quot; using Jaffee&#x27;s &quot;Mad&quot; Fold-Ins as inspiration; Jaffee&#x27;s name appears briefly in the video, on a television screen.

The March 13, 2006, episode of &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; aired on Jaffee&#x27;s 85th birthday, and comedian Stephen Colbert saluted the artist with a Fold-In birthday cake. The cake featured the salutary message &quot;Al, you have repeatedly shown artistry &amp; care of great credit to your field.&quot; When the center section of the cake was removed, the remainder read, &quot;Al, you are old.&quot;

 AL, | |
 YOU| HAVE REPEATEDLY SHOWN |
 A|RTISTRY &amp; CA|RE
 O|F GREAT CREDIT TO YOUR FIE|LD

That was not Jaffee&#x27;s first interaction with the comedian. In 2010, he recalled:

In October 2011 Jaffee was presented with the Sergio Award at a banquet in his honor from the Comic Art Professional Society.

In July 2013, during San Diego Comic-Con, Jaffee was one of six inductees into the Will Eisner Hall of Fame. Jaffee, who worked for Eisner in his studio for one of his earliest jobs, was not present during the convention, and the award was accepted by &quot;Mad&quot; art director Sam Viviano, who presented it to Jaffee at a later date. The other inductees were Lee Falk, Mort Meskin, Spain Rodriguez, Joe Sinnott, and Trina Robbins. In April 2014, Jaffee was elected to the Society of Illustrators&#x27; Hall of Fame.

In October 2013, Columbia University announced that Jaffee had donated most of his archives to the college.

On March 30, 2016, it was officially declared that Jaffee had &quot;the longest career as a comics artist&quot; at &quot;73 years, 3 months&quot; by &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;. &quot;Guinness&quot; noted that he had worked continuously, beginning with Jaffee&#x27;s contribution to the December 1942 issue of &quot;Joker Comics&quot; and continuing through the April 2016 issue of &quot;Mad&quot;.

Mary-Lou Weisman, a friend of Jaffee for more than three decades, wrote a profile of him for &quot;Provincetown Arts&quot;, which she later expanded into the biography, &quot;Al Jaffee&#x27;s Mad Life&quot;, published in 2010 by It Books, an imprint of HarperCollins. In addition to reprints of his past work, Jaffee tells his life story to Weisman in an interview style.

==Personal life==
Jaffee married Ruth Ahlquist in 1945; they had two children, Richard and Debbie. They divorced in 1967. After the divorce, Gaines provided Jaffee with studio space at the &quot;Mad&quot; offices.

His oldest younger brother Harry Jaffee (1922–1985), who also had artistic talent, had long been coping with various illnesses—for a time he had been committed to Bellevue Hospital Center. Harry had been living with the Jaffees at the time. After the divorce, Jaffee took two apartments in Manhattan, one for him, and one nearby for Harry. Jaffee also hired him from 1970 to 1977 to do his background detail and lettering. Harry quit upon Jaffee&#x27;s remarriage.

In 1977, Jaffee married Joyce Revenson, a widow. They lived in Manhattan, summered in Provincetown, Massachusetts, and wintered in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. Joyce died in January 2020.

Jaffee died of organ failure on April 10, 2023, at a Manhattan hospital. He was 102.

<doc id="154393" wikidata="Q639974" url="?curid=154393" title="Ardooie">
<text>Ardooie (; ) is a municipality in the Belgian province of West Flanders. The municipality comprises the towns of Ardooie proper and Koolskamp. In 2006 Ardooie had a total population of 9,147. The local inhabitants are called Ardooienaren. During the First World War Hitler was stationed in Ardooie quartered with a family. He painted some of the buildings and the countryside.

==Sights==
* St. Martin&#x27;s Church (&quot;Sint-Martinuskerk&quot;) with a Gothic tower, listed since 1939 as part of the national monumental heritage;
* the mansion &quot;de Mûelenaere&quot;, today a library;
* Ardooie Castle, also known as the De Jonghe d&#x27;Ardoye Castle ( or &quot;Kasteel De Jonghe d&#x27;Ardoye&quot;): this Neo-Classical country house was built at the end of the 18th century by the local landowners, the Van Ardooie family, who also called themselves as D&#x27;Ardoye. It became a protected historical monument in 1984, housing a communication agency since 2007. The building and most of the grounds remain private property.
* a brewery-complex from the 19th century;
* the Rysselende Mill, constructed in 1855.

==Hamlets==

Next to Ardooie itself is the part-municipality Koolskamp. Part of Ardooie is also the hamlet De Tassche, about two kilometers west from the centre of Ardooie, on the border with the city of Roeselare. In the east on the border with the neighbouring municipality Meulebeke, part of the hamlet &#x27;t Veld, also called de Sneppe, is situated in Ardooie.

Ardooie is adjacent to the following villages:
*a. Lichtervelde (Lichtervelde municipality)
*b. Zwevezele (Wingene municipality)
*c. Egem (Pittem municipality)
*d. Pittem (Pittem municipality)
*e. Meulebeke (Meulebeke municipality)
*f. Emelgem (Izegem city)
*g. Kachtem (Izegem city)
*h. Roeselare (Roeselare city)
*i. Beveren (Roeselare city)

==Accessibility==
*The motorway E403 runs through the west of the village and has two exits, one for Ardooie itself (exit 8) and one for the part-municipality Koolskamp (exit 9). On the other side of the village runs the N50 district road from Bruges to Kortrijk (the Rysselende Mill is built by this road).

Ardooie is separated from Koolskamp by the railway line Adinkerke-Ghent. Until the mid-1980s years Ardooie had two NMBS- railway stations: one in the north of the main village and one on the quarter &quot;De Kortekeer&quot;.

==Industry==
Although the village is quite small, many companies have their head-office here. It is best known for its frozen vegetables factories, seven in total, the highest number for a single municipality in Europe.

The major companies in Ardooie are:

* Afschrift, industrial electricity and automation
* Ardicor, inhouse (de)construction
* Ardo (formerly Ardovries), frozen foods
* Ardovlam, protection against fire and burglary in buildings
* d&#x27;Arta, frozen vegetables
* Danis, in Koolskamp, producer of animal foods and specialising in construction of pig-sties
* Devriese, road construction

<text>Tielt (; ) is a Belgian city and municipality in the province of West Flanders. The municipality comprises the town of Tielt proper and the villages of Aarsele, Kanegem, and Schuiferskapelle.

==History==

Some traces of Gallo-Roman occupation have been found in this area. The region was invaded by the Viking Rikiwulf of the Wulfing dynasty in 880 AD, who built Rikiwulfinga-haim, which survives as the Rijkegem-kouter today. The first written mention of &quot;Tiletum&quot;, dates from 1105, when Baldric of Noyon, Bishop of Tournai, awarded the right of presentment for the parish church to the chapter of St Salvator in Harelbeke. In 1245, Margaret of Constantinople, Countess of Flanders gave the city its charter and decided to found a hospital here. A few years later, a market place and cloth hall were built as well. Like neighbouring Roeselare, Tielt was made part of the Kortrijk province of Flanders. In the 13th and 14th century, the economy of most Flemish cities was based on the cloth industry, while the rural areas lived on the products of agriculture.

In 1393, Philip the Bold decided to hold an annual fair in Tielt, which resulted in the city becoming the booming centre of the flax industry until the end of the 16th century. The following decades, however, were hard on Tielt as it suffered two major fires and a couple of epidemics, including the plague. Tielt also went through a severe famine at the end of the 17th century. From about 1700 until the Belgian Revolution of 1830, the city prospered again, this time as a regional center for the construction industry.

During World War I, the city became the headquarters for the German army. The bombing of the Second World War was a lot more destructive. Most of the city centre had to be rebuilt. Today Tielt is a typical province town, which offers commercial, medical and educational services to the surrounding region.

==Economy==
Industries:
* Seyntex, textile manufacturer
* Mistubishi Chemical Advanced Materials
* Balta Tielt
Media:
* Lannoo, publishing group

==Sights==
*The Belfry (&quot;Hallentoren&quot;), Cloth Hall, and Aldermen&#x27;s Chamber are classified by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site because of their architecture and civic importance in the Middle Ages, Renaissance, and Baroque periods.
*The city also houses some interesting churches such as Saint-Peter&#x27;s.
*From Tielt, there are several strolling and biking paths that allow the visitor to discover the region and see some of the windmills that still dot the landscape.

==Festivities==
Every year, on the first week-end of July, the city celebrates the &quot;Europafeesten&quot; (feast of Europe). This is the occasion for a &quot;braderie&quot; (a street clearance sale), street theatre, a blues festival, fireworks and expanded café terraces for further merriment.

==People born in Tielt==
*Olivier Le Daim, originally de Neckere a 15th-century barber and valet to Louis XI, known in France as Olivier le Mauvais
*Josse Ravesteyn, 16th-century theologian
*Godfried Danneels, cardinal in the Roman Catholic Church
*Briek Schotte, two-time World Champion cyclist

<text>Contemporary Christian music (CCM), also known as Christian pop, and occasionally inspirational music, is a genre of modern popular music, and an aspect of Christian media, which is lyrically focused on matters related to the Christian faith and stylistically rooted in Christian music. Originating in the United States, it was formed by those affected by the 1960s Jesus movement revival who began to express themselves in other styles of popular music, beyond the church music of hymns, gospel and Southern gospel music that was prevalent in the church at the time. Initially referred to as Jesus music, today, the term is typically used to refer to pop, but also includes rock, alternative rock, hip hop, metal, contemporary worship, punk, hardcore punk, Latin, electronic dance music, R&amp;B-influenced gospel, and country styles.

After originating in the US, it has since become a globally recognized style of popular music. It has representation on several music charts, including &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Christian Albums, Christian Songs, Hot Christian AC (Adult Contemporary), Christian CHR, Soft AC/Inspirational, and Christian Digital Songs as well as the UK&#x27;s Official Christian &amp; Gospel Albums Chart. Top-selling CCM artists will also appear on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. In the iTunes Store, the genre is represented as part of the Christian and gospel genre while the Google Play Music system labels it as Christian/Gospel.

== History ==
=== Beginnings (1950s–1960s) ===
The growing popularity of rock and roll music in the 1950s was initially dismissed by the church because it was believed to encourage sinfulness. Yet as evangelical churches adapted to appeal to more people, the musical styles used in worship changed as well by adopting the sounds of this popular style.

The genre became known as contemporary Christian music as a result of the Jesus movement revival in the latter 1960s and early 1970s, and was originally called Jesus music. &quot;About that time, many young people from the sixties&#x27; counterculture professed to believe in Jesus. Convinced of the &quot;bareness&quot; of a lifestyle based on drugs, free sex and &quot;radical politics&quot;, some of the Jesus &#x27;hippies&#x27; became known as &#x27;Jesus people&#x27;&quot;. It was during the 1970s Jesus movement that Christian music started to become an industry within itself. &quot;Jesus music&quot; started by playing instruments and singing songs about love and peace, which then translated into love of God. Paul Wohlegemuth, who wrote the book &quot;Rethinking Church Music&quot;, said &quot;[the] 1970s will see a marked acceptance of rock-influenced music in all levels of church music. The rock style will become more familiar to all people, its rhythmic excesses will become refined, and its earlier secular associations will be less remembered.&quot;

Evangelical artists made significant contributions to CCM in the 1960s, developing various Christian music styles, from Christian rock to Christian hip-hop passing through the Christian punk or the Christian metal. Those involved were affected by the late 1960s to early 1970s Jesus movement, whose adherents colloquially called themselves the &quot;Jesus Freaks&quot;, as an Evangelical Christian response to the counterculture movements such as hippies and flower children who were finding widespread traction. The Calvary Chapel was one such response, which launched Maranatha Music in 1971. They soon began to express themselves in alternative styles of popular music and worship music. The &quot;Dove Awards&quot;, an annual ceremony which rewards Christian music, was created in Memphis, Tennessee in October 1969 by the &quot;Gospel Music Association&quot;.

There was some internal critique of CCM at its advent. The Christian college Bob Jones University discourages its dormitory students from listening to CCM.

Larry Norman is often remembered as the &quot;father of Christian rock&quot;, because of his early contributions (before the Jesus movement) to the developing new genre that mixed rock rhythms with the Christian messages. Though his style was not initially well received by many in the Christian community of the time, he continued throughout his career to create controversial hard-rock songs such as &quot;Why Should the Devil Have All the Good Music?&quot;. He is remembered as the artist &quot;who first combined rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll with Christian lyrics&quot; in the Gospel Music Hall of Fame. Though there were Christian albums in the 1960s that contained contemporary-sounding songs, there were two albums recorded in 1969 that are considered to be the first complete albums of &quot;Jesus rock&quot;: &quot;Upon This Rock&quot; (1969) by Larry Norman initially released on Capitol Records, and &quot;Mylon – We Believe&quot; by Mylon LeFevre, released by Cotillion, which was LeFevre&#x27;s attempt at blending gospel music with southern rock. Unlike traditional or southern gospel music, this new Jesus music was birthed out of rock and folk music.

Pioneers of this movement also included Andraé Crouch and the Disciples, the Imperials, Michael Omartian, 2nd Chapter of Acts, Phil Keaggy, Love Song, Barry McGuire, Evie, Paul Clark, Randy Matthews, Randy Stonehill and Keith Green among others. The small Jesus music culture had expanded into a multimillion-dollar industry by the 1980s. Many CCM artists such as Benny Hester, Amy Grant, DC Talk, Michael W. Smith, Stryper, and Jars of Clay found crossover success with Top 40 mainstream radio play.

=== Popularity (1970s–1990s) ===
The genre emerged and became prevalent in the 1970s and 1980s. Beginning in July 1978, &quot;CCM Magazine&quot; began covering &quot;contemporary Christian music&quot; artists and a wide range of spiritual themes until it launched online publications in 2009.

It has certain themes and messages behind the songs and their lyrics, including praise and worship, faith, encouragement, and prayer. These songs also focus on themes of devotion, inspiration, redemption, reconciliation, and renewal. Many people listen to contemporary Christian music for comfort through tough times. The lyrics and messages conveyed in CCM songs have had varied, positive Christian messages over the decades. For instance, some of the songs have been aimed to evangelize and some of the lyrics are meant to praise and worship Jesus. One of the earliest goals of CCM was to spread the news of Jesus to non-Christians. In addition, contemporary Christian music also strengthens the faith of Christians.

Various evangelical record labels have supported the movement. In Christian rock, there is &quot;Sparrow Records&quot; founded in 1976 in the United States by Billy Ray Hearn, a Christian music graduate from the Baylor University. The songs of &quot;Hillsong Music&quot;, founded in 1991 by Hillsong Church, in Sydney, Australia, have been translated into various languages and have had an influence considerable in evangelical churches worldwide.

In Christian hip-hop, TobyMac, Todd Collins, and Joey Elwood founded the first specialized label &quot;Gotee Records&quot; in 1994. The founding of the label &quot;Reach Records&quot; in 2004 by Lecrae and Ben Washer also had a significant impact in the development of Christian hip-hop.

Contemporary Christian musicians and listeners have sought to extend their music into settings where religious music traditionally might not be heard. For instance, MercyMe&#x27;s song &quot;I Can Only Imagine&quot; was a crossover success in 1999 despite having a clear Christian message. In 2018, Lauren Daigle&#x27;s &#x27;You Say&#x27; was a similar hit.

According to a 2009 study published by Faith Communities Today, 64% of churches that adopted contemporary Christian music in the past five years saw an increase in service attendance of 2% or more.

=== Modernity ===
Contemporary Christian music has influences from folk, gospel, pop and rock music. Genres of music such as soft rock, folk rock, alternative, hip-hop, etc. have played a large influence on CCM.

Charismatic churches have had a large influence on contemporary Christian music and are one of the largest producers of CCM. Contemporary Christian music has also expanded into many subgenres. Christian punk, Christian hardcore, Christian metal, and Christian hip hop, although not normally considered CCM, can also come under the genre&#x27;s umbrella. Contemporary worship music is also incorporated in modern CCM. Contemporary worship is both recorded and performed during church services.

In the 2000s, contemporary worship music with a distinctly theological focus has emerged, primarily in the Baptist, Reformed and more traditional non-denominational branches of Protestant Christianity. Artists include well-known groups such as Shane &amp; Shane and modern hymn-writers, Keith &amp; Kristyn Getty as well as others like Sovereign Grace Music, Matt Boswell and Aaron Keyes. The format is gaining traction in many churches and other areas in culture as well as being heard in CCM collections &amp; musical algorithms on several Internet streaming services.

According to a 2023 study by Worship Leader Research, of the top 25 most popular song licenses used by churches between 2010 and 2020, nearly 100% came from 3 megachurch music groups; Hillsong Worship (Hillsong Church), Bethel Music (Bethel Church), and Elevation Worship (Elevation Church). 

== Controversy ==
Brian Schwertley of the Reformed Presbyterian tradition wrote in 2001 that the inclusion of CCM in a worship service violates the second commandment and the regulative principle of worship because it adds man-made inventions, lyrics, and instrumental music to the biblically appointed way of worshipping God.

&quot;The responsibility of the church is not to provide escape from reality&quot;, according to Donald Ellsworth, the author of &quot;Christian Music in Contemporary Witness&quot;, &quot;but to give answers to contemporary problems through legitimate, biblical means&quot;.

According to &quot;Vice&quot; magazine, CCM &quot;has often functioned as a propaganda wing of the Christian right&quot;, presenting views on topics such as the war on drugs, Christian nationalism, mission trips, school prayer, and the LGBT community.

=== Label rejection ===
Several high-profile bands have rejected the label &quot;Christian music&quot;, such as Needtobreathe and Mutemath, with the latter suing their record label over being marketed as such. Of the categorization, Needtobreathe said to Rolling Stone: &quot;Any label is limiting. That one in particular is especially limiting. To me, I think people pass over the band all the time because they read that...I hate the idea that they somehow feel like I didn&#x27;t make the music for them, that we didn&#x27;t play music for everyone. Christian record deals came and we said no to all of them. Waited a couple years until the right record deal came, which was Atlantic, which we&#x27;ve been on ever since. But we just said to them in passing when we first started, we want the records to be available to everyone.&quot;

== Growth ==
Contemporary Christian album sales had increased from 31 million in 1996 to 44 million sales in 2000. Since EMI&#x27;s purchase of Sparrow Records in 1996, sales had increased 100 percent. Overall, CCM sales in 2014 had dropped to 17 million in sales.

<doc id="154406" wikidata="Q147114" url="?curid=154406" title="Procyonidae">
<text>Procyonidae ( ) is a New World family of the order Carnivora. It includes the raccoons, ringtails, cacomistles, coatis, kinkajous, olingos, and olinguitos. Procyonids inhabit a wide range of environments and are generally omnivorous.

==Characteristics==
Procyonids are relatively small animals, with generally slender bodies and long tails, though the common raccoon tends to be bulky. 

Because of their general build, the Procyonidae are often popularly viewed as smaller cousins of the bear family. This is apparent in their German name, &quot;Kleinbären&quot; (small bears), including the names of the species: a raccoon is called a &quot;Waschbär&quot; (washing bear, as it &quot;washes&quot; its food before eating), a coati is a &quot;Nasenbär&quot; (nose-bear), while a kinkajou is a &quot;Honigbär&quot; (honey-bear). Dutch follows suit, calling the animals &quot;wasbeer&quot;, &quot;neusbeer&quot; and &quot;rolstaartbeer&quot; (curl-tail bear) respectively. However, it is now believed that procyonids are more closely related to mustelids than to bears. Procyonids share common morphological characteristics including a shortened rostrum, absent alisphenoid canals, and a relatively flat mandibular fossa. Kinkajous have unique morphological characteristics consistent with their arboreally adapted locomotion, including a prehensile tail and unique femoral structure.

Due to their omnivorous diet, procyonids have lost some of the adaptations for flesh-eating found in their carnivorous relatives. While they do have carnassial teeth, these are poorly developed in most species, especially the raccoons. Apart from the kinkajou, procyonids have the dental formula: for a total of 40 teeth. The kinkajou has one fewer premolar in each row: for a total of 36 teeth.

Most members of Procyonidae are solitary; however, some species form groups. Coati females will form bands of 4 to 24 individuals that forage together, while kinkajous have been found to form social groups of two males and one female. Certain procyonids give birth to one offspring like ringtails, olingos, and kinkajous while raccoons and coatis give birth to litters that range in size from 2 to 6 offspring.

===Evolution===

Procyonid fossils once believed to belong to the genus &quot;Bassariscus&quot;, which includes the modern ringtail and cacomistle, have been identified from the Miocene epoch, around 20 million years (Ma) ago. It has been suggested that early procyonids were an offshoot of the canids that adapted to a more omnivorous diet. The recent evolution of procyonids has been centered on Central America (where their diversity is greatest); they entered the formerly isolated South America as part of the Great American Interchange, beginning about 7.3 Ma ago in the late Miocene, with the appearance of &quot;Cyonasua&quot;. Some fossil procyonids such as &quot;Stromeriella&quot; were also present in the Old World, before going extinct in the Pliocene.

Genetic studies have shown that kinkajous are a sister group to all other extant procyonids; they split off about 22.6 Ma ago. The clades leading to coatis and olingos on one branch, and to ringtails and raccoons on the other, separated about 17.7 Ma ago. The divergence between olingos and coatis is estimated to have occurred about 10.2 Ma ago, at about the same time that ringtails and raccoons parted ways. The separation between coatis and mountain coatis is estimated to have occurred 7.7 Ma ago.

==Classification==

There has been considerable historical uncertainty over the correct classification of several members. The red panda was previously classified in this family, but it is now classified in its own family, the Ailuridae, based on molecular biology studies. The status of the various olingos was disputed: some regarded them all as subspecies of &quot;Bassaricyon gabbii&quot; before DNA sequence data demonstrated otherwise.

The traditional classification scheme shown below on the left predates the recent revolution in our understanding of procyonid phylogeny based on genetic sequence analysis. This outdated classification groups kinkajous and olingos together on the basis of similarities in morphology that are now known to be an example of parallel evolution; similarly, coatis are shown as being most closely related to raccoons, when in fact they are closest to olingos. Below right is a cladogram showing the results of molecular studies . Genus &quot;Nasuella&quot; was not included in these studies, but in a separate study was found to nest within &quot;Nasua&quot;.

<doc id="154409" wikidata="Q674954" url="?curid=154409" title="De Panne">
<text>De Panne (; ) is a town and a municipality located on the North Sea coast of the Belgian province of West Flanders. There it borders France, making it the westernmost town in Belgium. It is one of the most popular resort town destinations within Belgium. The municipality includes the village of Adinkerke. On 1 January 2011, De Panne had a total population of 10,748 on a total area of 23.90 km2, which gives a population density of 449.7 inhabitants per km2.

==Miscellaneous==

Famous people who have lived or died in De Panne include King Albert I and Queen Elisabeth, and John Aidan Liddell, VC, who died in De Panne in August 1915. The Belgian royal family lived in De Panne during the First World War because it was located in the tiny fraction of their country that was not conquered by the Germans.

De Panne is home to Plopsaland, a theme park aimed at young children and located on the former grounds of Meli Park. De Panne was also the place where the first land yachts intended for sport were built and used by the Dumont brothers in 1898. On 17 July 1831, Leopold I, the first Belgian king, sailed to Calais from England, and arrived in Belgium in De Panne. The Leopold I Esplanade, which includes a statue of him, commemorates his arrival.

Since 1977, the town has hosted the Three Days of De Panne cycle race, which is held in the run up to, and traditionally used by riders as preparation for the Tour of Flanders.

De Panne was the site of a Belgium-England undersea telephone line laid by Siemens before the war, and therefore was used as Gort&#x27;s headquarters for the evacuation of nearby Dunkirk to allow contact with England.

==Transport==
De Panne Railway Station is located in nearby Adinkerke. There are regular NMBS trains to Brussels. The line across the border to Dunkirk is out of use. DK Bus run buses from the station forecourt to Gare de Dunkerque. A cross-border campaign group Trekhaak-73 is seeking to re-open the railway line.

==Belgian Military Cemetery of De Panne==
The cemetery is located at Kerkstraat 69 in De Panne, 1 km south of the church. Besides Belgian soldiers who died in the First World War there are also British soldiers who died in the Second World War. 3,744 soldiers have been buried here. Nearby is Adinkerke Military Cemetery.

<text>Nieuwpoort ( , ; ; ) is a city and municipality located in Flanders, one of the three regions of Belgium, in the province of West Flanders. The municipality comprises the town of Nieuwpoort proper, as well as Ramskapelle and Sint-Joris. On 1 January 2008, Nieuwpoort had a total population of 11,062. Its land area is 31.00 km² which gives a population density of 350 inhabitants per km². The current mayor of Nieuwpoort is Geert Vanden Broucke (CD&amp;V)

In Nieuwpoort, the Yser flows into the North Sea. It was also the home of a statue created by Jan Fabre called &quot;Searching for Utopia&quot;. The Stadshalle Grain Hall (market hall) with its belfry was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1999 as part of the Belfries of Belgium and France site, owing to its historical civic (not religious) importance and its architecture. 

==History==

It obtained city rights in 1163 from Count Philip of Flanders. The Battle of Nieuwpoort, between the Dutch and the Spanish, happened here in 1600. The city was a Dunkirker base. Painter Victor Boucquet made two of the altar-pieces for the great church in the 17th century. In 1671, Antonio Vélaz de Medrano, 1st Marquess of Tabuérniga became governor of the city.

The city was occupied by French forces for six years between 1757 and 1763, as part of the conditions of the Second Treaty of Versailles between France and Austria. A large waterworks infrastructure project called the &quot;Ganzepoot&quot; (&quot;goose foot&quot;, in Dutch) was constructed in Nieuwpoort in the 19th century to drain the polders and channel water in and around the town and to the North Sea.


During the Battle of the Yser, part of the First Battle of Ypres in World War I, Hendrik Geeraert opened the sluice gates on the mouth of the river Yser twice to flood the lower lying land, thus halting the German advance. Two World War I monuments, the Nieuport Memorial and King Albert I Memorial, are in close proximity of the Ganzepoot.

==Towns==
The old city centre of Nieuwpoort is located about three kilometers from the coast. Close to the sea, a new tourist centre has developed. Both parts form one contiguous built up area, connected by buildings along the Albert I Laan street and the fishing port. Besides Nieuwpoort proper, two small villages in the Flemish polders are part of the municipality, Sint-Joris and Ramskapelle.
Nieuwpoort is located by the sea. At the coastal line, it borders the municipalities Koksijde at its town Oostduinkerke and Middelkerke at its town Lombardsijde. Because the territory of the town of Ramskapelle expands far inland, Nieuwpoort has a large number of neighbouring towns, most of which are part of 2 large municipalities:

*a. Lombardsijde (Middelkerke)
*b. Westende (Middelkerke)
*c. Slijpe (Middelkerke)
*d. Mannekensvere (Middelkerke)
*e. Schore (Middelkerke)
*f. Pervijze (Diksmuide)
*g. Veurne
*h. Booitshoeke (Veurne)
*i. Wulpen (Koksijde)
*j. Oostduinkerke (Koksijde)


==In literature==
Part of the plot in Cecelia Holland&#x27;s historical novel &quot;The Sea Beggars&quot; is laid in Nieuwpoort, in the preliminary states of the Eighty Years&#x27; War - with the sailor protagonists feeling oppressed under the harsh Spanish rule and eventually joining the rebellious Watergeuzen.

<text>Veurne (; , ) is a city and municipality in the Belgian province of West Flanders. The municipality comprises the town of Veurne proper and the settlements of , , , , , Houtem, , , Wulveringem, and .

==History==

===Origins up to the 15th century===
Veurne, in Latin &quot;Furna&quot;, is first found in 877 as a possession of the Saint Bertin Abbey in Saint-Omer. Around 890 AD, it was noted as a successful fortification against the Viking raids. It soon was placed at the head of the castellany of Veurne, a large territory counting 42 parishes and some 8 half-independent parishes, owing allegiance to the Count of Flanders. Veurne became a city in the 12th century. During the following century, trade with England flourished. In 1270, however, the relations with England came to a standstill and the city&#x27;s economy went into a long decline; hence the nickname of the Veurne Sleepers. On August 20, 1297, the Battle of Veurne was fought in the ongoing struggle between the Flemish cities and the French king.

The gothic church of Saint Walburga and the tower of the church of Saint Nicolas, date from that period. Saint Walburga housed a chapter of canons. Saint Nicholas and Saint Denis (gone 18th century) were the two other parish churches and possessions of the Norbertine abbey of Saint Nicholas.

===15th century until the French Revolution===

The 15th century saw the construction of a new city hall, which is known today as the Pavilion of the Spanish officers, from its use in the 17th century as military headquarters. As most of the &quot;Westhoek&quot; (the Western part of the county of Flanders), the city and the neighbourghood strongly recessed during the economic and religious problems around 1566–1583. But when the town and the castellany officially got together, the town flourished, thanks to the expanding agriculture of the agrarian region.

Most of the other historic buildings date from this time, the prosperous reign of the Archdukes Albert and Isabella around 1600.

In 1644 the Capucines organised a procession. Since 1646, this procession was organised by the &quot;Sodales&quot;, a religious confraternity, that organised a crossway during Advent time, under the leadership of the Norbertine monk Jacob Clou. The hooded &quot;Sodales&quot; took a cross for penitence. This procession was expanded at the end of the 17th century with scenes from the Bible, and is the only one of his kind, remaining up to now in Flanders.

The second half of the 17th century was marked by the miseries brought to the region by Louis XIV’s wars. Vauban built heavy fortifications around the city, the outlines of which are still noticeable from the air today. Joseph II of Austria put them down and closed some of the religious institutions, putting a temporary end to the penitents’ procession, until Leopold II of Austria allowed it again in 1790. Those few cloisters that were still operating were closed at the French Revolution.

===19th and 20th century===
From the Battle of Waterloo until World War I, Veurne enjoyed a century of peace and prosperity. In 1831, Veurne was the first city to welcome Belgium&#x27;s new king, Leopold I.

During World War I, Veurne was located within the Yser pocket of Belgian resistance against the German troops. During the Battle of the Yser, the Veurne city hall became the headquarters of the Belgian troops under King Albert I and a military hospital was set up in the city. In 1920, the French President, Raymond Poincaré, came to Veurne to award the city the Croix de guerre with palm.

Veurne suffered some damage during World War II, mainly from Allied bombing but also from the strategic flooding that engulfed the whole area. Today, the city is a regional centre, which gives commercial, medical, and educational services to the surrounding communities while enjoying increasing tourist attention.

==Sights==


*Several Renaissance-style buildings, mostly built using the local light-coloured brick, adorn Veurne&#x27;s central market square. Among these are the city hall (&quot;Landhuis&quot;) and belfry, which was recognized by UNESCO as part of the Belfries of Belgium and France World Heritage Site in 1999 to highlight its historical importance in civic functions, use as a status symbol of the influence of the town, and architecture.
*The nearby church of Saint Walburga is an example of the earlier Gothic style.
*Other buildings of interest include the church of Saint Nicolas, the Spanish Pavilion, and the old meat market.
*The castle of Beauvoorde on the outskirts of town, an old manor with a collection of 17th-century furniture.
*NATO-Tower – tall, used for meteorological research and radio relay links.

==Folklore==

Béthune is located in the former province of Artois. It is situated south-east of Calais, west of Lille, and north of Paris.

==Landmarks==
Béthune is a town rich in architectural heritage and history. It has, among other features, a large paved square with shops, cafés, and a (133 steps) belfry standing in the center from the top of which the Belgian border can be seen. The chime of the belfry is composed of thirty-six bells. A belfry (French:&quot;beffroi&quot;) has stood on the site since 1346. The current belfry plays melodies every 15 minutes, including the ch&#x27;ti (regional patois) children&#x27;s lullaby &quot;min p&#x27;tit quinquin&quot; (my little darling). In 2005, the belfry was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List as part of the Belfries of Belgium and France site, because of its architecture and testimony to the rise of municipal power in Europe.

==History==
Hugh Hastings (died 1347), King Edward III of England&#x27;s captain and lieutenant in Flanders, mounted an attack and laid siege to Béthune, with a combined English and Flemish force, during a diversionary raid as part of Chevauchée of Edward III of 1346. The Flemish component proved undisciplined and the siege was abandoned in failure before the end of August.

During the War of the Spanish Succession in July–August 1710, Béthune was besieged by forces of the Grand Alliance. The town eventually surrendered after a vigorous defence conducted by Antoine de Vauban (1654–1731), a relative of the famous military engineer Vauban.
In World War I, Béthune was an important railway junction and command centre for the British Canadian Corps and Indian Expeditionary Force, as well as the 33rd Casualty Station until December 1917. It initially suffered little damage until the second phase of the Ludendorff Offensive in April 1918, when German forces reached Locon, away. On 21 May, a bombardment destroyed large parts of the town, killing more than 100 civilians. Over 3,200 casualties are buried in Béthune Town Cemetery, the Commonwealth section of which was designed by Edwin Lutyens; the majority are British (2,933) or Canadian (55), the remainder German.

Rebuilt after the war (the rebuilding of the Hôtel de Ville was completed in 1929), Béthune was badly damaged once more by air attacks and house to house fighting on 24–26 May 1940 when it was captured by the SS Panzer Division Totenkopf. The Totenkopf suffered heavy casualties and anger at their losses allegedly played a role in the Le Paradis massacre on 27 May, when 97 members of the Royal Norfolk Regiment were shot after surrendering. During the war, many townspeople were deported to work in Germany; the town was officially liberated on 4 September 1944.

==Transport==

Béthune station has seven daily TGV trains to Paris, a journey which takes 1 hour 15 minutes. There are also regular trains to Lille, Amiens, Dunkerque and several regional destinations.

Béthune is served by the Lens-Béthune bus network.

By car, Béthune is accessible from the A26 which intersects the A1 (Lille to Paris) to the south-east. By road, it is 2 hours 30 minutes from Paris, 1 hour from Calais, 30 minutes from Arras and 40 minutes from Lille. By using the Channel Tunnel and the A26, Béthune is 3 hours 30 minutes from London and 6 hours 45 minutes from Manchester. Using road connections on mainland Europe it is nearly 2 hours from Brussels, 3 hours from Aix-La-Chapelle, 3 hours from Cologne, 8 hours 30 minutes from Berlin and 3 hours 30 minutes from Amsterdam.

<doc id="154419" wikidata="Q5461" url="?curid=154419" title="Chivalry &amp; Sorcery">
<text>Chivalry &amp; Sorcery is a fantasy role-playing game (FRP) first published in 1977 by Fantasy Games Unlimited. Created by Edward E. Simbalist and Wilf K. Backhaus in 1977, &quot;Chivalry &amp; Sorcery&quot; (&quot;C&amp;S&quot;) was an early competitor to &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (&quot;D&amp;D&quot;). The designers of the game were dissatisfied with the lack of realism in &quot;D&amp;D&quot; and created a gaming system derived from it, named &quot;Chevalier&quot;. They intended to present it to Gary Gygax at Gen Con in 1977 but changed their minds once at Gen Con once they met Scott Bizar who wrote out a letter of intent. After some changes eliminated the last remnants of &quot;D&amp;D&quot; (e.g. the game contained a table of &quot;Saving-throws&quot; similar to &quot;D&amp;D&quot;), Simbalist and Backhaus published the first edition of their game, now renamed &quot;Chivalry &amp; Sorcery&quot;.

According to Michael Tresca, &quot;Chivalry &amp; Sorcery&quot; &quot;embraced a realistic approach to medieval France in the 12th century, complete with feudalism and the Catholic Church...&quot; and he noted that the game was one of the first to use the term &quot;game master&quot; and was also &quot;one of the first games to place the setting at utmost importance over the mechanics of the game.&quot; More focused on medieval chivalry than fantasy, &quot;Chivalry &amp; Sorcery&quot; had from its inception a complex set of rules.

==Editions==
=== First edition (C&amp;S1) ===
Fantasy Games Unlimited published the first edition in 1977.

The game includes rules for character creation, combat, magic, and wargames. The background is influenced by medieval France and Christianity, with Knights (tournaments, courtly love, fiefs, political influence), and a hierarchical priesthood that could perform miracles. The first edition also incorporates elements from &quot; The Lord Of The Rings&quot;, including hobbits and balrogs. These references disappeared in later editions for trademark reasons.

==== Character Creation ====
Prior to the start of the game, players each create a player character, taking note of certain details (explained below) about them.

A player randomly determines their character’s attributes, which describe the character’s proficiency in a wide variety of skills commonly used throughout gameplay. An alignment (a moral or ethical compass) is also determined for player characters.

The only part of character creation that really sets C&amp;S apart from other FRPs is the inclusion of a chance for a character to be born with a randomly determined vocation or inability within a certain role, e.g. being born a talented warrior.

==== Magic ====
The game features its own magic system. In essence, several attributes outlined throughout character creation determine how effective a character’s magic is.

====Reception====
Two reviews of &quot;Chivalry &amp; Sorcery&quot; appeared in &quot;Ares Magazine&quot;. In the inaugural issue of March 1980, Greg Costikyan gave the game an average score of 6 out of 9, saying, &quot;Although the lack of world-design rules and poor organization are sorely felt, &quot;C&amp;S&quot; remains the best full-scale complicated FRP game published to date.&quot; In the magazine&#x27;s September 1980 edition (Issue #4), Eric Goldberg liked the well-researched information on the medieval period — particularly heraldry — presented in the rules, but bemoaned the complexity, saying, &quot;The worst problem arises when the game is actually played — it can move as awkwardly as an octopus on dry land.&quot; Goldberg called the production values primitive — &quot;The text consists of reduced reproductions of typewritten pages, and the illustrations are fair to mediocre.&quot; He also found the extensive rules extremely disorganized. Although Goldberg admitted that &quot;No FRP system has since matched the quantity and quality of its technical system design&quot;, he did not recommend the game: &quot;&quot;C&amp;S&quot; is a poor game for all but the serious devotee of fantasy. It is a worthy purchase for he who wishes a reference work from which to authenticate FRP rules; it is a terrible investment for he who wishes one FRP system upon which to base a campaign.&quot;

In the October 1981 edition of &quot;The Space Gamer&quot; (Issue No. 44), Jon Tindel agreed that the rules were complex and extensive, but thought that the investment of time to learn them was worth it: &quot;It has been said that &quot;C&amp;S&quot; is unplayable, that it is better as a work of reference, but that is emphatically untrue. I know many people who play &quot;C&amp;S&quot; and enjoy the game very much [...] It all comes down to one question: are you willing to spend the time to learn the complicated rules? If you are, by all means buy &quot;C&amp;S&quot;; your reward will be many hours of joy. If you are not, stay away, it is not for you.&quot;

In the 1980 book &quot;The Complete Book of Wargames&quot;, game designer Jon Freeman thought that the game was too complex to be played, and added &quot;Even if the question of complexity were disregarded, it&#x27;s not suited for dungeon adventures of the conventional sort, and indeed the monsters and most of the fantasy material are included almost as an afterthought.&quot; He also thought the magic systems, although &quot;interesting, well researched and fairly &#x27;realistic&#x27;, [are] wildly unsuited to normal adventuring.&quot; Freeman concluded by suggesting that the game was more suitable as reference material for another role-playing game, and gave it an Overall Evaluation of &quot;Poor as a game; Excellent as a source.&quot;

In his 1990 book &quot;The Complete Guide to Role-Playing Games&quot;, game critic Rick Swan found the overly-detailed game overwhelming for most players, calling it &quot;among the most complex RPGs ever published.&quot; Swan found the magic system especially complicated and pointed out that the rules themselves warned players &quot;to think twice before choosing mages as characters. It&#x27;s a warning worth taking seriously: the &quot;C&amp;S&quot; magic system involves a mind-numbing collection of tables, formulas, and rules that could serve as a grad school text in wizardry.&quot; Swan commented that &quot;The rest of the game is equally tough, and the skimpy examples of play, poor organization, and confusing charts don&#x27;t help.&quot; Swan concluded by giving the game a rating of 2.5 out of 4, saying, &quot;For players with insatiable appetites for detail, there are few better choices than &quot;Chivalry &amp; Sorcery&quot;. The less obsessive will find &quot;C&amp;S&quot; more valuable as a source of ideas.&quot;

In a retrospective review of &quot;Chivalry &amp; Sorcery&quot; in &quot;Black Gate&quot;, James Maliszewski said &quot;Fond as I am of &quot;C&amp;S&quot;, there&#x27;s little question in my mind that those tools were often hard to use and cumbersome. Despite that, at least in the circles in which I moved, &quot;C&amp;S&quot; was very influential. I didn’t know anyone who actually &quot;played&quot; the game itself, but the &quot;ideas&quot; Backhaus and Simbalist advanced through it held a lot of power.&quot;

In his 2023 book &quot;Monsters, Aliens, and Holes in the Ground&quot;, RPG historian Stu Horvath noted, &quot;There is a beauty in complex rules, and &quot;Chivalry &amp; Sorcery&quot;″s vividly imply a world in a way that few other RPGs, then or now, manage ... All of this detail encouraged a new kind of focus on roleplaying, certainly, but one that is bogged down by the weight of its rules and their insistence on intricately simulating the world.&quot;

=== Second edition (C&amp;S2) ===
The second edition, released in 1983, was presented in a cardboard box containing three booklets of rules. There are no fundamental mechanical changes as compared with C&amp;S1, but multiple changes try to clarify or simplify some points in the rules. The medieval setting was clearly divided into three distinct periods: Early Feudal, High Chivalric Feudal, and Late Chivalric Feudal, each period having a distinct technology. For example: Heavy plate armor and two-handed swords only become available in Late Feudal (14th - 15th centuries).

====Reception====
In the October 1983 edition of &quot;White Dwarf&quot; (Issue 46), Marcus Rowland gave the improved production values of the second edition a 10 out of 10, but found various aspects were still overly complex: &quot;Overall, character generation in &quot;C&amp;S&quot; is still extremely complicated and might take inexperienced players several hours, especially if they make the fatal mistake of working in the wrong order... Skill acquisition in &quot;C&amp;S&quot; is almost indescribably complex and involves at least three distinct systems.&quot; Rowland did admit that some of the complexity allowed for unique characters. &quot;Probably the best feature of these rules is their attention to detail... expressed in such minutiae as the table used to develop the exact culinary skills, and... tables for Eye and Hair color.&quot; Rowland concluded by scoring the complexity of the game 10 out of 10 and its playability only 6 out of 10, and expressed reservations about the suitability for new gamers: 

Paul Mason reviewed &quot;Chivalry &amp; Sorcery&quot; 2nd Edition for &quot;Imagine&quot; magazine, and stated that: 

In the April 1984 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue 84), Ken Rolston found the overhauled rules of the second edition were still too complicated, saying: Rolston warns that even the revised edition still is not meant for newcomers and part-time players:

=== Third edition (C&amp;S3) ===
The game was revised and reissued in a Third Edition (dubbed &quot;The Green Book&quot;, from its color) by Highlander Designs (HD), an American publishing house founded by G. W. Thompson. The authors of the third edition were Ed Simbalist, Wilf Backhaus and G. W. Thompson. &quot;C&amp;S3&quot; features the almost complete disappearance of medieval references. The Third Edition removed the integral gritty medieval French historical and cultural background. 
&quot;C&amp;S3&quot; established a system of &quot;skills&quot; which covers all areas of the game, including fighting, magic, knowledge of geography, languages, dances and songs, and other things a person is able to do or know. The talent system (called &quot;Skills cape&quot;) uses a percentile die and a 10-sided die (D10) for all actions determined by talent; the D10 determines if the success (or failure) of talent is &quot;critical&quot; or not.

====Reception====
The reviewer from &quot;Pyramid&quot; #29 (Jan./Feb., 1998) stated that &quot;It definitely uses some modern production features (though the layout is a bit busy and plagued by typos), but the defining aspects of most &#x27;90s games - quick character generation, rules-lightness, storytelling not dice-rolling - aren&#x27;t a part of this game. Instead, &quot;C&amp;S3&quot; recalls the early days of gaming with an emphasis on rules and charts to cover just about any conceivable situation.&quot;

The core rules had several extensions, including the &quot;Knights Companion&quot;, &quot;Armorers Companion,&quot; &quot;Dwarves Companion&quot; and &quot;Elves Companion&quot;.

=== Fifth edition (C&amp;S5) ===

Britannia Game Designs Ltd. launched a Kickstarter campaign to launch the Fifth Edition of the game that successfully completed on July 31, 2019. The game shipped in February 2020.

<text>DragonQuest is a fantasy role-playing game originally published by Simulations Publications (SPI) in 1980. Where first generation fantasy role-playing games such as &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (D&amp;D) restricted players to particular character classes, &quot;DragonQuest&quot; was one of the first games to utilize a system that emphasized skills, allowing more individual customization and a wider range of options.

== System ==

=== Character generation ===
Character generation is much more involved than &quot;D&amp;D&quot;, with the player using 10 sided dice to determine everything from the character&#x27;s race to handedness to the number of points they have to distribute amongst the primary characteristics (Strength, Agility, Manual Dexterity, Magical Aptitude, Endurance, and Willpower) which determine the character&#x27;s strengths and weaknesses. Being able to control the value of these attributes allows for greater flexibility in character generation. For example, players seeking a powerful magic user can divert points to Magical Aptitude and possibly Willpower. Those seeking pure fighters can invest their points in Strength, Agility and Manual Dexterity. By carefully balancing these numbers, fighter/mages, thief/assassins, and other combinations can be devised.

=== Magic ===
The magic system in &quot;DragonQuest&quot; features distinct Magical Colleges, each with its own group of spells and rituals. Player characters who enter magical study are assumed to have apprenticed with a mage of their particular Magic College, and have learned all the basic spells and a ritual or two from their former Master. Player characters cannot change Magic Colleges in the context of game play, and so are all essentially specialists in a college of magic. Some of the Magic Colleges include: Earth Magic, Air Magic, Fire Magic, Water Magic, Illusions, Ensorcelments, Greater &amp; Lesser Summoning, and Necromantic Conjurations. The revised second edition and third edition (released by TSR) added some colleges and removed others.

Players expend fatigue points to cast spells, and must roll percentile dice to succeed. Many of the more powerful spells have a very low chance of success, and may &quot;backfire&quot; with random results (many quite unpleasant). By expending experience points, a mage may improve their ability to cast specific spells by gaining rank in them. There are also advanced spells which can be obtained from more powerful mages in one&#x27;s Magic College. This advanced knowledge may require a substantial cash payment or some kind of quest to obtain, however. Certain spells require expensive or rare elements to work properly, while the majority are merely spoken.

Specific rules exist for player Adepts to invest objects to create magic items (such as rings, amulets, weapons, etc.) for later use by themselves or other party members. Such items are also found on occasion during an expedition or exploration.

=== Skills ===

Any player character may choose to learn various skills in &quot;DragonQuest&quot;. Vocations such as Ranger, Thief, Assassin, Merchant, Courtesan, Navigator, Healer, Military Scientist, Mechanician, Beastmaster, Troubador may be acquired by expending the necessary experience points. Certain other skills, such as Stealth, Horseback Riding, reading and/or writing a Language can also be practiced and improved. Characters are not limited to any particular set of skills, and a Halfling Assassin who speaks perfect Elvish is technically possible.

Weapons are learned in much the same manner as Vocations. The limitation is that weapons have various maximum ranks (levels) which can be achieved, while other skills usually top out at rank 10. Magic spells gain improved chances of success and better strength when rank is gained in them also, and this is done on a spell-by-spell basis (e.g. character is a fire mage and has improved his skill to rank 6 in Fireball, but rank 0 in many other spells of his magic college which he considers less important).

Characters are required to spend many weeks training &quot;after&quot; an experience-generating adventure in order to increase skill levels. Weapons training typically requires the aid of a person of greater skill than the player, and hiring a weapon-master can be expensive as well. Often, a group will return to town laden with gold, only to realize that between the several months spent training (room &amp; board) and the cost of experts to assist them with training, most of the money is already spent! It is also possible that a character may actually &quot;be&quot; the expert in his/her local area, and thus might have to travel some distance to receive instruction from a person of greater ability.

=== Combat ===

&quot;DQ&quot; uses a hex grid and miniatures for combat. Unlike other systems, where the miniatures are merely placeholders, &quot;DQ&quot; requires that characters know their facing, as attacks from the flanks and rear are more effective than frontal assaults. Combat takes place in 5-second &quot;pulses&quot; and characters may only move short distances while actively engaged in a meleè.

Each character has a strike chance % based on (mostly) their manual dexterity and the base chance of the weapon used to attack. Additional factors, such as running into an attack or achieving surprise—as in an ambush—modify this base chance. The defender&#x27;s defensive % is subtracted from this number, and percentile dice rolled to see if a hit is achieved. When a hit is delivered, the attacker rolls a d10, adds the weapon&#x27;s attack bonus, and subtracts the target&#x27;s armor rating. In some cases, such as a target with plate armor, few weapons can do much damage directly. Only certain special hits can damage the target severely. But with time, even the most heavily armored Knight can usually be worn-down.

Unlike other systems, which use &quot;hit points&quot; to tally damage, &quot;DQ&quot; has a two-tiered system of fatigue and endurance. Normally a weapon does fatigue damage only, but an especially lucky hit may immediately cause &quot;endurance&quot; damage or even a &quot;grievous injury&quot;, which allows the attacker to roll again on a table of nasty hits to the eyes, guts, etc. Once a character has lost all of his fatigue, he begins taking endurance damage instead. This is bad, since endurance damage requires magical intervention or extended bed rest to be recovered. Fatigue can be recovered by simply relaxing and getting a hot meal and a good night&#x27;s sleep. Endurance damage may also increase susceptibility to infection, at the discretion of the referee.

Another &quot;DQ&quot; feature is a three-tiered combat range system: Ranged, Melee, and Close Combat. Ranged Combat typically involves bows, slings, and thrown knives, while Melee is swords, spears, maces and most other weapons. Close Combat in &quot;DQ&quot; is wrestling on the ground with knives, fists, rocks, etc. &quot;DQ&quot; allows a party of adventurers to be surrounded and ultimately overwhelmed by large numbers of peasants, who rather than attacking singly and being cut to ribbons, will instead seek to surround and leap into Close Combat to subdue and pin down Player Characters. Some weapons, such as daggers, can be used at all ranges, but most cannot and are useless when the character is being shot with bows or engaged in Close Combat.

DragonQuest combat falls midway in complexity between &quot;D&amp;D&quot; and systems such as &quot;Runequest&quot; or &quot;HârnMaster&quot;. It can take several hours to resolve battles. Tactics, choice of weapon, and use of spells are keys to victory. A feature of &quot;DQ&quot; is that novice characters and mighty adventurers have nearly the same ability to absorb damage—i.e. they can both be killed fairly easily (unlike &quot;D&amp;D&quot; in which high-level characters can take remarkable amounts of damage without dying, but similar to &quot;Runequest&quot; where character hit points are mostly static). This requires parties to have a balance of fighting and magic skills, since a party cannot be centered on a single nigh-invulnerable figure (a &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot; type).

=== Experience ===

An experience points system is utilized that enables characters to increase their skill levels in spells and vocations, making their characters more formidable. Experience is used to &#x27;purchase&#x27; new and improved abilities, rather than conferring a blanket increase in character skills as in &quot;D&amp;D&quot;.

As characters grow in skills and proficiency, the cost to raise to higher skill levels increases greatly, but the amount of base experience points awarded at the successful completion of an adventure increases as well. In addition, the Dungeon Master may award characters bonus experience points for valiant, clever or outstanding performance during gameplay.

== Publication history ==
Through the 1970s, SPI was a board wargame publisher. With the sudden popularity of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; in the mid-1970s, SPI decided to enter the role-playing game market with a product called &quot;Dragonslayer&quot;, but changed the title to avoid a conflict with Walt Disney Pictures&#x27; 1981 movie of the same name. (In 1981, SPI did publish a product called &quot;Dragonslayer&quot;, a board game that was a licensed tie-in with the movie.)

&quot;DragonQuest&quot; the role-playing game, published in 1980, was a boxed set of three softcover books designed by Eric Goldberg, David James Ritchie and Edward J. Woods, with interior artwork by John Garcia, and cover art by Jim Sherman.

In 1982, SPI published a second edition of &quot;DragonQuest&quot; in which the three books were consolidated into one book, which was published in conjunction with Bantam Books, shortly before SPI was unexpectedly taken over by TSR.

In 1988, TSR published an &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; adventure, &quot;The Shattered Statue&quot; that also included a method for converting the adventure to &quot;DragonQuest&quot;″s 2nd edition rules.

The following year, TSR published a 3rd edition of &quot;DragonQuest&quot; that revamped the magic system, with game design by Gerard Christopher King, interior artwork by Timothy Truman and cover art by Joe Chiodo.

In 1986, Japanese companies Chunsoft and Enix had released an unrelated videogame in Japan called &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;. When the videogame was released in North America in 1989, Chunsoft changed the name to &quot;Dragon Warrior&quot; to avoid trademark issues. The trademark would later expire in the early 2000s and Square Enix would register the trademark for use in the U.S.A.

Ownership of the rights to the &quot;DragonQuest&quot; role-playing game passed to Wizards of the Coast in 1997 following their takeover of TSR.

==Reception==
In the September 1980 edition of &quot;The Space Gamer&quot; (Issue No. 31), Forrest Johnson liked the system despite some flaws. &quot;Despite its faults, it still presents a pleasing contrast to the sloppiness of [&quot;The Fantasy Trip&quot;], the illogic of [&quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;], the incoherence of [&quot;Chivalry &amp; Sorcery&quot;]. It borrows good ideas liberally from the older systems, and offers noteworthy innovations of its own... At [the price], &quot;DragonQuest&quot; is a terrific buy.&quot;

In the November 1980 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue 43), Douglas Bachmann had issues with lack of balance in the skills system, but found the character generation system &quot;a delight&quot;. Bachmann also liked the combat system. He concluded, &quot;[&quot;DragonQuest&quot;] does have some problems, but I have found it to be an exciting game which has succeeded in setting limits and structuring activity while also encouraging creativity.&quot;

Michael A. Stackpole was more critical in his review for &quot;Different Worlds&quot; magazine, writing &quot;&quot;DQ&quot; functions as a FRP game the same way a sledge hammer functions as a mousetrap. Both get the job done, but the effort involved in getting it to work is not worth the end result.&quot;

In Issue 31 of &quot;Phoenix&quot;, Terry Devereux called the combat system and character generation slightly better than the systems used in &quot;D&amp;D&quot;/&quot;AD&amp;D&quot;.

In the Summer 1984 issue of the French games magazine &quot;Casus Belli&quot;, Jean-Pierre Demange reviewed the TSR edition, and admired the many improvements that had been made to the original SPI product, commenting that it &quot;aimed to correct the undeniable defects of the first edition, in order to arrive at a game whose flexibility of use should be the asset without degrading the realism dear to many.&quot; Demange found the character generation system very customizable, and the combat system a &quot;rich experience from the multitude of possible actions.&quot; Demange concluded with a strong recommendation, saying, &quot;&quot;DQ&quot; has many qualities and the flexibility of its rules framework allows everyone to correct the flaws and shortcomings inherent in all human creation.&quot; 

In his 1990 book &quot;The Complete Guide to Role-Playing Games&quot;, game critic Rick Swan was impressed by the production values of the SPI edition game, but pointed out that &quot;closer inspection revealed a lot of annoying rules [including] a tediously complicated combat system ... a dull selection of monsters ... and some just plain silly rules (if a male player wants to use a female character, he has to roll the dice for permission.)&quot; Swan thought that the TSR edition addressed the game&#x27;s deficiencies, making it &quot;a polished and sophisticated fantasy RPG with one of gaming&#x27;s best-ever magic systems.&quot; Swan concluded by giving the game a rating of 3 out of 4, saying, &quot;The game ... desperately needs a more colorful setting. But for now, the future looks bright for &quot;DragonQuest.&quot;&quot; 

In 1996, Heidi Kaye did a retrospective review of &quot;DragonQuest&quot; for &quot;Arcane&quot; magazine, stating that &quot;DragonQuest&quot; system remains eminently playable.

In a retrospective review of &quot;DragonQuest&quot; in &quot;Black Gate&quot;, Ty Johnston said &quot;&quot;DQ&quot; isn&#x27;t for everyone. Patience is the key, and I realize that&#x27;s easier said than done in today&#x27;s busy world. Still, if you&#x27;re looking for an old-school RPG that has deadly combat and is less limiting than player class systems, &quot;DragonQuest&quot; might be for you.&quot;

==Awards==
At the 1981 Origins Awards. &quot;DragonQuest&quot; won the H.G. Wells Award for &quot;Best Roleplaying Rules of 1980&quot;.

<text>Helgö is an island in Ekerö Municipality in Stockholm County, Sweden. Helgö is an island situated in the lake Mälaren. The island&#x27;s greatest width is about , it is about long and covers .

==Excavations at Helgö==

The island is perhaps best known for a major archaeological area. The old trading town on Helgö began to emerge around the year 200 AD, 500 years before Birka at Björkö. The first archaeological dig in 1954 uncovered the remains of the early settlement, including a workshop area which attracted international interest. The most notable finds included a small Buddha statuette from North India and a christening scoop from Egypt, both dating from the 6th century. The Indian Buddha statuette, the Irish crozier and the Egyptian Coptic scoop which were found on Helgö, are presently on display in the Swedish History Museum in Stockholm.

==Kaggeholm Castle ==

The site where Kaggeholm Castle (&quot;Kaggeholms slott&quot;) is located was first mentioned in a land title document in 1287. During the 1500s the farm was owned by members of the families Grip and Bååt.

In 1647, Count Lars Kagg (1595–1661) acquired an estate which he named Kaggeholm. Kagg was a political ally of King Gustavus Adolphus, a member of the Privy Council of Sweden and Field Marshal during the Thirty Years&#x27; War.

The château-style manor house was built in 1725 after drawings and designs by Baroque architect Nicodemus Tessin the Younger (1654–1728).

Since 1939 it had been owned by the Swedish Pentecostal movement and is used as a training center by nearby Kaggeholm College (&quot;Kaggeholms folkhögskola&quot;).

Today Kaggeholm is operated as a conference center managed by the Swedish property development company Sisyfosgruppen Holding.

==Royal Swedish Academy volumes==
The findings from the excavations at Helgö have been reported in a series of volumes published by the Royal Swedish Academy of Letters, History and Antiquities, beginning with Volume 1 covering the period 1954–1956. Volume 18, the final volume in the series, was published in 2011.

<doc id="154427" wikidata="Q7994446" url="?curid=154427" title="White Aryan Resistance (Sweden)">
<text>White Aryan Resistance (, VAM) was a militant neo-Nazi network active in Sweden between 1991 and 1993.

==Overview==
The name of the group was derived from the US white supremacist organisation White Aryan Resistance (WAR). According to Stieg Larsson, a researcher of white supremacist organizations, the group was rather styled on the then already defunct US white supremacist group The Order, led by Robert Jay Mathews. VAM was founded by Klas Lund, other leading members were Torulf Magnusson and Peter Melander, editor of the group&#x27;s magazine &quot;Storm&quot;. The organisation&#x27;s symbol was the &quot;Wolfsangel&quot; with a sword in the center. VAM has been implicated in many serious crimes in Sweden. According to a report prepared and jointly published in November 1999 by Sweden&#x27;s four largest daily newspapers, &quot;Aftonbladet&quot;, &quot;Expressen&quot;, &quot;Dagens Nyheter&quot; and &quot;Svenska Dagbladet&quot;, many former members of the organisation are members of present-day neo-Nazi organisations.

After VAM and a prison sentence, Klas Lund founded the self-declared Swedish Resistance Movement in 1997, which later became the Nordic Resistance Movement. Another VAM offshoot was the now-defunct National Socialist Front which was formed in 1994.

<doc id="154428" wikidata="Q822755" url="?curid=154428" title="Heuvelland">
<text>Heuvelland () is a municipality located in the Belgian province of West Flanders. The municipality comprises the villages of Dranouter, Kemmel, De Klijte, Loker, Nieuwkerke, Westouter, Wijtschate and Wulvergem. Heuvelland is a thinly populated rural municipality, located between the small urban centres of Ypres and Poperinge and the metropolitan area of Kortrijk-Lille along the E17. On 1 January 2006 Heuvelland had a total population of 8,217. The total area is 94.24 km2 which gives a population density of 87 inhabitants per km2. The name &quot;heuvelland&quot; is Dutch meaning &quot;hill country&quot;, as the municipality is characterized by the different hills on its territory.

==Geography==
===Landscape===
The municipality is located in an area known as the West-Flemish Hills. The highest hill in Heuvelland is the Kemmelberg (154 m); followed by the Vidaigneberg (136 m), the Rodeberg (129 m), the Scherpenberg (125 m) and a lower hill in Wijtschate (82 m). On the border with France is the Zwarteberg.

===Municipality parts ===
The municipality Heuvelland consists of eight small rural villages. The &quot;deelgemeentes&quot; of Dranouter, Kemmel, Loker, Nieuwkerke, Westouter, Wijtschate and Wulvergem were independent municipalities before the merger in 1977. De Klijte wasn&#x27;t independent, but was a part of Reningelst (then independent, now part of Poperinge).

Kemmel, Wijtschate, Nieuwkerke and Westouter are the largest centres, with more than 1000 inhabitants each. The town hall and municipal administration are located in Kemmel, as are the police office and post office. The rest home, municipal sports hall and main library are located in Wijtschate. The municipal container park is found in Nieuwkerke. The four other villages are smaller and accommodate less facilities.

Besides the village centres, a number of smaller residential areas are scattered on the territory. On top of the crest of the Rodeberg and Zwarteberg small residential development, mixed with small shops, tourist businesses and restaurants are found. The city centre of Mesen also expands a little on the territory of Wijtschate in Heuvelland.

==History==
===World War I===
The area experienced many major battles during World War I, as part of the Ypres Salient area. The front-line ran through the area of Wytschaete, which was captured and held several times by both sides during the course of the war. Spanbroekmolen was an important German stronghold, and on 30 April and 17 June 1916, the area was the site of two German gas attacks on British troops at Wulverghem. The Kemmelberg was important during the Battle of the Lys, and German units maintained a trench system (&quot;Bayernwald&quot;) within view of Ypres at Croonaert Wood. Nowadays, the &quot;Bayernwald&quot; trenches can be visited as an open-air museum. There are a number of war cemeteries in the municipality, including Godezonne Farm, RE Farm, Spanbroekmolen, Suffolk, Klein Vierstraat and Kemmel Number 1 French Cemetery.

<doc id="154432" wikidata="Q499588" url="?curid=154432" title="Poperinge">
<text>Poperinge (; , ; ) is a city and municipality located in the Belgian province of West Flanders, Flemish Region, and has a history going back to medieval times. The municipality comprises the town of Poperinge proper and surrounding villages. The area is famous for its hops and lace.

==The town==
Poperinge is situated about 13 km (8 miles) to the west of Ypres (Ieper). The region is famous for growing hops and furnishes 80% of Belgian production. The town is home to the national hop museum and is called &quot;hops city&quot;, &quot;hoppe stad&quot; in Dutch, a play on &quot;hoofd stad&quot;, the word for capital. A triennial hop festival and parade is held in the month of September. The local brew is known as Hommel (which means hops in the West Flanders dialect).

The carillon in the tower of the town&#x27;s oldest church, Sint-Bertinuskerk, was noted as one of the most beautiful in Flanders in medieval times. It was destroyed during wartime in 1677 and restored in 1781.

==Administration==
In addition to the town centre of Poperinge, the municipality also comprises the submunicipalities (so-called &quot;deelgemeenten&quot;) of Krombeke, Proven, Reningelst, Roesbrugge-Haringe and Watou. The hamlets of Abele and Sint-Jan-Ter-Biezen are also located within the municipality, but they do not have the status of &quot;deelgemeente&quot;, since they were not independent municipalities before the mergers of municipalities which took place in Belgium in the 1970s.

Roesbrugge-Haringe actually comprises two separate villages, Roesbrugge and Haringe. The hamlet of Abele is located on the border with France and partially lies on French territory.

The municipality borders many rural villages, and because of the long border is also close to many French municipalities.

==History==
Archaeological finds in the area date local habitation back to the Neolithic period. Under the Romans a link was made to it from the road between Cassel and Aardenburg. In the time of the Franks it appeared under the name &quot;Pupurningahem&quot; and was made subject to the ecclesiastical benefice of Saint Omer in the mid-7th century. The Count of Flanders, Dietrich of Alsace, granted the town a charter in 1147 at the request of the abbot. From this time it began to thrive as a cloth-making centre and, in order to accommodate the growing population, the churches of Saint John and of Our Lady were added in 1290 to the already existing Sint-Bertinuskerk.

In 1322 Louis de Nevers forbade cloth-making outside Ypres, which led the citizenry to join a revolt against him the following year. Nor did they ever submit to this restraint on their prosperity and were forever finding new ways to evade the restriction. Their resistance during this period gained them the nickname of &quot;keikoppen&quot; (cobble-heads), a term first recorded in 1341, when the Ypres militia took revenge on the town.

During the disturbances associated with the Hundred Years War, Poperinge suffered from the shifting allegiances of the Counts of Flanders and their commercial consequences. When they supported the French, the wool trade with England was interrupted. In the course of the consequent revolt, the town was sacked and burned by French troops in 1382. Then in 1436 it suffered the same fate from an English army. In 1513, at a time of declining prosperity, much of the town was again destroyed by fire, and then in 1563 the same happened again. During this period Poperinge was stirred up to support the Protestant cause and took part in the iconoclastic fury of 1566. It was in the consequent fighting and persecution that the town and its trade were finally ruined.
Matters were made worse by the wars between the French and the Dutch for control of the region. By the treaty of Nijmegen in 1678 the town passed into French hands and then returned to the Spaniards by the treaty of Ryswick in 1697, before being ceded to the Austrians in 1713 by the treaty of Utrecht. In 1794 it was absorbed by revolutionary France into the département of Lys. Following the defeat of Napoleon it was included in the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, from which Belgium revolted in 1830. Since then Poperinge has repaired its fortunes by concentrating on hop production, the growing of which was first introduced in the 15th century.

During World War I, the town was one of only two in Belgium not under German occupation. It was used to billet British troops and also provided a safe area for field hospitals. Known familiarly as &quot;Pop&quot;, it was just behind the front line and formed an important link for the soldiers and their families, especially through the rest house known as Talbot House (or &quot;Toc H&quot;). A grim reminder of that time remains within the town hall, where two death cells are preserved, and outside in the courtyard, where there is a public execution post used by firing squads. Another reminder is the location of a number of military cemeteries on the outskirts of the town with the graves of Canadian, British, Australian, French, German, US servicemen and men of the Chinese Labour Corps. One of these is Lijssenthoek Military Cemetery for soldiers who had been wounded near Ypres and later died in the large Allied casualty clearing stations located in the area.

==Transportation==
Poperinge railway station is the terminus of Belgian railway line 69, which used to continue to Hazebrouck in France until the 1950s. It has an hourly service, IC-04, to Kortrijk and Antwerpen.

==Literary associations==
Poperinge is mentioned by two major English poets. Geoffrey Chaucer makes it the birthplace of his Flemish knight in &quot;The Tale of Sir Thopas&quot; from the &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot;. Some 150 years later John Skelton follows a line in Flemish with the mention that &#x27;In Popering grew pears when parrot was an egg&#x27; in his enigmatic poem &quot;Speak Parrot&quot;. The poem is an attack on Cardinal Wolsey and the line is taken to refer to his ambition to become Pope.

The town has also been associated with several Neo-Latin poets. Jacques May (Jacobus Majus) was born in Poperinge and left a Latin verse epistle in sapphics dated 1563. Later in the century Maximiliaan de Vriendt, who was born elsewhere, wrote a poem that praised the town and its churches:
:::&quot;Non formosa pales, non hospitae in urbe napeae,&quot;
:::&quot;Non agiles radii, Palidiique coli&quot;
:::&quot;Non celebres baiae (quae dos tua propria) tantis&quot;
:::&quot;Nominibus celebrem te, Poperinga vehunt:&quot;
:::&quot;Quantum larga manus, pietasque insigne avorum,&quot;
:::&quot;In superos templis testificata sacris.&quot;
:::&quot;Omnia de nobis praedantur fata: Tonanti&quot;
:::&quot;Quas damus, has solas semper habemus opes.&quot;

The Flemish poet Gislain de Coninck, who was born in the town, translated the Latin poems of Charles Wynkius in &quot;Himni, Quorum Usus Est In Ecclesiastico Dei Cultu&quot;, and the two were published together in 1573. Then in the following century there were two more Latin poets from the town, Joannes Bartholomaeus Roens and Petrus Wenis (1648-1726). Wenis published &quot;Gheestelycken nachtegael&quot; (The Spiritual Nightingale, 1698) on the miracle that restored a still-born child to life in 1479, an event associated with the statue of Our Lady in Sint-Janskerk that is still celebrated.

In modern times, the town was referred to in one of the epigrams in Charles Baudelaire&#x27;s &quot;Amœnitates Belgicæ&quot;. In “Une Béotie belge” the sophisticated French-speakers of Brussels look down on the rustic Poperinghe of their Flemish compatriots. In the following century, the town is the subject of the imagist night piece &quot;Poperinghe 1917&quot; by the Canadian poet W. W. E. Ross.

Wervik was probably a settlement of the Menapians led by the chief Virovos, at a small height along the banks of the Lys (current Island Balokken). This is still unproven. At the time of the conquest of Gaul by Caesar, a Roman stopping place was built next to the Celtic village. The Roman settlement was registered on Roman road maps from the 3rd to 4th century under the name &quot;Viroviacum&quot; (Itinerarium Antonini) or &quot;Virovino&quot; (map of Peutinger). Viroviacum was located on the Roman road between Cassel and Bavay. Remains from that period are still being found regularly in Wervik. Excavations at Saint Martin&#x27;s Square in the centre exposed the foundations of the old Saint Martin&#x27;s church, which was partly built with Roman waste materials. According to some historians this was formerly a temple dedicated to Mars or Priapus. This is still unproven.

===Middle Ages===

In the 13th century the population of Belgium rose sharply, thanks to the great heyday of the textile trade which penetrated international markets up to the Far East. In 1327 the city was taken by Philip of Valois and partially destroyed.

During the Ghent uprising of 1382, Wervik was an outpost of the army of Philip van Artevelde during the Battle of Westrozebeke. The rebellion failed, and the city was plundered by the Bretons and reduced to ashes. The Saint Medardus church had to be rebuilt completely. Wervik had not yet fully recovered when a major fire in 1400 destroyed the whole town again. Of the 820 dwellings there only 20 remained. Jan Zonder Vrees gave Wervik a market hall in 1401, as an incentive for recovery and revival. In 1436 part of the garrison of Calais invaded Wervik and again burnt the town to ashes, in 1440 the town was burnt again. The many successive fires were mainly because most houses were built of wood and straw, and that the town had no protection against attacks as it was never walled. After the succession of fires the town was attacked by the plague. In the years 1436 and 1468 the population was decimated by the epidemic.

===Habsburg Netherlands===

In the middle of the 16th century finally a quieter period began for Wervik. Prosperity had vanished and the population had dropped to about 3000 inhabitants. During the religious quarrels, the Saint Medardus church was badly damaged and today still bears the traces of the iconoclastic. The Geuzen burnt the church in 1579.

In the 17th century the entire region was affected by the ongoing annexation attempts of the French king Louis XIV. Wervik was taken by the French in 1668 and was later annexed to the Spanish crown in 1678. After the Peace of Nijmegen treaty in that year, Wervik became French territory again. The continuous impoverishment of the town left it with only 3172 inhabitants.

In 1713 the town was divided in half by the Treaty of Utrecht. The river Lys was the state border and separated the town into French Wervicq-Sud and Austrian Wervik. But for the population the town remained whole, and the Saint Medardus church remained the parish church for both town parts.

===First French Republic===

After the French Revolution and the French invasion of 1794, the Saint Medardus church was again turned into ashes. During the War of the First Coalition the battle of Wervik and Menin partly took place here between the Dutch and French revolutionary armies, during which the young Prince Frederick of Orange-Nassau was wounded. Wervik became part of the French département of Lys, and entered a period of terror, coercion and persecution.

===Kingdom of Belgium===

After the Congress of Vienna in 1815, the town became part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands until the Belgian Revolution in 1830. After the Belgian Revolution locals of the towns Wervicq-Sud, Bousbecque, Comines and Warneton protested and demanded a reunification with their Belgian counterparts on the other side of the Lys. This small uprising was put down after a few days by French Gendarmes.
During World War I German troops entered the town on October 5, 1914. A customs officer had noticed German Uhlans in Zuid-Wervik on October 4, and turned the swing bridge between Wervik and Zuid-Wervik open so that no one could cross it, throwing the key in the Lys. The next day more Germans had arrived and fished out the key. After a short fight with the Gendarmerie (both French and Belgian), the town was conquered by the Germans. Because Wervik was the first major town under German control just outside the Western Front, it got a military government and German soldiers were billeted there, and wounded soldiers cared for (including at one time the young Adolf Hitler). Wervik&#x27;s population was forced to work in German operated factories serving the trench warfare. In 1917 the population had to evacuate the town because British guns were aimed at Wervik and ruined the town.

Wervik was largely rebuilt after the war. The Bruges architect Huib Hoste carried out several projects, including several rows of houses, commercial buildings and the town sewers.

During the Second World War Wervik was again occupied by German troops, until the inhabitants were freed in 1944 by Canadian soldiers.

<text>Ypres ( ; ; ; ; ) is a Belgian city and municipality in the province of West Flanders. Though 
the Dutch name is the official one, the city&#x27;s French name is most commonly used in English. The municipality comprises the city of Ypres/Ieper and the villages of Boezinge, Brielen, Dikkebus, Elverdinge, Hollebeke, Sint-Jan, Vlamertinge, Voormezele, Zillebeke, and Zuidschote. Together, they are home to about 34,900 inhabitants.

During the First World War, Ypres (or &quot;Wipers&quot; as it was commonly known by the British troops) was the centre of the Battles of Ypres between German and Allied forces.

==History==
===Origins===
Ypres is an ancient town, known to have been raided by the Romans in the first century BC. It is first mentioned by name in 1066 and is probably named after the river Ieperlee on the banks of which it was founded.

During the Middle Ages, Ypres was a prosperous Flemish city with a population of 40,000 in 1200 AD, renowned for its linen trade with England, which was mentioned in the &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot;.

As the third largest city in the County of Flanders (after Ghent and Bruges), Ypres played an important role in the history of the textile industry. Textiles from Ypres could be found in the markets of Novgorod in Kievan Rus&#x27; in the early 12th century. In 1241, a major fire ruined much of the old city. The powerful city was involved in important treaties and battles, including the Battle of the Golden Spurs, the Battle at Mons-en-Pévèle, the Peace of Melun, and the Battle of Cassel.

The famous Cloth Hall was built in the 13th century. Also during this time cats, then the symbol of the devil and witchcraft, were thrown off Cloth Hall, possibly because of the belief that this would get rid of evil demons. Today, this act is commemorated with a triennial Cat Parade through town.

During the Norwich Crusade, led by the English bishop Henry le Despenser, Ypres was besieged from May to August 1383, until French relief forces arrived. After the destruction of Thérouanne, Ypres became the seat of the new Diocese of Ypres in 1561, and Saint Martin&#x27;s Church was elevated to cathedral. On 25 March 1678, Ypres was conquered by the forces of Louis XIV of France. It remained French under the Treaty of Nijmegen, and Vauban constructed his typical fortifications that can still be seen today.

During the War of the Spanish Succession, the Duke of Marlborough in 1709 intended to capture Ypres, at the time a major French fortress, but changed his mind owing to the long time and effort it had taken him to capture Tournai and apprehension of disease spreading in his army in the poorly drained land around Ypres (see Battle of Malplaquet). In 1713 it was handed over to the Habsburgs, and became part of the Austrian Netherlands.

In 1782 the Habsburg Emperor Joseph II ordered parts of the walls torn down. This destruction, which was only partly repaired, made it easier for the French to capture the city in the 1794 Siege of Ypres during the War of the First Coalition.

In 1850, the Ypresian Age of the Eocene Epoch was named on the basis of geology in the region by Belgian geologist André Hubert Dumont.

Ypres had long been fortified to keep out invaders. Parts of the early ramparts, dating from 1385, still survive near the Rijselpoort (Lille Gate). Over time, the earthworks were replaced by sturdier masonry and earth structures and a partial moat. Ypres was further fortified in the 17th and 18th centuries while under the occupation of the Habsburgs and the French. Major works were completed at the end of the 17th century by the French military engineer Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban.

===First World War===

Ypres occupied a strategic position during the First World War because it stood in the path of Germany&#x27;s planned sweep across the rest of Belgium and into France from the north (the Schlieffen Plan). The neutrality of Belgium, established by the First Treaty of London, was guaranteed by Britain; Germany&#x27;s invasion of Belgium brought the British Empire into the war. The German army surrounded the city on three sides, bombarding it throughout much of the war. To counterattack, British, French, and allied forces made costly advances from the Ypres Salient into the German lines on the surrounding hills.

In the First Battle of Ypres (19 October to 22 November 1914), the Allies captured the town from the Germans. The Germans had used tear gas at the Battle of Bolimov on 3 January 1915. Their use of poison gas for the first time on 22 April 1915 marked the beginning of the Second Battle of Ypres, which continued until 25 May 1915. They captured high ground east of the town. The first gas attack occurred against Canadian, British, and French soldiers, including both metropolitan French soldiers as well as Senegalese and Algerian tirailleurs (light infantry) from French Africa. The gas used was chlorine. Mustard gas, also called Yperite from the name of this town, was also used for the first time near Ypres, in the autumn of 1917.
Of the battles, the largest, best-known, and most costly in human suffering was the Third Battle of Ypres (31 July to 10 November 1917, also known as the Battle of Passchendaele), in which the British, Canadian, ANZAC, and French forces recaptured the Passchendaele Ridge east of the city at a terrible cost of lives. After months of fighting, this battle resulted in nearly half a million casualties to all sides, and only a few miles of ground won by Allied forces. During the course of the war the town was all but obliterated by the artillery fire.

English-speaking soldiers often referred to Ieper/Ypres by the deliberate mispronunciation &quot;Wipers&quot;. British soldiers even published a wartime newspaper called &quot;The Wipers Times&quot;. The same style of deliberate mispronunciation was applied to other Flemish place names in the Ypres area for the benefit of British troops, such as Wytschaete becoming &quot;White Sheet&quot; and Ploegsteert becoming &quot;Plug Street&quot;.

Ypres was one of the sites that hosted an unofficial Christmas Truce in 1914 between German and British soldiers.

During World War Two, the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) would fight the Germans in a delaying action at the Ypres-Comines Canal, one of the actions that allowed the Allied retreat to Dunkirk. Adolf Hitler (later Chancellor of Germany) fought at Ypres in the First World War and later visited the town during the Battle of France.

===War memory and memorial===
On 12 February 1920, King George V awarded the Military Cross to the City of Ypres, one of only two awards of this decoration to a municipality during World War I, the other being to Verdun. In May 1920 Field Marshal French presented the Cross in a special ceremony in the city, and in 1925 it was added to the city&#x27;s coat of arms, along with the French .

Historian Mark Connelly states that in the 1920s, British veterans set up the Ypres League and made the city the symbol of all that they believed Britain was fighting for and gave it a holy aura in their minds. The Ypres League sought to transform the horrors of trench warfare into a spiritual quest in which British and imperial troops were purified by their sacrifice. In 1920, Lieutenant-Colonel Beckles Willson&#x27;s guide book, &quot;The Holy Ground of British Arms&quot; captured the mood of the Ypres League:
There is not a single half-acre in Ypres that is not sacred. There is not a single stone which has not sheltered scores of loyal young hearts, whose one impulse and desire was to fight and, if need be, to die for England. Their blood has drenched its cloisters and its cellars, but if never a drop had been spilt, if never a life had been lost in defence of Ypres still would Ypres have been hallowed, if only for the hopes and the courage it has inspired and the scenes of valour and sacrifice it has witnessed.

Ypres became a pilgrimage destination for Britons to imagine and share the sufferings of their men and gain a spiritual benefit.

After the war, Winston Churchill proposed to leave Ypres as a mausoleum, with the rightful owners to be deprived from regaining their land. By early March 1919, the Belgian scheme was to leave the Cathedral and Cloth Hall and the buildings around them in ruins. By November 1919, the Belgian government was seriously considering two schemes, both of which would have kept the Cloth Hall and the Cathedral in ruins, but one scheme would allow rebuilding houses around the Grand Place, whereas the other would have created a belt of trees surrounding the Hall and Cathedral. By early September 1920, the decision had been made by the British Government that the Menin Gate and its immediate surroundings would be used as a memorial, by which time, the Belgians had already begun to rebuild the area.

In the 100th anniversary period more attempts were being made to preserve the First World War heritage in and around Ypres.

=== Second World War ===
On September 6, 1944, the 1st Polish Armoured Division liberated the town of Ypres after four years of occupation, and the nightly &#x27;Last Post&#x27; ceremony was resumed at the Menin Gate; the Germans had forbidden the ceremony when they occupied Ypres in 1940; from January 1941 until the liberation, the daily commemoration took place in Brookwood Military Cemetery.

===Ypres today===
After the war the town was extensively rebuilt using money paid by Germany in reparations, with the main square, including the Cloth Hall and town hall, being rebuilt as close to the original designs as possible (the rest of the rebuilt town is more modern in appearance). The Cloth Hall today is home to In Flanders Fields Museum, dedicated to Ypres&#x27;s role in the First World War and named for the poem by John McCrae.

Ypres is a small city in the very western part of Belgium, the so-called &quot;Westhoek&quot;. Ypres these days has the title of &quot;city of peace&quot; and maintains a close friendship with another town on which war had a profound impact: Hiroshima. Both towns witnessed warfare at its worst: Ypres was one of the first places where chemical warfare was employed, while Hiroshima suffered the debut of nuclear warfare. The city governments of Ypres and Hiroshima advocate that cities should never be targets again and campaign for the abolition of nuclear weapons. Ypres hosts the international campaign secretariat of Mayors for Peace, an international Mayoral organization mobilizing cities and citizens worldwide to abolish and eliminate nuclear weapons by 2020.

==Sights==
===Town centre===

The imposing Cloth Hall was built in the 13th century and was one of the largest commercial buildings of the Middle Ages. The structure which stands today is the exact copy of the original medieval building, rebuilt after the war. The belfry that surmounts the hall houses a 49-bell carillon. The whole complex was designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1999.

The Gothic-style Saint Martin&#x27;s Cathedral, built in 1221, was also completely reconstructed after the war, but now with a higher spire. It houses the tombs of Jansenius, bishop of Ypres and father of the religious movement known as Jansenism, and of Robert of Bethune, nicknamed &quot;The Lion of Flanders&quot;, who was Count of Nevers (1273–1322) and Count of Flanders (1305–1322).

===Menin Gate===
The Menin Gate Memorial to the Missing commemorates those soldiers of the British Commonwealth – with the exception of Newfoundland and New Zealand – who fell in the Ypres Salient during the First World War before 16 August 1917 and who have no known grave. United Kingdom and New Zealand servicemen who died after that date are named on the memorial at Tyne Cot, a site which marks the farthest point reached by Commonwealth forces in Belgium until nearly the end of the war. Other New Zealand casualties are commemorated on memorials at Buttes New British Cemetery and Messines Ridge British Cemetery. The Menin Gate records only soldiers for whom there is no known grave. As graves are identified, the names of those buried in them are removed from the Gate.

The memorial, designed by Sir Reginald Blomfield with sculpture by Sir William Reid Dick, was unveiled by Lord Plumer on 24 July 1927. It was built and is maintained by The Commonwealth War Graves Commission.

The memorial&#x27;s location is especially poignant, as it lies on the eastward route from the town, which Entente soldiers would have taken heading towards the fighting – many never to return. Every evening since 1929, at precisely eight o&#x27;clock, traffic around the imposing arches of the Menin Gate Memorial has been stopped while the &quot;Last Post&quot; is sounded beneath the gate by the buglers of the Last Post Association in honour of the memory of British Empire soldiers who fought and died there. During the Second World War the ceremony was prohibited by the occupying German forces, but was resumed on the very evening of liberation – 6 September 1944 – notwithstanding the heavy fighting still underway in other parts of the town. The Last Post ceremony was, instead, hosted daily at Brookwood Military Cemetery in England for the duration of that period.

The stone lions bearing the Ypres coat-of-arms, which once flanked the , were presented to Australia in 1936 by the people of Belgium, as acknowledgement of Australia&#x27;s sacrifice during the war. They now reside in the Australian War Memorial in Canberra. In 2017, for the 100th anniversary memorial services of the Third Battle of Ypres, or Passchendaele, in a joint effort by the Belgian, Flemish and Australian governments, the lions were temporarily returned to the Menin Gate. Exact replicas are now installed, in their original position, guarding the approach to Menin Gate on its eastern side.

===War graves===
War graves, both of the Allied side and the Central Powers, cover the landscape around Ypres. The largest number of dead are at Langemark German war cemetery and Tyne Cot Commonwealth war cemetery. The countryside around Ypres is featured in the famous poem by John McCrae, &quot;In Flanders Fields&quot;.
Saint George&#x27;s Memorial Church commemorates the British and Commonwealth soldiers who died in the five battles fought for Ypres during First World War.

==Events==
*The Cat Parade (&quot;Kattenstoet&quot;) takes place every three years on the second Sunday of May. It involves the throwing of stuffed toy cats from the belfry and a colourful parade of cats and witches. The latest Cat Parade took place on 13 May 2018.
*Ypres is also the home of the Belgium Ypres Westhoek Rally since its creation in 1965. It is organized by the Auto Club Targa Florio. Some of the drivers to have taken part are among the best-known names in rallying, such as Juha Kankkunen, Bruno Thiry, Henri Toivonen, Colin McRae, Jimmy McRae, Marc Duez, François Duval, Craig Breen and Freddy Loix among others.
*Ypres holds an annual canoe polo tournament in which teams come from all over Europe to play.
*On 9 July 2014, the 101st Tour de France started stage 5 in Ypres.
*During the last weekend of August each year, Ypres hosts the &quot;Ieperfest&quot;, one of the biggest European festivals in the hardcore metal subculture.
*From 11 - 13 July 2023, a conference for micronations called MicroCon took place in Ypres with 70 people attending.

==Economy==
Though Ypres is an historic city, and generates significant income from tourism, it also has a number of industrial areas. The biggest one is along the Ieperlee canal, which hosts room for around 120 companies and a wind farm in the north of Ypres.

The office area known as Ieper Business Park is connected to the industrial area. That office area started as the site of speech recognition company Lernout &amp; Hauspie, and was named &quot;Flanders Language Valley&quot; (mimicking Silicon Valley), until the company went bankrupt. Since then, the office area had many difficult years, where a big share of the offices were unused. However, those years are mostly over, and currently, the area offers about 1000 employees a job.

Then there are also various other, smaller industrial areas like the area around Picanol in the south of Ypres.

==Transport==

Ieper railway station run by NMBS has hourly trains to Kortrijk.

It can also be accessed from Brussels, linking to Eurostar, and takes about 75 minutes with two stops.

<text>Zonnebeke (; ) is a municipality located in the Belgian province of West Flanders. The municipality comprises the villages of , , Passendale, Zandvoorde and Zonnebeke proper. On January 1, 2006, Zonnebeke had a total population of 11,758. The total area is 67.57 km2 which gives a population density of 174 inhabitants per km2.

==History==

The villages of Zonnebeke congregated around a large Augustinian abbey and its associated Benedictine convent in Nonnebosschen. Both were destroyed during the iconoclastic outbreak in 1580. Only the abbey was rebuilt, but was looted during the French occupation the abbey was confiscated. Passendale played a role in the Battle of Westrozebeke in 1382.

Situated in the centre of the Ypres Salient, World War I destroyed the whole area. Left abandoned until the early 1920s, people slowly returned and rebuilt the villages. In 1932, the locals opened a cheese making facility, which to this day is the only source of Passendale cheese.

Another battle during World War II during the Allied advance across Europe, where Passendale was used in a defensive operations by the Nazis, did little damage.

Today, Zonnebeke has returned to its long-time balance between agriculture, small business and work in the neighbouring towns. Its major industry is the brickworks in the village of Zonnebeke itself, which extracts the local blue clay.

==Zonnebeke underground==

The village and district of Zonnebeke and its five villages have the largest concentration of underground constructions from World War I, being located at the centre of the Third Battle of Ypres/Battle of Passchendaele. The blue-clay is now being extracted for commercial purposes by the Terca Zonnebeke N.V. brickworks factory, meaning that the structures are now regularly found as the brickworks expands its commercial extraction activities.

About 180 dugout sites have been located in the Ypres Salient and in the 1990s some of them were entered, at least in part.

In 1983, the Australian-built Bremen Redoubt was discovered at the rear of the Zonnebeke brickworks. Opened to the public until 1998, it is believed that its eventual collapse was due to drying support timbers.

During archaeological excavations of the Augustinian abbey, another dugout was discovered under Zonnebeke church. Today the outline of this dugout is marked in an archaeological garden within the church grounds, and a model of the church dugout can be seen at the &quot;Memorial Museum Passchendaele 1917&quot; in Zonnebeke.

On February 21, 1998, a farmer&#x27;s wife disappeared into the ground while washing the windows. Beecham dugout was subsequently discovered less than from Tyne Cot Cemetery.

It was made public in spring 2006 that the brickworks had received a licence for the extension of its blue-clay extraction zone. The Association for Battlefield Archaeology and Conservation, using maps compiled of 350 underground structures under the management of Belgian archaeologist Johan Vandewalle and British TV producer Peter Barton, showed that at least one structure was near to the proposed development zone, believed to be the Vampire dugout, which had been rediscovered in 2007. Following discussion with local preservation, historic, council and state officials, the ABAC was allowed to start a scientific research project. They engaged the Centre for Battlefield Archaeology at Glasgow University to provide archaeological support (in light of the residence of the Highland Light Infantry).

==Towns==
The municipality comprises the villages of Zonnebeke proper, , , Passendale and Zandvoorde. All are &quot;deelgemeentes&quot;, meaning they were independent municipalities before the merger in the 1970s.

<text>Mireille Mathieu (; born July 22, 1946) is a French singer. She has recorded over 1,200 songs in eleven languages, with more than 122 million records sold worldwide.

==Biography and career==

===Early years===
Mireille Mathieu was born on July 22, 1946, in Avignon, France, as the eldest daughter in a family of fourteen children; the youngest brother was born after she moved to Paris. Her father, Roger, and his family were natives of Avignon, while her mother, Marcelle-Sophie (née Poirier), was from Dunkirk. Marcelle arrived in Avignon in 1944 as a refugee from World War II after her grandmother had died and her mother went missing. Roger, along with his father, Arcade, ran the family stonemason shop just outside the main gate of . The Mathieu family has been stonemasons for four generations. Today, the shop is named &quot;Pompes Funèbres Mathieu-Mardoyan,&quot; owned and managed by her sister Réjane&#x27;s family.

The Mathieu family lived in poverty, but their living conditions improved significantly in 1954, when subsidized housing was built in the &quot;Malpeigné&quot; neighborhood near the cemetery. Then, in 1961, they moved to a larger tenement in the neighborhood southeast of the city.

Roger had once dreamed of becoming a singer, but his father, Arcade, disapproved, which inspired him to encourage one of his children to learn to sing with him in church. Mathieu included her father&#x27;s operatic voice on her 1968 Christmas album, where it was mixed into the Minuit Chrétiens song. Mathieu&#x27;s first paid performance before an audience, at age four, was rewarded with a lollipop when she sang during Midnight Mass on Christmas Eve 1950. A defining moment for her was seeing Édith Piaf sing on television.

Mathieu performed poorly in elementary school due to dyslexia, requiring an additional year to graduate. She was born left-handed, and her teachers would strike her hand with a ruler each time she was caught writing with it. She eventually became right-handed, although her left hand remains quite animated when she sings. She has an excellent memory and never uses a prompter on stage. Abandoning higher education at age 14 (1961), after moving to Croix des Oiseaux, she began working in a local factory in Montfavet (a suburb southeast of town), contributing to the family income and paying for her singing lessons. Popular at work, she often sang during lunch or while working. Like her parents, she is short in stature, standing at 1.52 m (5 feet) tall. Her sister Monique (), born on July 8, 1947, began working at the same factory a few months later. Both sisters received bicycles on credit to commute, resulting in long days and difficult memories of riding against the mistral winds. When the factory closed, Mathieu and her two sisters (Monique and Christiane) became youth counselors at a summer camp before her rise to fame. During that summer, she had her fortune told by Tarot cards by an elderly Gypsy woman, who predicted that she would soon mingle with kings and queens.

Mathieu is Roman Catholic, and her adopted patron saint is Saint Rita, the &quot;Saint for the Impossible.&quot; Mathieu&#x27;s paternal grandmother, Germaine née Charreton, assured her that Saint Rita was the one to intercede with God for hopeless cases. Beyond religion, like many artists, she holds superstitions and beliefs about luck. When asked to reveal some of her superstitions, she said, &quot;The most important one is to never mention any of them.&quot; She has stage fright and is often seen making the sign of the cross before stepping on stage.

===Debut (1962–1965)===
Mathieu began her career by participating in an annual singing contest in Avignon called &quot;On Chante dans mon Quartier&quot; (&quot;We Sing in My Neighborhood&quot;). Photos depict the event as rather modest, with a simple curtain and one projector light. The stage was only twenty feet square, and the singer had to share it with a large piano and musicians. A large, boisterous, and mostly young audience was very much in evidence. The judges sat at a table in front of and below the elevated stage. Anyone who signed the contract in the weeks leading up to the show was allowed to perform. Talent scouts made this a worthwhile event for singers from hundreds of miles around.

Mathieu received private singing lessons from Madame Laure Collière, who was also a piano teacher in Avignon. Self-described as very stubborn in her autobiography, she wrote about singing love songs that the audience deemed inappropriate for a young girl. As a result, she lost to Michèle Torr in 1962 when she sang &quot;Les Cloches de Lisbonne&quot; at the first contest, and lost again in 1963 when she sang Édith Piaf&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Hymne à l&#x27;amour.&quot; However, in 1964, she won the event with another Piaf song: &quot;La Vie en rose.&quot;

Her victory earned her a free trip to Paris and a pre-audition for the televised talent show &quot;Jeu de la Chance&quot; (&quot;Game of Luck&quot;), where amateur singers competed for audience and telephone votes. Her participation and train fare were arranged by Raoul Colombe, the deputy mayor of Avignon. Accompanied by a pianist at the studio and dressed in black like Piaf, she sang two Piaf songs for the audition judges but left dispirited: the Parisians at the studio mocked her Provençal accent, and her dyslexia caused her to mix up words. For example, her sister and current manager Monique is called &quot;Matite&quot; because Mathieu could not pronounce &quot;petite&quot; as a child.

During a 1965 summer gala, added to the Enrico Macias concert by Raoul Colombe (her first manager), Mathieu met her future manager, Johnny Stark. Mathieu and her father initially thought Stark was American, based on his name and demeanor, and they nicknamed him &quot;l&#x27;Américain&quot;. Stark had worked with artists such as Yves Montand, and the relationship between him and Mathieu is often likened to that of Colonel Tom Parker and Elvis Presley. Stark is credited with making her a star and the successor to Piaf. By 1968, under his careful management, she had become France&#x27;s most popular singer.

===Breakthrough (1965–1967)===

Mathieu was invited to Paris by impresario Régis Durcourt to sing on the &quot;Song Parade&quot; television program on 19 November 1965. Johnny Stark had promised to write to her, but after months of waiting, she gave up on him and accepted Durcourt&#x27;s offer. The exact circumstances remain unknown, but Mathieu was suddenly moved up to compete live on the Sunday, 21 November 1965 episode of &quot;Jeu de la Chance&quot;, a talent segment of the popular French program &quot;Télé-Dimanche&quot;. Stark&#x27;s ex-wife, Nanou Taddéi, who worked at Studio 102, likely recognized Mathieu, as she had participated in her earlier pre-audition. Mathieu explained that &quot;Song Parade&quot; offered only one opportunity to sing, while &quot;Jeu de la Chance&quot; offered multiple chances, but only if she won, and she intended to win.

Both the studio audience and telephone voters gave her a slight lead over five-time winner , so the producers called it a tie. Stark officially became her manager that night, and with the help of his longtime assistant Nadine Joubert, prepared Mathieu to win the contest the following week and defeat Lemaire. Stark and Lemaire had a mutual dislike. 

In a short film called &quot;La guerre des Piaf&quot; (War of the Sparrows), Mathieu and Lemaire were interviewed separately, both being of the same diminutive height. Mathieu was surrounded by her sisters Monique and Christiane, with Stark hovering in the background as she faced her first on-camera interview. She appeared uncomfortable, staring at the floor during many of the questions and even looking dumbfounded at one point, until Stark finally came to her rescue. In a later interview, she emphasized the significance of the event, stating, &quot;For me, Paris was the end of the world. I had never taken a train or seen a camera before. I did not know what the outcome of the adventure would be.&quot;

In the middle of her seven consecutive performances on &quot;Télé-Dimanche&quot;, she performed a concert at the Paris Olympia, which propelled her to stardom. She signed with Bruno Coquatrix, the owner of the Olympia, on 20 December, and performed the only three Piaf songs she had memorized two days later. She was hailed in the press, in France and abroad, as the &quot;Piaf d&#x27;Avignon&quot; (Sparrow of Avignon), in reference to Piaf&#x27;s nickname &quot;Sparrow of the Streets.&quot;

All was not going well at this point. Mathieu said, &quot;I was managed to such mimicry of my idol that I thought I was not able to do anything else. It was instantly one of the biggest disappointments of my life.&quot; Stark then abandoned the Piaf direction he was taking her in. The Olympia performance convinced a skeptical Paul Mauriat to work with Mireille, and songwriter André Pascal joined forces to develop her into a successful act. Together they wrote new modern material for her: &quot;Mon crédo&quot;, &quot;Viens dans ma rue&quot;, &quot;La première étoile,&quot; and many other hit songs. Her first album, &quot;En Direct de L&#x27;Olympia&quot;, on the Barclay label, was released in 1966. Highly acclaimed, along with the singles and EPs from it, the album made her a star outside France.

A regular early contributor of material was Francis Lai, who wrote two songs, &quot;C&#x27;est ton nom&quot; and &quot;Un homme et une femme&quot; for her first album, and who often accompanied her with his accordion on television. Her first record was recorded in the EMI studios, with Paul Mauriat&#x27;s band. Mathieu&#x27;s success led her record company, Barclay, to claim that they controlled 40% of the French pop record market. 

Mathieu spent all of 1966 and 1967 touring. It was then, during a car journey to another concert, that Stark advised Mathieu that she was finally debt-free and worth more than a million francs (US$200,000 in 1967). She had always prayed that she could get her family out of poverty, but the touring and singing were much more important at the time. In her autobiography, she stated her first major purchases were a vehicle for her father&#x27;s business and a large home for her parents and siblings. Most importantly, she had a telephone installed for the family, so her parents no longer had to go to the pharmacy to talk to her while she was in Paris. Her one regret was that she was unable to see her grandmother Germaine in the hospital before she died because of all the tour contracts.

Mathieu arrived in Paris with two dresses and a change of underwear, and Stark set her up in style, sent for Mathieu&#x27;s two eldest sisters, and let them go shopping for a week. He then rented her a home and a maid in the smart district of Neuilly after she had won, and made sure she only had her singing to worry about. Stark recorded all the expenses, though, and he was fully compensated before a franc was ever put in Mathieu&#x27;s account.

Mathieu sang at the London Palladium during royal performances (before the Queen and her family), first in 1967, with further performances in 1969 and 1981. Following her second performance, her French cover of Engelbert Humperdinck&#x27;s &quot;The Last Waltz&quot; (La dernière valse) generated much publicity in Great Britain and became a hit record, even though the original had been number one only a few months earlier. She also toured Canada and the United States, where she appeared on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; and the &quot;Danny Kaye Show&quot;. While visiting Hollywood, she met Elvis Presley, and in Las Vegas, Nevada, she sang with Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra.

===Career in the 20th century (1967–2000)===

Although the popularity of Mathieu&#x27;s genre has declined, given the domination of rock and roll and the global lack of interest in non-English popular music during her most profitable years, she has remained a popular artist in France and Europe. Many thousands of fans have met her before and after performances for autographs and to wish her well over the years, and the common refrain is how well she treats her fans. She easily interacts with the public. While the Mathieu sisters are quite wealthy, they have also made their songwriters extremely wealthy. Most of the record profits go to the authors, whereas Mathieu had to tour and perform concerts live and on television.

While on tour in February 1968, Mathieu was involved in a car accident in which she fractured one of her vertebrae; the injury incapacitated her for three months. She writes in her book that they received a note which said, &quot;we will get you next time&quot;, but it was not proven to be anything other than an accident.

In 1971, Barclay was unable to meet the demand for records. Stark then made a contract with Philips Records to issue all the singles and EPs, resulting in a million-dollar lawsuit from Barclay for breach of contract. Barclay&#x27;s contract was scheduled to run until 1972.

In 1972, Mathieu toured Canada and produced a live album. Stark had his first heart attack while making arrangements for this concert.

In 1974, Mathieu formed her own publishing company, Abilene Music. Today, this company is involved in the publishing and printing of music material.

In 1983, Mathieu established another publishing company, Abilene Disc. This company is used to publish her recordings and is managed by her sisters Monique and Christiane.

In 1985, Mathieu joined Plácido Domingo in performing a children&#x27;s show called &quot;The Tales of Cri-Cri.&quot; This television special featured puppets along with fifty years of traditional Mexican songs, producing popular versions in Spanish, French, and English. Mathieu&#x27;s father, Roger, died this same year.

In 1986, Mathieu returned to Paris with tremendous concerts at the Palais des Congrès (more than 100,000 spectators in one month, sold-out concerts). She then performed in China, with a French television crew from TF1 filming &quot;Mireille Mathieu in China&quot;. In her autobiography, she states that she was the first Western performer to give a concert in the city, but this was in error, as at least two other Western performances preceded hers.

In 1988, W. Kordes&#x27; Söhne, a German rose-breeding company, introduced the Mireille Mathieu Rose to match her favorite lipstick color. Mathieu also published her autobiography with co-author . The title is &quot;Oui je crois&quot;, meaning &quot;Yes, I Believe&quot;, which is taken from the lyrics of &quot;Mon crédo,&quot; her first recording. The book was viewed as a final chapter in her career, and Stark was also exhausted and overweight by this time. Pierre Delanoë wrote a passionate song about Joan of Arc titled &quot;La Demoiselle d&#x27;Orléans&quot; for Mathieu. The final lyric reads: &quot;When I think of all I have given France... and she has forgotten me.&quot; She used her fists to punch the air while singing the song. 

In response to accusations of being docile, Mathieu writes in her autobiography that she and Stark understood each other. She wanted to be a singer, and he was tired of people who merely sought fame. They were both hard workers, and he kept her schedule filled with lucrative contracts. She also notes that she was forbidden to read the press; however, having peeked at some of it, she was content to follow that rule. Stark, of course, had a heavy hand in manipulating the press. Mathieu recounts that her mother was often surprised to read on the front page that she was engaged to someone famous or was going to star in a movie directed by a well-known director. Her guiding principle was simply to sing and ensure that her family never returned to the tenements of &quot;Croix des Oiseaux&quot;.

Many photographs and films from the early years depict life around Stark&#x27;s villa in Roquefort-la-Bédoule (south of France). The villa, also named &quot;La Bédoule&quot;, provided an escape from Paris for everyone to relax. The home supported Stark&#x27;s telephone addiction, boasting 28 telephones, with each car also equipped with a phone. Mathieu lived here with her aunt Irène, and her siblings would often visit. The pool was designed to be shallow all around and deep in the center, as Mathieu had a fear of drowning and never learned to swim. The property was sold following Stark&#x27;s divorce.

In 1989, President François Mitterrand invited Mathieu to sing a tribute to General Charles de Gaulle. Stark died that same year after suffering his second heart attack. Divorced and estranged from his family, Stark was entombed in the mausoleum of Mathieu in Avignon. Upon Stark&#x27;s death, many remarked that no one could replace him, a sentiment that proved true; however, by that time, the entertainment press had also matured.

Stark left behind a legal &quot;bloody mess.&quot; It took Mathieu and her lawyers years to settle and process his estate. &quot;I was severely depressed, but I got out without needing analysis.&quot; The most controversial event of Mathieu&#x27;s career, according to the media at the time, occurred when she took over Stark&#x27;s office and ended her business relationship with Nadine Joubert. In an interview for &quot;Paris Match&quot; in 2002, Mathieu stated, &quot;I realized that people I trusted stole my money, so I fired everyone!&quot;

Mathieu&#x27;s sister Monique stepped in to become her business manager. Stark wanted Pascal Auriat to succeed him, but Auriat died three months before Stark. Mathieu performed again at the Palais des Congrès in November and December 1990 with a special two-hour concert without intermission, featuring a new haircut reminiscent of Louise Brooks and a very simple black dress created by French couturier Pierre Cardin. Unfortunately, this was during the First Gulf War, resulting in fewer spectators than in 1986, and some performances had to be canceled due to insufficient ticket sales.

In 1993, she attempted a comeback with two albums devoted to her idol, Édith Piaf: &quot;Mireille Mathieu chante Piaf&quot; in French and &quot;Unter dem Himmel von Paris&quot; in German. She sold 100,000 copies of the French album, which was also available in the United States.

In November 1995, she recorded the new album &quot;Vous lui direz...&quot;, produced by Michel Jourdan for East West. The album featured new songs from a variety of authors, including Maxime Leforestier, who wrote &quot;À la moitié de la distance&quot; for Mathieu. She adapted this album into the German version &quot;In meinem Traum,&quot; which included two mini-CDs.

In 1998, she performed at the Olympia in Paris and released a compilation titled &quot;Son grand numéro&quot; with the new record label EMI. This compilation included a cover of Toni Braxton&#x27;s hit &quot;Unbreak My Heart&quot;, translated into French as &quot;Reste avec moi&quot;.

In 1999, Mathieu released another German album, &quot;Alles nur ein Spiel,&quot; featuring several modern songs with a techno sound, including &quot;C&#x27;est ça l&#x27;amour&quot; and &quot;Wenn die Sehnsucht erwacht.&quot;

===Career in the 21st century (2001–present)===

In 2002, Mathieu released her thirty-seventh French album, &quot;De tes mains&quot; (EMI), followed by a series of concerts at the Paris Olympia in November and a tour in France, Belgium, and Switzerland. Reviews in the French press were quite positive, and the public gave Mathieu standing ovations every evening.

Mathieu celebrated the fortieth anniversary of her career at the Paris Olympia on 24 November 2005, releasing her thirty-eighth French album, &quot;Mireille Mathieu,&quot; produced by Patrick Hampartzoumian, who wrote the main title, &quot;Une place dans mon cœur.&quot; The performance, along with an interview, was recorded and released in wide-screen DVD format in 2006; however, the DVD was available only in European video format.

On 1 November 2008, she was a guest of Prime Minister Vladimir Putin in Moscow and performed a concert in his honor. The two visited the tent of visiting Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi.

In November 2010, she was awarded the Russian Medal of Friendship by President Dmitry Medvedev at a state dinner. She was in Russia and the Baltic States throughout November, returning to Paris after a concert in Warsaw, Poland, on 28 November. In January 2011, Mireille was promoted from Chevalier (9 December 1999) to Officier of the Légion d&#x27;honneur.

In November 2011, Mathieu canceled her concert in Israel for the second time that year due to the promoter&#x27;s failure to meet the required ticket sales.

In March 2012, Mathieu, along with Jean Claudric and his orchestra, visited three cities in Siberia, Russia: Perm (21 March), Tyumen (24 March), and Yekaterinburg (26 March).

During an interview in Moscow, Mathieu remarked that the group Pussy Riot had committed a sacrilege in the church by staging a political demonstration against President Putin. The French television program &quot;On n&#x27;est pas couché&quot; edited out the second half of her statement and labeled her a tool of President Putin. Her lawyer, André Schmidt, sued the station for defamation, but the suit was dismissed at trial in July 2014. The part that was edited out was, &quot;As a woman artist and a Christian, I beg the indulgence of these three girls.&quot; The three women were ultimately convicted and sentenced to two years in prison for hooliganism and inciting religious hatred.

In October 2012, Mathieu announced on her webpage that she would be re-releasing her album &quot;Chante Piaf,&quot; with two new recordings added in celebration of her 50th year as a singer and the 50th anniversary of Piaf&#x27;s death. Also that month, she had to cancel several shows in Russia, including performances in Rostov, Volgograd, Samara, and Ufa. She had contracted these shows through a Yekaterinburg company called Mix Art, via her Malta agent, Foresa Investment Ltd. She stated that Mix Art &quot;acted in a highly unprofessional and even fraudulent way.&quot; However, she was able to salvage the tours with performances in Moscow on 3 November 2012, Saint Petersburg on 5 November 2012, and Krasnodar on 7 November 2012. She also performed the rescheduled concert in Ufa on 7 March 2013.

In December 2013, her lawyers won a lawsuit against MGM Home Entertainment for failing to compensate her production company, Abilene Disc, for the 1967 song &quot;Les Yeux de l&#x27;amour&quot; (The Eyes of Love), which was used in the German version of the movie &quot;Casino Royale.&quot; Since 2009, she has been the main guest star of the Spasskaya Tower Military Music Festival and Tattoo, held on Moscow&#x27;s Red Square. On 5 September 2013, during her concert at the festival, she performed in a light dress under icy rain and gusty winds, refusing an offer for a coat as she deemed it disrespectful to the freezing audience in the stands. Russian TV&#x27;s &quot;Culture&quot; channel praised her performance that day as a remarkable feat.

Mathieu had an active tour schedule for 2014, celebrating her 50th year in show business (she dates her career from the year she won her first singing contest in Avignon). Her first concert was scheduled to be in Kyiv, and she held out hope it would proceed, but ultimately canceled it seven days prior &quot;due to the instability.&quot; Her France 50th Anniversary tour ran from October to November 2014.

Mathieu performed her 50th Anniversary tour in Germany and Austria from 1 to 16 March 2015, singing at sold-out venues in twelve different cities. She credits her sister and manager, Monique, for keeping the general audience ticket prices reasonable.

In March 2015, she announced on her webpage that all concerts in Russia were canceled &quot;due to the economic situation.&quot; The concert website stated that the Russian currency had collapsed, making it no longer possible to finance the concert and travel arrangements.

On 26 May 2015, Mathieu performed at the &quot;Culture Without Borders&quot; (&quot;Culture sans frontière&quot;) project at the UNESCO headquarters in Paris. She participated in a concert titled &quot;The Allies of the Great Victory: A Musical Story,&quot; featuring the Jazz Band of Igor Butman (Russia-US). Other soloists included Allan Harris (US), Sanya Kroitor (Israel), Yakov Yavno (US), Igor Butman, Mikhail Gluz (Russia), Polina Zizak (Russia), and various other celebrities.

On 30 July 2015, she returned to Byblos, Lebanon, after 41 years for the Byblos International Festival. Her sisters Monique—who is also her manager—and Marie France accompanied her mother on the trip, who then made a brief appearance with her on stage, escorted by the family servant, Hervé-Marc.

On 20 March 2016, Mathieu&#x27;s mother died at the age of 94 from a pulmonary embolism. She was entombed in the mausoleum Mathieu at the Saint-Véran cemetery in Avignon.

==Personal life==
Mathieu does not have a publicist and does not feel the need to expound on her private life. She is a devout Catholic and attends Catholic Mass with her family.

<text>Björn Nils Olof Skifs (; born 20 April 1947) is a Swedish singer, songwriter, actor, and screenwriter. Skifs has represented Sweden twice in the Eurovision Song Contest, in the 1978 contest and in the 1981 contest. 

==Career==
Björn Skifs formed his first musical group, Slam Creepers, in 1962. Slam Creepers split in 1969 and Skifs went on to form a new band, Blåblus (a farmer&#x27;s or workman&#x27;s shirt (blus, blouse) made from blue (blå, blue) fabric - a pun (blues)) in 1972. As the lead singer of Blue Swede (another pun - blue + suede), the band had a No. 1 hit on &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1974 with a cover of Mark James&#x27;s &quot;Hooked on a Feeling&quot;. 

Skifs embarked on a solo career after Slam Creepers broke up in 1969 and previously he had recorded the duet &quot;Med varann&quot; with Anni-Frid Lyngstad for his 1975 album &quot;Schiffz!&quot;. Skifs appeared as The Arbiter on the original studio album for &quot;Chess&quot;, released in 1984. A single and video, &quot;The Arbiter (I Know the Score)&quot;, was released in 1985. Skifs also recorded several demos for the album, including &quot;One Night in Bangkok&quot;, later performed by Murray Head. Skifs did not perform the role on stage (in the original London production the character was played by Tom Jobe).

Povel Ramel gave Skifs the Karamelodiktstipendiet award in 1984. 

Skifs has represented Sweden twice in the Eurovision Song Contest, in the 1978 contest and in the 1981 contest. In 2000, he hosted Melodifestivalen, the Swedish heat of the Eurovision Song Contest, along with nine other presenters.

In 2002, he had a major hit with the song &quot;Håll mitt hjärta&quot; (Hold My Heart), which is a Swedish version of Peter Hallström″s song &quot;Same Ol&#x27; Story&quot;. It stayed on Svensktoppen from 27 April 2003 until 8 January 2006, for a total of 142 weeks. In April 2020, Skifs performed at the Swedish live-show &quot;En kväll tillsammans&quot;, broadcast on SVT, which aimed to bring in money to the Swedish COVID-19 risk groups. Skifs performed the song &quot;Håll Mitt Hjärta&quot; at the end of the show.

Skifs was the opening act of the final of the Eurovision Song Contest 2024 on 11 May, performing &quot;Hooked on a Feeling&quot;.

<text>A parka, like the related anorak, is a type of coat with a hood, often lined with fur or fake fur. Parkas and anoraks are staples of Inuit clothing, traditionally made from caribou or seal skin, for hunting and kayaking in the frigid Arctic. Some Inuit anoraks require regular coating with fish oil to retain their water resistance. Parkas are typically longer, often extending to the thighs or knees. Anoraks are usually shorter than parkas, often hip-length, and are traditionally a pull-over jacket.

The words &quot;anorak&quot; and &quot;parka&quot; have been used interchangeably, but they are somewhat different garments. Strictly speaking, an anorak is a waterproof, hooded, pull-over jacket without a front opening, and sometimes drawstrings at the waist and cuffs, and a parka is a hip-length cold-weather coat, typically stuffed with down or very warm synthetic fiber, and with a fur-lined hood.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;anorak&quot; comes from the Greenlandic (&quot;Kalaallisut&quot;) word &quot;annoraaq&quot;. It did not appear in English until 1924; an early definition is &quot;a beaded item worn by Greenland women or brides in the 1930s&quot;. In the early 1950s it was made from nylon, but changed to poplin by 1959, when it was featured in &quot;Vogue&quot; magazine as a fashion item. In 1984, &quot;The Observer&quot; used the term to refer to the type of people who wore it and subsequently, in the United Kingdom, it is sometimes used as a mildly derogatory term.

The word &quot;parka&quot; is derived from the Nenets language. In the Aleutian Islands the word simply means &quot;animal skin&quot;. It first entered the English written record in a 1625 work by Samuel Purchas.

The Inuit who speak Inuktitut use parkas and have various terms related to them as follows:

==Amauti==


== N-3B (&quot;scrub snorkel&quot; or &quot;snorkel&quot;) parka==
The original snorkel parka (USAF N-3B parka, which is 3/4 length and has a full, attached hood; the similar N-2B parka is waist-length and has an attached split hood) was developed in the United States during the early 1950s for military use, mainly for flight crews stationed in extremely cold areas. It was designed for use in areas with temperatures as low as . Originally made with a sage green DuPont flight silk nylon outer and lining it was padded with a wool blanket type material until the mid-1970s when the padding was changed to polyester wadding making the jacket both lighter and warmer. The outer shell material also was changed to a sage green cotton-nylon blend, with respective percentages 80–20, 65–35, and 50–50 being used at various times.

It gained the common name of &quot;snorkel parka&quot; because the hood can be zipped right up leaving only a small tunnel (or snorkel) for the wearer to look out of. This is particularly effective in very cold, windy weather although it has the added liabilities of seriously limiting the field of vision and hearing. Earlier Vietnam-era hoods had genuine fur ruffs; later versions used synthetic furs. Original manufacturers of this parka for the government included Skyline, Southern Athletic, Lancer, Greenbrier, Workroom For Designers, Alpha, and Avirex.

The basic N-3B parka design was copied and sold to the civilian market by many manufacturers with varying degrees of quality and fidelity to the original government specifications. Surplus military parkas are often available for relatively low prices online and in surplus stores; they compare quite favorably with civilian extreme-cold parkas of all types due to their robust construction, designed for combat conditions, and warmth.

The 1970s–1980s civilian version of the parka was made in many colors – navy blue, green, brown, black, maroon, grey, royal blue, sky blue and bright orange. Most had an orange diamond quilted nylon lining, although a very small number did have alternative colored linings such as yellow, pale blue, and green. While still manufacturing parkas to the military standard, Alpha Industries have more recently adopted the orange lining and a slimmer fit when producing their VF59 model parka which is now more popular than the military version.

In Europe the snorkel parka started to regain popularity in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

==Fishtail parka==
The fishtail parka was first used by the United States Army in 1950 during the Korean War. Following the end of the Second World War the US army recognized the need for a new cold weather combat system, resulting in four main styles of fishtail parka: the EX-48, M-48, M-51 and the M-65. The M stands for model, and the number is the year it was standardized. The EX-48 model was the first prototype or &quot;experimental&quot; precursor to all of them. 
The M-48 then being the first actual production model fishtail parka after the pattern being standardized on December 24, 1948.
The name &quot;fishtail&quot; comes from the fish tail extension at the back that could be folded up between the legs, much like a Knochensack, and fixed using snap connectors to add wind-proofing. The fishtail was fixed at the front for warmth or folded away at the back to improve freedom of movement when needed. 
The EX-48 parka is distinctive as it has a left sleeve pocket and is made of thin poplin, only the later production M-48 parkas are made of the heavier sateen canvas type cotton. 
The EX-48 also has a thin fibre glass based liner that is very light and warm, the M-48 has a thicker wool pile liner with an integral hood liner made of wool. Both are distinguishable from any other type of parka by having the sleeve pocket. This was dropped for the M-51 onward. 
The fur ruff on the hood is also fixed to the shell of an EX-48/M-48 and is of wolf, coyote or often wolverine. The M-48 parka was costly to produce and therefore only in production for around one year. The pockets were wool lined both inside and out. The cuffs had two buttons for securing tightly around a wearer&#x27;s wrist. The later more mass-produced M-51 parka had just the one cuff button. The liner had a built in chest pocket which again was unique to the M-48 parka.

The next revision was the M-51, made because the M48 was too expensive to mass-produce.

The outer hood of the M-51 Fishtail Parka is integral to the parka shell, an added hood liner as well as a button in main liner make the M-51 a versatile 3 piece parka.
The idea behind this 3 part system was to enable a more customisable parka that allowed for easier cleaning of the shell as the hood fur was on the detachable hood liner, not fixed to the shell as in the M-48. It also allowed for both liners to be buttoned in or our depending on the temperature and hence warmth required. It was also cheaper than the M-48 to mass-produce
The early M-51 was made of heavy sateen cotton, the same material as the M-48. Later revisions of the M-51 were poplin based. The later liners were also revised from the &quot;heavy when wet&quot; wool pile to a lighter woolen loop or frieze wool design that dried easier and were far lighter. The frieze liners were constructed of mohair and were designed using a double loop system.

The M-65 fishtail parka has a detachable hood and was the last revision. It features a removable quilted liner made of light nylon / polyester batting which are modern synthetic materials. The M-65 fishtail parka first came into production in 1968.
These parkas featured synthetic fur on the hoods after an outcry from the fur lobby. As a result, only hoods for these parkas made in 1972 and for one year later have real fur.

Designed primarily for combat arms forces such as infantry, they are to be worn over other layers of clothing; alone, the fishtail parka is insufficient to protect against &quot;dry cold&quot; conditions (i.e. below about -10 °C). As such all fishtail parkas are big as they were designed to be worn over battle dress and other layers.

In the 1960s UK, the fishtail parka became a symbol of the mod subculture. Because of their practicality, cheapness and availability from military surplus shops, the parka was seen as the ideal garment for fending off the elements and protecting smarter clothes underneath from grease and dirt when on the mod&#x27;s vehicle of choice, the scooter. Its place in popular culture was assured by newspaper pictures of parka-clad mods during the Bank Holiday riots of the 1960s.

==Cagoule==

A cagoule is the British English term for a lightweight, weatherproof anorak or parka, usually unlined and sometimes knee-length. A cagoule could be rolled up into a very compact package and carried in a bag or pocket. It was invented by Noel Bibby of Peter Storm Ltd. in the early 1960s. It may have a full-zippered front opening, or pull over the head like an original anorak and close with snaps or a short zipper, has an integral hood, and elasticated or drawstring cuffs. In some versions, when rolled up, the hood doubles as a bag into which the rest of the coat is pushed. It became very popular in the United Kingdom during the 1970s.

<text>Wythenshawe Hall is a 16th-century timber-framed historic house and former manor house in Wythenshawe, Manchester, England, south of Manchester city centre in Wythenshawe Park. Built for Robert Tatton, it was home to the Tatton family for almost 400 years. Its basic plan is a central hall with two projecting wings.

In the winter of 1643–44, the house was besieged by Parliamentarian forces during the English Civil War. Despite the stout defence put up by Robert Tatton and his fellow Royalists, the defenders were overwhelmed by the Roundheads&#x27; superior weaponry.

Rebuilding work was carried out at the end of the 18th century, and various additions made in the 19th century, including a walled garden, an ice house, glass houses and a tenant&#x27;s hall. Wythenshawe Hall and its surrounding parkland were donated to Manchester Corporation in 1926, and in 1930 it was opened to the public as a museum.

The building was badly damaged in an arson attack in March 2016; the hall finally reopened to visitors in September 2022 after extensive repairs.

==History==
A pre-1300 charter mentions an enclosed deer park in Wythenshawe where the Tatton family owned land in 1297. Around 1540, Robert Tatton of Chester built Wythenshawe Hall as the Tatton family residence. The timber-framed Tudor house was the home of the family for almost 400 years. and may originally have had a moat.

The hall was besieged during the English Civil War over the winter of 1643–44 by Robert Duckenfield&#x27;s Parliamentarian forces. It was defended by Royalists led by Robert Tatton until the Roundheads brought two cannons to the hall from Manchester, leading to the Royalist surrender on 27 February 1644. The Parliamentarians subsequently confiscated Wythenshawe Hall, but it was returned to the Tatton family on payment of a fine of just over £700. After recovering the estate, the family expanded it to about .
In 1924 Robert Henry Grenville Tatton inherited the Wythenshawe estate. There was interest from Manchester Corporation, who wanted land to build a garden suburb, ostensibly to rehouse tenants from slum clearance. By April 1926 Wythenshawe Hall and of its surrounding estate had been sold to Ernest Simon, 1st Baron Simon of Wythenshawe and Shena Simon, Lady Simon of Wythenshawe, who donated them to Manchester Corporation &quot;to be used solely for the public good&quot;. Later that year, the corporation purchased the rest of the estate, and went on to build one of the largest housing estates in Europe on the land.

Repairs were made to the hall in the 1950s, and it was listed as a Grade II* structure on 25 February 1952. Its former stable block, to the west of the hall, was Grade II listed in 1974.

The roof of the hall and an upper floor were severely damaged by a fire that started at around 3:30 am on 15 March 2016; the clock tower was also damaged. On 23 March, Jeremy Taylor of Wythenshawe was charged with arson in connection with the fire. In July 2017, after changing his plea and admitting guilt, he was sentenced to four and a half years in prison. The hall was added to the Heritage at Risk Register in October 2016. A planning application to restore the building was submitted in November 2016, with the intention of keeping as much of the original material as possible; the repairs were completed at a cost of £6.7 million and the building reopened to the public in September 2022.

==Architecture==

The hall was partially rebuilt between 1795 and 1800 by Lewis Wyatt. It was altered around 1840 possibly by Edward Blore. Additions included a walled garden, an ice house, and glass houses. In the Victorian era the dining room was refurbished and a tenant&#x27;s hall was added.

The timber-framed manor house has a hall with two projecting wings, and a porch and dais bays. The entrance hall (also known as the ante-room) is thought to have previously been a chapel, which was subsequently turned into a billiards room, before becoming an entrance hall in the 1870s.

==Museum==
In 1930, the hall was turned into a museum and art gallery. Most of the hall&#x27;s original furniture was removed by the Tatton family in 1926 when they moved out, and most of the furniture and paintings displayed in the hall during its time as a museum were from the Manchester City Galleries collection.

Until 2007 a re-enactment of the 1643 siege of Wythenshawe Hall by Cromwell&#x27;s troops was staged every July.

By 2004 the hall was only open once a week for four months in the year and in 2010 closed completely as a result of council spending cuts. One proposition was that Manchester City Council could sell the building to the National Trust. In summer 2012 the hall re-opened for 10 days for the Wythenshawe Games. A friends group was established in September 2012 to hold monthly open days and regular events at the hall. Furniture installed by the friends group (including a four-poster bed engraved with the Tatton family crest) was not damaged by the fire.

==Park==
Wythenshawe Park occupies of land surrounding the hall in Northern Moor. The park contains a mix of woodland, bedding, borders, grassland and meadows, sports and games facilities, and Wythenshawe community farm and a horticulture centre North Lodge, the Grade II listed gate lodge on the park&#x27;s northern boundary was built in the Tudor style in the mid to late 19th century. 

Facing the hall stands a -tall bronze statue of Oliver Cromwell on a granite plinth and pedestal, sculpted by Matthew Noble in 1875. Now Grade II listed, it was moved from its original location on Deansgate to the park in 1968.

<text>Wolfenbüttel is a district in southeastern Lower Saxony, Germany. Neighboring districts are (clockwise from the north) the district-free City of Braunschweig, the district of Helmstedt, the district of Harz in Saxony-Anhalt, and the districts of Goslar, Hildesheim and Peine. The district-free city of Salzgitter cuts through the district of Wolfenbüttel in the southwest.

==Geography==
The Oker River enters the district in the south, runs through the city of Wolfenbüttel (the district seat), and exits to the northwest.

==History==
The district was created in 1832 when the Duchy of Brunswick was subdivided into six districts. It remained unchanged until 1941 when the &quot;Salzgitter-Verordnung&quot; (&quot;Salzgitter Ordinance&quot; creating the city of Salzgitter) took effect and removed 20 municipalities from the district; in return, 10 municipalities from the (then) District of Marienburg were turned over to Wolfenbüttel. When the district boundaries changed again in 1974 (as part of administrative reforms), parts of the former District of Brunswick were added to Wolfenbüttel. Additionally, several municipalities—most notably the city Bad Harzburg—were exchanged with the neighboring District of Goslar.

==Partnerships==
The district has partnerships with the French city of Cachan, the County Borough of Rhondda Cynon Taff in Wales, and the District of Września in Poland.

==Coat of arms==
The lion at the top of the coat of arms represents the House of Welf, the ruling house of the Duchy of Brunswick from the 13th century. The ears in the bottom symbolise the district&#x27;s mostly agricultural character.
