<text>In music, the organ is a keyboard instrument of one or more pipe divisions or other means (generally woodwind or electric) for producing tones. The organs have usually two or three, up to five, manuals for playing with the hands and a pedalboard for playing with the feet. With the use of registers, several groups of pipes can be connected to one manual.

The organ has been used in various musical settings, particularly in classical music. Music written specifically for the organ is common from the Renaissance to the present day. Pipe organs, the most traditional type, operate by forcing air through pipes of varying sizes and materials, each producing a different pitch and tone. These instruments are commonly found in churches and concert halls, where they have long been associated with liturgical music and grand ceremonial occasions. 

Mechanical or electronic systems are used by non-pipe organs to emulate the sound of pipe organs.

== Overview ==
* Pipe organs, which use air moving through pipes to produce sounds. The air is supplied by bellows, an electric motor or water. Since the 16th century, pipe organs have used various materials for pipes, which can vary widely in timbre and volume. Increasingly hybrid organs are appearing in which pipes are augmented with electric additions;
* Non-piped organs, which include:
** pump organs, also known as reed organs or harmoniums, which, like the accordion and mouth organs (both Eastern and Western), notably the harmonica, use air to excite free reeds;
** electronic and electromechanical organs (notably the Hammond organ), which generate electrically produced sound through one or more loudspeakers;
* Mechanical organs, which include the barrel organ and Orchestrion. These are controlled by mechanical means such as pinned barrels or book music. Little barrel organs dispense with the hands of an organist and bigger organs are powered in most cases by an organ grinder or today by other means such as an electric motor.

== History ==

=== Predecessors ===
Predecessors to the organ include:
* Panpipes, pan flute, syrinx, and nai, &quot;etc.&quot;, are considered as ancestor of the pipe organ.
* Aulos, an ancient double reed instrument with two pipes, is the origin of the word &quot;Hydr-aulis&quot; (water-aerophone).

=== Origins ===

The organ is a relatively old musical instrument, dating from the time of Ctesibius of Alexandria (285–222 BC), who invented the water organ. It was played throughout the Ancient Greek and Ancient Roman world, particularly during races and games. During the early medieval period it spread from the Byzantine Empire, where it continued to be used in secular (non-religious) and imperial court music, to Western Europe, where it gradually assumed a prominent place in the liturgy of the Catholic Church. Subsequently, it re-emerged as a secular and recital instrument in the Classical music tradition.

=== Early organs ===
Early organs include:
* 3rd century BC: the Hydraulis, ancient Greek water-powered organ played by valves.
* 1st century AD (&quot;at least&quot;): the &quot;Ptera&quot; and the &quot;Pteron&quot;, an ancient Roman organ similar in appearance to the portative organs
* 2nd century: the Magrepha, ancient Hebrew organ of ten pipes played by a keyboard
* 8th century: &quot;Pippin&#x27;s organ of 757&quot; (Carolingian dynasty) was sent as a gift to the West by the Byzantine emperor Constantine V
* 9th century: the automatic flute player (and possibly automatic hydropowered organ), a mechanical organ by the Banū Mūsā brothers 

=== Medieval organs ===
Medieval organs include:
* Portative organ: a small portable medieval instrument
* Positive organ: a somewhat larger though still portable instrument
* Regal: a portable late-medieval instrument with reed pipes and bellows; forerunner of the harmonium and reed organ

== Pipe organs ==

The pipe organ is the largest musical instrument. These instruments vary greatly in size, ranging from a cubic meter to a height reaching five floors, and are built in churches, synagogues, concert halls, and homes. Small organs are called &quot;positive&quot; (easily placed in different locations) or &quot;portative&quot; (small enough to carry while playing).

The pipes are divided into ranks and controlled by the use of hand stops and combination pistons. Although the keyboard is not expressive as on a piano and does not affect dynamics (it is binary; pressing a key only turns the sound on or off), some divisions may be enclosed in a swell box, allowing the dynamics to be controlled by shutters. Some organs are totally enclosed, meaning that all the divisions can be controlled by one set of shutters. Some special registers with free reed pipes are expressive.

It has existed in its current form since the 14th century, though similar designs were common in the Eastern Mediterranean from the early Byzantine period (from the 4th century AD) and precursors, such as the hydraulic organ, have been found dating to the late Hellenistic period (1st century BC). Along with the clock, it was considered one of the most complex human-made mechanical creations before the Industrial Revolution. Pipe organs range in size from a single short keyboard to huge instruments with over 10,000 pipes. A large modern organ typically has three or four keyboards (manuals) with five octaves (61 notes) each, and a two-and-a-half octave (32-note) pedal board.

Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart called the organ the &quot;King of instruments&quot;. Some of the biggest instruments have 64-foot pipes (a foot here means &quot;sonic-foot&quot;, a measure quite close to the English measurement unit) and it sounds to an 8 Hz frequency fundamental tone. Perhaps the most distinctive feature is the ability to range from the slightest sound to the most powerful, plein-jeu impressive sonic discharge, which can be sustained in time indefinitely by the organist. For instance, the Wanamaker organ, located in Philadelphia, US, has sonic resources comparable with three simultaneous symphony orchestras. Another interesting feature lies in its intrinsic &quot;polyphony&quot; approach: each set of pipes can be played simultaneously with others, and the sounds mixed and interspersed in the environment, not in the instrument itself.

=== Church ===
Most organs in Europe, the Americas, and Australasia can be found in Christian churches. The introduction of church organs is traditionally attributed to Pope Vitalian in the 7th century. Due to its simultaneous ability to provide a musical foundation below the vocal register, support in the vocal register, and increased brightness above the vocal register, the organ is ideally suited to accompany human voices, whether a , a choir, or a cantor or soloist.

Most services also include solo organ repertoire for independent performance rather than by way of accompaniment, often as a prelude at the beginning the service and a postlude at the conclusion of the service.
Today this organ may be a pipe organ (see above), a digital or electronic organ that generates the sound with digital signal processing (DSP) chips, or a combination of pipes and electronics. It may be called a church organ or classical organ to differentiate it from the theatre organ, which is a different style of instrument. However, as classical organ repertoire was developed for the pipe organ and in turn influenced its development, the line between a church and a concert organ became harder to draw.

=== Concert hall ===
In the late 19th century and early 20th century, symphonic organs flourished in secular venues in the United States and the United Kingdom, designed to replace symphony orchestras by playing transcriptions of orchestral pieces. Symphonic and orchestral organs largely fell out of favor as the &quot;orgelbewegung&quot; (organ reform movement) took hold in the middle of the 20th century, and organ builders began to look to historical models for inspiration in constructing new instruments. Today, modern builders construct organs in a variety of styles for both secular and sacred applications.

=== Theatre and cinema ===
The theatre organ or cinema organ was designed to accompany silent movies. Like a symphonic organ, it is made to replace an orchestra. However, it includes many more gadgets, such as mechanical percussion accessories and other imitative sounds useful in creating movie sound accompaniments such as auto horns, doorbells, and bird whistles. It typically features the Tibia pipe family as its foundation stops and the regular use of a tremulant possessing a depth greater than that on a classical organ.

Theatre organs tend not to take nearly as much space as standard organs, relying on extension (sometimes called unification) and higher wind pressures to produce a greater variety of tone and larger volume of sound from fewer pipes. Unification gives a smaller instrument the capability of a much larger one, and works well for monophonic styles of playing (chordal, or chords with solo voice). The sound is, however, thicker and more homogeneous than a classically designed organ. In the US the American Theater Organ Society (ATOS) has been instrumental in programs to preserve examples of such instruments.

=== Chamber organ ===

A chamber organ is a small pipe organ, often with only one manual, and sometimes without separate pedal pipes that is placed in a small room, that this diminutive organ can fill with sound. It is often confined to chamber organ repertoire, as often the organs have too few voice capabilities to rival the grand pipe organs in the performance of the classics. The sound and touch are unique to the instrument, sounding nothing like a large organ with few stops drawn out, but rather much more intimate. They are usually tracker instruments, although the modern builders are often building electropneumatic chamber organs.

Keyboard pieces that predate Beethoven may usually be as easily played on a chamber organ as on a piano or harpsichord, and a chamber organ is sometimes preferable to a harpsichord for continuo playing as it is more suitable for producing a sustained tone.

== Non-piped organs ==
=== Reed or pump organ ===


The pump organ, reed organ or harmonium, was the other main type of organ before the development of the electronic organ. It generated its sounds using reeds similar to those of an accordion. Smaller, cheaper and more portable than the corresponding pipe instrument, these were widely used in smaller churches and in private homes, but their volume and tonal range was extremely limited. They were generally limited to one or two manuals; they seldom had a pedalboard.
* Harmonium or parlor organ: a reed instrument, usually with several stops and two foot-operated bellows.
* American reed organ: similar to the Harmonium, but that works on negative pressure, sucking air through the reeds.
* Melodeon: a reed instrument with an air reservoir and a foot-operated bellows. It was popular in the US in the mid-19th century. (This is not to be confused with the diatonic button accordion which is also known as the melodeon.)

The chord organ was invented by Laurens Hammond in 1950. It provided chord buttons for the left hand, similar to an accordion. Other reed organ manufacturers have also produced chord organs, most notably Magnus from 1958 to the late 1970s.

=== Electronic and electromechanical organs ===

Since the 1930s, pipeless electric instruments have been available to produce similar sounds and perform similar roles to pipe organs. Many of these have been bought both by houses of worship and other potential pipe organ customers, and also by many musicians both professional and amateur for whom a pipe organ would not be a possibility. Far smaller and cheaper to buy than a corresponding pipe instrument, and in many cases portable, they have taken organ music into private homes and into dance bands and other new environments, and have almost completely replaced the reed organ.

==== Hammond ====

The Hammond organ was the first successful electric organ, released in the 1930s. It used mechanical, rotating tonewheels to produce the sound waveforms. Its system of drawbars allowed for setting volumes for specific sounds, and it provided vibrato-like effects. The drawbars allow the player to choose volume levels. By emphasizing certain harmonics from the overtone series, desired sounds (such as &#x27;brass&#x27; or &#x27;string&#x27;) can be imitated. Generally, the older Hammond drawbar organs had only preamplifiers and were connected to an external, amplified speaker. The Leslie speaker, which rotates to create a distinctive tremolo, became the most popular.

Though originally produced to replace organs in the church, the Hammond organ, especially the model B-3, became popular in jazz, particularly soul jazz, and in gospel music. Since these were the roots of rock and roll, the Hammond organ became a part of the rock and roll sound. It was widely used in rock and popular music during the 1960s and 1970s by bands like Emerson, Lake and Palmer, Procol Harum, Santana and Deep Purple. Its popularity resurged in pop music around 2000, in part due to the availability of clonewheel organs that were light enough for one person to carry.

==== Allen ====

In contrast to Hammond&#x27;s electro-mechanical design, Allen Organ Company introduced the first totally electronic organ in 1938, based on the stable oscillator designed and patented by the company&#x27;s founder, Jerome Markowitz. Allen continued to advance analog tone generation through the 1960s with additional patents. In 1971, in collaboration with North American Rockwell, Allen introduced the world&#x27;s first commercially available digital musical instrument. The first Allen Digital Organ is now in the Smithsonian Institution.

==== Other analogue electronic ====

Frequency divider organs used oscillators instead of mechanical parts to make sound. These were even cheaper and more portable than the Hammond. They featured an ability to bend pitches.

From the 1940s up until the 1970s, small organs were sold that simplified traditional organ stops. These instruments can be considered the predecessor to modern portable keyboards, as they included one-touch chords, rhythm and accompaniment devices, and other electronically assisted gadgets. Lowrey was the leading manufacturer of this type of organs in the smaller (spinet) instruments.

In the 1960s and 1970s, a type of simple, portable electronic organ called the combo organ was popular, especially with pop, Ska (in the late 1970s and early 1980s) and rock bands, and was a signature sound in the rock music of the period, such as The Doors and Iron Butterfly. The most popular combo organs were manufactured by Farfisa and Vox.

Conn-Selmer and Rodgers, dominant in the market for larger instruments, also made electronic organs that used separate oscillators for each note rather than frequency dividers, giving them a richer sound, closer to a pipe organ, due to the slight imperfections in tuning.

Hybrids, starting in the early 20th century, incorporate a few ranks of pipes to produce some sounds, and use electronic circuits or digital samples for other sounds and to resolve borrowing collisions. Major manufacturers include Allen, Walker, Compton, Wicks, Marshall &amp; Ogletree, Phoenix, Makin Organs, Wyvern Organs and Rodgers.

==== Digital ====

The development of the integrated circuit enabled another revolution in electronic keyboard instruments.
Digital organs sold since the 1970s utilize additive synthesis, then sampling technology (1980s) and physical modelling synthesis (1990s) are also utilized to produce the sound.

Virtual pipe organs use MIDI to access samples of real pipe organs stored on a computer, as opposed to digital organs that use DSP and processor hardware inside a console to produce the sounds or deliver the sound samples. Touch screen monitors allows the user to control the virtual organ console; a traditional console and its physical stop and coupler controls is not required. In such a basic form, a virtual organ can be obtained at a much lower cost than other digital classical organs.

== Mechanical organs ==
Mechanical organs include:
* Barrel organ: made famous by organ grinders in its portable form, the larger form often equipped with keyboards for human performance
* Organette: small, accordion-like instrument manufactured in New York in the late 1800s
* Novelty instruments or various types that operate on the same principles. These pipe organs use a &quot;piano roll&quot; player or other mechanical means instead of a keyboard to play a prepared song:
** Orchestrion
** Fairground organ (or band organ in the USA)
** Dutch street organ
** Dance organ

The wind can also be created by using pressurized steam instead of air. The steam organ, or calliope, was invented in the United States in the 19th century. Calliopes usually have very loud and clean sound. Calliopes are used as outdoors instruments, and many have been built on wheeled platforms.

== Music ==
=== Classical music ===

The organ has had an important place in classical music, particularly since the 16th century. Spain&#x27;s Antonio de Cabezón, the Netherlands&#x27; Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck, and Italy&#x27;s Girolamo Frescobaldi were three of the most important organist-composers before 1650. Influenced in part by Sweelinck and Frescobaldi, the North German school rose from the mid-17th century onwards to great prominence, with leading members of this school having included Buxtehude, Franz Tunder, Georg Böhm, Georg Philipp Telemann, and above all Johann Sebastian Bach, whose contributions to organ music continue to reign supreme.

During this time, the French Classical school also flourished. François Couperin, Nicolas Lebègue, André Raison, and Nicolas de Grigny were French organist-composers of the period. Bach knew Grigny&#x27;s organ output well, and admired it. In England, Handel was famous for his organ-playing no less than for his composing; several of his organ concertos, intended for his own use, are still frequently performed.

After Bach&#x27;s death in 1750, the organ&#x27;s prominence gradually shrank, as the instrument itself increasingly lost ground to the piano. Nevertheless, Felix Mendelssohn, César Franck, and the less famous A.P.F. Boëly (all of whom were themselves expert organists) led, independently of one another, a resurgence of valuable organ writing during the 19th century. This resurgence, much of it informed by Bach&#x27;s example, achieved particularly impressive things in France (even though Franck himself was of Belgian birth). Major names in French Romantic organ composition are Charles-Marie Widor, Louis Vierne, Alexandre Guilmant, Charles Tournemire, and Eugène Gigout. Of these, Vierne and Tournemire were Franck pupils.

In Germany, Max Reger (late 19th century) owes much to the harmonic daring of Liszt (himself an organ composer) and of Wagner. Paul Hindemith produced three organ sonatas and several works combining organ with chamber groups. Sigfrid Karg-Elert specialized in smaller organ pieces, mostly chorale-preludes.

Among French organist-composers, Marcel Dupré, Maurice Duruflé, Olivier Messiaen and Jean Langlais made significant contributions to the 20th-century organ repertoire. Organ was also used a lot for improvisation, with organists such as Charles Tournemire, Marcel Dupré, Pierre Cochereau, Pierre Pincemaille and Thierry Escaich.

Some composers incorporated the instrument in symphonic works for its dramatic effect, notably Mahler, Holst, Elgar, Scriabin, Respighi, and Richard Strauss. Saint-Saëns&#x27;s &quot;Organ Symphony&quot; employs the organ more as an equitable orchestral instrument than for purely dramatic effect. Poulenc wrote the sole organ concerto since Handel&#x27;s to have achieved mainstream popularity.

Because the organ has both manuals and pedals, organ music has come to be notated on three staves. The music played on the manuals is laid out like music for other keyboard instruments on the top two staves, and the music for the pedals is notated on the third stave or sometimes, to save space, added to the bottom of the second stave as was the early practice. To aid the eye in reading three staves at once, the bar lines are broken between the lowest two staves; the brace surrounds only the upper two staves. Because music racks are often built quite low to preserve sightlines over the console, organ music is usually published in oblong or landscape format.

=== Jazz ===
Electronic organs and electromechanical organs such as the Hammond organ have an established role in a number of popular-music genres, such as blues, jazz, gospel, and 1960s and 1970s rock music. Electronic and electromechanical organs were originally designed as lower-cost substitutes for pipe organs. Despite this intended role as a sacred music instrument, electronic and electromechanical organs&#x27; distinctive toneoften modified with electronic effects such as vibrato, rotating Leslie speakers, and overdrivebecame an important part of the sound of popular music.

The electric organ, especially the Hammond B-3, has occupied a significant role in jazz ever since Jimmy Smith made it popular in the 1950s. It can function as a replacement for both piano and bass in the standard jazz combo. The Hammond organ is the centrepiece of the organ trio, a small ensemble which typically includes an organist (playing melodies, chords and basslines), a drummer and a third instrumentalist (either jazz guitar or saxophone). In the 2000s, many performers use electronic or digital organs, called clonewheel organs, as they are much lighter and easier to transport than the heavy, bulky B-3.

=== Popular music ===

Performers of 20th century popular organ music include William Rowland who composed &quot;Piano Rags&quot;; George Wright (1920–1998) and Virgil Fox (1912–1980), who bridged both the classical and religious areas of music.

Church-style pipe organs are sometimes used in rock music. Examples include Tangerine Dream, Rick Wakeman (with Yes and solo), Keith Emerson (with The Nice and Emerson, Lake and Palmer), George Duke (with Frank Zappa), Dennis DeYoung (with Styx), Arcade Fire, Muse, Roger Hodgson (formerly of Supertramp), Natalie Merchant (with 10,000 Maniacs), Billy Preston and Iron Butterfly.

Artists using the Hammond organ include Bob Dylan, Counting Crows, Pink Floyd, Hootie &amp; the Blowfish, Sheryl Crow, Vulfpeck, Sly Stone and Deep Purple.

=== Sport ===

In the United States and Canada, organ music is commonly associated with several sports, most notably baseball, basketball, and ice hockey.

The first baseball team to introduce an organ was the Chicago Cubs, who put an organ in Wrigley Field as an experiment in 1941 for two games. Ebbets Field, home of the Brooklyn Dodgers, hired baseball&#x27;s first full-time organist, Gladys Goodding. Over the years, many ballparks caught on to the trend, and many organists became well-known and associated with their parks or signature tunes.

<doc id="152783" wikidata="Q539791" url="?curid=152783" title="William J. Perry">
<text>William James Perry (born October 11, 1927) is an American mathematician, engineer, businessman, and civil servant who was the United States Secretary of Defense from February 3, 1994, to January 23, 1997, under President Bill Clinton. He also served as Deputy Secretary of Defense (1993–1994) and Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (1977–1981).

Perry is the Michael and Barbara Berberian Professor (emeritus) at Stanford University, with a joint appointment at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies and the School of Engineering. He is also a senior fellow at Stanford University&#x27;s Hoover Institution. He is the co-founder of the Palo Alto Unitarian Church and serves as director of the Preventive Defense Project. He is an expert in U.S. foreign policy, national security and arms control. In 2013 he founded the William J. Perry Project, a non-profit effort to educate the public on the current dangers of nuclear weapons.

Perry also has extensive business experience and serves on the boards of several high-tech companies. He was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering in 1970 for contributions to communications theory, radio propagation theory, and computer technology in the design of advanced systems. He is also a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Among Perry&#x27;s numerous awards are the Presidential Medal of Freedom (1997) and the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun (2002), awarded by Japan.

==Early life==
Born in Vandergrift, Pennsylvania, Perry attended, but did not graduate from Culver Military Academy. He graduated from Butler Senior High School in 1945 and served in the United States Army as an enlisted man from 1946 to 1947, including service in the Occupation of Japan. Perry later received a commission in the United States Army Reserve through ROTC, serving from 1950 to 1955.

Perry received his B.S. (1949) and M.A. (1950) degrees from Stanford University and a Ph.D. in mathematics from Pennsylvania State University in 1957.

==Early career==
From 1954 to 1964 Perry was director of the Electronic Defense Laboratories of Sylvania/GTE in California, and from 1964 to 1977 president of Electromagnetic Systems Laboratory (ESL), Incorporated, an electronics firm that he founded. He was instrumental in demonstrating the technical feasibility of extracting Signals intelligence on the Soviet Union from the overall Rf background with the then proposed Rhyolite/Aquacade surveillance program. In 1967 he was hired as a technical consultant to the Department of Defense.

===Undersecretary of Defense for R&amp;E===
From 1977 to 1981, during the Jimmy Carter administration, Perry served as Undersecretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, where he had responsibility for weapon systems procurement and research and development. Among other achievements, he had an influence on the development of the AirLand Battle doctrine, and was instrumental in the development of stealth aircraft technology, specifically the Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk.

==Mid-career==
On leaving the Pentagon in 1981, Perry became managing director until 1985 of Hambrecht &amp; Quist, a San Francisco investment banking firm &quot;specializing in high-tech and defense companies.&quot;

He was appointed by President Ronald Reagan in 1983 to serve on the President&#x27;s Commission on Strategic Forces. He was also a member of the Packard Commission.

Later in the 1980s he held positions as founder and chairman of Technology Strategies Alliances, professor in the School of Engineering at Stanford University, and served as a co-director of the Preventive Defense Project at the Stanford University Center for International Security and Cooperation.

===Undersecretary of Defense===
Perry returned to the Pentagon as Under Secretary of Defense after being nominated by Bill Clinton on February 3, 1993,

The &quot;frenzy&quot; of defense industry mergers that the US experienced after 1986 was encouraged when in autumn 1993, Perry and his boss Les Aspin invited two dozen industry executives to a dinner &quot;in the secretary&#x27;s dining room next to his office&quot;. The two Secretaries urged their guests to combine into a few, larger companies because Pentagon budget cuts would endanger at least half of the contractors represented there. The event would come to be known as &quot;the last supper&quot;.

==Secretary of Defense==
Perry&#x27;s boss as Undersecretary, Les Aspin, was not a good fit for the job and within a year tendered his resignation. Perry succeeded him after a two-month search. The same day of his confirmation hearing, Perry was confirmed by a unanimous (97-0) vote to become Defense Secretary.

He entered office with broad national security experience, both in industry and government and with an understanding of the challenges that he faced. A hands-on manager, he paid attention both to internal operations in the Pentagon and to international security issues. He worked closely with his deputy secretaries (John M. Deutch, 1994–95, and John P. White, 1995–97), and he met regularly with the service secretaries, keeping them informed and seeking their advice on issues. He described his style as &quot;management by walking around.&quot;

Perry adopted &quot;preventive defense&quot; as his guide to national security policy in the post-Cold War world. During the Cold War the United States had relied on deterrence rather than prevention as the central principle of its security strategy. Perry outlined three basic tenets of a preventive strategy: keep threats from emerging; deter those that actually emerged; and if prevention and deterrence failed, defeat the threat with military force. In practical terms this strategy relied on threat reduction programs (reducing the nuclear complex of the former Soviet Union), counter-proliferation efforts, the NATO Partnership for Peace and expansion of the alliance, and the maintenance of military forces and weapon systems ready to fight if necessary. To carry out this strategy, Perry thought it necessary to maintain a modern, ready military force, capable of fighting two major regional wars at the same time.

===Defense budget===

The formulation of the Defense budget and shepherding it through Congress was one of Perry&#x27;s most important duties. The problem of how to deal with a large projected Defense budget shortfall from 1995 to 2000, an issue that weakened Perry&#x27;s predecessor Les Aspin and contributed to his resignation, persisted when Perry took office. Immediately on presenting his 1995 budget request, which he termed &quot;a post-Cold War budget,&quot; Perry stated that Defense required a few more years of downsizing and that its infrastructure needed streamlining as well. The proposal, he said, maintained a ready-to-fight force, redirected a modernization program (including a strong research and development program), initiated a program to do business differently (acquisition reform), and reinvested defense dollars in the economy.

Perry asked for $252.2 billion for FY 1995, including funds for numerous weapon systems, such as a new aircraft carrier, three Aegis cruisers, and six C-17 cargo aircraft. The budget projected a further cut of 85,500 in active duty military personnel, leaving a force of 1.52 million. Ultimately Congress provided $253.9 billion TOA, about $2 billion more than in FY 1994, but actually a 1.2% cut in inflation-adjusted growth.

In February 1995, Perry asked for $246 billion for the Department of Defense for FY 1996. This proposal became entangled in the controversy during 1995 over the House Republicans&#x27; Contract with America, their efforts to spend more on defense than the administration wanted, and the continuing need for deficit reduction.

Perry cautioned Congress in September of the possibility that President Clinton would veto the FY 1996 Defense budget bill because Congress had added $7 billion in overall spending, mainly for weapon systems that the Defense Department did not want, and because of restrictions on contingency operations Congress had put in the bill. Three months later he recommended that the president veto the bill. When Congress and the administration finally settled on a budget compromise midway through FY 1996, DoD received $254.4 billion TOA, slightly more than in FY 1995, but in terms of real growth a 2% cut.

The question of a national missile defense system figured prominently in the budget struggles Perry experienced. Aspin had declared an end to the Strategic Defense Initiative program, but long-standing supporters both inside and outside of Congress called for its resurrection, especially when the Defense budget came up. Perry rejected calls for revival of SDI, arguing that the money would be better spent on battlefield antimissile defenses and force modernization, that the United States at the moment did not face a real threat, and that if the system were built and deployed it would endanger the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks with the Russians. The secretary was willing to continue funding development work on a national system, so that if a need emerged the United States could build and deploy it in three years. President Clinton signed the FY 1996 Defense bill early in 1996 only after Congress agreed to delete funding for a national missile defense system.

Shortly before he introduced his FY 1997 budget request in March 1996, Perry warned that the United States might have to give up the strategy of preparing for two major regional conflicts if the armed forces suffered further reductions. The Five-Year Modernization Plan Perry introduced in March 1996 reflected his basic assumptions that the Defense budget would not decline in FY 1997 and would grow thereafter; that DoD would realize significant savings from infrastructure cuts, most importantly base closings; and that other savings would come by contracting out many support activities and reforming the defense acquisition system.

For FY 1997 the Clinton administration requested a DoD appropriation of $242.6 billion, about 6% less in inflation-adjusted dollars than the FY 1996 budget. The budget proposal delayed modernization for another year, even though the administration earlier had said it would recommend increased funding for new weapons and equipment for FY 1997. The proposal included advance funding for contingency military operations, which had been financed in previous years through supplemental appropriations. Modest real growth in the Defense budget would not begin until FY 2000 under DoD&#x27;s six-year projections. The procurement budget would increase during the period from $38.9 billion (FY 1997) to $60.1 billion (FY 2001). For FY 1997 Congress eventually provided $244 billion TOA, including funds for some weapon systems not wanted by the Clinton administration.

Although he had not thought so earlier, by the end of his tenure in early 1997 Perry believed it possible to modernize the U.S. armed forces within a balanced federal budget. Perry argued for the current force level of just under 1.5 million as the minimum needed by the United States to maintain its global role. Further reductions in the Defense budget after 1997 would require cuts in the force structure and make it impossible for the United States to remain a global power.

===Streamlining the military infrastructure===
Perry devoted much time to restructuring defense acquisition policy and procedure, pursuing measures on acquisition reform begun when he was deputy secretary. Six days after he became secretary Perry released a document that laid out a variety of proposed acquisition procedure changes, including simplification of purchases under $100,000; maximum reliance on existing commercial products; conforming military contracts, bidding, accounting, and other business procedures to commercial practices when possible; eliminating outdated regulations that delayed purchases; and announcing military purchase requirements on data interchanges normally used by private business to increase vendor competition.

In June 1994 the secretary signed a directive ordering the armed forces to buy products and components to the extent possible from commercial off-the-shelf sources (his phrase was &quot;commercial state-of-the-art technology&quot;), rather than from defense contractors, signaling a major departure from the traditional &quot;milspec&quot; over 30,000 military specifications and standards that actually inflated the cost of military items.

In March 1996 Perry approved a new DoD comprehensive acquisition policy that emphasized commercial practices and products. Program managers and other acquisition officials would have the power to use their professional judgment in purchasing. The plan canceled more than 30 separate acquisition policy memoranda and report formats and replaced existing policy documents with new ones that were about 90% shorter. Perry considered these reforms one of his most important accomplishments, and saw savings generated by the new practices as part of the key to adequate funding of the military in an era of continuing tight budgets.

A token of the Perry agenda&#x27;s power is the 1995 merger between Lockheed Corporation and Martin Marietta. The resulting company, Lockheed Martin, is still as of 2024 the largest defense contractor on the planet. Another token is the third-ranked Northrop Grumman company, which was formed in 1994 when Northrop Corporation purchased Grumman Corporation.

In a further effort to save money Perry resorted to base closures and realignments. In May 1994 he and General John M. Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, announced that Defense would go forward, as required by law, with a 1995 round of base closings. In doing so Defense would consider the economic impact on the affected communities and the capacity to manage the reuse of closed facilities, and in March 1995 Perry released DoD&#x27;s 1995 base realignment and closure (BRAC) plan, recommending 146 actions. He estimated that implementing BRAC 95 would bring one-time costs of $3.8 billion and net savings of $4 billion within a six-year period.

===Foreign relations===
At the time of his appointment it was not expected that Perry would involve himself aggressively in foreign policy. He quickly belied this impression. Within days of taking office he left Washington on his first trip abroad to confer with European defense ministers. In April 1994 the &quot;Economist&quot;, in an article entitled &quot;Perrypatetic,&quot; observed: &quot;The man who has started to sound like a secretary of state is in fact the defense secretary, William Perry. ... He is popping up in public all over the place and moving into the strategy business in a big way.&quot; In fact, Perry traveled abroad in his three-year tenure more than any previous secretary. Unlike most of his predecessors, Perry paid attention to the other nations in the Americas, hosting the first Conference of Defense Ministers of the Americas at Williamsburg, Virginia, in 1995 and attending the second conference in 1996 in Argentina. His extensive travel matched his direct style. In his travels, he emphasized personal contact with rank and file members of the armed forces. His frequent trips also reflected the demands of the large number of foreign crises that occurred during his term, including several requiring the deployment of U.S. forces.

====NATO====

Perry strongly supported the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. He made major efforts to promote its Partnership for Peace Program, which the Clinton administration saw as a way to link NATO with the new Eastern European democracies, including Russia, and as a compromise between the wishes of many of the Eastern European countries to become full NATO members and Russia&#x27;s determined opposition. Individual nations could join the Partnership for Peace under separate agreements with NATO, and many did so, enabling them to participate in NATO joint training and military exercises without becoming formal members of the alliance. Perry conferred several times with Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev in an effort to allay Russia&#x27;s worries about and secure its membership in the Partnership for Peace. The issue remained outstanding when Perry left office in early 1997, by which time NATO had developed tentative plans to admit a few former Warsaw Pact members during the summer of 1997.

====Russia====
Although he recognized that the reform movement in Russia might not succeed, Perry did everything he could to improve relations with Moscow. He stressed the need for continuing military cooperation with and aid to the states of the former Soviet Union to facilitate destruction of their nuclear weapons. He used the Cooperative Threat Reduction Act of 1992 (the Nunn-Lugar program), which provided funds for the dismantling of nuclear weapons in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan, to diminish the nuclear threat. He urged Congress to continue the threat reduction program, defending it against claims that in reality it provided foreign aid to the Russian Armed Forces. By June 1996 when Perry traveled to Ukraine to observe the completion of that country&#x27;s transfer of nuclear warheads to Russia under the Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances, the only former Soviet missiles still outside of Russia were in Belarus. Perry testified in favor of U.S. ratification of the START II treaty, completed in 1996; in October 1996 he spoke to a session of the Russian State Duma in Moscow, urging its members to ratify the treaty.

====Asia====
In Asia, like former defense secretary Caspar Weinberger a decade earlier, Perry endeavored to improve relations with both the People&#x27;s Republic of China and Japan. He was the first secretary of defense to visit China after the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, when PRC authorities forcibly crushed a dissident movement. While not ignoring long-standing problems such as the PRC&#x27;s weapons sales abroad and its human rights abuses, he believed that the U.S. and the PRC should cooperate militarily. He made some progress, although when China threatened Taiwan just before the latter&#x27;s presidential election in March 1996, the United States sent two aircraft carrier task forces to the area to counter the Chinese.

In 1995 a young girl was raped by three U.S. servicemen stationed in Okinawa, Japan. The crime led to demands that the United States diminish its military presence on the island. Late in 1996, the United States agreed to vacate 20% of the land it used on Okinawa and to close some military facilities, including Marine Corps Air Station Futenma. The Japanese agreed that the 28,000 United States Forces Japan troops stationed on Okinawa could remain.

====Bosnian War====
A serious ongoing international crisis was in Bosnia. When Perry took over in 1994, the Bosnian Serb Army of Republika Srpska were besieging Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, but the Serbs were forced to draw back in face of a UN ultimatum and warning of airstrikes. Shortly thereafter the Serbs threatened to overrun the Bosnian Muslim city of Goražde in eastern Bosnia. Perry at first ruled out U.S. military action, but in April 1994 U.S. fighter planes participated in UN airstrikes at Goražde, causing the Bosnian Serbs to retreat.

In a major statement on Bosnia in June 1994, Perry attempted to clarify U.S. policy there, declaring that the conflict did involve U.S. national interests, humanitarian and otherwise, but not &quot;supreme&quot; interests. To limit the spread of violence in Bosnia, the United States had committed air power under NATO to stop the bombardment of Bosnian cities, provide air support for UN troops, and carry out humanitarian missions. Perry and the White House resisted congressional pressures to lift an arms embargo imposed earlier by the United Nations on all sides in the Bosnian War. During 1994–95 some senators, including Republican leader Bob Dole, wanted the embargo against the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina lifted to enable them to resist the Republika Srpska more effectively. Perry thought this might provoke Serb attacks and perhaps force the commitment of U.S. ground troops. In August 1995 Clinton vetoed legislation to lift the arms embargo. (In fact, the Bosnian Muslims had been receiving arms from outside sources.) Meanwhile, although it had stated consistently that it would not send U.S. ground forces to Bosnia, in December 1994 the Clinton administration expressed willingness to commit troops to help rescue UN peacekeepers in Bosnia if they were withdrawn. In May 1995, after the Bosnian Serbs had taken about 3,000 peacekeepers hostage, the United States, France, Germany, and Russia resolved to provide a larger and better-equipped UN force.

Applying strong pressure, in November 1995 the United States persuaded the presidents of Serbia and Montenegro, Bosnia, and Croatia to attend a conference in Dayton, Ohio, that after much contention produced a peace agreement, formally signed in Paris in mid-December. It provided for the cessation of hostilities, withdrawal of the combatants to specified lines, creation of a separation zone, and the stationing in Bosnia of a Peace Implementation Force (IFOR). The North Atlantic Council, with Perry participating, had decided in September 1995 to develop a NATO-led force to implement any peace agreement for Bosnia, setting the force size at 60,000 troops, including 20,000 from the United States. In congressional testimony in November, Perry explained why U.S. troops should go to Bosnia: The war threatened vital U.S. political, economic, and security interests in Europe; there was a real opportunity to stop the bloodshed; the United States was the only nation that could lead a NATO force to implement the peace, and the risks to the United States of allowing the war to continue were greater than the risks of the planned military operation.

The first U.S. troops moved into Bosnia in early December 1995, and by late January 1996, the full complement of 20,000 had been deployed. Although Perry had said earlier that they would leave Bosnia within a year, in June 1996 he hinted at a longer stay if NATO decided the peace in Bosnia would not hold without them. The secretary agreed to a study proposed in September 1996 by NATO defense ministers for a follow-on force to replace IFOR. Finally in November 1996, after the presidential election, Clinton announced, with Perry&#x27;s support, that the United States would provide 8,500 troops to a NATO follow-on force. The U.S. force would be gradually reduced in 1997 and 1998 and completely withdrawn by June 1998.

====Haitian Crisis====
Perry also inherited from Aspin the problem of what to do about Haïti, where a military junta continued to refuse to reinstate the deposed president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide. In the spring of 1994, debate persisted in the United States Congress on whether to intervene militarily to oust Raoul Cédras, the military leader, and restore Aristide to power. President Clinton said that the United States would not rule out the use of military force and also suggested that military teams to train local security and police forces might be sent to Haïti. In the meantime, large numbers of refugees fled from Haïti in boats, hoping to gain admittance to the United States. U.S. vessels intercepted most of them at sea and took them to the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba.

In spite of continuing pressure and obvious preparations in the United States for an invasion of Haïti, the junta refused to yield. On September 19, 1994, just after former President Jimmy Carter negotiated an agreement, the United States sent in military forces with UN approval. Haïti&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; leaders, including Cédras, agreed to step down by October 15 so that Aristide could return to the presidency. By the end of September, 19,600 U.S. troops were in Haïti as part of Operation Uphold Democracy. At the end of March 1995, a UN commander took over, and the United States provided 2,400 of the 6,000-man UN force that would remain in Haïti until February 1996. Given the opposition to the mission when it began, the primary U.S. concern was to do its limited job and avoid casualties among its forces. With the final withdrawal of U.S. troops, and Aristide&#x27;s duly elected successor installed in office in February 1996, the Pentagon and the Clinton administration could label the Haitian operation a success up to that point.

====North Korea====
North Korea posed another serious problem for Perry, who backed the administration&#x27;s policy of pressuring Kim Il Sung&#x27;s Communist regime to allow monitoring of its nuclear facilities by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Between February and October 1994 the United States increased its pressures on North Korea. Perry warned in March that the United States would not permit the development of an arsenal of nuclear weapons. War was not imminent, he said, but he indicated that he had ordered military preparations for a possible conflict. Soon thereafter Perry stated that the United States would propose UN economic sanctions if North Korea did not allow international inspection of its planned withdrawal of spent fuel from a nuclear reactor fuel containing sufficient plutonium to produce four or five nuclear weapons. North Korea began removing the nuclear fuel from the Yongbyon nuclear facility in May 1994 without granting the IAEA inspection privileges, and later said it withdraw from the IAEA and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Perry offered three options to Clinton: sanctions against North Korea through the United Nations, a limited F-117 air strike on the Yongbyon facility, or a massive military buildup in preparation for full-scale war with North Korea. Under the belief that all three options would lead to war, Clinton leaned towards the military buildup option before negotiations between former US President Jimmy Carter and Kim mediated the situation.

On October 21, 1994, the United States and North Korea signed the Agreed Framework after lengthy negotiations in Geneva, Switzerland, assisted again by former President Carter. The United States, Japan, South Korea, and other regional allies promised to provide North Korea with two light water nuclear reactors, at an eventual cost of $4 billion, to replace existing or partially constructed facilities that could produce plutonium for nuclear weapons. North Korea then agreed to open its nuclear facilities to international inspection, and the United States pledged to lift trade restrictions and provide heavy fuel oil for electric power generation. Perry considered this agreement better than risking a war in Korea and a continuation of North Korea&#x27;s nuclear program. He promised that he would ask Congress for money to build up U.S. forces in South Korea if the agreement broke down. Again a critical situation had moderated, but implementing the agreement proved difficult. By the end of Perry&#x27;s term, some issues remained outstanding, and tension between the two Koreas flared up from time to time. After his tenure, Clinton appointed Perry as North Korean policy coordinator in 1998, where he recommended continued diplomatic engagement with Kim Jong Il&#x27;s government.

====The Middle East====
In the Persian Gulf area, Ba&#x27;athist Iraq continued to have conflict, with periodic provocative moves by Saddam Hussein triggering U.S. military action. After the 1991 Gulf War, acting in accord with United Nations Security Council Resolution 688, the United States organized a coalition to enforce no-fly zones in Iraq, north of 36° and south of 32°. In a tragic accident in April 1994 two U.S. Air Force F-15 aircraft, operating in the no-fly zone north of the 36th parallel in Iraq, shot down two U.S. Army UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters after misidentifying them as Iraqi. This incident, with its high death toll, highlighted dramatically the complexities in dealing with Iraq in the aftermath of the 1991 Gulf War. Further, in October 1994, when several elite Iraqi Armed Forces divisions began to move toward the Iraq–Kuwait border, the United States mobilized ground, air, and naval forces in the area to counter the threat. Perry warned Iraq that the U.S. forces would take action if it did not move its Republican Guard units north of the 32nd parallel. Subsequently, the UN Security Council passed a resolution requiring Iraq to pull its troops back at least 150 miles from Kuwait&#x27;s border.

Iran, too, behaved aggressively, placing at least 6,000 troops in March 1995 on three islands at the mouth of the Persian Gulf claimed by both Iran and the United Arab Emirates. Perry stated that the Iranian moves threatened shipping in the Strait of Hormuz, a waterway on which moved a significant part of the world&#x27;s oil production. The United States worked with its allies in the Persian Gulf area to bolster their capacity to defend themselves and to use their collective strength through the Gulf Cooperation Council. Most important, in Perry&#x27;s judgment, was the determination of the United States to maintain a strong regional defense capability with aircraft and naval ships in the area, prepositioned equipment, standing operational plans, and access agreements with the Persian Gulf partners.

Provocative moves again by Iraq forced the United States to take strong action. When Saddam Hussein intervened in September 1996 by sending some 40,000 troops to assist one side in a dispute between two Kurdish factions in northern Iraq, he demonstrated that he was not deterred by a U.S. warning against using military force. Perry made clear that while no significant U.S. interests were involved in the factional conflict, maintaining stability in the region as a whole was vital to U.S. security and there would be a U.S. reaction. On both September 2 and 3, U.S. aircraft attacked Iraqi fixed surface-to-air missile (SAM) sites and air defense control facilities in the south, because, Perry explained, the United States saw the principal threat from Iraq to be against Kuwait.

Another tragic incident on June 25, 1996, revealed the continuing tension in the Middle East and the dangers involved in the U.S. military presence. Terrorists exploded a truck bomb at the Khobar Towers apartment complex housing U.S. Air Force personnel in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, killing 19 and wounding 500. In September 1996 an investigative panel set up by Perry recommended vigorous measures to deter, prevent, or mitigate the effects of future terrorist acts against U.S. personnel overseas, and further, that a solitary DoD element have responsibility for force protection. The panel found that the unit attacked at Dhahran had not taken every precaution it might have to protect the forces at Khobar Towers. Eventually, the Defense Department moved units from Dhahran to more remote areas in Saudi Arabia to provide better protection.

====Somalia====
U.S. involvement in Somalia, a problem during Aspin&#x27;s tenure, ended in 1994. Under the protection of U.S. Marines on ships offshore, the last U.S. forces left Somalia before the end of March, meeting a deadline set earlier by President Clinton. Later, in February 1995, more than 7,000 U.S. troops assisted in removing the remaining UN peacekeepers and weapons from Somalia in a markedly successful operation.

====Rwanda====
In another mission in Africa in 1994, the United States became involved in humanitarian efforts in Rwanda. A civil war between two rival ethnic groups, the Hutu and Tutsi, resulted in widespread death and destruction and the flight of hundreds of thousands of refugees from Rwanda into neighboring countries, including Zaire. Although not part of the UN peacekeeping operation in Rwanda, the United States provided humanitarian aid in the form of purified water, medicine, site sanitation, and other means. In July the Pentagon sent in aircraft and about 3,000 troops, most of them to Zaire. The U.S. forces also took control of and rebuilt the airport at Kigali, Rwanda&#x27;s capital, to aid in the distribution of food, medicine, and other supplies. The lack of a U.S. response to the Rwandan genocide was later considered a major foreign policy failure of the Bill Clinton administration by President Clinton and was due to fear of repeating the Battle of Mogadishu.

===Accomplishments and resignation===
In January 1996, Perry talked about experiences over the past year in which he never thought a Secretary of Defense would be involved. At the top of the list was witnessing participation of a Russian Ground Forces brigade in a U.S. Army division in the Bosnian peacekeeping operation. The others—Dayton, Ohio, becoming synonymous with peace in the Balkans; helping the Russian defense minister blow up a Minuteman missile silo in Missouri; watching United States and Russian troops training together in Kansas; welcoming former Warsaw Pact troops in Louisiana; operating a school at Garmisch, Germany, to teach former Soviet and East European military officers about democracy, budgeting, and testifying to a parliament; dismantling the military specifications system for acquisition; cutting the ear off a pig in Kazakhstan, and eating rendered Manchurian toad fat in China. These things, Perry said, demonstrate &quot;just how much the world has changed, just how much our security has changed, just how much the Department of Defense has changed, and just how much my job has changed.&quot;

Shortly after President Clinton&#x27;s reelection in November 1996, Perry made known his decision to step down as secretary. He spoke of his growing frustration over working with a Congress so partisan that it was harming the military establishment, and said that he did not think the results of the 1996 congressional election would decrease the partisanship. He later explained that his decision to retire was &quot;largely due to the constant strain of sending U.S. military personnel on life-threatening missions.&quot;

As he left the Pentagon, Perry listed what he thought were his most important accomplishments: establishing effective working relationships with U.S. military leaders; improving the lot of the military, especially enlisted men and women; managing the military drawdown; instituting important acquisition reforms; developing close relationships with many foreign defense ministers; effectively employing military strength and resources in Bosnia, Haiti, Korea, and the Persian Gulf area; dramatically reducing the nuclear legacy of the Cold War; and promoting the Partnership for Peace within NATO. His disappointments included failure to obtain Russian ratification of the START II treaty; slowness in securing increases in the budget for weapon systems modernization; and the faulty perceptions of the Gulf War illness syndrome held by some of the media and much of the public. At a ceremony for Perry in January 1997 General Shalikashvili noted the departing secretary&#x27;s relationship with the troops. &quot;Surely,&quot; Shalikashvili said, &quot;Bill Perry has been the GI&#x27;s secretary of defense. When asked his greatest accomplishment as secretary, Bill Perry didn&#x27;t name an operation or a weapons system. He said that his greatest accomplishment was his very strong bond with our men and women in uniform.&quot;

Perry&#x27;s career in the Department of Defense actually spanned eight years of profound changes—four years as Undersecretary for Research and Engineering in 1977 to 1981, a year as Deputy Secretary from 1993 to 1994, and three years as Secretary.

==Later career==
===Academia and corporate boards===
After he left the Pentagon, Perry returned to San Francisco to join the board of Hambrecht and Quist as a senior adviser.
Perry rejoined the faculty at Stanford University, becoming a professor at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies, co-director of the Preventive Defense Project at the Stanford University Center for International Security and Cooperation, and the Michael and Barbara Berberian Professor (emeritus) at Stanford&#x27;s School of Engineering.

In 1999, Perry was awarded the James A. Van Fleet Award by The Korea Society.

Perry sits on the advisory board of the Commonwealth Club of California. Perry currently sits on the board of directors for Xyleco. Perry joined the financial board of the Thailand-based manufacturing company, Fabrinet in 2008. He was a board member of Theranos, a Silicon Valley biotech company which defrauded more than $700 million from its investors before it collapsed.

On June 17, 2006, Perry gave the featured commencement speech to engineering and science graduates at the University of California, Santa Barbara.

William Perry appeared as an important and influential person in the development of Silicon Valley, in the PBS documentary, &quot;Silicon Valley: 100 Year Renaissance&quot; (1998).

On October 16, 2008, Perry was awarded the Sylvanus Thayer Award by the United States Military Academy.

===Work to eliminate nuclear weapons===
Perry is a founding board member of the Nuclear Threat Initiative, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization working to reduce the threat of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons. He currently has an emeritus status on the board. Perry is an advisory board member for the Partnership for a Secure America, a not-for-profit organization dedicated to recreating the bipartisan center in American national security and foreign policy. Perry is currently chair of the Board of Sponsors for the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists and frequently speaks at &quot;Bulletin&quot; events. He is a Member of the Supervisory Council of the International Luxembourg Forum on Preventing Nuclear Catastrophe. Perry is also a member of the board of directors of the Center for a New American Security, a Washington, DC–based think tank that specializes in U.S. national security issues. Perry is also on the advisory board of the Truman National Security Project, a progressive leadership institute that trains the next generation of foreign policy and national security leaders.

In March 2006, he was appointed to the Iraq Study Group, a group formed to give advice on the U.S. government&#x27;s Iraq policy.
In 2007, Secretary Perry joined three other eminent statesmen, former Secretaries of State George P. Shultz and Henry Kissinger, and former Senator Sam Nunn in calling for the United States to take the lead in reducing and eliminating nuclear weapons. Their op-ed, &quot;A World Free of Nuclear Weapons&quot;, published in the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;, reverberated throughout the world, and is one of the key factors that has convinced political leaders and experts internationally that the conditions are in place to achieve that goal. The four men published four subsequent op-eds in the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;, including one on March 5, 2013: &quot;Next Steps in Reducing Nuclear Risks: The Pace of Non-Proliferation Work Today Doesn&#x27;t Match the Urgency of the Threat&quot;. They subsequently created the Nuclear Security Project to galvanize global action to reduce urgent nuclear dangers and build support for their vision and the steps to achieve them. The Nuclear Threat Initiative serves as coordinator of the NSP, in conjunction with Stanford University&#x27;s Hoover Institution. In 2010, the four produced the documentary Nuclear Tipping Point. The film is introduced by General Colin Powell, narrated by Michael Douglas and includes interviews with California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.

In 2011, Perry joined a team of former government officials from various countries, formed under the auspices of the Governor of Hiroshima Prefecture Hidehiko Yuzaki to prepare a plan for the total abolition of nuclear weapons. This project is titled &quot;Hiroshima for Global Peace&quot;.

In 2013, Perry founded the William J. Perry Project to seek to promote greater public awareness about nuclear weapons and engage more people in acting to mitigate the growing threat they pose to humanity. The Project is a nonprofit venture supported with funds raised from private individuals and is sponsored by the Nuclear Threat Initiative.

In 2015, Perry published a memoir, &quot;My Journey at the Nuclear Brink,&quot; (Stanford Univ. Press), with a foreword by George P. Shultz. The memoir describes coming of age at the dawn of the nuclear age, and his later roles in managing the nuclear threat. He warned that: &quot;Today, the danger of some sort of a nuclear catastrophe is greater than it was during the Cold War and most people are blissfully unaware of this danger.”

On September 30, 2016, the &quot;New York Times&quot; published a Perry opinion editorial advocating, &quot; ... the United States can safely phase out its land-based intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) force ... &quot;. Perry believes that ICBM&#x27;s are turning more into liabilities than assets. Perry says it would save &quot;considerable cost&quot; and would prevent accidental nuclear war. With regards to an accidental nuclear war, Perry has experienced a false alarm for an incoming missile which later turned out to be a computer error. Perry&#x27;s experience was 40 years ago but our technology is still not perfect with the recent false alarm in 2018 Hawaii false missile alert. Perry says the major problem with ICBM&#x27;s are the &quot;non-recall&quot; ability which if these missiles are sent and it turns out to be a false alarm then there&#x27;s no turning back.

Perry is cited by the website of Los Angeles Congressman Ted Lieu for supporting legislation proposed by Lieu and U.S. Senator Ed Markey, Democrat from Massachusetts, that would limit President Donald Trump and future presidents&#x27; authority to launch a nuclear first strike against another country by requiring them to first get approval from Congress. The following quotation is attributed to Perry in Congressman Lieu&#x27;s website: &quot;During my period as Secretary of Defense, I never confronted a situation, or could even imagine a situation, in which I would recommend that the President make a first strike with nuclear weapons—understanding that such an action, whatever the provocation, would likely bring about the end of civilization. I believe that the legislation proposed by Congressman Lieu and Senator Markey recognizes that terrible reality. Certainly, a decision that momentous for all of civilization should have the kind of checks and balances on Executive powers called for by our Constitution.&quot;

Perry was profiled in the Radiolab episode Nukes in 2017. He argued for the need for checks and balances for a nuclear strike by the U.S.

=== Center for Hemispheric Defense Studies (CHDS) ===
On April 2, 2013, the Center for Hemispheric Defense Studies (CHDS) was officially renamed the William J. Perry Center for Hemispheric Defense Studies (The Perry Center) in recognition of its founder, the 19th U.S. Secretary of Defense, Dr. William J. Perry. This change honored his role in establishing the center, which originated from the first Defense Ministerial of the Americas in 1995, when Perry promoted regional defense cooperation and the training of civilians in security matters.

=== Books ===

With Tom Collina of the Ploughshares Fund, Perry wrote the book &quot;The Button: The New Nuclear Arms Race and Presidential Power from Truman to Trump&quot;. This book concludes with a ten-point plan for nuclear weapons safety:

# End presidential sole nuclear authority.
# Prohibit launch on warning.
# Prohibit first use.
# Retire all ICBMs and scale back the nuclear rebuild.
# Save New START and go farther.
# Limit strategic missile defenses.
# Don&#x27;t wait for treaties.
# Engage diplomatically with North Korea and Iran.
# Bring the bomb into the new mass movement.
# Elect a committed president.

===Other political activities===
Perry, along with all other living former secretaries of defense, ten in total, published a &quot;Washington Post&quot; op-ed piece in January 2021 telling President Donald Trump not to involve the military in determining the outcome of the 2020 elections.

<doc id="152792" wikidata="Q263322" url="?curid=152792" title="Elaine Chao">
<text>Elaine Lan Chao (born March 26, 1953) is an American businesswoman and former government official who served as United States secretary of labor in the administration of George W. Bush from 2001 to 2009 and as United States secretary of transportation in the administration of Donald Trump from 2017 to 2021. A member of the Republican Party, Chao was the first Asian American woman to serve in a presidential cabinet. She resigned as transportation secretary after the January 6 United States Capitol attack.

Chao was born in Taipei, Taiwan, to &quot;waishengren&quot; parents who fled China as a result of the Chinese Civil War. She immigrated to the United States when she was eight years old. Her father founded the Foremost Group, an American shipping company based in New York. Chao was raised in Queens, New York, and on Long Island, and received degrees from Mount Holyoke College and Harvard Business School. She worked for financial institutions before being appointed to senior positions in the Department of Transportation under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, including chair of the Federal Maritime Commission (1988–1989) and Deputy Secretary of Transportation (1989–1991). She served as director of the Peace Corps from 1991 to 1992 and as president of the United Way of America from 1993 to 1996. 

Chao has served on several &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 and nonprofit boards of directors, including the electric charger network provider ChargePoint since 2021. She is married to U.S. senator Mitch McConnell.

==Early life and education==

Elaine Chao was born in Taipei, Taiwan, on March 26, 1953, and immigrated to the United States when she was eight years old. She is the eldest of six daughters of Ruth Mulan Chu Chao, a historian from Anhui, and James S. C. Chao, a Shanghainese businessman who began his career as a merchant mariner and in 1964 founded the shipping company Foremost Maritime Corporation in New York City, which developed into the Foremost Group. In 1961, at the age of 8, Chao came to the United States on a 37-day freight ship journey along with her mother and two younger sisters. Her father had arrived in New York three years earlier and sent money home until the rest of the family could join him in the United States.

Chao described her early life in America as a typical immigrant story, noting that &quot;everything was foreign to us: the culture, people, language, traditions, and even the food.&quot; She spoke no English upon her arrival. Her father &quot;worked three jobs&quot; to support the family and the then-five family members lived in a one-bedroom apartment.

Chao attended Tsai Hsing Elementary School in Taiwan for kindergarten and first grade. She attended Syosset High School in Syosset, New York, in Nassau County on Long Island and was naturalized as a U.S. citizen at the age of 19.

Chao received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Economics from Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Massachusetts. In the second semester of her junior year, she studied money and banking at Dartmouth College. She received an MBA degree from Harvard Business School.

==Career==
===Early career===
Before being appointed to government work, Chao was a vice president for syndications at Bank of America Capital Markets Group in San Francisco, and she was an international banker at Citicorp in New York. She was granted a White House Fellowship during the Reagan Administration.

In 1986, Chao became Deputy Administrator of the Maritime Administration in the U.S. Department of Transportation. From 1988 to 1989, she served as chairwoman of the Federal Maritime Commission. In 1989, then-president George H.W. Bush nominated Chao to be Deputy Secretary of Transportation; she served from 1989 to 1991. From 1991 to 1992, she was the director of the Peace Corps. She was the first Asian Pacific American to serve in any of these positions. She expanded the Peace Corps&#x27; presence in Eastern Europe and Central Asia by establishing the first Peace Corps programs in Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, and the newly independent states of the former Soviet Union, including the first Peace Corps programs in Ukraine, Georgia, Armenia and Russia.

===Between Bush administrations===
Following her service in President George H.W. Bush&#x27;s administration, Chao worked from 1992 to 1996 as president and CEO of United Way of America. She was the first Asian Pacific American to hold that role. She is credited with returning credibility and public trust to the organization after a financial mismanagement scandal involving former president William Aramony. From 1996 until her appointment as Secretary of Labor, Chao worked at a conservative think tank in Washington, D.C. She was also a board member of the Independent Women&#x27;s Forum. She later returned to think tanks after leaving the government in January 2009.

Chao delivered a speech at the 2000 Republican National Convention.

===U.S. Secretary of Labor (2001–2009)===
Chao was the only cabinet member in the George W. Bush administration to serve for the entirety of his eight years. She was also the longest-serving Secretary of Labor since Frances Perkins, who served from 1933 to 1945 under President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Chao was unanimously confirmed by the Senate for her appointment as Secretary of Labor. Of Chao&#x27;s staff, Victoria Lipnic, Assistant Secretary for Employment Standards Administration, later became Member, EEOC and acting chair.

In 2004, the department issued revisions of the white-collar overtime regulations under the Fair Labor Standards Act.

====Union disclosure requirements====
In 2002, a major West Coast ports dispute costing the U.S. economy nearly $1billion daily was resolved when the Bush administration obtained a national emergency injunction against both the employers and the union under the Taft–Hartley Act for the first time since 1971. Led by Chao, in 2003, for the first time in more than 40 years, the department updated the labor union financial disclosure regulations under the Landrum–Griffin Act of 1959, which created more extensive disclosure requirements for union-sponsored pension plans and other trusts to prevent embezzlement or other financial mismanagement.

====Response to 9/11, Hurricane Katrina====
Following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, Chao&#x27;s Department of Labor disbursed grants to provide temporary jobs to assist in cleanup and restoration efforts in New York, as well as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration&#x27;s monitoring of health and safety of cleanup work being performed at the disaster sites including lower Manhattan. The department also provided unemployment insurance and income support to those who lost their jobs in the aftermath of September 11.

Following the 2005 hurricane season, which included hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma, the Labor Department disbursed nearly $380 million in grants to assist with cleanup work and provide benefits and services to those displaced by the storms. The Occupational Health and Safety Administration and other agencies deployed personnel to the region to provide safety training and uphold workers&#x27; rights. Chao set up an emergency response hotline dedicated to the Gulf Coast region for people seeking benefits and worker protection information.

====Government Accountability Office reports====
After analyzing 70,000 closed case files from 2005 to 2007, the Government Accountability Office reported that the Department&#x27;s Wage and Hour Division (WHD) inadequately investigated complaints from low- and minimum-wage workers alleging that employers failed to pay the federal minimum wage, required overtime, and failed to issue a last paycheck. The Department of Labor responded that the GAO investigation focused on individual complaints while the department remained focused on resolving complex and multi-employee complaints; from 1997 to 2007 the annual number of employees receiving back wages as a result of DOL action almost doubled and the dollar amount of back wages paid more than doubled. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; echoed that Chao&#x27;s department was criticized by some for &quot;walking away from its regulatory function&quot; but also praised by others for providing &quot;compliance assistance&quot; and &quot;helping companies abide by the law&quot; rather than &quot;punitive enforcement that … stifles economic growth.&quot;

A 2008 Government Accountability Office report noted that the Labor Department gave Congress inaccurate numbers which understated the expense of contracting out its employees&#x27; work to private firms during Chao&#x27;s tenure, which may have affected 22 employees at the department.

====Mining regulation====
Chao and the Bush administration proposed quadrupling the fines imposed against mining corporations for mine safety breaches and sued mine operators for failing to maintain safe working conditions. A 2007 report by the department&#x27;s Office of Inspector General (OIG) found that mine safety regulators did not conduct federally required inspections at more than one in seven of the country&#x27;s 731 underground coal mines in 2006, and that the number of worker deaths in mining accidents more than doubled to 47 in that year. The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) &quot;missed 147 inspections at 107 mines employing a total of 7,500 workers&quot;.

Mining disasters in 2006 and 2007 included West Virginia&#x27;s Sago Mine explosion, which killed 12 in January 2006; West Virginia&#x27;s Alma Mine fire, which killed two in January 2006; the Darby Mine No.1 explosion in Kentucky, where five miners died in May 2006; and the Crandall Canyon Mine collapse in Utah, which killed six workers and three rescuers in August 2007. Immediately following the Sago mine disaster, Secretary Chao vowed to &quot;take the necessary steps to ensure that this never happens again&quot;.

In 2010, the widows of the two men killed in the Alma Mine fire sued the federal government for wrongful death, citing lack of inspections, failure to act against violations, and conflicts of interest. &quot;MSHA&#x27;s review of the fire acknowledged significant lapses by inspectors, supervisors and district managers&quot; at the mine but the agency did not admit liability for the negligent inspections. In 2013, the appeals court ruled that MSHA can be held liable &quot;when a negligent inspection results in the wrongful death of a coal miner&quot;. The suit was settled in 2014; MSHA also agreed to develop a training course on preventing fires in underground mines.

====Workplace safety====
During her tenure, the Department of Labor achieved &quot;record low worker injury, illness and fatality rates; record back wages recovered; [and] record monetary recoveries for workers’ pension plans&quot;. A 2009 internal audit appraising an Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) initiative focusing on problematic workplaces for the past six years stated that employees had failed to gather needed data, conducted uneven inspections and enforcement, and failed to discern repeat fatalities because records misspelled the companies&#x27; names or failed to notice when two subsidiaries with the same owner were involved; it also noted that after rules changes in January 2008 the number of targeted companies declined by almost half.

===Post-Bush administration (2009–2017)===
In 2009, Chao resumed her previous role at a think tank, and she contributed to Fox News and other media outlets.

She also served as a director on a number of corporate and non-profit boards, including the Institute of Politics at Harvard Kennedy School, Wells Fargo, New York–Presbyterian Hospital, News Corp, Dole Food Company, and Protective Life Corporation. According to financial disclosure forms, Chao was slated to receive $1–5million as compensation for her service on the board of Wells Fargo. In June 2011, she was awarded the Woodrow Wilson Award for Public Service.

In January 2015, she resigned from the board of Bloomberg Philanthropies, which she had joined in 2012, because of its plans to significantly increase support for the Sierra Club&#x27;s &quot;Beyond Coal&quot; initiative.

In February 2017, the Associated Press reported that Chao was paid by a speaker&#x27;s bureau to give a speech regarding women&#x27;s empowerment to an organization later found to be linked to the People&#x27;s Mujahedin of Iran (aka Mojahedin-e Khalq or MEK), a group exiled from Iran after actions in the 1970s against the Shah of Iran and the Ayatollah Khomeini. Similar speeches were delivered by former Joint Chiefs of Staff General Hugh Shelton, Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps General James T. Conway, former National Security Advisor General James L. Jones, former CIA Directors Porter Goss and James Woolsey, former FBI Director Louis Freeh, former NYC Mayor Rudy Giuliani, and former Governors Howard Dean of Vermont and Ed Rendell of Pennsylvania.

===U.S. Secretary of Transportation (2017–2021)===

U.S. President-elect Donald Trump announced on November 29, 2016, that he would nominate Chao to be Secretary of Transportation. The U.S. Senate confirmed Chao on January 31, 2017, by a vote of 93–6, with her husband, then-Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, abstaining.

As Secretary of Transportation, Chao led the presidential delegation to the enthronement ceremony for Japanese emperor Naruhito. She led the U.S. delegation to the inauguration of Indonesia&#x27;s President Joko Widodo.

====Resignation following January 6====

On January 7, 2021, the day after the January 6 United States Capitol attack, Chao submitted her resignation effective January 11, 2021. She was then the highest-ranking member of the administration to resign due to the riots and the first cabinet officer to do so; her resignation cited the &quot;traumatic and entirely avoidable&quot; violence and stated that it &quot;deeply troubled&quot; her.

====Drone technology====
In 2017, Chao announced the establishment of a pilot program to test and evaluate the integration of civil and public drone operations into the airspace system. In 2018 ten applicants were selected to participate in the project. In 2019, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an air carrier and operator certificate to UPS Flight Forward for drone deliveries to a hospital campus in Raleigh, North Carolina. In December 2019, after multiple reports in Colorado and Nebraska of unidentified objects flying in formation at night over several remote rural counties, the FAA proposed a new rule that would require drones to be remotely identifiable.

Jeffrey A. Rosen chaired Chao&#x27;s New and Emerging Technologies Council (NETT) Chao and Rosen led DOTs efforts to safely enable the use of drones in the airspace, including in FAA&#x27;s drone pilot program. The DOT under Chao issued updated guidelines on automated or &quot;self-driving&quot; cars and trucks. He also helped with FAA&#x27;s successful efforts to reform its regulations and restore the US lead in enabling the largest number of private commercial space launches.

Under Chao, Rosen served as Chair of DOT&#x27;s Regulatory Reform Task Force. He and Chao focused on improving the infrastructure permitting process, and reforming the regulatory system to reduce costs.

==== COVID-19 responses ====
In May 2020, following the start of the COVID-19 outbreak and related changes to travel, Chao sternly warned airlines to follow their published ticket refund procedures, as well as DOT regulations, in light of high demand for travel changes. She demanded airlines provide cash refunds (as opposed to vouchers) when required by law, and urged them to provide cash refunds as broadly as possible.

Chao later announced the disbursement of $1.2 billion in grants to airports to maintain readiness for when passenger travel returned. The funds were distributed to 405 airports for infrastructure and safety improvements, such as improved runway lighting. Eight tribal governments were also awarded separate transportation funds to maintain infrastructure during COVID.

Chao also worked to permit truckers to deliver essential goods to New York City, which had been attempting to impose a 14-day quarantine on out-of-state truckers bringing goods into the city. The city dropped the requirement following federal government pressure. Her department also worked with state governments to maintain access to highway rest areas, including permitting food trucks to provide hot food to truckers and travelers.

The CARES Act enabled the Department of Transportation to make $114 billion of federal aid available for the transportation sector.  The largest allocation was $25 billion to support local public transit systems, of which $22.7 billion was dedicated to large and small urban areas and the remaining $2.2 billion for rural areas. The Act also made available $10 billion for grants to commercial and general aviation airports for capital expenditures, operating expenses such as payroll and utilities, and debt payments; and a $1.02 billion allocation for grants to Amtrak to cover lost revenues, buy fuel and construction materials, and maintain its route network. The CARES Act also enabled the department to provide assistance to the aviation sector through loans and loan guarantees and grants for worker and contractor pay and benefits.

====Other proposals====
In March 2019, Chao announced the formation of the Non-Traditional and Emerging Transportation Technology (NETT) Council, an internal Department of Transportation group for identifying &quot;jurisdictional and regulatory gaps&quot; when considering new transportation technologies. In April 2019, the FAA released proposed new regulations to modernize the rules for commercial space flight launches and reentries. At a congressional hearing in July 2019, the president of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation criticized the proposal as not delivering on its stated goals.

In October 2019, Chao launched the Rural Opportunities to Use Transportation for Economic Success (ROUTES) initiative, intended to improve rural transportation infrastructure.  It sought to achieve this goal by developing tools and information, aggregating DOT resources, and providing technical assistance. The program is intended to consider the unique needs of rural transportation networks to meet national goals of safety, mobility, and economic competitiveness.

The US Department of Transportation reportedly sought to cut funding and loan guarantees for domestic American shipping companies, shipyards, and shipbuilders. These proposed budget cuts were rejected by Congress. Chao&#x27;s Department also sought for three years to prevent funding for a program that supports the viability of small domestic US shipyards, and a separate program that issues loan guarantees for the construction or reconstruction of ships with American registration.

==== Controversies ====
In 2013, liberal SuperPAC Progress Kentucky tweeted about Mitch McConnell&#x27;s &quot;Chinese wife&quot; and alleged that she is why &quot;your job moved to China.&quot; The tweets were removed following an investigation by NPR that noted Chao was a U.S. citizen, was born in Taiwan, and that the PAC had failed to file required disclosures. A similar message by a Kentucky Democrat in 2014 claimed that Chao &quot;isn&#x27;t from KY [Kentucky], she is Asian.&quot; An apology was issued by the Kentucky Democratic Party. In 2021 Chao spoke publicly against incidents of anti-Asian harassment.

Critics have claimed that her family&#x27;s shipping company, Foremost Group has ties to China. From January 2018 to April 2019, 72% of the total tonnage of chartered cargo shipped by Foremost was shipped to and from China. During Mitch McConnell&#x27;s reelection campaign in 2020, his Democratic opponent Amy McGrath accused McConnell of making &quot;millions from China.&quot; &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called these claims &quot;spurious&quot; and rated them &quot;three Pinocchios&quot; out of a possible four.

As Secretary of Transportation, Chao appeared in at least a dozen interviews with her 96-year-old father, James, the founder of her family&#x27;s shipping company. Some media outlets said the appearances raised ethical concerns, as public officials are prohibited from using their office to profit others or themselves. The Transportation Department&#x27;s inspector general cited numerous instances where Chao&#x27;s office helped promote her family&#x27;s shipping business. The inspector general asked the Trump administration&#x27;s Justice Department in December 2020 to consider a criminal investigation into Chao, but the DOJ denied the request. Federal disclosures cited by &quot;The New York Times&quot; revealed a gift to Chao and her husband from Chao&#x27;s father valued between $5million and $25million. 

Chao pledged in 2017 to divest into cash the &quot;deferred stock units&quot; (non-transferrable stock equivalents) she had earned while she was on the board of directors of Vulcan Materials by April 2018. After the Wall Street Journal and other major news outlets reported in late May 2019 that she was still holding the stock, worth $250,000 to $500,000, she sold it on June 3, 2019, for a gain of $50,000 since April 2018; a report by the Inspector General did &quot;not identify any evidence of a financial conflict of interest.&quot;

An October 2018 Politico analysis found that Chao had more than 290 hours of appointments which were labelled as &quot;private&quot; during working hours on working days in the first 14 months of her tenure as Secretary of Transportation, which former Department of Transportation officials described as unusual. DoT officials stated that the &quot;private&quot; labeling existed to help ensure Chao&#x27;s security.

In June 2019, &quot;Politico&quot; reported that in 2017 Chao had designated her aide Todd Inman as a special liaison &quot;to help with grant applications and other priorities&quot; for Transportation Department projects in the state of Kentucky, the only state to have such a liaison. Inman was to act as an intermediary between the department, local Kentucky officials, and Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell, who is Chao&#x27;s husband. This resulted in grants of at least $78million for projects in Mitch McConnell strongholds Boone County and Owensboro. Inman had worked on the 2008 and 2014 re-election campaigns of McConnell; McConnell and local officials brought up the grants when he announced in Owensboro in December 2018 that he was running for re-election in 2020. Inman later became Chao&#x27;s chief of staff. However, the Inspector General &quot;did not find any irregularities&quot; with respect to grants benefitting Kentucky and saw awards to Kentucky that were &quot;consistent with other States&#x27; results&quot; and &quot;did not find evidence of steering&quot; and concluded that the investigation &quot;did not uncover evidence that Mr. Inman influenced grant awards benefiting Kentucky or gave Kentucky applicants an improper advantage.&quot; 

In May 2020, the Trump administration removed the acting Inspector General of the Transportation Department, Mitch Behm. Behm, who was not a political appointee, was conducting an investigation into whether Secretary Elaine Chao was giving preferential treatment to projects in Kentucky. Her husband, Mitch McConnell, is the Senator of Kentucky and faced a re-election bid at the time. Trump appointed Howard &quot;Skip&quot; Elliott as interim Inspector General of the Transportation Department to replace Behm. However, at the same time, Elliott served in a dual role where Chao was his boss. Thus, Elliott was head of an office that was investigating his own actions and those of Chao.

In September 2019, the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Reform began an investigation into whether she used political office to benefit her family&#x27;s business interests. A September 16 letter from the Oversight committee to Chao documented allegations that the Department of Transportation was forced to cancel a trip to China in 2017 that Chao had planned to take because State Department ethics officials challenged her attempts to include her family members in official meetings with the Chinese government. The trip was canceled due to scheduling issues and no ethics charges were sustained.

On March 4, 2021, the Inspector General released their report regarding numerous ethics violations, including using department resources for personal errands and for promoting her father&#x27;s biography. It also stated that it had referred its investigation to the Justice Department and the U.S. Attorney&#x27;s Office in Washington D.C. for criminal prosecution in December 2020. Both declined to open criminal investigations into Chao.

After her resignation in January 2021 in protest over the January 6 United States Capitol attack, President Trump referred to Chao using a racial slur and labeled the Taiwan-born US citizen as a &quot;China lover.&quot; The slur was immediately condemned by Republican, Democratic, Asian-American and other community leaders including the CEO of the Anti-Defamation League. Trump also referred to Chao as &quot;crazy.&quot;

===Post-Trump administration===

In August 2021, Chao was elected to the board of directors of the Kroger supermarket chain. In 2021, Chao also joined the Board of Trustees of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.

===Awards and honorary degrees===
Chao holds 38 honorary doctorates, including an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from Georgetown McDonough School of Business in 2015. She was initiated into Omicron Delta Kappa at SUNY Plattsburgh as an &quot;honoris causa&quot; initiate in 1996. In 2006, inaugural class of winner of the Great Immigrants Award named by Carnegie Corporation of New York.

==Personal life==
In 1993, Chao married Mitch McConnell, U.S. Senator from Kentucky.

The University of Louisville&#x27;s Ekstrom Library opened the &quot;McConnell-Chao Archives&quot; in November 2009. It is a major component of the university&#x27;s McConnell Center.

From July 2022 onward, Trump had criticized McConnell&#x27;s leadership on social media and directed attacks at Chao, including calling her &quot;Coco Chow,&quot; seen by some as overtly racist. In a statement to Politico in January 2023, Chao said that people had &quot;deliberately misspelled or mispronounced my name. Asian Americans have worked hard to change that experience for the next generation. He doesn’t seem to understand that, which says a whole lot more about him than it will ever say about Asian Americans.&quot;

===Campaigning===
In the two years leading up to the 2014 U.S. Senate elections, during which time Chao was not in public office, Chao &quot;headlined fifty of her own events and attended hundreds more with and on behalf of&quot; her husband and was seen as &quot;a driving force of his reelection campaign&quot; and eventual victory over Democratic candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes, who had portrayed McConnell as &quot;anti-woman&quot;. After winning the election, McConnell said, &quot;The biggest asset I have by far is the only Kentucky woman who served in a president&#x27;s cabinet, my wife, Elaine Chao.&quot;

She has been described by Jan Karzen, a longtime friend of McConnell&#x27;s, as adding &quot;a softer touch&quot; to McConnell&#x27;s style by speaking of him &quot;in a feminine, wifely way&quot;. She has also been described as &quot;the campaign hugger&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described Chao as &quot;unapologetically ambitious&quot;.

Chao&#x27;s father has donated &quot;millions of dollars&quot; to the Chao-McConnell family. Chao&#x27;s extended family has given more than a million dollars to McConnell&#x27;s campaigns. The extended family is also a top contributor to the Republican Party of Kentucky, giving it approximately $525,000 over two decades.

===Family===

Chao has five younger sisters, including Angela, former CEO of the Foremost Group. In February 2024, Angela died after backing her car into a pond.

Chao&#x27;s sister Grace is married to Gordon Hartogensis who served as director of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), a part of the Labor Department, in May 2019. Hartogensis co-founded forecasting-software company Petrolsoft in 1989, which was purchased for $60million by Aspen Technology in 2000. He founded and led application software company Auric Technology LLC until it was sold to a company based in Mexico in 2011 and then helped govern the Hartogensis Family Trust.

In April 2008, Chao&#x27;s father gave Chao and McConnell between $5million and $25million.

In 2012, the Chao family donated $40million to Harvard Business School for scholarships to students of Chinese heritage and for the Ruth Mulan Chu Chao Center, an executive education building named for Chao&#x27;s late mother. It is the first Harvard Business School building named after a woman and the first building named after an American of Asian ancestry. Ruth Mulan Chu Chao returned to school at age 51 to earn a master&#x27;s degree in Asian literature and history from St. John&#x27;s University in the Queens borough of New York City.

Elaine Chao along with the Chao family are Christians.

<text>Alexis Margaret Herman (born July 16, 1947) formerly served as the 23rd U.S. Secretary of Labor under President Bill Clinton; she was the first African-American to hold the position. Prior to serving as Secretary, she was Assistant to the President and Director of the White House Office of Public Engagement.

Herman grew up in Mobile, Alabama. After college, she worked to improve employment opportunities for black laborers and women. She then joined the administration of Jimmy Carter, working as director of the Labor Department&#x27;s Women&#x27;s Bureau. She became active in the Democratic party, working in the campaigns of Jesse Jackson and then serving as chief of staff for the Democratic National Committee under Ronald H. Brown. She joined the cabinet of President Bill Clinton in 1997.

Following the defeat of Al Gore in the 2000 presidential election, Herman remained active in Democratic politics, in addition to her participation in the private sector, serving on the boards of corporations such as Coca-Cola and Toyota.

==Early life and education==
Herman was born on July 16, 1947, in Mobile, Alabama, the daughter of politician Alex Herman and schoolteacher Gloria Caponis, and raised in a Catholic household. Her father became Alabama&#x27;s first black ward leader. She later recounted how members of the white supremacist group, the Ku Klux Klan, assaulted her father when she was five years old. When Herman was growing up in Mobile, schools remained racially segregated. Her parents opted to send Alexis to parochial school, in part because the teachers included white nuns and priests, and thus would expose her to greater diversity.

Herman attended the Heart of Mary High School. As a sophomore, she was suspended for questioning the diocese&#x27;s exclusion of black students from religious pageants in which white students participated. Following a week of objection from the parents of Herman&#x27;s fellow black classmates, she was re-admitted.

After graduating from high school, Herman attended Edgewood College in Madison, Wisconsin, and Spring Hill College in Mobile. She transferred to Xavier University of Louisiana in New Orleans, where she became an active member of the Gamma Alpha Chapter of the Delta Sigma Theta sorority and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Sociology in 1969.

==Career==
After college, Herman returned to Mobile to help desegregate their parochial schools, including the school she herself attended. She was then a social worker with Catholic charities in Pascagoula, Mississippi, where she advocated for the city&#x27;s shipyard to offer training to unskilled black laborers. After Pascagoula, Herman moved to Atlanta, Georgia where she worked as a director of the Southern Regional Council&#x27;s Black Women&#x27;s Employment Program, a program designed to promote minority women into managerial or technical jobs.

Later, working at New York based consulting firm RTP, Herman led programs designed to provide apprenticeships for women in nontraditional jobs. At RTP, she met Ray Marshall. After Jimmy Carter won the Presidency in 1977, he and his incoming Labor Secretary Marshall asked Herman to be director of the Labor Department&#x27;s Women&#x27;s Bureau. At age 29, she was the youngest person to hold the position, which required her to work towards improving business opportunities for women. She worked to encourage corporations to hire more minority women, with companies like Coca-Cola, Delta Airlines, and General Motors making increased diversity a priority in their hiring process.

In 1981, at the end of the Carter administration, Herman left her job in the Labor Department and founded the consulting firm, A.M. Herman &amp; Associates. Herman and the firm worked with corporations on a variety of marketing and management issues, including how to develop training programs, marketing strategies, and organizational strategies. She managed the convention team for Jesse Jackson in his 1984 and 1988 bids for the Democratic Party&#x27;s presidential nomination. Her role working for Jackson&#x27;s campaign led Herman to serve as chief of staff to Democratic National Committee Chairman Ronald H. Brown, and later as vice chair of the 1992 Democratic National Convention.

===Director of the Office of Public Liaison===

After Bill Clinton&#x27;s victory in the 1992 Presidential election, Herman became deputy director of the Presidential Transition Office. Clinton then appointed her director of the White House Office of Public Liaison, where she was responsible for the administration&#x27;s relations with interest groups. In that role, Herman repeatedly organized informal dinners to advance White House initiatives or assuage key groups. She earned the support of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the Congressional Black Caucus as part of her outreach efforts. Herman also earned the respect of members of the business community as part of her effort to gain support for the Clinton Administration&#x27;s trade deal, the North American Free Trade Agreement. Her time as director also included the death of Commerce Secretary, and Herman&#x27;s former boss at the Democratic National Committee, Ronald Brown in a plane crash. As director, Herman made arrangements for public and private grieving following the death. The tragedy strengthened Herman&#x27;s bond with Present Clinton, who like Herman had been close to Brown.

===Secretary of Labor===
In 1996, President Clinton announced his intention to nominate Herman as Secretary of Labor to replace outgoing Secretary Robert Reich. Labor unions publicly supported the nomination, although they had mostly supported other potential nominees such as Harris Wofford, Esteban Edward Torres, and Alan Wheat. Herman&#x27;s Senate confirmation was delayed twice. The first resulted from questions regarding her role in organizing White House coffees Clinton used as fundraisers. The second was because Senate Republicans refused to allow a vote on her nomination, as part of their opposition to a proposed executive order related to federal construction projects, which Clinton eventually abandoned. With the delays over, the Senate Labor Committee held its hearing on her nomination on March 18, 1997. Then on April 30, 1997, the Senate voted to confirm by a vote of 85–13. Herman was sworn in on May 9, 1997. She became the first African-American, and the fifth woman, to serve in the position.

As Secretary of Labor, Herman oversaw the Department of Labor, which at the time employed 17,000 people and operated on a $39 billion annual budget. The Department of Labor is tasked with enforcing a variety of workplace laws and regulations, including safety issues and anti-discrimination. During Herman&#x27;s tenure, American unemployment was at its lowest level in decades.

She earned praise from her peers for her handling of the 1997 United Parcel Service (UPS) workers strike, the largest strike in the United States in two decades. After the strike began in August, Herman met privately with the Teamsters&#x27; president and the UPS chairman to frame the issues. She was an instrumental mediator in the talks, and the strike was settled after 15 days. Herman&#x27;s role in resolving the strike raised her public profile as she began to pursue her agenda as Secretary.

As secretary, Herman supported the 1996 and 1997 raises to the minimum wage, increasing it by $0.90 to $5.15 per hour by September 1997. Herman argued the wage hike increased the buying power of workers. She later opposed a 1999 Republican supported plan to raise the minimum wage over three years, instead supporting a two-year time-table for an increase. Herman also opposed the legislation as it included tax cuts without offsets.

Among Herman&#x27;s responsibilities as secretary was the enforcement of child labor laws. During her tenure, the Department of Labor fined toy store chain Toys &quot;R&quot; Us $200,000 for violating laws restricting the type of work that may be done, and the number of hours that may be worked by underage employees. It found more than 300 teenage employees were working more and later hours than permitted, and Toys &quot;R&quot; Us agreed to stop the practices.

Herman supported the United States&#x27; participation in the International Labor Organization&#x27;s Child Labor Convention, a treaty designed to protect children under 18 years old from slavery, trafficking, bondage, and other abuses. She also defended the United States&#x27; support of a provision to allow for voluntary military service of those under 18 years old, a practice allowed in the United States, Great Britain, Germany, and the Netherlands. Opponents, including other nations, trade unions, and Amnesty International urged tougher provisions; however, Herman contended the focus of the treaty should be on forced labor, not voluntary military service.

Attorney General Janet Reno appointed Independent Council Ralph I. Lancaster Jr., in May 1998, to investigate Herman after businessman Laurent J. Yene alleged she accepted kickbacks while working at the White House. Reno was skeptical of Yene&#x27;s allegations following a preliminary FBI investigation, but she believed the Independent Council law obligated her to appoint independent council where she could not affirm the claims were without merit. Following a twenty-three month investigation, Independent Council Lancaster concluded that Herman had broken no laws and cleared her of all wrongdoing. She was the fifth Clinton cabinet officer to be investigated by independent counsel, and the fourth cleared of all wrongdoing. The Independent Council investigations of the cabinet members cost $95 million and did not uncover any felonies, leading Congress to allow the Independent Counsel Act to expire in June 1999 without re-authorization.

Herman was active in Al Gore&#x27;s 2000 campaign for president. During the Florida election recount, Herman was part of the team planning a transition to a Gore Administration. &quot;ABC News&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot; considered her a likely candidate to remain in Gore&#x27;s White House if he won. Elaine Chao replaced her as Secretary of Labor in the George W. Bush administration.

===Post-government===

Herman served as co-chair of Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry&#x27;s transition team during the 2004 presidential election. In 2005, Howard Dean, serving as Democratic National Committee Chairman, appointed Herman and lawyer James Roosevelt, Jr. co-chairs of its Rules and Bylaws Committee. The position put Herman and Roosevelt at the center of a dispute between the campaigns of democratic primary candidates Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton over whether to seat delegates from Michigan and Florida at the 2008 Democratic National Convention. Herman endorsed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic Party Presidential primaries and served as Deputy Parliamentarian at the 2016 Democratic National Convention.

From 2001 to 2006, Herman was chairwoman of The Coca-Cola Company&#x27;s Human Resources Task Force. The following year, Coca-Cola made her a director. Herman served on Toyota&#x27;s Diversity Advisory Board. In 2006, the company appointed her to head a special task force to ensure the company&#x27;s compliance with anti-discrimination standards following the resignation of Toyota North America&#x27;s CEO, after being named the defendant in a sexual harassment lawsuit. Herman served on the boards of other major companies, including Cummins, MGM Resorts International, Entergy, Sodexo, and is the chairman and CEO of New Ventures, Inc.

In 2010, Herman was appointed to the board of the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund, a charitable organization founded by Bill Clinton and George W. Bush to aid Haiti following a magnitude 7.0 Mw earthquake in January of that year. Herman has also been involved with civic groups including the National Urban League and the National Epilepsy Foundation. She has been awarded more than 20 honorary doctorate degrees from academic institutions.

== Personal life ==
Herman was Queen of Carnival for the Mobile Area Mardi Gras Association in 1974. Her father had served as King of Carnival in his youth.

Herman married physician Charles Franklin Jr. in February 2000 at the Washington National Cathedral. Franklin had three children from previous marriages. He died in 2014 following an extended illness.

<doc id="152800" wikidata="Q3356759" url="?curid=152800" title="Economic rationalism">
<text>Economic rationalism is an Australian term often used in the discussion of macroeconomic policy, applicable to the economic policy of many governments around the world, in particular during the 1980s and 1990s. Economic rationalists tend to favour economically liberal policies: deregulation, a free market economy, privatisation of state-owned industries, lower direct taxation and higher indirect taxation, and a reduction of the size of the welfare state. Near-equivalents include Rogernomics (NZ), Thatcherism (UK) and Reaganomics (US). However, the term was also used to describe advocates of market-oriented reform within the Australian Labor Party, whose position was closer to what has become known as the &quot;Third Way&quot;.

Given that it is a phrase used by the sociologist Max Weber in &quot;The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism&quot;, it is highly likely that the term was drawn from there and that its modern denotations can all be accommodated within Weber&#x27;s usage. Its recent usage arose independently in Australia, and was derived from the phrase &quot;economically rational&quot;, used as a favourable description of market-oriented economic policies. Its first appearances in print were in the early 1970s under the Whitlam government, and it was almost invariably used in a favourable sense until the late 1980s.

The now dominant negative use came into widespread use during the 1990 recession; it was popularised by Michael Pusey&#x27;s best-selling book &quot;Economic Rationalism in Canberra&quot;.

== Criticism ==
The term &quot;economic rationalism&quot; is commonly used in criticism of free-market economic policies as amoral or asocial. In this context, it may be summarised as &quot;the view that commercial activity... represents a sphere of activity in which moral considerations, beyond the rule of business probity dictated by enlightened self-interest, have no role to play&quot; (Quiggin 1997).

The well-known statement of Margaret Thatcher, &quot;There is no such thing as society. There are individuals, and there are families,&quot; is often quoted in that context, but the interpretation of that statement is disputed.

==Support==
Supporters of economic rationalism have presented two kinds of responses to criticisms such as those quoted above. Some have denied that such criticisms are accurate and claim that the term refers only to rational policy formulation based on sound economic analysis, and it does not preclude government intervention aimed at income redistribution, correcting market failure, etc.

Others have accepted the accuracy of the description but have argued that the adoption of radical free-market policies is both inevitable and desirable. Another statement by Thatcher, &quot;there is no alternative&quot;, is frequently cited in that context.

Mineta served as the United States Secretary of Commerce during the final months of Bill Clinton&#x27;s presidency. He was the first person of East Asian descent to serve as a US Cabinet secretary and the first Asian American mayor of a major US city.

As the United States Secretary of Transportation for President Bush, Mineta was the only Democratic cabinet secretary in the Bush administration. He oversaw the creation of the Transportation Security Administration in response to the September 11 attacks that had occurred early in his tenure. On June 23, 2006, Mineta announced his resignation after more than five years as Secretary of Transportation, effective July 7, 2006, making him the longest-serving Secretary of Transportation in the department&#x27;s history. A month later, the public relations firm Hill &amp; Knowlton announced that Mineta would join it as a partner. In 2010, it was announced that Mineta would join L&amp;L Energy as vice chairman.

Mineta died on May 3, 2022, from a heart ailment in Edgewater, Maryland, at the age of 90.

==Early life and education==
Mineta was born in San Jose, California, to Japanese immigrant parents Kunisaku Mineta and Kane Watanabe, who were barred from becoming American citizens at that time by the Immigration Act of 1924. During World War II, the Mineta family was interned for several years at Area 24, 7th Barrack, Unit B, in the Heart Mountain internment camp near Cody, Wyoming, along with thousands of other Japanese immigrants and Japanese Americans. Upon arrival to the camp, Mineta, a baseball fan, had his baseball bat confiscated by authorities because it could be used as a weapon. Many years later, after Mineta was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, a man sent Mineta a $1,500 bat that was once owned by Hank Aaron, which Mineta was forced to return as it violated the congressional ban on gifts valued over $250. Mineta said: &quot;The damn government&#x27;s taken my bat again.&quot;

While detained in the camp, Mineta, a Boy Scout, met fellow scout Alan Simpson, a future U.S. senator from Wyoming, who often visited the Boy Scouts in the internment camp with his troop. The two became close friends and remained political allies throughout their lives.

Mineta graduated from the University of California, Berkeley&#x27;s School of Business Administration in 1953 with a degree in business administration. Upon graduation, Mineta joined the United States Army and served as a military intelligence officer in Japan and Korea. He then joined his father in the Mineta Insurance Agency.

==Career==

===Councilman and mayor of San Jose===
In 1967, Mineta was appointed to a vacant San Jose City Council seat by mayor Ron James. He was elected to office for the first time after completing a term in the city council. He was elected vice mayor by fellow councilors during that term.

Mineta ran against 14 other candidates in the 1971 election to replace outgoing mayor Ron James. Mineta won every precinct in the election with over 60% of the total vote and became the 59th mayor of San Jose, the first Japanese-American mayor of a major American city. As mayor, Mineta ended the city&#x27;s 20-year-old policy of rapid growth by annexation, creating development-free areas in East and South San Jose. His vice mayor Janet Gray Hayes succeeded him as mayor in 1975.

===United States Congress===
In 1974, Mineta ran for the United States House of Representatives in what was then . The district was previously the 10th District, represented by retiring 11-term Republican Charles Gubser. Mineta won the Democratic nomination and defeated State Assemblyman George W. Milias with 52 percent of the vote. He was reelected ten more times from this Silicon Valley–based district, which was renumbered as the 15th District in 1993, never dropping below 57 percent of the vote.

Mineta co-founded the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus and served as its first chair. He served as chairman of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure between 1992 and 1994. He chaired the committee&#x27;s aviation subcommittee between 1981 and 1988, and chaired its Surface Transportation subcommittee from 1989 to 1991.

During his career in Congress, Mineta was a key author of the landmark Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991. He pressed for more funding for the Federal Aviation Administration. Mineta was a driving force in the House of Representatives behind the passage of H.R. 442, while Senator Spark Matsunaga (Hawaii) &quot;almost single-handedly&quot; got the legislation passed in the Senate of the 100th Congress which became the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, a law that officially apologized for and redressed the injustices endured by Japanese Americans during World War II.

===Private sector===
Mineta resigned his seat mid-term to accept a position with Lockheed Martin in 1995. He chaired the National Civil Aviation Review Commission, which in 1997 issued recommendations on minimizing traffic congestion and reducing the aviation accident rate. The Clinton administration adopted many of the commission&#x27;s recommendations, including reform of the Federal Aviation Administration to enable it to perform more like a business.

In 1999, Mineta received the L. Welch Pogue Award for Lifetime Achievement in Aviation.

Mineta was appointed to the board of directors of Horizon Lines effective January 1, 2007. He had formerly served on the board of AECOM Technology Corporation and was on the board of SJW Corp.

===Secretary of Commerce===
In 2000, President Bill Clinton nominated Mineta to serve as the US Secretary of Commerce, making him the first Asian American to hold a presidential cabinet post. Clinton had wanted to nominate Mineta as US Secretary of Transportation in 1992, but Mineta wanted to remain in Congress at that time.

===Secretary of Transportation===
Mineta was appointed United States Secretary of Transportation by President George W. Bush in 2001, a post that he was offered eight years earlier by Bill Clinton. He was the only Democrat to have served in Bush&#x27;s cabinet and the first Secretary of Transportation to have previously served in a cabinet position. He became the first Asian American to hold the position, and only the fourth person to be a member of the cabinet under two presidents from different political parties (after Edwin Stanton, Henry L. Stimson and James R. Schlesinger). In 2004, Mineta received the Tony Jannus Award for his distinguished contributions to commercial air transportation.

Following Bush&#x27;s reelection, Mineta was invited to continue in the position, and he did so until resigning in June 2006. When he stepped down on July 7, 2006, he was the longest-serving Secretary of Transportation since the position&#x27;s inception in 1967.

====September 11 attacks====
Mineta&#x27;s testimony to the 9/11 Commission about his experience in the Presidential Emergency Operations Center with Vice President Cheney as American Airlines Flight 77 approached the Pentagon was not included in the 9/11 Commission Report. In one colloquy testified by Mineta, the vice president refers to orders concerning the plane approaching the Pentagon:

Commissioner Lee Hamilton queried if the order was to shoot down the plane, to which Mineta replied that he did not know that specifically.

Mineta&#x27;s testimony to the commission on Flight 77 differs somewhat significantly from the account provided in the January 22, 2002, edition of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, as reported by Bob Woodward and Dan Balz in their series &quot;10 Days in September&quot;.

This same article reports that the conversation between Cheney and the aide occurred at 9:55 a.m., about 30 minutes later than the time that Mineta had cited (9:26 a.m.) during his testimony to the 9/11 Commission.

After hearing of Mineta&#x27;s orders, Canadian transport minister David Collenette issued orders to ground all civilian aircraft traffic across Canada, resulting in Operation Yellow Ribbon. On September 21, 2001, Mineta sent a letter to all US airlines forbidding them from practicing racial profiling or subjecting Middle Eastern or Muslim passengers to a heightened degree of pre-flight scrutiny. He stated that it was illegal for the airlines to discriminate against passengers based on race, color, national or ethnic origin, or religion. Subsequently, administrative enforcement actions were brought against three airlines based on alleged infringements of these rules, resulting in multimillion-dollar settlements. Mineta voiced his intention to &quot;absolutely not&quot; implement racial screenings in a &quot;60 Minutes&quot; interview just after 9/11. He later recalled his decision &quot;was the right thing [and] constitutional&quot; based on his own experience as a member of those who had &quot;lost the most basic human rights&quot; as a result of the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II.

The San Jose International Airport in San Jose was named after Mineta in November 2001 while he was serving as Secretary of Transportation. The Mineta Transportation Institute, located at San Jose State University, and portions of California State Highway 85 are named after him.

White House Press Secretary Tony Snow announced on June 23, 2006, that Mineta would resign effective July 7, 2006, because &quot;he wanted to.&quot; A spokesman said Mineta was &quot;moving on to pursue other challenges.&quot; He left office as the longest-serving Secretary of Transportation in history.

===After leaving the Bush Administration===
Hill &amp; Knowlton announced on July 10, 2006, that Mineta would join the firm as vice chairman, effective July 24, 2006.

In 2005, Mineta received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement presented by Awards Council member and Google co-founder Larry Page. In October 2006, Mineta won the Wright Brothers Memorial Trophy. In December 2006, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. In 2007, the Japanese government conferred upon him the Grand Cordon, Order of the Rising Sun.

On February 4, 2008, the day before the closely contested California Democratic primary, Mineta endorsed Barack Obama.

Beginning in the summer of 2008, Mineta began service as chairman of a panel of the National Academy of Public Administration overseeing a study of modernization efforts at the United States Coast Guard. Other notable members of the panel include former Office of Personnel Management director Janice Lachance and former NASA administrator Sean O&#x27;Keefe.

In June 2010, Mineta was named co-chair of the Joint Ocean Commission Initiative. On August 10, 2010, he was named vice chair of L&amp;L Energy, Inc., which was headquartered in Seattle and operated coal mines and other facilities related to coal production in China.

Mineta was a recipient of the Chubb Fellowship at Yale University from 2015 to 2016.

==Legacy==
The Mineta Transportation Institute was named after him. It was established by Congress in 1991 as a research institute focusing on issues related to intermodal surface transport in the United States. It is part of San Jose State University&#x27;s Lucas Graduate School of Business in San Jose, California, and is currently directed by Karen Philbrick.

In 2001, the San Jose International Airport adopted his name to honor him while he was serving as the United States Secretary of Transportation. In 2024, a statue was erected there in his honor.

On September 15, 2008, California State Route 85, a freeway connecting the South San Jose area with Mountain View, was also designated the Norman Y. Mineta Highway in remembrance of Mineta.

In 2022, Congress renamed the Department of Transportation headquarters building as the William T. Coleman, Jr. and Norman Y. Mineta Federal Building, in honor of Mineta and another former Secretary, William Thaddeus Coleman Jr.

==Personal life==
Mineta&#x27;s first marriage was to May Hinoki, which lasted from 1961 to 1986. In 1991, Mineta married United Airlines flight attendant Danealia &quot;Deni&quot; Brantner. Mineta had two children from his first marriage and two stepchildren from his second marriage. He had 11 grandchildren.

Mineta died on May 3, 2022, from a heart ailment in Edgewater, Maryland, at the age of 90.

<text>Gansu is a province in Northwestern China. Its capital and largest city is Lanzhou, in the southeastern part of the province. The seventh-largest administrative district by area at , Gansu lies between the Tibetan and Loess plateaus and borders Mongolia&#x27;s Govi-Altai Province, Inner Mongolia and Ningxia to the north, Xinjiang and Qinghai to the west, Sichuan to the south and Shaanxi to the east. The Yellow River passes through the southern part of the province. Part of Gansu&#x27;s territory is located in the Gobi Desert. The Qilian mountains are located in the south of the Province.

Gansu has a population of 26 million, ranking 22nd in China. Its population is mostly Han, along with Hui, Dongxiang and Tibetan minorities. The most common language is Mandarin. Gansu is among the poorest administrative divisions in China, ranking last in GDP per capita as of 2019.

The state of Qin originated in what is now southeastern Gansu, and later established the first imperial dynasty in Chinese history. The Northern Silk Road ran through the Hexi Corridor, which passes through Gansu, resulting in it being an important strategic outpost and communications link for the Chinese empire.

The city of Jiayuguan, the second most populated city in Gansu, is known for its section of the Great Wall and the Jiayu Pass fortress complex.

==Name==
Gansu is a compound of the names of Ganzhou (now the main urban district and seat of Zhangye) and Suzhou (an old name and the modern seat of Jiuquan), formerly the two most important Chinese settlements in the Hexi Corridor.

Gansu is abbreviated as () or (), and was also known as Longxi () or Longyou () prior to early Western Han dynasty, in reference to Mount Liupan between eastern Gansu and western Shaanxi.

Until 1987, Gansu was rendered in the postal romanization and Wade-Giles as Kansu, which was gradually replaced by pinyin starting in 1958. The spelling of the province is also spelled in Mandarin Phonetic Symbols II (1986) and Tongyong Pinyin (2002) adopted by Taiwan, who would later adopt Hanyu Pinyin in 2009.

== History ==
Gansu&#x27;s name is a compound name first used during the Song dynasty. It is a combination of the names of two prefectures () in the Sui and Tang dynasty: Gan (around Zhangye) and Su (around Jiuquan). Its eastern part forms part of one of the cradles of ancient Chinese civilisation.

=== Ancient Gansu ===
In prehistoric times, Gansu was host to Neolithic cultures. The Dadiwan culture, from where archaeologically significant artifacts have been excavated, flourished in the eastern end of Gansu from about 6000BC to about 3000BC. The Majiayao culture and part of the Qijia culture took root in Gansu from 3100 BC to 2700 BC and 2400 BC to 1900 BC respectively.

The Yuezhi originally lived in the very western part of Gansu until they were forced to emigrate by the Xiongnu around 177 BC.

The State of Qin, known in China as the founding state of the Chinese empire, grew out from the southeastern part of Gansu, specifically the Tianshui area. The Qin name is believed to have originated, in part, from the area. Qin tombs and artifacts have been excavated from Fangmatan near Tianshui, including one 2200-year-old map of Guixian County.

===Imperial era===
In imperial times, Gansu was an important strategic outpost and communications link for the Chinese empire, as the Hexi Corridor runs along the &quot;neck&quot; of the province. The Han dynasty extended the Great Wall across this corridor, building the strategic Yumenguan (Jade Gate Pass, near Dunhuang) and Yangguan fort towns along it. Remains of the wall and the towns can be found there. The Ming dynasty built the Jiayuguan outpost in Gansu. To the west of Yumenguan and the Qilian Mountains, at the northwestern end of the province, the Yuezhi, Wusun, and other nomadic tribes dwelt (Shiji 123), occasionally figuring in regional imperial Chinese geopolitics.

By the Qingshui treaty, concluded in 823 between the Tibetan Empire and the Tang dynasty, China lost much of western Gansu province for a significant period.

After the fall of the Uyghur Khaganate, a Buddhist Yugur (Uyghur) state called the Ganzhou Uyghur Kingdom was established by migrating Uyghurs from the khaganate in part of Gansu that lasted from 848 to 1036AD.

Along the Silk Road, Gansu was an economically important province, as well as a cultural transmission path. Temples and Buddhist grottoes such as those at Mogao Caves (&#x27;Caves of the Thousand Buddhas&#x27;) and Maijishan Caves contain artistically and historically revealing murals. An early form of paper inscribed with Chinese characters and dating to about 8BC was discovered at the site of a Western Han garrison near the Yumen pass in August 2006.

The Xixia or Western Xia dynasty controlled much of Gansu as well as Ningxia.

The province was also the origin of the Dungan Revolt of 1862–77. Among the Qing forces were Muslim generals, including Ma Zhan&#x27;ao and Ma Anliang, who helped the Qing crush the rebel Muslims. The revolt had spread into Gansu from neighbouring Qinghai.

There was another Dungan revolt from 1895 to 1896.

===Republican China===
As a result of frequent earthquakes, droughts and famines, the economic progress of Gansu was significantly slower than that of other provinces of China until recently. Based on the area&#x27;s abundant mineral resources it has begun developing into a vital industrial center. An earthquake in Gansu at 8.6 on the Richter scale killed around 180,000 people mostly in the present-day area of Ningxia in 1920, and another with a magnitude of 7.6 killed 275 in 1932.

The Muslim Conflict in Gansu (1927–1930) was a conflict against the Guominjun.

While the Muslim General Ma Hongbin was acting chairman of the province, Muslim General Ma Buqing was in virtual control of Gansu in 1940. Liangzhou District in Wuwei was previously his headquarters in Gansu, where he controlled 15 million Muslims. Xinjiang came under Kuomintang (Nationalist) control after their soldiers entered via Gansu. Gansu&#x27;s Tienshui was the site of a Japanese-Chinese warplane fight.

Gansu was vulnerable to Soviet penetration via Xinjiang. Gansu was a passageway for Soviet war supplies for the Republic of China during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Lanzhou was a destination point via a road coming from Dihua (Ürümqi). The Gonxingdun Aerodrome was one of several air bases where the Chinese Air Force operated in defense of Gansu. Gansu provided wartime China with most of the locally sourced petrol from the Yumen Laojunmiao oil wells beginning in the summer of 1939, producing 250,000 tons of crude oil in those war years. Lanzhou and Lhasa were designated to be recipients of a new railway.

The Kuomintang Islamic insurgency in China (1950–1958) was a prolongation of the Chinese Civil War in several provinces including Gansu.

== Geography ==
Gansu has an area of , and the vast majority of its land is more than above sea level. It lies between the Tibetan Plateau and the Loess Plateau, bordering Mongolia (Govi-Altai Province) to the northwest, Inner Mongolia and Ningxia to the north, Shaanxi to the east, Sichuan to the south, and Xinjiang to the west. The Yellow River passes through the southern part of the province. The province contains the geographical centre of China, marked by the Center of the Country Monument at .

Part of the Gobi Desert is located in Gansu, as well as small parts of the Badain Jaran Desert and the Tengger Desert.

The Yellow River gets most of its water from Gansu, flowing straight through Lanzhou. The area around Wuwei is part of Shiyang River Basin.

The landscape in Gansu is very mountainous in the south and flat in the north. The mountains in the south are part of the Qilian Mountains, while the far western Altyn-Tagh contains the province&#x27;s highest point, at .

A natural land passage known as Hexi Corridor, stretching some from Lanzhou to the Jade Gate, is situated within the province. It is bound from north by the Gobi Desert and Qilian Mountains from the south.

Gansu generally has a semi-arid to arid continental climate (Köppen &quot;BSk&quot; or &quot;BWk&quot;) with warm to hot summers and cold to very cold winters, although diurnal temperature ranges are often so large that maxima remain above even in winter. However, due to extreme altitude, some areas of Gansu exhibit a subarctic climate (&quot;Dwc&quot;) – with winter temperatures sometimes dropping to . Most of the limited precipitation is delivered in the summer months: winters are so dry that snow cover is confined to very high altitudes and the snow line can be as high as in the southwest.
== Administrative divisions ==

Gansu is divided into fourteen prefecture-level divisions: twelve prefecture-level cities and two autonomous prefectures:

The fourteen Prefecture of Gansu are subdivided into 86 county-level divisions (17 districts, 5 county-level cities, 57 counties, and 7 autonomous counties).

== Economy ==
Despite recent growth in Gansu and the booming economy in the rest of China, Gansu is still considered to be one of the poorest provinces in China. For several years, it has ranked as one of the provinces with lowest GDP per capita. Its nominal GDP for 2017 was about 767.7 billion yuan (US$113.70 billion) and per capita of 29,326 RMB (US$4,343). The province also has a large difference in wealth between regions and urban versus rural areas. The poorest areas are Dingxi, Longnan, Gannan and Linxia. According to analysts, the local economy failed to gather momentum while other provinces did manage to increase their economic growth.

=== Agriculture ===

Due to poor natural conditions such as aridness, Gansu is one of the Chinese provinces with smallest per capita area of arable land. Agricultural production includes cotton, linseed oil, maize, melons (such as the honeydew melon, known locally as the Bailan melon), millet, and wheat. Gansu is known as a source for wild medicinal herbs which are used in Chinese medicine. However, pollution by heavy metals, such as cadmium in irrigation water, has resulted in the poisoning of many acres of agricultural land. The extent and nature of the heavy metal pollution is considered a state secret.

=== Industry ===
The industrial sector in Gansu was developed after completion of the Longhai railway in 1953 and blueprinted in the first five-year plan of China. It was a major recipient of China&#x27;s investment in industrial capacity during the Third Front campaign.

Until 2014, the industrial sector contributed the most to Gansu&#x27;s economy. The most important industries are petrochemicals, non-ferrous metallurgy, machinery and electronics. The province is also an important base for wind and solar power. As a result of environmental protection policies, the industry sector is not growing. The manufacturing sector has been shrinking for several years and has low investment numbers.

According to some sources, the province is also a center of China&#x27;s nuclear industry.

As stipulated in the country&#x27;s 12th Five Year Plan, the local government of Gansu hopes to grow the province&#x27;s GDP by 10% annually by focusing investments on five pillar industries: renewable energy, coal, chemicals, nonferrous metals, pharmaceuticals and services.

==== Mining ====

A large part of Gansu&#x27;s economy is based on mining and the extraction of minerals, especially rare earth elements. The province has significant deposits of antimony, chromium, coal, cobalt, copper, fluorite, gypsum, iridium, iron, lead, limestone, mercury, mirabilite, nickel, crude oil, platinum, troilite, tungsten, and zinc among others. The oil fields at Yumen and Changqing are considered significant.

Gansu has China&#x27;s largest nickel deposits accounting for over 90% of China&#x27;s total nickel reserves.

=== Services ===

Since 2014, the service sector is the largest economic sector of Gansu. Tourism is a sector that is becoming of increased importance.

===Economic and technological development zones===
The following economic and technological zones are situated in Gansu:
*Lanzhou National Economic and Technological Development Zone was established in 1993, located in the center of Lanzhou Anning District. The zone has a planned area of . 17 colleges, 11 scientific research institutions, 21 large and medium-size companies and other 1735 enterprises have been set up in the zone. Main industries include textile mills, rubber, fertilizer plants, oil refinery, petrochemical, machinery, and metallurgical industry.
*Lanzhou New &amp; Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone, Lanzhou Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone, one of the first 27 national hi-tech industrial development zones, was established in 1998 covering more than . It is expected to expand another . The zone mainly focuses on Biotechnology, chemical industry, building decoration materials and information technology.

== Demographics ==

Gansu province is home to a little more than 25 million people. As of 2020, 47.7% of the population was rural, but much relocation in recent years has reduced this. Gansu is 89.4% Han and also has Hui, Tibetan, Dongxiang, Tu, Uyghurs, Yugur, Bonan, Mongolian, Salar and Kazakh minorities. Gansu province&#x27;s community of Chinese Hui Muslims was bolstered by Hui Muslims resettled from Shaanxi province during the Dungan Revolt. Gansu is also a historical home, along with Shaanxi, of the dialect of the Dungans, who migrated to Central Asia. The southwestern corner of Gansu is home to a large ethnic Tibetan population. Modern Gansu is dominated by Lanzhou city and Linxia Hui prefectures, their growth hides the stark fact that much of the rest of the province is rapidly losing population.

== Languages ==
Most of the inhabitants of Gansu speak dialects of Northern Mandarin Chinese. On the border areas of Gansu one might encounter Tu, Tibetan, Mongolian, Uyghur and the Kazakh language. Most of the minorities also speak Chinese.

== Culture ==

A unique variety of Chinese folk music popularly identified with the local peoples of Gansu include the &quot;&quot;Hua&#x27;er&quot; (flowery melodies)&quot;, and is popular among the Han and nine ethnic groups of Gansu. The cuisine of Gansu is based on the staple crops grown there: wheat, barley, millet, beans, and sweet potatoes. Within China, Gansu is known for its lamian (pulled noodles), and Muslim restaurants which feature authentic Gansu cuisine.

===Religion===

According to a 2012 survey around 12% of the population of Gansu belongs to organised religions, the largest groups being Buddhists with 8.2%, followed by Muslims with 3.4%, Protestants with 0.4% and Catholics with 0.1%. Around 88% of the population may be either irreligious or involved in Chinese folk religion, Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, and folk religious sects.

Muslim restaurants are common, and feature typical Chinese dishes, but without any pork products, and instead an emphasis on lamb and mutton. Gansu has many works of Buddhist art, including the Maijishan Grottoes. Dunhuang was a major centre of Buddhism in the Middle Ages.
== Tourism ==

===Jiayuguan Pass of the Great Wall===

Jiayuguan Pass, in Jiayuguan city, is the largest and most intact pass, or entrance, of the Great Wall. Jiayuguan Pass was built in the early Ming dynasty, somewhere around the year 1372. It was built near an oasis that was then on the extreme western edge of China. Jiayuguan Pass was the first pass on the west end of the great wall so it earned the name &quot;The First And Greatest Pass Under Heaven&quot;.

An extra brick is said to rest on a ledge over one of the gates. One legend holds that the official in charge asked the designer to calculate how many bricks would be used. The designer gave him the number and when the project was finished, only one brick was left. It was put on the top of the pass as a symbol of commemoration. Another account holds that the building project was assigned to a military manager and an architect. The architect presented the manager with a requisition for the total number of bricks that he would need. When the manager found out that the architect had not asked for any extra bricks, he demanded that the architect make some provision for unforeseen circumstances. The architect, taking this as an insult to his planning ability, added a single extra brick to the request. When the gate was finished, the single extra brick was, in fact, extra and was left on the ledge over the gate.

===Mogao Grottoes===

The Mogao Grottoes near Dunhuang have a collection of Buddhist art. Originally there were a thousand grottoes, but now only 492 cave temples remain. Each temple has a large statue of a buddha or bodhisattva and paintings of religious scenes. In 366 AD under the Former Liang dynasty, a monk named Le Zun (Lo-tsun) came near Echoing Sand Mountain, when he had a vision. He started to carve the first grotto. During the Five Dynasties period they ran out of room on the cliff and could not build any more grottoes.

===Silk Road and Dunhuang City===

The historic Silk Road starts in Chang&#x27;an (present-day Xi&#x27;an) and goes to Constantinople (Istanbul). On the way merchants would go to Dunhuang in Gansu. In Dunhuang they would get fresh camels, food and guards for the journey around the dangerous Taklamakan Desert. Before departing Dunhuang they would pray to the Mogao Grottoes for a safe journey, if they came back alive they would thank the gods at the grottoes. Across the desert they would form a train of camels to protect themselves from thieving bandits. The next stop, Kashi (Kashgar), was a welcome sight to the merchants. At Kashi most would trade and go back and the ones who stayed would eat fruit and trade their Bactrian camels for single humped ones. After Kashi they would keep going until they reached their next destination.

Located about southwest of the city, the Crescent Lake or Yueyaquan is an oasis and popular spot for tourists seeking respite from the heat of the desert. Activities includes camel and 4x4 rides.

===Silk Route Museum===

The Silk Route Museum is located in Jiuquan along the Silk Road, a trading route connecting Rome to China, used by Marco Polo. It is also built over the tomb of the Western Liang King.

===Bingling Temple===

Bingling Temple, or Bingling Grottoes, is a Buddhist cave complex in a canyon along the Yellow River. Begun in 420 AD during the Western Qin dynasty, the site contains dozens of caves and caverns filled with outstanding examples of carvings, sculpture, and frescoes. The great Maitreya Buddha is more than 27 meters tall and is similar in style to the great Buddhas that once lined the cliffs of Bamiyan, Afghanistan. Access to the site is by boat from Yongjing in the summer or fall. There is no other access point.

===Labrang Monastery===

Labrang Tashikyil Monastery is located in Xiahe County, Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, located in the southern part of Gansu, and part of the traditional Tibetan province of Amdo. It is one of the six major monasteries of the Gelukpa tradition of Tibetan Buddhism in Tibet, and the most important one in Amdo. Built in 1710, it is headed by the Jamyang-zhaypa. It has 6 &quot;dratsang&quot; (colleges), and houses over sixty thousand religious texts and other works of literature as well as other cultural artifacts.

=== Maijishan Grottoes ===
The Maijishan Grottoes are a series of 194 caves cut in the side of the hill of Majishan in Tianshui. This example of rock cut architecture contains over 7,200 Buddhist sculptures and over 1,000 square meters of murals. Construction began in the Later Qin era (384–417 CE).

===Minerals===
Three thousand deposits of 145 different minerals. Ninety-four minerals have been found and ascertained, including nickel, cobalt, platinum, selenium, casting clay, finishing serpentine, whose reserves are the largest in China. Gansu has advantages in getting nickel, zinc, cobalt, platinum, iridium, copper, barite, and baudisserite.

===Energy===
Among Gansu&#x27;s most important sources of energy are its water resources: the Yellow River and other inland river drainage basins. Gansu is placed ninth among China&#x27;s provinces in annual hydropower potential and water discharge. Gansu produces 17.24 gigawatts of hydropower a year. Twenty-nine hydropower stations have been constructed in Gansu, capable of generating 30 gigawatts in total. Gansu has an estimated coal reserve of 8.92 billion tons and petroleum reserve of 700 million tons.

There is also good potential for wind and solar power development. The Gansu Wind Farm project – already producing 7.965GW in 2015 – is expected to achieve 20GW by 2020, at which time it will likely become the world&#x27;s biggest collective windfarm.

In November 2017 an agreement between the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Gansu government was announced, to site and begin operations of a molten salt reactor pilot project in the province by 2020.

===Flora and fauna===
Gansu has 659 species of wild animals. It has twenty-four rare animals which are under a state protection.

Gansu&#x27;s mammals include some of the world&#x27;s most charismatic: the giant panda, golden monkeys, lynx, snow leopards, sika deer, musk deer, and the Bactrian camel.

Among zoologists who study moles, the Gansu mole is of great interest. For a reason that can only be speculated, it is taxologically a New World mole living among Old World moles: that is to say, an American mole living in a sea of Euro-Asians.

Gansu is home to 441 species of birds; it is a center of endemism and home to many species and subspecies which occur nowhere else in the world.

Gansu is China&#x27;s second-largest producer of medicinal plants and herbs, including some produced nowhere else, such as the hairy asiabell root, fritillary bulb, and Chinese caterpillar fungus.

==Environment==
=== Natural disasters ===
On 16 December 1920, Gansu witnessed the deadliest landslide ever recorded. A series of landslides, triggered by a single earthquake, accounted for most of the 180,000 people killed in the event.

=== Anti-desertification project ===
The Asian Development Bank is working with the State Forestry Administration of China on the Silk Road Ecosystem Restoration Project, designed to prevent degradation and desertification in Gansu. It is estimated to cost up to US$150 million.

== Space launch center ==
The Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center, located in the Gobi desert, is named after the city of Jiuquan, Gansu, the nearest city, although the center itself is in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.

<text>Dorothea Lange (born Dorothea Margaretta Nutzhorn; May 26, 1895 – October 11, 1965) was an American documentary photographer and photojournalist, best known for her Depression-era work for the Farm Security Administration (FSA). Lange&#x27;s photographs influenced the development of documentary photography and humanized the consequences of the Great Depression.

== Early life ==

Lange was born in Hoboken, New Jersey to second-generation German immigrants Johanna Lange and Heinrich Nutzhorn. She had a younger brother named Martin. Two early events shaped Lange&#x27;s path as a photographer. 
First, at age seven she contracted polio, which left her with a weakened right leg and a permanent limp. &quot;It formed me, guided me, instructed me, helped me, and humiliated me,&quot; Lange once said of her altered gait. &quot;I&#x27;ve never gotten over it, and I am aware of the force and power of it.&quot; Second, five years later, her father abandoned the family, prompting a move from suburban New Jersey to a poorer neighborhood in New York City. Later she dropped her father&#x27;s family name and took her mother&#x27;s maiden name.

Growing up on Manhattan&#x27;s Lower East Side, she attended PS 62 on Hester Street, where she was &quot;one of the only gentiles—quite possibly the only—in a class of 3,000 Jews.&quot; &quot;Left on her own while her mother worked, Lange wandered the streets of New York, fascinated by the variety of people she saw. She learned to observe without intruding, a skill she would later use as a documentary photographer.&quot;

== Career ==

Lange graduated from the Wadleigh High School for Girls, New York City; by this time, even though she had never owned or operated a camera, she had already decided that she would become a photographer. Lange began her study of photography at Columbia University under the tutelage of Clarence H. White, and later gained informal apprenticeships with several New York photography studios, including that of Arnold Genthe.

In 1918, Lange left New York with a female friend intending to travel the world, but her plans were disrupted upon being robbed. She settled in San Francisco where she found work as a &#x27;finisher&#x27; in a photographic supply shop. There, Lange became acquainted with other photographers and met an investor who backed her in establishing a successful portrait studio. In 1920, she married the noted western painter Maynard Dixon, with whom she had two sons, Daniel, born in 1925, and John, born in 1930.&lt;ref name=&quot;Susan Oliver/Cerritos College&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Lange&#x27;s studio business supported her family for the next fifteen years. Lange&#x27;s early studio work mostly involved shooting portrait photographs of the social elite in San Francisco. But at the onset of the Great Depression, she turned her lens from the studio to the street.

In the depths of the worldwide depression, in 1933, some fourteen million people in the U.S. were out of work; many were homeless, drifting aimlessly, often without enough food to eat. In the midwest and southwest, drought and dust storms added to the economic havoc. During the decade of the 1930s, some 300,000 men, women, and children migrated west to California, hoping to find work. Broadly, these migrant families were called by the opprobrium &quot;Okies&quot; (as from Oklahoma) regardless of where they came from. They traveled in old, dilapidated cars or trucks, wandering from place to place to follow the crops. Lange began to photograph these luckless folk, leaving her studio to document their lives in the streets and roads of California. She roamed the byways with her camera, portraying the extent of the social and economic upheaval of the Depression. It is here that Lange found her purpose and direction as a photographer. She was no longer a portraitist; but neither was she a photojournalist. Instead, Lange became known as one of the first of a new kind, a &quot;documentary&quot; photographer.

Lange&#x27;s photographic studies of the unemployed and homeless—starting with &quot;White Angel Breadline (1933)&quot;, which depicted a lone man facing away from the crowd in front of a soup kitchen run by a widow known as the White Angel—captured the attention of local photographers and media, and eventually led to her employment with the federal Resettlement Administration (RA), later called the Farm Security Administration (FSA).

Lange developed personal techniques of talking with her subjects while working, putting them at ease and enabling her to document pertinent remarks to accompany the photography. The titles and annotations often revealed personal information about her subjects.

===Resettlement Administration===


Lange and Dixon divorced on October 28, 1935, and on December 6 she married economist Paul Schuster Taylor, professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley. For the next five years they traveled through the California coast and the midwest. Throughout their travels they documented rural poverty, in particular the exploitation of sharecroppers and migrant laborers. Taylor interviewed subjects and gathered economic data while Lange produced photographs and accompanying data. They lived and worked from Berkeley for the rest of her life.

Working for the Resettlement Administration and Farm Security Administration, Lange&#x27;s images brought to public attention the plight of the poor and forgotten—particularly sharecroppers, displaced farm families, and migrant workers. Lange&#x27;s work was distributed to newspapers across the country, and the poignant images became icons of the era.

One of Lange&#x27;s most recognized works is &quot;Migrant Mother&quot;, published in 1936. The woman in the photograph is Florence Owens Thompson. In 1960, Lange spoke about her experience taking the photograph:

Lange reported the conditions at the camp to the editor of a San Francisco newspaper, showing him her photographs. The editor informed federal authorities and published an article that included some of the images. In response, the government rushed aid to the camp to prevent starvation.

According to Thompson&#x27;s son, while Lange got some details of the story wrong, the impact of the photograph came from an image that projected both the strengths and needs of migrant workers. Twenty-two of Lange&#x27;s photographs produced for the FSA were included in John Steinbeck&#x27;s &quot;The Harvest Gypsies&quot; when it was first published in 1936 in &quot;The San Francisco News&quot;. Lange&#x27;s photos served as inspiration for the 1940 film adaptation of The Grapes of Wrath. According to an essay by photographer Martha Rosler, &quot;Migrant Mother&quot; became the most reproduced photograph in the world.

===Japanese American internment===

In 1941, Lange became the first woman to be awarded a prestigious Guggenheim Fellowship for in Photography. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, she gave up the fellowship in order to go on assignment for the War Relocation Authority (WRA) to document the forced evacuation of Japanese Americans from the west coast of the US. She covered the internment of Japanese Americans and their subsequent incarceration, traveling throughout urban and rural California to photograph families required to leave their houses and hometowns on orders of the government. Lange visited several temporary assembly centers as they opened, eventually fixing on Manzanar, the first of the permanent internment camps (located in eastern California, some 300 miles from the coast).

Much of Lange&#x27;s work focused on the waiting and anxiety caused by the forced collection and removal of people: piles of luggage waiting to be sorted; families waiting for transport, wearing identification tags; young-to-elderly individuals, stunned, not comprehending why they must leave their homes, or what their future held. (See Exclusion, removal, detention.) To many observers, Lange&#x27;s photography—including one photo of American school children pledging allegiance to the flag shortly before being removed from their homes and schools and sent to internment—is a haunting reminder of the travesty of incarcerating people who are not charged with committing a crime.

Sensitive to the implications of her images, authorities impounded most of Lange&#x27;s photography of the internment process—these photos were not seen publicly during the war. Today her photography of the evacuations and internments is available in the National Archives on the website of the Still Photographs Division and at the Bancroft Library of the University of California, Berkeley.

===California School of Fine Arts and San Francisco Art Institute===

In 1945, Ansel Adams invited Lange to teach at the first fine art photography department at the California School of Fine Arts (CSFA), now known as San Francisco Art Institute (SFAI). Imogen Cunningham and Minor White also joined the faculty.

== &quot;Aperture&quot; and &quot;Life&quot;==
In 1952, Lange co-founded the photography magazine &quot;Aperture&quot;. In the mid-1950s, &quot;Life&quot; magazine commissioned Lange and Pirkle Jones to shoot a documentary about the death of the town of Monticello, California, and the subsequent displacement of its residents by the damming of Putah Creek to form Lake Berryessa. After &quot;Life&quot; decided not to run the piece, Lange devoted an entire issue of &quot;Aperture&quot; to the work. The collection was shown at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1960.

Another series for &quot;Life&quot;, begun in 1954 and featuring the attorney Martin Pulich, grew out of Lange&#x27;s interest in how poor people were defended in the court system, which by one account, grew out of personal experience associated with her brother&#x27;s arrest and trial.

== Death and legacy ==

Lange&#x27;s health declined in the last decade of her life. Among other conditions she suffered from was what later was identified as post-polio syndrome. She died of esophageal cancer on October 11, 1965, in San Francisco, at age seventy. She was survived by her second husband, Paul Taylor, two children, three stepchildren, and numerous grandchildren and great-grandchildren.

Three months after her death, the Museum of Modern Art in New York City mounted a retrospective of her work that Lange had helped to curate. It was MoMA&#x27;s first retrospective solo exhibition of the works of a female photographer. In February 2020, MoMA exhibited her work again, with the title &quot;Dorothea Lange: Words and Pictures&quot;, prompting critic Jackson Arn to write that &quot;the first thing&quot; this exhibition &quot;needs to do—and does quite well—is free her from the history textbooks where she&#x27;s long been jailed.&quot; Contrasting her work with that of other twentieth century photographers such as Eugène Atget and André Kertész whose images &quot;were in some sense context-proof, Lange&#x27;s images tend to cry out for further information. Their aesthetic power is obviously bound up in the historical importance of their subjects, and usually that historical importance has had to be communicated through words.&quot; That characteristic has caused &quot;art purists&quot; and &quot;political purists&quot; alike to criticize Lange&#x27;s work, which Arn argues is unfair: &quot;The relationship between image and story&quot;, Arn notes, was often altered by Lange&#x27;s employers as well as by government forces when her work did not suit their commercial purposes or undermined their political purposes. In his review of this exhibition, critic Brian Wallis also stressed the distortions in the &quot;afterlife of photographs&quot; that often went contrary to Lange&#x27;s intentions. Finally, Jackson Arn situates Lange&#x27;s work alongside other Depression-era artists such as Pearl Buck, Margaret Mitchell, Thornton Wilder, John Steinbeck, Frank Capra, Thomas Hart Benton, and Grant Wood in terms of their role creating a sense of the national &quot;We&quot;.

In 1984 Lange was inducted into the International Photography Hall of Fame and Museum. In 2003, Lange was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame. In 2006, an elementary school was named in her honor in Nipomo, California, near the site where she had photographed &quot;Migrant Mother&quot;. In 2008, she was inducted into the California Hall of Fame, located at The California Museum for History, Women and the Arts. Her son, Daniel Dixon, accepted the honor in her place. In October 2018, Lange&#x27;s hometown of Hoboken, New Jersey honored her with a mural depicting Lange and two other prominent women from Hoboken&#x27;s history, Maria Pepe and Dorothy McNeil. In 2019, Rafael Blanco painted a mural of Lange outside of a photography building in Roseville, California.

==Art market==
In May 2023, Sotheby&#x27;s New York auctioned pieces from the Pier 24 Photography&#x27;s oversized 1940s-era print of &quot;Migrant Mother&quot; for double estimate $609,000.

<doc id="152827" wikidata="Q42740" url="?curid=152827" title="Han Chinese">
<text>The Han Chinese, alternatively the Han people or simply the Chinese, are an East Asian ethnic group native to Greater China. With a global population of over 1.4 billion, the Han Chinese are the world&#x27;s largest ethnic group, making up about 17.5% of the world population. The Han Chinese represent 91.11% of the population in China and 97% of the population in Taiwan. Han Chinese are also a significant diasporic group in Southeast Asian countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. In Singapore, people of Han Chinese or Chinese descent make up around 75% of the country&#x27;s population.

The Han Chinese have exerted a primary formative influence in the development and growth of Chinese civilization. Originating from the Central Plains, the Han Chinese trace their ancestry to the Huaxia people, a confederation of agricultural tribes that lived along the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River in the north central plains of China. The Huaxia are the progenitors of Chinese civilization and ancestors of the modern Han Chinese.

Han Chinese people and culture later spread southwards in the Chinese mainland, driven by large and sustained waves of migration during successive periods of Chinese history, e.g. the Qin (221–206 BC) and Han (202 BC220 AD) dynasties, leading to a demographic and economic tilt towards the south, and the absorption of various non-Han ethnic groups over the centuries at various points in Chinese history. The Han Chinese became the main inhabitants of the fertile lowland areas and cities of southern China by the time of the Tang and Song dynasties, with minority tribes occupying the highlands.

== Identity ==
The term &quot;Han&quot; not only refers to a specific ethnic collective, but also points to a shared ancestry, history, and cultural identity. The term &quot;Huaxia&quot; was used by the ancient Chinese philosopher Confucius&#x27;s contemporaries during the Warring States period to elucidate the shared ethnicity of all Chinese; Chinese people called themselves &quot;Hua ren&quot;. The Warring States period led to the emergence of the Zhou-era Chinese referring to themselves as being Huaxia (literally &#x27;the beautiful grandeur&#x27;): under the Hua–Yi distinction, a &quot;Hua&quot; culture (often translated as &#x27;civilized&#x27;) was contrasted to that of peoples perceived as &quot;Yi&quot; (often translated as &#x27;barbarian&#x27;) living on the peripheries of the Zhou kingdoms. Overseas Chinese who possess non-Chinese citizenship are commonly referred as &quot;Hua people&quot; () or &quot;Huazu&quot; (). The two respective aforementioned terms are applied solely to those with a Han background that is semantically distinct from &quot;Zhongguo ren&quot; () which has connotations and implications limited to being citizens and nationals of China, especially with regard to ethnic minorities in China.

==Designation==

=== &quot;Han people&quot; ===
The name &quot;Han people&quot; () first appeared during the Northern and Southern period and was inspired by the Han dynasty, which is considered to be one of the first golden ages in Chinese history. As a unified and cohesive empire that succeeded the short-lived Qin dynasty, Han China established itself as the center of the East Asian geopolitical order at the time, projecting its power and influence unto Asian neighbors. It was comparable with the contemporary Roman Empire in population size, geographical extent, and cultural reach. The Han dynasty&#x27;s prestige and prominence led many of the ancient Huaxia to identify themselves as &#x27;Han people&#x27;. Similarly, the Chinese language also came to be named and alluded to as the &quot;Han language&quot; () ever since and the Chinese script is referred to as &quot;Han characters&quot;.

=== &quot;Huaren&quot; and &quot;Huayi&quot; ===
Prior to the Han dynasty, Chinese scholars used the term &quot;Huaxia&quot; () in texts to describe China proper, while the Chinese populace were referred to as either the &#x27;various Hua&#x27; () or &#x27;various Xia&#x27; (). This gave rise to two term commonly used nowadays by Overseas Chinese as an ethnic identity for the Chinese diaspora – &quot;Huaren&quot; () and &quot;Huaqiao&quot; (), meaning Overseas Chinese. It has also given rise to the literary name for China – &quot;Zhonghua&quot; (). While the general term &quot;Zhongguo ren&quot; () refers to any Chinese citizen or Chinese national regardless of their ethnic origins and does not necessary imply Han ancestry, the term &quot;huaren&quot; in its narrow, classical usages implies Central Plains or Han ancestry.

=== &quot;Tangren&quot; ===
Among some Southern Han Chinese varieties such as Cantonese, Hakka and Minnan, the term &quot;Tangren&quot; (), derived from the name of the later Tang dynasty (618–907) that oversaw what is regarded as another golden age of China. The self-identification as &quot;Tangren&quot; is popular in south China, because it was at this time that massive waves of migration and settlement led to a shift in the center of gravity of the Chinese nation away from the tumult of the Central Plains to the peaceful lands south of the Yangtze and on the southeastern coast, leading to the earnest settlement by Chinese of lands hitherto regarded as part of the empire&#x27;s sparsely populated frontier or periphery. Guangdong and Fujian, hitherto regarded as backwater regions populated by the descendants of garrison soldiers, exiles and refugees, became new centers and representatives of Han Chinese culture under the influence of the new Han migrants. The term is used in everyday colloquial discourse and is also an element in one of the words for Chinatown: . The phrase is also used to refer to Chinatowns.

=== &quot;Zhonghua minzu&quot; ===
The term &quot;Zhonghua minzu&quot;, literally the &#x27;Chinese nation&#x27;, currently used as a supra-ethnic concept publicised first by the Republic of China, then by the People&#x27;s Republic of China, was historically used specifically to refer to the Han Chinese. In his article &quot;Observations on the Chinese ethnic groups in History&quot;, Liang Qichao, who coined the term &quot;Zhonghua minzu&quot;, wrote &quot;the present-day &quot;Zhonghua minzu&quot; refers to what is commonly known as the Han Chinese&quot;. It was only after the founding of the Society for the National Great Unity of the Republic of China in 1912 that the term began to officially include ethnic minorities from all regions in China.

==Han Chinese subgroups ==

Han Chinese can be divided into various subgroups based on the variety of Chinese that they speak. Waves of migration have occurred throughout China&#x27;s long history and vast geographical expanse, engendering the emergence of Han Chinese subgroups found throughout the various regions of modern China today with distinct regional features.

The expansion of the Han people outside their linguistic homeland in the Yellow River is an important part of their historical consciousness and ethnogenesis, and accounts for their present-day diversity.

There were several periods of mass migration of Han people to Southeastern and Southern China throughout history. Initially, the sparsely populated regions of south China were inhabited by tribes known only as the Bai Yue or Hundred Yue. Many of these tribes developed into kingdoms under rulers and nobility of Han Chinese ethnicity but retained a Bai Yue majority for several centuries. Yet others were forcibly brought into the Sinosphere by the imperial ambitions of emperors such as Qin Shi Huangdi and Han Wu Di, both of whom settled hundreds of thousands of Chinese in these lands to form agricultural colonies and military garrisons. Even then, control over these lands was tenuous, and Bai Yue cultural identity remained strong until sustained waves of Han Chinese emigration in the Jin, Tang and Song dynasties altered the demographic balance completely.


Chinese language (or Chinese languages) can be divided to 10 primary dialects (or languages).

Each Han Chinese subgroup (民系) can be identified through their dialects:
* Wu (吴语): Jiangzhe people (江浙民系)
* Hui (徽语): Wannan people (皖南民系)
* Gan (赣语): Jiangxi people (江西民系)
* Xiang (湘语): Hunan people (湖南民系)
* Min (闽语): Minhai people (闽海民系)
* Hakka (客语): Hakka people (客家民系)
* Yue (粤语): Cantonese people (岭南民系)
* Pinghua and Tuhua (平话和土话): Pingnan people (平南民系)
* Jin (晋语): Jinsui people (晋绥民系)
* Mandarin (官话): Northern people (北方民系)
** Northeastern (东北): Northeastern people (东北民系)
** Beijing (北平): Youyan people (幽燕民系)
** Jilu (冀鲁): Jilu people (冀鲁民系)
** Jiaoliao (胶辽): Jiaoliao people (胶辽民系)
** Central Plains (中原): Central Plains people (中原民系)
** Lanyin (兰银): Longyou people (陇右民系)
** Southwestern (西南): Southwestern people (西南民系)
** Jianghuai (江淮): Jianghuai people (江淮民系)

=== Military garrisons and agricultural colonies ===
The first emperor Qin Shih Huang Di is said to have sent several hundred thousand men and fifteen thousand women to form agricultural and military settlements in Lingnan (present day Guangxi and Guangdong), under the leadership of a general named Zhao Tuo. The famous Han emperor, Han Wu Di, ordered another two hundred thousand men to build ships to attack and colonialize the Lingnan region, thus adding to the population in Guangdong and Guangxi. The first urban conurbations in the region, for example, Panyu, were created by Han settlers rather than the Bai Yue, who preferred to maintain small settlements subsisting on swidden agriculture and rice farming. Later on, Guangdong, Northern Vietnam, and Yunnan all experienced a surge in Han Chinese migrants during Wang Mang&#x27;s reign. The demographic composition and culture of these regions during this period, could however scarcely be said to have been Sinitic outside the confines of these agricultural settlements and military outposts.

=== Historical southward migrations ===
The genesis of the modern Han people and their subgroups cannot be understood apart from their historical migrations to the south, resulting in a depopulation of the Central Plains, a fission between those that remained and those that headed south, and their subsequent fusion with aboriginal tribes south of the Yangtze, even as the centres of Han Chinese culture and wealth moved from the Yellow River Basin to Jiangnan, and to a lesser extent also, to Fujian and Guangdong.

At various points in Chinese history, collapses of central authority in the face of barbarian uprisings or invasions and the loss of control of the Chinese heartland triggered mass migratory waves which transformed the demographic composition and cultural identity of the south. This process of sustained mass migration has been known as &quot;garments and headdresses moving south&quot; 衣冠南渡 (yì guān nán dù), on account of it first being led by the aristocratic classes.

Such migratory waves were numerous and triggered by such events such as the Uprising of the Five Barbarians during the Jin dynasty (304–316 AD) in which China was completely overrun by minority groups previously serving as vassals and servants to Sima (the royal house of Jin), the An Lu Shan rebellion during the Tang dynasty (755–763 AD), and the Jingkang incident (1127 AD) and Jin-Song wars. These events caused widespread devastation, and even depopulated the north, resulting in the complete social and political breakdown and collapse of central authority in the Central Plains, triggering massive, sustained waves of Han Chinese migration into South China, leading to the formation of distinct Han lineages, who also likely assimilated the by-now partially sinicized Bai Yue in their midst.

Modern Han Chinese subgroups, such as the Cantonese, the Hakka, the Henghua, the Hainanese, the Hoklo peoples, the Gan, the Xiang, the Wu-speaking peoples, all claim Han Chinese ancestry pointing to official histories and their own genealogical records to support such claims. Linguists hypothesize that proto- Wu and Min varieties of Chinese may have originated from the time of Jin, while the proto- Yue and Hakka varieties perhaps from the Tang and Song, about half-a-millennium later. The presence of Tai-Kradai substrates in these dialects may have been due to the assimilation of the remaining groups of Bai Yue, integrating these lands into the Sinosphere proper.

==== First wave: Jin dynasty ====

The chaos of the Uprising of the Five Barbarians triggered the first massive movement of Han Chinese dominated by civilians rather than soldiers to the south, being led principally by the aristocracy and the Jin elite. Thus, Jiangnan, comprising Hangzhou&#x27;s coastal regions and the Yangtze valley were settled in the 4th century AD by families descended from Chinese nobility. Special &quot;commanderies of immigrants&quot; and &quot;white registers&quot; were created for the massive number of Han Chinese immigrating during this period which included notable families such as the Wang and the Xie. A religious group known as the Celestial Masters contributed to the movement. Jiangnan became the most populous and prosperous region of China.

The Uprising of the Five Barbarians, also led to the resettlement of Fujian. The province of Fujian - whose aboriginal inhabitants had been deported to the Central Plains by Han Wu Di, was now repopulated by Han Chinese settlers and colonists from the Chinese heartland. The &quot;Eight Great Surnames&quot; were eight noble families who migrated from the Central Plains to Fujian - these were the Hu, He, Qiu, Dan, Zheng, Huang, Chen and Lin clans, who remain there until this very day.

==== Tang dynasty and An Lushan rebellion ====

In the wake of the An Lushan rebellion, a further wave of Han migrants from Northern China headed the south. At the start of the rebellion in 755 there were 52.9 million registered inhabitants of the Tang Empire, and after its end in 764, only 16.9 million were recorded. It is likely that the difference in census figures was due to the complete breakdown in administrative capabilities, as well as the widespread escape from the north by the Han Chinese and their mass migration to the south.

By now, the Han Chinese population in the south far outstripped that of the Bai Yue. Guangdong and Fujian both experienced a significant influx of Northern Han Chinese settlers, leading many Cantonese, Hokkien and Teochew individuals to identify themselves as &quot;Tangren&quot;, which has served as a means to assert and acknowledge their ethnic and cultural origin and identity.

==== Jin–Song wars and Mongol invasion ====
The Jin–Song Wars caused yet another wave of mass migration of the Han Chinese from Northern China to Southern China, leading to a further increase in the Han Chinese population across southern Chinese provinces. The formation of the Hainanese and Hakka people can be attributed to the chaos of this period.

The Mongol conquest of China during the thirteenth century once again caused a surging influx of Northern Han Chinese refugees to move south to settle and develop the Pearl River Delta. These mass migrations over the centuries inevitably led to the demographic expansion, economic prosperity, agricultural advancements, and cultural flourishing of Southern China, which remained relatively peaceful unlike its northern counterpart.

==Distribution==

=== China ===
The vast majority of Han Chinese – over 1.2 billion – live in the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC), where they constitute about 90% of its overall population. Han Chinese in China have been a culturally, economically and politically dominant majority vis-à-vis the non-Han minorities throughout most of China&#x27;s recorded history. Han Chinese are almost the majority in every Chinese province, municipality and autonomous region except for the autonomous regions of Xinjiang (38% or 40% in 2010) and Tibet Autonomous Region (8% in 2014), where Uighurs and Tibetans are the majority, respectively.

==== Hong Kong and Macau ====
Han Chinese also constitute the majority in both of the special administrative regions of the PRC – about 92.2% and 88.4% of the population of Hong Kong and Macau, respectively. The Han Chinese in Hong Kong and Macau have been culturally, economically and politically dominant majority vis-à-vis the non-Han minorities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chua 2003 https://archive.org/details/worldonfirehowex00chua_0/page/178 178&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Taiwan ===

There are over 22 million people of Han Chinese ancestry in living in Taiwan. At first, these migrants chose to settle in locations that bore a resemblance to the areas they had left behind in China, regardless of whether they arrived in the north or south of Taiwan. Hoklo immigrants from Quanzhou settled in coastal regions and those from Zhangzhou tended to gather on inland plains, while the Hakka inhabited hilly areas.

Clashes and tensions between the two groups over land, water, ethno-racial, and cultural differences led to the relocation of some communities and over time, varying degrees of intermarriage and assimilation took place. In Taiwan, Han Chinese (including both the earlier Han Taiwanese settlers and the recent Chinese that arrived in Taiwan with Chiang Kai-shek in 1949) constitute over 95% of the population. They have also been a politically, culturally and economically dominant majority vis-à-vis the non-Han indigenous Taiwanese peoples.

=== Southeast Asia ===
Nearly 30 to 40 million people of Han Chinese descent live in Southeast Asia. According to a population genetic study, Singapore is &quot;the country with the biggest proportion of Han Chinese&quot; in Southeast Asia. Singapore is the only nation in the world where Overseas Chinese constitute a majority of the population and remain the country&#x27;s cultural, economic and politically dominant arbiters vis-à-vis their non-Han minority counterparts. Up until the past few decades, overseas Han communities originated predominantly from areas in Eastern and Southeastern China (mainly from the provinces of Fujian, Guangdong and Hainan, and to a lesser extent, Guangxi, Yunnan and Zhejiang).

=== Others ===
There are 60 million Overseas Chinese people worldwide. Overseas Han Chinese have settled in numerous countries across the globe, particularly within the Western World where nearly 4 million people of Han Chinese descent live in the United States (about 1.5% of the population), over 1 million in Australia (5.6%) and about 1.5 million in Canada (5.1%), nearly 231,000 in New Zealand (4.9%), and as many as 750,000 in Sub-Saharan Africa.

==History==
The Han Chinese have a rich history that spans thousands of years, with their historical roots dating back to the days of ancient China. Throughout Han history, China has been governed by dynasties, with periods during which it has seen cycles of expansion, contraction, unity, and fragmentation. Due to the overwhelming numerical and cultural dominance of Han culture in China, most of the written history of China can be read as &quot;a history of the Han Chinese,&quot; hinted and tinged with only passing references to its ethnic non-Han minority counterparts.

=== Prehistory ===
The prehistory of the Han Chinese is closely intertwined with both archaeology, biology, historical textual records, and mythology. The ethnic stock to which the Han Chinese originally trace their ancestry from were confederations of late Neolithic and early Bronze Age agricultural tribes known as the Huaxia that lived along the Guanzhong and Yellow River basins in Northern China. In addition, numerous ethnic groups were assimilated and absorbed by the Han Chinese at various points in China&#x27;s history. Like many modern ethnic groups, the ethnogenesis of Han Chinese was a lengthy process that involved the expansion of the successive Chinese dynasties and their assimilation of various non-Han ethnic groups that became sinicised over the centuries. 

During the Western Zhou and Han dynasties, Han Chinese writers established genealogical lineages by drawing from legendary materials originating from the Shang dynasty, while the Han dynasty historian Sima Qian&#x27;s &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot; places the reign of the Yellow Emperor, the legendary leader of Youxiong tribes (), at the beginning of Chinese history. The Yellow Emperor is traditionally credited to have united with the neighbouring Shennong tribes after defeating their leader, the Yan Emperor, at the Battle of Banquan. The newly merged Yanhuang tribes then combined forces to defeat their common enemy from the east, Chiyou of the Jiuli () tribes, at the Battle of Zhuolu and established their cultural dominance in the Central Plain region. To this day, modern Han Chinese refer themselves as &quot;Descendants of Yan and Huang&quot;.

Although study of this period of history is complicated by the absence of contemporary records, the discovery of archaeological sites has enabled a succession of Neolithic cultures to be identified along the Yellow River. Along the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River were the Cishan culture (), the Yangshao culture (), the Longshan culture () and the Erlitou culture (). These cultures are believed to be related to the origins of the Sino-Tibetan languages and later the Sinitic languages. They were the foundation for the formation of Old Chinese and the founding of the Shang dynasty, China&#x27;s first confirmed dynasty.
=== Early history ===

Early ancient Chinese history is largely legendary, consisting of mythical tales intertwined with sporadic annals written centuries to millennia later. Sima Qian&#x27;s &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot; recorded a period following the Battle of Zhuolu, during the reign of successive generations of confederate overlords () known as the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors (c. 2852–2070 BCE), who, allegedly, were elected to power among the tribes. This is a period for which scant reliable archaeological evidence exists – these sovereigns are largely regarded as cultural heroes.

==== Xia dynasty ====

The first dynasty to be described in Chinese historical records is the Xia dynasty (c. 2070–1600 BCE), established by Yu the Great after Emperor Shun abdicated leadership to reward Yu&#x27;s work in taming the Great Flood. Yu&#x27;s son, Qi, managed to not only install himself as the next ruler, but also dictated his sons as heirs by default, making the Xia dynasty the first in recorded history where genealogical succession was the norm. The civilizational prosperity of the Xia dynasty at this time is thought to have given rise to the name &quot;Huaxia&quot; (, &quot;the magnificent Xia&quot;), a term that was used ubiquitously throughout history to define the Chinese nation.

Conclusive archaeological evidence predating the 16th century BCE is, however, rarely available. Recent efforts of the Xia–Shang–Zhou Chronology Project drew the connection between the Erlitou culture and the Xia dynasty, but scholars could not reach a consensus regarding the reliability of such history.

==== Shang dynasty ====

The Xia dynasty was overthrown after the Battle of Mingtiao, around 1600 BCE, by Cheng Tang, who established the Shang dynasty (–1046 BCE). The earliest archaeological examples of Chinese writing date back to this period – from characters inscribed on oracle bones used for divination – but the well-developed characters hint at a much earlier origin of writing in China.

During the Shang dynasty, people of the Wu area in the Yangtze River Delta were considered a different tribe, and described as being scantily dressed, tattooed and speaking a distinct language. Later, Taibo, elder uncle of Ji Chang – on realising that his younger brother, Jili, was wiser and deserved to inherit the throne – fled to Wu and settled there. Three generations later, King Wu of the Zhou dynasty defeated King Zhou (the last Shang king), and enfeoffed the descendants of Taibo in Wu – mirroring the later history of Nanyue, where a Chinese king and his soldiers ruled a non-Han population and mixed with locals, who were sinicized over time.

==== Zhou dynasty ====

After the Battle of Muye, the Shang dynasty was overthrown by Zhou (led by Ji Fa), which had emerged as a western state along the Wei River in the 2nd millennium BCE. The Zhou dynasty shared the language and culture of the Shang people, and extended their reach to encompass much of the area north of the Yangtze River. Through conquest and colonization, much of this area came under the influence of sinicization and this culture extended south. However, the power of the Zhou kings fragmented not long afterwards, and many autonomous vassal states emerged. This dynasty is traditionally divided into two eras – the Western Zhou (1046–771 BCE) and the Eastern Zhou (770–256 BCE) – with the latter further divided into the Spring and Autumn (770–476 BCE) and the Warring States (476–221 BCE) periods. It was a period of significant cultural and philosophical diversification (known as the Hundred Schools of Thought) and Confucianism, Taoism and Legalism are among the most important surviving philosophies from this era.

=== Imperial history ===
==== Qin dynasty ====

The chaotic Warring States period of the Eastern Zhou dynasty came to an end with the unification of China by the western state of Qin after its conquest of all other rival states under King Ying Zheng. King Zheng then gave himself a new title &quot;First Emperor of Qin&quot; (), setting the precedent for the next two millennia. To consolidate administrative control over the newly conquered parts of the country, the First Emperor decreed a nationwide standardization of currency, writing scripts and measurement units, to unify the country economically and culturally. He also ordered large-scale infrastructure projects such as the Great Wall, the Lingqu Canal and the Qin road system to militarily fortify the frontiers. In effect, he established a centralized bureaucratic state to replace the old feudal confederation system of preceding dynasties, making Qin the first imperial dynasty in Chinese history.

This dynasty, sometimes phonetically spelt as the &quot;Ch&#x27;in dynasty&quot;, has been proposed in the 17th century by Martino Martini and supported by later scholars such as Paul Pelliot and Berthold Laufer to be the etymological origin of the modern English word &quot;China&quot;.

==== Han dynasty ====

The reign of the first imperial dynasty was short-lived. Due to the First Emperor&#x27;s autocratic rule and his massive labor projects, which fomented rebellion among his population, the Qin dynasty fell into chaos soon after his death. Under the corrupt rule of his son and successor Huhai, the Qin dynasty collapsed a mere three years later. The Han dynasty (206 BC–220 CE) then emerged from the ensuing civil wars and succeeded in establishing a much longer-lasting dynasty. It continued many of the institutions created by the Qin dynasty, but adopted a more moderate rule. Under the Han dynasty, art and culture flourished, while the Han Empire expanded militarily in all directions. Many Chinese scholars such as Ho Ping-ti believe that the concept (ethnogenesis) of Han ethnicity, although being ancient, was formally entrenched in the Han dynasty. The Han dynasty is considered one of the golden ages of Chinese history, with the modern Han Chinese people taking their ethnic name from this dynasty and the Chinese script being referred to as &quot;Han characters&quot;.

==== Three Kingdoms to Jin ====
The fall of the Han dynasty was followed by an age of fragmentation and several centuries of disunity amid warfare among rival kingdoms. There was a brief period of prosperity under the native Han Chinese dynasty known as the Jin (266–420 BC), although protracted struggles within the ruling house of Sima (司馬) sparked off a protracted period of fragmentation, rebellion by immigrant tribes that served as slaves and indentured servants, and extended non-native rule.

Non-native rule

During this time, areas of Northern China were overrun by various non-Han nomadic peoples, which came to establish kingdoms of their own, the most successful of which was the Northern Wei established by the Xianbei. From this period, the native population of China proper was referred to as Hanren, or the &quot;People of Han&quot; to distinguish them from the nomads from the steppe. Warfare and invasion led to one of the first great migrations of Han populations in history, as they fled south to the Yangzi and beyond, shifting the Chinese demographic center and speeding up sinicization of the far south. At the same time, most of the nomads in Northern China came to be sinicized as they ruled over large Chinese populations and adopted elements of their culture and administration. Of note, the Xianbei rulers of Northern Wei ordered a policy of systematic sinicization, adopting Han surnames, institutions, and culture, so the Xianbei became Han Chinese.

Sui and TangHan Chinese rule resumed during the Sui and Tang dynasties, led by the Han Chinese families of the Yang (杨) and Li (李) surnames respectively. Both the Sui and Tang dynasties are seen as high points of Han Chinese civilization. These dynasties both emphasized their aristocratic Han Chinese pedigree and enforced the restoration of Central Plains culture, even the founders of both dynasties had already intermarried with non-Han or partly-Han women from the Dugu and Yuwen families.

The Sui (581–618) and Tang (618–907) dynasties saw continuing emigration from the Central Plains to the south-eastern coast of what is now China proper, including the provinces of Fujian, Guangdong, and Hainan. This was especially true in the latter part of the Tang era and the Five Dynasties period that followed; the relative stability of the south coast made it an attractive destination for refugees fleeing continual warfare and turmoil in the north.

==== Song to Qing ====


The next few centuries saw successive invasions of Han and non-Han peoples from the north. In 1279, the Mongols conquered all of China, becoming the first non-Han ethnic group to do so, and established the Yuan dynasty. Emigration, seen as disloyal to ancestors and ancestral land, was banned by the Song and Yuan dynasties.

Zhu Yuanzhang, who had a Han-centered concept of China, and regarded expelling &quot;barbarians&quot; and restoring Han people&#x27;s China as a mission, established the Ming dynasty in 1368 after the Red Turban Rebellions. During this period, China referred to the Ming Empire and to the Han people living in them, and non-Han communities were separated from China.

Early Manchu rulers treated China as equivalent to both the Ming Empire and to the Han group. In 1644, the Ming capital, Beijing, was captured by Li Zicheng&#x27;s peasant rebels and the Chongzhen Emperor committed suicide. The Manchus of the Qing dynasty then allied with former Ming general Wu Sangui and seized control of Beijing. Remnant Ming forces led by Koxinga fled to Taiwan and established the Kingdom of Tungning, which eventually capitulated to Qing forces in 1683. Taiwan, previously inhabited mostly by non-Han aborigines, was sinicized during this period via large-scale migration accompanied by assimilation, despite efforts by the Manchus to prevent this, as they found it difficult to maintain control over the island. In 1681, the Kangxi Emperor ordered construction of the Willow Palisade to prevent Han Chinese migration to the three northeastern provinces, which nevertheless had harbored a significant Chinese population for centuries, especially in the southern Liaodong area. The Manchus designated Jilin and Heilongjiang as the Manchu homeland, to which the Manchus could hypothetically escape and regroup if the Qing dynasty fell. Because of increasing Russian territorial encroachment and annexation of neighboring territory, the Qing later reversed its policy and allowed the consolidation of a demographic Han majority in Northeast China. The Taiping Rebellion erupted in 1850 from the anti-Manchu sentiment of the Han Chinese, which killed at least twenty million people and made it one of the bloodiest conflicts in history. Late Qing revolutionary intellectual Zou Rong famously proclaimed that &quot;China is the China of the Chinese. We compatriots should identify ourselves with the China of the Han Chinese&quot;.

=== Republic history ===
The Han nationalist revolutionary Sun Yat-sen made Han Chinese superiority a basic tenet of the Chinese revolution in the early 1900s. In Sun&#x27;s revolutionary philosophical view, Han identity is exclusively possessed by the so-called civilized Hua Xia people who originated from the Central Plains, and were also the former subjects of the Celestial empire and evangelists of Confucianism. Restoring Chinese rule to the Han majority was one of the motivations for supporters of the 1911 Revolution to overthrow the Manchu-led Qing dynasty in 1912, which led to the establishment of the Han-dominated Republic of China.
Mao Zedong and his People&#x27;s Republic of China founded in 1949 was critical of Han chauvinism. In the latter half of the 20th century, official policy of communist China marked Han chauvinism as anti-Marxist. Today, the tension between the dominant Han Chinese majority and ethnic minorities remains contentious, as the deterioration in ethnic relations has compounded by China&#x27;s contemporary ethnic policies in favor of ethnic minorities since its founding. Han chauvinism has been gaining mainstream popularity throughout China since the 2000s, attributed to discontent toward these ethnic policies instituted by the Chinese government. The contemporary dissatisfaction and discord between the dominant Han Chinese mainstream and its non-Han minorities has led to the Chinese government scaling back on preferential treatment for ethnic minorities under the Xi Jinping administration.

==Culture and society==
Chinese civilization is one of the world&#x27;s oldest and most complex civilizations, whose culture dates back thousands of years. Overseas Han Chinese maintain cultural affinities to Chinese territories outside of their host locale through ancestor worship and clan associations, which often identify famous figures from Chinese history or myth as ancestors of current members. Such patriarchs include the Yellow Emperor and the Yan Emperor, who according to legend lived thousands of years ago and gave Han people the sobriquet &quot;Descendants of Yan and Huang Emperor&quot; (, ), a phrase which has reverberative connotations in a divisive political climate, as in that of major contentions between China and Taiwan. 

The Han Chinese also share a distinct set of cultural practices, traditions, and beliefs that have evolved over centuries. Traditional Han customs, art, dietary habits, literature, religious beliefs, and value systems have not only deeply influenced Han culture itself, but also the cultures of its East Asian neighbors as well. Chinese art, Chinese architecture, Chinese cuisine, Chinese dance, Chinese fashion, Chinese festivals, Chinese holidays, Chinese language, Chinese literature, Chinese music, Chinese mythology, Chinese numerology, Chinese philosophy, and Chinese theatre all have undergone thousands of years of development and growth, while numerous Chinese sites, such as the Great Wall and the Terracotta Army, are World Heritage Sites. Since this program was launched in 2001, aspects of Chinese culture have been listed by UNESCO as Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity. Throughout the history of China, Chinese culture has been heavily influenced by Confucianism. Credited with shaping much of Chinese philosophical thought, Confucianism was the official state philosophical doctrine throughout most of Imperial China&#x27;s history, institutionalizing values such as filial piety, which implied the performance of certain shared rituals. Thus, villagers lavished on funeral and wedding ceremonies that imitated the Confucian standards of the Emperors. Educational achievement and academic success gained through years of arduous study and mastery of classical Confucian texts was an imperative duty for defending and protecting one&#x27;s family honor while also providing the primary qualifying basis criterion for entry among ambitious individuals who sought to hold high ranking and influential government positions of distinguished authority, importance, responsibility, and power within the upper echelons of the imperial bureaucracy. But even among successful test takers and degree-holders who did not enter the imperial bureaucracy or who left it opting out to pursue other careers experienced significant improvements with respect to their credibility, pedigree, respectability, social status, and societal influence, resulting in a considerable amelioration with regards to the esteem, glory, honor, prestige, and recognition that they brought and garnered to their families, social circles, and the localities that they hailed from. This elevation in their social standing, respectability, and pedigree was greatly augmented both within their own family circles, as well as among their neighbors and peers compared with the regular levels of recognition that they would have typically enjoyed had they only chosen to remain as mere commoners back in their ancestral regions. Yet even such a dynamic social phenomenon has greatly influenced Han society, leading to the homogenization of the Han populace. Additionally, it has played a crucial role in the formation of a socially cohesive and distinct shared Han culture as well as the overall growth and integration of Han society. This development has been facilitated by various extraneous factors, including periods of rapid urbanization and sprouts of geographically extensive yet interconnected commodity markets.

=== Language ===

Han Chinese speak various forms of the Chinese language that are descended from a common early language; one of the names of the language groups is &quot;Hanyu&quot; (), literally the &quot;Han language&quot;. Similarly, Chinese characters, used to write the language, are called &quot;Hanzi&quot; () or &quot;Han characters&quot;.

In the Qing era, more than two-thirds of the Han Chinese population used a variant of Mandarin Chinese as their native tongue. However, there was a larger variety of languages in certain areas of Southeast China, &quot;in an arc extending roughly from Shanghai through Guangdong and into Guangxi.&quot; Since the Qin dynasty, which standardized the various forms of writing that existed in China, a standard literary Chinese had emerged with vocabulary and grammar that was significantly different from the various forms of spoken Chinese. A simplified and elaborated version of this written standard was used in business contracts, notes for Chinese opera, ritual texts for Chinese folk religion and other daily documents for educated people.

During the early 20th century, written vernacular Chinese based on Mandarin dialects, which had been developing for several centuries, was standardized and adopted to replace literary Chinese. While written vernacular forms of other varieties of Chinese exist, such as written Cantonese, written Chinese based on Mandarin is widely understood by speakers of all varieties and has taken up the dominant position among written forms, formerly occupied by literary Chinese. Thus, although residents of different regions would not necessarily understand each other&#x27;s speech, they generally share a common written language, Standard Written Chinese and Literary Chinese.

From the 1950s, Simplified Chinese characters were adopted in China and later in Singapore and Malaysia, while Chinese communities in Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan and overseas countries continue to use Traditional Chinese characters. Although significant differences exist between the two character sets, they are largely mutually intelligible.

=== Names ===
Through China, the notion of hundred surnames () is a crucial identity point of the Han people.

=== Fashion ===

Han Chinese clothing has been shaped through its dynastic traditions as well as foreign influences. Han Chinese clothing showcases the traditional fashion sensibilities of Chinese clothing traditions and forms one of the major cultural facets of Chinese civilization. Hanfu comprises all traditional clothing classifications of the Han Chinese with a recorded history of more than three millennia until the end of the Ming dynasty. During the Qing dynasty, Hanfu was mostly replaced by the Manchu style until the dynasty&#x27;s fall in 1911, yet Han women continued to wear clothing from Ming dynasty. Manchu and Han fashions of women&#x27;s clothing coexisted during the Qing dynasty. Moreover, neither Taoist priests nor Buddhist monks were required to wear the queue by the Qing; they continued to wear their traditional hairstyles, completely shaved heads for Buddhist monks, and long hair in the traditional Chinese topknot for Taoist priests. During the Republic of China period, fashion styles and forms of traditional Qing costumes gradually changed, influenced by fashion sensibilities from the Western World resulting modern Han Chinese wearing Western style clothing as a part of everyday dress.

Han Chinese clothing has continued to play an influential role within the realm of traditional East Asian fashion as both the Japanese Kimono and the Korean Hanbok were influenced by Han Chinese clothing designs.

=== Family ===
Han Chinese families throughout China have had certain traditionally prescribed roles, such as the family head (, &quot;jiāzhǎng&quot;), who represents the family to the outside world and the family manager (, &quot;dāngjiā&quot;), who is in charge of the revenues. Because farmland was commonly bought, sold or mortgaged, families were run like enterprises, with set rules for the allocation (, &quot;fēnjiā&quot;) of pooled earnings and assets.

Han Chinese houses differ from place to place. In Beijing, the whole family traditionally lived together in a large rectangle-shaped house called a &quot;siheyuan&quot;. Such houses had four rooms at the front – guest room, kitchen, lavatory and servants&#x27; quarters. Across large double doors was a wing for the elderly in the family. This wing consisted of three rooms: a central room where the four tablets – heaven, earth, ancestor and teacher – were worshipped and two rooms attached to the left and right, which were bedrooms for the grandparents. The east wing of the house was inhabited by the eldest son and his family, while the west wing sheltered the second son and his family. Each wing had a veranda; some had a &quot;sunroom&quot; made with surrounding fabric and supported by a wooden or bamboo frame. Every wing was also built around a central courtyard that was used for study, exercise or nature viewing.

Ancestry and lineage are an important part of Han Chinese cultural practice and self-identity, and there have been strict naming conventions since the time of the Song dynasty that have been preserved until this day. Elaborate and detailed genealogies and family registers are maintained, and most lineage branches of all surname groups will maintain a hall containing the memorial tablets (also known as spirit tablets) of deceased family members in clan halls. Extended family groupings have been very important to the Han Chinese, and there are strict conventions as how one may refer to aunts, uncles, and cousins and the spouses of the same, depending on their birth order as well as whether these blood relatives share the same surname.Ancestral halls and academies, as well as tombs were of great import to the Chinese. Ancestral halls were used for the veneration or commemoration of ancestors and other large family events. Family members preferred to be buried near one another. Academies were also set up to benefit those of the same surname. 

=== Food ===
There is no one specific uniform cuisine of the Han Chinese since the culinary traditions and food consumed varies from Sichuan&#x27;s famously spicy food to Guangdong&#x27;s dim sum and fresh seafood. Analyses throughout the reaches of Northern and Southern China have revealed their main staple to be rice (more likely to consumed by Southerners) as well as noodles and other wheat-based food items (which are more likely to be eaten by Northerners). During China&#x27;s Neolithic period, southwestern rice growers transitioned to millet from the northwest, when they could not find a suitable northwestern ecology – which was typically dry and cold – to sustain the generous yields of their staple as well as it did in other areas, such as along the eastern Chinese coast.

=== Literature ===

With a rich historical literary heritage spanning over three thousand years, the Han Chinese have continued to push the boundaries that have circumscribed the standards of literary excellence by showcasing an unwaveringly exceptional caliber and extensive wealth of literary accomplishments throughout the ages. The Han Chinese possess a vast catalogue of classical literature that can be traced back as far as three millennia, with a body of literature encompassing significant early works such as the &quot;Classic of Poetry&quot;, &quot;Analects of Confucius&quot;, &quot;I Ching&quot;, &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot; and the &quot;Art of War&quot;. Canonical works of Buddhism, Confucianism, and Taoism alongside historical writings, philosophical works, treatises, poetry, drama, and fiction have been revered and immortalized as timeless cultural masterpieces within the vast expanse of Chinese literature. Historically, ambitious individuals who aspired to seek top government positions of distinguished authority, importance, and power were mandated to demonstrate their proficiency in the Confucian classics assessed through rigorous examinations in Imperial China. Such comprehensive examinations were not only employed as the prevailing universal standards to evaluate a candidate&#x27;s ethical behavior and virtuous conduct, but were also deployed as a measure of academic aptitude that determined a candidate&#x27;s caliber, credibility, and eligibility for such esteemed roles of great influence and responsibility, extending beyond their prevailing entrance as a gateway into the imperial bureaucracy. Han literature itself has a rich tradition dating back thousands of years, from the earliest recorded dynastic court archives to the mature vernacular fiction novels that arose during the Ming dynasty which were employed as a source of cultural pleasure to entertain the masses of literate Chinese. Some of the most important Han Chinese poets in the pre-modern era were Li Bai, Du Fu and Su Dongpo. The most esteemed and noteworthy novels of great literary significance in Chinese literature, otherwise known as the Four Great Classical Novels are: &quot;Dream of the Red Chamber&quot;, &quot;Water Margin&quot;, &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; and &quot;Journey to the West&quot;.

Drawing upon their extensive literary heritage rooted in a historical legacy spanning over three thousand years, the Han Chinese have continued to demonstrate a uniformly high level of literary achievement throughout the modern era as the reputation of contemporary Chinese literature continues to be internationally recognized. Erudite literary scholars who are well-versed in Chinese literature continue to remain highly esteemed in contemporary Chinese society. Liu Cixin&#x27;s &quot;San Ti&quot; series won the Hugo Award. Gao Xingjian became the first Chinese novelist to receive the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2000. In 2012, the novelist and short story writer Mo Yan also received the Nobel Prize in Literature. In 2015, children&#x27;s writer Cao Wenxuan was bestowed with the Hans Christian Andersen Award, the first Chinese recipient of the esteemed international children&#x27;s book prize.

=== Science and technology ===
The Han Chinese have made significant contributions to various fields in the advancement and progress of human civilization, including business and economy, culture and society, governance, and science and technology, both historically and in the modern era. They have also played a pivotal role in being at the forefront of shaping the evolutionary trajectory of Chinese civilization and significantly influenced the advancement of East Asian civilization in concurrence with the broader region of East Asia as a whole. The invention of paper, printing, the compass and gunpowder are celebrated in Chinese society as the Four Great Inventions. The innovations of Yi Xing (683–727), a polymathic Buddhist monk, mathematician, and mechanical engineer of the Tang dynasty is acknowledged for applying the earliest-known escapement mechanism to a water-powered celestial globe. The accomplishments and advancements of the Song dynasty polymath Su Song (1020–1101) is recognized for inventing a hydro-mechanical astronomical clock tower in medieval Kaifeng, which employed an early escapement mechanism. The work of medieval Chinese polymath Shen Kuo (1031–1095) of the Song dynasty theorized that the sun and moon were spherical and wrote of planetary motions such as retrogradation as well as postulating theories for the processes of geological land formation. Medieval Han Chinese astronomers were also among the first peoples to record observations of a cosmic supernova in 1054 AD, the remnants of which would form the Crab Nebula.

In the contemporary era, Han Chinese have continued to contribute to the development and growth of modern science and technology. Among such prominently illustrious names that have been honored, recognized, remembered, and respected for their historical groundbreaking achievements include Nobel Prize laureates Tu Youyou, Steven Chu, Samuel C.C. Ting, Chen Ning Yang, Tsung-Dao Lee, Yuan T. Lee, Daniel C. Tsui, Roger Y. Tsien and Charles K. Kao (known as the &quot;Godfather of Broadband&quot; and &quot;Father of Fiber Optics&quot;); Fields Medalists Terence Tao and Shing-Tung Yau as well as Turing Award winner Andrew Yao. Tsien Hsue-shen was a prominent aerospace engineer who helped to establish NASA&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Chen Jingrun was a noted mathematician recognized for his contributions to number theory, where he demonstrated that any sufficiently large even number can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers or a prime number and a semiprime, a concept now known as Chen&#x27;s theorem.

The 1978 Wolf Prize in Physics inaugural recipient and physicist Chien-Shiung Wu, nicknamed the &quot;First Lady of Physics&quot; contributed to the development of the Manhattan Project and radically altered modern physical theory and changed the conventionally accepted view of the structure of the universe. The geometer Shiing-Shen Chern has been regarded as the &quot;father of modern differential geometry&quot; and has also been recognized as one of the greatest mathematicians of the 20th-century. Chern was awarded the 1984 Wolf Prize in mathematics in recognition for his fundamental contributions to the development and growth of differential geometry and topology. The botanist Shang Fa Yang was well-noted for his research that unlocked the key to prolonging freshness in fruits and flowers and &quot;for his remarkable contributions to the understanding of the mechanism of biosynthesis, mode of action and applications of the plant hormone, Ethylene.&quot; The agronomist Yuan Longping, regarded as the &quot;Father of Hybrid Rice&quot; was famous for developing the world&#x27;s first set of hybrid rice varieties in the 1970s, which was then part of the Green Revolution that marked a major scientific breakthrough within the field of modern agricultural research. The physical chemist Ching W. Tang, was the inventor of the organic light-emitting diode (OLED) and hetero-junction organic photovoltaic cell (OPV) and is widely considered the &quot;Father of Organic Electronics&quot;. Biochemist Chi-Huey Wong is well known for his pioneering research in glycoscience research and developing the first enzymatic method for the large-scale synthesis of oligosaccharides and the first programmable automated synthesis of oligosaccharides. The chemical biologist Chuan He is notable for his work in discovering and deciphering reversible RNA methylation in post-transcriptional gene expression regulation. Chuan is also noteworthy for having invented TAB-seq, a biochemical method that can map 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) at base-resolution genome-wide, as well as hmC-Seal, a method that covalently labels 5hmC for its detection and profiling.

Other prominent Han Chinese who have made notable contributions the development and growth of modern science and technology include the medical researcher, physician, and virologist David Ho, who was one of the first scientists to propose that AIDS was caused by a virus, thus subsequently developing combination antiretroviral therapy to combat it. In recognition of his medical contributions, Ho was named &quot;Time&quot; magazine Person of the Year in 1996. The medical researcher and transplant surgeon Patrick Soon-Shiong is the inventor of the drug Abraxane, which became known for its efficacy against lung, breast, and pancreatic cancer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Forb 2020/08/27&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Soon-Shiong is also well known for performing the first whole-pancreas transplant and he developed and first performed the experimental Type 1 diabetes-treatment known as encapsulated-human-islet transplant, and the &quot;first pig-to-man islet-cell transplant in diabetic patients.&quot; The physician and physiologist Thomas Ming Swi Chang is the inventor of the world&#x27;s first artificial cell made from a permeable plastic sack that would effectively carry hemoglobin around the human circulatory system. Chang is also noteworthy for his development of charcoal-filled cells to treat drug poisoning in addition to the discovery of enzymes carried by artificial cells as a medical tool to correct the faults within some metabolic disorders. Min Chueh Chang was the co-inventor of the combined oral contraceptive pill and is known for his pioneering work and significant contributions to the development of in vitro fertilization at the Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology. Biochemist Choh Hao Li discovered human growth hormone (and subsequently used it to treat a form of dwarfism caused by growth hormone deficiency), beta-endorphin (the most powerful of the body&#x27;s natural painkillers), follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone (the key hormone used in fertility testing, an example is the ovulation home test). Joe Hin Tjio was a cytogeneticist renowned as the first person to recognize the normal number of human chromosomes, a breakthrough in karyotype genetics. The bio-engineer Yuan-Cheng Fung, was regarded as the &quot;Father of modern biomechanics&quot; for pioneering the application of quantitative and analytical engineering principles to the study of the human body and disease. China&#x27;s system of &quot;barefoot doctors&quot; was among the most important inspirations for the World Health Organization conference in Alma Ata, Kazakhstan in 1978, and was hailed as a revolutionary breakthrough in international health ideology emphasizing primary health care and preventive medicine.

=== Religion ===
Confucianism, Daoism, and Chinese Buddhism, as well as other various traditional homegrown Chinese philosophies, have influenced not only Han Chinese culture, but also the neighboring cultures in East Asia. Chinese spiritual culture has been long characterized by religious pluralism and Chinese folk religion has always maintained a profound influence within the confines of Chinese civilization both historically and in the modern era. Indigenous Confucianism and Taoism share aspects of being a philosophy or a religion and neither demand exclusive adherence, resulting in a culture of tolerance and syncretism, where multiple religions or belief systems are often practiced in conjunction with local customs and traditions. Han culture has for long been influenced by Mahayana Buddhism, while in recent centuries Christianity has also gained a foothold among the population.

Chinese folk religion is a set of worship traditions of the ethnic deities of the Han people. It involves the worship of various extraordinary figures in Chinese mythology and history, heroic personnel such as Guan Yu and Qu Yuan, mythological creatures such as the Chinese dragon or family, clan and national ancestors. These practices vary from region to region and do not characterize an organized religion, though many traditional Chinese holidays such as the Duanwu (or Dragon Boat) Festival, Qingming Festival, Zhongyuan Festival and the Mid-Autumn Festival come from the most popular of these traditions.

Taoism, another indigenous Han philosophy and religion, is also widely practiced by the Han in both its folk forms and as an organized religion with its traditions having been a source of vestigial perennial influence on Chinese art, poetry, philosophy, music, medicine, astronomy, Neidan and alchemy, dietary habits, Neijia and other martial arts and architecture. Taoism was the state religion during the Han and Tang eras where it also often enjoyed state patronage under subsequent emperors and successive ruling dynasties.

Confucianism, although sometimes described as a religion, is another indigenous governing philosophy and moral code with some religious elements like ancestor worship. It continues to be deeply ingrained in modern Chinese culture and was the official state philosophy in ancient China during the Han dynasty and until the fall of imperial China in the 20th century (though it is worth noting that there is a movement in China today advocating that the culture be &quot;re-Confucianized&quot;).

During the Han dynasty, Confucian ideals were the dominant ideology. Near the end of the dynasty, Buddhism entered China, later gaining popularity. Historically, Buddhism alternated between periods of state tolerance (and even patronage) and persecution. In its original form, certain ideas in Buddhism was not quite compatible with traditional Chinese cultural values, especially with the Confucian sociopolitical elite, as certain Buddhist values conflicted with Chinese sensibilities. However, through centuries of mutual tolerance, assimilation, adaptation, and syncretism, Chinese Buddhism gained a respectable place in the culture. Chinese Buddhism was also influenced by Confucianism and Taoism and exerted influence in turn – such as in the form of Neo-Confucianism and Buddhist influences in Chinese folk religion, such as the cult of Guanyin, who is treated as a Bodhisattva, immortal, goddess or exemplar of Confucian virtue, depending on the tradition. The four largest schools of Han Buddhism (Chan, Jingtu, Tiantai and Huayan) were all developed in China and later spread throughout the Chinese sphere of influence.

Though Christian influence in China existed as early as the 7th century, Christianity did not gain a significant foothold in China until the establishment of contact with Europeans during the Ming and Qing dynasties. Christian beliefs often had conflicts with traditional Chinese values and customs which eventually resulted in the Chinese Rites controversy and a subsequent reduction in Christian influence in the country. Christianity grew considerably following the First Opium War, after which foreign missionaries in China enjoyed the protection of the Western powers and engaged in widespread proselytizing.

The People&#x27;s Republic of China government defined Chinese-speaking Muslims as a separate ethnic group, the &quot;Hui People&quot;. This was opposed by the Republic of China government and Muslim celebrities such as Bai Chongxi, the founder of the Chinese Muslim Association. Han Chinese Muslims were categorised as &quot;inland nationals with special living customs&quot; under the Republic of China government. Bai Chongxi believed that &quot;Hui&quot; is an alternative name for Islam as a religion in the Chinese language instead of the name for any ethnic group, and that Chinese-speaking Muslims should not be considered as a separate ethnic group apart from other Han Chinese.

== Genetics ==
=== Internal genetic structure ===
The internal genetic structure of the Han Chinese is consistent with the vast geographical expanse of China and the recorded history of large migratory waves over the past several millennia have engendered the emergence of the diverse Han subgroups displaying slight but discernible physical and physiological differences. Although genetically similar, Han Chinese subgroups exhibit a north–south stratification in their genetics, with centrally placed populations acting as conduits for outlying ones. Despite there being no clear genetic divide between the north and south due to the Han Chinese being a clinal population, many studies simply categorize the Han Chinese into two subgroups out of convenience: northern and southern Han Chinese. 

According to a 2020 study, northern and southern Han Chinese have similar genetic profiles that consist of Neolithic Yellow River (Sino-Tibetan) and southern Kra-Dai ancestries, although the Kra-Dai ancestry peaks in southern China. This reflects their common origin in Neolithic Chinese peoples, who were an admixture of northern and southern populations living in China. A 2022 study states that the massive Han subgroups differ in some of their ancestral components despite a shared Neolithic Yellow River farmer ancestry, reflective of their vast demographic history. They tend to share some maternal ancestry with geographically close minority groups. For example, Southern Han show evidence of being admixed with populations of Tai-Kadai and Austronesian ancestry. Southwestern Han show admixture with Hmong-Mien speakers, whilst Northwestern Han have very minor West Eurasian ancestral components, dating 4,500–1,200/1,300 years ago. Northeastern Han have more Yellow River Basin and some ancient Northeast Asian ancestry than Southern Han Chinese. Other studies also show bidirectional gene flow between Hmong-Mien-related and Kra-Dai-related ancestries in southern China.

Variation notwithstanding, Han Chinese subgroups are genetically closer to each other than they each are to their Korean and Yamato neighbors, to whom they are also genetically close in general. The close genetic relationship between the Han across the entirety of China has led to their characterization as having a &quot;coherent genetic structure&quot;.

The two notable exceptions to this structure are Pinghua and Tanka people, who on their patrilines, bear a closer genetic resemblance to aboriginal peoples, but have Han matrilines. The Tanka are a group of boat-dwellers who speak a Sinitic language and who claim Han ancestry, but who have traditionally faced severe discrimination from the other Southern Han subgroups. Unlike the Guangdong, Fujian and Hainan Han (whose dominant Y-chromosome haplotype is the Han patriline O2-M122), the Tanka have been shown instead to have a predominantly non-Han patriline similar to Daic peoples from Guizhou. However, matrilineally, the Tanka are closely clustered with the Hakka Han and Teochew Han, rather than with Austronesian or Austroasiatic populations, thus supporting an admixture hypothesis and validating, even if only partially, their own claims to Han ancestry.

=== Demic diffusion and north-south differences ===
The estimated contribution of Northern Han to the Southern Han is substantial in the paternal ancestral lineages in addition to a geographic cline that exists for its corresponding maternal ancestry. These genetic findings are in concord with historical records confirming the continuous and large migratory waves of Northern Han Chinese inhabitants escaping dynastic changes, geopolitical upheavals, instability, warfare and famine into what is now today modern Southern China. These successive waves of Han migration to the south, subsequent intermarriage and cultural mixing between the Northern Han migrants and the non-Han aborigines over the past few thousand years gave rise to modern Chinese demographics - a Han Chinese super-majority and minority non-Han Chinese indigenous peoples.

Han Chinese in Fujian and Guangdong provinces, however, show excessive ancestries from Late Neolithic Fujianese sources (35.0–40.3%), which are more significant in modern Ami, Atayal and Kankanaey (66.9–74.3%), and less significant in Han Chinese from Zhejiang (22%), Jiangsu (17%) and Shandong (8%). Within Guangdong Han, Cantonese, Teochew, and Hakka people show less genetic differences due to population assimilation and gene flow. Modern populations in Guangxi, Guizhou and Hunan also have Hmong-Mien-related admixture.

==== Patrilineal DNA ====
Typical Y-DNA haplogroups of present-day Han Chinese include Haplogroup O-M95, Haplogroup O-M122, Haplogroup O-M175, C, Haplogroup N, Haplogroup N-M231 and Haplogroup Q-M120.

The Y-chromosome haplogroup distribution between Southern Han Chinese and Northern Han Chinese populations and principal core component analysis indicates that almost all modern Han Chinese populations form a tight cluster in their Y chromosome:

* Haplogroups prevalent in non-Han southern natives such as O1b-M110, O2a1-M88 and O3d-M7, which are prevalent in non-Han southern natives, were observed in 4% of Southern Han Chinese and not at all in the Northern Han.
* Biological research findings have also demonstrated that the paternal lineages Y-DNA O-M119, O-P201, O-P203 and O-M95 are found in commonly Southern non-Han minorities, less commonly in Southern Han, and even less frequently in Northern Han Chinese.
* Haplogroups O1 and O2 significantly peak in the southeastern coastlines and eastern regions of China respectively, according to one study.

Patrilineal DNA indicates the Northern Han Chinese were the primary contributors to the paternal gene pool of modern Southern Han Chinese. The data also indicates that the contribution of southern non-Han aboriginals to the Southern Han Chinese genetics is limited. In short, male Han Chinese were the primary drivers of Han Chinese expansion in successive migratory waves from the north into what is now modern Southern China as is shown by a greater contribution to the Y-chromosome than the mtDNA from northern to Southern Han.

During the Zhou dynasty, or earlier, peoples with haplogroup Q-M120 also contributed to the ethnogenesis of Han Chinese people. This haplogroup is implied to be spread across in the Eurasian steppe and north Asia since it is found among Cimmerians in Moldova and Bronze Age natives of Khövsgöl. But it is currently near-absent in these regions except for East Asia. In modern China, haplogroup Q-M120 can be found in the northern and eastern regions.

Matrilineal DNA

MtDNA of Han Chinese increases in diversity as one looks from northern to Southern China, which suggests that the influx of male Han Chinese migrants intermarried with the local female non-Han aborigines after arriving in what is now modern-day Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hainan and other regions of Southern China. In these populations, the contribution to mtDNA from Han Chinese and indigenous tribes is evenly matched, representing a substantial mtDNA contribution from non-Han groups, collectively known as the Bai Yue or Hundred Yue.

A study by the Chinese Academy of Sciences into the gene frequency data of Han sub-populations and ethnic minorities in China, showed that Han sub-populations in different regions are also genetically quite close to the local ethnic non-Han minorities, meaning that in many cases, the blood of ethnic minorities had mixed into Han genetic substrate through varying degrees of intermarriage, while at the same time, the blood of the Han had also mixed into the genetic substrates of the local ethnic non-Han minorities.

=== Genetic continuity between ancient and modern Han Chinese ===
The Hengbei archaeological site in Jiang County, southern Shanxi was part of the suburbs of the capital during the Zhou dynasty. Genetic material from human remains in Hengbei have been used to examine the genetic continuity between ancient and modern Han Chinese.

Comparisons of Y chromosome single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) between modern Northern Han Chinese and 3000-year-old Hengbei samples reveal extreme similarity, confirming genetic continuity between ancient Hengbei inhabitants to present-day Northern Han Chinese. This shows that the core genetic structure of Northern Han Chinese was established more than three thousand years ago in the Central Plains Area. Additionally, these studies indicate that contemporary northern and Southern Han Chinese populations exhibit an almost identical Y-DNA genetic structure, indicating a common paternal descent, corroborating the historical record of Han Chinese migration to the south. However, a study of mitochondrial DNA from Yinxu commoner graves in the Shang dynasty showed similarity with modern Northern Han Chinese, but significant differences from Southern Han Chinese - indicating admixture on the matriline.

About 2,000 years ago, between the Warring States period and Eastern Han dynasty, the northeast coastlines of China faced an eastward migration from the Central Plains, shaping the genetic structure of local populations to the present. These populations also have more southern East Asian ancestry compared to their predecessors.

=== Closely related East Asian groups ===
The Han Chinese show a close yet distinguishable genetic relationship with other East Asian populations such as the Koreans and Yamato. Although the genetic relationship is close, the various Han Chinese subgroups are genetically closer to each other than to their Korean and Yamato counterparts.

Other research suggests a significant overlap between Yamato Japanese and the Northern Han Chinese in particular.

<doc id="152829" wikidata="Q4049828" url="?curid=152829" title="Southern Death Cult">
<text>Southern Death Cult were a British post-punk/gothic rock band that formed in Bradford during the early 1980s. They are now primarily known for having given their lead vocalist and parts of the name to the multi-platinum hard rock band the Cult. Despite the similarities in the names, &quot;Southern Death Cult&quot; were distinct from &quot;Death Cult&quot;/&quot;the Cult&quot;.

==History==

The musical history of Southern Death Cult can be charted as far back as early 1979 in Bradford, Yorkshire with the band Violation. Bassist Barry Jepson and drummer Haq Nawaz &quot;Aky&quot; Qureshi had formed the band with a guitarist now only known as Mick. The band rehearsed for about 7 months before playing their first show. The band played about 20 shows in total over the 18 months that they were together and recorded a set of thirteen demos on a 4 track on 3 and 4 January 1981 at Bradford Community Studio.

Southern Death Cult formed in 1981, with a lineup of vocalist Ian Astbury, guitarist David &quot;Buzz&quot; Burrows, Jepson, and Aky.

The group&#x27;s name derived from an old term for the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex, a mound-building Native American culture (and the band were also known for their use of Native American imagery), but it also served as a critique of the imbalance of power in the English North-South divide.

The first Southern Death Cult show took place on 29 October 1981 at the Queen&#x27;s Hall in Bradford.
Southern Death Cult toured heavily in the UK to promote the single, including slots opening for Theatre of Hate and Bauhaus at the end of 1982, but Astbury disbanded the group after a show in Manchester on 26 February 1983.

The band&#x27;s sole album, &quot;The Southern Death Cult&quot;, was posthumously issued by Beggars Banquet in 1983, compiling all three tracks from the single, live performances and BBC Radio 1 sessions.

==Later projects==
Astbury and guitarist Billy Duffy (of the Nosebleeds and Theatre of Hate) came together in April 1983 to form an act with a similar name, first called Death Cult and then, after releasing an eponymous four-song EP and a single later in 1983, renamed the Cult.

The other three ex-members of Southern Death Cult, augmented by vocalist Paul &quot;Bee&quot; Hampshire, formed Getting the Fear, who released one single, &quot;Last Salute&quot;, on RCA Records before splitting up in 1985.

Jepson and Hampshire went on to form Into a Circle, releasing the &quot;Assassins&quot; album in 1988. Jepson later worked as a concert promoter and currently teaches live sound and tour management at the British and Irish Modern Music Institute.

Burrows and Qureshi formed a band called Joy.

Qureshi then went on to form the political Islamic hip hop group Fun-Da-Mental and created the label Nation Records.

<doc id="152830" wikidata="Q183573" url="?curid=152830" title="Hui people">
<text>The Hui people are an East Asian ethnoreligious group predominantly composed of Chinese-speaking adherents of Islam. They are distributed throughout China, mainly in the northwestern provinces and in the Zhongyuan region. According to the 2010 census, China is home to approximately 10.5 million Hui people. Outside China, the 170,000 Dungan people of Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, the Panthays in Myanmar, and many of the Chin Haws in Thailand are also considered part of the Hui ethnicity.

The Hui were referred to as Hanhui during the Qing dynasty to be distinguished from the Turkic Muslims, which were referred to as Chanhui. The Republic of China government also recognised the Hui as a branch of the Han Chinese rather than a separate ethnic group. In the National Assembly of the Republic of China, the Hui were referred to as Nationals in China proper with special convention. The Hui were referred to as Muslim Han people by Bai Chongxi, the Minister of National Defense of the Republic of China at the time and the founder of the Chinese Muslim Association. Some scholars refer to this group as Han Chinese Muslims, Han Muslims, or Chinese Muslims, while others call them Chinese-speaking Muslims or Sino-Muslims.

The Hui were officially recognised as an ethnic group by the People&#x27;s Republic of China government in 1954. The government defines the Hui people to include all historically Muslim communities not included in China&#x27;s other ethnic groups; they are therefore distinct from other Muslim groups such as the Uyghurs. 

The Hui predominantly speak Chinese, while using some Arabic and Persian phrases. The Hui ethnic group is unique among Chinese ethnic minorities in that it is not associated with a non-Sinitic language. The Hui have a distinct connection with Islamic culture. For example, they follow Islamic dietary laws and reject the consumption of pork, the most commonly consumed meat in China, and have therefore developed their own variation of Chinese cuisine. They also have a traditional dress code, with some men wearing white caps (taqiyah) and some women wearing headscarves, as is the case in many Islamic cultures.

== Definition ==

=== Ancestry ===
Hui Muslims descend from Chinese, European, Arabs, Indo-Iranian Persians, Mongols, Turkic Uyghurs and other Central Asian immigrants. Their ancestors were of Middle Eastern, Central Asian and East Asian origin, who spread Islam in the area. Several medieval Chinese dynasties, particularly the Tang, Song and Mongol, witnessed foreign immigration from predominantly Muslim Persia and Central Asia, with both dynasties welcoming foreign Muslim traders from these regions and appointing Central Asian officials. In subsequent centuries, the immigrants gradually spoke Chinese and settled down, eventually forming the Hui.

===Genetics===
A study in 2004 calculated that 6.7 percent of Hui peoples&#x27; matrilineal genetics have a West-Eurasian origin and 93.3% are East-Eurasian, reflecting historical records of the population&#x27;s frequent intermarriage, especially with Mongol women. Studies of the Ningxia and Guizhou Hui also found only minor genetic contributions from West-Eurasian populations. Analysis of the Guizhou Hui&#x27;s Y chromosomes showed a high degree of paternal North or Central Asian heritage, indicating the population formed through male-dominated migration, potentially via a northern route, followed by massive assimilation of Guizhou aborigines into Han Chinese and Hui Muslims. 

The East Asian Y-chromosome haplogroup O-M122 is found in large quantities, about 24–30%, in other Muslims groups close to the Hui like the Dongxiangs, Bo&#x27;an, and Salar people. While the Y chromosome haplogroup R1a (found among Central Asians, South Asians and Europeans) are found among 17–28% of them. Western mtDNA makes up 6.6% to 8%. Other haplogroups include D-M174, N1a1-Tat, and Q, commonly found among East Asians and Siberians. The majority of Tibeto-Burmans, Han Chinese, and Ningxia and Liaoning Hui share paternal Y chromosomes of East Asian origin which are unrelated to Middle Easterners and Europeans. In contrast to distant Middle Easterners and Europeans with whom the Muslims of China are not significantly related, East Asians, Han Chinese, and most of the Hui and Dongxiang of Linxia share more genes with each other. This indicates that native East Asian populations were culturally assimilated, and that the Hui population was formed through a process of cultural diffusion.

An overview study in 2021 estimated that West Eurasian-related admixture among the average Northwestern Chinese minority groups was at ~9.1%, with the remainder being dominant East-Eurasian ancestry at ~90.9%. The study also showed that there is a close genetic affinity among these ethnic minorities in Northwest China (including Uyghurs, Huis, Dongxiangs, Bonans, Yugurs and Salars) and that these cluster closely with other East Asian people, especially in Xinjiang, followed by Mongolic, and Tungusic speakers, indicating the probability of a shared recent common ancestor of &quot;Altaic speakers&quot;. A genome study, using the ancestry-informative SNP (AISNP) analysis, found only 3.66% West-Eurasian-like admixture among Hui people, while the Uyghurs harbored the relative highest amount of West-Eurasian-like admixture at 36.30%.

=== Official ===

After the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949, the term &quot;Hui&quot; was applied by the Chinese government to one of China&#x27;s ten historically Islamic minorities. Today, the Chinese government defines the Hui people as an ethnicity without regard to religion, and includes those with Hui ancestry who do not practice Islam.

Chinese census statistics count among the Hui (and not as officially recognized separate ethnic groups) the Muslim members of a few small non-Chinese-speaking communities. These include several thousand Utsuls in southern Hainan Province, who speak an Austronesian language (Tsat) related to the language of the Vietnamese Champa Muslim minority. According to anthropologist Dru Gladney, they descend from Champa people who migrated to Hainan. A small Muslim minority among Yunnan&#x27;s Bai people are classified as Hui as well, although they speak Bai. Some groups of Tibetan Muslims are classified as Hui as well.

=== Huihui ===
&quot;Huihui&quot; () was the usual generic term for China&#x27;s Muslims (White Hui), Persian Christians (Black Hui) and Jews (Blue Hui) during the Ming and Qing dynasties. It is thought to have had its origin in the earlier &quot;Huihe&quot; () or &quot;Huihu&quot; (), which was the name for the Uyghur State of the 8th and 9th centuries. Although the ancient Uyghurs were not Muslims the name &quot;Huihui&quot; came to refer to foreigners, regardless of language or origin, by the time of the Yuan (1271–1368) and Ming dynasties (1368–1644). The use of Hui to denote all foreigners—Muslims, Nestorian Christians, or Jews—reflects bureaucratic terminology developed over the Yuan and Ming dynasties. Arab were &quot;white cap&quot;, Persians &quot;black cap&quot; and Jews &quot;blue cap&quot; Huihui. Islamic mosques and Jewish synagogues at the time were denoted by the same word, &quot;Qīngzhēnsì&quot; (: Temple of Purity and Truth).

Kublai Khan called both foreign Jews and Muslims in China &quot;Huihui&quot; when he forced them to stop halal and kosher methods of preparing food:

&quot;Among all the [subject] alien peoples only the Hui-hui say &quot;we do not eat Mongol food&quot;. [Cinggis Qa’an replied:] &quot;By the aid of heaven we have pacified you; you are our slaves. Yet you do not eat our food or drink. How can this be right?&quot; He thereupon made them eat. &quot;If you slaughter sheep, you will be considered guilty of a crime.&quot; He issued a regulation to that effect... [In 1279/1280 under Qubilai] all the Muslims say: &quot;if someone else slaughters [the animal] we do not eat&quot;. Because the poor people are upset by this, from now on, Musuluman [Muslim] Huihui and Zhuhu [Jewish] Huihui, no matter who kills [the animal] will eat [it] and must cease slaughtering sheep themselves, and cease the rite of circumcision.&quot;
The widespread and rather generic application of the name &quot;Huihui&quot; in Ming China was attested to by foreign visitors as well. Matteo Ricci, the first Jesuit to reach Beijing (1598), noted that &quot;Saracens are everywhere in evidence ... their thousands of families are scattered about in nearly every province&quot; Ricci noted that the term &quot;Huihui&quot; or &quot;Hui&quot; was applied by Chinese not only to &quot;Saracens&quot; (Muslims) but also to Chinese Jews and supposedly even to Christians. In fact, when the reclusive Wanli Emperor first saw a picture of Ricci and Diego de Pantoja, he supposedly exclaimed, &quot;Hoei, hoei. It is quite evident that they are Saracens&quot;, and had to be told by a eunuch that they actually weren&#x27;t, &quot;because they ate pork&quot;. The 1916 &quot;Encyclopædia of Religion and Ethics&quot;, Volume 8 said that Chinese Muslims always called themselves Huihui or Huizi, and that neither themselves nor other people called themselves Han, and they disliked people calling them Dungan. French army Commandant Viscount D&#x27;Ollone wrote a report on what he saw among Hui in 1910. He reported that due to religion, Hui were classed as a different nationality from Han as if they were one of the other minority groups.

&quot;Huizu&quot; is now the standard term for the &quot;Hui nationality&quot; (ethnic group), and &quot;Huimin&quot;, for &quot;Hui people&quot; or &quot;a Hui person&quot;. The traditional expression &quot;Huihui&quot;, its use now largely restricted to rural areas, would sound quaint, if not outright demeaning, to modern urban Chinese Muslims.

Islam was originally called Dashi Jiao during the Tang dynasty, when Muslims first appeared in China. &quot;Dashi Fa&quot; literally means &quot;Arab law&quot; in Old Chinese. Since almost all Muslims in China were exclusively foreign Arabs or Persians at the time, it was rarely mentioned by the Chinese, unlike other religions like Zoroastrism or Mazdaism, and Nestorian Christianity, which gained followings in China. As an influx of foreigners, such as Persians, Jews and Christians, the majority of whom were Muslims who came from western regions, were labelled as Semu people, but were also mistaken by Chinese for Uyghur, due to them coming from the west (Uyghur lands). The name &quot;Hui Hui&quot; was applied to them, and eventually became the name applied to Muslims.

Another, probably unrelated, early use of the word &quot;Huihui&quot; comes from the &quot;History of Liao&quot;, which mentions Yelü Dashi, the 12th-century founder of the Kara-Khitan Khanate, defeating the &quot;Huihui Dashibu&quot; () people near Samarkand—apparently, referring to his defeat of the Khwarazm ruler Ahmed Sanjar in 1141. Khwarazm is referred to as &quot;Huihuiguo&quot; in the &quot;Secret History of the Mongols&quot; as well.

While &quot;Huihui&quot; or &quot;Hui&quot; remained a generic name for all Muslims in Imperial China, specific terms were sometimes used to refer to particular groups, e.g. &quot;Chantou Hui&quot; (&quot;turbaned Hui&quot;) for Uyghurs, &quot;Dongxiang Hui&quot; and &quot;Sala Hui&quot; for Dongxiang and Salar people, and sometimes even &quot;Han Hui&quot; () (&quot;Chinese Hui&quot;) for the (presumably Chinese-speaking) Muslims more assimilated into the Chinese mainstream society.

In the 1930s, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) defined the term Hui as indicating only Sinophone Muslims. In 1941, this was clarified by a CCP committee comprising ethnic policy researchers in a treatise entitled &quot;On the question of Huihui Ethnicity&quot; (回回民族问题, Huíhui mínzú wèntí). This treatise defined the characteristics of the Hui nationality as an ethnic group associated with, but not defined by, Islam and descended primarily from Muslims who migrated to China during the Mongol-founded Yuan dynasty (1271–1368), as distinct from the Uyghur and other Turkic-speaking ethnic groups in Xinjiang. The Nationalist government by contrast recognised all Muslims as one of &quot;the five peoples&quot;—alongside the Manchus, Mongols, Tibetans, and Han Chinese—that constituted the Republic of China.

A traditional Chinese term for Islam is &quot;&quot; (pinyin: , literally &quot;the religion of the Hui&quot;). However, since the early days of the PRC, thanks to the arguments of such Marxist Hui scholars as Bai Shouyi, the standard term for &quot;Islam&quot; within the PRC has become the transliteration &quot;&quot; (pinyin: , literally &quot;Islam religion&quot;). The more traditional term &quot;Huijiao&quot; remains in use in Singapore, Taiwan and other overseas Chinese communities.

Qīngzhēn: (, literally &quot;pure and true&quot;) has also been a popular term for Muslim culture since the Yuan or Ming dynasty. Gladney suggested that a good translation for it would be the Arabic . i.e. &quot;ritual or moral purity&quot; The usual term for a mosque is (), i.e. &quot;true and pure temple&quot;, and is commonly used to refer to halal eating establishments and bathhouses.

In contrast, the Uyghurs were called &quot;Chan Tou Hui&quot; (&quot;Turban Headed Muslim&quot;), and the Turkic Salars called &quot;Sala Hui&quot; (Salar Muslim), while Turkic speakers often referred to Hui as &quot;Dungan&quot;.

Zhongyuan ren: During the Qing dynasty, the term &quot;Zhongyuan ren&quot; () was the term for all Chinese, encompassing Han Chinese and Hui in Xinjiang or Central Asia. While Hui are not Han, they consider themselves to be Chinese and include themselves in the larger group of &quot;Zhongyuan ren&quot;. The Dungan people, descendants of Hui who fled to Central Asia, called themselves &quot;Zhongyuan ren&quot; in addition to the standard labels &quot;lao huihui&quot; and &quot;huizi&quot;. was used by Turkic Muslims to refer to ethnic Chinese. When Central Asian invaders from Kokand invaded Kashgar, in a letter the Kokandi commander criticised the Kashgari Turkic Muslim Ishaq for allegedly not behaving like a Muslim and wanting to be a (Chinese).

Some Uyghurs barely see any difference between Hui and Han. A Uyghur social scientist, Dilshat, regarded Hui as the same people as Han, deliberately calling Hui people Han and dismissing the Hui as having only a few hundred years of history.

Pusuman: &quot;Pusuman&quot; was a name used by Chinese during the Yuan dynasty. It could have been a corruption of &quot;&quot; or another name for Persians. It means either Muslim or Persian. Pusuman Kuo (Pusuman Guo) referred to the country where they came from. The name &quot;Pusuman zi&quot; (pusuman script), was used to refer to the script that the HuiHui (Muslims) were using.

Muslim Chinese: The term &quot;Chinese Muslim&quot; is sometimes used to refer to Hui people, given that they speak Chinese, in contrast to, e.g., Turkic-speaking Salars. During the Qing dynasty, &quot;Chinese Muslim&quot; (Han Hui) was sometimes used to refer to Hui people, which differentiated them from non-Chinese-speaking Muslims. However, not all Hui are Muslims, nor are all Chinese Muslims, Hui. For example, Li Yong is a famous Han Chinese who practices Islam and Hui Liangyu is a notable atheist Hui. In addition, most Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kirghiz and Dongxiang in China are Muslims, but are not Hui.

John Stuart Thomson, who traveled in China, called them &quot;Mohammedan Chinese&quot;. They have also been called &quot;Chinese Mussulmans&quot;, when Europeans wanted to distinguish them from Han Chinese.

=== Non-Muslim Huis ===
Throughout history, the identity of Hui people has been fluid, often changing as was convenient. Some identified as Hui out of interest in their ancestry or because of government benefits. These Hui are concentrated on the southeast coast of China, especially Fujian province.

Some Hui clans around Quanzhou in Fujian, such as the Ding and Guo families, identify themselves by ethnicity and no longer practice Islam. In recent years, more of these clans have identified as Hui, increasing the official population. They provided evidence of their ancestry and were recognized as Hui. Many clans across Fujian had genealogies that demonstrated Hui ancestry. These clans inhabited Fujian, Taiwan, Singapore, Indonesia and the Philippines. None of these clans were Muslims but they do not offer pork during their ancestral worship.

In Taiwan, the Hui clans who followed Koxinga to Formosa to defeat the Dutch settlers no longer observe Islam and their descendants embrace the Chinese folk religion. The Taiwanese branch of the Guo (Kuo in Taiwan) clan with Hui ancestry does not practice Islam, yet does not offer pork at their ancestral shrines. The Chinese Muslim Association counts these people as Muslims. Also on Taiwan, one branch of the Ding (Ting) clan that descended from Sayyid Ajjal Shams al-Din Omar resides in Taisi Township in Yunlin County. They trace their descent through him via the Quanzhou Ding family of Fujian. While pretending to be Han Chinese in Fujian, they initially practiced Islam when they came to Taiwan 200 years ago, but their descendants have embraced Buddhism or Taoism.

An attempt was made by the Chinese Islamic Society to convert the Fujian Hui of Fujian back to Islam in 1983, by sending four Ningxia imams to Fujian. This futile endeavour ended in 1986, when the final Ningxia imam left. A similar endeavour in Taiwan also failed.

Until 1982, a Han could &quot;become&quot; Hui by converting to Islam. Thereafter, a converted Han counts instead as a &quot;Muslim Han&quot;. Symmetrically, Hui people consider other Hui who do not observe Islamic practices as still Hui, and that their Hui nationality cannot be lost. For both of these reasons, simply calling them &quot;Chinese Muslims&quot; is no longer accurate, strictly speaking, just as with Bosniaks in former Yugoslavia.

== Population ==
The Hui nationality is the most widely distributed ethnic minority in China, and it is also the main ethnic minority in many provinces. There are 10,586,087 Hui people in China (2010 census), accounting for 0.79% of the total population, making them the third largest ethnic group after Han Chinese and Zhuang.

Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region and Gansu Province have a Hui population of more than one million. In Ningxia, 33.95% of the population are of Hui ethnicity. Hui are the major minority in Qinghai (15.62%), Gansu and Shaanxi and is the overall major minority in Henan and Anhui.

==Subgroups==
=== Dungan ===

Dungan (; ) is a term used in Central Asia and in Xinjiang to refer to Chinese-speaking Muslim people. In the censuses of Russia and Central Asian nations, the Hui are distinguished from Chinese, termed Dungans. However, in both China and Central Asia members of this ethnic group call themselves Lao Huihui or Zhongyuanren, rather than Dungan. Zhongyuan 中原, literally means &quot;The Central Plain,&quot; and is the historical name of Shaanxi and Henan provinces. Most Dungans living in Central Asia are descendants of Hui people from Gansu and Shaanxi.

Hui people are referred to by Central Asian Turkic speakers and Tajiks by the ethnonym &quot;Dungan&quot;. Joseph Fletcher cited Turkic and Persian manuscripts related to the preaching of the 17th century Kashgarian Sufi master Muhammad Yūsuf (or, possibly, his son Afaq Khoja) inside the Ming Empire (in today&#x27;s Gansu and/or Qinghai), where the preacher allegedly converted &quot;ulamā-yi Tunganiyyāh&quot; (i.e., &quot;Dungan ulema&quot;) into Sufism.

As early as the 1830s, &quot;Dungan&quot;, in various spellings appeared in both English and German, referring to the Hui people of Xinjiang. For example, James Prinsep in 1835 mentioned Muslim &quot;Túngánis&quot; in &quot;Chinese Tartary&quot;. The word (mostly in the form &quot;Dungani&quot; or &quot;Tungani&quot;, sometimes &quot;Dungens&quot; or &quot;Dungans&quot;) acquired currency in English and other western languages when books in the 1860–70s discussed the Dungan Revolt.

Later authors continued to use variants of the term for Xinjiang Hui people. For example, Owen Lattimore, writing ca. 1940, maintained the terminological distinction between these two related groups: the Donggan or &quot;Tungkan&quot; (the older Wade-Giles spelling for &quot;Dungan&quot;), described by him as the descendants of the Gansu Hui people resettled in Xinjiang in the 17–18th centuries, vs. e.g. the &quot;Gansu Moslems&quot; or generic &quot;Chinese Moslems&quot;.

The name &quot;Dungan&quot; sometimes referred to all Muslims coming from China proper, such as Dongxiang and Salar in addition to Hui. Reportedly, the Hui disliked the term Dungan, calling themselves either Huihui or Huizi.

In the Soviet Union and its successor countries, the term &quot;Dungans&quot; (дунгане) became the standard name for the descendants of Chinese-speaking Muslims who emigrated in the 1870s and 1880s to the Russian Empire, mostly to today&#x27;s Kyrgyzstan and south-eastern Kazakhstan.

=== Panthay ===
The Panthay are a group of Chinese Muslims in Myanmar (Burma) and Yunnan Province. In Thailand, Chinese Muslims are referred to as Chin Ho ().

=== Utsul ===
The Utsuls of Hainan are a Chamic-speaking ethnic group which lives southernmost tip of the island near the city of Sanya. They are thought to be descendants of Cham refugees who fled their homeland of Champa in what is now modern Central Vietnam to escape the Vietnamese invasion. Although they are culturally, ethnically and linguistically distinct from the Hui, the Chinese government nevertheless classifies them as Hui due to their Islamic faith.

== History ==
=== Origins ===

Many Hui are direct descendants of Silk Road travelers. On the southeast coast (e.g., Guangdong, Fujian) and in major trade centers elsewhere in China, some are of mixed local and foreign descent. The foreign element, although greatly diluted, came primarily from Iranian (&quot;Bosi&quot;) traders, who brought Islam to China. These foreigners settled and gradually intermarried, while assimilating into Chinese culture.

Early European explorers speculated that T&#x27;ung-kan (Dungans, i.e. Hui, called &quot;Chinese Mohammedans&quot;) in Xinjiang, originated from Khorezmians who were transported to China by the Mongols, and descended from a mixture of Chinese, Iranian and Turkic peoples. They also reported that the T&#x27;ung-kan were Shafi&#x27;ites, as were the Khorezmians.

The Hui people of Yunnan and Northwestern China resulted from the convergence of Mongol, Turkic, and Iranian peoples or other Central Asian settlers recruited by the Yuan dynasty, either as artisans or as officials (the &quot;semu&quot;). The Hui formed the second-highest stratum in the Yuan ethnic hierarchy (after the Mongols but above Chinese). A proportion of the ancestral nomad or military ethnic groups were originally Nestorian Christians, many of whom later converted to Islam under the Ming and Qing dynasties.

However, Hui peoples from Gansu, along with their Dongxian neighbors, did not receive substantial gene flow from Western and Central Asia or European populations during their Islamization.

==== Sects of Islam ====

Most Hui people are Sunni Muslims, and their Islamic sects can be divided into:

* Gedimu (Old Sect): This is the oldest and most widely followed sect in China. Members typically do not actively proselytise. It is divided into four main Sufi orders, each with its own hereditary leader. Each order has &quot;gongbei&quot;, which serve as the tombs of its leader.
** Jahriyya (also known as the Loud Chanting Sect)
** Khufiyya (also known as the Quiet Chanting Sect)
** Qadiriyya (meaning “The Great One”)
** Kubrawiyya (meaning “The Magnificent One”)
* Yihewani (New Sect): This sect focuses exclusively on the Quran, without establishing any Sufi order, &quot;gongbei&quot;, or hereditary leadership.
* Salafi (New New Sect): Influenced by Wahhabi thought, this sect aims to reform the New Sect and advocates for a return to the purity and spirituality of early Islam.
* Xidaotang (Chinese Learning Sect): This sect, founded on the Chinese translations of Islamic texts by scholars like Liu Zhi, has a centralised religious authority. Its leader serves for life but does not pass down the position hereditarily.

Ma Tong recorded that the 6,781,500 Sunni Hui in China followed 58.2% Gedimu, 21% Yihewani, 10.9% Jahriyya, 7.2% Khuffiya, 1.4% Qadariyya, and 0.7% Kubrawiyya Sufi schools.

Among the northern Hui, Central Asian Sufi schools such as Kubrawiyya, Qadiriyya, and Naqshbandiyya (Khufiyya and Jahriyya) were strong influences, mostly of the Hanafi Madhhab. Hui Muslims have a long tradition of synthesizing Confucian teachings with Qur&#x27;anic teachings and reportedly have contributed to Confucianism from the Tang period on. Before the &quot;Yihewani&quot; movement, a Chinese Muslim sect inspired by the Middle Eastern reform movement, northern Hui Sufis blended Taoist teachings and martial arts practices with Sufi philosophy.

==== Kaifeng Jews ====

Many Jews in China, for example the Kaifeng Jews, and in particular the Jewish Zhang family Zhang of Kaifeng at the start of the 20th century, converted to Islam and became Hui people.

==== Converted Han ====
According to legend, a Muhuyindeni person converted an entire village of Han with the surname Zhang to Islam. Hui also adopted Han children and raised them as Hui. Hui in Gansu with the surnames Tang (唐) and Wang (汪) descended from Han Chinese who converted to Islam and married Muslim Hui or Dongxiangs, joining the Hui and Dongxiang ethnic groups, both Muslim. Tangwangchuan and Hanjiaji were notable as towns with a multi-ethnic community, with both non-Muslims and Muslims.

Kuomintang official Ma Hetian visited Tangwangchuan and met an &quot;elderly local literatus from the Tang clan&quot; while he was on his inspection tour of Gansu and Qinghai.
In Gansu province in the 1800s, a Muslim Hui woman married into the Han Chinese Kong lineage of Dachuan District, which was descended from Confucius. The Han Chinese groom and his family converted to Islam after the marriage. In 1715 in Yunnan province, a few Han Chinese descendants of Confucius also surnamed Kong married Hui women and converted to Islam. 
Around 1376 the 30-year-old Chinese merchant Lin Nu visited Ormuz in Persia, converted to Islam, and married a Semu girl (&quot;&quot;) (either Persian or Arab) and brought her back to Quanzhou in Fujian. The Confucian philosopher Li Zhi was their descendant.

=== Modern period ===
During China&#x27;s land reform movement (which began after the defeat of the Japanese in the Second Sino-Japanese War and continued in the early years of the People&#x27;s Republic of China), the Communist Party encouraged rural women in achieving a &quot;double fanshen&quot;—a revolutionary transformation as both a peasant and a feminist awakening as a woman. The progress of Hui women was promoted as by the party as an example of such a success. Through the rural movement, Hui women were said to have not just received land, but also &quot;freedom over their own bodies.&quot; Hui women embraced political participation and the rural revolution. The land reform movement succeeded among Hui people because activists first won over elder generations.

The Cultural Revolution wreaked much havoc on all cultures and ethnicities in China. The quelling of Hui militant rebels at the hands of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army in Yunnan, known as the Shadian incident, reportedly claimed over 1,600 lives in 1975.

=== Current situation ===

Different Muslim ethnic groups in different regions are treated differently by the Chinese government in regards to religious freedom. A greater freedom is permitted for Hui Muslims, who can practice their religion, build mosques, and have their children attend mosques, while more controls are placed specifically on Uyghurs in Xinjiang. Since the 1980s, Islamic private schools have been supported and permitted by the Chinese government in Muslim areas, except for Xinjiang due to the separatist sentiment there. Although religious education for children is officially forbidden by law in China, the CCP allows Hui Muslims to have their children educated in the religion and attend mosques, while the law is enforced on Uyghurs. After secondary education is completed, China then allows Hui students who would like to, embark on religious studies under an imam. China does not enforce the law against children attending mosques on non-Uyghurs in areas outside of Xinjiang.

Hui religious schools are also allowed to establish a large autonomous network of mosques and schools run by a Hui Sufi leader, which was formed with the approval of the Chinese government even though he admitted to attending an event where Osama Bin Laden spoke.

Hui Muslims who are employed by the state are allowed to fast during Ramadan, unlike Uyghurs in the same positions. The number of Hui going on Hajj is expanding, while Uyghurs find it difficult to get passports to go on Hajj. Hui women are allowed to wear veils, while Uyghur women are discouraged from wearing them. Many Hui women wear veils and headscarves. There is a major halal industry and Islamic clothing industry to manufacture Muslim attire such as skull caps, veils, and headscarves in the Hui region of Ningxia.

China banned a book entitled &quot;Xing Fengsu&quot; (&quot;Sexual Customs&quot;) which insulted Islam and placed its authors under arrest in 1989 after protests in Lanzhou and Beijing by Chinese Hui Muslims. During the protests, the Chinese police provided protection to the Hui Muslim protestors, and the Chinese government organized public burnings of the book. The Chinese government assisted them and gave into their demands because Hui do not have a separatist movement, unlike the Uyghurs.

In 2007, anticipating the coming &quot;Year of the Pig&quot; in the Chinese calendar, depictions of pigs were banned from CCTV &quot;to show respect to Islam, and upon guidance from higher levels of the government&quot;.

====Allegation of repression====
Hui Muslims have been alleged to have experienced greater repression of religious activities in recent years. In 2018, paramount leader Xi Jinping issued a directive aimed at the sinicization of Chinese Muslims. Since then, the government has been accused of repressing aspects of Hui culture deemed &quot;Arab&quot;. Most of these repressions have been limited to the removal of aesthetically Islamic buildings and symbols, with the government renovating architecture to appear more Chinese and banning Arabic signs in Hui regions. More drastic repressions have been taken, such as closing mosques or removing licenses from imams who have traveled outside of China. In order to sinicize the Hui, schools and mosques in Ningxia have been changed to include traits from traditional Han architecture.

At least two Hui Muslims have allegedly been included in reeducation camps, termed &quot;Vocational Education and Training Centers&quot; which the Chinese government claims are aimed at reforming the political thought of detainees, including extremist religious beliefs and separatist or terrorist sympathies. One or more of the Hui within these camps may have faced torture, and are allegedly grouped in different cells from Kazakhs and Uighurs, and on rare occasion die from stress.

====Tensions between Hui and Uyghurs====

Tensions between Hui Muslims and Uyghurs have arisen because Hui troops and officials often dominated the Uyghurs and crushed Uyghur revolts. Xinjiang&#x27;s Hui population increased by more than 520 percent between 1940 and 1982, an average annual growth of 4.4 percent, while the Uyghur population only grew at 1.7 percent. This dramatic increase in Hui population led inevitably to significant tensions between the Hui and Uyghur populations. Many Hui Muslim civilians were killed by Uyghur rebel troops in the Kizil massacre of 1933. Some Uyghurs in Kashgar remember that the Hui army at the Battle of Kashgar (1934) massacred 2,000 to 8,000 Uyghurs, which causes tension as more Hui moved into Kashgar from other parts of China. Some Hui criticize Uyghur separatism and generally do not want to get involved in conflict in other countries. Hui and Uyghur live separately, attending different mosques. During the 2009 rioting in Xinjiang that killed around 200 people, &quot;&quot; is a common cry spread across social media among Uyghur extremists.

The Uyghur militant organization East Turkestan Islamic Movement&#x27;s magazine &quot;Islamic Turkistan&quot; has accused the Chinese &quot;Muslim Brotherhood&quot; (the Yihewani) of being responsible for the moderation of Hui Muslims and the lack of Hui joining militant jihadist groups in addition to blaming other things for the lack of Hui Jihadists, such as the fact that for more than 300 years Hui and Uyghurs have been enemies of each other, no separatist Islamist organizations among the Hui, the fact that the Hui view China as their home, and the fact that the &quot;infidel Chinese&quot; language is the language of the Hui.

Even among Hui Salafis (Sailaifengye) and Uyghur Salafis, there is little coordination or cooperation and the two have totally different political agendas, with the Hui Salafists content to carry out their own teachings and remain politically neutral.

Hui Muslim drug dealers are accused by Uyghur Muslims of pushing heroin onto Uyghurs. There is a typecast image in the public eye of Hui being heroin dealers.

====Tibetan-Muslim sectarian violence====

In Tibet, the majority of Muslims are Hui people. Antagonism between Tibetans and Muslims stems from events during the Muslim warlord Ma Bufang&#x27;s rule such as the Ngolok rebellions (1917–49) and the Sino-Tibetan War, but such hostility was suppressed after the annexation of Tibet by the People&#x27;s Republic of China. However, renewed Tibetan-Muslim violence broke out in the wake of the gradual liberalization of China, that resulted in increased movement of people, such as Han and Hui Chinese, into Tibetan areas. Muslim restaurants were attacked, and apartments and shops of Muslims were set on fire in the riot in mid-March 2008, resulting in death and injury. Tibetans also boycotted Muslim owned businesses. In August 2008, the main mosque in Lhasa was burned down by Tibetans during the 2008 Tibetan unrest. Some Muslims avoided overt display of religious identity in the wake of the violence. Many Hui Muslims also supported the repression of Tibetan separatism by the Chinese government, complicating their relationship. Problems also exist between Chinese-speaking Hui and Tibetan Hui (the Tibetan-speaking Kache minority of Muslims).

==== Sectarian conflict ====
There have been many occurrences of violent sectarian fighting between different Hui sects, mostly dating from the Qing dynasty. Sectarian fighting between Hui sects led to the Jahriyya rebellion in the 1780s and the 1895 revolt. After a hiatus after the People&#x27;s Republic of China came to power, sectarian infighting resumed in the 1990s in Ningxia between different sects. In recent years, the Salafi movement in China has increased rapidly among Hui population with more mosques occupied under Salafis in China. Several sects refuse to intermarry with each other. One Sufi sect circulated an anti-Salafi pamphlet in Arabic.

A small but growing number of Huis who supported or even joined the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Chinese officials were believed to have ignored growing Hui Sufis&#x27; resentment against growing Salafi movement until recently. ISIL had released a music video called &quot;I am a mujahid&quot; (我們是Mujahid) in Mandarin to reportedly attract Hui Muslims into joining the organization.

== Relations with other religions ==
Some Hui believed that Islam was the true religion through which Confucianism could be practiced, superior to &quot;barbarian&quot; religions, and accused Buddhists and Daoists of &quot;heresy&quot;, like most other Confucian scholars. Among the many Muslims in pre-Chinese Lhasa, the Kokonor Hui community was permitted to maintain the abattoirs outside the confines of the girdling pilgrims&#x27; circuit of the city.

Muslim general Ma Bufang allowed polytheists to openly worship and Christian missionaries to station themselves in Qinghai. Ma and other high-ranking Muslim generals attended the Kokonuur Lake ceremony where the God of the Lake was worshipped, and during the ritual, the Chinese national anthem was sung, participants bowed to a portrait of Kuomintang party founder Sun Yat-sen, and to the God of the Lake. Offerings were given to Sun by the participants, including Muslims. Ma Bufang invited Kazakh Muslims to attend the ceremony. Ma Bufang received audiences of Christian missionaries, who sometimes preached the Gospel. His son Ma Jiyuan received a silver cup from the missionaries.

The Muslim Ma Zhu wrote &quot;Chinese religions are different from Islam, but the ideas are the same.&quot;

During the Panthay Rebellion, the Muslim leader Du Wenxiu said to a Catholic priest: &quot;I have read your religious works and I have found nothing inappropriate. Muslims and Christians are brothers.&quot;

== Culture ==

===Sects===
===Mosques===
The style of architecture of Hui mosques varies according to their sect. The traditionalist Gedimu Hanafi Sunnis, influenced by Chinese culture, build mosques which look like Chinese temples. The reformist modernist Yihewani, originally inspired by Salafism, build their mosques in a middle-eastern style.

=== Foot binding ===

Hui women once practiced foot binding, at the time a common practice across China. It was particularly prevalent in Gansu. The Dungan people, descendants of Hui from northwestern China who fled to Central Asia, also practised foot binding until 1948. However, in southern China, in Canton, James Legge encountered a mosque that had a placard denouncing footbinding, saying Islam did not allow it, since it violated God&#x27;s creation.

===Cultural practices===

French army Commandant Viscount D&#x27;Ollone reported in 1910 that Sichuanese Hui did not strictly enforce the Islamic practices of teetotaling, ritual washing and Friday prayers. Chinese practices like incense burning at ancestral tablets and honoring Confucius were adopted. One practice that was stringently observed was the ban on pork consumption.

The Sunni Gedimu and the Yihewani burned incense during worship. This was viewed as Daoist or Buddhist influence. The Hui were also known as the &quot;white capped&quot;. Hui used incense during worship, while the Salar, also known as &quot;black capped&quot; Hui considered this to be a heathen ritual and denounced it.

In Yunnan province, during the Qing dynasty, tablets that wished the Emperor a long life were placed at mosque entrances. No minarets were available and no chanting accompanied the call to prayer. The mosques were similar to Buddhist temples, and incense was burned inside.

Hui enlisted in the military and were praised for their martial skills.

Circumcision in Islam is known as &quot;khitan&quot;. Islamic scholars agree that it is required (mandatory), or recommended. However, circumcision is not universally practiced among the Hui. In the regions where it is undertaken, Hui tradition is that the maternal uncle (&quot;Jiujiu&quot;) play an important role by the circumcision and wedding of his nephew.

=== Names ===

The long history of Hui residence and mixing in China has led the Hui to adopt names typical of their Han neighbors; however, some common Hui names are actually Chinese renderings of common Muslim (i.e. Arabic) and Persian names. For instance, surname &quot;Ma&quot; for &quot;Muhammad&quot;.

Hui people usually have a Chinese name and a Muslim name in Arabic, although the Chinese name is used primarily. Some Hui do not remember their Muslim names.

Hui people who adopt foreign names may not use their Muslim names. An example of this is Pai Hsien-yung, a Hui author in America, who adopted the name Kenneth. His father was Muslim general Bai Chongxi, who had his children adopt western names.

==== Surnames ====

Hui people commonly believe that their surnames originated as &quot;Sinified&quot; forms of their foreign Muslim ancestors some time during the Yuan or Ming eras. Common Hui surnames:

A Ningxia legend states that four common Hui surnames—Na, Su, La, and Ding—originate with the descendants of Nasruddin, a son of Sayyid Ajjal Shams al-Din Omar, who &quot;divided&quot; the ancestor&#x27;s name (&quot;Nasulading&quot;, in Chinese) among themselves.

=== Literature ===

The Han Kitab is a collection of Islamic and Confucian texts written by various Hui authors in the 18th century, including Liu Zhi. New works were written by Hui intellectuals following education reform by Ma Clique warlords and Bai Chongxi. Some texts were translated from Arabic.

A new edition of a book by Ma Te-hsin, called &quot;Ho-yin Ma Fu-ch&#x27;u hsien-sheng i-shu Ta hua tsung kuei Ssu tien yaohui&quot;, first printed in 1865, was reprinted in 1927 by Ma Fuxiang. General Ma Fuxiang invested in new editions of Confucian and Islamic texts. He edited &quot;Shuofang Daozhi&quot;, a gazette and books such as Meng Cang ZhuangKuang: Hui Bu Xinjiang fu.

=== Language ===

The Hui of Yunnan, whom the Burmese called Panthays, were reportedly fluent in Arabic. During the Panthay Rebellion, Arabic replaced Chinese as the official language of the rebel kingdom.

Published in 1844, &quot;The Chinese repository, Volume 13&quot; includes an account of an Englishman who stayed in the Chinese city of Ningbo, where he visited the local mosque. The Hui running the mosque was from Shandong and descended from residents of the Arabian city of Medina. He was able to read and speak Arabic with ease, but was illiterate in Chinese, although he was born in China and spoke Chinese.

=== Marriage ===

Hui marriages resemble typical Chinese marriages except that traditional Chinese rituals are not used. Endogamy is practiced by Hui, who mainly marry amongst themselves rather than with Muslims from other sects. However, the Hui Na family in Ningxia is known to practice both parallel and cross cousin marriage. The Najiahu village in Ningxia is named after this family, descended from Sayyid Ajjal Shams al-Din Omar.

==== Outside marriage ====

Intermarriage generally involves a Han Chinese converting to Islam when marrying a Hui, and marriage without conversion only takes place rarely. In Hui discourse, marriage between a Hui woman and a Han man is not allowed unless the Han converts to Islam, although it occurred repeatedly in Eastern China. Generally Han of both sexes have to convert to Islam before marrying. This practice helped increase the population of Hui. A case of switching nationality occurred in 1972 when a Han man married a Hui and was considered a Hui after converting.

&quot;Zhao nuxu&quot; is a practice where the son-in-law moves in with the wife&#x27;s family. Some marriages between Han and Hui are conducted this way. The husband does not need to convert, but the wife&#x27;s family follows Islamic customs. No census data documents this type of marriage, reporting only cases in which the wife moves in with the groom&#x27;s family. In Henan province, a marriage was recorded between a Han boy and Hui girl without the Han converting, during the Ming dynasty. Steles in Han and Hui villages record this story and Hui and Han members of the Lineage celebrate at the ancestral temple together.

In Beijing, Oxen street Gladney found 37 Han–Hui couples; two of which were had Hui wives and the other 35 had Hui husbands. Data was collected in different Beijing districts. In Ma Dian 20% of intermarriages were Hui women marrying into Han families, in Tang Fang 11% of intermarriage were Hui women marrying into Han families. 67.3% of intermarriage in Tang Fang were Han women marrying into a Hui family and in Ma Dian 80% of intermarriage were Han women marrying into Hui families.

Li Nu, the son of Li Lu, from a Han Chinese Li family in Quanzhou visited Hormuz in Persia in 1376. He married a Persian or an Arab girl, and brought her back to Quanzhou. He then converted to Islam. Li Nu was the ancestor of Ming dynasty reformer Li Chih.

In Gansu province in the 1800s, a Muslim Hui woman married into the Han Chinese Kong lineage of Dachuan, which was descended from Confucius. The Han Chinese groom and his family were only converted to Islam after the marriage by their Muslim relatives. In 1715 in Yunnan province, few Han Chinese married Hui women and converted to Islam.

Jiang Xingzhou, a Han bannerman lieutenant from the Bordered Yellow Banner, married a Muslim woman in Mukden during Qianlong&#x27;s late reign. He fled his position due to fear of being punished for being a bannerman marrying a commoner woman. He was sentenced to death for leaving his official post but the sentence was commuted and he was not executed.

In the Dungan Revolt (1895–96) 400 Muslims in Topa did not join the revolt and proclaimed their loyalty to China. An argument between a Han Chinese and his Muslim wife led to these Muslims getting massacred, when she threatened that the Muslims from Topa would attack Tankar and give a signal to their co-religionists to rise up and open the gates by burning the temples atop the hills. The husband reported this to an official and the next day the Muslims were massacred with the exception of a few Muslim girls who were married off to Han Chinese.

In the 21st century, Hui men marrying Han women and Han men who marry Hui women have above average education.

=== Education ===
Hui have supported modern education and reform. Hui such as Hu Songshan and the Ma Clique warlords promoted western, modern secular education. Elite Hui received both Muslim and Confucian education. They studied the Quran and Confucian texts like the Spring and Autumn Annals. Hui people refused to follow the May Fourth Movement. Instead, they taught both western subjects such as science along with traditional Confucian literature and classical Chinese, along with Islamic education and Arabic. Hui warlord Ma Bufang built a girls&#x27; school in Linxia that taught modern secular subjects. Hui have had female imams, called Nu Ahong for centuries. They are the world&#x27;s only female Imams. They guide women in prayer but are not allowed to lead prayers.

=== Military service ===

Muslims have served extensively in the Chinese military for a long time in Chinese history, as both officials and soldiers, often filling the more distinguished military positions. During the Tang dynasty, 3,000 Chinese soldiers and Arab 3,000 Muslim soldiers were traded to each other in an agreement. In 756, 3,000 Arab mercenaries joined the Chinese against the An Lushan rebellion. A mythical Hui legendary folklore account claims 3000 Chinese soldiers were swapped by Guo Ziyi with the Muslims for 300 &quot;Hui&quot; soldiers, and said that only 3 Hui survived the war against An Lushan and populated Ningxia. A massacre of thousands of foreign Arab and Persian Muslim merchants and other foreigners by former Yan rebel general Tian Shengong happened during the An Lushan rebellion in the Yangzhou massacre (760), The rebel Huang Chao&#x27;s army in southern China committed the Guangzhou massacre against over 120,000 to 200,000 foreign Arab and Persian Muslim, Zoroastrian, Jewish and Christian merchants in 878–879 at the seaport and trading entrepot of Guangzhou.

During the Ming dynasty, Hui generals and troops loyal to Ming fought against Mongols and Hui loyal to the Yuan dynasty in the Ming conquest of Yunnan. Hui also fought for the emperor against aboriginal tribes in southern China during the Miao Rebellions. Many Hui soldiers of the Ming dynasty then settled in Yunnan and Hunan provinces.

During the Qing dynasty, Hui troops in the Imperial army helped crush Hui rebels during the Dungan revolt and Panthay Rebellion. The Qing administration in Xinjiang also preferred to use Hui as police. Yang Zengxin, the Han Chinese governor of Xinjiang, extensively relied on Hui generals like Ma Shaowu and Ma Fuxing. Qing Muslim general Zuo Baogui (1837–1894), from Shandong province, was killed in Pingyang in Korea by Japanese cannon fire in 1894 while defending the city, where a memorial to him stands. Hui troops also fought western armies for the first time in the Boxer Rebellion, winning battles including the Battle of Langfang and Battle of Beicang. These troops were the Kansu Braves led by General Dong Fuxiang.

Military service continued into the Republic of China period. After the Kuomintang party took power, Hui participation in the military reached new levels. Qinghai and Ningxia were created out of Gansu province, and the Kuomintang appointed Hui generals as military governors of all three provinces. They became known as the Ma Clique. Many Muslim Salar joined the army in the Republic era; they and Dongxiang who have joined the army are described as being given &quot;eating rations&quot; meaning military service.

The Chinese government appointed Ma Fuxiang as military governor of Suiyuan. Ma Fuxiang commented on the willingness for Hui people to become martyrs in battle (see Martyrdom in Islam), saying:

They have not enjoyed the educational and political privileges of the Han Chinese, and they are in many respects primitive. But they know the meaning of fidelity, and if I say &quot;do this, although it means death,&quot; they cheerfully obey.
Hui generals and soldiers fought for the Republic against Tibet in the Sino-Tibetan War, against Uyghur rebels in the Kumul Rebellion, the Soviet Union in the Soviet Invasion of Xinjiang and against Japan in the Second Sino Japanese War. The Japanese planned to invade Ningxia from Suiyuan in 1939 and create a Hui puppet state. The next year in 1940, the Japanese were defeated militarily by Kuomintang Muslim general Ma Hongbin. Ma Hongbin&#x27;s Hui Muslim troops launched further attacks against Japan in the Battle of West Suiyuan. The Chinese Islamic Association issued &quot;A message to all Muslims in China from the Chinese Islamic Association for National Salvation&quot; in Ramadan of 1940 during the Second Sino-Japanese War.

We have to implement the teaching &quot;the love of the fatherland is an article of faith&quot; by the Prophet Muhammad and to inherit the Hui&#x27;s glorious history in China. In addition, let us reinforce our unity and participate in the twice more difficult task of supporting a defensive war and promoting religion... We hope that ahongs and the elite will initiate a movement of prayer during Ramadan and implement group prayer to support our intimate feeling toward Islam. A sincere unity of Muslims should be developed to contribute power towards the expulsion of Japan.

&quot;Ahong&quot; is the Mandarin Chinese word for &quot;imam&quot;. During the war against Japan, the imams supported Muslim resistance, calling for Muslims to participate in the fight against Japan, claiming that casualties would become shaheeds (martyrs). Ma Zhanshan was a Hui guerilla fighter against the Japanese.

Hui forces were known for their anti-communist sentiment, and fought for the Kuomintang against the CCP in the Chinese Civil War, and against rebels during the Ili Rebellion. Bai Chongxi, a Hui general, was appointed to the post of Minister of National Defence, the highest military position in the Republic of China. After the Communist victory and evacuation of the Kuomintang to Taiwan, Hui people continued to serve in the military of the Republic as opposed to the Communist-led People&#x27;s Republic. Ma Bufang became the ambassador of the Republic of China (Taiwan) to Saudi Arabia. His brother, Ma Buqing, remained a military general on Taiwan. Bai Chongxi and Ma Ching-chiang were other Hui who served in Taiwan as military generals.

The PLA recruited Hui soldiers who formally had served under Ma Bufang, as well as Salafi soldiers, to crush the Tibetan revolt in Amdo during the 1959 Tibetan uprising.

=== Politics ===
The majority of the Hui Muslim Ma Clique Generals were Kuomintang party members and encouraged Chinese nationalism in their provinces. Kuomintang members Ma Qi, Ma Lin (warlord), and Ma Bufang served as military governors of Qinghai, Ma Hongbin served as military governor of Gansu, and Ma Hongkui served as military governor of Ningxia. General Ma Fuxiang was promoted to governor of Anhui and became chairman of Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs. Ma Bufang, Ma Fuxiang, and Bai Chongxi were all members of the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang, which ruled China in a one-party state. Member Bai Chongxi helped build the Taipei Grand Mosque on Taiwan. Many members of the Hui Ma Clique were Kuomintang.

Hui put Kuomintang Blue Sky with a White Sun party symbols on their Halal restaurants and shops. A Christian missionary in 1935 took a picture of a Muslim meat restaurant in Hankou that had Arabic and Chinese lettering indicating that it was Halal (fit for Muslim consumption). It had two Kuomintang party symbols on it.

=== Increasing religiosity in China ===
According to Dru Gladney, professor at Pomona College in California and a leading scholar on the Hui people, Hui Muslims are enjoying a resurgence in religiosity in China, and that the number of practising Muslims among the Hui people, are rising as well as a &quot;dramatic increase&quot; in the number of Hui women wearing the Hijab, and the numbers of Hui going on the Haj. There are also estimated twice as many mosques in China today than there were in 1950, in which majority were built by Hui Muslims.

One of the reasons for the trend in China, is that Hui Muslims play a vital role as being middlemen in trade between the Middle East and China, and the China-Middle East trade has become increasingly important to the country. Consequently, the government has started constructing a $3.7 billion Islamic theme park called &quot;World Muslim City&quot;, in Yinchuan, one of Hui Muslims hubs. Additionally unlike Uyghurs, who faces far more restrictions in religious freedoms, Hui Muslims generally do not seek independence from China and have a cultural affinity to the Han, and are far more assimilated into mainstream Chinese life. &quot;It&#x27;s not an issue of freedom of religion,&quot; says Gladney, &quot;Clearly, there are many avenues of religious expression that are unfettered in China, but when you cross these very often nebulous and shifting boundaries of what the state regards as political, then you&#x27;re in dangerous territory. Obviously this is what we see in Xinjiang and in Tibet&quot;.

== Outside mainland China ==

In Southeast Asia, presence of Hui Muslims may date back 700 years to the time of Zheng He, who was a Hui. Hui people also joined the wave of Chinese migrants that peaked between 1875 and 1912. They inhabited Penang, Sabah, Singapore and Pangkor prior to World War II. Most were Hokkien-speaking coolies and merchants from Fujian. The colonial British welfare system was commissioned according to language groups, so the Hui were classed as Hokkien. A small number of Hui may have become assimilated into mainstream Chinese society and local Muslim populations. In 1975, five Hui leaders started a campaign to get every clansman to put up a notice listing their ancestors for 40 generations, as a way of reminding them of their origins. The exact Hui population is unclear today as many families left Islam before independence. In 2000 official census figures gave the number of Muslim Chinese in Malaysia as 57,000 but most were Han converts. According to the Malaysian Chinese Muslim Association, the surnames Koay, Ma, Ha, Ta, Sha, Woon, and An (or Ang) may indicate Hui ancestry.

Saudi Arabia was settled by hundreds of Hui Muslim soldiers under Ma Chengxiang after 1949. The Hui General Ma Bufang settled permanently in Mecca in 1961. For a while Cairo was the dwelling place of Ma Bukang and Ma Bufang in between the time they were in Saudi Arabia. The death of Ma Jiyuan in Jeddah on 27 February 2012 was greeted with sorrow by the Chinese consulate.

The Panthays in Myanmar and some of the Chin Haw in Thailand are Hui Muslims, while Hui in Central Asia and Russia are called Dungans.

== Ethnic tensions ==
The Dungan and Panthay revolts were set off by racial antagonism and class warfare, rather than religion. During the first Dungan revolt from 1862 to 1877, fighting broke out between Uyghur and Hui groups. In the military, imbalances in promotion and wealth were other motives for holding foreigners in poor regard.

In 1936, after Sheng Shicai expelled 20,000 Kazakhs from Xinjiang to Qinghai, the Hui led by Ma Bufang massacred their fellow Muslims, the Kazakhs, until only 135 remained.

The Hui people have had a long presence in Qinghai and Gansu, or what Tibetans call Amdo, although Tibetans have historically dominated local politics. The situation was reversed in 1931 when the Hui general Ma Bufang inherited the governorship of Qinghai, stacking his government with Hui and Salar and excluding Tibetans. In his power base in Qinghai&#x27;s northeastern Haidong Prefecture, Ma compelled many Tibetans to convert to Islam and acculturate. Tensions also mounted when Hui started migrating into Lhasa in the 1990s. In February 2003, Tibetans rioted against Hui, destroying Hui-owned shops and restaurants. Local Tibetan Buddhist religious leaders led a regional boycott movement that encouraged Tibetans to boycott Hui-owned shops.
Tensions with Uyghurs arose because Qing and Republican Chinese authorities used Hui troops and officials to dominate the Uyghurs and crush Uyghur revolts. Xinjiang&#x27;s Hui population increased by over 520 percent between 1940 and 1982, an average annual growth of 4.4 percent, while the Uyghur population only grew at 1.7 percent. This dramatic increase in Hui population led inevitably to significant tensions between the Hui and Uyghur populations. Many Hui Muslim civilians were killed by Uyghur rebel troops in the Kizil massacre (1933). Some Uyghurs in Kashgar remember that the Hui army at the 1934 Battle of Kashgar massacred 2,000 to 8,000 Uyghurs, which caused tension as more Hui moved into Kashgar from other parts of China. Some Hui criticize Uyghur separatism and generally do not want to get involved in conflict in other countries. Hui and Uyghur live separately, attending different mosques. During the 2009 rioting in Xinjiang that killed around 200 people, &quot;Kill the Han, kill the Hui&quot; was the recurring cry spread across social media among extremist Uyghurs.

<text>Ethnic minorities in China are the non-Han population in the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC).

The PRC officially recognizes 55 ethnic minority groups within China in addition to the Han majority. , the combined population of officially-recognized minority groups comprised 8.89% of the population of Mainland China. In addition to these officially-recognized ethnic minority groups, there are Chinese nationals who privately classify themselves as members of unrecognized ethnic groups, such as the very small Chinese Jewish, Tuvan, and Ili Turk communities, as well as the much larger Oirat and Japanese communities.

In Chinese, &#x27;ethnic minority&#x27; has translated to  (), wherein () means &#x27;nationality&#x27; or &#x27;nation&#x27; (as in ethnic group)—in line with the Soviet concept of ethnicity—and () means &#x27;minority&#x27;. Since the anthropological concept of &quot;ethnicity&quot; does not precisely match the Chinese or Soviet concepts (which are defined and regulated by the state), some scholars use the neologism &quot;zúqún&quot; (, &#x27;ethnic group&#x27;) to unambiguously refer to ethnicity. Including &quot;shaoshu mínzu&quot;, Sun Yat-sen used the term &quot;zhōnghuá mínzú&quot; (, &#x27;Chinese nation&#x27; or &#x27;Chinese nationality&#x27;) to reflect his belief that all of China&#x27;s ethnic groups were parts of a single Chinese nation.

The ethnic minority groups officially recognized by the PRC include those residing within mainland China, as well as Taiwanese indigenous peoples pursuant to its sovereign claim over Taiwan. However, the PRC does not accept the term &quot; people&quot; or its variations, since it might suggest that Han people are not indigenous to Taiwan, or that Taiwan is not historically a part of China. Also, where the Republic of China (ROC) government in Taiwan, as of 2020, officially recognises 16 Taiwanese indigenous tribes, the PRC classifies them all under a single ethnic group, the &quot;Gāoshān&quot; (, &#x27;high mountain&#x27;) minority, out of reluctance to recognize ethnic classifications derived from the work of Japanese anthropologists during the Japanese rule. (Despite the fact that not all Taiwanese indigenous peoples inhabit in the mountains; for example, the Tao People traditionally inhabit the island of Lanyu.) The regional governments of Hong Kong and Macau do not use this ethnic classification system, so figures by the PRC government exclude these two territories.

==History of ethnicity in China==
===Early history===
Throughout much of recorded Chinese history, there was little attempt by Chinese authors to separate the concepts of nationality, culture, and ethnicity. Those outside of the reach of imperial control and dominant patterns of Chinese culture were thought of as separate groups of people regardless of whether they would today be considered as a separate ethnicity. The self-conceptualization of Han largely revolved around this center-periphery cultural divide. Thus, the process of Sinicization throughout history had as much to do with the spreading of imperial rule and culture as it did with actual ethnic migration.

This understanding persisted (with some changes during the Qing dynasty due to the importation of Western ideas) until the Communists seized power in 1949. Their understanding of minorities had been heavily influenced by the policies of the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin and his 1913 pamphlet on the subject—and they also influenced the Communist regimes in the neighbouring countries of Vietnam and Laos—but the Soviet definition of minorities did not cleanly map onto the Chinese people&#x27;s historical definition of minorities. Soviet thinking about minorities was based on the belief that a nation consisted of people who spoke and wrote a common language, people whose culture was historic, and historic territory. Therefore, The people who inhabited each nation had the theoretical right to secede from a proposed federated government. This differed from the previous way of thinking mainly in that instead of defining all those under imperial rule as Chinese, the nation (as defined as a space upon which power is projected) and ethnicity (the identity of the governed) were now separate; being under central rule no longer automatically meant being defined as Chinese. The Soviet model as applied to China gave rise to the autonomous regions in China; these areas were thought to be their own nations that had theoretical autonomy from the central government.

During World War II, the American Asiatic Association published an entry in the 40th volume of their academic journal, &quot;Asia&quot;, concerning the problem of whether Chinese Muslims were Chinese or a separate &#x27;ethnic minority&#x27;, and the factors which led to either classification. It tackled the question of why Muslims who were Chinese were considered a different race from other Chinese, and the separate question of whether all Muslims in China were united into one race. The first problem was posed with a comparison to Chinese Buddhists, who were not considered a separate race. It concluded that the reason Chinese Muslims were considered separate was because of different factors like religion, culture, military feudalism, and that considering them a &quot;racial minority&quot; was wrong. It also came to the conclusion that the Japanese military spokesman was the only person who was propagating the false assertion that Chinese Muslims had &quot;racial unity&quot;, which was disproved by the fact that Muslims in China were composed of multitudes of different races, separate from each other as were the &quot;Germans and English&quot;, such as the Mongol Hui of Hezhou, Salar Hui of Qinghai, and Chan Tou Hui of Turkistan. The Japanese were trying to spread the lie that Chinese Muslims were one race, in order to propagate the claim that they should be separated from China into an &quot;independent political organization.&quot;

===Distinguishing nationalities in the PRC===
Early documents of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC), such as the 1982 constitution, followed the Soviet practice of identifying &#x27;nationalities&#x27; in the sense of ethnic groups (the concept is not to be confused with state citizenship). The Chinese term (), made during the Republican period, translates this Soviet concept. The English translation (common in official documents) of &#x27;nationality&#x27; again follows Soviet practice; in order to avoid confusion, however, alternative phraseology such as &#x27;ethnicity&#x27; or &#x27;ethnic group&#x27; is often used. Since the anthropological concept of &quot;ethnicity&quot; does not precisely match the Chinese or Soviet concepts (which, after all, are defined and regulated by the state), some scholars use the neologism &quot;zuqun&quot; (, &#x27;ethnic group&#x27;) to unambiguously refer to ethnicity.

After 1949, a team of social scientists was assembled to enumerate the various &quot;mínzú&quot;. An immediate difficulty was that identities &quot;on the ground&quot; did not necessarily follow logically from things like shared languages or cultures; two neighboring regions might seem to share a common culture, and yet insist on their distinct identities. Since this would lead to absurd results—every village could hardly send a representative to the National People&#x27;s Congress—the social scientists attempted to construct coherent groupings of minorities using language as the main criterion for differentiation. Thus some villages with very different cultural practices and histories were lumped together under the same ethnonym. For example, the &quot;Zhuang&quot; ethnic group largely served as a catch-all for various hill villages in Guangxi province.

The actual census taking of who was and was not a minority further eroded the neat differentiating lines the social scientists had drawn up. Individual ethnic status was often awarded based on family tree histories. If one had a father (or mother, for ethnic groups that were considered matrilineal) that had a surname considered to belong to a particular ethnic group, then one was awarded the coveted minority status. This had the result that villages that had previously thought of themselves as homogenous and essentially Han were now divided between those with ethnic identity and those without.

The team of social scientists that assembled the list of all the ethnic groups also described what they considered to be the key differentiating attributes between each group, including culture, custom, and language. The center then used this list of attributes to select representatives of each group to perform on television and radio in an attempt to reinforce the government&#x27;s narrative of China as a multi-ethnic state and to prevent the culture of the minority ethnic groups from assimilating by the Han and the rest of the world. However, with the development of modern technology, these attempts brought little effect. In fact, many of those labeled as specific minorities bore no relationship to the music, clothing, and other practices presented with images and representations of &quot;their people&quot; in the media.

Under this process, 39 ethnic groups were recognized by the first national census in 1954. This further increased to 54 by the second national census in 1964, with the Lhoba group added in 1965. The last change was the addition of the Jino people in 1979, bringing the number of recognized ethnic groups to the current 56.

===Reform and opening up===
However, as China opened up and reformed post-1979, many Han acquired enough money to begin to travel. One of the favorite travel experiences of the wealthy was visits to minority areas, to see the exotic rituals of the minority peoples. Responding to this interest, many minority entrepreneurs, despite themselves perhaps never having grown up practicing the dances, rituals, or songs themselves, began to cater to these tourists by performing acts similar to what the older generation or the local residents told. In this way, the groups of people named Zhuang or other named minorities have begun to have more in common with their fellow co-ethnics, as they have adopted similar self-conceptions in response to the economic demand of consumers for their performances.

The categorization of 55 minority groups was a major step forward from denial of the existence of different ethnic groups in China which had been the policy of Sun Yet-Sen&#x27;s Nationalist government that came to power in 1911, which also engaged in the common use of derogatory names to refer to minorities (a practice officially abolished in 1951). However, the Communist Party&#x27;s categorization was also rampantly criticized since it reduced the number of recognized ethnic groups by eightfold, and today the &quot;wei shibie menzu&quot; (literally &#x27;undistinguished ethnic groups&#x27;) total more than 730,000 people. These groups include Geija, Khmu, Kucong, Mang, Deng, Sherpas, Bajia and Youtai (Jewish).

After the breakup of Yugoslavia and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, there was a shift in official conceptions of minorities in China: rather than defining them as &#x27;nationalities&#x27;, they became &#x27;ethnic groups&#x27;. The difference between &#x27;nationality&#x27; and &#x27;ethnicity&#x27;, as Uradyn Erden-Bulag describes it, is that the former treats the minorities of China as societies with &quot;a fully functional division of labor,&quot; history, and territory, whereas the latter treats minorities as a &quot;category&quot; and focuses on their maintenance of boundaries and their self-definition in relation to the majority group. These changes are reflected in uses of the term () and its translations. The official journal &quot;Minzu Tuanjie&quot; changed its English name from &quot;Nationality Unity&quot; to &quot;Ethnic Unity&quot; in 1995. Similarly, the Central University for Nationalities changed its name to Minzu University of China. Scholars began to prefer the term &quot;zuqun&quot; (, &#x27;ethnic group&#x27;) over &quot;minzu&quot;. The Chinese model for identifying and categorizing ethnic minorities established at the founding of the PRC followed the Soviet model, drawing inspiration from Joseph Stalin&#x27;s 1913 &quot;four commons&quot; criteria to identify ethnic groups: &quot;(1) a distinct language; (2) a recognized indigenous homeland or common territory; (3) a common economic life; and (4) a strong sense of identity and distinctive customs, including dress, religion and foods.&quot;

Following the breakup of the Soviet Union intellectuals and policymakers within China began to argue that the designation of minority groups could be a threat to the country. Violence in Xinjiang and Tibet provided evidence for this argument. Beijing University professor Ma Rong argued that the Chinese Communist Party had unwittingly created a &quot;dual structure&quot; of governance in which the representation and identity given to recognized ethnic groups would increase ethnocultural differences and create social conflict. He recommended new policies of ethnic fusion and assimilation. These proposals made by Ma and others were controversial at the time but they would find a place at the heart of the policy of the Xi Jinping administration. Xi has shifted state policy towards assimilation in what he calls the &quot;grand minzu fusion&quot; or &quot;the coalescing of blood and minds.&quot; The CCP under Xi has reacted to violence committed by a number of Uyghurs by the imprisonment of this group in the Xinjiang internment camps.

In 2020 a Han Chinese was named director of the State Ethnic Affairs Commission for the first time since 1954.

==Ethnic groups==

China is officially composed of 56 ethnic groups (55 minorities plus the dominant Han). However, some of the ethnic groups as classified by the PRC government contain, within themselves, diverse groups of people. Various groups of the Miao minority, for example, speak different dialects of the Hmong–Mien languages, Tai–Kadai languages, and Chinese, and practice a variety of different cultural customs. Whereas in many nations a citizen&#x27;s minority status is defined by their self-identification as an ethnic minority, in China minority nationality (&quot;shǎoshù mínzú&quot;) is fixed at birth, a practice that can be traced to the foundation of the PRC, when the Communist Party commissioned studies to categorize and delineate groups based on research teams&#x27; investigation of minorities&#x27; social history, economic life, language and religion in China&#x27;s different regions.

The degree of variation between ethnic groups is not consistent. Many ethnic groups are described as having unique characteristics from other minority groups and from the dominant Han, but there are also some that are very similar to the Han majority group. Most Hui Chinese are indistinguishable from Han Chinese except for the fact that they practice Islam, and most Manchu are considered to be largely assimilated into dominant Han society.

China&#x27;s official 55 minorities are located primarily in the south, west, and north of China. Only Tibet Autonomous Region and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region have a majority population of official minorities, while all other provinces, municipalities and regions of China have a Han majority. In Beijing itself, the Han ethnic composition makes up nearly 96% of the total population, while the ethnic minority total is 4.31%, or a population of 584,692 (as of 2008).

Much of the dialog within China regarding minorities has generally portrayed minorities as being further behind the Han in progress toward modernization and modernity. Minority groups are often portrayed as rustic, wild, and antiquated. As the government often portrays itself as a benefactor of the minorities, those less willing to assimilate (despite the offers of assistance) are portrayed as masculine, violent, and unreasonable. Groups that have been depicted this way include the Tibetans, Uyghurs and the Mongols. Groups that have been more willing to assimilate (and accept the help of the government) are often portrayed as feminine and sexual, including the Miao, Tujia and the Dai.

===Demographics===
The largest ethnic group, Han, according to a 2005 sampling, constitute about 91.9% of the total population. The next largest ethnic groups in terms of population include the Zhuang (18 million), Manchu (10 million), Hui (10 million), Miao (9 million), Uyghur (8 million), Yi (7.8 million), Tujia (8 million), Mongols (5.8 million), Tibetans (5.4 million), Buyei (3 million), Yao (3.1 million), and Koreans (2.5 million). Minority populations have grown fast due to them being unaffected by the One Child Policy.

===Undistinguished ethnic groups===
&quot;Undistinguished&quot; ethnic groups are ethnic groups that have not been officially recognized or classified by the central government. The group numbers more than 730,000 people, and would constitute the twentieth most populous ethnic group of China if taken as a single group. The vast majority of this group is found in Guizhou Province.

These &quot;undistinguished ethnic groups&quot; do not include groups that have been controversially classified into existing groups. For example, the Mosuo are officially classified as Naxi, and the Chuanqing are classified as Han Chinese, but they reject these classifications and view themselves as separate ethnic groups.

Citizens of mainland China who are of foreign origin are classified using yet another separate label: &quot;foreigners naturalized into the Chinese citizenship&quot; (). However, if a newly naturalized citizen already belongs to a recognized existing group among the 56 ethnic groups, then he or she is classified into that ethnic group rather than the special label.

==Guarantee of rights and interests==

The PRC&#x27;s Constitution and laws guarantee equal rights to all ethnic groups in China and help promote ethnic minority groups&#x27; economic and cultural development. The constitution prohibits both discrimination and acts of disunity. Articles 115 and 116 of the constitution state that in the provincial level autonomous regions and the autonomous prefectures and counties set aside for minority administration, local states via the local people&#x27;s congresses &quot;have the power to enact regulations on the exercise of autonomy and other separate regulations in the light of the political, economic, and cultural characteristics&quot; of those areas.

One notable preferential treatment ethnic minorities enjoy was their exemption from the population growth control of the One-Child Policy. But according to an investigative report by The Associated Press published at 28 June 2020, the Chinese government is taking draconian measures to slash birth rates among Uighurs and other minorities as part of a sweeping campaign to curb its Muslim population, even as it encourages some of the country&#x27;s Han majority to have more children.
While individual women have spoken out before about forced birth control, the practice is far more widespread and systematic than previously known, according to an AP investigation based on government statistics, state documents and interviews with 30 ex-detainees, family members and a former detention camp instructor. The campaign over the past four years in the far west region of Xinjiang is leading to what some experts are calling a form of &quot;demographic genocide&quot;. Ethnic minorities enjoy other special exemptions which vary by province- these include lower tax thresholds and lower required scores for entry into university. The use of these measures to raise ethnic minorities&#x27; human capital is seen by the central government as important for improving the economic development of ethnic minorities. Ethnic minorities are represented in the National People&#x27;s Congress as well as governments at the provincial and prefectural levels. Some ethnic minorities in China live in what are described as ethnic autonomous areas. These &quot;regional autonomies&quot; guarantee ethnic minorities the freedom to use and develop their ethnic languages, and to maintain their own cultural and social customs. In addition, the PRC government has provided preferential economic development and aid to areas where ethnic minorities live. Furthermore, the Chinese government has allowed and encouraged the involvement of ethnic minority participation in the party. Even though ethnic minorities in China are granted specific rights and freedoms, many ethnic minorities still have headed towards the urban life in order to obtain a well paid job.

Minorities have widely benefited from China&#x27;s minimum livelihood guarantee program (known as the &quot;dibao&quot;) a programme introduced nationwide in 1999 whose number of participants had reached nearly twenty million by 2012. The nature of the selection process entails that the programme&#x27;s providers be proactive and willing in seeking out impoverished prospective participants, as opposed to more comprehensive welfare schemes such as the Urban Resident Basic Medical Insurance Scheme (URBMI), which is universally implemented. As such, the selection process for participants in the &quot;dibao&quot; programme has generated a perception among observers of the scheme that this programme have been used to mitigate dissent and neutralize any threat to the government that could lead to unrest- including negative performance evaluations of local officials.

The Chinese government has committed a series of ongoing human rights abuses against Uyghurs and other ethnic and religious minorities in Xinjiang.

==Religions and their most common affiliations==
* Buddhism/Taoism — the Miao (minority), Lisu (minority), Bai, Bulang, Dai, Jinuo, Jing, Jingpo, Mongol, Manchu, Naxi (including Mosuo), Nu, Tai, Tibetan, Zhuang (minority), Yi (minority), and Yugur (&quot;Yellow Uyghurs&quot;).
*Eastern Orthodox Christianity — the Russians
*Islam — the Hui, Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Dongxiang people, Kyrgyz people, Salar, Tajiks, Uzbeks, Bonans, and Tatars.
* Judaism — Kaifeng Jews
*Protestant Christianity — the Lisu (70%; see Lisu Church)
* Shamanism/Animism — Daur, Ewenkis, Oroqen, Hezhen, and Derung.

== Ethnic Minority Representation in the leadership of the CCP ==
Since the People&#x27;s Republic of China was established, ethnic minorities have made up around 10% of the Central Committee, whereas the rest of the members are of the Han Chinese ethnic group. That being said, a majority of the ethnic minority members of the Central Committee are alternate members. In the 19th Congress there are only 16 full time members who are ethnic minorities. While only 6 of the 55 ethnic minorities are represented in the Central Committee, the percentage of ethnic minority members in the Central Committee exceeds the percentage of ethnic minority population in China. Ethnic minorities only make up roughly 7.5% of China&#x27;s population, whereas 92% are Han Chinese, the dominant ethnicity. Still the majority of ethnic minorities are severely underrepresented in the Central Committee. 

A study conducted by three scholars in 2012, &quot;Getting Ahead in the Communist Party: Explaining the Advancement of Central Committee Members&quot;, found that ethnic minorities had an advantage when being considered for promotion in Congress. They explain this phenomenon through the United Front policies that China has been engaged with since the Reform Era. These policies attempt to promote stability and legitimacy among the ethnic minority population through concerted efforts to involve them in the country&#x27;s politics . Thus the authors argue this is why ethnic minorities enjoyed an advantage in the Reform Period. Other scholars add that the Party is eager to include ethnic minorities in the government because of the backlash that China has faced from the rest of the world concerning the way they treated Tibet and most recently the Uyghurs in Xinjiang. Including ethnic minorities in the Party&#x27;s leadership adds to the &quot;United Front&quot; that China wants to portray. Though they are included, it remains unclear as to what amount of influence they assert.

<text>Sitting Bull ( ; December 15, 1890) was a Hunkpapa Lakota leader who led his people during years of resistance against United States government policies. Sitting Bull was killed by Indian agency police accompanied by U.S. officers and supported by U.S. troops on the Standing Rock Indian Reservation during an attempt to arrest him at a time when authorities feared that he would join the Ghost Dance movement.

Before the Battle of the Little Bighorn, Sitting Bull had a vision in which he saw many soldiers, &quot;as thick as grasshoppers&quot;, falling upside down into the Lakota camp, which his people took as a foreshadowing of a major victory in which many soldiers would be killed. About three weeks later, the confederated Lakota tribes with the Northern Cheyenne defeated the 7th Cavalry under Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer on June 25, 1876, annihilating Custer&#x27;s battalion and seeming to fulfill Sitting Bull&#x27;s prophetic vision. Sitting Bull&#x27;s leadership inspired his people to a major victory. In response, the U.S. government sent thousands more soldiers to the area, forcing many of the Lakota to surrender over the next year. Sitting Bull refused to surrender, and in May 1877, he led his band north to Wood Mountain, North-West Territories (now Saskatchewan). He remained there until 1881, when he and most of his band returned to U.S. territory and surrendered to U.S. forces.

After working as a performer with &quot;Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West&quot; show, Sitting Bull returned to the Standing Rock Agency in South Dakota. Because of fears that Sitting Bull would use his influence to support the Ghost Dance movement, Indian Service agent James McLaughlin at Fort Yates ordered his arrest. During an ensuing struggle between Sitting Bull&#x27;s followers and the agency police, Sitting Bull was shot in the chest and head by Standing Rock policemen Lieutenant Bull Head (&quot;Tatankapah&quot;, ) and Red Tomahawk (&quot;Marcelus Chankpidutah&quot;, ), after the police were fired upon by Sitting Bull&#x27;s supporters. His body was taken to nearby Fort Yates for burial. In 1953, his Lakota family exhumed what were believed to be his remains, reburying them near Mobridge, South Dakota, near his birthplace.

==Early life==
Sitting Bull was born on land later included in the Dakota Territory sometime between 1831 and 1837. In 2007, Sitting Bull&#x27;s great-grandson asserted from family oral tradition that Sitting Bull was born along the Yellowstone River, south of present-day Miles City, Montana. He was named Ȟoká Psíče (Jumping Badger) at birth, and nicknamed &quot;Húŋkešni&quot; or &quot;Slow&quot;, an allusion to his careful and unhurried nature.

When Sitting Bull was 14 years old, he accompanied a group of Lakota warriors, which included his father and his uncle Four Horns, in a raiding party to take horses from a camp of Crow warriors. He displayed bravery by riding forward and counting coup on one of the surprised Crow, which was witnessed by the other mounted Lakota. Upon returning to camp, his father gave a celebratory feast at which he conferred his own name upon his son. The name, Tȟatȟáŋka Íyotake, in the Lakota language, roughly translates to &quot;Buffalo Bull Who Sits Down&quot;, but Americans commonly refer to him as &quot;Sitting Bull&quot;. Thereafter, Sitting Bull&#x27;s father was known as Jumping Bull. At this ceremony before the entire band, Sitting Bull&#x27;s father presented his son with an eagle feather to wear in his hair, a warrior&#x27;s horse, and a hardened buffalo hide shield to mark his son&#x27;s passage into manhood as a Lakota warrior.

During the Dakota War of 1862, in which Sitting Bull&#x27;s people were not involved, several bands of eastern Dakota people killed an estimated 300 to 800 settlers and soldiers in south-central Minnesota in response to poor treatment by the government and in an effort to drive the whites away. Despite being embroiled in the American Civil War, the United States Army retaliated in 1863 and 1864, even against bands that had not been involved in the hostilities. In 1864, two brigades of about 2200 soldiers under Brigadier General Alfred Sully attacked a village. The defenders were led by Sitting Bull, Gall and Inkpaduta. The Lakota and Dakota were driven out, but skirmishing continued into August at the Battle of the Badlands.

In September, Sitting Bull and about one hundred Hunkpapa Lakota encountered a small party near what is now Marmarth, North Dakota. They had been left behind by a wagon train commanded by Captain James L. Fisk to effect some repairs to an overturned wagon. When he led an attack, Sitting Bull was shot in the left hip by a soldier. The bullet exited through the small of his back, and the wound was not serious.

==Red Cloud&#x27;s War==

From 1866 to 1868, Red Cloud, a leader of the Oglala Lakota, fought against U.S. forces, attacking their forts in an effort to keep control of the Powder River Country in present-day Montana. In support of Red Cloud, Sitting Bull led numerous war parties against Fort Berthold, Fort Stevenson, and Fort Buford and their allies from 1865 through 1868. The uprising has come to be known as Red Cloud&#x27;s War.

By early 1868, the U.S. government desired a peaceful settlement to the conflict. It agreed to Red Cloud&#x27;s demands that the U.S. abandon Forts Phil Kearny and C.F. Smith. Gall of the Hunkpapa and other representatives of the Hunkpapa, Blackfeet and Yankton Dakota, signed a form of the Treaty of Fort Laramie on July 2, 1868, at Fort Rice (near Bismarck, North Dakota). Sitting Bull did not agree to the treaty. He told the Jesuit missionary Pierre Jean De Smet, who sought him on behalf of the government: &quot;I wish all to know that I do not propose to sell any part of my country.&quot; He continued his hit-and-run attacks on forts in the upper Missouri area throughout the late 1860s and early 1870s.

The events between 1866 and 1868 mark a historically debated period of Sitting Bull&#x27;s life. According to historian Stanley Vestal, who conducted interviews with surviving Hunkpapa in 1930, Sitting Bull was made &quot;Supreme Chief of the whole Sioux Nation&quot; at this time, but historians and ethnologists later refuted this, since Lakota society was highly decentralized. Lakota bands and their elders made individual decisions, including whether or not to wage war.

==Great Sioux War of 1876==

Sitting Bull&#x27;s band of Hunkpapa continued to attack migrating parties and forts in the late 1860s. In 1871, the Northern Pacific Railway conducted a survey for a route across the northern plains directly through Hunkpapa lands, it encountered stiff Lakota resistance. The same railway people returned the following year accompanied by federal troops. Sitting Bull and the Hunkpapa attacked the survey party, which was forced to turn back. In 1873, the military accompaniment for the surveyors was increased again, but Sitting Bull&#x27;s forces resisted the survey &quot;most vigorously.&quot; The Panic of 1873 forced the Northern Pacific Railway&#x27;s backers, such as Jay Cooke, into bankruptcy, which halted construction of the railroad through Lakota, Dakota, and Nakota territory.

After the 1848 discovery of gold in the Sierra Nevada and dramatic gains in new wealth from it, other men became interested in the potential for gold mining in the Black Hills.

In 1874, Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer led a military expedition from Fort Abraham Lincoln near Bismarck to explore the Black Hills for gold and to determine a suitable location for a military fort in the Hills. Custer&#x27;s announcement of gold in the Black Hills triggered the Black Hills Gold Rush. Tensions increased between the Lakota and European Americans seeking to move into the Black Hills.

Although Sitting Bull did not attack Custer&#x27;s expedition in 1874, the U.S. government was increasingly pressured by citizens to open the Black Hills to mining and settlement. Failing in an attempt to negotiate a purchase or lease of the Hills, the government in Washington had to find a way around the promise to protect the Sioux in their land, as specified in the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie. It was alarmed at reports of Sioux depredations, some of which were encouraged by Sitting Bull.

In November 1875, President Ulysses S. Grant ordered all Sioux bands outside the Great Sioux Reservation to move onto the reservation, knowing that not all would likely comply. As of February 1, 1876, the Interior Department certified as hostile those bands who continued to live off the reservation. This certification allowed the military to pursue Sitting Bull and other Lakota bands as &quot;hostiles&quot;.

Based on tribal oral histories, historian Margot Liberty theorizes that many Lakota bands allied with the Cheyenne during the Plains Wars because they thought the other nation was under attack by the U.S. Given this connection, she suggests the major war should have been called &quot;The Great Cheyenne War&quot;. Since 1860, the Northern Cheyenne had led several battles among the Plains Indians. Before 1876, the U.S. Army had destroyed seven Cheyenne camps, more than those of any other nation.

Other historians, such as Robert M. Utley and Jerome Greene, also use Lakota oral testimony, but they have concluded that the Lakota coalition, of which Sitting Bull was the ostensible head, was the primary target of the federal government&#x27;s pacification campaign.

During the period 1868–1876, Sitting Bull developed into one of the most important Native American political leaders. After the Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868) and the creation of the Great Sioux Reservation, many traditional Sioux warriors, such as Red Cloud of the Oglala and Spotted Tail of the Brulé, moved to reside permanently on the reservations. They were largely dependent for subsistence on the U.S. Indian agencies. Many other chiefs, including members of Sitting Bull&#x27;s Hunkpapa band such as Gall, at times, lived temporarily at the agencies. They needed the supplies at a time when white encroachment and the depletion of buffalo herds reduced their resources and challenged Native American independence.

In 1875, the Northern Cheyenne, Hunkpapa, Oglala, Sans Arc, and Minneconjou camped together for a Sun Dance, with both the Cheyenne medicine man White Bull or Ice and Sitting Bull in association. This ceremonial alliance preceded their fighting together in 1876. Sitting Bull had a major revelation.

At the climactic moment, &quot;Sitting Bull intoned, &#x27;The Great Spirit has given our enemies to us. We are to destroy them. We do not know who they are. They may be soldiers.&#x27; Ice too observed, &#x27;No one then knew who the enemy were – of what tribe.&#x27;...They were soon to find out.&quot;
:— Utley 1992: 122–24

Sitting Bull&#x27;s refusal to adopt any dependence on the U.S. government meant that at times he and his small band of warriors lived isolated on the Plains. When Native Americans were threatened by the United States, numerous members from various Sioux bands and other tribes, such as the Northern Cheyenne, came to Sitting Bull&#x27;s camp. His reputation for &quot;strong medicine&quot; developed as he continued to evade the European Americans.

After the ultimatum on January 1, 1876, when the U.S. Army began to track down as hostiles those Sioux and others living off the reservation, Native Americans gathered at Sitting Bull&#x27;s camp. He took an active role in encouraging this &quot;unity camp&quot;. He sent scouts to the reservations to recruit warriors and told the Hunkpapa to share supplies with those Native Americans who joined them. An example of his generosity was Sitting Bull&#x27;s provision for Wooden Leg&#x27;s Northern Cheyenne tribe. They had been impoverished by Captain Reynolds&#x27; March 17, 1876, attack and fled to Sitting Bull&#x27;s camp for safety.

Over the course of the first half of 1876, Sitting Bull&#x27;s camp continually expanded as natives joined him for safety in numbers. His leadership had attracted warriors and families, creating an extensive village estimated at more than 10,000 people. Lt. Col. Custer came across this large camp on June 25, 1876. Sitting Bull did not take a direct military role in the ensuing battle; instead, he acted as a spiritual leader. A week prior to the attack, he had performed the Sun Dance, in which he fasted and sacrificed over 100 pieces of flesh from his arms.

===Battle of the Little Bighorn===
On June 25, 1876, Custer&#x27;s scouts discovered Sitting Bull&#x27;s camp along the Little Big Horn River, known as the Greasy Grass River to the Lakota.

After being ordered to attack, Custer&#x27;s 7th Cavalry&#x27;s troops lost ground quickly and were forced to retreat. Sitting Bull&#x27;s followers, led into battle by Crazy Horse, counterattacked and ultimately defeated Custer while surrounding and laying siege to the other two battalions led by Reno and Benteen.

The Native Americans&#x27; victory celebrations were short-lived. Public shock and outrage at Custer&#x27;s defeat and death, and the government&#x27;s understanding of the military capability of the remaining Sioux, led the Department of War to assign thousands more soldiers to the area. Over the next year, the new American military forces pursued the Lakota, forcing many of the Native Americans to surrender. Sitting Bull refused to do so and in May 1877 led his band across the border into the North-West Territories, Canada. He remained in exile for four years near Wood Mountain, refusing a pardon and the chance to return. When crossing the border into Canadian territory, Sitting Bull was met by the Mounties of the region. During this meeting, James Morrow Walsh, commander of the North-West Mounted Police, explained to Sitting Bull that the Lakota were now on British soil and must obey British law. Walsh emphasized that he enforced the law equally and that every person in the territory had a right to justice. Walsh became an advocate for Sitting Bull and the two became good friends for the remainder of their lives.

While in Canada, Sitting Bull also met with Crowfoot, who was a leader of the Blackfeet, long-time powerful enemies of the Lakota and Cheyenne. Sitting Bull wished to make peace with the Blackfeet Nation and Crowfoot. As an advocate for peace himself, Crowfoot eagerly accepted the tobacco peace offering. Sitting Bull was so impressed by Crowfoot that he named one of his sons after him.

Sitting Bull and his people stayed in Canada for four years. Due to the smaller size of the buffalo herds in Canada, Sitting Bull and his men found it difficult to find enough food to feed their starving people. Sitting Bull&#x27;s presence in the country led to increased tensions between the Canadian and the United States governments. Before Sitting Bull left Canada, he may have visited Walsh for a final time and left a ceremonial headdress as a memento.

===Surrender===

Hunger and desperation eventually forced Sitting Bull and 186 of his family and followers to return to the United States and surrender on July 19, 1881. Sitting Bull had his young son Crow Foot surrender his Winchester Rifle to major David H. Brotherton, commanding officer of Fort Buford. Sitting Bull said to Brotherton, &quot;I wish it to be remembered that I was the last man of my tribe to surrender my rifle&quot;. In the parlor of the Commanding Officer&#x27;s Quarters in a ceremony the next day, he told the four soldiers, 20 warriors and other guests in the small room that he wished to regard the soldiers and the white race as friends but he wanted to know who would teach his son the new ways of the world. Two weeks later, after waiting in vain for other members of his tribe to follow him from Canada, Sitting Bull and his band were transferred to Fort Yates, the military post located adjacent to the Standing Rock Agency. This reservation straddles the present-day boundary between North and South Dakota.

Sitting Bull and his band of 186 people were kept separate from the other Hunkpapa gathered at the agency. U.S. Army officials were concerned that he would stir up trouble among the recently surrendered northern bands. On August 26, 1881, he was visited by U.S. census taker William T. Selwyn, who counted 12 people in the Hunkpapa leader&#x27;s immediate family and 41 families, totaling 195 people, were recorded in Sitting Bull&#x27;s band.

The military decided to transfer Sitting Bull and his band to Fort Randall to be held as prisoners of war. Loaded onto a steamboat, the band of 172 people was sent down the Missouri River to Fort Randall near present-day Pickstown, South Dakota on the southern border of the state, where they spent the next 20 months. They were allowed to return north to the Standing Rock Agency in May 1883.

In 1883, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Sitting Bull had been baptized into the Catholic Church. James McLaughlin, Indian agent at Standing Rock Agency, dismissed these reports, saying: &quot;The reported baptism of Sitting-Bull is erroneous. There is no immediate prospect of such ceremony so far as I am aware.&quot;

==Annie Oakley==

In 1884, show promoter Alvaren Allen asked Agent James McLaughlin to allow Sitting Bull to tour parts of Canada and the northern United States. The show was called the &quot;Sitting Bull Connection&quot;. It was during this tour that Sitting Bull met Annie Oakley in present-day Minnesota. Sitting Bull was so impressed with Oakley&#x27;s skills with firearms that he offered $65 (equal to $ today) for a photographer to take a photo of the two together.

The admiration and respect were mutual. Oakley stated that Sitting Bull made a &quot;great pet&quot; of her. In observing Oakley, Sitting Bull&#x27;s respect for the young sharpshooter grew. Oakley was quite modest in her attire, deeply respectful of others, and had a remarkable stage persona despite being a woman who stood only five feet in height. Sitting Bull felt that she was &quot;gifted&quot; by supernatural means in order to shoot so accurately with both hands. As a result of his esteem, he symbolically &quot;adopted&quot; her as a daughter in 1884. He named her &quot;Little Sure Shot&quot;, a name that Oakley used throughout her career.

==Wild West show==

In 1885, Sitting Bull was allowed to leave the reservation to go Wild Westing with Buffalo Bill Cody&#x27;s &quot;Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West&quot;. He earned about $50 a week (equal to $ today) for riding once around the arena, where he was a popular attraction. Although it is rumored that he cursed his audiences in his native tongue during the show, the historian Utley contends that he did not. Historians have reported that Sitting Bull gave speeches about his desire for education for the young, and reconciling relations between the Sioux and whites.

The historian Edward Lazarus wrote that Sitting Bull reportedly cursed his audience in Lakota in 1884, during an opening address celebrating the completion of the Northern Pacific Railway. According to Michael Hiltzik, &quot;...Sitting Bull declared in Lakota, &#x27;I hate all White people.&#x27; ... &#x27;You are thieves and liars. You have taken away our land and made us outcasts.&#x27;&quot; The translator, however, read the original address which had been written as a &#x27;gracious act of amity&#x27;, and the audience, including President Grant, was left none the wiser.

Sitting Bull stayed with the show for four months before returning home. During that time, audiences considered him a celebrity and romanticized him as a warrior. He earned a small fortune by charging for his autograph and picture, although he often gave his money away to the homeless and beggars.

== Ghost Dance movement ==

Sitting Bull returned to the Standing Rock Agency after working in &quot;Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West&quot; show. The tension between Sitting Bull and Agent McLaughlin increased, and each became warier of the other over several issues including division and sale of parts of the Great Sioux Reservation. In 1889, Indian Rights Activist Caroline Weldon from Brooklyn, New York City, a member of the National Indian Defense Association (NIDA), reached out to Sitting Bull, acting to be his voice, secretary, interpreter, and advocate. She joined him, together with her young son Christy, at his compound on the Grand River, sharing with him and his family home and hearth.

During a time of harsh winters and long droughts impacting the Sioux Reservation, a Paiute Indian named Wovoka spread a religious movement from present-day Nevada east to the Plains that preached a resurrection of the Native. It was known as the Ghost Dance movement because it called on the Indians to dance and chant for the rising up of deceased relatives and the return of the buffalo. The dance included shirts that were said to stop bullets. When the movement reached Standing Rock, Sitting Bull allowed the dancers to gather at his camp. Although he did not appear to participate in the dancing, he was viewed as a key instigator. Alarm spread to nearby white settlements.

==Death==


In 1890, James McLaughlin, the U.S. Indian agent at Fort Yates on Standing Rock Agency, feared that the Lakota leader was about to flee the reservation with the Ghost Dancers, so he ordered the police to arrest him.

On December 14, 1890, McLaughlin drafted a letter to Lieutenant Henry Bullhead, an Indian agency policeman named as Bull Head in the letter&#x27;s beginning, which included instructions and a plan to capture Sitting Bull. The plan called for the arrest to take place at dawn on December 15 and advised the use of a light spring wagon to facilitate removal before his followers could rally. Bullhead decided against using the wagon. He intended to have the police officers force Sitting Bull to mount a horse immediately after the arrest.

Around 5:30 a.m. on December 15, 39 police officers and four volunteers approached Sitting Bull&#x27;s house. They surrounded the house, knocked, and entered. Bull Head told Sitting Bull that he was under arrest and led him outside. Sitting Bull and his wife noisily stalled for time as the camp awakened and men converged at the house. As Bull Head ordered Sitting Bull to mount a horse, he said that the Indian Affairs agent wanted to see the chief, and that Sitting Bull could then return to his house. When Sitting Bull refused to comply, the police used force on him. The Sioux in the village were enraged. Catch-the-Bear, a Lakota, shouldered his rifle and shot Bull Head, who, in response, fired his revolver into the chest of Sitting Bull. Another police officer, Red Tomahawk, shot Sitting Bull in the head, and Sitting Bull dropped to the ground. Sitting Bull died between 12 and 1 p.m.

A close quarters fight erupted, and within minutes, several men were dead. The Lakota killed six policemen immediately, and two more died shortly after the fight, including Bull Head. The police killed Sitting Bull and seven of his supporters at the site, along with two horses.

===Burial===
Sitting Bull&#x27;s body was taken to present-day Fort Yates, North Dakota, where it was placed in a coffin made by the U.S. Army carpenter there, and he was buried on the grounds of Fort Yates. A monument was installed to mark his burial site after his remains were reportedly taken to South Dakota.

In 1953, Lakota family members exhumed what they believed to be Sitting Bull&#x27;s remains, transporting them for reinterment near Mobridge, South Dakota, his birthplace. A monument to him was erected there.

==Legacy==
Following Sitting Bull&#x27;s death, his cabin on the Grand River was taken to Chicago for use as an exhibit at the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition. Indigenous dancers also performed at the exposition. On September 14, 1989, the U.S. Postal Service released a Great Americans series 28¢ postage stamp featuring a likeness of the leader.

On March 6, 1996, Standing Rock College was renamed Sitting Bull College in his honor. The college serves as an institution of higher education on Sitting Bull&#x27;s home of Standing Rock in North Dakota and South Dakota.

In August 2010, a research team led by Eske Willerslev, an ancient DNA expert at the University of Copenhagen, announced its intention to sequence the genome of Sitting Bull, with the approval of his descendants, using a hair sample obtained during his lifetime.

In October 2021, Willerslev confirmed Lakota writer and activist Ernie Lapointe&#x27;s contention that he was Sitting Bull&#x27;s great-grandson and his three sisters were Sitting Bull&#x27;s biological great-grandchildren.

==Representation in popular culture==
Sitting Bull was the subject of, or a featured character in, several Hollywood motion pictures and documentaries, which have reflected changing ideas about him and Lakota culture in relation to the United States. Among them are:
* &quot;Sitting Bull: The Hostile Sioux Indian Chief&quot; (1914)
* &quot;Sitting Bull at the Spirit Lake Massacre&quot; (1927), with Chief Yowlachie in the title role
* &quot;Annie Oakley&quot; (1935), played by Chief Thunderbird

* &quot;Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee&quot; (2007), played by August Schellenberg
* &quot;Woman Walks Ahead&quot; (2017), played by Michael Greyeyes

As time passed, Sitting Bull has become a symbol and archetype of Native American resistance movements as well as a figure celebrated by descendants of his former enemies:

* Legoland Billund, in Billund, Denmark, the first Legoland park, contains a 36-foot-tall Lego sculpture of Sitting Bull.
* Sitting Bull is featured as the leader for the Native American Civilization in the computer game &quot;Civilization IV&quot;.
* Sitting Bull is listed as one of 13 great Americans in President Barack Obama&#x27;s children&#x27;s book, &quot;Of Thee I Sing: A Letter to My Daughters&quot;.

<text>The Tujia (Northern Tujia: &quot;Bifjixkhar&quot; / &quot;Bifzixkar&quot;, IPA: , Southern Tujia: &quot;Mongrzzir&quot;, ; ) are an ethnic group and, with a total population of over 8 million, the eighth-largest officially recognized ethnic minority in the People&#x27;s Republic of China. They live in the Wuling Mountains, straddling the common borders of Hunan, Hubei and Guizhou Provinces and Chongqing Municipality.

The endonym &quot;Bizika&quot; means &quot;native dwellers&quot;. In Chinese, &quot;Tujia&quot; literally means &quot;local families&quot;, in contrast to the Hakka (), whose name literally means &quot;guest families&quot; and implies migration.

==Origins==
Although there are different accounts of their origins, the Tujia may trace their history back over twelve centuries and possibly beyond, to the ancient Ba people who occupied the area around modern-day Chongqing some 2,500 years ago. The Ba Kingdom reached the zenith of its power between 600 BC and 400 BC but was annexed by the Qin in 316 BC.

After being referred to by a long succession of different names in ancient documents, the Tujia appeared in historical records from about 14th century onwards.

==Ming and Qing dynasties==
The Tujia tusi chieftains reached the zenith of their power under the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), when they were accorded comparatively high status by the imperial court. They achieved this through their reputation as providers of fierce, highly disciplined fighting men, who were employed by the emperor to suppress revolts by other minorities. On numerous occasions, they helped defend China against outside invaders, such as the &quot;wokou&quot; (&quot;Japanese&quot; pirates) who ravaged the coast during the 16th century.

The Manchus invaded and conquered the Ming in 1644 and established the Great Qing Empire, known in China as the Qing dynasty. Ever suspicious of local rulers, the Qing emperors always tried to replace Han officials with Manchu officials wherever they could. In the early 18th century, the Qing court finally felt secure enough to establish direct control over minority areas as well. This process, known as &quot;gaituguiliu&quot; (literally &#x27;replace the local [ruler], return to mainstream [central rule]&#x27;), was carried out throughout South-West China gradually and, in general, peacefully. The court adopted a carrot and stick approach of lavish pensions for compliant chieftains, coupled with a huge show of military force on the borders of their territories.

Most of the Tujia areas returned to central control during the period 1728–1735. While the rule of the Qing government was more orderly compared to the rule of chieftains, many in the Tujia peasantry came to resent the attempts of the Qing court to impose national culture and customs on them. With the weakening of central Qing rule, numerous large-scale uprisings occurred, culminating in the violent Taiping Rebellion.

==Recent history==

Following the collapse of the Qing, the Tujia found themselves caught between various competing warlords. More and more land was given over to the cultivation of high-earning opium at the insistence of wealthy landlords and banditry was rife. After the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949, Tujia areas came under communist control and banditry was rapidly eradicated. The Great Leap Forward led to mass famine in Tujia communities.

The Tujia were officially recognized as one of the 55 ethnic minorities in January 1957 and a number of autonomous prefectures and counties were subsequently established.

State Councillor Dai Bingguo, one of China&#x27;s top officials on foreign policy, is the most prominent Tujia in the Chinese government.

==Culture==
Today, traditional Tujia customs can only be found in the most remote areas.

The Tujia are renowned for their singing and song composing abilities and for their tradition of the Baishou dance (摆手舞), a 500-year-old collective dance which uses 70 ritual gestures to represent war, farming, hunting, courtship and other aspects of traditional life. They are also famous for their richly patterned brocade, known as &quot;xilankapu&quot;, a product that in earlier days regularly figured in their tribute payments to the Chinese court. For their spring festival they prepare handmade glutinous rice cakes called ciba cake. They gather round the fire to sing folk songs and eat grilled ciba.

Regarding religion, most of the Tujia worship a white tiger totem, although some Tujia in western Hunan worship a turtle totem.

==Language==

Tujia is a Sino-Tibetan language and is usually considered an isolate within this group. It has some grammatical and phonological similarities with Nuosu, though its vocabulary is very different.

Today there are at most 70,000 native speakers of the Tujia language, most of whom live in the northern parts Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture in North-Western Hunan Province.

The vast majority of the Tujia use varieties of Chinese, mainly Southwestern Mandarin; a few speak Hmongic languages. Few monolingual Tujia speakers remain; nearly all are bilingual in some dialect of Chinese. Children now learn Chinese from childhood and many young Tujia prefer to use Chinese when communicating among themselves. Among fluent Tujia speakers, Chinese borrowings and even sentence structures, are more common.

<doc id="152835" wikidata="Q3196867" url="?curid=152835" title="Debt">
<text>Debt is an obligation that requires one party, the debtor, to pay money borrowed or otherwise withheld from another party, the creditor. Debt may be owed by a sovereign state or country, local government, company, or an individual. Commercial debt is generally subject to contractual terms regarding the amount and timing of repayments of principal and interest. Loans, bonds, notes, and mortgages are all types of debt. In financial accounting, debt is a type of financial transaction, as distinct from equity.

The term can also be used metaphorically to cover moral obligations and other interactions not based on a monetary value. For example, in Western cultures, a person who has been helped by a second person is sometimes said to owe a &quot;debt of gratitude&quot; to the second person.

==Etymology==
The English term &quot;debt&quot; was first used in the late 13th century and comes by way of Old French from the Latin verb &quot;debere&quot;, &quot;to owe; to have from someone else.&quot; The related term &quot;debtor&quot; was first used in English also in the early 13th century.

== Terms ==

=== Principal ===

Principal is the amount of money originally invested or loaned, on which basis interest and returns are calculated.

=== Repayment ===
There are three main ways repayment may be structured: the entire principal balance may be due at the maturity of the loan; the entire principal balance may be amortized over the term of the loan; or the loan may be partially amortized during its term, with the remaining principal due as a &quot;balloon payment&quot; at maturity. Amortization structures are common in mortgages and credit cards.

===Default provisions===

Debtors of every type default on their debt from time to time, with various consequences depending on the terms of the debt and the law governing default in the relevant jurisdiction. 
If the debt was secured by specific collateral, such as a car or house, the creditor may seek to repossess the collateral. In more serious circumstances, individuals and companies may go into bankruptcy.

== Types of giving finance ==

=== Individuals ===
Common types of debt owed by individuals and households include mortgage loans, car loans, credit card debt, and income taxes. For individuals, debt is a means of using anticipated income and future purchasing power in the present before it has actually been earned. Commonly, people in industrialized nations use consumer debt to purchase houses, cars and other things too expensive to buy with cash on hand.

People are likely to spend more and get into debt when they use credit cards as against cash to buy products and services. This is primarily because of the transparency effect and consumer&#x27;s &quot;pain of paying.&quot; The transparency effect refers to the idea that the further you are from cash (as with a credit card or other forms of payment), the less transparent it is and the less aware you are of how much you have spent. The less transparent or further away from cash the form of payment employed is, the less an individual feels the &quot;pain of paying&quot; and thus is likely to spend more. Furthermore, the differing physical appearance/form that credit cards have from cash may cause them to be viewed as &quot;monopoly&quot; money vs. real money, luring individuals to spend more money than they would if they only had cash available.

Besides these more formal debts, private individuals also lend informally to other people, mostly relatives or friends. One reason for such informal debts is that many people, in particular those who are poor, have no access to affordable credit. Such debts can cause problems when they are not paid back according to expectations of the lending household. In 2011, 8 percent of people in the European Union reported their households has been in arrears, that is, unable to pay as scheduled &quot;payments related to informal loans from friends or relatives not living in your household&quot;.

=== Businesses ===
A company may use various kinds of debt to finance its operations as a part of its overall corporate finance strategy.

A term loan is the simplest form of corporate debt. It consists of an agreement to lend a fixed amount of money, called the principal sum or principal, for a fixed period of time, with this amount to be repaid by a certain date. In commercial loans interest, calculated as a percentage of the principal sum per year, will also have to be paid by that date, or may be paid periodically in the interval, such as annually or monthly. Such loans are also colloquially called &quot;bullet loans&quot;, particularly if there is only a single payment at the end – the &quot;bullet&quot; – without a &quot;stream&quot; of interest payments during the life of the loan.

A revenue-based financing loan comes with a fixed repayment target that is reached over a period of several years. This type of loan generally comes with a repayment amount of 1.5 to 2.5 times the principle loan. Repayment periods are flexible; businesses can pay back the agreed-upon amount sooner, if possible, or later. In addition, business owners do not sell equity or relinquish control when using revenue-based financing. Lenders that provide revenue-based financing work more closely with businesses than bank lenders, but take a more hands-off approach than private equity investors.

A syndicated loan is a loan that is granted to companies that wish to borrow more money than any single lender is prepared to risk in a single loan. A syndicated loan is provided by a group of lenders and is structured, arranged, and administered by one or several commercial banks or investment banks known as arrangers. Loan syndication is a risk management tool that allows the lead banks underwriting the debt to reduce their risk and free up lending capacity.

A company may also issue bonds, which are debt securities. Bonds have a fixed lifetime, usually a number of years; with long-term bonds, lasting over 30 years, being less common. At the end of the bond&#x27;s life the money should be repaid in full. Interest may be added to the end payment, or can be paid in regular installments (known as coupons) during the life of the bond.

A letter of credit or LC can also be the source of payment for a transaction, meaning that redeeming the letter of credit will pay an exporter. Letters of credit are used primarily in international trade transactions of significant value, for deals between a supplier in one country and a customer in another. They are also used in the land development process to ensure that approved public facilities (streets, sidewalks, stormwater ponds, etc.) will be built. The parties to a letter of credit are usually a beneficiary who is to receive the money, the issuing bank of whom the applicant is a client, and the advising bank of whom the beneficiary is a client. Almost all letters of credit are irrevocable, i.e., cannot be amended or canceled without prior agreement of the beneficiary, the issuing bank and the confirming bank, if any. In executing a transaction, letters of credit incorporate functions common to giros and traveler&#x27;s cheque. Typically, the documents a beneficiary has to present in order to receive payment include a commercial invoice, bill of lading, and a document proving the shipment was insured against loss or damage in transit. However, the list and form of documents is open to imagination and negotiation and might contain requirements to present documents issued by a neutral third party evidencing the quality of the goods shipped, or their place of origin.

Debt consolidation is a process whereby a new, large loan application is submitted in order to compensate for numerous outstanding loans. Some amongst those who are heavily indebted often resort to debt consolidation as a means to resolve their financial difficulties. Upon obtaining the borrowed loan, those within the receiving end are then generally enabled to have a greater cash flow, resulting from lowering monthly payments, if not reducing interest rates. However, this varies from every claimant, in that their own eligibility for such is entirely dependent on their own overall circumstances; Should they meet specific requirements, being able to afford such, their requests are usually accepted; Should they fail the criteria, they&#x27;re almost always swiftly rejected, regardless of their financial ability. Given the often monetary hardship of contenders, those providing these loans often charge at larger rates of interest than others; This is often critiqued by its opponents, who claim that it is an unfair practice aimed at targeting those who are desperate and often holds arbitrary figures, although those in its defence claim it is a security measure aimed at ensuring its repayment obligations and must take precautions before offering large sums. Both arguments have resulted in greater debate amongst legislators in different nations, amidst demands for further regulation and more decreases in lending restrictions. Debt consolidation has also been an area of interest for loan sharks, leaving those heavily indebted vulnerable to extortionate rates. The idea behind debt consolidation is occasionally a matter of debate in the financial and institutional sectors, often ranging between analysts towards professors, generally concerning ethics involved in different areas.

Companies also use debt in many ways for capital expenditures and other business investments produced in their assets, &quot;leveraging&quot; the return on their equity. This leverage, the proportion of debt to equity, is considered paramount in determining the riskiness of an investment, under the notion that it becomes more risking under more debt.

=== Governments ===
Governments issue debt to pay for ongoing expenses as well as major capital projects. Government debt may be issued by sovereign states as well as by local governments, sometimes known as municipalities.

Debt issued by the government of the United States, called Treasuries, serves as a reference point for all other debt. There are deep, transparent, liquid, and open capital markets for Treasuries. Furthermore, Treasuries are issued in a wide variety of maturities, from one day to thirty years, which facilitates comparing the interest rates on other debt to a security of comparable maturity. In finance, the theoretical &quot;risk-free interest rate&quot; is often approximated by practitioners by using the current yield of a Treasury of the same duration.

The overall level of indebtedness by a government is typically shown as a ratio of debt-to-GDP. This ratio helps to assess the speed of changes in government indebtedness and the size of the debt due.

The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 17, an integral part of the 2030 Agenda has a target to address the external debt of highly indebted poor countries to reduce debt distress.

=== Municipalities ===
Municipal bonds (or muni bonds) are typical debt obligations, for which the conditions are defined unilaterally by the issuing municipality (local government), but it is a slower process to accumulate the necessary amount. Usually, debt or bond financing will not be used to finance current operating expenditures, the purposes of these amounts are local developments, capital investments, constructions, own contribution to other credits or grants.

== Assessments of creditworthiness ==

=== Income metrics ===
The debt service coverage ratio is the ratio of income available to the amount of debt service due (including both interest and principal amortization, if any). The higher the debt service coverage ratio, the more income is available to pay debt service, and the easier and lower-cost it will be for a borrower to obtain financing.

Different debt markets have somewhat different conventions in terminology and calculations for income-related metrics. For example, in mortgage lending in the United States, a debt-to-income ratio typically includes the cost of mortgage payments as well as insurance and property tax, divided by a consumer&#x27;s monthly income. A &quot;front-end ratio&quot; of 28% or below, together with a &quot;back-end ratio&quot; (including required payments on non-housing debt as well) of 36% or below is also required to be eligible for a conforming loan.

=== Value metrics ===

The loan-to-value ratio is the ratio of the total amount of the loan to the total value of the collateral securing the loan.

For example, in mortgage lending in the United States, the loan-to-value concept is most commonly expressed as a &quot;down payment.&quot; A 20% down payment is equivalent to an 80% loan to value. With home purchases, value may be assessed using the agreed-upon purchase price, and/or an appraisal.

=== Collateral and recourse ===
A debt obligation is considered secured if creditors have recourse to specific collateral. Collateral may include claims on tax receipts (in the case of a government), specific assets (in the case of a company) or a home (in the case of a consumer). Unsecured debt comprises financial obligations for which creditors do not have recourse to the assets of the borrower to satisfy their claims.

=== Role of rating agencies ===

Credit bureaus collect information about the borrowing and repayment history of consumers. Lenders, such as banks and credit card companies, use credit scores to evaluate the potential risk posed by lending money to consumers. In the United States, the primary credit bureaus are Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion.

Debts owed by governments and private corporations may be rated by rating agencies, such as Moody&#x27;s, Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s, Fitch Ratings, and A. M. Best. The government or company itself will also be given its own separate rating. These agencies assess the ability of the debtor to honor his obligations and accordingly give him or her a credit rating. Moody&#x27;s uses the letters &quot;Aaa Aa A Baa Ba B Caa Ca C&quot;, where ratings &quot;Aa-Caa&quot; are qualified by numbers 1-3. S&amp;P and other rating agencies have slightly different systems using capital letters and +/- qualifiers. Thus a government or corporation with a high rating would have Aaa rating.

A change in ratings can strongly affect a company, since its cost of refinancing depends on its creditworthiness. Bonds below Baa/BBB (Moody&#x27;s/S&amp;P) are considered junk or high-risk bonds. Their high risk of default (approximately 1.6 percent for Ba) is compensated by higher interest payments. Bad Debt is a loan that can not (partially or fully) be repaid by the debtor. The debtor is said to default on their debt. These types of debt are frequently repackaged and sold below face value. Buying junk bonds is seen as a risky but potentially profitable investment.

== Debt markets ==

=== Market interest rates ===
=== Loans versus bonds ===
Bonds are debt securities, tradeable on a bond market. A country&#x27;s regulatory structure determines what qualifies as a security. For example, in North America, each security is uniquely identified by a CUSIP for trading and settlement purposes. In contrast, loans are not securities and do not have CUSIPs (or the equivalent). Loans may be sold or acquired in certain circumstances, as when a bank syndicates a loan.

Loans can be turned into securities through the securitization process. In a securitization, a company sells a pool of assets to a securitization trust, and the securitization trust finances its purchase of the assets by selling securities to the market. For example, a trust may own a pool of home mortgages, and be financed by residential mortgage-backed securities. In this case, the asset-backed trust is a debt issuer of residential mortgage-backed securities.

=== Role of central banks ===
Central banks, such as the U.S. Federal Reserve System, play a key role in the debt markets. Debt is normally denominated in a particular currency, and so changes in the valuation of that currency can change the effective size of the debt. This can happen due to inflation or deflation, so it can happen even though the borrower and the lender are using the same currency.

== Criticisms ==
 
Some argue against debt as an instrument and institution, on a personal, family, social, corporate and governmental level. Some Islamic banking forbids lending with interest even today. In hard times, the cost of servicing debt can grow beyond the debtor&#x27;s ability to pay, due to either external events (income loss) or internal difficulties (poor management of resources).

Debt with an associated interest rate will increase through time if it is not repaid faster than it grows through interest. This effect may be termed usury, while the term &quot;usury&quot; in other contexts refers only to an excessive rate of interest, in excess of a reasonable profit for the risk accepted.

In international legal thought, odious debt is debt that is incurred by a regime for purposes that do not serve the interest of the state. Such debts are thus considered by this doctrine to be personal debts of the regime that incurred them and not debts of the state.

Excessive debt accumulation has been blamed for exacerbating economic problems. For example, before the Great Depression, the debt-to-GDP ratio was very high. This excess of debt, equivalent to excessive expectations on future returns, accompanied asset bubbles on the stock markets. When expectations corrected, deflation and a credit crunch followed. Deflation effectively made debt more expensive and, as Fisher explained, this reinforced deflation again, because, in order to reduce their debt level, economic agents reduced their consumption and investment. The reduction in demand reduced business activity and caused further unemployment. In a more direct sense, more bankruptcies also occurred due both to increased debt cost caused by deflation and the reduced demand.

At the household level, debts can also have detrimental effects — particularly when households make spending decisions assuming income will increase, or remain stable, in years to come. When households take on credit based on this assumption, life events can easily change indebtedness into over-indebtedness. Such life events include unexpected unemployment, relationship break-up, leaving the parental home, business failure, illness, or home repairs. Over-indebtedness has severe social consequences, such as financial hardship, poor physical and mental health, family stress, stigma, difficulty obtaining employment, exclusion from basic financial services (European Commission, 2009), work accidents and industrial disease, a strain on social relations (Carpentier and Van den Bosch, 2008), absenteeism at work and lack of organisational commitment (Kim &quot;et al.&quot;, 2003), feeling of insecurity, and relational tensions.

== History ==
According to historian Paul Johnson, the lending of &quot;food money&quot; was commonplace in Middle Eastern civilizations as early as 5000 BC.

Religions like Judaism and Christianity for example, demand that debt be forgiven on a regular basis, in order to prevent systemic inequities between groups in society, or anyone becoming a specialist in holding debt and coercing repayment. An example is the Biblical Jubilee year, described in the Book of Leviticus. Similarly, in Deuteronomy chapter 15 and verse 1 states that debts be forgiven after seven years. This is because biblically debt is seen as the responsibility of both the creditor and the debtor. Traditional Christian teaching holds that a lifestyle of debt should not be normative; the Emmanuel Association, a Methodist denomination in the conservative holiness movement, for example, teaches: &quot;We are to refrain from entering into debt when we have no reasonable plan to pay. We are to be careful to meet all financial engagements promptly when due, if at all possible, remembering that we are to &#x27;Provide things honest in the sight of all men&#x27; and to &#x27;owe no man any thing, but to love one another&#x27; (Romans 12:17; 13:8).&quot;

<doc id="152839" wikidata="Q2422173" url="?curid=152839" title="Sonic Mega Collection">
<text>is a video game compilation developed by Sonic Team and published by Sega in 2002 for the GameCube. It is a compilation of several &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; games originally released for the Genesis, along with a few other Sega-published titles for the system.

According to the director, Yojiro Ogawa, the purpose of the compilation was to introduce younger players to the original games in the &quot;Sonic&quot; series. The games are played through a Genesis emulator developed by Sonic Team themselves. Outside of the games, the compilation includes &quot;Sonic&quot;-themed videos and illustrations, as well as high-resolution scans of the instruction manuals and &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; comic covers.

&quot;Sonic Mega Collection&quot; received positive critical reception, being recommended for its large library of titles, high quality emulation, and its cheap market price. The compilation was re-released for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and Microsoft Windows as Sonic Mega Collection Plus with additional &quot;Sonic&quot; games originally released for the Game Gear. This was followed by a second compilation for the PlayStation 2 and GameCube, &quot;Sonic Gems Collection&quot;, with more obscure and rare &quot;Sonic&quot; games such as &quot;Sonic CD&quot;.

==Overview==
&quot;Sonic Mega Collection&quot; compiles 14 emulated games originally released for the Sega Genesis, limited to only 12 in releases outside of Japan. In addition to the seven default games, three unlockable games are included that recreate the &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot; &quot;lock-on technology&quot; to allow for new modes and/or playable characters in the first three &quot;Sonic&quot; games. Four non-&quot;Sonic&quot; games published by Sega are also unlockable, two of which are exclusive to the Japanese release. High-resolution instruction manual scans are included for each game. An &quot;Extras&quot; section features over 100 scans of comic covers from Archie Comics&#x27; &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; series, illustrations of &quot;Sonic&quot; characters throughout the franchise&#x27;s history, and a handful of videos promoting other &quot;Sonic&quot; games, including the opening and ending cutscenes from &quot;Sonic CD&quot;. 

&quot;Sonic Mega Collection Plus&quot; includes all 14 of the games from the original release in all regions, plus the addition of six Game Gear games. The compilation&#x27;s user interface has been updated, and all games now support the ability to suspend and resume gameplay at any time. The illustration gallery has been expanded with artwork from games released since the original &quot;Mega Collection&quot;, while all videos from the original release have been omitted, replaced by a gallery of storyboards and in-production renders of cutscenes from &quot;Sonic Heroes&quot;.


==Development==
&quot;Mega Collection&quot; was developed by Sonic Team, the studio behind most games in the &quot;Sonic&quot; series. According to director Yojiro Ogawa, Sonic Team&#x27;s goal with the compilation was to introduce children to older games in the series and showcase what made &quot;Sonic&quot; successful. Sonic Team chose to focus on including all the Genesis &quot;Sonic&quot; games. Rather than porting them from the Genesis, they collaborated with VR-1 Japan to develop an emulator to run the games&#x27; ROM images. Series co-creator Yuji Naka, who served as producer, said the team intended to include the 1993 Sega CD game &quot;Sonic CD&quot;, but storage constraints prevented this. Sonic Team also considered including BlueSky Software&#x27;s &quot;Vectorman&quot; (1995). &quot;CD&quot; and &quot;Vectorman&quot; later appeared in &quot;Sonic Gems Collection&quot; (2005), a successor to &quot;Mega Collection&quot; focusing on rare &quot;Sonic&quot; games. Sonic Team had trouble gathering materials for the compilation because it had been a decade since they made the games and &quot;Sega&#x27;s not that good about keeping history.&quot; For instance, Naka wanted to include the original prototype of the first game but Sonic Team could not find its ROM image.

Sega announced &quot;Mega Collection&quot; as a GameCube exclusive in early July 2002, and revealed which games would be included later that month. The compilation went gold the following November; Naka said Sonic Team felt a sense of accomplishment when they completed it. &quot;Mega Collection&quot; was released in North America on November 12, 2002, in Japan on December 19, 2002, and in Europe on March 21, 2003. In European territories, Infogrames distributed the compilation. When Sega began to expand support for the PlayStation 2, it commissioned a version of &quot;Mega Collection&quot; for that console and the Xbox. This version, &quot;Sonic Mega Collection Plus&quot;, was announced at E3 2004. &quot;Plus&quot; was released in North America on November 2, 2004, in Japan on December 9, 2004, and in Europe on February 4, 2005. A Windows version was released in March 2006, and was later included in the &quot;Sonic PC Collection&quot; (2009).

==Reception==

Reviews for &quot;Sonic Mega Collection&quot; were generally favorable. Louis Bedigian of &quot;GameZone&quot; praised the controls as &quot;top-notch&quot; including that &quot;even the thumbstick is usable, and it works flawlessly.&quot; &quot;Game Informer&quot; declared &quot;Sonic Mega Collection&quot; to be &quot;perhaps the best compilation ever.&quot; Fran Mirabella of &quot;IGN&quot; christened the compilation as &quot;a wonderful little collection that, while not perfect, is a great value.&quot; Jeff Gerstmann of &quot;GameSpot&quot; suggested that &quot;if you&#x27;re fiending for Sonic the Hedgehog and either don&#x27;t have or are unwilling to drag out a dusty Genesis from the closet, don&#x27;t hesitate to give it a shot.&quot; However, Johnny Liu of &quot;Game Revolution&quot; advised &quot;just blow the dust off the old Genesis, because there isn&#x27;t enough good extra stuff here.&quot; &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; described &quot;Sonic Mega Collection&quot; as &quot;the ultimate compilation of &quot;Sonic&quot; adventures.&quot; It was a runner-up for &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s annual &quot;Best Platformer on GameCube&quot; award, which went to &quot;Super Mario Sunshine&quot;.

Reviews for &quot;Sonic Mega Collection Plus&quot; were also positive. Chris Baker of &quot;GameSpy&quot; decided that &quot;despite its exclusions, though, &quot;Collection&quot;&#x27;s large selection of titles for $19.99 is a tough thing not to recommend to anyone who calls himself a gamer. Even if a few of the games undeniably suck.&quot; Hilary Goldstein of &quot;IGN&quot; declared that &quot;you can&#x27;t find a better deal than 20 games for 20 dollars,&quot; and that &quot;while not every &quot;Sonic&quot; game is a winner, the majority are. These games, though old, are superior to Sega&#x27;s more recent 3D &quot;Sonic&quot; offerings.&quot; Aceinet of &quot;GameZone&quot;, while praising the compilation overall as &quot;a nearly complete package of classic &quot;Sonic&quot; games,&quot; was critical of the emulation of the Game Gear games, saying that &quot;while the emulation is spot-on for the games, having to put up with a black bar around the screen could be upsetting to some.&quot; Jeremy Parish of &quot;1UP.com&quot; assured readers that &quot;even with its shortcomings, it&#x27;s still one of the most value-packed classic compilations available for any system -- as long as you like Sonic.&quot; &quot;Game Informer&quot; suggested that &quot;if you grew up with these games, they&#x27;re still a joy to play,&quot; and that &quot;new converts to the &quot;Sonic&quot; fold will get a great introduction to the &#x27;hog&#x27;s history.&quot; &quot;GMR&quot; concluded that &quot;if you&#x27;re new to Sonic, for 20 bucks you really can&#x27;t go wrong.&quot;

The PlayStation 2 version of &quot;Mega Collection Plus&quot; received a &quot;Platinum&quot; sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 300,000 copies in the United Kingdom.

<doc id="152841" wikidata="Q174044" url="?curid=152841" title="Alexander Nevsky">
<text>Alexander Yaroslavich Nevsky (; ; monastic name: &quot;Aleksiy&quot;; 13 May 1221 – 14 November 1263) was Prince of Novgorod (1236–1240; 1241–1256; 1258–1259), Grand Prince of Kiev (1249–1263), and Grand Prince of Vladimir (1252–1263).

Commonly regarded as a key figure in medieval Russian history, Alexander was a grandson of Vsevolod the Big Nest and rose to legendary status on account of his military victories in northwestern Russia over Swedish invaders in the 1240 Battle of the Neva, as well as German crusaders in the 1242 Battle on the Ice. He preserved Eastern Orthodoxy, agreeing to pay tribute to the powerful Golden Horde. Metropolitan Macarius of Moscow canonized Alexander Nevsky as a saint of the Russian Orthodox Church in 1547.

==Early life==
From the &quot;Tales of the Life and Courage of the Pious and Great Prince Alexander&quot; found in the &quot;Second Pskovian Chronicle&quot; () comes one of the first known references to Alexander Yaroslavich:

Born in Pereslavl-Zalessky around the year 1220, Alexander was the second son of Prince Yaroslav Vsevolodovich. His mother was . He spent most of his youth in Pereslavl-Zalessky. Little is known about the activities of Yaroslav&#x27;s children before the year 1238. Alexander&#x27;s eldest brother Fyodor died in 1233 at the age of 14.

==Reign==
===Prince of Novgorod===
In 1236, Alexander was appointed by the Novgorodians to become their prince (&quot;knyaz&quot;), where he had already served as his father&#x27;s governor in Novgorod. The Novgorod chronicle describes how Yaroslav left his son Alexander in Novgorod and took with him &quot;senior Novgorodians&quot; and a hundred men from Torzhok and &quot;sat in Kiev upon the throne&quot;.

In 1237, the Swedes received papal authorization to launch a crusade, and in 1240, new campaigns began in the easternmost part of the Baltic region. The Finnish mission&#x27;s eastward expansion led to a clash between Sweden and the city-state of Novgorod, since the Karelians had been allies and tributaries of Novgorod since the mid-12th century. The Swedish army was led by Birger Jarl and consisted of Norwegians and Finnish tribes. After a successful campaign into Tavastia, the Swedes advanced further east. According to Russian sources, the Swedish army landed at the confluence of the rivers Izhora and Neva, when Alexander and his small army suddenly attacked the Swedes on 15 July 1240 and defeated them in the Battle of the Neva.

The event was later depicted as being of national importance, and in the 15th century, Alexander received the sobriquet &quot;Nevsky&quot; (&quot;of the Neva&quot;). The Soviet-era historian Igor Shaskolsky suggested that the attack was coordinated, referring to the &quot;Life of Alexander Nevsky&quot;, the only Russian source besides the &quot;First Novgorod Chronicle&quot; that mentions the battle, in which it is stated that the Swedes intended to conquer Novgorod. According to John Fennell: &quot;there is no evidence of any coordination of action between the Swedes, the Germans and the Danes, nor is there anything to show that this was more than a continuation of the Russo-Swedish conflict for mastery over Finland and Karelia&quot;. The battle is not mentioned in Swedish sources, and so was likely part of periodic clashes between Sweden and Novgorod.

In September 1240, troops of the Bishopric of Dorpat, the Livonian Order and the exiled pretender-prince conducted a campaign in Izborsk and Pskov, successfully overthrowing the pro-Suzdal faction which had supported Alexander. Shortly thereafter, either in late 1240 or early 1241, the Novgorodians rose up against Alexander and banished him to Pereslavl-Zalessky. That same winter, a campaign into Votia was conducted by the Bishopric of Ösel–Wiek, the Livonian Order, as well as Estonians (&quot;Chud&#x27;&quot;) with support from local Votian leaders. It is unclear whether Votia was a tributary of Novgorod at this time, or not. According to Anti Selart, the allies likely only intended to acquire pagan lands and convert them to Catholicism, rather than attacking Novgorod, which was already Christianized. On the other hand, the campaign was &quot;a purely political undertaking which had nothing to do with conversion of pagans&quot;. Although the Northern Crusades were aimed at pagan Balts and Finns, rather than Orthodox Russians, several unsuccessful attempts were made to persuade Novgorod to convert to Catholicism, which were resisted by Alexander.

The Novgorodian authorities recalled Alexander, and in the spring of 1241, he returned from exile and assembled an army. Alexander managed to retake Pskov and Koporye from the crusaders and drive out the invaders. He then continued into Estonian-German territory. The crusaders defeated a detachment of the Novgorodian army. As a result, Alexander set up a position at Lake Peipus. Alexander and his men then faced the Livonian heavy cavalry led by Hermann of Dorpat, brother of Albert of Buxhoeveden, where they met on 5 April 1242. Alexander&#x27;s army then defeated the enemy in the Battle on the Ice, halting the eastward expansion of the Teutonic Order. Later in the same year, the Germans agreed to relinquish control of any Russian territory still occupied, as well as to exchange prisoners of war. Later Russian sources would elevate the importance of the battle and portray it as one of the great Russian victories of the Middle Ages.

The &quot;Livonian Rhymed Chronicle&quot; narrates the events of the battle:

After the Livonian invasion, Nevsky continued to strengthen the Republic of Novgorod. He sent his envoys to Norway and, as a result, they signed a first peace treaty between Novgorod and Norway in 1251. Alexander led his army to Finland and successfully routed the Swedes, who had made another attempt to block the Baltic Sea from the Novgorodians in 1256. In 1261, Alexander also concluded a treaty with Lithuanian king Mindaugas against the Livonian Order, but the planned attack failed as Alexander was summoned to Sarai by the khan.

===Grand Prince of Vladimir===

Upon the conquest of the Grand Principality of Vladimir by the Mongols in 1238, its reigning prince, Yuri II Vsevolodovich, was killed in the Battle of the Sit River; his younger brother, Yaroslav II Vsevolodovich (Alexander&#x27;s father), requested and received from the Mongol khan his permission to become the new prince. As prince, he assigned Novgorod to his son Alexander. However, while traveling in 1245 to the Mongol capital Karakorum in Central Asia, Yaroslav died. When, in 1248, Alexander and his older brother Andrey II Yaroslavich also traveled to Karakorum to attend upon the Great Khan, Andrey received the title of grand prince of Vladimir and Alexander the nominal lordship of Kiev. The two returned in the autumn of 1249.

The Rurikid princes of Rus&#x27; were obliged to appear before the khans in person, pay homage to them and receive their &quot;jarlig&quot; (patent) to be affirmed in their principalities. When Möngke became the new great khan in 1251, only two years after Guyuk&#x27;s death, he demanded another appearance at Sarai on the Volga, but Andrey refused to go. Thanks to his friendship with Sartaq Khan, the subsequent invasion by the Mongols, their first venture into northeastern Rus&#x27; since the initial conquest, saw Andrey exiled to Sweden and Alexander assuming the title of grand prince of Vladimir in 1252, the most senior of the princes at the time following the fall of Kiev. Alexander faithfully supported Mongol rule within his own domains. In 1259, he led an army to the city of Novgorod and forced it to pay tribute it had previously refused to the Golden Horde.

==Family==

In 1242, Alexander married Aleksandra, a daughter of Bryacheslav Vasilkovich, the prince of Polotsk. They had five children:

*Vasily, prince of Novgorod (c. 1239 – 1271), betrothed to Princess Kristina of Norway in 1251 before the marriage contract was broken;
*Eudoxia Alexandrovna, married Konstantin Rostislavich of Smolensk;
*Dmitry (c. 1250 – 1294), prince of Pereslavl and grand prince of Vladimir;
*Andrey of Gorodets (c. 1255 – 1304), prince of Gorodets and grand prince of Vladimir;
*Daniel of Moscow (1261–1303), prince of Moscow.

==Death and burial==
On 14 November 1263, while returning from Sarai on one of his frequent visits to the Horde, Alexander died in the town of Gorodets-on-the-Volga. On 23 November 1263, he was buried in the church of the Monastery of the Nativity of the Holy Mother of God in Vladimir.

From the &quot;Second Pskovian Chronicle&quot;:

==Veneration and sainthood==
The veneration of Alexander began almost immediately after his burial, when he reportedly extended his hand for the prayer of absolution. According to Orthodox tradition, Alexander foresaw his death and before this took strict Orthodox Christian monastic vows, called Great Schema, and took the name Alexey.

In 1380, Alexander&#x27;s remains were uncovered in response to a vision before the Battle of Kulikovo and found to be incorrupt. The relics were then placed in a shrine in the church. Alexander was canonized as a saint of the Russian Orthodox Church by Metropolitan Macarius in 1547.

In 1695, a new wooden reliquary was made in Moscow, and the relics were placed in it in 1697. By order of Peter the Great, the relics were then removed from Vladimir on 11 August 1723 and transported to Shlisselburg, arriving there on 20 September. There they were kept until 1724, when they were brought to Saint Petersburg and installed in the Annunciation Church of the Alexander Nevsky Lavra on 30 August.
In 1753, a silver shrine with sarcophagus for the relics, made from 90 pounds of silver, was donated by Empress Elizabeth of Russia. With the completion of the Holy Trinity Cathedral of the Alexander Nevsky Lavra in 1790, the shrine and relics were translated there at its consecration on 30 August, one of the saint&#x27;s feast days.

In May 1922, during the general confiscation of Russian Orthodox Church property, the sarcophagus was opened and the relics removed; and the elaborate silver shrine was transferred to the Hermitage Museum. The relics were put into storage at the Museum of the History of Religion and Atheism, before being returned to Holy Trinity Cathedral in 1989. On 10 May 2023, the Hermitage Museum and Alexander Nevsky Lavra signed a contract for the transfer of the shrine to Holy Trinity Cathedral of the Alexander Nevsky Lavra for a period of 49 years. On 12 September 2023, Patriarch Kirill of Moscow placed the relics back into the silver sarcophagus.

Alexander&#x27;s principal feast day is 23 November. A secondary feast day was instituted on 30 August in commemoration of his relics being placed in the Annunciation Church. He is jointly commemorated with other saints of Rostov and Yaroslavl on 23 May.

In February 2024, it was announced that the memorial of Saint Alexander Nevsky had been deleted from the synaxarion of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine.

== Legacy ==
Some historians see Alexander&#x27;s choice of subordination to the Golden Horde as an important reaffirmation of East Slavs&#x27; Orthodox orientation (which begun under Vladimir I of Kiev and his grandmother Olga). Orlando Figes mentioned that &quot;Nevsky&#x27;s collaboration was no doubt motivated by his distrust of the West, which he regarded as a greater threat to Orthodox Russia than the Golden Horde (...) But Nevsky&#x27;s &quot;realpolitik&quot; caused a problem for the chroniclers, particularly after he was made a saint by the Russian Church in 1547, for in their terms he had colluded with the infidel.&quot;

Some of Alexander&#x27;s policies on the Western border were continued by his grandson-in-law, Daumantas of Pskov, who was also beatified in the 16th century. In the late 13th century, a chronicle was compiled called the &quot;Life of Alexander Nevsky&quot; (Житие Александра Невского), in which he is depicted as an ideal prince-soldier and defender of Russia.

On 21 May 1725, the empress Catherine I introduced the Imperial Order of St. Alexander Nevsky as one of the highest decorations in the land. During World War II, on 29 July 1942, the Soviet authorities introduced an Order of Alexander Nevsky to revive the memory of Alexander&#x27;s struggle with the Germans. There was also an earlier Bulgarian Order dedicated to Saint Alexander which was founded on 25 December 1881, which ceased to exist when the People&#x27;s Republic was declared on 16 September 1946.

In 1938, Sergei Eisenstein made one of his most acclaimed films, &quot;Alexander Nevsky&quot;, about Alexander&#x27;s victory over the Teutonic Knights. The soundtrack for the film was written by Sergei Prokofiev, who also reworked the score into a concert cantata. Today the film is renowned for its extraordinary battle on ice sequence, which has served as inspiration for countless other films. In the picture, Nevsky used a number of Russian proverbs, tying Nevsky firmly to Russian tradition. The famous proverbial phrase (paraphrasing Matthew 26:52), &quot;Whoever will come to us with a sword, from a sword will perish,&quot; is a phrase that is often attributed to Alexander Nevsky, though it was not in fact said by him; it comes from Eisenstein&#x27;s film, where it was said by actor Nikolai Cherkasov. A Soviet evaluation presented Alexander&#x27;s victories as having &quot;saved the Russian people from sharing the fate of the Baltic tribes and the Slavs of the Elbe who were enslaved by the Germans&quot;.

During World War II, the image of Alexander Nevsky became a national symbol of the struggle against German occupation, and many Soviet historians portrayed him as a Russian bastion against both German and papal aggression. The government sought historical continuity by referring to the Soviet struggle as the Great Patriotic War. The film &quot;Alexander Nevsky&quot; was re-released in 1941 following the German invasion; Joseph Stalin used the film to mobilize feelings of Russian patriotism.
Alexander Nevsky&#x27;s fame was spread wherever Imperial Russia had a strong influence; thus numerous cathedrals and churches were dedicated to him, including the Patriarchal Cathedral in Sofia, Bulgaria; the Cathedral church in Tallinn, Estonia; the Cathedral church in Łódź, Poland; the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral in Ungheni, Moldova.

There is a long tradition of Russian naval vessels bearing Nevsky&#x27;s name, such as the 19th-century propeller frigate &quot;Alexander Nevsky&quot; and &quot;K-550&quot; &quot;Alexander Nevsky&quot;, a nuclear powered ballistic missile submarine currently in service with the Russian Navy.

On 24 September 2008, Alexander Nevsky was declared the main hero of Russia&#x27;s history by popular vote, as reported by the &quot;Kommersant&quot; newspaper. In December 2008, he was voted the greatest Russian in the &quot;Name of Russia&quot; television poll.

During the 2021 Moscow Victory Day Parade, a small historical segment of the parade featured Russian soldiers dressed in historical M1945 Red Army uniforms carrying out the Soviet combat banners which received the Order of Alexander Nevsky during the war. This segment coincided with the 800th anniversary since the birth of Alexander Nevsky in 1221.

<text>Hans Peter Wilhelm Arp (; ; 16 September 1886 – 7 June 1966), better known as Jean Arp in English, was a German-French sculptor, painter and poet. He was known as a Dadaist and an abstract artist.

==Early life==
Arp was born Hans Peter Wilhelm Arp to a French mother and a German father in Strasbourg during the period between the Franco-Prussian War and World War I, when the city and surrounding region were under the control of the German Empire. Following the return of Alsace to France at the end of World War I, French law required Arp to adopt a French name, and he legally became Jean Arp, although he continued referring to himself as &quot;Hans&quot; when he spoke German.

==Career==

=== Dada ===
In 1904, after leaving the École des Arts et Métiers in Strasbourg, he went to Paris where he published his poetry for the first time. From 1905 to 1907, he studied at the Weimarer Kunstschule in Germany, where he met his uncle, German landscape painter Carl Arp. In 1908 he returned to Paris, where he attended the Académie Julian. Arp was a founder-member of the first modern art alliance in Switzerland Moderne Bund in Lucerne in 1911, participating in their exhibitions from 1911 to 1913.

In 1912 he went to Munich and called on Wassily Kandinsky, the influential Russian painter and art theorist. Arp was encouraged by him in his researches and exhibited with the Der Blaue Reiter group. Later that year, he took part in a major exhibition in Zürich, along with Henri Matisse, Robert Delaunay, and Kandinsky. In Berlin in 1913, he was taken up by Herwarth Walden, the dealer and magazine editor who was at that time one of the most powerful figures in the European avant-garde.

In 1915 he moved to Switzerland to take advantage of Swiss neutrality. Arp later told the story of how, when he was notified to report to the German consulate in Zürich, he pretended to be mentally ill in order to avoid being drafted into the German Army: after crossing himself whenever he saw a portrait of Paul von Hindenburg, Arp was given paperwork on which he was told to write his date of birth on the first blank line. Accordingly, he wrote &quot;16/9/87&quot;; he then wrote &quot;16/9/87&quot; on every other line as well, then drew one final line beneath them and, &quot;without worrying too much about accuracy&quot;, calculated their sum. Hans Richter, describing this story, noted that &quot;they [the German authorities] believed him.&quot;

It was at an exhibition that year where he first met the artist Sophie Taeuber who was to become his collaborator in the production of works of art and a significant influence on his artistic style and working method. They married on 20 October 1922.

In 1916 Hugo Ball opened the Cabaret Voltaire, which was to become the centre of Dada activities in Zürich for a group that included Arp, Marcel Janco, Tristan Tzara, and others. In 1920, as Hans Arp, along with Max Ernst and the social activist Alfred Grünwald, he set up the Cologne Dada group. In 1925 his work also appeared in the first exhibition of the Surrealist group at the Galérie Pierre in Paris.

=== The Henri Bergson Influence ===
In 1926 Arp moved to the Paris suburb of Meudon. In 1931 he broke with the Surrealist movement to found Abstraction-Création, working with the Paris-based group Abstraction-Création and the periodical, &quot;Transition&quot;. Beginning in the 1930s the artist expanded his efforts from collage, assemblage (&quot;Trousse d&#x27;un Da&quot;, 1921) and bas-relief to include bronze and stone sculptures. He produced several small works made of multiple elements that the viewer could pick up, separate, and rearrange into new configurations.
Throughout the 1930s and until the end of his life, he wrote and published essays and poetry. In 1942 he fled from his home in Meudon to escape German occupation and lived in Zürich until the war ended.

=== Success ===
Arp visited New York City in 1949 for a solo exhibition at the Buchholz Gallery, and this coincided with a general international recognition of his work. In 1950 he was invited to execute a relief for the Harvard University Graduate Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and would also be commissioned to do a mural at the UNESCO building in Paris. Arthur and Madeleine Lewja, of Galerie Chalette, who had known Arp in Europe, became his gallery representatives in New York in the late 1950s, and were instrumental in establishing his reputation on the American side of the Atlantic.

In 1958, a retrospective of Arp&#x27;s work was held at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, followed by an exhibition at the Musée National d&#x27;Art Moderne in Paris in 1962. In 1972, the Metropolitan Museum of Art showcased Jean Arp&#x27;s work from the Lejwa&#x27;s collection and a few works lent by Arp&#x27;s widow, Marguerite Arp. The exhibition was expanded and traveled as &quot;Arp 1877–1966,&quot; first exhibited at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and then shown in seven museums in the United States and six in Australia. Organized by the Minneapolis Institute of Arts and the Wurttembergischer Kunstverein of Stuttgart, a 150-piece exhibition titled &quot;The Universe of Jean Arp&quot; concluded an international six-city tour at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art in 1986.

==Personal life and death==
Arp and his first wife, the Swiss artist Sophie Taeuber-Arp, became French nationals in 1926. In the 1930s they bought a piece of land in Clamart and built a house at the edge of a forest. Influenced by the Bauhaus, Le Corbusier and Charlotte Perriand, Taeuber designed it. She died in 1943 in Zürich, where they had moved to escape the German occupation of France, from accidental carbon monoxide poisoning. After living in Zürich, Arp was to make Meudon his primary residence again in 1946.

In 1959 Arp married the collector Marguerite Hagenbach (1902–1994), his long-time companion. He died in 1966, in Basel, Switzerland.

==Legacy==
There are three Arp foundations in Europe: The Fondation Arp in Clamart preserves the atelier where Arp lived and worked for most of his life; about 2,000 visitors tour the house each year. The Fondazione Marguerite Arp-Hagenbach in Locarno, Switzerland, was founded by Arp&#x27;s second wife, Marguerite Arp-Hagenbach. A foundation dedicated to Arp, named Stiftung Hans Arp und Sophie Taeuber-Arp e.V., was established in 1977 by the dealer Johannes Wasmuth in consultation with Marguerite Arp-Hagenbach and owns the largest collection of works by Arp and holds the copyright of all his works. It has research centre and office in Berlin, and an office in Rolandseck, Germany.

The Musée d&#x27;art moderne et contemporain of Strasbourg houses many of his paintings and sculptures.

*Gorodomlya G-1 - Developed by a German team at Gorodomlya island (57°12&#x27;0.06&quot;N, 33° 4&#x27;0.02&quot;E) in 1948, based on the V-2 with detachable warhead and integral propellant tanks. (a.k.a. R-10).
*Gorodomlya G-1M - The G-1 with a more powerful engine proposed in 1949.
*Gorodomlya G-2 - (a.k.a. R-12) Developed as far as preliminary design the G-2 first stage was to have been powered by a cluster of three engines from the G-1 with a thrust of approx 100tons, the second stage being capable of delivering the warhead 2,000 to 2,500 kilometres. Insurmountable problems with control of the second stage forced abandonment.
*Gorodomlya G-3 - The G-3 project was to have been a two-stage, G-1 derived rocket, with a winged upper stage similar to the A9 developed by Wernher Von Braun&#x27;s team at Peenemünde, for a projected range of 8,000 to 10,000 kilometres
*Gorodomlya G-4 - In April 1949 the Gorodomlya group were given the same requirements as the team at NII-88 (which produced the R-3). The German group designed a 24m (78 ft 9in) tall cone shaped rocket with an empty weight (including a three-ton warhead) of seven tons and a launch weight of 70.85 tons, (a.k.a. R-14).
*Gorodomlya G-5 - Designed in parallel with the G-4, (a.k.a. R-15), another group at Gorodomlya proposed a ramjet powered unmanned bomber boosted by a G-1 or A4 rocket, cruising at altitude for a range of 3,000 kilometres.

Today his son, Ron Winchell oversees racing stable and breeding operation known as Winchell Thoroughbreds which is located at Corinthia Farm near Lexington, Kentucky. The Winchells were co-owners of 2017 American Horse of the Year Gun Runner. The Winchells won the 2014 Kentucky Oaks and Breeders&#x27; Cup Distaff with their homebred US Champion Three-Year-Old Filly Untapable, the 2012 Breeders&#x27; Cup Dirt Mile with Tapizar, and 2005 Kentucky Oaks with Summerly.

<text>John Benson Sebastian(born March 17, 1944) is an American singer, songwriter and musician who founded the rock band the Lovin&#x27; Spoonful in 1964 with Zal Yanovsky. During his time in the Lovin Spoonful, John would write and sing some of the band&#x27;s biggest hits such as &quot;Do You Believe in Magic&quot;, &quot;Did You Ever Have to Make Up Your Mind&quot;, and &quot;Daydream&quot;. Sebastian would leave the Spoonful in 1968 after the album &quot;Everything Playing&quot;. After leaving the Spoonful, Sebastian would focus on a solo career, releasing his first solo album in 1970 titled &quot;John B. Sebastian&quot;. Sebastian would continue on recording solo albums.

He made an impromptu appearance at the Woodstock festival in 1969 and scored a U.S. No. 1 hit in 1976 with &quot;Welcome Back&quot;, which was used as the theme song on the sitcom &quot;Welcome Back, Kotter&quot;.

Sebastian was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2000 as a member of the Lovin&#x27; Spoonful.

==Early life==
Sebastian was born in New York City and grew up in Little Italy and Greenwich Village. His father, John Sebastian ( John Sebastian Pugliese), was a noted classical harmonica player, and his mother, Jane (born Mary Jane Bishir), was a radio script writer. His godmother was Vivian Vance (&quot;Ethel Mertz&quot; of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;), who was a close friend of his mother. His godfather and first babysitter was children&#x27;s book illustrator Garth Williams, a friend of his father. Eleanor Roosevelt was a neighbor who lived across the hall.

Sebastian grew up surrounded by music and musicians, including Burl Ives and Woody Guthrie, and hearing such players as Lead Belly and Mississippi John Hurt in his own neighborhood. He graduated from Blair Academy, a private boarding school in Blairstown, New Jersey, in 1962. He next attended New York University for just over a year, but dropped out as he became more interested in musical pursuits.

==Early career==
In the early 1960s, Sebastian developed an interest in blues music and in playing harmonica in a blues style, rather than the classical style of his father. Through his father&#x27;s connections, he met and was influenced by blues musicians Sonny Terry and Lightnin&#x27; Hopkins (for whom Sebastian served as &quot;unofficial tour guide and valet&quot; when Hopkins was in New York City). Sebastian became part of the folk and blues scene that was developing in Greenwich Village, which in part later gave rise to folk rock.

In addition to harmonica, Sebastian played guitar and occasionally autoharp. One of Sebastian&#x27;s first recording gigs was playing guitar and harmonica for Billy Faier&#x27;s 1964 album &quot;The Beast of Billy Faier.&quot; He also played on Fred Neil&#x27;s album &quot;Bleecker &amp; MacDougal&quot; and Tom Rush&#x27;s self-titled album in 1965. He played in the Even Dozen Jug Band and in the Mugwumps, which split to form the Lovin&#x27; Spoonful and the Mamas &amp; the Papas. Bob Dylan invited him to play bass on his &quot;Bringing It All Back Home&quot; sessions (though Sebastian&#x27;s parts probably did not appear on the album) and to join Dylan&#x27;s new electric touring band, but Sebastian declined in order to concentrate on his own project, the Lovin&#x27; Spoonful.

==The Lovin&#x27; Spoonful==


Sebastian was joined by Zal Yanovsky, Steve Boone, and Joe Butler in the Spoonful, which was named after &quot;The Coffee Blues,&quot; a Mississippi John Hurt song. The Lovin&#x27; Spoonful, which blended folk-rock and pop with elements of blues, country, and jug band music, became part of the American response to the British Invasion, and was noted for such hits as &quot;Do You Believe in Magic&quot;, &quot;Jug Band Music&quot;, &quot;You Didn&#x27;t Have to Be So Nice&quot;, &quot;Daydream&quot;, &quot;Did You Ever Have to Make Up Your Mind?&quot;, &quot;Summer in the City&quot;, &quot;Rain on the Roof&quot;, &quot;Nashville Cats&quot;, &quot;Darling Be Home Soon&quot;, and &quot;Six O&#x27;Clock&quot;.

The band, however, began to implode after a 1966 marijuana bust in San Francisco involving Yanovsky, a Canadian citizen. Facing deportation, he revealed the name of his dealer to police, which caused a fan backlash and added to the internal tension already created by the diverging interests of the band members. Neither Sebastian nor Butler were involved in the matter, both being away from San Francisco at the time. Yanovsky subsequently left the band and was replaced by Jerry Yester, after which the band&#x27;s musical style veered away from its previous eclectic blend and became more pop-oriented.

Sebastian would reunite with the band in 1980 and appear in the film &quot;One-Trick Pony&quot;. He would later be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2000, this was the last time Sebastian would play with the original line up. 

In 2020 Sebastian reunited with Lovin Spoonful members Joe Butler and Steve Boone.

==Solo career 1960s–1970s==

===Broadway musical composer===
One of Sebastian&#x27;s first projects after leaving the Spoonful was composing the music and lyrics for a play with music, &quot;Jimmy Shine&quot;, written by Murray Schisgal. It opened on Broadway in December 1968, with Dustin Hoffman in the title role, and ran until April 1969, for a total of over 150 performances. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Sebastian wrote a stage musical adaptation of E.B. White&#x27;s &quot;Charlotte&#x27;s Web&quot; in consultation with his godfather Garth Williams, who illustrated White&#x27;s original book. The proposed musical included 20 songs, some of which Sebastian performed in concert, but the musical was never produced.

===Woodstock appearance===

In August 1969, Sebastian made an unscheduled appearance at Woodstock. He traveled to the festival as a spectator, but was asked to appear when the organizers suddenly needed an acoustic performer after a rain break because they couldn&#x27;t set up amps on stage for Santana until the water was swept off. Sources that have tried to reconstruct the Woodstock running order differ on the exact time and position of Sebastian&#x27;s unplanned set, with some stating that he played on Saturday, August 16, immediately after Country Joe McDonald; others saying that on that Saturday, Santana followed McDonald and Sebastian appeared after Santana; and still others, including McDonald, recalling that Sebastian actually played on Friday, August 15, at some point after Richie Havens opened the festival.

Sebastian&#x27;s Woodstock set consisted of three songs from his recorded but not yet released &quot;John B. Sebastian&quot; album (&quot;How Have You Been&quot;, &quot;I Had a Dream&quot;, and &quot;Rainbows All Over Your Blues&quot;) and two Lovin&#x27; Spoonful songs (&quot;Darling Be Home Soon&quot; and &quot;Younger Generation&quot;, which he dedicated to a newborn baby at the festival). Documentary remarks by festival organizers indicated that Sebastian was under the influence of marijuana or other psychedelic drugs at the time, hence his spontaneity and casual, unplanned set. Sebastian has confirmed in later interviews that he was a regular marijuana user at the time and had taken acid at Woodstock because he was not scheduled to perform. However, he has also noted that &quot;there was a natural high there [at Woodstock],&quot; and that &quot;[i]n an interview it is the easy thing to say &#x27;yeah, I was really high,&#x27; but it was actually a very small part of the event. In fact, I had a small part of some pill that someone gave me before I went on stage, but it wasn&#x27;t a real acid feeling.&quot; Sebastian appeared on the original and in the documentary film. Twenty-five years later, he returned for Woodstock &#x27;94, playing harmonica for Crosby, Stills and Nash and appearing with his own band, the J-Band.

In September 1969, a month after Woodstock, Sebastian performed a similar set of solo and Spoonful material at the 1969 Big Sur Folk Festival and was featured in the subsequent documentary &quot;Celebration at Big Sur&quot; (1971).

===Major-label solo recordings===
In January 1970, Sebastian released the first in a series of solo LPs on Reprise Records (a label owned by Warner Bros. Records), his eponymous solo debut, &quot;John B. Sebastian&quot;, on which he was accompanied by various Los Angeles musicians including Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash. It was Sebastian&#x27;s highest-charting solo album, reaching No. 20 in the Billboard album charts. In a contract dispute with MGM Records, MGM, without authorization from Sebastian or his management, also released the &quot;John B. Sebastian&quot; album, under a different cover, and a live album, &quot;John Sebastian Live&quot;; both were later withdrawn from the market. Sebastian&#x27;s second Reprise album, &quot;Cheapo Cheapo Productions Presents Real Live John Sebastian&quot;, was hastily recorded in an effort to provide an authorized live album.

For his third Reprise album, &quot;The Four of Us&quot; (1971), Sebastian used a core backing band consisting of keyboardist Paul Harris, drummer Dallas Taylor and bassist Kenny Altman. He considered forming a permanent band with them, but Harris and Taylor chose to join Stephen Stills&#x27;s band Manassas. In 1972, Sebastian also released a non-LP single, &quot;Give Us a Break&quot; b/w &quot;Music for People Who Don&#x27;t Speak English&quot;, which did not chart. On his next album, &quot;Tarzana Kid&quot; (1974), Sebastian returned to using a rotating group of well-known recording artists and session musicians, including Lowell George (who also co-wrote, with Sebastian, the album track &quot;Face of Appalachia&quot;), Phil Everly, Emmylou Harris, the Pointer Sisters, David Grisman, Russell DaShiell, Ry Cooder and Buddy Emmons. Sebastian, George and Everly also briefly considered forming a supergroup but abandoned the idea.

Sebastian has stated that his musical career suffered in the early 1970s from being out of step with the trends set by emerging artists such as Alice Cooper, and that he made more money by buying and selling real estate than he did from his music. After &quot;Tarzana Kid&quot; failed to chart, Sebastian sought a release from his Reprise contract, which required him to make one more album. However, in 1976, Sebastian had an unexpected No. 1 single with &quot;Welcome Back&quot;, the theme song to the sitcom &quot;Welcome Back, Kotter&quot;, causing the label to rush the production of an album, also titled &quot;Welcome Back&quot;. Despite the &quot;monster hit&quot; status of the song &quot;Welcome Back&quot;, Sebastian expressed frustration that Reprise did not do more to promote the associated album, his last for Reprise. His later albums have been released primarily on independent record labels. The song, Sebastian&#x27;s only top-40 solo hit, found new life 28 years later when a sample from it became the hook for rapper Mase&#x27;s 2004 hit &quot;Welcome Back&quot;.

In 2001, Rhino Entertainment re-released all five of Sebastian&#x27;s Reprise albums, plus the non-LP &quot;Give Us a Break&quot; single, on CD in a limited-edition box set entitled &quot;Faithful Virtue: The Reprise Recordings&quot;. The box set also included live recordings of Sebastian&#x27;s entire Woodstock performance and six previously unreleased songs recorded in mono from a performance at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco on October 4, 1969. In 2006, Sebastian&#x27;s five Reprise albums were reissued as individual CDs by Collectors&#x27; Choice Music, with new liner notes by Richie Unterberger.

===Session work===
During the 1960s and 1970s, Sebastian guested on a number of recordings by other artists. He played harmonica with the Doors on the song &quot;Roadhouse Blues&quot; (from the album &quot;Morrison Hotel&quot;), under the pseudonym G. Pugliese to avoid problems with his contract and to avoid association with Jim Morrison, who was then facing trial on charges of lewd behavior after the Miami concert incident. He also appeared on two Doors live albums, playing on &quot;Little Red Rooster&quot; on &quot;Alive, She Cried&quot; and on seven songs on &quot;Live in Detroit&quot;. Both albums were later re-released, remastered, and repackaged into one single album, &quot;In Concert&quot;, and included Morrison&#x27;s introduction of Sebastian to the stage on the &quot;Little Red Rooster&quot; track.

Sebastian is credited with playing three instruments on the 1970 Gordon Lightfoot album, &quot;Sit Down Young Stranger&quot; (Reprise RS 6392). He played autoharp on &quot;Saturday Clothes&quot;, electric guitar on &quot;Baby It&#x27;s Allright&quot;, and harmonica on &quot;The Pony Man&quot;. The album was later retitled &quot;If You Could Read My Mind&quot; when the song of that name unexpectedly became a major hit.

Sebastian is credited with playing harmonica on Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young&#x27;s song &quot;Déjà Vu&quot; from the album of the same name. He had previously been asked by Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash to join their group as a fourth member, but turned them down, leading to their association with Neil Young. In 1977 he recorded as part of Artie and Happy Traum&#x27;s Woodstock Mountain Revue (a.k.a. Woodstock Mountains) folk collaboration for the album &quot;More Music From Mud Acres&quot;. Other records on which Sebastian appeared include the album &quot;Stephen Stills&quot; (1970), Timothy Leary&#x27;s album &quot;You Can Be Anyone This Time Around&quot; (1970) (on which Sebastian jammed with Jimi Hendrix), and Keith Moon&#x27;s only solo album, &quot;Two Sides of the Moon&quot; (1975). He also played the autoharp instrumental break between the second and third verses of Randy VanWarmer&#x27;s 1979 hit &quot;Just When I Needed You Most&quot;.

==Later career==

Since the 1980s, Sebastian has been active in several music-related areas, not only writing and performing his own material but also performing roots music, developing soundtrack and instructional material, hosting and appearing on television programs, and writing a children&#x27;s book about a harmonica-playing bear.

===Live performances===
Sebastian left the Lovin&#x27; Spoonful in 1968 and did not play with any later versions of the band, except for a brief reunion with the other three original members to appear in Paul Simon&#x27;s 1980 film &quot;One-Trick Pony&quot;, and again for a single performance at their Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony in 2000.

Sebastian has continued to tour and play live, both solo and with a variety of backing bands. He had a long association with the eclectic rock band NRBQ, dating back to the early 1980s, when he played on NRBQ&#x27;s album &quot;Grooves in Orbit&quot; (1983). He has said that NRBQ &quot;to a large extent, picked up where The Lovin&#x27; Spoonful left off&quot; because of NRBQ&#x27;s &quot;wide range of musical styles that they&#x27;re not only able but accurate at playing,&quot; and he expressed appreciation for NRBQ&#x27;s support during a low point in his career. In turn, Sebastian helped NRBQ by using them on his own Nelvana and Disney Channel soundtrack projects during a period when litigation prevented them from recording. Sebastian has used NRBQ as his own backing band, appeared regularly at their concerts, and recorded frequently with the band members, and NRBQ founding member Terry Adams refers to Sebastian as an &quot;honorary member&quot; of the band. Although he performed Lovin&#x27; Spoonful songs solo and with NRBQ (who were themselves promoted in the 1980s as &quot;the new Lovin&#x27; Spoonful&quot;), he declined to reunite with several former Spoonful members in 1991.

Throughout the 1990s, Sebastian frequently appeared with the J-Band, a jug band including Fritz Richmond from the Jim Kweskin Jug Band, jug band pioneer Yank Rachell, Jimmy Vivino, and Geoff Muldaur. Sebastian and the J-Band were featured in &quot;Chasin&#x27; Gus&#x27; Ghost&quot; (2007), a documentary about the roots and influence of jug band music. The film screened in August 2007 at the San Francisco Jug Band Festival (where Sebastian performed with other musicians featured in the film, including Geoff Muldaur, Maria Muldaur, Jim Kweskin and David Grisman) and made its film festival debut in October 2007 at the Woodstock Film Festival. In the film Sebastian humorously explains (with musical accompaniment) how his song, &quot;Younger Girl&quot;, was inspired by Gus Cannon&#x27;s &quot;Prison Wall Blues.&quot;

Sebastian&#x27;s live performances in the 2000s have included performing as a trio with country blues duo Paul Rishell and Annie Raines in 2002; touring with Maria Muldaur and her Garden of Joy jug band in 2009; and occasional appearances with mandolinist David Grisman, with whom Sebastian played in the Even Dozen Jug Band in the 1960s and more recently collaborated on a CD album release, &quot;Satisfied&#x27;. In 2008 he performed solo, but with Roger McGuinn of the Byrds in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Each would play songs solo, but alternate their sets with each other.

===Record releases===
After leaving Reprise, Sebastian continued to occasionally release CD albums through a variety of small labels. Although a number of these releases consisted of compilations or live performances of his older material from the 1960s and 1970s, some, such as &quot;Tar Beach&quot; (Shanachie, 1993) and &quot;Satisfied&quot; (with David Grisman) (Acoustic Disc, 2007) have contained significant new recordings. &quot;Tar Beach&quot; in particular contained eleven previously unreleased songs written or co-written by Sebastian; four songs were composed by the team of Sebastian and songwriter Phil Galdston, with whom Sebastian also collaborated on the score for the Sig Shore-directed feature film &quot;The Act&quot; (1984). According to Colin Larkin, Sebastian had written many of the songs that appeared on &quot;Tar Beach&quot; more than a decade prior to the album&#x27;s release. Two later releases, &quot;I Want My Roots&quot; (Music Masters, 1996) and &quot;Chasin&#x27; Gus&#x27; Ghost&quot; (Hollywood, 2000), focused on Sebastian&#x27;s work with the J-Band.

===Soundtrack work===
Sebastian is a frequent contributor to film and TV soundtracks. In particular, he has written and performed music for a number of children&#x27;s films and TV productions. He wrote the music and provided the singing voice of &quot;Daniel Mouse&quot; for the Canada-based Nelvana animated television special &quot;The Devil and Daniel Mouse&quot; (1978) about two mice attempting to succeed in the music business. He supplied music for several more Nelvana productions, including &quot;Strawberry Shortcake: Housewarming Surprise&quot; (1983), &quot;Strawberry Shortcake Meets the Berrykins&quot; (1985), &quot;The Care Bears Movie&quot; (1985), &quot;The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland&quot; (1987), and &quot;Care Bear Countdown&quot;, the theme song for Nelvana&#x27;s &quot;The Care Bears Family&quot; TV series. He also wrote and sang the theme song/narration for Nelvana&#x27;s TV pilot &quot;The Get Along Gang&quot;; however, none of it was kept when DIC Entertainment took over the project. He wrote and performed the theme song of the KNBC syndicated children&#x27;s program &quot;That&#x27;s Cat&quot; (1976–1979), and hosted a 1986 Disney Channel family special entitled &quot;What a Day for a Daydream&quot;.

===Television presenter===
Since the 1980s, Sebastian has hosted several television programs about 1960s and 1970s music, including paid programs for compilation sets, a syndicated live music and interview program called &quot;Deja View&quot;, and a half-hour program called &quot;The Golden Age of Rock and Roll,&quot; which featured video footage of 1960s bands performing on variety shows. He also hosted a Lovin&#x27; Spoonful retrospective broadcast on PBS in March 2007, talking about various Spoonful numbers in between vintage video clips of the band up to the time he left.

===Children&#x27;s book author===
In 1993, Sebastian authored a children&#x27;s book, &quot;JB&#x27;s Harmonica&quot;, illustrated by his godfather Garth Williams, about a young bear whose musical aspirations are overshadowed by the talents of his famous musician father.

===Instructor at Homespun Tapes===
Sebastian has released a series of instructional DVDs, CDs, downloads, booklets, and (prior to the use of digital media) analog tapes for learning to play guitar, harmonica, and autoharp, or for learning specific styles or songs. These instructional materials are distributed by Homespun Tapes, a company founded and operated by folk musician Happy Traum. Materials offered with Sebastian as an instructor have included &quot;An Easy Guide to Tuning Your Guitar&quot;, &quot;John Sebastian Teaches Eight Lovin&#x27; Spoonful Hits (and &quot;Welcome Back&quot;)&quot;, &quot;John Sebastian Teaches Blues Harmonica&quot;, &quot;Learn to Play Autoharp&quot;, and &quot;The Fingerpicking Blues of Mississippi John Hurt: A Spoonful of Classic Songs&quot;.

===Other appearances and activities===

In November 1992, Sebastian made a cameo appearance on the sitcom &quot;Married... with Children&quot; (Season 7, Episode 9, &quot;Rock of Ages&quot;) as himself, along with other 1960s rock stars Spencer Davis, Richie Havens, Robby Krieger, Mark Lindsay, and Peter Noone.

Sebastian appeared on the Eels&#x27; 2005 release, &quot;Blinking Lights and Other Revelations&quot;.

On January 12, 2014, Sebastian appeared on &quot;CBS News Sunday Morning&quot; to talk about his career with and without the Lovin&#x27; Spoonful, Eric Clapton, and the Martin guitar.

In 2016, Sebastian appeared on Richard Barone&#x27;s &quot;Sorrows &amp; Promises: Greenwich Village in the 1960s&quot; album, playing harmonica, autoharp and making a vocal cameo on Barone&#x27;s cover of the Lovin&#x27; Spoonful song &quot;Did You Ever Have to Make Up Your Mind?&quot;

==Influence and legacy==

Sebastian is a notable songwriter whose work has been covered by many artists, including Elvis Costello (&quot;The Room Nobody Lives In&quot;), Johnny Cash (&quot;Darlin&#x27; Companion&quot;), and Del McCoury (&quot;Nashville Cats&quot;). Several songs have also spawned multiple covers, including:
* &quot;Lovin&#x27; You&quot; – covered by Dolly Parton, Helen Reddy, and Bobby Darin;
* &quot;Stories We Could Tell&quot; – covered by the Everly Brothers, Tom Petty, and Jimmy Buffett;
* &quot;Darling Be Home Soon&quot; – covered by Joe Cocker, the Association, Slade, Cass Elliot, Bruce Hornsby, Allison Crowe, and others.

Sebastian is also credited with helping to popularize the art of tie-dyeing clothing among music fans and festival goers in the late 1960s, by publicly appearing in outfits that he tie-dyed himself after learning the process from Ann Thomas of Water Baby Dye Works. His tie-dyed yellow patterned denim jacket, which he dyed himself and wore at Woodstock, has been prominently displayed in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

&quot;Stories We Could Tell&quot;, the title of a novel by British writer Tony Parsons, comes from the Sebastian song of the same name.

==Awards and honors==
As an original member of the Lovin&#x27; Spoonful, Sebastian was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2000.

He was also inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2008.

==Personal life==

Sebastian has been married three times. His first wife was Jean &quot;Butchie&quot; Webber (later known as Butchie Denver after she married actor Bob Denver). According to Steve Boone, Butchie was an early supporter and friend of the Lovin&#x27; Spoonful and secretly married Sebastian in the early 1960s to reduce his chances of being drafted for service in the Vietnam War. The couple divorced in 1966. That same year, Sebastian married Loretta &quot;Lorey&quot; Kaye, a waitress at Steve Paul&#x27;s The Scene who later worked for &quot;Hit Parader&quot; magazine; they divorced in 1968.

In 1972, Sebastian married Catherine Barnett, a photographer and artist who has designed numerous album covers. The couple has two children, and they have lived together in Woodstock, New York, since 1976.

Since the early 1990s, Sebastian has struggled with throat problems that eventually affected and changed his singing voice, but he has continued to perform and tour.

== Solo discography==
===Original studio and live albums===
===Original U.S. singles===

Much of Sebastian&#x27;s material, especially his 1970s Reprise albums and the 1996 &quot;King Biscuit Flower Hour&quot; live recording, has been reissued and/or repackaged many times; therefore, this table is selective. Sebastian has also released various formats and packages of long-playing instructional materials for Homespun Tapes, which are not included in this table.
===Contributions to &quot;various artists&quot; albums===
This table lists songs written or performed by Sebastian that were originally released on — and in many cases, are only available on — compilations or collaborations with various artists, including but not limited to soundtrack albums. Contributions as a guest on albums released under the name of a specific artist or group are not included.

<text>Elfquest (or ElfQuest) is a comic book property created by Wendy and Richard Pini in 1978, and still owned by them. It is a fantasy story about a community of elves and other fictional species who struggle to survive and coexist on a primitive Earth-like planet with two moons. Several published volumes of prose fiction also share the same setting. &quot;Elfquest&quot; was one of the first comic book series to have a planned conclusion. Over the years &quot;Elfquest&quot; has been self-published by the Pinis through their own company Warp Graphics, then Marvel Comics, then the Pinis again, more recently DC Comics, and, since 2013, Dark Horse Comics. All issues of &quot;Elfquest&quot; published prior to 2014 are available online for free.

==Publication history==
The first &quot;Elfquest&quot; story, &quot;Fire and Flight&quot;, appeared in February 1978 in the underground comic book &quot;Fantasy Quarterly&quot;, published by Lansing, Michigan-based IPS (Independent Publishers Syndicate). That company closed after publishing the first issue of &quot;Elfquest&quot;. Sandwiched between the two parts of the &quot;Elfquest&quot; story was a brief story written by T. Casey Brennan and illustrated by Cerebus the Aardvark creator Dave Sim titled &quot;Doorway to the Gods&quot;. The quality of the publication was disappointing to Wendy and Richard Pini. The interior was printed on newsprint, and the cover was printed, in a limited color palette, on only slightly heavier, uncoated paper stock.

===WaRP Graphics===

The poor quality of this publication convinced the Pinis that they could produce a higher quality publication on their own. After borrowing money in order to start WaRP Graphics, the Pinis started publishing with &quot;Elfquest&quot; #2. It was printed magazine-size with glossy full-color covers and a character portrait print on the back cover by Wendy, a format that continued throughout the series&#x27; entire run. This story continued the &quot;Elfquest&quot; tale started in &quot;Fantasy Quarterly&quot;. Later, the Pinis&#x27; company WaRP Graphics reprinted the story from &quot;Fantasy Quarterly&quot; as &quot;Elfquest&quot; #1 with a new front cover and full-color portrait print for the rear cover.

This series was one of the early successes that marked the establishment of a phase in underground comics in which a new genre of alternative independent comic books emerged that were closer in content to mainstream comics. &quot;Elfquest&quot; was also one of the first comic book series that had a prearranged conclusion. It was highly praised for its innovative themes. The fact that a female artist/writer (Wendy Pini) was the creative principal of the series was also notable.

The original series – generally referred to as &quot;The Original Quest&quot; or &quot;OQ&quot; – ran for 20 magazine-size issues (spanning about seven to eight years in terms of the main storyline), released three times a year. Color compilations followed, published by the Donning Company under its Starblaze imprint as Books 1-4. Two more series were published in a reduced comic book-size format, but still in black and white: &quot;Siege at Blue Mountain&quot; (8 issues) and &quot;Kings of the Broken Wheel&quot; (9 issues), later collected and published in color by Warp Graphics under its Father Tree Press imprint as part of a second edition of the graphic novels as Books 5-8. The stories take place three years after the original quest.

===Warp Graphics explosion and implosion===
In the 1990s, the Pinis rebranded slightly (WaRP became Warp) and then began to publish multiple titles concurrently, many with overlapping storylines, showcasing the work of new artists and writers on the series. The (initially) color titles &quot;New Blood&quot;, &quot;Hidden Years&quot;, and &quot;Shards&quot; for the most part carried the main storyline forward from the prehistoric to the medieval period of the World of Two Moons (now named Abode), occasionally featuring non-canonical stories. The historical background of the Wolfriders was filled out in &quot;Blood of Ten Chiefs&quot;, &quot;Two-Spear&quot;, and &quot;Kahvi&quot;. The future of Abode was explored in &quot;The Rebels&quot; and &quot;Jink&quot;, set at a time when humans have reached space and colonized other worlds and the elves have all but disappeared. A fifth tribe of elves, the WaveDancers, was introduced only to be redacted from continuity. A one-shot issue re-introduced the sea elves with a new cast of characters. The first ten issues of &quot;Hidden Years&quot; were collected in two color volumes, &quot;Hidden Years&quot; and &quot;Rogue&#x27;s Challenge&quot; (Book 9 in the continuity of the second edition of graphic novels). Selected stories from the first ten issues of &quot;New Blood&quot; were collected as &quot;New Blood&quot; and &quot;Bedtime stories&quot;. Towards the end of their runs, in the mid-1990s, most of these titles reverted to black and white in North America, though some were published in color in Europe.

In large part as a response to the shrinking direct market in the mid-1990s, continuing storylines were collapsed together into a single 64-page anthology series introduced by the one-shot &quot;Metamorphosis&quot;. The new series was simply titled &quot;Elfquest&quot; (Volume 2), and ran for 33 issues.

===Other media===
The series has also served as the basis for three novelizations (&quot;Journey to Sorrow&#x27;s End&quot;, &quot;The Quest Begins,&quot; and &quot;Captives of Blue Mountain&quot;) and five &quot;Blood of Ten Chiefs&quot; short story anthologies (some of which served as the basis of scripts in &quot;Blood of Ten Chiefs&quot; comic book series). The music CD &quot;A Wolfrider&#x27;s Reflections&quot; is an album of folk songs based on elements from the original quest. Several collectibles, calendars, apparel, a role-playing game, and figurines have been sold over the years. The full-length novel &quot;ElfQuest: Journey to Sorrows End&quot;, which included both text and several black-and-white illustrated plates, was published in &quot;Playboy&quot; in 1982, and by Berkley in March 1984.

===Marvel===
In 1985, the original series was republished by Marvel Comics&#x27; Epic imprint in 32 installments. Distributed on newsstands, this gave the series much-desired mass-market exposure. Because of Marvel&#x27;s 22-page format, these new editions featured additional bridging pages which broke the narrative at different points than in the original Warp comics, which contained 32 pages of story. Marvel&#x27;s license was only for the original series, which was already completed, so none of the sequels followed suit. Most of the additional material (bridging pages and panels) was incorporated into subsequent print collections and the online edition.

===DC Comics===

In March 2003, after 25 years of self-publication, the Pinis licensed all publishing and merchandising rights in the series to DC Comics, although the Pinis retained ownership and creative control.

DC&#x27;s publication of &quot;Elfquest&quot; material began in July 2003 with &quot;The Elfquest 25th Anniversary Special&quot;, reprinting the first issue of &quot;Elfquest&quot; with new computer coloring and lettering by Wendy Pini and two short interviews with the Pinis. This was a teaser for &quot;The Elfquest Archives&quot;, hardcover color compilation volumes which were released beginning in November. This series planned to reprint the first eight graphic novel collections in glossy format with new coloring and lettering. Fans complained that the publication schedule was disappointingly slow. Volume 2 was originally scheduled to appear in fall 2004 but after some delays was finally released in March 2005, 16 months after Volume 1. Part of the reason for the delay is that Wendy Pini was undergoing hip replacement surgery.

Meanwhile, September 2003 saw the publication of &quot;Elfquest: Wolfrider Volume 1&quot;, beginning a series of bimonthly manga-sized black-and-white reprint collections which arrange the story into chronological order for the first time, beginning around 600 years before the events in the original series. &quot;Wolfrider Volume 2&quot; is followed chronologically by &quot;Elfquest: The Grand Quest Volume 1&quot;, the first in a series reprinting the original storyline, including the additional art drawn for the Marvel version. In this series, the original artwork has been rearranged into new panel layouts for clarity in the physically smaller manga format, which sometimes involved Wendy Pini adding extensions to the original artwork. Some sections of the original artwork are not included, for example in &quot;ElfQuest: The Grand Quest Volume 11&quot;, a standalone story involving Tyleet and her adopted human son Little Patch is not in the volume, though later in Volume 13 Tyleet mentions Little Patch constantly while discussing the dream she had while encased for 10,000 years by the Preservers.

Another book, &quot;Elfquest: The Searcher and the Sword&quot;, was published in July 2004. Critical reaction was generally favorable; the major criticism leveled at the book is that it is overpriced for its size (96 pages).

After the four-issue comic series &quot;Elfquest: Discovery&quot;, published in 2006, no more new stories appeared until the &quot;Final Quest&quot;, beginning in 2012.

===Online release===
In March 2008, Warp Graphics began uploading previously published stories to . They intended to make the entire series available online over the course of 2008, but the issues proved too numerous to upload within the year. Uploading of all comics was completed in March 2009.

In September 2012, the latest series&#x27; &quot;Final Quest&quot; prologue story began publication at a rate of one page per week at Boing Boing. Only about half of the prologue appeared there, deliberately, as a teaser leading to the print and digital publication planned for 2013 by Dark Horse Comics.

===Final Quest===
In October 2013, &quot;Elfquest Special: The Final Quest&quot; was published as a one-shot by Dark Horse Comics. It included the material originally seen at Boing Boing plus the rest of the &quot;Final Quest&quot; prologue. The &quot;Final Quest&quot; series began publication by Dark Horse Comics, with the first issue released on January 22, 2014. The entire &quot;Final Quest&quot; series ran for 24 issues. The final issue, #24, was released on February 28, 2018, exactly 40 years after issue #1 of the &quot;Original Quest&quot; was first released.

===Stargazer&#x27;s Hunt===
In November 2019, a new series debuted from Dark Horse Comics. Titled &quot;Elfquest: Stargazer&#x27;s Hunt&quot;, the story focuses on Skywise.

==Background and setting==
The world in which the series takes place – eventually called Abode by its human inhabitants, but originally referred to as the World of Two Moons – superficially resembles Earth, with geography that is marginally similar. There are some unusual prehistoric survivals among the fauna, and in early storylines Abode could have been described as Earth with two moons, hence its original name. As the story moves forward and Abode&#x27;s history develops, it becomes apparent that its human culture and technology is distinguished by the twenty thousand years of influence by the elves, who have left an indelible mark on human society (though their existence is unacknowledged and unofficially suppressed by Abode&#x27;s world government).

The elves of &quot;Elfquest&quot; are descended from highly advanced humanoid aliens called High Ones by their descendants. When their homeworld&#x27;s natural resources became depleted due to overpopulation, they went spacefaring in order to find new planets to settle. Some of them returned to their dead homeworld, and ended up awakening their immense psycho-kinetic psychic powers and biological immortality. They eventually resumed spacefaring to explore the wider universe, using telekinesis to create egg-shaped vessels and pilot them to new worlds, adapting to any ecosystem by shifting their own shapes and metabolisms. As companions, they brought two of the last surviving animal species from their home, both of which gradually evolved during the journey (and subsequent events) into two more races of sapient near-immortals: the insectoid Preservers and the simian-descended Trolls.

After journeying to many different worlds, one of these vessels came to Abode (known to its inhabitants as the World of Two Moons), where human civilization had reached a level that was almost identical to Europe&#x27;s medieval period on Earth. Observing the humans, the High Ones saw the humans&#x27; artwork and literature depicted angels, deities, spirits and other ethereal beings which suggested to the High Ones that others of their kind had previously visited that world. In order to facilitate contact with the humans, before landing on the world, the High Ones deliberately formed themselves like elves and reshaped their egg-vessel to resemble a beautiful floating castle that matched the native architectural idiom, so that they could stay long enough to seek out more information about the previous visitors. The palace itself consists of two main parts: the magical material of which it is made, and two magic scrolls that contain all the history of the High Ones. The palace is also where the souls of dead elves come together to spend the rest of their existence.

Also by this time, the evolved simians (proto-Trolls) had become resentful of their subservient status and wished to permanently remain on the world. As the High Ones began to make the &#x27;castle&#x27; descend, the simians violently rebelled, disrupting the High Ones&#x27; telekinetic controls enough to hurl the entire vessel and its contents back through time to Abode&#x27;s paleolithic era. Staggering out from the crash-landing, the High Ones found that their psychic powers were greatly weakened on Abode, leaving many of them unable to defend themselves from the prehistoric cave-dwelling humans who fearfully attacked them. Forcibly dispersed away from the massacre outside of the palace-shaped vessel, many of the initial elf survivors soon died, unable to adapt to the new, hostile environment; the others gradually gathered into several widely scattered tribes. The known tribes include (in order of introduction) the Wolfriders (forest-dwelling hunter-gatherers), Sun Folk (desert-dwelling farmers), Gliders (mountain-dwellers, only a few of whom hunt), Go-backs (formerly hunters, now primarily reindeer herders), and the Wavedancers (sea-dwelling hunter-gatherers). The High Ones&#x27; evolved-simian servants also fled, mainly into networks of caverns where they became larger and established themselves as the subterranean race of Trolls, treasure-seeking miners and metalsmiths whose original links to the High Ones were forgotten.

The main story begins 10,000 years later, with elves and other beings having adapted with great difficulty to their home. Each tribe of elves has its own set of adaptations and traditions, and most of them are unaware that any of the other tribes even exist.

== Cast ==
===The Wolfriders===
The central characters are the Wolfrider elves, a tribe of ferocious hunter/warriors closely allied with wolves who serve as mounts, hunting partners, and friends. Their culture is roughly comparable to the Iroquois Native American nation. Within their founder group, a female High One named Timmain had been the only member to retain her shape-shifting ability. When winter came, Timmain shape-shifted into a wolf to hunt food for the starving elves around her. She sank deeply into her wolf-form and eventually forgot her original identity, even mating with a native wolf to produce a half-wolf chimeric son whom she handed over to the Elves after teaching him as much as she could as a wolf. They gave him the name Timmorn Yellow-Eyes and he became the first Chief of the Wolfriders, bringing the wolf pack and the stranded elves together to form a close symbiotic alliance. Because of his mixed blood, Timmorn was mortal, unlike his progenitors. Timmorn then went on to sire many children, with both wolves and elves; as a result, the entire tribe and their bonded wolf pack can all trace their bloodline back to Timmorn in some way by the point at which the series begins. This mingling of wolf and elf blood produces unexpected results; aside from maintaining a feral, wolf-like mentality (known as the Way), the Wolfriders are the only elves who can, eventually, die of old age. In addition to the close bonds with their wolves, the Wolfriders also have some basic psychic powers like telepathy (known as &quot;sending&quot;), healing, and plant manipulation. Because of the hybridization, their wolves also possess powers of telepathy, allowing Wolfriders to &quot;send&quot; with their wolves.

The central storyline, beginning with the series known as the &quot;Grand Quest&quot; or &quot;Original Quest&quot;, focuses on the tribe during the leadership of their eleventh chief Cutter. At the start of the story, the Wolfriders&#x27; regular forest life – intermittently interspersed by conflict with superstitiously genocidal humans – is lost when the humans set fire to the forest in retaliation for a previous battle.

The Wolfriders seek refuge in the caverns of their sullen, greedy, cowardly trade partners, the trolls. The elves claim that the trolls owe them sanctuary because of all the ways the Wolfriders have helped them over the years, but the corrupt troll king, Greymung, feels humiliated for being held at knifepoint by an elf and plots revenge. The elves are taken down a long tunnel toward what the trolls claim will be a land of bright promise, but is actually a trackless desert. Then their guide seals the tunnel behind them. Desperately inspired by a piece of &quot;magic&quot; lodestone they obtained from the trolls&#x27; caves that acts as a crude compass, they make an arduous journey across the wasteland until they encounter an oasis called Sorrow&#x27;s End, populated by a tribe of sedentary, agrarian elves called the Sun Folk.

===The Sun Folk===
Compared to the Wolfriders, the peaceful Sun Folk have retained more knowledge about the High Ones. In turn, there are some psychic phenomena which have remained more common among the Wolfriders than among the Sun Folk, such as sending and &quot;Recognition&quot;, a powerful involuntary compulsion to mate with another elf; this mating is guaranteed to produce offspring who are more powerful than either parent. This powerful impulse can be resisted with difficulty, but at the cost of great personal stress. If the two individuals are not temperamentally compatible, they may part ways again as soon as a child has been produced, but otherwise they may form a lifelong pair-bond as &quot;lifemates&quot;.

Cutter&#x27;s partner in Recognition is the Sun Folk&#x27;s beautiful and powerful healer, Leetah. She initially rejects him as a savage barbarian, especially since she is already partnered to her village&#x27;s haughty chief hunter, Rayek. The love triangle between Cutter, Leetah, and Rayek is the main focus of much of the first part of the story. Cutter and Leetah eventually become lifemates; bested by Cutter in a ritual trial and displaced as sole hunter and protector by the Wolfriders, Rayek leaves the village.

Once this conflict is resolved, the two tribes quickly unite with each side willing to adjust to the other for their mutual benefit. The Wolfriders enjoy the benefits of a more sophisticated culture with greater knowledge, while the Sun Folk benefit from a band of strong hunters and defenders of their desert refuge from humanity.

Six years later, the oasis sanctuary of Sorrow&#x27;s End is breached by a handful of starving humans who approach the oasis. Although they are sent on their way (probably to die of thirst), Cutter realizes that more could follow and decides to take action. He goes on a quest with his soul-brother, Skywise, seeking other elf tribes as allies against humanity. Later, Cutter&#x27;s son, Suntop, receives a warning from the Sun Folk&#x27;s elder Savah, The Mother of Memory, about an evil which Cutter must avoid. Savah, who is close to being a High One herself, possesses a magical ability known as &quot;going out&quot;, where her spirit leaves her body in attempts to connect to other Elves. In this way she was also able to briefly contact Rayek after he left Sorrow&#x27;s End. The majority of the Wolfriders escort Leetah, Suntop, and his twin sister Ember on their journey to deliver Savah&#x27;s warning to Cutter and Skywise.

===The Gliders===
Continuing their quest, Cutter and Skywise learn of the existence of another elf tribe dwelling in a place called Blue Mountain. This previously unknown tribe, consisting of tall, thin, graceful elves, is known as the Gliders. They treated humans like any other prey, until a human shaman made her way near the peak of Blue Mountain and sang and talked to them. The Gliders then agreed not to hunt humans, if they in turn received offerings and worship. The humans then worshiped them as &quot;spirit-gods&quot;.

The Gliders claim to be original High Ones and are nominally led by an ancient elf named Lord Voll. He wanted them to have a safe home, thus their rockshapers built a home inside Blue Mountain after the memories of the Palace of the High Ones. After Lord Voll&#x27;s lover and confidant Winnowill created the Chosen Eight, a group of hunters that rode the Giant Hawks that nested in Blue Mountain – no one but those hunters left the mountain. They are a conservative community that has degenerated into insular decadence, dominated by the seductive, sinister Winnowill, who was once Voll&#x27;s consort but who now has her own agenda.

Cut off from new impulses, the Gliders&#x27; culture turned in on itself. They created intricate art, such as the Egg of Six Spheres, which recorded the elves&#x27; history, but stopped growing. For millennia no children were born. Some of the rockshapers were put into permanent trance, and do nothing but fulfill a certain function. Winnowill manipulated Voll so that his plans to leave Blue Mountain again never grew to fruition. Lord Voll came to believe that the elves were doomed to wither, and that there would never be any children born. Only the arrival of the Wolfriders with their children and the Preservers could wake him up. He was then determined to return to the Palace of the High Ones as soon as possible, but was killed before reaching it, leaving Winnowill as new Lord of the Gliders.

The Gliders rarely venture out of their mountain except for the Chosen Eight, the tribe&#x27;s hunters and (if need be) warriors. Although they have their own powers of psychic levitation, the Eight ride massive birds with whom they share a strong bond, similar to that of the Wolfriders and their wolves. As the Wolfriders search for Cutter and Skywise, Strongbow shoots down one of the massive birds for food. Enraged at the death of their mount, the Gliders attack the Wolfriders and imprison most of the tribe within Blue Mountain. Winnowill then tortures Strongbow for the death of the bird, while Leetah, Ember, and Suntop hide in the Forbidden Grove which is the home of the Preservers. Nightfall and Redlance also manage to escape imprisonment, and stumble upon Cutter and Skywise shortly after Cutter and his family are re-united. One-Eye, also not captured, lurks around the base of the mountain surviving on the humans&#x27; unknown generosity.

Dewshine, much to the dismay of her tribe (and herself), becomes Recognized by one of the Gliders named Tyldak, who has been reshaped by Winnowill to resemble a bird himself. Both fight the Recognition at first, but eventually give in and Dewshine becomes pregnant.

Winnowill puts all Gliders but the Chosen Eight into deep sleep, and attempts to use their magic powers to shape Blue Mountain into a vessel to leave the World of Two Moons. This plan is foiled by the Wolfriders. The already re-shaped Blue Mountain shatters, and nearly all Gliders are killed; as a people and a tribe, the Gliders no longer exist.

What follows is a difficult but enlightening journey, in which the elves&#x27; most basic assumptions about the world are turned upside down as they meet humans who are more good than they ever hoped, elves more evil than they ever imagined, and trolls more aggressive than they ever feared. Throughout these adventures, Cutter and his companions learn about the world and themselves in profound ways.

===The Go-Backs===
The Go-Backs are the fourth and last Elf tribe encountered during the Original Quest. Originally a migrating tribe, the Go-Backs are named after a sudden desire to &quot;go back&quot; to the Palace of the High Ones. The Palace has a strong pull on all elves once in range, and the Go-Backs were the first to stumble on it since the High Ones were driven away. First appearing to save Cutter and his followers from a war party of trolls in a snow-bound tundra, the Go-Backs are arctic-dwelling elk-herders, bearing about the same resemblance to the Sámi as the Wolfriders do to the Iroquois and the Sun Folk to Mesoamericans (that is to say, mainly in costume). They are highly warlike and hardened, being locked in continual strife with the trolls who bar their way to the Palace. They have a prejudice against magic, but not to the extent of persecuting its users. The Go-Backs, so removed from magic, no longer rely on Recognition to procreate. They provided the bulk of the military strength that allowed the completion of the first quest, and lost half their numbers in doing so.

===The High Ones===
The High Ones were an advanced race, resembling the aliens known as Greys; they were stranded on Abode after their ship, the Palace, was sabotaged from within and crash-landed. There are few, if any, known High Ones remaining on Abode, though they live on in their descendants, the Elves, Trolls, and Preservers.

==Contributing artists and writers==
Various artists and writers have contributed to &quot;Elfquest&quot; over the years, including the following, as listed on the &quot;Elfquest Reader&#x27;s Collection&quot; page.

==Adaptations==

Besides an unofficial homage in Marvel&#x27;s &quot;X-Men&quot; #153 (Kitty Pryde wears an &quot;Elfquest&quot; T-shirt throughout the issue, and a sprite named &quot;Pini&quot; appears on p.16), &quot;Elfquest&quot; has been adapted into a range of media. A scene from &quot;Elfquest&quot; between Cutter and Leetah in Sun Village was also performed as part of a theater rehearsal in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #242.

While not an adaptation in the strictest sense of the term, Piers Anthony&#x27;s 13th &quot;Xanth&quot; novel &quot;Isle of View&quot; introduces a character named Jenny Elf, a Wolfrider who was magically brought to Xanth from Abode after a tragic accident. Jenny Elf, by the author&#x27;s own admission, is a tribute to a young girl who was paralyzed by a drunk driver. Jenny Elf continues to be a character in subsequent &quot;Xanth&quot; novels. Warp Graphics published the first volume of a graphic novel adaptation of &quot;Isle of View&quot; entitled &quot;Return to Centaur&quot;.

===Film===
In 1982, the Pinis were in talks with Nelvana to produce an animated film based on the story, which was contemplated to open after issue #20&#x27;s anticipated release in late 1984. While described as being in the &quot;very early planning stages&quot;, nothing further was ever mentioned about this project.

The Pinis signed a development deal with film producer Edward Pressman in 1994, with Jeremiah Chechik planned as the director.

In 2008, Warner Bros. considered to adapt &quot;Elfquest&quot; saga to the big screen, with Rawson Thurber serving as writer and director. The format (live action, CGI, or traditional animation) is unknown. &quot;Elfquest&quot;″s official Facebook page later confirmed that Warner Bros. ultimately said &quot;no&quot;; the ostensible reason was that Warner Bros. did not want the film to compete with their film &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. In 2013 there were rumors of recapping the project on behalf of the producers of a fanmade trailer which appeared a few years prior.

===Animated video series===
In the early 1990s, an ad for a multi-volume animated adaptation of &quot;Elfquest&quot; appeared in the comic. A few issues later, the Pinis told readers they&#x27;d withdrawn from the deal, and that readers should ask for refunds. Those who did not eventually received a 50-minute VHS tape from Abby Lou Entertainment, copyrighted from 1992. Covering the first volume of the book, it consists of color still images taken straight from the comic, some minor animation, and spoken dialogue. The animated video is available for free on the official ElfQuest website.

===Web trailer===
Stephanie Thorpe and Paula Rhodes produced a short web trailer entitled &quot;Elfquest: A Fan Imagining&quot;. The Pinis donated original art for the fundraising campaign, and lent an original dress to the production. The short premiered at the Screen Actors Guild in April 2011 and the cast featured Taryn Southern, Casey McKinnon, Jessica Lee Rose, and more.

===Role-playing games===
A licensed tabletop &quot;Elfquest&quot; role playing game was produced by Chaosium in 1984, utilizing the Basic Role-Playing system which had first appeared in the game &quot;RuneQuest&quot; and some original illustrations by Wendy Pini, including the character sheets.

Both the role-playing game and the comics themselves have inspired a number of online games (mostly MUSHes).

===Toys===
A line of action figures was briefly produced, featuring Cutter, Leetah (with a small Petalwing figurine), Picknose, and Tyldak. A proposed second series that would have included Skywise, among others, never reached production.

===Board games===
Two board games featuring the &quot;Elfquest&quot; world have been published.

In 1986, Mayfair Games released &quot;ElfQuest&quot;, a competitive game where players lay tiles to build the board as the game proceeds. Players play one of four elf tribes as they try to find the elf homeland, or as the troll tribe that tries to prevent the elf players from finding the homeland long enough until they can &quot;build a dome&quot; over it.

In 2015, Cheeky Dingo games released the &quot;ElfQuest Adventure Game&quot;, a cooperative board game, where the players take four elven characters on a campaign of adventures based on stories from the comic books. The game was funded via Kickstarter.

===Music===
In 1987, Off Centaur Publications released &quot;A Wolfrider&#x27;s Reflections: Songs of Elfquest&quot;, a collection of filk songs. In 2013, several unreleased &quot;Elfquest&quot; songs by Julia Ecklar were also included on her solo album, &quot;Horsetamer&quot;.

===Starfire===
One particular anecdote was the creation of a mission insignia for one of the experiments taken aloft by Space Shuttle Columbia with mission STS-87, which was dubbed &#x27;Enclosed Laminar Flames&#x27;, abbreviated to ELF, in 1997. As the &quot;Elfquest&quot; series was quite popular in those days, Dennis Stoker, who sponsored and managed the experiment and a huge fan of the series, asked Wendy Pini to contribute to the experiment in designing an insignia. The result is a circular insignia depicting the experiment, holding the names of the primary contributors (including the University of Iowa), set against a dark blue, star-spangled background and a unique elven character, wearing a green-and-black suit with star motifs accompanying the experiment. The character, dubbed &quot;Starfire&quot;, became a first in space – no comic book-style character had been created in connection with a spaceflight mission, let alone actually traveled to space. Wendy Pini was particularly proud of this work.

=== ElfQuest: The Audio Movie ===
In 2021, the Pinis began to develop an audio movie production via live stream focusing on the first five issues of the original comic book series. The full-cast audio drama was developed with Dagaz Media and The Fantasy Network (TFN), using crowdfunding that allowed fans to directly support Pinis where they were able to mantain their independent voice and vision for the project without corporate changes.

Two crowdfunding pledge campaigns, one with TFN and the other through Kickstarter, were both successful, raising over $300,000. Pre-production commenced that June. Over 40 cast members were attached, including: Alejandro Saab as Cutter, Cree Summer as Savah, Amber Benson as Nightfall, Osric Chau as Skywise, Zehra Fazal as Moonshade, Hugo Pierre Martin as Redlance, Will Friedle as Strongbow, Divinity Roxx as Leetah, Pun Bandhu as Rayek, Robert Picardo as Picknose, Aaron Douglas as Treestump, Clare Kramer as Clearbrook/Rainsong, Jonathan M. Woodward as One-Eye/Woodlock, Nicole Maines as Dewshine, Thomas Trinh as Scouter, Ray Porter as Spirit Man/King Greymung, Yasha Jackson as Shenshen, Tim Russ as Sun Toucher, Abie Ekenezar as Ahdri, Jeffrey Vincent Parise as Bearclaw, Lisa Coronado as Joyleaf, and David Mizejewski as Rain. Wendy herself did a cameo as the background character commonly referred to as &quot;the Baker&quot;.

<text>Zsa Zsa Gabor (, ; born Sári Gábor ; February 6, 1917 – December 18, 2016) was a Hungarian-American socialite and actress. Her sisters were socialites and actresses Eva Gabor and Magda Gabor.

Gabor competed in the 1933 Miss Hungary pageant, where she placed as second runner-up, and began her stage career in Vienna the following year. She emigrated from Hungary to the United States in 1941, and became a sought-after actress with &quot;European flair and style.&quot; She was considered to have a personality that &quot;exuded charm and grace&quot;. Her first film role was a supporting role in &quot;Lovely to Look At&quot;, released in 1952. The same year, she appeared in &quot;We&#x27;re Not Married!&quot;, and played one of her few leading roles in &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot;, directed by John Huston. Huston later described Gabor as a &quot;creditable&quot; actress.

Outside her acting career, Gabor was known for her extravagant Hollywood lifestyle, her glamorous personality, and her many marriages. In total, Gabor had nine husbands, including hotel magnate Conrad Hilton and actor George Sanders. She once stated, &quot;Men have always liked me and I have always liked men. But I like a mannish man, a man who knows how to talk to and treat a woman—not just a man with muscles.&quot;

==Early life ==
Zsa Zsa Gabor was born Sári Gábor on February 6, 1917, in Budapest, Hungary, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The middle of three daughters, her parents were Jolie (née Janszieka Tillemann) and Vilmos Gábor (né Grün),&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes/vilmos-81&quot;&gt;
*
*
*&lt;/ref&gt; owner of a jewellery shop&lt;ref name=&quot;encyclopedia/gabors&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; store in Budapest,&lt;ref name=&quot;fdrlibrary/wrb0210&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; a Royal Hungarian Army officer. Her parents were both of Jewish ancestry.

Gabor was named after Sári Fedák, an actress. Gabor was called ZsaZsa because, as a little girl, she couldn&#x27;t pronounce her own name.

In 1941, Gabor left Hungary for the United States. During a layover at Eppley Airfield in Omaha, Nebraska en route to Hollywood, she made headlines by telling the Associated Press that she had danced with Adolf Hitler twice.

On July 8, 1944, aided by Gabor&#x27;s husband, Conrad Hilton,&lt;ref name=&quot;dday-overlord/8-july-1944&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Gabor&#x27;s parents fled Budapest during the Nazi invasion and occupation of Hungary.

Gabor&#x27;s elder sister, Magda, later became an American socialite and her younger sister, Eva, became an American actress and businesswoman. The Gabor sisters were first cousins of Annette Lantos, wife of California Congressman Tom Lantos (D-CA).

==Career==


In January 1933, following her time as a student at a Swiss boarding school, Gabor placed second runner-up in the fifth Miss Hungary pageant, behind Lilly Radó and crown winner Júlia Gál. On August 31, 1934, she sang the soubrette role in Richard Tauber&#x27;s operetta, &quot;Der singende Traum&quot; (&quot;The Singing Dream&quot;), at the Theater an der Wien in Vienna. This would mark her first stage appearance.

In 1944, she co-wrote a novel with writer Victoria Wolf entitled &quot;Every Man For Himself&quot;. According to Gabor, the fictional story was derived, in small part, from Gabor&#x27;s life experiences. The book was subsequently bought by an American magazine. In 1949, Gabor declined an offer to play the leading role in a film version of the classic book &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot;. According to the &quot;Cedar Rapids Gazette&quot;, she turned down the role of Lady Chatterley due to the story&#x27;s controversial theme.

Her more serious film acting credits include &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot;, &quot;Lovely to Look At&quot;, and &quot;We&#x27;re Not Married!&quot;, all from 1952, and 1953&#x27;s &quot;Lili&quot;. In 1958, she ran the gamut of moviemaking, from &quot;Touch of Evil&quot; to the camp oddity &quot;Queen of Outer Space&quot;. Later, she appeared in such films as &quot;Won Ton Ton, the Dog Who Saved Hollywood&quot; (1976) and &quot;Frankenstein&#x27;s Great Aunt Tillie&quot; (1984). She did cameos for &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors&quot; (1987), &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; (1993), and &quot;A Very Brady Sequel&quot; (1996), as well as voicing a character in the animated &quot;Happily Ever After&quot; (1989).

She was also a regular guest on television shows, appearing with Milton Berle, Jack Paar, Johnny Carson, Howard Stern, David Frost, Arsenio Hall, Phil Donahue, and Joan Rivers. She was a guest on the Bob Hope specials, the Dean Martin Roasts, &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;, &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot;, and &quot;It&#x27;s Garry Shandling&#x27;s Show&quot;.

In 1968, she appeared in the role of Minerva on an episode of &quot;Batman&quot;, becoming the show&#x27;s final &quot;special guest villain&quot; before it was cancelled. In 1973, she was the guest roastee on &quot;The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast&quot;.
She appeared on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; in 1987, where she told host David Letterman about her blind date with Henry Kissinger, which was arranged by Richard Nixon.

Author Gerold Frank, who helped Gabor write her autobiography in 1960, described his impressions of her:

In his autobiography, television host Merv Griffin, who was known to spend time with Gabor&#x27;s younger sister Eva socially, wrote of the Gabor sisters&#x27; arrival in New York and Hollywood: 
In 1998, film historian Neal Gabler called her kind of celebrity &quot;The Zsa Zsa Factor&quot;.

==Personal life==
Gabor was married nine times. She was divorced seven times, and one marriage was annulled. She wrote in her autobiography,
Her husbands, in chronological order, were:
# Burhan Belge (May 17, 1935December 4, 1941; divorced)
# Conrad Hilton (April 10, 1942 – October 28, 1947; divorced)
#:&quot;Conrad&#x27;s decision to change my name from Zsa Zsa to Georgia symbolized everything my marriage to him would eventually become. My Hungarian roots were to be ripped out and my background ignored. ... I soon discovered that my marriage to Conrad meant the end of my freedom. My own needs were completely ignored: I belonged to Conrad&quot;.
# George Sanders (April 2, 1949 – April 2, 1954; divorced)
# Herbert Hutner (November 5, 1962 – March 3, 1966; divorced)
#:&quot;Herbert took away my will to work. With his kindness and generosity, he almost annihilated my drive. I have always been the kind of woman who could never be satisfied by money – only excitement and achievement&quot;.
# Joshua S. Cosden Jr. (March 9, 1966 – October 18, 1967; divorced)
# Jack Ryan (January 21, 1975 – August 24, 1976; divorced)
# Michael O&#x27;Hara (August 27, 1976 – November 30, 1982; divorced)
# Felipe de Alba (April 13–14, 1983; annulled)
# Frédéric Prinz von Anhalt (August 14, 1986 – December 18, 2016; her death)

Gabor&#x27;s divorces inspired her to make numerous quotable puns and innuendos about her marital and extramarital history. She commented: &quot;I am a marvelous housekeeper: Every time I leave a man I keep his house.&quot; When asked how many husbands she had had, she used to say: &quot;You mean other than my own?&quot; Gabor dated German composer Willy Schmidt-Gentner, Turkish president Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, and Dominican diplomat Porfirio Rubirosa. She also claimed to have had a sexual encounter with her stepson, Nicky.

In 1973, Gabor purchased a nearly 9,000-square-foot Hollywood Regency-style home in Bel Air. It was originally built for Howard Hughes in 1955 and featured a copper French style roof.

Gabor&#x27;s only child, daughter Constance Francesca Hilton, was born on March 10, 1947. According to Gabor&#x27;s 1991 autobiography, &quot;One Lifetime Is Not Enough&quot;, her pregnancy resulted from rape by then-husband Conrad Hilton. She was the only Gabor sister who had a child. In 2005, a lawsuit was filed accusing Constance of larceny and fraud. She allegedly forged her mother&#x27;s signature to get a US$2 million loan by using her mother&#x27;s Bel Air house as collateral. However, the Los Angeles County Superior Court, Santa Monica, threw out the case due to Gabor&#x27;s failure to appear in court, or to sign an affidavit that she indeed was a co-plaintiff on the original lawsuit filed by her husband, Frédéric von Anhalt. Francesca Hilton died in 2015 at the age of 67 from a stroke. Gabor&#x27;s husband never told her about her daughter&#x27;s death, out of concern for her physical and emotional state.

Gabor and her last husband, Frédéric Prinz von Anhalt, adopted at least ten adult men who paid them a fee of up to $2 million to legally become descendants of Princess Marie-Auguste of Anhalt. Prinz von Anhalt had himself paid Marie-Auguste to adopt him when he was 36 years old.

While Gabor&#x27;s parents were Jewish, she was a practicing Catholic.

===Legal and financial difficulties===
On June 14, 1989, in Beverly Hills, California, Gabor was accused of slapping the face of Beverly Hills police officer Paul Kramer when he stopped her for a traffic violation at 8551 Olympic Boulevard. At trial three months later, a jury convicted her of slapping Kramer. They also found her guilty of driving without a license and possessing an open container of alcohol—a flask of Jack Daniel&#x27;s—in her $215,000 Rolls-Royce, but acquitted her of the charge of disobeying Kramer when she drove away from the traffic stop. On October 25, 1989, Beverly Hills Municipal Judge Charles G. Rubin sentenced Gabor to serve three days in jail, to pay fines and restitution totaling $12,937, to perform 120 hours of community service, and to undergo a psychiatric evaluation. On June 14, 1990, Gabor dropped her conviction appeal and agreed to serve her sentence. However, she refused to take part in community service and served three days in jail from July 27 to 30, 1990.

Gabor had a long-running feud with German-born actress Elke Sommer beginning in 1984 when both appeared on &quot;Circus of the Stars&quot;, and escalating into a multimillion-dollar libel suit by 1993. The suit resulted in an order for Gabor and her husband to pay Sommer $3.3 million in general and punitive damages.

On January 25, 2009, the Associated Press reported that her attorney stated that forensic accountants determined that Gabor may have lost as much as $10 million invested in Bernie Madoff&#x27;s company, possibly through a third-party money manager.

===Later life and health===
On November 27, 2002, Gabor was a front seat passenger in an automobile crash on Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles, from which she remained partially paralyzed and reliant on a wheelchair for mobility. She survived strokes in 2005 and 2007 and underwent surgeries. In 2010, she fractured her hip and underwent a successful hip replacement.

In August 2010, Gabor was admitted to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in serious condition and received last rites from a Catholic priest, but survived.

In 2011, her right leg was amputated above the knee to save her life from an infection. She was hospitalized again in 2011 for a number of emergencies, and fell into a coma.

On February 8, 2016, two days after her 99th birthday, Gabor was rushed to hospital after suffering from breathing difficulties. She was diagnosed with a feeding tube-related lung infection and was scheduled to undergo surgery to have her feeding tube removed.

In April 2016, it was reported that Prinz von Anhalt was arranging to move with Gabor to Hungary in time for her 100th birthday in 2017, in accordance with her wishes that she return to the country and spend the rest of her life there.

==Death==
While in a coma, Gabor died from cardiac arrest at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center on December 18, 2016, at the age of 99. On her death certificate, coronary artery disease and cerebrovascular disease are listed as contributing causes. She had been on life support for the previous five years.

Her funeral was held on December 30 in a Catholic ceremony at the Church of the Good Shepherd in Beverly Hills, where around 100 mourners attended. Her ashes, placed in a gold rectangular box, were interred at the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery; in July 2021, Prinz von Anhalt had them reinterred in the artists&#x27; section of Kerepesi Cemetery in Budapest in order to fulfil her wish to return to Hungary. He said that the remains were transported in their own first-class airline seat.

<text>Commodore User, (also referred to as CU) later renamed to &quot;CU Amiga&quot;, is a British magazine initially published by Paradox Group before being acquired by EMAP.

==Timeline==
&quot;Commodore User&quot; was launched in October 1983 with an initial preview issue in June 1983. Initially, the magazine contained information about in-depth computer information of its time, such as programming tutorials, machine code features, and business software reviews. The first issues were produced and written by editor Dennis Jarrett, writer and future editor Bohdan Buciak, and editorial assistant Nicky Chapman. Features were written by a range of contributors, and the issue sizes grew rapidly from 64 to 96 pages.

The first 12 issues of Commodore User were published by Paradox Group until September 1984; thereafter, publishing was handled by EMAP until the final issue in February 1990. Game coverage began to appear by the second issue. This consisted of a small section called Screen Scene from issue three. In 1985, the Commodore 64 became more popular. The amount of technical coverage decreased as gaming coverage increased. The circulation began to rise, and &quot;CU&quot; produced more color through the magazine. At the height of the C64&#x27;s success, &quot;CU&quot; had a page count of 116.

In 1986, &quot;CU&quot; began to cover the new 16-bit computer: the Amiga. The magazine covered all the Commodore platforms, from the C16 to the Amiga. Circulation figures also showed an all-time high of over 70,000 for the 1988 period.

To establish that the magazine content was changing to include the Amiga platform, the magazine changed its title to &quot;CU Commodore User Amiga-64&quot; in the February 1989 issue. The &quot;Commodore User&quot; part was dropped quickly, and the name became &quot;CU Amiga-64&quot;. This period of the magazine was a transitional time between transferring coverage from C64 to the Amiga.

==&quot;CU Amiga&quot;==
In 1990, &quot;CU Amiga-64&quot; removed the &quot;64&quot; from its name and relaunched it as &quot;CU Amiga with&quot; the March 1990 issue. The magazine gained circulation as a result of the internationalization.

In late 1994, the Amiga&#x27;s popularity was declining. &quot;CU Amiga&quot; had a final name change to help distinguish itself from other competing magazines in an increasingly small market. It became &quot;CU Amiga Magazine (from October 1990)&quot;. In its remaining years under the control of editor Tony Horgan, the magazine became highly technical. Some staff from sister magazine &quot;The One&quot; were moved to CU when the former closed in July 1995 and provided games coverage for CU readers. &quot;THE ONE AMIGA you have known and loved is not dead, but It has changed somewhat. The previous writers and publishers have moved on to better things, and the magazine now lies in entirely new hands, at Maverick Magazines. So we&#x27;ll take to opportunity to welcome all the original readers of The One to the new Maverick Edition, and to point out to them the new address.&quot;

The final issue was released in October 1998. &quot;CU Amiga Magazine&quot;″s closure meant that the only remaining monthly Amiga newsstand magazine was its closest rival, &quot;Amiga Format&quot;.

A year after &quot;CU&quot;″s closure in October 1999, the magazine &quot;Amiga Active&quot; was launched. It had several of the same staff and was competition for &quot;Amiga Format&quot;, which it ultimately outlived, by being published until November 2001.

<text>Sarah Hope Slean (born June 21, 1977) is a Canadian singer-songwriter, composer and musician. She has released eleven albums to date (including EPs and live albums). She is also a poet, visual artist, and occasional actress.

==Career==
===Major recordings===
Slean recorded her first EP &quot;Universe&quot; (1997) at the age of nineteen. It was followed by &quot;Blue Parade&quot; in 1998. &quot;Night Bugs&quot; was her first major label album, co-produced by Slean and Hawksley Workman, and released by WEA in Canada and Atlantic Records in the United States. It was heavily inspired by cabaret music. Slean composed all the string and horn arrangements for these albums - by hand in traditional notation.
On 28 September 2004, Slean released her fourth album, &quot;Day One&quot;. Here Slean&#x27;s piano takes a less important spot for the first time in her career. The focus is more on beats, rhythms and guitar, which is evident in the album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Lucky Me&quot;. The up-tempo title track &quot;Day One&quot;, and &quot;Mary&quot;, a song about Slean&#x27;s grandmother, were released as the second and third singles. Slean was first introduced to VS orchestral libraries and MIDI sequencing on this album, and composed all the orchestral accompaniments.
In October 2006, Slean released a mostly-live album, &quot;Orphan Music&quot;, which consists of songs recorded live at Toronto&#x27;s Harbourfront Theatre and the Vancouver East Cultural Centre. Other new tracks featuring Slean and the piano were recorded at DNA Recording Facility in Toronto and Kensaltown Studios in the UK.

On 13 December 2007, Slean&#x27;s website underwent a massive overhaul in preparation for her newest studio album, entitled &quot;The Baroness&quot;. Visitors to the new site were invited to sign up for Slean&#x27;s new mailing list, and in doing so would be able to download a demo version of her newest single, &quot;Get Home&quot;. People who pre-ordered the new album from the new website&#x27;s store also received a download to the non-album track &quot;Parasol&quot;. &quot;The Baroness&quot; was released on 11 March 2008. The iTunes version of the album included two additional non-album tracks, &quot;The Rose&quot; and &quot;The Lonely Side of the Moon.&quot; In September 2008, Slean announced her intention to release the non-album tracks from &quot;The Baroness&quot; as an EP. Both Parasol and Modern Man have been confirmed by Slean in Question and Answer sessions in her official website. On 13 November 2008, the official Sarahslean.com newsletter announced the title for the EP to be &quot;The Baroness Redecorates&quot;. A full track list was also provided.

Slean released her fifth studio album, a double album entitled &quot;Land &amp; Sea&quot;, on 27 September 2011. As previously with &quot;Beauty Lives&quot;, a 100 special handcrafted editions were sold of the album. &quot;Land &amp; Sea&quot; is also Slean&#x27;s first record to be released on vinyl. Sarah composed the orchestral arrangements for three songs and her mentor Jonathan Goldsmith arranged three others .
Slean&#x27;s studio album &quot;Metaphysics&quot; was released in April 2017. A pre-order campaign for the album was held on PledgeMusic.

===Other music work===
In 2006, she contributed two covers (&quot;Us and Them&quot; and &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot;) to &quot;Pink Floyd Redux&quot;, a modern 12-track tribute to Pink Floyd.

Another notable cover in Slean&#x27;s repertoire is her down-tempo rendition of Our Lady Peace&#x27;s guitar-driven song &quot;Julia&quot;. Our Lady Peace has performed Slean&#x27;s &quot;piano&quot; version of their song in their own concerts. Vocalist Raine Maida explained the origins of the piano version: &quot;We’re gonna do a song from our first record now, that was given to us on a cassette tape, a very different version, from a girl named Sarah Slean from Toronto...&quot;

Slean was also featured on the Fox TV network as the pianist in Sunrise, the fictional town where bodies started piling up in &quot;Murder in Small Town X&quot;, a short-lived reality TV series.

In October 2008, Slean performed at the first annual Canwest Cabaret Festival in Toronto. Slean performed sets of her own music accompanied by bassist Joe Phillips and drummer Mark Mariash, and also contributed to multi-artist &quot;songbook&quot; performances of the songs of Leonard Cohen and Kurt Weill.

In March 2009, Slean took part in the Juno Songwriter&#x27;s Circle in Vancouver, alongside fellow songwriters Jim Cuddy, Jacob Hoggard (of Hedley), Doc Walker, Buffy Saint-Marie, Vancouver upstart Ndidi Onukwulu, and Hawksley Workman, who hosted. She played two songs from &quot;The Baroness&quot;, &quot;Notes from the Underground&quot; and &quot;Looking for Someone&quot;.

In 2009 she took part in an interactive documentary series called City Sonic. The series, which featured 20 Toronto artists, had her talk about performing at the Rivoli while attending the University of Toronto.

On 18 April 2011, Slean chose a song called &quot;New Pair of Eyes&quot; from &quot;Land&quot;, to be included on the compilation album &quot;Songs of Love for Japan&quot;. She described the song as an &quot;ode to the shocking wonder of existence&quot;. &quot;Songs of Love for Japan&quot; was available for only 3 days, with all proceeds going toward relief efforts in the aftermath of the earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan on 11 March 2011.

==Personal life==
Slean was born in Pickering, Ontario. She attended Dunbarton High School in Pickering. After initially studying music at York University, she completed a degree in music and philosophy at the University of Toronto.

In 2008, Slean and fellow singer-songwriter Royal Wood got engaged while in Paris; the pair married in 2009, and would divorce in 2013. In January 2014, Slean said she and Wood had &quot;parted ways as friends&quot;.

On November 7, 2020, Slean announced on her social media accounts that she was pregnant with a daughter. Slean gave birth to a baby girl named Abigail on March 11, 2021.

Writing obituaries for a local newspaper to keep the wolf from the door, coupled with the complete avoidance of his own mother&#x27;s death, universally rejected novelist Harvey Harris (Joseph May) is feeling more distanced than ever from the world and those who surround him. An attempt to ease his guilt leads Harvey to sneaking into the very funerals he writes about, where a chance meeting of a strong-willed woman named Mona Miller (Sarah Slean) will force Harvey to confront his greatest fears about loss and rejection and how to find a way to connect through the most severe forms of disconnection.
