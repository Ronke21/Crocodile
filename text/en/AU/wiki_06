<text>In linguistics, homonyms are words which are either &quot;homographs&quot;—words that have the same spelling (regardless of pronunciation)—or &quot;homophones&quot;—words that have the same pronunciation (regardless of spelling)—or both. Using this definition, the words &quot;row&quot; (propel with oars), &quot;row&quot; (a linear arrangement) and &quot;row&quot; (an argument) are homonyms because they are homographs (though only the first two are homophones); so are the words &quot;see&quot; (vision) and &quot;sea&quot; (body of water), because they are homophones (though not homographs).

A more restrictive and technical definition requires that homonyms be simultaneously homographs &quot;and&quot; homophones—that is, they have identical spelling &quot;and&quot; pronunciation but different meanings. Examples include the pair &quot;stalk&quot; (part of a plant) and &quot;stalk&quot; (follow/harass a person) and the pair &quot;left&quot; (past tense of &quot;leave&quot;) and &quot;left&quot; (opposite of &quot;right&quot;). 

A distinction is sometimes made between true homonyms, which are unrelated in origin, such as &quot;skate&quot; (glide on ice) and &quot;skate&quot; (the fish), and polysemous homonyms, or polysemes, which have a shared origin, such as &quot;mouth&quot; (of a river) and &quot;mouth&quot; (of an animal).

The relationship between a set of homonyms is called homonymy, and the associated adjective is homonymous, homonymic, or in Latin, equivocal. Additionally, the adjective &quot;homonymous&quot; can be used wherever two items share the same name, independent of how closely they are related in terms of their meaning or etymology. For example, the word &quot;once&quot; (meaning &quot;one time&quot;) is homonymous with the term for &quot;eleven&quot; in Spanish (&quot;once&quot;).

==Etymology==
The word &quot;homonym&quot; comes from the Greek ὁμώνυμος (&quot;homonymos&quot;), meaning &quot;having the same name,&quot; compounded from ὁμός (&quot;homos&quot;) &quot;common, same, similar&quot; and ὄνομα (&quot;onoma&quot;) &quot;name.&quot;

==Related terms==


Several similar linguistic concepts are related to homonymy. These include:

* Homographs (literally &quot;same writing&quot;) are usually defined as words that share the same spelling, regardless of how they are pronounced. If they are pronounced the same then they are also homophones (and homonyms) – for example, &quot;bark&quot; (the sound of a dog) and &quot;bark&quot; (the skin of a tree). If they are pronounced differently then they are also heteronyms – for example, &quot;bow&quot; (the front of a ship) and &quot;bow&quot; (a ranged weapon).
* Homophones (literally &quot;same sound&quot;) are usually defined as words that share the same pronunciation, regardless of how they are spelled. If they are spelled the same then they are also homographs (and homonyms); if they are spelled differently then they are also heterographs (literally &quot;different writing&quot;). Homographic examples include &quot;rose&quot; (flower) and &quot;rose&quot; (past tense of &quot;rise&quot;). Heterographic examples include &quot;to&quot;, &quot;too&quot;, &quot;two&quot;, and &quot;there&quot;, &quot;their&quot;, &quot;they’re&quot;. Due to their similar yet non-identical pronunciation in American English, &quot;ladder&quot; and &quot;latter&quot; do not qualify as homophones, but rather synophones or homoiophones.
* Heteronyms (literally &quot;different name&quot;) are the subset of homographs (words that share the same spelling) that have different pronunciations (and meanings). Such words include &quot;desert&quot; (to abandon) and &quot;desert&quot; (arid region); &quot;tear&quot; (to rip) and &quot;tear&quot; (a drop of moisture formed in one eye); &quot;row&quot; (to argue or an argument) and &quot;row&quot; (as in to row a boat or a row of seats – a pair of homophones). Heteronyms are also sometimes called heterophones (literally &quot;different sound&quot;).
*Polysemes are words with the same spelling and distinct but &quot;related&quot; meanings. The distinction between polysemy and homonymy is often subtle and subjective, and not all sources consider polysemous words to be homonyms. Words such as &quot;mouth&quot;, meaning either the orifice on one&#x27;s face, or the opening of a cave or river, are polysemous and may or may not be considered homonyms.
*Capitonyms are words that share the same spelling but have different meanings when capitalized (and may or may not have different pronunciations). Such words include &quot;polish&quot; (make shiny) and &quot;Polish&quot; (from Poland); &quot;march&quot; (walk in step) and &quot;March&quot; (the third month of the Year) and the pair: &quot;reading&quot; (using a book) and Reading (towns in, among other places, England).

==Further examples==

A homonym which is both a homophone and a homograph is fluke, meaning:
*A fish, and a flatworm.
*The end parts of an anchor.
*The fins on a whale&#x27;s tail.
*A stroke of luck.
These meanings represent at least three etymologically separate lexemes, but share the one form, fluke. Fluke is also a capitonym, in that Fluke Corporation (commonly referred to as simply &quot;Fluke&quot;) is a manufacturer of industrial testing equipment.

Similarly, a river bank, a savings bank, a bank of switches, and a bank shot in the game of pool share a common spelling and pronunciation, but differ in meaning.

The words bow and bough are examples where there are two meanings associated with a single pronunciation and spelling (the weapon and the knot); two meanings with two different pronunciations (the knot and the act of bending at the waist), and two distinct meanings sharing the same sound but different spellings (bow, the act of bending at the waist, and bough, the branch of a tree). In addition, it has several related but distinct meanings – a bent line is sometimes called a &#x27;bowed&#x27; line, reflecting its similarity to the weapon. Even according to the most restrictive definitions, various pairs of sounds and meanings of bow, Bow and bough are homonyms, homographs, homophones, heteronyms, heterographs, capitonyms and are polysemous.

*bow – a long stick with horse hair that is used to play certain string instruments such as the violin
*bow – to bend forward at the waist in respect (e.g. &quot;bow down&quot;)
*bow – the front of the ship (e.g. &quot;bow and stern&quot;)
*bow – a kind of tied ribbon (e.g. bow on a present, a bowtie)
*bow – to bend outward at the sides (e.g. a &quot;bow-legged&quot; cowboy)
*Bow – a district in London
*bow – a weapon to shoot projectiles with (e.g. a bow and arrow)

A lime can refer to a fruit or a material. A mold (mould) can refer to a fungus or an industrial cast.

The words &quot;there&quot;, &quot;their&quot;, and &quot;they&#x27;re&quot; are examples of three words that are of a singular pronunciation, have different spellings and vastly different meanings. These three words are commonly misused (or, alternatively, misspelled).

*there – &quot;The bow shot the arrow there,&quot; he said as he pointed.
*their – &quot;It was their bow and arrow.&quot; the Mother said.
*they&#x27;re – They&#x27;re not going to get to shoot the bow again after puncturing the tire (tyre) on Daddy&#x27;s car. (Contraction of They and Are.)

The words metal and mettle are polysemes and homophones, but not homographs.

== Homonyms in historical linguistics ==
Homonymy can lead to communicative conflicts and thus trigger lexical (onomasiological) change. This is known as &quot;homonymic conflict&quot;. This leads to a species of informal fallacy of thought and argument called by the latin name equivocation.

<text>In the economics study of the public sector, economic and social development is the process by which the economic well-being and quality of life of a nation, region, local community, or an individual are improved according to targeted goals and objectives.

The term has been used frequently in the 20th and 21st centuries, but the concept has existed in the West for far longer. &quot;Modernization&quot;, &quot;Westernization&quot;, and especially &quot;industrialization&quot; are other terms often used while discussing economic development. Historically, economic development policies focused on industrialization and infrastructure; since the 1960s, it has increasingly focused on poverty reduction.

Whereas economic development is a policy intervention aiming to improve the well-being of people, economic growth is a phenomenon of market productivity and increases in GDP; economist Amartya Sen describes economic growth as but &quot;one aspect of the process of economic development&quot;. 

==Definition and terminology==
The precise definition of economic development has been contested: while economists in the 20th century viewed development primarily in terms of economic growth, sociologists instead emphasized broader processes of change and modernization. Development and urban studies scholar Karl Seidman summarizes economic development as &quot;a process of creating and utilizing physical, human, financial, and social assets to generate improved and broadly shared economic well-being and quality of life for a community or region&quot;. Daphne Greenwood and Richard Holt distinguish economic development from economic growth on the basis that economic development is a &quot;broadly based and sustainable increase in the overall &quot;standard of living&quot; for individuals within a community&quot;, and measures of growth such as per capita income do not necessarily correlate with improvements in quality of life. The United Nations Development Programme in 1997 defined development as increasing people‟s choices. Choices depend on the people in question and their nation. The UNDP indicates four chief factors in development, especially human development, which are empowerment, equity, productivity, and sustainability.

Mansell and Wehn state that economic development has been understood by non-practitioners since the World War II to involve economic growth, namely the increases in per capita income, and (if currently absent) the attainment of a standard of living equivalent to that of industrialized countries. Economic development can also be considered as a static theory that documents the state of an economy at a certain place. According to Schumpeter and Backhaus (2003), the changes in this equilibrium state documented in economic theory can only be caused by intervening factors coming from the outside.

==History==
Economic development originated in the post-war period of reconstruction initiated by the United States. In 1949, during his inaugural speech, President Harry Truman identified the development of undeveloped areas as a priority for the West:

:&quot;More than half the people of the world are living in conditions approaching misery. Their food is inadequate, they are victims of the disease. Their economic life is primitive and stagnant. Their poverty is a handicap and a threat both to them and to more prosperous areas. For the first time in history, humanity possesses the knowledge and the skill to relieve the suffering of these people ... I believe that we should make available to peace-loving people the benefits of our store of technical knowledge to help them realize their aspirations for a better life… What we envisage is a program of development based on the concepts of democratic fair dealing ... Greater production is the key to prosperity and peace. And the key to greater production is a wider and more vigorous application of modem scientific and technical knowledge.&quot;

There have been several major phases of development theory since 1945. Alexander Gerschenkron argued that the less developed the country is at the outset of economic development (relative to others), the more likely certain conditions are to occur. Hence, all countries do not progress similarly. From the 1940s to the 1960s the state played a large role in promoting industrialization in developing countries, following the idea of modernization theory. This period was followed by a brief period of basic needs development focusing on human capital development and redistribution in the 1970s. Neoliberalism emerged in the 1980s pushing an agenda of free trade and removal of import substitution industrialization policies.

In economics, the study of economic development was born out of an extension to traditional economics that focused entirely on the national product, or the aggregate output of goods and services. Economic development was concerned with the expansion of people&#x27;s entitlements and their corresponding capabilities, such as morbidity, nourishment, literacy, education, and other socio-economic indicators. Borne out of the backdrop of Keynesian economics (advocating government intervention), and neoclassical economics (stressing reduced intervention), with the rise of high-growth countries (Singapore, South Korea, Hong Kong) and planned governments (Argentina, Chile, Sudan, Uganda), economic development and more generally development economics emerged amidst these mid-20th century theoretical interpretations of how economies prosper. Also, economist Albert O. Hirschman, a major contributor to development economics, asserted that economic development grew to concentrate on the poor regions of the world, primarily in Africa, Asia and Latin America yet on the outpouring of fundamental ideas and models.

It has also been argued, notably by Asian and European proponents of infrastructure-based development, that systematic, long-term government investments in transportation, housing, education, and healthcare are necessary to ensure sustainable economic growth in emerging countries.

During Robert McNamara&#x27;s 13 years at the World Bank, he introduced key changes, most notably, shifting the Bank&#x27;s economic development policies toward targeted poverty reduction. Before his tenure at the World Bank, poverty did not receive substantial attention as part of international and national economic development; the focus of development had been on industrialization and infrastructure. Poverty also came to be redefined as a condition faced by people rather than countries. According to Martha Finnemore, the World Bank under McNamara&#x27;s tenure &quot;sold&quot; states poverty reduction &quot;through a mixture of persuasion and coercion.&quot;

==Economic development goals==
The development of a country has been associated with different concepts but generally encompasses economic growth through higher productivity, political systems that represent as accurately as possible the preferences of its citizens, The extension of rights to all social groups and the opportunities to get them and the proper functionality of institutions and organizations that can attend more technically and logistically complex tasks (i.e. raise taxes and deliver public services). These processes describe the State&#x27;s capabilities to manage its economy, polity, society and public administration. Generally, economic development policies attempt to solve issues in these topics.

With this in mind, economic development is typically associated with improvements in a variety of areas or indicators (such as literacy rates, life expectancy, and poverty rates), that may be causes of economic development rather than consequences of specific economic development programs. For example, health and education improvements have been closely related to economic growth, but the causality with economic development may not be obvious. In any case, it is important to not expect that particular economic development programs be able to fix many problems at once as that would be establishing unsurmountable goals for them that are highly unlikely they can achieved. Any development policy should set limited goals and a gradual approach to avoid falling victim to something Prittchet, Woolcock and Andrews call &#x27;premature load bearing&#x27;.

Many times the economic development goals of specific countries cannot be reached because they lack the State&#x27;s capabilities to do so. For example, if a nation has little capacity to carry out basic functions like security and policing or core service delivery it is unlikely that a program that wants to foster a free-trade zone (special economic zones) or distribute vaccinations to vulnerable populations can accomplish their goals. This has been something overlooked by multiple international organizations, aid programs and even participating governments who attempt to carry out &#x27;best practices&#x27; from other places in a carbon-copy manner with little success. This isomorphic mimicry –adopting organizational forms that have been successful elsewhere but that only hide institutional dysfunction without solving it on the home country –can contribute to getting countries stuck in &#x27;capability traps&#x27; where the country does not advance in its development goals. An example of this can be seen through some of the criticisms of foreign aid and its success rate at helping countries develop.

Beyond the incentive compatibility problems that can happen to foreign aid donations –that foreign aid granting countries continue to give it to countries with little results of economic growth but with corrupt leaders that are aligned with the granting countries&#x27; geopolitical interests and agenda –there are problems of fiscal fragility associated to receiving an important amount of government revenues through foreign aid. Governments that can raise a significant amount of revenue from this source are less accountable to their citizens (they are more autonomous) as they have less pressure to legitimately use those resources. Just as it has been documented for countries with an abundant supply of natural resources such as oil, countries whose government budget consists largely of foreign aid donations and not regular taxes are less likely to have incentives to develop effective public institutions. This in turn can undermine the country&#x27;s efforts to develop.

==Economic development policies==
In its broadest sense, policies of economic development encompass three major areas:
* Governments undertaking to meet broad economic objectives such as price stability, high employment, and sustainable growth. Such efforts include monetary and fiscal policies, regulation of financial institutions, trade, and tax policies.
* Programs that provide infrastructure and services such as highways, parks, affordable housing, crime prevention, and K–12 education.
* Job creation and retention through specific efforts in business finance, marketing, neighborhood development, workforce development, small business development, business retention and expansion, technology transfer, and real estate development. This third category is a primary focus of economic development professionals.

Contractionary monetary policy is a tool used by central banks to slow down a country&#x27;s economic growth. An example would be raising interest rates to decrease lending. In the United States, the use of contractionary monetary policy has increased women&#x27;s unemployment. Seguino and Heintz uses a panel dataset for each 50 states with unemployment, labor force participation by race, and annual labor market statistics. In addition, for contractionary monetary policy, they utilize the federal funds rate, the short-term interest rates charged to banks. Seguino and Heintz Seguino concludes that the impact of a one percentage point increase in the federal funds rate relative to white and black women&#x27;s unemployment is 0.015 and 0.043, respectively

One growing understanding in economic development is the promotion of regional clusters and a thriving metropolitan economy. In today&#x27;s global landscape, location is vitally important and becomes a key in competitive advantage.

International trade and exchange rates are key issues in economic development. Currencies are often either under-valued or over-valued, resulting in trade surpluses or deficits. Furthermore, the growth of globalization has linked economic development with trends on international trade and participation in global value chains (GVCs) and international financial markets. The last financial crisis had a huge effect on economies in developing countries. Economist Jayati Ghosh states that it is necessary to make financial markets in developing countries more resilient by providing a variety of financial institutions. This could also add to financial security for small-scale producers.

===Organization===
Economic development has evolved into a professional industry of highly specialized practitioners. The practitioners have two key roles: one is to provide leadership in policy-making, and the other is to administer policy, programs, and projects. Economic development practitioners generally work in public offices on the state, regional, or municipal level, or in public-private partnerships organizations that may be partially funded by local, regional, state, or federal tax money. These economic development organizations function as individual entities and in some cases as departments of local governments. Their role is to seek out new economic opportunities and retain their existing business wealth.

There are numerous other organizations whose primary function is not economic development that work in partnership with economic developers. They include the news media, foundations, utilities, schools, health care providers, faith-based organizations, and colleges, universities, and other education or research institutions.

==Development indicators and indices==
There are various types of macroeconomic and sociocultural indicators or &quot;metrics&quot; used by economists and geographers to assess the relative economic advancement of a given region or nation. The World Bank&#x27;s &quot;World Development Indicators&quot; are compiled annually from officially recognized international sources and include national, regional and global estimates.

===GDP per capita and real income===

GDP per capita is gross domestic product divided by mid-year population. GDP is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes and minus any subsidizes not included in the value of the products. It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources. Median income is related to real gross national income per capita and income distribution.

===Modern transportation===
European development economists have argued that the existence of modern transportation networks- such as high-speed rail infrastructure constitutes a significant indicator of a country&#x27;s economic advancement: this perspective is illustrated notably through the Basic Rail Transportation Infrastructure Index (known as BRTI Index) and related models such as the (Modified) Rail Transportation Infrastructure Index (RTI).

=== Introduction of The GDI and GEM ===
In an effort to create an indicator that would help measure gender equality, the United Nations has created two measures: the Gender-Related Development Index (GDI) and the Gender Empowerment Measure (GEM). These indicators were first introduced in the 1995 UNDP Human Development Report.

=== Other factors ===
Other factors include the inflation rate, investment level and national debt, birth and death rates, life expectancy, morbidity, education levels (measured through literacy and numeracy rates), housing, social services like hospitals, health facilities, clean and safe drinking water, schools (measured by the distance learners must travel to reach them), ability to use hard infrastructure (railways, roads, ports, airports, harbours, etc.), and telecommunications and other soft infrastructure like the Internet.

=== Gender Empowerment Measure ===

The Gender Empowerment Measure (GEM) focuses on aggregating various indicators that focus on capturing the economic, political, and professional gains made by women. The GEM is composed of just three variables: income earning power, share in professional and managerial jobs, and share of parliamentary seats.

==== Gender Development Index ====

The Gender Development Index (GDI) measures the gender gap in human development achievements. It takes the disparity between men and women into account through three variables, health, knowledge, and living standards.

<doc id="148135" wikidata="Q2061000" url="?curid=148135" title="Alaska Permanent Fund">
<text>The Alaska Permanent Fund (APF) is a constitutionally established permanent fund managed by a state-owned corporation, the Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation (APFC). It was established in Alaska in 1976 by Article 9, Section 15 of the Alaska State Constitution under Governor Jay Hammond and Attorney General Avrum Gross. From February 1976 until April 1980, the Department of Revenue Treasury Division managed the state&#x27;s Permanent Fund assets, until, in 1980, the Alaska State Legislature created the APFC.

As of 2019, the fund was worth approximately $64 billion that has been funded by oil and mining revenues and has paid out an average of approximately $1,600 annually per resident (adjusted to 2019 dollars). The main use for the fund&#x27;s revenue has been to pay out the Permanent Fund Dividend (PFD), which many authors portray as the only example of a basic income in practice.

==History==
Shortly after the oil from Alaska&#x27;s North Slope began flowing to market through the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, the Permanent Fund was created by an amendment to the Alaska Constitution. It was designed to be an investment where at least 25% of the oil money would be put into a dedicated fund for future generations, who would no longer have oil as a resource. This does not mean the fund is solely funded by oil revenue. The Fund includes neither property taxes on oil company property nor income tax from oil corporations, so the minimum 25% deposit is closer to 11% if those sources were also considered. The Alaska Permanent Fund sets aside a certain share of oil revenues to continue benefiting current and future generations of Alaskans. Multiple citizens also believed that the legislature too quickly and too inefficiently spent the $900 million bonus the state got in 1969 after leasing out the oil fields. This belief spurred a desire to put some oil revenues out of direct political control.

The Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation manages the assets of both the Permanent Fund and other state investments, but spending Fund income is up to the Legislature. The corporation is to manage for maximum prudent return, and not—as some Alaskans at first wanted—as a development bank for in-state projects. The Fund grew from an initial investment of $734,000 in 1977 to approximately $53.7 billion as of July 9, 2015. Some growth was due to good management, some to inflationary re-investment, and some via legislative decisions to deposit extra income during boom years. Each year, the fund&#x27;s realized earnings are split between inflation-proofing, operating expenses, and the annual Permanent Fund Dividend.

The fund is a member of the International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds and has therefore signed up to the Santiago Principles on best practice in managing sovereign wealth funds. The Fund&#x27;s current chief investment officer is Marcus Frampton.

In July 2015, execute director Michael J. Burns died having led the corporation since 2004.

==Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation==
The Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation is a government instrumentality of the State of Alaska created to manage and invest the assets of the Alaska Permanent Fund and other funds designated by law.

===Board of trustees===
The Board of Trustees are governor-appointed
* Jason Brune, chair, appointed in 2022 by Gov. Dunleavy
*Adam Crum, Vice-chair, appointed 2022 by Gov. Dunleavy
* Ryan Anderson, appointed 2023 by Gov. Dunleavy
* Craig Richards, appointed 2021 by Gov. Dunleavy
* Ethan Schutt, appointed 2020 by Gov. Dunleavy
* John Binkley, appointed 2025 by Gov Dunleavy

== Permanent Fund Dividend ==
The Permanent Fund Dividend (PFD) is a dividend paid to Alaska residents that have lived within the state for a full calendar year (January 1 – December 31), and intend to remain an Alaska resident indefinitely. This means if residency is taken on January 2, the &quot;calendar year&quot; would not start until next January 1.

However, an individual is not eligible for a PFD for a dividend year if:
:(1) the individual was absent from Alaska for more than 180 days, unless it was on an allowable absence;
:(2) during the qualifying year, the individual was sentenced as a result of conviction in this state of a felony;
:(3) during all or part of the qualifying year, the individual was incarcerated as a result of the conviction in this state of a
::(A) felony; or
::(B) misdemeanor if the individual has been convicted of
:::(i) a prior felony as defined in AS 11.81.900; or
:::(ii) two or more prior misdemeanors as defined in AS 11.81.900

The amount of each payment is based upon a five-year average of the Permanent Fund&#x27;s performance and varies widely depending on the stock market and many other factors. The PFD is calculated by the following steps:

# Add fund statutory net income from the current plus the previous four fiscal years.
# Multiply by 21%
# Divide by 2
# Subtract prior year obligations, expenses and PFD program operations
# Divide by the number of eligible applicants

The lowest individual dividend payout was $331.29 in 1984 and the highest was $3,284 in 2022. In 2008, Governor Sarah Palin signed Senate Bill 4002 that used revenues generated from the state&#x27;s natural resources and provided a one-time special payment of $1,200 to every Alaskan eligible for the PFD.

Although the principal or corpus of the fund is constitutionally protected, income earned by the fund, like nearly all state income, is constitutionally defined as general fund money.

The first dividend plan would have paid Alaskans $50 for each year of residency up to 20 years, but the U.S. Supreme Court in disapproved the $50 per year formula as an invidious distinction burdening interstate travel. As a result, each qualified resident now receives the same annual amount, regardless of age or years of residency.

Payments from the fund are subject to federal income tax. Alaska has no state income tax, but part-year residents who leave the state may be taxed on them by their new state of residence.

The PFD is a Basic Income in the form of a resource dividend. Some researchers argue, &quot;It has helped Alaska attain the highest economic equality of any state in the United States... And, seemingly unnoticed, it has provided unconditional cash assistance to needy Alaskans at a time when most states have scaled back aid and increased conditionality.&quot;

===Annual individual payout===
This is the fund&#x27;s history of annual individual payouts, in USD.

== Constitutional Budget Reserve ==

The Constitutional Budget Reserve (CBR) is a companion fund to the Permanent Fund which was established in 1991 to ease problems from the variability of oil revenue, which vary depending upon the price of oil in the market. Deposits into the CBR consist of settlements of back taxes and other revenues owed to the state. Draws from the CBR into the general fund require a 3/4 vote of each house of the legislature and must be repaid. To date, the general fund has amassed a debt of approximately $4 billion to the CBR to maintain a stable level of public spending.

The size of the debt owed to the CBR has raised doubts over repayment. The CBR is based on the assumption that the general fund deficit will remain constant over time (allowing paybacks to balance draws). Believing this to be mistaken, critics allege the state uses resources from the CBR to avoid reducing the budget, acknowledging debt, or increasing taxes. According to them, falling oil revenues and growing spending requirements will leave paybacks consistently lower than draws, causing the CBR to fail.

Former state senator Dave Donley (R-Anchorage) recognized that the high vote requirement to spend CBR money (¾ of each house) had a perverse and unintended consequence. The high vote requirement was meant to ensure that draws from the CBR would be rare, but in fact such draws are common. Donley explained that the high vote requirement really empowers the minority party (in the 2000–2007 era, the Democratic Party), who can then get what they want in a Christmas tree bill (presents for everyone, both majority and minority) in exchange for their votes (which minority votes would not be needed with the usual 51% voting rule). Donley thus explains why both parties can and do use the higher voting rule requirement to more frequently spend from the CBR.

== Issues with the Permanent Fund ==

===Dividends and spending===

While the Permanent Fund generally generated large surpluses even after payment of the Dividend [PFD], the state general fund operated at a substantial deficit. However, the consolidated account of both General and Permanent Funds usually shows a surplus. The Funds&#x27; ultimate uses were never clearly spelled out at its inception, leaving no current consensus over what role Fund earning should play in the current and expected state budget shortfalls. However, some people argue that the original intent was to fund state government after the temporary oil riches ceased, while others note that the Fund&#x27;s intent changed from its 1976 origin when in 1982 the Dividend program began. Public opinion strongly favors the Dividend program. Indeed, in 1999, with oil prices going as low as $9 per barrel and Alaska&#x27;s oil consultant Daniel Yergin forecasting low prices &quot;for the foreseeable future&quot;, the State put an advisory vote before Alaskans, asking if government could spend &quot;some&quot; part of Permanent Fund earning for government purposes. Gov. Knowles, Lt. Gov. Ulmer, and many other elected officials urged a &quot;yes&quot; vote. Campaign spending greatly favored the &quot;yes&quot; side. Despite this, the public voted &quot;no&quot; by nearly 84%. (Oil prices rose dramatically, starting about two weeks after Yergin&#x27;s prediction, to above $60 per barrel, though the quantity produced continues to fall.) Perceived support of the dividend program is so universally strong that it ensures the dividend&#x27;s continuity and the protection of the Fund&#x27;s principal, since any measure characterized as negatively impacting dividend payouts represents a loss to the entire populace. That is, legislators willing to appropriate the Fund&#x27;s annual earnings are constrained by the high political costs of any measures leading to a decrease in the public&#x27;s dividend.

===Percent of Market Value (POMV) proposal===

In 2000, the APFC Board of Trustees proposed changing the Permanent Fund&#x27;s management system to a Percent of Market Value (PoMV) approach which would require an amendment to the state constitution. The PoMV proposal would limit withdrawals to five percent of the fund&#x27;s value each year, to be spent at the discretion of the Legislature. Currently the Legislature has authority to appropriate all of the fund&#x27;s realized earnings. Tentative, unapproved proposals indicate that half of this five percent withdrawal would go to the dividend and half to government spending—but POMV died in the Legislature because most there saw POMV as unambiguously tied to such politically unpopular spending proposals. Most Alaskans (84% in 1999) disapprove of allowing the government to tamper with the fund, especially if that means government might spend Fund income.

Again in 2015–2017, a POMV approach was considered. The market price for North Slope oil fell from an average $107.57 per barrel in FY2014 to $50.05 per barrel in FY2017. This price shift caused an 80 percent decline in state revenue and resulted in a multibillion-dollar budget gap. Both bodies of the legislature have passed a bill that provides for an annual draw of 5.25% of the average balance of the Permanent Fund (average of the first 5 of the last six years). Since the formula is based on an average, rather than a single year, the effective draw is only about 4.2%—enough to preserve the real value of the fund considering that the fund has returned close to 9% annually. The legislature carefully vetted this percentage over the course of two sessions and has come to a consensus. This draw is projected to produce $2.7 billion in FY2019 and grow with the balance of the Permanent Fund. The major point of disagreement, however, is the size of the dividend: The House of Representatives version of the bill uses 5.25% draw for government (33% for Dividends and 67% for government services) and an additional 0.25% draw for Permanent Fund inflation proofing. This produces $2.7 billion ($1.8 billion for government use, net of a $900.9 million dividend—about $1,250.00 per Alaskan—growing with the value of the fund). The Senate version of the bill uses the same 5.25% draw as the House, but directs only 25% of the draw to dividends. This produces the same $2.7 billion but government services receive $2.0 billion while the dividend receives just under $700 million—about $1,000.00 per person—growing with the value of the fund.

Oil revenues are forecast (by the state Department of Revenue) to remain stagnant through FY2027, and traditional budget reserves may be empty by FY2019 but with a Permanent Fund value in excess of $60.0 billion, the budget gap can be reduced significantly. Since this POMV proposal does not close the gap entirely, members of the legislature are considering a tax bill as well.

== Impact ==
A 2018 paper found that the Alaska Permanent Fund &quot;dividend had no effect on employment, and increased part-time work by 1.8 percentage points (17 percent)... our results suggest that a universal and permanent cash transfer does not significantly decrease aggregate employment.&quot;

A 2019 study found &quot;a 14% increase in substance-abuse incidents the day after the [Alaska Permanent Fund] payment and a 10% increase over the following four weeks. This is partially offset by a 8% decrease in property crime, with no changes in violent crimes. On an annual basis, however, changes in criminal activity from the payment are small. Estimated costs comprise a very small portion of the total payment, suggesting that crime-related concerns of a universal cash transfer program may be unwarranted.&quot;

A 2024 paper in &quot;Poverty &amp; Public Policy&quot; found that the Alaska Permanent Fund &quot;reduced the number of Alaskans with incomes below the US poverty threshold by 20%–40%&quot; and &quot;reduced poverty rates of rural Indigenous Alaskans from 28% to less than 22%&quot;.

<doc id="148155" wikidata="Q1503615" url="?curid=148155" title="Stephen Kovacevich">
<text>Stephen Kovacevich (born October 17, 1940) is an American classical pianist and conductor. He is particularly celebrated for his recordings of works by Beethoven, Bartók, and Schubert, and is known for technical skill, clarity of playing, and an intelligent approach to interpretation.

==Biography==
Stephen Kovacevich was born in San Pedro, Los Angeles, California, to a Croatian father and an American mother. When his mother remarried, his name was changed to Stephen Bishop, the name under which he performed in his early career. He later discovered that he was often being confused with the singer and guitarist Stephen Bishop. To avoid the confusion, he began performing as Stephen Bishop-Kovacevich and later simply as Stephen Kovacevich.

He made his concert debut as a pianist at the age of 11; then, at the age of 18 he moved to London to study under Dame Myra Hess on a scholarship and has been a London resident ever since, currently living in Hampstead. In 1961 he made a sensational European debut at the Wigmore Hall, playing the Sonata by Alban Berg, three Bach Preludes and Fugues and Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Diabelli Variations&quot;. He also toured Britain with Jacqueline du Pré. In 1967, he made his New York debut and since then he has toured Europe, the United States, the Far East, Australia, New Zealand and South America. As a soloist and conductor, he has frequently performed and recorded works by, amongst others, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Brahms and Bartók. In more recent years, he has performed works by Rachmaninoff.

Kovacevich often performs chamber works; his chamber music partners have included Jacqueline du Pré, Martha Argerich, Steven Isserlis, Nigel Kennedy, Lynn Harrell, Sarah Chang, Gautier Capuçon, Renaud Capuçon and Emmanuel Pahud.

Aside from his performing career, Kovacevich has given master classes and recitals at Dartington International Summer School for many years.

== Personal life ==

From 1961 to 1967 Kovacevich was married to novelist and psychotherapist Bernardine Bishop née Wall, who died in 2013. They had two sons, Matt Bishop and Foff (Francis) Bishop.

Kovacevich had a relationship with pianist Martha Argerich, with whom he still performs. They have one daughter, Stéphanie.

<doc id="148164" wikidata="Q429777" url="?curid=148164" title="Melissa Joan Hart">
<text>Melissa Joan Hart (born April 18, 1976) is an American actress. She had starring roles as the title characters in the sitcoms &quot;Clarissa Explains It All&quot; (1991–1994), &quot;Sabrina the Teenage Witch&quot; (1996–2003), and &quot;Melissa &amp; Joey&quot; (2010–2015). She appeared as Liz in &quot;No Good Nick&quot; (2019). She has also appeared in the films &quot;Drive Me Crazy&quot; (1999), &quot;Nine Dead&quot; (2009), and &quot;God&#x27;s Not Dead 2&quot; (2016). On October 17, 2021, she became the first celebrity to win the $1 million top prize for her charity, Youth Villages, on &quot;Celebrity Wheel of Fortune&quot; and the fourth overall million-dollar winner on &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;.

== Early life ==
Hart was born in Smithtown, New York, the first child of Paula Hart (née Voje), a producer and talent manager, and William Hart, a carpenter, shellfish purveyor, oyster hatchery worker, and entrepreneur. Her maternal grandfather, Stanley John Voje, was a Navy veteran and Catholic. Hart grew up in Sayville, New York.

Hart&#x27;s parents had four other children after Melissa: Trisha, Elizabeth, Brian, and Emily, who are all in acting. Her parents divorced in the early 1990s, and she moved with her mother and siblings to New York City. In 1994, her mother married television executive Leslie Gilliams, who is best known for his appearance on Season 5 of &quot;MasterChef&quot; in 2014, when he finished in 3rd place. Hart has three half-sisters: Alexandra, Samantha, and Mackenzie.

Hart was named after the Allman Brothers song &quot;Melissa&quot;, while her middle name, Joan, came from her maternal grandmother.

== Career ==
=== Early career ===
Hart&#x27;s career began at age four when she made a television commercial for a bathtub doll called Splashy. From then on, she appeared regularly in commercials, making 25 of them before the age of five. Other early television work included a small role in the miniseries &quot;Kane &amp; Abel&quot; in 1985, a guest-starring role in an episode of &quot;The Equalizer&quot; in 1986, and a starring role alongside Katherine Helmond in the Emmy Award-winning TV film &quot;Christmas Snow&quot;, also in 1986. She appeared on the April 22, 1986, episode of the NBC daytime soap opera &quot;Another World&quot;. She also auditioned for the lead role Jamie Lloyd in &quot;Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers&quot;, losing the role to Danielle Harris.

In 1989, she became an understudy in a Broadway production of &quot;The Crucible&quot; starring Martin Sheen. That same year, she appeared in an off-Broadway production of &quot;Beside Herself&quot; with William Hurt and Calista Flockhart.

=== 1991–1994: &quot;Clarissa Explains It All&quot; ===

In 1991, Hart landed the starring role on the Nickelodeon series &quot;Clarissa Explains It All&quot;, a comedy about a teenaged girl in everyday situations, which was successful during its four-year run. The show brought her four consecutive Young Artist Award nominations, winning three. Her role in the series also led to her starring in the FMV video game Nickelodeon&#x27;s Director&#x27;s Lab as a tour guide who takes the player around a film studio.

Initially, after first being recognized in public, Hart felt embarrassed to be acting in a children&#x27;s show while being a teenager. Nevertheless, she was enthusiastic about the role, and &quot;all [she] hoped for that [she] would get to do it for a while.&quot;

Hart also recorded two albums as Clarissa: &quot;This Is What &#x27;Na Na&#x27; Means&quot; and a recording of &quot;Peter and the Wolf&quot;.

In 1995, a year after the end of &quot;Clarissa Explains It All&quot;, Hart filmed a pilot episode for a spin-off show featuring a college-aged Clarissa explaining it all about her foray into the professional world as an intern at a newspaper. As its musical theme, the show featured a slow, jazz version of its predecessor&#x27;s theme song, and also starred Robert Klein as her boss.

Hart appeared on Nickelodeon&#x27;s anthology show &quot;Are You Afraid of the Dark?&quot;, in the Season 2 episode &quot;The Tale of the Frozen Ghost&quot; (1993).

=== 1996–2003: &quot;Sabrina the Teenage Witch&quot; ===
After the television series ended, Hart attended New York University. However, she dropped out after she earned the title role for the 1996 television film &quot;Sabrina the Teenage Witch&quot;, which was followed by the television series of the same name, which lasted seven seasons on ABC (four seasons) and The WB (three seasons). She later collaborated on an that featured Hart voicing the two aunts Hilda and Zelda with Hart&#x27;s younger sister Emily starring in the title role. She also guest-starred on the series &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot; and starred in several television films. She guest starred on the &quot;Boy Meets World&quot; episode &quot;Witches of Pennbrook&quot; as her character Sabrina Spellman; the episode also guest starred Hart&#x27;s closest friend Candace Cameron Bure as a witch named Millie.
In 1998, Hart had a small role in the film &quot;Can&#x27;t Hardly Wait&quot;; shortly afterwards Hart began working on a theatrical film project titled &quot;Next to You&quot;, in which she acted alongside Adrian Grenier. Britney Spears released a remix of her song &quot;(You Drive Me) Crazy&quot; to promote the film&#x27;s soundtrack. To capitalize on the song&#x27;s success as a top-ten hit, the name of the film was changed to &quot;Drive Me Crazy&quot;. To promote the film, both Hart and Grenier appeared in the song&#x27;s music video. Around the same time, Spears made a guest appearance as herself on &quot;Sabrina&quot;, in the season four episode &quot;No Place Like Home&quot;.

Coinciding with the release of &quot;Drive Me Crazy&quot;, Hart appeared wearing lingerie on the cover of &quot;Maxim&quot; magazine&#x27;s October 1999 issue, as well as in a photo shoot and an accompanying article, which resulted in an attempt by the publisher of the &quot;Sabrina&quot; comic book series to sue her for breach of contract. Hart continued her acting career, starring in the film &quot;Rent Control&quot;, which aired in 2005 on the ABC Family cable network. Hart also continued to star on &quot;Sabrina, the Teenage Witch&quot; until 2003. Hart was also a primary voice-actress on &quot;Sabrina: The Animated Series&quot;, which ran for 65 episodes in 1999 on ABC and UPN.

In 1999, Hart made her directorial debut in an episode of Disney Channel&#x27;s &quot;So Weird&quot; called &quot;Snapshot&quot; which guest-starred her sister Emily. Hart directed an episode of Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;Taina&quot; in 2001. In 2001 and 2002, she directed six episodes of &quot;Sabrina&quot;.

=== 2004–2010: Post-&quot;Sabrina&quot; ===
After &quot;Sabrina&quot; ended in 2003 after seven seasons, Hart directed her first film, a 15-minute live-action short film called &quot;Mute&quot; (2005), starring her sister Emily. In 2007, Hart guest-starred on an episode of &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; titled &quot;Impulsive&quot; as a teacher accused of statutory rape. In late 2007, she directed the &quot;Anger Cage&quot; video for her husband Mark Wilkerson&#x27;s band Course of Nature. She also starred in the ABC Family film &quot;Holiday in Handcuffs&quot;, opposite Mario Lopez. The film premiered on December 9, 2007, and was the highest rated program in the history of the network, with 6.7 million viewers. Hart followed this with another ABC Family film with a similar premise, &quot;My Fake Fiancé&quot;, in 2009.

It was announced on August 17, 2009, that she would compete in season nine of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. Hart was paired up with two-time reigning champion, Mark Ballas. She was eliminated from the competition in week six out of a possible ten. In 2010, Hart starred as Kelley in the horror thriller film &quot;Nine Dead&quot;.

=== 2010–2015: &quot;Melissa &amp; Joey&quot; ===
In 2010, Hart returned to a new weekly television series, starring with Joey Lawrence in the ABC Family sitcom &quot;Melissa &amp; Joey&quot;. In the series Hart plays a woman who hires Lawrence as a nanny to help care for her incarcerated sister&#x27;s children. In the second season, she occupied the director&#x27;s chair for an episode, for the first time since &quot;Sabrina&quot;.
Hart joined the cast of an off-Broadway production of &quot;Love, Loss, and What I Wore&quot; for a four-week run that started in March 2010 and ended April 25, 2010.

In March 2010, Hart took part in an ad campaign for Gain detergent with &quot;Sabrina, the Teenage Witch&quot; co-star and friend Soleil Moon Frye.

On November 22, 2010, Hart participated as a presenter in the International Emmy Awards.

In June 2012, St. Martin&#x27;s Press announced that it had made a deal with Hart to publish her memoir &quot;Melissa Explains It All: Tales from My Abnormally Normal Life&quot; in the fall of 2013. In the memoir, Hart wrote about growing up, being a child actor and her rise to fame, her rebellious teen years, and her efforts to balance a career as an adult with motherhood and family life.

In 2013, Hart attempted to use crowdfunding (via Kickstarter) to fund a romantic comedy film to be titled &quot;Darci&#x27;s Walk of Shame&quot;, but was only able to garner $51,605, or just 2.6% of the expected $2 million goal. Ultimately, the idea was scrapped.

&quot;Melissa &amp; Joey&quot; concluded in August 2015 after 4 seasons and 104 episodes.

===2016–present: Recent work===
In 2016, Hart starred as the lead, Grace Wesley, in the film &quot;God&#x27;s Not Dead 2&quot;.

In 2018, Hart was cast as Liz in the Netflix comedy series &quot;No Good Nick&quot;. The series premiered on April 15, 2019. She directed one episode from &quot;The Goldbergs&quot;, &quot;Hail Barry&quot; and the &quot;Young Sheldon&quot; episode &quot;Cowboy Aerobics and 473 Grease-Free Bolts&quot;. Hart also made her return to Nickelodeon 25 years after the end of &quot;Clarissa Explains It All&quot; when she joined the voice cast of &quot;The Casagrandes&quot;, a spinoff of &quot;The Loud House&quot;, portraying Becca Chang opposite of Ken Jeong as Stanley Chang.

In 2022, Hart starred in the Lifetime film &quot;Dirty Little Secret&quot; as part of its &quot;Ripped from the Headlines&quot; feature film where it was inspired by true events and the book &quot;Dirty Little Secrets&quot; by C.J. Omolulu.

In January 2022, Hart began hosting a podcast titled &quot;What Women Binge&quot; starring her and her friend Amanda Lee.

In 2023, Hart competed in season nine of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Lamp&quot;. She was eliminated in &quot;Masked Singer in Space&quot; alongside Alicia Witt as &quot;Dandelion&quot;. Also in 2023, Hart starred in the Lifetime movie &quot;Would You Kill for Me? The Mary Bailey Story&quot; where she portrayed Mary Bailey&#x27;s grandmother Ella.

In 2024, Hart starred in the Lifetime film &quot;The Bad Guardian&quot; which was based on different accounts of elder abuse.

== Business ventures ==

In May 2009, Hart opened a candy shop called SweetHarts in Sherman Oaks, California. Hart commented that it had been her &quot;childhood dream&quot; to own a candy shop. SweetHarts closed in December 2011 due to a lawsuit by a former employee alleging wrongful termination and racial discrimination, as well as other issues. Hart denied all of the employee&#x27;s claims, and the case was dismissed in 2012. SweetHarts later reopened with new owners before closing permanently in 2015.

In 2015, Hart and her husband started their own fashion line called King of Harts.

==Personal life==
On July 19, 2003, Hart married musician Mark Wilkerson, having met at the Kentucky Derby in May 2002. The preparations for the ceremony, which took place in Florence, Italy, were documented in a television miniseries titled &quot;Tying the Knot&quot;, produced by Hart&#x27;s production company Hartbreak Films and aired on ABC Family. Hart and Wilkerson have three sons, Mason (born January 2006), Braydon (born March 2008), and Tucker (born September 2012). They lived in Westport, Connecticut, until 2019, when they moved to Lake Tahoe and then in 2020, they moved to Nashville.

Hart and Wilkerson were featured in &quot;People&quot; magazine&#x27;s April 7, 2008 issue, introducing their second child Braydon. Hart wrote a diary, including video entries, to document potty training her son, Mason, for Huggies Pull-Ups brand diapers.

Hart and her family are Presbyterians. In an interview, she stated that they attend church every Sunday and pray every night and before every meal.

Hart was near The Covenant School in Nashville when a mass shooting occurred there in March 2023 and helped escort some of the fleeing children to safety. She later recounted the experience on NewsNation and her social media accounts, while noting that she and her children were also in proximity to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012.

Hart has expressed her support for some Republican candidates, such as voting for Bob Dole during the 1996 election. On November 5, 2012, the day before that year&#x27;s Election Day, she tweeted that she was endorsing Mitt Romney for president. Hart has expressed support for increased gun control, marching in a Moms Demand Action demonstration in Brooklyn in May 2016. On August 16, 2016, in the run-up to that year&#x27;s presidential election, she donated to Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson&#x27;s campaign. On August 28, 2016, she joined Johnson&#x27;s campaign as its Connecticut chairperson. On August 21, 2023, she marched with Moms Demand Action in Nashville.

<text>John Balguy (12 August 1686 – 21 September 1748) was an English divine and philosopher.

==Early years==
He was born at Sheffield and educated at the Sheffield Grammar School (where his father Thomas Balguy was headmaster until his death in 1696) and at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, graduated BA in 1706, was ordained in 1710, and in 1711 obtained the small living of Lamesley and Tanfield in Durham. He married in 1715. It was the year in which Bishop Hoadley preached the famous sermon on &#x27;The Kingdom of Christ&#x27;, which gave rise to the Bangorian controversy; and Balguy, under the nom de plume of Silvius, began his career of authorship by taking the side of Hoadley in this controversy against some of his High Church opponents.

==Life in the Church==
In 1726 he published &quot;A letter to a Deist concerning the Beauty and Excellency of Moral Virtue, and the Support and Improvement which it receives from the Christian Religion&quot;, chiefly designed to show that, while a love of virtue for its own sake is the highest principle of morality, religious rewards and punishments are most valuable, and in some cases absolutely indispensable, as sanctions of conduct. In 1727 he was made a prebendary of Salisbury by his friend Hoadley. In the same year he published the first part of a tractate entitled The Foundation of Moral Goodness, and in the following year a second part, Illustrating and enforcing the Principles contained in the former. The aim of the work is twofold — to refute the theory of Hutcheson regarding the basis of rectitude and to establish the theory of Cudworth and Clarke that virtue is conformity to reason — the acting according to fitnesses which arise out of the eternal and immutable relations of agents to objects.

In 1729 he became vicar of Northallerton, in the county of York. His next work was an essay on Divine Rectitude: or, a Brief Inquiry concerning the Moral Perfections of the Deity, particularly in respect of Creation and Providence. It is an attempt to show that the same moral principle that ought to direct human life may be perceived to underlie the works and ways of God: goodness in the Deity not being a mere disposition to benevolence but a regard to an order, beauty and harmony, which are not merely relative to our faculties and capacities but real and absolute; claiming for their own sakes the reverence of all intelligent beings and alone answering to the perfection of the divine ideas. Balguy wrote several other terse and readable tracts of the same nature, which he collected and published in a single volume in 1734.

==Later life==
In 1741 he published an Essay on Redemption, containing somewhat advanced views. Redemption as taught in Scripture means, according to him, &quot;the deliverance or release of mankind from the power and punishment of sin, by the meritorious sufferings of Jesus Christ,&quot; but involves no translation of guilt, substitution of persons or vicarious punishment. Freed from these ideas, which have arisen from interpreting literally expressions which are properly figurative, the doctrine, he argues, satisfies deep and urgent human wants, and is in perfect consistence and agreement with reason and rectitude. His last publication was a volume of sermons, pervaded by good sense and good feeling, and clear, natural and direct in style. He died at Harrogate. A second volume of sermons appeared in 1750 (3rd ed. in 2 vols., 1760).

Thomas Balguy (1716–1785), who became archdeacon of Winchester, was his son.

<text>IBM PC DOS (an acronym for IBM Personal Computer Disk Operating System), also known as PC DOS or IBM DOS, is a discontinued disk operating system for the IBM Personal Computer, its successors, and IBM PC compatibles. It was sold by IBM from the early 1980s into the 2000s. Developed by Microsoft, it was also sold by that company to the open market as MS-DOS. Both operating systems were identical or almost identical until 1993, when IBM began selling PC DOS 6.1 with its own new features. The collective shorthand for PC DOS and MS-DOS was DOS, which is also the generic term for disk operating system, and is shared with dozens of disk operating systems called DOS.

==History==
The IBM task force assembled to develop the IBM PC decided that critical components of the machine, including the operating system, would come from outside vendors. This radical break from company tradition of in-house development was one of the key decisions that made the IBM PC an industry standard. Microsoft, founded five years earlier by Bill Gates, was eventually selected for the operating system.

IBM wanted Microsoft to retain ownership of whatever software it developed, and wanted nothing to do with helping Microsoft, other than making suggestions from afar. According to task force member Jack Sams: 
The reasons were internal. We had a terrible problem being sued by people claiming we had stolen their stuff. It could be horribly expensive for us to have our programmers look at code that belonged to someone else because they would then come back and say we stole it and made all this money. We had lost a series of suits on this, and so we didn&#x27;t want to have a product which was clearly someone else&#x27;s product worked on by IBM people. We went to Microsoft on the proposition that we wanted this to be their product.

IBM first contacted Microsoft to look the company over in July 1980. Negotiations continued over the months that followed, and the paperwork was officially signed in early November.

Although IBM expected that most customers would use PC DOS, the IBM PC also supported CP/M-86, which became available six months after PC DOS, and UCSD p-System operating systems. IBM&#x27;s expectation proved correct: one survey found that 96.3% of PCs were ordered with the $40 PC DOS compared to 3.4% with the $240 CP/M-86.

Over the history of IBM PC DOS, various versions were developed by IBM and Microsoft. By the time PC DOS 3.0 was completed, IBM had a team of developers covering the full OS. At that point in time, either IBM or Microsoft completely developed versions of IBM PC DOS going forward. By 1985, the joint development agreement (JDA) between IBM and Microsoft for the development of PC DOS had each company giving the other company a completely developed version. Most of the time branded versions were identical, but there were some cases in which each of the companies made minor modifications to their version of DOS. In the fall of 1984, IBM gave all the source code and documentation of the internally developed IBM TopView for DOS to Microsoft so that Microsoft could more fully understand how to develop an object-oriented operating environment, overlapping windows (for its development of Windows 2.0) and multitasking.

===Version history===
== Versions ==

=== PC DOS 1.x ===
Microsoft first licensed, then purchased 86-DOS from Seattle Computer Products (SCP), which was modified for the IBM PC by Microsoft employee Bob O&#x27;Rear with assistance from SCP (later Microsoft) employee Tim Paterson. O&#x27;Rear got 86-DOS to run on the prototype PC in February 1981. 86-DOS had to be converted from 8-inch to 5.25-inch floppy disks and integrated with the BIOS, which Microsoft was helping IBM to write. IBM had more people writing requirements for the computer than Microsoft had writing code. O&#x27;Rear often felt overwhelmed by the number of people he had to deal with at the ESD (Entry Systems Division) facility in Boca Raton, Florida.

Perhaps the first public mention of the operating system was in July 1981, when &quot;Byte&quot; discussed rumors of a forthcoming personal computer with &quot;a CP/M-like DOS ... to be called, simply, &#x27;IBM Personal Computer DOS. 86-DOS was rebranded IBM PC DOS 1.0 for its August 1981 release with the IBM PC. The initial version of DOS was largely based on CP/M-80 1.x and most of its architecture, function calls and file-naming conventions were copied directly from the older OS. The most significant difference was the fact that it introduced a different file system, FAT12. Unlike all later DOS versions, the and commands were separate executables rather than part of . Single-sided 160 kilobyte (KB) 5.25-inch floppies were the only disk format supported.

In late 1981, Paterson, now at Microsoft, began writing PC DOS 1.10. It debuted in May 1982 along with the Revision B IBM PC. Support for the new double-sided drives was added, allowing 320 KB per disk. A number of bugs were fixed, and error messages and prompts were made less cryptic. The was now able to load files greater than 64 KB in size.

=== PC DOS 2.x ===

Later, a group of Microsoft programmers (primarily Paul Allen, Mark Zbikowski and Aaron Reynolds) began work on PC DOS 2.0. Completely rewritten, DOS 2.0 added subdirectories and hard disk support for the new IBM XT, which debuted in March 1983. A new 9-sector format bumped the capacity of floppy disks to 360 KB. The Unix-inspired kernel featured file handles in place of the CP/M-derivative file control blocks and loadable device drivers could now be used for adding hardware beyond that which the IBM PC BIOS supported. BASIC and most of the utilities provided with DOS were substantially upgraded as well. A major undertaking that took almost 10 months of work, DOS 2.0 was more than twice as big as DOS 1.x, occupying around 28 KB of RAM compared to the 12 KB of its predecessor. It would form the basis for all Microsoft consumer-oriented OSes until 2001, when Windows XP (based on Windows NT) was released.

In October 1983 (officially 1 November 1983) DOS 2.1 debuted. It fixed some bugs and added support for half-height floppy drives and the new IBM PCjr.

In 1983, Compaq released the Compaq Portable, the first 100% IBM PC compatible and licensed their own OEM version of DOS 1.10 (quickly replaced by DOS 2.00) from Microsoft. Other PC compatibles followed suit, most of which included hardware-specific DOS features, although some were generic.

=== PC DOS 3.x ===

In August 1984, IBM introduced the Intel 80286-derived IBM PC/AT, its next-generation machine. Along with this was DOS 3.00. Despite jumping a whole version number, it again proved little more than an incremental upgrade, adding nothing more substantial than support for the AT&#x27;s new 1.2 megabyte (MB) floppy disks. Planned networking capabilities in DOS 3.00 were judged too buggy to be usable and Microsoft disabled them prior to the OS&#x27;s release. In any case, IBM&#x27;s original plans for the AT had been to equip it with a proper next-generation OS that would use its extended features, but this never materialized. PC DOS 3.1 (released March 1985) fixed the bugs in DOS 3.00 and supported IBM&#x27;s Network Adapter card on the IBM PC Network. PC DOS 3.2 added support for -inch double-density 720 KB floppy disk drives, supporting the IBM PC Convertible, IBM&#x27;s first computer to use -inch floppy disks, released April 1986, and later the IBM Personal System/2 in 1987.

In June 1985, IBM and Microsoft signed a long-term Joint Development Agreement to share specified DOS code and create a new operating system from scratch, known at the time as Advanced DOS. On 2 April 1987 OS/2 was announced as the first product produced under the agreement. At the same time, IBM released its next generation of personal computers, the IBM Personal System/2 (PS/2). PC DOS 3.3, released with the PS/2 line, added support for high density -inch 1.44 MB floppy disk drives, which IBM introduced in its 80286-based and higher PS/2 models. The upgrade from DOS 3.2 to 3.3 was completely written by IBM, with no development effort on the part of Microsoft, who were working on &quot;Advanced DOS 1.0&quot;. DOS 3.30 was the last version designed with the IBM XT and floppy-only systems in mind; it became one of the most popular versions and many users preferred it to its buggy successor.

=== PC DOS 4.x ===

PC DOS 4.0 (internally known as DOS 3.4 originally) shipped July 1988. DOS 4.0 had some compatibility issues with low-level disk utilities due to some internal data structure changes. DOS 4.0 used more memory than DOS 3.30 and it also had a few glitches. Newly added EMS drivers were only compatible with IBM&#x27;s EMS boards and not the more common Intel and AST ones. DOS 4.0 is also notable for including the first version of the DOS Shell, a full-screen utility designed to make the command-line OS more user-friendly. Microsoft took back control of development and released a bug-fixed DOS 4.01.

=== PC DOS 5 ===

DOS 5 debuted in June 1991. DOS 5 supported the use of the High Memory Area (HMA) and Upper Memory Blocks (UMBs) on 80286 and later systems to reduce its conventional memory usage. Also all DOS commands now supported the option to display command syntax. Aside from IBM&#x27;s PC DOS, MS-DOS was the only other version available as OEM editions vanished since by this time PCs were 100% compatible so customizations for hardware differences were no longer necessary.

The POWER.EXE was introduced that has the APM standard in version 5.02.

This was the last version of DOS that IBM and Microsoft shared the full code for, and the DOS that was integrated into OS/2 2.0&#x27;s, and later Windows NT&#x27;s, virtual DOS machine.

=== PC DOS 6.1 ===

PC DOS remained a rebranded version of MS-DOS until 1993. IBM and Microsoft parted ways—MS-DOS 6 was released in March, and PC DOS 6.1 (separately developed) followed in June. Most of the new features from MS-DOS 6.0 appeared in PC DOS 6.1 including the new boot menu support and the new commands , , and . QBasic was dropped and the MS-DOS Editor was replaced with the IBM E Editor. It also licensed components of Central Point&#x27;s PC Tools, such as Central Point Backup Utility (CPBACKUP). PC DOS 6.1 reports itself as DOS 6.00.

=== PC DOS 6.3 ===

PC DOS 6.3 followed in December. PC DOS 6.3 was also used in OS/2 for the PowerPC. PC DOS 6.3 also featured SuperStor disk compression technology from Addstor.

=== PC DOS 7 ===

PC DOS 7 was released in April 1995 and was the last release of DOS before IBM software development (other than the development IBM ViaVoice) moved to Austin. The REXX programming language was added, as well as support for a new floppy disk format, XDF, which extended a standard 1.44 MB floppy disk to 1.86 MB. SuperStor disk compression technology was replaced with Stac Electronics&#x27; STACKER. An algebraic command line calculator and a utility program to load device drivers from the command line were added. PC DOS 7 also included many optimizations to increase performance and reduce memory usage.

=== PC DOS 2000 ===

The most recent retail release was PC DOS 2000 – released from Austin in 1998 – which found its niche in the embedded software market and elsewhere. PC DOS 2000 is a slipstream of 7.0 with Y2K and other fixes applied. To applications, PC DOS 2000 reports itself as &quot;IBM PC DOS 7.00, revision 1&quot;, in contrast to the original PC DOS 7, which reported itself as &quot;IBM PC DOS 7.00, revision 0&quot;.

PC-DOS 2000 was the last version of IBM PC-DOS that was sold at retail. IBM advertised it as a Y2K compliant DOS. As it reports itself as &quot;IBM PC-DOS 7 Revision 1&quot;, it is often referred to as &quot;IBM PC-DOS7R1&quot; or just &quot;PC-DOS7R1&quot;.

Hitachi used PC DOS 2000 in their legacy &quot;Drive Fitness Test&quot; (4.15) and &quot;Hitachi Feature Tool&quot; (2.15) until 2009. ThinkPad products had a copy of the latest version of PC DOS in their Rescue and Recovery partition.

=== PC DOS 7.1 ===

PC DOS 7.1 added support for Logical Block Addressing (LBA) and FAT32 partitions. Various builds from 1999 up to 2003 were not released in retail, but used in products such as the IBM ServerGuide Scripting Toolkit. A build of this version of DOS appeared in Norton Ghost from Symantec. Version 7.1 indicates support for FAT32 also in MS-DOS.

Most builds of this version of DOS are limited to the kernel files , , and . The updated programs and allow one to prepare FAT32 disks. Additional utilities are taken from PC DOS 2000, where needed.

== PC DOS as a distributed file client ==

In 1986, IBM announced PC DOS support for client access to the file services defined by Distributed Data Management Architecture (DDM). This enabled programs on PCs to create, manage, and access record-oriented files available on IBM System/36, IBM System/38 and IBM mainframe computers running CICS. In 1988, client support for stream-oriented files and hierarchical directories was added to PC DOS when they became available on the DDM server systems.

<text>William &quot;Smokey&quot; Robinson Jr. (born February 19, 1940) is an American R&amp;B and soul singer, songwriter, record producer, and former record executive. He was the founder and frontman of the pioneering Motown vocal group the Miracles, for which he was also chief songwriter and producer. He led the group from its 1955 origins, when they were called The Five Chimes, until 1972, when he retired from the group to focus on his role as Motown Records vice president. Robinson returned to the music industry as a solo artist the following year. He left Motown in 1999.

Robinson was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987 and awarded the 2016 Library of Congress Gershwin Prize for his lifetime contributions to popular music. He is a double Hollywood Walk of Fame Inductee, as a solo artist (1983) and as a member of The Miracles (2009). In 2022, he was inducted into the Black Music &amp; Entertainment Walk of Fame.

==Early life and early career==
William Robinson Jr. was born to an African-American father and a mother of African-American and French descent in a poor family in the North End area of Detroit, Michigan. He had two maternal half-sisters, and his parents divorced when he was three years old.

Robinson&#x27;s ancestry is also part Nigerian, Scandinavian, Portuguese, and Cherokee. His uncle Claude gave him the nickname &quot;Smokey Joe&quot; when he was a child. In 2012, Robinson explained:

My Uncle Claude was my favorite uncle. He was also my godfather. He and I were really, really close. He used to take me to see cowboy movies all the time when I was a little boy because I loved cowboy movies. He got a cowboy name for me, which was Smokey Joe. So from the time I was three years old if people asked me what my name was I didn&#x27;t tell them my name was William, I told them my name was Smokey Joe. That&#x27;s what everyone called me until I was about 12 and then I dropped the Joe part. I&#x27;ve heard that story about him giving it to me because I&#x27;m a light skinned black man but that&#x27;s not true.

When Robinson was 10, his mother died, and he began living with older sister, Geraldine, with her husband, who had 10 children together.

He attended Northern High School, where he was above average academically and a determined athlete. However, his main interest was music, and he formed a doo-wop group named the Five Chimes. He and Aretha Franklin lived several houses from each other on Belmont; he said he&#x27;d known Franklin since she was about five, overhearing her play the piano when he had come to play with her older brother Cecil after her family first moved to Detroit.

Robinson&#x27;s interest in music started during childhood after he heard the groups Nolan Strong &amp; the Diablos and Billy Ward and his Dominoes on the radio. He has cited Barrett Strong, a Detroit native, as a strong vocal influence. In 1955, he formed the first lineup of The Five Chimes with childhood friend Ronald White and classmate Pete Moore.

Two years later, they were renamed the Matadors and included Bobby Rogers. Another member, Emerson (Sonny) Rogers, Bobby Rogers&#x27; cousin, was replaced by his sister, Claudette Rogers (who would marry Smokey Robinson in 1959). The group&#x27;s guitarist, Marv Tarplin, joined them sometime in 1958. The Matadors began touring Detroit venues around this time. Eventually they changed their name to The Miracles.

==Career==
===The Miracles and Motown===
In August 1957, Robinson and the Miracles met songwriter Berry Gordy after a failed audition for Brunswick Records. At that time during the audition, Robinson had brought along with him a &quot;Big 10&quot; notebook with 100 songs he wrote while in high school. Gordy was impressed with Robinson&#x27;s vocals and even more impressed with Robinson&#x27;s ambitious songwriting. With his help, the Miracles released their first single, &quot;Got a Job&quot;, an answer song to the Silhouettes&#x27; hit single &quot;Get a Job&quot; on End Records. It was the beginning of a long and successful collaboration. During this time, Robinson attended college and started classes in January 1959, studying electrical engineering. He dropped out after only two months, following the Miracles&#x27; release of their first record.

Gordy formed Tamla Records, which was later reincorporated as Motown. The Miracles became one of the first acts signed to the label, although they had actually been with Gordy since before the formation of Motown Records. In late 1960, the group recorded their first hit single, &quot;Shop Around&quot;, which became Motown&#x27;s first million-selling hit record. Between 1960 and 1970, Robinson would produce 26 top forty hits with the Miracles as lead singer, chief songwriter and producer, including several top ten hits such as &quot;You&#x27;ve Really Got a Hold on Me&quot;, &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Monkey&quot;, &quot;I Second That Emotion&quot;, &quot;Baby Baby Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; and the group&#x27;s only number-one hit during their Robinson years, &quot;The Tears of a Clown&quot;.

Other notable hits such as &quot;Ooo Baby Baby&quot;, &quot;Going to a Go-Go&quot;, the multi-award-winning &quot;The Tracks of My Tears&quot;, &quot;(Come Round Here) I&#x27;m The One You Need&quot;, &quot;The Love I Saw in You Was Just a Mirage&quot; and &quot;More Love&quot; peaked in the top twenty. In 1965, the Miracles were the first Motown group to change their name when they released their 1965 album &quot;Going to a Go-Go&quot; as Smokey Robinson &amp; the Miracles.

Between 1962 and 1966, Robinson was also one of the major songwriters and producers for Motown, penning many hit singles such as &quot;Two Lovers&quot;, &quot;The One Who Really Loves You&quot;, &quot;You Beat Me to the Punch&quot; and &quot;My Guy&quot; for Mary Wells; &quot;The Way You Do The Things You Do&quot;, &quot;My Girl&quot;, &quot;Since I Lost My Baby&quot; , &quot;It&#x27;s Growing&quot; , and &quot;Get Ready&quot; for the Temptations; &quot;Still Water (Love)&quot; for the Four Tops; &quot;When I&#x27;m Gone&quot; and &quot;Operator&quot; for Brenda Holloway; &quot;Don&#x27;t Mess With Bill&quot;, &quot;The Hunter Gets Captured by the Game&quot; and &quot;My Baby Must Be a Magician&quot; for the Marvelettes; and &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Doggone&quot; and &quot;Ain&#x27;t That Peculiar&quot; for Marvin Gaye.

After the arrival of Holland–Dozier–Holland and the team of Norman Whitfield and Barrett Strong, Robinson was eclipsed as a top writer and producer for the label, and other Motown artists such as Gaye and Stevie Wonder began to compose more original material. Later in his career, Robinson wrote lyrics and music for the Contours such as &quot;First I Look at the Purse&quot;, as well as the Four Tops&#x27; &quot;Still Water&quot; and The Supremes&#x27; &quot;Floy Joy&quot;. The other Miracles—Bobby Rogers, Pete Moore, Ronnie White, and Marv Tarplin—collaborated with him as writers on many of these hits, and Pete Moore also doubled as co-producer with Robinson on several of them.

By 1969, Robinson wanted to retire from touring to focus on raising his two children with his wife Claudette, and on his duties as Motown&#x27;s vice president, a job he had taken on by the mid-1960s after Esther Gordy Edwards had left the position. However, the success of the group&#x27;s &quot;Tears of a Clown&quot; made Robinson stay with the group until 1972. His last performance with the group was in July 1972 in Washington, D.C.

===Solo career===

After a year of retirement, Robinson announced his comeback with the release of the eponymous &quot;Smokey&quot; album, in 1973. The album included the Miracles tribute song, &quot;Sweet Harmony&quot;, and the hit ballad &quot;Baby Come Close&quot;. In 1974, Robinson&#x27;s second album, &quot;Pure Smokey&quot;, was released but failed to produce hits. Robinson struggled to compete with his former collaborators Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder and former Temptations member Eddie Kendricks, as all three had multiple hit singles during this period.

Former Beatle George Harrison featured the track &quot;Pure Smokey&quot; on his 1976 album &quot;Thirty Three &amp; 1/3&quot; as a tribute to Robinson. (Harrison&#x27;s fellow Beatles John Lennon and Paul McCartney were also fans of Robinson&#x27;s songwriting and the group covered &quot;You Really Gotta Hold on Me&quot; on their second UK album &quot;With the Beatles&quot; and US album &quot;The Beatles&#x27; Second Album&quot;, respectively.)

Robinson answered his critics the following year with &quot;A Quiet Storm&quot;, released in 1975. The album launched three singles – the number-one R&amp;B hit &quot;Baby That&#x27;s Backatcha&quot;, &quot;The Agony &amp; The Ecstasy&quot; and &quot;Quiet Storm&quot; (the radio format quiet storm, originated by DJ Melvin Lindsey, is named after the album). However, Robinson&#x27;s solo career suffered from his work as Motown&#x27;s vice president, and his own music took the backseat. As a result, several albums including &quot;Smokey&#x27;s Family Robinson&quot;, &quot;Deep in My Soul&quot;, &quot;Love Breeze&quot; and &quot;Smokin&quot;, saw poor promotion and received bad reviews. At this point Robinson relied on other writers and producers to help him with his albums.

Following these albums, Robinson got out of a writer&#x27;s block after his close collaborator (and fellow Miracle), Marv Tarplin, who joined him on the road in 1973 after Robinson left the Miracles, presented him a tune he had composed on his guitar. Robinson later wrote the lyrics that became his first solo top ten Pop single, &quot;Cruisin&#x27;&quot;. The song hit number one in Cash Box and peaked at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. It also became his first solo number one in New Zealand. Robinson would follow a similar approach with his next album, &quot;Warm Thoughts&quot;, which produced another top 40 hit, &quot;Let Me Be the Clock&quot;, though it did not repeat the success of &quot;Cruisin&#x27;&quot;.

In 1981, Robinson topped the charts again with another sensual ballad, &quot;Being with You&quot;, which was another number one hit in Cash Box and peaked at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. It also hit number one in the UK Singles Chart, becoming his most successful single to date. The Gold-plus parent album sparked a partnership with George Tobin and with Tobin, Robinson released his next several Motown albums, &quot;Yes It&#x27;s You Lady&quot;, which produced the hit &quot;Tell Me Tomorrow&quot;, &quot;Touch the Sky&quot; and &quot;Essar&quot;. In 1983, Robinson teamed up with fellow Motown label mate Rick James recording the R&amp;B ballad, &quot;Ebony Eyes&quot;.

In 1987, following a period of personal and professional issues, Robinson made a comeback with the album, &quot;One Heartbeat&quot; and the singles, &quot;Just to See Her&quot; and &quot;One Heartbeat&quot;, which were Top 10 hits on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Pop, Soul, and Adult Contemporary charts. They were aided by popular music videos. &quot;Just to See Her&quot; won Robinson his first Grammy Award in 1988. The album became one of his most successful ever, selling over 900,000 copies in the United States alone. In the same year, Robinson released &quot;One Heartbeat&quot;, the UK group ABC released a tribute song, &quot;When Smokey Sings&quot;.

He was inducted as a solo artist to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988, later igniting controversy as the committee had inducted only Robinson and not members of his group, the Miracles, which Robinson saw as an affront. In 2012, however, the committee rectified the mistake announcing that the group would be inducted on their own merit. Though Robinson was not listed as an inductee, he was due to induct his former group at the ceremony in April 2012.

After MCA purchased Motown in 1988, Robinson relinquished his position as vice president. Following the release of the album, &quot;Love Smokey&quot;, in 1990, Robinson left Motown for a deal with SBK Records in 1991. However, the album, &quot;Double Good Everything&quot; failed to chart. Robinson remained virtually quiet during the nineties (though he would make a notable cameo appearance in The Temptations 1998 miniseries), making a brief comeback in 1999 when he re-signed with Motown and issued the album, &quot;Intimate&quot;, which included the song &quot;Easy to Love&quot;.

In 2003, he once again split ties with Motown, releasing the gospel album, &quot;Food for the Spirit&quot; on Liquid 8 Records in 2004. In 2004, Robinson sang the main title theme song &quot;Colorful World&quot; to the American children&#x27;s animated series &quot;ToddWorld&quot; for Discovery Kids, TLC and Mike Young Productions. Two years later, Robinson released the standards album, &quot;Timeless Love&quot;, in 2006 on Universal Records.

In 2009, he issued the album, &quot;Time Flies When You&#x27;re Having Fun&quot; on his own label, Robso Records. It reached number 59 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart, his highest showing since &quot;One Heartbeat&quot;. He subsequently released &quot;Now And Then&quot; in 2010, which peaked at number 131.

&quot;Smokey &amp; Friends&quot; was released in mid-August 2014. It was an album of duets, including songs with Elton John, Linda Ronstadt and James Taylor. It reached number 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart.

&quot;Christmas Everyday&quot; was Robinson&#x27;s first post-Miracles Christmas album, and was released on November 10, 2017. In 2018, he appeared on an episode of CMT Crossroads alongside country singer Cam.

In April 2017, Robinson visited Fremont-Lopez Elementary School in Stockton, California, where he served as a designated arts mentor under Turnaround Arts.

On July 31, 2018, Robinson appeared on the Fox network&#x27;s show &quot;Beat Shazam&quot; as a special guest.

Robinson appeared on the song &quot;Make It Better&quot; from Anderson Paak&#x27;s 2019 album &quot;Ventura&quot;.

In 2023, Robinson announced that he would release his first album in almost a decade in April 2023. The nine-track album will be called &quot;Gasms&quot;, and will feature entirely new music. The first single from the album, called &quot;If We Don&#x27;t Have Each Other&quot;, was already available on streaming services by January 2023.

==Personal life==
Robinson married a fellow Miracles member, Claudette Rogers, in 1959. The couple had two children: a son, Berry Robinson (born 1968), named after Motown&#x27;s first label founder Berry Gordy, and a daughter, Tamla Robinson (born 1971), named after the original &quot;Tamla&quot; label set up by Gordy that would eventually become Motown.

According to Robinson, he had affairs with multiple women while married to Claudette, among them an approximately year-long affair with Diana Ross. According to Robinson, Ross ended it because she felt uncomfortable as she was friends with Claudette, whom Robinson admitted he still loved. (A representative for Ross had no comment on Robinson&#x27;s claim.) Robinson says that loving multiple people in that way simultaneously is natural.

Robinson also had a son named Trey (born 1984) with another woman during his marriage to Claudette. After Robinson admitted to having fathered a child with a woman other than his wife, he filed for legal separation and later filed for divorce that was finalized in 1986. The Robinsons had also separated in 1974 and during that separation, Robinson engaged in an extramarital affair that inspired the song &quot;The Agony &amp; The Ecstasy&quot; (later featured on &quot;A Quiet Storm&quot;).

Robinson married Frances Gladney in May 2002. They own a home in Pittsburgh and use it as a winery.

Robinson has not eaten red meat since 1972. He practices Transcendental Meditation. Robinson has golden green eyes, which he believes were passed down from his French great-grandmother.

Beginning in November 2023, Robinson is the current owner and host of the SiriusXM channel &quot;Soul Town&quot;, a station that plays R&amp;B and soul hits from the 1950s to the early 1980s. Released under the banner &quot;Smokey&#x27;s Soul Town&quot;, Robinson occasionally appears on the channel, recalling his best moments with Motown and meeting other artists as well as pick his favorite songs during that time period.

==Awards and accolades==
On February 22, 1983, Smokey was awarded an individual star on The Hollywood Walk of Fame.
Four years later, in 1987, Robinson was inducted to the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame. Robinson&#x27;s single &quot;Just to See Her&quot; from the &quot;One Heartbeat&quot; album was awarded the 1988 Grammy Award for Grammy Award for Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance. This was Robinson&#x27;s first Grammy Award. One year later, in 1989, he was inducted to the Songwriter&#x27;s Hall of Fame

In 1993, Robinson was awarded a medal at the National Medal of Arts. Two years before, he won the Heritage Award at the Soul Train Music Awards. In 2005, Robinson was voted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame. At its 138th Commencement Convocation in May 2006, Howard University conferred on Robinson the degree of Doctor of Music, &quot;honoris causa&quot;. In December 2006 Robinson was one of five Kennedy Center honorees, along with Dolly Parton, Zubin Mehta, Steven Spielberg and Andrew Lloyd Webber.

On March 20, 2009, the Miracles were finally honored as a &quot;group&quot; with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Smokey was present with original Miracles members Bobby Rogers, Pete Moore, (Bobby&#x27;s cousin) Claudette Rogers, and Gloria White, accepting for her husband, the late Ronnie White, whose daughter Pamela and granddaughter Maya were there representing him as well. Smokey&#x27;s replacement, 1970s Miracles lead singer Billy Griffin, was also honored.

Controversially, original Miracle Marv Tarplin was not honored, against the wishes of his fellow Miracles and the group&#x27;s fans, who felt that he should have also been there to share the honor.
Later, Tarplin did receive his star. He was also inducted with the rest of the original Miracles, Bobby Rogers, Pete Moore, Ronnie White, and Claudette Robinson, into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012, 25 years after Robinson&#x27;s controversial solo induction in 1987. He was also awarded Society of Singers Lifetime Achievement Award in 2011.

In 2009, Robinson received an honorary doctorate degree—along with Linda Ronstadt—and gave a commencement speech at Berklee College of Music&#x27;s commencement ceremony. In 2015, he was given a BET Lifetime Achievement Award.

In 2016, Robinson received the Library of Congress&#x27; Gershwin Prize for Popular Song; and, on August 21, 2016, he was inducted into the National Rhythm &amp; Blues Hall of Fame in his hometown of Detroit.

In 2019, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement presented by Awards Council members Jimmy Page and Peter Gabriel.

In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Robinson at No. 23 on their list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.

<text>Bruno Walter (born Bruno Schlesinger, September 15, 1876February 17, 1962) was a German-born conductor, pianist, and composer. Born in Berlin, he escaped Nazi Germany in 1933, was naturalised as a French citizen in 1938, and settled in the United States in 1939. He worked closely with Gustav Mahler, whose music he helped to establish in the repertory, held major positions with the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, New York Philharmonic, Concertgebouw Orchestra, Salzburg Festival, Vienna State Opera, Bavarian State Opera, Staatsoper Unter den Linden and Deutsche Oper Berlin, among others, made recordings of historical and artistic significance, and is widely considered to be one of the great conductors of the 20th century.

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
Born near Alexanderplatz in Berlin to a middle-class Jewish family, he began his musical education at the Stern Conservatory at the age of eight, making his first public appearance as a pianist when he was nine; he performed a concerto movement with the Berlin Philharmonic in 1889 and a full concerto with them in February 1890. He studied composition at Stern with Robert Radecke, and remained active as a composer until about 1910 (see list of compositions below). But it was hearing a concert in 1889 by the Berlin Philharmonic led by Hans von Bülow, he wrote, that &quot;decided my future. Now I knew what I was meant for. No musical activity but that of an orchestral conductor could any longer be considered by me.&quot; He made his conducting début at the Cologne Opera with Albert Lortzing&#x27;s &quot;Der Waffenschmied&quot; in 1894. Later that year he left for the Hamburg Opera to work as a chorus director. There he first met and worked with Gustav Mahler, whom he revered and with whose music he later became strongly identified.

=== Conducting ===
In 1896, he was appointed Kapellmeister of the Stadttheater (municipal opera) in Breslau, on the strength of a recommendation from Mahler to the theater&#x27;s director, Theodor Löwe. However, Löwe required that before taking up this position the young conductor change his last name from Schlesinger—which literally means Silesian—&quot;because of its frequent occurrence in the capital of Silesia&quot;.
In a letter to his brother, paraphrased by biographers Erik Ryding and Rebecca Pechefsky, Walter said that he had &quot;suggested several names, which Mahler wrote down and gave to Löwe, who returned the contract with the name Bruno Walter&quot;. These biographers add that Walter wrote to his parents that he found that &quot;having to change his name was &#x27;terrible&#x27;&quot;. They report that Mahler and his sisters &quot;pressed&quot; Walter to make the change of name, and add that contrary to occasional unsubstantiated reports, it &quot;is unknown&quot; whether Löwe&#x27;s stipulation had anything to do with a desire to conceal Walter&#x27;s Jewish origins.

In 1897, Walter became Chief Conductor at the municipal opera in Pressburg (now Bratislava). He found the town provincial and depressing, and in 1898 took the position of Chief Conductor of the Riga Opera, Russian Empire. While there, he converted to Christianity, probably Roman Catholicism. In 1899 Walter was appointed music director of the Temeswar, Austria-Hungary (now Timișoara, Romania) Opera, the current Banatul Philharmonic of Timișoara. Walter then returned in 1900 to Berlin, where he assumed the post of Royal Prussian Conductor at the Staatsoper Unter den Linden, succeeding Franz Schalk; his colleagues there included Richard Strauss and Karl Muck. While in Berlin he also conducted the premiere of &quot;Der arme Heinrich&quot; by Hans Pfitzner, who became a lifelong friend.

In 1901, Walter accepted Mahler&#x27;s invitation to be his assistant at the Court Opera in Vienna. Walter led Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Aida&quot; at his debut. In 1907 he was elected by the Vienna Philharmonic to conduct its Nicolai Concert. In 1910, he helped Mahler select and coach solo singers for the premiere of Mahler&#x27;s Symphony No. 8. In the following years Walter&#x27;s conducting reputation soared as he was invited to conduct across Europe—in Prague, in London where in 1910 he conducted &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; and Ethel Smyth&#x27;s &quot;The Wreckers&quot; at Covent Garden, and in Rome. When Mahler died on May 18, 1911, Walter was at his deathbed. On June 6, he wrote to his sister that he was to conduct the premiere of Mahler&#x27;s Das Lied von der Erde; he did so in Munich on November 20, 1911, in the first half of an all-Mahler concert (the second half contained Mahler&#x27;s Symphony No. 2). On June 26, 1912, he led the Vienna Philharmonic in the world premiere of Mahler&#x27;s Symphony No. 9.

=== Munich ===
Although Walter became an Austrian citizen in 1911, he left Vienna in 1913 to become the Royal Bavarian Music Director and General Music Director of the Bavarian State Opera in Munich. While there, argue Erik Ryding and Rebecca Pechefsky, &quot;Walter&#x27;s contribution to the history of Wagner performance [was] more significant than many realize. The Bayreuth Festival was suspended after 1914 and resumed only in 1924. During those nine years, Munich was the centre of authentic Wagner performance; its Prinzregenttheather was closely patterned after the Festspielhaus in Bayreuth, and its National Theatre had seen the world premieres of &quot;Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg&quot;, &quot;Das Rheingold&quot;, &quot;Die Walküre&quot;, and &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;. Walter was the city&#x27;s music director for most of this period, and he presided over most of the Wagnerian repertoire.&quot;

In January 1914, Walter conducted his first concert in Moscow. During the First World War he remained actively involved in conducting, giving premieres to Erich Wolfgang Korngold&#x27;s &quot;Violanta&quot; and &quot;Der Ring des Polykrates&quot; as well as Hans Pfitzner&#x27;s &quot;Palestrina&quot;. In 1920, he conducted the premiere of Walter Braunfels&#x27; &quot;Die Vögel&quot;.

In Munich, Walter was a good friend of Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli (later Pope Pius XII). Walter&#x27;s close friendship with Thomas Mann seems to have begun in Munich by 1914.

=== United States ===
Walter ended his Munich appointment in 1922 (being succeeded by Hans Knappertsbusch) and left for New York in 1923, working with the New York Symphony Orchestra in Carnegie Hall; he later conducted in Detroit, Minnesota and Boston.

=== Berlin, Leipzig, Vienna ===
Back in Europe, Walter made his debuts with both the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra and the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra in 1923, and was Music Director of the Deutsche Oper Berlin &quot;(Städtische Oper)&quot; from 1925 to 1929. He made his debut at La Scala in 1926, and was chief conductor of the German seasons at Covent Garden in London from 1924 to 1931.

Walter served as Principal Conductor of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra from 1929 until March 1933, when his tenure was cut short by the new Nazi government, as detailed below.

In speeches in the late 1920s, Nazi leader Adolf Hitler had complained bitterly about the presence of Jewish conductors at the Berlin opera, and mentioned Walter a number of times, adding to Walter&#x27;s name the words &quot;alias Schlesinger.&quot; When the Nazis took power, they undertook a systematic process of barring Jews from artistic life.

As reported by biographers Erik Ryding and Rebecca Pechefsky, when Hitler became Chancellor in January 1933, Walter was conducting in New York, but the next month sailed back to Leipzig planning to conduct his previously scheduled concerts with the Gewandhaus Orchestra in March. However, Leipzig&#x27;s Chief of Police informed management that he would cancel the concerts if Walter was to conduct them. Management resisted and Walter led rehearsals, but on the day that the first concert was to take place, the police, &quot;in the name of the Saxon ministry of the interior,&quot; forbade the dress rehearsal and the concerts; Walter left Leipzig. Walter was then scheduled to conduct the Berlin Philharmonic on March 20, but its management was warned by Joseph Goebbels that &quot;unpleasant demonstrations&quot; might occur at the concert, and the Propaganda Ministry clarified this by saying that there would be violence in the hall. Hearing of this, Walter chose to withdraw, saying to management, &quot;Then I have no further business here.&quot; The concert in the end was conducted by Richard Strauss. Walter later wrote, &quot;The composer of Ein Heldenleben [&quot;A Hero&#x27;s Life&quot;] actually declared himself ready to conduct in place of a forcibly removed colleague.&quot; A concert that Walter was scheduled to lead in Frankfurt was also cancelled. Walter left Germany and was not to conduct there again until after the war.
Austria became his main center of activity for the next several years. He and his family moved to Vienna, where he regularly conducted the Vienna Philharmonic—with whom he made a number of momentous recordings during this period—and at the Salzburg Festival. In 1936 he accepted an offer to be Artistic Director of the Vienna State Opera, where he occupied the same office that had once been Mahler&#x27;s. He was also appointed Permanent Guest Conductor (&quot;eerste dirigent&quot;) of the Amsterdam Concertgebouw Orchestra from 1934 to 1939, and made guest appearances such as in annual concerts with the New York Philharmonic from 1932 to 1936. When Nazi Germany annexed Austriathe &quot;Anschluss&quot;in 1938, Walter was in the Netherlands conducting the Concertgebouw Orchestra. His elder daughter Lotte was in Vienna at the time, and was arrested by the Nazis; Walter was able to use his influence to free her. He also used his influence to find safe quarters in Scandinavia for his brother and sister during the war.

Walter&#x27;s daughter Marguerite &quot;Gretel&quot; (born 1906) was murdered on August 21, 1939, by her husband Robert Neppach, who then killed himself; his motive was jealousy over her growing relationship with the Italian bass singer Ezio Pinza. Walter&#x27;s wife Elsa, née Korneck (born in 1871) fell into a permanent depression and died in 1945, and Walter blamed himself for the tragedy, as his daughter had met Pinza only because Walter had made special efforts to hire him to sing the role of Don Giovanni.

=== Return to the United States ===
On November 1, 1939, he set sail for the United States, which became his permanent home. He settled in Beverly Hills, California, where his many expatriate neighbors included Thomas Mann.

While Walter had many influences within music, in his &quot;Of Music and Making&quot; (1957) he notes a profound influence from the philosopher Rudolf Steiner. He notes, &quot;In old age I have had the good fortune to be initiated into the world of anthroposophy and during the past few years to make a profound study of the teachings of Rudolf Steiner. Here we see alive and in operation that deliverance of which Friedrich Hölderlin speaks; its blessing has flowed over me, and so this book is the confession of belief in anthroposophy. There is no part of my inward life that has not had new light shed upon it, or been stimulated, by the lofty teachings of Rudolf Steiner ... I am profoundly grateful for having been so boundlessly enriched ... It is glorious to become a learner again at my time of life. I have a sense of the rejuvenation of my whole being which gives strength and renewal to my musicianship, even to my music-making.&quot;

During his years in the United States, Walter worked with many famous American orchestras. In December 1942, he was offered the music directorship of the New York Philharmonic, but declined, citing his age; then in February 1947, after the resignation of Artur Rodzinski, he accepted the position but changed the title to &quot;Music Adviser&quot; (he resigned in 1949). Among other orchestras he worked with were the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the NBC Symphony Orchestra, and the Philadelphia Orchestra. From 1946 onwards, he made numerous trips back to Europe, becoming an important musical figure in the early years of the Edinburgh Festival and in Salzburg, Vienna and Munich. He also coached &amp; accompanied Kathleen Ferrier in London throughout the post war period until her premature death in 1953 &amp; was an ardent fan of her singing. In September 1950 he returned to Berlin for the first time since the aborted concert of 1933; he conducted the Berlin Philharmonic in a program of Beethoven, Mozart, Richard Strauss, and Brahms, and &quot;gave a lecture for the students of the Municipal Conservatory – formerly his old school, the Stern Conservatory – at the students&#x27; request&quot;. His late life was marked by stereo recordings with the Columbia Symphony Orchestra, an ensemble of professional musicians assembled by Columbia Records for recordings. He made his last live concert appearance on December 4, 1960, with the Los Angeles Philharmonic and pianist Van Cliburn. His last recording was a series of Mozart overtures with the Columbia Symphony Orchestra at the end of March in 1961.

=== Death ===

Bruno Walter died of a heart attack in his Beverly Hills home in 1962. His final resting place is in the cemetery of Gentilino near Lugano in the Canton of Ticino, Switzerland, in the same grave where his wife and their daughter Gretel had already been buried. Their daughter Lotte (1903–1970) was buried there as well.

=== Recordings ===

Walter&#x27;s work is documented on hundreds of recordings made between 1900 (when he was 24) and 1961. Most listeners became familiar with him through the stereo recordings made in his last few years, when his health was declining. Some critics have suggested that these recordings do not fully convey what Walter&#x27;s art must have sounded like in its prime. The late recordings are said to have a geniality that contrasts with the energetic, intense and mercurial performances of earlier decades. Furthermore, Walter&#x27;s late recordings focus mostly on older compositions, whereas in his youth he often conducted what was then considered newer music.

Walter worked closely with Mahler as an assistant and protégé. Mahler did not live to perform his &quot;Das Lied von der Erde&quot; or &quot;Symphony No. 9&quot;, but his widow, Alma Mahler, asked Walter to premiere both. Walter led the first performance of &quot;Das Lied &quot;in 1911 in Munich and of the Ninth in 1912 in Vienna with the Vienna Philharmonic. Decades later, Walter and the Vienna Philharmonic (with Mahler&#x27;s brother-in-law Arnold Rosé still a concertmaster) made the first recordings of &quot;Das Lied von der Erde&quot; in 1936 and of the Ninth Symphony in 1938. Both were recorded live in concert, the latter only two months before the Nazi Anschluss drove Walter (and Rosé) into exile.

These recordings are of special interest for the performance practices of the orchestra and also for intensity of expression. Walter was to re-record both works successfully in later decades. His famous Decca &quot;Das Lied von der Erde&quot; with Kathleen Ferrier, Julius Patzak and the Vienna Philharmonic was made in May 1952, and he recorded it again in stereo, with the New York Philharmonic, in 1960. He conducted the New York Philharmonic in the 1957 stereo recording of the Second Symphony. He recorded the Ninth in stereo in 1961. These recordings, as well as his other American recordings, were released initially by Columbia Records and later on CD by Sony.

Since Mahler himself never conducted the Ninth Symphony and &quot;Das Lied von der Erde&quot;, Walter&#x27;s performances cannot be taken as documentations of Mahler&#x27;s interpretations. However, in the light of Walter&#x27;s personal connection with the composer and his having given the original performances, they have another kind of primary authenticity. In his other (greatly esteemed) recordings of Mahler—various songs and the First, Second, Fourth, and Fifth Symphonies—there is the great added interest that he had heard Mahler&#x27;s own performances of most of them.

Walter made many highly acclaimed recordings of other great Germanic composers, such as Mozart, Haydn, Beethoven, Schubert, Johannes Brahms, Johann Strauss Jr., and Anton Bruckner, as well as of Bach, Wagner, Schumann, Dvorak, Richard Strauss, Tchaikovsky, Smetana, and others. Walter was a leading conductor of opera, and recordings of Mozart&#x27;s Don Giovanni and The Marriage of Figaro from both the Metropolitan Opera and the Salzburg Festival, of Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Fidelio&quot;, and of Wagner and Verdi are now available on CD. Also of great interest are recordings from the 1950s of his rehearsals of Mozart, Mahler and Brahms, which give insight into his musical priorities and into the warm and non-tyrannical manner—as contrasted with some of his colleagues—with which he related to orchestras.

=== Compositions ===
Walter composed actively until at least 1910. As detailed in the biography by Erik Ryding and Rebecca Pechefsky, his compositions include:

<text>PricewaterhouseCoopers International Limited is a British multinational professional services brand of firms, operating as partnerships under the PwC brand. It is the second-largest professional services network in the world and is considered one of the Big Four accounting firms, along with Deloitte, EY, and KPMG.

PwC firms are in 149 countries, with 370,000 people. 26% of the workforce was based in the Americas, 26% in Asia, 32% in Western Europe, and 5% in Middle East and Africa. The company&#x27;s global revenues were US$50.3 billion in FY 2022, of which $18.0 billion was generated by its Assurance practice, $11.6 billion by its Tax and Legal practice and $20.7 billion by its Advisory practice. The firm in its recent actual form was created in 1998 by a merger between two accounting firms: Coopers &amp; Lybrand, and Price Waterhouse. Both firms had histories dating back to the 19th century. The trading name was shortened to PwC in September 2010 as part of a rebranding effort.

The firm has been embroiled in a number of corruption controversies and crime scandals. The firm has on multiple occasions been implicated in tax evasion and tax avoidance practices. The firm has frequently been fined by regulators for performing audits that fail to meet basic auditing standards. Amid Russia&#x27;s war in Ukraine, PwC assisted Russian oligarchs to hide their wealth and contributed to bypassing global sanctions placed on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.

==History==
The firm was created in September 1998 when Coopers &amp; Lybrand merged with Price Waterhouse.

===Coopers &amp; Lybrand===
In 1854, William Cooper founded an accountancy practice in London. It became Cooper Brothers seven years later when his three brothers joined.

In 1898, Robert H. Montgomery, William M. Lybrand, Adam A. Ross Jr. and his brother T. Edward Ross formed Lybrand, Ross Brothers and Montgomery in the United States.

In 1957, Cooper Brothers, along with Lybrand, Ross Bros &amp; Montgomery and a Canadian firm (McDonald, Currie and Co.), agreed to adopt the name Coopers &amp; Lybrand in international practice. In 1973, the three member firms in the UK, US and Canada changed their names to Coopers &amp; Lybrand. Then in 1980, Coopers &amp; Lybrand expanded its expertise in insolvency substantially by acquiring Cork Gully, a leading firm in that field in the UK. In 1990, in certain countries, including the UK, Coopers &amp; Lybrand merged with Deloitte, Haskins &amp; Sells to become Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte; in 1992 they reverted to Coopers &amp; Lybrand.

===Price Waterhouse===
In 1849, Samuel Lowell Price, an accountant, founded an accountancy practice in London. In 1865, Price went into partnership with William Hopkins Holyland and Edwin Waterhouse. Holyland left shortly afterwards to work alone in accountancy and the firm was known from 1874 as Price, Waterhouse &amp; Co. The original partnership agreement, signed by Price, Holyland, and Waterhouse could be found in Southwark Towers.

By the late 19th century, Price Waterhouse had gained recognition as an accounting firm. They opened an office in New York City in 1890, and the American firm expanded. The original British firm opened an office in Liverpool in 1904, and then elsewhere in the United Kingdom and worldwide, each time establishing a separate partnership in each country: the worldwide practice of Price Waterhouse was, therefore, a federation of collaborating firms that had grown organically, rather than the result of an international merger.

In a further effort to take advantage of economies of scale, PW and Arthur Andersen discussed a merger in 1989 but the negotiations failed, mainly because of conflicts of interest such as Andersen&#x27;s strong commercial links with IBM and PW&#x27;s audit of IBM, as well as the two firms&#x27; radically different cultures. It was said by those involved with the failed merger that at the end of the discussion, the partners at the table realized they had different views of business, and the potential merger was scrapped.

===1998 to present===
In 1998, Price Waterhouse and Coopers &amp; Lybrand merged to form PricewaterhouseCoopers (written with a lowercase &quot;w&quot; and a camel case &quot;C&quot;). At that time, MCS was the largest and fastest growing division.

The fallout from the Enron, Worldcom and other financial auditing scandals led to the demise of Arthur Andersen, reducing the count of the Big Five accounting firms down to the Big Four and spurring passage of the 2002 Sarbanes–Oxley Act (SOX). Among other restrictions, SOX severely limited the overlap between management consulting and auditing services. PwC Consulting continued to split itself off, conducting business under its name and branding rather than as the MCS division of PwC. Around July 2000, PwC began to prepare for either an acquisition or IPO by developing separate financial records that would be required for due diligence. PwC leadership began to seek buyers, with an initial interest by Hewlett-Packard for a reported $17 billion, but negotiations broke down in 2000. Almost a year after the collapse of Arthur Andersen in 2001, Arthur Andersen, LLP affiliates in Hong Kong and mainland China completed talks to join PricewaterhouseCoopers, China.

In 2000, PwC acquired Canada&#x27;s largest SAP consulting partner, Omnilogic Systems, to expand its developing consulting presence in Canada. PwC announced in May 2002 that PwC Consulting would be spun off as an independent entity and filed with the SEC for an initial $1B IPO to trade in August. Because PwC accounting partners owned 60% of PwC Consulting, an IPO or acquisition was seen as the only way to split the two firms without decimating the consulting arm&#x27;s working capital.

PwC Consulting leadership continued to fluff financials by expanding across-the-board pay cuts, terminating its variable compensation program, and furthering deep layoffs, all rare actions in the industry. In June 2002, PwC Consulting hired Continental Airlines&#x27; Greg Brennerman as CEO to run the global division. A week later, it was announced that an outside consultancy, Wolff Olins, had created new branding for the consulting group, called &quot;Monday&quot;. The firm&#x27;s CEO, Greg Brenneman described the unusual name as &quot;a real word, concise, recognizable, global and the right fit for a company that works hard to deliver results.&quot; In July 2002, it was rumored that PwC was in talks with an unknown public company, as no PR space or announcement for the impending IPO had been set. Those rumors were confirmed in August 2002, when PwC announced it sold Monday to IBM for approximately $3.5 billion in cash and stock. Monday was consolidated into IBM Global Business Services while partners became employees for the first time. The acquisition had a modest increase in the size and capabilities of IBM&#x27;s growing consulting practice, as IBM had 150,000 employees at the time. At the same time, Monday carried just 30,000 at the time. However, it was seen as a win by IBM since PwC Consulting/Monday&#x27;s valuation had suffered after the post-9/11 recession.

PwC began rebuilding its consulting practice with acquisitions such as Paragon Consulting Group and the commercial services business of BearingPoint in 2009. The firm continued this process by acquiring Diamond Management &amp; Technology Consultants in November 2010, and PRTM in August 2011. In 2012, the firm acquired Logan Tod &amp; Co, a digital analytics and optimisation consultancy, and Ant&#x27;s Eye View, a social media strategy development and consulting firm to build upon PwC&#x27;s growing Management Consulting customer impact and customer engagement capabilities.

In April 2014, Booz &amp; Company combined with PwC to form Strategy&amp;. In 2013, PwC acquired BGT Partners. In 2016, PwC acquired technology/consulting firm NSI DMCC. In January 2017, PwC announced a five-year agreement with GE to provide managed tax services to GE on a global basis, transferring more than 600 of GE&#x27;s in-house global tax team to PwC. In November 2017, PwC accepted bitcoin as payment for advisory services, the first time the company, or any of the Big Four accounting firms, accepted virtual currency as payment. Veritas Capital acquired PwC&#x27;s US public sector business in 2018, and branded the new company as Guidehouse. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) has utilized the services of PwC to tally the votes for the Academy Awards since 1935.

In May 2024, PwC became ChatGPT Enterprise&#x27;s biggest customer and will also start reselling OpenAI&#x27;s service for other large businesses.

== Operations ==
PwC refers to the PwC network and/or one or more of its member firms, each of which is a separate legal entity due to local legislative requirements. Much like other professional services firms, each member firm is financially and legally independent. PwC is co-ordinated by a private company limited by guarantee under English law, called PricewaterhouseCoopers International Limited. In addition, PwC is registered as a multidisciplinary entity which also provides legal services.

PwC&#x27;s operations are global, with Europe accounting for 36% of the total, and the Americas 44%, as of 2016. PwC&#x27;s largest growth in FY18 was in Asia where revenues were up 15%, followed by 12% revenue growth from the Middle East and Africa.

===Service lines===
PwC is organized into the following three service lines (the 2017 revenue shares are listed in parentheses):
* Assurance (41%) – Assurance services are those typically associated with financial audits.
* Advisory (33%) – Advisory services offered by PwC include two actuarial consultancy departments; Actuarial and Insurance Management Solutions (AIMS) and a sub branch of &quot;Human Resource Services&quot; (HRS). Actuarial covers mainly 5 areas: pensions, life insurance, non-life insurance, health, and investments. AIMS deals with life and non-life insurance and investments, while HRS deals mainly with pensions and group health. PwC has also expanded into digital media and advertising.
* Tax (25%) – International tax planning

=== Data analysis ===
Due to its size, PwC is able to contribute data analysis to a wide range of areas. 
* Calculation of the drone market size: PwC published a 2016 report stating that the world drone market would reach close to $127 billion by 2020, with Poland at the forefront of legislation for the commercial use of unmanned aerial vehicles.
* PwC coined the term E7 to describe the seven emerging economies which the company is predicting will take over today&#x27;s G7 nations by 2050. Those seven emerging nations are China, Russia, India, Mexico, Indonesia, Turkey and Brazil.
* PwC assesses a country&#x27;s risk premium, an important factor in analyzing the valuation of an entity.
* The company analyzes pay parity, the comparative salaries for men versus women. In early 2017, PwC found in its Women in Work Index study that it could take the UK 24 years, until 2041, to close its gender pay gap.
* PwC publishes the Low Carbon Economy Index, which tracks the extent to which the G20 countries are reducing carbon emissions.
* The Economy of the Sea is a long-term analysis project of PwC Portugal.

==Logo==
The following are the several logos the company has used through the years. The current PwC logo was introduced in September 2010, when the company changed its trading name from PricewaterhouseCoopers to PwC. It was designed by Wolff Olins.

== Corporate affairs and culture ==

The company employs large numbers of young workers, with 80% of their workforce millennials as of 2017. According to PwC, the company uses education to bridge the culture gap between generations. The firm also implements a three-step &quot;Connect-Embed-Improve&quot; plan to promote employee engagement. The company requires senior-level staff to continue to train and learn; PwC also created a social collaboration platform called Spark to enable employees to access course materials and assignments, complete prerequisites and access reinforcement materials.

In 2016, Tim Ryan, PwC&#x27;s chairman, helped launch the CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion coalition, the largest CEO-driven business commitment to advance diversity and inclusion in the workplace.

Employees at PwC generally have flexibility in choosing their own working hours provided that senior management deems the arrangement acceptable. In 2002, PwC published the accounting profession&#x27;s first global &quot;Code of Conduct&quot;.

Reports on PwC&#x27;s involvement in the Australian tax scandal revealed an alternate &quot;shadow culture&quot; that operates separately from its public-facing culture. The &quot;shadow culture&quot; prioritizes loyalty to superiors, unquestioning acceptance of the status quo, and a mentality of revenue &quot;growth at all costs&quot;, even to the point of rulebreaking.

== Controversies ==
The firm has been embroiled in a number of corruption controversies and crime scandals. The firm has on multiple occasions been implicated in tax evasion and tax avoidance practices. The company has aided war criminals in evading sanctions. The company has frequently performed insufficient audits, whereby it performs auditing services that vouch for the finances of companies without following basic auditing standards.

===Gender employment discrimination===
In 1989, the United States Supreme Court held that Price Waterhouse must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the decision regarding Ann Hopkins&#x27;s employment would have been the same if sex discrimination had not occurred. The accounting firm failed to prove that the same decision to postpone Hopkins&#x27;s promotion to the partnership would have still been made in the absence of sex discrimination, and therefore, the employment decision constituted sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The significance of the Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling was twofold. First, it established that gender stereotyping is actionable as sex discrimination. Second, it established the mixed-motive framework as an evidentiary framework for proving discrimination under a disparate treatment theory even when lawful reasons for the adverse employment action are also present. Hopkins&#x27;s candidacy for partnership had been put on indefinite hold. She eventually resigned and sued the company for occupational sexism, arguing that her lack of promotion came after pressure to walk, talk, dress, and act more &quot;femininely.&quot;

In 1990, a Federal district judge in Washington ordered the firm to make Hopkins a partner. It was the first time in which a court awarded partnership in a professional company as a remedy for sexual or race-based discrimination.

Following the suit, the firm received media attention due to its discriminatory labor practices towards males as well.

===Tax issues===
In 2014, it came to light that PwC had received $55m from Caterpillar Inc. to develop a tax avoidance scheme, according to an investigation of the US Senate, PwC had helped Caterpillar Inc. drastically reduce its taxes for more than a decade. Profits valued at $8bn were shifted from the US to Switzerland, which allegedly made it possible to save more than $2.4bn in US taxes over a decade. In Switzerland profits were taxed at 4%. A PricewaterhouseCoopers managing director who was involved in designing the tax savings plan had written at the time to a PwC partner: &quot;We&#x27;ll all be retired when this ... comes up on audit.&quot;

===American International Group Inc.===
In 2005, &quot;BusinessWeek&quot; reported that PwC was American International Group Inc.&#x27;s auditor through AIG&#x27;s years of &quot;questionable dealings&quot; and accounting improprieties. AIG on 30 March 2005, said that deals with a Barbados-based insurance company, for instance, may have been incorrectly accounted for over the past 14 years, because an AIG-affiliated company may have been secretly covering that insurer&#x27;s losses. &quot;BusinessWeek&quot; said that PwC also appeared to have &quot;dropped the ball&quot; on the deals between AIG and Berkshire Hathaway Inc.&#x27;s General Re Corp. General Re transferred $500 million in anticipated claims and premiums to AIG. &quot;BusinessWeek&quot; asked: &quot;Did the auditor do its job by verifying that AIG was assuming risk on claims beyond the $500 million, thus allowing AIG to account for the deal as insurance? That&#x27;s Accounting 101 in any reinsurance transaction.&quot;

PwC was also criticised by several witnesses during the 2010 Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission investigation into AIG&#x27;s collapse in the financial crisis of 2007–2008, after the insurer was unable to fulfil its collateral obligations to Goldman Sachs. The insurer was expected to cover the difference in value between the credit default swap contracts it had sold to Goldman Sachs, however, the head of the unit at AIG disagreed with the valuation that Goldman presented. According to a memo published by &quot;Business Insider&quot;, witnesses wondered how PwC was signing off on the accounts for both AIG and Goldman Sachs when they were using different valuation methods for the swaps contracts (and therefore booked different values for them in their accounts).

===ChuoAoyama suspension===
 was the Japanese affiliate of assurance service of PwC from April 2000 to 2006. In May 2006, the Financial Services Agency of Japan suspended ChuoAoyama from provision of some statutory auditing services for two months following the collapse of cosmetics company Kanebo, of which three of the partners were found assisting with accounting fraud for hiding deficits of about $1.9 billion over the course of five years. The accountants got suspended prison terms up to 18 months from the Tokyo District Court after the judge deemed them to have played a &quot;passive role&quot; in the crime. The suspension was the first-ever imposed on a major accounting firm in the country. Many of the firm&#x27;s largest clients were forced to find replacement auditors before the suspension began that July.

Shortly after the suspension of ChuoAoyama, PwC acted quickly to stem any possible client attrition as a result of the scandal. It set up the PricewaterhouseCoopers Aarata, and some of ChuoAoyama&#x27;s accountants and most of ChuoAoyama&#x27;s clients moved to the new firm. ChuoAoyama resumed operations on 1 September 2006, under the Misuzu name. However, by this point the two firms combined had 30% fewer clients than did ChuoAoyama prior to its suspension. Misuzu was dissolved in July 2007.

===Tyco settlement===
In July 2007, PwC agreed to pay US$229 million to settle a class-action lawsuit brought by shareholders of Tyco International Ltd. over a multibillion-dollar accounting fraud. The chief executive and chief financial officer of Tyco were found guilty of looting $600 million from the company.

===Indian companies scandals===
In 2007, India&#x27;s accounting standards agency ICAI found partners of PwC guilty of professional negligence in under-providing for nonperforming assets of the now-defunct Global Trust Bank. This led to the RBI banning PwC from auditing any financial company for over a year. PwC was also associated with the accounting scandal at the India-based DSQ Software, which collapsed in 2003.

In January 2009, PwC was criticised, along with the promoters of Satyam, an Indian IT firm listed on the NASDAQ, in a $1.5 billion fraud. PwC wrote a letter to the board of directors of Satyam that its audit may be rendered &quot;inaccurate and unreliable&quot; due to the disclosures made by Satyam&#x27;s (ex) Chairman and subsequently withdrew its audit opinions. PwC&#x27;s US arm &quot;was the reviewer for the U.S. filings for Satyam&quot;. Consequently, lawsuits were filed in the US with PwC as a defendant. Two partners of PricewaterhouseCoopers, Srinivas Talluri and Subramani Gopalakrishnan, were charged by India&#x27;s Central Bureau of Investigation in connection with the Satyam scandal. After the scandal broke out, Subramani Gopalakrishnan retired from the firm after reaching mandatory retirement age, while Talluri remained on suspension from the firm.

Following the Satyam scandal, the Mumbai-based Small Investor Grievances Association (SIGA) requested the Indian stock market regulator SEBI to ban PwC permanently and seize its assets in India alleging more scandals like &quot;Ketan Parekh stock manipulations.&quot;

In 2015, PwC India said they were disappointed with court judgement of the case saying, &quot;As we have said many times, there has never been any evidence presented that either of our former partners S Gopalakrishnan or Srinivas Talluri were involved in or were aware of the management-led fraud at Satyam. We understand that Gopal and Talluri are considering filing an appeal against this verdict.&quot; In 2018, PwC was banned by India&#x27;s securities regulator from providing auditing services to public-listed companies for 2 years, and PwC was fined $2 million in addition to the suspension. In September 2019, this ban was overruled by the securities appellate tribunal stating that there was no evidence of collusion of PwC in the scam. The tribunal also stated that SEBI had no jurisdiction over audit firms and only ICAI could issue such an order.

==== Association with the hiring of a person accused in gold smuggling case ====
PwC, which provides consulting service to the Kerala government&#x27;s Department of Information Technology and its Space Park project, has been criticised for appointing Ms. Swapana Suresh, who is accused in a case of smuggling gold in a diplomatic bag. Following an investigation, the Kerala government decided to terminate the consultancy services of PwC for the proposed Space Park project in Thiruvananthapuram. PwC sub-contracted the resource from a vendor, Vision Technologies, but the government considers that the primary liability is on PwC for recruiting Swapna Suresh. Even before these events, the opening of the PwC office in Kerala secretariat had attracted serious criticism from the opposition party. Following this, PwC issued clarification on their hiring of Ms. Swapna Suresh by stating that she was hired based on a background verification report from past employers as well as a criminal record verification at the time. In February 2022, the state government of Kerala wrote to PwC in order to seek the refund of INR 16 Lacs paid in salary to Swapna Suresh. In April 2022, the company responded that it can&#x27;t repay the amount.

===Yukos prosecutions===
Yukos was a Russian oil and gas company that was the target of politically motivated prosecutions by Russian authorities. The company&#x27;s assets were sold for alleged unpaid taxes and it was declared bankrupt. PwC&#x27;s audits were the foundation for the firm&#x27;s defense in a series of continuing trials against former chief executive, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, and the former majority shareholder, Platon Lebedev. The Russian authorities then went after PwC. In March 2007, police raided PwC&#x27;s Moscow offices, confiscating documents related to Yukos and charging and convicting PwC of failing to pay 243 million rubles, or $9.4 million, in taxes. PwC withdrew its Yukos audits and less than two weeks later authorities cleared PwC of any wrongdoing in regard to its audit.

In 2010, Joe Nocera in the &quot;New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;In 2007, with the prospect of parole on the horizon, the same prosecutors—with what appears to be the complicity of PricewaterhouseCoopers, Yukos&#x27;s longtime accounting firm—indicted the two men (Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev), again, bringing a new round of Kafkaesque charges.&quot;

In 2010, it was revealed that the Russian government placed pressure on PwC to withdraw audits.

A cable from the U.S. embassy in Moscow stated that the trial was politically motivated and that a deposition in a U.S. court by PricewaterhouseCoopers may show that PwC was pressured by the Russian government to withdraw its prior Yukos audits. An embassy source noted that &quot;If the audits were properly withdrawn, this will be a &#x27;black mark&#x27; for the defense; if not, it could help the defense, but would greatly tarnish PWC&#x27;s international reputation.&quot;

===Transneft Russia case===
Upon the completion of the construction of the ESPO (East Siberia-Pacific Ocean) pipeline by Transneft in December 2010, an official report of the Audit Chamber of the Russian Federation suggested that $4 billion was stolen by Transneft insiders. One Federation Council Speaker, Sergei Mironov, called for an investigation. Alexei Navalny, a minority Transneft shareholder and lawyer, accused the company of wrongdoing in his personal blog, and criticized PwC, Transneft&#x27;s auditor, of ignoring his warnings. PwC denied wrongdoing, stating that, &quot;We believe there are absolutely no grounds for such allegations, and we stand behind our work for OAO AK Transneft.&quot;

===Northern Rock===
In 2007, PwC was criticised by the Treasury Select Committee of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for helping Northern Rock, a client of the firm, to sell its mortgage assets while also acting as its auditor. In 2011, a House of Lords inquiry criticized PwC for not drawing attention to the risks in the business model followed by Northern Rock, which was rescued by the UK government during the financial crisis.

===JP Morgan Securities audit===
In 2012, the Accountancy and Actuarial Discipline Board (AADB) of the UK fined PwC a record £1.4m for wrongly reporting to the Financial Services Authority that JP Morgan Securities had complied with client money rules which protects client funds. The accountants neglected to check whether JP Morgan had the correct systems in place and failed to gather sufficient evidence to form opinions on the issue, and as a result, failed to report that JP Morgan failed to hold client money separate from JP Morgan&#x27;s money. The £1.4m fine was at the time the greatest penalty administered to a professional accountancy firm in the UK.

===Water privatisation in Delhi===
PwC was found to be unethically favored by the World Bank in a bid to privatize the water distribution system of Delhi, India, an effort that was alleged as corrupt by investigators. When bidding took place, PwC repeatedly failed in each round, and the World Bank in each case pressured PwC to be pushed to the next round and eventually win the bid. The effort at privatization fell through when an investigation was conducted by Arvind Kejriwal and the non-governmental organization (NGO) Parivartan in 2005. After submitting a Right to Information (RTI) request, Parivartan received 9000 pages of correspondence and consultation with the World Bank, where it was revealed that the privatization of Delhi&#x27;s water supply would provide salaries of $25,000 a month to four administrators of each of the 21 water zones, which amounted to over $25 million per year, increasing the budget by over 60% and water taxes 9 times.

The Delhi Jal Board (DJB), which administers the water system of Delhi, was first approached by Parivartan in November 2004, following a report by the newspaper &quot;The Asian Age&quot;, where the scheme was revealed to the public for the first time. The DJB denied the existence of the project, but after an appeal, the RTI request was granted. The documents revealed that the project began in 1998, in complete secrecy within the DJB administration. The DJB approached the World Bank for a loan to improve the water system, which it approved, and the effort began with a $2.5 million consultation loan. The Delhi government could have easily provided the money, and the interest rate of 12% that was to be loaned by the World Bank could have been raised on capital markets for 6%. Following the consultation, 35 multinational companies bid, of which six were to be shortlisted. When PwC was in 10th place, the World Bank said that at least one company should be from a developing country, and since PwC made the bid from its Kolkata office, it was dubbed an &quot;Indian&quot; company, and its rank was raised to 6th. When PwC failed in the second round, the World Bank pressured the DJB to start over with a fresh round of bidding. Only one company succeeded in the new round that was not PwC, and the World Bank had the lowest marks from an evaluator thrown out. The contract was awarded to PwC in 2001. Following the investigation by Parivartan, a campaign was waged by Kejriwal, Aruna Roy, and other activists across Delhi and the DJB withdrew the loan application to the World Bank.

===Cattles===
In 2013, Cattles plc brought a legal action against PwC in the UK in respect of 2006 and 2007 audits, claiming that PwC had failed to carry out adequate investigations. Cattles, a UK consumer finance company, later discovered control weaknesses which caused its loan book to be materially overstated in its balance sheet; having been listed as a FTSE250 company, it subsequently lost its listing. PwC disputed this legal claim. The claim was settled out of court on undisclosed terms.

The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) issued a fine of £2.3m on PwC and ordered the firm to pay £750,000 costs following their investigation of the 2007 audits of Cattles and its principal trading subsidiary. PwC admitted their &quot;conduct fell significantly short of the standards reasonably to be expected of a member firm&quot; in respect of the 2007 financial statements. The FRC said that PwC had insufficient audit evidence as to the adequacy of loan loss provisions.

===Quinn Insurance===
In 2015, PwC Ireland was sued by the joint administrators of Quinn Insurance Limited (QIL) for €1bn. Having been audited by PwC for the years 2005 to 2008, QIL went into administration in 2010. The administrators alleged that PwC should have identified a material understatement of QIL&#x27;s provisions for claims.

===Connaught plc===
Connaught plc, a UK former FTSE 250 Index outsourcing company operating in property maintenance for the social housing and public sector, was put into administration in 2010 after reporting material losses. In 2017, the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) severely reprimanded PwC and its audit partner following an investigation of their conduct in respect of the 2009 audit of Connaught. PwC was fined a record £5 million plus costs.

===Tesco===
In 2014, Tesco, a UK retailer, announced that it had overstated profits by £263m by misreporting discounts with suppliers. The Financial Reporting Council started an investigation into accounting practices at Tesco and into the conduct of PwC in carrying out its audits in 2012, 2013 and 2014. Two members of Tesco&#x27;s Audit Committee, responsible for monitoring Tesco&#x27;s relationship with its auditors, had themselves previously worked for PwC, including its chairman, Ken Hanna; he later stood down. In 2015 PwC were replaced as auditors of Tesco, ending a 32-year engagement, following a tender process to which they did not participate. In June 2017, the Financial Reporting Council said there was no &quot;realistic prospect&quot; that a tribunal of the UK&#x27;s accountancy watchdog would rule against the auditor PwC concerning its involvement in Tesco&#x27;s 2014 case.&lt;ref name=&quot;Financial Times: Accounting watchdog closes PwC/Tesco probe&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ===
In 2014, The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ was investigated by New York banking regulators over its role in routing payments for Iranian customers through its New York branch in violation of U.S. sanctions. It was found that PwC had altered an investigation report on the issue; PwC itself was fined $25 million in relation to the matter.

===Luxembourg Leaks===
The firm helped multinational companies obtain 548 legal tax rulings in Luxembourg between 2002 and 2010. The rulings provided written assurance that the multinational companies&#x27; tax-saving plans would be seen favorably by the Luxembourg authorities. The companies saved billions of dollars in taxes with these arrangements. Some firms paid less than one percent tax on the profits they shifted to Luxembourg. Employees or former employees of PwC provided documentation of the rulings to journalists. In 2013 and 2014, PwC UK&#x27;s head of tax was called before the UK&#x27;s public accounts committee and was questioned about lying regarding the marketing of these tax avoidance schemes. He told the committee the financing, investments, and tax structure is legal and well known to the British government. &quot;If you want to change the Lux tax regime, the politicians could change the Lux tax regime.&quot; The disclosures attracted international attention and comment about tax avoidance schemes in Luxembourg and other tax havens. The revelations later led to a series of EU-wide measures aimed at regulating tax avoidance schemes and tax probes into several EU companies. In 2016, PwC initiated charges against the two whistleblowers that revealed the LuxLeaks tax controversy, and they were convicted and sentenced with suspended prison sentences and fined. In March 2017, a Luxembourg appeals court upheld the convictions of the two whistleblowers, but with reduced sentences.

===Petrobras Brazil===
In 2015, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation of Microsoft founder Bill Gates sued oil company Petrobras and accounting firm PwC&#x27;s Brazil arm over investment losses due to corruption at the Brazilian oil company. The filings also alleged that PwC&#x27;s Brazil affiliate, PricewaterhouseCoopers Auditores Independentes, played a significant role by attesting to Petrobras financial statements and ignoring warnings.

=== Gay marriage in Australia ===
In 2016, Luke Sayers, then CEO of PwC Australia, had the firm prepare a report projecting the excessive cost of a plebiscite on gay marriage. Mark Allaby, a senior executive at PwC, left the board of the religious lobbying organisation Australian Christian Lobby, a group campaigning against same-sex marriage, following public outrage and pressure from PwC Australia.

=== Centro Properties Group===
In 2007, shopping center giant Centro understated its liabilities by more than $3 billion and almost collapsed when it was unable to refinance its debt during the global financial crisis. PwC was Centro&#x27;s auditor and admitted negligence. In 2012, Centro and PwC paid a $200 million settlement to resolve the shareholder class action, the largest ever in Australia.

===BHS===
In 2016, PwC in the UK was investigated by the Financial Reporting Council over its conduct in relation to the audit of BHS for the year to 30 August 2014. PwC completed their audit of financial statements in which BHS was described as a going concern days before its sale for £1 to a consortium with no retail experience. BHS collapsed the following year with a substantial deficit in its pension fund.

===MF Global malpractice lawsuit===
In 2016, a United States federal judge rejected PwC&#x27;s bid to dismiss a $3 billion lawsuit accusing the accounting firm of professional malpractice for helping cause the October 2011 bankruptcy of MF Global, a brokerage once run by former New Jersey Governor Jon Corzine.

===BT Italy===
BT Group (British Telecom), a client of PwC, reported in 2017, that profits in its Italian subsidiary had been over-stated by £530 million. BT reportedly sought the immediate replacement of PwC as auditors following a breakdown of trust, but had existing commercial relationships with the other Big 4 firms which would have prevented their early appointment. BT subsequently stated that its audit would be put out to tender to identify a replacement for PwC, In June 2017, the Financial Reporting Council began an investigation of PwC&#x27;s audits of BT covering the years 2015 through 2017.

=== Oscars Best Picture announcement error ===
At the 89th Academy Awards in 2017 &quot;La La Land&quot; was incorrectly announced as the winner of Best Picture after PwC partner Brian Cullinan gave presenters Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway the wrong envelope. PwC was responsible for tabulating the results, preparing the envelopes, and handing them to presenters. It was called &quot;as bad a mess-up as you could imagine.&quot; The firm took &quot;full responsibility&quot; for handing the presenters the wrong envelope and apologized for the error, acknowledging that Cullinan and PwC partner Martha Ruiz did not follow protocols for correcting the error quickly. In March 2017, the board of governors for the Academy voted to retain the services of accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, despite the mix-up, saying &quot;new protocols have been established including greater oversight from PwC&#x27;s U.S. chairman Tim Ryan.&quot;

=== PrivatBank ===
PwC Ukraine had its audit license removed by the National Bank of Ukraine in July 2017 for its alleged &quot;verification of misrepresented financial information&quot; leading to a $5.5 billion balance-sheet hole in PrivatBank. The government of Ukraine had had to rescue PrivatBank by nationalisation in 2016 to protect its 20 million customers.

=== Colonial Bank audit ===
In 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alabama held PwC liable for professional negligence in its audit of Colonial Bank, which failed in 2009, after filing materially false financial information with the SEC. In 2018, a federal judge later ordered PwC to pay the FDIC $625 million, the largest-ever judgement against a U.S. audit firm. The FDIC reached a $335 million settlement with PwC in March 2019.

=== Age discrimination lawsuit ===
In 2018, PwC was accused of disproportionately hiring younger workers and fostering &quot;an age-conscious workplace in which youth is highly valued.&quot; Plaintiffs estimated that younger applicants are over 500% more likely to be hired than candidates over age 40. In March 2019, a collective action related to the case was certified by a federal judge in San Francisco.

=== Luke Sayers&#x27; AVP investment review ===
In 2018, PwC Australia CEO Luke Sayers was connected to perceived conflict of interest issues on a related to a personal investment in Australian Visa Processing (AVP), a company part-owned by PwC that was submitting a tender to redesign and run Australia&#x27;s visa processing system that is potentially worth billions of dollars, which would result in a significant financial advantage for its investors. This investment led to a &quot;storm inside the firm&quot;, interjection by PwC Global and a review by PwC Australia of its personal investment policy for partners. The option to invest had not been offered to all partners or even the entire firm. A review was announced around the way partners make personal investments.

=== Improper audit services in US ===
During 2019, PwC&#x27;s US affiliate agreed to pay more than $7.9 million to its US regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) , to settle allegations that it improperly performed IT and other non-audit services for several audit clients.

=== Corruption in Angola ===
In 2020, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) leaked over 700,000 internal documents revealing that PwC had facilitated multiple dealings in which Isabel dos Santos, the daughter of former President of Angola José Eduardo dos Santos, made a fortune while in charge of the state oil company, Sonangol. Dos Santos established a network of over 400 companies to facilitate tax evasion and the steering of millions of dollars of Angolan state contracts to companies under her control. Her husband, Congolese businessman and art collector Sindika Dokolo, made millions from a suspiciously one-sided partnership with the state diamond company, SODIAM, to buy a stake in Swiss luxury jeweler De Grisogono. After ICIJ&#x27;s revelations, PwC indicated it would terminate its relationship with Dos Santos.

=== MBC Group ===

During November 2017, PwC was engaged in due diligence and valuation of the media company, MBC Group, owned by Saudi businessman, Waleed bin Ibrahim Al Ibrahim, who was allegedly held against his wishes at the Ritz-Carlton in Riyadh as part of an attempt to coerce him into selling it to the Saudi Crown Prince.

=== JD Classics ===

In July 2021, PwC was sued by administrators Alvarez and Marsal on behalf of JD Classics, a UK-based car dealership, for negligence related to audits in 2016 and 2017. A failure to identify fraud at the company led to losses of £41m. PwC responded with a statement that &quot;this claim [lacks] merit and [we] will be vigorously defending it.&quot;

=== Lobbying revolving door ===
In 2021, an investigation by the &quot;New York Times&quot; found that PwC staff sought employment at the Treasury Department where they pursued policies that helped PwC clients. After completing their time at the Treasury Department, the staff were promoted to partner at PwC.

===Evergrande===
PwC has audited Evergrande, a Chinese property company, since 2009 and received fees worth $42 million for doing so. By 2021, Evergrande had collapsed financially and set off the Chinese property sector crisis, which sparked questions about PwC&#x27;s role in inflating the company&#x27;s revenue prior to the firm&#x27;s eventual bankruptcy.

In October 2021, the accounting regulator in Hong Kong announced an investigation into PwC&#x27;s audit of Evergrande. PwC had signed off the 2020 accounts of Evergrande without reference to its uncertainties as a going concern. After the announcement of the fraud investigation, PwC resigned as auditor of Evergrande&#x27;s accounts. One year later, in February 2024, Evergrade liquidators prepared for a potential lawsuit against PwC.

In September 2024, PwC ZhongTian, PwC&#x27;s auditing business in China, was suspended for six months. China&#x27;s securities regulator also confiscated the revenue PwC earned from auditing Evergrande and imposed a fine of $62 million.

===South African Airways===
The Zondo Commission report on state capture in South Africa uncovered several instances of alleged corruption, fraud and mismanagement at South African Airways (SAA). The report found that PwC effectively enabled capture of SAA by failing to adequately audit its financial and accounting processes between 2012 and 2016.

=== Kier and Galliford Try ===
In June 2022, the UK&#x27;s Financial Reporting Council fined PwC and a former partner, Jonathan Hook, over audit failures relating to construction firms Galliford Try and Kier Group. PwC was fined just over £3m for failing to adequately challenge revenue and costs recognised by Galliford Try&#x27;s management on large, complex long-term construction contracts during 2018 and 2019 audits, and fined £1.96m for similar failures during the 2017 audit of Kier. Both fines were reduced (from £5m and £3.35m respectively) to reflect PwC&#x27;s cooperation with the investigation.

===Americanas (AMER3) controversy===
In January 2023, the firm was involved in a controversy when it approved Americanas&#x27; (AMER3) balance sheets with accounting inconsistencies of around US$4 billion. This caused volatility to company&#x27;s price on the Brazilian stock exchange and losses to the company&#x27;s shareholders. After verifying the impacts caused, the CVM (Brazilian body that regulates the stock exchanges) opened investigations against the company&#x27;s auditors to determine responsibilities.

=== Australia tax leak scandal ===

In 2023, it was revealed that a PwC partner, who was a member of consultation groups set up by the Australian Treasury to improve tax laws, had been leaking confidential government tax plans to PwC. The data leaked by the PwC partner included new taxation rules to close loopholes which allowed multinational companies to avoid paying tax.

After PwC completed an internal investigation in July 2023, eight partners, including former chief executive Tom Seymour, were removed from the partnership. In July 2023 PwC sold its Australian government consulting business to Allegro Funds for $1 with the business rebranded Scyne Advisory.

===Aiding Russian oligarchs===
PwC&#x27;s Cyprus unit helped dozens of Russian oligarchs to shuffle their wealth and evade sanctions after Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine. PwC helped Alexey Mordashov transfer a $1.4 billion investment out of his name in order to elude EU sanctions. PwC also helped two oligarchs who were instrumental to the waging of Russia&#x27;s war in Ukraine to hide $100 million.

After the start of the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, on March 7, 2022, PwC stated that &quot;under the circumstances, PwC should not have a member firm in Russia and consequently PwC Russia will leave the network.&quot; On April 29, PwC Russia announced the withdrawal of the brand from the PwC network, and on June 30, a legal agreement was signed on the withdrawal of the firm in Russia from the network. A week later, on July 5, 2022, PwC Ukraine announced the final exit of the company from Russia: &quot;PwC no longer has a firm in Russia: on 4 July 2022 all aspects of the departure of the former PwC firm in Russia have been completed&quot;. In addition, PwC member firms outside of Russia have refrained from doing any work for sanctioned Russian entities or individuals. The company said that any sanctions against specific Russian entities or individuals imposed anywhere in the world would be applied everywhere in the world. However in 2023 it emerged that PwC helped Russian oligarchs to avoid sanctions. PwC also stopped working in Belarus, where its staff consisted of 25 people.

=== Curacao fraud ===
PwC helped billionaire Hushang Ansary allegedly defraud a pension fund in Curacao by setting up shell companies that drained the fund.

<text>Rear-Admiral Sir Alexander John Ball, 1st Baronet (, 22 July 1757 – 25 October 1809) was a Royal Navy officer and colonial administrator who served as the Civil Commissioner of Malta. He was born in Ebworth Park in Sheepscombe, Gloucestershire. He was the fourth son of Robert and Mary (Dickinson) Ball and the younger brother of Ingram Ball.

==Early naval experience==
Ball entered the Royal Navy, and on 7 August 1778, was promoted lieutenant. Three years later he began a close association with Sir George Rodney. Ball was promoted commander on 14 April 1782, two days after his chief&#x27;s crowning victory, and took command of . On 20 March 1783 he became captain. With peace restored, Ball was furloughed on half-pay. He then spent a year in France, hoping to learn the language and live economically. Captain Horatio Nelson was at this time by no means favourably impressed by his future friend and comrade, and described Ball as a &quot;great coxcomb&quot;.

In 1790, Ball received a command and from then on he was continuously employed. In May 1798, Ball commanded in the Mediterranean. Once when Nelson&#x27;s had lost her fore- and topmasts, Ball towed Vanguard to Sardinia. Under Nelson&#x27;s command, Ball took part in the Battle of the Nile, and his ship, the &quot;Alexander&quot;, was the second British ship to fire on the French Admiral&#x27;s flagship, &quot;L’Orient&quot;, which later blew up during the battle.

==Alexander Ball and Malta==
Alexander Ball was an important figure in the diplomatic and military events that brought Malta under British rule. Universally loved by the Maltese, Ball visited the islands for the first time on 12 October 1798. Whenever Ball appeared in public, the passers-by in the streets stood uncovered until he had passed; the clamours of the market-place were hushed at his entrance and then exchanged for shouts of joy and welcome. His mission was to sustain and continue the siege and blockade of the French forces in Malta, aided by certain Portuguese naval forces.

The Maltese leaders of the blockade were immediately attracted by Ball&#x27;s charisma and sympathy. Moreover, they might have realised that after the eventual French surrender, their island would have to find another ruler, since no Maltese in the nineteenth-century considered independence. The fear of the return of the increasingly oppressive Order of St. John may have pushed Malta indirectly toward becoming a British protectorate. In a letter sent by one of the Maltese leaders to Ball, written by Vincenzo Borg, the Maltese expressed the wish to Ball that &quot;the vast majority of us wish to see the islands fall under English jurisdiction&quot;.

The destiny of Malta was to be decided by the events occurring in Europe during this period. Napoleon&#x27;s troops succeeded in entering Naples itself, forcing King Ferdinand IV to flee the city with his family. For the Maltese this meant that only Britain could guarantee Malta&#x27;s safety. It was at this stage that problems emerged between the supporters of the Neapolitans and those preferring the Royal Navy. Captain Alexander Ball succeeded in calming the situation, and this led to his eventual election as the President of the National Assembly that took place on 9 February 1799. According to Ball&#x27;s wishes, the Assembly changed its name to National Congress in order to emphasise the need for a compromise. However, the increasingly precarious situation faced by King Ferdinand IV made Ball pass more powers to the British forces stationed in and around Malta. In fact, it was at this time that the Union Flag was flown for the first time alongside the Neapolitan flag.

Nelson wrote to Ball in January 1799:

&quot;...Respecting the situation of Malta with the King of Naples, it is this – he is the legitimate Sovereign of the Island: therefore, I am of opinion his Flag should fly. At the same time, a Neapolitan garrison would betray it to the first man who would bribe him. I am sure the King would have no difficulty in giving his Sovereignty to England; and I have lately, with Sir William Hamilton, got a Note that Malta should never be given to any Power without the consent of England...

&quot;P.S. – In case of the Surrender of Malta, I beg you will not do anything which can hurt the feelings of their Majesties. Unite their Flag with England’s, if it cannot, from the disposition of the Islanders, fly alone.&quot;

The French forces besieged in Valletta faced starvation as the British navy intercepted a French relief force off Lampedusa Island. Eventually, General Vaubois, the commander of the French forces, surrendered to the British forces, represented by Captain George Martin and Major General Henry Pigot. As a representative of the Maltese people, Ball was not allowed to take part in the negotiations, while the Neapolitans were excluded for diplomatic reasons. The French were allowed to leave with full military honours, and after a few days Ball and the Maltese could enter the liberated capital.

In February 1801 Ball was appointed commissioner of the navy at Gibraltar and had to leave Malta. Control passed to Major General Henry Pigot, whose tyrannical administration angered the Maltese, a fact noted in a letter Ball wrote to Nelson in June of the same year. Ball reported that the Maltese would have rebelled against Pigot had Ball not promised them that he would convey their grievances to the authorities.

Nelson himself wrote back to Ball from the Baltic on 4 June 1801: &quot;My dear, invaluable friend... believe me, my heart entertains the very warmest affection for you, and it has been no fault of mine, and not a little mortification, that you have not the red ribbon and other rewards that would have kept you afloat; but as I trust the war is at an end, you must take your flag when it comes to you, for who is to command our fleets in a future war?... I pity the poor Maltese; they have sustained an irreparable loss in your friendly counsel and an able director in their public concerns; you were truly their father, and, I agree with you, they may not like stepfathers... Believe me at all times and places, for ever your sincere, affectionate, and faithful friend.&quot;

The British were uncertain of their policy towards Malta, as with Napoleon on the rise they could not afford problems with their allies. The choice of Charles Cameron as Civil Commissioner in May 1801 did not remove these uncertainties, even though his presence assured the Maltese of the protection of the Empire. When the Treaty of Amiens placed Malta again under the rule of the Knights of St. John, this assurance was dashed.

Ball was made a baronet on 6 June 1801. The British government then sent him back to Malta as the &quot;Plenipotentiary Minister of His British Majesty for the Order of Saint John&quot; to coordinate the departure of the British in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Amiens. The situation, however, changed quickly as the likelihood of war between Napoleonic France and the United Kingdom increased. Ball now received instructions to delay the evacuation of British troops from the island.

Napoleon was anxious for the moment to see the British out of the Grand Harbour, stating that he would prefer to see the British in possession of a Parisian suburb than of Malta. In May 1803 war was rejoined because of the British refusal to evacuate the islands. After the Napoleonic Wars, through the Treaty of Paris of 1814, as ratified by the Congress of Vienna, Malta and all its dependencies passed under the jurisdiction of the British.

Sir Alexander Ball was possibly the British leader most loved by the Maltese population. Samuel Taylor Coleridge became an assistant to Ball in 1804 and later described his administration in &quot;The Friend&quot;, going as far as describing Ball as &quot;a truly great man&quot;. Ball died in the San Anton Palace on 25 October 1809 and was buried in Fort Saint Elmo in Valletta. In 1810, the Maltese built a monument in the Lower Barrakka Gardens dedicated to Ball&#x27;s memory. This neoclassical monument was restored in 1884, and again in 2001.

<text>Yury (Georgy) Danilovich (; 1281 – 21 November 1325) was Prince of Moscow from 1303 to 1325 and Grand Prince of Vladimir from 1318 to 1322. He contested the title of Grand Prince of Vladimir with his uncle Mikhail of Tver. As Yury&#x27;s father had never held the title, he had no legitimate claim. Despite two failed campaigns by Mikhail to subdue Yury, the latter allied with the Golden Horde and married the khan&#x27;s sister Konchaka. However, he never had any children with her and was made grand prince after Mikhail&#x27;s execution in 1318.

Yury faced resistance and difficulties in collecting tribute for the Horde, prompting several punitive expeditions. In 1322, Mikhail&#x27;s son Dmitry of Tver accused him of embezzlement and obtained the grand princely title. Dmitry also succeeded in killing Yury. Before his death, Yury led a campaign against the Swedes and founded a fort at the Neva River.

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
Yury was the oldest son of Daniel of Moscow, the first prince of Moscow and progenitor of the &quot;Daniilovichi&quot;. His first military action was to defend Pereslavl-Zalessky against the grand prince of Vladimir, Andrey of Gorodets. 

=== Conflict with Mikhail of Tver ===
After his father Daniel died in 1303, Yury became prince of Moscow, and contended over the title of grand prince of Vladimir (the supreme position among princes in the northeast) with his uncle Mikhail of Tver. Because Daniel had never been grand prince of Vladimir, his descendants, including his son Yury, had no legitimate claim to the throne of Vladimir according to traditional succession practices. This is why the Golden Horde&#x27;s khan, Tokhta, granted Mikhail of Tver the grand princely title when Andrey of Gorodets died the next year on 27 July 1304. Mikhail went to the Golden Horde&#x27;s capital city Sarai, where the khan elevated him grand prince. His nephew Yury rebelled against this appointment, but two military campaigns by Mikhail of Tver against Moscow in 1305 and 1308 forced Yury to comply with the khan&#x27;s decision. The Tverian army besieged Pereslavl and Moscow itself.

In the meantime, Yury arranged the murder of Prince Konstantin of Ryazan. This unlucky ruler had been captured by Yury&#x27;s father back in 1302 and had been incarcerated in Moscow since then. While Ryazan was shocked by such a barbarity, Yury annexed the key Ryazanian fortress of Kolomna to Moscow. He also captured Mozhaisk, which formerly belonged to the princes of Smolensk. By 1314, Yury secured backing from the Metropolitan Peter and formed a military alliance with Novgorod against Tver. Now, he felt strong enough to challenge Mikhail of Tver in the Horde.

In 1315, Yury went to the Golden Horde and, after spending two years there, constructed an alliance with Uzbeg Khan. Yury married the khan&#x27;s sister Konchaka, a Tatar princess who converted to Russian Orthodox Christianity for her marriage to Yury, and adopted &quot;Agafiia&quot; as her baptismal name. Uzbeg Khan deposed Mikhail and nominated Yury as the Grand Prince of Vladimir. Back in Moscow with a large force of Tatars, Yury approached Tver. However, Yuri&#x27;s army was defeated and his brother Boris and his wife were taken prisoners. Thereupon he fled to Novgorod and sued for peace. At that time his wife, still held in Tver as a hostage, died unexpectedly. Yury availed himself of the confusion that followed and announced to the khan that she had been poisoned on Mikhail&#x27;s order. Uzbeg Khan summoned both princes to Sarai and, after a trial, had Mikhail executed on 22 November 1318. Yury, who both depended on and benefited from Uzbeg Khan&#x27;s favour, was allowed to be the grand prince of Vladimir for the next four years (1318–1322).

=== Last years ===
Yury returned to Suzdalia in 1319, spending much time in Novgorod. He was fiercely resisted by other princes and populace alike, as his appointment to grand prince was considered illegitimate. Now entrusted with the task of gathering tribute to the Horde, Yury faced much opposition; Uzbeg sent no fewer than four punitive expeditions to the northeastern principalities of Rus&#x27; during Yury&#x27;s last two years as grand prince (1320–1322) in order to enforce their joint authority. In particular, Mikhail&#x27;s son and successor, Dmitry &quot;the Terrible Eyes&quot; of Tver, still opposed him. In 1322, Dmitry, seeking revenge for his father&#x27;s murder, went to Sarai and persuaded the khan that Yury had appropriated a large portion of the tribute due to the Horde. Uzbek granded Dmitry the patent for grand prince of Vladimir. Yury was summoned to the Horde for a trial but, before any formal investigation, was killed by Dmitry. Eight months later, Dmitry was also executed in the Horde. In early 1326, Yury&#x27;s remains were returned to Moscow and buried by the bishops of the Russian Orthodox Church headed by Metropolitan Peter.

Shortly before his death, Yury led the army of Novgorod to fight the Swedes and founded a fort in the mouth of the Neva River. Upon signing the Treaty of Orekhovo in 1323, Yury continued eastward and conquered Velikiy Ustyug the same year.

<doc id="148180" wikidata="Q185316" url="?curid=148180" title="Ivan I of Moscow">
<text>Ivan I Danilovich Kalita (, ; – 31 March 1340) was Prince of Moscow from 1325 and Grand Prince of Vladimir from 1331 until his death in 1340.

Ivan inherited the Moscow principality following the death of his elder brother Yury. His rival, Aleksandr of Tver, was forced to flee his own principality in 1327 after Özbeg Khan of the Golden Horde dispatched a punitive force led by Ivan and Aleksandr of Suzdal to suppress an anti-Tatar uprising in Tver. The following year, the khan divided the grand principality between Ivan and Aleksandr of Suzdal. Upon the latter&#x27;s death in 1331, Ivan became the sole grand prince. His heirs would continue to hold the title almost without interruption.

As the grand prince, Ivan was able to collect tribute from other Russian princes, allowing him to use the funds he acquired to develop Moscow. At the start of his reign, the seat of the Russian Orthodox Church was moved to Moscow and Ivan formed an alliance with the metropolitan. This decision would later allow Moscow to become the spiritual center of Russian Orthodoxy. Aleksandr of Tver was executed at the Horde in 1339, marking the end of a 35-year-long struggle between the princes of Moscow and Tver. Ivan died the following year and was succeeded by his son Simeon.

==Early life==
Ivan Danilovich was the fourth son of Daniel of Moscow, the first prince of Moscow and founder of the Moscow branch of the Rurikid dynasty. Daniel was the youngest of the four sons of Alexander Nevsky, who had reigned as the grand prince of Vladimir. The grand prince held the formal role of both the leading prince and symbolic leader of the nation, and, once the Mongol Golden Horde established its dominance, the Mongol khans saw it beneficial to support the grand prince as long as he remained loyal. 

Ivan was named after John the Baptist. The origin of Ivan&#x27;s mother is not known, but a 17th-century liturgical text from Rostov implies that she was called Agrippina. It is not known when exactly Ivan was born, as the birth of Daniel&#x27;s fourth son was seen by chroniclers as insignificant. He may have been born on 1 October—the feast day of Saint Ananias—because he would take monastic vows under the name Ananias. According to the historian , Ivan was likely born around 1288, as Daniel appointed Ivan to represent him in Novgorod in 1296—Ivan&#x27;s grandfather Alexander Nevsky had been sent to Novgorod at the age of eight, while Nevsky himself had sent his son Dmitry to the city when Dmitry was around nine years old. Ivan&#x27;s appointment is the first mention of his political activity in surviving sources. The Novgorodians invited Daniel to reign in their city after the &quot;veche&quot; (popular assembly) had expelled the governors of his older brother Andrey. Ivan was sent to Novgorod to rule on his father&#x27;s behalf. His time in Novgorod was brief, as in 1298, the Novgorodians invited Andrey back.

Daniel died on 5 March 1303 and was succeeded by his eldest son Yury as prince of Moscow. As Daniel died before becoming grand prince, his descendants were excluded from the title under the traditional practice of collateral succession. However, in 1318, Yury was made grand prince by Özbeg Khan. Four years later, he lost the title to Dmitry of Tver when he chose to lead the defense of Novgorod against Sweden instead of delivering the tax receipts directly to the khan.

==Reign==
===Rise to power===
Ivan inherited the Moscow principality after Yury was murdered in 1325 by Dmitry of Tver in revenge for Dmitry&#x27;s own brother Mikhail&#x27;s death. The title of grand prince went to Alexander of Tver. Dmitry was executed on the order of Özbeg Khan the following year. In 1327, Özbeg sent his deputy to Tver to test Alexander&#x27;s loyalty. Russian chronicles say that the deputy intended to make himself ruler and destroy the Christian faith, though whatever his intention was, he mistreated the locals and provoked a revolt. The residents of Tver killed the deputy and his delegation. Upon hearing the news of the massacres of Tatars, Ivan set off to the khan with the expectation that he would be given the patent for the grand princely title. Instead, he was given a Tatar army and ordered to lead a punitive force, along with Alexander of Suzdal, to sack Tver. Alexander of Tver then fled to Pskov and Ivan was unable to bring him back to the khan. In 1328, Özbeg divided the grand principality between Alexander of Suzdal and Ivan. Due to his failure to deliver Alexander of Tver to the khan, Ivan was not made the sole grand prince. Alexander of Suzdal ruled the eastern portion, including Vladimir, and was presumably granted the grand princely title, while Ivan controlled Novgorod and Kostroma.

Ivan&#x27;s next attempt at bringing Alexander of Tver to the khan took place in the summer of 1328. The Pskovites recognized Alexander as their prince and signed an agreement with him promising &quot;not to hand him over to the Russian princes&quot;. At the behest of Ivan, Metropolitan Theognostus excommunicated Alexander and the Pskovites. According to the chronicle of Pskov, Alexander stated: &quot;O my brothers and friends, let not this curse and excommunication be upon you because of me. I shall leave your city, and your oath to me and my oath to you shall no longer be valid&quot;. After extracting a promise from the Pskovites that his wife would be cared for, Alexander left Pskov for Lithuania in 1329. At the end of 1331, Alexander of Suzdal died. Ivan immediately set off to the khan and was made grand prince. According to John L. I. Fennell, the khan&#x27;s change in attitude toward Ivan can be explained by the fact that Ivan had proven himself to be an ideal servant by his &quot;willingness to carry out the khan&#x27;s commands&quot;. The khan continued to reward the princes of Moscow with the title of grand prince, so Ivan&#x27;s heirs retained the title almost without interruption.

Like his father, Ivan began incorporating the patrimonial principalities of other princes into his own domain to continue reversing the trend of territorial fragmentation that had led to the emergence of many new principalities from the Vladimir grand principality. In particular, Ivan was to be credited by his grandson Dmitry Donskoy in his will with purchasing the principalities of Beloozero, Galich and Uglich. Although some scholars do not believe that Ivan actually purchased those principalities, his daughters were arranged to marry the princes of Beloozero, Yaroslavl and Rostov. Some historians, including Nikolay Karamzin, Sergey Solovyov, Vasily Klyuchevsky, Alexander Presnyakov, and others, have suggested alternative theories. These include the ideas that the principalities were bought by Ivan and attached to the grand princely domain, rather than being part of the patrimony of the princes of Moscow, while the princes of those districts retained proprietary rights; that those princes sold their independence on the condition they be allowed to remain; or that Ivan&#x27;s grandson referred to them as his &quot;grandfather&#x27;s purchases&quot; to lend legal justification for acquiring them. Nevertheless, the process of adding territories near Moscow to the domain of the grand prince would be continued by his successors.

Ivan also developed Moscow to attract people and produce the resources need to maintain his position. As grand prince, Ivan collected tribute from not only his own possessions but also from other Russian princes. Özbeg shifted from his previous policy of exploiting rivalries among the princes, allowing Ivan to maintain his dominance, partly due to Ivan&#x27;s cooperation with the khan, but primarily because of the emerging threat from Lithuania in the West. Ivan used his funds to have the Mongols of the Golden Horde release captives so that they could be settled in the Muscovite domain. Ivan also had access to Novgorod&#x27;s wealth; despite resistance from Novgorod, scholars broadly agree that Moscow&#x27;s dominance in Novgorod allowed the princes of Moscow to pay the tribute required by the khan, who then continued to reward them with the title of grand prince.

===Religious affairs===

The new Russian Orthodox metropolitan, Peter, had found himself caught in the rivalry between Tver and Moscow, as Mikhail of Tver made repeated attempts to unseat Peter. Peter allied himself with the prince of Moscow and began looking for a new residence, where he singled out Moscow despite the fact it was &quot;small and had a small population&quot;, according to his biographer Cyprian. He then writes that the city of Moscow &quot;was ruled by the pious Grand-prince Ivan, son of Daniel, grandson of the blessed Alexander [Nevsky], whom the blessed Peter saw resplending in Orthodoxy, merciful to the poor, honouring the holy churches of God and the clergy, loving divine Scriptures, well instructed in the teachings of the books. So the holy hierarch of God [Peter] loved him very much&quot;. In 1325, Peter established his residence in Moscow, at the start of Ivan&#x27;s reign. During Peter&#x27;s tenure in Moscow, Ivan laid the foundation for the Dormition Cathedral on 4 August 1326, which was built using stone. Peter had intended to make Moscow his burial place, and therefore the religious center of the country, and he died there on 20 December 1326. Moscow would become the new spiritual center of Russian Orthodoxy.

Peter was succeeded by Theognostus, who, like his predecessor, pursued policies that supported the rise of the Moscow principality. During the first four years of his tenure, the Dormition Cathedral was completed and an additional four stone churches were constructed. By the end of 1331, Theognostus was able to restore ecclesiastical control over Lithuania and he closed the metropolitan sees of Galicia and Lithuania, thus frustrating the efforts of Gediminas (Gedimin) of Lithuania at territorial expansion. Theognostus also proceeded with the canonization of Peter in 1339, and requested an official document from Patriarch John Calecas to recommend the start of liturgical veneration, which helped to increase Moscow&#x27;s prestige.

According to John L. I. Fennell, it may be questioned whether Theognostus was acting primarily in the interests of the ecumenical patriarch or wholly identified himself with Moscow&#x27;s political aspirations; however, &quot;it cannot be denied that he proved the staunch and effective friend of Ivan of Moscow and a thorn in the flesh of Gedimin of Lithuania&quot;. He also says that Theognostus likely enjoyed at least some support or protection from the khan during Ivan&#x27;s reign. According to John Meyendorff, most Byzantine diplomats and ecclesiastics were distrustful of Lithuania and believed that Moscow&#x27;s policy of appeasing the Mongols better matched Byzantine interests.

===Relations with other princes===
No copies of the treaties with local princes have survived; as a result, there is largely only indirect evidence available to determine the relationship between Ivan and princes of the &quot;Lower lands&quot;, a term found in the chronicles which refers to the principalities that had been distributed among the descendants of Vsevolod III. These include reports of military action by &quot;all the princes of Suzdal&quot; under the orders of Ivan, his right to purchase lands, and Muscovite administration in princely patrimonies and dynastic marriages. According to later genealogical records, the principality of Rostov, which was originally the largest of the territories distributed by Vsevolod III, was split in 1328 into two halves between Fyodor and Konstantin, the sons of Vasily Konstantinovich, after Konstantin married Ivan&#x27;s daughter Maria. Konstantin was seemingly obedient to his father-in-law and became the sole ruler after Fyodor died in 1331. The biographer Sergius of Radonezh also portrays Rostov as something akin to a province of Moscow.

The other princes, including those of Yuryev-Polsky, Starodub, Galich and Dmitrov, ruled quietly and in peace with Ivan and the khan, with the exception of Fyodor Ivanovich of Starodub, who was executed in 1330 by the khan for unknown reasons. The only princes who displayed any signs of opposition to Ivan were Vasily Davidovich of Yaroslavl and Roman Mikhailovich of Beloozero, both princes of districts that had separated from Rostov, who appeared to have been partisans of Alexander of Tver. Ivan concluded dynastic marriages with the two houses, and there is little evidence to suggest that those princes were able or willing to provide any more resistance.

The Ryazan principality was under the influence of Moscow during the first decade of the 14th century; however, almost nothing is known about relations with Ryazan during the next 30 years, except that some kind of compact existed with the princes of Ryazan. Ryazan&#x27;s status was not lowered to semi-dependent as the prince of Ryazan still collected the &quot;vykhod&quot; and brought this to the khan, not to the grand prince. Alexander Presnyakov says that during the reign of Ivan Korotopol, there was &quot;significant and increasing independence of the principality of Ryazan in relation to the Great-Russian grand-princely centre&quot;.

===Relations with Novgorod===
Gediminas, the grand duke of Lithuania, began to actively interfere in the affairs of Moscow as a result of the ecclesiastical policy of the metropolitan. The surviving brothers of the exiled Tverite prince Alexander, Konstantin and Vasily, were loyal servants of Ivan, while the republic of Pskov had retained close links with Lithuania during the 1320s; however, Novgorod had shown sympathy for Moscow and antipathy for Tver throughout most of the early 14th century. Novgorod&#x27;s pro-Moscow orientation during the first 30 years of the century may be explained by the political leanings of the archbishop David () and his successor Moisey (). The archbishop of Novgorod was considered the representative of the people of Novgorod, and his position among Russian clergy was undisputed as the head of the largest diocese and the senior prelate after the metropolitan. Following Moisey&#x27;s retirement in 1330, whether it was of his own free will or not, Novgorod&#x27;s attitude towards Moscow changed for the worse following the election of the archbishop Vasily.

Ivan placed pressure on Novgorod as the sole grand prince, collecting not only regular tribute payments but also special assessments, possibly due to the Golden Horde requiring increased revenue during its wars against the Ilkhanate. According to Fennell, the conflict between Moscow and Novgorod was not due to Novgorod refusing to make payments, as some scholars have suggested, but because Ivan did not tolerate Novgorod&#x27;s change in policy, and he was likely aware of an agreement between the archbishop-elect and Gediminas. The archbishop and his advisers had agreed to hand over districts in the northern border region to Narimantas (Narimunt), son of Gediminas, and they had virtually agreed to a defensive alliance. As a result, Ivan entered Torzhok on 6 January 1333 with an army made up of troops from Ryazan and detachments sent by &quot;all the princes of the Lower lands&quot;. After he removed his governors from Novgorod, he proceeded to &quot;ravage the district of Novgorod... until the first Sunday in Lent&quot;.
As the agreement had not yet been implemented and Novgorod was left without any military protection, two embassies were sent to Ivan to request a temporary peace and for him to withdraw his troops. The first was led by Lavrenty, the archimandrite of the Yuryev Monastery, and the second was led by Vasily, who offered him 500 rubles. Ivan refused, leading to Vasily to seek support from Lithuania. Vasily arrived in Pskov, where he was received &quot;with great honour&quot;, and he christened the son of Alexander of Tver, despite his excommunication by the metropolitan. In October 1333, Narimantas arrived in Novgorod, where he was received &quot;with honour&quot; and given the districts in the northern border region. He also signed a treaty, pledging complete support to Novgorod. Although Novgorod did not become an integral part of the Lithuanian grand duke&#x27;s domains, it paved the way for a pro-Lithuanian faction in Novgorod&#x27;s boyar and merchant classes.

The first steps at reconciliation between Moscow and Novgorod were taken by the metropolitan in 1334, who had summoned Vasily to his seat in Vladimir, leading to a Novgorodian delegation to be sent to Ivan and for an agreement to be reached: &quot;Grand Prince Ivan bestowed his favour upon his patrimony Novgorod the Great [and] forgave them their hostility&quot;. Ivan entered Novgorod in February 1335 and was recognized as their prince again. The former archbishop Moisey also returned in 1335 and was allowed to lay the foundation stones of two new churches. Ivan&#x27;s first recorded act was to organize an attack on Pskov with &quot;the Novgorodians and all the Lower land&quot; in an attempt to force out Alexander of Tver from his stronghold; however, Ivan was forced to cancel his plans after the Novgorodians refused to join him in his campaign. The Lithuanians also responded to Novgorod breaking the treaty between them by launching a raid on the district of Torzhok in the summer of 1335. Ivan retaliated by burning the towns of Osechen and Ryasna &quot;and many other fortresses as well&quot;; however, there is no mention in sources of any Novgorodian participation, suggesting that Novgorod intended to maintain neutrality. Upon Ivan&#x27;s return to Moscow, the archbishop, &quot;posadnik&quot; and &quot;tysyatsky&quot; went to Moscow after he had requested a Novgorodian delegation visit him, but the chronicler does not mention that any agreement was reached.

Despite mutual hostility between the factions in Novgorod, Ivan&#x27;s governors were able to maintain peace throughout the following year; however, another popular uprising emerged at the start of 1337 and was directed against the pro-Moscow archimandrite of the Yuryev monastery. According to the official account, &quot;the common people (&quot;prostaya chad″&quot;) rose up against Archimandrite Esif; and they held a &quot;veche&quot; and locked up Esif in the church of St. Nicholas; and the disturbers of the peace (&quot;koromolnitsi&quot;) sat around the church for a night and a day watching over him&quot;. Ivan and his governors perceived the uprising as a hostile act and launched a failed expedition to the Northern Dvina, a possession of Novgorod. According to Fennell, &quot;the primary cause of action, whether this action was dictated by Uzbeg or was spontaneous, must surely be sought in Novgorod&#x27;s intractability, in the strength of her pro-Lithuanian faction–amply demonstrated by the disturbances of 1335 and early 1337–and her refusal to co-operate against Aleksandr of Tver&#x27;&quot;. The pro-Moscow archimandrite was replaced with Lavrenty, which was an indication of the strength of the pro-Lithuanian faction in the city.

The Novgorodians eventually sought reconciliation with Moscow as Gediminas chose to not get involved in Novgorod&#x27;s affairs, despite Swedish attacks in the north and Novgorod&#x27;s request for assistance. According to Fennell, &quot;we can only assume that... Narimunt had been helping his uncle Voin to defend Lithuania&#x27;s easternmost dependent principality, Polotsk. As well as conducting a war with the Germans, the Lithuanians were also obliged to defend themselves against the Tatars in 1338&quot;. In 1339, Ivan sent his youngest son, Andrey, to Novgorod as a symbolic expression of his continued authority. Motivated by either greed or simply acting on the khan&#x27;s orders, Ivan demanded another payment from the Novgorodians after accepting the tribute brought by Novgorod&#x27;s ambassadors, which was refused by Novgorod. At the end of 1339 or the start of 1340, Ivan removed his governors from Novgorod one last time; however, he died before he could take his next steps to apply pressure on Novgorod. As a result, the influence of the pro-Lithuanian faction was not diminished and Ivan was unable to provide an attractive alternative to Lithuanian protection.

===Final victory over Tver===
Alexander of Tver returned to Pskov in 1331 or 1332 with the end goal of recovering his principality as well as possibly the grand principality. In 1334 or early 1335, Alexander sent his son Fyodor to the Horde, who returned to Tver rather than Pskov in 1335 with a Tatar official, staying there for at least a year. Alexander visited Tver in the winter of 1336, and the chronicles simply state that he brought his son back to Pskov; however, historians have suggested that he may have gone to Tver to make peace with his brother Konstantin, who had been ruling Tver under the watch of Ivan, his wife&#x27;s uncle, or &quot;to find out the attitude of the local boyars, servants and townsfolk towards him&quot;. In the same year, Ivan had made a trip to the Horde, which was likely to bring back instructions to Alexander.
Alexander was convinced that it would be safe for him to make a trip to the Horde, after being persuaded by Ivan and assured by the Tatar official, and he was prepared to discuss his reinstatement as prince. Alexander made contact with Theognostus and sent his boyars to the metropolitan &quot;for the sake of his blessing and his prayers&quot;, according to the Tverite chronicler, although it is likely that Alexander sought protection from the church. Although the archbishop of Novgorod had warned Alexander to not visit Sarai during his visit to Pskov, Alexander &quot;refused judgement&quot; and the archbishop left the city &quot;having anathematized Pskov&quot;, as the Novgorodian chronicler writes.

During his visit to Sarai, Alexander was granted a full pardon and the right to return to Tver. Some historians have explained Alexander&#x27;s reinstatement as an attempt to set up Tver against Moscow again, such as Lev Cherepnin, who stated that &quot;the Horde was scared by the swift rise of the principality of Moscow&quot; and that the khan may have been displeased with the methods that Ivan used to collect tribute. However, Fennell says that &quot;the situation closely resembled that of 1326&quot;, in which Alexander &quot;was permitted to return to Tver&#x27; in order that he might discredit himself in the eyes of the Tverites–and indeed of any other Russians who might witness his predicament–and thus ultimately bring about his own destruction&quot;. According to Fennell, an immediate execution of Alexander would have antagonized Novgorod, Pskov and Lithuania, as well as possibly any sympathizers among the princes subordinate to Ivan. Fennell also says that Alexander was a danger in the eyes of Ivan and Özbeg &quot;because of his Lithuanian connections and because he represented an extension of Gedimin&#x27;s power eastward and the encroachment of Lithuanian influence on to Russian soil&quot;.

Alexander returned to Tver in the autumn of 1338, in which the chronicles simply state that he was given permission to resume his activities as prince and that he had called for his spouse and children from Pskov. The &quot;Rogozhsky Chronicle&quot; says: &quot;It was in autumn and the population (&quot;khristianom&quot;) suffered greatly. And many boyars departed to Grand Prince Ivan in Moscow&quot;. Alexander had sent his son Fyodor to Sarai as an envoy, and at the same time, Ivan went to the khan. As a result of accusations made by &quot;lawless people&quot; inspired by &quot;that all-cunning wicked counsellor the devil&quot;, according to the Tverite chronicle, Özbeg sent an ambassador to Tver (&quot;not with fury but with calm&quot;), who informed Alexander that Özbeg would allow him to bring back his son. Alexander arrived at the Horde at the end of September, and both he and his son were executed on 28 October 1339. The Tverite chronicle does not implicate Ivan in the murder and removes all guilt from Özbeg, while the &quot;Novgorod First Chronicle&quot; equally blames Ivan and Özbeg. The &quot;Trinity Chronicle&quot; records the execution as if there was no need to seek justification, and exonerates Ivan.

The execution of Alexander marked the end of a 35-year-long struggle between Moscow and Tver for supremacy and the start of the fragmentation of Tver into lesser districts (&quot;udely&quot;). Konstantin continued to rule Tver and Ivan transferred the bell from the Transfiguration Cathedral in Tver to Moscow. According to Fennell, &quot;If Uzbek had not succeeded in bringing back Pskov into the orbit of the grand prince of Vladimir, he had at least removed from the political scene the most powerful ally of Gedimin in north-east Russia&quot;.

==Death==

The two variants of Ivan&#x27;s testament were probably written in 1339, and the vast majority of his holdings were passed to his three sons, with each son receiving a third of the city of Moscow. His first son, Simeon, received Mozhaysk and Kolomna; in total, he received 27 cities, volosts and settlements. His second son, Ivan, received Zvenigorod, Ruza, and a number of villages, for a total of 23 holdings. His third son, Andrey, received Serpukhov, Lopasnya &quot;volost&quot;, and the Shchitov and Peremyshl burgs, for a total of 21 holdings. Lesser holdings were given to his wife and the &quot;younger children&quot;, which included nine volosts, 17 villages, two svobodkas (free settlements), and one settlement (&quot;ramenye&quot;).

Ivan also had to contend with three rivals for the title of grand prince based on traditional succession practices, which included two princes of Tver and one prince of Suzdal, as the eliminating process had taken place almost a century prior and the &quot;yarlyk&quot; was confined the descendants of Yaroslav Vsevolodovich, excluding the heirs of his brothers Konstantin of Rostov and Sviatoslav of Yuryev. As a result, Ivan refrained from stressing the political seniority of his son Simeon in his will. Instead, Simeon is instructed to look after his family: &quot;I entrust to you, my son Semen, your younger brothers and my princess. You will care for them in God&#x27;s name&quot;. The vagueness of Ivan&#x27;s will can be explained by what Lev Cherepnin calls his &quot;desire to ensure the grand-princely dignity for his descendants&quot;. In 1339, Ivan went to Sarai along with his sons and brought a copy of his will with him, which was approved by the khan.

Ivan died in Moscow on 31 March 1340. He was buried on 1 April at the Church of the Archangel. Ivan had built the church and was also the first person to be buried there. His tomb became an object of veneration, and Ivan even acquired an aura of sanctity in the eyes of future generations.

==Legacy==
Ivan received his sobriquet, &quot;Kalita&quot; (), because of his generosity and compassion for the poor, according to some sources. The abbot Paphnutius of Borovsk () told his disciples that Ivan received his sobriquet &quot;for he was very merciful and carried a &quot;kalita&quot; on his belt, always filled with silver coins, and wherever he went, he gave to the poor as much as could be taken out&quot;. Another view supported by Vasily Klyuchevsky says that the sobriquet was given ironically and reflected his stinginess.

The &quot;Trinity Chronicle&quot;, written in the early 15th-century, borrows the characterization of Ivan that was promoted in his own court and hails his policy of appeasing the Mongols:


The first modern Russian historian, Nikolay Karamzin, gives Ivan the title of &quot;gatherer of the Russian lands&quot; in his &quot;Memoir on Ancient and Modern Russia&quot;, adding that he was &quot;cunning&quot;. Karamzin also says: &quot;A small town, scarcely known before the fourteenth century, long called from contempt for its insignificance &#x27;village Kuchkovo&#x27; raised its head and saved the fatherland&quot;. Sergey Solovyov in contrast is reserved about his characterization of Ivan, only repeating Karamzin&#x27;s title and noting that he &quot;rid the Russian land of thieves&quot;. Soviet-era historians are more critical of Ivan, following the writings of Karl Marx where he is described as the &quot;Tartar&#x27;s hangman, sycophant, and slave-in-chief&quot;.

According to Vasily Klyuchevsky, after the prince of Moscow received the title of grand prince, a &quot;princely union&quot; was formed around Moscow, which during the reign of Ivan was &quot;financial and bonded&quot;. After the transfer of the metropolitan see, Moscow became an ecclesiastical capital before it became a political capital, and as a result, &quot;the rich material resources at the disposal of the Russian Church began to flock to Moscow, helping to enrich it&quot;. Klyuchevsky also notes the attitude of the population: &quot;Finally, in the Moscow prince, Northern Russia is accustomed to seeing the eldest son of the Russian Church, the closest friend and collaborator of the main Russian hierarch, to consider Moscow a city on which the special blessing of the greatest saint of the Russian land rests...&quot;. Klyuchevsky also characterizes Ivan as a &quot;miserly prince&quot; and says that all the princes of Moscow starting from Ivan were cunning pragmatists who &quot;diligently tended to the khan and made him an instrument for their plans&quot;.

Robert O. Crummey says that the greatest of Ivan&#x27;s victories was the metropolitan moving his residence to Moscow. He says: &quot;From that time on, Moscow was the residence of the head of the Russian Orthodox hierarchy and its princes played the role of primary protectors of the church... Moscow became a pilgrimage centre and even Peter&#x27;s patron, the unscrupulous Ivan I, acquired an aura of sanctity in the eyes of later generations&quot;. Crummey also says that church leaders had struggled to preserve the unity of the Orthodox hierarchy as the rulers of Lithuania had made repeated attempts to set up a separate metropolis, and as a result, the metropolitan typically backed Moscow&#x27;s claims to unify their flock due to the belief that appeasing the khan coincided much better with the interests of the church.

According to Christoph Baumer, &quot;Özbeg took a fateful decision when he abandoned the former policy of divide and rule by making the new grand prince responsible for collecting and passing on the tribute and taxes from all the Russian cities. Ivan delivered these exactions punctually, so further strengthening his position of privilege. In this way he laid the foundations for Moscow&#x27;s future as a regional great power that in the 1380s would challenge the Golden Horde itself&quot;.

Hélène Carrère d&#x27;Encausse says that thanks to the Mongols, Ivan Kalita received the title of grand prince, &quot;and with it the right to collect tribute from the Russian principalities and administer judgment among the princes. The dream of the founder of Moscow was becoming a reality: his principality was turning into the political center of the country, moreover, the center of gravity of the conquered Russian lands&quot;.

==Family==
Ivan Kalita was married twice. His first wife was called , and nothing is known exactly about her origin. There is a hypothesis that she was the daughter of , the prince of Smolensk. Elena died on 1 March 1331.

A year later, Ivan married again, although all that is known about his second wife is that her name was Ulyana. Vladimir Kuchkin suggests they had two daughters: Maria and Theodosia. They appear in Ivan&#x27;s will as the &quot;young children&quot;. One of them was alive in 1359; nothing more is known about the other.

He had eight children:
*Simeon Ivanovich (7 September 1316 – 27 April 1353), grand prince of Vladimir and Moscow from 1340 to 1353;
*Daniel Ivanovich (11 December 1319 – 1328);
*Fefinia Ivanovna (died in infancy);
*Maria Ivanovna (died 2 June 1365), married to Konstantin of Rostov;
*Ivan Ivanovich (30 March 1326 – 13 November 1359), grand prince of Vladimir and Moscow;
*Andrey Ivanovich (4 August 1327 – 6 June 1353), prince of Novgorod;
** Vladimir Andreyevich (died 1410)
*Evdokia Ivanovna (1314 – 1342), married to Vasily of Yaroslavl;
*Feodosia Ivanovna (died 1389), married to Fyodor of Beloozero.

<text>Ivan V Alekseyevich (; – ) was Tsar of all Russia between 1682 and 1696, jointly ruling with his younger half-brother Peter I. Ivan was the youngest son of Alexis I of Russia by his first wife, Maria Miloslavskaya, while Peter was the only son of Alexis by his second wife, Natalya Naryshkina. Ivan&#x27;s reign was solely titular because he had serious physical and mental challenges.

==Early life and accession==
Ivan V was born in 1666 in Moscow, the youngest son of Tsar Alexis and Maria Miloslavskaya. Only two of his older brothers survived childhood; his eldest brother, Alexei, died aged 15 in 1670, therefore his second brother, Feodor, became tsar upon the death of their father. When Feodor died in 1682 without issue, the court was faced with a crisis of succession, because Ivan, the next-oldest brother, was thought to be &quot;infirm in body and mind.&quot; It was proposed that he be passed over in favor of his younger half-brother, Peter, who was only 10 years old at this time, but was healthy in mind and body, and could be expected to provide adequate leadership in adulthood.

The church and the Naryshkins (family of Peter&#x27;s mother, Natalya Naryshkina) supported Peter&#x27;s proposed ascension to the throne. However, the family of Ivan V&#x27;s mother (the Miloslavski) and Ivan&#x27;s older sister, Sofia Alekseyevna, in particular, disputed the move. Rumors spread around Moscow that Feodor III had been poisoned and Ivan strangled by boyars so that the 10-year-old Peter could become Tsar. These rumours fomented the Moscow Uprising of 1682, and the &quot;streltsy&quot; stormed the Kremlin. These disturbances subsided only after Ivan appeared in person in the city, and proved to everyone that he was alive and well.

The &quot;streltsy&quot; demanded that Ivan be named tsar, and a compromise was found by declaring Ivan and Peter as co-rulers, with a regency government until the boys came of age. Sofia Alekseyevna, who had been influential at court during her brother Feodor&#x27;s reign, was named regent.
==Tsar and co-ruler==
On 25 June 1682, less than two months after the death of Feodor III, Ivan and Peter were crowned in the Cathedral of the Dormition as co-Tsars. A special throne with two seats was commissioned for the occasion (now on display in the Kremlin Armoury). While Ivan was 16 years old at this time, his co-ruler Peter I was only 10. Ivan was considered the &quot;senior tsar&quot;, but actual power was wielded by Sophia Alekseyevna, Ivan&#x27;s full sister and Peter&#x27;s half-sister, for the next seven years.
Sophia was always considerate of Ivan, although she is never known to have consulted him on any important matter. She was anxious that every outward sign of respect and deference be paid to Ivan, which was a subtle way of undermining the influence of Peter&#x27;s faction in court. Thus, every wish or opinion expressed by Ivan was deferred to, and his general prestige in court remained intact during the years of Sophia&#x27;s regency. As Peter grew up, he and his faction, led by his mother&#x27;s Naryshkin family, contended with Regent Sophia for influence and power. Indeed, Sophia is blamed (perhaps unfairly, as a tactic of defamation) for the murders of Peter&#x27;s uncles on his mother&#x27;s side of the family. Due to this and other factors, tension arose between the factions of the two co-tsars.

Ivan being both incapable and uninterested, Peter came into his own and functioned as though he were the sole tsar. The eventual result was that, over time, the outward signs of deference and power which Ivan had enjoyed during the regency slowly withered away, and he became a non-entity in the Russian court. For the last decade of his life, Ivan was completely overshadowed by the more energetic Peter I. He spent his days with his wife, Praskovia Saltykova, caring about little but &quot;fasting and praying, day and night&quot;.

==Marriage and issue==

In late 1683 or early 1684, Ivan married Praskovia Saltykova, daughter of Fyodor Petrovich Saltykov, a minor nobleman, by his wife, whose name is uncertain – it was either Yekaterina Fyodorovna or Anna Mikhailovna Tatishcheva. Ivan&#x27;s marriage was arranged in the traditional style of Russian rulers: he selected a bride from a parade of potential candidates. 

Praskovia Saltykova, who came from a rather obscure Russian noble family, had been raised in a middle-class household and adhered to conventional values and moral standards. She bonded strongly with her gentle and simple-minded husband and became the mainstay of his life. She proved to be an exemplary wife to a mentally challenged man. Her moral character, simple lifestyle, charity, piety and non-involvement in politics were admired by all. She earned the lifelong respect of her powerful brother-in-law, Peter the Great, who entrusted the care and education of his own two daughters to her, imploring her to bring them up to be just like herself.

Ivan&#x27;s purported debility did not prevent him from producing robust offspring, and Praskovia bore him five daughters, three of whom lived to adulthood. Their children were:

* Maria Ivanovna (1689–1692), died in infancy
* Feodosia Ivanovna (1690–1691), died in infancy
* Ekaterina Ivanovna (1691–1733), grandmother of the unfortunate Ivan VI of Russia
* Anna Ivanovna (1693–1740), ruled as Empress of Russia; no issue
* Praskovia Ivanovna (1694–1731), had issue one son who died in infancy

==Death and succession==
At the age of 27, Ivan was described by foreign ambassadors as senile, paralytic and almost blind. He died two years later, on 8 February 1696, and was interred in the Archangel Cathedral. It was fortuitous to Peter&#x27;s faction that Ivan produced several daughters but no sons, as there was no confusion regarding the succession of the crown upon his death. His co-ruler was left to become supreme ruler of Russia; with Ivan&#x27;s death, the struggle for power within the family had finally ended.

In 1730, more than 30 years after Ivan&#x27;s death, his second surviving daughter, Anna, Duchess of Courland, was invited to the throne of Russia by the country&#x27;s privy council. She ruled for more than 10 years, and was succeeded by Ivan&#x27;s infant great-grandson Ivan VI; however, a palace coup engineered in 1741 by Ivan&#x27;s niece Elizabeth resulted in the throne passing finally to the progeny of Peter the Great.

<text>Simeon Ivanovich (; 7 September 1317 – 27 April 1353), also known as Semyon Ivanovich (), nicknamed the Proud (), was Prince of Moscow and Grand Prince of Vladimir from 1340 to 1353.

The son of Ivan I, Simeon continued his father&#x27;s policies to increase the power and prestige of his state. Simeon&#x27;s rule was marked by regular military and political standoffs against the Novgorod Republic and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. His relationships with neighboring Russian principalities remained peaceful if not passive: Simeon stayed aside from conflicts between subordinate princes. He had recourse to war only when war was unavoidable. His reign marked a relatively quiet period for Moscow ended by the Black Death that claimed the lives of Simeon and his sons in 1353.

==Biography==
In 1340 Simeon, the eldest son of Ivan Kalita, was stationed in Nizhny Novgorod. Upon receiving news of his father&#x27;s death, Simeon and his brothers Andrey and Ivan left for the Golden Horde to seek Uzbeg Khan&#x27;s patent (&quot;yarlyk&quot;) for taking over the title of Grand Prince. Rivals Konstantin of Tver and Konstantin of Suzdal also paid their homage to the Khan, claiming seniority over Moscow princes. Simeon won the patent through bribing the Khan&#x27;s retinue; princes of Tver and Suzdal had to agree to his seniority; Uzbeq also extended his benevolence to Simeon&#x27;s issue. He was also granted the ceremonial title () by the Byzantine Empire, which can be loosely translated as seneschal or stolnik.

Also in 1340, Simeon engaged in his first military standoff with Veliky Novgorod. Simeon claimed his right to collect taxes in the Novgorodian town of Torzhok. Torzhok boyars locked up Simeon&#x27;s tax collectors and called for help from Novgorod. Simeon and metropolitan Theognostus hastily organized a coalition of princes against Novgorod, claiming that &quot;They [Novgorodians] make war and peace with whomever they please, consulting no one. Novgorod regards not all Russia, and will not obey her Grand Prince&quot;, referring to Novgorod incursions into Ustyuzhna and Beloe Ozero. As the coalition forces approached Novgorodian lands, the people of Torzhok revolted against the boyars and sided with Muscovite troops. Novgorod Republic accepted the fact and ceded all taxes from Torzhok area, estimated at 1,000 roubles in silver annually, to Simeon who agreed to honor the existing civic charter.

In 1341, shortly after the dismissal of the Muscovite coalition army, Algirdas (then prince of Vitebsk, allied with prince of Smolensk) besieged Mozhaysk. News of the death of Gediminas forced Algirdas to quit the campaign before Simeon could arrange a military response. Uzbeg Khan, Simeon&#x27;s sovereign, died soon afterwards; his successor, Jani Beg, secured the control of the Horde through killing his brothers. Simeon and Theognostus had to travel to the Horde again. Jani Beg reassured Simeon in his rights and let him go, but kept Theognostus hostage to extort money from the church; eventually, Theognostus was released for 600 roubles.

In 1333, Simeon married Aigusta (Anastasia), sister of Algirdas. After her death in 1345, Simeon married Eupraxia of Smolensk, but soon sent her back to her family, claiming that Eupraxia was cursed since wedding and &quot;appears to be dead each night&quot;. Eupraxia remarried Prince Fominsky, and Simeon married Maria of Tver; their four sons died in infancy.

Throughout the 1340s Lithuanian and Swedish military campaigns and internal political disarray decreased the influence of the Novgorod Republic. Simeon, whose title of Grand Prince obliged him to protect Novgorod, was reluctant to do so, as if expecting the weakened republic to collapse for his own benefit. In 1347, when Novgorodians called for help against the Swedes, Simeon dispatched his brother Ivan and Constantine of Rostov; the envoys refused to fight for the Novgorodians. Simeon himself was busy with offsetting the Lithuanians&#x27; influence in the Horde, meanwhile harboring two renegade Lithuanian princes as potential claimants to the Lithuanian crown. He manipulated Jani Beg into believing that increasing Lithuanian influence had become the most important threat to the Horde. Jani Beg eventually concurred with Simeon&#x27;s envoys (of Mongolian ethnicity) and extradited Lithuanian envoys to Simeon&#x27;s mercy. Simeon preferred to sign a truce with Algirdas, releasing the prisoners and securing marriages between Lithuanian princes and Russian brides. The marriage of pagan Algirdas to Orthodox Uliana of Tver, unlawful from the viewpoint of the church, was nevertheless approved by Theognostus; it gave birth to Jogaila.

In 1351–1352 Simeon raised arms against Algirdas over control of small towns in Smolensk area. This conflict, again, did not develop into an open war as Algirdas preferred negotiations to fighting. Although the first round of talks was broken by Lithuanians, Simeon secured the disputed towns for Moscow. This campaign was his last act of Simeon&#x27;s life.

The Black Death was recorded in present-day southern Russia and Ukraine as early as 1346. It hit Scandinavia in 1349, Pskov in the beginning of 1352 and Novgorod in August 1352; by the end of the year two thirds of Pskov were reported dead. The same pattern repeated in Lithuania and north-eastern Russia. In 1353 plague arrived in Moscow, killing Theognostus, Simeon, his two sons, Simeon Simeonovich, Ivan Simeonovich and his brother Andrey who survived Simeon by six weeks.

Before his death in 1353, Simeon took monastic vows and took the name of Sozont. He installed Alexis as Metropolitan of Moscow, successor to the late Theognostus, and secured a profitable estate for Maria. Simeon’s will is considered to be the first usage of paper in Russia, as parchment was used previously.

Simeon is buried in the Archangel Cathedral of the Moscow Kremlin.

<doc id="148184" wikidata="Q210162" url="?curid=148184" title="Ivan II of Moscow">
<text>Ivan II Ivanovich the Fair (; 30 March 1326 – 13 November 1359) was Prince of Moscow and Grand Prince of Vladimir from 1353 to 1359. Until that date, he had ruled the towns of Ruza and Zvenigorod. He was the second son of Ivan Kalita, and succeeded his brother Simeon the Proud, who died of the Black Death.

==Reign==
Upon succeeding his brother and because of increased civil strife among the Golden Horde, Ivan briefly toyed with the idea of abandoning traditional Moscow allegiance to the Mongols and allying himself with Lithuania, a growing power in the west. This policy was quickly abandoned and Ivan asserted his allegiance to the Golden Horde.

Contemporaries described Ivan as a pacific, apathetic ruler, who didn&#x27;t flinch even when Algirdas of Lithuania captured his father-in-law&#x27;s capital, Bryansk. He also allowed Oleg of Riazan to burn villages on his territory. However, Orthodox churchmen aided in consolidating the power of the Prince of Moscow. He received much aid from the capable Metropolitan Alexius. Like his brother, Ivan II was not as successful as his father or grandfather with regard to territorial expansion. Nevertheless, he was able to annex areas southwest of Moscow, including the areas of Borovsk, and Vereya.

He is buried in the Cathedral of the Archangel Michael in Moscow.

<text>Dmitry Ivanovich Donskoy (; 12 October 1350 – 19 May 1389) was Prince of Moscow from 1359 and Grand Prince of Vladimir from 1363 until his death. He was the heir of Ivan II.

He was the first prince of Moscow to openly challenge Mongol authority in Russia. In traditional Russian historiography, he is regarded as a Russian national hero and a central figure of the Russian Middle Ages. His nickname, Donskoy (&quot;of the Don&quot;), alludes to his great victory against the Tatars in the Battle of Kulikovo (1380), which took place on the Don River. He is venerated as a saint in the Orthodox Church with his feast day on 19 May.

==Early reign==

Dmitry was born in Moscow in 1350, the son of Ivan the Fair, Grand Prince of Moscow, and his second wife, Alexandra Vassilievna Velyaminova, the daughter of the mayor of Moscow. Dmitry was orphaned at the age of nine and ascended the throne of the Principality of Moscow. Per the terms of Ivan&#x27;s will, during Dmitry&#x27;s minority, Metropolitan Aleksey served as regent.

In 1360 Khiḍr Khan, Khan of the Golden Horde, transferred the title most prized among the Russian princes, that of Grand Prince of Vladimir, to Dmitry Konstantinovich of Nizhny Novgorod. In 1363, after that prince was deposed, Dmitry Ivanovich was crowned at Vladimir. Three years later, he made peace with Dmitry Konstantinovich and married his daughter Eudoxia.

The most important event during Dmitry&#x27;s early reign was to start building the Moscow Kremlin; it was completed in 1367. Thanks to the new fortress, the city withstood two sieges by Algirdas of Lithuania during the Lithuanian–Muscovite War (1368–1372). The war ended with the Treaty of Lyubutsk. In 1375, Dmitry settled, in his own favor, a conflict with Mikhail II of Tver over Vladimir. Other princes of in the northeastern Rus&#x27; principalities acknowledged his authority and contributed troops to the impending struggle against the Horde. By the end of his reign, Dmitry had more than doubled the territory of the Principality of Moscow.

==Struggle against Mamai==
Mongol domination of Rus&#x27; began to crumble during Dmitry&#x27;s thirty-year reign. The Golden Horde was severely weakened by civil war and dynastic rivalries. Dmitry took advantage of this lapse in Mongol authority to openly challenge the Tatars. While he kept the Khan&#x27;s patent to collect taxes for all of Russia, Dmitry is also famous for leading the first Russian military victory over the Mongols. Mamai, a Mongol general and claimant to the throne, tried to punish Dmitry for attempting to increase his power. In 1378 Mamai sent a Mongol army, but it was defeated by Dmitry&#x27;s forces in the Battle of Vozha River.

Two years later Mamai personally led a large force against Moscow. Sergius of Radonezh blessed Dmitry Donskoy when he went to fight the Tatars in the signal Battle of Kulikovo field, but only after he was certain Dmitry had pursued all peaceful means of resolving the conflict. Sergius sent the two warrior monks Alexander Peresvet and his friend Rodion Oslyabya to join the Russian troops. The battle of Kulikovo was opened by single combat between two champions. The Russian champion was Alexander Peresvet. The Horde champion was Temir-murza. The champions killed each other in the first run. Dmitry defeated the Horde. In gratitude for the victory, Dmitry established the Dormition monastery on the Dubenka River and built a church in honor of the Nativity of the Holy Theotokos over the graves of the fallen warriors.

The defeated Mamai was presently dethroned by a rival Mongol general, Tokhtamysh. That khan reasserted Mongol rule of Rus and overran Moscow in 1382 for Dmitry&#x27;s resistance to Mamai. Dmitry, however, pledged his loyalty to Tokhtamysh and to the Golden Horde and was reinstated as Mongol principal tax collector and Grand Duke of Vladimir. Upon his death in Moscow in 1389, Dmitry was the first Grand Duke to bequeath his titles to his son Vasily I of Moscow without consulting the Khan.

==Marriage and children==

He was married to Eudoxia of Nizhniy Novgorod. She was a daughter of Dmitry of Suzdal and Vasilisa of Rostov. They had at least twelve children:

*Daniil Dmitriyevich ( – 15 September 1379).
*Vasiliy I of Moscow (30 September 1371 – 27 February 1425).
*Sofia Dmitriyevna. Married Fyodor Olegovich, Prince of Ryazan (reigned 1402–1427).
*Yuriy Dmitriyevich, Duke of Zvenigorod and Galich (26 November 1374 – 5 June 1434). Claimed the throne of Moscow against his nephew Vasiliy II of Moscow.
*Maria Dmitriyevna (d. 15 May 1399). Married Lengvenis.
*Anastasia Dmitriyevna. Married Ivan Vsevolodovich, Prince of Kholm.
*Simeon Dmitrievich (d. 11 September 1379).
*Ivan Dmitriyevich (d. 1393).
*Andrey Dmitriyevich, Prince of Mozhaysk (14 August 1382 – 9 July 1432).
*Pyotr Dmitriyevich, Prince of Dmitrov (29 July 1385 – 10 August 1428).
*Anna Dmitriyevna (born 8 January 1387). Married Yury Patrikiyevich. Her husband was a son of Patrikas, Prince of Starodub and his wife Helena. His paternal grandfather was Narimantas. The marriage solidified his role as a Boyar attached to Moscow.
*Konstantin Dmitriyevich, Prince of Pskov (14 May/15 May 1389 – 1433).

== Veneration ==

Right-Believing Prince Demetrius Ioannovich Donskoy was canonized on 6 June 1988 in Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius by 1988 Local Council of the Russian Orthodox Church under Patriarch Pimen I of Moscow.

<doc id="148188" wikidata="Q37005" url="?curid=148188" title="Zenaga language">
<text>Zenaga (autonym: &#x27; or&#x27;) is a Berber language spoken in Mauritania and northern Senegal by thousands of people. Zenaga Berber is spoken as a mother tongue from the town of Mederdra in southwestern Mauritania to the Atlantic coast and in northern Senegal. The language is recognized by the Mauritanian government.

It shares its basic linguistic structure with other Berber idioms in Morocco and Algeria, but specific features are quite different. In fact, Zenaga is probably the most divergent surviving Berber language, with a significantly different sound system made even more distant by sound changes such as &gt; and &gt; as well as a difficult-to-explain profusion of glottal stops.

The name &quot;Zenaga&quot; comes from that of a much larger ancient Berber tribe, the Iznagen (Iẓnagen), who are known in Arabic as the Sanhaja. Adrian Room&#x27;s &quot;African Placenames&quot; gives Zenaga derivations for some place-names in Mauritania.

==Demographics==
Zenaga is a language descended from the Sanhaja confederation who ruled over much of North Africa during the early Middle Ages. Zenaga was once spoken throughout Mauritania and beyond but fell into decline when its speakers were defeated by the invading Maqil Arabs in the Char Bouba war of the 17th century. After this war, they were forbidden to bear arms and variously became either specialists in Islamic religious scholarship or servants to more powerful tribes. It was among the former, more prestigious group that Zenaga survived longest.

In 1940 (Dubié 1940), Zenaga was spoken by about 13,000 people belonging to four nomadic tribes distributed in an area roughly bounded by Saint-Louis, Podor, Boutilimit and Nouakchott (but including none of these cities):
* (&#x27;the five&#x27;): 4,653 speakers out of 12,000 members
* (&#x27;i-D-ab-lahs-en&#x27;): 5,000 out of 5,000
* (&#x27;i-Kumleil-en&#x27;), subtribe of the Ida u el Hadj: 700 (out of Ida u el Hadj population of 4,600)
*: 2,889 out of 8,500

These tribes, according to Dubié, traditionally specialised in Islamic religious scholarship and led a nomadic lifestyle, specialising in sheep and cows (camel-herding branches of the same tribes had already switched to Arabic). Even then, many speakers were shifting to Hassaniya Arabic, the main Arabic variety spoken in Mauritania, and all were bilingual. Zenaga was used only within the tribe, and it was considered impolite to speak it when non-speakers were present; some speakers deliberately avoided using Zenaga with their children, hoping to give them a head start in Hassaniya. However, many speakers regarded Zenaga as a symbol of their independence and their religious fervour; Dubie cites a Hassaniya proverb: &quot;A Moor who speaks Zenaga is certainly not a Zenagui (that is, a or a member of a Berber tribe subjugated by the Arab Beni Hassan), nor a warrior&quot;.

Half a century later, the number of speakers is reportedly around 2,000. While Zenaga appears to be nearing extinction, Hassaniya Arabic contains a substantial number of Zenaga loanwords (more than 10% of the vocabulary).

== Phonology ==

=== Vowels ===


=== Consonants ===
* [v] can be heard as an allophone of /f/.
* Sounds [tˤ] and [sˤ] occur marginally.
* Pharyngeal sounds /ħ, ʕ/ are heard from Arabic loanwords.

==Dialects==
There are significant dialectal differences within Zenaga, notably between the &quot;Id-ab-lahsen&quot; and &quot;Tendgha&quot; dialects.

<text>Vasily I Dmitriyevich (; 30 December 137127 February 1425) was Grand Prince of Vladimir and Moscow from 1389. He was the heir of Dmitry Donskoy, who reigned from 1359 to 1389.

He entered an alliance with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in 1392 and married Sophia, the only daughter of Vytautas, though the alliance turned out to be fragile, and they waged war against each other in 1406–1408.

The raid on the Volga region in 1395 by the Turco-Mongol emir Timur resulted in a state of anarchy for the Golden Horde and the independence of Moscow. In 1412, Vasily resumed submission to the Horde.

==Family and early life==

Vasily was the oldest son of Dmitry Donskoy and Grand Princess Eudoxia, daughter of Grand Prince Dmitry Konstantinovich of Nizhny Novgorod.

==Reign==
While still a young man, Vasily, who was the eldest son of Grand Prince Dmitry Donskoy (ruled Moscow 1359–89), travelled to the Tatar khan Tokhtamysh (1383) to obtain the Khan&#x27;s &quot;yarlik&quot; (patent) for his father for the title of grand prince of Vladimir. Diplomatically overcoming the challenge of the prince of Tver, who also sought the patent, Vasily succeeded in his mission. But he was subsequently kept at Tokhtamysh&#x27;s court as a hostage until 1386 when, taking advantage of Tokhtamysh&#x27;s conflict with his suzerain Timur Lenk (Tamerlane), he escaped and returned to Moscow.

With Tokhtamysh&#x27;s permission, Vasily I took over Nizhny Novgorod-Suzdal in 1393. Nizhny Novgorod was given to Vasily by the Khan of the Golden Horde in exchange for the help Moscow had given against one of his rivals. He also took Murom. In 1397–1398 Kaluga, Vologda, Veliki Ustyug and the lands of the Komi peoples were annexed.

To prevent Muscovy from being attacked by the Golden Horde, Vasily I entered into an alliance with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in 1392 and married Sophia of Lithuania, the only daughter of Vytautas the Great. The alliance turned out to be fragile, and they waged war against each other in 1406–1408. Vytautas had positioned himself as an unifier of all Rus’ lands, the Polish historian Koneczny spoke of the potentiality &quot;that could have been realised had the program of the subjugation of all of Rus’ been implemented&quot;. Furthermore, he saw the potentiality of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania becoming an empire by virtue of all of Rus’ being under Lithuanian domination. Vytautas, thus attacked Novgorod and Pskov, clashing with his son-in-law Vasily but later making peace. This peace allowed Vytautas to strike against the Teutonic order at the Battle of Grunwald. However, the terms of the Union of Horodlo negotiated by Polish King Jogaila, which discriminated against Orthodox Christians, caused Lithuania to lose its influence over the Russian states.

Mongol emir Timur raided the Slavic lands in 1395; he ruined the Volga region but did not penetrate as far as Moscow. Timur&#x27;s raid was of service to the Muscovite prince as it damaged the Golden Horde, which for the next twelve years was in a state of anarchy. During the whole of this time no tribute was paid to the khan, Olug Moxammat, though vast sums of money were collected in the Moscow treasury for military purposes.

In 1408 Edigu burnt Nizhny Novgorod, Gorodets, Rostov, and many other towns but failed to take Moscow, though he had still burnt it. In 1412, however, Vasily found it necessary to pay the long-deferred visit of submission to the Horde.

The growing influence of Moscow abroad was underlined by the fact that Vasily married his daughter Anna to Emperor John VIII Palaeologus of Byzantium.

==Domestic policy==
During his reign, feudal landownership kept growing. With the growth of princely authority in Moscow, the judicial powers of landowners were partially diminished and transferred to Vasily&#x27;s deputies and heads of volosts.

Chronicles speak of a monk called Lazar the Serb who arrived from Serbia, inventing and building a clock on a tower in the Grand Prince&#x27;s Terem Palace in Moscow behind the Cathedral of the Annunciation at the request of Vasily I, in 1404. It was the first ever mechanical clock in Moscow and the first in any Russian city. It was among the first ten such advanced clocks in Europe, and was regarded as a technical miracle at the time.

The most important ecclesiastical event of the reign was the elevation of the Bulgarian, Gregory Tsamblak, to the metropolitan see of Kiev by Vytautas, grand-duke of Lithuania; the immediate political consequence of which was the weakening of the hold of Moscow on southwestern Rus&#x27;.

==Marriage and children==
Vasily married Sophia of Lithuania, the only child of Vytautas the Great and his wife, Anna. They had nine known children, five boys (of which only one survived to mature adulthood) and four girls:
*Anna of Moscow (1393 – August 1417), wife of John VIII Palaiologos, died of bubonic plague
*Yury Vasilievich (30 March 1395 – 30 November 1400)
*Ivan Vasilievich (15 January 1397 – 20 July 1417), died on the way from Kolomna to Moscow as a result of &quot;pestilence&quot;, just six months after marrying the daughter of Prince Ivan Vladimirovich of Pronsk and receiving the inheritance of Nizhny Novgorod
*Anastasia Vasilievna (d. 1470), wife of Vladymir Alexander, Prince of Kiev. Her husband was a son of Vladymir, Prince of Kiev. His paternal grandparents were Algirdas and Maria of Vitebsk.
*Daniil Vasilievich (6 December 1400 – May 1402), died of pestilence
*Vasilisa Vasilievna, wife of Alexander Ivanovich &quot;Brukhaty&quot;, Prince of Suzdal, and Alexander Daniilovich &quot;Vzmetenj&quot;, Prince of Suzdal.
*Simeon Vasilievich (13 January – 7 April 1405), died of pestilence
*Maria Vasilievna, wife of Yuri Patrikievich. Her husband was a son of Patrikas, Prince of Starodub, and his wife, Helena. His paternal grandfather was Narimantas.
*Vasily II of Moscow (10 March 1415 – 27 March 1462)

Sophia also suffered many miscarriages: 
* A miscarriage of a daughter in the 4th month of pregnancy (19 December 1391).
* A miscarriage of a daughter in the 6th month of pregnancy (16 August 1392).
* A miscarriage in the 1st month of pregnancy (22 January 1394).

* A miscarriage in the 1st month of pregnancy (30 January 1399).
* A miscarriage in the 1st month of pregnancy (30 March 1401).
* A miscarriage of a son in the 5th and a half-month of pregnancy (11 January 1403).
* A miscarriage of a son in the 4th and a half-month of pregnancy (20 March 1406).
* A miscarriage in 1410.
* A miscarriage in 1412.
* A miscarriage in 1414.
* A miscarriage in 1416.
* A miscarriage in 1418.
* A miscarriage in 1420.

<text>Vasily II Vasilyevich (; 10 March 141527 March 1462), nicknamed the Blind or the Dark (), was Grand Prince of Moscow from 1425 until his death in 1462.

He succeeded his father, Vasily I, only to be challenged by his uncle Yuri of Zvenigorod. During this time, Moscow changed hands several times. At one point, Vasily was captured and blinded by his cousin Dmitry Shemyaka in 1446. The final victory went to Vasily, who was supported by most people. Due to his disability, he made his son Ivan III his co-ruler in his later years.

==Reign==

===First ten years of struggle===

Vasily II was the youngest son of Vasily I of Moscow by Sophia of Lithuania, the only daughter of Vytautas the Great, and the only son to survive his father (his elder brother Ivan died in 1417 at the age of 22). On his father&#x27;s death Vasily II was proclaimed Grand Duke at the age of 10. His mother acted as a regent. His uncle, Yuri of Zvenigorod (the prince of Galich-Mersky), and his two sons, Vasily Kosoy (&quot;the Cross-Eyed&quot;) and Dmitry Shemyaka, seized on the opportunity to advance their own claims to the throne. These claims were based on the Testament of Dmitry Donskoy, Yuri&#x27;s father and Vasily II&#x27;s grandfather, who had stated that if Vasily I died Yuri would succeed his appanage. However, Dmitri had written the testament when Vasily I had no children of his own, and it might be argued that this provision had been made only for the case of Vasily I&#x27;s childless death. Vasily II&#x27;s claim was supported by Vytautas, his maternal grandfather.

Upon Vytautas&#x27; death in 1430, Yuri went to the Golden Horde, returning with a license to take the Moscow throne. But the Khan did not support him any further, largely due to the devices of the Smolensk princeling and Moscow boyarin Ivan Vsevolzhsky. When Yuri assembled an army and attacked Moscow, Vasily II, betrayed by Vsevolzhsky, was defeated and captured by his enemies in 1433. Upon being proclaimed the grand prince of Moscow, Yuri pardoned his nephew and sent him to reign in the town of Kolomna. That proved to be a mistake, as Vasily II immediately started to plot against his uncle and gather all sort of malcontents. Feeling how insecure his throne was, Yuri resigned and then left Moscow for his northern hometown. When Vasily II returned to Moscow, he had Vsevolzhsky blinded as a traitor.

Meanwhile, Yuri&#x27;s claim was inherited by his sons who decided to continue the fight. They managed to defeat Vasily II, who had to seek refuge in the Golden Horde. After Yuri died in 1434, Vasili the Cross-Eyed entered the Kremlin and was proclaimed new Grand Duke. Dmitry Shemyaka, who had his own plans for the throne, quarreled with his brother and concluded an alliance with Vasily II. Together they managed to banish Vasily the Cross-Eyed from the Kremlin in 1435. The latter was captured and blinded, which effectively removed him from the contest for the throne.

===Kazan and Shemyaka===
During Vasily II &#x27;s reign, the Golden Horde collapsed and broke up into smaller Khanates. Now that his throne was relatively secure, he had to deal with the Tatar threat. In 1439, Vasily II had to flee the capital, when it was besieged by Ulugh Muhammad, ruler of the nascent Kazan Khanate. Six years later, he personally led his troops against Ulugh Muhammad, but was defeated and taken prisoner. The Russians were forced to gather an enormous ransom for their prince, so that Vasily II could be released some five months later.

During that time, the control of Moscow passed to Dmitry Shemyaka. Keeping in mind the fate of his own brother, Dmitry had Vasily II blinded and exiled him to Uglich, in 1446; hence, Vasily II&#x27;s nickname, &quot;the blind&quot;. As Vasily II still had a number of supporters in Moscow, Dmitry recalled him from exile and gave him Vologda as an appanage. That proved to be a mistake, as Vasily II quickly assembled his supporters and regained the throne.

Vasily II&#x27;s final victory against his cousin came in the 1450s, when he captured Galich-Mersky and poisoned Dmitry. The latter&#x27;s children managed to escape to Lithuania. These events finally put to rest the principle of collateral succession, which was a major cause of medieval internecine struggles, and was a definitive victory for the principle of succession from father to son as against the previous practice. This also paved the way for political centralization of power, which was popular in the country at the time.

===Later reign and policies===
Now that the war was over, Vasily II eliminated almost all of the small appanages in Moscow principality, so as to strengthen his sovereign authority. His military campaigns of 1441–1460 increased Moscow&#x27;s hold over Suzdal, the Vyatka lands, and the republican governments of Novgorod and Pskov.

In the meantime, Constantinople fell to the Turks, and the patriarch agreed to acknowledge the supremacy of the Pope in the Council of Florence. After the death of Photius in 1431, he was replaced by Isidore as metropolitan, a nominee of Byzantium, who took part in the Council of Florence. Upon his return to Moscow, he was dismissed and imprisoned by Vasily, who was opposed to any agreement with western Catholicism. In 1448, a council of Russian bishops elected Jonah as the metropolitan of the Russian Orthodox Church, which was tantamount to declaration of independence from the patriarch of Constantinople. This move further strengthened Moscow&#x27;s reputation among Orthodox states.

Vasily also adopted the title of sovereign of all Russia when he returned to the throne, taking inspiration from his uncle Dmitry, and began issuing coins with the title. The Muscovites began developing an identity of the grand prince as the sovereign and the ruler of all the Russian lands, and Vasily positioned himself as the defender of Orthodoxy.

In his later years, the blind prince was greatly helped by Metropolitan Jonah, boyars, and then by his older son Ivan III who was styled as co-ruler since the late 1450s. On Vasily II&#x27;s death in 1462, Ivan III succeeded him as the grand prince of Moscow. Vasily&#x27;s daughter Anna was married to a prince of Ryazan.

<doc id="148191" wikidata="Q171185" url="?curid=148191" title="Ivan III of Russia">
<text>Ivan III Vasilyevich (; 22 January 1440 – 27 October 1505), also known as Ivan the Great, was Grand Prince of Moscow and all Russia from 1462 until his death in 1505. Ivan served as the co-ruler and regent for his blind father Vasily II before he officially ascended the throne.

He multiplied the territory of his state through conquest, purchase, inheritance and the seizure of lands from his dynastic relatives, and laid the foundations of the centralized Russian state. He also renovated the Moscow Kremlin and introduced a new legal code. Ivan is credited with ending the dominance of the Tatars over Russia; his victory over the Great Horde in 1480 formally restored its independence.

Ivan began using the title tsar, and used the title tentatively until the Habsburgs recognized it. While officially using &quot;tsar&quot; in his correspondence with other monarchs, he was satisfied with the title of grand prince at home.
Through marriage to Sophia Palaiologina, Ivan made the double-headed eagle Russia&#x27;s coat of arms, and adopted the idea of Moscow as the third Rome. His 43-year reign was the second-longest in Russian history, after that of his grandson Ivan IV.

==Early life==
Ivan Vasilyevich was born on 22 January 1440 into the family of Vasily II, the grand prince of Moscow, and Maria of Borovsk, the daughter of an appanage prince and a granddaughter of Vladimir the Bold.

The first time Ivan is called heir and grand prince in treaties between his father and other Russian princes is in a treaty with Ivan Vasilyevich of Suzdal dating from 1448 or 1449. The title of grand prince is not included in a treaty with Casimir IV of Poland dating from 13 August 1449, but appears again in treaties with Vasily Yaroslavich of Serpukhov in the early 1450s.

Ivan had four brothers: Yury, Andrey Bolshoy (&quot;the big&quot;), Boris, and Andrey Menshoy (&quot;the little&quot;). In the same will that Vasily II had given Ivan III the grand principality, his brothers were awarded appanages. Yury was given Dmitrov, Mozhaysk and Serpukhov, Andrey Bolshoy was given Uglich, Bezhetsk and Verkh and Zvenigorod, Boris was given Volokolamsk, Rzhev and Ruza, while Andrey Menshoy was given Vologda.

==Reign==
===Territorial expansion and centralization===
Ivan&#x27;s rule is marked by vastly expanding the territory and his control of Muscovy. As part of the successful &quot;gathering of the Russian lands&quot;, Ivan brought the independent duchies of different Rurikid princes under the direct control of Moscow, leaving the princes and their posterity without royal titles or land inheritance. It was during Ivan&#x27;s reign that the emergence of a centralized Russian state occurred following a period of feudal fragmentation, with Moscow at its center.

Following a war with the Novgorod Republic in 1456, due to Novgorod&#x27;s support of the rebellious Dmitry Shemyaka against Vasily II in his civil war, Moscow began to gradually seize land in the northern territories that were formerly under Novgorodian control for the next decade and half due to a desire for luxury furs in the area. This led to a struggle with Novgorod for the Russian fur trade, and thus, an economic rivalry for fur, land and trade ports. Some Novgorodian boyars were opposed to Moscow as a result, while others pursued a pro-Moscow policy in the hopes that good relations could reduce disruption in east-west trade, while Novgorod was also dependent on the Russian lands to its southwest for important imports such as grain. Some Novgorodians were also attracted to Moscow due to it being the center of Russian Orthodoxy as opposed to Lithuania, where Catholicism was dominant and its culture was being increasingly polonized, though some Novgorodian clergy adopted a pro-Lithuanian policy for political reasons due to fears that embracing the grand prince of Moscow would eventually lead to the end of Novgorod&#x27;s independence.


By 1470, with the pro-Lithuanian faction being dominant, the Novgorodian boyars questioned Ivan&#x27;s sovereignty over the city-state as their prince. Novgorod negotiated with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and requested Casimir IV to send them a prince. This led to Mikhailo Olelkovich, Ivan&#x27;s cousin, to be accepted as the new prince, though he would step down as prince shortly after. Ivan saw the actions of Novgorod as a cause for war, and he also called it an act of apostasy from Orthodoxy (in part, because Poland and its monarchs were Catholic). Ivan led his troops to Novgorod where his army defeated the Novgorodians at the Battle of Shelon on 14 July 1471. Ivan then had the four leaders of the anti-Moscow faction in Novgorod executed, including the son of Marfa Boretskaya, an influential boyar woman who had played a leading role in the faction. In a peace treaty signed on 11 August 1471, Novgorod agreed to abandon its overtures to Lithuania and to cede a considerable portion of its northern territories, while paying a war indemnity of 15,500 rubles. Novgorod also had to recognize Moscow&#x27;s claims to territories to the east of the Northern Dvina which they had been struggling over. Ivan took a promise of allegiance from Novgorod, but left its system of government in place.

For the next six years, pro-Moscow and anti-Moscow factions in Novgorod competed with one another. Ivan visited Novgorod several times during this period, persecuting a number of pro-Lithuanian boyars and confiscating their lands. In 1477, two Novgorodian envoys, claiming to have been sent by the archbishops and the entire city, addressed Ivan in public audience as &quot;gosudar&quot; (sovereign) instead of the usual &quot;gospodin&quot; (sir). Ivan at once seized upon this as a recognition of his sovereignty, and when the Novgorodians repudiated the envoys (indeed, one was killed at the veche and several others of the pro-Moscow faction were killed with him) and swore openly in front of the Moscow ambassadors that they would turn to Lithuania again, he marched against them. Surrounded by Ivan&#x27;s army, Novgorod ultimately recognized Ivan&#x27;s direct rule over the city and its vast hinterland in a document signed and sealed by Archbishop Feofil of Novgorod (1470–1480) on 15 January 1478.

Ivan dispossessed Novgorod of more than four-fifths of its land, keeping half for himself and giving the other half to his allies. Subsequent revolts (1479–1488) were punished by the removal en masse of the richest and most ancient families of Novgorod to Moscow, Vyatka, and other cities. Many merchants, landholders, and boyars were replaced with loyalists who came from Moscow. The Novgorod veche and its elected offices were also abolished. Archbishop Feofil was also removed to Moscow for plotting against the grand prince. The rival republic of Pskov owed the continuance of its own political existence to the readiness with which it assisted Ivan against its old enemy. The acquisition of Novgorod alone nearly doubled the size of his realm. Soon after the formal annexation of Novgorod, Ivan assumed the title of sovereign of all Russia (&quot;gosudar vseya Rusi&quot;); the title reflected his achievements in uniting the Russian lands but also implied claims to other territories inhabited by the East Slavs which were under the control of the Lithuanian grand dukes, and would later lead to conflict with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.

Other principalities were eventually absorbed by conquest, purchase, or marriage contract: the Principality of Yaroslavl in 1463, Rostov in 1474, Tver in 1485, and Vyatka 1489. Ivan also increased Moscow&#x27;s dominance over Pskov, with his son and successor Vasily III formally annexing it in 1510. Prince Mikhail Andreyevich of Vereya, who had been awarded an appanage by Vasily II, was pressured in 1478 into giving Belozersk to Ivan, who received all of Mikhail&#x27;s land on his death in 1486. Some princes from the Upper Oka region, who had been under Lithuanian rule, left Lithuanian service and joined the Muscovite court in the 1480s, including the Vorotynskys, Odoyevskys, Gorchakovs, and others. A peace treaty signed on 5 February 1494 legalized the acquisitions. Moscow also subjugated several Finno-Ugric tribes to the east of Vyatka in the late 15th century, some of whom had fled eastward as far as the Ob River, but by 1500, they were all paying tribute.

Whereas his father Vasily II followed the custom of dividing the realm between his sons, seeing this as a cause for weakness and instability, Ivan consolidated his exclusive control over Muscovy during his reign. Ivan&#x27;s refusal to share his conquests with his brothers, and his subsequent interference with the internal politics of their inherited principalities, involved him in several wars with them, from which, though the princes were assisted by Lithuania, he emerged victorious. Finally, Ivan&#x27;s new rule of government, formally set forth in his last will to the effect that the domains of all his kinsfolk, after their deaths, should pass directly to the reigning grand prince instead of reverting, as hitherto, to the princes&#x27; heirs, put an end once and for all to these semi-independent princelings.

Ivan had four brothers. The eldest, Yury, died childless on 12 September 1472. He only had a draft of a will that said nothing about his land. Ivan seized the land, much to the fury of the surviving brothers, whom he placated with some land. Boris and Andrey Bolshoy signed treaties with Vasily in February and September 1473. They agreed to protect each other&#x27;s land and not to have secret dealings with foreign states; they broke this clause in 1480, fleeing to Lithuania. It is unknown whether Andrey Menshoy signed a treaty. He died in 1481, leaving his lands to Ivan. In 1491, Andrey Bolshoy was arrested by Ivan for refusing to aid the Crimean Khanate against the Golden Horde. He died in prison in 1493, and Ivan seized his land. In 1494, Boris, the only brother able to pass his land to his sons, died. However, their land reverted to the tsar upon their deaths in 1503 and 1515 respectively.

===Domestic policy===

The character of the government of Moscow changed significantly under Ivan III, taking on a new autocratic form, as Moscow increased its hegemony, but also to new imperial pretensions. After the fall of Constantinople, Orthodox canonists were inclined to regard the grand princes of Moscow, where the Metropolitan of Kiev moved in 1325 after the Mongol invasions, as the successors of the Byzantine emperors. Ivan himself appeared to welcome the idea, and he began to use the title of tsar in foreign correspondence, meaning caesar.

The adoption of Byzantine symbolism and its ceremonial style in effect allowed for the Muscovite grand prince to claim the powers of that of a Byzantine emperor. Russian ruling circles were already well aware of Byzantine traditions, including the court, hierarchy, and symbolism, due in part to most of the Kievan metropolitans and clerics of the Russian Orthodox Church having been Greeks. The Russians had also long called the Byzantine emperor &quot;tsar&quot;, and had known of the South Slavic writers who gave the title to their most successful rulers. A Serbian monk who had arrived in Moscow in the early 1440s helped to provide the foundation for the title, having composed a &quot;chronograph&quot; which included the prophecy of a &quot;Russian&quot; clan coming to rule in Constantinople. He also referred to the Muscovite grand prince as the &quot;Orthodox tsar and autocrat&quot; following the Council of Florence.

This movement coincided with a change in the family circumstances of Ivan III. After the death of his first consort in 1467, Maria of Tver, and at the suggestion of Pope Paul II in 1469, who hoped thereby to bind Moscow to the Holy See, Ivan III wedded Sophia Palaiologina (also known under her original name Zoe) in 1472, daughter of Thomas Palaeologus, despot of Morea, who claimed the throne of Constantinople as the brother of Constantine XI, the last Byzantine emperor. Frustrating the Pope&#x27;s hopes of reuniting the two faiths, the princess endorsed Eastern Orthodoxy. Due to her family traditions, she encouraged imperial ideas in the mind of her consort. It was through her influence that the ceremonious etiquette of Constantinople (along with the imperial double-headed eagle and all that it implied) was adopted by the court of Moscow. Ivan combined the double-headed eagle with his emblem of St. George slaying the dragon; his family seal became and remained a symbol of the Russian tsars until the monarchy was abolished in 1917. Ivan&#x27;s marriage would add to Moscow&#x27;s prestige after the Russian Orthodox Church had earlier declared itself autocephalous in 1448, and a native metropolitan was installed in Moscow. The transformation to absolutism was supported by the Russian Orthodox Church, which benefitted from Moscow&#x27;s increased international standing, with the doctrine of Moscow as the &quot;third Rome&quot; beginning to emerge.


Ivan&#x27;s son with Maria of Tver, Ivan Ivanovich, whom he had designated as his heir and was made co-ruler in 1471, died in 1490, leaving from his marriage with Elena of Moldavia an only child, Dmitry Ivanovich. Ivan attempted to secure his title for his successor, and the latter was crowned as successor by his grandfather on 15 February 1498, but later Ivan reverted his decision in favor of Sophia&#x27;s elder son Vasily, who was ultimately crowned co-regent with his father on 14 April 1502. The decision was dictated by the crisis connected with the Sect of Skhariya the Jew, as well as by the imperial prestige of Sophia&#x27;s descendants. Dmitry was put into prison, where he died, unmarried and childless, in 1509, already under the rule of his uncle. His successor Vasily was made co-ruler in 1502, and during Vasily&#x27;s reign, he would expand the usage of the title of tsar in all matters.

The grand prince increasingly held aloof from his boyars, who were a barrier to the transformation to absolutism. As a result, he gradually reduced the boyars&#x27; economic and political powers. He granted estates called &quot;pomestie&quot; to a new noble class in exchange for military service and other conditions, allowing him to build up a centralized army and create a counterbalance to the boyars. The old patriarchal systems of government vanished. The boyars, who would meet in a council known as a boyar duma, were no longer consulted on state affairs. The sovereign became sacrosanct, while the boyars were reduced to dependency on the will of the sovereign. The boyars naturally resented this revolution and struggled against it.

It was in the reign of Ivan III that the new sudebnik, or law code, was compiled by the scribe, Vladimir Gusev. The death penalty was mandated for rebellion or sedition, which was a more severe penalty compared to that of the earlier &quot;Russkaya Pravda&quot;. It restricted the mobility of peasants, also requiring an exit fee to be paid to the landlords, which were in the interests of the new noble class. Ivan therefore laid the groundwork for serfdom, which would negatively impact Russia&#x27;s development in the following centuries.

Ivan did his utmost to make his capital a worthy successor to Constantinople, and with that object invited many foreign masters and artificers to settle in Moscow. Ivan&#x27;s most notable construction was the rebuilding of the Kremlin in Moscow. The most noted of these architects was the Italian Ridolfo di Fioravante, nicknamed &quot;Aristotle&quot; because of his extraordinary knowledge, who built several cathedrals and palaces in the Kremlin, and also supervised the construction of the walls of the Kremlin. These include the Dormition Cathedral and Palace of Facets. Construction of the Ivan the Great Bell Tower also started in 1505, which was completed after his death.

===Foreign policy===

Moscow played an increasingly visible role in international affairs as it established diplomatic relations with the Crimean Khanate and the Republic of Venice in 1474, the Kingdom of Hungary in 1482, the Holy Roman Empire in 1489, the Kingdom of Denmark in 1493, and the Ottoman Empire in 1496. The outline of Russian foreign policy for the next several generations was shaped during Ivan&#x27;s reign, where his successors would continue to struggle with Poland and Lithuania over the territories of the East Slavs, while a more differentiated policy was pursued towards the Muslim khanates, with attempts at subjugating the Khanate of Kazan and neutralizing the Crimean Khanate.

In 1476, Ivan refused to pay the customary tribute to Ahmed Khan, and in 1480, Ahmed Khan launched an invasion of Russia. Throughout the autumn, the Muscovite and Tatar hosts confronted each other on opposite sides of the Ugra River until 11 November 1480, when Ahmed retreated into the steppe. In traditional Russian historiography, it is marked as the end of the &quot;Tatar yoke&quot; over Russia. In the following year, Ahmed Khan, while preparing a second expedition against Moscow, was suddenly attacked, routed and slain by Khan Ibak of the Nogai Horde, whereupon the Golden Horde suddenly fell to pieces. In 1487, Ivan reduced the Khanate of Kazan, one of the offshoots of the Horde, to the condition of a vassal state, though in his later years, it broke away from his suzerainty. With the other Muslim powers, the khan of the Crimean Khanate and the sultans of the Ottoman Empire, Ivan&#x27;s relations were peaceful and even amicable. The Crimean khan, Meñli I Giray, helped him against the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and facilitated the opening of diplomatic relations between Moscow and Constantinople, where the first embassy appeared in 1495.


The Christian rulers in the Caucasus began to see the Russian monarchs as their natural allies against the Muslim regional powers. The first attempt at forging an alliance was made by Alexander I, king of a small Georgian kingdom of Kakheti, who dispatched two embassies, in 1483 and 1491, to Moscow. However, as the Russians were still too far from the Caucasus, neither of these missions had any effect on the course of events in the region. In 1488, Ivan sought gun founders, master gunners for siege cannons, gold and silversmiths, and Italian master builders from King Matthias Corvinus.

In his dealings with the Habsburgs, Ivan was offered the title of king (&quot;rex&quot;) if he would join the alliance against Turkey, but he rejected such offers and continued his own policy, laying claim to the Kievan legacy and adopting the title of autocrat (&quot;samoderzhets&quot;), sovereign (&quot;gosudar&quot;) of the Russian land, and grand prince of Moscow and all Russia. Beginning in 1484, Ivan began to use the title of tsar in his foreign correspondence with secondary powers in Europe including the Livonian Order. At times the title was translated as &quot;imperator&quot;, such as in a 1493 treaty with Denmark where Ivan was called &quot;domino Johanne totius Rutzie imperator&quot;. Ivan also began insisting on the title to the Habsburgs in 1489, and he continued to portray himself to his subjects and foreign states as the Orthodox emperor. Whenever was possible in diplomatic situations, Ivan and his representatives would refer to him as tsar. According to Isabel de Madariaga, had the title of Russian monarchs continued to be translated as &quot;rex&quot;, Russia&#x27;s assimilation into the ranking order of states in Europe would have been much easier.

In Nordic affairs, Ivan concluded an offensive alliance with John of Denmark and maintained regular correspondence with Emperor Maximilian I, who called him a &quot;brother&quot;. He built a strong citadel in Ingria, named Ivangorod after himself, situated on the Russian-Estonian border, opposite the fortress of Narva held by the Livonian Confederation. In the Russo-Swedish War, Ivan unsuccessfully attempted to conquer Vyborg from Sweden, but this attempt was checked by the Swedish garrison in Vyborg Castle led by Lord Knut Posse.

Ivan deemed Moscow to be the legitimate heir to the territories that formerly belonged to Kievan Rus&#x27;, leading to wars with Lithuania, including skirmishes in the late 1480s and early 1490s. The further extension of his dominion was facilitated by the death of Casimir IV in 1492, when Poland and Lithuania once again parted company. The throne of Lithuania was now occupied by Casimir&#x27;s son Alexander, a weak and lethargic prince so incapable of defending his possessions against the persistent attacks of the Muscovites that he attempted to save them by a matrimonial compact, wedding Helena, Ivan&#x27;s daughter. But the clear determination of Ivan to appropriate as much of Lithuania as possible finally compelled Alexander to take up arms against his father-in-law in 1499. A full-scale war broke out in 1500. The Lithuanians were routed at the Battle of Vedrosha on 14 July 1500, and in 1503, Alexander was glad to purchase peace by ceding Chernigov, Starodub, Novgorod-Seversky, and sixteen other towns. However, Smolensk remained in Lithuanian hands, though Ivan&#x27;s son Vasily III would take the city in 1514.

==Legacy==
Ivan conquered or brought under his control the lands of &quot;Great Russia&quot;, leading to Russian historians to call him the &quot;gatherer of the Russian lands&quot;. Ivan therefore arguably became best known for his consolidation of Muscovite rule; his contemporaries and later historians saw Ivan as a skilled politician who was consistent and efficient in the construction of a unified and autocratic Russian state. His predecessors had increased Moscow&#x27;s territory from less than under Ivan II () to more than at the end of Vasily II&#x27;s reign. It remained for Ivan III to absorb Moscow&#x27;s old rivals, Novgorod and Tver, and establish virtually a single rule over what had been appanages. Although the circumstances surrounding the acquisitions varied, the results were basically the same: former sovereign or semi-autonomous principalities were reduced to the status of provinces of Moscow, while their princes joined the ranks of the Muscovite service nobility.

After the death of his first wife in 1467, Ivan married Sophia (Zoë) Palaiologina in 1472, a Byzantine princess and niece of the last Byzantine emperor, Constantine XI, who was killed in battle in 1453. The Vatican sponsored the marriage in hope of bringing Moscow under the sway of the Pope and of establishing a broad front against the Turks, a goal that failed. From Ivan&#x27;s point of view, the marriage fitted well into the general trend of elevating the Muscovite ruler.

Following his second marriage, Ivan developed a complicated court ceremonial on the Byzantine model and began to use the title of &quot;tsar&quot; and &quot;autocrat&quot;. Also during the reign of Ivan and his son, Vasily III, Moscow came to be referred to by spokesmen as the third Rome. Philotheos, a monk from Pskov, developed the idea of Moscow as the true successor to Byzantium and, hence, to Rome.

An impressive building program in Moscow took place under Ivan, directed primarily by Italian artists and craftsmen. New buildings were erected in the Kremlin in Moscow, and its walls were strengthened and furnished with towers and gates. In 1475, Ivan III established the first cannon foundry of Russia in Moscow, which started native cannon production.

The British historian J. L. I. Fennell emphasizes Ivan&#x27;s military and economic success, as well as his success in centralizing control over local rulers; however, he stated that his reign was also marked by cultural depression, lack of freedom, and isolation from the West.

During Ivan&#x27;s reign, &quot;the Russian state was consolidated, Russian territory tripled in size, trade expanded, and Western contacts shaped society&quot;. Tatar rule formally ended and Ivan elevated the principality to a sovereign nation, leading to him to be called &quot;Ivan the Great&quot;. Ivan died on 27 October 1505, and was succeeded by his son, Vasily III.

==Title==
In the 1480s, during his consolidation of territories, Ivan III had the following title: &quot;By the Grace of God, the Great Sovereign of the Russian land, Grand Prince Ivan Vasilyevich, Tsar of all Russia, Vladimir, and Moscow, and Novgorod, and Pskov, and Yugorsk, and Vyatka, and Perm, and others&quot;.

At the beginning of the 1490s, he also had the following title: &quot;Ivan, by the Grace of God, Sovereign of all Russia and Grand Prince of Vladimir, and Moscow, and Novgorod, and Pskov, and Tver, and Yugorsk, and Perm, and Bulgar, and others&quot;.

===Seal===
Following his marriage to Sophia Palaiologina, Ivan combined the double-headed eagle with his emblem of St. George slaying the dragon.

<text>Vasili III Ivanovich (; 25 March 14793 December 1533) was Grand Prince of Moscow and all Russia from 1505 until his death in 1533. He was the son of Ivan III and Sophia Paleologue and was christened with the name Gavriil (). Following on the ambitions of his predecessor Ivan, Vasili conquered Pskov, Ryazan and Smolensk as well as strengthening Russian influence in Kazan and to the Volga region. Several nobles were either exiled, sentenced or executed for criticizing his policies.

==Foreign affairs==
Vasili III maintained the policies initiated by his father Ivan III, focusing much of his reign on consolidating the territorial gains achieved by Ivan. Vasili annexed the last surviving autonomous provinces: Pskov in 1510, appanage of Volokolamsk in 1513, principalities of Ryazan in 1521 and Novgorod-Seversky in 1522.

Vasili also took advantage of the difficult position of Sigismund of Poland to capture Smolensk, the great eastern fortress of Lithuania (siege started 1512, ended in 1514), chiefly through the aid of the rebel Lithuanian, Prince Mikhail Glinski, who provided him with artillery and engineers. The loss of Smolensk was an important injury inflicted by Russia on Lithuania in the course of the Russo-Lithuanian Wars and only the exigencies of Sigismund compelled him to acquiesce in its surrender (1522).

In 1521 Vasili received an emissary of the neighboring Iranian Safavid Empire, sent by Shah Ismail I whose ambitions were to construct an Irano-Russian alliance against the common enemy, the Ottoman Empire.

Vasili saw some success against the Crimean Khanate. Although in 1519 his armies were defeated along the Oka River and he was obliged to buy off the Crimean khan, Mehmed I Giray, under the very walls of Moscow, towards the end of his reign he established Russian influence on the Volga. In 1531–32 he placed the pretender Cangali khan on the throne of Khanate of Kazan.

Vasili was the first grand-duke of Moscow who adopted the title of tsar and the double-headed eagle of the Byzantine Empire.

==Family life==
By 1526 when he was 47 years old, Vasili had been married to Solomonia Saburova for over 20 years with no heir to his throne being produced. Conscious of her husband&#x27;s disappointment, Solomonia tried to remedy this by consulting sorcerers and going on pilgrimages. When this proved unsuccessful, Vasili consulted the boyars, announcing that he did not trust his two brothers to handle Russia&#x27;s affairs and forbade them to marry anyone.

The boyars suggested that he take a new wife. A divorce due to wife sterility was unlawful, so he falsely accused her of witchcraft, and despite much opposition from the clergy, he divorced his barren wife, exiled her to a monastery, exiled the opposed clergy and soon married Princess Elena Glinskaya, the daughter of a Serbian princess and niece of his friend Michael Glinski. Not many of the boyars approved of his choice, as Elena was of Catholic upbringing. Vasili was so smitten that he defied Russian social norms and trimmed his beard to appear younger. After three days of matrimonial festivity, the couple consummated their marriage, though initially it appeared that Elena was as sterile as Solomonia. The Russian populace began to suspect this was a sign of God&#x27;s disapproval of the marriage. However, to the great joy of Vasili and the populace, the new tsaritsa gave birth to a son, who would succeed him as Ivan IV. Three years later, a second son, Yuri, was born. According to a story, Solomonia Saburova also bore a son in the convent where she had been confined, just several months after the controversial divorce.

He had three brothers: Yuri (born in 1480), Simeon (born in 1487) and Andrei (born in 1490), as well as five sisters: Elena (born and died in 1474), Feodosiya (born and died in 1475), another Elena (born 1476), another Feodosiya (born 1485) and Eudoxia (born 1492).

==Death==
Whilst out hunting on horseback near Volokolamsk, Vasili felt a great pain in his right hip, the result of an abscess. He was transported to the village of Kolp, where he was visited by two German doctors who were unable to stop the infection with conventional remedies. Believing that his time was short, Vasili requested to be returned to Moscow, where he was kept in the Saint Joseph Cathedral along the way. By 25 November 1533, Vasili reached Moscow and asked to be made a monk before dying. Taking on the name Varlaam, Vasili died at midnight, 3 December 1533.

<doc id="148193" wikidata="Q186321" url="?curid=148193" title="Feodor I of Russia">
<text>Feodor I Ioannovich () or Fyodor I Ivanovich (; 31 May 1557 – 17 January 1598), nicknamed the Blessed (), was Tsar of all Russia from 1584 until his death in 1598.

Feodor&#x27;s mother died when he was three, and he grew up in the shadow of his father, Ivan the Terrible. He was a pious man of retiring disposition and possibly suffered from mental disability. He took little interest in politics, and the country was effectively administered in his name by Boris Godunov, the brother of his beloved wife Irina. He died childless and was succeeded by Godunov as tsar, marking the end of the rule of the Rurik dynasty and spurring Russia&#x27;s descent into the catastrophic Time of Troubles.

He is listed in the Great Synaxaristes of the Eastern Orthodox Church, with his feast day on 7 January (O.S.).

==Early life==
Feodor was born on 31 May 1557 in Moscow, the third son of Ivan the Terrible by his first wife Anastasia Romanovna. He was baptized at the Chudov Monastery and his godfather was Macarius, the metropolitan of the Russian Orthodox Church. Although he was the sixth and youngest child of his mother, he grew up with only one older brother, Ivan Ivanovich, because all his other older siblings had died in infancy. His mother also died by the time Feodor was three years old, and her death greatly affected his father, who had been very attached to his wife. He also took a series of other wives, but Feodor&#x27;s only surviving half-sibling, Dmitry of Uglich, was born on 19 October 1582 to the tsar&#x27;s last wife.

Feodor therefore grew up in the shadow of a distant father, with no mother to succor him, and only his older brother Ivan Ivanovich for family solidarity. He grew to be sickly of health and diffident of temperament. He was extremely pious by nature, spending hours in prayer and contemplation. He was very fond of visiting churches, and would often cause the bells to be rung according to a special tradition in the Russian Orthodox Church. For this reason, he is known to history as Feodor the Bellringer. He is also listed in the Great Synaxaristes of the Orthodox Church, with his feast day on 7 January (O.S.).
In May 1562, as Ivan IV went on a campaign against the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, he left both tsareviches in Moscow and ordered Ivan Ivanovich “to write in his name to the commanders in all the towns about taking care of things and ordered all affairs of the land to his son Tsarevich Ivan&quot;. Upon his return in the autumn, the two tsareviches met the tsar on the Arbat, along with the metropolitan. During the next military campaign in the following year, the two sons were not given any formal responsibilities, and at the end of 1564, Ivan IV took his sons with him in the procession to Aleksandrovskaya Sloboda, where he would stay for most of the remainder of his reign. In 1577, Feodor was left by his father in Novgorod with the boyars Dmitry and Boris Godunov and others, including a tutor.

Feodor did not play any role in foreign affairs, whereas his brother is mentioned as a participant in military campaigns and political discussions in &quot;razriady&quot; every year from 1567 until his death. Despite this, Feodor was selected as a candidate for the Polish throne in 1572–1573 and 1574–1576, besides his father himself. Feodor and his brother were not given a new title by their father, and in August 1581, the papal envoy in Russia, Antonio Possevino, was ordered to be told by the tsar that Russian documents did not need to be written in the name of both the tsar and the tsareviches because &quot;my son Ivan has not yet been honored with the name of sovereign and my son Fyodor has not attained the age when he can rule the state with us&quot;. In the testament of Ivan IV, which has only survived in an 18th-century copy and is dated by historians to the 1570s, Feodor&#x27;s brother was blessed with the tsardom along with most of the tsar&#x27;s personal domain, with Feodor being given an appanage; however, the testament lost its validity following the sudden death of Ivan Ivanovich.
On 9 November 1581, Ivan Ivanovich died, with Antonio Possevino asserting in his 1586 book that he had been killed by his father in a fit of rage. His death left only Feodor and Dmitry as the remaining sons of the tsar. Feodor became tsar not only because of his brother&#x27;s death, but also because his brother did not have any children, despite being married three times. He lived very differently to his elder brother due to his physical weakness and possible mental deficiencies. According to the metropolitan, Feodor was blessed by his father to succeed him, &quot;to be anointed and crowned with that crown and diadem of the tsars ... [as] your father&#x27;s heritor [&quot;otchichem&quot;] and your grandfather&#x27;s heritor [&quot;dedichem&quot;] and the heir [&quot;naslednik&quot;] of the Russian tsardom&quot;.

In the spring of 1583, Feodor accompanied his father&#x27;s army on a military campaign against rebels around Kazan, along with two &quot;dyadki&quot; (servants). The two were not important boyars, but the first one belonged to the clan of Boris Godunov and would achieve the rank of boyar and &quot;dvoretsky&quot; shortly after Feodor ascended the throne, while the second one was another supporter of the Godunovs who would be promoted from &quot;dumny dvoryanin&quot; to &quot;okolnichy&quot; in 1586. Around the same time, Ivan IV was looking for his eighth wife in England and consulted his physician Robert Jacob about relatives of Queen Elizabeth I who would be suitable. Jacob suggested Lady Mary Hastings, and Ivan told Elizabeth that if the two were to have sons, they would be given appanages &quot;according to their sovereign rank&quot; (&quot;po ikh gosudarskomu chinu&quot;) and be treated &quot;equally in degree with Fyodor&quot; (&quot;v rovenstve po stepeni so tsarevichem Fedorom&quot;). However, the plan did not go anywhere.

==Reign==

Ivan IV died on , and Feodor succeeded his father as tsar. Two months later, on 31 May 1584, he was crowned as the tsar and autocrat of all Russia at the Dormition Cathedral in Moscow. The coronation of Feodor was slightly modified to account for his father&#x27;s recent conquests and the increasingly Byzantine practice of the tsar&#x27;s court. As Feodor was Ivan&#x27;s third son, the speechmakers for the coronation omitted the mention of &quot;first&quot; or &quot;firstborn&quot; in reference to heredity, which in the record of the coronation of his father, it was stated that the ancient custom of Russian grand princes was to bestow the rulership on &quot;their firstborn sons&quot;. As a result, Metropolitan Dionysius simply stated that &quot;the tsars and grand princes gave the Tsardom and Grand Principality of Russia to their sons [&quot;synom svoim&quot;]&quot;.

Due to the only surviving testament of Ivan IV being outdated and there being no reference of another testament having been written, historians have debated whether there was an informal regency council or not. The historian Ruslan Skrynnikov attempted to prove that the &quot;Zemsky Sobor&quot; (assembly of the land) elected Feodor as tsar, while Aleksandr Zimin rejected the idea. Lev Cherepnin tried to prove that the assembly had met but Feodor was not elected as he was already recognized as the new tsar. The few contemporary Russian sources available do not state that an election took place, such as the &quot;Stoglav&quot; of the church council of 2 July 1584 which states that Feodor was placed on the throne &quot;according to the blessing of his father... having taken up the scepter of the Russian tsardom&quot;. At his coronation, Feodor was also claimed to have said that his father gave him the title &quot;Tsar and Grand Prince, inheritor from his father and grandfather of the Russian tsardom&quot;.

Foreign sources like the account by Jerome Bowes described Feodor&#x27;s accession as normal and without any mention of a council. Another English source from Jerome Horsey described how the boyars &quot;were appointed to settle and dispose his [Ivan the Terrible&#x27;s] son Fyodor Ivanovich, having sworn one another, and all the nobility and officers whosoever&quot; before a &quot;parliament&quot; met on 4 May. However, both of the English reports were published soon after the events, and therefore may contain omissions due to political reasons, while the originals have not survived. Polish and Vatican reports mention the expectation of an election taking place, due to Feodor&#x27;s &quot;madness&quot;, but the letter of the emissary Lew Sapieha tells how the Russian &quot;pristav&quot; shared the story of Feodor sitting on the throne according to the blessing of his father. Pontus De la Gardie, the Swedish viceroy of Livonia, wrote a letter on 16 April to the viceroy of Novgorod about prolonging the truce between Sweden and Russia, because he had learned that the tsar had died and &quot;in his place they had elected as grand prince his son Fyodor to the rank of his father and crowned him&quot;. The answering letter did not correct the error about Feodor being elected and simply stated that &quot;with God’s help according to the blessing of his father, his son our sovereign tsar and grand prince Fyodor Ivanovich came to rule his states&quot;.
Feodor was only the nominal ruler: his wife&#x27;s brother and trusted minister Boris Godunov legitimized himself, after Ivan IV&#x27;s death, as the &quot;de facto&quot; regent for the weak and disabled Feodor. As a result, the government was mainly in the hands of the boyars and Feodor&#x27;s brother-in-law. By the summer of 1584, the two boyar clans had effected a rapprochement, and Luka Novosiltsev, the Russian ambassador to the Holy Roman Empire, referred to Godunov in November as &quot;the ruler of the land, a great and gracious lord&quot;. By the end of the 1580s, Boris Godunov was able to deal with foreign powers independently, using a variety of titles in addition to that of equerry, which he received in 1584. Feodor&#x27;s wife Irina also began to play a role in the affairs of the state, although it is not clear if she had any real political power. Three charters regarding grants to monasteries from 1587 to 1597 are in the name of both the tsar and tsaritsa.

In May 1586, the Shuyskys, backed by the metropolitan of the Russian Orthodox Church and the people of Moscow, organized a petition in the name of the &quot;Zemsky Sobor&quot; that was addressed to Feodor and urged him to divorce his wife, who was childless. Feodor rejected the preposition, and Godunov waited until the return of the Russian embassy from Poland on 1 October, where he may have received confirmation of his suspicions that the Shuyskys were in contact with Polish lords. In the autumn, the Shuyskys were banished from the capital and Boris Godunov persecuted them heavily in the following year. In addition, Metropolitan Dionysius was removed from his post. Although Boris Godunov focused on strengthening the autocracy like Feodor&#x27;s father, he was not opposed to the princely elite, and the composition of the duma was predominated by the highest-ranking boyar elite.

===Foreign policy===
Unlike his father, Feodor had no enthusiasm for maintaining exclusive trading rights with the Kingdom of England. Feodor declared his kingdom open to all foreigners, and dismissed the English ambassador Sir Jerome Bowes, whose pomposity had been tolerated by Feodor&#x27;s father. Elizabeth I sent a new ambassador, Giles Fletcher, the Elder, to demand of Boris Godunov that he convince the tsar to reconsider. The negotiations failed because Fletcher addressed Feodor with two of his titles omitted. Even after this setback, Elizabeth continued to address Feodor on that topic in half appealing, half reproachful letters. She proposed an alliance between Russia and England, something which she had refused to do when it had been sought by Feodor&#x27;s father, but he turned her down.

Some boyars may also have been interested in a Habsburg succession to the throne as early as 1584, which would have meant the election of one of the brothers of Rudolf II. As the Habsburg court was interested in preventing Polish expansion into Russia, discussions were held in Prague, and in 1589, a Habsburg envoy reported that Boris Godunov wanted Archduke Maximilian, who was a candidate for the Polish throne, to be Feodor&#x27;s successor. Andrey Shchelkalov, the head of the &quot;Posolsky prikaz&quot; (ambassadorial office), made a secret proposal to the Habsburg envoy in 1593 to have Feodor&#x27;s daughter Feodosiya married to one of the Habsburg princes; however, Feodosiya died and the proposal was no longer being considered.

==Death==

Feodor died on in Moscow. He was buried at the Archangel Cathedral in the Moscow Kremlin. Feodor produced no sons, despite his efforts to have children.

After the end of the 40-day period of mourning, the &quot;Zemsky Sobor&quot; convened and elected Boris Godunov as the new tsar. The traditional view among historians was that supporters of Godunov dominated the assembly; however, Vasily Klyuchevsky concluded that the assembly was entirely conventional in its composition at the time. Klyuchevsky argued that if there was a campaign in favor of Godunov, it did not alter the composition of the assembly, and thus Godunov was legitimately elected. On the other hand, contemporaries of the Time of Troubles viewed the election of Godunov as immoral due to his perceived role in the death of Tsarevich Dmitry of Uglich.

==Legacy==
Feodor&#x27;s failure to sire other children brought an end to the centuries-old central branch of the Rurik dynasty, although many princes of later times are descendants of Rurik as well. The termination of the dynasty would later result in the Time of Troubles. Paul Bushkovitch disagrees with the assumption by historians that the elections of tsars that took place after the death of Feodor was simply caused by the extinction of the Rurik dynasty, stating that from at least 1450, the succession of monarchs relied on the public designation of the tsar&#x27;s successor, rather than automatic primogeniture.

Contemporaries are unanimous that Feodor&#x27;s reign was a period of prosperity and stability in Russia, as the government secured peace for Russia&#x27;s borders, and the economic policy of the government led to a revival in the economy during the last decade of the century; however, much of the credit goes to Boris Godunov, who was called &quot;incomparable&quot; by the Russian envoys to Persia in reference to his intelligence and unique position in government.

The veneration of Feodor began shortly after his death and Patriarch Job composed the &quot;Tale of the Honorable Tsar and Grand Prince of all Russia Fedor Ivanovich&quot;. The tale says that Boris Godunov, who built a fort and within it a church dedicated to Sergius of Radonezh, stationed his army there in hopes of saving Moscow from &quot;pagan barbarians&quot;. Feodor prayed before an icon of the Mother of God, seeking intercession in the tradition of his ancestor Dmitry Donskoy, while Patriarch Job led a procession, parading the icon around Moscow and then to the Church of St. Sergius to appeal for divine help.

===In popular culture===
His reign was dramatised by Aleksey Konstantinovich Tolstoy in his verse drama &quot;Tsar Fyodor Ioannovich&quot; (1868).

==Family==

In 1575, Feodor married Irina Godunova, a sister of Ivan&#x27;s minister Boris Godunov. The exact date of the marriage is not known, but the evidence suggests that Feodor, along with his brother, were married by 5 March, and that their weddings probably took place shortly after their father&#x27;s wedding the same year. Daniel Prinz von Buchau, the ambassador of the Holy Roman Empire who was in Moscow from November 1575 to February 1576, wrote that &quot;both sons, the older one 20 years old and the younger one 18, both still without whiskers, entered into marriage with some or other daughters of boyars in the same year when we were there&quot;.

Although the marriage was arranged by the tsar and the couple knew nothing of each other before their wedding day, they went on to have a strong marriage. The lonely Feodor soon grew extremely close to his wife, to a degree that was unusual for that period and milieu. The two shared a relationship of warmth and trust which was the support of Feodor&#x27;s life for as long as he lived. He entrusted her to handle tsarist responsibilities, including signing decrees in his name.

Feodor and Irina&#x27;s marriage did not immediately produce children, and may not have even been consummated for some years. It was only in 1592, after almost twelve years of marriage and numerous attempts by the court to cure her perceived barrenness (at the time, the wife was always blamed for the infertility of a couple), that Tsaritsa Irina gave birth to a daughter, who was named Feodosiya (29 May 1592 – 25 January 1594) after her father. Feodor and his wife doted on their daughter, but she died aged two in 1594. There were no other children from the marriage. The boyar families rival to the Godunov clan attempted to convince Feodor to divorce and re-marry, but he always rejected the idea.

<text>Feodor II Borisovich Godunov (; 1589 – ) was Tsar of all Russia from April to June 1605, at the beginning of the Time of Troubles.

==Life==
Fyodor II was born in Moscow, the son and successor to Boris Godunov. His mother Maria Grigorievna Skuratova-Belskaya was one of the daughters of Malyuta Skuratov, the infamous favourite of Ivan the Terrible.


Physically robust and passionately beloved by his father, he received the best education available at that time, and from childhood was initiated into all the minutiae of government, besides sitting regularly in the council and receiving the foreign envoys. He seems also to have been remarkably and precociously intelligent, creating a map of Russia, which is still preserved. 
It was edited with some additions by Hessel Gerritsz in Amsterdam, in 1613, and had been reedited until 1665.

On the sudden death of Boris the sixteen-year-old was proclaimed tsar (13 April 1605). Though his father had taken the precaution to surround him with powerful friends, he lived from the first moment of his reign in an atmosphere of treachery. 
On 11 June (N. S.) 1605 the envoys of False Dmitriy I arrived at Moscow to demand his removal, and the letters that they read publicly in Red Square decided his fate. A group of boyars, unwilling to swear allegiance to the new tsar, seized control of the Kremlin and arrested him. 

On June 10 or 20, Feodor was strangled in his apartment, together with his mother. Officially, he was declared to have been poisoned, but the Swedish diplomat Peter Petreius stated that the bodies, which had been on public display, showed traces of a violent struggle. Although aged 16, Feodor was known to be physically strong and agile, and it took four men to overpower him.

<doc id="148201" wikidata="Q184868" url="?curid=148201" title="Feodor III of Russia">
<text>Feodor or Fyodor III Alekseyevich (; 9 June 1661 – 7 May 1682) was Tsar of all Russia from 1676 until his death in 1682. Despite poor health from childhood, he managed to pass reforms on improving meritocracy within the civil and military state administration as well as founding the Slavic Greek Latin Academy.

==Life==
Born in Moscow, Fyodor, as the eldest surviving son of Tsar Alexis and Maria Miloslavskaya, succeeded his father on the throne in 1676 at the age of fifteen. He had a fine intellect and a noble disposition; he had received an excellent education at the hands of Simeon Polotsky, the most learned Slavonic monk of the day. He knew Polish and even possessed the unusual accomplishment of Latin. He had been disabled from birth, however, horribly disfigured and half paralyzed by a mysterious disease, supposed to be scurvy. He spent most of his time with young nobles, and .

On 28 July 1680 he married a noblewoman, Agaphia Simeonovna Grushevskaya (1663–1681), daughter of Simeon Feodorovich Grushevsky and of his wife Maria Ivanovna Zaborovskaya, and assumed the sceptre. His native energy, though crippled, was not crushed by his disabilities. He soon showed himself as a thorough and devoted reformer. The atmosphere of the court ceased to be oppressive, the light of a new liberalism shone, and the severity of the penal laws was considerably mitigated. The Tsar founded the academy of sciences in the Zaikonospassky monastery, where competent professors were to teach everything not expressly forbidden by the Orthodox church – the syllabus included Slavonic, Greek, Latin and Polish.

The Feodorean and the later Petrine reforms differed in that while the former were primarily, though not exclusively, for the benefit of the church, the latter were primarily for the benefit of the state. A household census took place in 1678. The most notable reform of Feodor III, made at the suggestion of Vasily Galitzine, involved the abolition in 1682 of the system of &quot;mestnichestvo&quot;, or &quot;place priority&quot;, which had paralyzed the whole civil and military administration of Muscovy for generations. Henceforth all appointments to the civil and military services were to be determined by merit and by the will of the sovereign, while pedigree (nobility) books were to be destroyed.

==Family==
Fyodor&#x27;s first consort, Agaphia Simeonovna Grushevskaya, shared his progressive views. She was the first to advocate beard-shaving. On 11 July 1681, the Tsaritsa gave birth to her son, Tsarevich Ilya Fyodorovich, the expected heir to the throne. Agaphia died as a consequence of the childbirth three days later, on 14 July, and seven days later, on 21 July, the Tsarevich also died.

Seven months later, on 24 February 1682 Fyodor married a second time Marfa Apraksina (1667–1716), daughter of Matvei Vasilievich Apraksin and wife Domna Bogdanovna Lovchikova. Feodor was so weak that he could not stand at the wedding. Feodor died three months after his second wedding, on 7 May, without surviving issue. The news of his death sparked the Moscow Uprising of 1682.

<doc id="148203" wikidata="Q160227" url="?curid=148203" title="Peter II of Russia">
<text>Peter II Alexeyevich (23 October 1715 30 January 1730) was Emperor of Russia from 1727 until 1730, when he died at the age of 14. He was the only son of Tsarevich Alexei Petrovich and Charlotte Christine of Brunswick-Lüneburg. After Catherine I&#x27;s death, Alexander Menshikov controlled Peter II, but was thwarted by his opponents and exiled by Peter. Peter was also influenced by favorites like Prince Aleksey Dolgorukov, leading to a neglect of state affairs and the tightening of serfdom. Peter&#x27;s reign was marked by disengagement, disorder, and indulgence. He was engaged to Ekaterina Dolgorukova, but died suddenly of smallpox before the marriage, thus making him the last male agnatic member of the House of Romanov.

== Early life ==
Peter was born in Saint Petersburg on 23 (O.S. 12) October 1715. His father was the only living son of Peter the Great. His mother was well-connected to European royalty, and through her, Peter was a first cousin of Empress Maria Theresa of Austria. 

Peter&#x27;s mother died when he was only ten days old. His father, the tsarevich Alexei, accused of treason by his own father, Peter the Great, died in prison in 1718. So three-year-old Peter and his four-year-old sister, Natalya, became orphans. Their grandfather showed no interest in their upbringing or education: the Tsar had disliked their father and even their grandmother, his own first wife, and young Peter in particular reminded him of his only son Alexei, whom the Tsar suspected of treachery. Therefore, from his childhood, the young and orphaned Peter was kept in the strictest seclusion. His earliest governesses were the wives of a tailor and a vintner from the Dutch settlement, while a sailor named Norman taught him the rudiments of navigation. When he grew older, however, Peter was placed under the care of a Hungarian noble, Janos (Ivan) Zeikin (Zékány), who seems to have been a conscientious teacher.
Peter the Great died in 1725 and was succeeded by his second wife, Catherine I, a woman of low birth. The powerful minister Aleksander Danilovich Menshikov, who had aided in Catherine&#x27;s accession, replaced the boy&#x27;s teachers with the vice-chancellor, Count Ostermann. The program of education that Ostermann compiled included history, geography, mathematics, and foreign languages, but the overall education of the future emperor remained shallow and left much to be desired. Peter himself did not display much interest in study; his favorite occupations were hunting and feasting.

By the time Catherine I died in 1727, it had become clear to those in power that the only grandson of Peter the Great could not be kept from his inheritance much longer. The majority of Russians and three-quarters of the nobility (especially the old-established nobility) were on his side, while the Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI (the husband of Peter&#x27;s mother&#x27;s elder sister, Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel) persistently urged Peter&#x27;s claims through the imperial ambassador at Saint Petersburg. Through the efforts of Menshikov, the court named Peter as Catherine&#x27;s heir apparent, even though Catherine had two daughters of her own. The relevant documentation also specified the betrothal of Peter to Menshikov&#x27;s daughter Maria.

==Rule==

After Catherine&#x27;s death in May 1727 and the proclamation of the 11-year-old Peter II as emperor, Menshikov took the young autocrat into his own house on Vasilievsky Island and had full control over all of his actions. For a few months in the summer of 1727, &quot;[n]ot even Peter the Great was so feared or so obeyed&quot;, according to the Saxon ambassador. Menshikov became arrogant and domineering. He issued orders to the Emperor himself and then removed a silver plate that Peter had just given as a gift to his sister Natalya. To which the Emperor replied, &quot;We shall see who is emperor, you or I.&quot; Soon, however, Menshikov became sick, and his opponents took advantage of his illness. Under the influence of Ostermann and the Dolgorukovs, Peter – long sick of Menshikov&#x27;s wardship – stripped him of his rank (September 1727) and exiled him to Siberia. The Emperor also dissolved his engagement with Menshikov&#x27;s daughter.

The senate, the privy council and the guards took the oath of allegiance forthwith. At this time, German mathematician Christian Goldbach was appointed tutor to the young Peter II to take over from Andrey Osterman, whom Menshikov had appointed.

Peter II was quick-witted, but apparently a stubborn and wayward boy, much like his grandfather. Despite these similarities, the emperor had no desire to learn to rule, unlike Peter the Great. His young age meant that he could not adequately manage public affairs, and he almost never appeared at the Supreme Privy Council. This led to frustration among his subjects and in the imperial administration – officials did not dare to assume responsibility for important decisions. The Russian fleet became neglected, but Peter II showed no interest in the matter. Peter tightened serfdom by banning serfs from volunteering for military service and thus escaping their status.

With the fall of Menshikov and related court intrigues, the Emperor&#x27;s main favorites became Prince Aleksey Dolgorukov and his son Ivan, who maintained great influence over the Emperor&#x27;s decisions. According to contemporaries, Ivan Dolgorukov lived a reckless and profligate lifestyle, leading Peter II to spend much time feasting, playing cards and enjoying the company of women. He soon became addicted to alcohol.
The coronation of Peter II took place in Moscow on 9 January 1728, with the Emperor and a huge entourage. Still, he was disengaged from the affairs of state. Foreign witnesses proclaimed: &quot;All of Russia is in terrible disorder ... money is not paid to anyone. God knows what will happen with finances. Everyone steals, as much as he can.&quot; Moving the court and several other institutions from St. Petersburg back to Moscow (1728) was painful for the &quot;Northern Capital&quot;, as well as for the nobility forced to move with it, as Peter the Great had put much effort into developing St. Petersburg into a large and lively city.

Peter II returned to St. Petersburg from time to time, but continued to lead an aimless life full of entertainment and distraction. He gradually fell under the thorough-going influence of the Dolgorukovs, and became smitten with the 18-year-old beauty Ekaterina Alekseyevna Dolgorukova. The Dolgorukov family schemed to tie themselves to the imperial bloodline, and persuaded Peter to become engaged to marry Ekaterina. However, it soon became clear that the young monarch had no interest in his fiancee, perhaps influenced by his aunt Elizabeth Petrovna, who did not like Ekaterina. Planning for the wedding went forward regardless, set to take place on .
&quot;Peter II has not reached the age when a person&#x27;s personality has already shaped,&quot; historian Mykola Kostomarov wrote. &quot;While contemporaries praised his natural intelligence and good heart, they only hoped for that good to happen in the future. However, his behavior did not give chances to hope that he would be a good ruler. He hated learning and thinking about national affairs. He was totally engrossed in amusements, and was kept under someone else&#x27;s influence.&quot;

In late December 1729 Peter II fell dangerously ill. His condition deteriorated sharply after the frosty Epiphany Day (), when he participated in a feast. He was then rushed into the Lefortovo palace, standing at the back of his sleigh. The next day doctors diagnosed smallpox. The Dolgorukovs attempted to get the emperor to sign a testament naming Ekaterina as his heir, but they were not allowed into the dying emperor’s quarters: Peter II was already unconscious. In his delirium, he ordered horses so that he could visit his sister Natalya (who had died in 1728). A few minutes later, he died.

Emperor Peter II died as dawn broke on 30 January 1730 – the day scheduled for his marriage to Ekaterina Dolgorukova. He is buried in the Cathedral of the Archangel located at the Moscow Kremlin and was the only post-Petrine Russian monarch given that honor; along with Ivan VI (who was murdered and buried in the fortress of Shlisselburg), he is the only post-Petrine monarch not buried in the Peter and Paul Cathedral in Saint Petersburg.

With Peter&#x27;s death, the direct male line of the Romanov dynasty ended. He was succeeded on the Russian throne by his cousin Anna Ivanovna, daughter of Peter the Great&#x27;s half-brother and co-ruler, Ivan V.

<doc id="148205" wikidata="Q151781" url="?curid=148205" title="Ivan VI of Russia">
<text>Ivan VI Antonovich (; – ), also known as Ioann Antonovich, was Emperor of Russia from October 1740 until he was overthrown by his cousin Elizabeth Petrovna in December 1741. He was only two months old when he was proclaimed emperor and his mother, Anna Leopoldovna, named regent, but the throne was seized in a coup after little more than a year. Ivan and his parents were imprisoned far from the capital, and spent the rest of their lives in captivity.

After more than twenty years as a prisoner, Ivan was killed by his guards when some army officers (unknown to Ivan) attempted to free him. His surviving siblings, who had been born in prison, were then released into the custody of their aunt, the Danish queen dowager Juliana Maria of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel. They settled in Horsens, where they lived in comfort under house arrest for the rest of their lives.

== Emperor of Russia ==
Ivan was born on 23 August 1740 at Saint Petersburg, the eldest child of Duke Anthony Ulrich of Brunswick-Lüneburg by his wife, Duchess Anna Leopoldovna of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, the only niece of the childless Empress Anna of Russia, and the only granddaughter of Tsar Ivan V. She had lived in Russia almost all her life, and her husband had also made his home in that country, in the expectation that they or their progeny would inherit the throne upon the death of the empress.

This expectation was fulfilled within two months of the birth of their first child. On 5 October 1740 the infant Ivan was adopted by his grandaunt (who was on her deathbed) and declared her heir apparent. The empress also declared that her longtime lover and advisor, Ernst Johann von Biron, duke of Courland, would serve as regent until Ivan came of age. Indeed, the desire to ensure that her lover would enjoy power and influence after her death was the primary reason that the dying empress chose to name as her heir the infant rather than his mother.

Empress Anna died soon thereafter on 28 October 1740. The following day the infant was proclaimed emperor as Ivan VI, Autocrat of All The Russias, and Biron became regent. However, the idea of Biron wielding power was not acceptable either to Ivan&#x27;s parents or to most of the nobility. During his years as Anna&#x27;s lover he had made many enemies, and was tremendously unpopular at court. Within three weeks Ivan&#x27;s father had engineered Biron&#x27;s fall. At midnight on 18/19 November 1740 Biron was seized in his bedroom by partisans of the royal couple and banished to Siberia (he was later permitted to reside at Yaroslavl). Ivan&#x27;s mother, Anna Leopoldovna, was made regent, though the vice-chancellor, Andrei Osterman, effectively ran the government during her brief regency.

== Deposition and imprisonment ==
Ivan&#x27;s reign, and his mother&#x27;s regency, lasted thirteen months, for on 6 December 1741 a coup d&#x27;état placed Elizabeth of Russia on the throne, and Ivan and his family were imprisoned in the fortress of Dünamünde (13 December 1742) after a preliminary detention at Riga, from where the new Empress had at first intended to send the unhappy family home to Brunswick. In June 1744, following the Lopukhina Affair, the Empress transferred Ivan to Kholmogory on the White Sea where, isolated from his family and seeing no one other than his jailer, he remained for the next twelve years. When news of his confinement at Kholmogory circulated more widely, young Ivan was secretly transferred to the fortress of Shlisselburg (1756) where he was still more rigorously guarded, not even the commandant of the fortress knowing the true identity of &quot;a certain prisoner&quot;. Throughout Elizabeth&#x27;s reign her predecessor&#x27;s name was subjected to a &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot; procedure; all coins, documents, and publications bearing Ivan&#x27;s name and titles were systematically confiscated and destroyed, and are now an extraordinarily rare find.

Upon the accession of Peter III in 1762, Ivan&#x27;s situation seemed about to improve, for the new emperor visited him and sympathised with his plight, but Peter was deposed just a few months later. New instructions were sent to Ivan&#x27;s guardian to place manacles on his charge, and even to scourge him should he become unmanageable.

== Death ==

On the accession of Catherine II, in the summer of 1762, still more stringent orders were sent to the officer in charge of &quot;the nameless one&quot;; if any attempt were made from outside to release him, the prisoner was to be put to death. Under no circumstances was he to be delivered alive into anyone&#x27;s hands, without an express written order in the Empress&#x27;s handwriting. By this time twenty years of solitary confinement had disturbed Ivan&#x27;s mental equilibrium, though he does not seem to have been actually insane. Nevertheless, despite the mystery surrounding him, he was well aware of his imperial origin and always called himself &quot;Gosudar&quot; (Sovereign). Instructions had been given not to educate him, but he had been taught his letters and could read his Bible. Since his presence at Shlisselburg could not remain concealed forever, its eventual discovery was the cause of his demise.

A sub-lieutenant of the garrison, Vasily Mirovich, learned of his identity and formed a plan for freeing and proclaiming him Emperor. At midnight on 5 July 1764, Mirovich won over some of the garrison, arrested the commandant, Berednikov, and demanded the release of Ivan. His jailers, on orders of their commander, an officer surnamed Chekin, immediately murdered Ivan in compliance with the secret instructions already in their possession. Mirovich and his supporters were arrested and executed shortly thereafter. Ivan was buried quietly in the fortress, and his death secured Catherine II&#x27;s position on the throne until her own son came of age.

Ivan&#x27;s siblings, who were born in prison, were released into the custody of their aunt, the Danish-Norwegian queen dowager, Juliana Maria of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, on 30 June 1780 and settled at Horsens in Jutland. There, they lived under house arrest for the rest of their lives under Juliana&#x27;s guardianship and at Catherine&#x27;s expense. Although they were prisoners, they lived in relative comfort and retained a small &quot;court&quot; of forty to fifty people, all Danes except for the priest.

<doc id="148206" wikidata="Q15189" url="?curid=148206" title="Paul I of Russia">
<text>Paul I (; – ) was Emperor of Russia from 1796 until his assassination in 1801.

Paul remained overshadowed by his mother, Catherine the Great, for most of his life. He adopted the laws of succession to the Russian throne—rules that lasted until the end of the Romanov dynasty and of the Russian Empire. He also imposed the first limitations on serfdom with the Manifesto of three-day corvee, sought to curtail the privileges of the nobility, pursued various military reforms which were highly unpopular among officers and was known for his unpredictable behavior, all of which contributed to the conspiracy that would take his life.

In 1799 he brought Russia into the Second Coalition against Revolutionary France alongside Britain and Austria; the Russian forces achieved several victories at first but withdrew after facing setbacks. Paul then realigned Russia with France and led the creation of the Second League of Armed Neutrality to oppose Britain after Napoleon&#x27;s rise to power. Toward the end of his reign, he added Kartli and Kakheti in Eastern Georgia to the Russian Empire. He was planning a joint invasion of British India with the French before being killed in a fight with his own officers who were trying to force his abdication. He was succeeded by his son Alexander I.

He was &quot;de facto&quot; Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller from 1799 to 1801 and ordered the construction of a number of priories of the Order of Malta.

==Early years==
Paul was son of Emperor Peter III, nephew and anointed heir of the Empress Elizabeth (second-eldest daughter of Tsar Peter the Great), and his wife Catherine II, born Sophie of Anhalt-Zerbst, daughter of a minor German prince who married into the Russian Romanov dynasty. Catherine subsequently deposed Paul&#x27;s father, Peter III, to take the Russian throne and become Catherine the Great. While Catherine hinted in the first edition of her memoirs published by Alexander Herzen in 1859 that her lover Sergei Saltykov was Paul&#x27;s biological father, she later recanted and asserted in the final edition that Peter III was Paul&#x27;s true father. Simon Sebag Montefiore argues that while Paul&#x27;s true paternity is &quot;impossible to know [...] he did look and behave like Peter.&quot;

Paul was taken almost immediately after birth by the Empress Elizabeth, and had limited contact with his mother. As a boy, he was reported to be intelligent and good-looking, but sickly. His pug-nosed facial features in later life are attributed to an attack of typhus, from which he suffered in 1771. Paul was put in the charge of a trustworthy governor, Nikita Ivanovich Panin, and of competent tutors. Panin&#x27;s nephew went on to become one of Paul&#x27;s assassins. One of Paul&#x27;s tutors, Poroshin, complained that he was &quot;always in a hurry&quot;, acting and speaking without reflection.

==Under Catherine II==
Empress Elizabeth died in 1762, when Paul was eight years old, and he became crown prince with the accession of his father to the throne as Peter III. However, within a matter of months, Paul&#x27;s mother engineered a coup to depose her husband. Peter soon died in prison, either being killed by Catherine&#x27;s supporters or due to a fit of apoplexy when exerting himself in a dispute with Prince Feodor, one of his jailers. The 8-year-old Paul retained his position as Tsesarevich, or heir apparent.

In 1772, her son and heir, Paul, turned eighteen. Paul and his adviser, Panin, believed he was the rightful tsar of Russia, as the only son of Peter III. His adviser had also taught him that the rule of women endangered good leadership, which was why he was so interested in gaining the throne. Distracting him, Catherine took trouble to find Paul a wife among the minor princesses of the Holy Roman Empire. She chose Princess Wilhelmina of Hesse-Darmstadt, who acquired the Russian name &quot;Natalia Alexeievna&quot;, a daughter of Ludwig IX, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt. The bride&#x27;s older sister, Frederika Louisa, was already married to the Crown Prince of Prussia. Around this time, Catherine allowed Paul to attend the council in order that he might be trained for his work as Emperor. Wilhelmina and their child died in childbirth on 15 April 1776, three years after the wedding. It soon became even clearer to Catherine that Paul wanted power, including his separate court. There was talk of having both Paul and his mother co-rule Russia, but Catherine narrowly avoided it. A fierce rivalry began between them, as Catherine knew she could never truly trust her son, as his claim to the throne was superior to hers. Paul coveted his mother&#x27;s position, and by the laws of succession prevalent then, it was rightfully his.

After her daughter-in-law&#x27;s death, Catherine began work forthwith on the project of finding another wife for Paul, and on 7 October 1776, less than six months after the death of his first wife and their child, Paul married again. The bride was the beautiful Sophia Dorothea of Württemberg, who received the new Russian name Maria Feodorovna. Their first child, Alexander, was born in 1777, within a year of the wedding, and on this occasion the Empress gave Paul an estate, Pavlovsk. Paul and his wife gained leave to travel through western Europe in 1781–1782. In 1783, the Empress granted him another estate, Gatchina Palace, where he was allowed to maintain a brigade of soldiers whom he drilled on the Prussian model, an unpopular stance at the time.

===Relationship with Catherine the Great===
Catherine and her son and heir Paul maintained a distant relationship throughout her reign. Empress Elizabeth had taken up the child and proved an obsessive but incapable caretaker, as she had not raised children of her own. Paul was supervised by a variety of caregivers. Roderick McGrew briefly relates the neglect to which the infant heir was sometimes subject: &quot;On one occasion he fell out of his crib and slept the night away unnoticed on the floor.&quot; Even after Elizabeth&#x27;s death, relations with Catherine hardly improved. Paul was often jealous of the favours she would shower upon her lovers. In one instance, the empress gave to one of her favourites 50,000 rubles on her birthday, while Paul received a cheap watch. Paul&#x27;s early isolation from his mother created a distance between them that later events would reinforce. She never considered inviting him to share power in governing Russia. Once Paul&#x27;s son Alexander was born, it appeared that she had found a more suitable heir. The use made of his name by the rebel Yemelyan Pugachev, who impersonated his father Peter, tended no doubt to render Paul&#x27;s position more difficult.

Catherine&#x27;s absolute power and the delicate balance of courtier status greatly influenced the relationship at Court with Paul, who openly disregarded his mother&#x27;s opinions. Paul adamantly protested his mother&#x27;s policies, writing a veiled criticism in his &quot;Reflections&quot;, a dissertation on military reform. In it he directly disparaged expansionist warfare in favour of a more defensive military policy. Unenthusiastically received by his mother, the &quot;Reflections&quot; questioned her authority and added weight to her suspicion of an internal conspiracy with Paul at its centre. For a courtier to have openly supported or shown intimacy towards Paul, especially following this publication, would have meant political suicide.

Paul spent the following years away from the Imperial Court, content to remain at his private estates at Gatchina Palace with his growing family and perform Prussian drill exercises. As Catherine grew older, she became less concerned that her son attend court functions; her attentions focused primarily on the future Emperor Alexander I.

It was not until 1787 that Catherine may have in fact decided to exclude her son from succession. After Alexander and his brother Constantine were born, she had them placed under her charge, just as Elizabeth had done with Paul. That Catherine grew to favour Alexander as successor rather than Paul is unsurprising. She met secretly with Alexander&#x27;s tutor, Frédéric-César de La Harpe, to discuss his pupil&#x27;s ascension, and attempted to convince Alexander&#x27;s mother Maria to sign a proposal authorizing her son&#x27;s legitimacy. Both efforts proved fruitless, and though Alexander agreed to his grandmother&#x27;s wishes, he remained respectful of his father&#x27;s position as immediate successor to the Russian throne.

==Accession to the throne==
Catherine suffered a stroke on 17 November 1796, and died without regaining consciousness. Paul&#x27;s first act as Emperor was to inquire about and, if possible, destroy her testament, as he feared it would exclude him from succession and leave the throne to Alexander. These fears may have contributed to Paul&#x27;s promulgation of the Pauline Laws, which established the strict principle of primogeniture in the House of Romanov, leaving the throne to the next male heir.

The army, then poised to attack Persia in accordance with Catherine&#x27;s last design, was recalled to the capital within one month of Paul&#x27;s accession. In a remarkable poem, the Russian court poet Derzhavin commented bitterly on the inglorious return from that expedition of its commander Count Valerian Zubov, who was the youthful brother of Prince Platon Zubov, the lover of the Empress Саtherine.

Upon his death in 1762, Peter III had been buried without any honors in the Annunciation Church at the Alexander Nevsky Monastery in St. Petersburg. Immediately after the death of his mother, Paul ordered his father&#x27;s remains transferred, first to the church in the Winter Palace and then to the Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral, Saint Petersburg, the burial site of the Romanovs. 60-year-old Count Alexei Orlov, who had played a role in deposing Peter III and possibly also in his death, was made to walk in the funeral cortege, holding the Imperial Crown of Russia as he walked in front of Peter&#x27;s coffin. Peter III had never been crowned so at the time of his reburial, Paul personally performed the ritual of coronation on his remains. Paul responded to the rumour of his illegitimacy by parading his descent from Peter the Great. The inscription on the monument to the first Emperor of Russia near the St. Michael&#x27;s Castle reads in Russian &quot;To the Great-Grandfather from the Great-Grandson&quot;. This is an allusion to the Latin &quot;PETRO PRIMO CATHARINA SECUNDA&quot;, the dedication by Catherine on the &#x27;Bronze Horseman&#x27; statue of Peter the Great.

==Purported eccentricities==
Paul was idealistic and capable of great generosity, but he was also mercurial and capable of vindictiveness. In spite of doubts of his legitimacy, he greatly resembled his father, Peter III, and other Romanovs as well and shared the same character. During the first year of his reign, Paul emphatically reversed many of his mother&#x27;s policies. Although he accused many of Jacobinism, he allowed Catherine&#x27;s best known critic, Alexander Radishchev, to return from Siberian exile. Besides Radishchev, he liberated Nikolay Novikov from Schlüsselburg fortress, and also Tadeusz Kościuszko, yet after liberation both were confined to their own estates under police supervision. He viewed the Russian nobility as decadent and corrupt, and was determined to transform them into a disciplined, principled, loyal caste resembling a medieval chivalric order. To those few who conformed to his view of a modern-day knight (e.g., his favourites Mikhail Kutuzov, Aleksey Arakcheyev, and Feodor Rostopchin) he granted more serfs during the five years of his reign than his mother had presented to her lovers during her thirty-four years. Those who did not share his chivalric views were dismissed or lost their places at court: seven field marshals and 333 generals fell into this category.

Paul made several idiosyncratic and deeply unpopular attempts to reform the Imperial Russian Army. Under Catherine&#x27;s reign, Grigori Potemkin introduced new uniforms that were cheap, comfortable, practical and designed in a distinctly Russian style. Paul decided to fulfill his father Peter III&#x27;s intention of introducing Prussian uniforms. Impractical for active duty, these were deeply unpopular with the men, as was the effort required to maintain them.

His love of parades and ceremony was not well-liked either. He ordered that &quot;Wachtparad&quot; (&quot;Watch parades&quot;) take place early every morning in the parade ground of the palace, regardless of the weather conditions. He would personally sentence soldiers to be flogged if they made a mistake, and on one occasion ordered a Guards regiment to march to Siberia after they became disordered during maneuvers, although he changed his mind after they had walked about . He attempted to reform the organization of the army in 1796 by introducing &quot;The Infantry Codes&quot;, a series of guidelines for the army based largely upon show and glamour. But his greatest commander, Alexander Suvorov, completely ignored them, believing them to be worthless. At great expense, he built three palaces in or around the Russian capital. Much was made of his courtly love affair with Anna Lopukhina.

Emperor Paul also ordered the bones of Grigori Potemkin, the famed military commander and one of his mother&#x27;s lovers, dug out of his grave and scattered.

==Foreign affairs==
Paul&#x27;s early foreign policy can largely be seen as reactions against his mother&#x27;s. In foreign policy, this meant that he opposed the many expansionary wars she fought and instead preferred to pursue a more peaceful, diplomatic path. Immediately upon taking the throne, he recalled all troops outside Russian borders, including the struggling expedition Catherine II had sent to conquer Qajar Iran through the Caucasus and the 60,000 men she had promised to Britain and Austria to help them defeat the French. Paul hated the French before their revolution, and afterwards, with their republican and anti-religious views, he detested them even more. In addition to this, he knew French expansion hurt Russian interests, but he recalled his mother&#x27;s troops primarily because he firmly opposed wars of expansion. He also believed that Russia needed substantial governmental and military reforms to avoid an economic collapse and a revolution, before Russia could wage war on foreign soil.

Paul offered to mediate between Austria and France through Prussia and pushed Austria to make peace, but the two countries made peace without his assistance, signing the Treaty of Campoformio in October 1797. This treaty, with its affirmation of French control over islands in the Mediterranean and the partitioning of the Republic of Venice, upset Paul, who saw it as creating more instability in the region and displaying France&#x27;s ambitions in the Mediterranean. In response, he offered asylum to the Prince of Condé and his army, as well as the future Louis XVIII, both of whom had been forced out of Austria by the treaty. By this point, the French Republic had seized Italy, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, establishing republics with constitutions in each, and Paul felt that Russia now needed to play an active role in Europe in order to overthrow what the republic had created and restore traditional authorities. In this goal he found a willing ally in the Austrian chancellor Baron Thugut, who hated the French and loudly criticized revolutionary principles. Britain and the Ottoman Empire joined Austria and Russia to stop French expansion, free territories under their control and re-establish the old monarchies. The only major power in Europe who did not join Paul in his anti-French campaign was Prussia, whose distrust of Austria and the security they got from their current relationship with France prevented them from joining the Second Coalition. Despite the Prussians’ reluctance, Paul decided to move ahead with the war, promising 60,000 men to support Austria in Italy and 45,000 men to help Britain in North Germany and the Netherlands.

Another important factor in Paul&#x27;s decision to go to war with France was the island of Malta, the home of the Knights Hospitaller. In addition to Malta, the Order had priories in the Catholic countries of Europe that held large estates and paid the revenue from them to the Order. In 1796, the Order approached Paul about the Priory of Poland, which had been in a state of neglect and paid no revenue for 100 years, and was now on Russian land. Paul as a child had read the histories of the Order and was impressed by their honor and connection to the old order it represented. He relocated the Priories of Poland to St. Petersburg in January 1797. The knights responded by making him a protector of the Order in August of that same year, an honour he had not expected but, in keeping with his chivalric ideals, he happily accepted.

In June 1798, Napoleon seized Malta; this greatly offended Paul. In September, the Priory of St. Petersburg declared that Grand Master Hompesch had betrayed the Order by selling Malta to Napoleon. A month later the Priory elected Paul Grand Master on 24 November 1798, according to the 1847 edition of the &quot;Glossary of Heraldry&quot;. This election resulted in the establishment of the Russian tradition of the Knights Hospitaller within the Imperial Orders of Russia. The election of the sovereign of an Orthodox nation as the head of a Catholic order was controversial, and it was some time before the Holy See or any of the Order&#x27;s other priories approved it. This delay created political issues between Paul, who insisted on defending his legitimacy, and the priories’ respective countries. Though recognition of Paul&#x27;s election would become a more divisive issue later in his reign, the election immediately gave Paul, as Grand Master of the Order, another reason to fight the French Republic: to reclaim the Order&#x27;s ancestral home.

The Russian army in Italy played the role of an auxiliary force sent to support the Austrians, though the Austrians offered the position of chief commander over all the allied armies to Alexander Suvorov, a distinguished Russian general. Under Suvorov, the allies managed to push the French out of Italy, though they suffered heavy losses. However, by this point in time, cracks had started to appear in the Russo-Austrian alliance, due to their different goals in Italy. While Paul and Suvorov wanted the liberation and restoration of the Italian monarchies, the Austrians sought territorial acquisitions in Italy, and were willing to sacrifice later Russian support to acquire them. The Austrians, therefore, happily saw Suvorov and his army out of Italy in 1799 to go meet up with the army of Alexander Korsakov, at the time assisting the Austrian Archduke Charles to expel the French armies currently occupying Switzerland. However, the campaign in Switzerland had become a stalemate, without much activity on either side until the Austrians withdrew. Because this happened before Korsakov and Suvorov could unite their forces, the French could attack their armies one at a time, destroying Korsakov&#x27;s and forcing Suvorov to fight his way out of Switzerland, suffering heavy losses. Suvorov, shamed, blamed the Austrians for the terrible defeat in Switzerland, as did his furious sovereign. This defeat, combined with Austria&#x27;s refusal to reinstate the old monarchies in Italy and their disrespect of the Russian flag during the taking of Ancona, led to the formal cessation of the alliance in October 1799.

Although by the fall of 1799 the Russo-Austrian alliance had more or less fallen apart, Paul still cooperated willingly with the British. Together, they planned to invade the Netherlands, and through that country attack France proper. Unlike Austria, neither Russia nor Britain appeared to have any secret territorial ambitions: they both simply sought to defeat the French.

The Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland started well, with a British victory – the Battle of Callantsoog (27 August 1799) – in the north, but when the Russian army arrived in September, the allies found themselves faced with bad weather, poor coordination, and unexpectedly fierce resistance from the Dutch and the French, and their success evaporated. As the month wore on, the weather worsened and the allies suffered more and more losses, eventually signing an armistice in October 1799. The Russians suffered three-quarters of allied losses and the British left the Russian troops on the Isle of Wight in the Channel after the retreat, as it was illegal for foreign troops to enter Britain. This defeat and subsequent maltreating of Russian troops strained Russo-British relations, but a definitive break did not occur until later. The reasons for this break are less clear and simple than those of the split with Austria, but several key events occurred over the winter of 1799–1800 that helped: Bonaparte released 7,000 captive Russian troops that Britain had refused to pay the ransom for; Paul grew closer to the Scandinavian countries of Denmark-Norway and Sweden, whose claim to neutral shipping rights offended Britain; Paul had the British ambassador in St. Petersburg (Whitworth) recalled (1800) and Britain did not replace him, without any clear reason given as to why; and Britain, needing to choose between their two allies, chose Austria, who had with certainty committed to fighting the French to the end.

Finally, two events occurred in rapid succession that destroyed the alliance completely: first, in July 1800, the British seized a Danish frigate, prompting Paul to close the British trading factories in St. Petersburg as well as impound British ships and cargo; second, even though the allies resolved this crisis, Paul could not forgive the British for Admiral Nelson&#x27;s refusal to return Malta to the Order of St. John, and therefore to Paul, when the British captured it from the French in September 1800. In a drastic response, Paul seized all British vessels in Russian ports, sent their crews to detention camps and took British traders hostage until he received satisfaction. Over the next winter, he went further, using his new Armed Neutrality coalition with Sweden, Denmark and Prussia to prepare the Baltic against possible British attack, prevent the British from searching neutral merchant vessels, and freeze all British trade in Northern Europe. As France had already closed all of Western and Southern Europe to British trade, Britain, which relied heavily upon imports (especially for timber, naval products, and grain) felt seriously threatened by Paul&#x27;s move and reacted fast. In March 1801, Britain sent a fleet to Denmark, bombarding Copenhagen and forcing the Danes to surrender in the beginning of April. Nelson then sailed towards St. Petersburg, reaching Reval (14 May 1801), but after the conspiracy assassinated Paul (23 March 1801), the new Tsar Alexander opened peace-negotiations shortly after taking the throne.

The most original aspect of Paul I&#x27;s foreign policy was his rapprochement with France after the coalition fell apart. Several scholars have argued that this change in position, radical though it seemed, made sense, as Bonaparte became First Consul and made France a more conservative state, consistent with Paul&#x27;s view of the world. Paul also decided to send a Cossack army to take British India, as Britain itself was almost impervious to direct attack, being an island nation with a formidable navy, but the British had left India largely unguarded and would have great difficulty staving off a force that came over land to attack it. The British themselves considered this enough of a problem that they signed three treaties with Persia, in 1801, 1809 and 1812, to guard against an army attacking India through Central Asia. Paul sought to attack the British where they were weakest: through their commerce and their colonies. Throughout his reign, his policies focused reestablishing peace and the balance of power in Europe, while supporting autocracy and old monarchies, without seeking to expand Russia&#x27;s borders.

===Irano-Georgian matters===


In lieu of Russia&#x27;s failure to honour the terms of the Treaty of Georgievsk, Qajar Iran reinvaded Georgia. Georgian rulers felt they had nowhere else to turn now as Georgia was again re-subjugated by Iran. Tbilisi was captured and burnt to the ground, and eastern Georgia reconquered. However, Agha Mohammad Khan, Persia&#x27;s ruler, was assassinated in 1797 in Shusha, after which the Persian grip on Georgia softened again. Erekle, King of Kartli-Kakheti, still dreaming of a united Georgia, died a year later. After his death, a civil war broke out over the succession to the throne of Kartli-Kakheti, and one of the rival candidates called on Russia to intervene and decide matters. On 8 January 1801, Tsar Paul I signed a decree on the incorporation of Georgia (Kartli-Kakheti) within the Russian Empire, which was confirmed by Tsar Alexander I on 12 September 1801. The Georgian envoy in Saint Petersburg, Garsevan Chavchavadze, reacted with a note of protest that was presented to the Russian vice-chancellor Alexander Kurakin. In May 1801, after Paul&#x27;s death, Russian General Carl Heinrich von Knorring removed the Georgian heir to the throne, David Batonishvili, from power and deployed a provisional government headed by General Ivan Petrovich Lazarev.

==Assassination==
Paul&#x27;s premonitions of assassination were well-founded. His attempts to force the nobility to adopt a code of chivalry alienated many of his trusted advisors. The Emperor also discovered outrageous machinations and corruption in the Russian treasury. 

A conspiracy was organized, some months before it was executed, by Counts Peter Ludwig von der Pahlen, Nikita Petrovich Panin, and Admiral de Ribas, with the alleged support of the British ambassador in Saint Petersburg, Charles Whitworth.

The death of de Ribas in December 1800 delayed the assassination; but, on the night of , a band of dismissed officers murdered Paul at the newly completed palace of Saint Michael&#x27;s Castle. The assassins included General Levin August, Count von Bennigsen, a Hanoverian in the Russian service; and General Vladimir Mikhailovich Yashvil, a Georgian. They charged into Paul&#x27;s bedroom, flushed with drink after dining together, and found the emperor hiding behind some drapes in the corner. The conspirators pulled him out, forced him to the table, and tried to compel him to sign his abdication. Paul offered some resistance, and Nikolay Zubov struck him with a sword, after which the assassins strangled and trampled him to death. Paul&#x27;s successor on the Russian throne, his 23-year-old son Alexander, was actually in the palace at the time of the killing; he had &quot;given his consent to the overthrow of Paul, but had not supposed that this would be carried out by means of assassination&quot;. Zubov announced his accession to the heir, accompanied by the admonition, &quot;Time to grow up! Go and rule!&quot; Alexander I did not punish the assassins, and the court physician, James Wylie, declared apoplexy the official cause of death.

==Legacy==
There is some evidence that Paul I was venerated as a saint among the Russian Orthodox populace, even though he was never officially canonized by any of the Orthodox Churches.

===Portrayals in popular culture===
* In 1906, Dmitry Merezhkovsky published his tragedy &quot;Paul I&quot;; the most prominent performance of which was made on the Soviet Army Theatre&#x27;s stage in 1989, with Oleg Borisov as Paul.
* &quot;The Patriot&quot; (1928 film), directed by Ernst Lubitsch, is a biopic starring Emil Jannings as Paul. It won the Best Writing Oscar at the 2nd Academy Awards. It is now mostly lost, with about one-third of the film preserved in archives.
* The Soviet film &quot;Lieutenant Kijé&quot; (1937), directed by Aleksandr Faintsimmer and based on a novella of the same name by Yury Tynyanov, satirizes Paul&#x27;s obsession with rigid drill, instant obedience, and martinet discipline.
* In Sartre&#x27;s novel &quot;Nausea&quot; (1938), Marquis de Rollebon, a fictional character being studied by the protagonist Antoine Roquentin, is implicit in Paul I&#x27;s assassination.
* The Soviet experimental film &quot;Assa&quot; (1987) has a subplot revolving around Paul&#x27;s murder; Paul is portrayed by .

<text>Thomas Ball (June 3, 1819 – December 11, 1911) was an American sculptor and musician. His work has had a marked influence on monumental art in the United States, especially in New England.

==Life==
He was born in Charlestown, Massachusetts, to Thomas Ball, a house and sign painter, and Elizabeth Wyer Hall. His father died when he was twelve. After several odd jobs to help support his family, he spent three years working at the New England Museum, the precursor to the Boston Museum. There, he entertained the visitors by drawing portraits, playing the violin, singing, and repairing mechanical toys. He then became an apprentice for the museum wood-carver Abel Brown. He taught himself oil painting by copying prints and casts in the studio of the museum superintendent.

His earliest work was a bust of Jenny Lind, whom he saw on her 1850 tour of the United States. Copies of his Lind work and his bust of Daniel Webster sold widely before being widely copied by others. His work includes many early cabinet busts of musicians. His first statue of a figure was a two-foot high statue of Daniel Webster, on which he worked from photographs and engravings until he managed to see him pass his studio shortly before his death. At thirty-five, in 1854, he travelled to Florence to study.

===Musician===
Ball was an accomplished musician from his teenage years, working as a paid singer in Boston churches. He performed as an unpaid soloist with the Handel and Haydn Society beginning in 1846 and with that organization, sang the title role in the first United States performance of Mendelssohn&#x27;s &quot;Elijah&quot;, and the baritone solos in Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Moses in Egypt&quot;. On a visit to Boston years later, he performed the baritone role in Boston&#x27;s first performance of Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony with the Germania Orchestra on April 2, 1853.

===Painter===

As commissions started to come in, he moved from studio to studio until he settled in a studio in Tremont Row in Boston, where he remained for twelve years. There, he painted several religious pictures and a portrait of Cornelia Wells (Walter) Richards, editor of the &quot;Boston Evening Transcript&quot;. He then turned his attention back to sculpture.

=== Sculptor ===

He stayed in Boston until 1865 when he returned to Florence to stay there until 1897 as a member of an artistic colony that included Robert and Elizabeth Barrett Browning and Hiram Powers. Notables he met in Europe included Franz Liszt, whom he met at the Vatican in 1865 and of whom he produced a portrait bust.

He made it a practice never to attend the unveiling of his public works. In Boston, he managed to avoid receiving the invitation to the ceremonial dedication of his statue of Governor John Albion Andrew. Instead, he saw the work later, viewing it from different angles. He later wrote: &quot;It was a mean thing to do. I am ashamed of it now, but I could not bring myself to stand on that platform and face the multitude.&quot;

Dartmouth College awarded him an honorary Master of Arts degree. When he returned to America, he lived in Montclair, New Jersey, while keeping a studio in New York City.

In 1880, Ball published an autobiographical volume, &quot;My Threescore Years&quot;, which he updated in 1890 as &quot;My Three Score Years and Ten&quot;. He died at the Montclair home of his daughter, Eliza Chickering Ball, and son-in-law, sculptor William Couper.

The monument was created at Ball&#x27;s studio in Florence, Italy. His son-in-law, William Couper, assisted in modeling the figures. It was exhibited at the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition before being installed in Methuen, Massachusetts, and dedicated on February 22, 1900.

<text>Miguel Bosé (born Luis Miguel Dominguín Bosé; 3 April 1956) is a Spanish-Italian pop singer and actor.

==Early life==
Bosé was born in San Fernando Hospital in Panama City, Panama, the son of Italian actress Lucia Bosè (1931–2020) and Spanish bullfighter Luis Miguel Dominguín. Bosé grew up surrounded by art and culture: Pablo Picasso and Ernest Hemingway were close friends of the family. The film director Luchino Visconti was his godfather while Pablo Picasso was the godfather to his sister Paola Dominguín.

==Career==
Propelled by his famous family and their friends, Bosé started a career as an actor in 1971, taking part in various movies. He quickly found work on the basis of his talent and good looks rather than his family name. He studied acting as well as dancing and singing. Due to the lack of acting opportunities, he started exploring his talents as a singer in 1975. With the assistance of Camilo Sesto he recorded his first singles. Two years later, in 1977, Bosé signed a contract with CBS Records and he remained with them until 1984. With them he published his first album, &quot;Linda&quot;, which included his first hit single, titled in the same way. Between 1977 and 1982, Bosè was a major teen idol in Italy, Spain, Southern Europe and in all Latin America. He had 7 top ten hits that earned him a secure spot in every televised song festival held in the aforementioned countries. By 1983 his star had severely waned in Italy, and he rarely performed there again until the 90s, retreating to Latin American markets instead.

From 1983 to 1985, he participated in the &quot;Llena Tu Cabeza De Rock&quot; television specials on Puerto Rican WAPA-TV. In 1984 Miguel Bosé radically changed his style, focusing on a more adult audience. That year he published his album &quot;Bandido&quot;, which reflects that personal evolution towards maturity and includes songs like &quot;Sevilla&quot; or &quot;Amante bandido&quot;. With this song, he topped the charts in Spain and Latin America. The video to that song also became one of the most widely seen Spanish music videos, with Bose playing both a Superman style superhero and an Indiana Jones type of adventurer. The album cover featured Bosé looking similar to David Bowie on his album &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot;.
In Italy, where he had a parallel career singing in both Italian and English, his greatest success would be in 1994 by winning Festivalbar, the second largest musical event (after the Sanremo Music Festival), for the third time.

===2007: Papito===

On 20 March 2007, to celebrate his 30 years as a singer, he released &quot;Papito&quot;, an album that contains remakes of his previous songs as duets with Juanes, Alejandro Sanz, Fangoria, Ivete Sangalo, Laura Pausini, Shakira, Julieta Venegas, Ricky Martin, Amaia Montero (past member of the Spanish band La Oreja de Van Gogh), Michael Stipe, along with many other singers. Three singles were released off &quot;Papito&quot;: the first is a re-make of his hit &quot;Nena&quot;, featuring Mexican superstar Paulina Rubio; the second was &quot;Morena Mía&quot;, with Mexican-American pop diva Julieta Venegas. The third single &quot;Como un lobo&quot; featured his niece Bimba Bosé. &quot;Nena&quot; was by far the most successful single off the album. It was nominated for a Latin Grammy for best song and became the best selling download of Spain in 2007. In the same year, Bosé was awarded the Billboard Latin Music Lifetime Achievement Award.

In 2008, Colombian President Álvaro Uribe offered him Colombian citizenship because of his efforts towards peace in Colombia, including his participation in two concerts in 2008. On 16 March 2010 he received Colombian citizenship during a ceremony in the presidential palace, Casa de Nariño.

=== 2012–2015: Papitwo ===

After several &quot;hints&quot; on Twitter, on 4 September 2012 he released the album &quot;Papitwo&quot;, a follow-up to his successful &quot;Papito&quot;. The album contained additional remakes of well-known songs from his career, again featuring artists such as Juanes on &quot;Partisano&quot;, Bimba Bosé on &quot;Shoot Me in the Back&quot; and Alejandro Sanz on &quot;Te Comería El Corazón&quot;. It also included new collaborations with singers such as Pablo Alborán on &quot;Puede Que&quot;, Juan Luis Guerra on &quot;Creo En Ti&quot;, Tiziano Ferro on &quot;Amiga&quot;, Jovanotti on &quot;Mirarte&quot;, Malú on his first hit &quot;Linda&quot; (first single in Spain), Joaquín Sabina on &quot;Sol Forastero&quot;, Ximena Sariñana on &quot;Aire Soy&quot; (first single in the Americas) and Dani Martín on &quot;Te Digo Amor&quot;, among others. The Hollywood actress Penélope Cruz collaborated on the unreleased song &quot;Decirnos Adiós&quot;, composed by her brother for Bosé.

The album has two versions, a single disc with 14 previous hits remade with different artists and a deluxe one, with another CD containing 14 collaborations that Bosé made with singers during his career, including Hombres G on &quot;Lo Noto&quot;, Raphael on &quot;Morir de Amor&quot;, Natalia Lafourcade on &quot;Si No Pueden Quererte&quot;, Spanknox on &quot;Wrong in the Right Way&quot;, among others.

The album was released to coincide with Bosé&#x27;s &quot;Papitwo&quot; Tour, which started in Madrid.

Miguel Bosé was honoured as the Latin Recording Academy Person of the Year on 20 November 2013.

=== 2016–present: &quot;Bosé MTV Unplugged&quot; ===
On 7 October 2016 he released &quot;Bosé MTV Unplugged&quot;, a live album that contains remakes of his previous songs as duets with Sasha Sokol, Pablo Alborán, Marco Antonio Solís, Fonseca, along with many other singers. Four singles were released off &quot;Bosé MTV Unplugged&quot;: the first &quot;Bambú&quot;, featuring Fonseca; the second was &quot;Gulliver&quot;, with Mexican singer Natalia Lafourcade. The third single &quot;Olvídame tú&quot; with Marco Antonio Solís. &quot;Estaré&quot;, was released as the fourth single from the album on 7 February 2017.

On 20 February 2018 Miguel Bosé performed in the 2018 Viña del Mar International Song Festival, to a sold-out audience. Bosé performed &quot;Si Tú No Vuelves&quot; with American duo Ha*Ash. On 6 December 2019 Bosé featured on Ha*Ash&#x27;s single &quot;Si Tú No Vuelves&quot; from the duo&#x27;s &quot;Ha*Ash: En Vivo&quot; album.

==Personal life==
In 1980, Bosé declared himself to be bisexual, &quot;but not homosexual&quot;. Years later, he identified as &quot;trisexual&quot;. He was in a long-term relationship with sculptor Ignacio Palau from 1992 to 2018. In 2011, Bosé&#x27;s twins Diego and Tadeo were born via surrogacy. Seven months later, Ivo and Telmo were born through the same method with Palau&#x27;s biological gene.

On 23 January 2017, Bosé lost his niece Bimba Bosé to cancer.

During the COVID-19 pandemic Bosé became one of the most active denialists of the pandemic, questioning the effectiveness of masks and other aspects of the virus. Some of his videos were removed from YouTube and Facebook.

<text>The prions () or whalebirds are small petrels in the genera &quot;Pachyptila&quot; and &quot;Halobaena&quot;. They form one of the four groups within the Procellariidae along with the gadfly petrels, shearwaters and fulmarine petrels. The name comes from the Greek &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;saw&quot;, a reference of the serrated edges of the birds&#x27; saw-like bill.

They are found in the Southern Ocean and breed on a number of subantarctic islands. Prions grow long, and have blue-grey upper parts and white underparts. Three species of prion have flattened bills with a fringe of lamellae that act as strainers for zooplankton. All prions are marine and feed on small crustacea such as copepods, ostracods, decapods, and krill, as well as some fish such as myctophids and nototheniids.

==List of species==

* &quot;Pachyptila&quot;
** &quot;Pachyptila turtur&quot;, fairy prion
** &quot;Pachyptila belcheri&quot;, slender-billed prion
** &quot;Pachyptila crassirostris&quot;, fulmar prion
** &quot;Pachyptila vittata&quot;, broad-billed prion
** &quot;Pachyptila desolata&quot;, Antarctic prion
** &quot;Pachyptila salvini&quot;, Salvin&#x27;s prion
** &quot;Pachyptila macgillivrayi&quot;, MacGillivray&#x27;s prion

* &quot;Halobaena&quot;
** &quot;Halobaena caerulea&quot;, blue petrel

In addition, fossil remains of some hitherto undescribed prehistoric species have been found. The oldest comes from the Late Miocene (Tortonian, some 7 to 12 million years ago) of the Bahía Inglesa Formation in Chile.

<text>The minister-president of the Brussels Capital-Region (; ) leads the government of the Brussels-Capital Region of Belgium. The post is appointed for five years along with four ministers and three &quot;state&quot; secretaries. While being the leader of the Brussels Government, the minister-president also is the president of the college of the Common Community Commission.

The minister-president of the Brussels-Capital Region should not be confused with either the Governor of Brussels-Capital nor with the mayor of the City of Brussels, which is one of the 19 municipalities of Brussels.

The minister-president is not counted in the ratio of French-speaking to Dutch-speaking ministers. In practice, every minister-president has been a francophone, though bilingual.

<text>The [[minister-president]] of [[Flanders]] () is the head of the Flemish Government, which is the executive branch of the Flemish Region and Flemish Community.

The incumbent officeholder is Matthias Diependaele, who took over from Jan Jambon, following the 2024 Belgian regional elections. The current government is made up of three parties, the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA), Vooruit, and Christian Democratic and Flemish (CD&amp;V). The ministers were sworn in on 30 September 2024. The government consists of nine ministers, five for the N-VA, two for Vooruit and two for CD&amp;V.

==Appointment==
Following the election of the Flemish Parliament, a Flemish Government is formed with a maximum of eleven ministers. The largest party in the government coalition may choose the minister-president. Following the oath of office of all ministers before the Flemish Parliament, the minister-president alone takes the oath of office before the King as well.

Regional elections are held every 5 years. The Flemish Parliament was elected directly for the first time in 1995. Prior to 1995, the members of the Flemish Parliament were the members of the Dutch language group of the Federal Parliament of Belgium.

<doc id="148218" wikidata="Q558049" url="?curid=148218" title="Frederick I, Margrave of Baden">
<text>Frederick I of Baden (1249 – October 29, 1268), a member of the House of Zähringen, was Margrave of Baden and of Verona, as well as claimant Duke of Austria from 1250 until his death. As a fellow campaigner of the Hohenstaufen king Conradin, he likewise was beheaded at the behest of King Charles I of Naples.

==Claim to Austria==
He was born in Austrian Alland, the only son of the Swabian margrave Herman VI of Baden (c.1226–1250) and his wife Gertrude (1226–1288), niece and heiress of the late Babenberg duke Frederick II of Austria.

As Duke Frederick II of Austria had been killed at the 1246 Battle of the Leitha River, the ducal line of the Babenberg dynasty had become extinct. Margrave Herman VI of Baden, through his marriage with Gertrude, had raised inheritance claims to the Austrian and Styrian possessions. However, after the death of Emperor Frederick II in 1250, no strong Imperial authority existed to assert his title. Though he was backed by Pope Innocent IV and anti-king William of Holland, Herman could not prevail against the claims raised by the mighty Přemyslid king Wenceslaus I of Bohemia and his warlike son Ottokar II.

At the time of the death of his father, young Frederick stayed at the Meissen court, where his mother Gertrude had fled. He could succeed Margrave Herman in Baden, with his uncle Rudolf I acting as regent. Also claimant to the Austrian and Styrian duchies through his mother, Frederick took his residence near Vienna. However, when in 1252 Ottokar II married Gertrude&#x27;s aunt Margaret and moved into Austria, he again had to flee, at first to Styria and later to the Sponheim court in Carinthia.

== Association with Conradin ==
From about 1266, Frederick grew up at the Wittelsbach residence of Duke Louis II of Bavaria, where he became friends with Conradin, Duke of Swabia, the young son of King Conrad IV of Germany and heir to the Imperial Hohenstaufen dynasty. From him Frederick expected support in enforcing his claims to power.

In 1267 he made the fatal decision to accompany Conradin on his expedition against Charles of Anjou, who had been crowned King of Sicily by Pope Clement IV and killed Conradin&#x27;s uncle Manfred in the 1266 Battle of Benevento. Conradin had moved into Rome on 24 July 1268, however, Charles decisively defeated the Hohenstaufen troops at the Battle of Tagliacozzo on 23 August, whereafter Conradin and Frederick fled and passed into captivity on 8 September at Torre Astura, south of Anzio. Betrayed and handed over to King Charles by their Frangipani followers, both remained in degrading imprisonment at Castel dell&#x27;Ovo in Naples. The king himself condemned them to death; according to legend, they heard their verdict while playing chess and indifferently continued the game. Conradin and Frederick were publicly beheaded in the &quot;Piazza del Mercato&quot; on 29 October.

Their mortal remains were at first hastily buried, but later transferred to the church of Santa Maria del Carmine, Naples, at the behest of Conradin&#x27;s mother Elisabeth of Bavaria. Pope Clement died a month after the execution; Charles, though, was expelled from his kingdom in the Sicilian Vespers of 1282.

<text>The Tuareg () languages constitute a group of closely related Berber languages and dialects. They are spoken by the Tuareg Berbers in large parts of Mali, Niger, Algeria, Libya, and Burkina Faso, with a few speakers, the &quot;Kinnin&quot;, in Chad.

==Description==
Tuareg dialects belong to the South Berber group and are sometimes regarded as a single language (as for instance by Karl-Gottfried Prasse). They are distinguished mainly by a few sound shifts (notably affecting the pronunciation of original &quot;z&quot; and &quot;h&quot;). The Tuareg varieties are unusually conservative in some respects; they retain two short vowels where Northern-Berber languages have one or none, and have a much lower proportion of Arabic loanwords than most Berber languages.

The Tuareg languages are traditionally written in the indigenous Tifinagh alphabet. However, the Arabic script is commonly used in some areas (and has been since medieval times), while the Latin script is official in Mali and Niger.

==Subclassification==

*Tuareg
**Northern
***Tamahaq – language of the Kel Ahaggar, and Kel Ajjer spoken in Algeria, western Libya and in the north of Niger by around 77,000 people. Also known as Tahaggart.
**Southern
***Tamasheq – language of the Kel Adrar (also known as Adrar des Ifoghas), spoken in Mali by approximately 500,000 people.
***Air Tamajaq – language of the Kel Ayer (sometimes spelled Aïr), spoken in Niger by approximately 250,000 people.
***Tawellemet – language of the Iwellemmeden, spoken in Mali and Niger by approximately 800,000 people. The term Iwellemmeden (the name of the people) is sometimes used to denote the language.
***Tamashaq language of Kal Asakan.
Blench (ms, 2006) lists the following as separate languages, with dialects in parentheses:
*Tawellemet (Abalagh/East, West)
*Tayiṛt (Ingal, Gofat)
*Tamesgrest (Azerori)
*Tafaghist
*Tahaggart/Ahaggar
*Ghat

Speakers of Tin Sert (Tetserret) identify as Tuareg, but the language is Western Berber.

==Orthography==
The Tuareg languages may be written using the ancient Tifinagh (Libyco-Berber) script, the Latin script or the Arabic script. The Malian national literacy program DNAFLA has established a standard for the Latin alphabet, which is used with modifications in Prasse&#x27;s &quot;Lexique&quot; and the government literacy program in Burkina, while in Niger a different system was used. There is also some variation in Tifinagh and in the Arabic script.

Early uses of the Tifinagh script have been found on rock art and in various sepulchres. Among these are the 1,500 year old monumental tomb of the Tuareg matriarch Tin Hinan, where vestiges of a Tifinagh inscription have been found on one of its walls.

Tifinagh usage is now restricted mainly to writing magical formulae, writing on palms when silence is required, and in letter-writing. The Arabic script is mostly in use by tribes more involved in Islamic learning, and little is known about its conventions.


The DNAFLA system is a somewhat morphophonemic orthography, not indicating initial vowel shortening, always writing the directional particle as &lt; dd⟩, and not indicating all assimilations (e.g. for [tămašăq]).

In Burkina Faso the emphatics are denoted by &quot;hooked&quot; letters, as in Fula, e.g. .

==Phonology==

===Vowels===
The vowel system includes five long vowels, and two short vowels, (on this page, is used to represent IPA ). Some of the vowels have more open &quot;emphatic&quot; allophones that occur immediately before emphatic consonants, subject to dialectal variation. These allophones include for and (although may be less open), for and (although may be less open), and for . Karl Prasse argued that /e/ goes back to Proto-Berber, while /o/ is derived from /u/. Comparative evidence shows that /ə/ derives from a merger of Proto-Berber */ĭ/ and */ŭ/.

Sudlow classes the &quot;semivowels&quot; /w, j/ with the vowels, and notes the following possible diphthongs: /əw/ (&gt; [u]), /ăw/, /aw/, /ew/, /iw/, /ow/, /uw/, /əj/ (&gt; [i]), /ăj/, /aj/, /ej/, /ij/, /oj/, /uj/.

===Consonants===

The consonant inventory largely resembles Arabic: differentiated voicing; uvulars, pharyngeals (traditionally referred to as emphatics) ; requiring the pharynx muscles to contract and influencing the pronunciation of the following vowel, and no voiceless bilabial plosive.

The glottal stop is non-phonemic. It occurs at the beginning of vowel-initial words to fill the place of the initial consonant in the syllable structure (see below), although if the words is preceded by a word ending in a consonant, it makes a liaison instead. Phrase-final /a/ is also followed by a phonetic glottal stop.

Gemination is contrastive. Normally becomes , becomes , and becomes . and are predominantly geminate. In addition, in Tadɣaq is usually geminate, but in Tudalt singleton may occur.

Voicing assimilation occurs, with the first consonant taking the voicing of the second (e.g. &gt; ).

Cluster reduction turns word/morpheme-final into and into (e.g. &gt; &#x27;Tamasheq&#x27;).

===Phonotactics===
Syllable structure is CV(C)(C), including glottal stops (see above).

===Suprasegmentals===
Contrastive stress may occur in the stative aspect of verbs.

===Dialectal differences===

Different dialects have slightly different consonant inventories. Some of these differences can be diachronically accounted for. For example, Proto-Berber &quot;*h&quot; is mostly lost in Ayer Tuareg, while it is maintained in almost every position in Mali Tuareg. The Iwellemmeden and Ahaggar Tuareg dialects are midway between these positions. The Proto-Berber consonant &quot;*z&quot; comes out differently in different dialects, a development that is to some degree reflected in the dialect names. It is realized as &quot;h&quot; in Tamahaq (Tahaggart), as &quot;š&quot; in Tamasheq and as simple &quot;z&quot; in the Tamajaq dialects Tawallammat and Tayart. In the latter two, &quot;*z&quot; is realised as &quot;ž&quot; before palatal vowels, explaining the form &quot;Tamajaq&quot;. In Tawallammat and especially Tayart, this kind of palatalization actually does not confine itself to &quot;z&quot;. In these dialects, dentals in general are palatalized before and . For example, &quot;tidət&quot; is pronounced in Tayart.

Other differences can easily be traced back to borrowing. For example, the Arabic pharyngeals &quot;ħ&quot; and &quot;ʻ&quot; have been borrowed along with Arabic loanwords by dialects specialized in Islamic (Maraboutic) learning. Other dialects substitute &quot;ħ&quot; and &quot;ʻ&quot; respectively with &quot;x&quot; and &quot;ɣ&quot;.

==Grammar==

The basic word order in Tuareg is verb–subject–object. Verbs can be grouped into 19 morphological classes; some of these classes can be defined semantically. Verbs carry information on the subject of the sentence in the form of pronominal marking. No simple adjectives exist in the Tuareg languages; adjectival concepts are expressed using a relative verb form traditionally called &#x27;participle&#x27;. The Tuareg languages have very heavily influenced Northern Songhay languages such as Sawaq, whose speakers are culturally Tuareg but speak Songhay; this influence includes points of phonology and sometimes grammar as well as extensive loanwords.

===Syntax===
Tamasheq prefers VSO order; however it contains topic–comment structure (like in American Sign Language, Modern Hebrew, Japanese and Russian), allowing the emphasized concept to be placed first, be it the subject or object, the latter giving an effect somewhat like the English passive. Sudlow uses the following examples, all expressing the concept &quot;Men don&#x27;t cook porridge&quot; (e denotes Sudlow&#x27;s schwa):

Again like Japanese, the &quot;pronoun/particle &#x27;a&#x27; is used with a following relative clause to bring a noun in a phrase to the beginning for emphasis,&quot; a structure which can be used to emphasize even objects of prepositions. Sudlow&#x27;s example (s denotes voiceless palato-alveolar fricative):

The indirect object marker takes the form i/y in Tudalt and e/y in Tadɣaq.

===Morphology===

As a root-and-pattern, or templatic language, triliteral roots (three-consonant bases) are the most common in Tamasheq. Niels and Regula Christiansen use the root k-t-b (to write) to demonstrate past completed aspect conjugation:



The verbal correspondence with the use of aspect; Tamasheq uses four, as delineated by Sudlow:

# Perfective: complete actions
# Stative: &quot;lasting states as the ongoing results of a completed action.&quot;
# Imperfective: future or possible actions, &quot;often used following a verb expressing emotion, decision or thought,&quot; it can be marked with &quot;&#x27;ad&#x27;&quot; (shortened to &quot;&#x27;a-&#x27;&quot; with prepositions).
# Cursive: ongoing actions, often habitual ones.

Commands are expressed in the imperative mood, which tends to be a form of the imperfective aspect, unless the action is to be repeated or continued, in which case the cursive aspect is preferred.

<doc id="148224" wikidata="Q313714" url="?curid=148224" title="Thomas Beecham">
<text>Sir Thomas Beecham, 2nd Baronet, (29 April 18798 March 1961) was an English conductor and impresario best known for his association with the London Philharmonic and the Royal Philharmonic orchestras. He was also closely associated with the Liverpool Philharmonic and Hallé orchestras. From the early 20th century until his death, Beecham was a major influence on the musical life of Britain and, according to the BBC, was Britain&#x27;s first international conductor.

Born to a rich industrial family, Beecham began his career as a conductor in 1899. He used his access to the family fortune to finance opera from the 1910s until the start of the Second World War, staging seasons at Covent Garden, Drury Lane and His Majesty&#x27;s Theatre with international stars, his own orchestra and a wide repertoire. Among the works he introduced to England were Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Elektra&quot;, &quot;Salome&quot; and &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot; and three operas by Frederick Delius.

Together with his younger colleague Malcolm Sargent, Beecham founded the London Philharmonic, and he conducted its first performance at the Queen&#x27;s Hall in 1932. In the 1940s he worked for three years in the United States, where he was music director of the Seattle Symphony and conducted at the Metropolitan Opera. After his return to Britain, he founded the Royal Philharmonic in 1946 and conducted it until his death in 1961.

Beecham&#x27;s repertoire was eclectic, sometimes favouring lesser-known composers over famous ones. His specialities included composers whose works were neglected in Britain before he became their advocate, such as Delius and Berlioz. Other composers with whose music he was frequently associated were Haydn, Schubert, Sibelius and the composer he revered above all others, Mozart.

==Biography==

===Early years===

Beecham was born in St Helens, Lancashire (now Merseyside), in a house adjoining the Beecham&#x27;s Pills laxative factory founded by his grandfather, Thomas Beecham. His parents were Joseph Beecham, the elder son of Thomas, and Josephine, &quot;née&quot; Burnett. In 1885, with the family firm flourishing financially, Joseph Beecham moved his family to a large house in Ewanville, Huyton, near Liverpool. Their former home was demolished to make room for an extension to the pill factory.

Beecham was educated at Rossall School between 1892 and 1897, after which he hoped to attend a music conservatoire in Germany, but his father forbade it, and instead Beecham went to Wadham College, Oxford to read Classics. He did not find university life to his taste and successfully sought his father&#x27;s permission to leave Oxford in 1898. He studied as a pianist but, despite his excellent natural talent and fine technique, he had difficulty because of his small hands, and any career as a soloist was ruled out by a wrist injury in 1904. He studied composition with Frederic Austin in Liverpool, Charles Wood in London, and Moritz Moszkowski in Paris. As a conductor, he was self-taught.

===First orchestras===
Beecham first conducted in public in St. Helens in October 1899, with an &quot;ad hoc&quot; ensemble comprising local musicians and players from the Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra and the Hallé in Manchester. A month later, he stood in at short notice for the celebrated conductor Hans Richter at a concert by the Hallé to mark Joseph Beecham&#x27;s inauguration as mayor of St Helens. Soon afterwards, Joseph Beecham secretly committed his wife to a mental hospital. Thomas and his elder sister Emily helped to secure their mother&#x27;s release and to force their father to pay annual alimony of £4,500. For this, Joseph disinherited them. Beecham was estranged from his father for ten years.

Beecham&#x27;s professional début as a conductor was in 1902 at the Shakespeare Theatre, Clapham, with Balfe&#x27;s &quot;The Bohemian Girl&quot;, for the Imperial Grand Opera Company. He was engaged as assistant conductor for a tour and was allotted four other operas, including &quot;Carmen&quot; and &quot;Pagliacci&quot;. A Beecham biographer calls the company &quot;grandly named but decidedly ramshackle&quot;, though Beecham&#x27;s Carmen was Zélie de Lussan, a leading exponent of the title role. Beecham was also composing music in these early years, but he was not satisfied with his own efforts and instead concentrated on conducting.

In 1906 Beecham was invited to conduct the New Symphony Orchestra, a recently formed ensemble of 46 players, in a series of concerts at the Bechstein Hall in London. Throughout his career, Beecham frequently chose to programme works to suit his own tastes rather than those of the paying public. In his early discussions with his new orchestra, he proposed works by a long list of barely known composers such as Étienne Méhul, Nicolas Dalayrac and Ferdinando Paer. During this period, Beecham first encountered the music of Frederick Delius, which he at once loved deeply and with which he became closely associated for the rest of his life.

Beecham quickly concluded that to compete with the two existing London orchestras, the Queen&#x27;s Hall Orchestra and the recently founded London Symphony Orchestra (LSO), his forces must be expanded to full symphonic strength and play in larger halls. For two years starting in October 1907, Beecham and the enlarged New Symphony Orchestra gave concerts at the Queen&#x27;s Hall. He paid little attention to the box office: his programmes were described by a biographer as &quot;even more certain to deter the public then than it would be in our own day&quot;. The principal pieces of his first concert with the orchestra were d&#x27;Indy&#x27;s symphonic ballad &quot;La forêt enchantée&quot;, Smetana&#x27;s symphonic poem &quot;Šárka&quot;, and Lalo&#x27;s little-known Symphony in G minor. Beecham retained an affection for the last work: it was among the works he conducted at his final recording sessions more than fifty years later.

In 1908 Beecham and the New Symphony Orchestra parted company, disagreeing about artistic control and, in particular, the deputy system. Under this system, orchestral players, if offered a better-paid engagement elsewhere, could send a substitute to a rehearsal or a concert. The treasurer of the Royal Philharmonic Society described it thus: &quot;&quot;A&quot;, whom you want, signs to play at your concert. He sends &quot;B&quot; (whom you don&#x27;t mind) to the first rehearsal. &quot;B&quot;, without your knowledge or consent, sends &quot;C&quot; to the second rehearsal. Not being able to play at the concert, &quot;C&quot; sends &quot;D&quot;, whom you would have paid five shillings to stay away.&quot; Henry Wood had already banned the deputy system in the Queen&#x27;s Hall Orchestra (provoking rebel players to found the London Symphony Orchestra), and Beecham followed suit. The New Symphony Orchestra survived without him and subsequently became the Royal Albert Hall Orchestra.

In 1909, Beecham founded the Beecham Symphony Orchestra. He did not poach from established symphony orchestras, but instead he recruited from theatre bandrooms, local symphony societies, the palm courts of hotels, and music colleges. The result was a youthful team – the average age of his players was 25. They included names that would become celebrated in their fields, such as Albert Sammons, Lionel Tertis, Eric Coates and Eugene Cruft.

Because he persistently programmed works that did not attract the public, Beecham&#x27;s musical activities at this time consistently lost money. As a result of his estrangement from his father between 1899 and 1909, his access to the Beecham family fortune was strictly limited. From 1907 he had an annuity of £700 left to him in his grandfather&#x27;s will, and his mother subsidised some of his loss-making concerts, but it was not until father and son were reconciled in 1909 that Beecham was able to draw on the family fortune to promote opera.

===1910–1920===
From 1910, subsidised by his father, Beecham realised his ambition to mount opera seasons at Covent Garden and other houses. In the Edwardian opera house, the star singers were regarded as all-important, and conductors were seen as ancillary. Between 1910 and 1939 Beecham did much to change the balance of power.
In 1910, Beecham either conducted or was responsible as impresario for 190 performances at Covent Garden and His Majesty&#x27;s Theatre. His assistant conductors were Bruno Walter and Percy Pitt. During the year, he mounted 34 different operas, most of them either new to London or almost unknown there. Beecham later acknowledged that in his early years the operas he chose to present were too obscure to attract the public. During his 1910 season at His Majesty&#x27;s, the rival Grand Opera Syndicate put on a concurrent season of its own at Covent Garden; London&#x27;s total opera performances for the year amounted to 273 performances, far more than the box-office demand could support. Of the 34 operas that Beecham staged in 1910, only four made money: Richard Strauss&#x27;s new operas &quot;Elektra&quot; and &quot;Salome,&quot; receiving their first, and highly publicised, performances in Britain, and &quot;The Tales of Hoffmann&quot; and &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot;.

In 1911 and 1912, the Beecham Symphony Orchestra played for Sergei Diaghilev&#x27;s Ballets Russes, both at Covent Garden and at the Krolloper in Berlin, under the batons of Beecham and Pierre Monteux, Diaghilev&#x27;s chief conductor. Beecham was much admired for conducting the complicated new score of Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Petrushka&quot;, at two days&#x27; notice and without rehearsal, when Monteux became unavailable. While in Berlin, Beecham and his orchestra, in Beecham&#x27;s words, caused a &quot;mild stir&quot;, scoring a triumph: the orchestra was agreed by the Berlin press to be an elite body, one of the best in the world. The principal Berlin musical weekly, &quot;Die Signale&quot;, asked, &quot;Where does London find such magnificent young instrumentalists?&quot; The violins were credited with rich, noble tone, the woodwinds with lustre, the brass, &quot;which has not quite the dignity and amplitude of our best German brass&quot;, with uncommon delicacy of execution.
Beecham&#x27;s 1913 seasons included the British premiere of Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot; at Covent Garden, and a &quot;Grand Season of Russian Opera and Ballet&quot; at Drury Lane. At the latter there were three operas, all starring Feodor Chaliapin, and all new to Britain: Mussorgsky&#x27;s &quot;Boris Godunov&quot; and &quot;Khovanshchina&quot;, and Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s &quot;Ivan the Terrible&quot;. There were also 15 ballets, with leading dancers including Vaslav Nijinsky and Tamara Karsavina. The ballets included Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Jeux&quot; and his controversially erotic &quot;L&#x27;après-midi d&#x27;un faune,&quot; and the British premiere of Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;The Rite of Spring,&quot; six weeks after its first performance in Paris. Beecham shared Monteux&#x27;s private dislike of the piece, much preferring &quot;Petrushka&quot;. Beecham did not conduct during this season; Monteux and others conducted the Beecham Symphony Orchestra. The following year, Beecham and his father presented Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s &quot;The Maid of Pskov&quot; and Borodin&#x27;s &quot;Prince Igor&quot;, with Chaliapin, and Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;The Nightingale.&quot;

During the First World War, Beecham strove, often without a fee, to keep music alive in London, Liverpool, Manchester and other British cities. He conducted for, and gave financial support to, three institutions with which he was connected at various times: the Hallé Orchestra, the LSO and the Royal Philharmonic Society. In 1915 he formed the Beecham Opera Company, with mainly British singers, performing in London and throughout the country. In 1916, he received a knighthood in the New Year Honours and succeeded to the baronetcy on his father&#x27;s death later that year.

After the war, there were joint Covent Garden seasons with the Grand Opera Syndicate in 1919 and 1920, but these were, according to a biographer, pale confused echoes of the years before 1914. These seasons included forty productions, of which Beecham conducted only nine. After the 1920 season, Beecham temporarily withdrew from conducting to deal with a financial problem that he described as &quot;the most trying and unpleasant experience of my life&quot;.

===Covent Garden estate===

Influenced by an ambitious financier, James White, Sir Joseph Beecham had agreed, in July 1914, to buy the Covent Garden estate from the Duke of Bedford and float a limited company to manage the estate commercially. The deal was described by &quot;The Times&quot; as &quot;one of the largest ever carried out in real estate in London&quot;. Sir Joseph paid an initial deposit of £200,000 and covenanted to pay the balance of the £2 million purchase price on 11 November. Within a month, however, the First World War broke out, and new official restrictions on the use of capital prevented the completion of the contract. The estate and market continued to be managed by the Duke&#x27;s staff, and in October 1916, Joseph Beecham died suddenly, with the transaction still uncompleted. The matter was brought before the civil courts with the aim of disentangling Sir Joseph&#x27;s affairs; the court and all parties agreed that a private company should be formed, with his two sons as directors, to complete the Covent Garden contract. In July 1918, the Duke and his trustees conveyed the estate to the new company, subject to a mortgage of the balance of the purchase price still outstanding: £1.25 million.

Beecham and his brother Henry had to sell enough of their father&#x27;s estate to discharge this mortgage. For more than three years, Beecham was absent from the musical scene, working to sell property worth over £1 million. By 1923 enough money had been raised. The mortgage was discharged, and Beecham&#x27;s personal liabilities, amounting to £41,558, were paid in full. In 1924 the Covent Garden property and the pill-making business at St Helens were united in one company, Beecham Estates and Pills. The nominal capital was £1,850,000, of which Beecham had a substantial share.

===London Philharmonic===
After his absence, Beecham first reappeared on the rostrum conducting the Hallé in Manchester in March 1923, in a programme including works by Berlioz, Bizet, Delius and Mozart. He returned to London the following month, conducting the combined Royal Albert Hall Orchestra (the renamed New Symphony Orchestra) and London Symphony Orchestra in April 1923. The main work on the programme was Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Ein Heldenleben&quot;. No longer with an orchestra of his own, Beecham established a relationship with the London Symphony Orchestra that lasted for the rest of the 1920s. Towards the end of the decade, he negotiated inconclusively with the BBC over the possibility of establishing a permanent radio orchestra.

In 1931, Beecham was approached by the rising young conductor Malcolm Sargent with a proposal to set up a permanent, salaried orchestra with a subsidy guaranteed by Sargent&#x27;s patrons, the Courtauld family. Originally Sargent and Beecham envisaged a reshuffled version of the London Symphony Orchestra, but the LSO, a self-governing co-operative, balked at weeding out and replacing underperforming players. In 1932 Beecham lost patience and agreed with Sargent to set up a new orchestra from scratch. The London Philharmonic Orchestra (LPO), as it was named, consisted of 106 players including a few young musicians straight from music college, many established players from provincial orchestras, and 17 of the LSO&#x27;s leading members. The principals included Paul Beard, George Stratton, Anthony Pini, Gerald Jackson, Léon Goossens, Reginald Kell, James Bradshaw and Marie Goossens.
The orchestra made its debut at the Queen&#x27;s Hall on 7 October 1932, conducted by Beecham. After the first item, Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;Roman Carnival Overture&quot;, the audience went wild, some of them standing on their seats to clap and shout. During the next eight years, the LPO appeared nearly a hundred times at the Queen&#x27;s Hall for the Royal Philharmonic Society alone, played for Beecham&#x27;s opera seasons at Covent Garden, and made more than 300 gramophone records. Berta Geissmar, his secretary from 1936, wrote, &quot;The relations between the Orchestra and Sir Thomas were always easy and cordial. He always treated a rehearsal as a joint undertaking with the Orchestra.… The musicians were entirely unselfconscious with him. Instinctively they accorded him the artistic authority which he did not expressly claim. Thus he obtained the best from them and they gave it without reserve.&quot;

By the early 1930s, Beecham had secured substantial control of the Covent Garden opera seasons. Wishing to concentrate on music-making rather than management, he assumed the role of artistic director, and Geoffrey Toye was recruited as managing director. In 1933, &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; with Frida Leider and Lauritz Melchior was a success, and the season continued with the &quot;Ring&quot; cycle and nine other operas. The 1934 season featured Conchita Supervía in &quot;La Cenerentola,&quot; and Lotte Lehmann and Alexander Kipnis in the &quot;Ring&quot;. Clemens Krauss conducted the British première of Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Arabella&quot;. During 1933 and 1934, Beecham repelled attempts by John Christie to form a link between Christie&#x27;s new Glyndebourne Festival and the Royal Opera House. Beecham and Toye fell out over the latter&#x27;s insistence on bringing in a popular film star, Grace Moore, to sing Mimi in &quot;La bohème&quot;. The production was a box-office success, but an artistic failure. Beecham manoeuvred Toye out of the managing directorship in what their fellow conductor Sir Adrian Boult described as an &quot;absolutely beastly&quot; manner.

From 1935 to 1939, Beecham, now in sole control, presented international seasons with eminent guest singers and conductors. Beecham conducted between a third and half of the performances each season. He intended the 1940 season to include the first complete performances of Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;Les Troyens&quot;, but the outbreak of the Second World War caused the season to be abandoned. Beecham did not conduct again at Covent Garden until 1951, and by then it was no longer under his control.

Beecham took the London Philharmonic on a controversial tour of Germany in 1936. There were complaints that he was being used by Nazi propagandists, and Beecham complied with a Nazi request not to play the &quot;Scottish&quot; Symphony of Mendelssohn, who was a Christian by faith but a Jew by birth. In Berlin, Beecham&#x27;s concert was attended by Adolf Hitler, whose lack of punctuality caused Beecham to remark very audibly, &quot;The old bugger&#x27;s late.&quot; After this tour, Beecham refused renewed invitations to give concerts in Germany, although he honoured contractual commitments to conduct at the Berlin State Opera, in 1937 and 1938, and recorded &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; for EMI in the Beethovensaal in Berlin in the same years.

As his sixtieth birthday approached, Beecham was advised by his doctors to take a year&#x27;s complete break from music, and he planned to go abroad to rest in a warm climate. The Australian Broadcasting Commission had been seeking for several years to get him to conduct in Australia. The outbreak of war on 3 September 1939 obliged him to postpone his plans for several months, striving instead to secure the future of the London Philharmonic, whose financial guarantees had been withdrawn by its backers when war was declared. Before leaving, Beecham raised large sums of money for the orchestra and helped its members to form themselves into a self-governing company.

===1940s===
Beecham left Britain in the spring of 1940, going first to Australia and then to North America. He became music director of the Seattle Symphony in 1941. In 1942 he joined the Metropolitan Opera as joint senior conductor with his former assistant Bruno Walter. He began with his own adaptation of Bach&#x27;s comic cantata, &quot;Phoebus and Pan&quot;, followed by &quot;Le Coq d&#x27;Or&quot;. His main repertoire was French: &quot;Carmen, Louise&quot; (with Grace Moore), &quot;Manon&quot;, &quot;Faust&quot;, &quot;Mignon&quot; and &quot;The Tales of Hoffmann&quot;. In addition to his Seattle and New York posts, Beecham was guest conductor with 18 American orchestras.

In 1944, Beecham returned to Britain. Musically his reunion with the London Philharmonic was triumphant, but the orchestra, now, after his help in 1939, a self-governing co-operative, attempted to hire him on its own terms as its salaried artistic director. &quot;I emphatically refuse&quot;, concluded Beecham, &quot;to be wagged by any orchestra ... I am going to found one more great orchestra to round off my career.&quot; When Walter Legge founded the Philharmonia Orchestra in 1945, Beecham conducted its first concert. But he was not disposed to accept a salaried position from Legge, his former assistant, any more than from his former players in the LPO.

In 1946, Beecham founded the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (RPO), securing an agreement with the Royal Philharmonic Society that the new orchestra should replace the LPO at all the Society&#x27;s concerts. Beecham later agreed with the Glyndebourne Festival that the RPO should be the resident orchestra at Glyndebourne each summer. He secured backing, including that of record companies in the US as well as Britain, with whom lucrative recording contracts were negotiated. As in 1909 and in 1932, Beecham&#x27;s assistants recruited in the freelance pool and elsewhere. Original members of the RPO included James Bradshaw, Dennis Brain, Leonard Brain, Archie Camden, Gerald Jackson and Reginald Kell. The orchestra later became celebrated for its regular team of woodwind principals, often referred to as &quot;The Royal Family&quot;, consisting of Jack Brymer (clarinet), Gwydion Brooke (bassoon), Terence MacDonagh (oboe) and Gerald Jackson (flute).

Beecham&#x27;s long association with the Hallé Orchestra as a guest conductor ceased after John Barbirolli became the orchestra&#x27;s chief conductor in 1944. Beecham was, to his great indignation, ousted from the honorary presidency of the Hallé Concerts Society, and Barbirolli refused to &quot;let that man near my orchestra&quot;. Beecham&#x27;s relationship with the Liverpool Philharmonic, which he had first conducted in 1911, was resumed harmoniously after the war. A manager of the orchestra recalled, &quot;It was an unwritten law in Liverpool that first choice of dates offered to guest conductors was given to Beecham. ... In Liverpool there was one over-riding factor – he was adored.&quot;

===1950s and later years===
Beecham, whom the BBC called &quot;Britain&#x27;s first international conductor&quot;, took the RPO on a strenuous tour through the United States, Canada and South Africa in 1950. During the North American tour, Beecham conducted 49 concerts in almost daily succession. In 1951, he was invited to conduct at Covent Garden after a 12-year absence. State-funded for the first time, the opera company operated quite differently from his pre-war regime. Instead of short, star-studded seasons, with a major symphony orchestra, the new director David Webster was attempting to build up a permanent ensemble of home-grown talent performing all the year round, in English translations. Extreme economy in productions and great attention to the box-office were essential, and Beecham, though he had been hurt and furious at his exclusion, was not suited to participate in such an undertaking. When offered a chorus of eighty singers for his return, conducting &quot;Die Meistersinger&quot;, he insisted on augmenting their number to 200. He also, contrary to Webster&#x27;s policy, insisted on performing the piece in German. In 1953 at Oxford, Beecham presented the world premiere of Delius&#x27;s first opera, &quot;Irmelin&quot;, and his last operatic performances in Britain were in 1955 at Bath, with Grétry&#x27;s &quot;Zémire et Azor&quot;.

Between 1951 and 1960, Beecham conducted 92 concerts at the Royal Festival Hall. Characteristic Beecham programmes of the RPO years included symphonies by Bizet, Franck, Haydn, Schubert and Tchaikovsky; Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Ein Heldenleben&quot;; concertos by Mozart and Saint-Saëns; a Delius and Sibelius programme; and many of his favoured shorter pieces. He did not stick uncompromisingly to his familiar repertoire. After the sudden death of the German conductor Wilhelm Furtwängler in 1954, Beecham in tribute conducted the two programmes his colleague had been due to present at the Festival Hall; these included Bach&#x27;s Third Brandenburg Concerto, Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Rapsodie espagnole&quot;, Brahms&#x27;s Symphony No. 1, and Barber&#x27;s &quot;Second Essay for Orchestra&quot;.
In the summer of 1958, Beecham conducted a season at the Teatro Colón, Buenos Aires, Argentina, consisting of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Otello,&quot; Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot;, Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Fidelio,&quot; Saint-Saëns&#x27;s &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot; and Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;. These were his last operatic performances. It was during this season that Betty Humby died suddenly. She was cremated in Buenos Aires and her ashes returned to England. Beecham&#x27;s own last illness prevented his operatic debut at Glyndebourne in a planned &quot;Magic Flute&quot; and a final appearance at Covent Garden conducting Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;The Trojans&quot;.

Sixty-six years after his first visit to America, Beecham made his last, beginning in late 1959, conducting in Pittsburgh, San Francisco, Seattle, Chicago and Washington. During this tour, he also conducted in Canada. He flew back to London on 12 April 1960 and did not leave England again. His final concert was at Portsmouth Guildhall on 7 May 1960. The programme, all characteristic choices, comprised the &quot;Magic Flute&quot; Overture, Haydn&#x27;s Symphony No. 100 (the &quot;Military&quot;), Beecham&#x27;s own Handel arrangement, &quot;Love in Bath&quot;, Schubert&#x27;s Symphony No. 5, &quot;On the River&quot; by Delius, and the &quot;Bacchanale&quot; from &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot;.

Beecham died of a coronary thrombosis at his London residence, aged 81, on 8 March 1961. He was buried two days later in Brookwood Cemetery, Surrey. Owing to changes at Brookwood, his remains were exhumed in 1991 and reburied in St Peter&#x27;s Churchyard at Limpsfield, Surrey, close to the joint grave of Delius and his wife Jelka Rosen.

===Personal life===

Beecham was married three times. In 1903 he married Utica Celestina Welles, daughter of Dr Charles S. Welles, of New York, and his wife Ella Celeste, &quot;née&quot; Miles. Beecham and his wife had two sons: Adrian, born in 1904, who became a composer and achieved some celebrity in the 1920s and 1930s, and Thomas, born in 1909. After the birth of his second child, Beecham began to drift away from the marriage. By 1911, no longer living with his wife and family, he was involved as co-respondent in a much-publicised divorce case. Utica ignored advice that she should divorce him and secure substantial alimony; she did not believe in divorce. She never remarried after Beecham divorced her (in 1943), and she outlived her former husband by sixteen years, dying in 1977.

In 1909 or early 1910, Beecham began an affair with Maud Alice (known as Emerald), Lady Cunard. Although they never lived together, it continued, despite other relationships on his part, until his remarriage in 1943. She was a tireless fund-raiser for his musical enterprises. Beecham&#x27;s biographers are agreed that she was in love with him, but that his feelings for her were less strong. During the 1920s and 1930s, Beecham also had an affair with Dora Labbette, a soprano sometimes known as Lisa Perli, with whom he had a son, Paul Strang, born in March 1933. Strang, a lawyer who served on the boards of several musical institutions, died in April 2024.

In 1943 Lady Cunard was devastated to learn (not from Beecham) that he intended to divorce Utica to marry Betty Humby, a concert pianist 29 years his junior. Beecham married Betty in 1943, and they were a devoted couple until her death in 1958. On 10 August 1959, two years before his death, he married in Zurich his former secretary, Shirley Hudson, who had worked for the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra&#x27;s administration since 1950. She was 27, he 80.

==Repertoire==

===Handel, Haydn, and Mozart===
The earliest composer whose music Beecham regularly performed was Handel, whom he called, &quot;the great international master of all time. ... He wrote Italian music better than any Italian; French music better than any Frenchman; English music better than any Englishman; and, with the exception of Bach, outrivalled all other Germans.&quot; In his performances of Handel, Beecham ignored what he called the &quot;professors, pedants, pedagogues&quot;. He followed Mendelssohn and Mozart in editing and reorchestrating Handel&#x27;s scores to suit contemporary tastes. At a time when Handel&#x27;s operas were scarcely known, Beecham knew them so well that he was able to arrange three ballets, two other suites and a piano concerto from them. He gave Handel&#x27;s oratorio &quot;Solomon&quot; its first performance since the 18th century, with a text edited by the conductor.

With Haydn, too, Beecham was far from an authenticist, using unscholarly 19th-century versions of the scores, avoiding the use of the harpsichord, and phrasing the music romantically. He recorded the twelve &quot;London&quot; symphonies, and regularly programmed some of them in his concerts. Earlier Haydn works were unfamiliar in the first half of the 20th century, but Beecham conducted several of them, including the Symphony No. 40 and an early piano concerto. He programmed &quot;The Seasons&quot; regularly throughout his career, recording it for EMI in 1956, and in 1944 added &quot;The Creation&quot; to his repertoire.

For Beecham, Mozart was &quot;the central point of European music,&quot; and he treated the composer&#x27;s scores with more deference than he gave most others. He edited the incomplete Requiem, made English translations of at least two of the great operas, and introduced Covent Garden audiences who had rarely if ever heard them to &quot;Così fan tutte&quot;, &quot;Der Schauspieldirektor&quot; and &quot;Die Entführung aus dem Serail&quot;; he also regularly programmed &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;, &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; and &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;. He considered the best of Mozart&#x27;s piano concertos to be &quot;the most beautiful compositions of their kind in the world&quot;, and he played them many times with Betty Humby-Beecham and others.

===German music===

Beecham&#x27;s attitude towards 19th-century German repertoire was equivocal. He frequently disparaged Beethoven, Wagner and others, but regularly conducted their works, often with great success. He observed, &quot;Wagner, though a tremendous genius, gorged music like a German who overeats. And Bruckner was a hobbledehoy who had no style at all ... Even Beethoven thumped the tub; the Ninth symphony was composed by a kind of Mr. Gladstone of music.&quot; Despite his criticisms, Beecham conducted all the Beethoven symphonies during his career, and he made studio recordings of Nos. 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 8, and live recordings of No. 9 and &quot;Missa Solemnis&quot;. He conducted the Fourth Piano Concerto with pleasure (recording it with Arthur Rubinstein and the LPO) but avoided the &quot;Emperor Concerto&quot; when possible.

Beecham was not known for his Bach but nonetheless chose Bach (arranged by Beecham) for his debut at the Metropolitan Opera. He later gave the Third Brandenburg Concerto in one of his memorial concerts for Wilhelm Furtwängler (a performance described by &quot;The Times&quot; as &quot;a travesty, albeit an invigorating one&quot;). In Brahms&#x27;s music, Beecham was selective. He made a speciality of the Second Symphony but conducted the Third only occasionally, the First rarely, and the Fourth never. In his memoirs he made no mention of any Brahms performance after the year 1909.

Beecham was a great Wagnerian, despite his frequent expostulation about the composer&#x27;s length and repetitiousness: &quot;We&#x27;ve been rehearsing for two hours – and we&#x27;re still playing the same bloody tune!&quot; Beecham conducted all the works in the regular Wagner canon with the exception of &quot;Parsifal&quot;, which he presented at Covent Garden but never with himself in the pit. The chief music critic of &quot;The Times&quot; observed: &quot;Beecham&#x27;s &quot;Lohengrin&quot; was almost Italian in its lyricism; his &quot;Ring&quot; was less heroic than Bruno Walter&#x27;s or Furtwängler&#x27;s, but it sang from beginning to end&quot;.

Richard Strauss had a lifelong champion in Beecham, who introduced &quot;Elektra&quot;, &quot;Salome&quot;, &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot; and other operas to England. Beecham programmed &quot;Ein Heldenleben&quot; from 1910 until his last year; his final recording of it was released shortly after his death. &quot;Don Quixote, Till Eulenspiegel&quot;, the &quot;Bourgeois Gentilhomme&quot; music and &quot;Don Juan&quot; also featured in his repertory, but not &quot;Also Sprach Zarathustra&quot; or &quot;Tod und Verklärung&quot;. Strauss had the first and last pages of the manuscript of &quot;Elektra&quot; framed and presented them to &quot;my highly honoured friend ... and distinguished conductor of my work.&quot;

===French and Italian music===
In the opinion of the jury of the Académie du Disque Français, &quot;Sir Thomas Beecham has done more for French music abroad than any French conductor&quot;. Berlioz featured prominently in Beecham&#x27;s repertoire throughout his career, and in an age when the composer&#x27;s works received little exposure, Beecham presented most of them and recorded many. Along with Sir Colin Davis, Beecham has been described as one of the two &quot;foremost modern interpreters&quot; of Berlioz&#x27;s music. Both in concert and the recording studio, Beecham&#x27;s choices of French music were characteristically eclectic. He avoided Ravel but regularly programmed Debussy. Fauré did not feature often, although his orchestral &quot;Pavane&quot; was an exception; Beecham&#x27;s final recording sessions in 1959 included the &quot;Pavane&quot; and the &quot;Dolly Suite&quot;. Bizet was among Beecham&#x27;s favourites, and other French composers favoured by him included Gustave Charpentier, Delibes, Duparc, Grétry, Lalo, Lully, Offenbach, Saint-Saëns and Ambroise Thomas. Many of Beecham&#x27;s later recordings of French music were made in Paris with the Orchestre National de la Radiodiffusion Française. &quot;C&#x27;est un dieu&quot;, their concertmaster said of Beecham in 1957.

Of the more than two dozen operas in the Verdi canon, Beecham conducted eight during his long career: &quot;Il trovatore&quot;, &quot;La traviata&quot;, &quot;Aida&quot;, &quot;Don Carlos&quot;, &quot;Rigoletto&quot;, &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot;, &quot;Otello&quot; and &quot;Falstaff&quot;. As early as 1904, Beecham met Puccini through the librettist Luigi Illica, who had written the libretto for Beecham&#x27;s youthful attempt at composing an Italian opera. At the time of their meeting, Puccini and Illica were revising &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot; after its disastrous première. Beecham rarely conducted that work, but he conducted &quot;Tosca&quot;, &quot;Turandot&quot; and &quot;La bohème&quot;. His 1956 recording of &quot;La bohème&quot;, with Victoria de los Ángeles and Jussi Björling, has seldom been out of the catalogues since its release and received more votes than any other operatic set in a 1967 symposium of prominent critics.

===Delius, Sibelius and &quot;Lollipops&quot;===

Except for Delius, Beecham was generally antipathetic to, or at best lukewarm about, the music of his native land and its leading composers. Beecham&#x27;s championship of Delius, however, promoted the composer from relative obscurity. Delius&#x27;s amanuensis, Eric Fenby, referred to Beecham as &quot;excelling all others in the music of Delius ... Groves and Sargent may have matched him in the great choruses of &quot;A Mass of Life&quot;, but in all else Beecham was matchless, especially with the orchestra.&quot; In an all-Delius concert in June 1911 Beecham conducted the premiere of &quot;Songs of Sunset&quot;. He put on Delius Festivals in 1929 and 1946 and presented his concert works throughout his career. He conducted the British premieres of the operas &quot;A Village Romeo and Juliet&quot; in 1910 and &quot;Koanga&quot; in 1935, and the world premiere of &quot;Irmelin&quot; in 1953. However, he was not an uncritical Delian: he never conducted the &quot;Requiem&quot;, and he detailed his criticisms of it in his book on Delius.

Another major 20th-century composer who engaged Beecham&#x27;s sympathies was Sibelius, who recognised him as a fine conductor of his music (although Sibelius tended to be lavish with praise of anybody who conducted his music). In a live recording of a December 1954 concert performance of Sibelius&#x27;s Second Symphony with the BBC Symphony Orchestra in the Festival Hall, Beecham can be heard uttering encouraging shouts at the orchestra at climactic moments.

Beecham was dismissive of some of the established classics, saying for example, &quot;I would give the whole of Bach&#x27;s &quot;Brandenburg Concertos&quot; for Massenet&#x27;s &quot;Manon&quot;, and would think I had vastly profited by the exchange&quot;. He was, by contrast, famous for presenting slight pieces as encores, which he called &quot;lollipops&quot;. Some of the best-known were Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;Danse des sylphes&quot;; Chabrier&#x27;s &quot;Joyeuse Marche&quot; and Gounod&#x27;s &quot;Le Sommeil de Juliette&quot;.

==Recordings==

The composer Richard Arnell wrote that Beecham preferred making records to giving concerts: &quot;He told me that audiences got in the way of music-making – he was apt to catch someone&#x27;s eye in the front row.&quot; The conductor and critic Trevor Harvey wrote in &quot;The Gramophone&quot;, however, that studio recordings could never recapture the thrill of Beecham performing live in the concert hall.
Beecham began making recordings in 1910, when the acoustical process obliged orchestras to use only principal instruments, placed as close to the recording horn as possible. His first recordings, for HMV, were of excerpts from Offenbach&#x27;s &quot;The Tales of Hoffmann&quot; and Johann Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot;. In 1915, Beecham began recording for the Columbia Graphophone Company. Electrical recording technology (introduced in 1925–26) made it possible to record a full orchestra with much greater frequency range, and Beecham quickly embraced the new medium. Longer scores had to be broken into four-minute segments to fit on 12-inch 78-rpm discs, but Beecham was not averse to recording piecemeal – his well-known 1932 disc of Chabrier&#x27;s &quot;España&quot; was recorded in two sessions three weeks apart. Beecham recorded many of his favourite works several times, taking advantage of improved technology over the decades.

From 1926 to 1932, Beecham made more than 70 discs, including an English version of Gounod&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot; and the first of three recordings of Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot;. He began recording with the London Philharmonic Orchestra in 1933, making more than 150 discs for Columbia, including music by Mozart, Rossini, Berlioz, Wagner, Handel, Beethoven, Brahms, Debussy and Delius. Among the most prominent of his pre-war recordings was the first complete recording of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, made for HMV and supervised by Walter Legge in Berlin in 1937–38, a set described by Alan Blyth in &quot;Gramophone&quot; magazine in 2006 as having &quot;a legendary status&quot;. In 1936, during his German tour with the LPO, Beecham conducted the world&#x27;s first orchestral recording on magnetic tape, made at Ludwigshafen, the home of BASF, the company that developed the process.

During his stay in the US and afterwards, Beecham recorded for American Columbia Records and RCA Victor. His RCA recordings include major works that he did not subsequently re-record for the gramophone, including Beethoven&#x27;s Fourth, Sibelius&#x27;s Sixth and Mendelssohn&#x27;s Reformation Symphonies. Some of his RCA recordings were issued only in the US, including Mozart&#x27;s Symphony No. 27, K199, the overtures to Smetana&#x27;s &quot;The Bartered Bride&quot; and Mozart&#x27;s &quot;La clemenza di Tito&quot;, the Sinfonia from Bach&#x27;s &quot;Christmas Oratorio&quot;, a 1947–48 complete recording of Gounod&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot;, and an RPO studio version of Sibelius&#x27;s Second Symphony. Beecham&#x27;s RCA records that were released on both sides of the Atlantic were his celebrated 1956 complete recording of Puccini&#x27;s &quot;La bohème&quot; and an extravagantly rescored set of Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot;. The former remains a top recommendation among reviewers, and the latter was described by &quot;Gramophone&quot; as &quot;an irresistible outrage … huge fun&quot;.

For the Columbia label, Beecham recorded his last, or only, versions of many works by Delius, including &quot;A Mass of Life&quot;, &quot;Appalachia&quot;, &quot;North Country Sketches&quot;, &quot;An Arabesque&quot;, &quot;Paris&quot; and &quot;Eventyr&quot;. Other Columbia recordings from the early 1950s include Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Eroica&quot;, &quot;Pastoral&quot; and Eighth symphonies, Mendelssohn&#x27;s &quot;Italian&quot; symphony, and the Brahms Violin Concerto with Isaac Stern.

From his return to England at the end of the Second World War until his final recordings in 1959, Beecham continued his early association with HMV and British Columbia, who had merged to form EMI. From 1955, his EMI recordings made in London were recorded in stereo. He also recorded in Paris, with his own RPO and with the Orchestra National de la Radiodiffusion Française, though the Paris recordings were in mono until 1958. For EMI, Beecham recorded two complete operas in stereo, &quot;Die Entführung aus dem Serail&quot; and &quot;Carmen&quot;. His last recordings were made in Paris in December 1959. Beecham&#x27;s EMI recordings have been continually reissued on LP and CD. In 2011, to mark the 50th anniversary of Beecham&#x27;s death, EMI released 34 CDs of his recordings of music from the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, including works by Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Brahms, Wagner, Richard Strauss and Delius, and many of the French &quot;lollipops&quot; with which he was associated.

==Relations with others==
Beecham&#x27;s relations with fellow British conductors were not always cordial. Sir Henry Wood regarded him as an upstart and was envious of his success; the scrupulous Sir Adrian Boult found him &quot;repulsive&quot; as a man and a musician; and Sir John Barbirolli mistrusted him. Sir Malcolm Sargent worked with him in founding the London Philharmonic and was a friend and ally, but he was the subject of unkind, though witty, digs from Beecham who, for example, described the image-conscious Herbert von Karajan as &quot;a kind of musical Malcolm Sargent&quot;. Beecham&#x27;s relations with foreign conductors were often excellent. He did not get on well with Arturo Toscanini, but he liked and encouraged Wilhelm Furtwängler, admired Pierre Monteux, fostered Rudolf Kempe as his successor with the RPO, and was admired by Fritz Reiner, Otto Klemperer and Karajan.

Despite his lordly drawl, Beecham remained a Lancastrian at heart. &quot;In &quot;my&quot; county, where &quot;I&quot; come from, we&#x27;re all a bit vulgar, you know, but there is a certain heartiness – a sort of bonhomie about our vulgarity – which tides you over a lot of rough spots in the path. But in &quot;Yorkshire&quot;, in a spot of bother, they&#x27;re so damn-set-in-their-ways that there&#x27;s no doing anything with them!&quot;

Beecham has been much quoted. In 1929, the editor of a music journal wrote, &quot;The stories gathered around Sir Thomas Beecham are innumerable. Wherever musicians come together, he is likely to be one of the topics of conversation. Everyone telling a Beecham story tries to imitate his manner and his tone of voice.&quot; A book, &quot;Beecham Stories&quot;, was published in 1978 consisting entirely of his &quot;bons mots&quot; and anecdotes about him. Some are variously attributed to Beecham or one or more other people, including Arnold Bax and Winston Churchill; Neville Cardus admitted to inventing some himself. Among the Beecham lines that are reliably attributed are, &quot;A musicologist is a man who can read music but can&#x27;t hear it&quot;; his maxim, &quot;There are only two things requisite so far as the public is concerned for a good performance: that is for the orchestra to begin together and end together; in between it doesn&#x27;t matter much&quot;; and his remark at his 70th birthday celebrations after telegrams were read out from Strauss, Stravinsky and Sibelius: &quot;Nothing from Mozart?&quot;

He was completely indifferent to mundane tasks such as correspondence, and was less than responsible with the property of others. On one occasion, during bankruptcy proceedings, two thousand unopened letters were discovered among his papers. Havergal Brian sent him three scores with a view to having them performed. One of them, the &quot;Second English Suite&quot;, was never returned and is now considered lost.

==Honours and commemorations==
Beecham was knighted in 1916 and succeeded to the baronetcy on the death of his father later that year. In 1938 the President of France, Albert Lebrun, invested him with the Légion d&#x27;honneur. In 1955, Beecham was presented with the Order of the White Rose of Finland. He was a Commendatore of the Order of the Crown of Italy and was made a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour in the 1957 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours. He was an honorary Doctor of Music of the universities of Oxford, London, Manchester and Montreal.

&quot;Beecham&quot;, by Caryl Brahms and Ned Sherrin, is a play celebrating the conductor and drawing on a large number of Beecham stories for its material. Its first production, in 1979, starred Timothy West in the title role. It was later adapted for television, starring West, with members of the Hallé Orchestra taking part in the action and playing pieces associated with Beecham.

In 1980 the Royal Mail put Beecham&#x27;s image on the 13½p postage stamp in a series portraying British conductors; the other three in the series depicted Wood, Sargent and Barbirolli. The Sir Thomas Beecham Society preserves Beecham&#x27;s legacy through its website and release of historic recordings.

In 2012, Beecham was voted into the inaugural &quot;Gramophone&quot; magazine &quot;Hall of Fame&quot;.

<text>The leisure industry is the segment of business focused on recreation, entertainment, sports, and tourism (REST)-related products and services.

The field has developed to the point of having university degrees and disciplines focused on it, such as the Cornell University School of Hotel Administration, Webber, and San Jose State University&#x27;s departments of hospitality, recreation and tourism management. Some universities offer leisure degrees, two of those universities can be found in the Netherlands: the Breda University of Applied Sciences and the NHLStenden University of Applied Sciences. Both offers bachelor&#x27;s in international leisure management, the latter of which is branded as International Leisure &amp; Events Management.

<text>A mirror image (in a plane mirror) is a reflected duplication of an object that appears almost identical, but is reversed in the direction perpendicular to the mirror surface. As an optical effect, it results from specular reflection off from surfaces of lustrous materials, especially a mirror or water. It is also a concept in geometry and can be used as a conceptualization process for 3D structures.

==In geometry and geometrical optics==

===In two dimensions===
In geometry, the mirror image of an object or two-dimensional figure is the virtual image formed by reflection in a plane mirror; it is of the same size as the original object, yet different, unless the object or figure has reflection symmetry (also known as a P-symmetry).

Two-dimensional mirror images can be seen in the reflections of mirrors or other reflecting surfaces, or on a printed surface seen inside-out. If we first look at an object that is effectively two-dimensional (such as the writing on a card) and then turn the card to face a mirror, the object turns through an angle of 180° and we see a left-right reversal in the mirror. In this example, it is the change in orientation rather than the mirror itself that causes the observed reversal. Another example is when we stand with our backs to the mirror and face an object that is in front of the mirror. Then we compare the object with its reflection by turning ourselves 180°, towards the mirror. Again we perceive a left-right reversal due to a change in our orientation. So, in these examples the mirror does not actually cause the observed reversals.

===In three dimensions===
The concept of reflection can be extended to three-dimensional objects, including the inside parts, even if they are not transparent. The term then relates to structural as well as visual aspects. A three-dimensional object is reversed in the direction perpendicular to the mirror surface. In physics, mirror images are investigated in the subject called geometrical optics. More fundamentally in geometry and mathematics they form the principal objects of Coxeter group theory and reflection groups.

In chemistry, two versions (isomers) of a molecule, one a &quot;mirror image&quot; of the other, are called enantiomers if they are not &quot;superposable&quot; (the correct technical term, though the term &quot;superimposable&quot; is also used) on each other. That is an example of chirality. In general, an object and its mirror image are called enantiomorphs.

If a point of an object has coordinates (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot;) then the image of this point (as reflected by a mirror in the &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot; plane) has coordinates (−&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot;). Thus reflection is a reversal of the coordinate axis perpendicular (normal) to the mirror&#x27;s surface. Although a plane mirror reverses an object only in the direction normal to the mirror surface, this turns the entire three-dimensional image seen in the mirror inside-out, so there is a &quot;perception&quot; of a left-right reversal. Hence, the reversal is somewhat misleadingly called a &quot;lateral inversion&quot;. The perception of a left-right reversal is geometrically explained by the fact that a three-dimensional object seen in a mirror is an inside-out version of the actual object, like a glove stripped off the left hand and turned into a right-hand glove, but there is still some confusion about the explanation amongst psychologists. The psychology of the perceived left-right reversal is discussed in &quot;Much ado about mirrors&quot; by Professor Michael Corballis (see &quot;external links&quot;, below).

Reflection in a mirror &quot;does&quot; result in a change in chirality, more specifically from a right-handed to a left-handed coordinate system (or vice versa). If one looks in a mirror two axes (up-down and left-right) coincide with those in the mirror, but the third axis (front-back) is reversed.

If a person stands side-on to a mirror, left and right hands will be reversed &quot;directly&quot; by the mirror, because the person&#x27;s left-right axis is then normal to the mirror plane. However, it is important to understand that there are &quot;always&quot; only two enantiomorphs, the object and its inside-out image. Therefore, no matter how the object is oriented towards the mirror, all the resulting images are fundamentally identical (as Corballis explains in his paper &quot;Much ado about mirrors&quot;, mentioned above).

In the picture of the mountain reflected in the lake (photograph top right), the reversal normal to the reflecting surface is obvious. Notice that there is no obvious front-back or left-right of the mountain. In the example of the urn and mirror (photograph to right), the urn is fairly symmetrical front-back (and left-right). Thus, no obvious reversal of any sort can be seen in the mirror image of the urn.

A mirror image appears more obviously three-dimensional if the observer moves, or if the image is viewed using binocular vision. This is because the relative position of objects changes as the observer&#x27;s perspective changes, or is differently viewed with each eye.

Looking through a mirror from different positions (but necessarily with the point of observation restricted to the halfspace on one side of the mirror) is like looking at the 3D mirror image of space; without further mirrors only the mirror image of the halfspace before the mirror is relevant; if there is another mirror, the mirror image of the other halfspace is too.

====Effect of mirror on the lighting of the scene====
A mirror does not just produce an image of what would be there without it; it also changes the light distribution in the halfspace in front of and behind the mirror. A mirror hanging on the wall makes the room brighter because additional light sources appear in the mirror image. However, the appearance of additional light does not violate the conservation of energy principle, because some light no longer reaches behind the mirror, as the mirror simply re-directs the light energy. In terms of the light distribution, the virtual mirror image has the same appearance and the same effect as a real, symmetrically arranged half-space behind a window (instead of the mirror). Shadows may extend from the mirror into the halfspace before it, and vice versa.

==Mirror writing==

In mirror writing a text is deliberately displayed as its mirror image, in order to be read through a mirror. For example, emergency vehicles such as ambulances or fire engines use mirror images in order to be read from a vehicle&#x27;s rear-view mirror. Some movie theaters also use mirror writing in a Rear Window Captioning System used to assist individuals with hearing impairments in watching films.

==Systems of mirrors==
In the case of two mirrors, in planes at an angle α, looking through both from the sector which is the intersection of the two halfspaces, is like looking at a version of the world rotated by an angle of 2α; the points of observations and directions of looking for which this applies correspond to those for looking through a frame like that of the first mirror, and a frame at the mirror image with respect to the first plane, of the second mirror. If the mirrors have vertical edges then the left edge of the field of view is the plane through the right edge of the first mirror and the edge of the second mirror which is on the right when looked at directly, but on the left in the mirror image.

In the case of two parallel mirrors, looking through both at once is like looking at a version of the world which is translated by twice the distance between the mirrors, in the direction perpendicular to them, away from the observer. Since the plane of the mirror in which one looks directly is beyond that of the other mirror, one always looks at an oblique angle, and the translation just mentioned has not only a component away from the observer, but also one in a perpendicular direction. The translated view can also be described by a translation of the observer in opposite direction. For example, with a vertical periscope, the shift of the world is away from the observer and down, both by the length of the periscope, but it is more practical to consider the equivalent shift of the observer: up, and backward.

It is also possible to create a non-reversing mirror by placing two first surface mirrors at 90º to give an image which is not reversed.

<text>Andrew Wyntoun, known as Andrew of Wyntoun (), was a Scottish poet, a canon and prior of Loch Leven on St Serf&#x27;s Inch and, later, a canon of St. Andrews.

Andrew Wyntoun is most famous for his completion of an eight-syllabled metre entitled, &quot;Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland&quot;, which contains an early mention of &quot;Robin Hood&quot;; it is also cited by the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; as the earliest work in English to use the word &quot;Catholic&quot;: [spelling modernised] &quot;He was a constant Catholic;/All Lollard he hated and heretic.&quot; Wyntoun wrote the &#x27;Chronicle&#x27; at the request of his patron, Sir John of Wemyss, whose representative, Mr. Erskine Wemyss of Wemyss Castle, Fife, possessed the oldest extant manuscript of the work. The subject of the &#x27;Chronicle&#x27; is the history of Scotland from the mythical period to the death of Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany in 1420.

The nine original manuscripts of the &quot;Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland&quot; still subsist today and are preserved within various facilities throughout the United Kingdom. Three out of the eight original manuscripts are currently preserved by the British Library, two are in the possession of the Advocates&#x27; Library in Edinburgh; one, within the University of St Andrews Library; another, within the confines of Wemyss Castle and the eighth, privately owned by Mister John Ferguson of Duns, Scottish Borders, Berwickshire. The first edition of the &#x27;Chronicle&#x27; (based on the Royal manuscript) was published by David Macpherson in 1795; the second edition was produced by David Laing and published in 1872 and the current standard edition was published by F. J. Amours as &quot;The Original Chronicle of Andrew of Wyntoun: Printed on Parallel Pages from the Cottonian and Wemyss MSS., with the Variants of the Other Texts&quot;.

The &quot;Chronicle&quot; is entirely composed of couplets, usually of eight syllables, although frequently there also are lines of six or 10 syllables.

<doc id="148239" wikidata="Q1335413" url="?curid=148239" title="John of Fordun">
<text>John of Fordun (before 1360 – c. 1384) was a Scottish chronicler. It is generally stated that he was born at Fordoun, Mearns. It is certain that he was a secular priest, and that he composed his history in the latter part of the 14th century. It is probable that he was a chaplain in St Machar&#x27;s Cathedral of Aberdeen.

The work of Fordun is the earliest attempt to write a continuous history of Scotland. Fordun undertook this task because his patriotic zeal was roused by the removal or destruction of many national records by Edward III of England. He travelled across England and Ireland, collecting material for his history.

Collectively, this work, divided into five books, is known as the &quot;Chronica Gentis Scotorum.&quot; The first three are unverified historically, which therefore casts doubt on their accuracy. Yet they also form the groundwork on which Boece and George Buchanan afterwards based some of their historical writings. Thomas Innes argued that some of the history these men presented was doubtful in his &quot;Critical Essay&quot; (i, pp.  201–204), but Innes himself had his own political agenda and his work has also been criticized by modern historians.

Fordun&#x27;s claim of an unbroken line of royal descent from Fergus I in 330 BC can be seen as a contribution to a Scottish national origin myth constructed to counter the legend of Brutus of Troy, which English monarchs deployed to claim sovereignty over the whole of Britain. The 4th and 5th books contain much valuable information, and become more authentic the nearer they approach the author&#x27;s own time. The 5th book concludes with the death of King David I in 1153.

More recent scholarship, largely by Professor Dauvit Broun of Glasgow University, suggests that the portion of what has hitherto been considered Fordun&#x27;s chronicle, i.e. events after 1153, should be regarded as two separate works, neither of which can, in any meaningful sense, be attributed to Fordun himself. Therefore, the list of yearly events after the death of King David I in 1153 should be regarded as the separate works &quot;Gesta Annalia I&quot; and &quot;Gesta Annalia II&quot;.

The new thinking, put forward by Professor Broun, is that John of Fordun&#x27;s work is the chronicle alone. So Fordun&#x27;s own work proceeds no later than the death of King David I in 1153. Therefore, Fordun cannot be regarded as the author of &quot;Gesta Annalia&quot; and that &quot;Gesta Annalia&quot; should be regarded as two separate works. This is because an examination of the surviving manuscripts reveals two separate texts which, for convenience are called &quot;Gesta Annalia I&quot; and &quot;Gesta Annalia II&quot;.

&quot;Gesta Annalia I&quot; ends when, in February 1285, King Alexander III despatches an embassy to France to find a new wife for him. ‘Gesta Annalia II’ begins with Alexander III&#x27;s marriage to his new bride in October 1285. It is considered that &quot;Gesta Annalia I&quot; is what remains extant of a much longer work. It is considered that the author of &quot;Gesta Annalia&quot; ended this work around February 1285. Then, at some point, a scribe copied &quot;Gesta Annalia I&quot; and appended it to Fordun&#x27;s chronicle. As to whether that scribe may have been Fordun himself and that he appended &quot;Gesta Annalia I&quot; to his own chronicle &quot;is an open question&quot;, according to Professor Broun.

Based on these suppositions, the &quot;Gesta Annalia I&quot; in circulation is a copy of an original work. However, it is considered that whoever copied the original work left it largely undisturbed, i.e. did not materially alter the text as there is a consistency of writing and presentation of the history in &quot;Gesta Annalia I&quot; which is not found to the same extent with &quot;Gesta Annalia II&quot;.

&quot;Gesta Annalia II&quot; is a more challenging, and it has been suggested more interesting, work. Whereas there is a consistency in the style and presentation of &quot;Gesta Annalia I&quot;, that is not the case in &quot;Gesta Annalia II&quot;.

Historical texts published before this new thinking was accepted will still refer to Fordun as the author of comments relating to the period after 1153. These comments are now cited as Gesta Annalia I or II. Besides these five books, published around 1360, Fordun also wrote part of another book, and collected materials to cover the history of Scotland to a later period. These materials were used by a continuator who wrote in the middle of the 15th century, and who is identified with Walter Bower, abbot of the monastery of Inchcolm. Bower&#x27;s additions form eleven books, and bring forward the narrative to the death of King James I of Scots in 1437. According to the custom of the time, the continuator did not hesitate to interpolate Fordun&#x27;s portion of the work with additions of his own. The whole history thus compiled is known as the &quot;Scotichronicon&quot;.

The first printed edition of Fordun&#x27;s work was that of Thomas Gale in his &quot;Scriptores quindecim&quot; (vol. iii), which was published in 1691. This was followed by Thomas Hearne&#x27;s (5 vol.) edition in 1722. The whole work, including Bower&#x27;s continuation, was published by Walter Goodall at Edinburgh in 1759.

In 1871 and 1872, Fordun&#x27;s chronicle, in the original Latin and in an English translation, was edited by William F. Skene in &quot;The Historians of Scotland&quot;. The preface to this edition collects all the biographical details and gives full references to manuscripts and editions.

<text>William Forbes Skene WS FRSE FSA(Scot) DCL LLD (7 June 1809 – 29 August 1892), was a Scottish lawyer, historian and antiquary.

He co-founded the Scottish legal firm Skene Edwards which was prominent throughout the 20th century but disappeared in 2008 when it merged with Morton Fraser.

==Life==

He was born in Inverey, the second son of Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s friend, James Skene (1775–1864), of Rubislaw, near Aberdeen, and his wife, Jane Forbes, daughter of Sir William Forbes, 6th Baronet of Pitsligo.

The family moved to Edinburgh in 1817, originally living with his uncle, Andrew Skene then from 1820 living at 126 Princes Street facing Edinburgh Castle.

He was educated at the High School in Edinburgh. He was then apprenticed as a lawyer first to Francis Wilson WS at Parliament Square then to Henry Jardine WS also at Parliament Square.

He then studied law at the University of St Andrews and Edinburgh University, also taking a special interest in the study of Celtic philology and literature. In 1832, he became a Writer to the Signet (WS), and shortly afterwards obtained an official appointment in the bill department of the Court of Session, which he held until 1865. His early interest in the history and antiquities of the Scottish Highlands bore its first fruit in 1837, when he published &quot;The Highlanders of Scotland, their Origin, History and Antiquities&quot;.

In 1847, during the Highland Potato Famine, he was appointed Secretary to the Central Board for Highland Relief. In this position he worked closely with Sir Charles Trevelyan, Assistant Secretary to the Treasury.

In 1859 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh his proposer being Cosmo Innes. He served as the society&#x27;s vice president from 1869 to 1871.

His chief work, however, is his &quot;Celtic Scotland, a History of Ancient Alban&quot; (3 vols., Edinburgh, 1876–1880), perhaps the most important contribution to Scottish history written during the 19th century. In 1879 he was made a Doctor of Civil Law (DCL) of the University of Oxford, and in 1881 Historiographer Royal for Scotland.

William Forbes Skene was a leading member of the congregation of St Vincent&#x27;s Scottish Episcopal Church in St Vincent Street in Stockbridge in north Edinburgh. He is commemorated there by a prominent memorial on the south wall of the nave. An avowed Evangelical, he had argued that, since the Scottish Episcopal Church&#x27;s General Synod of 1863 had established the English Book of Common Prayer as the primary authority for the Church&#x27;s worship and the Scottish Episcopal Church had adopted the Church of England&#x27;s Thirty Nine Articles as a doctrinal yardstick, for St Vincent&#x27;s to remain outside that church could no longer be justified.

In his final years he had offices at 5 Albyn Place on the Moray Estate and lived at 27 Inverleith Row.

He died unmarried and childless in Edinburgh on 29 August 1892. He is buried with his family in St Johns Episcopal Churchyard on Princes Street. The graves lie in the south-east chapel and are marked by a bronze plaque.

==Publications==

The most important of Skene&#x27;s other works are: editions of John of Fordun&#x27;s &quot;Chronica gentis Scotorum&quot; (Edinburgh, 1871–1872); of the &quot;Four Ancient Books of Wales&quot; (Edinburgh, 1868); of the &quot;Chronicles of the Picts and Scots&quot; (Edinburgh, 1867); and of Adomnán&#x27;s &quot;Vita S. Columbae&quot; (Edinburgh, 1874); an &quot;Essay on the Coronation Stone of Scone&quot; (Edinburgh, 1869); and &quot;Memorials of the Family of Skene of Skene&quot; (Aberdeen, 1887), &quot;Celtic Scotland&quot; (1880) One of Skene&#x27;s harshest critics was the Scottish philologist Alexander Macbain.

<text>Walter Bower (or Bowmaker; 24 December 1449) was a Scottish canon regular and abbot of Inchcolm Abbey in the Firth of Forth, who is noted as a chronicler of his era. He was born about 1385 at Haddington, East Lothian, in the Kingdom of Scotland. In 1991, Donald Watt said of Bower&#x27;s &quot;Scotichronicon&quot; that &quot;We are more and more convinced that this book 
is one of the national treasures of Scotland, which should be studied in depth for many different kinds of enquiry into Scotland&#x27;s past.&quot;

==Life==
Some sources say that, at the age of eighteen, Bower assumed the religious habit; he was trained at the University of St Andrews. After finishing his philosophical and theological studies, he visited Paris to study law. Bower was unanimously the abbot of the Augustinian community on Inchcolm in 1417. He also acted as one of the commissioners for the collection of the ransom of King James I of Scotland in 1423 and 1424. Later, in 1433, he took part in a diplomatic mission to Paris to discuss the possibility of marriage of the king&#x27;s daughter to the Dauphin of France. He played an important part at the Council of Perth of 1432 in the defence of Scottish rights.

During Bower&#x27;s closing years he was engaged on his work, the &quot;Scotichronicon&quot;, on which his reputation now chiefly rests. This work, undertaken in 1440 by desire of a neighbour, Sir David Stewart of Rosyth Castle, was a continuation of the &quot;Chronica Gentis Scotorum&quot; of John of Fordun. The completed work, in its original form, consisted of sixteen books, of which the first five and a portion of the sixth (to 1163) are Fordun&#x27;s — or mainly his, for Bower added to them in places. In the later books, down to the reign of Robert I (1371), he was aided by Fordun&#x27;s &quot;Gesta Annalia&quot;, but from that point to the close the work is original and of contemporary importance, especially for James I, with whose death it ends. The task was finished in 1447.

In the two remaining years of Bower&#x27;s life he was engaged on a reduction or &quot;abridgment&quot; of this work, which is known as the &quot;Book of Cupar&quot;, and is preserved in the Advocates Library, Edinburgh (MS. 35. 1. 7). Other abridgments, not by Bower, were made about the same time, one about 1450 (perhaps by Patrick Russell, a Carthusian monk of Perth), also preserved in the Advocates&#x27; library (MS. 35. 6. 7) and another in 1461 by an unknown writer, preserved in the same collection (MS. 35. 5. 2). Copies of the full text of the &quot;Scotichronicon&quot;, by different scribes, still exist. There are two in the British Library, in &quot;The Black Book of Paisley&quot;, and in Harley MS 712; one in the Advocates Library, from which Walter Goodall printed his edition (Edin., 1759), and one in the library of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge.

See also W. F. Skene&#x27;s edition of Fordun in the series of &quot;Historians of Scotland&quot; (1871). Personal references are to be found in the &quot;Exchequer Rolls of Scotland&quot;, iii. and iv.

A revised and updated translation of Bower&#x27;s work was produced under the leadership of Professor D. E. R. Watt, in nine volumes, published between 1987 and 1997. The critical edition of Bower&#x27;s Latin text in Watt et al. has been amended and corrected by Chris Nighman in light of the discovery that Bower made extensive use of Thomas of Ireland&#x27;s collection of authoritative quotations, the &quot;Manipulus florum&quot; (1306).

<doc id="148246" wikidata="Q7982215" url="?curid=148246" title="Wemyss Castle">
<text>Wemyss Castle (pronounced [weems]) is situated in Wemyss on the sea cliffs between the villages of East Wemyss and West Wemyss in Fife, Scotland. Wemyss Castle is considered to be a multi-period building, and today&#x27;s castle includes many elements from former periods such as the 15th-century tower and the 19th-century stables and gatepiers.

== History ==
Accounts date the construction of the castle to 1421 when Sir John Wemyss decided to build a fortified castle to replace one destroyed by the Duke of Rothesay at Kilconquhar in 1402. The castle is thus the ancient seat of the Earls of Wemyss and their families. Historically, the castle is perhaps best known as the location where Mary, Queen of Scots, met her future husband Lord Darnley, on 17 February 1565.

The court of James VI stayed at Wemyss Castle in July 1583. On 11 May 1590 a party of Danish commissioners led by Peder Munk and the Scottish lawyer John Skene stayed at Wemyss Castle. Their task was to view and take sasine of Falkland Palace and Dunfermline Palace and Linlithgow Palace, the properties given to Anne of Denmark by James VI as a &quot;morning gift&quot;.

In April 1591 King James had Lilias (or Sophia) Ruthven, a daughter of William Ruthven, 1st Earl of Gowrie, shut away in Wemyss Castle to prevent her marrying Ludovic Stewart, 2nd Duke of Lennox. Lennox managed to get his bride out of the castle and marry her at Dunkeld, and after 10 days the king allowed the couple to come to court.

In 1592 Sir John Wemyss of Wemyss provided a refuge at the castle for the queen&#x27;s Danish lady-in-waiting Margaret Vinstarr whose partner John Wemyss of Logie had plotted with Francis Stewart, 5th Earl of Bothwell against the king. The incident is celebrated in a ballad, &quot;The Laird o Logie&quot;.John Wemyss was obliged to keep prisoners for the king at Wemyss, including in 1597 Archie Armstrong of Whitehaugh from the Scottish borders. Wemyss and other Lairds complained about this duty, and in April James VI wrote to him and asked him to bring Armstrong as a prisoner to be kept at Falkland Palace instead.

In the 1890s the nearby Coaltown of Wemyss was established as an estate village on land belonging to Wemyss Castle, in order to house mineworkers employed in several coal mines in the area.

== Architecture ==
Wemyss is an imposing castle sitting high atop cliffs with a view over the Firth of Forth. Two particular points of interest are that one of the towers from an earlier building has been re-used, first as a windmill and later as a dovecote. There is also an oval-shaped dungeon within the castle, connected to the building by a passage. 

== Ghostlore==
Some believe Wemyss possesses, like a number of Scottish castles, a &quot;Green Lady&quot;. Folk beliefs in Scotland and Britain have traditionally associated the colour green with misfortune. Wearing green at a wedding was considered particularly unlucky, with a Scottish saying recorded in 1892 explaining that &quot;Married in May, and kirked in green / Baith bride and bridegroom winna lang be seen&quot;. In the case of Wemyss, the ghost is that of a young woman wearing a trailing dress of green silk which rustles as she floats along the corridors within the castle. A news report in 2007 suggested that sightings had ceased in recent years.

<text>Earl of Wemyss ( ) is a title in the Peerage of Scotland created in 1633. The Scottish Wemyss family had possessed the lands of Wemyss in Fife since the 12th century. Since 1823 the earldom has been held with the Earldom of March, created in 1697. The holder of the title is sometimes known as the Earl of Wemyss and March, but the titles are distinct.

==History==

In 1625 John Wemyss was created a Baronet, of Wemyss in the County of Fife, in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia. In 1628 he was raised to the Peerage of Scotland as Lord Wemyss of Elcho, and in 1633 he was further honoured when he was made Lord Elcho and Methel and Earl of Wemyss, also in the Peerage of Scotland. He later supported the Scottish parliament against Charles I, and died in 1649. He was succeeded by his son David, the second Earl.

In 1672 David resigned his peerages to the Crown in return for a new patent with original precedency and extending the limitation to his daughters. Lord Wemyss had no male issue and on his death in 1679 the baronetcy became extinct. He was succeeded in the peerages according to the new patent by his daughter Margaret, the third Countess of Wemyss. She married as her first husband her third cousin twice removed Sir James Wemyss, Lord Burntisland. He was the son of General Sir James Wemyss of Caskieberry, grandson of James Wemyss, younger brother of Sir John Wemyss, great-grandfather of the first Earl of Wemyss. She was succeeded by her son from her first marriage, David, the fourth Earl. He served as Lord High Admiral of Scotland and sat in the House of Lords as a Scottish representative peer from 1707 to 1710. Lord Wemyss married Lady Anne Douglas, daughter of William Douglas, 1st Duke of Queensberry and sister of William Douglas, 1st Earl of March (see below).

On his death the titles passed to his second but eldest surviving son James, the fifth Earl. He married the great heiress Janet Charteris, daughter of Colonel Francis Charteris, who had made a large fortune by gambling and was noted for the rape of Anne Bond. Their eldest son David, Lord Elcho, was implicated in the Jacobite rising of 1745, and was consequently attainted. On his father&#x27;s death in 1756 he was not allowed to succeed to the peerages, but nonetheless assumed the title of Earl of Wemyss. Lord Elcho died childless and the peerages would have but for the attainder devolved upon his younger brother Francis, the &quot;soi disant&quot; seventh Earl, who nevertheless assumed the title. He assumed the surname of Charteris in lieu of Wemyss on being made heir his maternal grandfather Colonel Charteris&#x27;s estate. His successor was his grandson Francis, the &quot;soi disant&quot; eighth Earl (the son of Francis Charteris, Lord Elcho).

In 1790 the family commissioned a large townhouse at 64 Queen Street, Edinburgh, a bay wider than the already large adjacent townhouses.
In 1810, upon the death of William Douglas, 4th Duke of Queensberry and 3rd Earl of March, Francis Wemyss-Charteris succeeded as fourth Earl of March, fourth Viscount of Peebles and fourth Lord Douglas of Neidpath, Lyne and Munard as the lineal heir male of the aforementioned Lady Anne Douglas, sister of the first Earl of March (see below). On his accession to these titles he assumed the surname of Charteris-Wemyss-Douglas. In 1821 he was created Baron Wemyss, of Wemyss in the County of Fife, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. In 1826 he also obtained a reversal of the attainder of the earldom of Wemyss via the (7 Geo. 4. c. &quot;49&quot; ) and became the eighth Earl of Wemyss.

He was succeeded by his son, the ninth Earl of Wemyss and fifth Earl of March. He served as Lord-Lieutenant of Peeblesshire from 1853 to 1880. When he died the titles passed to his son, the tenth Earl. He represented Gloucestershire and Haddingtonshire in the House of Commons for many years. He was succeeded by his fifth but eldest surviving son, the eleventh Earl. He sat as Conservative Member of Parliament for Haddingtonshire and Ipswich and served as Lord-Lieutenant of Haddingtonshire from 1918 to 1937. the titles are held by the thirteenth Earl of Wemyss and ninth Earl of March, who succeeded in 2008. He is also Chief of Clan Charteris.

Several other members of the Wemyss, later Charteris, family, have also gained distinction. William Wemyss (1760–1822), son of the Hon. James Wemyss (1726–1786), third son of the fifth Earl, was a Lieutenant-General in the Army. His elder son James Erskine Wemyss (1789–1854) was a Rear-Admiral in the Royal Navy and the grandfather of Admiral of the Fleet Rosslyn Erskine-Wemyss, 1st Baron Wester Wemyss (12 April 186424 May 1933), known as Sir Rosslyn Wemyss between 1916 and 1919. William Wemyss (1790–1852), younger son of the aforementioned William Wemyss, was a Lieutenant-General in the Army. William Binfield Wemyss (1810–1890), son of James Wemyss (1778–1849), younger son of the aforementioned the Hon. James Wemyss, was a General in the Army. The Hon. Frederick William Charteris (1833–1887), third son of the ninth Earl, was a captain in the Royal Navy. The Hon. Sir Evan Edward Charteris (1864–1940), sixth son of the tenth Earl, was a historian, biographer and barrister and notably published biographies of John Singer Sargent and of Edmund Gosse. The Hon. Martin Michael Charles Charteris, second son of the aforementioned Captain Hugo Francis Charteris, Lord Elcho, eldest son of the eleventh Earl, was private secretary to Queen Elizabeth II and was created a life peer as Baron Charteris of Amisfield in 1978. Hugo Charteris (1922–1970), grandson of the eleventh Earl, was a renowned post-war novelist and screenwriter. His son, Jamie Charteris, became a successful cartoonist.

The family seat is Gosford House near Longniddry, East Lothian. The family also owns Stanway House in Gloucestershire, Neidpath Castle near Peebles and Elcho Castle near Perth.

<doc id="148249" wikidata="Q651680" url="?curid=148249" title="Alkaptonuria">
<text>Alkaptonuria is a rare inherited genetic disease which is caused by a mutation in the &quot;HGD&quot; gene for the enzyme homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase (); if a person inherits an abnormal copy from both parents (it is a recessive condition), the body accumulates an intermediate substance called homogentisic acid in the blood and tissues. Homogentisic acid and its oxidized form &quot;alkapton&quot; are excreted in the urine, giving it an unusually dark color. The accumulating homogentisic acid causes damage to cartilage (ochronosis, leading to osteoarthritis) and heart valves, as well as precipitating as kidney stones and stones in other organs. Symptoms usually develop in people over 30 years old, although the dark discoloration of the urine is present from birth.

Apart from treatment of the complications (such as pain relief and joint replacement for the cartilage damage), the drug nitisinone has been found to suppress homogentisic acid production, and research is ongoing as to whether it can improve symptoms. Alkaptonuria is a rare disease; it occurs in one in 250,000 people, but is more common in Slovakia and the Dominican Republic.

==Signs and symptoms==

Patients with alkaptonuria are asymptomatic as children or young adults, but their urine may turn brown or even inky black if collected and left exposed to open air. Pigmentation may be noted in the cartilage of the ear and other cartilage, and the sclera and corneal limbus of the eye.

After the age of 30, people begin to develop pain in the weight-bearing joints of the spine, hips, and knees. The pain can be severe to the point that interferes with activities of daily living and may affect the ability to work. Joint-replacement surgery (hip and shoulder) is often necessary at a relatively young age. In the longer term, the involvement of the spinal joints leads to reduced movement of the rib cage and can affect breathing. Bone mineral density may be affected, increasing the risk of bone fractures, and rupture of tendons and muscles may occur.

Valvular heart disease, mainly calcification and regurgitation of the aortic and mitral valves, may occur, and in severe and progressive cases, valve replacement may be necessary. Irregularities in the heart rhythm and heart failure affect a significant proportion of people with alkaptonuria (40% and 10%, respectively). Hearing loss affects 40% of people. Also, a propensity to developing kidney stones exists, and eventually also gallstones and stones in the prostate and salivary glands (sialolithiasis) can occur.

==Pathophysiology==

All people carry in their DNA two copies (one received from each parent) of the gene &quot;HGD&quot;, which contains the genetic information to produce the enzyme homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase (HGD) which can normally be found in numerous tissues in the body (liver, kidney, small intestine, colon, and prostate). In people with alkaptonuria, both copies of the gene contain abnormalities that mean that the body cannot produce an adequately functioning enzyme. &quot;HGD&quot; mutations are generally found in certain parts (exons 6, 8, 10, and 13), but a total of over 100 abnormalities has been described throughout the gene. The normal HGD enzyme is a hexamer (it has six subunits) that are organized in two groups of three (two trimers) and contains an iron atom. Different mutations may affect the structure, function, or solubility of the enzyme. Very occasionally, the disease appears to be transmitted in an autosomal-dominant fashion, where a single abnormal copy of &quot;HGD&quot; from a single parent is associated with alkaptonuria; other mechanisms or defects in other genes possibly are responsible in those cases.
The HGD enzyme is involved in the metabolism (chemical processing) of the aromatic amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine. Normally, these enter the bloodstream through protein-containing food and the natural turnover of protein in the body. Tyrosine is specifically required for a number of functions, such as hormones (e.g. thyroxine, the thyroid hormone), melanin (the dark pigment in the skin and hair), and certain proteins, but the vast majority (over 95%) is unused and is metabolized through a group of enzymes that eventually generate acetoacetate and malate. In alkaptonuria, the HGD enzyme cannot metabolize the homogentisic acid (generated from tyrosine) into 4-maleylacetoacetate, and homogentisic acid levels in the blood are 100-fold higher than would normally be expected, despite the fact that a substantial amount is eliminated into the urine by the kidneys.

The homogentisic acid is converted to the related substance benzoquinone acetic acid which forms polymers that resemble the skin pigment melanin. These are deposited in the collagen, a connective tissue protein, of particular tissues such as cartilage. This process is called ochronosis (as the tissue looks ochre); ochronotic tissue is stiffened and unusually brittle, impairing its normal function and causing damage.

==Diagnosis==
If the diagnosis of alkaptonuria is suspected, it can be confirmed or excluded by collecting urine for 24 hours and determining the amount of homogentisic acid by means of chromatography. No assay of HGA in blood has been validated. The Genetic Testing Registry is used for maintaining information about the genetic test for alkaptonuria.

The severity of the symptoms and response to treatment can be quantified through a validated questionnaire titled the AKU Severity Score Index. This assigns scores to the presence of particular symptoms and features, such as the presence of eye and skin pigmentation, joint pain, heart problems, and organ stones.

==Treatment==
In 2012 the AKU Society formed a consortium called DevelopAKUre to prove that nitisinone, a drug already approved for treating another rare disease, hereditary tyrosinaemia type-1, could be repurposed to treat AKU.

The DevelopAKUre trials concluded in 2019 and successfully illustrated that nitisinone lowered levels of homogentisic acid (HGA), the acid that causes the damage in AKU, by 99% which effectively halts the progression of the disease. In 2020, the European Medicines Agency and the European Commission approved the use of nitisinone for treating AKU making the treatment available to patients across the Europe and the UK.

Nitisinone has revolutionised the treatment of AKU, however it can lead to a condition known as hypertyrosinaemia caused by elevated levels of the amino acid tyrosine. Hypertyrosinaemia can lead to serious symptoms including corneal keratopathy, dermal toxicity, neurodevelopment delay issues in children, and alterations of wider metabolism. There is currently no effective treatment for hypertyrosinaemia other than limiting protein intake. Due to the potential side-effects of nitisinone treatment it is currently only prescribed to children aged 16 and above in Europe and patients will then have to follow a protein restricted diet and closely manage their tyrosine levels through frequent monitoring.

==Prognosis==
Alkaptonuria does not appear to affect life expectancy, although the latest study on the topic is from 1985. The main impact is on quality of life; many people with alkaptonuria have disabling symptoms such as pain, poor sleep, and breathing symptoms. These generally start in the fourth decade. The typical age at requiring joint replacement surgery is 50–55 years.

==Epidemiology==
In most ethnic groups, the prevalence of alkaptonuria is between 1:100,000 and 1:250,000. In Slovakia and the Dominican Republic, the disease is much more common, with prevalence estimated at 1:19,000 people. As for Slovakia, this is not the result of a single mutation, but due to a group of 12 mutations in specific &quot;hot spots&quot; of the &quot;HGD&quot; gene. The Slovakian clustering probably arose in a small area in the northwest of the country and spread after the 1950s due to migration.

==History==
Alkaptonuria was one of the four diseases described by Archibald Edward Garrod, as being the result of the accumulation of intermediates due to metabolic deficiencies. He linked ochronosis with the accumulation of alkaptans in 1902, and his views on the subject, including its mode of heritance, were summarized in a 1908 Croonian Lecture at the Royal College of Physicians. The genetics of it was also studied by William Bateson in the 1902.

The defect was narrowed down to homogentisic acid oxidase deficiency in a study published in 1958. The genetic basis was elucidated in 1996, when&quot; HGD&quot; mutations were demonstrated.

A 1977 study showed that an ochronotic Egyptian mummy had probably suffered from alkaptonuria.
==Society and culture==
The AKU Society is a charity which support all people affected by AKU. Based in the UK, the charity can be contacted here. It has a number of international AKU sister societies who provide support across the world and can be.

The AKU Society works to provide information, education, support, and helps people to access treatment for their condition. A number of support resources are available here and they have also been translated into all major languages here

As part of the DevelopAKUre consortium, the AKU Society successfully proved the effectiveness of nitisinone to treat AKU, leading to the drug receiving approval from the European Medicines Agency in 2020. The AKU Society continues to drive research into developing potential treatments and cures for AKU working closely with a number of universities across the world.

==Research directions==
Research collaborations by several national centres have been established to find a more definitive treatment for alkaptonuria. This has included studies on the use of nitisinone and investigations into antioxidants to inhibit ochronosis. The ideal treatment would replace HGD enzyme function without accumulating other substances.

<text>The Czech Philharmonic () is a symphony orchestra based in Prague. Its principal performing venue is the Rudolfinum concert hall.

==History==
The name &quot;Czech Philharmonic Orchestra&quot; appeared for the first time in 1894, as the title of the orchestra of the Prague National Theatre. It played its first concert under its current name on 4 January 1896 when Antonín Dvořák conducted his own compositions, but it did not become fully independent from the opera until 1901. The first representative concert took place on 15 October 1901 conducted by Ludvík Čelanský, the first artistic director of the orchestra. In 1908, Gustav Mahler led the orchestra in the world premiere of his Symphony No. 7. The orchestra first became internationally known during the principal conductorship of Václav Talich, who held the post from 1919 to 1931, and again from 1933 to 1941. In 1941, Talich and the orchestra made a controversial journey to Germany, where they performed Bedřich Smetana&#x27;s &quot;My Country&quot; in a concert enforced by the German offices.

Subsequent chief conductors included Rafael Kubelík (1942–1948), Karel Ančerl (1950–1968), Václav Neumann (1968–1989), Jiří Bělohlávek (1990–1992), Gerd Albrecht (1993–1996), Vladimir Ashkenazy (1996–2003), Zdeněk Mácal (2003–2007), and Eliahu Inbal (2009–2012). In the wake of the Velvet Revolution, under new conditions of financial insecurity, the orchestra reorganised in 1991 and controversially voted to appoint Gerd Albrecht its new chief conductor and to dismiss Bělohlávek. Instead of remaining until Albrecht&#x27;s accession, Bělohlávek resigned from the orchestra in 1992. In December 2010, the orchestra announced the reappointment of Bělohlávek as chief conductor, beginning in 2012, with an initial contract of 4 years. The orchestra&#x27;s official English name changed from the &quot;Czech Philharmonic Orchestra&quot; to the &quot;Czech Philharmonic&quot; at the beginning of 2015. In January 2017, the orchestra announced the extension of Bělohlávek&#x27;s contract through the 2021–2022 season. Bělohlávek continued to serve as the orchestra&#x27;s chief conductor until his death on 31 May 2017.

In 2013, Semyon Bychkov first guest-conducted the orchestra, which subsequently named him director of its Tchaikovsky Project. In October 2017, the orchestra announced the appointment of Bychkov as its next chief conductor and music director, effective with the 2018–2019 season. In September 2022, the orchestra announced the extension of Bychkov&#x27;s contract through 2028.

Past principal guest conductors of the orchestra have included Sir Charles Mackerras and Manfred Honeck. Jakub Hrůša is the orchestra&#x27;s current &#x27;permanent guest conductor&#x27;, as of the 2015–2016 season. In October 2017, the orchestra announced the appointments of Hrůša and of Tomáš Netopil as joint principal guest conductors of the orchestra, effective with the 2018–2019 season. In February 2024, the orchestra announced the appointment of Sir Simon Rattle as its next principal guest conductor, for a period of five years, with the title of &#x27;Rafael Kubelík Conducting Chair&#x27;. In April 2024, the orchestra announced that Bychkov is to stand down as its chief conductor and music director at the close of the 2027-2028 season.

The Czech Philharmonic&#x27;s first phonograph recording dates from 1929, when Václav Talich recorded &quot;My Country&quot; for the British His Master&#x27;s Voice label. The orchestra recordings are most often released on the Supraphon label.

==Honours and awards==

The Czech Philharmonic has won many awards, ten Grand Prix du Disque de l&#x27;Académie Charles Cros, five Grand Prix du disque de l&#x27;Académie française and several Cannes Classical Awards. The Czech Philharmonic was nominated for Grammy Awards in 2005, and also two Wiener Flötenuhr awards, with Pavel Štěpán, Zdeněk Mácal and Václav Neumann (1971 and 1982). It was voted 20th place of the top 20 best orchestras in the world in a 2008 survey by &quot;Gramophone&quot; magazine.

<text>The City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra (CBSO) is a British orchestra based in Birmingham, England. It is the resident orchestra at Symphony Hall, Birmingham in Birmingham, which has been its principal performance venue since 1991. Its administrative and rehearsal base is at the nearby CBSO Centre, where it also presents chamber concerts by members of the orchestra and guest performers.

Each year, the CBSO performs more than 150 concerts in Birmingham, the UK and around the world. With a far-reaching community programme and a family of choruses and youth ensembles, it is involved in every aspect of music-making in the Midlands. At its centre is a team of 90 professional musicians, and over a 100-year tradition of making music, in the heart of Birmingham. The CBSO has four choirs – the CBSO Chorus, Youth Chorus, Children&#x27;s Chorus and SO Vocal (our un-auditioned community choir). The CBSO Choruses are directed by Simon Halsey, Chorus Director, who celebrated his 40-year anniversary with the CBSO in the 2023 season. The Children&#x27;s and Youth Chorus are led by Julian Wilkins, Associate Chorus Director. SO Vocal is conducted by Lucy Hollins.

The current music director of the CBSO is Kazuki Yamada, who became chief conductor and artistic adviser in April 2023, and music director in May 2024.

== History ==
=== Background and foundation ===

The earliest orchestral concerts known to have taken place in Birmingham were those organized by Barnabas Gunn at the Moor Street Theatre in 1740, and more than 20 separate orchestras are recorded as having existed in the city between that date and the foundation of what is now the CBSO in 1920. These orchestras often owed their origins to Birmingham&#x27;s internationally significant tradition of choral music, that give birth to works such as Mendelsohn&#x27;s &quot;Elijah&quot; and Elgar&#x27;s &quot;Dream of Gerontius&quot;, and in 1834 saw the building Birmingham Town Hall, one of Europe&#x27;s earliest large-scale concert halls. Birmingham&#x27;s most notable early orchestra was the Birmingham Festival Orchestra, which formed as a group of 25 musicians in 1768 but by 1834 had grown into an orchestra of 147. Under Michael Costa and Hans Richter between 1849 and 1909 it included some of the leading instrumentalists of its day from across Britain and Europe, but remained an &quot;ad hoc&quot; grouping that assembled to play only at the three-yearly festivals. The town&#x27;s first permanently established orchestra of locally based professional musicians was William Stockley&#x27;s Orchestra, which was founded in 1856 and held annual concert seasons between 1873 and 1897. This was eclipsed as the city&#x27;s leading orchestra at the end of the 19th century by George Halford&#x27;s Orchestra, which put on similar series of concerts between 1897 and 1909.
Stockley and Halford established regular orchestral concerts as an expected feature of life in Birmingham which by the late 19th century supported a substantial pool of high quality locally based professional musicians. Between 1905 and 1920 this demand was met by a number of competing enterprises. Halford&#x27;s players reformed in 1906 as the self-governing Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, which continued to perform until 1918 under notable conductors including Henry Wood, Hans Richter and Halford himself. Landon Ronald presented an annual season of promenade concerts at the Theatre Royal in New Street from 1905 to 1914 with a 70-strong orchestra made up largely of Birmingham-based musicians. Appleby Matthews and Richard Wassell both ran separate orchestras in their own names presenting annual series of concerts between 1916 and 1920; and Thomas Beecham conducted and promoted his own New Birmingham Orchestra between 1917 and 1919.

From 1916 onwards, a group of influential local figures began to pursue the idea of a single, permanent, municipally funded orchestra, in keeping with the Civic Gospel tradition established in Birmingham under Joseph Chamberlain, that envisaged cities as having responsibility as a body for their citizens&#x27; civic, social and cultural welfare. Leading members of this campaign included Neville Chamberlain, who was Lord Mayor of Birmingham from 1916 to 1918; Granville Bantock, composer and Professor of Music at the University of Birmingham; and Ernest Newman, a leading Birmingham-based music critic, who had written as early as 1913 that the system of financial guarantees from wealthy patrons that had supported Birmingham&#x27;s orchestras through the 19th century had become discredited. The group&#x27;s first plan was to support Beecham&#x27;s New Birmingham Orchestra, but this enterprise was wound up after the government requisitioned the Town Hall for the issue of First World War ration books, depriving it of its primary concert venue. A few weeks after the end of the war Bantock revived the idea and on 17 March 1919 he submitted a proposal to Birmingham City Council for an orchestra of 70 musicians to be engaged annually from October to May, at an estimated annual cost of £8,500 and with projected annual revenue of £6,000. The city council agreed to support the proposal with an annual grant of £1,250 for an experimental period of five years, the first time that public funds had been used to support an orchestra anywhere in Great Britain.

=== Early years under Matthews ===

The new orchestra&#x27;s management committee met for the first time on 19 June 1919 and named itself the City of Birmingham Orchestra or CBO, probably to emphasise its civic status, though it also made clear that the CBO would be a self-governing musical body, not a municipal orchestra along the lines of those commonly found in seaside resorts. During its early years the orchestra was sometimes referred to as the Birmingham City Orchestra, or commonly just the &quot;City Orchestra&quot;. Thomas Beecham was considered to be the most suitable candidate for the Principal Conductor role, but he was pre-occupied with his own acute financial problems and had not forgiven the city for its failure to support his earlier New Birmingham Orchestra. As a result, a shortlist of four candidates was drawn up from the numerous applications for the post, though the initial one-year contract came to limit the choice to local applicants. The eventual appointee was Appleby Matthews, who had been running his own orchestra in the city since 1916 and had strong support from local music critics on the selection panel. Richard Wassell was appointed as Assistant Conductor.
Matthews&#x27; plan was to hold eight Saturday concerts and six Wednesday concerts each year at Birmingham Town Hall, with a series of 38 concerts of more popular programmes at cheaper venues on Sundays, continuing the tradition of Sunday popular classics established by his own orchestra over the previous five years. The orchestra first rehearsed at 9.30am on 4 September 1920, in the band room at the Birmingham City Police&#x27;s Steelhouse Lane station. The CBO&#x27;s first concert was given under Matthews&#x27; baton as part of the Sunday series at the Theatre Royal on 5 September 1920, with the first piece of music performed being Granville Bantock&#x27;s &quot;Saul&quot;. After two months of preparing the orchestra with the popular concerts, the inaugural concert of the Symphony Concerts series was given at the Town Hall on 10 November 1920, with Edward Elgar conducting a concert of his own works, including his Cello Concerto with Felix Salmond as the soloist. The first season continued with a remarkable series of programmes, including Ralph Vaughan Williams conducting his own &quot;London Symphony&quot;, Hamilton Harty conducting Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;Symphonie fantastique&quot;, Adrian Boult conducting Rachmaninov&#x27;s Second Symphony, Landon Ronald conducting Brahms&#x27; Second Symphony and Jean Sibelius conducting his own Third Symphony. Two features that would become longstanding traditions for the orchestra were also established during this first year: performances of then-recent works by Holst, Vaughan Williams and Bax saw a strong representation of new music in the orchestra&#x27;s programmes; and from February 1921 the orchestra&#x27;s commitment to musical education was underlined with a series of concerts for city schoolchildren held in the Town Hall on Saturday afternoons.

Matthews had originally been appointed to be conductor with a fee of £450 for 30 concerts, but had persuaded the committee to give him instead the combined role of conductor, secretary and manager for a fee of £1,000 per year. He had only limited experience in any of these roles, however, and developed a difficult relationship with the politicians and businessmen who made up the CBO committee. His plan to supplement the playing strength of the orchestra with members of the Birmingham City Police band almost caused the orchestra to strike before it had even played a concert, and resulted in questions being asked in the House of Commons in December 1920. Matthews&#x27; conducting and his management were both poorly reviewed by Birmingham-based critics, though reviews from outside the city were more positive, with &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; being highly complimentary and the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; concluding &quot;Manchester may well envy Birmingham its municipal music&quot;. Matthews&#x27; Symphony Series programmes were highly ambitious and enterprising, and he was able to claim that &quot;the amount subscribed for Symphony Concerts constituted a record for any similar series of concerts in this city&quot; but the Sunday concerts were loss-making, with the expensive seats often unsold. In 1922 Matthews was relieved of any involvement in the financial administration of the orchestra, popular concerts were increasingly moved to suburban and out-of-town venues, and development and marketing plans were drawn up to stem a deficit which by May 1923 grown to £3,000. In July the orchestra and Matthews both engaged solicitors and in October Matthews was informed his contract was to be terminated, His final CBO concert was on 30 March 1924, and the relationship dissolved in acrimonious and expensive litigation.

=== Boult and the first &quot;golden period&quot; ===

The CBO committee had two candidates in mind to replace Matthews: Eugene Goossens and Adrian Boult. For a while the committee explored the possibility of appointing both as joint conductors, but were convinced by Ernest de Sélincourt that this idea was unworkable. Boult had recently replaced Henry Wood as the conductor of the Birmingham Festival Choral Society – possibly calculating that there might shortly be a vacancy with the City Orchestra – and in March 1924 he was announced in the press as the CBO&#x27;s new Director and Conductor. At the age of 35 he already had a substantial international musical reputation, having studied at the Leipzig Conservatory under Arthur Nikisch, conducted the world premier of Holst&#x27;s &quot;The Planets&quot; at the age of 25, and worked for a period as chief conductor of Sergei Diaghilev&#x27;s Ballets Russes. The urbane, Oxford-educated Boult was also comfortable dealing with influential local citizens, ensuring the orchestra retained the financial support it needed to continue. His tenure at the CBO would mark the start of a &quot;golden period&quot; for the orchestra that would see it rise to national prominence, outshining the struggling London orchestras and establishing Boult himself as a major figure of British musical life.

Boult brought a wider vision for the orchestra&#x27;s future, building on Matthews&#x27; foundations but expanding beyond them. Some of the leading conductors in Europe were brought in to guest conduct, including Bruno Walter, Pierre Monteux, Ernest Ansermet and Ernő Dohnányi. Boult introduced lunchtime concerts at the Town Hall, inaugurated lectures about forthcoming music on the Thursdays before symphony concerts, invited students from the University of Birmingham to attend open rehearsals, and introduced free concerts for children during school hours. The orchestra made its first commercial recording in 1925. A more unusual experiment took place later the same year, when Saint-Saëns&#x27; Second Piano Concerto was performed at the Town Hall with Harold Bauer as soloist, but with his part played not with him present but as a pre-recorded piano roll. A particular concern of Boult&#x27;s was to reduce the effect of the summer break when, as with London&#x27;s Queen&#x27;s Hall Orchestra and Manchester&#x27;s Hallé Orchestra, the CBO&#x27;s musicians spent the summer working at seaside resorts and often picked up bad habits freelancing for pier orchestras. The committee felt unable at that time to meet Boult&#x27;s desire to offer players permanent year-round contracts, but Boult tried to lessen the length of the break by initiating performances at public schools throughout the Midlands. and building up the orchestra&#x27;s diary of out-of-town concerts.

In a review of Boult&#x27;s first season, the critic A. J. Sheldon of the &quot;Birmingham Post&quot; wrote of the immediate impact of Boult&#x27;s arrival:

: &quot;The strongest impression is of a very great gain in note accuracy, a much improved ensemble, and a high standard of playing from the string group. The advance made within a single season is so considerable as to be remarkable.&quot; 

The orchestra also moved into more adventurous repertoire, such as performing Bartók&#x27;s &quot;Dance Suite&quot; less than a year after its composition, while the composer was little-known in England. The CBO&#x27;s performance of Mahler&#x27;s Fourth Symphony in 1926 was only the third performance of any Mahler symphony given in Britain, and that of &quot;Das Lied von der Erde&quot; was only the second time it had been performed in England. Both were followed shortly afterwards by performances by orchestras in London and marked the start of the gradual increase in interest in Mahler&#x27;s work in Britain.

By 1926, the orchestra&#x27;s finances had improved, helped by the City Council&#x27;s decision in 1924 to allow Birmingham Town Hall to be used rent-free for the Symphony concerts and in 1925 to double the CBO&#x27;s grant to £2,500 annually. Less positive was the collapse in October 1925 of the Town Hall&#x27;s ceiling, leading the orchestra to move its concerts temporarily to Central Hall on Corporation Street. Expenditure on repairing the Town Hall put back prospects of the new concert hall that Boult had been promised, and the reconfiguration of the hall from one gallery to two – engineered by London-based architect Charles Allom without consulting any local musicians – created acoustic problems that would dog the orchestra until its move to Symphony Hall six decades later: the &quot;Birmingham Post&quot; wrote that &quot;everything sounded strange&quot; and complained of acoustic dead spots in the ground floor and lower gallery.

One aspect of Boult&#x27;s time at the CBO was the development of an important relationship with the recently established BBC. The CBO&#x27;s concert at Birmingham Town Hall on 7 October 1924 was the first orchestral concert anywhere in the world to be transmitted as an outside broadcast, and in 1924 and early 1925 the CBO was used to perform four &quot;International Symphony Concerts&quot; at Covent Garden in London, supplementing the BBC&#x27;s own &quot;Wireless Players&quot; to form the &quot;Wireless Symphony Orchestra&quot;, the forerunner of the BBC Symphony Orchestra. In 1927 the relationship became more problematic as the BBC stopped broadcasting CBO concerts as a result of national dispute with the Musicians Union, and in 1928 upgraded the orchestra at its Birmingham station, luring sixteen of the CBO&#x27;s most important players away with full-time contracts. In May 1929 the BBC went a stage further, when the retirement of its Music Director Percy Pitt saw Boult offered the role as his replacement. Boult was happy in Birmingham and had planned to stay at least another ten years, but was encouraged to accept the BBC role by Henry Wood. He resisted John Reith&#x27;s pressure to take up the BBC post immediately and agreed instead to perform a further final season with the CBO. He later said he regretted leaving Birmingham, which provided the only time in his career he was able to fully control his own programmes.

===Consolidation under Heward===

Four conductors were shortlisted to succeed Boult and were given trial concerts – Leslie Heward, Stanley Chapple, Julius Harrison and Basil Cameron – but Boult later described how &quot;Heward very easily won the palm&quot;. Heward had studied conducting under Boult at the Royal College of Music, where Hubert Parry had described him as &quot;the kind of phenomenon that appears once in a generation&quot;. He came to Birmingham from a highly successful period as music director of the South African Broadcasting Corporation and Conductor of the Cape Town Orchestra, where he had raised the standards of the orchestra&#x27;s playing to the extent that they were invited to England perform at the Empire Exhibition in 1925. Despite this, his appointment was a gamble for the CBO committee, as he was still largely unknown to English audiences.

Heward soon gained the respect of the orchestra&#x27;s players and the Birmingham audience for his formidable musicianship. His score-reading ability was exceptional and he was able to instantly diagnose problems in rehearsal – the CBO&#x27;s flautist remarked that he had &quot;never known a conductor who was so much respected by his players.&quot; He was also known for his honesty and integrity, sometimes restarting a public performance he felt to be substandard halfway through, saying &quot;I&#x27;m sorry, we can do better than that.&quot; His programming in Birmingham was bold: 28 of the 41 pieces played in his first season were Birmingham premieres, and the orchestra became particularly known for its interpretations of Dvorak, Sibelius and modern British composers. The orchestra under Heward also began to attract front-rank soloists: Arthur de Greef and Nikolai Orlov performed in 1931; Artur Schnabel played Beethoven&#x27;s Fourth Piano Concerto in 1933; Ernst Wolff, Arthur Catterall, Egon Petri, Frederic Lamond performed in 1934; Adolf Busch and Solomon in 1936; and in 1938 Béla Bartók played one of his own Piano Concertos.

Assistant conductor Joseph Lewis followed Boult to the BBC Symphony Orchestra in 1931. His eventual replacement, Harold Gray, had started his 55-year-long association with the orchestra as Boult&#x27;s secretary and musical amanuensis in 1924, and had first conducted the orchestra in 1930 in Sutton Coldfield where he was organist at parish church. Heward was reluctant to talk to audiences and didn&#x27;t enjoy performing for schoolchildren so Gray took over children&#x27;s concerts in 1931 and was appointed Deputy Conductor in 1932.

The Symphony concerts under Heward drew excellent attendances, but audiences continued to drop for concerts of popular classics as competition from radio and the cinema for leisure time activity increased. Relief from the resulting financial pressure came through a series of arrangements with the BBC. In 1930 the broadcaster agreed to reduce its Birmingham orchestra to an octet – with the redundant musicians being auditioned by the CBO – in return for the CBO performing 13 studio concerts each season: an important step towards permanent year-round contracts for the CBO&#x27;s players. In 1934 Percy Edgar and Victor Hely-Hutchinson agreed to establish the BBC Midland Orchestra playing 2–3 concerts a week, with Heward as conductor and 35 of its musicians shared with the CBO on 12-month contracts. The stability this brought meant that Heward could build on the achievements of the previous 15 years and by the late 1930s the CBO was playing to a standard comparable to the orchestras of major cities of continental Europe.

By 1939, the CBO&#x27;s finances were looking sound and its future bright. The outbreak of World War II, however, saw the BBC disband its Midland Orchestra and lay off its musicians, many of whom were also leading players with the CBO. Birmingham Town Hall was commandeered for the war effort and the CBO cancelled all of its engagements, giving Heward six months notice of termination. Although the orchestra started performing again at the Birmingham and Midland Institute in October as the &quot;City of Birmingham (Emergency) Orchestra&quot; and was able to reinstate Heward on a series of temporary contracts,it had lost many of its prewar players, and would be composed only of part-time musicians for much of the war. Compounding the difficulties was Heward&#x27;s illness. He had contracted tuberculosis during his period in South Africa and was already missing concerts with illness by 1934. Aggravated by overwork, smoking and heavy drinking, his condition deteriorated and he spent six months in a sanatorium from September 1939 to May 1940. He gave his first performance for over a year on 20 October 1940, but regularly had to cancel engagements after that, with most of the CBO&#x27;s concerts during the period being conducted by Victor Hely-Hutchinson. On Boxing Day 1942 Heward was offered the post of Conductor of the Hallé Orchestra in Manchester, tendering his resignation with effect from the end of the season, but he did not live to see out his contract, dying at his Edgbaston home in May 1943.

=== Post-war doldrums ===
By 1944, the wartime orchestra numbered only 62 musicians, all of whom were part-time and most of whom were employees of local munitions factories. Weekly concerts took place after only a single rehearsal and different players often performed from concert to concert. In an attempt to provide some stability the committee introduced permanent year-round contracts for musicians from May 1944, funded by the city council&#x27;s education committee in return for 50 days of educational work from the orchestra per year. Boyd Neel was initially favoured to replace Heward as Principal Conductor after 12 different applicants were given trial concerts over the summer of 1943, but the orchestra eventually announced the appointment on a one-year contract of George Weldon, the conductor of the City of Birmingham Choir. Weldon was flamboyant and charismatic with a love of fast cars and he cut a glamorous figure on the podium. Initial critical and public reaction was very positive and in June 1944 he was confirmed as music director. He broadened the orchestra&#x27;s reach by introducing modestly-priced summer seasons of promenade concerts from 1945, and from 1950 introduced industrial concerts aimed at the city&#x27;s manufacturing workforce, alongside annual seasons in Wolverhampton, Nottingham and Sheffield. In January 1948 the orchestra was officially renamed the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra at Weldon&#x27;s personal request.

Weldon&#x27;s success in rebuilding the orchestra after the ravages of war was limited, however: he recruited over 40 new musicians during his tenure but by 1951 had only succeeded in increasing the playing strength to 73. Year-round contracts demanded a heavy workload – during the 1945–46 season the orchestra played 260 concerts as well as undertaking educational work in the city&#x27;s schools – meaning that most concerts were rehearsed only on the day of a performance. Audiences were also unpredictable, and Weldon was criticised for programming too much lightweight repertoire. The era saw some performances of new compositions including major works composed by the orchestra&#x27;s oboist Ruth Gipps, and September 1946 brought Samuel Barber to Birmingham to conduct his own First Symphony, but Weldon repeated popular works multiple times, often twice or more within the same season. In 1946 Eric Blom criticised the orchestra for over-performance of Vaughan Williams&#x27; &quot;Fantasia on &quot;Greensleeves&quot;&quot;, with the orchestra responding by performing the work in a further concert, backwards. The music critic of the &quot;Birmingham Post&quot; was sacked in 1945 for writing that other music journalists in the city were covering up the orchestra&#x27;s low standards, but by 1948 critics were writing openly of the orchestra&#x27;s decline. An anti-Weldon lobby formed among Birmingham&#x27;s musical establishment and unsubstantiated rumours circulated that he was conducting an affair with Gipps. George Jonas, who would later head the CBSO&#x27;s council of management and started attending CBSO concerts in 1951, later recalled of the period: &quot;a pretty awful sound they made, it was a poor orchestra.&quot;

With attendance at CBSO concerts averaging only 60% of capacity, the &quot;Birmingham Post&quot; ran a series of articles in 1949 arguing for a new approach. By the next year, the orchestra had a deficit of £5,000. In 1951, the incoming executive chairman of the CBSO committee approached Rudolf Schwarz to take over as the orchestra&#x27;s new chief conductor, letting Weldon know that his contract would not be renewed. John Barbirolli was furious at Weldon&#x27;s treatment and immediately appointed him Associate Conductor of the Hallé Orchestra, but the committee considered the move a &quot;change to a conductor of a higher calibre&quot; and Weldon&#x27;s replacement was viewed by the CBSO&#x27;s players as a forward looking one. Schwarz had a well-established career as an operatic conductor in pre-war Germany, but his role as music director of the Jewish Cultural Organisation in Berlin led to him being interned by the Nazis in Belsen, from where he was rescued in 1945. He was highly respected among musicians and had rebuilt the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra after World War II. Adrian Boult wrote to him commending Birmingham as having &quot;the nicest people&quot; and assuring him he would enjoy the city, with Schwarz later concluding &quot;He was absolutely right! I found that Birmingham was &quot;alive&quot; – a city with people who work.&quot;

From the start, Schwarz&#x27;s programming was radically different to Weldon&#x27;s, reflecting a Central European repertoire alongside many unfamiliar British works. He reserved an entire day per week for rehearsals, which, despite resistance from conservative orchestral players, quickly began to bear fruit, and the orchestra began to attract front-rank soloists again. However, fewer concerts, more rehearsal time and falling attendance led to a worsening financial crisis with a deficit of £20,000 in 1952, and for a period it was suggested the CBSO should merge with the Bournemouth orchestra, performing in Birmingham during the winter and Bournemouth in the summer. When this proposal collapsed, the committee planned instead to reduce the orchestra to a six-month operation, until the incoming Labour council agreed to write off the accumulated deficit in May 1952 with an interest-free loan. At this time the CBSO was by far the smallest of Britain&#x27;s regional orchestras, but an increase in private donations allowed it to expand the playing staff in 1953, and an administrative reorganisation and further increase in support from the city council began to place it on a firmer financial footing. The orchestra made its first television appearance in 1954 and in 1955 visited the Netherlands on its first overseas tour. Most significant were the performances in 1955 and 1956 of the first of a series of new works commissioned for the orchestra by the John Feeney Charitable Trust – Arthur Bliss&#x27;s &quot;Meditations on a Theme by John Blow&quot; and Michael Tippett&#x27;s Piano Concerto – though reviews of the nationally broadcast premiere of the second still brought criticism from the &quot;Musical Times&quot; for the orchestra&#x27;s &quot;shaky playing&quot;. Schwarz himself later recalled of his period in charge of the CBSO: &quot;the orchestra did gradually improve, but some of the playing was still not ideal&quot;.

=== Panufnik and the return of Boult ===

In September 1956, Schwarz announced that he would be leaving the CBSO for the BBC Symphony Orchestra at the end of the following season. Press speculation about a successor centred on Hugo Rignold, but it was George Hurst and Andrzej Panufnik who were given trial concerts the following December, and Panufnik who was subsequently appointed after a performance described in the CBSO&#x27;s official history as &quot;sensationally successful&quot;. Panufnik was best known as a composer, but had built a career as a conductor with the Kraków Philharmonic Orchestra and Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra in his native Poland before defecting to England in 1954. His first season in Birmingham was highly adventurous, featuring the British premieres of works by Ernest Bloch, Gian Francesco Malipiero and Ferenc Farkas. Many early English works for small chamber ensembles were included alongside later classical and romantic repertoire, and some concerts would start with only 13 players on the platform.

Panufnik&#x27;s arrival in Birmingham coincided with conflict between the orchestra and management after 16 violinists were asked to re-audition for their places, and a strike was only averted by a management climb down. Although he later claimed that he &quot;found the orchestra of a high standard&quot;, Panufnik&#x27;s experience of working with some of Europe&#x27;s leading orchestras left him dissatisfied with the CBSO&#x27;s string sound. He had the support of the orchestra&#x27;s younger players, but his attempts to improve the string section brought him into conflict with the orchestra leader Norris Stanley, who had played with the orchestra since its foundation in 1920 and rejected Panufnik&#x27;s authority, resisting all attempts at change. Stanley was persuaded to resign in 1958 and was followed by many of the orchestra&#x27;s old guard, and as a result Panufnik&#x27;s second season featured less personal conflict. At the insistence of the orchestra&#x27;s management it also included four of his own compositions. In 1959, however, Panufnik decided not to renew his contract, intending to concentrate instead on composition, explaining &quot;I have learnt one thing. It is impossible to conduct a permanent orchestra and compose at the same time.&quot; He continued to have good relations with the orchestra and premiered his Piano Concerto with the CBSO in 1962.

Panufnik&#x27;s unexpectedly early departure created problems for the CBSO&#x27;s management, who had intended for him ultimately to be succeeded by Meredith Davies, who had been appointed in 1957 from over 150 applicants as the orchestra&#x27;s second Associate Conductor alongside Harold Gray. Although Davies was offered the Principal Conductor role and was considered to have the confidence of the players, he felt he was still unprepared for the position and suggested that &quot;an eminent conductor&quot; be appointed for the 1959–1960 season with the intention that Davies would take over the following year. Davies was therefore appointed as Deputy Music Director, and Adrian Boult returned for one year. Boult had given up the role of principal conductor of the London Philharmonic Orchestra two years previously and was still much in demand as a guest conductor, but agreed to return to Birmingham in a move described by Michael Kennedy as &quot;combining nostalgia and a generous rescue act&quot;. Boult&#x27;s season saw him conduct the premiere of Robert Simpson&#x27;s Violin Concerto with its dedicatee Ernest Element, and a performance of Brahm&#x27;s 4th symphony described by Robert Matthew-Walker as &quot;the greatest performance of Brahms&#x27; fourth symphony I have ever heard.&quot; John Waterhouse of the &quot;Birmingham Post&quot; wrote that under Boult the CBSO again &quot;sounded as good as any orchestra in the country&quot;.

=== Rebuilding under Rignold ===
In early 1960 the CBSO committee were still planning for Boult&#x27;s deputy Meredith Davies to succeed him as Principal Conductor, but Davies had formed an increasingly close working relationship with Benjamin Britten after taking over conducting duties at a CBSO concert of Britten&#x27;s works, and in March 1960 he left the orchestra to work with Britten&#x27;s English Opera Group. Two months later Hugo Rignold was announced as the CBSO&#x27;s new Principal Conductor. Rignold had established his reputation as one of the country&#x27;s leading conductors during six years at the Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, subsequently serving as music director of the Royal Ballet and guest conducting with major orchestras across Britain, Europe and America. He had conducted the CBSO numerous times since 1955 and was noted for his professionalism and technical expertise. He had particular strengths as an orchestra trainer and under him consistent signs of the orchestra&#x27;s potential began to emerge for the first time since the war.

Relations between the orchestra&#x27;s management and players at the time was poor. The summer of 1962 saw the musicians unanimously hand in their notice in a wage dispute, and in 1965 the orchestra suffered the only strike in its history after the demotion of Musician&#x27;s Union steward Wilfred Pook from the first to the second violins – an affair reported in the press as &quot;Pook&#x27;s pique&quot;. Rignold however was seen as bringing stability after the turbulence of the Panufnik era and Boult&#x27;s stopgap year. The last players remaining from the orchestra&#x27;s first season in 1920 had retired by 1967, and Rignold proved an astute judge of musicians, introducing many excellent young players to the orchestra and improving professionalism and discipline. He demanded high standards and audiences experienced noticeable improvements. By 1963 the orchestra was seeing much improved reviews in the London press. The growing prestige of the CBSO made it easier to attract international artists: soloists at CBSO concerts included Wilhelm Kempff, Clifford Curzon, Ida Haendel, Paul Tortelier, Isaac Stern and Mstislav Rostropovich; and notable guest conductors included Antal Doráti, Jascha Horenstein, Rudolf Kempe, Ferdinand Leitner and Nadia Boulanger, who conducted a programme of works by her sister Lili Boulanger.

Rignold updated the orchestra&#x27;s repertoire, conducting 31 premieres during his tenure. The era saw Birmingham&#x27;s first complete performances of works including Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Images&quot;, Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Daphnis et Chloé&quot;, Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;Verklärte Nacht&quot; and Walton&#x27;s Violin Concerto, and a series themed around &quot;Masterpieces of the Twentieth Century&quot; was held in 1966 and 1967. Like Leslie Heward and Rudolf Schwarz before him, Rignold was particularly committed to the music of Sibelius, giving a complete cycle of his symphonies in 1966. The most significant premiere of the period, indeed of the CBSO&#x27;s entire history, saw the orchestra play the first performance of Benjamin Britten&#x27;s &quot;War Requiem&quot; at the dedication of Coventry Cathedral in 1962, accompanied by Peter Pears, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, Heather Harper and the Melos Ensemble, conducted by Meredith Davies and the composer himself. This event saw the orchestra attracting international attention for the first time since the first Boult era. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; described the work as &quot;a masterpiece of the first order&quot;, Fischer-Dieskau wept during rehearsals and at the end of the performance Harper noticed that &quot;all around her people were in tears&quot;.

The Rignold era also saw modernisation of the CBSO&#x27;s operations. The orchestra undertook two major European tours in 1963 and 1968, and in 1966 made its first commercial recordings since 1948, producing its first long-playing record. 1963 saw the orchestra solvent and free of debt for the first time in over a decade, leading to an increase in permanent strength to 88. The workload of the orchestra remained extremely high though: throughout the 1960s it gave annual concert series in Coventry, Nottingham, Cheltenham, Dudley, Kidderminster and London as well as regular performances in Leeds and Bristol. It performed two seasons every year supporting Welsh National Opera, which had no orchestra of its own, it accompanied choral societies through the Midlands, and continued to provide 50 days of education work each year in Birmingham schools. Despite playing more concerts than the Liverpool, Hallé or Bournemouth orchestras it received a smaller grant from the Arts Council, until increases in 1966 finally brought the it into line.

=== Frémaux and &quot;the best French orchestra in the World&quot;===

Despite the progress under Hugo Rignold, by the late 1960s the CBSO committee were beginning to look for a new conductor who could take the orchestra further, and in 1967 Rignold resigned after being offered a one-year contract extension instead of having his existing three-year deal renewed. This left the orchestra without a principal conductor for the 1968–1969 season, but also left it free to give trials to potential replacements. Norman Del Mar and Walter Susskind both gave successful concerts, but the strong favourite throughout the process was the conductor of the first concert, the Frenchman Louis Frémaux, whose appointment was announced from autumn 1969. Frémaux had made his reputation with the Monte Carlo Orchestra, particularly for his recordings of French music, releasing over 30 recordings and winning 8 Grand Prix du Disque. For the first three years of his appointment in Birmingham he combined his role with continuing as the founding conductor of the Orchestre Philharmonique Rhône-Alpes in Lyon, but in 1972 he resigned from Lyon to concentrate on his Birmingham activities, performing 70 concerts a season with the CBSO even though only contracted to provide 30.

Frémaux oversaw a vast improvement in the CBSO&#x27;s orchestral standards, drawing from the orchestra a previously unheard-of precision and verve. Regular sectional rehearsals were brought in from 1970 and Frémaux brought a new emphasis on the recruitment of young principals, setting up a complex system of auditions and trial periods and attending over 900 auditions himself. His opening concert drew &quot;ecstatic&quot; reviews from London critics, and by 1970 &quot;The Guardian&quot; could write that &quot;there is no better British orchestra outside London&quot;. By 1972 the same newspaper was going further, writing that &quot;under Fremaux they combine a purity of intonation which metropolitan orchestras might envy, with a fluid and spontaneous style of phrasing&quot;. The commercial success of Frémaux&#x27;s CBSO recordings for EMI firmly established its reputation for French music, with recordings of Saint-Saëns&#x27; &quot;Organ Symphony&quot; and Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;Grande Messe des morts&quot; being particularly successful. Frémaux&#x27;s CBSO also had a high reputation in romantic repertoire by Dvořák, Schumann and Tchaikovsky as well as twentieth century work such as Shostakovich, Walton and Britten. The distinctive sound that characterised the orchestra under Frémaux was considered less well-suited to classic Viennese repertoire such as Beethoven and Brahms.

The popularity of Frémaux&#x27;s concerts saw attendances at Birmingham Town Hall increase from an average of 67% in 1968–69 to 88% in 1970–71, with 45% of the audience aged under 25. In response, plans were drawn up by the architect John Madin in 1970 for a new concert hall to be built on the site of Bingley Hall just off Broad Street, and when this scheme was halted by a financial crisis at the city council it was replaced by a proposal from local television station ATV for a multi-purpose exhibition and concert hall as part of its new studio centre. This was turned down by the city council for being impractical, and instead in 1972 the Town Hall was extensively refurbished with double glazing and more room on the platform, but little improvement in acoustics – the orchestra&#x27;s manager Arthur Baker commented that &quot;we still have the same woolly sound&quot;. More positive developments included the orchestra&#x27;s first commercial sponsorship and the foundation in 1973 of the CBSO Chorus, established under Gordon Clinton to give the orchestra complete artistic control over its choral backing for its burgeoning recording activities.

For all its triumphs, Frémaux&#x27;s tenure in Birmingham was to end in chaos and acrimony. In 1969 Birmingham City Council had cancelled the CBSO&#x27;s regular programme of visits to local schools for budgetary reasons. In their place, manager Arthur Baker developed a partnership with promoter Victor Hochhauser for the orchestra to perform lucrative series of mass-market concerts at the Royal Albert Hall in London, but constant travelling away from Birmingham and repetitive popular repertoire began to have a negative effect on player morale. The CBSO in the 1960s and 1970s had a particular reputation for political activism and Frémaux became increasingly uneasy with the amount of internal unrest. Matters were made worse when Frémaux appointed Baker as his personal agent alongside his role as orchestral manager: the players began to feel that Baker was prioritising Frémaux&#x27;s interests over the orchestra&#x27;s artistic development and started compiling a dossier of supporting evidence. A humiliating climbdown in a dispute with the players over the seating of a freelance viola player in February 1978 led Frémaux to decide that he would not renew his contract, later complaining that &quot;The union wanted to manage the orchestra. Some of them wanted a revolution.&quot; The next month, however, a vote of no confidence from the players in Baker led to his resignation, with Frémaux himself also resigning out of personal loyalty. The players stressed that Frémaux retained their support, but he never conducted the orchestra again

Although the loss of the orchestra&#x27;s Manager and music director in a single week was a crisis in the short term, it resulted in a series of longer term changes that would have more positive effects. The Swiss avant-garde composer and conductor Erich Schmid was found at short notice to take over Fremaux&#x27;s immediate conducting commitments, including a Beethoven festival due to take place less than two months later. The resulting artistic triumph saw him appointed as the orchestra&#x27;s first Principal Guest Conductor in September 1979. The structure of the orchestra&#x27;s management committees was reformed, with two elected players&#x27; representatives on the main decision-making body to improve communications between musicians and management. Baker&#x27;s role as General Manager was taken by Ed Smith, who came from the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, where he had worked closely for many years with the conductor of the youth orchestra, Simon Rattle. Rattle had performed four well-received concerts with the CBSO over the previous year and had made no secret of his interest in the Birmingham position. Smith later commented that &quot;Simon was still an unknown quantity to most people, but not, of course, to me. I pushed very hard to have him appointed&quot;. For the first time, the appointment of a Principal Conductor required a poll of the musicians as well as the agreement of the committee of management. On 2 July 1979, Rattle was announced as the orchestra&#x27;s &quot;Principal Conductor and Artistic Advisor&quot;. The &quot;Birmingham Post&quot; wrote of Frémaux that &quot;whatever the circumstances of his going, he was the man who raised the CBSO to the highest point of prestige in its history to date&quot;, while Rattle stated that he had inherited &quot;possibly the best French orchestra in the world.&quot;

===Rattle and after===

The CBSO began to gain greater international renown after Simon Rattle became chief conductor in 1980. Under him, the orchestra increased its recording profile and became one of the leading ensembles in Europe, and gained a name for its interpretations of late romantic and 20th century works, especially those of Sibelius and Gustav Mahler. During this period, the orchestra moved from Birmingham Town Hall to a new home venue, Symphony Hall, inside Birmingham&#x27;s International Convention Centre. The nearby CBSO Centre, a converted factory, houses management offices, rehearsal facilities, and is a concert venue in its own right, for more intimate performances. The CBSO Youth Orchestra has been affiliated with the CBSO since 2004.

Rattle was named music director of the CBSO in 1990. That same year, the post of Radcliffe Composer in Association was created, with Mark-Anthony Turnage filling the role. In 1995, Judith Weir became Fairbairn Composer in Association, followed in 2001 by Julian Anderson.

Following Rattle&#x27;s departure, Sakari Oramo became chief conductor in 1998, and music director in 1999. His CBSO work included the Floof! festival of contemporary music. He also championed the music of John Foulds in concerts and recordings. In 2001, the players rejected a contract that would have stopped extra payments for broadcasts and recordings, in the context of financial crisis at the CBSO. In addition, other controversy arose from the CBSO&#x27;s demands from the Arts Council for a greater share of the council&#x27;s stabilisation fund, because of its reputation compared to other British orchestras. In 2008, Oramo stood down as music director and took the title of principal guest conductor for the 2008–2009 season.

In October 2007, the CBSO named Andris Nelsons as its next music director, effective with the 2008–2009 season. Nelsons&#x27; initial contract was for 3 years. The appointment was unusual in that Nelsons had not conducted the CBSO publicly prior to his appointment, but only in a private concert and in a recording session. In July 2009, the orchestra extended Nelsons&#x27; contract for another 3 years, through the 2013–2014 season. In August 2012, the CBSO announced the further extension of Nelsons&#x27; contract formally through the 2014–2015 season, and then for subsequent seasons on the basis of an annual rolling renewal. In October 2013, the CBSO announced the conclusion of Nelsons&#x27; tenure as music director after the conclusion of the 2014–2015 season.
In July 2015, Mirga Gražinytė-Tyla first guest-conducted the CBSO. In February 2016, the CBSO named her as its next music director, effective September 2016, with an initial contract of 3 years. She was the first female conductor to be named music director of the CBSO and conducted her first concert as CBSO music director on 26 August 2016. She concluded her CBSO tenure at the close of the 2021–2022 season, and took the title of principal guest conductor for the 2022–2023 season.

Kazuki Yamada first guest-conducted the CBSO in 2012. In May 2018, the CBSO announced the appointment of Yamada as its next principal guest conductor, effective with the 2018–2019 season. In January 2021, the CBSO announced the extension of Yamada&#x27;s contract as principal guest conductor with CBSO until 2023. In September 2021, the CBSO announced the appointment of Yamada as its next chief conductor and artistic advisor, effective 1 April 2023, with an initial contract of 4.5 years. In May 2024, the CBSO elevated Yamada&#x27;s title to music director. In January 2025, the CBSO announced an extension of Yamada&#x27;s contract as its music director through the 2028–2029 season.

The CBSO&#x27;s current Associate Conductor is Michael Seal. In February 2022, the CBSO announced the appointment of a cohort of six new Assistant Conductors – Bertie Baigent, Olivia Clarke, Otis Enokido-Lineham, Jack Lovell-Huckle, Charlotte Politi and Konstantinos Terzakis. The CBSO&#x27;s current chief executive is Emma Stenning, as of April 2023, in succession to Stephen Maddock.

The CBSO has recorded extensively for labels such as EMI Classics, Warner Classics, and Orfeo. The orchestra has also released recordings under its own self-produced label.

<doc id="148257" wikidata="Q785345" url="?curid=148257" title="Project Xanadu">
<text>Project Xanadu ( ) was the first hypertext project, founded in 1960 by Ted Nelson. Administrators of Project Xanadu have declared it superior to the World Wide Web, with the mission statement: &quot;Today&#x27;s popular software simulates paper. The World Wide Web (another imitation of paper) trivialises our original hypertext model with one-way ever-breaking links and no management of version or contents.&quot;

&quot;Wired&quot; magazine published an article entitled &quot;The Curse of Xanadu&quot;, calling Project Xanadu &quot;the longest-running vaporware story in the history of the computer industry&quot;. The first attempt at implementation began in 1960, but it was not until 1998 that an incomplete implementation was released. A version described as &quot;a working deliverable&quot;, OpenXanadu, was made available in 2014.

== History ==
Nelson&#x27;s vision was for a &quot;digital repository scheme for world-wide electronic publishing&quot;. Nelson states that the idea began in 1960, when he was a student at Harvard University. He proposed a machine-language program which would store and display documents, together with the ability to perform edits. This was different from a word processor (which had not been invented yet) in that the functionality would have included visual comparisons of different versions of the document, a concept Nelson would later call &quot;intercomparison&quot;.

On top of this basic idea, Nelson wanted to facilitate nonsequential writing, in which the reader could choose their own path through an electronic document. He built upon this idea in a paper to the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) in 1965, calling the new idea &quot;zippered lists&quot;. These zippered lists would allow compound documents to be formed from pieces of other documents, a concept named transclusion. In 1967, while working for Harcourt, Brace, he named his project Xanadu, in honour of the poem &quot;Kubla Khan&quot; by Samuel Taylor Coleridge.

Nelson&#x27;s talk at the ACM predicted many of the features of today&#x27;s hypertext systems, but at the time, his ideas had little impact. Though researchers were intrigued by his ideas, Nelson lacked the technical knowledge to demonstrate that the ideas could be implemented.

=== 1970s ===
Ted Nelson published his ideas in his 1974 book &quot;Computer Lib/Dream Machines&quot; and the 1981 &quot;Literary Machines&quot;.

&quot;Computer Lib/Dream Machines&quot; is written in a non-sequential fashion: it is a compilation of Nelson&#x27;s thoughts about computing, among other topics, in no particular order. It contains two books, printed back to back, to be flipped between. &quot;Computer Lib&quot; contains Nelson&#x27;s thoughts on topics which angered him, while &quot;Dream Machines&quot; discusses his hopes for the potential of computers to assist the arts.

In 1972, Cal Daniels completed the first demonstration version of the Xanadu software on a computer Nelson had rented for the purpose, though Nelson soon ran out of money. In 1974, with the advent of computer networking, Nelson refined his thoughts about Xanadu into a centralised source of information, calling it a &quot;docuverse&quot;.

In the summer of 1979, Nelson led the latest group of his followers, Roger Gregory, Mark S. Miller and Stuart Greene, to Swarthmore, Pennsylvania. In a house rented by Greene, they hashed out their ideas for Xanadu; but at the end of the summer the group went their separate ways. Miller and Gregory created an addressing system based on transfinite numbers which they called tumblers, which allowed any part of a file to be referenced.

=== 1980s ===
The group continued their work, almost to the point of bankruptcy. In 1983, however, Nelson met John Walker, founder of Autodesk, at The Hackers Conference, a conference originally for the people mentioned in Steven Levy&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, and the group started working on Xanadu with Autodesk&#x27;s financial backing.

According to economist Robin Hanson, in 1990 the first known corporate prediction market was used at Xanadu. Employees and consultants used it for example to bet on the cold fusion controversy at the time.

While at Autodesk, the group, led by Gregory, completed a version of the software, written in the C programming language, though the software did not work the way they wanted. However, this version of Xanadu was successfully demonstrated at The Hackers Conference and generated considerable interest. Then a newer group of programmers, hired from Xerox PARC, used the problems with this software as justification to rewrite the software in Smalltalk. This effectively split the group into two factions, and the decision to rewrite put a deadline imposed by Autodesk out of the team&#x27;s reach. In August 1992, Autodesk divested the Xanadu group, which became the Xanadu Operating Company, which struggled due to internal conflicts and lack of investment.

Charles S. Smith, the founder of a company called Memex (named after a hypertext system proposed by Vannevar Bush), hired many of the Xanadu programmers (including lead architects Mark S. Miller, Dean Tribble and Ravi Pandya) and licensed the Xanadu technology, though Memex soon faced financial difficulties, and the then-unpaid programmers left, taking the computers with them (the programmers were eventually paid). At around this time, Tim Berners-Lee was developing the World Wide Web. When the Web began to see large growth that Xanadu did not, Nelson&#x27;s team grew defensive in the supposed rivalry that was emerging, but that they were losing. The 1995 &quot;Wired&quot; Magazine article &quot;The Curse of Xanadu&quot;, provoked a harsh rebuttal from Nelson, but contention largely faded as the Web dominated Xanadu.

=== 1990s ===
In 1998, Nelson released the source code to Xanadu as Project Udanax, in the hope that the techniques and algorithms used could help to overturn some software patents.

=== 2000s ===
In 2007, Project Xanadu released XanaduSpace 1.0.

=== 2010s ===
A version described as &quot;a working deliverable&quot;, OpenXanadu, was made available on the World Wide Web in 2014. It is called open because &quot;you can see all the parts&quot;, but the site stated that it was &quot;not yet open source&quot;. On the site, the creators claim that Tim Berners-Lee stole their idea, and that the World Wide Web is a &quot;bizarre structure created by arbitrary initiatives of varied people and it has a terrible programming language&quot; and that Web security is a &quot;complex maze&quot;. They go on to say that Hypertext is designed to be paper, and that the World Wide Web allows nothing more than dead links to other dead pages.

In 2016, Ted Nelson was interviewed by Werner Herzog in his documentary, &quot;Lo and Behold, Reveries of the Connected World&quot;. &quot;By some, he was labeled insane for clinging on; to us, you appear to be the only one who is clinically sane&quot;, Herzog said. Nelson was delighted by the praise. &quot;No one has ever said that before!&quot; said Nelson. &quot;Usually I hear the opposite.&quot;

==Tumbler==

In the design of the Xanadu computer system, a tumbler is an address of any range of content or link or a set of ranges or links. According to Gary Wolf in &quot;Wired&quot;, the idea of tumblers was that &quot;the address would not only point the reader to the correct machine, it would also indicate the author of the document, the version of the document, the correct span of bytes, and the links associated with these bytes.&quot; Tumblers were created by Roger Gregory and Mark Miller.

The idea behind tumblers comes from transfinite numbers.
