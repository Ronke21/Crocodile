<text>Benjamin Henry Boneval Latrobe (May 1, 1764 – September 3, 1820) was a British-American neoclassical architect who immigrated to the United States. He was one of the first formally trained, professional architects in the new United States, drawing on influences from his travels in Italy, as well as British and French Neoclassical architects such as Claude Nicolas Ledoux. In his thirties, he immigrated to the new United States and designed the United States Capitol, on &quot;Capitol Hill&quot; in Washington, D.C., as well as the Old Baltimore Cathedral or The Baltimore Basilica, (later renamed the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary). It is the first Cathedral constructed in the United States for any Christian denomination. Latrobe also designed the largest structure in America at the time, the &quot;Merchants&#x27; Exchange&quot; in Baltimore. With extensive balconied atriums through the wings and a large central rotunda under a low dome which dominated the city, it was completed in 1820 after five years of work and endured into the early twentieth century.

Latrobe immigrated to America from England in 1796, initially settling in Virginia where he worked on the Virginia State Penitentiary in Richmond. Latrobe then moved to Philadelphia where he established his practice. In 1803, he was hired as Surveyor of the Public Buildings of the United States, and spent much of the next fourteen years working on projects in the new national capital of Washington, D.C., (in the newly-laid out Federal capital of the District of Columbia) where he served as the second Architect of the Capitol. He also was responsible for the design of the White House porticos. Latrobe spent the later years of his life in New Orleans, Louisiana working on a waterworks project, and died there in 1820 from yellow fever.

Latrobe has been called the &quot;father of American architecture&quot;. He was the uncle of Charles La Trobe, who was the first Lieutenant-Governor of Victoria in Australia.

==Biography==

Latrobe was born on May 1, 1764, at the Fulneck Moravian Settlement, near Pudsey in the city of Leeds, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, England. His parents were the Reverend Benjamin Latrobe, a leader of the Moravian Church who was of Huguenot (French Protestant) ancestry, and Anna Margaretta Antes whose father was German and whose maternal line was Dutch. Antes was born in the American colony of Pennsylvania, but was sent to England by her father, a wealthy landowner, to attend a Moravian school at Fulneck.

Latrobe&#x27;s father, who was responsible for all Moravian schools and establishments in Britain, had an extensive circle of friends in the higher ranks of society. He stressed the importance of education, scholarship, and the value of social exchange; while Latrobe&#x27;s mother instilled in her son a curiosity and interest in America. From a young age, Benjamin Henry Latrobe enjoyed drawing landscapes and buildings. He was a brother of Moravian leader and musical composer Christian Ignatius Latrobe.

In 1776, at the age of 12, Latrobe was sent away to the Moravian School at Niesky in Silesia near the border of Saxony and Poland. At age eighteen, he spent several months traveling around Germany, and then joined the Royal Prussian Army, becoming close friends with a distinguished officer in the United States Army. Latrobe also may have served briefly in the Austrian Imperial Army, and suffered some injuries or illness. After recovering, he embarked on a continental &quot;Grand Tour&quot;, visiting eastern Saxony, Paris, Italy, and other places. Through his education and travels, Latrobe mastered German, French, ancient and modern Greek, and Latin. He had advanced ability in Italian and Spanish and some knowledge of Hebrew. Latrobe was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1815.

His son, Benjamin Henry Latrobe, II, (sometimes referred to as &quot;Junior&quot;), also worked as a civil engineer. In 1827, he joined the newly organized Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and designed the longest, most challenging bridge on its initial route: the curving Thomas Viaduct, (the third of four multi-arched &quot;viaducts&quot;).

Another son, John Hazlehurst Boneval Latrobe (1803–1891), was a noted civic leader, lawyer, author, historian, artist, inventor, sometime architect, intellectual, and social activist in Maryland While Park Commissioner for the City of Baltimore he co-founded the Baltimore Zoo. Among his inventions and patents, he invented the Latrobe Stove, also known as the &quot;Baltimore Heater&quot;, a cast iron coal fired parlor heater.

A grandson, Charles Hazlehurst Latrobe (1834–1902), Benjamin Henry Latrobe II&#x27;s son, continued the tradition of architect and engineer building bridges for the city of Baltimore and for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. Charles Hazlehurst fought on the side of the confederacy during the Civil War.

Another grandson, Ferdinand Claiborne Latrobe, was a seven-term mayor of Baltimore.

Latrobe Park in south Baltimore is named for the family, as is Latrobe Park, New Orleans, in the French Quarter.

==Travels==

===England===
Latrobe returned to England in 1784, and was apprenticed to John Smeaton, an engineer known for designing Eddystone Lighthouse. Then in 1787 or 1788, he worked in the office of neoclassical architect Samuel Pepys Cockerell for a brief time. In 1790, Latrobe was appointed Surveyor of the Public Offices in London, and established his own private practice in 1791. Latrobe was commissioned in 1792 to design Hammerwood Lodge, near East Grinstead in Sussex, his first independent work, and he designed nearby Ashdown House in 1793. Latrobe was involved in construction of the Basingstoke Canal in Surrey, together with engineers John Smeaton and William Jessop. In spring 1793, Latrobe was hired to plan improvements to the River Blackwater from Maldon to Beeleigh, so that the port of Maldon could compete with the Chelmer and Blackwater Navigation, which bypassed the town. The project lasted until early 1795, when Parliament denied approval of his plan. Latrobe had problems getting payment for his work on the project, and faced bankruptcy.

In February 1790, Latrobe married Lydia Sellon, and they lived a busy social life in London. The couple had a daughter (Lydia Sellon Latrobe) and a son (Henry Sellon Boneval Latrobe), before she died giving birth during November 1793. Lydia had inherited her father&#x27;s wealth, which in turn was to be left to the children through a trust with the children&#x27;s uncles, but never ended up going to the children. In 1795, Latrobe suffered a breakdown and decided to immigrate to America, departing on November 25 aboard the &quot;Eliza&quot;.

In America, Latrobe was known for his series of topological and landscape watercolors; the series started with a view of the White Cliffs of the south coast of England viewed from the &quot;Eliza&quot;. The series was preceded by a watercolor of East Grinstead, dated September 8, 1795.

===Virginia===

Latrobe arrived in Norfolk, Virginia, in mid-March 1796 after a harrowing four-month journey aboard the ship, which was plagued with food shortages under near-starvation conditions. Latrobe initially spent time in Norfolk, where he designed the &quot;William Pennock House,&quot; then set out for Richmond in April 1796. Soon after arriving in Virginia, Latrobe became friends with Bushrod Washington, nephew of President George Washington, along with Edmund Randolph and other notable figures. Through Bushrod Washington, Latrobe was able to pay a visit to Mount Vernon to meet with the president in the summer of 1796.

Latrobe&#x27;s first major project in the United States was the State Penitentiary in Richmond, commissioned in 1797. The penitentiary included many innovative ideas in penal reform, then being espoused by Thomas Jefferson and various other figures, including cells arranged in a semicircle, that allowed for easy surveillance, as well as improved living conditions for sanitation and ventilation. He also pioneered the use of solitary confinement in the Richmond penitentiary. While in Virginia, Latrobe worked on the Green Spring mansion near Williamsburg, which had been built by Governor Sir William Berkeley in the seventeenth century but fell into disrepair after the American Revolutionary War. Latrobe created designs for Fort Nelson in Virginia in 1798. He also made drawings for a number of houses that were not built, including the &quot;Mill Hill&quot; plantation house near Richmond.

After spending a year in Virginia, the novelty of being in a new place wore off, and Latrobe was lonely and restless in Virginia. Giambattista Scandella, a friend, suggested Philadelphia as an ideal location for him. In April 1798, Latrobe visited Philadelphia for the first time, meeting with Bank of Pennsylvania president Samuel J. Fox, and presented to him a design for a new bank building. At the time, the political climate in Philadelphia was quite different than Virginia, with a strong division between the Federalists and Jefferson&#x27;s Democratic-Republicans, along with anti-French sentiment, thus the city was not entirely welcoming for Latrobe. On his way to Philadelphia, Latrobe passed through the national capital city of Washington, D.C., then under construction (congress and the president would not arrive until the year 1800), where he met with the first architect of the capitol, William Thornton, and viewed the United States Capitol for the first time. He stopped by Washington again on his way back to Richmond. Latrobe remained in Richmond, Virginia, until November 1798, when his design was selected for the Bank of Pennsylvania. He moved to Philadelphia, so that he could supervise the construction, although he continued to do occasional projects for clients in Virginia.

===Philadelphia===

By the time he arrived in Philadelphia, Latrobe&#x27;s two friends, Scandella and Volney, had left due to concerns regarding the Alien and Sedition Acts, but Latrobe made friends with some of their acquaintances at the American Philosophical Society. Latrobe submitted several papers to the society, on his geology and natural history observations, and became a member of the society in 1799. With his charming personality, Latrobe quickly made other friends among the influential financial and business families in Philadelphia, and became close friends with Nicholas Roosevelt, a talented steam-engine builder who would help Latrobe in his waterworks projects.

Latrobe&#x27;s first major project in Philadelphia was to design the Bank of Pennsylvania, which was the first example of Greek Revival architecture in the United States. It was demolished in 1870. This commission is what convinced him to set up his practice in Philadelphia, where he developed his reputation.

Latrobe also was hired to design the Center Square Water Works in Philadelphia. The Pump House, located on the common at Broad and Market Streets (now the site of Philadelphia City Hall), was designed by Latrobe in a Greek Revival style. It drew water from the Schuylkill River, a mile away, and contained two steam engines that pumped it into wooden tanks in its tower. Gravity then fed the water by wooden mains into houses and businesses. Following his work on the Philadelphia water works project, Latrobe worked as an engineer of the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal.

In addition to Greek Revival designs, Latrobe also used Gothic Revival designs in many of his works, including the 1799 design of Sedgeley, a country mansion in Philadelphia. The Gothic Revival style was used in Latrobe&#x27;s design of the Philadelphia Bank building as well, which was built in 1807 and demolished in 1836. As a young architect, Robert Mills worked as an assistant with Latrobe from 1803 until 1808 when he set up his own practice.

While in Philadelphia, Latrobe married Mary Elizabeth Hazlehurst (1771–1841), in 1800. The couple had several children together.

===Washington, D.C.===
In the United States, Latrobe quickly achieved eminence as the first professional architect working in the country. Latrobe was a friend of Thomas Jefferson, influencing Jefferson&#x27;s design for the University of Virginia. Latrobe also knew James Monroe, as well as New Orleans architect and pirate, Barthelemy Lafon, was Aaron Burr&#x27;s preferred architect, and he trained architect William Strickland.

In 1803, Jefferson hired Latrobe as Surveyor of the Public Buildings of the United States, and to work as superintendent of construction of the United States Capitol. As construction of the capitol was already underway, Latrobe was tasked to work with William Thornton&#x27;s plans, which Latrobe criticized. In an 1803 letter to Vice President Aaron Burr, he characterized the plans and work done as &quot;faulty construction&quot;. Nonetheless, President Thomas Jefferson insisted that Latrobe follow Thornton&#x27;s design for the capitol.

Although Latrobe&#x27;s major work was overseeing construction of the United States Capitol, he also was responsible for numerous other projects in Washington. In 1804, became chief engineer in the United States Navy. As chief surveyor, Latrobe was responsible for the Washington Canal. Latrobe faced bureaucratic hurdles in moving forward with the canal, with the directors of the company rejecting his request for stone locks. Instead, the canal was built with wooden locks, which were subsequently destroyed in a heavy storm in 1811. Latrobe also designed the main gate of the Washington Navy Yard. Latrobe worked on other transportation projects in Washington, D.C., including the Washington and Alexandria Turnpike, which connected Washington with Alexandria, as well as a road connecting with Frederick, Maryland, and a third road, the Columbia Turnpike going through Bladensburg to Baltimore. Latrobe also provided consulting on the construction of the Washington Bridge across the Potomac River in a way that would not impede navigation and commerce to Georgetown.

Benjamin Latrobe was responsible for several other projects located around Lafayette Square, including St. John&#x27;s Episcopal Church, Decatur House, and the White House porticos. Private homes designed by Latrobe include commissions by John P. Van Ness and Peter Casanove.

In June 1812, construction of the Capitol came to a halt with the outbreak of the War of 1812 and the failure of the First Bank of the United States. During the war, Latrobe relocated to Pittsburgh, and returned to Washington in 1815, as Architect of the Capitol, charged with responsibility of rebuilding the capitol after it was destroyed in the war. Latrobe was given more freedom in rebuilding the capitol, to apply his own design elements for the interior. Through much of Latrobe&#x27;s time in Washington, he remained involved with his private practice to some extent and with other projects in Philadelphia and elsewhere. His clerk of works, John Lenthal, often urged Latrobe to spend more time in Washington.

By 1817, Latrobe had provided President James Monroe with complete drawings for the entire building. He resigned as Architect of the Capitol on November 20, 1817, and without this major commission, Latrobe faced difficulties and was forced into bankruptcy. Latrobe left Washington, for Baltimore in January 1818.

Latrobe left Washington with pessimism, with the city&#x27;s design contradicting many of his ideals. Latrobe disliked the Baroque-style plan for the city, and other aspects of L&#x27;Enfant&#x27;s plan, and resented having to conform to Thornton&#x27;s plans for the Capitol Building. One of the greatest problems with the overall city plan, in the view of Latrobe, was its vast interior distances, and Latrobe considered the Washington Canal as a key factor that, if successful, could help alleviate this issue. Latrobe also had concerns about the city&#x27;s economic potential, and argued for constructing a road connecting Washington with Frederick to the northwest to enhance economic commerce through Washington.


===New Orleans===
Latrobe saw great potential for growth in New Orleans, situated at the mouth of the Mississippi River, with the advent of the steamboat and great interest in steamboat technology. Latrobe&#x27;s first project in New Orleans was the first New Orleans United States Customs building, constructed in 1807.

In 1810, Latrobe sent his son, Henry Sellon &quot;Boneval&quot; Latrobe, to the city to present a plan for a waterworks system to the New Orleans city council. Latrobe&#x27;s plan for the waterworks system was based on that of Philadelphia, which he earlier designed. The system in Philadelphia was created as a response to yellow fever epidemics affecting the city. Latrobe&#x27;s system used steam pumps to move water from the Schuylkill River to a reservoir, located upstream; so that gravity could be used to transmit the water from there to residents in the city. The New Orleans waterworks project also was designed to desalinate water, using steam-powered pumps. While in New Orleans, Latrobe&#x27;s son participated in the Battle of New Orleans against British forces in 1815, and took on other projects including building a lighthouse, a new Charity Hospital, and the French Opera House.

New Orleans agreed to commission the waterworks project in 1811, although Latrobe was not ready to take on the project immediately and faced financial problems in securing enough investors for the project. His work on the United States Capitol was completed shortly before the War of 1812 started, ending his source of steady income. During the war Latrobe unsuccessfully tried several wartime schemes to make money, including some steamboat projects. In 1814, Latrobe partnered with Robert Fulton in a steamship venture based at Pittsburgh. While in Pittsburgh, Latrobe designed and built a theater for the Circus of Pepin and Breschard. After the U. S. Capitol and White House were burned by the British Army, Latrobe remained in Washington to help with rebuilding, and Latrobe&#x27;s son took on much of the work for the New Orleans waterworks project.

Latrobe faced further delays trying to get an engine built for the waterworks, which he finally accomplished in 1819. The process of designing and constructing the waterworks system in New Orleans spanned eleven years. In addition to this project, Latrobe designed the central tower of the St. Louis Cathedral, which was his last architectural project.

Latrobe died September 3, 1820, from yellow fever, while working in Louisiana. He was buried in the Protestant section of the Saint Louis Cemetery in New Orleans, where his eldest son, architect Henry Sellon Boneval Latrobe (1792–1817), had been buried three years earlier, having also succumbed to yellow fever.

===Influences===

While studying in Germany, Latrobe was mentored by Baron Karl von Schachmann, a classical scholar interested in art and collecting. Around 1783, Latrobe made the decision to become an architect, a decision influenced by the baron. While Latrobe was in Germany, a new architectural movement, led by Carl Gotthard Langhans and others, was emerging with return to more Classical or Vitruvian designs.

In 1784, Latrobe set off on a Grand Tour around Europe, visiting Paris where the Panthéon, a church dedicated to St. Genevieve, was nearing completion. The Panthéon in Paris, designed by Jacques Germain Soufflot and Jean-Baptiste Rondelet, represented an early example of Neoclassicism. At that time, Claude Nicolas Ledoux was designing numerous houses in France, in Neoclassical style. Latrobe also visited Rome, where he was impressed by the Roman Pantheon and other ancient structures with Greek influence. Influential architects in Britain, at the time when Latrobe returned in 1784, adhered to a number of different styles. Sir William Chambers was at the forefront, designing in Palladianism style, while Chambers&#x27; rival, Robert Adam&#x27;s designs had Roman influence, in a style known as Adam style. Latrobe was not interested in either the Palladian nor Adam style, but Neoclassicalism also was being introduced to Great Britain at the time by George Dance the Younger. Other British architects, including John Soane and Henry Holland, also designed in the Neoclassical style while Latrobe was in London.

During his European tour, Latrobe gathered ideas on how American cities should be designed. He suggested city blocks be laid out as thin rectangles, with the long side of the blocks oriented east–west so that as many houses as possible could face south. For a city to succeed, he thought it needed to be established only in places with good prospects for commerce and industrial growth, and with a good water supply.

Public health was another key consideration of Latrobe, who believed that the eastern shores of rivers were unhealthy, due to prevailing direction of the wind, and recommended cities be built on the western shores of rivers.

===Greek Revival in America===
Latrobe brought from England influences of British Neoclassicism, and was able to combine it with styles introduced by Thomas Jefferson, to devise an American Greek Revival style. John Summerson described the Bank of Pennsylvania, as an example of how Latrobe &quot;married English Neo-Classicism to Jeffersonian Neo-Classicism [and] ... from that moment, the classical revival in America took on a national form&quot;. The American form of Greek Revival architecture that Latrobe developed became associated with political ideals of democracy—a meaning that was less apparent in Britain. The direct link between the Greek Revival architecture and American democracy has been disputed by recent scholars such as W. Barksdale Maynard, who sees the Greek Revival as an international phenomenon.

==Selected works==
===Houses===
When Latrobe began private practice in England, his first projects were alterations to existing houses, designing Hammerwood Park, and designing Ashdown House, East Sussex. Alterations completed early in his career may have included Tanton Hall, Sheffield Park, Frimley, and Teston Hall, although these homes have since been altered and it is difficult now to isolate Latrobe&#x27;s work in the current designs. His designs were simpler than was typical at the time, and had influences of Robert Adam. Features in his designs often included as part of the front porticos, Greek ionic columns, as used in Ashdown House, or doric columns, seen in Hammerwood Park.

The book, &quot;The Domestic Architecture of Benjamin Henry Latrobe&quot;, lists buildings he designed in England, including Grade II* listed Alderbury House (late 1800s) in Wiltshire. This structure had previously been misattributed to James Wyatt. It has been described as &quot;one of Wiltshire&#x27;s most elegant Georgian country houses&quot;.

Latrobe continued to design houses after he immigrated to the United States, mostly using Greek Revival designs. Four houses still stand that Latrobe designed: the Decatur House in Washington, D.C.; Adena in Chillicothe, Ohio; the Pope Villa in Lexington, Kentucky; and the Sedgeley Porter&#x27;s house in Philadelphia. As one of Latrobe&#x27;s most avant-garde designs, the Pope Villa has national significance for its unique design. He also introduced Gothic Revival architecture to the United States with the design of Sedgeley. The mansion was built in 1799 and demolished in 1857; however, the stone Porter&#x27;s house at Sedgeley remains as his only extant building in Philadelphia. A theme seen in many of Latrobe&#x27;s designs is plans with squarish-dimensions and a central, multi-story hall with a cupola to provide lighting, which was contrary to the popular trend of the time of building houses with long narrow plans.

<doc id="151441" wikidata="Q3393020" url="?curid=151441" title="Foreign relations of Monaco">
<text>The Principality of Monaco is a sovereign and independent state, linked closely to France by the Treaty of July 1918, which was formally noted in Article 436 of the Treaty of Versailles of 1919. The foreign policy of Monaco is one illustration of this accord: France has agreed to defend the independence and sovereignty of Monaco, while the Monegasque Government has agreed to exercise its sovereign rights in conformity with French interests, whilst at the same time maintaining complete independence. Since then, the relations between the sovereign states of France and Monaco have been further defined in the Treaty of 1945 and the Agreement of 1963.

Although not a member of the European Union (EU), Monaco is closely associated with the economic apparatus of the EU through its customs union with France and its reliance upon the euro as its official currency.

Monaco actively participates in the United Nations, which it joined in 1993. Monaco joined the Council of Europe on October 4, 2004. Monaco also is a member of many international and intergovernmental organizations, including Interpol, the UNESCO, and the World Health Organization (WHO). The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) is headquartered in Monaco.

The foreign relations are managed by the Department of External Relations.

<doc id="151442" wikidata="Q1389258" url="?curid=151442" title="Prince Henrik of Denmark">
<text>Prince Henrik of Denmark (; born Henri Marie Jean André de Laborde de Monpezat; 11 June 1934 – 13 February 2018) was the husband of Margrethe II of Denmark. He served as her royal consort from Margrethe&#x27;s accession on 14 January 1972 until his death in 2018.

Henrik was born in the French commune of Talence near Bordeaux to an old French family, the Laborde de Monpezats. He spent his early years in Tonkin in French Indochina (now part of Vietnam), where his family had lived for many years. The family spent the Second World War at the family home in Cahors, France. They returned to French Indochina after the war. However, they were forced to flee following the defeat of the French in the First Indochina War. After completing his education in France and Vietnam, Henrik served in the French Army during the Algerian War. Prior to his marriage to Margrethe, he worked in the diplomatic service. He married Margrethe at the Holmen Church on 10 June 1967 and became her prince consort when she succeeded her father, King Frederik IX, as monarch of Denmark on 14 January 1972.

He had two sons, King Frederik X (born 1968) and Prince Joachim (born 1969), and eight grandchildren. Throughout his time as prince consort, Henrik voiced his displeasure with never being granted the title of king. A keen winemaker, Henrik produced his own wine at his estate in France. He also published many works of poetry. He was the first male consort to a Danish monarch. Henrik retired from his royal duties on 1 January 2016, at the age of 81. He died at Fredensborg Palace on 13 February 2018, after a short illness.

==Early life==
Henrik was born in Talence, Gironde, France. He was the son of André de Laborde de Monpezat (6 May 1907 in Mont-de-Marsan – 23 February 1998 in Le Cayrou) and his then-partner and future wife Renée-Yvonne Doursenot (24 October 1908 in Périgueux – 11 February 2001 in Le Cayrou), who was then married to Prof. Louis Leuret (1881–1962) whom she divorced only in 1940. André de Laborde de Monpezat and Renée Doursenot were married in 1948. He was the second of 9 children and eldest son. He had an older sister, Françoise (1932–2021); three younger brothers, Joseph &quot;Jason&quot; (1938–1957), Étienne (born 1942) and Jean-Baptiste (born 1944); and four younger sisters, Anne-Marie (1936–1938), Thérèse (1940–1959), Catherine (born 1946) and Maurille (1948–2015).

Henrik spent his first five years in Hanoi in Tonkin in French Indochina (now part of Vietnam), where his father looked after family business interests. In 1939, the family returned to Le Cayrou, where they remained during the Second World War. Henrik received homeschooling until 1947, when he went to a Jesuit school in Bordeaux. He returned to Hanoi in Tonkin in 1950, where increasing unrest forced him to fight the Việt Minh, to protect his family&#x27;s lands. He graduated from the French secondary school in Hanoi in 1952. Originally wanting to study to become a pianist at Conservatoire de Paris, he instead chose an education more in line with his father&#x27;s wishes. Between 1952 and 1957 he simultaneously studied law and political science at the Sorbonne, Paris, and Chinese and Vietnamese at the &quot;École Nationale des Langues Orientales&quot; (now known as INALCO). He also studied in Hong Kong in 1957 and Saigon in 1958.

He served as an infantry conscript in the French Army in the Algerian War between 1959 and 1962. He then joined the French Foreign Ministry, working as a Secretary at the embassy in London from 1963 to 1967. While there, he met Princess Margrethe, who was studying at the London School of Economics. The couple secretly dated for a year before Henrik proposed.

==Marriage==
On 10 June 1967 which was the day before his 33rd birthday, he married Princess Margrethe, the heir presumptive to the Danish throne, at the Naval Church of Copenhagen. At the time of the wedding his name was Danicised to Henrik and he was given the title HRH Prince Henrik of Denmark. Prior to the wedding, the Prince converted to Lutheranism from Catholicism. Queen Margrethe and Prince Henrik had two children, King Frederik X and Prince Joachim, and eight grandchildren.

Prince Henrik&#x27;s native language was French, and his second language was Danish. He also spoke fluent English, German, Chinese, and Vietnamese. Although he quickly learned Danish after marrying Margrethe and spoke it regularly for half a century, Danes joked about his grasp of Danish and his pronounced French accent.

==Difficulties with the Danish monarchy==
When Queen Margrethe II ascended the throne, Henrik became the first male consort in Danish history. This meant there were no clear descriptions of his duties. He defined his own role as a supporter of and counsellor to the Queen. However, he felt frustrated with the lack of recognition in title, stating that there was no way to differentiate between his own title and those of his sons and grandsons.

In 2002, Prince Henrik fled Denmark for France and went to stay at the couple&#x27;s Château de Cayx in Cahors in southern France. The cause of his departure from Denmark was a New Year&#x27;s Day reception in which his son, Crown Prince Frederik, had been appointed as host in the absence of Queen Margrethe. Henrik felt &quot;pushed aside, degraded and humiliated&quot; by being relegated to &quot;third place in the royal hierarchy&quot;.

&quot;For many years, I have been Denmark&#x27;s number two&quot;, he said. &quot;I have been satisfied with that role, but I don&#x27;t want to be relegated to number three after so many years.&quot; Henrik departed from Denmark to reflect on his status in the Danish Royal Family. Queen Margrethe flew to France to meet her husband. Henrik stressed that neither his wife nor son were to blame for the incident. The Prince Consort spent three weeks in Caix, and did not appear with his wife as expected at the wedding of Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands and Máxima Zorreguieta. After three weeks, Henrik returned to Denmark.
On 30 April 2008, shortly before the wedding of his younger son, Prince Joachim, to Marie Cavallier, the Queen conferred the new Danish title &quot;Count of Monpezat&quot; () on both of her sons and made it hereditary for their male-line descendants, both male and female. The Queen&#x27;s private secretary Henning Fode commented, &quot;The Queen and the Prince Consort have considered this for quite some time, and it has led to the belief that it was the right thing to do.&quot; In fact, Henrik had mentioned this possibility as far back as 1996 in his published memoir: &quot;During our generation, the future sovereign will perhaps receive approval to see &#x27;Monpezat&#x27; added to the dynastic name of &#x27;Oldenburg-Glücksburg. While being interviewed by the French weekly &quot;Point de Vue&quot; in October 2005, Henrik raised the issue shortly after the birth of Crown Prince Frederik&#x27;s first son, Prince Christian, who is expected to inherit the Danish crown one day: &quot;It also makes him very proud and happy that &quot;Monpezat&quot; will be added to this small grandson&#x27;s future name as Prince of Denmark. &#x27;It is a great joy for me that his French roots will also be remembered.

In her New Year&#x27;s speech to the Danish people on 31 December 2015, Queen Margrethe announced that Prince Henrik would slow down and give up most of his official duties beginning on 1 January 2016. On 14 April 2016, Prince Henrik renounced the title of Prince Consort, which he had been given in 2005.

==Cultural interests and hobbies==

Like his wife, Prince Henrik was deeply interested in art and culture. He was particularly fond of wooden figures and jade, building up collections which he exhibited in 2017 at the museum in Koldinghus. Although he never achieved his ambition of becoming a concert pianist, he continued to play the piano throughout his life. In 2013, he accompanied the pop group Michael Learns to Rock on the piano as they recorded &quot;Echo&quot;, a number which was presented to King Rama IX of Thailand.

Henrik wrote many poems in his native French, some of which have been published in the collections &quot;Chemin faisant&quot; (1982), &quot;Cantabile&quot; (2000), &quot;Les escargots de Marie Lanceline&quot; (2003), &quot;Murmures de vent&quot; (2005), &quot;Frihjul&quot; (&quot;Roue-Libre&quot;, 2010), &quot;Fabula&quot; (2011), &quot;La part des anges&quot; (2013), and &quot;Dans mes nuits sereines&quot; (2014). The symphonic suite &quot;Cantabile&quot; by Frederik Magle is based on Henrik&#x27;s poetry collection &quot;Cantabile&quot; and was premiered by the Danish National Symphony Orchestra at two concerts celebrating Henrik&#x27;s 70th and 75th birthdays in 2004 and 2009. Henrik said about writing poetry (&quot;translated from Danish&quot;): “I see poetry as an opportunity for immersion in a superficial time dominated by news and entertainment that makes us rootless and restless. Poetry takes us closer to the true nature of the world, in poetry we can approach the eternal questions such as love, loneliness and death.”

Henrik was also an excellent cook, inspired by French gastronomic traditions. He usually planned the family meals in collaboration with the court chef, always including his own spices on the table, some from his childhood estates in Asia. In addition to his cookbooks, Henrik often appeared in television programmes showing how he prepared meals in Fredensborg Castle in Denmark or at his French home, the Château de Cayx.

==Death==
In August 2017, Henrik announced he did not wish to be buried next to the Queen, citing his longtime complaint of only being named Prince Consort, and not King Consort. The decision is said to have broken a tradition that began in 1559, and at the time, Queen Margrethe is said to have accepted her husband&#x27;s decision.

On 6 September 2017, it was announced that Prince Henrik was suffering from dementia. On 28 January 2018, he was hospitalized at Rigshospitalet, following a visit to Egypt. It was later revealed that he had a benign tumor in the left lung. His health however worsened, causing Crown Prince Frederik to cut short his visit to South Korea where he was to attend the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang. On 13 February 2018, Prince Henrik was transferred from Rigshospitalet to Fredensborg Palace, where the Danish Royal Court stated he wished to spend the remainder of his life. The Royal Court added that the condition of the Prince remained serious. He died later that day, surrounded by his family.

Following his death, the Court announced a month of royal mourning. Henrik&#x27;s casket was placed in The Palace Chapel at Christiansborg for a &quot;castrum doloris&quot;, where in the following two days, more than 19,000 people went to pay their respects. After a funeral in the Palace Chapel on 20 February, he was cremated, with half of his ashes scattered across Danish seas and half placed in the private section of the gardens at Fredensborg Palace.

==Issue==
Prince Henrik had two sons and eight grandchildren, all born at Rigshospitalet in Copenhagen:

*King Frederik X (born 26 May 1968). He married Mary Donaldson on 14 May 2004 at Copenhagen Cathedral, Copenhagen. The couple have four children:
**Crown Prince Christian (born 15 October 2005)
**Princess Isabella (born 21 April 2007)
**Prince Vincent (born 8 January 2011)
**Princess Josephine (born 8 January 2011)
*Prince Joachim (born 7 June 1969). He married Alexandra Manley on 18 November 1995 at Frederiksborg Palace Church, Hillerød. They divorced on 8 April 2005. He married secondly Marie Cavallier on 24 May 2008 at Møgeltønder Church, Møgeltønder. Joachim has four children, three sons and one daughter:
**Count Nikolai (born 28 August 1999)
**Count Felix (born 22 July 2002)
**Count Henrik (born 4 May 2009)
**Countess Athena (born 24 January 2012)

In 2008, Queen Margrethe II announced that her male-line descendants would bear the additional title of Count or Countess of Monpezat, in recognition of Prince Henrik&#x27;s ancestry. In 2023 the children of Prince Joachim were stripped of their princely titles. They will be known as Counts of Montpezat.

==Titles, styles and honours==
===Titles and styles===
*Before 10 June 1967: &quot;Count&quot; * Henri de Laborde de Monpezat
*10 June 1967 – 2005: His Royal Highness Prince Henrik of Denmark 
*2005 – 14 April 2016: His Royal Highness The Prince Consort of Denmark
*14 April 2016 – 13 February 2018: His Royal Highness Prince Henrik of Denmark
===French nobility and French title of &quot;count&quot; controversy===
Since late in the nineteenth century, some members of the Laborde de Monpezat family bear a title of &quot;count&quot;, but this title (which is not a &quot;courtesy title&quot; in the context of the French nobility rules) is claimed without any legal basis.

Neither the French nobility of the de Laborde de Monpezat family nor this French title of &quot;count&quot; are acknowledged as historically or legally valid by most recent reference authors, specialists of the French nobility who do not consider that the de Laborde de Monpezat family belongs to the French nobility. This family is listed in the &quot;Encyclopédie de la fausse noblesse et de la noblesse d&#x27;apparence&quot; () his name is not in the &quot;Catalogue de la noblesse française&quot; () (2002) from Régis Valette and the author Charondas describes in his book &quot;À quel titre&quot; (Volume 37, 1970) the Laborde de Monpezat as &quot;false nobles, low folk in the 17th century, not received in the states of Béarn due to &#x27;alleged nobility and as having never had nobility in their family. The family&#x27;s surname was &quot;Monpezat&quot; by the time of the French Revolution, without title, until 14 July 1860, when it was changed by imperial decree to &quot;de Laborde-Monpezat&quot;, and legally changed again on 19 May 1861 to &quot;de Laborde de Monpezat&quot;.
Although Danish law never required that royal spouses be of aristocratic origin, no heir&#x27;s marriage to a person who lacked male-line descent from royalty or titled nobility had been accepted as dynastic by the sovereign in the course of Denmark&#x27;s history as a hereditary monarchy, until the marriage of the heir presumptive, Princess Margrethe, in June 1967 to &quot;Count&quot; Henri de Laborde de Monpezat. Six months later Margrethe&#x27;s first cousin, Prince Ingolf of Denmark, married an untitled commoner and was demoted to a count, and when another cousin, Prince Christian of Denmark, also wed a Dane, Anne Dorte Maltoft-Nielsen, in 1971, he forfeited his dynastic position.

In 2008, the hereditary title of &quot;Count of Monpezat&quot; (&quot;Greve af Monpezat&quot;) was granted by the Queen to her and Prince Henrik&#x27;s two sons, as a proper Danish title of nobility unrelated to a French noble title whatever, but in recognition of Prince Henrik&#x27;s French background.

<text>Hyper-threading (officially called Hyper-Threading Technology or HT Technology and abbreviated as HTT or HT) is Intel&#x27;s proprietary simultaneous multithreading (SMT) implementation used to improve parallelization of computations (doing multiple tasks at once) performed on x86 microprocessors. It was introduced on Xeon server processors in February 2002 and on Pentium 4 desktop processors in November 2002. Since then, Intel has included this technology in Itanium, Atom, and Core &#x27;i&#x27; Series CPUs, among others.

For each processor core that is physically present, the operating system addresses two virtual (logical) cores and shares the workload between them when possible. The main function of hyper-threading is to increase the number of independent instructions in the pipeline; it takes advantage of superscalar architecture, in which multiple instructions operate on separate data in parallel. With HTT, one physical core appears as two processors to the operating system, allowing concurrent scheduling of two processes per core. In addition, two or more processes can use the same resources: If resources for one process are not available, then another process can continue if its resources are available.

In addition to requiring simultaneous multithreading support in the operating system, hyper-threading can be properly utilized only with an operating system specifically optimized for it.

== Overview ==
Hyper-Threading Technology is a form of simultaneous multithreading technology introduced by Intel, while the concept behind the technology has been patented by Sun Microsystems. Architecturally, a processor with Hyper-Threading Technology consists of two logical processors per core, each of which has its own processor architectural state. Each logical processor can be individually halted, interrupted or directed to execute a specified thread, independently from the other logical processor sharing the same physical core.

Unlike a traditional dual-processor configuration that uses two separate physical processors, the logical processors in a hyper-threaded core share the execution resources. These resources include the execution engine, caches, and system bus interface; the sharing of resources allows two logical processors to work with each other more efficiently, and allows a logical processor to borrow resources from a stalled logical core (assuming both logical cores are associated with the same physical core). A processor stalls when it must wait for data it has requested, in order to finish processing the present thread. The degree of benefit seen when using a hyper-threaded, or multi-core, processor depends on the needs of the software, and how well it and the operating system are written to manage the processor efficiently.

Hyper-threading works by duplicating certain sections of the processor—those that store the architectural state—but not duplicating the main execution resources. This allows a hyper-threading processor to appear as the usual &quot;physical&quot; processor plus an extra &quot;logical&quot; processor to the host operating system (HTT-unaware operating systems see two &quot;physical&quot; processors), allowing the operating system to schedule two threads or processes simultaneously and appropriately. When execution resources in a hyper-threaded processor are not in use by the current task, and especially when the processor is stalled, those execution resources can be used to execute another scheduled task. (The processor may stall due to a cache miss, branch misprediction, or data dependency.)

This technology is transparent to operating systems and programs. The minimum that is required to take advantage of hyper-threading is symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) support in the operating system, since the logical processors appear no different to the operating system than physical processors.

It is possible to optimize operating system behavior on multi-processor, hyper-threading capable systems. For example, consider an SMP system with two physical processors that are both hyper-threaded (for a total of four logical processors). If the operating system&#x27;s thread scheduler is unaware of hyper-threading, it will treat all four logical processors the same. If only two threads are eligible to run, it might choose to schedule those threads on the two logical processors that happen to belong to the same physical processor. That processor would be extremely busy, and would share execution resources, while the other processor would remain idle, leading to poorer performance than if the threads were scheduled on different physical processors. This problem can be avoided by improving the scheduler to treat logical processors differently from physical processors, which is, in a sense, a limited form of the scheduler changes required for NUMA systems.

== History ==
The first published paper describing what is now known as hyper-threading in a general purpose computer was written by Edward S. Davidson and Leonard. E. Shar in 1973.

Denelcor, Inc. introduced multi-threading with the Heterogeneous Element Processor (HEP) in 1982. The HEP pipeline could not hold multiple instructions from the same process. Only one instruction from a given process was allowed to be present in the pipeline at any point in time. Should an instruction from a given process block the pipe, instructions from other processes would continue after the pipeline drained.

US patent for the technology behind hyper-threading was granted to Kenneth Okin at Sun Microsystems in November 1994. At that time, CMOS process technology was not advanced enough to allow for a cost-effective implementation.

Intel implemented hyper-threading on an x86 architecture processor in 2002 with the Foster MP-based Xeon. It was also included on the 3.06 GHz Northwood-based Pentium 4 in the same year, and then remained as a feature in every Pentium 4 HT, Pentium 4 Extreme Edition and Pentium Extreme Edition processor since. The Intel Core &amp; Core 2 processor lines (2006) that succeeded the Pentium 4 model line didn&#x27;t utilize hyper-threading. The processors based on the Core microarchitecture did not have hyper-threading because the Core microarchitecture was a descendant of the older P6 microarchitecture. The P6 microarchitecture was used in earlier iterations of Pentium processors, namely, the Pentium Pro, Pentium II and Pentium III (plus their Celeron &amp; Xeon derivatives at the time). Windows 2000 SP3 and Windows XP SP1 have added support for hyper-threading.

Intel released the Nehalem microarchitecture (Core i7) in November 2008, in which hyper-threading made a return. The first generation Nehalem processors contained four physical cores and effectively scaled to eight threads. Since then, both two- and six-core models have been released, scaling four and twelve threads respectively. Earlier Intel Atom cores were in-order processors, sometimes with hyper-threading ability, for low power mobile PCs and low-price desktop PCs. The Itanium 9300 launched with eight threads per processor (two threads per core) through enhanced hyper-threading technology. The next model, the Itanium 9500 (Poulson), features a 12-wide issue architecture, with eight CPU cores with support for eight more virtual cores via hyper-threading. The Intel Xeon 5500 server chips also utilize two-way hyper-threading.

== Performance claims ==
According to Intel, the first hyper-threading implementation used only 5% more die area than the comparable non-hyperthreaded processor, but the performance was 15–30% better. Intel claims up to a 30% performance improvement compared with an otherwise identical, non-simultaneous multithreading Pentium 4. Tom&#x27;s Hardware states: &quot;In some cases a P4 running at 3.0 GHz with HT on can even beat a P4 running at 3.6 GHz with HT turned off.&quot; Intel also claims significant performance improvements with a hyper-threading-enabled Pentium 4 processor in some artificial-intelligence algorithms.

Overall the performance history of hyper-threading was a mixed one in the beginning. As one commentary on high-performance computing from November 2002 notes:

Hyper-Threading can improve the performance of some MPI applications, but not all. Depending on the cluster configuration and, most importantly, the nature of the application running on the cluster, performance gains can vary or even be negative. The next step is to use performance tools to understand what areas contribute to performance gains and what areas contribute to performance degradation.
As a result, performance improvements are very application-dependent; however, when running two programs that require full attention of the processor, it can actually seem like one or both of the programs slows down slightly when Hyper-Threading Technology is turned on. This is due to the replay system of the Pentium 4 tying up valuable execution resources, equalizing the processor resources between the two programs, which adds a varying amount of execution time. The Pentium 4 &quot;Prescott&quot; and the Xeon &quot;Nocona&quot; processors received a replay queue that reduces execution time needed for the replay system and completely overcomes the performance penalty.

According to a November 2009 analysis by Intel, performance impacts of hyper-threading result in increased overall latency in case the execution of threads does not result in significant overall throughput gains, which vary by the application. In other words, overall processing latency is significantly increased due to hyper-threading, with the negative effects becoming smaller as there are more simultaneous threads that can effectively use the additional hardware resource utilization provided by hyper-threading. A similar performance analysis is available for the effects of hyper-threading when used to handle tasks related to managing network traffic, such as for processing interrupt requests generated by network interface controllers (NICs). Another paper claims no performance improvements when hyper-threading is used for interrupt handling.

== Drawbacks ==

When the first HT processors were released, many operating systems were not optimized for hyper-threading technology (e.g. Windows 2000 and Linux older than 2.4).

In 2006, hyper-threading was criticised for energy inefficiency. For example, ARM (a specialized, low-power, CPU design company), stated that simultaneous multithreading can use up to 46% more power than ordinary dual-core designs. Furthermore, they claimed that SMT increases cache thrashing by 42%, whereas dual core results in a 37% decrease.

In 2010, ARM said it might include simultaneous multithreading in its future chips; however, this was rejected in favor of their 2012 64-bit design. ARM produced SMT cores in 2018.

In 2013, Intel dropped SMT in favor of out-of-order execution for its Silvermont processor cores, as they found this gave better performance with better power efficiency than a lower number of cores with SMT.

In 2017, it was revealed that Intel&#x27;s Skylake and Kaby Lake processors had a bug in their implementation of hyper-threading that could cause data loss. Microcode updates were later released to address the issue.

In 2019, with Coffee Lake, Intel temporarily moved away from including hyper-threading in mainstream Core i7 desktop processors except for highest-end Core i9 parts or Pentium Gold CPUs. It also began to recommend disabling hyper-threading, as new CPU vulnerability attacks were revealed which could be mitigated by disabling HT.

== Security ==
In May 2005, Colin Percival demonstrated that a malicious thread on a Pentium 4 can use a timing-based side-channel attack to monitor the memory access patterns of another thread with which it shares a cache, allowing the theft of cryptographic information. This is not actually a timing attack, as the malicious thread measures the time of only its own execution. Potential solutions to this include the processor changing its cache eviction strategy or the operating system preventing the simultaneous execution, on the same physical core, of threads with different privileges. In 2018 the OpenBSD operating system has disabled hyper-threading &quot;in order to avoid data potentially leaking from applications to other software&quot; caused by the Foreshadow/L1TF vulnerabilities. In 2019 a set of vulnerabilities led to security experts recommending the disabling of hyper-threading on all devices.

<doc id="151444" wikidata="Q1399598" url="?curid=151444" title="Jurassic 5">
<text>Jurassic 5 (Stylized JuraSsic 5) is an American alternative hip hop group formed by rappers Charles Stewart (Chali 2na), Dante Givens (Akil), Courtenay Henderson (Soup aka Zaakir), Marc Stuart (Marc 7); and disc jockeys Mark Potsic (DJ Nu-Mark) and Lucas Macfadden (Cut Chemist). 
The six piece crew that was formed, came out of the Los Angeles venue Good Life.
The group broke up in 2007,
shortly after releasing the LP &quot;Feedback&quot;, citing &quot;musical differences,&quot; but returned to the stage in 2013 and released a new track in 2014. The members have continued to release music individually.

==History==
Jurassic 5 debuted nationally in 1995 from TVT Records with their first single &quot;Unified Rebelution&quot;. Jurassic 5 released &quot;Jurassic 5 EP&quot;, their first record, in 1997. It &quot;cemented their position in the 1990s alternative hip hop movement, alongside artists such as Company Flow, Black Star and Kool Keith.&quot; The group later signed to Interscope Records, and the EP was repackaged with additional tracks and released in December 1998 as the full-length, eponymous debut album titled &quot;Jurassic 5&quot;. In a 2002 interview with &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, the group explained the origin of their name. Chali 2na said &quot;I played the song to my friend&#x27;s mother and she made a joke: &#x27;You guys think you sound like the Fantastic Five, but you sound more like the Jurassic Five.&#x27; And we started laughing but, well, the name stuck.&quot;

This was followed by the album &quot;Quality Control&quot;, which peaked at #43 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

In 2002, they released &quot;Power In Numbers&quot;, which peaked at #15 on the Billboard 200 chart.

Jurassic 5 eventually toured without Cut Chemist, who left the group to pursue a solo career. The remaining five members released &quot;Feedback&quot;, their final album, on July 25, 2006. The album peaked at #15 on the Billboard 200.

The group split in 2007. Reasons for the break-up were attributed to disagreements among members of the group.

In 2013, the group re-formed, including the return of Cut Chemist, for the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival and an international tour, primarily in the UK but also including dates in Ireland, Portugal, Spain, Japan and the United States. They played at Glastonbury in 2014 and had a Word of Mouth Reunion Tour during the Summer of 2014.

In 2016, they released their first new song in a decade, &quot;Customer Service&quot;.

==In other media==
Jurassic 5&#x27;s music has been used in several video games. In 2000, &quot;Jayou&quot; was featured in &quot;Grind Session&quot;. The track &quot;Improvise&quot; from the album &quot;Quality Control&quot; was featured on the North American version of &quot;Jet Set Radio&quot;, also released in 2000. The European, Australasian, and Japanese pressings of the game have the track &quot;Concrete And Clay&quot; instead - and an instrumental version of the same song. The following year, the track &quot;Great Expectations&quot; from the same album was also included in &quot;Mat Hoffman&#x27;s Pro BMX&quot;. In 2002, &quot;What&#x27;s Golden&quot; was featured on &quot;ATV Offroad Fury 2&quot;. The song was additionally included in the video game &quot;Forza Horizon 3&quot; on the fictional radio &#x27;Block Party&#x27;. &quot;A Day At The Races&quot; featuring Big Daddy Kane and Percee P appeared in the 2003 skateboarding game &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Underground&quot;. The song &quot;In The House&quot; from &quot;Feedback&quot; was featured in &quot;NBA Live 06&quot;. and &quot;Work it Out&quot; was in &quot;NBA Live 07&quot;, while &quot;Red Hot&quot; was featured in &quot;SSX on Tour&quot;. &quot;Sum of Us&quot; and &quot;High Fidelity&quot; from &quot;Power in Numbers&quot; was included in the 2019 game &quot;Trials Rising&quot;.

The group was featured in the 2001 hip hop documentary &quot;Scratch&quot; and ranked among the online magazine &quot;UrbanSouth&quot;″s elite list of underground hip hop albums.

In December 2024, “Jayou” received renewed attention when it was used in the “See You in the Morning” advertising campaign by Kellogg’s.

<doc id="151445" wikidata="Q130408" url="?curid=151445" title="Sophia of Nassau">
<text>Sophia of Nassau (Sophia Wilhelmine Marianne Henriette; 9 July 1836 – 30 December 1913), also Sofia, was Queen of Sweden and Norway as the wife of King Oscar II. She was Queen of Sweden for 35 years, longer than anyone before her, and the longest-serving queen until 2011, when she was surpassed by Queen Silvia. She is also the most recent woman to have been officially Dowager Queen of Sweden.

== Early life ==
Sophia was the youngest daughter of Wilhelm, Duke of Nassau, by his second wife Princess Pauline Friederike Marie of Württemberg.

Her father died when she was three and was succeeded by her half-brother Adolphe, Grand Duke of Luxembourg. Sophia was given what was considered a suitable education for princesses at the time by private tutors. She was trained in fencing, a sport normally reserved for males, to strengthen her back and correct her posture.
Sophia socialized with academics and artists, and the court of Nassau was considered more democratic than what was usual at most German courts. She learned the English language early on and felt sympathy for the British parliamentarian system. The language spoken in her childhood home was not German but English. Sophia was given what has been referred to as an upbringing more similar to the middle-class Victorian life style, which she preferred rather than a royal one. Her brothers used to refer to her as Unsere demokratische Schwester (our democratic sister). She was described as serious, intelligent and dutiful, and interested in language and history: she was also genuinely religious.

In 1848, she witnessed a rebellion in the Duchy of Nassau, which was suppressed by her mother and brothers. She spent the winter of 1853-54 with her mother at the court of her maternal aunt in Saint Petersburg in Russia. Her maternal aunt, Princess Charlotte of Württemberg, was married to Grand Duke Michael Pavlovich of Russia. The trip was not made to arrange a marriage with a Russian prince because her mother did not wish her to convert, which would have been necessary, but rather, to have her study the life in a grand court. During her stay in Russia, she was a student of the pianist Anton Rubinstein. Sophia and her mother were forced to leave Russia at the outbreak of the Crimean war. After the death of her mother in 1856, Sophia lived with her half-sister, Princess Marie Wilhemine of Wied.

In July 1856, at her sister Marie&#x27;s summer residence Monrepos castle outside Nassau, she received a visit from Prince Oscar of Sweden, Duke of Östergötland. Oscar was the second living son of the reigning king. Following the death of his elder brother Gustaf in 1852, he had become the future heir to the Swedish throne because his brother, the reigning Crown Prince, was unable to have more children with his spouse. It was therefore politically necessary for Oscar to marry. In 1855-56, Oscar was sent to visit various royal courts in Europe in order to find a suitable marriage partner in both rank and to his own taste. He visited the British court but did not wish to marry Princess Mary of Cambridge, and the Belgian and Prussian princesses who had been suggested did not wish to marry him. The marriage of Sophia and Oscar should not be regarded as an arranged marriage: Oscar had been given the freedom to choose a princess he liked from the many courts he visited, and Sophia, who had previously been proposed to, did not wish to be pressured into marriage. Sophia and Oscar, however, fell in love with each other.

After the visit, Oscar returned to Sweden to ask for his parents&#x27; consent to marry, which was granted. He then returned to Nassau, where the engagement was made in September and announced in October. During the engagement, Sophia was educated in the Swedish language and history, and corresponded with her future spouse: soon, the correspondence was conducted in Swedish. She also mastered Norwegian quickly.

== Duchess and crown princess ==
Sophia and Oscar were married on 6 June 1857 at the Castle in Wiesbaden-Biebrich. Sophia arrived in the city of Stockholm with Oscar on 19 June 1857, and was met by her Swedish Mistress of the Robes, countess Wilhelmina Bonde, and her maid of honor Augusta Jegerhjelm at the ship Travemünde. There they were greeted with salutes, singing and crowds. Sophia was received with great enthusiasm upon her arrival in Sweden. Since the current Crown Princess Louise had become sterile after delivering her last child, and the elder brother of Oscar, Crown Prince Charles, had no son and his daughter was not accepted as heir to the throne under the present constitution, Sophia was seen as the solution of the succession problem and future Queen. She was dressed in blue at her arrival, and was therefore nicknamed The Blue Duchess. At the palace, she was first presented for the royal court, and then introduced to the royal family in the salon of the queen. Upon meeting the king, who was by then described as almost deranged and placed under the regency of the crown prince, she rushed to him, curtsied and embraced him.

In 1858, Sophia gave birth to a son, which secured the Bernadotte dynasty and gave her much popularity. The birth took place at Drottningholm Palace according to old court protocol, with the entire court and members of the government present in the chamber outside of the bedroom as witnesses. Following the death of her father-in-law King Oscar I in 1859, her brother-in-law became King Charles XV and her husband the heir presumptive.

The couple were given Arvfurstens palats in Stockholm as their residence. Sophia was described as calm and controlled, practical and sensible. She had a good relationship with her parents-in-law and her sister-in-law Princess Eugénie. Her relationship to Charles XV and Queen Louise was, however, tense. Sophia, herself strictly moral, disliked the French-influenced frivolity of her brother-in-law Charles XV&#x27;s court.

By 1861, Sophia had given birth three times in three years, and after this her health was frail. The same year she made a trip to Nizza to cure her health, and she continued to make trips for health reasons. The next trip was made in 1863; this time to Germany. In 1864, she engaged in the building of their summer residence Sofiero Palace by Öresund, which was named after her. In Sofiero they could remain in contact with the Danish royal family at Fredensborg on the other side of Öresund. The gatherings at Sofiero would sometimes be given a political dimension as the center of family councils.

Sophia exercised strong discipline over her children. Her decision to breastfeed, at that time unusual for the upper class, attracted attention. She also aroused attention when she in 1869 placed her sons in a public school rather than letting them be educated at home as had been the tradition in the royal house. This was the Christian boys&#x27; school Beskowska Skolan of the theologian and vicar Gustaf Emanuel Beskow, whose sermons she often attended. Sophia had always had a very close interest in religion—an interest she shared with her sister-in-law Eugenie, in whose company she was introduced to various different Christian branches. From 1866, she was the chairperson of the charity organisation Allmänna skyddsföreningen (The Protection Society) for poor women in Stockholm.

Sophia was interested in politics and engaged herself in state affairs during her life, and was occasionally present as an observer during the parliamentary sessions. In 1866 her birth country, the Duchy of Nassau, was annexed by Prussia. After this, she kept an anti-Prussian view. In the summer of 1870, she was present in Ems where she met both the Emperor of Russia and the King of Prussia shortly before the declaration of the war, and kept herself informed about the political situation. She did not oppose the united Empire of Germany as such, but disliked how it had been created and the dominance of Prussia. She did, however, have a good personal relationship with Crown Prince Frederick William of Prussia and his consort Victoria, Princess Royal.

== Queen of Sweden and Norway==

Upon the death of her brother-in-law on 18 September 1872, Sophia became queen consort of Sweden and Norway. At that time, there was a tense political situation and demands for a republic. Oscar was initially not popular, but there were hopes that he would let himself be guided by the advice of Sophia, who was considered politically insightful. Also in Norway, there were hopes that Sophia would use her influence on Oscar to introduce a more equal place in the union. Sophia was crowned with Oscar in Stockholm in Sweden 12 May and in Trondhjem (now Trondheim) in Norway 18 June 1873. In Norway, the couple made a tour around the country in connection to the coronation which has been described as a triumph.

In 1875, the king and queen made a tour in Europe. They first visited Denmark and after this Berlin and then Dresden. The visit to King Albert of Saxony and his Queen, Carola of Vasa in Dresden was considered significant, as this meant a symbolic peace between the Bernadotte dynasty and the deposed Vasa dynasty, as Queen Carola was the granddaughter of the deposed king Gustav IV Adolf and let it be known that the past was forgotten. After Dresden, Sophia interrupted the tour for health reasons while Oscar continued to Weimar and Russia. Another important event was the uncovering of the statue of Charles XIV John in Christiania (since 1926 Oslo) on 7 September 1875, which was celebrated with great festivities with invited foreign royalty and military parades and considered a memorable propaganda occasion. Another important event as Queen of Norway was the stay at Moss in 1877 with the former Prince Imperial Napoleon of France.
During the autumns, the royal couples normally stayed at Drottningholm Palace, where they received foreign royal dignitaries and hosted ceremonial parties. During the winters, they engaged in representation in both Stockholm and in Christiania. When visiting Norway, they were met by the border by a separate Norwegian court, who served during their stay there. In Norway, her principal ladies-in-waiting were Alette Due and Elise Løvenskiold. Sophia was known to dress spectacular at formal occasions, with many jewels, much lace and ornaments and bright colors such as red and blue. Oscar II normally spent his summers with his friends at his yacht &quot;Drott&quot; at Marstrand, while Sophia often spent her summers first at the Ulriksdal Palace, and in later years more often in Norway. From 1892 until 1904, she spent her Norwegian summers at Skinnarbøl manor outside Kongsvinger, where she is remembered for her simple life style and generosity toward the local population. She was popular in Norway, and described as the queen who had spent the most time in Norway among all the queens during the union Sweden-Norway.

Sophia herself described the years between 1873 and 1878 as years of crisis for her. During these years, Oscar had several affairs, notably with Magda von Dolcke and with Marie Friberg. Oscar&#x27;s affair with Magda von Dolcke begun in 1874 and attracted great attention, and he benefited her career at the Royal Dramatic theatre and gave her an allowance. Though she did not demonstrate, Sophia is believed to have suffered from his adultery. It is related how Sophia traveled to Germany to look for comfort with her half sister Marie of Wied, who, it is believed, advised her to accept the situation. At one occasion, the king had a courtier sent to the opera singer Ida Basilier-Magelssen with a request of a &quot;private audience&quot;, and she replied: &quot;Tell His Majesty that he may have a private audience with his good and beautiful Queen. I have others things to do than to have private conferences with old gentlemen!&quot; Being told of this, Queen Sophia sent for Basilier-Magelssen and their meeting reportedly ended with mutual tears over their adulterous husbands. Her health requested her to take frequent trips abroad, and her marriage apparently underwent a crisis where her marital relations were discontinued. The marital crisis was observed and mentioned by her closest surroundings, and during a trip on the continent in 1876, Sophia sent Oscar what she referred to as a farewell letter.

The year of 1878 was a turning point for Queen Sophia. This year she became a follower of the teachings of the British preacher Lord Radstock, to whom she was introduced by her lady-in-waiting Märta Eketrä. After this, she spent a great deal of her everyday life in prayer with her favorite ladies-in-waiting Eketrä, Ebba von Rosen and Ida Wedel-Jarlsberg. 
Oscar II was skeptical toward this because of his position as the head of the Swedish church, but their relationship was in fact improved after her new religious conviction.

Queen Sophia was after 1878 much engaged in her religious interests, and her work for the so-called new evangelical movement was quite significant. This made her less interested in participating in representation and society life, and Carl Fleetwood remarked that the master of her court was in fact reverend Beskow. She eventually restricted participation in court and society life to when it was absolutely necessary. When she attended the Amaranter Ball in 1885, the occasion was rare enough to attract attention. Sophia preferred a private life, such as dinners and musical soirees in the company of family members and her ladies-in-waiting. Queen Sophia suffered from poor health: in 1875-1877, for example, she was almost constantly absent abroad for health reasons, and though it was better after 1877, she continued to visit particularly Amsterdam for the medical care of Doctor Metzger. During a visit to Paris, she caused great attention when she dined at a public restaurant: this was unusual for a royal woman at this time, and it was also the only time she ever did that. In 1885, her son Prince Carl, Duke of Västergötland Carl fell sick in Istanbul, and she and Oscar II visited the Ottoman Empire, where they were received by Sultan Abdul Hamid II and Sophia was given permission to visit the Imperial Harem. They also visited Romania. 

Queen Sophia performed a great effort in her work to improve medical care, and founded the first nursing school in Sweden. She studied the work of Florence Nightingale, and visited Great Britain with Oscar in 1881, where they were received by Queen Victoria. During her visit, she studied the modern medical institutions in London. Upon her return, she launched a project to educate professional nurses in Sweden. This work was only just started by the pioneering work of Emmy Rappe in 1867, but there was as yet no proper educational institution for nurses, and the medical world was sceptical. In 1882 she managed to arrange classes for nurses at the Sabbatsberg Hospital; 1884 she opened the Sophiahemmet University College for the students; and in 1889 it was developed to the Sophiahemmet, a combined hospital and school for nurses. The Sophiahemmet was seen as a role model for the education of nurses in Sweden, and it is also seen as the proper establishment of the nurse profession in Sweden. Sophia was very active in increasing respect for the nursing profession among doctors, who did not consider the work to be suitable for an educated female, and to make the profession respected, she wished for the profession to be seen as a religious calling and that it be undertaken by medically educated women, and she encouraged upper-class women to be nurses, all because she wanted nurses to be respected: the first head of her nursing school was the noble Alfhild Ehrenborg, who was a student of Florence Nightingale, and the Queen was actively involved in the institution until her death. In her nursing school, even students from the aristocracy were expected to scrub the floors. Two students of Sophiahemmet, Alma Brunskog and Olga Claréus was to have great significance for the medical care in Norway. Sophia chaired about fifty different charity organisations in Sweden and Norway. She received help seekers once a week, supported The Salvation Army and founded many organisations herself.

Sophia was reportedly closest to her sons Oscar, whose religious interests she shared, and Eugen. In 1886, she supported Eugen, who wanted to study art in Paris. She also supported Oscar in his wish to marry the noble lady-in-waiting Ebba Munck af Fulkila. Her son Eugen said of her that human worth and justice almost had a higher standing with her than her deep piety. In 1887, she was forced to undergo an ovariotomy operation. The operation was considered potentially life-threatening. Before the operation, she made her will. She also took a vow of Oscar II, that should she survive the operation, the King would allow for Oscar to finally marry Ebba Munck. After the operation, Oscar made use of this and the wedding could finally take place. The surgery was considered a success, but afterwards she had difficulty walking and was occasionally forced to use a wheelchair. Despite this she continued riding.

In 1881, she attended the wedding of her son, Crown Prince Gustav, to Victoria of Baden in Karlsruhe. Sophia had preferred her son to marry Princess Beatrice of the United Kingdom, as she had great admiration for Queen Victoria, but was initially very enthusiastic about the choice of Victoria of Baden, as she was a descendant of the former Swedish Vasa dynasty. Her relationship with her daughter-in-law was, however, to become tense. Sophia and Victoria had opposing political views, and Sophia took offence when Gustav started to listen to Victoria rather than to her, while Victoria criticized Sophia&#x27;s influence on the king: the German diplomat Eulenberg reported that Victoria had stated, that Queen Sophia pressured the King to give in to the opposition to avoid conflicts, that she was relentlessly willful and that Oscar was afraid of her. Sophia disliked Victoria&#x27;s cousin Emperor William II of Germany with whom she had several conflicts.

Politically, Sophia has been described as liberal and almost democratic in her views. Her political influence upon Oscar II is regarded as significant. She is regarded to have acted as his political adviser and is known to have used her political influence on several occasions, at least after 1878. Sophia showed a great interest in Norway and the questions surrounding the union between Sweden and Norway. The King was expected to visit Norway regularly during a reign when the crisis of the union became more and more frequent, and the Queen normally accompanied him, sometimes also against his will. In Kristiania, she often invited the spouses of politicians to the Royal Palace and created an important net of contacts from both the right wing royalists and the left wing republicans. In 1882-84, there was a serious crisis in Norway and talk of revolution, which eventually led to the ban of the royal veto and the loss of royal power there, and she was actively involved in the crisis. Though opposed to the reform, she saw it necessary to give in. Yngvar Nielsen related a scene when he read the news for the Queen: the King entered to room, fell on his knees before her and said: &quot;Yes, Sophia, now you are in!&quot;, upon which she kissed his hand before he rose and stated that he took it hard but that he would keep his word. During the 1884 crisis, her influence was evident as it was she who convinced Oscar to allow the left wing Johan Sverdrup to form a Norwegian government: &quot;Her influence over the King was great and well known. She was as firm as he was weak, as calm as he was unstable and nervous. Until March 1884 she supported him in his resistance, but in April 1884 she changed strategy and realized that resistance would only damage the monarchy. As early as that, she told the King to support Johan Sverdrup.&quot; 

During the union crisis of 1895, when the Norwegian wished to have their own embassies, the royal family had a family council at the sick bed of the queen in the presence of the German Emperor William II. William recommended united German-Swedish military intervention, but Sophia firmly forbade anything of the sort, told the Emperor that he did not understand the situation and advocated friendly negotiations. During the crisis of 1898, the Norwegians began to use their own flag, Oscar II threatened to abdicate and Prime Minister Boström to resign. The queen calmed the situation and convinced them both to remain at their posts. Queen Sophia is credited with using her influence to prevent military intervention and war during the dissolution of the union Sweden-Norway in 1905.

==Queen dowager==

In 1907, Oscar II died and she became queen dowager. Though she no longer could exert any influence upon the affairs of state, she kept herself updated on politics. The dissolution of the union Sweden-Norway meant she no longer visited Norway, but she continued her trips to Great Britain and the continent: in 1909, for example, she visited Germany by car. She spent her last years engaging in philanthropy and in the Sophiahemmet, where she continued to be the acting chairperson. Her last official assignment was the exam celebration of the nurses at Sophiahemmet, one of whom was her granddaughter Maria Bernadotte, daughter of Prince Oscar and Ebba Munck: when the turn came to Maria, Sophia forgot her words and embraced her. She died a few days later.

Queen Sophia believed in the view of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom: that the private life of a royal person should be a good example for her subjects, and she was a respected figure in this aspect.

== Children ==
Sophia&#x27;s children were:

* King Gustav V (1858–1950; ), ancestor of Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden and Frederik X of Denmark
* Prince Oscar, Duke of Gotland, later Count Oscar Bernadotte af Wisborg (1859–1953)
* Prince Carl, Duke of Västergötland (1861–1951), ancestor of Harald V of Norway, Henri, Grand Duke of Luxembourg, and Philippe of Belgium
* Prince Eugén, Duke of Närke (1865–1947)

Sophia was the half-sister of Adolphe, Grand Duke of Luxembourg (who was also the last reigning Duke of Nassau), who created the title Count of Wisborg in the Luxembourgish nobility for Sophia&#x27;s son Oscar, who lost his succession rights and titles by marrying without the King&#x27;s consent.

<doc id="151447" wikidata="Q11024667" url="?curid=151447" title="Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin">
<text>The Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin () was a duchy in northern Germany created in 1701, when Frederick William and Adolphus Frederick II divided the Duchy of Mecklenburg between Schwerin and Strelitz. Ruled by the successors of the Nikloting House of Mecklenburg, Mecklenburg-Schwerin remained a state of the Holy Roman Empire along the Baltic Sea littoral between Holstein-Glückstadt and the Duchy of Pomerania.

==Origins==
The dynasty&#x27;s progenitor, Niklot (1090–1160), was a chief of the Slavic Obotrite tribal federation, who fought against the advancing Saxons and was finally defeated in 1160 by Henry the Lion in the course of the Wendish Crusade. Niklot&#x27;s son, Pribislav, submitted to Henry, and in 1167 came into his paternal inheritance as the first Prince of Mecklenburg.

After various divisions of territory among Pribislav&#x27;s descendants, Henry II of Mecklenburg (1266–1329) by 1312 had acquired the lordships of Stargard and Rostock, and bequeathed the reunified Mecklenburg lands – except for the County of Schwerin and Werle – to his sons, Albert II and John. After they both had received the title of duke, the former lordship of Stargard was recast as the Duchy of Mecklenburg-Stargard for John in 1352. Albert II retained the larger western part of Mecklenburg, and after he acquired the former County of Schwerin in 1358, he made Schwerin his residence.

In 1363 Albert&#x27;s son, Duke Albert III, campaigned in Sweden, where he was crowned king one year later. In 1436, William, the last Lord of Werle, died without a male heir. Because William&#x27;s son-in-law, Ulric II of Mecklenburg-Stargard, had no issue, his line became extinct upon Ulric&#x27;s death in 1471. All possessions fell back to Duke Henry IV of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, who was then the sole ruler over all of Mecklenburg.

In 1520 Henry&#x27;s grandsons, Henry V and Albert VII, again divided the duchy, creating the subdivision of Mecklenburg-Güstrow, which Duke Adolf Frederick I of Mecklenburg-Schwerin inherited in 1610. In a second partition of 1621, he granted Güstrow to his brother, John Albert II. Both were deposed in 1628 by Albrecht von Wallenstein, as they had supported Christian IV of Denmark in the Thirty Years&#x27; War. Nevertheless, the Swedish Empire forced their restoration three years later. When John Albert II&#x27;s son, Duke Gustav Adolph, died without male heirs in 1695, Mecklenburg was reunited once more under Frederick William, Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin.

==History==
In June 1692, when Christian Louis I died in exile and without sons, a dispute arose about the succession to his duchy between his brother, Adolphus Frederick II, and his nephew, Frederick William. The emperor and the rulers of Sweden and of the Electorate of Brandenburg took part in this struggle, which was intensified three years later, when on the death of Gustav Adolph, the family ruling over Mecklenburg-Güstrow became extinct. In 1701, with the endorsement of the Imperial state of the Lower Saxon Circle, the Treaty of Hamburg (1701) was signed and the final division of the country was made. Mecklenburg was divided between the two claimants. The Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin was given to Frederick William, and the Duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, roughly a recreation of the medieval Stargard lordship, to Adolphus Frederick II. At the same time, the principle of primogeniture was reasserted, and the right of summoning the joint Landtag was reserved to the ruler of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. Continued conflicts and partitions weakened the rule of the dukes and affirmed the reputation of Mecklenburg as one of the most backward territories of the Empire.

Mecklenburg-Schwerin began its existence during a series of constitutional struggles between the duke and the nobles. The heavy debt incurred by Charles Leopold, who had joined Russian Empire in a war against Sweden, brought matters to a head; Charles VI interfered, and in 1728 the imperial court of justice declared the duke incapable of governing. His brother, Christian Ludwig II, was appointed administrator of the duchy. Under this prince, who became ruler &quot;de jure&quot; in 1747, the Convention of Rostock, by which a new constitution was framed for the duchy, was signed in April 1755. By this instrument, all power lay in the hands of the duke, the nobles, and the upper classes generally; the lower classes were entirely unrepresented. During the Seven Years&#x27; War, Frederick II took a hostile attitude towards Frederick the Great, and in consequence Mecklenburg-Schwerin was occupied by Prussia. In other respects Frederick II&#x27;s rule proved beneficial to the country. In the early years of the French Revolutionary Wars, Frederick Francis I, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin remained neutral, and in 1803 he regained Wismar from the Kingdom of Sweden. In 1806 the territory was overrun by the First French Empire, and in 1808 Frederick Francis I joined the Confederation of the Rhine. He was later the first member of the confederation to abandon Napoleon, to whose armies he had sent a contingent, and in 1813–1814 he fought against France.

==Aftermath==
With the Congress of Vienna in 1815, Frederick Francis I of Mecklenburg-Schwerin received the title of Grand Duke. After the fall of the monarchies in 1918 resulting from World War I, the Grand Duchy became the Free State of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. On 1 January 1934 it was united with the neighbouring Free State of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (both today part of the Germany&#x27;s Bundesland Mecklenburg-Vorpommern).

<doc id="151450" wikidata="Q301365" url="?curid=151450" title="Pieter van Vollenhoven">
<text>Pieter van Vollenhoven Jr. (born 30 April 1939) is the husband of Princess Margriet of the Netherlands and a member, by marriage, of the Dutch royal house.

==Early life and career==
Van Vollenhoven was born in Schiedam, he is the second son of Pieter van Vollenhoven Sr. (1897–1977) and his wife Jacoba Gijsbertha Stuylingh de Lange (1906–1983). The van Vollenhoven family and the Stuylingh de Lange family belong to the Dutch patriciate.

Van Vollenhoven attended secondary school in Rotterdam, and he subsequently studied law at the University of Leiden. He graduated in 1965, after which he worked as a legal officer for the Netherlands Council of State. In 1966, he performed his military service with the Royal Netherlands Air Force, and attained a military pilot license the following year.

==Current positions==
Van Vollenhoven is currently best known in the Netherlands for having been the chairman of the Dutch Safety Board from which he retired in February 2011. He was originally appointed chairman of the Road Transportation Safety Board and the Rail Incident Board by minister Tjerk Westerterp. Following the Bijlmer and Hercules disasters, a need was felt in The Netherlands for a single body to investigate all transportation-related incidents; the Transportation Safety Council (Dutch: &quot;Raad voor de Transportveiligheid&quot;) was created, which incorporated the earlier Road Transportation Safety and Rail Incident Boards and also had Van Vollenhoven as chairman. Van Vollenhoven felt, however, that the country should have a single board to investigate &quot;all&quot; safety-related issues; lobbying on his part finally convinced the government to transform the Transportation Safety Council into a general Safety Board, of which Van Vollenhoven was made the first chairman.

Due to his expertise in the area, the University of Twente made Van Vollenhoven a professor on 1 October 2005. He holds the policy research chair, which is a subspecialty of the risk management group. He held his oration on 28 April 2006, and called for the creation of a Minister of Safety at that time.

In 1989, Van Vollenhoven took the initiative in setting up the Dutch Victim Support Fund, of which he is also the chairman. He is also chairman of the Nationaal Groenfonds, the National Restorationfund and the Society, Safety and Police Association and the International Transport Safety Board. He is a member of the European Transport Safety Council.

===Notable acts===
As Chairman of the Safety Board, Van Vollenhoven oversaw the investigation of the Schipholbrand, a fire in a holding facility for illegal immigrants in The Netherlands. He presented a final report on 21 September 2006, with such devastating findings that ministers Piet Hein Donner and Sybilla Dekker resigned over it. A third responsible minister, Rita Verdonk refused to resign despite her responsibility in the matter.

Following the Turkish Airlines Flight 1951 crash, Van Vollenhoven led the investigation by the Safety Board. This investigation brought him into conflict with the Office of the Attorney General, which requested access to the black box data. Citing that there was no reason at that time to suspect foul play and that the Board investigation would be hampered by the threat of legal action against persons, Van Vollenhoven absolutely refused this access.

When he turned 70, Barry Sweedler (of the US National Transportation Safety Board) said to him: &quot;The world is a safer place because of your work and leadership&quot;.

==Hobbies==
Van Vollenhoven is an avid pianist. In 1986 he formed a trio – &quot;De Gevleugelde Vrienden&quot; – with two of the country&#x27;s leading pianists (Pim Jacobs and Louis van Dijk) and gave some twenty concerts a year both at home and abroad in aid of the Victim Support Fund. De Gevleugelde Vrienden were awarded four gold discs. After the death of one of the members of the trio, Pim Jacobs, Van Vollenhoven continued to give concerts with pianists Louis van Dijk and Koos Mark.

Van Vollenhoven is still an active pilot and he also dives. He almost lost the tip of his right index finger during a dive in 2005, when he got caught between the boat and the dock steps. Doctors were able to reattach the tip.

He is also a photographer. The Victim Support Fund raised money in 2008 and 2009 by selling calendars with his photographs.

==Health==

Van Vollenhoven was diagnosed with a Melanoma, a common type of skin cancer, in May 2017. He had it removed at the Netherlands Cancer Institute in Amsterdam. In November that same year, he was diagnosed with another Melanoma and had it removed.

==Marriage and family==
Van Vollenhoven married Princess Margriet of the Netherlands at The Hague on 10 January 1967, in the St. James Church. This made him the first member of the Dutch Royal House being a commoner and not of royal or noble origin. He was not given any royal titles as a result of the marriage and is therefore formally addressed as &quot;Mister Van Vollenhoven&quot; or by his professional title as &quot;Professor Van Vollenhoven&quot;.

The couple went to live in Het Loo House, near the Het Loo Palace. They have four sons:
*Prince Maurits of Orange-Nassau, van Vollenhoven (born 17 April 1968), married Marilène van den Broek (born 4 February 1970);
*Prince Bernhard of Orange-Nassau, van Vollenhoven (born 25 December 1969), married Annette Sekrève (born 18 April 1972);
*Prince Pieter-Christiaan of Orange-Nassau, van Vollenhoven (born 22 March 1972), married Anita van Eijk (born 27 October 1969);
*Prince Floris of Orange-Nassau, van Vollenhoven (born 10 April 1975), married Aimée Söhngen (born 19 October 1977).

The German house name Lippe-Biesterfeld is borne by the children of Prince Maurits (making them Van Lippe-Biesterfeld van Vollenhoven); his other (grand)children are just van Vollenhoven.

==Honours and awards==

Van Vollenhoven received numerous honours and awards in the Netherlands but also internationally:

===Honorary citizenship===
On 12 June 2004, he was made an Honorary citizen of the town of Vollenhove.

<text>Trevor George Smith Jr. (born May 20, 1972), known professionally as Busta Rhymes, is an American rapper and actor. Chuck D of Public Enemy gave him the moniker Busta Rhymes, after NFL and CFL wide receiver George &quot;Buster&quot; Rhymes. He has received 12 Grammy Award nominations for his work, making him one of the most-nominated artists without winning.

Busta Rhymes was an original member of Leaders of the New School, a group that attracted national attention when they opened on tour for Public Enemy. He gained exposure for their guest appearance on A Tribe Called Quest&#x27;s track &quot;Scenario&quot;. Shortly thereafter, Leaders of the New School broke up, leading Rhymes to become a sought after solo artist, appearing on numerous tracks for other artists before his debut solo album, &quot;The Coming&quot; (1996). The album reached the top ten on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart, was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and earned him a Grammy nomination.

He has released eleven total solo albums, with the most recent being 2023&#x27;s &quot;Blockbusta&quot;. Rhymes&#x27; list of hit singles include &quot;Woo-Hah!! Got You All in Check&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s a Party&quot;, &quot;Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Could See&quot;, &quot;Dangerous&quot;, &quot;Turn It Up&quot; (Remix)/&quot;Fire It Up&quot;, &quot;Gimme Some More&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;s It Gonna Be?!&quot;, &quot;Pass the Courvoisier, Part II&quot;, &quot;I Know What You Want&quot; and &quot;Touch It&quot;.

Among his other ventures, he founded the record label Conglomerate (initially Flipmode Entertainment) and the production crew The Conglomerate (formerly Flipmode Squad). About.com included him on its list of the 50 Greatest MCs of Our Time (1987–2007), and Steve Huey of AllMusic called him one of the best and most prolific rappers of the 1990s. In 2012, &quot;The Source&quot; placed him on its list of the Top 50 Lyricists of All Time. MTV has called him &quot;one of hip-hop&#x27;s greatest visual artists&quot;.

==Early life==
Trevor George Smith Jr. was born in the East Flatbush neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York City, on May 20, 1972, to Geraldine Green and Trevor Smith Sr., who both were immigrants from Jamaica. At age 12, Smith&#x27;s family moved to Nassau County on Long Island, and settled in Uniondale, New York. For a short while, Smith attended George Westinghouse Career and Technical Education High School in Brooklyn with future rappers Christopher &quot;The Notorious B.I.G.&quot; Wallace and Shawn &quot;Jay-Z&quot; Carter, and attended Samuel J. Tilden High School with Edward &quot;Special Ed&quot; Archer and Roderick &quot;Chip Fu&quot; Roachford of Fu-Schnickens. Smith eventually graduated from Uniondale High School in 1991.

Busta also spent time in England during the early 1980s where he resided with his maternal aunt. She lived in Morecambe, and he spent two summers there with his mother and younger brother. He went to Skerton Community High School while he was staying in the area. He told &quot;GQ&quot; in a 2020 interview, &quot;One summer when we went down there I was 12, my brother was eight, so my aunt made sure that we actually went to school in England. Regular school and then we went to karate school too. We also were on some breakdancing that was so crazy, we ended up actually getting work to breakdance in clubs as minors. And our cousins used to run us around and they used to advertise us as TJ and Paul.&quot;

==Career==
===1986–1995: Leaders of the New School and rising popularity===
In 1986, Smith, alongside fellow Long Island natives Charlie Brown, Cut Monitor Milo, and Dinco D, formed the East Coast hip hop group Leaders of the New School.

Leaders of the New School released their debut album, &quot;A Future Without a Past...,&quot; in June 1991 on Elektra Records. Later that year, the group appeared on A Tribe Called Quest&#x27;s critically acclaimed posse cut &quot;Scenario&quot;. In 1993, they released &quot;T.I.M.E. (The Inner Mind&#x27;s Eye)&quot;. Smith gained popularity from his advanced rhymes as well as his unique style that was not common of many New York rap artists at the time. Soon after, however, internal problems arose because of his increasing popularity, and the group broke up on the set of &quot;Yo! MTV Raps&quot;.

===1996–1999: &quot;The Coming&quot;, &quot;When Disaster Strikes&quot;, and &quot;Extinction Level Event: The Final World Front&quot;===
In 1996, Busta Rhymes released his debut solo album, &quot;The Coming&quot;. His single &quot;Woo Hah!! Got You All in Check&quot; was a success, pushing the album into gold record status. Later, he started work on his second album, &quot;When Disaster Strikes&quot;, which would not be released until September 1997.

In 1998, Busta Rhymes recorded &quot;Extinction Level Event: The Final World Front&quot;.

===2000–2004: &quot;Anarchy&quot;, &quot;Genesis&quot;, and &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Safe No More&quot;===

In 2000, Busta Rhymes released his final album for Elektra, titled &quot;Anarchy&quot;. He released &quot;Genesis&quot; in 2001. The album featured collaborations with Mary J. Blige, P. Diddy, Kelis, and others.

In 2002, Busta Rhymes released his sixth studio album, &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Safe No More&quot;.

===2005–2009: &quot;The Big Bang&quot; and &quot;Back on My B.S.&quot;===

His seventh studio album, titled &quot;The Big Bang&quot;, became the first No. 1 album of his career. The album sold over 209,000 copies in its first week to earn the top spot on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

It was later revealed that Busta signed a deal with Universal Motown, through which he released his eighth studio album, &quot;Back on My B.S.&quot;, on May 19, 2009. Due to controversial content, the United Arab Emirates has banned the album. &quot;Back on My B.S.&quot; was released internationally, but because of one song, &quot;Arab Money&quot;, it cannot be purchased as a CD there, although the album can still be purchased via iTunes. According to the National Media Council, the lyrics were considered to be offensive to Arabs and to Islam because it quoted the Quran.

In November 2008, when &quot;Arab Money&quot; was released as a single, DJ Dany Neville and the Iraqi rapper The Narcicyst responded by recording a reply. Rhymes later apologized. DJs in the country said they had not received an order banning the record from being spun in nightclubs, and they had mixed feelings on whether the record was offensive or not. DJ Saif of Dubai said &quot;I don&#x27;t play &#x27;Arab Money&#x27; because it&#x27;s disrespectful [to] Arabs. I don&#x27;t think there is a ban on playing it in clubs, but many here don&#x27;t play it anyway.&quot;

DJ Bliss, along with many other DJs in the UAE, refused to play &quot;Arab Money&quot; on Radio 1 in Dubai after it was banned in the UAE for offense to Arabs. He added, &quot;I used to play the original version in the club, but out of respect for the laws here in my country, I haven&#x27;t played it since.&quot; In 2010 the track&#x27;s producer Ron Browz defended Busta Rhymes in a Dubai interview with journalist Awad Mustafa stating that the track was misunderstood. &quot;For us, having &#x27;Arab money&#x27; is a compliment understood like having &#x27;Oprah money&#x27; or &#x27;Tiger Woods money&#x27; – it&#x27;s just street slang, and we were appreciating the amazing wonders that have been created here,&quot; Browz said. Browz added that he had produced the track in a moment of inspiration while experimenting in his studio. &quot;Growing up in Harlem I was always surrounded by Arabs and Muslims, we embraced their culture and they embraced ours and we always joked with each other,&quot; he said.

===2010–2020: Collaborations and &quot;Extinction Level Event 2&quot;===
In September 2009, Busta Rhymes had announced that he was working on his ninth studio album, alongside Canadian producer Boi-1da, titled &quot;The Chemo&quot;. At the time, he stated that the project was 80% finished. In May 2010, Busta Rhymes had reportedly changed the title of his ninth album from &quot;The Chemo&quot; to &quot;Extinction Level Event 2&quot;, making his ninth effort a sequel to his 1998 album &quot;Extinction Level Event (Final World Front)&quot;.

Busta Rhymes contributed to the 2011 Tech N9ne album &quot;All 6&#x27;s and 7&#x27;s&quot;, performing vocals on the single, &quot;Worldwide Choppers&quot;, released on May 31. Canadian recording artist Justin Bieber featured Busta Rhymes on a song called &quot;Drummer Boy&quot; off Bieber&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Under the Mistletoe&quot;, released on November 1, 2011. On November 11, 2011, a Heavy D tribute song titled &quot;You Ain&#x27;t Gotta Wait Till I&#x27;m Gone&quot; was leaked.

On November 16, 2011, it was announced that Busta Rhymes signed to Cash Money Records.

A song with Twista, titled &quot;Can You Keep Up&quot;, was leaked. Busta Rhymes was featured on Fat Joe&#x27;s single &quot;Pride &amp; Joy&quot; alongside Kanye West and Jadakiss. His ninth studio album, &quot;Year of the Dragon&quot;, was released for free on Google Play on August 21, 2012. The album features guest appearances from Lil Wayne, Rick Ross, Trey Songz, Robin Thicke, Maino, Gucci Mane and more. He also released a music video for the track &quot;Doin&#x27; It Again&quot; which features Reek da Villian and includes a tribute to his manager Chris Lighty, who committed suicide in 2012.

He was later featured on YMCMB label mate Shannel&#x27;s single &quot;Last Time&quot;. In 2011, it was announced that Universal Motown was going defunct, forcing Rhymes and other artists to move to Universal Republic Records. In mid-2012, it was announced that Universal Republic Records was also going defunct, forcing artists on the roster to move to Republic Records, reviving the label.

On December 21, 2012, members of The Conglomerate Ent., Busta along with J. Doe and Reek da Villan released a mixtape titled &quot;Catastrophic&quot;, their first collective effort. Busta Rhymes collaborated with Pharrell Williams, who produced the first single off his Cash Money Records debut, &quot;Twerk It&quot;, which was released on June 6, 2013. A video was shot in Flatbush on June 3, 2013. The official remix was released featuring Nicki Minaj. On July 23, 2014, Busta Rhymes announced that he left Cash Money Records due to creative differences and he is no longer on Republic.

He was featured on &quot;Devil&quot;, featuring Neon Hitch and B.o.B, a song by Cash Cash. It was released in August 2015. In July 2014, it was announced that Rhymes had amicably departed Cash Money Records due to creative differences.

In 2016, a movement to name a small, uninhabited lake island in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts after Busta Rhymes received viral publicity. The unofficial name of Busta Rhymes Island was chosen by a town resident because the island has &quot;rope-swinging, blueberries, and ... stuff Busta would enjoy&quot;. A formal proposal was made to the U.S. Board on Geographic Names to officially change the island&#x27;s name, but it was not accepted due to regulations regarding the naming of geographic places after living people.

Busta Rhymes was also a featured artist on &quot;The Hamilton Mixtape&quot;, singing a remix of &quot;My Shot&quot;, along with Black Thought of The Roots and Joell Ortiz. The trio performed the song on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot;. On February 2, 2018, Rhymes released a new single &quot;Get It&quot;, featuring Missy Elliott and Kelly Rowland, through Epic Records.

In February 2019, Busta Rhymes confirmed he&#x27;s &quot;finishing touches&quot; of his new album with longtime collaborator, Dr. Dre.

In 2020, Busta Rhymes competed in season 4 of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Dragon&quot;. He was eliminated in the first episode.

On October 30, 2020, Busta released his album &quot;Extinction Level Event 2: The Wrath of God&quot;.

===2021–2024: &quot;Blockbusta&quot; and guest appearances===
In 2021, Busta Rhymes released the 25th Anniversary Edition of his debut studio album, &quot;The Coming&quot;.

In late 2023, his eleventh studio album, &quot;Blockbusta&quot;, which has many guest appearances, was released.

Throughout late 2024, he made two major guest appearances on his idol, LL Cool J&#x27;s &quot;Huey in the Chair&quot;, a track from his fourteenth album, &quot;The FORCE&quot;, the pair&#x27;s first collaboration in nearly 27 years since 1997&#x27;s &quot;Starsky and Hutch&quot;. That November, he appeared on singer Ciara&#x27;s single, &quot;Wassup&quot;.

=== 2025: &quot;Dragon Season&quot; ===
On January 17, 2025, Busta Rhymes released his EP, &quot;Dragon Season... The Awakening&quot;, a precursor to his upcoming studio album, &quot;Dragon Season&quot;.

==Personal life==
Busta Rhymes identifies as a member of the Five-Percent Nation. He has six children: three sons (born in 1993, 1999, and 2001) and three daughters (born 1998, 1999, and 2006).

During an interview for Hip-Hop: Beyond Beats and Rhymes, the rapper walked out when confronted with a question about homophobia in the rap community. Rhymes is quoted as saying: &quot;I can&#x27;t partake in that conversation,&quot; followed by, &quot;With all due respect, I ain&#x27;t trying to offend nobody. . . What I represent culturally doesn&#x27;t condone [homosexuality] whatsoever.&quot; When asked if the hip hop culture would ever accept a homosexual rapper, Busta Rhymes then exited the interview.

In a later interview with MTV News, Rhymes expressed his support for Frank Ocean upon his coming out, as well as general cultural acceptance of homosexuality.

==Legal issues==

In December 1998, Rhymes was arrested and charged with possession of an unregistered gun after being pulled over during a routine traffic stop in New York City. On October 6, 2000, he received five years&#x27; probation after pleading guilty earlier in the year.

On August 20, 2006, Rhymes was arrested and arraigned for charges of third-degree assault after attacking a man who reportedly spat on his car in New York City on August 12 after the AmsterJam Music Festival on Randall&#x27;s Island.

On October 24, 2006, Rhymes appeared at Manhattan Criminal Court as the district attorney&#x27;s office attempted to amend previous charges against him to include weapons possession for a machete found in his car. The judge refused to add the charge and adjourned the case.

On February 20, 2007, Rhymes refused a plea deal offered by the prosecutor&#x27;s office for the assault of his former driver, Edward Hatchett. The deal would have entailed his being in jail for six months and pleading guilty to two assaults, the attack on Hatchett, and the attack on the former fan. The dispute with Hatchett is believed to have originated over back pay Hatchett felt he was owed. Manhattan Criminal Court Judge Becki Rowe offered Busta another option, pleading guilty to third-degree assault. The conditions of the proposed sentence would include five days of community service, two weeks of youth lectures and six months of anger management classes, as well as three years of probation.

On May 3, 2007, Rhymes was arrested in Manhattan for driving without a license and for driving while impaired. On March 18, 2008, a judge in New York City sentenced Rhymes to three years of probation, 10 days community service, $1250 in fines (plus court costs), and to enroll in a drunken driving program.

On September 25, 2008, Rhymes was temporarily refused entry to the UK due to &quot;unresolved convictions&quot;.

In 2018, Busta Rhymes was accused of plagiarism by Bernardo Lanzetti and his group Acqua Fragile, who alleged that Rhymes&#x27; 2001 song &quot;Genesis&quot; used an uncredited sample of the group&#x27;s &quot;Cosmic Mind Affair&quot;. After negotiations with Rhymes&#x27; publishers broke down, Lanzetti and Acqua Fragile opted to move forward with a lawsuit.

On January 10, 2025, Rhymes was involved in assaulting one of his assistants, Dashiel Gables, after an argument due to a food delivery dispute near the corner of Jay and Front streets in Brooklyn&#x27;s Dumbo neighborhood. The victim suffered injuries to his face with visible swelling. Rhymes turned himself in to the police. He was arrested and charged with third degree assault and had given a desk appearance ticket, which requires him to make an appearance in criminal court for an arraignment. The investigation is still ongoing.

==Influences==
Busta Rhymes&#x27; favorite rapper as a teenager was LL Cool J, who was the inspiration and reason for Busta Rhymes writing his first raps.

He was creatively inspired by American singer and record producer George Clinton for &quot;being over the top and outlandish and brave as far as his showmanship.&quot; Rhymes has also stated that he was taught by Clinton about the music industry and numerous challenges people in it have to face.

==Legacy==
Rhymes&#x27; work has influenced artists such as Eminem, Talib Kweli, Ski Mask the Slump God, Kendrick Lamar, Tyler, the Creator, Doja Cat, and Ciara. Fellow American rapper Big Daddy Kane has stated that Rhymes has the best flow in hip hop, alluding to the original version of &quot;Turn It Up&quot;.

<doc id="151452" wikidata="Q852206" url="?curid=151452" title="Burnside problem">
<text>The Burnside problem asks whether a finitely generated group in which every element has finite order must necessarily be a finite group. It was posed by William Burnside in 1902, making it one of the oldest questions in group theory, and was influential in the development of combinatorial group theory. It is known to have a negative answer in general, as Evgeny Golod and Igor Shafarevich provided a counter-example in 1964. The problem has many refinements and variants that differ in the additional conditions imposed on the orders of the group elements (see bounded and restricted below). Some of these variants are still open questions.

== Brief history ==

Initial work pointed towards the affirmative answer. For example, if a group &quot;G&quot; is finitely generated and the order of each element of &quot;G&quot; is a divisor of 4, then &quot;G&quot; is finite. Moreover, A. I. Kostrikin was able to prove in 1958 that among the finite groups with a given number of generators and a given prime exponent, there exists a largest one. This provides a solution for the restricted Burnside problem for the case of prime exponent. (Later, in 1989, Efim Zelmanov was able to solve the restricted Burnside problem for an arbitrary exponent.) Issai Schur had shown in 1911 that any finitely generated periodic group that was a subgroup of the group of invertible &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; complex matrices was finite; he used this theorem to prove the Jordan–Schur theorem.

Nevertheless, the general answer to the Burnside problem turned out to be negative. In 1964, Golod and Shafarevich constructed an infinite group of Burnside type without assuming that all elements have uniformly bounded order. In 1968, Pyotr Novikov and Sergei Adian supplied a negative solution to the bounded exponent problem for all odd exponents larger than 4381 which was later improved to an odd exponent larger than 665 by Adian. In 1982, A. Yu. Ol&#x27;shanskii found some striking counterexamples for sufficiently large odd exponents (greater than 1010), and supplied a considerably simpler proof based on geometric ideas.

The case of even exponents turned out to be much harder to settle. In 1992, S. V. Ivanov announced the negative solution for sufficiently large even exponents divisible by a large power of 2 (detailed proofs were published in 1994 and occupied some 300 pages). Later joint work of Ol&#x27;shanskii and Ivanov established a negative solution to an analogue of the Burnside problem for hyperbolic groups, provided the exponent is sufficiently large. By contrast, when the exponent is small and different from 2, 3, 4 and 6, very little is known.

== General Burnside problem ==
A group &quot;G&quot; is called periodic (or torsion) if every element has finite order; in other words, for each &quot;g&quot; in &quot;G&quot;, there exists some positive integer &quot;n&quot; such that &quot;g&quot;&quot;n&quot; = 1. Clearly, every finite group is periodic. There exist easily defined groups such as the &quot;p&quot;∞-group which are infinite periodic groups; but the latter group cannot be finitely generated.

General Burnside problem. If &quot;G&quot; is a finitely generated, periodic group, then is &quot;G&quot; necessarily finite?

This question was answered in the negative in 1964 by Evgeny Golod and Igor Shafarevich, who gave an example of an infinite &quot;p&quot;-group that is finitely generated (see Golod–Shafarevich theorem). However, the orders of the elements of this group are not &quot;a priori&quot; bounded by a single constant.

== Bounded Burnside problem ==

Part of the difficulty with the general Burnside problem is that the requirements of being finitely generated and periodic give very little information about the possible structure of a group. Therefore, we pose more requirements on &quot;G&quot;. Consider a periodic group &quot;G&quot; with the additional property that there exists a least integer &quot;n&quot; such that for all &quot;g&quot; in &quot;G&quot;, &quot;g&quot;&quot;n&quot; = 1. A group with this property is said to be &quot;periodic with bounded exponent&quot; &quot;n&quot;, or just a &quot;group with exponent&quot; &quot;n&quot;. The Burnside problem for groups with bounded exponent asks:

Burnside problem I. If &quot;G&quot; is a finitely generated group with exponent &quot;n&quot;, is &quot;G&quot; necessarily finite?

It turns out that this problem can be restated as a question about the finiteness of groups in a particular family. The free Burnside group of rank &quot;m&quot; and exponent &quot;n&quot;, denoted B(&quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;), is a group with &quot;m&quot; distinguished generators &quot;x&quot;1, ..., &quot;xm&quot; in which the identity &quot;xn&quot; = 1 holds for all elements &quot;x&quot;, and which is the &quot;largest&quot; group satisfying these requirements. More precisely, the characteristic property of B(&quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;) is that, given any group &quot;G&quot; with &quot;m&quot; generators &quot;g&quot;1, ..., &quot;gm&quot; and of exponent &quot;n&quot;, there is a unique homomorphism from B(&quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;) to &quot;G&quot; that maps the &quot;i&quot;th generator &quot;xi&quot; of B(&quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;) into the &quot;i&quot;th generator &quot;gi&quot; of &quot;G&quot;. In the language of group presentations, the free Burnside group B(&quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;) has &quot;m&quot; generators &quot;x&quot;1, ..., &quot;xm&quot; and the relations &quot;xn&quot; = 1 for each word &quot;x&quot; in &quot;x&quot;1, ..., &quot;xm&quot;, and any group &quot;G&quot; with &quot;m&quot; generators of exponent &quot;n&quot; is obtained from it by imposing additional relations. The existence of the free Burnside group and its uniqueness up to an isomorphism are established by standard techniques of group theory. Thus if &quot;G&quot; is any finitely generated group of exponent &quot;n&quot;, then &quot;G&quot; is a homomorphic image of B(&quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;), where &quot;m&quot; is the number of generators of &quot;G&quot;. The Burnside problem for groups with bounded exponent can now be restated as follows:

Burnside problem II. For which positive integers &quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot; is the free Burnside group B(&quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;) finite?

The full solution to Burnside problem in this form is not known. Burnside considered some easy cases in his original paper:

*B(1, &quot;n&quot;) is the cyclic group of order &quot;n&quot;.
*B(&quot;m&quot;, 2) is the direct product of &quot;m&quot; copies of the cyclic group of order 2 and hence finite.

The following additional results are known (Burnside, Sanov, M. Hall):

*B(&quot;m&quot;, 3), B(&quot;m&quot;, 4), and B(&quot;m&quot;, 6) are finite for all &quot;m&quot;.
The particular case of B(2, 5) remains open.

The breakthrough in solving the Burnside problem was achieved by Pyotr Novikov and Sergei Adian in 1968. Using a complicated combinatorial argument, they demonstrated that for every odd number &quot;n&quot; with &quot;n&quot; &gt; 4381, there exist infinite, finitely generated groups of exponent &quot;n&quot;. Adian later improved the bound on the odd exponent to 665. In 2015, Adian claimed to have obtained a lower bound of 101 for odd &quot;n&quot;; however, the full proof of this lower bound was never completed and never published. The case of even exponent turned out to be considerably more difficult. It was only in 1994 that Sergei Vasilievich Ivanov was able to prove an analogue of Novikov–Adian theorem: for any &quot;m&quot; &gt; 1 and an even &quot;n&quot; ≥ 248, &quot;n&quot; divisible by 29, the group B(&quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;) is infinite; together with the Novikov–Adian theorem, this implies infiniteness for all &quot;m&quot; &gt; 1 and &quot;n&quot; ≥ 248. This was improved in 1996 by I. G. Lysënok to &quot;m&quot; &gt; 1 and &quot;n&quot; ≥ 8000. Novikov–Adian, Ivanov and Lysënok established considerably more precise results on the structure of the free Burnside groups. In the case of the odd exponent, all finite subgroups of the free Burnside groups were shown to be cyclic groups. In the even exponent case, each finite subgroup is contained in a product of two dihedral groups, and there exist non-cyclic finite subgroups. Moreover, the word and conjugacy problems were shown to be effectively solvable in B(&quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;) both for the cases of odd and even exponents &quot;n&quot;.

A famous class of counterexamples to the Burnside problem is formed by finitely generated non-cyclic infinite groups in which every nontrivial proper subgroup is a finite cyclic group, the so-called Tarski Monsters. First examples of such groups were constructed by A. Yu. Ol&#x27;shanskii in 1979 using geometric methods, thus affirmatively solving O. Yu. Schmidt&#x27;s problem. In 1982 Ol&#x27;shanskii was able to strengthen his results to establish existence, for any sufficiently large prime number &quot;p&quot; (one can take &quot;p&quot; &gt; 1075) of a finitely generated infinite group in which every nontrivial proper subgroup is a cyclic group of order &quot;p&quot;. In a paper published in 1996, Ivanov and Ol&#x27;shanskii solved an analogue of the Burnside problem in an arbitrary hyperbolic group for sufficiently large exponents.

== Restricted Burnside problem ==
Formulated in the 1930s, it asks another, related, question:

Restricted Burnside problem. If it is known that a group &quot;G&quot; with &quot;m&quot; generators and exponent &quot;n&quot; is finite, can one conclude that the order of &quot;G&quot; is bounded by some constant depending only on &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot;? Equivalently, are there only finitely many &quot;finite&quot; groups with &quot;m&quot; generators of exponent &quot;n&quot;, up to isomorphism?

This variant of the Burnside problem can also be stated in terms of category theory: an affirmative answer for all &quot;m&quot; is equivalent to saying that the category of finite groups of exponent &quot;n&quot; has all finite limits and colimits. 
It can also be stated more explicitly in terms of certain universal groups with &quot;m&quot; generators and exponent &quot;n&quot;. By basic results of group theory, the intersection of two normal subgroups of finite index in any group is itself a normal subgroup of finite index. Thus, the intersection &quot;M&quot; of all the normal subgroups of the free Burnside group B(&quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;) which have finite index is a normal subgroup of B(&quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;). One can therefore define the free restricted Burnside group B0(&quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;) to be the quotient group B(&quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;)/&quot;M&quot;. Every finite group of exponent &quot;n&quot; with &quot;m&quot; generators is isomorphic to B(&quot;m&quot;,&quot;n&quot;)/&quot;N&quot; where &quot;N&quot; is a normal subgroup of B(&quot;m&quot;,&quot;n&quot;) with finite index. Therefore, by the Third Isomorphism Theorem, every finite group of exponent &quot;n&quot; with &quot;m&quot; generators is isomorphic to B0(&quot;m&quot;,&quot;n&quot;)/(&quot;N&quot;/&quot;M&quot;) — in other words, it is a homomorphic image of B0(&quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;).
The restricted Burnside problem then asks whether B0(&quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;) is a finite group. 
In terms of category theory, B0(&quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;) is the coproduct of &quot;n&quot; cyclic groups of order &quot;m&quot; in the category of finite groups of exponent &quot;n&quot;. 

In the case of the prime exponent &quot;p&quot;, this problem was extensively studied by A. I. Kostrikin during the 1950s, prior to the negative solution of the general Burnside problem. His solution, establishing the finiteness of B0(&quot;m&quot;, &quot;p&quot;), used a relation with deep questions about identities in Lie algebras in finite characteristic. The case of arbitrary exponent has been completely settled in the affirmative by Efim Zelmanov, who was awarded the Fields Medal in 1994 for his work.

<doc id="151453" wikidata="Q472298" url="?curid=151453" title="United States v. The Amistad">
<text>United States v. Schooner Amistad, 40 U.S. (15 Pet.) 518 (1841), was a United States Supreme Court case resulting from the rebellion of Africans on board the Spanish schooner &quot;La Amistad&quot; in 1839. It was an unusual freedom suit that involved international diplomacy as well as United States law. The historian Samuel Eliot Morison described it in 1969 as the most important court case involving slavery before being eclipsed by that of &quot;Dred Scott v. Sandford&quot; in 1857.

&quot;La Amistad&quot; was traveling along the coast of Cuba on her way to a port for re-sale of the slaves. The Africans, Mende people who had been kidnapped in the area of Sierra Leone, in West Africa, illegally sold into slavery and shipped to Cuba, escaped their shackles and took over the ship. They killed the captain and the cook; two other crew members escaped in a lifeboat. The Mende directed the two Spanish navigator survivors to return them to Africa. The crew tricked them by sailing north at night. &quot;La Amistad&quot; was later apprehended near Long Island, New York, by the United States Revenue-Marine (later renamed the United States Revenue Cutter Service and one of the predecessors of the United States Coast Guard) and taken into custody. The widely publicized court cases in the U.S. federal district court and eventually the Supreme Court in Washington, D.C., in 1841, which addressed international issues, helped the abolitionist movement.

In 1840, a federal district court found that the transport of the kidnapped Africans across the Atlantic Ocean on the Portuguese slave ship &quot;Tecora&quot; was in violation of US laws against international slave trade. The captives were ruled to have acted as free men when they fought to escape their kidnapping and illegal confinement. The court ruled the Africans were entitled to take whatever legal measures necessary to secure their freedom, including the use of force. Under international and Southern sectional pressure, U.S. President Martin Van Buren ordered the case appealed to the Supreme Court. It affirmed the lower district court ruling on March 9, 1841, and authorized the release of the Mende, but it overturned the additional order of the lower court to return them to Africa at government expense. Supporters arranged for temporary housing of the Africans in Farmington, Connecticut, as well as funds for travel. In 1842, the 35 who wanted to return to Africa, together with U.S. Christian missionaries, were transported by ship to Sierra Leone.

==Background==
===Rebellion at sea and capture===


On June 27, 1839, &quot;La Amistad&quot; (&quot;Friendship&quot;), a Spanish vessel, departed from the port of Havana, Cuba, for the Province of Puerto Principe, also in Cuba. The masters of &quot;La Amistad&quot; were Captain Ramón Ferrer, José Ruiz, and Pedro Montes, all Spanish nationals. With Ferrer was Antonio, a man enslaved by Ferrer to serve him personally. Ruiz was transporting 49 Africans, who had been entrusted to him by the governor-general of Cuba. Montez held four additional Africans, also entrusted to him by the governor-general. As the voyage normally took only four days, the crew had brought four days&#x27; worth of rations and had not anticipated the strong headwind that slowed the schooner. On July 2, 1839, one of the Africans, Joseph Cinqué, freed himself and the other captives using a file that had been found and kept by a woman who, like them, had been on the &quot;Tecora&quot;, the Portuguese ship that had transported them illegally as slaves from West Africa to Cuba.

The Mende killed the ship&#x27;s cook, Celestino, who had told them that they were to be killed and eaten by their captors. The Mende also killed Captain Ferrer, and the armed struggle resulted as well in the deaths of two Africans. Two sailors escaped in a lifeboat. The Mende spared the lives of the two Spaniards who could navigate the ship, José Ruiz and Pedro Montez, if they returned the ship east across the Atlantic Ocean to Africa. They also spared Antonio, a creole, and used him as an interpreter with Ruiz and Montez.

The crew deceived the Africans and steered &quot;La Amistad&quot; north along the East Coast of the United States, where the ship was sighted repeatedly. They dropped anchor half-a-mile off eastern Long Island, New York, on August 26, 1839, at Culloden Point. Some of the Africans went ashore to procure water and provisions from the hamlet of Montauk. The vessel was discovered by , a revenue cutter of the United States Revenue-Marine (later renamed the United States Revenue Cutter Service and one of the predecessors of the United States Coast Guard) while &quot;Washington&quot; was conducting hydrographic survey work for the United States Coast Survey. Lieutenant Thomas R. Gedney, commanding the cutter, saw some of the Africans on shore and, assisted by his officers and crew, took custody of &quot;La Amistad&quot; and the Africans.

Taking them to the Long Island Sound port of New London, Connecticut, Lieutenant Gedney presented officials with a written claim for his property rights under international admiralty law for salvage of the vessel, the cargo, and the Africans. Gedney allegedly chose to land in Connecticut because slavery was still technically legal there, under the state&#x27;s gradual abolition law, unlike in nearby New York State. He hoped to profit from sale of the Africans. Gedney transferred the captured Africans into the custody of the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, where legal proceedings began.

===Parties===
* Lt. Thomas R. Gedney filed a libel (a lawsuit in admiralty law) for salvage rights to the African captives and cargo on board &quot;La Amistad&quot; as property seized on the high seas.
* Henry Green and Pelatiah Fordham filed a libel for salvage and claimed that they had been the first to discover &quot;La Amistad&quot;.
* José Ruiz and Pedro Montes filed libels requesting their property of &quot;slaves&quot; and cargo to be returned to them.
* The Office of the United States Attorney for the District of Connecticut, representing the Spanish government, libelled for the &quot;slaves,&quot; cargo, and vessel to be returned to Spain as its property.
* Antonio Vega, vice-consul of Spain, libelled for &quot;the slave Antonio&quot; on the grounds that the man was his personal property.
* The Africans denied that they were slaves or property and argued that the court could not &quot;return&quot; them to the control of the government of Spain.
* José Antonio Tellincas, with Aspe and Laca, claimed other goods on board &quot;La Amistad&quot;.

===British pressure===

As the British had entered into a treaty with Spain prohibiting the slave trade north of the equator, they considered it a matter of international law for the United States to release the Africans. The British applied diplomatic pressure to achieve that such as invoking the Treaty of Ghent with the US, which jointly enforced their respective prohibitions against the international slave trade.

While the legal battle continued, Dr. Richard Robert Madden, &quot;who served on behalf of the British commission to suppress the African slave trade in Havana,&quot; arrived to testify. He made a deposition &quot;that some twenty-five thousand slaves were brought into Cuba every year – with the wrongful compliance of, and personal profit by, Spanish officials.&quot; Madden also &quot;told the court that his examinations revealed that the defendants were brought directly from Africa and could not have been residents of Cuba,&quot; as the Spanish had claimed. Madden, who later had an audience with Queen Victoria concerning the case, conferred with the British Minister in Washington, D.C., Henry Stephen Fox, who pressured U.S. Secretary of State John Forsyth on behalf &quot;of her Majesty&#x27;s Government.&quot;

Fox wrote:

Forsyth responded that under the separation of powers in the U.S. Constitution, the President could not influence the court case. He said that the question of whether the &quot;negroes of the Amistad&quot; had been enslaved in violation of the Treaty was still an open one, &quot;and this Government would with great reluctance erect itself into a tribunal to investigate such questions between two friendly sovereigns.&quot; He noted that when the facts were determined, they could be taken into account. He suggested that if the Court found for Spanish rights of property, the Africans would be returned to Cuba. Great Britain and Spain could then argue their questions of law and treaties between them.

===Spanish argument===
Secretary of State Forsyth requested from the Spanish minister, Chevalier de Argaiz, &quot;a copy of the laws now in force in the island of Cuba relative to slavery.&quot; In response, the Captain General of Cuba sent Argaiz &quot;everything on the subject, which had been determined since the treaty concluded in 1818 between Spain and England.&quot; The minister also expressed dismay that the Africans had not already been returned to Spanish control.

The Spanish maintained that none but a Spanish court could have jurisdiction over the case. The minister stated, &quot;I do not, in fact, understand how a foreign court of justice can be considered competent to take cognizance of an offence committed on board of a Spanish vessel, by Spanish subjects, and against Spanish subjects, in the waters of a Spanish territory; for it was committed on the coasts of this island, and under the flag of this nation.&quot; The minister noted that the Spanish had recently turned over American sailors &quot;belonging to the crew of the American vessel &#x27;William Engs,&#x27;&quot; whom it had tried by request of their captain and the American consul. The sailors had been found guilty of mutiny and sentenced to &quot;four years&#x27; confinement in a fortress.&quot; Other American sailors had protested, and when the American ambassador raised the issue with the Spaniards, on March 20, 1839, &quot;her Majesty, having taken into consideration all the circumstances, decided that the said seamen should be placed at the disposition of the American consul, seeing that the offence was committed in one of the vessels and under the flag of his nation, and not on shore.&quot; The Spaniards asked how if America had demanded that the sailors in an American ship be turned over to them despite being in a Spanish port, they could now try the Spanish mutineers.

The Spaniards held that just as America had ended its importation of African slaves but maintained a legal domestic population, so too had Cuba. It was up to Spanish courts to determine &quot;whether the Negroes in question&quot; were legal or illegal slaves under Spanish law, &quot;but never can this right justly belong to a foreign country.&quot;

The Spaniards maintained that even if it was believed that the Africans were being held as slaves in violation of &quot;the celebrated treaty of humanity concluded between Spain and Great Britain in 1835,&quot; it would be a violation of &quot;the laws of Spain; and the Spanish Government, being as scrupulous as any other in maintaining the strict observance of the prohibitions imposed on, or the liberties allowed to, its subjects by itself, will severely chastise those of them who fail in their duties.&quot;

The Spaniards pointed out that by American law, the jurisdiction over a

vessel on the high seas, in time of peace, engaged in a lawful voyage, is, according to the laws of nations, under the exclusive jurisdiction of the State to which her flag belongs; as much so as if constituting a part of its own domain. ...if such ship or vessel should be forced, by stress of weather, or other unavoidable cause, into the port and under the jurisdiction of a friendly Power, she, and her cargo, and persons on board, with their property, and all the rights belonging to their personal relations as established by the laws of the State to which they belong, would be placed under the protection which the laws of nations extend to the unfortunate under such circumstances.

The Spaniards demanded that the U.S. &quot;apply these proper principles to the case of the schooner &quot;Amistad&quot;.&quot;

The Spanish were further encouraged that their view would win by U.S. Senator John C. Calhoun and the Senate&#x27;s Committee of Foreign Relations on April 15, 1840, issuing a statement announcing complete &quot;conformity between the views entertained by the Senate, and the arguments urged by the [Spanish Minister] Chevalier de Argaiz&quot; concerning &quot;La Amistad&quot;.

===Applicable law===
The Spanish categorized the Africans as property to have the case fall under Pinckney&#x27;s Treaty of 1795. They protested when Judge William Jay construed a statement by their Minister as seeming to demand
: &quot;the surrender of the negroes apprehended on board the schooner &quot;Amistad&quot;, as murderers, and not as property; that is to say founding his demand on the law of nations, and not on the treaty of 1795.&quot;

The Spanish pointed out that the statement to which Jay was referring was one of the Spanish minister &quot;speaking of the crime committed by the negroes [slave revolt], and the punishment which they merit.&quot; They went on to point out that the minister had stated that a payment to compensate the owners &quot;would be a slender compensation; for though the property should remain, as it ought to remain, unimpaired, public vengeance would be frustrated.&quot;

Judge Jay took issue with the Spanish minister&#x27;s request for the Africans to be turned over to Spanish authorities, which seemed to imply that they were fugitives instead of misbehaving property, since the 1795 treaty stated that property should be restored directly to the control of its owners. The Spanish denied that it meant that the minister had waived the contention of them being property.

By insisting that the case fell under the treaty, the Spanish were invoking the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which would put the clauses of the treaty above the state laws of Connecticut or New York, where the ship had been taken into custody,
: &quot;no one who respects the laws of the country ought to oppose the execution of the treaty, which is the supreme law of the country.&quot;
However, at that point the case had already risen out of the states&#x27; courts, into federal district court.

The Spanish also sought to avoid talk about the law of nations, as some of their opponents argued that it included a duty by the U.S. to treat the Africans with the same deference as would be accorded any other foreign sailors.

John Quincy Adams would argue that issue before the Supreme Court in 1841,:

: The Africans were in possession, and had the presumptive right of ownership; they were in peace with the United States: ... they were not pirates; they were on a voyage to their native homes ... the ship was theirs, and being in immediate communication with the shore, was in the territory of the State of New York; or, if not, at least half the number were actually on the soil of New York, and entitled to all the provisions of the law of nations, and the protection and comfort which the laws of that State secure to every human being within its limits.

When pressed with questions concerning the law of nations, the Spanish referred to a concept of Hugo Grotius, who is credited as one of the originators of the law of nations. Specifically, they noted that
: &quot;the usage, then, of demanding fugitives from a foreign Government, is confined ... to crimes which affect the Government and such as are of extreme atrocity.&quot;

==Initial court proceedings==

A case before the circuit court in Hartford, Connecticut, was filed in September 1839, charging the Africans with mutiny and murder on &quot;La Amistad&quot;. The court ruled that it lacked jurisdiction, because the alleged acts took place on a Spanish ship in Spanish waters. It was entered into the docket books of the federal court as &quot;United States&quot; v. &quot;Cinque, et al.&quot;

Various parties filed property claims with the district court to many of the African captives, to the ship, and to its cargo: Ruiz and Montez, Lieutenant Gedney, and Captain Henry Green (who had met the Africans while on shore on Long Island and claimed to have helped in their capture). The Spanish government asked that the ship, cargo, and African captives be restored to Spain under the Pinckney treaty of 1795 between Spain and the United States. Article 9 of the treaty held that
: &quot;all ships and merchandises of what nature soever, which shall be rescued out of the hands of pirates or robbers on the high seas, ... shall be restored, entire, to the true proprietor.&quot;
The United States filed a claim on behalf of Spain.
The abolitionist movement had formed the &quot;&quot;Amistad&quot; Committee,&quot; headed by the New York City merchant Lewis Tappan, and had collected money to mount a defense of the Africans. Initially, communication with the Africans was difficult since they spoke neither English nor Spanish. Professor J.W. Gibbs learned from the Africans to count to ten in their Mende language. He went to the docks of New York City and counted aloud in front of sailors until he located a person able to understand and translate. He found James Covey, a twenty-year-old sailor on the British man-of-war . Covey was a formerly enslaved person from West Africa.

The abolitionists filed charges of assault, kidnapping, and false imprisonment against Ruiz and Montes. Their arrest in New York City in October 1839 had outraged pro-slavery advocates and the Spanish government. Montes immediately posted bail and went to Cuba. Ruiz, being
: &quot;more comfortable in a New England setting (and entitled to many amenities not available to the Africans), hoped to garner further public support by staying in jail. ... Ruiz, however, soon tired of his martyred lifestyle in jail and posted bond. Like Montes, he returned to Cuba.&quot;
Outraged, the Spanish minister, Cavallero Pedro Alcántara Argaiz, made
: &quot;caustic accusations against America&#x27;s judicial system and continued to condemn the abolitionist affront. Ruiz&#x27;s imprisonment only added to Alcántara&#x27;s anger, and Alcántara pressured Forsyth to seek ways to throw out the case altogether.&quot;
The Spanish held that the bailbonds that the men had to acquire so that they could leave jail and return to Cuba caused them a grave financial burden, and
: &quot;by the treaty of 1795, no obstacle or impediment [to leave the U.S.] should have [been] placed&quot; [in their way].

On 7 January 1840, all of the parties, with the Spanish minister representing Ruiz and Montes, appeared before the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut and presented their arguments.

The abolitionists&#x27; main argument before the district court was that a treaty between Britain and Spain in 1817 and a subsequent pronouncement by the Spanish government had outlawed the slave trade across the Atlantic. They established that the slaves had been captured in Mendiland (also spelled Mendeland, now Sierra Leone) in Africa, sold to a Portuguese trader in Lomboko (south of Freetown) in April 1839, and taken to Havana illegally on a Portuguese ship. The Africans were victims of illegal kidnapping and so, the abolitionists argued, were not slaves but free to return to Africa. They further argued that the documents for the Africans, provided by the Spanish government of Cuba, falsely identified Africans as slaves who had been in Cuba since before 1820, and hence were considered to have been born there as slaves. They contended that government officials in Cuba criminally condoned the fraudulent classification of the Africans from the &quot;Amistad&quot;.

Concerned about relations with Spain and his re-election prospects in the South, U.S. President Martin Van Buren, a Democrat, sided with the Spanish position. He ordered the schooner USS &quot;Grampus&quot; to New Haven Harbor to return the Africans to Cuba immediately after a favorable decision, before any appeals could be decided.

Contrary to Van Buren&#x27;s plan, the district court, led by judge Andrew T. Judson, ruled in favor of the abolitionists and the Africans&#x27; position. In January 1840, Judson ordered for the Africans to be returned to their homeland by the U.S. government, and for one third of &quot;La Amistad&quot; and its cargo to be given to Lieutenant Gedney as salvage property. (The federal government had outlawed the slave trade between the U.S. and other countries in 1808; an 1818 law, as amended in 1819, provided for the return of all illegally-traded slaves.)

Antonio, the deceased captain&#x27;s personal slave, was declared the rightful property of the captain&#x27;s heirs and was ordered restored to Cuba. Contrary to Sterne&#x27;s 1953 fictional account, that describes Antonio willingly returning to Cuba, Smithsonian sources report that he escaped to New York, or to Canada, with the help of an abolitionist group.

In detail, the District Court ruled as follows:
* It rejected the claim of the U.S. Attorney, who argued on behalf of the Spanish minister for the restoration of the &quot;slaves&quot;.
* It dismissed the claims of Ruiz and Montez.
* It ordered that the captives be delivered to the custody of the U.S. president for transportation to Africa since they were in fact legally free.
* It allowed the Spanish vice-consul to claim the slave Antonio.
* It allowed Lt. Gedney to claim one third of the property on board &quot;La Amistad&quot;.
* It allowed Tellincas, Aspe, and Laca to claim one third of the property.
* It dismissed the claims made by Green and Fordham for salvage rights.

The U.S. Attorney for the District of Connecticut, by order of Van Buren, immediately appealed to the U.S. circuit court for the Connecticut district. He challenged every part of the district court&#x27;s ruling, except the concession of the slave Antonio to the Spanish vice-consul. Tellincas, Aspe, and Laca also appealed to gain a greater portion of the salvage value. Ruiz and Montez and the owners of &quot;La Amistad&quot; did not appeal.

In April 1840 the Circuit Court of Appeals, in turn, upheld the district court&#x27;s decision. The U.S. Attorney appealed the federal government&#x27;s case to the U.S. Supreme Court.

==Arguments before Supreme Court==
On February 23, 1841, U.S. Attorney General Henry D. Gilpin began the oral argument phase before the Supreme Court. Gilpin first entered into evidence the papers of &quot;La Amistad&quot;, which stated that the Africans were Spanish property. Gilpin argued that the Court had no authority to rule against the validity of the documents. Gilpin contended that if the Africans were slaves, as indicated by the documents, they must be returned to their rightful owner, the Spanish government. Gilpin&#x27;s argument lasted two hours.

John Quincy Adams, a former U.S. president who was then a U.S. Representative from Massachusetts, had agreed to argue for the Africans. When it was time for him to argue, he said that he felt ill-prepared. Roger Sherman Baldwin, who had already represented the captives in the lower cases, opened in his place.

Baldwin, a prominent attorney, contended that the Spanish government was trying to manipulate the Supreme Court to return &quot;fugitives.&quot; He argued that the Spanish government sought the return of slaves who had been freed by the district court but was not appealing the fact of their having been freed. Covering all the facts of the case, Baldwin spoke for four hours over the course of February 22 and 23. (He was of no relation to the Court&#x27;s Justice Henry Baldwin.)

Adams rose to speak on February 24. He reminded the Court that it was a part of the judicial branch and not part of the executive. Introducing copies of correspondence between the Spanish government and the U.S. Secretary of State, he criticized President Martin Van Buren for his assumption of unconstitutional powers in the case:

Adams argued that neither Pinckney&#x27;s Treaty nor the Adams–Onís Treaty applied to the case. Article IX of Pinckney&#x27;s Treaty referred only to property and did not apply to people. As to &quot;The Antelope&quot; decision (10 Wheat. 124), which recognized &quot;that possession on board of a vessel was evidence of property,&quot; Adams said that did not apply either since the precedent was established prior to the prohibition of the foreign slave trade by the United States. Adams concluded on March 1 after eight-and-a-half hours of speaking. (the Court had taken a recess following the death of Associate Justice Barbour on February 25).

Attorney General Gilpin concluded oral arguments with a three-hour rebuttal on March 2. The Court retired to consider the case.

==Decision==

Associate Justice Joseph Story delivered the Court&#x27;s decision on March 9. Article IX of Pinckney&#x27;s Treaty was ruled inapplicable, since the Africans in question had never been legal property. They were not criminals, as the U.S. Attorney&#x27;s Office argued, but rather
: &quot;unlawfully kidnapped, and forcibly and wrongfully carried on board a certain vessel.&quot;
The documents submitted by Attorney General Gilpin were evidence not of property but rather of fraud on the part of the Spanish government. Lt. Gedney and the USS &quot;Washington&quot; were to be awarded salvage from the vessel for having performed &quot;a highly meritorious and useful service to the proprietors of the ship and cargo.&quot; When &quot;La Amistad&quot; anchored near Long Island, however, the Court believed it to be in the possession of the Africans on board, who had never intended to become slaves. Therefore, the Adams-Onís Treaty did not apply and so the President was not required by that law to cover the expense of returning the Africans to Africa.
In his judgment, Story wrote:
==Aftermath and significance==
The Africans greeted the news of the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision with joy. Abolitionist supporters took the survivors – 36 men and boys and three girls – to Farmington, a village considered &quot;Grand Central Station&quot; on the Underground Railroad. Its residents had agreed to have the Africans stay there until they could return to their homeland. Some households took them in; supporters also provided barracks for them.

The Amistad Committee instructed the Africans in English and Christianity, and raised funds to pay for their return home. One missionary was James Steele, an Oberlin graduate, previously one of the Lane Rebels. &quot;In 1841 he joined the Amistad Mission to Mendhi, which returned freed slaves to Africa and worked to establish a mission there. However, Steele soon found that the Amistad captives belonged to seven different tribes, some at war with one another. All of the chiefs were slave traders and authorized to re-enslave freed persons. These findings led to the decision that the mission must start in Sierra Leone, under the protection of the British.

Along with several missionaries, in 1842 the surviving 35 Africans returned to Sierra Leone, the other having died at sea or while awaiting trial. The Americans constructed a mission in Mendiland. Former members of the Amistad Committee later founded the American Missionary Association, an integrated evangelical organization that continued to support both the Mendi mission and the abolitionist movement.

In the following years, the Spanish government continued to press the US for compensation for the ship, cargo, and slaves. Several Southern lawmakers introduced resolutions into the United States Congress to appropriate money for such payment but failed to gain passage, although it was supported by presidents James K. Polk and James Buchanan.

Joseph Cinqué returned to Africa. In his final years, he was reported to have returned to the mission and re-embraced Christianity. Recent historical research suggests that the allegations of Cinqué&#x27;s later involvement in the slave trade are false.

In the &quot;Creole&quot; case of 1841, the United States dealt with another ship rebellion similar to that of &quot;La Amistad.&quot;

The US had prohibited the international slave trade in 1808, but ended domestic slavery only in 1865 with the Thirteenth Amendment. Connecticut had a gradual abolition law passed in 1797; children born to slaves were free but had to serve apprenticeships until young adulthood; the last slaves were freed in 1848.

===In popular culture===
In 1998 a memorial was installed at the Montauk Point Lighthouse to commemorate the Amistad. On August 26, 2023, the Montauk Historical Society, together with the Eastville Community Historical Society and the Southampton African-American Museum, erected a historic marker near Culloden Point in Montauk where the Amistad was anchored in 1839. 
The revolt aboard &quot;La Amistad,&quot; the background of the slave trade and its subsequent trial is retold in a celebrated poem by Robert Hayden entitled &quot;Middle Passage&quot;, first published in 1962. Howard Jones published &quot;Mutiny on the Amistad: The Saga of a Slave Revolt and Its Impact on American Abolition, Law, and Diplomacy&quot; in 1987.

A movie, &quot;Amistad&quot; (1997), was based on the events of the revolt and court cases, and Howard Jones&#x27; 1987 book &quot;Mutiny on the Amistad&quot;.

African-American artist Hale Woodruff painted murals portraying events related to the revolt on &quot;La Amistad&quot; in 1938, for Talladega College in Alabama. A statue of Cinqué was erected beside the City Hall building in New Haven, Connecticut in 1992. There is an &quot;Amistad&quot; memorial at Montauk Point State Park on Long Island.

In 2000, &quot;Freedom Schooner Amistad&quot;, a ship replica, was launched in Mystic, Connecticut. The Historical Society of Farmington, Connecticut offers walking tours of village houses that housed the Africans while funds were collected for their return home. The Amistad Research Center at Tulane University in New Orleans, Louisiana, has numerous resources for research into slavery, abolition, and African Americans.

<doc id="151454" wikidata="Q151312" url="?curid=151454" title="Frederik IX">
<text>Frederik IX (Christian Frederik Franz Michael Carl Valdemar Georg; 11 March 1899 – 14 January 1972) was King of Denmark from 1947 to 1972.

Frederik was born into the House of Glücksburg during the reign of his great-grandfather King Christian IX. He was the first child of Prince Christian of Denmark and Princess Alexandrine of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (later King Christian X and Queen Alexandrine). He became crown prince when his father succeeded as king in 1912. As a young man, he was educated at the Royal Danish Naval Academy. In 1935, he married Princess Ingrid of Sweden. They had three daughters: Margrethe, Benedikte and Anne-Marie. During Nazi Germany&#x27;s occupation of Denmark, Frederik acted as regent on behalf of his father from 1942 until 1943.

Frederik became king on his father&#x27;s death in April 1947. During Frederik&#x27;s reign, Danish society changed rapidly, the welfare state was expanded and, as a consequence of the booming economy of the 1960s, women entered the labour market. The modernization brought new demands on the monarchy and Frederik&#x27;s role as a constitutional monarch. Frederik died in 1972, and was succeeded by his eldest daughter, Margrethe II.

==Birth and family==
Prince Frederik was born on 11 March 1899 at his parents&#x27; country residence, the Sorgenfri Palace, located on the shores of the small river Mølleåen in Kongens Lyngby north of Copenhagen on the island of Zealand in Denmark, during the reign of his great-grandfather King Christian IX. His father was Prince Christian of Denmark (later King Christian X), the eldest son of Crown Prince Frederik and Princess Louise of Sweden (later King Frederik VIII and Queen Louise). His mother was Alexandrine of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, the eldest daughter of Frederick Francis III, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Grand Duchess Anastasia Mikhailovna of Russia.

He was baptised in the &quot;Garden Room&quot; at Sorgenfri Palace on 9 April 1899 by the royal confessor Jakob Paulli. The young prince had 21 godparents: Christian IX of Denmark (his paternal great-grandfather); Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark (his paternal grandfather); the Dowager Grand Duchess Anastasia of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (his maternal grandmother); Grand Duke Michael Nikolaevich of Russia (his maternal great-grandfather); Dowager Grand Duchess Marie of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (his maternal step-great-grandmother); Prince Carl of Denmark (his paternal uncle); Princess Thyra of Denmark (his paternal aunt); Frederick Francis IV, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (his maternal uncle); George I of Greece (his paternal great-uncle); Albert Edward, Prince of Wales (his paternal great-uncle by marriage); Ernest August, Duke of Cumberland (his paternal great-uncle by marriage); Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich of Russia (his maternal great-uncle); his first cousins once removed, Nicholas II of Russia, George, Duke of York, Prince George of Greece and Denmark and Georg Wilhelm, Hereditary Prince of Hanover; Crown Prince Constantine and Crown Princess Sophia of Greece (his first cousin once removed, and his wife); his paternal great-granduncles, Prince Johann of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg and King Oscar II of Sweden and Norway; and Crown Prince Gustaf and Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden (his first cousin twice removed and his wife).

Frederik&#x27;s only sibling, Knud, was born one year after Frederik. The family lived in apartments in Christian VIII&#x27;s Palace at Amalienborg Palace in Copenhagen, in Sorgenfri Palace near the capital and in a summer residence, Marselisborg Palace in Aarhus in Jutland, which Frederik&#x27;s parents had received as a wedding present from the people of Denmark in 1898. In 1914, the King also built the villa Klitgården in Skagen in Northern Jutland.

==Early life==
Christian IX died on 29 January 1906, and Frederik&#x27;s grandfather Crown Prince Frederik succeeded him as King Frederik VIII. Frederik&#x27;s father became crown prince, and Frederik moved up to second in line to the throne.

Just six years later, on 14 May 1912, King Frederik VIII died, and Frederik&#x27;s father ascended the throne as King Christian X. Frederik himself became crown prince. On 1 December 1918, as the Danish–Icelandic Act of Union recognized Iceland as a fully sovereign state in personal union with Denmark through a common monarch, Frederik also became crown prince of Iceland (where his name was officially spelled Friðrik). However, as a national referendum established the Republic of Iceland on 17 June 1944, he never succeeded as king of Iceland.

Frederik was educated at the Royal Danish Naval Academy (breaking with Danish royal tradition by choosing a naval instead of an army career) and the University of Copenhagen. Before he became king, he had acquired the rank of rear admiral and he had had several senior commands on active service. He acquired several tattoos during his naval service including dragons, birds, and other traditional tattoo motifs that were popular among sailors of the time.

In addition, with his great love of music, Frederik was an able piano player and conductor.

==Marriage and issue==

In the 1910s, Alexandrine considered the two youngest daughters of her cousin Tsar Nicholas II, Grand Duchesses Maria and Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia, as possible wives for Frederik until the execution of the Romanov family in 1918. In 1922, Frederik was engaged to Princess Olga of Greece and Denmark, his double second cousin, through King Christian IX of Denmark and the other through Frederick Francis II. They never wed.

Instead, on 15 March 1935, a few days after his 36th birthday, his engagement to Princess Ingrid of Sweden (1910–2000), a daughter of Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf (later King Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden) and his first wife, Princess Margaret of Connaught, was announced. They had gotten engaged in private in the beginning of February. Frederik and Ingrid were related in several ways. In descent from Oscar I of Sweden and Leopold, Grand Duke of Baden, they were double third cousins. In descent from Paul I of Russia, Frederik was a fourth cousin of Ingrid&#x27;s mother. They married in Stockholm Cathedral on 24 May 1935. Their wedding was one of the greatest media events of the day in Sweden in 1935, and among the wedding guests were the King and Queen of Denmark, the King and Queen of Belgium and the Crown Prince and Crown Princess of Norway.

Upon their return to Denmark, the couple were given Frederik VIII&#x27;s Palace at Amalienborg Palace in Copenhagen as their primary residence and Gråsten Palace in Northern Schleswig as a summer residence.

Their daughters are:
* Queen Margrethe II of Denmark, born 16 April 1940, married to Count Henri de Laborde of Monpezat and has two sons
* Princess Benedikte of Denmark, born 29 April 1944, married to Richard, 6th Prince of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg and has three children
* Princess Anne-Marie of Denmark, born 30 August 1946, married to King Constantine II of Greece and has five children

==Reign==

From 1942 until 1943, Frederik acted as regent on behalf of his father who was temporarily incapacitated after a fall from his horse in October 1942.

On 20 April 1947, Christian X died, and Frederik succeeded to the throne. He was proclaimed king from the balcony of Christiansborg Palace by Prime Minister Knud Kristensen.

Frederik IX&#x27;s reign saw great change. During these years, Danish society shook off the restrictions of an agricultural society, developed a welfare state, and, as a consequence of the booming economy of the 1960s, women entered the labour market. In other words, Denmark became a modern country, which meant new demands on the monarchy.

In 1948, one year into the king&#x27;s reign, the Faroe Islands obtained home rule and became a self-governing country within the Danish Realm.

===Changes to the Act of Succession===

As King Frederik IX and Queen Ingrid had no sons, it was expected that the king&#x27;s younger brother, Prince Knud, would inherit the throne, in accordance with Denmark&#x27;s succession law (Royal Ordinance of 1853).

However, in 1953, an Act of Succession was passed, changing the method of succession to male-preference primogeniture (which allows daughters to succeed if there are no sons). This meant that his daughters could succeed him if he had no sons. As a consequence, his eldest daughter, Margrethe, became heir presumptive. By order of 27 March 1953 the succession to the throne was limited to the issue of King Christian X.

==Death and funeral==

Shortly after the King had delivered his New Year&#x27;s address on 31 December 1971, he became ill with flu-like symptoms. On 1 January 1972, he received treatment for pneumonia, with his New Year levées scheduled for 5 and 6 January being cancelled. On 3 January, he suffered cardiac arrest and was rushed to the Copenhagen Municipal Hospital. After a brief period of apparent improvement, the King&#x27;s condition took a negative turn on 11 January, and he died three days later, on 14 January, at 7:50 pm surrounded by his immediate family and closest friends, having been unconscious since the previous day. He was succeeded by his eldest daughter, Margrethe II.

Following his death, the King&#x27;s coffin was transported to his home at Amalienborg Palace, where it stood until 18 January, when it was moved to the chapel at Christiansborg Palace. There the King was placed on &quot;castrum doloris&quot;, a ceremony largely unchanged since introduced at the burial of Frederik III in 1670, and the last remaining royal ceremony where the Danish Crown Regalia is used. The King then lay in state for six days until his funeral, during which period the public could pay their last respects.

The funeral took place on 24 January 1972, and was split in two parts. First a brief ceremony was held in the chapel where the king had lain in state, where the Bishop of Copenhagen, Willy Westergaard Madsen, said a brief prayer, followed by a hymn, before the coffin was carried out of the chapel by members of the Royal Life Guards and placed on a gun carriage for the journey through Copenhagen to Copenhagen Central Station. The gun carriage was pulled by 48 seamen and was escorted by honor guards from the Danish Army, Air Force, and Navy, as well as honor guards from France, Sweden, United Kingdom, and the United States.

At the Copenhagen Central Station, the coffin was placed in a special railway carriage for the rail journey to Roskilde. The funeral train was pulled by two DSB class E steam engines. Once in Roskilde, the coffin was pulled through the city by a group of seamen to Roskilde Cathedral where the final ceremony took place. Previous rulers had been interred in the cathedral, but it was the King&#x27;s wish to be buried outside.

Queen Ingrid survived her husband by 28 years. She died on 7 November 2000. Her remains were interred alongside him at the burial site outside Roskilde Cathedral.

==Legacy==
On 20 April 1982, a statue of King Frederik IX dressed in the uniform of an admiral was unveiled by the Copenhagen harbour on the 35th anniversary of his accession to the throne in 1947 and in the tenth year after his death.

The Crown Prince Frederik Range in Greenland was named after him when it was first mapped by Sir Martin Lindsay in 1934 during the British Trans-Greenland Expedition.
==Folktale==
In the southern city, Sønderborg, King Frederik IX has a dish named after the king himself. The dish is called &quot;Kong Fiddes livret&quot; (English: King Frederik&#x27;s Favorite). The name &quot;Fidde&quot; is a common diminutive nickname for people named Frederik in the southern parts of Denmark. The dish is supposedly one that was regularly served to King Frederik IX&#x27;s on his birthday at Gråsten Palace. The dish consist of strips of flank steak, stirred in a creamy paprika and curry sauce, served with French fries, boiled potatoes, beetroot, boiled eggs and freshly sliced onions.

<text>Sir Terence Hardy Waite (born 31 May 1939) is an English human rights activist and author.

Waite was the Assistant for Anglican Communion Affairs for the then Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Runcie, in the 1980s. As an envoy for the Church of England, he travelled to Lebanon to try to secure the release of four hostages, including the journalist John McCarthy. He was himself kidnapped and held captive from 1987 to 1991.

After his release he wrote &quot;Taken on Trust&quot; (1994), a memoir about his experiences, and became involved in humanitarian causes and charitable work.

== Early life and career==
The son of a village policeman in Styal, Cheshire, Waite was educated at Stockton Heath County Secondary School where he became head boy. Although his parents were only nominally religious, he showed a commitment to Christianity from an early age and later became a Quaker and an Anglican.

Waite joined the Grenadier Guards at Caterham Barracks, but an allergy to a dye in the uniform obliged him to depart after a few months. He then considered a monastic life, but instead joined the Church Army, a social welfare organisation of the Anglican Church modelled on the Salvation Army, undergoing training and studies in London. While he was held captive in the 1980s, many Church Army officers wore a simple badge with the letter &quot;H&quot; on it to remind people that one of their members was still a hostage and was being supported in prayer daily by them and many others.

In 1963, Waite was appointed education adviser to the Anglican Bishop of Bristol, Oliver Tomkins, and assisted with Tomkins&#x27;s implementation of the SALT (Stewardship and Laity Training) programme in the diocese, along with Basil Moss. This position required Waite to master psychological T-group methods, with the aim of promoting increased active involvement from the laity. During this time he married Helen Frances Watters. As a student, Waite was greatly influenced by the teachings of Ralph Baldry.

In 1969, he moved to Uganda where he worked as Provincial Training Adviser to Erica Sabiti, the first African Anglican Archbishop of Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi and, in that capacity, travelled extensively throughout East Africa. Together with his wife and their four children, Waite witnessed the Idi Amin coup in Uganda and he and his wife narrowly escaped death on several occasions. From his office in Kampala, Waite founded the Southern Sudan Project and was responsible for developing aid and development programmes for the region.

His next post was in Rome where, from 1972, he worked as an international consultant to the Medical Mission Sisters, a Roman Catholic order seeking to adapt to the leadership reforms of Vatican II. From this base, he travelled extensively throughout Asia, Africa, the Americas and Europe, conducting and advising on programmes concerned with institutional change and development, inter-cultural relations, group and inter-group dynamics and a broad range of development issues connected with health and education.

== Archbishop&#x27;s special envoy ==
Waite returned to the United Kingdom in 1978, where he took a job with the British Council of Churches. In 1980, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Runcie, appointed him the Archbishop of Canterbury&#x27;s Assistant for Anglican Communion Affairs on the recommendation of Tomkins and Bishop John Howe. Based at Lambeth Palace, Waite again travelled extensively throughout the world and had a responsibility for the Archbishop&#x27;s diplomatic and ecclesiastical exchanges. He arranged and travelled with the Archbishop on the first ever visit of an Archbishop of Canterbury to China and had responsibility for travels to Australia, New Zealand, Burma, the United States, Canada, the Caribbean and South Africa.

=== Hostage negotiator ===
In 1980, Waite successfully negotiated the release of several hostages in Iran: Iraj Mottahedeh (Anglican priest in Esfahan), Dimitri Bellos (diocesan officer), Nosrat Sharifian (Anglican priest in Kerman), Fazeli (church member), Jean Waddell (who was secretary to the Iranian Anglican bishop Hassan Dehqani-Tafti), Canon John Coleman and Coleman&#x27;s wife. On 10 November 1984, he negotiated with Muammar Gaddafi for the release of the four remaining British hostages held in the Libyan Hostage Situation, Michael Berdinner, Alan Russell, Malcolm Anderson and Robin Plummer and was again successful.

From 1985, Waite became involved in hostage negotiation in Lebanon and assisted in negotiations which secured the release of Lawrence Jenco and David Jacobsen. American officials secretly facilitated the sale of arms to the Khomeini government of Iran with a view to obtaining Iranian help in the release of hostages held in Lebanon. Waite&#x27;s use of an American helicopter to travel secretly between Cyprus and Lebanon and his appearance with Lt Colonel Oliver North, meant that he was compromised when the Irangate scandal broke in 1986. Against advice, Waite felt a need to demonstrate his continuing trust and integrity, and his commitment to the remaining hostages.

=== Captivity and release ===
Waite arrived in Beirut on 12 January 1987 with the intention of negotiating with the Islamic Jihad Organization, which was holding hostages, including Terry A. Anderson and Thomas Sutherland. On 20 January, he agreed to meet the captors of the hostages as he was promised safe conduct to visit the hostages, who, he was told, were ill. The group broke trust and took him hostage. Waite remained in captivity for 1,763 days, the first four years of which were spent in solitary confinement. He was released on 18 November 1991.

== Release and afterwards ==
Following his release, he was elected a fellow commoner at Trinity Hall, Cambridge where he wrote his first book, &quot;Taken on Trust&quot; (1994), a memoir of his captivity in Lebanon. It became a best-seller in the UK and internationally.

Waite decided to devote himself to studying, writing, lecturing and humanitarian activities. His second book, &quot;Footfalls in Memory&quot;, a further meditation on his captivity in Lebanon, was published in the UK in 1995 and also became a best-seller. His most recent book, published in October 2000, &quot;Travels with a Primate&quot;, is a humorous account of his journeys with his former boss, Robert Runcie. Waite has also contributed articles to many journals and periodicals, ranging from &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; to the &quot;Kipling Journal&quot;, and has also supplied articles and forewords to many books. 

In 2004, Waite returned to Beirut for the first time since his release. He told the BBC, &quot;If you are bitter, it will eat you up and do more damage to you than to the people who have hurt you.&quot;

On 31 March 2007, Waite offered to travel to Iran to negotiate with those holding British sailors and marines seized by Iran in disputed waters on 23 March 2007.

Waite travelled again to Beirut in December 2012 to reconcile with his captors and lay to rest what he described as the ghosts of the past.

==Charity work==
In January 1996, Waite became patron of the Warrington Male Voice Choir in recognition of the humanitarian role adopted by the choir following the Warrington bomb attacks. Since then, he has appeared with the choir for performances in prisons in UK and Ireland to assist in rehabilitation programmes. Prison concerts have become a regular feature of the choir&#x27;s Christmas activities.

Waite is co-founder and president of the charity Y Care International (YMCA&#x27;s international development and relief agency) and in 2004, he founded Hostage UK, an organisation designed to give support to hostage families. Waite became president of Emmaus UK, a charity for formerly homeless people, shortly after his release from captivity in 1991. 

He is patron of several organisations including Storybook Dads, a UK charity which allows prisoners to send recordings of themselves reading bedtime stories to their own children, to help stay connected to some of the 200,000 children affected by parental imprisonment each year. He is a patron of Habitat for Humanity Great Britain, the Romany Society and Strode Park Foundation in Kent.

==Honours and awards==
In 1991, following his release Waite was elected a fellow commoner at Trinity Hall, Cambridge. In 1992, Waite received the Four Freedoms Award for the Freedom of Worship. In the same year, Durham University made him an honorary Doctor of Civil Law. In 2001, Anglia Ruskin University awarded him an honorary Doctor of Philosophy. On 30 May 2009, at a ceremony in Ely Cathedral, the Open University made him an honorary D.Univ. He was awarded an honorary degree by the University of Chester in 2009.

In 2006 he was elected a visiting fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford.

Waite was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in the 2023 Birthday Honours for services to charity and humanitarian work.

<doc id="151459" wikidata="Q817052" url="?curid=151459" title="Princess Benedikte of Denmark">
<text>Princess Benedikte of Denmark, Princess of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg (Benedikte Astrid Ingeborg Ingrid, born 29 April 1944) is a member of the Danish royal family. She is the second daughter and child of King Frederik IX and Queen Ingrid of Denmark. She is the younger sister of Queen Margrethe II of Denmark, and therefore the aunt of Margrethe&#x27;s son, the current King of Denmark, Frederik X. She is also an older sister of Queen Anne-Marie of Greece.

Princess Benedikte often represents the Danish monarch at official or semi-official events. She and her late husband, Richard, 6th Prince of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg, had three children. Princess Benedikte is currently tenth and last in the line of succession to the Danish throne.

==Early life==
===Birth and family===

Princess Benedikte was born on 29 April 1944 at Frederik VIII&#x27;s Palace, her parents&#x27; residence at the Amalienborg palace complex, the principal residence of the Danish royal family in the district of Frederiksstaden in central Copenhagen. She was the second child and daughter of Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Ingrid of Denmark. Her father was the eldest son of King Christian X and Queen Alexandrine of Denmark, and her mother was the only daughter of Crown Prince Gustav Adolf of Sweden and his first wife, Princess Margaret of Connaught.

Her birth took place during Nazi Germany&#x27;s Occupation of Denmark. The day after the birth of the princess, members of the Danish resistance group Holger Danske performed a salute of 21 bombs in the Ørstedsparken public park in central Copenhagen as a reference to the traditional 21-gun salute performed by the Danish Army and Navy at the occasion of royal births.

She was baptised on 24 May 1944, her parents&#x27; 9th wedding anniversary, in the Holmen Church in Copenhagen. Her godparents were King Christian X and Queen Alexandrine of Denmark (her paternal grandparents); Prince Gustav of Denmark (paternal grand-uncle); King Gustaf V of Sweden (maternal great-grandfather), Sigvard Bernadotte (maternal uncle); Princess Caroline-Mathilde of Denmark (paternal aunt by marriage); Princess Ingeborg of Denmark (paternal grand-aunt); Princess Margaretha of Sweden (her father&#x27;s first cousin); Sir Alexander Ramsay (maternal grand-uncle by marriage) and Queen Elizabeth of the United Kingdom.

Princess Benedikte has one elder sister, Margrethe, former Queen of Denmark, and a younger sister, Anne Marie, who was born in 1946 and married Constantine II of Greece.

===Childhood and education===

Princess Benedikte and her sisters grew up in apartments at Frederik VIII&#x27;s Palace at Amalienborg in Copenhagen and in Fredensborg Palace in North Zealand. She spent the summer holidays with the royal family at her parents&#x27; summer residence at Gråsten Palace in Southern Jutland. On 20 April 1947, King Christian X died and Benedikte&#x27;s father ascended the throne as King Frederik IX.

At the time of her father&#x27;s accession to the throne, only males could ascend the throne of Denmark. As her parents had no sons, it was assumed that her uncle Prince Knud would one day assume the throne. The popularity of Frederik IX and his daughters and the more prominent role of women in Danish life paved the way for a new Act of Succession in 1953 which permitted female succession to the throne following the principle of male-preference primogeniture, where a female can ascend to the throne if she has no brothers. Benedikte&#x27;s elder sister Margrethe therefore became heir presumptive, and Princess Benedikte and Princess Anne-Marie became second and third in the line of succession.

Princess Benedikte was educated at N. Zahle&#x27;s School, a private school in Copenhagen, followed by stays at a boarding school (Benenden School) in England and a Swiss finishing school. In 1965 she took a class at the Margrethe-Skolen, a private fashion and design school in Copenhagen.

==Marriage==
Benedikte was married on 3 February 1968 at Fredensborg Palace Church to Richard, 6th Prince of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg (1934–2017). They had three children:

::*Prince Gustav (born 12 January 1969).

::*Princess Alexandra (born 20 November 1970).

::*Princess Nathalie (born 2 May 1975).

The King had decreed that Princess Benedikte&#x27;s children would need to be raised in Denmark in order to have succession rights. Since the condition was not met, Princess Benedikte&#x27;s three children are not in line to succeed to the throne. The children of Princess Benedikte are styled as Highnesses by a Danish Order in Council.

==Interests==
Princess Benedikte is very much involved in the Girl Guide and Girl Scout organization in Denmark as well as internationally. When she was a child, a special Scout unit was created so that she could join the Guides. Now her involvement is more at the organisational level as she is chairman for Pigespejdernes Fællesråd Danmark (&quot;Joint Committee of Girl Guides in Denmark&quot;). She is patron of De grønne pigespejdere (&quot;The Green Girl Guides, Denmark&quot;) and Det Danske Spejderkorps (The Danish Guide and Scout Association). In addition, she is patron of the Olave Baden Powell Society (OB-PS), a support organisation for the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts. She is an honorary member of the St George&#x27;s Guilds in Denmark. In 2007 she was awarded with a prize of honour by this Scout association for adults.

She is also involved in equestrian sport, and has acted as an honorary patron of the World Breeding Federation for Sport Horses. In 2006, she ran in an election for president of the International Equestrian Federation, but she was heavily defeated, earning only 16 votes and placing last out of the three candidates.

<text>Austin Powers in Goldmember is a 2002 American spy comedy film directed by Jay Roach. It is the third installment in the &quot;Austin Powers&quot; film series and stars Mike Myers in four different roles: Austin Powers, Dr. Evil, Goldmember, and Fat Bastard. Myers and Michael McCullers co-wrote the screenplay, which also features Beyoncé Knowles in her theatrical film debut, as well as Seth Green, Michael York, Robert Wagner, Mindy Sterling, Verne Troyer, and Michael Caine.

&quot;Goldmember&quot; opens with a self-parody of the &quot;Austin Powers&quot; film series called &quot;Austinpussy&quot;, where Austin Powers is featured in a bio-pic parody of the James Bond film &quot;Octopussy&quot;. The self-parody is directed by Steven Spielberg and stars Tom Cruise as Austin Powers, Gwyneth Paltrow as Dixie Normous, Kevin Spacey as Dr. Evil, Danny DeVito as Mini-Me, and John Travolta as Goldmember.

The film was distributed by New Line Cinema and released in the United States on July 22, 2002. &quot;Goldmember&quot; finished its box office run with an international haul of $296.6 million and received positive critical reception. It was the seventh-highest-grossing film of the year domestically in the United States. A fourth film in the series has been considered since &quot;Goldmember&quot;″s release, but has yet to enter production as of 2025.

==Plot==

In 2002, from his lair behind the Hollywood Sign, Dr. Evil unveils to Number 2, Mini-Me, Frau Farbissina, and Scott Evil, his plan for world domination: traveling back in time to 1975 and partnering with the Dutch, gold-obsessed Johann van der Smut, who, after losing his genitalia in a smelting accident, is known by the alias &quot;Goldmember&quot;. Goldmember developed a power unit for a tractor beam and intends to use it to pull a meteor into the earth. Moments after unveiling this plan, Austin Powers arrests Dr. Evil and Mini-Me. The Queen of England knights Austin for his service, but he is disappointed when his father, the famous spy Nigel Powers, does not attend the event. During an after party, Basil Exposition informs Austin that Nigel has been kidnapped. Their only clue is that the crew of Nigel&#x27;s yacht have had their genitalia painted gold.

Austin seeks the imprisoned Dr. Evil&#x27;s help to find the culprit. Dr. Evil antagonizes Austin by reminding him that Nigel was also absent when Austin was given the title of &quot;International Man of Mystery&quot; during their British Intelligence academy graduation, an event that angered Dr. Evil as he had the top grades in the class. Dr. Evil eventually reveals that Goldmember is behind the abduction, so Austin time travels to 1975 and infiltrates Goldmember&#x27;s roller disco club in New York City. He is reunited with his former lover, undercover FBI agent Foxxy Cleopatra. Austin locates his father but is unable to rescue him. Goldmember takes Nigel through Dr. Evil&#x27;s time machine to 2002. Dr. Evil and Mini-Me instigate a prison riot and escape. Number 3, a British Intelligence mole, informs Austin that Dr. Evil has moved to a new lair near Tokyo.

Austin and Foxxy travel to Tokyo and confront Fat Bastard, who is now a sumo wrestler. Fat Bastard reveals that businessman Mr. Roboto is working on a device for Dr. Evil and Goldmember. Austin and Foxxy meet with Roboto, who pleads ignorance. The duo infiltrate Roboto&#x27;s factory where the command unit for the tractor beam is being loaded in Goldmember&#x27;s car, and Roboto gives Goldmember a key needed to activate the beam. Foxxy confronts Goldmember while Austin attempts to free Nigel. However, Goldmember escapes and flees to Dr. Evil&#x27;s submarine. Scott Evil kills Roboto by feeding him to sharks. Dr. Evil replaces Mini-Me with Scott as his favored son and the rejected clone defects, joining Austin and Foxxy.

The three infiltrate the submarine, where Austin is captured. Before Dr. Evil can activate the tractor beam, Foxxy steals the key and frees Austin. Austin prepares to shoot Dr. Evil, when Nigel appears and reveals that Austin and Dr. Evil are actually brothers. Confused, Dr. Evil explains that his parents died in a car accident and he was raised by evil Belgians, but Nigel reveals that the explosion came from an assassination attempt and he thought that only Austin survived. Dr. Evil (revealed to be named Dougie), Austin, Nigel, and Mini-Me embrace; enraging Scott, who leaves to pursue his own vengeance while Goldmember commandeers the tractor beam&#x27;s controls, revealing his golden genitalia to be a spare key. Goldmember activates the tractor beam, but Austin and Dr. Evil work together to reverse its polarity, destroying the meteor and saving the world.

The entire story is later adapted into the film &quot;Austinpussy&quot;. Upon exiting the cinema, Austin and Foxxy encounter Fat Bastard, now thin but with sagging flesh thanks to the Subway diet. As Austin and Foxxy kiss, Scott Evil – now completely bald and behaving as his father, declares he will get his revenge against Austin. During the end credits, Mini-Me talks with Britney Spears, who wants to give him her phone number.

==Production==
===Title concerns===
The title of the film, &quot;Goldmember&quot;, led to legal action being taken by MGM, the distributors of the &quot;James Bond&quot; film franchise, that briefly led to the film&#x27;s title being removed from promotional material and trailers. Several potential replacement titles were prepared, including &quot;License to Shag&quot;, &quot;Live and Let Shag&quot;, &quot;You Only Shag Thrice&quot; and &quot;Never Say Member Again.&quot; The dispute was quickly resolved and the film title remained unchanged on the provision that the film would include trailers in its cinema releases for the then-upcoming James Bond film, &quot;Die Another Day&quot;, and &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers&quot;.

===Characters===
Austin Powers (Myers), having conquered the 1990s and the 1960s, travels back to the 1970s and teams up with his nemesis Dr. Evil (also played by Myers) to thwart a new villain, Goldmember (Myers once again). Myers also plays Fat Bastard for the second time, this time parodying the kind of &quot;wire fight&quot; seen in &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot;. The film also stars Beyoncé Knowles as Foxxy Cleopatra (parodying blaxploitation heroines, primarily Foxy Brown and Cleopatra Jones, as well as Christie Love when she says, &quot;You&#x27;re under arrest, sugah!&quot;), Michael York, reprising the role of Basil Exposition, and Verne Troyer in his second appearance as Mini-Me. The film also introduced a new character named Number 3 (a.k.a. the Mole), who is portrayed by former child star Fred Savage. Clint Howard plays a radar operator in all three films. Michael Caine guest stars as Austin&#x27;s father, Nigel; this role was inspired by the character of Harry Palmer from &quot;The Ipcress File&quot;, a 1965 film starring Caine. Sean Connery was originally considered for the role of Nigel Powers and Honor Blackman for that of Mrs. Powers.

Four actors who appeared in the earlier films play different characters in &quot;Goldmember&quot;. Rob Lowe, who played the friend of a dead guard in &quot;International Man of Mystery&quot;, reprises his role as a younger Number 2 from &quot;The Spy Who Shagged Me&quot;, while Neil Mullarkey (quartermaster clerk in &quot;International Man of Mystery&quot;) and Eric Winzenried (army private soldier in &quot;The Spy Who Shagged Me&quot;) appear as the Physician and Henchman Sailor in the Sick Bay. Michael McDonald (the Virtucon guard who got run over by a steamroller in &quot;International Man of Mystery&quot; and a NATO soldier in &quot;The Spy Who Shagged Me&quot;) appears as the royal guard.

====Goldmember====
Johann van der Smut, better known as Goldmember, is a fictional villain played by Myers (John Travolta plays the character in a cameo at the end of the film). The name was inspired by the James Bond villain Auric Goldfinger. Goldmember&#x27;s Dutch origins and character traits were, according to Myers, inspired by an episode of the HBO TV series &quot;Real Sex&quot; featuring a Dutchman who operated a &quot;sex barn&quot; north of Rotterdam. The man&#x27;s distinct forms of expression caught Myers&#x27; attention while he was writing.

==Release==
===Box office===
&quot;Austin Powers in Goldmember&quot; took in £6,364,796 in the United Kingdom on its opening weekend. In the United States, it broke the opening weekend record for a spoof movie, surpassing the previous Austin Powers films. It grossed $73.1 million during its opening weekend, surpassing &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; for the biggest July opening of all time. The latter record would be held for two years until &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; took it in 2004. The film also surpassed &quot;Rush Hour 2&quot; as the biggest opening for a comedy film. This was the fourth-highest opening weekend of all time, behind &quot;Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones&quot;, &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#x27;s Stone&quot; and &quot;Spider-Man&quot;. The film grossed a total of $213.3 million in the United States and $296.7 million worldwide, according to Box Office Mojo.

===Home media===
&quot;Austin Powers in Goldmember&quot; was released on VHS and DVD on December 3, 2002 by New Line Home Entertainment. The DVD was released under the &quot;Infinifilm&quot; label, and was re-packed in 2011 as part of the &quot;Austin Powers 3 Film Collection&quot;. The film debuted on Blu-ray for the first time on December 2, 2008 in a three-film collection with its predecessors.

===Critical reception===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 53% based on 186 reviews, with an average rating of 5.8/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;While the narrative structure is messy and doesn&#x27;t make much sense, the third installment of the &quot;Austin Powers&quot; franchise contains enough inspired bits to entertain.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 62 out of 100, based on 34 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

===Awards===
Myers was nominated for the MTV Movie Award for Best Villain for the third time, but lost against Daveigh Chase for her role as Samara Morgan in &quot;The Ring&quot;, making it the first time Myers lost the award. However, he did win the award for Best Comedic Performance, making it the first time he won the award, having previously lost twice for the first two films.

In October 2005, in an interview with &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Mike Myers discussed the possibility of studio sources moving forward with a fourth film. &quot;There is hope!&quot;. &quot;We&#x27;re all circling and talking to each other. I miss doing the characters.&quot; In May 2007, in an interview with IGN, &quot;So no more &quot;Austin Powers&quot;?&quot; was asked, and Myers replied, &quot;No, no, there is a fully conceived idea for a fourth and I can just say that it&#x27;s from Dr. Evil&#x27;s point of view. So if you balanced how much of it was Austin with Dr. Evil, it&#x27;s more about Austin&#x27;s secret son than Austin&quot;. Also, in the audio commentary from the DVD release of &quot;Goldmember&quot;, Myers revealed that in the fourth film, Fat Bastard would return and regain the weight that he lost in &quot;Goldmember&quot;.

In May 2007, at the &quot;Shrek the Third&quot; premiere, Myers announced that a fourth &quot;Austin Powers&quot; film was planned, reiterating that it would focus more on Dr. Evil rather than Austin. He also said that he would start work on it after he started work on &quot;The Love Guru&quot;, which became a box office bomb. In February 2008, it was announced that Jay Roach would return as director. In April 2008, it was reported that Gisele Bündchen had been offered a role in the film. However, Seth Green, who played Scott Evil, stated that there was no script at the moment and that &quot;Austin Powers 4&quot; would be made if a script is written and approved. In June 2008, when asked about another &quot;Austin Powers&quot; film in an interview, Myers stated, &quot;I have an idea, and again it&#x27;s one of those things that will emerge or it won&#x27;t.&quot; In July 2008, Myers stated that he had begun writing &quot;Austin Powers 4&quot;, and that the plot is &quot;really about Dr. Evil and his son.&quot;

In March 2010, Jay Roach indicated to MTV that Myers is working on ideas for a fourth film. In August 2011, Myers revealed he would return, and had begun writing a script for a fourth installment. In September 2013, when asked about the future of &quot;Austin Powers&quot;, Myers answered &quot;I&#x27;m still figuring that out.&quot; In September 2015, Verne Troyer expressed his desire to return as Mini-Me if he was asked to do so.

In May 2016, Roach was asked about the fourth &quot;Austin Powers&quot; film during an interview with Larry King, and he stated the ideas for the fourth film that he and Myers have are good and interesting. In August 2016, in a telephone interview, Myers stated &quot;Everything is being negotiated and worked out and all that stuff&quot; in regards to the fourth installment of the &quot;Austin Powers&quot; film series.

In April 2017, as the twentieth anniversary approached for &quot;Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery&quot;, Myers claimed he would love to do another &quot;Austin Powers&quot; film, but audiences would &quot;just have to see&quot;. Two days later, Roach stated that a fourth film would only occur if Myers creates a good story for it. In May 2017, Troyer stated that Mini-Me will reveal that he can speak in the fourth movie. However, Troyer&#x27;s death on 21 April 2018 delayed the production of a fourth film and prevented him from reprising his role as Mini-Me. In May 2018, Myers reiterated his interest in making a fourth &quot;Austin Powers&quot;, stating that it would be fun, also hinting that some tribute to Troyer might be included. In November 2018, Myers stated that the project&#x27;s future is &quot;looking good&quot; with the script already written and that Austin Powers and Dr. Evil will return soon, citing his parenthood as the reason for how long the production has lasted and that Roach will most likely reprise his directorial duties.

In January 2020, Roach again indicated that he was interested in doing a fourth film.
In February 2022, Myers told &quot;The Today Show&quot; he &quot;would love to do&quot; a fourth &quot;Austin Powers&quot; movie but could &quot;neither confirm nor deny&quot; whether it would be made. 
In October 2022, Myers stated on the &quot;Tonight Show&quot; that he would &quot;love&quot; to make another &quot;Austin Powers&quot; film, again citing parenting as the main reason as to why the film has not yet been made.

<doc id="151467" wikidata="Q5498338" url="?curid=151467" title="Frederick M. Smith">
<text>Frederick Madison Smith (January 21, 1874 – March 20, 1946), generally known among his followers as &quot;Fred M.&quot;, was an American religious leader and author and the third Prophet-President of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (renamed the Community of Christ in 2001), serving from 1915 until his death.

Smith&#x27;s paternal grandfather was Joseph Smith Jr., the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, and his father was Joseph Smith III, the first president after the Church&#x27;s &quot;Reorganization.&quot; The first graduate of Graceland University, Fred M. earned a PhD in psychology from Clark University in 1916, setting him apart as one of the most highly educated members of his church at the time.

Smith&#x27;s leadership was controversial. One biographer has called him &quot;a man of paradox&quot; and &quot;one of the most controversial figures in Reorganization history.&quot; His presidency saw the church initiate a series of major projects, but it was also marred by the controversy over what became known as &quot;Supreme Directional Control.&quot;

==Biography==
Fred M. was one of nine children of Joseph Smith III and his second wife, Bertha Madison Smith. He was born on January 21, 1874, at Plano, Illinois, and baptized on July 20, 1883.

Summary of education:

*1895 educated at Iowa City Academy
*1896 University of Iowa
*1898 BA from Graceland College — the first graduate of this college
*1911 MA from the University of Kansas
*1916 PhD from Clark University

On August 3, 1897, Smith married Alice Lyman Cobb (died May 4, 1926).

==Succession to the presidency==
Fred M. Smith became a counselor in the RLDS Church&#x27;s First Presidency in 1902. As his father&#x27;s health declined, Fred M. assumed greater and greater responsibilities in the management of the church and its auxiliary institutions. Joseph Smith III died on December 10, 1914, and Fred M. was ordained as the new Prophet-President the following spring on May 5, 1915.

==Zion and the social gospel==
Smith was known for his interests in applying the principles of the newly emerging fields of sociology and social welfare to the Church&#x27;s thinking on the principles and doctrine of Zion. Smith was influenced by the contemporary Social Gospel movement, which endeavored to apply Christian ethics to societal problems, including social justice, health care, and care for the poor, for orphans, and the elderly. In broad terms, Smith felt the need to address these issues as part of the overall call to &quot;build Zion.&quot; In this way he both embraced and modernized his grandfather Joseph Smith Jr.&#x27;s vision to build a literal city of Zion in Independence, Missouri.

In order to fulfill his vision, Smith initiated a number of ambitious programs, including the construction of the Auditorium, expansion of the Independence Sanitarium (later known as Independence Regional Hospital), construction of an old-age home in Independence originally known as &quot;Resthaven&quot; (now &quot;the Groves&quot;), and a planned agricultural cooperative in Atherton, Missouri.

As part of his modernizing program, Smith was an early adopter of radio. In 1924, the RLDS Church&#x27;s radio station, known as KFIX (later KLDS), became the first church-owned radio station in the United States to be licensed.

He also presided during the difficult depression years which stalled or halted many of his projects, as the church faced issues of major financial debt.

==Supreme directional control==
He became embroiled in a controversy over &quot;Supreme Directional Control&quot;, regarding leadership and financial control of the church. The dispute led to a significant loss in membership due to the formation of splinter sects by those opposed to the policy. Smith became the first president of the church to submit a notice of resignation. However, the General Conference to which he submitted his resignation, refused to accept it.

He died in 1946, and was succeeded by his brother, Israel Alexander Smith.

The Frederick Madison Smith Library is one of two libraries belonging to Graceland University, and is located on their Lamoni campus. It opened in 1966.

<doc id="151472" wikidata="Q730108" url="?curid=151472" title="Sisqó">
<text>Mark Althavan Andrews (born November 9, 1978), known professionally as Sisqó (stylized as SisQó), is an American R&amp;B singer. Following his tenure as lead performer of the R&amp;B group Dru Hill, he quickly reached success as a solo act with the release of his debut studio album &quot;Unleash the Dragon&quot; (1999), which peaked at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It spawned the singles &quot;Incomplete&quot; and &quot;Thong Song&quot;, which peaked at numbers one and three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, respectively. His second album, &quot;Return of Dragon&quot; (2001) failed commercially, as did his subsequent releases. He received 12th place on the eleventh season of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as Lizard.

==Early life==
As a teen, Andrews worked at The Fudgery in Harborplace at Baltimore&#x27;s Inner Harbor with Larry &quot;Jazz&quot; Anthony, James &quot;Woody&quot; Green, and Tamir &quot;Nokio&quot; Ruffin. The quartet would be signed as the group Dru Hill to Island Records in 1996. He lived in the Reservoir Hill neighborhood at 908 Newington Avenue near Druid Hill Park, which is where the group got their name.

==Career==
After Woody departed Dru Hill in 1999 to pursue a solo career, it was decided that the other members would follow suit and issue their own solo albums. Sisqó&#x27;s solo debut, &quot;Unleash the Dragon&quot;, was released on Def Soul Records in November 1999. &quot;Unleash the Dragon&quot; sold moderately at first, until the February 2000 release of its second single, the novelty &quot;Thong Song&quot;. A runaway hit, &quot;Thong Song&quot; and its follow-up, &quot;Incomplete&quot;, were major hits on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, with &quot;Thong Song&quot; making it to number three, and &quot;Incomplete&quot; going to #1. This success resulted in Play Along Toys manufacturing a Sisqó doll in 2001.

Formed by Sisqó in 1999, LovHer was the first female quartet on the Def Soul label. Their single &quot;How It&#x27;s Gonna Be&quot; was featured on the Rush Hour 2 soundtrack in 2001.

Conflicts within Dru Hill prevented the group from reuniting as planned in 2000. This is usually attributed to time conflicts during the recording of Sisqó&#x27;s second solo LP. During this period, Sisqó branched out into hosting the dance competition program &quot;Sisqós Shakedown&quot; on MTV, and into film, taking on supporting roles in the films &quot;Get Over It&quot; (2001) with Kirsten Dunst and &quot;Snow Dogs&quot; (2002) with Cuba Gooding, Jr. He also starred as a vampire in &quot;Sabrina the Teenage Witch&quot; (Season 6 Episode 1). Although his second LP, &quot;Return of Dragon&quot;, released in June 2001, eventually went platinum, its singles &quot;Can I Live&quot; and &quot;Dance for Me&quot; performed far below expectations (apart from in the United Kingdom, where &quot;Dance for Me&quot; became his third top ten hit). By 2002, Sisqó reunited with Dru Hill, which released its third LP in late 2002. The LP underperformed, and the group was subsequently released from their recording contract.

In January 2008, Sisqó was a contestant on a reality show called &quot;Gone Country.&quot;

In 2010, Sisqó was a contestant on the British reality television show &quot;Celebrity Big Brother 7&quot;, which he placed 8th. He was the fifth contestant to be evicted, lasting 20 days.

Dru Hill released its third album, &quot;InDRUpendence Day&quot;, in 2010 as an independent release through Kedar Entertainment. The group also appeared at this time in the reality show &quot;Keith Sweat&#x27;s Platinum House&quot; on BET&#x27;s sister station Centric.

Sisqó continued to tour through the 2010s, both as a member of Dru Hill, and as a solo act. His third solo album, &quot;Last Dragon&quot;, was released on February 10, 2015. The singles, &quot;A-List&quot; and &quot;L.I.P.s&quot; were released ahead of the album, with the latter reaching number 23 on the US Adult R&amp;B charts, becoming Sisqó&#x27;s first charting US single since 2001&#x27;s &quot;Can I Live&quot;.

, Sisqó, along with the other members of Dru Hill, claimed that their record label botched a record deal, costing them millions in the process.

In 2016, Sisqó provided a rap counterpoint in a duet with country music singer Marie Osmond, in her song &quot;Give me a Good Song&quot;, which was featured on &quot;Music Is Medicine&quot;, released on April 15, 2016.

In 2017, Sisqó, sang on a remake of his &quot;Thong Song&quot; produced by JCY.

In 2018, Sisqo released a holiday book for children, titled &quot;Sisqo&#x27;s Perfect Christmas&quot;, with creative partner, Tilesha Brown.

He represented Maryland in the American Song Contest, which began on March 21, 2022, on NBC.

In 2024, Sisqó competed on season eleven of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Lizard&quot;. He was eliminated on &quot;Shower Anthems Night&quot; and did an encore performance of &quot;Thong Song&quot;.

==Personal life==
Sisqó has a daughter, Shaione Andrews, born in 1995. He resides in Maple Grove, Minnesota, with his wife Elizabeth Pham, with whom he has been romantically involved since 2003. They have two children: a son named Ryu Andrews born in June 2012, and a daughter named Kimiqo Star, aka QoQo born in September 2014.

In July 2013, Sisqó appeared on the reality show &quot;Celebrity Wife Swap&quot;, where Elizabeth was &quot;swapped&quot; with the wife of 1990s pop singer Gerardo Mejía.

He previously dated R&amp;B singer Samantha Mumba from 2004 to 2005.

<text>In signal processing and related disciplines, aliasing is a phenomenon that a reconstructed signal from samples of the original signal contains low frequency components that are not present in the original one. This is caused when, in the original signal, there are components at frequency exceeding a certain frequency called Nyquist frequency, formula_1, where formula_2 is the sampling frequency (undersampling). This is because typical reconstruction methods use low frequency components while there are a number of frequency components, called aliases, which sampling result in the identical sample. It also often refers to the distortion or artifact that results when a signal reconstructed from samples is different from the original continuous signal.

Aliasing can occur in signals sampled in time, for instance in digital audio or the stroboscopic effect, and is referred to as temporal aliasing. Aliasing in spatially sampled signals (e.g., moiré patterns in digital images) is referred to as spatial aliasing.

Aliasing is generally avoided by applying low-pass filters or anti-aliasing filters (AAF) to the input signal before sampling and when converting a signal from a higher to a lower sampling rate. Suitable reconstruction filtering should then be used when restoring the sampled signal to the continuous domain or converting a signal from a lower to a higher sampling rate. For spatial anti-aliasing, the types of anti-aliasing include fast approximate anti-aliasing (FXAA), multisample anti-aliasing, and supersampling.

== Description ==

When a digital image is viewed, a reconstruction is performed by a display or printer device, and by the eyes and the brain. If the image data is processed incorrectly during sampling or reconstruction, the reconstructed image will differ from the original image, and an alias is seen.

An example of spatial aliasing is the moiré pattern observed in a poorly pixelized image of a brick wall. Spatial anti-aliasing techniques avoid such poor pixelizations. Aliasing can be caused either by the sampling stage or the reconstruction stage; these may be distinguished by calling sampling aliasing &quot;prealiasing&quot; and reconstruction aliasing &quot;postaliasing.&quot;

Temporal aliasing is a major concern in the sampling of video and audio signals. Music, for instance, may contain high-frequency components that are inaudible to humans. If a piece of music is sampled at 32,000 samples per second (Hz), any frequency components at or above 16,000 Hz (the Nyquist frequency for this sampling rate) will cause aliasing when the music is reproduced by a digital-to-analog converter (DAC). The high frequencies in the analog signal will appear as lower frequencies (wrong alias) in the recorded digital sample and, hence, cannot be reproduced by the DAC. To prevent this, an anti-aliasing filter is used to remove components above the Nyquist frequency prior to sampling.

In video or cinematography, temporal aliasing results from the limited frame rate, and causes the wagon-wheel effect, whereby a spoked wheel appears to rotate too slowly or even backwards. Aliasing has changed its apparent frequency of rotation. A reversal of direction can be described as a negative frequency. Temporal aliasing frequencies in video and cinematography are determined by the frame rate of the camera, but the relative intensity of the aliased frequencies is determined by the shutter timing (exposure time) or the use of a temporal aliasing reduction filter during filming.
Like the video camera, most sampling schemes are periodic; that is, they have a characteristic sampling frequency in time or in space. Digital cameras provide a certain number of samples (pixels) per degree or per radian, or samples per mm in the focal plane of the camera. Audio signals are sampled (digitized) with an analog-to-digital converter, which produces a constant number of samples per second. Some of the most dramatic and subtle examples of aliasing occur when the signal being sampled also has periodic content.

== Bandlimited functions ==
Actual signals have a finite duration and their frequency content, as defined by the Fourier transform, has no upper bound. Some amount of aliasing always occurs when such continuous functions over time are sampled. Functions whose frequency content is bounded (&quot;bandlimited&quot;) have an infinite duration in the time domain. If sampled at a high enough rate, determined by the &quot;bandwidth&quot;, the original function can, in theory, be perfectly reconstructed from the infinite set of samples.

== Bandpass signals ==
Sometimes aliasing is used intentionally on signals with no low-frequency content, called &quot;bandpass&quot; signals. Undersampling, which creates low-frequency aliases, can produce the same result, with less effort, as frequency-shifting the signal to lower frequencies before sampling at the lower rate. Some digital channelizers exploit aliasing in this way for computational efficiency. 
(See Sampling (signal processing), Nyquist rate (relative to sampling), and Filter bank.)

== Sampling sinusoidal functions ==
Sinusoids are an important type of periodic function, because realistic signals are often modeled as the summation of many sinusoids of different frequencies and different amplitudes (for example, with a Fourier series or transform). Understanding what aliasing does to the individual sinusoids is useful in understanding what happens to their sum.

When sampling a function at frequency (i.e., the sampling interval is ), the following functions of time yield identical sets of samples if the sampling starts from formula_3 such that formula_4 where formula_5, and so on:

formula_6

A frequency spectrum of the samples produces equally strong responses at all those frequencies. Without collateral information, the frequency of the original function is ambiguous. So, the functions and their frequencies are said to be &quot;aliases&quot; of each other. Noting the sine functions as odd functions:

:formula_7

thus, we can write all the alias frequencies as positive values: formula_8. For example, a snapshot of the lower right frame of Fig.2 shows a component at the actual frequency formula_9 and another component at alias formula_10. As formula_9 increases during the animation, formula_10 decreases. The point at which they are equal formula_13 is an axis of symmetry called the folding frequency, also known as Nyquist frequency.

Aliasing matters when one attempts to reconstruct the original waveform from its samples. The most common reconstruction technique produces the smallest of the formula_14 frequencies. So, it is usually important that formula_15 be the unique minimum. A necessary and sufficient condition for that is formula_16 called the Nyquist condition. The lower left frame of Fig.2 depicts the typical reconstruction result of the available samples. Until formula_9 exceeds the Nyquist frequency, the reconstruction matches the actual waveform (upper left frame). After that, it is the low frequency alias of the upper frame.

=== Folding ===
The figures below offer additional depictions of aliasing, due to sampling. A graph of amplitude vs frequency (not time) for a single sinusoid at frequency and some of its aliases at and would look like the 4 black dots in Fig.3. The red lines depict the paths () of the 4 dots if we were to adjust the frequency and amplitude of the sinusoid along the solid red segment (between and ). No matter what function we choose to change the amplitude vs frequency, the graph will exhibit symmetry between 0 and Folding is often observed in practice when viewing the frequency spectrum of real-valued samples, such as Fig.4.


=== Complex sinusoids ===

Complex sinusoids are waveforms whose samples are complex numbers (formula_18), and the concept of negative frequency is necessary to distinguish them. In that case, the frequencies of the aliases are given by just: (In real sinusoids, as shown in the above, all alias frequencies can be written as positive frequencies formula_8 because of sine functions as odd functions.) Therefore, as increases from to also increases (from to 0). Consequently, complex sinusoids do not exhibit &quot;folding&quot;.

=== Sample frequency ===

When the condition is met for the highest frequency component of the original signal, then it is met for all the frequency components, a condition called the Nyquist criterion. That is typically approximated by filtering the original signal to attenuate high frequency components before it is sampled. These attenuated high frequency components still generate low-frequency aliases, but typically at low enough amplitudes that they do not cause problems. A filter chosen in anticipation of a certain sample frequency is called an anti-aliasing filter.

The filtered signal can subsequently be reconstructed, by interpolation algorithms, without significant additional distortion. Most sampled signals are not simply stored and reconstructed. But the fidelity of a theoretical reconstruction (via the Whittaker–Shannon interpolation formula) is a customary measure of the effectiveness of sampling.

== Historical usage ==

Historically the term &quot;aliasing&quot; evolved from radio engineering because of the action of superheterodyne receivers. When the receiver shifts multiple signals down to lower frequencies, from RF to IF by heterodyning, an unwanted signal, from an RF frequency equally far from the local oscillator (LO) frequency as the desired signal, but on the wrong side of the LO, can end up at the same IF frequency as the wanted one. If it is strong enough it can interfere with reception of the desired signal. This unwanted signal is known as an &quot;image&quot; or &quot;alias&quot; of the desired signal.

The first written use of the terms &quot;alias&quot; and &quot;aliasing&quot; in signal processing appears to be in a 1949 unpublished Bell Laboratories technical memorandum by John Tukey and Richard Hamming. That paper includes an example of frequency aliasing dating back to 1922. The first &quot;published&quot; use of the term &quot;aliasing&quot; in this context is due to Blackman and Tukey in 1958. In their preface to the Dover reprint of this paper, they point out that the idea of aliasing had been illustrated graphically by Stumpf ten years prior.

The 1949 Bell technical report refers to aliasing as though it is a well-known concept, but does not offer a source for the term. Gwilym Jenkins and Maurice Priestley credit Tukey with introducing it in this context, though an analogous concept of aliasing had been introduced a few years earlier in fractional factorial designs. While Tukey did significant work in factorial experiments and was certainly aware of aliasing in fractional designs, it cannot be determined whether his use of &quot;aliasing&quot; in signal processing was consciously inspired by such designs.

== Angular aliasing ==
Aliasing occurs whenever the use of discrete elements to capture or produce a continuous signal causes frequency ambiguity.

Spatial aliasing, particular of angular frequency, can occur when reproducing a light field or sound field with discrete elements, as in 3D displays or wave field synthesis of sound.

This aliasing is visible in images such as posters with lenticular printing: if they have low angular resolution, then as one moves past them, say from left-to-right, the 2D image does not initially change (so it appears to move left), then as one moves to the next angular image, the image suddenly changes (so it jumps right) – and the frequency and amplitude of this side-to-side movement corresponds to the angular resolution of the image (and, for frequency, the speed of the viewer&#x27;s lateral movement), which is the angular aliasing of the 4D light field.

The lack of parallax on viewer movement in 2D images and in 3-D film produced by stereoscopic glasses (in 3D films the effect is called &quot;yawing&quot;, as the image appears to rotate on its axis) can similarly be seen as loss of angular resolution, all angular frequencies being aliased to 0 (constant).

== More examples ==

=== Audio example ===

The qualitative effects of aliasing can be heard in the following audio demonstration. Six sawtooth waves are played in succession, with the first two sawtooths having a fundamental frequency of 440 Hz (A4), the second two having fundamental frequency of 880 Hz (A5), and the final two at 1760 Hz (A6). The sawtooths alternate between bandlimited (non-aliased) sawtooths and aliased sawtooths and the sampling rate is 22050 Hz. The bandlimited sawtooths are synthesized from the sawtooth waveform&#x27;s Fourier series such that no harmonics above the Nyquist frequency (11025 Hz = 22050 Hz / 2 here) are present.

The aliasing distortion in the lower frequencies is increasingly obvious with higher fundamental frequencies, and while the bandlimited sawtooth is still clear at 1760 Hz, the aliased sawtooth is degraded and harsh with a buzzing audible at frequencies lower than the fundamental.

=== Direction finding ===
A form of spatial aliasing can also occur in antenna arrays or microphone arrays used to estimate the direction of arrival of a wave signal, as in geophysical exploration by seismic waves. Waves must be sampled more densely than two points per wavelength, or the wave arrival direction becomes ambiguous.

<doc id="151475" wikidata="Q332435" url="?curid=151475" title="Edward Coke">
<text>Sir Edward Coke ( , ; 1 February 1552 – 3 September 1634) was an English barrister, judge, and politician. He is often considered the greatest jurist of the Elizabethan and Jacobean eras.

Born into an upper-class family, Coke was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, before leaving to study at the Inner Temple, where he was called to the Bar on 20 April 1578. As a barrister, he took part in several notable cases, including &quot;Slade&#x27;s Case&quot;, before earning enough political favour to be elected to Parliament, where he served first as Solicitor General and then as Speaker of the House of Commons. Following a promotion to Attorney General he led the prosecution in several notable cases, including those against Robert Devereux, Sir Walter Raleigh, and the Gunpowder Plot conspirators. As a reward for his services he was first knighted and then made Chief Justice of the Common Pleas.

As Chief Justice, Coke restricted the use of the &quot;ex officio&quot; (Star Chamber) oath and, in the &quot;Case of Proclamations&quot; and &quot;Dr. Bonham&#x27;s Case&quot;, declared the King to be subject to the law, and the laws of Parliament to be void if in violation of &quot;common right and reason&quot;. These actions eventually led to his transfer to the Chief Justiceship of the King&#x27;s Bench, where it was felt he could do less damage. Coke then successively restricted the definition of treason and declared a royal letter illegal, leading to his dismissal from the bench on 14 November 1616. With no chance of regaining his judicial posts, he instead returned to Parliament, where he swiftly became a leading member of the opposition. During his time as a Member of Parliament he wrote and campaigned for the Statute of Monopolies, which substantially restricted the ability of the monarch to grant patents, and authored and was instrumental in the passage of the Petition of Right, a document considered one of the three crucial constitutional documents of England, along with Magna Carta and the Bill of Rights 1689.

Coke is best known in modern times for his &quot;Institutes&quot;, described by John Rutledge as &quot;almost the foundations of our law&quot;, and his &quot;Reports&quot;, which have been called &quot;perhaps the single most influential series of named reports&quot;. Historically, he was a highly influential judge; within England and Wales, his statements and works were used to justify the right to silence, while the Statute of Monopolies is considered to be one of the first actions in the conflict between Parliament and monarch that led to the English Civil War. In America, Coke&#x27;s decision in &quot;Dr. Bonham&#x27;s Case&quot; was used to justify the voiding of both the Stamp Act 1765 and writs of assistance, which led to the American War of Independence; after the establishment of the United States his decisions and writings profoundly influenced the Third and Fourth amendments to the United States Constitution while necessitating the Sixteenth.

==Family background and early life==
The surname &quot;Coke&quot;, or &quot;Cocke&quot;, can be traced back to a William Coke in the hundred of South Greenhoe, now the Norfolk town of Swaffham, in around 1150. The family was relatively prosperous and influential – members from the 14th century onwards included an Under-Sheriff, a Knight Banneret, a barrister and a merchant. The name &quot;Coke&quot; was pronounced during the Elizabethan age, although it is now pronounced . The origin of the name is uncertain: it has been suggested that &quot;Coke&quot; or &quot;Cock&quot; was a word meaning &quot;river&quot; or &quot;chief&quot; among the early Britons, but a more likely hypothesis is that the spelling arose from an attempt to disguise the word &quot;cook&quot;. That &quot;cook&quot; and &quot;coke&quot; were homonyms at this time is shown by the fact that Coke&#x27;s second wife, Elizabeth Hatton, regularly spelt his name &quot;Cook&quot; when writing to him.

Coke&#x27;s father, Robert Coke, was a barrister and Bencher of Lincoln&#x27;s Inn who built up a strong practice representing clients from his home area of Norfolk. Over time, he bought several manors at Congham, West Acre and Happisburgh, all in Norfolk, and was granted a coat of arms, becoming a minor member of the gentry. Coke&#x27;s mother, Winifred Knightley, came from a family even more intimately linked with the law than her husband. Her father and grandfather had practised law in the Norfolk area, and her sister Audrey was married to Thomas Gawdy, a lawyer and Justice of the Court of King&#x27;s Bench with links to the Earl of Arundel. This connection later served Edward well. Winifred&#x27;s father later married Agnes, the sister of Nicholas Hare.

Edward Coke was born on 1 February 1552 in his father&#x27;s manor of Mileham in Norfolk (acquired by him in 1553) one of eight children. The other seven were daughters – Winifred, Dorothy, Elizabeth, Ursula, Anna, Margaret and Ethelreda – although it is not known in which order the children were born. Two years after Robert Coke died on 15 November 1561, his widow married Robert Bozoun, a property trader noted for his piety and strong business acumen (once forcing Nicholas Bacon to pay an exorbitant amount of money for a piece of property). He had a tremendous influence on the Coke children: from Bozoun Coke learnt to &quot;loathe concealers, prefer godly men and briskly do business with any willing client&quot;, something that shaped his future conduct as a lawyer, politician, and judge.

==Education and call to the Bar==
At the age of eight in 1560, Coke began studying at the Norwich Free Grammar School. The education there was based on erudition, the eventual goal being that by the age of 18 the students would have learned &quot;to vary one sentence diversely, to make a verse exactly, to an epistle eloquently and learnedly, to declaim of a theme simple, and last of all to attain some competent knowledge of the Greek tongue&quot;. The students were taught rhetoric based on the &quot;Rhetorica ad Herennium&quot;, and Greek centred on the works of Homer and Virgil. Coke was taught at Norwich to value the &quot;forcefulness of freedom of speech&quot;, something he later applied as a judge. Some accounts relate that he was a diligent student who applied himself well.

After leaving Norwich in 1567 he matriculated to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied for three years until the end of 1570, when he left without gaining a degree. Little is known of his time at Trinity, though he certainly studied rhetoric and dialectics under a program instituted in 1559. His biographers felt he had all the intelligence to be a good student, though a record of his academic achievements has not been found. Coke was proud of Cambridge and the time he spent there, later saying in &quot;Dr. Bonham&#x27;s Case&quot; that Cambridge and Oxford were &quot;the eyes and soul of the realm, from whence religion, the humanities, and learning were richly diffused into all parts of the realm.&quot;

After leaving Trinity College he travelled to London, where he became a member of Clifford&#x27;s Inn in 1571. This was to learn the basics of the law – the Inns of Chancery, including Clifford&#x27;s Inn, provided initial legal education before transfer to the Inns of Court, where one could be called to the Bar and practise as a barrister. Students were educated through arguments and debates – they would be given precedents and writs each day, discuss them at the dinner table and then argue a moot court based on those precedents and their discussions. Coke also studied various writs &quot;till they turned honey sweet on his tongue&quot;, and after completing this stage of his legal education transferred to the Inner Temple on 24 April 1572.

At the Inner Temple, he began the second stage of his education, reading legal texts such as Glanville&#x27;s &quot;Treatises&quot; and taking part in moots. He took little interest in the theatrical performances or other cultural events at the Inns, preferring to spend his time at the law courts in Westminster Hall, listening to the Serjeants argue. After six years at the Inner Temple he was called to the Bar on 20 April 1578, a remarkably fast rate of progress given the process of legal education at the time, which normally required eight years of study. Polson, a biographer of Coke, suggests that this was due to his knowledge of the law, which &quot;excited the Benchers&quot;.

==Practice as a barrister==
After being called to the Bar on 20 April 1578 Coke immediately began practising as a barrister. His first case was in the Court of King&#x27;s Bench in 1581, and was known as &quot;Lord Cromwell&#x27;s Case&quot; after the claimant, Lord Henry Cromwell, a landlord in Coke&#x27;s home county of Norfolk. The case was a charge of slander against a Mr Denny, the Vicar of Northlinham and Coke&#x27;s client. In a dispute with Denny, Cromwell had hired two unlicensed preachers to harass him, denounce the Book of Common Prayer and preach the gospel in his area. Denny retorted by telling Cromwell &quot;you like not of me, since you like those that maintain sedition&quot;. Cromwell argued that Denny was guilty of &quot;scandalum magnatum&quot;, slander against a peer of the realm because his statement implied that Cromwell himself was seditious or had seditious tendencies.

The case was actually two actions, with the first judgement being given in Denny&#x27;s favour after Coke&#x27;s research found a flaw in the pleadings that invalidated Cromwell&#x27;s case. His counsel had worked from an inaccurate English copy of the Latin statute of &quot;scandalum magnatum&quot; which had mistranslated several passages, forcing them to start the case anew. After the case was restarted, Coke argued that Denny had commented on Cromwell&#x27;s support of people attacking the Book of Common Prayer, and was not implying any deeper disloyalty. The judge ruled that Denny&#x27;s statement had indeed meant this, and from this position of strength Coke forced a settlement. Coke was very proud of his actions in this case and later described it in his &quot;Reports&quot; as &quot;an excellent point of learning in actions of slander&quot;. The next year he was elected Reader of Lyon&#x27;s Inn for three years, something surprising considering his young age and likely related to his conduct in &quot;Lord Cromwell&#x27;s Case&quot;. As Reader he was tasked with reading to the students at the Inn, a group that numbered about thirty at any one time, and the quality of his readings increased his reputation even further. His lectures were on the Statute of Uses, and his reputation was such that when he retired to his house after an outbreak of the plague, &quot;nine Benchers, forty barristers, and others of the Inn accompanied him a considerable distance on his journey&quot; in order to talk to him.

During the 1580s, Coke became intimately linked with the Howard family, the Dukes of Norfolk and Earls of Arundel. His uncle Thomas Gawdy had close links to Earl Arundel himself. In Norfolk Arundel held a liberty – he was essentially a local prince who appointed all officials, maintained his own prison, executed justice and bribed any royal clerks. His power base was his household, particularly the network of lawyers and stewards who held his estates together. Coke&#x27;s uncle Thomas Gawdy had served as Steward to the Third Duke of Norfolk, and during the 1580s Coke was employed by the Howards to counter lawyers employed by the Crown, who argued that the Howards&#x27; lands were forfeit owing to the treason of the 4th Duke. As well as defeating these direct attacks Coke travelled to Cardiff to answer a challenge by Francis Dacre, son of William Dacre, 3rd Baron Dacre and uncle-in-law to the 4th Duke&#x27;s three sons, Philip Howard and his two half-brothers, Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk and Lord William Howard – he proved that Dacre&#x27;s evidence was false and had the case dismissed.

Coke became involved in the now classic &quot;Shelley&#x27;s Case&quot; in 1581, which created a rule in real property that is still used in some common law jurisdictions today; the case also established Coke&#x27;s reputation as an attorney and case reporter. His next famous case was &quot;Chudleigh&#x27;s Case&quot;, a dispute over the interpretation of the Statute of Uses, followed by &quot;Slade&#x27;s Case&quot;, a dispute between the Common Pleas and King&#x27;s Bench over &quot;assumpsit&quot; now regarded as a classic example of the friction between the two courts and the forward movement of contract law; Coke&#x27;s argument in &quot;Slade&#x27;s Case&quot; formed the first definition of consideration.

==Politics==
Thanks to his work on their behalf, Coke had earned the favour of the Dukes of Norfolk. When he secured the Lordship of Aldeburgh for them in 1588 he also obtained the Aldeburgh parliamentary constituency, which elected two Members of Parliament (MPs). With their support, Coke was returned for Aldeburgh as an MP in February 1589.

===Elizabeth I===
====Solicitor General and Speaker====
The political &quot;old guard&quot; began to change around the time Coke became a Member of Parliament. The Earl of Leicester died in 1588, followed by Sir Walter Mildmay, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, a year later, and Sir Francis Walsingham a year after that. In 1592 the Lord Chief Justice died and, according to custom the Attorney General, John Popham, succeeded him, with the Solicitor General, Thomas Egerton, succeeding Popham. This created a vacancy among the Law Officers of the Crown, and thanks to the influence of the Cecil family, Coke became Solicitor General on 16 June 1592. This was likely a narrow victory owing to Coke&#x27;s defence of unpopular clients; he was summoned before Elizabeth I, who berated him until he cried before confirming him as Solicitor General.

Coke held the position only briefly; by the time he returned from a tour of Norfolk to discuss election strategy, he had been confirmed as Speaker of the House of Commons by the Privy Council, having been proposed by Francis Knollys and Thomas Heneage following his return to Parliament as MP for Norfolk. Coke held the positions of Speaker and Solicitor-General at the same time, although he did not take up his post as Speaker until the state opening of Parliament on 19 February 1593 (despite being confirmed on 28 January 1593).

After &quot;disabling&quot; himself in the House of Lords (a ceremony in which the incoming Speaker apologised for his failings) Parliament was suspended until 24 February; Coke returned two days later, having suffered from a stomach problem. The Parliament was intended to be a brief and simple one; with the Black Death resurgent throughout England and the threat of Spain on the horizon, the only matter was to impose certain taxes to fund the Queen&#x27;s campaign against the Spanish, with no bills to be introduced. The taxes were paramount; subsidies collected in 1589 had been spent, and the war continued.

The idea of a calm, swift Parliament foundered on the rocks of religious conflict. On 27 February James Morice, a Puritan Member of Parliament, proposed two new bills: one against the bishops of the Church of England, and the other against the Court of High Commission. Morice was placed under house arrest, and seven Members of Parliament were later arrested, but the bills remained in Parliament. They were defended by Francis Knollys, one of the few remaining Puritan Members of Parliament, while other Puritans spat and coughed to drown out speeches by opponents.

Coke and Cecil, the government&#x27;s two strongest defenders in Parliament, made several efforts to put off or end the debate over the bills. Cecil first pointed out that the Queen had forbidden bills on religion; Parliament ignored him, and the bill went ahead. Coke, as Speaker of the House of Commons (whose job was to schedule any bills), conducted a delaying campaign, first suggesting that the bill was too long to be read in the morning and then that it be delegated to a committee; both suggestions were voted down by the Commons. Coke continued talking until the end of the Parliamentary day in a filibuster action, granting a day of delay for the government. Immediately afterwards, Coke was summoned by the Queen, who made it clear that any action on the bills would be considered evidence of disloyalty. The warning was accepted by the Commons, and no more action was taken on the two Puritan bills.

====Attorney General====
On 10 April 1594, Coke was made Attorney General for England and Wales thanks to his partnership with the Cecil family. Francis Bacon, his rival, was supported by Robert Devereux, who waged a constant war against Robert Cecil for control of the English government. The position of Master of the Rolls had become vacant in April 1593, and Coke was expected to be appointed according to convention; Bacon, therefore, would become Attorney General. Coke reacted by becoming even more dogmatic in his actions on behalf of the Crown, and when Devereux approached the queen on Bacon&#x27;s behalf, she replied that even Bacon&#x27;s uncle [Lord Burghley] considered him the second best candidate, after Coke. The Attorney General was the main prosecutor of the Crown, expected to bring all charges on its behalf and serve as its legal advisor in any situation. Coke was appointed in a time of particular difficulty; besides famine and the conflict with Spain, war had recently broken out in Ireland.

Coke primarily dealt with matters of treason, such as the cases of Sir John Smythe and Edward Squire. He also handled religious incidents such as the disputes between the Jesuits and the Church of England, personally interrogating John Gerard after his capture. As the 1590s continued, the infighting between Cecil and Devereux persisted, with Devereux&#x27;s raid on Cadiz earning him national fame. In March 1599 Devereux was sent to defeat the growing rebellion in Ireland and was given command of 18,000 men, but by November his army was reduced to 4,000, the rest &quot;frittered away&quot; in exchange for &quot;[conquering] nothing&quot;.

On 5 June 1600, he faced a panel of Privy Councillors, judges and members of the nobility at York House, where he was charged with appointing generals without the Queen&#x27;s permission, ignoring orders and negotiating &quot;very basely&quot; with the leader of the rebel forces. While the members of the nobility wished to be gentle with Devereux, the lawyers and judges felt differently, recommending fines and confinement in the Tower of London. In the end a compromise was reached, with Devereux put under house arrest and dismissed from all his government offices.

Devereux immediately began plotting rebellion. Orders were sent out for &quot;bedding&quot; and &quot;draperies&quot; – codenames for weapons – and rebellious gentlemen gathered at Essex House to hear him talk of Elizabeth&#x27;s &quot;crooked mind and crooked carcass&quot;. In response, Coke and Cecil began a counter-plot. In 1599, Sir John Hayward had written and published &quot;The First Part of the Life and Raigne of King Henrie IV&quot;, dedicating it to Devereux. Elizabeth, furious, banned the book, suggesting that it was a &quot;seditious prelude&quot; intended to show her as a corrupt and poor monarch. Against the backdrop of Devereux&#x27;s plot, Coke and Cecil started a new investigation into the book, hoping to prove some involvement of Devereux in the publishing. Coke interviewed Hayward&#x27;s licensing cleric, Samuel Harsnett, who complained that the dedication had been &quot;foisted&quot; on him by Devereux. In reaction, Coke decided to bring charges of treason against Devereux, saying that he had &quot;plotted and practised with the Pope and king of Spain for the deposing and selling of himself as well as the crown of England ... His permitting underhand that treasonable book of Henry IV to be printed and published; it being plainly deciphered, not only by the matter, and by the epistle itself, for what end and for whose behalf it was made, but also the Earl himself being present so often at the playing thereof, and with great applause giving countenance to it&quot;.

The charges were never brought because of an incident that soon transpired. On 8 February 1601 Devereux ordered his followers to meet at Essex House. A day later a group of emissaries led by Thomas Egerton and John Popham were sent to Devereux and immediately taken hostage. After a failed attempt to garner support from the population of London, Devereux found himself surrounded in Essex House; after burning his personal papers, he surrendered. On 19 February he was tried for treason, along with the Earl of Southampton. Coke led the case for the government, and Devereux was found guilty and executed; the Earl of Southampton was reprieved.

===James I===
On 24 March 1603, Elizabeth I died. James VI of Scotland set out to claim the English throne, taking the title James I, and the Cokes immediately began ingratiating themselves with the new monarch and his family. Elizabeth Hatton, Coke&#x27;s wife, travelled to Scotland to meet Anne of Denmark, the incoming Queen, and &quot;the high-tempered beauty somehow pleased that withdrawn, strong-willed woman ... for as long as Anna lived ... Lady Hatton and her husband would retain the queen&#x27;s affection and trust&quot;. Coke attended divine service with the new king on 22 May, who, following the service, took a sword from his bodyguard and knighted Coke. Coke was reconfirmed as Attorney General under James, and immediately found himself dealing with &quot;a series of treasons, whether real or imaginary&quot;. The first of these was the trial of Sir Walter Raleigh; according to Cuthbert William Johnson, one of Coke&#x27;s biographers, &quot;There is, perhaps, no reported case in which the proofs against the prisoner were weaker than in this trial ... never was an accused person condemned on slighter grounds&quot;.

Raleigh was brought to trial on 17 November 1603, on charges of &quot;conspiring to deprive the King of his Government; to alter religion; to bring in the Roman superstition; and to procure foreign enemies to invade the kingdom&quot;. The government alleged that on 11 June 1603, Raleigh had met with Lord Cobham, and they had agreed to bring Lady Arbella Stuart (a great great granddaughter of Henry VII) to the English throne, and to accept 600,000 marks from the Spanish government. As such, Raleigh was charged with supporting Stuart&#x27;s claim to the throne and claiming Spanish money. He pleaded not guilty, with Coke&#x27;s only evidence being a confession from Cobham, who was described as &quot;a weak and unprincipled creature ... who said one thing at one time, and another thing in another, and could be relied upon in nothing&quot;. This case was &quot;no case at all ... It supports the general charges in the indictment only by the vaguest possible reference to &#x27;these practices,&#x27; and &#x27;plots and invasions&#x27; of which no more is said&quot;.

Coke&#x27;s behaviour during the trial has been repeatedly criticised; on this weak evidence, he called Raleigh a &quot;notorious traitor&quot;, &quot;vile viper&quot; and &quot;damnable atheist&quot;, perverting the law and using every slip of the tongue as a way of further showing Raleigh&#x27;s guilt. Raleigh was found guilty and imprisoned in the Tower of London for more than a decade before finally being executed. It is generally concluded that the trial was biased strongly against Raleigh, although the assessment of Coke varies. While Magruder, in the &quot;Scottish Law Review&quot;, writes that Coke&#x27;s &quot;fair fame was tarnished and outraged&quot; by his part in the trial, Boyer notes that Coke was, above all, loyal. He prosecuted Raleigh in that fashion because he had been asked to show Raleigh&#x27;s guilt by the king, and as Attorney General, Coke was bound to obey.

The next significant government prosecution was the trial of the eight main Gunpowder Plot conspirators in Westminster Hall. The men were indicted on 27 January 1605 and tried by the Lords Commissioners. Coke conducted the prosecution for the government – an easy one, since the conspirators had no legal representation – and through his speeches, &quot;blacken[ed] them in the eyes of the world&quot;. The conspirators were all sentenced to death and died through various means. Due to his judicial appointment, this was the last important prosecution Coke participated in.

In 1606 Coke reported the Star Chamber case &quot;De Libellis Famosis,&quot; which ruled that truth was not a defence against an accusation of seditious libel, and also held that ordinary common law courts could enforce this, a doctrine which thus outlived the Star Chamber after its abolition in 1642.

==Judicial work==
Coke&#x27;s first judicial postings came under Elizabeth; in 1585, he was made Recorder of Coventry, in 1587 Norwich, and in 1592 Recorder of London, a position he resigned upon his appointment as Solicitor General.

===Common Pleas===
On 20 June 1606, Coke was made a Serjeant-at-Law, a requirement for his elevation to Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, which occurred on 30 June. His conduct was noted by Johnson as &quot;from the first, excellent; ever perfectly upright and fearlessly independent&quot;, although the convention of the day was that the judges held their positions only at the pleasure of the monarch. A biographer of Francis Bacon noted that &quot;[t]he most offensive of Attorney Generals[sic] transformed into the most admired and venerated of Judges&quot;. Some assert that Coke became Chief Justice due to his prosecutions of Raleigh and the Gunpowder Plot conspirators, but there is no evidence to support this; instead, it was traditional at the time that a retiring Chief Justice would be replaced with the Attorney General.

====Court of High Commission====
Coke&#x27;s changed position from Attorney General to Chief Justice allowed him to openly attack organisations he had previously supported. His first target was the Court of High Commission, an ecclesiastical court established by the monarch with nearly unlimited power; it administered a mandatory &quot;ex officio&quot; oath that deliberately trapped people. The High Commission was vastly unpopular among both common lawyers and Members of Parliament, as the idea of &quot;prerogative law&quot; challenged both authorities. The appointment of Richard Bancroft as Archbishop of Canterbury in 1604 caused the issue to grow in importance; according to P.B. Waite, a Canadian historian, Bancroft&#x27;s zeal and strictness &quot;could hardly fail to produce an atmosphere in which principles and issues would crystallize, in which logic would supplant reasonableness&quot;. The judges, particularly Coke, began to unite with Parliament in challenging the High Commission. In 1607 Parliament openly asked for Coke&#x27;s opinion on the High Commission&#x27;s practices; he replied that &quot;No man ecclesiastical or temporal shall be examined upon secret thoughts of his heart or of his secret opinion&quot;.

During this period a &quot;notorious suit&quot; ran through the courts, known as &quot;Fuller&#x27;s Case&quot; after the defendant, Nicholas Fuller. A barrister, Fuller had several clients fined by the High Commission for non-conformity, and stated that the High Commission&#x27;s procedure was &quot;popish, under jurisdiction not of Christ but of anti-Christ&quot;. For this, Fuller was held in custody for contempt of court. The Court of King&#x27;s Bench argued that this was a lay matter, while the High Commission claimed it fell under their jurisdiction. Coke had no official role, other than acting as a mediator between the two, but in the end, Fuller was convicted by the High Commission. This was a defeat for the common law, and in response, Coke spent the summer issuing writs of prohibition to again challenge Bancroft and the High Commission. On 6 November 1608, the common law judges and members of the High Commission were summoned before the king and told that they would argue and allow him to decide. Finding themselves unable to even argue coherently, instead &quot;[standing] sullen, merely denying each others&#x27; statements&quot;, the group was dismissed and reconvened a week later. Coke, speaking for the judges, argued that the jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical courts was limited to cases where no temporal matters were involved and the rest left to the common law.

At this point, the King&#x27;s own position in relation to the law, and his authority to decide this matter, was brought up, in what became known as the &quot;Case of Prohibitions&quot;. James stated that &quot;In cases where there is no express authority in law, the King may himself decide in his royal person; the Judges are but delegates of the King&quot;. Coke challenged this, saying &quot;the King in his own person cannot adjudge any case, either criminal – as treason, felony etc, or betwixt party and party; but this ought to be determined and adjudged in some court of justice, according to the Law and Custom of England&quot;. Coke further stated that &quot;The common law protecteth the King&quot;, to which James replied &quot;The King protecteth the law, and not the law the King! The King maketh judges and bishops. If the judges interpret the laws themselves and suffer none else to interpret, they may easily make, of the laws, shipmen&#x27;s hose!&quot;. Coke rejected this, stating that while the monarch was not subject to any individual, he was subject to the law. Until he had gained sufficient knowledge of the law, he had no right to interpret it; he pointed out that such knowledge &quot;demanded mastery of an artificial reason ... which requires long study and experience, before that a man can attain to the cognizance of it&quot;. Coke was only saved from imprisonment by Cecil, who pleaded with the King to show leniency, which he granted. After the conclusion of this dispute, Coke freely left, and continued to issue writs of prohibition against the High Commission.

====&quot;Dr. Bonham&#x27;s Case&quot;====

&quot;Thomas Bonham v College of Physicians&quot;, commonly known as &quot;Dr. Bonham&#x27;s Case&quot; was a decision of the Court of Common Pleas under Coke in which he ruled that

Coke&#x27;s meaning has been disputed over the years; some interpret his judgment as referring to judicial review of statutes to correct misunderstandings which would render them unfair, while others argue he meant that the common law courts have the power to completely strike down those statutes they deem to be repugnant.

Whatever Coke&#x27;s meaning, after an initial period of application, &quot;Bonham&#x27;s Case&quot; was thrown aside in favour of the growing doctrine of Parliamentary sovereignty. Initially written down by William Blackstone, this theory makes Parliament the sovereign law-maker, preventing the common law courts from not only throwing aside but also reviewing statutes in the fashion Coke suggested. Parliamentary sovereignty is now the universally-accepted judicial doctrine in England and Wales. &quot;Bonham&#x27;s Case&quot; met a mixed reaction at the time, with the King and Lord Ellesmere both deeply unhappy with it. Nineteenth and twentieth-century academics are scarcely more favourable, calling it &quot;a foolish doctrine alleged to have been laid down extra-judicially&quot;, and an &quot;abortion&quot;.

In the United States, Coke&#x27;s decision met with a better reaction. During the legal and public campaigns against the writs of assistance and Stamp Act 1765, &quot;Bonham&#x27;s Case&quot; was given as a justification for nullifying the legislation. &quot;Marbury v. Madison&quot;, the American case which forms the basis for the exercise of judicial review in the United States under Article III of the Constitution, uses the words &quot;void&quot; and &quot;repugnant&quot;, seen as a direct reference to Coke. Some academics, such as Edward Samuel Corwin, have argued that Coke&#x27;s work in &quot;Bonham&#x27;s Case&quot; forms the basis of judicial review and the declaration of legislation as unconstitutional in the United States. Gary L. McDowell calls this &quot;one of the most enduring myths of American constitutional law and theory, to say nothing of history&quot;, pointing out that at no point during the Constitutional Convention was &quot;Bonham&#x27;s Case&quot; referenced.

===King&#x27;s Bench===
Coke was transferred from the Common Pleas, where he was succeeded by Hobart, to the Court of King&#x27;s Bench on 25 October 1613, on the advice of Bacon, presumably because Bacon and the King felt that if he was moved from a court dedicated to protecting the rights of the people to one dedicated to the rights of the King, &quot;his capacity for harm would be diminished&quot;. From Bacon&#x27;s point of view, the King&#x27;s Bench was a far more precarious position for someone loyal to the common law rather than the monarch. Coke&#x27;s first case of note there was &quot;Peacham&#x27;s Case&quot;, in which he dictated that the writing of a sermon by the Puritan clergyman Edmund Peacham which advocated the death of the king – a sermon which was never preached or published – could not constitute treason. The King was unwilling to accept this decision and instead had him tried by Coke&#x27;s opponents on the bench, who &quot;not surprisingly&quot; found him guilty, although his life was spared. Refusing to admit his guilt, Peacham was tortured on the rack, but &quot;before torture, between torture and after torture; nothing could be drawn from him&quot;.

In 1616, two years after &quot;Peacham&#x27;s Case&quot;, the case of &quot;commendams&quot; arose. The &quot;in commendam&quot; writ was a method of transferring ecclesiastical property, which James used in this case to allow Richard Neile to hold his bishopric and associated revenues without actually performing the duties. On 25 April 1616 the courts, at Coke&#x27;s bidding, held that this action was illegal, writing to the king that &quot;in case any letters come unto us contrary to law, we do nothing by such letters, but certify your Majesty thereof, and go forth to do the law notwithstanding the same&quot;. James called the judges before him and, furious, ripped up the letter, telling them that &quot;I well know the true and ancient common law to be the most favourable to Kings of any law in the world, to which law I do advise you my Judges to apply your studies&quot;. While all the other judges &quot;succumbed to royal pressure and, throwing themselves on their knees, prayed for pardon&quot;, Coke defended the letter and stated that &quot;When the case happens I shall do that which shall be fit for a judge to do&quot;.

This was the last straw; on advice from Bacon, who had long been jealous of Coke, James I suspended Coke from the Privy Council, forbade him from going on circuit and, on 14 November, dismissed him from his post as Chief Justice of the King&#x27;s Bench. This was greeted by deep resentment in the country, which saw the King&#x27;s actions as tampering with justice. Coke himself reacted by sinking into a deep depression. James I then ordered Coke to spend his time &quot;expunging and retracting such novelties and errors and offensive conceits as are dispersed in his &quot;Reports&quot;&quot;. Bacon, now in royal favour, became Lord Chancellor on 3 March 1617 and set up a commission to purge the &quot;Reports&quot;, also using his authority to expand the powers of the High Commission. With James unable to declare Coke incompetent, some of what Humphry William Woolrych describes as &quot;colourable excuses&quot; were produced to justify Coke&#x27;s dismissal; he was accused of concealing £12,000, uttering &quot;high words of contempt&quot; as a judge, and declaring himself Chief Justice of England.

==Return to politics==
Now out of favour and with no chance of returning to the judiciary, Coke was re-elected to Parliament as an MP, ironically by order of the King, who expected Coke to support his efforts. Elected in 1620, Coke sat for Liskeard in the 1621 Parliament, which was called by the King to raise revenues; other topics of discussion included a proposed marriage between the Prince of Wales and Maria Anna of Spain, and possible military support for the King&#x27;s son-in-law, Frederick V, Elector Palatine. Coke became a leading opposition MP, along with Robert Phelips, Thomas Wentworth and John Pym, campaigning against any military intervention and the marriage of the Prince of Wales and Maria Anna. His position at the head of the opposition was unsurprising given his extensive experience in both local and central government, as well as his ability to speak with authority on matters of economics, parliamentary procedure and the law. He subsequently sat as MP for Coventry (1624), Norfolk (1625) and Buckinghamshire (1628).

In June 1614, the University of Cambridge by unanimous vote elected Coke High Steward, an honorary office immediately below Chancellor of the University. Through Cecil, (previously High Steward and then Chancellor of Cambridge), Coke had procured for the university the right to send its own two representatives to Parliament, a matter of much practical benefit. A fervent Cantabrigian, Coke had a habit of naming Cambridge first, including in Parliament. When reminded that precedence belonged to Oxford &quot;by vote of the House&quot;, Coke persisted in giving Cambridge primacy. A Privy Councilor, Sir Thomas Edmondes, interrupted with a rebuke. It was reported that Coke suggested Edmondes not bother worrying about the primacy of Oxford or Cambridge, given that he had not attended either university.

===Monopolies===
Coke used his role in Parliament as a leading opposition MP to attack patents, a system he had already criticised as a judge. Historically, English patent law was based on custom and the common law, not on statute. It began as the Crown granted patents as a form of economic protection to ensure high industrial production. As gifts from the Crown, there was no judicial review, oversight or consideration, and no actual law concerning patents. To boost England&#x27;s economy, Edward II began encouraging foreign workmen and inventors to settle in England, offering letters of protection that protected them from guild policy on the condition that they train English apprentices and pass on their knowledge. The letters did not grant a full monopoly; rather they acted as a passport, allowing foreign workers to travel to England and practice their trade. This process continued for three centuries, with formal procedures set out in 1561 to issue letters patent to any new industry, allowing monopolies. The granting of these patents was highly popular with the monarch because of the potential for raising revenue; a patentee was expected to pay heavily for the patent, and unlike a tax raise (another method of raising Crown money) any public unrest as a result of the patent was normally directed at the patentee, not the monarch.

Over time, this system became more and more problematic; instead of temporary monopolies on specific, imported industries, long-term monopolies came about over more common commodities, including salt and starch. These monopolies led to a showdown between the Crown and Parliament, in which it was agreed in 1601 to turn the power to administer patents over to the common law courts; at the same time, Elizabeth revoked a number of the more restrictive and damaging monopolies. Even given a string of judicial decisions criticising and overruling such monopolies, James I, when he took the throne, continued using patents to create monopolies. Coke used his position in Parliament to attack these patents, which were, according to him, &quot;now grown like hydras&#x27; heads; they grow up as fast as they are cut off&quot;. Coke succeeded in establishing the Committee of Grievances, a body chaired by him that abolished a large number of monopolies. This was followed by a wave of protest at the patent system. On 27 March 1621, James suggested the House of Commons draw up a list of the three most objectionable patents, and he would remove them, but by this time a statute was already being prepared by Coke. After passing on 12 May it was thrown out by the House of Lords, but a Statute of Monopolies was finally passed by Parliament on 25 May 1624.

In response to both this and Coke&#x27;s establishment of a sub-committee to establish freedom of speech and discuss the rights of the Commons, James announced that &quot;you usurp upon our prerogative royal and meddle with things far above your reach&quot;. He first adjourned Parliament and then forbade the Commons from discussing &quot;matters of state at home or abroad&quot;. Ignoring this ban, Parliament issued a &quot;Remonstrance to the King&quot; on 11 December 1621, authored by Coke, in which they restated their liberties and right to discuss matters of state, claiming that such rights were the &quot;ancient and undoubted birthright and inheritance of the subjects of England&quot;. After a debate, it was sent to James, who rejected it; the Commons instead resolved to enter it into the &quot;Journal of the Commons&quot;, which required no royal authorisation. In the presence of Parliament, the king reacted by tearing the offending page from the &quot;Journal&quot;, declaring that it should be &quot;razed out of all memories and utterly annihilated&quot;, and then dissolved Parliament. Coke was then imprisoned in the Tower of London on 27 December, being released nine months later.

===Liberty and the &quot;Resolutions&quot;===
James died on 27 March 1625 and was succeeded by his son, who became Charles I of England. Coke was made High Sheriff of Buckinghamshire by the king in 1625, which prohibited him from sitting in Parliament until his term expired a year later. Following his father&#x27;s example, Charles raised loans without Parliament&#x27;s sanction and imprisoned without trial those who would not pay. The judges of the Court of Common Pleas and King&#x27;s Bench declared this to be illegal, and the Chief Justice Sir Ranulph Crewe was dismissed; at this, the remaining judges succumbed to the king&#x27;s pressure. More and more people refused to pay, leading to &quot;Darnell&#x27;s Case&quot;, in which the courts confirmed that &quot;if no cause was given for the detention ... the prisoner could not be freed as the offence was probably too dangerous for public discussion&quot;. The result of this was that wealthy landowners refused to pay the loan and the Crown&#x27;s income fell below Charles&#x27;s expectations, forcing him to call a fresh Parliament in March 1627. With popular anger at Charles&#x27;s policies, many MPs were opposed to him, including Pym, Coke and a young Oliver Cromwell.

Martial law was then declared, with continued imprisonment for a failure to pay the forced loans and soldiers billeted in the homes of private citizens to intimidate the population – something which led to Coke&#x27;s famous declaration that &quot;the house of an Englishman is to him as his castle&quot;. The Commons responded to these measures by insisting that Magna Carta, which expressly forbade the imprisonment of freemen without trial, was still valid. Coke then prepared the &quot;Resolutions&quot;, which later led to the Habeas Corpus Act 1679. These declared that Magna Carta was still in force, and that furthermore: In addition, no tax or loan could be levied without Parliament&#x27;s permission, and no private citizen could be forced into accepting soldiers into his home. Coke, John Selden and the rest of the Committee for Grievances presented the &quot;Resolutions&quot; to the House of Lords, with Coke citing seven statutes and 31 cases to support his argument. He told the Lords that &quot;Imprisonment in law is a civil death [and] a prison without a prefixed time is a kind of hell&quot;. The Lords, supportive of the king, were not swayed, and Charles himself eventually rejected the &quot;Resolutions&quot;, insisting that the Commons trust him.

===Petition of Right===

Coke undertook the central role in framing and writing the Petition of Right. The ongoing struggles over martial law and civil liberties, along with the rejection of the &quot;Resolutions&quot; seriously concerned the Commons. Accordingly, Coke convinced the Lords to meet with the Commons in April 1628 in order to discuss a petition to the King confirming the rights and liberties of royal subjects. The Commons immediately accepted this, and after a struggle, the Lords agreed to allow a committee chaired by Coke to draft the eventual document. Hearing of this, the King sent a message to Parliament forbidding the Commons from discussing matters of state. The resulting debate led to some MPs being unable to speak due to their fear that the King was threatening them with the destruction of Parliament. Coke, despite the fear in Parliament, stood and spoke, citing historical precedents supporting the principle that members of the Commons could, within Parliament, say whatever they wished – something now codified as Parliamentary privilege.

The Petition of Right was affirmed by the Commons and sent to the Lords, who approved it on 17 May 1628; the document&#x27;s publication was met with bonfires and the ringing of church bells throughout England. As well as laying out a long list of statutes which had been broken, it proclaimed various &quot;rights and liberties&quot; of free Englishmen, including freedom from taxation without Parliamentary approval, the right of &quot;habeas corpus&quot;, a prohibition on soldiers being billeted in houses without the owner&#x27;s will, and a prohibition on imposing martial law on civilians. It was later passed into formal law by the Long Parliament in 1641 and became one of the three constitutional documents of English civil liberties, along with Magna Carta and the Bill of Rights 1689.

==Retirement==
When Parliament was dissolved in 1629, Charles decided to govern without one, and Coke retired to his estate at Stoke Poges, Buckinghamshire, about 20 miles west of London, spending his time making revisions to his written works. He made no attempt to return to politics, stating that the Petition of Right would be left as his &quot;greatest inheritance&quot;; his desire to complete his writings, coupled with his advanced age, may also have been factors. Despite his age, Coke was still in good health, and exercised daily. Following an accident in which his horse fell on him, he refused to consult doctors, saying that he had &quot;a disease which all the drugs of Asia, the gold of Africa, nor all the doctors of Europe could cure – old age&quot;, and instead chose to remain confined to the house without medical treatment. As he was on his deathbed the Privy Council ordered that his house and chambers be searched, seizing 50 manuscripts, which were later restored; his will was permanently lost.

Coke died on 3 September 1634, aged 82, and lay in state for a month at his home in Godwick to allow for friends and relatives to view the body. He remained a lifelong Anglican and was buried in St Mary&#x27;s Church, Tittleshall, Norfolk. His grave is covered by a marble monument with his effigy lying on it in full judicial robes, surrounded by eight shields holding his coat of arms. A Latin inscription on the monument identifies him as &quot;Father of twelve children and thirteen books&quot;. A second inscription, in English, gives a brief chronicle of his life and ends by stating that &quot;His laste wordes [were] thy kingdome come, thye will be done. Learne, reader to live so, that thou may&#x27;st so die&quot;. Coke&#x27;s estates passed to his son Henry.

==Personal life==


On 13 August 1582 Coke married Bridget, the daughter of John Paston, a Counsellor from Norwich. Paston came from a long line of lawyers and judges – his great grandfather, William Paston, was a Justice of the Court of Common Pleas. Having grown up nearby, Coke knew the family and asked for Bridget&#x27;s hand immediately after she turned eighteen. At the time he was a thirty-one-year-old barrister with a strong practice, and her father had no qualms about accepting his offer. Six months after they married John Paston died, leaving his daughter and son-in-law his entire estate and several of his clients. Bridget maintained a diary, which reveals that she mainly ran the household. Despite this she was an independent woman, travelling without her husband and acting as a helpmate to Coke. Bridget was noted by Woolrych as an &quot;incomparable&quot; woman who had &quot;inestimable value clearly manifested by the eulogies which are lavished on her character&quot;. The couple settled at the manor of Huntingfield, described by Catherine Drinker Bowen as &quot;enchanting, with a legend for every turret ... A splendid gallery ran the length of the house, the Great Hall was built around six massive oaks which supported the roof as they grew&quot;.

The couple had ten children – seven sons and three daughters. The sons were Edward, Robert, Arthur, John, Henry, Clement and Thomas. Edward died young, Robert became a Knight Bachelor and married Theophila, daughter of Thomas Berkeley, Arthur married Elizabeth, heir of Sir George Walgrave, John married Meriel, daughter of Anthony Wheately, bringing Holkham Hall into the Coke family, Henry married Margaret, daughter of Richard Lovelace, and inherited the manor at Holkham from his brother John (who had seven daughters but no son), Clement married Sarah, heiress of Alexander Redich, and Thomas died as an infant. The daughters were Elizabeth, Anne and Bridget. Elizabeth died young, Anne married Ralph Sadleir, son and heir of Sir Thomas Sadleir, and Bridget married William Skinner, son and heir of Sir Vincent Skinner. Coke&#x27;s descendants through Henry include the Earls of Leicester, particularly Coke of Norfolk, a landowner, Member of Parliament and agricultural reformer. Ironically in view of Coke&#x27;s legal opposition to James I, a descendant of both Coke and James is Sarah, Duchess of York.

Following his first wife&#x27;s death in 1598, Coke married Elizabeth Hatton, a desirable marriage due to her wealth; when he found out that Bacon was also pursuing her hand, Coke acted with all speed to complete the ceremony. It was held at a private house at the wrong time, rather than at a church between 8 and 12 in the morning; all involved parties were prosecuted for breaching ecclesiastical law, and Coke had to beg for a pardon. It is said that Coke first suggested marrying Hatton to Sir Robert Cecil, Hatton&#x27;s uncle, at the funeral of Lord Burghley, Coke&#x27;s patron; he needed to ensure that he would continue his rise under Burghley&#x27;s son, Cecil, and did this by marrying into the family. Hatton was 26  years younger than Coke, hot-tempered and articulate; Boyer wrote that &quot;if she and Coke were not compatible, at least they were well-matched&quot;. Their marriage having broken down in 1604, Hatton went on to become a formidable antagonist and thorn in his side. At his funeral she remarked, &quot;We shall never see his like again, thanks be to God&quot;.

In 1602 he bought Minster Lovell, an Oxfordshire 15th-century manor house which had previously belonged to the Lovell family before it was forfeited to the state in 1485.

Coke was buried beside his first wife, who was called his &quot;first and best wife&quot; by his daughter Anne; his second wife died in 1646. Coke had two children with his second wife, both daughters: Elizabeth and Frances Coke, Viscountess Purbeck. Elizabeth married Sir Maurice Berkeley. Frances married John Villiers, 1st Viscount Purbeck, but left him soon afterwards for her lover Sir Robert Howard, with whom she lived for many years, to the great scandal of the Court.

Of Coke&#x27;s many children, the one who came at the last in his final years of life to manage his house at Stoke Poges and watch over him was ironically his youngest child, Frances Villiers. After Coke&#x27;s dismissal as Chief Justice of the King&#x27;s Bench, in an attempt to ingratiate himself with King James and his favourite, the Duke of Buckingham, Coke devised a plan to marry off his youngest daughter Frances to Buckingham&#x27;s infirm older brother, Sir John Villiers. By transferring a marriage payment of £10,000 and other properties to Sir John Villiers, control of the funds would reside in the hands of Buckingham. This would lessen the pressure on the king to provide funds to his favourite. Sir John Villiers was an undesirable match for someone as beautiful and vibrant as Frances Coke. Frances and her mother, Lady Hatton, were determined to oppose the marriage. Lady Hatton, through a forged letter, claimed that Frances was promised to Henry de Vere, 18th Earl of Oxford, but the ploy was unsuccessful. To further thwart Coke&#x27;s attempt, Frances and her mother, Lady Hatton, fled and hid in Sir Edmund Withipole&#x27;s home. After searching many properties, Coke eventually found them there. With a band of ten retainers including his son Clem, the party crashed through the front door of Sir Withipole&#x27;s house using a heavy piece of timber and found Frances and Lady Hatton upstairs. As Sir Edward dragged them apart, he commanded his daughter, &quot;You will come home with me to Stoke&quot;. Frances was placed on a horse with her half-brother Clem and they raced away with Lady Hatton and her family members in hot pursuit. However, the muddy road conditions prevented Lady Hatton from rescuing her daughter. After a failed petition to the King by Lady Hatton through her friend (and Coke&#x27;s arch-enemy) Sir Francis Bacon, in which Frances&#x27; dowry played an important role in securing the king&#x27;s permission for the marriage to proceed as arranged by the bride&#x27;s father, Frances was married off to Villiers against her will. Nevertheless, despite this tragic relationship trauma between father and daughter, Coke and his daughter eventually reconciled. Coke&#x27;s final years with Frances devotedly by his side were very happy and peaceful ones for them both.

==Writings==
Coke is best known for his written work – thirteen volumes of law reports, and the four-volume &quot;Institutes of the Lawes of England&quot;. John Marshall Gest, writing in the &quot;Yale Law Journal&quot; at the start of the twentieth century, noted that &quot;There are few principles of the common law that can be studied without an examination of Coke&#x27;s &quot;Institutes&quot; and &quot;Reports&quot; which summed up the legal learning of his time&quot;, although &quot;the student is deterred by the too common abuse of Coke&#x27;s character and the general criticism of his writings as dry, crabbed, verbose and pedantic&quot;. John Campbell, in &quot;The Lives of the Chief Justices of England&quot;, had said that &quot;His reasoning... is narrow minded; [he had] utter contempt for method and style in his compositions&quot;, and says that Coke&#x27;s &quot;Reports&quot; were &quot;tinctured with quaintness and pedantry&quot;. Gest, noting this criticism, points out that: 

===&quot;Reports&quot;===
His &quot;Law Reports&quot;, known as &quot;Coke&#x27;s Reports&quot;, were an archive of judgments from cases he had attended, in which he had participated or about which he had been informed. They started with notes he made as a law student in the winter of 1572, with full reporting of cases from October 1579. The &quot;Reports&quot; were initially written down in seven notebooks, four of which are lost; the first notebook contains not only law reports, but also a draft version of Coke&#x27;s first &quot;Institutes of the Lawes of England&quot;. Coke began reporting cases in the traditional manner, by copying out and repeating cases found in earlier law reports, such as those of Edmund Plowden. After being called to the Bar in 1578 he began attending court cases at Westminster Hall, and soon drew the attention of court officials – many early reports have noted that he was told &quot;by old Plowden&quot; or &quot;by Wray CJ&quot;. The original reports were kept in a generally chronological order, interspersed with personal memos, obituaries and notes on court practices. They are not entirely chronological; during his career, Coke took note of earlier cases which had drawn his attention. These were written down with the plea roll reference and the year in which Coke recorded them, but later editions failed to include the plea roll reference and led to inaccuracies.

The &quot;Reports&quot; have gained significant academic acclaim; writing in the &quot;Cornell Law Quarterly, &quot;Theodore Plucknett describes them as works of &quot;incomparable richness&quot; with a &quot;profound influence upon the literature, and indeed the substance, of English law&quot;. John Baker has described them as &quot;perhaps the single most influential series of named reports&quot;, and even Francis Bacon, Coke&#x27;s rival, wrote in praise of them, saying &quot;Had it not been for Sir Edward Coke&#x27;s Reports (which though they may have errors, and some peremptory and extrajudicial resolutions more than are warranted, yet they contain infinite good decisions and rulings over of cases), for the law by this time had been almost like a ship without ballast; for that the cases of modern experience are fled from those that are adjudged and ruled in former time&quot;.

Although loaned to friends and family, and therefore in slight public circulation, Coke&#x27;s &quot;Reports&quot; were never formally used during his lifetime. Select cases were published in 1600, containing the most famous of his decisions and pleadings, while the second volume in 1602 was more chronological in nature. The third part, published in the same year, was also chronological, while the fourth, published in 1604, was arranged by subject. The fifth part, published in 1605, is arranged similarly, as is the sixth, published in 1607. Five more volumes were published until 1615, but Coke died before he could publish a single-bound copy. No trace has been found of the draft manuscript.

Some academics have questioned the accuracy of the &quot;Reports&quot;. Coke&#x27;s famous &quot;Case of Proclamations&quot;, and his speech there, was first brought into the public consciousness through its inclusion in Volume 12 of his &quot;Reports&quot;, and Roland G. Usher, writing in the &quot;English Historical Review&quot;, notes that &quot;Certain manuscripts at Hatfield House and elsewhere seem to throw some doubt upon this famous account of a famous interview&quot;. One of the reasons given for possible inaccuracies in the later volumes of the &quot;Reports&quot; is that they were published posthumously. In July 1634, officials acting on the order of the King had seized Coke&#x27;s papers, but a 1641 motion in the House of Commons restored the extant papers to Coke&#x27;s eldest son. The twelfth and thirteenth volumes of the reports were based on fragments of notes several decades old, not on Coke&#x27;s original manuscript.

===&quot;Institutes&quot;===
Coke&#x27;s other main work was the &quot;Institutes of the Lawes of England&quot;, a four-volume treatise described as his &quot;masterwork&quot;. The first volume, the &quot;Commentary upon Littleton&quot;, known as &quot;Coke on Littleton&quot;, was published in 1628. It is ostensibly a commentary on Sir Thomas Littleton&#x27;s &quot;Treatise on Tenures&quot;, but actually covered many areas of the law of his time. The other three volumes were all published after his death, and covered 39 constitutional statutes of importance (starting with Magna Carta), the law relating to criminal law, and constitutional and administrative law, respectively. While the &quot;Reports&quot; were intended to give an explanation of the law chronologically, Coke&#x27;s purpose was to provide an English language tutorial for students studying law at the Inns of Court. This served as an alternative to the Roman law lectures at university, which were based on Latin; according to Bowen, it was &quot;a double vision; the &quot;Institutes&quot; as authority, the &quot;Reports&quot; as illustration by actual practise&quot;.

Part one, the &quot;Commentary upon Littleton&quot;, was undoubtedly the most famous; copies were exported to the United States early in the colonial era. The work was first printed in an American edition in 1812, by which point the English version was in its sixteenth edition, and had been commented on itself by various later legal authorities. As with the &quot;Reports&quot;, Coke&#x27;s &quot;Institutes&quot; became a standard textbook in the United States, and was recorded in the law libraries of Harvard College in 1723 and Brown University in 1770; John Jay, John Adams, Theophilus Parsons and Thomas Jefferson were all influenced by it. John Rutledge later wrote that &quot;Coke&#x27;s &quot;Institutes&quot; seems to be almost the foundations of our law&quot;, while Jefferson stated that &quot;a sounder Whig never wrote more profound learning in the orthodox doctrine of British liberties&quot;. The &quot;Third Institutes&quot; has been described as &quot;the first really adequate discussion of treason, a work which went far towards offering the remedy of a humanized common law to the injustices of trial procedures&quot;.

The work had its detractors, with some writers criticising it for &quot;repulsive pedantry&quot; and &quot;overbearing assertions&quot;, as well as incorrect citations to works that were later discredited. There are also factual inaccuracies; Kenyon Homfray in the &quot;Ecclesiastical Law Journal&quot; notes that, despite being considered the supreme legal authority on the subject of consecration, which Coke covered in the third volume of the &quot;Institutes&quot;, he offered no legal support for his opinion and ignored those pieces of case law which rejected his interpretation.

===Jurisprudence===
Coke&#x27;s jurisprudence centres on the hierarchy of the judges, the monarch, and Parliament in making law. Coke argued that the judges of the common law were those most suited to making law, followed by Parliament, and that the monarch was bound to follow any legal rules. This principle was justified by the idea that a judge, through his professional training, internalised what political historian and theorist Alan Cromartie referred to as &quot;an infinity of wisdom&quot;, something that mere politicians or laypersons could not understand due to the complexity of the law. Coke&#x27;s &quot;Commentary on Littleton&quot; has been interpreted as deliberately obtuse, with his aim being to write what Cromartie called &quot;a sort of anti-textbook, a work whose very form denied that legal knowledge could be organised. The original edition could not be used for reference purposes, as Coke had published it without an index ... It is a book to be &#x27;read in&#x27; and lived with, rather than consulted, a monument to the uselessness of merely written knowledge unless it is internalised in a trained professional mind&quot;. This theory – that judges were the natural arbiters of the law – is known as the &quot;appeal to reason&quot;, with &quot;reason&quot; referring not to rationality but the method and logic used by judges in upholding and striking down laws. Coke&#x27;s position meant that certainty of the law and intellectual beauty was the way to see if a law was just and correct, and that the system of law could eventually become sophisticated enough to be predictable.

John Selden similarly thought that the common law was the proper law of England. He argued that this did not necessarily create judicial discretion to alter it, and that proper did not necessarily equal perfect. The law was nothing more than a contract made by the English people; this is known as the &quot;appeal to contract&quot;. Thomas Hobbes and Francis Bacon argued against Coke&#x27;s theory. They were proponents of natural law, created by the King&#x27;s authority, not by any individual judge. Hobbes felt that there was no skill unique to lawyers, and that the law could be understood not through Coke&#x27;s &quot;reason&quot; (the method used by lawyers), but through understanding the King&#x27;s instructions. While judges did make law, this was only valid because it was &quot;tacitly confirmed (because not disapproved) by the [King]&quot;.

==Legacy==
Coke&#x27;s challenge to the ecclesiastical courts and their &quot;ex officio&quot; oath is seen as the origin of the right to silence. With his decision that common law courts could issue writs of prohibition against such oaths and his arguments that such oaths were contrary to the common law (as found in his &quot;Reports&quot; and &quot;Institutes&quot;), Coke &quot;dealt the crucial blow to the oath &quot;ex officio&quot; and to the High Commission&quot;. The case of John Lilburne later confirmed that not only was such an oath invalid, but that there was a right to silence, drawing from Coke&#x27;s decisions in reaching that conclusion. In the trial of Sir Roger Casement for treason in 1916, Coke&#x27;s assertion that treason is defined as &quot;giving aide and comfort to the King&#x27;s enemies within the realme or without&quot; was the deciding factor in finding him guilty. His work in &quot;Slade&#x27;s Case&quot; led to the rise of modern contract law, and his actions in the &quot;Case of Proclamations&quot; and the other pleadings which led to his eventual dismissal went some way towards securing judicial independence. The Statute of Monopolies, the foundation for which was laid by Coke and which was drafted by him, is considered one of the first steps towards the eventual English Civil War, and also &quot;one of the landmarks in the transition of [England&#x27;s] economy from the feudal to the capitalist&quot;. The legal precept that no one may enter a home unless by invitation, was established as common law in Coke’s &quot;Institutes&quot;. &quot;For a man&#x27;s house is his castle, et domus sua cuique est tutissimum refugium [and each man&#x27;s home is his safest refuge].&quot; It is the origin of the famous dictum, &quot;an Englishman’s home is his castle&quot;.

Coke was particularly influential in the United States both before and after the American War of Independence. During the legal and public campaigns against the writs of assistance and Stamp Act 1765, &quot;Bonham&#x27;s Case&quot; was given as a justification for nullifying the legislation, and in the income tax case of 1895, Joseph Hodges Choate used Coke&#x27;s argument that a tax upon the income of the property is a tax on the property itself to have the Supreme Court of the United States declare the Wilson–Gorman Tariff Act unconstitutional. This decision ultimately led to the passage of the Sixteenth Amendment. The castle doctrine originates from Coke&#x27;s statement in the &quot;Third Institutes&quot; that &quot;A man&#x27;s home is his castle – for where shall he be safe if it not be in his house?&quot;, which also profoundly influenced the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution; the Third Amendment, on the other hand, was influenced by the Petition of Right. Coke was also a strong influence on and mentor of Roger Williams, an English theologian who founded the Rhode Island colony in North America and was an early proponent of the doctrine of separation of church and state.

==Character==
Coke was noted as deriving great enjoyment from and working hard at the law, but enjoying little else. He was versed in the Latin classics and maintained a sizeable estate, but the law was his primary concern. Francis Bacon, his main competitor, was known as a philosopher and man of learning, but Coke had no interest in such subjects. Notably, when given a copy of the &quot;Novum Organum&quot; by Bacon, Coke wrote puerile insults in it.

Coke&#x27;s style and attitude as a barrister are well documented. He was regarded, even during his life, as the greatest lawyer of his time in both reputation and monetary success. He was eloquent, effective, forceful, and occasionally overbearing. His most famous arguments can be read in Complete State Trials Volume I and II. Most early lawyers were not noted for their eloquence, with Thomas Elyot writing that &quot;[they] lacked elocution and pronunciation, two of the principal parts of rhetorike&quot;, and Roger Ascham saying that &quot;they do best when they cry loudest&quot;, describing a court case where an advocate was &quot;roaring like a bull&quot;. In court, Coke was insulting to the parties, disrespectful to the judges and &quot;rough, blustering, overbearing&quot;; a rival once wrote to him saying &quot;in your pleadings you were wont to insult over misery and to inveigh bitterly at the persons, which bred you many enemies&quot;. Coke was pedantic and technical, something which saw him win many cases as a barrister, but when he became Attorney General &quot;he showed the same qualities in a less pleasing form ... He was determined to get a conviction by every means in his power&quot;.

Francis Watt, writing in the &quot;Juridical Review&quot;, portrays this as Coke&#x27;s strongest characteristic as a lawyer: that he was a man who &quot;having once taken up a point or become engaged in a case, believes in it with all his heart and soul, whilst all the time conscious of its weakness, as well as ready to resort to every device to bolster it up&quot;. Writers have struggled to reconcile his achievements as a judge surrounding the rejection of executive power and the rights of man with his tenure as Attorney General, with Gerald P. Bodet noting that his early career as a state prosecutor was one of &quot;arrogance and brutality&quot;.

Coke made a fortune from purchasing estates with clouded titles at a discount, whereupon, through his knowledge of the intricacies of property law, he would clear the titles on the acquired properties to his favour. About the year 1615, his amassed property acquisitions attracted the attention of the government. James I claimed that Coke &quot;had already as much land as it was proper a subject should possess&quot;. The story goes that Coke requested the King&#x27;s permission to just &quot;add one acre more&quot; to his holdings, and upon approval proceeded to purchase the fine estate of Castle Acre Priory in Norfolk, one of the most expensive &quot;acres&quot; in the land.

Coke&#x27;s final words were &quot;Thy kingdome come, thye will be done&quot;.

<text>Pyrochlore () is a mineral group of the niobium end member of the pyrochlore supergroup. Pyrochlore is also a term for the crystal structure &quot;F&quot;dm. The name is from the Greek , &quot;fire&quot;, and , &quot;green&quot; because it typically turns green on ignition in classic blowpipe analysis.

== Mineral ==
The general formula, (where A and B are metals), represent a family of phases isostructural to the mineral pyrochlore. Pyrochlores are an important class of materials in diverse technological applications such as luminescence, ionic conductivity, nuclear waste immobilization, high-temperature thermal barrier coatings, automobile exhaust gas control, catalysts, solid oxide fuel cell, ionic/electrical conductors etc.

The mineral is associated with the metasomatic end stages of magmatic intrusions. Pyrochlore crystals are usually well-formed (euhedral), occurring usually as octahedra of a yellowish or brownish color and resinous luster. It is commonly metamict due to radiation damage from included radioactive elements.

Pyrochlore occurs in pegmatites associated with nepheline syenites and other alkalic rocks. It is also found in granite pegmatites and greisens. It is characteristically found in carbonatites. Associated minerals include zircon, aegirine, apatite, perovskite and columbite.

=== History ===
It was first described in 1826 for an occurrence in Stavern (Fredriksvärn), Larvik, Vestfold, Norway.

=== Niobium mining ===
The three largest producers of niobium ore are mining pyrochlore deposits. The largest deposit in Brazil is the CBMM mine located south of Araxá, Minas Gerais, followed by the deposit of the Catalão mine east of Catalão, Goiás. The third largest deposit of niobium ore is Niobec mine west of Saint-Honoré near Chicoutimi, Quebec.

Pyrochlore ore typically contains greater than 0.05% of naturally occurring radioactive uranium and thorium.

Lueshe in North Kivu, Democratic Republic of Congo, has substantial deposits of pyrochlore.

==Crystal structure==
The more general crystal structure describes materials of the type A2B2O6 and A2B2O7 where the A and B species are generally rare-earth or transition metal species; e.g. Y2Ti2O7.The pyrochlore structure is a super structure derivative of the simple fluorite structure (AO2 = A4O8), where the A and B cations are ordered along the direction. The additional anion vacancy resides in the tetrahedral interstice between adjacent B-site cations. These systems are particularly susceptible to geometrical frustration and novel magnetic effects.

The pyrochlore structure shows varied physical properties spanning electronic insulators (e.g. La2Zr2O7), ionic conductors (Gd1.9Ca0.1Ti2O6.9), metallic conductors (Bi2Ru2O7−&quot;y&quot;), mixed ionic and electronic conductors, spin ice systems (Dy2Ti2O7), spin glass systems (Y2Mo2O7), haldane chain systems (Tl2Ru2O7) and superconducting materials (Cd2Re2O7). More disordered structures, such as the bismuth pyrochlores, have also been investigated due to interesting high-frequency dielectric properties.

The crystal structure has been investigated for use in solid electrolytes for lithium iron batteries. It is alleged to provide high conductivity while inhibiting dendrite growth.

<doc id="151481" wikidata="Q899841" url="?curid=151481" title="Columbite">
<text>Columbite, also called niobite, niobite-tantalite and columbate, with a general chemical formula of , is a black mineral group that is an ore of niobium. It has a submetallic luster, a high density, and is a niobate of iron and manganese. Niobite has many applications in areospace, construction and the medical industry. Dating columbite minerals is primarily completed by uranium lead (U-Pb) dating, a slow process. 

Columbite has the same composition and crystal symmetry (orthorhombic) as tantalite. In fact, the two are often grouped together as a semi-singular mineral series called columbite-tantalite or coltan in many mineral guides. However, tantalite has a much greater specific gravity than columbite, more than 8.0 compared to columbite&#x27;s 5.2. The formation of columbite depends on the concentrations of metals present that affect the crystalline structure of the mineral and the environmental impact.

Columbite is a polymorph of tapiolite; they have the same chemical composition but different crystal symmetry: orthorhombic for columbite and tetragonal for tapiolite. The largest documented single crystal of columbite consisted of plates thick measuring .

Columbite contains varying amounts of thorium and uranium, making it radioactive. Coltan, a tantalum dominate species of columbite, is often mined by artisan and small scale miners with risks to the environment and human health due to unregulated working conditions.

== History and etymology ==
This mineral group was first found in Haddam, Connecticut, in the United States. The occurrence of columbite in the United States was made known on April 13, 1905, through the publication of research into the composition of an older specimen, presumably stemming from John Winthrop (1606–1676), first Governor of the Connecticut Colony and avid mineral collector. Amidst 600 other samples, the relevant specimen had been donated by the Governor&#x27;s namesake and grandson, John Winthrop (1681–1747) to Hans Sloane, President of the Royal Society of London, upon Winthrop&#x27;s becoming a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1737.

In 1801, Charles Hatchett had discovered the element niobium in the same specimen, which he had named columbium in honour of explorer Christopher Columbus.

== Columbite species ==

Columbite forms opaque crystals that are black to dark brown in colour. The formation of the crystals vary based on the species present.

Columbite forms a series with the tantalum-dominant analogue ferrotantalite and the manganese-dominant analogue manganocolumbite. Manganocolumbite has a chemical formula of (Mn, Fe)(Nb, Ta)2O6, often with small concentrations of tantalum and iron. Manganocolumbite is often found in pegmatites, course-grained igneous rocks.

The iron-rich member of the columbite group is ferrocolumbite, FeNb2O6, and small concentrations of tin and tungsten may be present. This species of columbite is often found in pegmatites as course-grained igneous rocks.

Yttrocolumbite is the yttrium-rich columbite with the formula , is a radioactive mineral found in Mozambique. This mineral forms due to pegmatites and rare-metal granites.

== Structure ==
Columbite atoms form an octahedral structure where niobium or tantalum atoms surround an oxygen atom. Overall, Columbite forms orthorhombic crystals which give approximate lengths of the crystal axes as a ≈ 14.27, b ≈ 5.73, and c ≈ 5.06 Å. Different columbite species such as manganocolumbite or ferrocolumbite can change the lengths of the crystal axes.

Since columbite can form species with other minerals, the physical properties of the mineral can change. When ferrocolumbite is introduced to heat, an equal expansion of the ‘a’ and ‘b’ axis occurs. In addition, due to the size of the ions and the overall structure, ferrocolumbite is more compressible than manganocolumbite. When manganocolumbite is introduced to heat, an expansion of the ‘a’ axis occurs resulting in an uneven change to the structure.

== Applications ==
When niobite is extracted from columbite, in the ore refining process, applications can be observed in the aerospace, construction, and medical industry. In the aerospace industry, super alloys can be created. Super alloys from niobite create a low mass, and high resistance material often used in spacecrafts. In construction, some high-strength low-alloy (HSLA) steel is created from niobite. In addition, niobite extracted from columbite can be used to create electronic components used in medical equipment such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).

== Formation ==
Columbite is often found in pegmatite and alluvial deposits, as well as granitic rocks. Columbite minerals are mainly composed of magnesium, iron, niobium, and tantalum where trace amounts of tin, titanium, and scandium have been observed. The overall composition of columbite influences the crystalline structure resulting in different formation processes. Currently, there are two prominent theories for the formation of columbite. One theory was developed due to a strong attraction of niobium and tantalum, within columbite, to silicate melts found in the earth&#x27;s crust or mantle. In addition, the presence of magma forms columbite by undergoing two crystallization processes. The first crystallization process creates a niobium core and the second crystallization process creates a tantalum rim. This theory is prominent due to the texture of the mineral during the fluid stage, and the magmatic fractional crystallization that occurs during formation. Another prominent theory of the formation of niobium and tantalum, in Columbite minerals, occurs due to hydrothermal fluids. This theory suggests that hydrothermal fluids interact with columbite during formation and as a result irregular crystals are formed.

It is possible that both theories work in conjunction with one another to form columbite minerals as well as different species of columbite such as mangancolumbite, ferrocolumbite, and yttrocolumbite.

== Environmental impact ==
Columbite minerals have the potential to be radioactive due to trace amounts of uranium and thorium. Radioactive minerals are unstable due to the emission of radiation which causes negative impacts to the environment and human health. Each country has different laws regarding the transportation of radioactive material.

When mining columbite, contamination of ground and surface water are a concern due to the presence of heavy metals in waste rock. In addition, waste rock can lead to acid mine drainage which can affect ground and surface water. To obtain pure columbite, a large quantity of waste rock is produced, leading to negative impacts to the surrounding environment.

During the extraction of niobite or tantalum from columbite, strong acids at high temperatures are used that have negative impacts to the environment. Hydrofluoric acid and sulfuric acid are used in the ore refining processes between temperatures of 250-300oC. These acids can cause soil acidification, air pollution, and water pollution that, in turn, affects ecosystems. Current technology, in the ore refining of columbite, is not selective which leads to impurities present in refined Columbite samples. To remove impurities, a greater concentration of acid is required, leading to a greater potential of environmental hazards.

== Dating ==
There are three applications to dating columbite group minerals each with advantages and disadvantages. These methods are uranium lead (U-Pb) dating, laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). The U-Pb method, can determine the location, and age of a columbite mineral group by the U/Pb ratio. This method is often paired with isotope dilution-thermal ionization mass spectrometry (ID-TIMS) to increase precision. The LA-ICP-MS method is used in situ to date columbite-tantalite minerals with less than five percent error on the isotopic ratio of uranium and lead. The SIMS method has a high spatial resolution and has a high accuracy in measuring lead isotopes in columbite minerals. The LA-ICP-MS and SIMS method are not commonly used due to the lack of certified reference material.

== Artisanal and small scale mining ==
Artisanal and small-scale mining provides jobs for millions of people but typically has negative impacts to human health and the environment. This type of mining is executed by small groups of people, typically under a larger mining cooperation, with simple extraction equipment. This simple extraction equipment can include pickaxes, shovels, basins, and minimal heavy machinery. Coltan, the tantalum dominant species of columbite, is often mined artisanally due to its vast applications in electronics. Artisanal and small-scale mining of materials are common in regions such as Africa, Asia, Oceania, Central American, and South America. While this type of mining is important for local economies and livelihood, it is often unregulated, which leads to illegal mining and unsafe working conditions. Due to unregulated conditions, the mistreatment of artisanal miners, violence, illegal trading, and sometimes child labour can occur. In addition, long term health effects are common when mining coltan, due to the presence of radioactive material within the mineral. In countries such as Sierra Leone, Liberia, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, lucrative trading of minerals, such as coltan, has occurred due to lack of state control of artisanal and small-scale mining in the region.

<text>Ulexite () sometimes called TV rock or TV stone due to its unusual optical properties, is a hydrous borate hydroxide of sodium and calcium with the chemical formula . The mineral occurs as silky white rounded crystalline masses or in parallel fibers. Ulexite was named for the German chemist Georg Ludwig Ulex (1811–1883), who first discovered it.

The natural fibers of ulexite act as optical fibers, transmitting light along their long axes by internal reflection. When a piece of ulexite is cut with flat polished faces perpendicular to the orientation of the fibers, a good-quality specimen will display an image of whatever surface is adjacent to its other side. The fiber-optic effect is the result of the polarization of light into slow and fast rays within each fiber, the internal reflection of the slow ray and the refraction of the fast ray into the slow ray of an adjacent fiber. An interesting consequence is the generation of three cones, two of which are polarized, when a laser beam obliquely illuminates the fibers. These cones can be seen when viewing a light source through the mineral.

Ulexite is found in evaporite deposits and the precipitated ulexite commonly forms a &quot;cotton ball&quot; tuft of acicular crystals. Ulexite is frequently found associated with colemanite, borax, meyerhofferite, hydroboracite, probertite, glauberite, trona, mirabilite, calcite, gypsum and halite. It is found principally in California and Nevada, US; Tarapacá Region in Chile, and Kazakhstan. Ulexite is also found in a vein-like bedding habit composed of closely packed fibrous crystals.

== History ==

Ulexite has been recognized as a valid mineral since 1840, after George Ludwig Ulex, for whom the mineral was named, provided the first chemical analysis of the mineral. In a footnote on p. 51, the editor claimed that Ulex&#x27;s mineral actually was the same mineral that the American chemist Augustus Allen Hayes had found in Chile in 1844:

In 1857, Henry How, a professor at King&#x27;s College in Windsor, Nova Scotia discovered borate minerals in the gypsum deposits of the Lower Carboniferous evaporate deposits in the Atlantic Provinces of Canada where he noted the presence of a fibrous borate that he termed natro-boro-calcite, which was actually ulexite (Papezik and Fong, 1975). 

Murdoch examined the crystallography of ulexite in 1940. The crystallography was reworked in 1959 by Clark and Christ and their study also provided the first powder x-ray diffraction analysis of ulexite. In 1963 ulexite&#x27;s remarkable fiber optics qualities were explained by Weichel-Moore and Potter. Their study highlighted the existence in nature of mineral structures exhibiting technologically required characteristics. Lastly, Clark and Appleman described the structure of ulexite correctly in 1964.

== Chemistry ==

Ulexite is a borate mineral because its formula (NaCaB5O6(OH)6·5H2O) contains boron and oxygen. The isolated borate polyanion [B5O6(OH)6]3− has five boron atoms, therefore placing ulexite in the pentaborate group.

Ulexite is a structurally complex mineral, with a basic structure containing chains of sodium, water and hydroxide octahedra. The chains are linked together by calcium, water, hydroxide and oxygen polyhedra and massive boron units. The boron units have a formula of [B5O6(OH)6]3– and a charge of −3. They are composed of three borate tetrahedra and two borate triangular groups.

Ulexite decomposes/dissolves in hot water.

== Morphology ==

Ulexite commonly forms small, rounded masses resembling cotton balls. Crystals are rare but will form fibrous, elongated crystals either oriented parallel or radial to each other. Crystals may also be acicular, resembling needles (Anthony et al., 2005). The point group of ulexite is 1, which means that the crystals show very little symmetry as there are no rotational axes or mirror planes. Ulexite is greatly elongated along [001]. The most common twinning plane is (010). Ulexite collected from the Flat Bay gypsum quarry in Newfoundland exhibits acicular &quot;cotton balls&quot; of crystals with a nearly square cross-section formed by the equal development of two pinacoids. The crystals are about 1–3 μm thick and 50–80 μm long, arranged in loosely packed, randomly oriented overlapping bundles (Papezik and Fong, 1975). In general, the crystals have six to eight faces with three to six terminal faces (Murdoch, 1940).

== Optical properties ==
In 1956, John Marmon observed that fibrous aggregates of ulexite project an image of an object on the opposite surface of the mineral. This optical property is common for synthetic fibers, but not in minerals, giving ulexite the nickname &quot;TV rock&quot;. According to Baur et al. (1957), this optical property is due to the reflections along twinned fibers, the most prominent twinning plane being on (010). The light is internally reflected over and over within each of the fibers that are surrounded by a medium of a lower refractive index (Garlick, 1991). This optical effect is also the result of the large spaces formed by the sodium octahedral chains in the mineral structure. Synthetic fibers used for fiber optics transmit images along a bundle of threadlike crystals the same way naturally occurring ulexite reproduces images due to the existence of different indices of refractions between fibers. Additionally, if the object is colored, all of the colors are reproduced by ulexite. Parallel surfaces of ulexite cut perpendicular to the fibers produce the best image, as distortion in the size of the projected image will occur if the surface is not parallel to the mineral. Curiously, &quot;in situ&quot; samples of ulexite are capable of producing a decent, rough image. Satin spar gypsum also exhibits this optical effect; however, the fibers are too coarse to transmit a decent image. The thickness of the fibers is proportional to the sharpness of the projected image.

Ulexite also displays concentric circles of light if held up to a bright light source, a strange optical property first observed by G. Donald Garlick (1991). This effect can also be produced by shining a laser pointer at a slightly oblique angle through a piece of ulexite. This optical behavior is a consequence of the different refractive indices of ulexite in different directions of polarization. Microscopic analysis of ulexite also yields cones of light that clearly emerge from each grain that is thicker than 0.1 mm under the Bertrand lens.

Ulexite is colorless and nonpleochroic in thin sections with low relief. Being triclinic, ulexite is optically biaxial. Interference figures yield addition on the concave side of the isogyres, causing ulexite to be biaxial positive. Ulexite has a high 2V that ranges between 73° – 78° and a maximum birefringence of up to 0.0300 (Anthony et al., 2005). According to Weichel-Moore and Potter (1963), the orientation of the fibers around the c-axis is completely random based on the variations in extinctions viewed under cross polarization. Ulexite displays polysynthetic twinning parallel to the elongation, along {010} and {100} (Murdoch, 1940). In thin sections cut parallel to the fibers, ulexite grains display both length-fast and length-slow orientations in equal quantities because the intermediate axis (y) of the indicatrix is roughly parallel to the elongation of the fibers along the crystallographic c-axis (Weichel-Moore and Potter, 1963).

== Structure ==
Ulexite crystals contain three structural groups, isolated pentaborate polyanions, calcium coordinated polyhedra, and sodium coordinated octahedra that are joined together and cross-linked by hydrogen bonding. The Ca-coordination polyhedra share edges to form chains which are separate from the Na-coordination octahedral chains. There are 16 distinct hydrogen bonds that have an average distance of 2.84 Å. Boron is coordinated to four oxygens in a tetrahedra arrangement and also to three oxygens in a triangular arrangement with average distances of 1.48 and 1.37 Å, respectively. Each Ca2+ cation is surrounded by a polyhedron of eight oxygen atoms. The average distance between calcium and oxygen is 2.48 Å. Each Na+ is coordinated by an octahedron of two hydroxyl oxygens and four water molecules, with an average distance of 2.42 Å (Clark and Appleman 1964). The octahedral and polyhedral chains parallel to c, the elongate direction, cause the fibrous habit of ulexite and the fiber optical properties.

== Significance ==

Boron is a trace element within the lithosphere that has an average concentration of 10 ppm, although large areas of the world are boron deficient. Boron is never found in the elemental state in nature, however boron naturally occurs in over 150 minerals. The three most important minerals from a worldwide commercial standpoint based on abundance are tincal (also known as borax), ulexite, and colemanite (Ekmekyaper et al., 2008). High concentrations of economically significant boron minerals generally occur in arid areas that have a history of volcanism. Ulexite is mined predominantly from the Borax mine in Boron, California.

The boron concentration of ulexite is commercially significant because boron compounds are used in producing materials for many branches of industry. Boron is primarily used in the manufacturing of fiberglass along with heat-resistant borosilicate glasses such as traditional PYREX, car headlights, and laboratory glassware. Borosilicate glass is desirable because adding B2O3 lowers the expansion coefficient, therefore increasing the thermal shock resistance of the glass. Boron and its compounds are also common ingredients in soaps, detergents, and bleaches, which contributes to the softening of hard water by attracting calcium ions. Boron usage in alloy and metal production has been increasing because of its excellent metal oxide solubilizing ability. Boron compounds are used as a reinforcing agent in order to harden metals for use in military tanks and armor. Boron is used extensively for fire retardant materials. Boron is an essential element for plant growth and is frequently used as a fertilizer, however in large concentrations boron can be toxic, and therefore boron is a common ingredient in herbicides and insecticides. Boron is also found in chemicals used to treat wood and as protective coatings and pottery glazes. Additionally when ulexite is dissolved in a solution of carbonate, calcium carbonate forms as a by-product. This by-product is used in large amounts by the pulp and paper industry as a paper filler and as a coating for paper that allows for improved printability (Demirkiran and Kunkul, 2011).
Recently, as more attention is being given to obtaining new sources of energy, the use of hydrogen as a fuel for cars has come to the forefront. The compound sodium borohydride (NaBH4) is currently being considered as an excellent hydrogen storage medium due to its high theoretical hydrogen yield by weight for future use in cars. Piskin (2009) validates that the boron concentration in ulexite can be used as the boron source or the starting material in the synthesis of sodium borohydride (NaBH4).

== Related minerals ==

Borate minerals are rare because their main component, boron, makes up less than 10 ppm (10 mg/kg) of Earth&#x27;s crust. Because boron is a trace element, the majority of borate minerals occur only in one specific geologic environment: geologically active intermontane basins. Borates are formed when boron bearing solutions, caused from the leaching of pyroclastic rocks, flow into isolated basins where evaporation then takes place. Over time, borates deposit and form into stratified layers. Ulexite occurs in salt playas and dry saline lakes in association with large-scale gypsum deposits and Na-Ca borates. There are no known polymorphs of ulexite nor does ulexite form a solid solution series with any other minerals.

According to Stamatakis &quot;et al&quot;. (2009) Na, Ca, and Na-Ca borates are found in relation to ulexite. These minerals are:

* Borax Na2B4O7·10H2O
* Colemanite Ca2B8O11·5H2O
* Howlite Ca2B5SiO9[OH]5
* Kernite Na2[B4O6(OH)2·3H2O]
* Meyerhofferite Ca2B6O6(OH)10·2H2O
* Probertite NaCaB5O9·5H2O

More common minerals that are not borates, but also form in evaporite deposits are:

* Calcite CaCO3
* Gypsum CaSO4·2H2O
* Halite NaCl

<doc id="151488" wikidata="Q218630" url="?curid=151488" title="Michael Dell">
<text>Michael Saul Dell (born February 23, 1965) is an American billionaire businessman and investor. He is the founder, chairman, and CEO of Dell Technologies, one of the world&#x27;s largest technology infrastructure companies. 

He is the 10th-richest person in the world as of December 2024, according to Forbes &quot;Bloomberg Billionaires Index&quot;, with a net worth of $130 billion. As of October 2023, according to &quot;Forbes&quot;, approximately $50 billions of his net worth was derived from his 50% stake in Dell and 40% stake in VMware, with the rest being held by his family office DFO Management. 

In January 2013, it was announced that he had bid to take Dell Inc. private for $24.4 billion in the biggest management buyout since the Great Recession. Dell Inc. officially went private in October 2013. The company once again went public in December 2018.

==Early life and education==
Dell was born in 1965 in Houston to a Jewish family. His parents were Lorraine Charlotte (née Langfan), a stockbroker, and Alexander Dell, an orthodontist. Michael attended Herod Elementary School in Houston. In a bid to enter business early, he applied to take a high school equivalency exam at age eight. In his early teens, he invested his earnings from part-time jobs in stocks and precious metals.

Dell purchased his first calculator at age seven and encountered an early teletype terminal in junior high. At age 15, after playing with computers at Radio Shack, he got his first computer, an Apple II, which he promptly disassembled to see how it worked. Dell attended Memorial High School in Houston, selling subscriptions to the &quot;Houston Post&quot; in the summer. Dell&#x27;s parents wanted him to be a doctor and in order to please them, he took up pre-med at the University of Texas in 1983. Dell continued learning to target specific populations for newspaper subscriptions rather than just making cold calls. He discovered that people who were most likely to get a subscription were newlyweds and people moving to a new home. After collecting the contact information of this population from public records, he sent direct mail appeals and earned $18,000 in one year. He hired several employees, and after earning a gross profit of nearly $200,000 in his first year of business, Dell dropped out of the University of Texas at age 19.

==Business career==
While a freshman pre-med student at the University of Texas, Dell started an informal business putting together and selling upgrade kits for personal computers in Room 2713 of the Dobie Center residential building. He then applied for a vendor license to bid on contracts for the State of Texas, winning bids by not having the overhead of a computer store. 

In January 1984, Dell believed that the potential cost savings of a manufacturer selling PCs directly had enormous advantages over the conventional indirect retail channel. In January 1984, Dell registered his company as &quot;PC&#x27;s Limited&quot;. Dell’s strategy was to sell directly to customers by manufacturing computers only after they were ordered. Operating out of a condominium, the business sold between $50,000 and $80,000 worth of PC upgrades, kits, and add-on components. In May, Dell incorporated the company as &quot;Dell Computer Corporation&quot; and relocated to a business center in North Austin. The company employed a few people as order takers, a few more to fill the orders, and, as Dell recalled, a manufacturing staff consisting of &quot;three guys with screwdrivers sitting at six-foot tables&quot;. The venture&#x27;s capitalization cost was $1,000. During the formative years of Dell Computer, Dell was mentored by Morton Meyerson.

In 1992, aged 27, he became the youngest CEO of a company ranked in &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the top 500 corporations. In 1996, Dell started selling computers over the Web, the same year his company launched its first servers. By March 1997, Dell Inc. reported about $1 million in sales per day from dell.com. In the first quarter of 2001, Dell Inc. reached a world market share of 12.8 percent, surpassing Compaq to become the world&#x27;s largest PC maker. The metric marked the first time the rankings had shifted over the previous seven years. The company&#x27;s combined shipments of desktops, notebooks and servers grew 34.3 percent worldwide and 30.7 percent in the United States at a time when competitors&#x27; sales were shrinking.

On March 4, 2004, Dell stepped down as CEO, but stayed as chairman of Dell Inc.&#x27;s board, while Kevin Rollins, then president and COO, became president and CEO. On January 31, 2007, Dell returned as CEO at the request of the board, succeeding Rollins.

In 2013, Michael Dell with the help of Silver Lake Partners, Microsoft, and a consortium of lenders took Dell, Inc. private. The deal was reportedly worth $25 billion and faced difficulties during its execution. Notable resistance came from Carl Icahn, but after several months he stepped aside. Michael Dell received a 75% stake in the company.

On October 12, 2015, Dell Inc. announced its intent to acquire the enterprise software and storage company EMC Corporation. At $67 billion, it has been labeled the &quot;highest-valued tech acquisition in history&quot;. The acquisition was finalized September 7, 2016.

==Penalty==
In July 2010, Dell Inc. agreed to pay a $100 million penalty to settle SEC charges of disclosure and accounting fraud in relation to undisclosed payments from Intel Corporation. Michael Dell and former CEO Kevin Rollins agreed to pay $4 million each and former CFO James Schneider agreed to pay $3 million to settle the charges.

==Accolades==
Accolades for Dell include &quot;Entrepreneur of the Year&quot; (at age 24) from &quot;Inc.&quot; magazine; &quot;Top CEO in American Business&quot; from &quot;Worth&quot; magazine; &quot;CEO of the Year&quot; from &quot;Financial World&quot;, &quot;IndustryWeek&quot; and &quot;Chief Executive&quot; magazines. Dell also received the 1998 Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement and the 2013 Franklin Institute&#x27;s Bower Award for Business Leadership.

==Affiliations==
Dell serves on the Foundation Board of the World Economic Forum, the executive committee of the International Business Council, the U.S. Business Council. He previously served as a member of the U.S. President&#x27;s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.

In April 2020, Governor Greg Abbott named Dell to the Strike Force to Open Texas – a group &quot;tasked with finding safe and effective ways to slowly reopen the state&quot; during the COVID-19 pandemic.

<text>The Guiana Shield (; ; ; ) is one of the three cratons of the South American Plate. It is a 1.7 billion-year-old Precambrian geological formation in northeast South America that forms a portion of the northern coast. The higher elevations on the shield are called the Guiana Highlands, which is where the table-like mountains called tepuis are found. The Guiana Highlands are also the source of some of the world&#x27;s most well-known waterfalls such as Angel Falls, Kaieteur Falls and Cuquenan Falls.

The Guiana Shield underlies Guyana (previously &quot;British Guiana&quot;), Suriname (previously &quot;Dutch Guiana&quot;), and French Guiana (or &quot;Guyane&quot;), much of southern Venezuela, as well as parts of Colombia and Brazil. The rocks of the Guiana Shield consist of metasediments and metavolcanics (greenstones) overlain by sub-horizontal layers of sandstones, quartzites, shales and conglomerates intruded by sills of younger mafic intrusives such as gabbros.

== Geology ==
The oldest rocks in the shield consist of Archean Imataca Complex, composed of a quartz-feldspar gneiss and subordinate mafic gneiss. The Guri Fault marks the southern boundary of the complex. South of that fault are Early Proterozoic rocks consisting of the metavolcanic Pastora Supergroup and the granitic plutonic Supamo Complex. The Cuchivero Group consists of ash flow tuff and granitic plutonic rocks. The Early to Middle Proterozoic Roraima Group consists of continental clastic sedimentary rocks. These Precambrian sediments include quartz sandstones, quartzites, and conglomerates presumed to be 1.8 to 1.4 Ga in age.

== Geomorphology ==
There are three upland areas of the Guiana Shield:
# The Guiana Highlands proper are in Venezuela east of the Orinoco and extend across much of west-central Guyana and into the northern Roraima state in Brazil.
# The Tumucumaque Uplands which are a series of central massifs in an arc from the Wilhelmina Mountains of south-central Suriname, along the southern boundary of Suriname and Guyana, forming the Acarai Mountains of Roraima state and the Tumuc-Humac Mountains of Pará and Amapá states of Brazil. From this arc, the southern uplands slope gently downwards towards the Amazon River and the northern uplands slope gently downwards toward the Atlantic.
# The Chiribiquete Plateau is a sandstone topped plateau with an elevation of that forms the western edge of the shield. The plateau is separated from the eastern Andes by the thick Neogene sediments of the Sub-Andean Trough that runs along the northern and western rim of the Guiana Shield.

The north-central part of the Guiana Highlands is dominated by high flat-topped peaks called tepuis, of the Roraima supergroup and Quasi-Roraima formation, and the rounded granite peaks of the Parguaza and Imataca complexes to the north and southwestern edges of the area. The highest point in the shield is Pico da Neblina in Brazil at . Pico da Neblina is the highest summit of the larger Neblina massif, a highly eroded sandstone plateau that straddles the Venezuela-Brazil border and that has lost the typical tabletop shape of the other tepuis in the region.

== Ecology ==

The Guiana Shield is one of the regions of highest biodiversity in the world, and has many endemic species. The region houses over 3000 vertebrate species: 1168 fresh water fish, 269 amphibians (54% endemics), 295 reptiles (29%), 1004 birds (7.7%), and 282 mammals (11%). Diversity of invertebrates remains largely undocumented, but there are several species of endemic butterflies and dung beetles.

Plant life is equally rich and 13,367 species of vascular plants have been found, approximately 40% of which is considered endemic. The shield is overlain by the largest expanse of tropical forest on any Precambrian shield area in the world. Guianan rain forest is similar in nature to Amazonian rain forest and known protected areas include the Iwokrama Forest of central Guyana, Kaieteur, Kanuku National Park of southern Guyana, the UNESCO World Heritage Site Central Suriname Nature Reserve of Suriname, the Guiana Amazonian Park in French Guiana and the Tumucumaque National Park in the Amapá State of Brazil. In Venezuela the forests are protected by Canaima, Parima-Tapirapeco and Serranía de la Neblina national parks. In 2014, the Government of Colombia designated a 250 hectare area of the Guiana Shield, as a Ramsar Wetland, thus becoming a protected area of international importance in accordance to the Ramsar Convention.

According to recent researches, although ecosystems of the Guayana Highlands remain vibrant, emerging issues (including &quot;a well-known invasive plant elsewhere&quot; &quot;Poa annua&quot; and &quot;one of the most aggressive weeds&quot; &quot;Polypogon elongatus&quot;) and infectious faecal bacteria &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; have been documented.

<doc id="151496" wikidata="Q667478" url="?curid=151496" title="Cheeseburger">
<text>A cheeseburger is a hamburger with a slice of melted cheese on top of the meat patty, added near the end of the cooking time. Cheeseburgers can include variations in structure, ingredients and composition. As with other hamburgers, a cheeseburger may include various condiments and other toppings such as lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, bacon, avocado, mushrooms, mayonnaise, ketchup, and mustard.

In fast food restaurants across the United States, processed cheese is usually used, although other meltable cheeses are used, such as cheddar, Swiss, mozzarella, blue cheese, or pepper jack. Virtually all restaurants that sell hamburgers also offer cheeseburgers.

==Origins==
By the late 19th century, the vast grasslands of the Great Plains had been opened up for cattle ranching. This made it possible for many Americans to consume beef almost daily. The hamburger remains as one of the cheapest forms of beef in America.

Adding cheese to hamburgers became popular in the 1920s. There are several competing claims as to who created the first cheeseburger. Lionel Sternberger is reputed to have introduced the cheeseburger in 1924 at the age of 16. He was working as a fry cook at his father&#x27;s Pasadena, California, sandwich shop, &quot;The Rite Spot&quot;, and &quot;experimentally dropped a slab of American cheese on a sizzling hamburger.&quot;
An early example of the cheeseburger appearing on a menu is a 1928 menu for the Los Angeles restaurant O&#x27;Dell&#x27;s, which listed a cheeseburger smothered with chili for 25 cents.

Other restaurants also claim to have invented the cheeseburger. For example, Kaelin&#x27;s Restaurant in Louisville, Kentucky, said it invented the cheeseburger in 1934. One year later, a trademark for the name &quot;cheeseburger&quot; was awarded to Louis Ballast of the Humpty Dumpty Drive-In in Denver, Colorado. According to Steak &#x27;n Shake archives, the restaurant&#x27;s founder, Gus Belt, applied for a trademark on the word in the 1930s.

Dale Mulder, the owner of an A&amp;W Restaurants franchise in Lansing, Michigan, has been credited with inventing the bacon cheeseburger in 1963, putting it on the menu after repeated requests from the same customer. This was highlighted in a 2014 ad campaign for the chain featuring Mulder, who had since become the president of the A&amp;W chain. However, there are earlier examples of a restaurant selling bacon cheeseburgers, including a menu for a Harrisburg, Pennsylvania restaurant from 1941.

The steamed cheeseburger, a variation almost exclusively served in central Connecticut, is believed to have been invented at a restaurant called Jack&#x27;s Lunch in Middletown, Connecticut, in the 1930s.

The largest cheeseburger ever made weighed . It is said to have included &quot; of bacon, of lettuce, of sliced onions, of pickles, and of cheese.&quot; This record was set in 2012 by Minnesota&#x27;s Black Bear Casino, smashing the previous record of .

In the United States, National Cheeseburger Day is celebrated annually on September 18.

==Ingredients==

The ingredients used to create cheeseburgers follow similar patterns found in the regional variations of hamburgers, although most start with ground beef. Common cheeses used for topping are American, Swiss, Cheddar and other meltable cheeses. Popular toppings include lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, bacon, avocado or guacamole, sliced sautéed mushrooms, cheese sauce or chili, but the variety of possible toppings is broad.

A cheeseburger may have more than one patty or more than one slice of cheese—it is reasonably common, but by no means automatic, for the number to increase at the same rate with cheese and meat interleaved. A stack of two or more patties follows the same basic pattern as hamburgers: with two patties will be called a double cheeseburger; a triple cheeseburger has three, and while much less common, a quadruple has four. 

Sometimes cheeseburgers are prepared with the cheese enclosed within the ground beef, rather than on top. This is sometimes known as a Jucy Lucy.

<doc id="151497" wikidata="Q153607" url="?curid=151497" title="The Marshall Mathers LP">
<text>The Marshall Mathers LP is the third studio album by American rapper Eminem. It was released on May 23, 2000, by Aftermath Entertainment and Interscope Records. Production on the album was handled by Dr. Dre, Mel-Man, F.B.T., Eminem, and The 45 King. The album spawned three hit singles: &quot;The Real Slim Shady&quot;, &quot;The Way I Am&quot; and &quot;Stan&quot;, and features guest appearances from Dido, RBX, Sticky Fingaz, Dina Rae, Bizarre, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Xzibit, Nate Dogg, Paul Rosenberg and D12.

Recorded over a two-month period in several studios around Detroit, the album features introspective lyricism reflecting Eminem&#x27;s thoughts on his rise to fame, criticism of his music, and estrangement from his family. As a transgressive work, it incorporates hardcore hip-hop, satirical hip-hop, and horrorcore. Like its predecessor, &quot;The Marshall Mathers LP&quot; was surrounded by significant controversy upon its release, while also propelling Eminem to the forefront of American pop culture. Criticism centered on lyrics that were considered violent, homophobic, and misogynistic, as well as references to the Columbine High School massacre in the songs &quot;The Way I Am&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Back&quot;. Future second lady Lynne Cheney criticized the lyrics at a United States Senate hearing, as misogynistic and violent against women, while the Canadian government considered refusing Eminem&#x27;s entry into the country. Despite the controversies, it received widespread acclaim from critics, who praised Eminem&#x27;s lyrical ability and considered the album to have emotional depth.

The album debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, staying atop for eight consecutive weeks. A significant commercial success compared to the release of &quot;The Slim Shady LP&quot; just the previous year, the album sold 1.78 million copies in its first week, which made it among the fastest-selling studio albums in the United States. The album produced the singles &quot;The Real Slim Shady&quot;, &quot;The Way I Am&quot;, and &quot;Stan&quot;. Among other publications, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named it the best album of 2000.

&quot;The Marshall Mathers LP&quot; has been included in numerous all-time lists and is widely regarded as Eminem&#x27;s greatest album. It has sold 25 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time, and is certified 12× platinum and Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It was nominated for Album of the Year and won Best Rap Album at the 2001 Grammy Awards, while &quot;The Real Slim Shady&quot; won Best Rap Solo Performance. &quot;The Marshall Mathers LP 2&quot;, the album&#x27;s sequel, was released in 2013.

== Background ==
Inspired by the disappointment and failure of his debut album, &quot;Infinite&quot; (1996), Eminem created the alter ego Slim Shady, whom he introduced on the &quot;Slim Shady EP&quot; (1997). After placing second in the annual Rap Olympics, Eminem was noticed by the staff at Interscope Records and eventually CEO Jimmy Iovine, who played the &quot;Slim Shady EP&quot; for hip-hop producer Dr. Dre. Eminem and Dr. Dre then met and recorded &quot;The Slim Shady LP&quot; (1999), which was noted for its over-the-top lyrical depictions of drugs and violence. &quot;The Slim Shady LP&quot; was a critical and commercial success, debuting at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and selling 283,000 copies in its first week. At the 42nd Grammy Awards in 2000, the record won Best Rap Album, while the album&#x27;s lead single &quot;My Name Is&quot; won Best Rap Solo Performance.

&quot;The Slim Shady LP&quot; turned Eminem from an underground rapper into a high-profile celebrity. The rapper, who had previously struggled to provide for his daughter Hailie, noted a drastic change in his lifestyle. In June 1999, he married his girlfriend Kimberly Ann &quot;Kim&quot; Scott, the mother of Hailie, despite the fact that the song &quot;&#x27;97 Bonnie &amp; Clyde&quot; from &quot;The Slim Shady LP&quot; contains references to killing her. The rapper became uncomfortable with the level of fame he had achieved, and said, &quot;I don&#x27;t trust nobody now because everybody I meet is meeting me as Eminem...I don&#x27;t know if they are hanging with me &#x27;cause they like me or because I&#x27;m a celebrity or because they think they can get something from me.&quot; Eminem also became a highly controversial figure due to his lyrical content. He was labeled as &quot;misogynist, a nihilist and an advocate of domestic violence&quot;, and in an editorial, &quot;Billboard&quot; editor in chief Timothy White accused Eminem of &quot;making money by exploiting the world&#x27;s misery&quot;.

Eminem considered naming the album &quot;Amsterdam&quot; after a trip to the city shortly after the release of &quot;The Slim Shady LP&quot;, in which he and his friends engaged in heavy drug use. The &quot;free&quot; use of drugs Eminem observed during his time in Amsterdam greatly influenced his desire to openly discuss drug use in his music and inspired some of the content on the album.

== Recording ==

&quot;The Marshall Mathers LP&quot; was recorded in a two-month-long &quot;creative binge&quot;, which often involved 20-hour-long studio sessions. Eminem hoped to keep publicity down during the recording in order to stay focused on working and figuring out how to &quot;map out&quot; each song. He described himself as a &quot;studio rat&quot; who benefited creatively from the isolated environment of the studio. Much of the album was written spontaneously in the studio; Dr. Dre noted, &quot;We don&#x27;t wake up at two in the morning, call each other, and say, &#x27;I have an idea. We gotta get to the studio.&#x27; We just wait and see what happens when we get there.&quot; Eminem observed that much of his favorite material on the album evolved from &quot;fucking around&quot; in the studio; &quot;Marshall Mathers&quot; developed from the rapper watching Jeff Bass casually strumming a guitar, while &quot;Criminal&quot; was based on a piano riff Eminem overheard Bass playing in studio next door. &quot;Kill You&quot; was written when Eminem heard the track playing in the background while talking to Dr. Dre on the phone and developed an interest in using it for a song. He then wrote the lyrics at home and met up with Dr. Dre and the two recorded the song together.

&quot;Kim&quot; was the first song the rapper recorded for the album, shortly after finishing work on &quot;The Slim Shady LP&quot;. Eminem wrote &quot;Kim&quot; at a time in which he and his wife were separated, and he had just watched a romantic movie alone at a theater. Originally intending to write a love song for her while using ecstasy, the rapper hoped to avoid overt sentimentality and thus began writing a song of hate. With the track, the rapper aimed to create a short horror story in the form of a song. Once the couple reconciled, Eminem recalls, &quot;I asked her to tell me what she thought of it. I remember my dumb ass saying, &#x27;I know this is a fucked-up song, but it shows how much I care about you. To even think about you this much. To even put you on a song like this&#x27;.&quot; The song &quot;Stan&quot; was produced by The 45 King. Eminem&#x27;s manager, Paul Rosenberg, sent Eminem a tape of the producer&#x27;s beats, and the second track featured a sample of English singer-songwriter Dido&#x27;s &quot;Thank You&quot;. Upon hearing the song&#x27;s lyrics, Eminem felt they described an obsessed fan, which became the inspiration for the song. The writing process for &quot;Stan&quot; differed greatly from Eminem&#x27;s usual strategy, in which song concepts form during the writing: Stan&#x27; was one of the few songs that I actually sat down and had everything mapped out for. I knew what it was going to be about.&quot; Dido later heard &quot;Stan&quot; and enjoyed it, and observed, &quot;I got this letter out of the blue one day. It said, &#x27;We like your album, we&#x27;ve used this track. Hope you don&#x27;t mind, and hope you like it.&#x27; When they sent [&#x27;Stan&#x27;] to me and I played it in my hotel room, I was like, &#x27;Wow! This track&#x27;s amazing.

Some label executives speculated that Eminem would be the first artist to sell one million copies in an album&#x27;s first week of release. These expectations placed a large burden on Eminem, who recalled, &quot;I was scared to death. I wanted to be successful, but before anything, I want respect.&quot; After the album was finished, executives felt that there were no songs that had potential to be a lead single. Feeling pressured, Eminem returned to the studio and wrote &quot;The Way I Am&quot; as his way of saying, &quot;Look, this is the best I can do. I can&#x27;t give you another &#x27;My Name Is.&#x27; I can&#x27;t just sit in there and make that magic happen.&quot; However, after the song was added to the album, Eminem felt the urge to write another song, and gave a hook to Dr. Dre for him to create a beat, and went home to write new lyrics; the song eventually became &quot;The Real Slim Shady&quot;. The song also discusses Eminem killing Dr. Dre. The producer stated, &quot;It was funny to me. As long as it&#x27;s hot, let&#x27;s roll with it ... in my opinion, the crazier it is the better. Let&#x27;s have fun with it and excite people.&quot;

== Music and lyrics ==

Considered both a horrorcore and a hardcore hip-hop album, much of the album&#x27;s first half was produced by Dr. Dre and Mel-Man, who employed their typical sparse, stripped-down beats, to put more focus on Eminem&#x27;s vocals. The background music on the record employs &quot;liquid basslines, stuttering rhythms, slight sound effects, and spacious soundscapes&quot;. Bass Brothers and Eminem produced most of the second half, which ranges from the laid-back guitars of &quot;Marshall Mathers&quot; to the atmosphere of &quot;Amityville&quot;. The only outside producer on the album was The 45 King, who sampled a verse from Dido&#x27;s song &quot;Thank You&quot; for &quot;Stan&quot;, while adding a slow bass line.

&quot;The Marshall Mathers LP&quot; is considered a transgressive work, and contains more autobiographical themes in comparison to &quot;The Slim Shady LP&quot;. Much of the album is spent addressing his rise to fame and attacking those who criticized his previous album. Other themes include his relationship with his family, including his mother and Kim Mathers, his ex-wife. Unlike Eminem&#x27;s major-label debut, &quot;The Slim Shady LP&quot;, &quot;The Marshall Mathers LP&quot; is more introspective in its lyrics and uses less of the Slim Shady persona,with it used in only two songs [The Real Slim Shady and I&#x27;m Back]with music critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine writing that the album&#x27;s lyrics &quot;[blur] the distinction between reality and fiction, humor and horror, satire and documentary&quot;. The record showcases a variety of moods, ranging from irreverent and humorous to &quot;dark and unsettling enough to make you want to enlarge the parental warning stickers on the album.&quot; According to Neil Strauss of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Eminem never makes it clear which character—Slim Shady or Marshall Mathers—is the mask and which is the real person, because there is no clear-cut answer, except that there&#x27;s a little bit of each character in all of us.&quot;

Most songs cover Eminem&#x27;s childhood struggles and family issues, involving his mother (&quot;Kill You&quot;), the relationship struggles with his wife (&quot;Kim&quot;), his struggles with his superstardom and expectations (&quot;Stan&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Back&quot;, and &quot;Marshall Mathers&quot;), his return and effect on the music industry (&quot;Remember Me?&quot;, &quot;Bitch Please II&quot;), his drug use (&quot;Drug Ballad&quot;, &quot;The Kids&quot;), his effect on the American youth and society (&quot;The Way I Am&quot;, &quot;Who Knew&quot;), and reactionary barbs to critical response of his vulgarity and dark themes (&quot;Criminal&quot;). Despite the large amount of controversy regarding the lyrics, the lyrics on the album were overwhelmingly well received among critics and the hip-hop community, many praising Eminem&#x27;s verbal energy and dense rhyme patterns.

The record also contains lyrics that have been considered to be homophobic. The song &quot;Criminal&quot; features the line &quot;My words are like a dagger with a jagged edge/That&#x27;ll stab you in the head whether you&#x27;re a fag or les or a homosex, hermaph, or a transavest, pants or dress, Hate fags?/The answer&#x27;s yes&quot;. The Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) condemned his lyrics and criticized the album for &quot;encourag[ing] violence against gay men and lesbians&quot;. However, writing for the LGBT interest magazine &quot;The Advocate&quot;, editor Dave White writes, &quot;If he has gay-bashed you or me, then it logically follows that he has also raped his own mother, killed his wife, and murdered his producer, Dr. Dre. If he&#x27;s to be taken literally, then so is Britney Spears&#x27; invitation to &#x27;hit me baby, one more time&#x27;.&quot; Eminem noted that he began using the word &quot;faggot&quot; more frequently when &quot;people got all up in arms about it...to piss them off worse&quot;, but added, &quot;I think it&#x27;s hard for some people to understand that for me the word &#x27;faggot&#x27; has nothing to do with sexual preference. I meant something more like assholes or dickheads.&quot; Evangelical Christian religious figure James Dobson also heavily criticized Eminem.

== Songs ==
The first track, &quot;Kill You&quot;, discusses the controversy that surrounded the rapper&#x27;s first album, nightmares of &quot;ladies&#x27; screams&quot;, and being raised by a single mother. In the song, Eminem also talks of raping his mother, and &quot;notes the irony of magazines trumpeting his mother-raping self on their covers&#x27;.&quot; The six-and-a-half minute long &quot;Stan&quot; samples Dido&#x27;s &quot;Thank You&quot; and tells the story of an exchange between the rapper and an extremely obsessive fan, where the titular character berates Eminem for not responding to his letters, which later turns to the fan committing suicide with his pregnant girlfriend. On &quot;Who Knew&quot;, the rapper addresses criticism regarding glorification of violence in his lyrics, pointing out perceived hypocrisy in American society. According to Gabriel Alvarez of &quot;Complex&quot;, Eminem&#x27;s response ranges oscillates from &quot;smart-ass (&#x27;Oh, you want me to watch my mouth, how?/Take my fuckin&#x27; eyeballs out and turn &#x27;em around?&#x27;) to smart (&#x27;Ain&#x27;t they got the same moms and dads who got mad when I asked if they liked violence?/And told me that my tape taught &#x27;em to swear/What about the makeup you allow your 12-year-old daughter to wear?&#x27;).&quot; &quot;Who Knew&quot; is followed by the &quot;Steve Berman&quot; skit. &quot;What&#x27;s the Difference&quot; plays in the background while the president of sales at Interscope Records angrily confronts the rapper about his lyrical content. He notes that Dr. Dre was successful because he rapped about &quot;big-screen TVs, blunts, 40&#x27;s, and bitches&quot;, while Eminem raps about &quot;homosexuals and Vicodin&quot;, and believes that the album will be a commercial and critical disaster.

&quot;The Way I Am&quot; is a meditation on the pressure to maintain his fame, and his fear of being &quot;pigeon-holed into some poppy sensation/to cop me rotation at rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll stations&quot;. He also laments the negative media attention received by controversial public figures such as himself and Marilyn Manson in the wake of shootings, including the Columbine High School massacre and the 1998 Westside Middle School shooting. The rapper criticizes the media for focusing on tragedies such as school shootings while ignoring inner-city violence that occurs on a daily basis. &quot;The Real Slim Shady&quot; pokes fun at pop culture icons such as Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera and Will Smith. &quot;Remember Me?&quot; follows with rappers RBX and Sticky Fingaz, who &quot;kick seriously Stygian darkness on the ominous track&quot;. In the song, he states &quot;I&#x27;m tryna clean up my fuckin&#x27; image / So I promised the fuckin&#x27; critics / I wouldn&#x27;t say &#x27;fuckin&#x27; for six minutes/(Six minutes, Slim Shady, you&#x27;re on)&quot;. Despite saying the word &quot;fuck&quot; one more time in &quot;Remember Me&quot;, and three times at the beginning of &quot;I&#x27;m Back&quot;, he does not say the word &quot;fuckin&quot; for seven minutes and 29 seconds after delivering the original promise, saying it again in the song &quot;Marshall Mathers&quot;.

&quot;I&#x27;m Back&quot; features Eminem&#x27;s observations regarding his rise to fame, explaining that he &quot;became a commodity/&#x27;Cause I&#x27;m W-H-I-T-E&quot;. The next song, &quot;Marshall Mathers&quot;, mocks the chorus of LFO&#x27;s &quot;Summer Girls&quot;, while criticizing the lack of artistic merit of pop stars such as Britney Spears, the Backstreet Boys, NSYNC, and Ricky Martin. The song also takes aim at rap duo Insane Clown Posse, where Eminem raps about Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope being flaming homosexuals. &quot;Drug Ballad&quot; has vocals from Dina Rae, and describes the rapper&#x27;s struggles with his drug addiction. He writes about some of his experiences under the influence of ecstasy which makes him &quot;sentimental as fuck, spilling guts to you/we just met, but I think I&#x27;m in love with you&quot; and features a party esque feel. . &quot;Amityville&quot; is a bass-heavy ode to living in Detroit, where the rapper discusses the city&#x27;s crowning as murder capital of the United States. &quot;Bitch Please II&quot; showcases Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg and Xzibit, and contains elements of g-funk, as well as R&amp;B crooning from Nate Dogg on the chorus.

&quot;Kim&quot;, the prequel to &quot;97 Bonnie and Clyde&quot; from &quot;The Slim Shady LP&quot;, features Eminem &quot;screaming at his ex in an insane stream-of-consciousness hate spew&quot;. The song begins with Eminem talking softly to his daughter, but as the beat starts, the rapper takes on portraying two characters, utilizing his own enraged, threatening voice, seemingly from realizing Kim has cheated on him with another man, and the terrified shrieks of his wife Kim. As the song ends, Eminem kills her while taunting, &quot;Bleed, bitch, bleed!&quot; &quot;Kim&quot; is followed by &quot;Under the Influence&quot;, which sees Eminem speaking in gibberish for the chorus, and later rap group D12 &quot;runs rampant&quot; on the track. &quot;Criminal&quot; features production from F.B.T., which consists of &quot;piano licks, swerving synth, and a deceptively simplistic bass rumble over which Em snakes and snarls and warns that &#x27;you can&#x27;t stop me from topping these charts...&#x27;&quot;. He pokes fun at critics who take his lyrical content seriously, explaining that &quot;half the shit I say, I just make it up to make you mad&quot;.

==Release==
&quot;The Marshall Mathers LP&quot; was released on May 23, 2000, by Aftermath Entertainment, Interscope Records, in the United States, and on September 11, 2000, by Polydor Records in the United Kingdom. &quot;The Marshall Mathers LP&quot; was released with two different album covers. The original features Eminem sitting on the porch of the house he lived in during his teenage years. He reflected on the photo shoot by saying, &quot;I had mixed feelings because I had a lot of good and bad memories in that house. But to go back to where I grew up and finally say, &#x27;I&#x27;ve made it&#x27;, is the greatest feeling in the world to me.&quot; The other cover features the rapper seated in a fetal position beneath a loading dock with alcohol and prescription pill bottles at his feet. Will Hermes of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; likened Eminem&#x27;s appearance on the cover to a &quot;dysfunctional Little Rascal&quot;, viewing the image as indicative of the rapper&#x27;s musical evolution: &quot;Easy to read, right? The debut: a violent fantasy, the acting-out of a persona. The follow-up: the vulnerable artist unmasked.&quot;

=== Censorship ===
In his book &quot;Edited Clean Version: Technology and the Culture of Control&quot;, author Raiford Guins writes that the clean version of &quot;The Marshall Mathers LP&quot; &quot;resembles a cross between a cell phone chat with terrible reception...and a noted hip-hop lyricist suffering from an incurable case of hiccups.&quot;

This version of the album often either omits words completely or obscures them with added sound effects. The clean version of the album did not censor all profanity. Words like &quot;ass&quot;, &quot;bitch&quot;, &quot;goddamn&quot;, and &quot;shit&quot; were uncensored. However, on the track &quot;The Real Slim Shady&quot;, the words &quot;bitch&quot; and &quot;shit&quot; were censored out, as its radio edit was mainly used. References to violence and weapons were also significantly altered, and the titles to the songs &quot;Kill You&quot;, &quot;Drug Ballad&quot;, and &quot;Bitch Please II&quot; are censored on the back cover. The song &quot;Kim&quot; is removed completely and replaced by &quot;The Kids&quot;, a &quot;South Park&quot;-themed track about drug usage and the American youth which is also featured on the special edition of the album.

Special attention was given to editing aggressive and violent lyrics that were aimed at police, prostitutes, women, homosexuals, bullies, minors, and schools. In response to the attack that had occurred at Columbine High School in April 1999, names of guns and sounds of them firing were censored. Interscope Records insisted on censoring the words &quot;kids&quot; and &quot;Columbine&quot; from the line, &quot;I take seven [kids] from [Columbine], stand them all in line&quot; from &quot;I&#x27;m Back&quot;, even on the explicit version of the album. Mike Rubin of &quot;Spin&quot; called the censorship a &quot;curious decision, given that lyrics like &#x27;Take drugs / Rape sluts&#x27; are apparently permissible&quot;. Eminem commented on his lyrics regarding the shooting, calling the specific Columbine incident &quot;so fucking touchy.&quot; He elaborated being saying, &quot;as much sympathy as we give the Columbine shootings, nobody ever looked at it from the fuckin&#x27; point of view of the kids who were bullied — I mean, they took their own fucking life! And it was because they were pushed so far to the fucking edge that they were fucking so mad. I&#x27;ve &quot;been&quot; that mad.&quot; The full line appears uncensored in Eminem&#x27;s song &quot;Rap God&quot; from &quot;The Marshall Mathers LP 2,&quot; although it remains censored on the clean version.

The line &quot;It doesn&#x27;t matter, [your attorney Fred Gibson&#x27;s a] faggot&quot; was also censored from &quot;Marshall Mathers&quot;; the line refers to his mother Debbie Nelson&#x27;s lawyer, who assisted her in filing a lawsuit against the rapper for defamation regarding lyrics from &quot;The Slim Shady LP&quot;.

== Commercial performance ==

&quot;The Marshall Mathers LP&quot; sold 1.78 million copies in its first week, which made it one of the fastest-selling studio albums in the United States. The album sold twice as much as the previous hip-hop record holder for first week sales in the US, which was Snoop Dogg&#x27;s 1993 album &quot;Doggystyle&quot;. &quot;The Marshall Mathers LP&quot; sold over 800,000 copies in its second week, 600,000 copies in its third week, and 520,000 copies in its fourth week for a four-week total of 3.65 million. It also became one of the few albums to sell over half a million copies for four consecutive weeks. In total, the album spent eight weeks at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, ranking it fourth on the current all-time list of weeks spent at number one by a hip-hop album. By the end of 2000, &quot;The Marshall Mathers LP&quot; had become the second-best-selling album of the year with over eight million copies sold. &quot;The Marshall Mathers LP&quot; was also the best-selling album of 2000 in Canada, selling 679,567 copies.

According to &quot;Billboard&quot;, as of 2022, &quot;The Marshall Mathers LP&quot; is one of the 15 best-performing 21st-century albums without any of its singles being number-one hits on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The first single, &quot;The Real Slim Shady&quot;, became Eminem&#x27;s biggest hit up to that point. It peaked at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and topped the UK Singles Chart. &quot;The Way I Am&quot;, which was released as the album&#x27;s second single, peaked at number eight on the UK Singles Chart and 58 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;Stan&quot;, the third single released from the album, became a number-one hit in both the United Kingdom and Australia. The song, which details around a crazed fan of the same name, has been highlighted as a work of poetry by critics, and soon gave rise to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; term stan.

In 2010, Nielsen SoundScan reported that up until November 2009, &quot;The Marshall Mathers LP&quot; had sold 10,216,000 copies in the US, making it the fourth-best selling album of the decade. The album has been certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and its sales stand at over 11 million copies in the United States, making it Eminem&#x27;s best-selling album in his home country. In worldwide sales, the album has sold 25 million copies, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time. A sequel to the album, &quot;The Marshall Mathers LP 2&quot;, was released on November 5, 2013.

==Critical reception==

&quot;The Marshall Mathers LP&quot; was met with widespread critical acclaim. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 78, based on 21 reviews.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s Touré applauded Dr. Dre&#x27;s production and Eminem&#x27;s varied lyrical style on what is a &quot;car-crash record: loud, wild, dangerous, out of control, grotesque, unsettling&quot;, but ultimately captivating. &quot;Melody Maker&quot; said that Eminem&#x27;s startlingly intense vision of &quot;rap&#x27;s self-consciousness&quot; is truly unique, while Steve Sutherland of &quot;NME&quot; praised the album as a misanthropic and &quot;gruelling assault course of lyrical genius&quot; that critiques malevolent aspects of contemporary society. Chuck Eddy from &quot;The Village Voice&quot; said that Eminem is backed by attractive music and displays an emotionally complex and witting quality unlike his previous work. In the newspaper&#x27;s consumer guide column, Robert Christgau called him &quot;exceptionally witty and musical, discernibly thoughtful and good-hearted, indubitably dangerous and full of shit&quot;, while declaring the album &quot;a work of art whose immense entertainment value in no way compromises its intimations of a pathology that&#x27;s both personal and political&quot;. Will Hermes of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote that as the first significant popular music album of the 2000s, &quot;The Marshall Mathers LP&quot; is &quot;indefensible and critic-proof, hypocritical and heartbreaking, unlistenable and undeniable&quot;.

On the other hand, music journalist Greg Kot said the reaction to &quot;The Marshall Mathers LP&quot; was &quot;mixed&quot;, or reluctantly positive, among critics who praised Eminem&#x27;s &quot;verbal skills and transgressive humor&quot; but decried some of the subject matter. In his review for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Robert Hilburn reserved his praise because of homophobic lyrics on what he felt is an otherwise conceptual and personal work, &quot;docked a half star because of the recurring homophobia—something that may be de rigueur in commercial rap, but which still is unacceptable.&quot; Steve Jones of &quot;USA Today&quot; opined that Eminem&#x27;s &quot;vicious and patently personal lyrical assaults&quot; would &quot;almost grow tedious if he weren&#x27;t as inventive as he is tasteless.&quot; &quot;Q&quot; magazine felt that the subject matter does not make for an enjoyable listen, even though Eminem&#x27;s disaffected and nihilistic lyrics can be provocative. &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;″s Sal Cinquemani was more critical in a one-and-a-half star review and found his raps extremely distasteful: &quot;The only thing worse than Eminem&#x27;s homophobia is the immaturity with which he displays it&quot;. On the other hand, &quot;Spin&quot; felt that the rapping is excellent, but plagued more so by unremarkable music and lackluster tracks.

Among other publications, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and &quot;Melody Maker&quot; named &quot;The Marshall Mathers LP&quot; the best album of 2000. In 2000, the album won in the Best Album category at the MTV Europe Music Awards. It also won in the Best Rap Album category at the 43rd Grammy Awards in 2001. &quot;The Marshall Mathers LP&quot; was nominated for Album of the Year, but lost to jazz-rock duo Steely Dan&#x27;s &quot;Two Against Nature&quot;.

== Legacy and reappraisal ==

Since its initial release, &quot;The Marshall Mathers LP&quot; has been highly acclaimed in retrospective critic reviews. It has been regarded by critics as Eminem&#x27;s best album and has been ranked in multiple lists of the greatest albums of all time. In &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004), Christian Hoard said it &quot;delved much deeper into personal pain [than &quot;The Slim Shady LP&quot;], and the result was a minor masterpiece that merged iller-than- flows with a brilliant sense of the macabre.&quot; According to Sputnikmusic&#x27;s Nick Butler, &quot;The Marshall Mathers LP&quot; stands as a culturally significant record in American popular music, but also &quot;remains a truly special album, unique in rap&#x27;s canon, owing its spirit to rock and its heritage to rap, in a way I&#x27;ve rarely heard&quot;. Insanul Ahmed of &quot;Complex&quot; wrote, &quot;At a time when the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts were dominated by squeaky-clean pop acts like NSYNC and Backstreet Boys, Eminem offered a rebuttal to the hypocritical American mainstream that criticizes rap music while celebrating—and, worse, commercializing—sex, violence, and bigotry in other arenas. This album turned Eminem into a global icon. There was a huge amount of hype and controversy around it [...] But none of that takes away from its musical achievement. This album definitively proved that the Detroit rapper was a gifted lyricist, a brilliant songwriter, and a visionary artist.&quot; Mike Elizondo, a former collaborator on Eminem&#x27;s albums, said, &quot;I felt like Marshall was part of this wave with Quentin Tarantino, &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; (1994) and &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; (1992) [...] This next level of art with incredible graphic imagery that Marshall had the ability to paint. Love it or hate it he was obviously very skilled at the stories he was telling.&quot;

Jeff Weiss of &quot;The Ringer&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;The&quot; &quot;Marshall Mathers LP&quot; certified Eminem as an alienated voice of a generation, a caustic wedge issue distilling the spirits of Elvis, Holden Caulfield, Johnny Rotten, Kurt Cobain, Cartman from &quot;South Park&quot;, and Tupac if he shopped at Kroger. In a postmodern abyss where everything&#x27;s performative, it might have been the last album that possessed the capacity to genuinely shock.&quot; Dan Ozzi of &quot;Vice&quot; highlighted that &quot;Eminem was the one artist high school kids seemed to unanimously connect with. [...] he represented everything high school years are about: blind rage, misguided rebellion, adolescent frustration. He was like a human middle finger. An X-rated Dennis the Menace for a dial-up modem generation.&quot; Max Bell of &quot;Spin&quot; wrote that the album remains &quot;one of the most critically-acclaimed, commercially-successful, and influential albums in rap history&quot;, citing rappers influenced by the album, such as Tyler, the Creator, Earl Sweatshirt, Kendrick Lamar, and Juice WRLD. Bonsu Thompson of Medium described the album as &quot;a masterful confluence of punk, bluegrass, and subterranean hip-hop that gave life to a singular brand of Americana rap.&quot; Thompson further praised the album&#x27;s impact on white rappers, saying, &quot;For a snapshot of the album&#x27;s seismic influence, compare the pre–&quot;Marshall Mathers LP&quot; decade of White rappers like Everlast and MC Serch with the post-2000 landscape of Action Bronson, G-Eazy, and the late Mac Miller [...] Eminem homogenized the White rapper.&quot;In 2003, &quot;The Marshall Mathers LP&quot; was ranked number 302 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time; it was moved up to number 244 in the magazine&#x27;s revised 2012 edition of the list, and moved to 145 on the 2020 edition. IGN named it the twenty-fourth greatest rap album of all time in a 2004 list. In 2006, &quot;The Marshall Mathers LP&quot; was included by &quot;Time&quot; in its list of the 100 Greatest Albums of All Time. That same year, &quot;Q&quot; ranked it number 85 on a list of The Greatest Albums of All Time, the highest position held by any hip-hop album on the list. &quot;The Marshall Mathers LP&quot; was also the highest ranked hip-hop album on the National Association of Recording Merchandisers &amp; the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s list of the 200 Definitive Albums of All Time, where it was placed at number 28. It has been named one of the Top 100 Albums of the Decade (2000s) by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, who ranked it seventh, &quot;Complex Magazine&quot;, who ranked it fourth, and &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, who ranked it 119th. &quot;The Guardian&quot; ranked the album at 29 on its Top 50 Albums of the decade. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; ranked the album at 36 on its Best Albums of the Decade list. &quot;Popdose&quot; listed &quot;The Marshall Mathers LP&quot; as the 10th best album of the decade. &quot;Spinner&quot; ranked the album at 22 on its Best Albums of the 2000s list. In 2010, Rhapsody ranked it at number 1 on their list of &quot;The 10 Best Albums by White Rappers&quot;. In 2015, the album was ranked number 81 by &quot;About.com&quot; on their list of 100 Best Hip-Hop Albums of All Time. In 2020, &quot;The Marshall Mathers LP&quot; was included at the 100 Best Albums of the 21st Century list of &quot;Stacker&quot;, being ranked at 69. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. In 2022, it was ranked 25 by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; on their list &quot;The 200 Greatest Rap Albums of All Time&quot;.

== Controversies ==

While the album was hugely controversial and criticized, Eminem propelled to the forefront of American pop culture. At a United States Senate hearing, Lynne Cheney criticized Eminem and sponsor Seagram for &quot;promot[ing] violence of the most degrading kind against women&quot;, labeling him as &quot;a rap singer who advocates murder and rape&quot;. She specifically cited lyrics from &quot;Kill You&quot;, explaining, &quot;He talks about murdering and raping his mother. He talks about choking women slowly so he can hear their screams for a long time. He talks about using O.J.&#x27;s machete on women, and this is a man who is honored by the recording industry&quot;. Cheney drew a link between the Columbine massacre and violent music, mentioning artists Eminem and Marilyn Manson as musicians who contribute to the United States&#x27; culture of violence. Although she stated that she has &quot;long been a vocal supporter of free speech&quot;, Cheney called for the music industry to impose age-restrictions on those who can purchase music with violent content.

On October 26, 2000, Eminem was on the co-headlining Anger Management Tour with Limp Bizkit and scheduled to perform at a concert in Toronto&#x27;s SkyDome. However, Ontario Attorney General Jim Flaherty argued that Canada should stop Eminem at the border. &quot;I personally don&#x27;t want anyone coming to Canada who will come here and advocate violence against women&quot;, he said. Flaherty claims to have been &quot;disgusted&quot; when reading transcriptions of Eminem&#x27;s song &quot;Kill You&quot;, which includes lines like &quot;Slut, you think I won&#x27;t choke no whore/till the vocal cords don&#x27;t work in her throat no more?&quot; Eminem&#x27;s fans argued that this was a matter of free speech and that he was unfairly singled out. Michael Bryant suggested that the government let Eminem perform and then prosecute him for violating Canada&#x27;s hate crime laws, despite the fact that Canada&#x27;s hate-crime legislation does not include violence against women. In an editorial in &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, author Robert Everett-Green wrote, &quot;Being offensive is Eminem&#x27;s job description.&quot; Eminem was granted entry into Canada.

A 2001 and 2004 study by Edward Armstrong found that of the 14 songs on &quot;The Marshall Mathers LP&quot;, eleven contain violent and misogynistic lyrics and nine depict killing women through choking, stabbing, drowning, shooting, head and throat splitting. According to the study, Eminem scores 78% for violent misogyny while gangsta rap music in general reaches 22%. Armstrong argues that violent misogyny characterizes most of Eminem&#x27;s music and that the rapper &quot;authenticates his self-presentations by outdoing other gangsta rappers in terms of his violent misogyny.&quot; A fifteen-year-old boy in Fresno, California was arrested in September 2015 for making terrorist threats, after sharing the Columbine-related lyrics to &quot;I&#x27;m Back&quot; on Instagram.

===Reactions from other artists===

Protests against the album&#x27;s content reached a climax when it was nominated for four Grammy Awards in 2001 including Album of the Year. At the ceremony, Eminem performed &quot;Stan&quot; in a duet with openly gay artist Elton John playing piano and singing the chorus. This performance was a direct response to claims by GLAAD and others who claimed his lyrics were homophobic, with Eminem stating, &quot;Of course I&#x27;d heard of Elton John, but I didn&#x27;t know he was gay. I didn&#x27;t know anything about his personal life. I didn&#x27;t really care, but being that he was gay and he had my back, I think it made a statement in itself saying that he understood where I was coming from.&quot; GLAAD did not change its position, however, and spoke out against Elton John&#x27;s decision. Despite significant protests and debate, &quot;The Marshall Mathers LP&quot; went on to win Best Rap Album.

In a 2001 interview with &quot;Spin&quot; magazine, Johnny Cash defended Eminem against accusations that the album encouraged violence, pointing out that the most popular song of the 19th century was the violent folk song &quot;Jesse James&quot;. Cash added that nobody had re-enacted the murder portrayed in his own &quot;Folsom Prison Blues&quot;.

Singer Christina Aguilera was upset about the lyric, &quot;Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs so I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst / and hear &#x27;em argue over who she gave head to first&quot; from &quot;The Real Slim Shady&quot;, calling the rapper&#x27;s claim &quot;disgusting, offensive and, above all, not true&quot;. Eminem included this line after becoming angry with the singer for informing the public during an MTV special without his consent about the rapper&#x27;s secret marriage to Kim Mathers. However, the two later settled their differences after hugging backstage at the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards, with the singer appearing at the premiere of &quot;8 Mile&quot; months later.

In 2002, French jazz pianist Jacques Loussier filed a $10 million lawsuit against Eminem that was later settled out of court. The lawsuit claimed the beat for &quot;Kill You&quot; was stolen from his song &quot;Pulsion&quot;.

<text>Effingham is a village in the Borough of Guildford in Surrey, reaching from the gently sloping northern plain to the crest of the North Downs and with a medieval parish church. The village was the home of notable figures, such as Barnes Wallis who is buried here and Toni Mascolo. The M25 motorway is north-west of the middle of the village, which consists of new build homes and green space in the Metropolitan Green Belt.

An Junction railway station is north of its boundary in East Horsley, where a branch of the Sutton and Mole Valley Lines joins the New Guildford Line, which has services terminating at London Waterloo.

==History==

===Late Stone Age===
Long before Effingham was named by the Saxons, a prehistoric track now called the North Downs Way or Pilgrims&#x27; Way was an important prehistoric thoroughfare in Britain. Part of this ancient road forms the southern boundary of Effingham parish. It was used by early traders of flint and stone implements and there is evidence of stone age flint mining in the neighbouring village of Horsley.

=== Roman times ===

A Roman coin featuring Emperor Tiberius (r. AD 14–37) and his mother Livia was found in Effingham in 1970 by Dr Sutton in land being prepared as rugby fields in King George V Playing Fields. It is not known whether the coin was dropped on the land by a passing Roman or arrived in chalk from nearby Horsley used as foundations for the rugby pitches.

In 1802 General Oliver de Lancy, Lord of the Manor of Effingham East Court, found a small camp of irregular form near Mare House, Dunley Hill in the south of Effingham parish. It is believed to be of Roman origin but was lost after the land was enclosed and became arable.

=== Anglo-Saxon period ===

Around c. AD 493, a Saxon noble called Aeffing built his &quot;ham&quot; or house in the area now known as Effingham. A charter of AD 727 granted 20 dwellings in Bookham and Effingham to the Benedictine monastery at Chertsey.

Effingham lay within the Saxon administrative district of Effingham

Effingham appears in Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Epingeham&quot;. It was held by Osuuold (Oswald) from Chertsey Abbey and Richard Fitz Gilbert. Its domesday assets were: 4½ ploughs, of meadow, herbage and pannage worth 18 hogs. It rendered £8.

===Medieval period to 18th century===
By the 14th century, the main manor house stood on the site of a Regency mansion which is the clubhouse to Effingham Golf Course, then owned by Sir John Poultney, four times Lord Mayor of the City of London

By 1545, King Henry VIII was hunting on what is now Effingham Golf Course whilst staying at Hampton Court nearby. The manor house and lands were then owned by Lord William Howard (the Lord High Admiral, and later 1st Baron Howard of Effingham) and it was his son the 2nd Baron Howard of Effingham (later 1st Earl of Nottingham) who commanded the English fleet against the Spanish Armada.

The Regency mansion, now the clubhouse, contains a large, intricately carved oak fireplace in the Armada room, dated 1591, which is believed to have been made with timbers from one of Lord Howard of Effingham&#x27;s ships.

===19th century===

The house and lands which is now Effingham Golf Club passed through many hands until in 1815 the house and of land came into the possession of Sir Thomas Hussey Apreece. It was in 1927 when the Surrey Land and Development company negotiated a lease for a group of people wishing to build a golf course. Effingham Manor Golf Club was formed with the artisan golfers using as a clubhouse what are now greenkeepers&#x27; cottages near the third tee area. The club has one of the largest man-made lakes in the county which is used to water the golf course during droughts.

The clubhouse, previously the Manor House, is Georgian in style and was reconstructed by David Burnsall in about 1770. Beside the clubhouse is a cedar tree dated to c.1600 which gives rise to the club emblem. The course, designed by Harry S. Colt, is used to hold the qualifying rounds for the Open.
In 1870–72, John Marius Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales&quot; described Effingham as:

&quot;a village, a parish, and a hundred in Surrey. The village stands 3¾ miles SW of Leatherhead r. station, and 4¼ NW by W of Dorking; has a post office under Leatherhead; was formerly a place of some importance, said to have contained sixteen churches; and gives the title of Earl to the Howards of Grange. The parish, with the village, is in Dorking district, and comprises . Real property, £4,094. Pop., 633. Houses, 122. The property is much subdivided. Effingham Hall is the seat of the Stringers. The living is a vicarage in the diocese of Winchester. Value, £370.* Patron, Andrew Cuthell, Esq. The church is ancient, has stalls, and is good. There is a Wesleyan chapel...&quot;

George Pauling made a name and fortune in connection with the expansion of the railways throughout southern and central Africa under his great friend and confidant, Sir Cecil Rhodes. At the latter&#x27;s request, Pauling accepted the portfolio of Mines and Public Works for Rhodesia and a member of the Executive Council, holding office from 1894–1896. The Lodge and surrounding land, including what is now the KGV playing fields, Pauling bought and spent a &quot;large sum of money in adding to it and spoiling it&quot;. In 1912, George Pauling was granted the privilege of a Private Oratory in The Lodge by the then Pope, Pius X. Two dozen local Catholics worshipped there on Sundays and the Chapel became a church the year later. The other church he built in England was to the Sacred Heart at St Ives in 1902.

===20th century===
Sir Barnes Wallis lived most of his adult life here. He is best known as the inventor of the bouncing bomb which breached the Eder and Mohne dams in the Second World War. He also designed airships including the R100 and applied the geodetic construction methods to aeroplanes.

Wallis lived with his wife Molly in the village for 49 years. Their home south of the village centre in Beech Avenue was called White Hill House but is now renamed Little Court and looks over Effingham Golf Club&#x27;s 17th fairway. It is believed that early bouncing bomb experiments were carried out in his garden using the family washtub and his children&#x27;s marbles.

Barnes Wallis joined the governing body of St Lawrence Church, which is a Grade II* listed church in 1932 and served as their secretary for eight years until 1940. In 1946 Barnes Wallis became an Effingham Parish Councillor and served as Chairman of Effingham Parish Council for 10 years. He was also the Chairman of Effingham Housing Association which helped the poor and elderly of the village with housing.

Knighted in 1968, Sir Barnes Wallis was instrumental in the founding days of the KGV playing fields at Effingham. He was Chairman of the KGV Management Committee and negotiated the landscaping of the &quot;bowl&quot; cricket ground. As a fanatical cricket fan, he was keen to see a first-class ground in his village; the County Council wanted to improve the line of the adjacent A246 Guildford road and Wallis persuaded them to cut and fill the sloping playing field to achieve the current superb flat cricket ground. At one stage it was the back-up ground to The Oval. He was the first Chairman of the Effingham Housing Association, a charity which built homes for local people; the most recent development, Barnes Wallis Close, was opened by two members of his family in 2002.

In 1967 on Barnes Wallis&#x27; 80th birthday the village presented him with an album about the history of Effingham in recognition of his national and village contributions.

Sir Barnes Wallis died on 30 October 1979 and was buried four days later in St Lawrence Churchyard, a few yards from KGV fields. Two weeks after the funeral, on 17 November, a memorial service was held for him at St. Lawrence Church and on noon that day an Avro Vulcan bomber from 617 Squadron flew overhead as a mark of respect.

On 3 July 1944 a V1 flying bomb fell on Beech Avenue and hit close to a house called Orchard Walls which was damaged.

On 10 July another V1 flying bomb scored a direct hit on a cottage called &quot;Little Thatch&quot;. It killed the owner and injured his wife and child. This was the only civilian casualty of World War II in the village. The cottage was rebuilt and renamed Phoenix Cottage which survives to this day on Effingham Common Road.

The Royal Army Service Corps were stationed in Effingham with Canadian soldiers encamped and headquartered in High Barn, Beech Avenue, close to where Barnes Wallis lived.

==Landmarks==
Among Effingham&#x27;s architecturally imposing or recognised buildings is an early work by wide-reaching architect Sir Edwin Lutyens, the &quot;Red House&quot; built in 1893 for Susan Muir-Mackenzie, a mutual friend of Gertrude Jekyll who laid out its garden and orchard. The house later became Corpus Domini Convent and was converted to apartments in 2008.

== Amenities ==
A well-served small village in commerce but less so in public transport, dwarfed by its neighbours Great Bookham and Little Bookham, it is known for its railway station (which is north of the village), large common, generous sports park (called the KGV playing fields), St Teresa&#x27;s School (private girls&#x27; prep school) and the Howard of Effingham School.

A Wealth of the Nation report in 2002 found that Effingham had the second-highest proportion of adults with a savings account in the UK.

About half of housing scales slopes south of the A246 (between Little Bookham and East Horsley) at the top of the small High Street &quot;The Street&quot;. The village was founded by the church as a spring line settlement, at the foot of the North Downs. Two parallel roads, The Street and Church Street reflect this by their steep gradient. At the bottom wells exist, whereas towards the top, layers of permeable topsoil underlain with chalk and limestone prevent reaching water.

==Sport==
As well as the golf club, the village is home to Effingham Cricket Club and Effingham and Leatherhead Rugby Club.

In 2012 Howard of Effingham school became the first school from the south of England to qualify to play at Wembley Stadium in rugby league&#x27;s Champion Schools tournament.

==Demography and housing==

The average level of accommodation in the region composed of detached houses was 28%, the average that was apartments was 22.6%.
The proportion of households in the civil parish who owned their home outright compares to the regional average of 35.1%. The proportion who owned their home with a loan compares to the regional average of 32.5%. The remaining % is made up of rented dwellings (plus a negligible % of households living rent-free).

==In popular culture==
Effingham featured in the 1971 comedy film &quot;She&#x27;ll Follow You Anywhere&quot;.

<text>Jelly beans are small bean-shaped sugar candies with soft candy shells and thick gel interiors (see gelatin and jelly). The confection is primarily made of sugar and sold in a wide variety of colors. According to one common story, they existed as early as 1861, when Boston confectioner William Schrafft urged people to buy them as gifts for soldiers in the American Civil War. A more definite reference appears in food testing records of the United States Department of Agriculture published in 1887. Most historians contend that jelly beans were first associated with celebrations of Easter in the United States sometime during the 1930s due to their egg-like shape.

== Manufacture ==
The basic ingredients of jelly beans include sugar, tapioca or corn syrup, and pectin or starch. Relatively minor amounts of the emulsifying agent lecithin, anti-foaming agents, an edible wax such as carnauba wax or beeswax, salt, and confectioner&#x27;s glaze are also included. The ingredients that give each bean its character are also relatively small in proportion and may vary depending on the flavor.

== Slang ==
In United States slang during the 1910s and early 1920s. a &quot;jellybean&quot; or &quot;jelly-bean&quot; was a young man who dressed stylishly but had little else to recommend him, similar to the older terms &quot;dandy&quot; and &quot;fop&quot;. F. Scott Fitzgerald published a story, &quot;The Jelly-Bean&quot;, about such a character in 1920. While previously common, the slang word has fallen out of fashion as of 2025.

==In popular culture==
When Beatlemania broke out in 1964, fans of the Beatles in the US pelted the band with jelly beans (emulating fans in the UK who threw the British candy Jelly Babies at George Harrison, who reportedly liked eating them).

<text>Jelly Belly Candy Company, formerly known as Herman Goelitz Candy Company and Goelitz Confectionery Company, is an American company that manufactures Jelly Belly jelly beans and other candy.

The company is based in Fairfield, California, with a second manufacturing facility in North Chicago, Illinois. A distribution and visitor center in Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin closed in 2020. In October 2008, the company opened a manufacturing plant in Rayong, Thailand, where it produces confections for the international market. In October 2023, the Ferrara Candy Company announced an agreement to acquire Jelly Belly Candy Company.

==History==

===1866–1913===

Gustav Goelitz came to the United States in 1866 from Germany and in 1869 started the confectionery business Gustav Goelitz in Belleville, Illinois. His younger brothers, Albert and George, emigrated to America soon after joining him in the business.
In 1898, the company began manufacturing mellowcreme candies (also called mellow cream or butter cream). Candy corn, a type of mellowcreme candy, was likely developed by George Renniger, an employee of Wunderle&#x27;s Candy Company in Philadelphia. 
The Goelitz Confectionery Company was successful in selling a variety of mellowcreme candy including candy corn. In 1900 the company opened a factory in Cincinnati and in 1904 the company opened another factory in Chicago. Eventually, the company relocated to North Chicago in 1913.

===1913–1980===
Herman Goelitz, the son of Gustav, moved to the West Coast to start his own business, Herman Goelitz Candy Company. The company eventually settled in Oakland, California in 1924. In the 1960s, the company began to expand the product line to include jelly beans, various jells, and other confections. &quot;One of those new products was a small and very flavorful Mini Jelly Bean [developed in 1965].&quot; The Mini Jelly Bean had natural flavoring added to the center and the outer shell was flavored, which was innovative for the time.

Ronald Reagan, who &quot;had quit smoking years before and turned to popping candy as an oral substitute&quot;, first tried the company&#x27;s [mini] jelly beans in 1969. According to Maria Wilhelm of &quot;People&quot; magazine, he was &quot;hooked&quot; upon receiving the beans from Rowland.

Reagan wrote to Herman Rowland as governor in 1973, &quot;we can hardly start a meeting or make a decision without passing around the jar of jelly beans.&quot;

In 1976, David Klein, a candy and nut distributor, collaborated with Herman Rowland (grandson of Herman Goelitz) to develop a jelly bean using natural flavoring. Using the Mini Jelly Bean concept, the Jelly Belly jelly bean was created. David Klein hired Herman Goelitz Candy Company as his contract manufacturer to produce the bean. David Klein called the bean, Jelly Belly jelly bean. Klein coined the name &quot;Jelly Belly&quot; as a tribute to blues musician Lead Belly, and was responsible for the design of the product&#x27;s famous red and yellow trademark.

David Klein sold the first Jelly Belly jelly beans in 1976 at an ice cream parlor called Fosselman&#x27;s in Alhambra, California. The first flavors were Very Cherry, Tangerine, Lemon, Green Apple, Grape, Licorice, Root Beer, and Cream Soda. It was David Klein&#x27;s idea &quot;to sell them as separate flavors instead of a variety pack...&quot;.

===1980–present===
Marinus van Dam, product developer and plant manager for the company, oversaw the development of Jelly Belly jelly beans. By the 1980s, many flavors had been developed. In 1980, Klein sold the Jelly Belly trademark. &quot;David Klein sold the Jelly Belly trademark to Rowland for $4.8 million, paid in monthly installments over 20 years, which Klein split with a partner.&quot; The Jelly Belly trademark was registered August 3, 1982. The Mr. Jelly Belly character was developed in 1983. Prior to the development of the character David Klein called himself &quot;Mr. Jelly Belly.&quot;
The general public became aware of Reagan&#x27;s preference for the jelly beans in 1981. The company supplied him with the beans throughout his presidency. Chairman Rowland recalls, &quot;We were thrilled by press reports that President Reagan gave jars of Jelly Belly jelly beans to visiting dignitaries.&quot; Reagan made them the first jelly beans in space, sending them on the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; during the STS-7 mission in 1983, surprising the astronauts. However, he &quot;started to favor M&amp;M&#x27;s as the official White House candy during his eighth and final year in office.&quot;

In 2001, the company renamed itself to Jelly Belly Candy Company.

In 2022, the company countersued Klein in federal court for falsely claiming to be the founder of the company.

In October 2023, The Ferrara Candy Company announced an agreement to acquire Jelly Belly Candy Company through CTH Invest, the lead holding company of Ferrara. Financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed.

==Products==
=== Jelly beans ===
The company&#x27;s signature product, the Jelly Belly jelly bean, comes in more than 50 varieties ranging from traditional flavors like orange, lemon lime, and very cherry, to more exotic ones like cinnamon, pomegranate, cappuccino, buttered popcorn, and chili-mango.

Jelly Belly Candy Company manufactures numerous specialty Jelly Belly jelly beans with licensed products like Tabasco sauce and uncommon candy tastes like egg nog and pancakes with maple syrup. A few flavors such as lychee and green tea, are sold only in markets outside the United States.

Several flavors have been based on popular alcoholic beverages, beginning with Mai Tai in 1977. Over the years, new additions have included strawberry daiquiri, margarita, mojito, and piña colada. Draft beer, a flavor inspired by Hefeweizen ale, was introduced in 2014. All flavors are entirely alcohol-free.

&quot;Bertie Bott&#x27;s Every Flavour Beans&quot; were inspired by the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; book series and featured intentionally gruesome flavors such as &quot;Vomit&quot;, &quot;Earwax&quot;, &quot;Skunk Spray&quot;, &quot;Rotten Egg&quot; and &quot;Grass&quot;. A similar product dubbed &quot;BeanBoozled&quot; pairs lookalike &quot;normal&quot; flavors with weird flavors, such as &quot;Peach&quot; and &quot;Barf&quot;.

&quot;Sport Beans&quot; are jelly beans designed to provide physical energy and enhance athletic performance. They contain carbohydrates, electrolytes (in the form of sodium and potassium), and vitamins B1, B2, B3 and C. &quot;Extreme Sport Beans&quot; include the additional boost of caffeine.

=== Other candies ===
The company makes over 100 different confections including chocolates, licorice, gummies, and candy corn.

==Facilities==
The company operates three manufacturing plants in Fairfield, California; North Chicago, Illinois; and Rayong, Thailand. A fourth facility in Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin, was a distribution center and a visitor center until liquidation began on August 3, 2020; it closed.

<text>Candy corn is a small, pyramid-shaped candy, typically divided into three sections of different colors, with a waxy texture and a flavor based on honey, sugar, butter, and vanilla. It is a staple candy of the fall season and Halloween in North America.

Candy corn&#x27;s traditional colors of yellow, orange, and white represent the colors of the fall harvest, or of corn on the cob, with the wide yellow end resembling a corn kernel.

Candy corn has a reputation for generating polarizing responses, with articles referring to it as &quot;Halloween&#x27;s most contentious sweet&quot; which people either &quot;love&quot; or &quot;hate&quot;.

==History==
&quot;Chicken Feed&quot; was the original candy name, with production starting in the late 1880s. It was first invented in the 1880s by a Wunderle Candy Company employee, George Renninger. Wunderle Candy Company was the first to produce the candy in 1888. The Goelitz Confectionery Company, now called Jelly Belly, began manufacturing the product in 1898. 

While Jelly Belly still makes candy corn, the largest manufacturer of candy corn is Brach&#x27;s Confections owned by the Ferrara Candy Company. Brach&#x27;s makes approximately 7 billion pieces of candy corn per year and possesses 85 percent of the total share of the candy corn industry during the Halloween season.

Along with other agriculture-inspired treats in the late 19th century, America&#x27;s confectioners sought to market candy corn to a largely rural society. During the late 19th century, &quot;butter cream&quot; candies molded into many types of nature-inspired shapes, including chestnuts, turnips, and clover leaves, were quite popular but what made candy corn stand out was its bright and iconic tri-color layering.

Although it is currently most popular in the fall, candy corn was only sometimes associated with the fall and Halloween seasons. For the first half of the 20th century, candy corn was a well-known &quot;penny candy&quot; or bulk confectionery. It was advertised as an affordable and popular treat that could be eaten year-round.

Candy corn developed into a fall and Halloween staple around the 1950s when people began to hand out individually wrapped candy to trick-or-treaters. The harvest-themed colors and increased advertising in October also helped candy corn become a fall staple.

The National Confectioners Association has deemed October 30, the day before Halloween, &quot;National Candy Corn Day&quot;.

==Sales==
, annual production in the United States was 35 million pounds, or almost 9 billion pieces of candy. The majority of candy corn sales occur during the Halloween season.

==Production==
Originally, the candy was made by hand. Manufacturers first combined sugar, corn syrup and water, and cooked them to form a slurry. Fondant was added for texture and marshmallows were added to provide a soft bite. The final mixture was heated and poured into shaped molds. Three passes, one for each colored section, were required during the pouring process.

The recipe is similar today. The production method, called &quot;corn starch modeling&quot;, likewise remains the same, though tasks initially performed by hand were soon taken over by machines made for that purpose.

===Ingredients===
Candy corn is made with sugar, corn syrup, salt, sesame oil, honey, artificial flavor, food colorings, gelatin, and confectioner&#x27;s glaze. The confectioner&#x27;s glaze is made from lac resin, a bug secretion.

==Variants==
A popular variation called &quot;harvest corn&quot; adds cocoa powder; it features a chocolate brown wide end, orange center, and pointed white tip. It is often available around Thanksgiving. During the Halloween season, blackberry cobbler candy corn can be found in Eastern Canada, as well as candy corn shaped like pumpkins. Confectioners have introduced additional color variations suited to other holidays. 

The Christmas variant, sometimes called &quot;reindeer corn&quot;, typically has a red end and a green center. The Valentine&#x27;s Day variant, sometimes called &quot;cupid corn&quot;, typically has a red end and a pink center. In the United States during Independence Day celebrations, corn with a blue end, white center, and red tip, named &quot;freedom corn&quot;, can be found at celebratory cook outs and patriotic celebrations. The Easter variant, sometimes called &quot;bunny corn&quot;, is typically a two-color candy, and comes with a variety of pastel bases, pink, green, yellow, and purple, with white tips all in one package.

There have been caramel apple and green apple, s&#x27;mores and pumpkin spice, carrot corn (green and orange, with a carrot cake flavor), and birthday cake candy corn flavors. In 2022, Brach&#x27;s released a tailgate variant with fruit punch, vanilla ice cream, popcorn, hotdog, and hamburger flavored pieces.
Candy corn flavored snacks have become more widely available with candy corn flavored variants of snack foods and candy, including Oreos, M&amp;M&#x27;s, marshmallows, and more.

<text>Mario Fortino Alfonso Moreno Reyes (12 August 1911 – 20 April 1993), known by the stage name Cantinflas (), was a Mexican comedian, actor, and filmmaker. He is considered to have been the most widely accomplished Mexican comedian and is well known throughout Latin America and Spain.

His humor, loaded with Mexican linguistic features of intonation, vocabulary, and syntax, is beloved in all the Spanish-speaking countries of Latin America and in Spain. His abilities gave rise to a range of expressions based on his stage name, including: &quot;cantinflear&quot;, &quot;cantinflada&quot;, &quot;cantinflesco&quot;, &quot;cantifleando&quot; and &quot;cantinflero&quot;.

He often portrayed impoverished farmers or peasants of &quot;pelado&quot; origin. The character allowed Cantinflas to establish a long, successful film career that included a foray into Hollywood. Charlie Chaplin once commented that he was the best comedian alive, and Moreno has been referred to as the &quot;Charlie Chaplin of Mexico&quot;. 

To audiences in most of the world, he is best remembered as co-starring with David Niven in the Oscar-winning film &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot;, for which Moreno won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.

As a pioneer of the cinema of Mexico, Moreno helped usher in its golden era. In addition to being a business leader, he also became involved in Mexico&#x27;s complex labor politics. His reputation as a spokesperson for the working class gave his actions authenticity and became important in the early struggle against &quot;charrismo&quot;, the ruling PRI&#x27;s practice of co-opting and controlling trade unions.

Moreover, his character Cantinflas, whose identity became enmeshed with his own, was examined by media critics, philosophers, and linguists, who saw him variously as a danger to Mexican society, a bourgeois puppet, a verbal innovator, and a picaresque underdog.

== Early and personal life ==
Mario Fortino Alfonso Moreno Reyes was born in Santa María la Redonda neighborhood of Mexico City, then grew up in Tepito. He was one of eight children born to Pedro Moreno Esquivel, an impoverished mail carrier, and María de la Soledad Reyes Guízar (from Cotija, Michoacán). Moreno&#x27;s mother, Soledad Reyes, came from an affluent family, but was disinherited when she married Pedro Moreno. The others were Pedro, José (&quot;Pepe&quot;), Eduardo, Esperanza, Catalina, Enrique, and Roberto.

He made it through difficult situations with the quick wit and street smarts that he would later apply in his films. His comic personality led him to a circus tent show, and from there to legitimate theatre and film.

He married Valentina Ivanova Zubareff, of Russian ethnicity, on 27 October 1936 and remained with her until her death in January 1966. A son was born to Moreno in 1961 by another woman; the child was adopted by Valentina Ivanova and was named Mario Arturo Moreno Ivanova, causing some references to erroneously refer to him as &quot;Cantinflas&#x27; adopted son&quot;. Moreno Ivanova died on 15 May 2017, of a presumed heart attack.

Moreno served as president of one of the Mexican actors&#x27; guilds known as &quot;Asociación Nacional de Actores&quot; (ANDA, &quot;National Association of Actors&quot;) and as first secretary general of the independent filmworkers&#x27; union &quot;Sindicato de Trabajadores de la Producción Cinematográfica&quot; (STPC). Following his retirement, he devoted his life to helping others through charity and humanitarian organizations, especially those dedicated to helping children. His contributions to the Roman Catholic Church and orphanages made him a folk hero in Mexico.

He was a Freemason, initiated at Chilam Balam Lodge.

In 1961, Cantinflas appeared with U.S. Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson at shopping centers and supermarkets in San Antonio, Texas, to support the successful Democratic nominee to the United States House of Representatives for Texas&#x27;s 20th congressional district, Henry B. Gonzalez, who defeated his Republican challenger, John W. Goode. Gonzalez was the first Hispanic elected to the Texas State Senate and as a U.S. congressman from Texas.

== Origin of name ==
As a young man, Cantinflas performed a variety of acts in travelling tents, and it was here that he acquired the nickname &quot;Cantinflas&quot;. According to one obituary, &quot;Cantinflas&quot; is a meaningless name invented to prevent his parents from knowing he was in the entertainment business, which they considered a shameful occupation. Cantinflas confirmed this in 1992 in his last television interview.

== Entertainment career ==
Before starting his professional life in entertainment, he explored a number of possible careers, such as medicine and professional boxing, before joining the entertainment world as a dancer. By 1930 he was involved in Mexico City&#x27;s &quot;carpa&quot; (travelling tent) circuit, performing in succession with the Ofelia, Sotelo of Azcapotzalco, and finally the Valentina &quot;carpa&quot;, where he met his future wife. At first he tried to imitate Al Jolson&#x27;s use of blackface, but later separated himself to form his own identity as an impoverished slum dweller with baggy pants, a rope for a belt, and a distinctive mustache. In the tents, he danced, performed acrobatics, and performed roles related to several different professions.

=== Film career ===

In the mid-1930s, Cantinflas met publicist and producer Santiago Reachi and subsequently partnered with him to form their own film production venture. Reachi produced, directed, and distributed, while Cantinflas acted. Cantinflas made his film debut in 1936 with &quot;No te engañes corazón&quot; (&quot;Don&#x27;t Fool Yourself Dear&quot;) before meeting Reachi, but the film received little attention. Reachi established Posa Films in 1939 with two partners: Cantinflas and Fernandez. Before this, Reachi produced short films that allowed him to develop the Cantinflas character, but it was in 1940 that he finally became a movie star, after shooting &quot;Ahí está el detalle&quot; (&quot;There&#x27;s the rub&quot;, literally &quot;There lies the detail&quot;), with Sofía Álvarez, Joaquín Pardavé, Sara García, and Dolores Camarillo. The phrase that gave that movie its name became a &quot;Cantinflas&quot; (or catchphrase) for the remainder of his career. The film was a breakthrough in Latin America and was later recognized by &quot;Somos&quot; magazine as the 10th greatest film produced largely in Mexico.

In 1941, Moreno first played the role of a police officer on film in &quot;El gendarme desconocido&quot; (&quot;The Unknown Police Officer&quot; a play on words on &quot;The Unknown Soldier). By this time, he had sufficiently distinguished the &quot;peladito&quot; character from the 1920s-era &quot;pelado&quot;, and his character flowed comfortably from the disenfranchised, marginalized, underclassman to the empowered public servant. The rhetoric of &quot;cantinflismo&quot; facilitated this fluidity. He would reprise the role of Agent 777 and be honored by police forces throughout Latin America for his positive portrayal of law enforcement.

&quot;Ni sangre, ni arena&quot; (&quot;Neither Blood, nor Sand&quot; a play on words on the bullfighter/gladiator phrase &quot;Blood and Sand&quot;), the 1941 bullfighting film, broke box-office records for Mexican-made films throughout Spanish-speaking countries. In 1942, Moreno teamed up with Reachi, Miguel M. Delgado, and Jaime Salvador to produce a series of parodies, including El Circo, an interpretation of Chaplin&#x27;s &quot;The Circus&quot;.

The 1940s and 1950s were Cantinflas&#x27; heyday. In 1941, Reachi, the Producer rejected Mexican Studios companies and instead paid Columbia Pictures to produce the films in its Studios in Hollywood. By this time, Cantinflas&#x27; popularity was such that he was able to lend his prestige to the cause of Mexican labor, representing the National Association of Actors in talks with Mexican President Manuel Ávila Camacho. The talks did not go well, however, and, in the resulting scandal, Moreno took his act back to the theatre.

== Theater ==
On 30 August 1953, Cantinflas began performing his theatrical work &quot;Yo Colón&quot; (&quot;I, Columbus&quot;) in the &quot;Teatro de los Insurgentes&quot;, the same theatre that had earlier been embroiled in a controversy over a Diego Rivera mural incorporating Cantinflas and the Virgin of Guadalupe. Critics, including the very conservative political party PAN and archbishop Luis María Martínez, called the mural blasphemous, and it was eventually painted without the image of the Virgin.

&quot;Yo Colón&quot; placed Cantinflas in the character of Christopher Columbus, who, while continually &quot;discovering America&quot;, made comedic historical and contemporary observations from fresh perspectives. For the first few months, he persuaded the King and Queen of Spain to fund his voyage so that he could let his wife &quot;drive&quot; so she could make a wrong turn and discover Mexico instead, allowing him to also discover Jorge Negrete so that the Queen – an ardent fan – could meet him. When Negrete died just before Christmas of 1953, he changed it first to Pedro Infante until his death four years later, and then finally to Javier Solis until his death in 1966.

== Hollywood and beyond ==

In 1956, &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot;, Cantinflas&#x27; American debut, earned him a Golden Globe for Best Actor in a musical or comedy. &quot;Variety&quot; magazine said in 1956 that his Chaplinesque quality made a big contribution to the success of the film. The film ultimately made an unadjusted $42 million at the box office (over $678 million in 2018 dollars). While David Niven was billed as the lead in English-speaking nations, Cantinflas was billed as the lead elsewhere. As a result of the film, Cantinflas became the world&#x27;s highest-paid actor.

Moreno&#x27;s second Hollywood feature, &quot;Pepe&quot;, attempted to replicate the success of his first. The film had cameo appearances by Frank Sinatra, Judy Garland, Maurice Chevalier, Shirley Jones, Ricardo Montalbán, James Coburn, Debbie Reynolds, César Romero, and other stars. His humor, deeply rooted in the Spanish language, did not translate well for the American audience and the movie&#x27;s reception was a failure. He still earned a Golden Globe nomination for his part. Later in a 1992 American interview, Moreno cited the language barrier as the biggest impediment to his making it big in the United States.

After returning to Mexico, Cantinflas starred in the comic drama &quot;El bolero de Raquel&quot; (1957), the first Cantinflas film to be distributed to the United States by Columbia Pictures. The film was followed by more Cantinflas-Reachi-Columbia productions: &quot;El analfabeto&quot; (1961), &quot;El padrecito&quot; (1963), and &quot;Su excelencia&quot; (1967). After &quot;Su excelencia&quot;, Cantinflas began to appear in a series of very low-budget comedies directed by Miguel M. Delgado, which were produced by his own company &quot;Cantinflas Films&quot;. These films lasted until &quot;El Barrendero&quot;, in 1982.
Like Charlie Chaplin, Cantinflas was a social satirist. He played &quot;el pelado&quot;, an impoverished Everyman, with hopes to succeed. With mutual admiration, Cantinflas was influenced by Chaplin&#x27;s earlier films and ideology. &quot;El Circo&quot; (the circus) was a &quot;shadow&quot; of Chaplin&#x27;s silent film, &quot;The Circus&quot; and &quot;Si yo fuera diputado&quot; (&quot;If I Were a Congressman&quot;) had many similarities with the 1940 film, &quot;The Great Dictator&quot;. Cantinflas&#x27; films, to this day, still generate revenue for Columbia Pictures. In 2000, Columbia reported in an estimated US$4 million in foreign distribution from the films.

== Death ==
A lifelong smoker, Cantinflas died of lung cancer on 20 April 1993 in Mexico City. Thousands appeared on a rainy day for his funeral. The ceremony was a national event, lasting three days. He was honored by many heads of state and the United States Senate, which held a moment of silence for him. His ashes lay at the crypt of the Moreno Reyes family, in the &quot;Panteón Español&quot; (&quot;Spanish Cemetery&quot;) in Mexico City.

A 20-year legal battle followed between Mario Moreno Ivanova, Cantinflas&#x27; son and heir to his estate, and the actor&#x27;s blood nephew Eduardo Moreno Laparade over the control of 34 films made by Cantinflas. The nephew claimed his uncle gave him a written notice, Moreno Ivanova argued that he was the direct heir of Cantinflas and that the rights belonged to him. In 2014, Eduardo Moreno Laparade won the rights at the Mexican Supreme Court to 39 films and the name. 
At the same time, there was another legal battle between Columbia Pictures and Moreno Ivanova over control of these films. Columbia claimed that it had bought the rights to the 34 films four decades earlier, although the court noted several discrepancies in the papers. Moreno Ivanova wanted the rights to the films to remain his, and more generally Mexico&#x27;s, as a national treasure. On 2 June 2001 the eight-year battle was resolved with Columbia retaining ownership over the 34 disputed films.

== Career ==

Among the things that endeared him to his public was his comic use of language in his films; his characters (all of which were really variations of the main &quot;Cantinflas&quot; persona but cast in different social roles and circumstances) would strike up a normal conversation and then complicate it to the point where no one understood what they were talking about. The Cantinflas character was particularly adept at obfuscating the conversation when he owed somebody money, was courting an attractive young woman, or was trying to talk his way out of trouble with authorities, whom he managed to humiliate without their even being able to tell. This manner of talking became known as &quot;Cantinflear&quot;, and it became common parlance for Spanish speakers to say &quot;¡estás cantinfleando!&quot; (loosely translated as you&#x27;re pulling a &quot;Cantinflas!&quot; or you&#x27;re &quot;Cantinflassing!&quot;) whenever someone became hard to understand in conversation. The Real Academia Española officially included the verb, &quot;cantinflear&quot;, &quot;cantinflas&quot; and &quot;cantinflada&quot; in its dictionary in 1992.

In the visual arts, Mexican artists such as Rufino Tamayo and Diego Rivera painted Cantinflas as a symbol of the Mexican everyman.

Cantinflas&#x27; style and the content of his films have led scholars to conclude that he influenced the many &quot;teatros&quot; that spread the message of the Chicano Movement during the 1960s-1970s in the United States, the most important of which was El Teatro Campesino. The &quot;teatro&quot; movement was an important part of the cultural renaissance that was the social counterpart of the political movement for the civil rights of Mexican Americans. Cantinflas&#x27; use of social themes and style is seen as a precursor to Chicano theater.

A cartoon series, the &quot;Cantinflas Show&quot;, was made in 1972 starring an animated Cantinflas. The show was targeted for children and was intended to be educational. The first animated version animated by Santiago Moro and his brother Jose Luis Moro for Televisa in the early 1970s (Cantinflas Show) which educated children by meeting such notable people as Chopin, Louis Pasteur, Albert Einstein and William Shakespeare&#x27;s Romeo and Juliet as well learning how important water and oil is and educational parodies of some of his famous movies like &quot;Su Excelencia&quot; [La Carta with incidental music from Aaron Copland&#x27;s &quot;El Salón México&quot;] In the second version his character was known as &quot;Little Amigo&quot; and concentrated on a wide range of subjects intended to educate children, from the origin of soccer to the reasons behind the International Date Line. The second animated series animated in 1979 and dubbed in English in 1982 was a joint venture between Televisa and Hanna-Barbera and Mario Moreno voiced &quot;Little Amigo&quot;/Cantinflas in the Spanish version and Don Messick voiced &quot;Little Amigo&quot; and John Stephenson as the narrator in the English version. Both The Cantinflas Show and Amigos and Friends aired in the mid 1990s on Univision and Televisa re aired The Cantinflas Show in the mid 1990s.

Although Cantinflas never achieved the same success in the United States as in Mexico, he was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6438 Hollywood Boulevard on October 10, 1980. He earned two Golden Globe nominations (winning one) for best actor and the Mexican Academy of Film Lifetime Achievement Award. His handprints have been imbedded onto the Paseo de las Luminarias for his work in motion pictures.

The Mario Moreno &quot;Cantinflas&quot; Award is handed out annually for entertainers who &quot;represent the Latino community with the same humor and distinction as the legendary Mario Moreno &quot;Cantinflas&quot; and who, like Cantinflas, utilizes his power to help those most in need&quot;.

On August 12, 2018, the Google Doodle paid homage to Cantinflas on his 107th birth anniversary.

=== Characterizations ===
Moreno&#x27;s life is the subject of the biographical film &quot;Cantinflas&quot; (2014, directed by Sebastian del Amo). It stars Óscar Jaenada, who portrays a young Mario Moreno attempting to gain respect and make a living as an actor, and award-winning actor Michael Imperioli as Mike Todd, an American film-producer struggling to film his masterpiece.
The film is centered in Moreno&#x27;s personal life, and in the development of Todd&#x27;s Golden Globe Award-winning 1956 film &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot;.

== Critical response ==

Cantinflas is sometimes seen as a Mexican Groucho Marx character, one who uses his skill with words to puncture the pretensions of the wealthy and powerful, the police and the government, with the difference that he strongly supported democracy. Historian and author of &quot;Cantinflas and the Chaos of Mexican Modernity&quot;, writes, &quot;Cantinflas symbolized the underdog who triumphed through trickery over more powerful opponents&quot; and presents Cantinflas as a self-image of a transitional Mexico. Gregorio Luke, executive director of the Museum of Latin American Art said, &quot;To understand Cantinflas is to understand what happened in Mexico during the last century&quot;.

Monsiváis interprets Moreno&#x27;s portrayals in terms of the importance of the spoken word in the context of Mexico&#x27;s &quot;reigning illiteracy&quot; (70% in 1930). Particularly in the film &quot;El analfabeto&quot;, (&quot;The Illiterate&quot;), &quot;Cantinflas is the illiterate who takes control of the language by whatever means he can&quot;.

The writer Salvador Novo interpreted the role of Moreno&#x27;s character entirely in terms of &quot;Cantinflismo&quot;: &quot;&quot;En condensarlos: en entregar a la saludable carcajada del pueblo la esencia demagógica de su vacuo confusionismo, estriba el mérito y se asegura la gloria de este hijo cazurro de la ciudad ladina y burlona de México, que es &#x27;Cantinflas&quot;&#x27;&quot;. (&quot;In condensing them [the leaders of the world and of Mexico], in returning to the healthy laughter of the people the demagogic essence of their empty confusion, merit is sustained and glory is ensured for the self-contained son of the Spanish-speaking mocker of Mexico, who Cantinflas portrays.&quot;)

In his biography of the comic, scholar of Mexican culture Jeffrey M. Pilcher views Cantinflas as a metaphor for &quot;the chaos of Mexican modernity&quot;, a modernity that was just out of reach for the majority of Mexicans: &quot;His nonsense language eloquently expressed the contradictions of modernity as &#x27;the palpitating moment of everything that wants to be that which it cannot be&#x27;.&quot; Likewise, &quot;Social hierarchies, speech patterns, ethnic identities, and masculine forms of behavior all crumbled before his chaotic humor, to be reformulated in revolutionary new ways.&quot;

<doc id="151518" wikidata="Q56973" url="?curid=151518" title="Josep Tarradellas Barcelona–El Prat Airport">
<text>Josep Tarradellas Barcelona–El Prat Airport (Catalan: &quot;Aeroport Josep Tarradellas Barcelona-El Prat&quot;, Spanish: &quot;Aeropuerto Josep Tarradellas Barcelona-El Prat&quot;), and also known as Barcelona-El Prat Airport, is an international airport located southwest of the centre of Barcelona, lying in the municipalities of El Prat de Llobregat, Viladecans, and Sant Boi, in Catalonia, Spain.

It is the second-largest and second-busiest airport in Spain, the busiest international airport of Catalonia (largely surpassing Girona, Reus and Lleida), and the sixth busiest in Europe. In 2019, Barcelona Airport handled a record 52,686,314 passengers, up 5.0% from 2018. It is a hub for Level and Vueling, and a focus city for Air Europa, Iberia, EasyJet and Ryanair.

The Barcelona–Madrid air shuttle service, known as &quot;Pont Aeri&quot; (in Catalan) or &quot;Puente Aéreo&quot; (in Spanish), literally &quot;Air Bridge&quot;, was the world&#x27;s busiest route until 2008, with the highest number of flight operations (971 per week) in 2007. The schedule has been reduced since February 2008, when a Madrid–Barcelona high-speed rail line was opened, covering the distance in 2 hours 30 minutes, and quickly became popular.

The airport was renamed by the central Government of Spain to its current name on 21 December 2018 in honour of the first Catalan president under the current Spanish Constitution, Josep Tarradellas - a move widely criticised by the Generalitat de Catalunya and separatists due to non-consultation.

==History==
===Foundation and early years===
Barcelona&#x27;s first airfield, located at El Remolar, began operations in 1916. However, it did not have good expansion prospects, so a new airport at El Prat opened in 1918. The first plane was a Latécoère Salmson 300 which arrived from Toulouse with final destination Casablanca. The airport was used as headquarters of the Aeroclub of Catalonia and the base for the Spanish Navy&#x27;s Zeppelin fleet. Scheduled commercial service began in 1927 with an Iberia service to Madrid Cuatro Vientos Airport. This was Iberia&#x27;s first route. During the time of the Second Spanish Republic El Prat was one of the bases of LAPE &quot;(Líneas Aéreas Postales Españolas)&quot;.

In 1948, a runway was built (now called runway 07-25); in the same year the first overseas service was operated by Pan American World Airways to New York City, using a Lockheed Constellation. Between 1948 and 1952, a second runway was constructed (runway 16–34), perpendicular to the previous, also taxiways were constructed and a terminal to accommodate passengers. In 1963, the airport reached one million passengers a year. A new control tower was built in 1965. In 1968, a new terminal was opened, which still exists and is in use as what is now Terminal 2B.

On 3 August 1970, Pan American World Airways inaugurated regular service between Barcelona, Lisbon and New York, operated by a Boeing 747. On 4 November of the same year, Iberia began the &quot;Air-shuttle&quot; service between Barcelona and Madrid–Barajas. A few years later, in 1976, a terminal was built specifically for Iberia&#x27;s air-shuttle service and a terminal exclusively for cargo, an annexed mail service and an aircraft ramp for air cargo. In 1977, the airport handled over 5 million passengers annually. 

From the late seventies to the early nineties, the airport was stalled in traffic and investments until the 1992 Summer Olympics held in Barcelona. El Prat underwent a major development consisting of the modernization and expansion of the existing terminal, which became known as Terminal B, and the construction of two further terminals flanking that, known as Terminals A and C respectively.

===Development since 2010===
The new Terminal 1 was inaugurated on 16 June 2009, covering . 70% of today&#x27;s flights operate from Terminal 1. The old Terminals A, B and C are now known as Terminals 2A, 2B and 2C.

Due to the strong drop in air traffic after 1999 and the crisis in the aviation sector in 2001 many charter operations from Girona and Reus were diverted to El Prat, which helped the airport to survive the crisis.

On 1 February 2014, Barcelona–El Prat was the first Spanish airport to receive a daily flight with the Airbus A380-800, on the Emirates route to Dubai International Airport. Emirates also offers a second daily flight, also operated by the A380-800.

International Airlines Group (IAG) announced in December 2016 flights from Barcelona to the US, Latin America and Asia for the summer of 2017. IAG, formed by British Airways, Iberia, Vueling and Aer Lingus, created Level, the second airline, after Norwegian, launching low-cost long haul flights from the Catalan city. They announced flights from June 2017 to Los Angeles, Oakland, Punta Cana and Buenos Aires.

On 14 October 2019, the airport was the first target of protesters after the sentencing of the trial of Catalonia independence leaders. In the morning, called upon by Democratic Tsunami thousands flocked all the accesses and concourses disrupting normal operations. Catalan Police ordered the closing of all transportation services (bus, Metro and Rail) to avoid further arrivals of demonstrators. The blockade of the main access road (C-32 highway) with people walking between the terminals and city center made Taxi and other services unavailable. Deployment of riot police from Civil Guard, National Police and Mossos d&#x27;Esquadra to evict protesters lead to massive confrontations leaving dozens injured. Using social media the organizers called off the action by night time but disruption continued. More than a hundred flights were cancelled during the 14th of October and twenty more were announced for the next day by the main operator, Vueling.

==Operations==

===Airlines===
Most of the traffic at Barcelona Airport is domestic and European, in which Vueling has an operational base. Intercontinental connections have not generated a significant amount of passenger traffic during the last years. In the early twenty-first century the airport passenger carried numbers and the number of operations increased significantly.

Low-cost airline traffic grew significantly, especially after the creation of operating bases by Vueling and Clickair at the airport. Vueling and Clickair merged in July 2009, operating under the Vueling name. Other low-cost airlines operate from the airport, including Ryanair, EasyJet, Norwegian Air International, EasyJet Switzerland, Wizz Air and Transavia. A new base was established at the airport in September 2010.

===Infrastructure===
The airport has 3 runways, two parallel, nominated 06L/24R and 06R/24L (the latter opened in 2004), and a cross runway 02/20. There are two terminals: T2, which is the sum of the previous Terminals A, B and C, located on the north side of the airport and T1, on the west side, which opened on 16 June 2009. the two terminals had a combined total of 268 check-in counters and 64 boarding gates. Operations at the airport are restricted exclusively to Instrument flight rules (IFR) flights, except for sanitary, emergency and government VFR flights.

A plan for expansion (Plan Barcelona) was completed in 2009, adding a third terminal building (also designed by Ricardo Bofill) and control tower. An additional runway (07R/25L) was also built. The airport became capable of handling 55 million passengers annually (up from 33 million in 2007). The airport expanded in area from . Further expansion was planned to be finished by 2012, with a new satellite terminal to raise capacity to 70 million passengers annually, this is better explained in Terminal T1 section.

==Terminals==

===Terminal 1===

A new Terminal 1, designed by Ricardo Bofill Taller de Arquitectura was inaugurated on 16 June 2009. The airport terminal has an area of , an aircraft ramp of , 13,000 new parking spaces and 45 new gates expandable to 60. This terminal is also capable of handling large aircraft like the Airbus A380-800 or Boeing 747-8I.

The terminal handles both Schengen and non-Schengen flights. It is split into 5 Modules with Module A handling flights to Madrid, Module B handling Schengen flights, Module C handling Air Nostrum flights, Module D handling non-Schengen European flights and Module E handling non-Schengen non-European flights.

Its facilities include:
* 258 check-in counters
* 60 jetways (some are prepared for the A380, with double jetways)
* 15 baggage carousels (one new carousel is equivalent to four carousels in the old terminal)
* 12,000 parking spaces, in addition to the 12,000 already in terminal 2

The forecast is that the airport will be able to handle 55 million passengers annually —as opposed to the 30 million people before its construction— and will reach 90 operations an hour.

The extension of the airport with a total investment of €5.1 billion in the future will include a new satellite terminal and refurbishment of existing terminals. The civil engineering phase of the South Terminal had a budget of €1 billion.

It is also planned the construction of a satellite terminal —T1S or Terminal 1 Satèl·lit, in Catalan— considering that the airport is on the verge of overcrowding because terminals cannot handle all passengers because of space shortage. This terminal will be at 1,5 kilometres from the current T1 terminal, behind the 02-20, transversal, runway. With this action, the airport will be able to increase its passenger capacity to 70 million people annually.

There are two lounges located in Terminal 1.

===Terminal 2===
Terminal 2 is divided into three linked sections, known as Terminal 2A, 2B and 2C. Terminal 2B is the oldest part of the complex still in use, dating back to 1968. Terminals 2A and 2C were added in order to expand the airport capacity before the arrival of the 1992 Summer Olympics held in the city. This expansion was also designed by Ricardo Bofill.

This terminal is mostly occupied by low-cost airlines, although there are some full-service airlines which also use this terminal.

Following the opening of Terminal 1 in 2009, Terminal 2 became almost empty until the airport authorities lowered landing fees to attract low-cost and regional carriers to fill the terminal. Whilst this has helped, the complex is nowhere near full capacity and Terminal 2A is currently unused for departures. Terminal 2C is used only by EasyJet and EasyJet Switzerland flights, with flights to the UK and other non-Schengen destinations using gates M, whilst flights to destinations in the Schengen area use gates R. Terminal 2B is mostly used by Ryanair and others, like Transavia. And T2A is adapted for large airplanes, such as B777. The terminal is also split into gate areas, where flights to Schengen destinations use gates U and flights to non Schengen destinations use gates W and Y.

==Airlines and destinations==
The following airlines operate regular scheduled flights to and from Barcelona:

==Ground transportation==
===Rail===
====Train====
Terminal 2 has a Rodalies Barcelona commuter train station (on Line R2), with services every 30 minutes towards to Maçanet-Massanes, serving several stations in Barcelona City Centre including Barcelona Sants and Passeig de Gràcia, providing connections with the Barcelona Metro system and national and international high speed rail services. Rail passengers for Terminal 1 must take a connecting bus from Terminal 2B to Terminal 1. 

As part of the major aforementioned airport expansion, a new shuttle train is being built to directly connect Terminal 1 to Barcelona Sants and Passeig de Gràcia, providing quicker and more frequent journeys between the airport and city centre. As of November 2023, this new line it is expected to be operational some time in 2026, six years later than originally anticipated.
====Metro====
Also this airport is linked to Barcelona by underground (metro) since 12 February 2016 by Line 9 of the Barcelona Metro with a station in each terminal, the Aeroport T1 station situated directly underneath the airport terminal T1 and the Aeroport T2 station close to the Aeroport rail station at the terminal T2. The line connects with several Barcelona Metro lines to the city center.
===Road===
The C-32B highway connects the airport to a main traffic interchange between Barcelona&#x27;s Ronda de Dalt beltway and major motorways. There is provision for parking cars at the airport, with about 24,000 parking spaces.

===Bus===
The Transports Metropolitans de Barcelona (TMB) public bus line 46 runs from Paral·lel Avenue. The &quot;Aerobús&quot; offers direct transfers from T1 and T2 to the city center at Plaça Catalunya. Another company offers transfers from Barcelona Airport to nearest airports like Reus Airport or Girona–Costa Brava, provincial and national capitals and links with France or Andorra.

=== Ride-hailing ===
Since 2024, the Estonian ride-hailing company Bolt has operated exclusive pickup areas at the airport.

==Incidents and accidents==

* On 16 May 1940, a Ala Littoria Savoia-Marchetti SM.75 Marsupiale crashed during takeoff because a ladder in the cargo compartment moved during takeoff and jammed the controls. All 8 occupants were killed.
* On 14 April 1958, an Aviaco de Havilland Heron crashed into the sea on approach to the airport because of a loss of control to avoid another aircraft taking off from BCN. All 2 crew and 14 passengers were killed.
* On 8 November 1960, an Iberia Airlines Lockheed 1049 Super Constellation (leased from TWA) was on final approach when the left main gear struck a small heap of rubbish short of the runway threshold, tearing off the wheels, the plane continued along the runway and swerved to the left and caught fire. All 71 passengers and crew survived, but the aircraft was written off.
* On 22 November 1974, a Cessna Citation I operated by &quot;Alpa Servicios Aereos&quot; crashed E of Barcelona Airport into the sea because of loss of control of the aircraft. All 3 occupants died.
* On 19 February 1998, both occupants died in an Ibertrans Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner plane crash in the borough of Gavà shortly after taking off from El Prat.
* On 28 July 1998, a Swiftair Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner crashed on approach, killing both crew members, because of speed reduction at low height, improper flap setting, and a feathered right propeller.

<doc id="151524" wikidata="Q127664" url="?curid=151524" title="Febrile seizure">
<text>A febrile seizure, also known as a fever fit or febrile convulsion, is a seizure associated with a high body temperature but without any serious underlying health issue. They most commonly occur in children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years. Most seizures are less than five minutes in duration, and the child is completely back to normal within an hour of the event. There are two types: simple febrile seizures and complex febrile seizures. Simple febrile seizures involve an otherwise healthy child who has at most one tonic-clonic seizure lasting less than 15 minutes in a 24-hour period. Complex febrile seizures have focal symptoms, last longer than 15 minutes, or occur more than once within 24 hours. About 80% are classified as simple febrile seizures.
Febrile seizures are triggered by fever, typically due to a viral infection. They may run in families. The underlying mechanism is not fully known, but it is thought to involve genetics, environmental factors, brain immaturity, and inflammatory mediators. The diagnosis involves verifying that there is not an infection of the brain, there are no metabolic problems, and there have not been prior seizures that have occurred without a fever. Blood testing, imaging of the brain, or an electroencephalogram (EEG) is typically not needed. Examination to determine the source of the fever is recommended. In otherwise healthy-looking children a lumbar puncture is not necessarily required.
Neither anti-seizure medication nor anti-fever medication are recommended in an effort to prevent further simple febrile seizures. In the few cases that last greater than 5 minutes, a benzodiazepine such as lorazepam or midazolam may be used. Efforts to rapidly cool during a seizure is not recommended.
Febrile seizures affect 2–10% of children. They are more common in boys than girls. After a single febrile seizure there is an approximately 35% chance of having another one during childhood. Outcomes are generally excellent with similar academic achievements to other children and no change in the risk of death for those with simple seizures. There is tentative evidence that affected children have a slightly increased risk of epilepsy at 2% compared to the general population.

==Signs and symptoms==
Signs and symptoms depend on if the febrile seizure is simple versus complex. In general, the child&#x27;s temperature is greater than , although most have a fever of 39 °C (102.2 °F) or higher. Most febrile seizures will occur during the first 24 hours of developing a fever. Signs of typical seizure activity include loss of consciousness, opened eyes which may be deviated or appear to be looking towards one direction, irregular breathing, increased secretions or foaming at the mouth, and the child may look pale or blue (cyanotic). They may become incontinent (wet or soil themselves) and may also vomit.

=== Types ===
There are two types of febrile seizures: simple and complex. Febrile status epilepticus is a subtype of complex febrile seizures that lasts for longer than 30 minutes. It can occur in up to 5% of febrile seizure cases. 
==Causes==

Febrile seizures are due to fevers, usually those greater than . The cause of the fevers is often a viral illness. The likelihood of a febrile seizure is related to how high the temperature reaches. Some feel that the rate of increase is not important while others feel the rate of increase is a risk factor. This latter position has not been proven.

In children, illnesses that often cause a fever include middle ear infections and viral upper respiratory infections. Other infections associated with febrile seizures include Shigellosis, Salmonellosis, and Roseola. Although the exact mechanism is unknown, it is speculated that these infections may affect the brain directly or via a neurotoxin leading to seizures.

There is a small chance of a febrile seizure after certain vaccines. The risk is only slightly increased for a few days after receiving one of the implicated vaccines during the time when the child is likely to develop a fever as a natural immune response. Implicated vaccines include:

* measles/mumps/rubella/varicella
* combined diphtheria/tetanus/acellular pertussis/polio/&quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot; type b 
* diphtheria-tetanus-whole-cell pertussis, which is not used in North America anymore
* some versions of the pneumococcal vaccine
* some types of inactivated influenza vaccine

It was previously thought that febrile seizures were more likely to occur with the combined MMRV vaccine, but recent studies have found there to be no significant increase. Overall, febrile seizures triggered by vaccines are uncommon. Children who have a genetic predisposition towards febrile seizures are more likely to have one after vaccination.

The seizures occur, by definition, without an intracranial infection or metabolic problems. They run in families with reported family history in approximately 33% of people. Several genetic associations have been identified, including GEFS+ and Dravet Syndrome. Possible modes of inheritance for genetic predisposition to febrile seizures include autosomal dominance with reduced penetrance and polygenic multifactorial inheritance. An association with iron deficiency has also been reported, particularly in the developing world.

== Mechanism ==
The exact underlying mechanism of febrile seizures is still unknown, but it is thought to be multi-factorial involving genetic and environmental factors. Speculation includes immaturity of the central nervous system at younger ages, making the brain more vulnerable to the effects of fever. The increased activity of neurons during rapid brain development, may help explain why children, particularly younger than age 3, are prone to febrile seizures, with occurrences decreasing after age 5. Other proposed mechanisms include the interactions of inflammatory mediators, particularly cytokines, which are released during a fever, causing elevated temperatures in the brain, which may somehow lead to a seizure. Specific cytokines implicated include elevated CSF IL-1β and serum IL-6.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis is made by eliminating more serious causes of seizure and fever: in particular, meningitis and encephalitis. However, in children who are immunized against pneumococcal and &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot;, the risk of bacterial meningitis is low. If a child has recovered and is acting normally, bacterial meningitis is very unlikely, making further procedures such as a lumbar puncture unnecessary.

Diagnosis involves gathering a detailed history including the value of highest temperature recorded, timing of seizure and fever, seizure characteristics, time to return to baseline, vaccination history, illness exposures, family history, etc.; and performing a physical exam that looks for signs of infection including meningitis and neurological status. Blood tests, imaging of the brain and an electroencephalogram are generally not needed. However, for complex febrile seizures, EEG and imaging with an MRI of the brain may be helpful.

Lumbar puncture is recommended if there are obvious signs and symptoms of meningitis or if there is high clinical suspicion. However, lumbar puncture is an option that may be considered in children younger than 12 months of age since signs and symptoms of meningitis may be atypical, if the child does not return to baseline, or if the child lacks immunization against &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot; and pneumococcal or vaccination status is unknown.

Differential diagnosis includes other causes of seizures such as CNS infections (i.e. meningitis, encephalitis), metabolic disturbances (i.e. electrolyte imbalances), CNS trauma, drug use and/or withdrawal, genetic conditions (i.e. GEFS+), FIRES, shivering, febrile delirium, febrile myoclonus, breath holding spells, and convulsive syncope. However, febrile seizures are still the most likely cause of convulsions in children under the age of 5 years old.

==Prevention==
There is no benefit from the use of phenytoin, valproate, ibuprofen, diclofenac, acetaminophen, pyridoxine, or zinc sulfate. There is no evidence to support administering fever reducing medications such as acetaminophen at the time of a febrile seizure or to prevent the rate of recurrence. Rapid cooling methods such as an ice bath or a cold bath should be avoided as a method to lower the child&#x27;s temperature, especially during a febrile seizure.

There is a decrease of recurrent febrile seizures with intermittent diazepam and phenobarbital but there is a high rate of adverse effects. They are thus not recommended as an effort to prevent further seizures.

==Treatment ==

If a child is having a febrile seizure, the following recommendations are made for caregivers:

*Note the start time of the seizure. If the seizure lasts longer than 5 minutes, call an ambulance. Medication to stop seizure, such as rectal diazepam or intranasal midazolam may be used. The child should be taken immediately to the nearest medical facility for further diagnosis and treatment. 
*Gradually place the child on a protected surface such as the floor or ground to prevent accidental injury. Do not restrain or hold a child during a convulsion.
*Position the child on his or her side or stomach to prevent choking. When possible, gently remove any objects from the child&#x27;s mouth. Nothing should ever be placed in the child&#x27;s mouth during a convulsion. These objects can obstruct the child&#x27;s airway and make breathing difficult.
*Seek immediate medical attention if this is the child&#x27;s first febrile seizure and take the child to the doctor once the seizure has ended to check for the cause of the fever. This is especially urgent if the child shows symptoms of stiff neck, extreme lethargy, or abundant vomiting, which may be signs of meningitis, an infection over the brain surface.

In those with a single seizure lasting greater than 5 minutes or two consecutive seizures lasting greater than 5 minutes in which the person has not returned to their baseline mental status, defined as status epilepticus, intravenous lorazepam, rectal diazepam, or intranasal midazolam is recommended. Anti-seizure medication are used in status epilepticus in an effort to prevent complications such as injury to the hippocampus or temporal lobe epilepsy.

Secondary causes of a seizure should be addressed if present. Questions that may be asked of the caregivers who witnessed the seizure include the length of the seizure, the timing of the day, loss of consciousness, loss of bowel or urinary continence, a period of altered level of consciousness or confusion once the seizure stopped, movement of the eyes to a specific side, recent infections, recent medication usage including antibiotics or fever reducer medications, family history of febrile and afebrile seizures, vaccination and travel history.

Vital signs should be monitored in the emergency department along with observation for 6 hours. Evaluation for the cause of fever should be performed including signs of an infection such as a bulging tympanic membrane (otitis media), red pharynx, enlarged tonsils, enlarged cervical lymph nodes (streptococcal pharyngitis or infectious mononucleosis), and a widespread rash. CNS infections such as meningitis, encephalitis and brain abscesses should be ruled out, along with electrolyte abnormalities.

==Prognosis==
Long term outcomes are generally good with little risk of neurological problems or epilepsy. Those who have one febrile seizure have an approximately 30- 40% chance of having another one in the next two years, with the risk being greater in those who are younger.

Simple febrile seizures do not tend to recur frequently (children tend to outgrow them) and do not make the development of adult epilepsy significantly more likely (about 3–5%) compared with the general public (1%). Children with febrile convulsions are more likely to have a febrile seizure in the future if they were young at their first seizure (less than 18 months old), have a family history of a febrile convulsions in first-degree relatives (a parent or sibling), have a short time between the onset of fever and the seizure, had a low degree of fever before their seizure, or have a seizure history of abnormal neurological signs or developmental delay. Similarly, the prognosis after a complex febrile seizure is excellent, although an increased risk of death has been shown for complex febrile seizures, partly related to underlying conditions.

==Epidemiology==
Febrile seizures happen between the ages of 6 months and 5 years. The peak age for a febrile seizure is 18 months, with the most common age range being 12–30 months of age. They affect between 2-5% of children. They are more common in boys than girls. Febrile seizures can occur in any ethnic group, although there have been higher rates in Guamanians (14%), Japanese (6-9%) and Indians (5-10%).

<text>Bernard Bresslaw (25 February 193411 June 1993) was an English actor and comedian. He was best known as a member of the &quot;Carry On&quot; film franchise. Bresslaw also worked on television and stage, performed recordings and wrote a series of poetry.

==Early life==
Bernard Bresslaw was born the youngest of three boys into a Jewish family in Stepney, London, on 25 February 1934. His father was a tailor&#x27;s cutter. He attended the Coopers&#x27; Company&#x27;s School in Tredegar Square, Bow, London, and became interested in acting after visits to the Hackney Empire. 

London County Council awarded him a scholarship to train at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, where he won the Emile Littler Award as the most promising actor.

==Career==
After &quot;Educating Archie&quot; on radio and &quot;The Army Game&quot; on television, more television, film and Shakespearean theatre roles followed. His first &quot;Carry On&quot; film was &quot;Carry On Cowboy&quot; in 1965.

Bresslaw&#x27;s catchphrase, in his strong Cockney accent, was &quot;I only arsked&quot; (sic), first used in &quot;The Army Game&quot;, and later revived in &quot;Carry On Camping&quot; (1969). 

At 6 ft 7 in (2.01 m), he was the tallest of the &quot;Carry On&quot; cast, head and shoulders over fellow &quot;Carry On&quot; regular Barbara Windsor, who was . Because of his height, he was briefly considered for the part of the Creature in Hammer&#x27;s &quot;Curse of Frankenstein&quot; (1957), which ultimately went instead to Christopher Lee. Bresslaw later made a comedy version of &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; for Hammer titled &quot;The Ugly Duckling&quot; (1959). He made great efforts to prepare for roles, for example learning Fanagalo phrases for &quot;Carry On Up the Jungle&quot; (1970).

Bresslaw played Varga, the lead villain in the 1967 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story &quot;The Ice Warriors&quot;. He also played the genie on the &quot;Sooty Show&quot; and voiced Gorilla on &quot;The Giddy Game Show&quot;.

Between 1985 and 1987, Bresslaw provided the voice of Gorilla in Yorkshire TV&#x27;s animated series &quot;The Giddy Game Show&quot;.

===Stage actor===
Bresslaw performed with The English Stage Company, the Royal Shakespeare Company, the Young Vic and the Chichester Festival Theatre. One of his last stage performances was as Malvolio in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; at the Open Air Theatre, Regent&#x27;s Park (1990).

Bresslaw&#x27;s other roles included playing Mephistopheles, alongside James Warwick in the title role, in an Oxford Stage Company regional touring production of &quot;Doctor Faustus&quot; in 1987, and the genie in the lamp in &quot;Aladdin&quot; at the Theatre Royal, Newcastle, in the 1990s.

===Song===
Bresslaw&#x27;s song &quot;You Need Feet&quot; (a parody of &quot;You Need Hands&quot; by Max Bygraves) was used in the Rutles&#x27; TV special, accompanying the Yoko Ono film parody &quot;A Thousand Feet of Film&quot;. This was cut from the syndicated version and the original DVD release, but was restored (along with other cut footage) in later DVD releases.

===BT adverts===
Bresslaw, together with Miriam Margolyes, appeared with English comedienne Maureen Lipman in a series of British Telecom advertisements in the late 1980s. Bresslaw and Margolyes played Gerald and Dolly, a nervous couple who drop in unannounced on Lipman&#x27;s character Beatrice &quot;Beattie&quot; Bellman and her husband Harry.

===Poetry===
Bresslaw was the author of a privately published volume of poetry, &quot;Ode to the Dead Sea Scrolls&quot;.

<doc id="151530" wikidata="Q1014420" url="?curid=151530" title="Wuchang, Wuhan">
<text>Wuchang is one of 13 urban districts of the prefecture-level city of Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province, China. It is the oldest of the three cities that merged into modern-day Wuhan, and stood on the right (southeastern) bank of the Yangtze River, opposite the mouth of the Han River. The two other cities, Hanyang and Hankou, were on the left (northwestern) bank, separated from each other by the Han River.

The name &quot;Wuchang&quot; remains in common use for the part of urban Wuhan south of the Yangtze River. Administratively, however, it is split between several districts of the City of Wuhan. The historic center of Wuchang lies within the modern Wuchang District, which has an area of and a population of 1,102,188. Other parts of what is colloquially known as Wuchang are within Hongshan District (south and south-east) and Qingshan District (north-east). Presently, on the right bank of the Yangtze, it borders the districts of Qingshan (for a very small section) to the northeast and Hongshan to the east and south; on the opposite bank it borders Jiang&#x27;an, Jianghan and Hanyang.

On 10 October 1911, the New Army stationed in the city started the Wuchang Uprising, a turning point of the Xinhai Revolution that overthrew the Qing dynasty and established the Republic of China.

==History==
===The old Wuchang county===
In 221, warlord Sun Quan moved the capital of Eastern Wu from Gong&#x27;an county, Jingzhou (northwest of present-day Gong&#x27;an county, Hubei) to È county (in present-day Ezhou City), and renamed È to Wuchang (literally &quot;prospering from military&quot;, regarding its logistics role of the military bases established before the Battle of Red Cliffs). Later in the year Cao Pi proclaimed himself the emperor of Cao Wei. Sun Quan declared independence in the following year, and started to build forts and palaces in Wuchang. Sun Quan proclaimed himself the emperor of Eastern Wu in 229, and moved the capital to Jianye. Sun Hao, the emperor of Eastern Wu between 264 and 280, moved the capital back to Wuchang in 265. In 589, the Wuchang commandery was abolished and the Wuchang county was transferred to a new commandery named Ezhou (headquartered in present-day Wuchang District), and remained in the administration since then.

===The present day Wuchang town===
The Wuchang commandery was set up when È was renamed to Wuchang, and included six counties. In 223 the commandery was renamed to Jiangxia, and the capital of the commandery moved to Xiakou (in present-day Wuchang town). The name of the town was switched back and forth between Wuchang and Jiangxia several times in the following centuries. The present-day version of Wuying Pagoda, the oldest standing architecture in Hubei Province, was built around the time of fall of the Southern Song Dynasty. After 1301, the Wuchang prefecture, headquartered in the town, became the capital of Hubei province.

During the Taiping Rebellion, Wuchang and the surrounding area changed hands several times after the Taiping capture of the city in the Battle of Wuchang (1852).

At the end of the Qing Empire, the Wuchang Prefecture (, then transcribed as &#x27;Ou-tchang-fou&#x27;) was the capital of the combined provinces of Hubei and Hunan, called the &#x27;two Hu&#x27; or &quot;Huguang Viceroyalty&quot;. It was the seat of the provincial government of Huguang, at the head of which was a viceroy of Huguang. Next to Nanjing and Guangzhou, it was one of the most important vice-royalties in the empire.

It possessed an arsenal and a mint. The provincial government established ironworks for the manufacture of rails and other railway material. As the works did not pay under official management, they were transferred to the director-general of railways. Wuchang was not open to foreign trade and residence, but a considerable number of missionaries, both Roman Catholic and Protestant, lived within the walls. The native population was estimated at 800,000 around 1911, including cities on both banks. At that time, Wuchang was an important junction on the trunk railway from Beijing to Guangzhou; and was on the route of the Sichuan railway.

In Wuchang on October 10, 1911, a revolt broke out against the Qing Dynasty. This event, now called the Wuchang Uprising and celebrated as Double Ten Day, was the catalyst that started the Xinhai Revolution, which led to the development of the Republic of China.

In 1912, the Wuchang prefecture was abolished and a new Wuchang county (just next to the Wuchang county in the Ezhou city) was created. In 1926 the Wuchang town was promoted to a city, and merged with Hankou and Hanyang to form a new city named Wuhan.

After 1949, the more urban part of the Wuchang County was absorbed into the new Wuhan City and was administratively partitioned into Wuchang, Qingshan and Hongshan districts, while the remaining, mostly rural, southern part retained the name of Wuchang County. In 1995, Wuchang County became Jiangxia District of Wuhan.

<text>Sir Norman Joseph Wisdom, (4 February 1915 – 4 October 2010) was an English actor, comedian, musician and singer, best known for a series of comedy films produced between 1953 and 1966 featuring a hapless character called Norman Pitkin. He was awarded the 1953 BAFTA Award for Most Promising Newcomer to Leading Film Roles following the release of &quot;Trouble in Store&quot;, his first film in a lead role.

Wisdom gained celebrity status in lands as far apart as South America, Iran and many Eastern Bloc countries, particularly in Albania where his films were the only ones with Western actors permitted to be shown by dictator Enver Hoxha. Charlie Chaplin once referred to Wisdom as his &quot;favourite clown&quot;.

Wisdom later forged a career on Broadway in New York City alongside stars such as Mandy Patinkin, and as a television actor, winning critical acclaim for his dramatic role of a dying cancer patient in the television play &quot;Going Gently&quot; in 1981. He toured Australia and South Africa. After the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, a hospice was named in his honour. In 1995, he was given the Freedom of the City of London and of Tirana. The same year, he was appointed OBE and was knighted five years later.

== Early life ==
Norman Joseph Wisdom was born in the Marylebone district of London. His parents were Frederick, a chauffeur, and Maud Wisdom (née Targett), a dressmaker, who often worked for West End theatres and had made a dress for Queen Mary. The couple married in Marylebone on 15 July 1912. Wisdom had an elder brother, Frederick Thomas &quot;Fred&quot; Wisdom (13 December 1912 – 1 July 1971).

The family lived at 91 Fernhead Road, Maida Vale, London W9, where they slept in one room. He and his brother were brought up in extreme poverty and were frequently hit by their alcoholic father, who would pick them up and throw them across the room. After his parents&#x27; separation, Wisdom and his brother were &quot;farmed out to paid guardians&quot;, but his father did not pay so they were both turned out. Having been kicked out of his home by his father he became homeless and slept rough in London.

After unsuccessful fostering elsewhere he was generously taken in by a couple. Wisdom got work as an errand boy in a grocer&#x27;s shop despite initially not knowing how to ride a bicycle. At age 13 he worked long shifts in a hotel. A fellow boy worker convinced him to walk to Cardiff and become a miner, but the boy’s family would not house him, after which he became a cabin boy in the Merchant Navy. He sailed to Argentina, learning to box on board. In Argentina he survived three rounds of boxing for prize money but was badly beaten and had to fight off some sexual advances by a fellow sailor. On his return to Cardiff he had no job and returned to London, where he was advised to join the British Army, which took band recruits from age 14. Though knowing no music he turned on the tears to the recruiting officer and was successful.

== Military service ==
In 1930, he was posted to Lucknow, in the United Provinces of British India, as a band boy. He rode horses, became the flyweight boxing champion of the British Army in India and taught himself to play the piano, trumpet, saxophone, flute, drums, bugle and clarinet.

At the outbreak of the Second World War, Wisdom was sent to work at a communications centre in a command bunker in London, where he connected telephone calls from war leaders to the prime minister. He met Winston Churchill on several occasions when asked for updates on incoming calls. Wisdom then joined the Royal Corps of Signals, and performed a similar military function at the unit headquarters in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire.

Whilst performing a shadow boxing routine in an army gym, Wisdom discovered he had a talent for entertainment, and began to develop his skills as a musician and stage entertainer. In 1940 aged 25, at a NAAFI entertainment night, during a dance routine, Wisdom stepped down from his position in the orchestra pit, and started shadow boxing. Hearing his colleagues and officers giggling, he broke into a duck waddle, followed by a series of comic facial expressions. He later described the reaction: &quot;They were in hysterics. All the officers were falling about laughing.&quot;

Wisdom later said that was where he first patented his persona as &quot;The Successful Failure&quot;. Over the next few years, until he was demobilised in 1945, his routine included his characteristic singing and the trip-up-and-stumble. After Wisdom appeared at a charity concert at Cheltenham Town Hall on 31 August 1944, actor Rex Harrison came backstage and urged him to become a professional entertainer.

== Comic entertainer ==
After being demobilised, Wisdom worked as a private hire car driver. Having improved his diction in the army, he also took a job as a night telephone operator.

Wisdom made his debut as a professional entertainer at the age of 31, still calling himself &quot;The Successful Failure&quot;. In the anonymity of small suburban music halls he built an act out of his shyness, his ability to fall and his multi-instrumental music skills and singing talent. The theatre band constantly changed key and he could never keep up until he demonstrated his virtuosity by beating them at their own game. One outstanding review in August 1946 read: &quot;An unusual and most versatile comedian, Norman Wisdom, contributes two remarkable turns. He is an accomplished pianist, a pleasing singer, a talented instrumentalist, a clever mimer, and withal, a true humourist.&quot;.

His rise to the top was relatively fast. A very successful run at the London Casino in April 1948, led to a summer season in &quot;Out of the Blue&quot; in Scarborough. Magician David Nixon was also part of the cast and the two worked together so well that they went on to continue the act on other variety stages starting at the London Casino in September 1948. Christmas 1948 saw him in the pantomime &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; at Birmingham&#x27;s Alexandra Theatre. Wisdom had already adopted the costume that would remain his trademark: tweed flat cap askew, with peak turned up; a suit at least two sizes too tight; a crumpled collar and a mangled tie. The character that went with this costume — known as the Gump — was to dominate Wisdom&#x27;s film career. A West End theatre star within two years, he honed his act into a star turn mainly between theatres in London and Brighton:
Wisdom made his TV debut in 1948 and was soon commanding enormous audiences and had a small film role in &quot;A Date with a Dream&quot; released in the same year.

== Starring film roles for the Rank Organisation ==
Wisdom made a series of low-budget star-vehicle comedies for the Rank Organisation, beginning with &quot;Trouble in Store&quot; (1953). This film earned him a BAFTA Award for Most Promising Newcomer to Film in 1954. It was the second most popular film at the British box-office in 1954 and exhibitors voted him the tenth biggest star at the British box office the same year.

His films&#x27; cheerful, unpretentious appeal make them the direct descendants of those made a generation earlier by George Formby. Never highly thought of by the critics, they were very popular with domestic audiences and Wisdom&#x27;s films were among Britain&#x27;s biggest box-office successes of their day. They were also successful in some unlikely overseas markets, helping Rank stay afloat financially when their more expensive film projects were unsuccessful.

The films usually involved the Gump character, usually called Norman, in a manual occupation in which he is barely competent and in a junior position to a straight man, often played by Edward Chapman (as Mr Grimsdale) or Jerry Desmonde. They benefited from Wisdom&#x27;s capacity for physical slapstick comedy and his skill at creating a sense of the character&#x27;s helplessness. The series often contained a romantic subplot; the Gump&#x27;s inevitable awkwardness with women is a characteristic shared with the earlier Formby vehicles. His innocent incompetence still made him endearing to the heroine.

Wisdom&#x27;s second film as star, &quot;One Good Turn&quot; (1955), was the seventh most popular movie of 1955 in Britain. He made a cameo in &quot;As Long as They&#x27;re Happy&quot; (1955), then returned in &quot;Man of the Moment&quot; (1955). He was the 6th most popular star of 1955.

Wisdom was a window cleaner in &quot;Up in the World&quot; (1956) and worked in a jewellery store in &quot;Just My Luck&quot; (1957). The box office receipts of these last few films had declined from previous Wisdom films but &quot;The Square Peg&quot; (1959), an army comedy, reversed the trend and was one of the year&#x27;s biggest hits. The film was the 7th most popular movie at the British box office in 1959. Less successful was &quot;Follow a Star&quot; (1959). &quot;There Was a Crooked Man&quot; (1960) was an attempt to change Wisdom&#x27;s image away from Rank Organisation. &quot;The Bulldog Breed&quot; (1960) was more conventional. The film also starred a young Michael Caine who later recalled he did not enjoy working with Wisdom because he &quot;wasn&#x27;t very nice to support-part actors&quot;. Wisdom remained the 10th biggest star at the British box office.

Wisdom was in &quot;The Girl on the Boat&quot; (1961) from a novel by P. G. Wodehouse, a second film away from the Rank formula. &quot;On the Beat&quot; (1962) as a car cleaner and &quot;A Stitch in Time&quot; (1963), in which he was cast as an apprentice butcher, returned him to the regular format.

&quot;The Early Bird&quot; (1965), his first colour film, had Wisdom as a milkman. After a cameo in &quot;The Sandwich Man&quot; (1966), Wisdom starred in &quot;Press for Time&quot; (1966), the last film in this sequence of starring vehicles. Wisdom was still voted the 5th most popular star at the British box office.

Wisdom&#x27;s stage performances often involved musical numbers, although he wrote only a few of them. He has seven songs attributed to him in the ASCAP database, which are: &quot;Beware&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Laugh at Me (&#x27;cause I&#x27;m a Fool)&quot;, &quot;Falling in Love&quot;, &quot;Follow a Star&quot;, &quot;I Love You&quot;, &quot;Please Opportunity&quot;, and &quot;Up in the World&quot;.

== Later career ==

In 1966, Wisdom spent a short period in the United States to star in the Broadway production of the Jimmy Van Heusen and Sammy Cahn musical comedy &quot;Walking Happy&quot; based on the play &quot;Hobson&#x27;s Choice&quot; by Harold Brighouse. His performance as &quot;Will Mosop&quot; was nominated for a Tony Award.

This led to Wisdom&#x27;s being cast in his first Hollywood film, &quot;The Night They Raided Minsky&#x27;s&quot; (1968) and in the US Television musical of George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Androcles and The Lion&quot; (1967) with songs by Richard Rodgers and co-starring Noël Coward.

After a typical performance on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, further US opportunities were denied him when he had to return to London after his second wife left him. His subsequent career was largely confined to television, and he toured the world with a successful cabaret act. He won critical acclaim in 1981 for his dramatic role of a dying cancer patient in the television play Going Gently.

Wisdom was one of several actors initially considered for the role of Frank Spencer in &quot;Some Mothers Do &#x27;Ave &#x27;Em.&quot; However, he turned the role down and it eventually went to Michael Crawford. The creator of the series Raymond Allen later stated &quot;Norman Wisdom was offered the role but turned it down because he didn&#x27;t find it funny&quot;.

On 31 December 1976, Wisdom performed his theme song &quot;Don&#x27;t Laugh at Me (&#x27;cause I&#x27;m a Fool)&quot; on BBC1&#x27;s &quot;A Jubilee of Music&quot;, celebrating British pop music for Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s impending Silver Jubilee. Wisdom had performed in front of the Queen at many Royal Command Performances, the first being in 1952.

After touring South Africa, Zimbabwe and Australia with some success, his appearances in Britain became more infrequent. He spent much of the 1980s in seclusion on the Isle of Man.

Wisdom&#x27;s career revived in the 1990s, helped by the young comedian Lee Evans, whose act was often compared to Wisdom&#x27;s work. The high point of this new popularity was the knighthood he was awarded, for services to entertainment, in the 2000 New Year&#x27;s honours list. During the ceremony, once he had received his knighthood, he walked away and again performed his trademark trip, at which the Queen smiled and laughed.

From 1995 until 2004 he appeared in the recurring role of Billy Ingleton in the long-running BBC comedy &quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot;.

In 1996, he received a Special Achievement Award from the London Film Critics.

Wisdom was a guest on a &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; special in 2000 for actor and director Todd Carty. He appeared as a half-time guest at the England vs Albania 2002 World Cup qualifier at St James&#x27; Park, Newcastle upon Tyne, and scored a penalty at the Leazes End.

In 2002 Wisdom filmed a cameo role as a butler in a low-budget horror film. In 2004, he made an appearance on &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, playing fitness fanatic pensioner Ernie Crabbe. In 2007 he came out of retirement to take a role in a short film called &quot;Expresso&quot;.

=== Popularity in Albania ===
Wisdom became a cultural icon in Albania, where he was one of the few Western actors whose films were allowed in the country under Enver Hoxha. According to Hoxha&#x27;s dialectical materialist viewpoint, proletarian Norman&#x27;s ultimately victorious struggles against capitalism, personified by Mr Grimsdale and the effete aristocratic characters played by Jerry Desmonde, were a Communist parable on the class war. He was known as Mr Pitkin after the character from his films. In 1995, he visited the post-Stalinist country where, to his surprise, he was greeted by many appreciative fans, including the then President, Sali Berisha. During this trip, Wisdom was filmed by &quot;Newsnight&quot; as he visited a children&#x27;s project funded by ChildHope UK.

On a visit in 2001, which coincided with the England football team playing Albania in the city of Tirana, his appearance at the training ground overshadowed that of David Beckham. He appeared on the pitch before the start of the Albania v England match wearing a half-Albanian and half-English football shirt. He was well received by the crowd, especially when he performed one of his trademark trips on his way out to the centre circle. In 1995 Wisdom was made an honorary citizen of Tirana.

In his book and TV series &quot;One Hit Wonderland&quot;, Tony Hawks united with Wisdom and, along with Tim Rice, released a single, &quot;Big in Albania&quot;, in an attempt to enter the Albanian pop charts. It reached number 18 on the Top Albania Radio chart.

== Retirement ==

In October 2004, Wisdom announced he would retire from the entertainment industry on his 90th birthday (4 February 2005). He announced he intended to spend more time with his family, playing golf and driving around the Isle of Man, where he was living.

In 2007, Wisdom returned to acting in a short film directed by Kevin Powis, &quot;Expresso&quot;. The film, which Wisdom later announced (reported BBC/ITV News) was to be officially his last film role, is set during one day in a coffee shop and was funded by the UK Film Council and ScreenWM. Shot in January, it premièred at the Cannes Film Festival on 27 May 2007. It was later adopted by the UK charity Macmillan and released on DVD in aid of the charity.

In the film, Wisdom plays a vicar plagued by a fly in a café. Producer Nigel Martin Davey gave him only a visual role so that he would not have to remember any lines, but on the day, Wisdom was alert and had his performance changed to add more laughs.

== Personal life ==
Wisdom was married twice. His first wife was Doreen Brett, whom he married in 1941. By 1944 they had separated when Doreen gave birth to a son, Michael (born 1944), fathered by Albert Gerald Hardwick, a telephone engineer. The marriage was dissolved in 1946.

He married his second wife, Freda Isobel Simpson, in 1947; they had two children: Nicholas (born 1953, who later played first-class cricket for Sussex) and Jacqueline (born 1954). The couple divorced in 1969, with Wisdom granted full custody of the children. Freda Wisdom died in Brighton in 1992.

Popular in the Isle of Man, he lived for 27 years in a house in Andreas named Ballalough (Manx for &quot;lake farm&quot;, also a humorous corruption of the English &quot;belly laugh&quot;). He supported various charities and charitable works, including orphanages in Albania. In 2005, Wisdom starred in a video for the Manx girl group Twisted Angels, for their single &quot;LA&quot;, in support of the local charity Project 21.

During the 1960s, he was involved in a famous legal case (&quot;Wisdom v Chamberlain&quot;, 1968) in which he was pursued by the Inland Revenue for tax on profits made from the sale of silver bullion he had bought when concerned about the further devaluation of sterling. He contended that it was an investment, but the court held that it had been a trading venture and was duly chargeable to income tax.

=== Interests ===

Wisdom was a lifelong supporter and a former board member of football team Brighton &amp; Hove Albion. He also liked Everton and Newcastle United. He enjoyed golf, and was a member of the Grand Order of Water Rats. He was an honorary member of the Winkle Club, a charity in Hastings, East Sussex.

A lover of cars, his collection included a 1956 Bentley S1 Continental R Type fastback, which he first bought in 1961, and then again in the late 1980s. In 1969, he purchased, after the divorce from Freda Simpson, a Shelby Cobra 427, CSX3206, in New York, which he kept until 1986, when it was sold to another car enthusiast in Brighton, UK. Until his age and declining mental health meant he failed a Department of Transport fitness-to-drive test, he owned and drove a 1987 Rolls-Royce Silver Spirit and a Jaguar S-Type, which were sold in September 2005.

In 1963, he bought a new motor yacht. The long hull and superstructure were built in Spain for £80,000, before being towed to Shoreham-by-Sea, West Sussex, for fitting out. After three years of extensive works and sea trials, she was named M/Y &quot;Conquest&quot; and valued at £1.25 million by insurers. It was available for charter at £6,000 a month but Wisdom later sold it, saying that he was &quot;no sailor&quot;.

== Health decline ==
In mid-2006, after he suffered an irregular heart rhythm, Wisdom was flown by helicopter to hospital in Liverpool and was fitted with a heart pacemaker.

Wisdom resided in the Abbotswood nursing home in Ballasalla, where he had been resident from 12 July 2007 to 4 October 2010.

On the release of &quot;Expresso&quot; to DVD in the same month, BBC News confirmed that Wisdom lived in a care home, because of his suffering from vascular dementia. It was also reported that he had granted his children power of attorney over his affairs and, having sold off his flat in Epsom, Surrey, they were now in the process of selling his Isle of Man home to raise money to fund his longer-term care.

On 16 January 2008, BBC2 aired &quot;Wonderland: The Secret Life Of Norman Wisdom Aged 92 and 3/4.&quot; The documentary highlighted the dilemma of coping with an ageing parent. His family stated Wisdom&#x27;s memory loss had become so severe he no longer recognised himself in his films.

== Death ==
In the six months prior to his death, Wisdom suffered a series of strokes, causing a decline in his physical and mental health. He died on 4 October 2010 at Abbotswood nursing home on the Isle of Man at the age of 95.

His funeral took place on 22 October 2010 in Douglas, Isle of Man, and all of the island were invited. His trademark cloth cap was placed on the coffin in the church. The funeral was attended by a large number of showbusiness personalities and, at Wisdom&#x27;s request, Moira Anderson sang &quot;Who Can I Turn To&quot;, which was specially arranged for the occasion by Gordon Cree. Wisdom&#x27;s body was buried at Kirk Bride Churchyard, Bride, Isle of Man.

<text>Bernard Joseph Cribbins (29 December 1928 – 27 July 2022) was an English actor and singer whose career spanned over eight decades.

During the 1960s, Cribbins became known in the UK for his successful novelty records &quot;The Hole in the Ground&quot; and &quot;Right Said Fred&quot; and for his appearances in comedy films including &quot;Two-Way Stretch&quot; (1960) and the &quot;Carry On&quot; series. His other screen roles include the astronaut Vincent Mountjoy in &quot;The Mouse on the Moon&quot; (1963), Albert Perks in &quot;The Railway Children&quot; (1970), the barman Felix Forsythe in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Frenzy&quot; (1972) and the pretentious hotel guest Mr Hutchinson in the &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; episode &quot;The Hotel Inspectors&quot; (1975). On television, he was a regular and prolific reader for the BBC series &quot;Jackanory&quot; from 1966 to 1991, he narrated the children&#x27;s programme &quot;The Wombles&quot; (1973–1975) and he played the title role in the CBeebies series &quot;Old Jack&#x27;s Boat&quot; (2013–2015).

In the 1966 film &quot;Daleks&#x27; Invasion Earth 2150 A.D.&quot;, Cribbins portrayed Tom Campbell, a companion to Dr. Who. 41 years later, he began appearing in the revival series of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; as Wilfred Mott, the grandfather of regular companion Donna Noble and a temporary companion to the Tenth Doctor. He made his final appearance posthumously in the 60th anniversary special &quot;Wild Blue Yonder&quot; (2023).

==Early life==
Bernard Joseph Cribbins was born on 29 December 1928 in the Derker area of Oldham, Lancashire, the son of First World War veteran John Edward Cribbins (1896–1964) and Ethel (&quot;née&quot; Clarkson; 1898–1989), a cotton weaver. He had two sisters, alongside whom he grew up close to poverty. He described his father as a &quot;jack of all trades&quot; who also dabbled in acting.

Cribbins left school at the age of 13 and found a job as an assistant stage manager at a local theatre club, where he also took on some small acting roles, and then served an apprenticeship at the Oldham Repertory Theatre. In 1947, he began national service with the Parachute Regiment in Aldershot, Hampshire, including a posting to Mandatory Palestine.

==Career==
===Early career===
Cribbins made his first West End theatre appearance in 1956 at the Arts Theatre, playing the two Dromios in &quot;A Comedy of Errors&quot;, and co-starred in the first West End productions of &quot;Not Now Darling&quot;, &quot;There Goes the Bride&quot; and &quot;Run for Your Wife&quot;. In 1960, he starred alongside Anna Quayle and Lionel Blair in the revue &quot;And Another Thing&quot;, written by Ted Dicks and Myles Rudge. The show brought Cribbins to the attention of Parlophone head George Martin, who signed Cribbins to the label to record a single of a satirical song from the show titled &quot;Folk Song&quot;. Subsequently, Rudge and Dicks were asked to provide new material for Cribbins; their compositions &quot;The Hole in the Ground&quot;, about an annoyed workman who eventually buries a harasser, and &quot;Right Said Fred&quot;, about three workmen who struggle to move an unspecified heavy and awkward object into or out of a building (later also the name of a pop novelty band who named themselves after the song), were top ten hits on the UK Singles Chart in 1962. The third and final Cribbins single of the year &quot;Gossip Calypso&quot;, written by Trevor Peacock, was another top 30 hit.

===Films===
Cribbins appeared in films from the early 1950s, mainly comedies. His credits include &quot;Two-Way Stretch&quot; (1960) and &quot;The Wrong Arm of the Law&quot; (1963) with Peter Sellers, &quot;Crooks in Cloisters&quot; (1964) and three &quot;Carry On&quot; films – &quot;Carry On Jack&quot; (1963), &quot;Carry On Spying&quot; (1964) and &quot;Carry On Columbus&quot; (1992). His other appearances include the second &quot;Doctor Who&quot; film &quot;Daleks&#x27; Invasion Earth 2150 A.D.&quot; (1966) as Special Police Constable Tom Campbell; &quot;She&quot; (1965);&quot; Casino Royale&quot; (1967) as Carlton Towers, a British Foreign Office official, &quot;The Railway Children&quot; (1970) as Mr Albert Perks, the station porter and the Alfred Hitchcock thriller &quot;Frenzy&quot; (1972) as Felix Forsythe, the Covent Garden pub landlord. His later films include &quot;Dangerous Davies – The Last Detective&quot; (1981), &quot;Blackball&quot; (2003) and &quot;Run for Your Wife&quot; (2012).

===Narration and voice work===
Cribbins was the narrator of the British animated children&#x27;s television series &quot;The Wombles&quot; from 1973 to 1975 and also played the character of the Water Rat in a BBC Radio adaptation of &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot;. He was the celebrity storyteller in more episodes of &quot;Jackanory&quot; than any other personality, with a total of 114 appearances between 1966 and 1991. He also narrated the audio tape of the Antonia Barber book &quot;The Mousehole Cat&quot;. From 1974 to 1976, Cribbins narrated &quot;Simon in the Land of Chalk Drawings.&quot;

In the 1960s Cribbins provided the voice of the character Tufty in RoSPA road safety films. He also provided the voice of Buzby, a talking cartoon bird that was the mascot for the Post Office. He also appeared in advertisements for Hornby model trains. In 1978, he provided one of two voiceovers in the electricity safety public information film Play Safe. The other voice artist was Brian Wilde; Wilde voiced the owl and Cribbins voiced the robin. In 1981, Music for Pleasure released a &quot;Swallows and Amazons&quot; audio book on tape cassette, read by Cribbins, abridged by Edward Phillips.

From 1987 to 1991, Cribbins starred as Jimmy Bright alongside Frank Thornton as Russell Farrow in &quot;Mind Your Own Business&quot; on BBC Radio 2, which also starred Annette Crosbie.

Cribbins also provided the voiceover work for &quot;A Passion For Angling&quot;, starring Chris Yates and Bob James (1993). In 1996, he played Puddleglum the marshwiggle in Brian Sibley&#x27;s BBC Radio adaptation of C. S. Lewis&#x27;s &quot;The Silver Chair&quot;. In 2013, he played Old Bailey in the radio adaptation of &quot;Neverwhere&quot;, dramatised by Dirk Maggs and in 2015 he was among an ensemble cast in an audio production of &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, in which he played the White Cobra.

===Television===

Cribbins was the star of the ITV series &quot;Cribbins&quot; (1969–70). His other TV appearances include &quot;The Avengers&quot; (1968), &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; (1975, as the spoon salesman Mr Hutchinson who is mistaken by the character Basil Fawlty for a hotel inspector), &quot;Worzel Gummidge&quot; (1980), &quot;Shillingbury Tales&quot; (1980) and its spin-off &quot;Cuffy&quot; (1983). Besides voicing &quot;The Wombles&quot;, Cribbins was a regular on BBC children&#x27;s television in the 1970s as host of performance panel game &quot;Star Turn&quot; and &quot;Star Turn Challenge&quot;.

These programmes concluded with Cribbins narrating a detective story as recurring character &quot;Ivor Notion&quot;, with a script usually by Johnny Ball but sometimes by Myles Rudge, the co-writer of his Top 10 singles. He starred in the BBC&#x27;s 1975 Christmas production &quot;Great Big Groovy Horse&quot;, a rock opera based on the story of the Trojan Horse shown on BBC2 alongside Julie Covington and Paul Jones. It was later repeated on BBC1 in 1977. He regularly appeared on BBC TV&#x27;s &quot;The Good Old Days&quot; recreating songs made famous by the great stars of Music Hall.

Among his later TV appearances were &quot;Dalziel and Pascoe&quot; (1999), &quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot; (2003), &quot;Coronation Street&quot; (2003, as Wally Bannister) and &quot;Down to Earth&quot; (2005).

Cribbins starred as Jack in the series &quot;Old Jack&#x27;s Boat&quot;, set in Staithes, and broadcast on the CBeebies channel starting in 2013. The cast included Helen Lederer, Janine Duvitski and former &quot;Doctor Who&quot; companion Freema Agyeman in supporting roles. Although Agyeman and Cribbins both played companions and supporting characters during David Tennant&#x27;s tenure in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; (appearing in six episodes together), &quot;Old Jack&#x27;s Boat&quot; was the first time the two actors have appeared together on screen. On 9 May 2015, Cribbins gave a reading at VE Day 70: A Party to Remember in Horse Guards Parade, London which was broadcast live on BBC1. He made his final on screen appearance as Wilfred Mott in the second 60th anniversary episode &quot;Wild Blue Yonder&quot; in December 2023; although he was due to appear in the third of the three episodes and more material had been written for him, Cribbins was too ill and so this became his only scene.

In November 2018, it was announced that Cribbins would portray Private Godfrey in a series of re-creations of lost episodes from the BBC sitcom &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;. However, Cribbins left the production in February 2019 citing &quot;personal reasons&quot;. The role of Godfrey was later played by Timothy West.

===Later stage career===
Cribbins&#x27; later theatre credits include the roles of Nathan Detroit in &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; at the National Theatre, Moonface Martin in &quot;Anything Goes&quot; with Elaine Paige at the Prince Edward Theatre, Dolittle in &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; at the Houston Opera House, Texas and Watty Watkins in George Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Lady, Be Good&quot; at the Regent&#x27;s Park Open Air Theatre and on tour. He also appeared in numerous pantomimes. He appeared in the BBC CBeebies Proms (Number 11 &amp; 13) at the Royal Albert Hall on Saturday 26 &amp; Sunday 27 July 2014 as Old Jack.

National Life Stories conducted an interview (C1173/14) with Cribbins on his memories of Richard Negri in 2006 for its An Oral History of Theatre Design collection held by the British Library.

===&quot;Doctor Who&quot;===
Having played Tom Campbell, a companion to Dr. Who in the feature film &quot;Daleks&#x27; Invasion Earth 2150 A.D.&quot; (1966), Cribbins returned to &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in 2006, when a photograph of him and fellow &quot;Doctor Who&quot; actor Lynda Baron at a wedding appeared on the BBC&#x27;s tie-in website for the television episode &quot;Tooth and Claw&quot;.

In January 2007, Cribbins had a guest role as glam rock promoter Arnold Korns in &quot;Horror of Glam Rock&quot;, a &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audiodrama by Big Finish Productions. In December 2007, he appeared as Wilfred Mott in the Christmas television special, &quot;Voyage of the Damned&quot; (although in the closing credits, his character was named as &quot;Stan&quot;) ; he then appeared in a recurring capacity as Wilfred Mott for the 2008 series, as the grandfather of companion Donna Noble. He became a Tenth Doctor temporary companion himself in &quot;The End of Time&quot;, the two-part 2009–10 Christmas and New Year special, when his character was inadvertently responsible for that Doctor&#x27;s demise. Cribbins&#x27;s role as Wilfred Mott makes him the only actor to have played two companions and the only actor featured in both the TV and cinema versions of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. In 2019, he reprised the role of Wilfred in &quot;No Place&quot; a story in &quot;The Tenth Doctor Adventures&quot; produced by Big Finish. In 2022, Cribbins was reported to be returning to &quot;Doctor Who&quot; alongside David Tennant and Catherine Tate for the programme&#x27;s 60th anniversary specials. His appearance, in &quot;Wild Blue Yonder&quot; (2023), aired posthumously; the episode was dedicated to his memory.

==Honours==
Cribbins was awarded the General Service Medal, with clasp &quot;Palestine 1945–48&quot;, for his service in Palestine with 2/3 Battalion, the Parachute Regiment, on 30 May 1948, under Army Order 146 of 1947.

In 2009, Cribbins was honoured for his work in children&#x27;s television with a Special Award at the British Academy Children&#x27;s Awards which was presented by former co-star Catherine Tate, who portrayed his character&#x27;s granddaughter in &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. He was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2011 Birthday Honours for services to drama. He received his OBE from the Princess Royal at an investiture in the Waterloo Chamber at Windsor Castle on 3 November 2011. In 2014, he was awarded the J. M. Barrie award for his &quot;lasting contribution to children&#x27;s arts&quot;.

Cribbins was named &quot;British Icon of the Week&quot; on 23 December 2020 by BBC America.

==Personal life and death==
In 1955, Cribbins married Gillian McBarnet, an assistant stage manager; the couple remained together until her death on 11 October 2021. They lived in Weybridge, Surrey, and had no children, with Cribbins revealing in 2018 that they &quot;lost one quite early on and that was the only time [they] got near it&quot;. He was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2009, but said in 2018 that he was &quot;in good health&quot; at the age of 90 with the exception of a &quot;nagging back condition&quot;.

Cribbins avidly enjoyed fishing. He narrated the 1993 BBC Two documentary series &quot;A Passion for Angling&quot; and the 2008 documentary series &quot;Catching the Impossible&quot;; in the latter, he also fished onscreen alongside expert angler Martin Bowler.

In 2018 his autobiography, &quot;Bernard Who? 75 Years of Doing Just About Anything&quot;, was published by Constable. A successful social media campaign in 2022 led to his autobiography being recorded as an audiobook, with Cribbins as the narrator, but recording was incomplete at the time of his death, and the book was released with a narration by Gordon Griffin.

Cribbins died at the age of 93 on 27 July 2022. His funeral took place at Woking Crematorium in Surrey on 14 September.

<text>Donovan&#x27;s Reef is a 1963 American adventure comedy film starring John Wayne and Lee Marvin. It was directed by John Ford and filmed in Kauai, Hawaii, but is set in French Polynesia.

The supporting cast features Elizabeth Allen, Jack Warden, Cesar Romero, Dick Foran, and Dorothy Lamour. The film marked the last time Ford and Wayne collaborated.

==Plot==

Nearly two decades after World War II, Thomas Gilhooley, an expatriate United States Navy (USN) veteran, works on a freighter. Upon realizing that it will not stop at his destination, Haleakaloha, French Polynesia, he jumps ship to swim ashore.

Michael Donovan, another expatriate USN veteran and a former shipmate of Gilhooley&#x27;s, remains a close friend of William &quot;Doc&quot; Dedham, also a USN veteran, and the only medical doctor in the archipelago. Dedham asks Donovan to care for his three children while he is away on a two-week circuit of the islands, providing medical care.

Gilhooley shares Donovan&#x27;s birthday, and the two have a 21-year tradition of a fistfight every birthday, to the delight of the local observers. On this occasion, the two vets trash &quot;Donovan&#x27;s Reef,&quot; the saloon Donovan owns.

In Boston, Miss Amelia Dedham, a &quot;proper&quot; young lady &quot;of means,&quot; becomes the chairman of the board of the Dedham Shipping Company. Her father, Doc Dedham (whom she has never met), has inherited the majority of stock in the family company. Amelia travels to Haleakaloha to find proof that Doc has violated an outdated (but still in effect) morality clause in the will, preventing him from inheriting the stock and enabling her to retain control.

While Doc is away, word is received that Miss Dedham will soon arrive. Fearing that Miss Dedham’s Boston sensibilities will be shocked by her father’s half-polynesian (&quot;Hapa&quot;) children, Donovan, Gilhooley and the Marquis de Lage concoct a scheme. Donovan will pretend to be the father of Doc&#x27;s three children (Leilani, Sarah, and Luke), until Doc returns and can deal with the situation. Lelani, the eldest, reluctantly accepts the plan.

Amelia learns that during the war her father, Donovan, and Gilhooley were marooned on the Japanese-occupied island after their destroyer was sunk. With the help of the locals, they conducted guerrilla war against the Japanese. Besides a hospital, her father built a large house, where a portrait of a beautiful Polynesian woman in royal attire is displayed prominently. The woman is Doc&#x27;s late wife, the mother of his children, though Amelia is not told this. She learns that the woman was Manulani, who died in childbirth.

Life in the islands is not as expected. Amelia and Donovan initially clash over each being offended by the other’s preconceptions. Amelia is not as prim and narrow-minded as Donovan expects. Donovan, who proves to be educated and intelligent, owns a substantial local shipping operation. When Donovan takes her boating, Amelia demonstrates skill in water skiing and beats Donovan in a swimming race to shore. Amelia takes warmly to “Donovan’s” children, unwittingly inviting them to a cozy Christmas at their own home. Donovan and Amelia gradually overcome their initial animosity. Meanwhile, Lage tries to court Amelia (or rather, her $18,000,000) and encourages her prejudice toward Donovan, telling her that Donovan has always been a bachelor despite “his” three children.

When Dr. Dedham returns, Donovan reveals the deception to him. Father and daughter meet, and Doc explains to Amelia that he was serving in the war when his wife (Amelia&#x27;s mother) died. When the war ended, he was unneeded in Boston, but was desperately needed in the islands, so he stayed. He signs over his stock to Amelia. Just as he is about to explain about Manulani and their children, a hospital emergency interrupts.

Manulani was the granddaughter of the last hereditary prince of the islands, and Amelia finally solves the mystery: Leilani — Manulani&#x27;s daughter — is not only the island&#x27;s princess, but Amelia&#x27;s half-sister, as they both joyfully acknowledge.

When Amelia confronts Donovan about his deception, she is insulted by his explanation that the deception was needed until she shook off her Boston rigidity. They quarrel and she plans to leave for Boston. At the Doc’s urging, Amelia goes to see Donovan to take leave. Amelia and Donovan’s farewells devolve into an argument and then morph into marriage plans. They decide to name their first son William, after her father. Gilhooley also finally marries his longtime girlfriend, Miss Lafleur. Donovan gives the bar to his old shipmate as a wedding present. Donovan moves his possessions into the big house as one of the newly extended family.

==Production==
The film was based on original material for Paramount prepared by James Michener (although Michener is not credited in the final film). In February 1962 Paramount announced that John Wayne and John Ford would make the film, then called &quot;South Sea Story&quot;, from a script by James Edward Grant. Martin Rackin helped put together the deal at Paramount.

Ford called it &quot;a spoof picture – a whammy, crazy sort of thing. We&#x27;re not going for any prizes.&quot;

While &quot;Donovan&#x27;s Reef&quot; is set on the fictional island of Haleakaloha, which has a French governor, the only Polynesian language exhibited in the film is Hawaiian; &quot;Haleakaloha&quot; can be translated as &quot;Home of Laughter and Love&quot; (&quot;hale&quot; = home, &quot;aka&quot; = laugh, &quot;aloha&quot; = love). In fact, in the southern Polynesian dialect spoken in French Polynesia, the words are spelled with a T, where Hawaiian uses a K. The music is also Hawaiian, with its characteristic Hawaiian guitar.

Filming started in July 1962 on Kauai, Hawaii, but Ford&#x27;s health had deteriorated to the point that Wayne wound up directing most of the film himself.

The home of the French island governor, the white beach house with coconut palms and surrounding grass lawn, is the Allerton Estate home and former summer residence of Hawaiian Queen Emma near Poipu Beach, now a part of the National Tropical Botanical Garden (without the scenes of boats and canoes on the Wailua River, which were edited and merged with scenes filmed at the Allerton Estate).

The unit then returned to Hollywood to finish scenes at Paramount studios.

The song &#x27;Pearly Shells&quot; was used as the movie&#x27;s opening theme and again in later scenes.

==Release==

===Box-office performance===
&quot;Donovan&#x27;s Reef&quot; was a moderate financial success. Produced on a budget of $2,686,000, the film grossed $6,600,000 in North America, earning $3.3 million in US theatrical rentals. It was the 24th-highest grossing film of 1963.

===Critical reception===
A. H. Weiler of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the movie was &quot;sheer contrivance effected in hearty, fun-loving, truly infectious style&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; called it an &quot;effort-less effort&quot;, but praised the photography. Currently, the film holds a &quot;Rotten&quot; 55% rating on the review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes.

<text>Thornhill is a village on the southern outskirts of Dewsbury in Kirklees, West Yorkshire, England. Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, Thornhill was absorbed into Dewsbury County Borough in 1910. The village is located on a ridge on the south side of the River Calder. Dewsbury, Ossett and Wakefield are close by. Its parish church houses a collection of Anglo-Saxon crosses.

==History==
Anglian crosses and other remains indicate that there was a settlement here by the 9th century. A hoard of 27 Roman denarii found in Turnip Lane and pottery at the cross indicate a substantially earlier settlement. The tombstone of a high-ranking Anglian, Osberht, was found in the graveyard of Thornhill Parish Church. Some historians claim that the grave bearing the name &quot;Osbehrt&quot; is that of Osberht of Northumbria, who was killed on 21 March 867 while fighting the Viking Great Heathen Army led by Ivar the Boneless. The gravestone, among other contemporaneous high-status Anglian gravestones, is displayed in the church. 

Local place-names, Ludd Well (shown on a 1602 map) and the Combs indicate Celtic settlement. This is reinforced by the dedication of the Parish Church to St Michael, which is typical for churches in high places in formerly Celtic parts of northern England. The Celtic kingdom of Elmet that covered parts of modern West Yorkshire collapsed in AD 617.

Thornhill is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 as within the ancient wapentake of Agbrigg. In 1320 Edward II granted a charter for a market and a fair.
In the reign of Henry III, Thornhill Hall was the seat of the Thornhill family, who intermarried with the De Fixbys and Babthorpes in the reigns of Edward I and Edward II. In the reign of Edward III, Elizabeth Thornhill, the only child of Simon Thornhill, married Sir Henry Savile. This extinguished the family line of Thornhills of Thornhill which passed its property down the Savile line and Thornhill became the seat of the Savile family. The Saviles intermarried with the Calverley family so that when Sir John Savile died in 1503 in Thornhill, he left provision in his will for his sister Alice, married to Sir William Calverley. Sir William Savile, the third baronet of the family, fortified the hall.

===Thornhill Hall===
The Saviles remained here until the English Civil War when Thornhill Hall was besieged. A royalist heroine after the siege of Sheffield Castle in 1644, Lady Anne Savile&#x27;s troops under Capt Thomas Paulden (brother of William Paulden) defended the hall against the Parliamentary forces under Col Sir Thomas Fairfax in August 1648. They were forced to surrender and the hall was destroyed. Some ruins of the hall and the moat remain in Rectory Park. The moat retains water.

The Old Rectory survived and was home to several vicars, notably John Michell, who rose to international prominence by developing an understanding of earthquakes, then devised an experiment to accurately determine the mass of planet Earth, but perhaps most intriguingly, attracted Benjamin Franklin (founding father of the USA), Joseph Priestley, Jan Ingenhousz, John Smeaton and others to a scientific meeting and overnight stay in 1771. Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s stay in Thornhill remained unknown until 2015.

Monuments to members of the Thornhill and Savile families are in Thornhill Parish Church.

===Industrial Revolution===
Thornhill has close ties to coal mining. The demand for coal increased due to the development of the steam engine. The local population increased as more workers were recruited for the mines. In 1893 an explosion at Combs Pit killed 139 coal miners. Thornhill Colliery resulted from the merging of Inghams and Combs Collieries in 1948 but closed in 1971.

==Governance==
Historically Thornhill (St Michael) was a large ecclesiastical parish and township in the wapentake of Agbrigg, West Riding of Yorkshire which joined the Dewsbury Poor Law Union in 1837. In 1894 Thornhill became an urban district. The district contained the civil parishes of Thornhill and Whitley Lower. In 1910 it was abolished and merged with Dewsbury County Borough. On 1 April 1925 the parish was abolished and merged with Dewsbury. In 1921 the parish had a population of 11,722.

==Geography==
Thornhill is situated on a flat-topped ridge to the south and east of the River Calder and the Calder and Hebble Navigation and north of the Howroyd Beck. The township covered and the underlying rock comprises coal measures. Thornhill encompasses the areas of Thornhill Lees in the valley by the Calder and the Calder and Hebble Navigation, Thornhill Edge, the Edge from the Old English &quot;ecg&quot; an escarpment the south-facing scarp slope that overlooks the valley of the Howroyd Beck; Overthorpe, from &quot;uferra&quot; and &quot;þorp&quot; was the upper outlying farmstead, now a residential area; and Fox Royd.

==Schools==
The Grade II listed former Thornhill Grammar School was built with money bequeathed by Charles Greenwood, Rector of Thornhill in 1643. A school endowed by Richard Walker dated from 1712.

Thornhill has two primary schools: Overthorpe (C of E) Junior and Infants and Thornhill Junior and Infants School. Thornhill Community Academy, the area&#x27;s secondary school had a GCSE pass rate of 84% in 2010, an increase of 22 percentage points from 2009. The school is a Science College. Much of the school has been refurbished and modernised. Construction of a sports hall was completed in April 2007 and includes a new Multi-Use Games Area.

==Sports==
Thornhill Trojans rugby league team play (2023) in the National Conference League Division 1. Overthorpe Sports football team play in the West Riding County Amateur League (Premier Division) on Saturdays and Overthorpe Town play in the Heavy Woollen Sunday League (First Division).
Thornhill United play at Rectory Park. Thornhill Rugby Club is based in Overthorpe Parks. Community facilities open to the public include a football pitch, rugby pitch and basketball court, a mini rugby pitch frequently used by the rugby club for the under tens junior team and a sports hall with a multi-use games area are at the local secondary school (the Community Science College at Thornhill).

The Savile Bowmen archery club shoots at Thornhill Cricket and Bowls Club. Three tennis courts are situated next to Thornhill Cricket and Bowls Club. Thornhill Tennis Club has two teams in the Huddersfield and District Tennis League.

==Amenities==
There are a number of local shops and off-licences in Thornhill and numerous takeaways ranging from traditional English to Italian cuisine. The nearest large supermarkets are in Dewsbury, which is connected by public transport. The area has two post offices with limited services. Overthorpe Post Office has recently undergone building work and is now part of the Onestop franchise.
Other shops and services include a florist, dental surgery, beauty salon, a computer repair shop, a tattoo studio, a fish and chip shop and a couple of Indian takeaways.

==Survey of English Dialects site==
The area was covered by the Survey of English Dialects in the belief that it was a hotbed of Yorkshire dialect. A 2005 study compared the 1964 Thornhill recording with a recording from nearby Ossett in 1999.

<doc id="151539" wikidata="Q3778556" url="?curid=151539" title="Thornhill, Dumfries and Galloway">
<text>Thornhill () is a village in the Mid Nithsdale area of Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland, south of Sanquhar and north of Dumfries on the main A76 road. Thornhill sits in the Nithsdale valley with the Carsphairn and Scaur range to the west and the Lowther hills to the east. It was initially a small village, planned and built in 1717 on the Queensberry Estate on the road linking Dumfries to Glasgow. The Earl of Queensberry initially named the village &#x27;New Dalgarnock&#x27; however the name did not achieve popular approval.

The village is primarily comprised a grid pattern with the main street of Drumlanrig Street (the A76), East and West Morton Streets, New Street, Townhead Street Station Road, Corstorphine road, and Gill Road (the A702).

The village is near Drumlanrig Castle, a 17th-century turreted mansion once the ancient Douglas stronghold, now home to the Duke of Buccleuch and Queensberry. The grounds contain Tibbers Castle which was founded in the 12th or 13th century.

The most recently published Census data from 2001 recorded the population at 1,512 inhabitants.

==Public Transport==
The village&#x27;s bus service is operated by the South West of Scotland Transport Partnership (SWESTRANS) incorporating a number of local and national operators.

Thornhill railway station, closed in 1965, is on the old Glasgow and South Western main line from Carlisle and Dumfries to Kilmarnock and Glasgow. The nearest train stations are located in Dumfries or Sanquhar.

In 2016 the local community council distributed a survey, and residents showed overwhelming support of the re-opening of the station. Recently a community action plan was released, which outlined the next steps for village development, and the station&#x27;s redevelopment is a current goal for the village.

==Education==
The rebuilt school gained its name, Wallace Hall, on amalgamation with the nearby Closeburn school of that name. The original Closeburn school was founded in 1723 by John Wallace, a merchant in Glasgow and native of Closeburn.

Wallace Hall Primary School and its Nursery moved into a new building in January 2010, as part of a shared campus with Academy.

Alumni include the golfer Andrew Coltart, Bobby Black (Scottish League internationalist and Scottish League Cup winning footballer and also all England bowls champion) is also from Thornhill. Colin Peacock, a long serving Scottish International Bowler and Commonwealth Games representative in 2006. Swimmer Moira Brown represented Scotland in the Commonwealth Games and Great Britain in the 1972 Munich Olympics as well as several other internationals.

Beginning in 2012, Thornhill Music Festival has grown into an annual community event, with regular attendees from all over the UK coming each year. The festival has grown each year thanks to the help of the local community, the committee, the venues, and other participants.

This Festival was started by The Lewis Hamilton Band who noticed a steady decline in available live music, and so in 2012 they decided to put on something similar to the established and successful Blues Festivals such as Shetland, Arbroath, Callander and in particular Montrose (they played at all of them several times), where all the bands are paid directly by the venues, but differing in that they wanted to broaden the musical scope. All venues apart from the Bowling Club are free entry all weekend.

From 2018, with the assistance of funding received from National Lottery Awards, Thornhill Music Festival is planning on bringing the music so enjoyed in the village venues, to those who are unable to attend. With the agreement of the local school, Wallace Hall, they plan to provide the music to both the Dementia Group at the Friendship Club and also to Briary Park Old People&#x27;s home. In 2018, the Festival launched their own website.

<doc id="151540" wikidata="Q2477019" url="?curid=151540" title="Max Bygraves">
<text>Walter William &quot;Max&quot; Bygraves (16 October 1922 – 31 August 2012) was an English comedian, singer, actor and variety performer. He appeared on his own television shows, sometimes performing comedy sketches between songs. 

He made twenty &quot;Royal Variety Performance&quot; appearances and presented numerous programmes, including &quot;Family Fortunes&quot; between 1983 and 1985. His catchphrase &quot;I wanna tell you a story&quot; became an integral part of his act, although it had originated with comedian Mike Yarwood impersonating Bygraves.

==Early life==
Bygraves was born to Henry and Lillian ( McDonnell) Bygraves (who wed in 1919) in Rotherhithe in London, where he grew up in a two-room council flat in Park Buildings, Paradise Street with his five siblings, his parents and a grandparent. His father was a professional flyweight boxer, known as Battling Tom Smith, and a casual dockworker. Brought up Catholic, he attended St Joseph&#x27;s School, Paradise Street, Rotherhithe, and sang with his school choir at Westminster Cathedral.

He left school at 14, working at the Savoy Hotel in London as a pageboy, but was sacked for being too tall. He later put some of his success as a variety performer down to his lanky physique. He was tall, but weighed only in adult life. He then became a messenger for W S Crawfords, an advertising agency at 233 High Holborn before serving as a fitter in the Royal Air Force in the Second World War and working as a carpenter. He changed his name to Max Bygraves in honour of comedian Max Miller.

==Career==
After the end of the war, Bygraves worked on building sites, while entertaining in pubs in the evenings. An early variety stage appearance in January 1945 was at the Grand, Clapham with a review stating &quot;A new impressionist. Max Bygraves, is also a lad to be watched. He has a little to learn in the art of showmanship, but not much, but there is no denying the brilliance of his impersonations.&quot;

In August 1946, he toured in a variety show with Frankie Howerd, who in turn introduced him to Eric Sykes, and they began writing routines together. With Sykes, he also developed the radio show &quot;Educating Archie&quot;, starring ventriloquist Peter Brough and his dummy Archie Andrews, and featuring Bygraves in the role of Archie&#x27;s teacher. The idea for the programme came from record producer Wally Ridley, who produced Bygraves&#x27; records during the 1950s.

In July 1950, he made his first appearance at the London Palladium supporting Abbott and Costello, and in 1951 he supported Judy Garland in her appearance there. Arising from this, she invited him to perform at the Palace in New York in October 1951.

Bygraves became a successful recording artist with seven top ten hits on the UK Singles Chart between 1952 and 1960. Many were novelty songs. One of his most popular recordings, &quot;You Need Hands&quot; in 1958, was written by Bygraves under the pseudonym Roy Irwin (or Erwin), a name picked at random from a telephone directory. He also wrote its follow-up, &quot;Gotta Have Rain&quot;. His producer Wally Ridley said of Bygraves:
He also occasionally worked as an actor, appearing in British films including &quot;Bless &#x27;Em All&quot; (1948) and &quot;Tom Brown&#x27;s Schooldays&quot; (1951). Bygraves appeared as himself in the 1954 British film musical &quot;Harmony Lane&quot; directed by Lewis Gilbert, and &#x27;What Now, Davros!&#x27;, with Helen Ball. He portrayed the title character in the 1956 film &quot;Charley Moon&quot; and starred in the 1961 drama &quot;Spare the Rod&quot;. In 1959, Bygraves bought the past and future rights to the Lionel Bart musical &quot;Oliver!&quot; for £350 at a time when Bart was experiencing severe financial difficulties. Bygraves later sold them for £250,000.

In the 1950s and 1960s, Bygraves appeared as a guest on several television variety programmes, both in the UK and United States. These included Ed Sullivan, Jack Benny and Jackie Gleason, in America. He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1961 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews while rehearsing his new show, &quot;Do Re Mi&quot; at London&#x27;s Prince of Wales Theatre. He appeared in several TV series including the sitcom &quot;Roamin&#x27; Holiday&quot; and the variety shows &quot;Max&quot; and &quot;Max Bygraves at the Royalty&quot;. From 1983 to 1985, Bygraves hosted &quot;Family Fortunes&quot;, taking over from his friend and fellow comedian Bob Monkhouse. He would later be succeeded as host in 1987 by Les Dennis.

From 1972, Bygraves recorded a series of albums, &quot;Sing Along With Max&quot; (later &quot;Singalongamax&quot;), in which he sang medleys of familiar songs aimed at an older audience. The albums, for Pye Records, sold millions of copies and led to spinoff shows and more recordings. In 1977, UK publishing house W. H. Allen published Bygraves&#x27; comic novel &quot;The Milkman&#x27;s on His Way&quot;.

Bygraves&#x27; catchphrase was said to be: &quot;I wanna tell you a story&quot;. Another well-known phrase of his was &quot;That&#x27;s a good idea, son!&quot;.

==Honours==
In 1982, Bygraves was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE).

==Personal life==
Bygraves married WAAF sergeant Gladys &quot;Blossom&quot; Murray in 1942. The couple had three children. Bygraves also had three other children from extramarital affairs.

On 9 August 1974, Bygraves became trapped on a cliff-face near his house in Westbourne, Bournemouth, while attempting to retrieve a kite flown by his grandson Michael which had become stuck beneath the edge of the cliff. Bygraves suffered friction burns on his hands and was in shock when police and firefighters helped him to safety. In 1999, Bygraves underwent treatment for an ear disorder, having cancelled a number of performances on his doctor&#x27;s advice.

He and Blossom Bygraves moved from Bournemouth to Queensland, Australia, in 2008. She died there in 2011 at the age of 88.

==Death==
Bygraves was diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in 2010, and he died from complications of this illness at his daughter&#x27;s home in Hope Island, Queensland, Australia on the evening of 31 August 2012.

<text>Thornhill is a village in the county of Cumbria, England, south of Whitehaven and north of Seascale, close to St. Bees, and only a few miles from the Irish Sea. The village was created by Whitehaven Rural District Council and Egremont Urban District Council in the 1920s, as part of the national campaign to improve housing conditions, keeping a promise made by the Government to soldiers fighting the First World War. Tenants moved into the first completed houses, on Thorny Road, late in 1921.

Thornhill is within the ancient parish of St John Beckermet, and Thornhill Mission is an Anglican Church under the Benefice of Beckermet, created so that parishioners would not have to travel to Beckermet to attend church.

In April 2010 The Parishes of St. John&#x27;s Beckermet and St. Bridgets Beckermet were reorganised to bring both Beckermet and Thornhill into the same parish. This was Beckermet Parish Council, which was renamed in June 2012 to Beckermet with Thornhill Parish Council.

The village is home to a small shop with sub Post Office, and a social club. Thornhill Primary School is also located in the centre of the village. The centre of the village also houses a community park and play area. There is also a parish council owned football pitch, with changing rooms, which are used by Thornhill Football Club.

<text>Thornhill () is a village in the Scottish council area of Stirling. It lies 14 miles north west of Stirling itself, south of Callander, east of Aberfoyle and west of Doune.

Historically part of Perthshire, the village is in the civil parish of Kincardine and the church parish of Norrieston (separated ecclesiastically from Kincardine in 1877), named from the much earlier village of Norrieston, which lay a little to the east of Thornhill. It is situated on a slight elevation at the western edge of the Carse of Stirling, an area of flat agricultural land which forms the upper part of the floodplain of the River Forth. Much of the land within the Carse was bogland until the late 18th century when concerted efforts were made to clear away the peat and expose the fertile clay soil below. Flanders Moss, the largest remaining area of lowland bog in Scotland and a site of special scientific interest, lies to the south west.

The village lies on a traditional east–west route from Dunblane to Aberfoyle which passes the Old Post Cottage and was planned and founded at the end of the seventeenth century.

The 2001 census population for the area covered by the Thornhill and Blairdrummond Community Council is 1,109.

Thornhill has one primary school which in the session 2009-2010 had 62 pupils from the village and surrounding area.

The ruins of a possible Iron Age broch lie at Boquhapple about 1 mile north of Thornhill. A mound of rubble about in diameter and the earthworks are all that remain today.

The name &quot;Thornhill&quot; is supposedly derived from the thorn covered ridge on which the village is situated. Thornhill was founded as an early planned village in 1696 and most buildings date from the 18th, 19th and 20th century.

It is believed to have the smallest Masonic Lodge in Scotland.

Thornhill has a community hall with a main hall, meeting rooms, kitchen, changing rooms with showers and parking. The hall is available for the use of locals and other groups.

Thornhill has one pub, The Lion and Unicorn, located on Main Street. It is thought to predate the founding of the village, starting life as a drovers&#x27; inn, possibly as early as 1635.
