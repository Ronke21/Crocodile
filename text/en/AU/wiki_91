<text>The University of Liverpool (abbreviated UOL) is a public research university in Liverpool, England. Founded in 1881 as University College Liverpool, Victoria University, it received Royal Charter by King Edward VII in 1903 attaining the decree to award degrees independently. The university withholds and operates assets on the National Heritage List, such as the Liverpool Royal Infirmary (origins in 1749), the Ness Botanic Gardens, and the Victoria Gallery &amp; Museum. 

Organised into three faculties divided by 35 schools and departments, the university offers more than 230 first degree courses across 103 subjects. It is a founding member of the Russell Group, and the research intensive association of universities in Northern England, the N8 Group. The phrase &quot;redbrick university&quot; was inspired by the Victoria Building, thus, the university is recognised as the original redbrick university.

Liverpool was the first UK university to establish departments in oceanography, civic design, architecture, and biochemistry (at the Johnston Laboratories), and also the first to establish an independent university campus in China, known as Xi&#x27;an Jiaotong-Liverpool University. The university has the ninth-largest endowment of any university in the UK and in 2023/24, it had an income of £705.3 million, of which £123.3 million was from research grants and contracts, with an expenditure of £515.8 million. 

As of 2024, the university holds four academic fellows of the Academy of Social Sciences and one of the British Academy. Ten Nobel prize laureates have been affiliated with Liverpool as alumni or academic staff, with notable alumni leading fields in medicine, law, business, engineering, arts, politics, and technology. Graduates of the university are styled with the post-nominal letters, &quot;Lpool&quot;, to indicate the institution.

==History==
===University College Liverpool===
The university was established in 1881 as College Liverpool, admitting its first students in 1882. In 1884, it became part of the federal Victoria University. In 1894 Oliver Lodge, a professor at the university, made the world&#x27;s first public radio transmission and two years later took the first surgical X-ray in the United Kingdom. The Liverpool University Press was founded in 1899, making it the third-oldest university press in England. Students in this period were awarded external degrees by the University of London.

===University status===
Following a royal charter and act of Parliament in 1903, it became an independent university (the University of Liverpool) with the right to confer its own degrees. The next few years saw major developments at the university, including Sir Charles Sherrington&#x27;s discovery of the synapse and William Blair-Bell&#x27;s work on chemotherapy in the treatment of cancer. In the 1930s to 1940s Sir James Chadwick and Sir Joseph Rotblat made major contributions to the development of the atomic bomb. From 1943 to 1966 Allan Downie, Professor of Bacteriology, was involved in the eradication of smallpox.

In 1994, the university was a founding member of the Russell Group, a collaboration of twenty leading research-intensive universities, as well as a founding member of the N8 Group in 2004. In the 21st century physicists, engineers and technicians from the University of Liverpool were involved in the construction of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, working on two of the four detectors in the LHC.

In 2004, Sylvan Learning, later known as Laureate International Universities, became the worldwide partner for University of Liverpool online. In 2019, it was announced that Kaplan Open Learning, part of Kaplan, Inc, would be the new partner for the University of Liverpool&#x27;s online programmes. Laureate continued to provide some teaching provision for existing students until 2021.

The university has produced ten Nobel Prize winners, from the fields of science, medicine, economics and peace. The Nobel laureates include the physician Sir Ronald Ross, physicist Charles Barkla, physicist Martin Lewis Perl, the physiologist Sir Charles Sherrington, physicist Sir James Chadwick, chemist Sir Robert Robinson, chemist Har Gobind Khorana, physiologist Rodney Porter, economist Ronald Coase and physicist Joseph Rotblat. Sir Ronald Ross was also the first British Nobel laureate in 1902. The university is also associated with Professors Ronald Finn and Sir Cyril Clarke who jointly won the Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award in 1980 and Sir David Weatherall who won the Lasker-Koshland Special Achievement Award in Medical Science in 2010. These Lasker Awards are popularly known as America&#x27;s Nobels.

Over the 2013/2014 academic year, members of staff took part in numerous strikes after staff were offered a pay rise of 1% which unions equated to a 13% pay cut since 2008. The strikes were supported by both the university&#x27;s Guild of Students and the National Union of Students. Some students at the university supported the strike, occupying buildings on campus.

==Campus and facilities==

The university is mainly based around a single urban campus approximately five minutes walk from Liverpool City Centre, at the top of Brownlow Hill and Mount Pleasant. Occupying 100 acres, it contains 192 non-residential buildings that house 69 lecture theatres, 114 teaching areas, and research facilities.

The main site is divided into three faculties: Health and Life Sciences; Humanities and Social Sciences; and Science and Engineering. The Veterinary Teaching Hospital (Leahurst) and Ness Botanical Gardens are based on the Wirral Peninsula. There was formerly a marine biology research station at Port Erin on the Isle of Man until it closed in 2006.

Fifty-one residential buildings, on or near the campus, provide 3,385 rooms for students, on a catered or self-catering basis. The centrepiece of the campus remains the university&#x27;s original red brick building, the Victoria Building. Opened in 1892, it has recently been restored as the Victoria Gallery and Museum, complete with cafe and activities for school visits.

In 2011 the university made a commitment to invest £660m into the &#x27;Student Experience&#x27;, £250m of which will reportedly be spent on Student Accommodation. Announced so far have been two large On-Campus halls of residences (the first of which, Vine Court, opened September 2012), new Veterinary Science facilities, and a £10m refurbishment of the Liverpool Guild of Students. New Central Teaching Laboratories for physics, earth sciences, chemistry and archaeology were opened in autumn 2012.

In 2013, the University of Liverpool opened a satellite campus in Finsbury Square in London, offering a range of professionally focussed masters programmes.

===Central Teaching Hub===
The Central Teaching Hub is a large multi-use building that houses a recently refurbished Lecture Theatre Block (LTB) and teaching facilities (Central Teaching Labs, CTL) for the Departments of Chemistry and Physics and the School of Environmental Sciences, within the university&#x27;s Central City Centre Campus. It was completed and officially opened in September 2012 with an estimated project cost of £23m. The main building, the &#x27;Central Teaching Laboratory&#x27;, is built around a large atrium and houses seven separate laboratories that can accommodate 1,600 students at a time. A flexible teaching space, computing centre, multi-departmental teaching spaces, and communal workspaces can also be found inside. The adjoining University Lecture Block building contains four lecture rooms and further social spaces.

===Sustainability===
In 2008, the University of Liverpool was voted joint seventeenth greenest university in Britain by WWF supported company Green League. This represents an improvement after finishing 55th in the league table the previous year.

The position of the university is determined by point allocation in departments such as Transport, Waste management, sustainable procurement and Emissions among other categories; these are then transpired into various awards. Liverpool was awarded the highest achievement possible in Environmental policy, Environmental staff, Environmental audit, Fair trade status, Ethical investment policy and Waste recycled while also scoring points in Carbon emissions, Water recycle and Energy source.

Liverpool was the first among UK universities to develop their desktop computer power management solution, which has been widely adopted by other institutions. The university has subsequently piloted other advanced software approaches further increasing savings. The university has also been at the forefront of using the Condor HTC computing platform in a power saving environment. This software, which makes use of unused computer time for computationally intensive tasks usually results in computers being left turned on. The university has demonstrated an effective solution for this problem using a mixture of Wake-on-LAN and commercial power management software.

The Interdisciplinary Centre for Sustainability Research (ICSR) was established in 2024 to tackle the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

==Organisation and structure==

The university is a research-based university with 33,000 students pursuing over 450 programmes spanning 54 subject areas. It has a broad range of teaching and research in both arts and sciences, and the University of Liverpool School of Medicine established in 1835 is today one of the largest medical schools in the UK. It also has close links to the neighbouring Royal Liverpool University Hospital.

The university has a students&#x27; union to represent students&#x27; interests, known as the Liverpool Guild of Students.

The university previously had a strategic partnership with Laureate International Universities, a for-profit college collective, for University of Liverpool online degrees. In 2019, the university announced a new partnership with Kaplan Open Learning for delivery of their online degrees.

The ratio of potato starch and wheat flour was improved to make it delicious even after a long time.

=== Korea ===

In Korea, authentic Japanese udon dishes are served in numerous Japanese restaurants, while the Korean-style udon noodle soups are served in &quot;bunsikjip&quot; (snack bars) and &quot;pojangmacha&quot; (street stalls). Both types are called &quot;udong&quot; (), which is the transliteration of the Japanese word &quot;udon&quot; (). In Korea, the word &quot;udong&quot; refers to noodle dishes (typically noodle soup), while the noodles themselves are called &quot;udong-myeon&quot; (; &quot;udong noodles&quot;) and considered a type of &quot;garak-guksu&quot; (; &quot;thick noodles&quot;). Common ingredients for &quot;udong&quot; noodle soup include crowndaisy greens and &quot;eomuk&quot; (fish cakes), neither of which are very common in Japanese udon dishes.

=== Palau ===
There is a dish called &quot;udong&quot; in Palau, originated from the former Japanese administration. The broth is soy sauce–based like Japanese udon. However, as there were many immigrants from Okinawa, it uses less broth like Okinawa soba. Most notably, the noodle is that of spaghetti, as it is easier to acquire there.

Languages of the neighboring Federated States of Micronesia also have similar loanwords from Japanese udon; Chuukese: , Pohnpeian: , Kosraean: , and .

A typical &quot;odong&quot; bowl is prepared with canned sardine and tomato sauce. Other dishes such as layering with greens are also popular. During the early 1900s, there was a large community of Japanese laborers in Davao, half of them Okinawans. In this period, the Japanese manufactured &quot;odong&quot;.

<doc id="156533" wikidata="Q249514" url="?curid=156533" title="Chebyshev's inequality">
<text>In probability theory, Chebyshev&#x27;s inequality (also called the Bienaymé–Chebyshev inequality) provides an upper bound on the probability of deviation of a random variable (with finite variance) from its mean. More specifically, the probability that a random variable deviates from its mean by more than formula_1 is at most formula_2, where formula_3 is any positive constant and formula_4 is the standard deviation (the square root of the variance).

The rule is often called Chebyshev&#x27;s theorem, about the range of standard deviations around the mean, in statistics. The inequality has great utility because it can be applied to any probability distribution in which the mean and variance are defined. For example, it can be used to prove the weak law of large numbers.

Its practical usage is similar to the 68–95–99.7 rule, which applies only to normal distributions. Chebyshev&#x27;s inequality is more general, stating that a minimum of just 75% of values must lie within two standard deviations of the mean and 88.88% within three standard deviations for a broad range of different probability distributions.

The term &quot;Chebyshev&#x27;s inequality&quot; may also refer to Markov&#x27;s inequality, especially in the context of analysis. They are closely related, and some authors refer to Markov&#x27;s inequality as &quot;Chebyshev&#x27;s First Inequality,&quot; and the similar one referred to on this page as &quot;Chebyshev&#x27;s Second Inequality.&quot;

Chebyshev&#x27;s inequality is tight in the sense that for each chosen positive constant, there exists a random variable such that the inequality is in fact an equality.

==History==
The theorem is named after Russian mathematician Pafnuty Chebyshev, although it was first formulated by his friend and colleague Irénée-Jules Bienaymé. The theorem was first proved by Bienaymé in 1853 and more generally proved by Chebyshev in 1867. His student Andrey Markov provided another proof in his 1884 Ph.D. thesis.

==Statement==
Chebyshev&#x27;s inequality is usually stated for random variables, but can be generalized to a statement about measure spaces.

===Probabilistic statement===
Let &quot;X&quot; (integrable) be a random variable with finite non-zero variance &quot;σ&quot;2 (and thus finite expected value &quot;μ&quot;). Then for any real number ,
: formula_5

Only the case formula_6 is useful. When formula_7 the right-hand side formula_8 and the inequality is trivial as all probabilities are ≤ 1.

As an example, using formula_9 shows that the probability values lie outside the interval formula_10 does not exceed formula_11. Equivalently, it implies that the probability of values lying within the interval (i.e. its &quot;coverage&quot;) is &quot;at least&quot; formula_11.

Because it can be applied to completely arbitrary distributions provided they have a known finite mean and variance, the inequality generally gives a poor bound compared to what might be deduced if more aspects are known about the distribution involved.

===Measure-theoretic statement===
Let (&quot;X&quot;, Σ, μ) be a measure space, and let &quot;f&quot; be an extended real-valued measurable function defined on &quot;X&quot;. Then for any real number &quot;t&quot; &gt; 0 and 0 &lt; &quot;p&quot; &lt; ∞,

:formula_13

More generally, if &quot;g&quot; is an extended real-valued measurable function, nonnegative and nondecreasing, with formula_14 then: 

:formula_15

This statement follows from the Markov inequality, formula_16, with formula_17 and formula_18, since in this case formula_19.
The previous statement then follows by defining formula_20 as formula_21 if formula_22 and formula_23 otherwise.

==Example==
Suppose we randomly select a journal article from a source with an average of 1000 words per article, with a standard deviation of 200 words. We can then infer that the probability that it has between 600 and 1400 words (i.e. within formula_24 standard deviations of the mean) must be at least 75%, because there is no more than formula_25 chance to be outside that range, by Chebyshev&#x27;s inequality. But if we additionally know that the distribution is normal, we can say there is a 75% chance the word count is between 770 and 1230 (which is an even tighter bound).

==Sharpness of bounds==
As shown in the example above, the theorem typically provides rather loose bounds. However, these bounds cannot in general (remaining true for arbitrary distributions) be improved upon. The bounds are sharp for the following example: for any &quot;k&quot; ≥ 1,
: formula_26

For this distribution, the mean &quot;μ&quot; = 0 and the variance &quot;σ&quot;2 = + 0 + = , so the standard deviation &quot;σ&quot; = and
: formula_27
Chebyshev&#x27;s inequality is an equality for precisely those distributions which are affine transformations of this example.

==Proof==

Markov&#x27;s inequality states that for any real-valued random variable &quot;Y&quot; and any positive number &quot;a&quot;, we have formula_28. One way to prove Chebyshev&#x27;s inequality is to apply Markov&#x27;s inequality to the random variable formula_29 with formula_30:
:formula_31

It can also be proved directly using conditional expectation:
:formula_32
Chebyshev&#x27;s inequality then follows by dividing by &quot;k&quot;2&quot;σ&quot;2.
This proof also shows why the bounds are quite loose in typical cases: the conditional expectation on the event where |&quot;X&quot; − &quot;μ&quot;| &lt; &quot;kσ&quot; is thrown away, and the lower bound of &quot;k&quot;2&quot;σ&quot;2 on the event |&quot;X&quot; − &quot;μ&quot;| ≥ &quot;kσ&quot; can be quite poor.

Chebyshev&#x27;s inequality can also be obtained directly from a simple comparison of areas, starting from the representation of an expected value as the difference of two improper Riemann integrals (last formula in the definition of expected value for arbitrary real-valued random variables).

==Extensions==
Several extensions of Chebyshev&#x27;s inequality have been developed.

===Selberg&#x27;s inequality===
Selberg derived a generalization to arbitrary intervals. Suppose &quot;X&quot; is a random variable with mean &quot;μ&quot; and variance &quot;σ&quot;&quot;2&quot;. Selberg&#x27;s inequality states that if formula_33,

: formula_34

When formula_35, this reduces to Chebyshev&#x27;s inequality. These are known to be the best possible bounds.

===Finite-dimensional vector===
Chebyshev&#x27;s inequality naturally extends to the multivariate setting, where one has &quot;n&quot; random variables with mean and variance &quot;σ&quot;i2. Then the following inequality holds.

:formula_36

This is known as the Birnbaum–Raymond–Zuckerman inequality after the authors who proved it for two dimensions. This result can be rewritten in terms of vectors with mean , standard deviation &quot;σ&quot; = (&quot;σ&quot;1, &quot;σ&quot;2, ...), in the Euclidean norm .

: formula_37

One can also get a similar infinite-dimensional Chebyshev&#x27;s inequality. A second related inequality has also been derived by Chen. Let be the dimension of the stochastic vector and let be the mean of . Let be the covariance matrix and . Then

: formula_38

where &quot;Y&quot;T is the transpose of .
The inequality can be written in terms of the Mahalanobis distance as

: formula_39

where the Mahalanobis distance based on S is defined by

: formula_40

Navarro proved that these bounds are sharp, that is, they are the best possible bounds for that regions when we just know the mean and the covariance matrix of X.

Stellato et al. showed that this multivariate version of the Chebyshev inequality can be easily derived analytically as a special case of Vandenberghe et al. where the bound is computed by solving a semidefinite program (SDP).

==== Known correlation ====

If the variables are independent this inequality can be sharpened.

:formula_41

Berge derived an inequality for two correlated variables . Let be the correlation coefficient between &quot;X&quot;1 and &quot;X&quot;2 and let &quot;σ&quot;&quot;i&quot;2 be the variance of . Then

: formula_42

This result can be sharpened to having different bounds for the two random variables and having asymmetric bounds, as in Selberg&#x27;s inequality.
Olkin and Pratt derived an inequality for correlated variables.

: formula_43

where the sum is taken over the &quot;n&quot; variables and

: formula_44, one can get a family of tail bounds

:formula_45

For &quot;n&quot; = 2 we obtain Chebyshev&#x27;s inequality. For &quot;k&quot; ≥ 1, &quot;n&quot; &gt; 4 and assuming that the &quot;n&quot;th moment exists, this bound is tighter than Chebyshev&#x27;s inequality. This strategy, called the method of moments, is often used to prove tail bounds.

===Exponential moment===
A related inequality sometimes known as the exponential Chebyshev&#x27;s inequality is the inequality

:formula_46

Let be the cumulant generating function,

: formula_47

Taking the Legendre–Fenchel transformation of and using the exponential Chebyshev&#x27;s inequality we have

: formula_48

This inequality may be used to obtain exponential inequalities for unbounded variables.

===Bounded variables===
If P(&quot;x&quot;) has finite support based on the interval , let where |&quot;x&quot;| is the absolute value of . If the mean of P(&quot;x&quot;) is zero then for all 

: formula_49

The second of these inequalities with is the Chebyshev bound. The first provides a lower bound for the value of P(&quot;x&quot;).

==Finite samples==

=== Univariate case ===
Saw &quot;et al&quot; extended Chebyshev&#x27;s inequality to cases where the population mean and variance are not known and may not exist, but the sample mean and sample standard deviation from &quot;N&quot; samples are to be employed to bound the expected value of a new drawing from the same distribution. The following simpler version of this inequality is given by Kabán.

: formula_50

where &quot;X&quot; is a random variable which we have sampled &quot;N&quot; times, &quot;m&quot; is the sample mean, &quot;k&quot; is a constant and &quot;s&quot; is the sample standard deviation.

This inequality holds even when the population moments do not exist, and when the sample is only weakly exchangeably distributed; this criterion is met for randomised sampling. A table of values for the Saw–Yang–Mo inequality for finite sample sizes (&quot;N&quot; &lt; 100) has been determined by Konijn. The table allows the calculation of various confidence intervals for the mean, based on multiples, C, of the standard error of the mean as calculated from the sample. For example, Konijn shows that for &quot;N&quot; = 59, the 95 percent confidence interval for the mean &quot;m&quot; is where (this is 2.28 times larger than the value found on the assumption of normality showing the loss on precision resulting from ignorance of the precise nature of the distribution).

An equivalent inequality can be derived in terms of the sample mean instead,

: formula_51

A table of values for the Saw–Yang–Mo inequality for finite sample sizes (&quot;N&quot; &lt; 100) has been determined by Konijn.

For fixed &quot;N&quot; and large &quot;m&quot; the Saw–Yang–Mo inequality is approximately

: formula_52

Beasley &quot;et al&quot; have suggested a modification of this inequality

: formula_53

In empirical testing this modification is conservative but appears to have low statistical power. Its theoretical basis currently remains unexplored.

====Dependence on sample size====
The bounds these inequalities give on a finite sample are less tight than those the Chebyshev inequality gives for a distribution. To illustrate this let the sample size &quot;N&quot; = 100 and let &quot;k&quot; = 3. Chebyshev&#x27;s inequality states that at most approximately 11.11% of the distribution will lie at least three standard deviations away from the mean. Kabán&#x27;s version of the inequality for a finite sample states that at most approximately 12.05% of the sample lies outside these limits. The dependence of the confidence intervals on sample size is further illustrated below.

For &quot;N&quot; = 10, the 95% confidence interval is approximately ±13.5789 standard deviations.

For &quot;N&quot; = 100 the 95% confidence interval is approximately ±4.9595 standard deviations; the 99% confidence interval is approximately ±140.0 standard deviations.

For &quot;N&quot; = 500 the 95% confidence interval is approximately ±4.5574 standard deviations; the 99% confidence interval is approximately ±11.1620 standard deviations.

For &quot;N&quot; = 1000 the 95% and 99% confidence intervals are approximately ±4.5141 and approximately ±10.5330 standard deviations respectively.

The Chebyshev inequality for the distribution gives 95% and 99% confidence intervals of approximately ±4.472 standard deviations and ±10 standard deviations respectively.

====Samuelson&#x27;s inequality====

Although Chebyshev&#x27;s inequality is the best possible bound for an arbitrary distribution, this is not necessarily true for finite samples. Samuelson&#x27;s inequality states that all values of a sample must lie within sample standard deviations of the mean.

By comparison, Chebyshev&#x27;s inequality states that all but a &quot;1/N&quot; fraction of the sample will lie within standard deviations of the mean. Since there are &quot;N&quot; samples, this means that no samples will lie outside standard deviations of the mean, which is worse than Samuelson&#x27;s inequality. However, the benefit of Chebyshev&#x27;s inequality is that it can be applied more generally to get confidence bounds for ranges of standard deviations that do not depend on the number of samples.

====Semivariances====
An alternative method of obtaining sharper bounds is through the use of semivariances (partial variances). The upper (&quot;σ&quot;+2) and lower (&quot;σ&quot;−2) semivariances are defined as

: formula_54

: formula_55

where &quot;m&quot; is the arithmetic mean of the sample and &quot;n&quot; is the number of elements in the sample.

The variance of the sample is the sum of the two semivariances:

: formula_56

In terms of the lower semivariance Chebyshev&#x27;s inequality can be written

: formula_57

Putting

: formula_58

Chebyshev&#x27;s inequality can now be written

: formula_59

A similar result can also be derived for the upper semivariance.

If we put

: formula_60

Chebyshev&#x27;s inequality can be written

: formula_61

Because &quot;σ&quot;u2 ≤ &quot;σ&quot;2, use of the semivariance sharpens the original inequality.

If the distribution is known to be symmetric, then

: formula_62

and

: formula_63

This result agrees with that derived using standardised variables.

;Note: The inequality with the lower semivariance has been found to be of use in estimating downside risk in finance and agriculture.

=== Multivariate case ===
Stellato et al. simplified the notation and extended the empirical Chebyshev inequality from Saw et al. to the multivariate case. Let formula_64 be a random variable and let formula_65. We draw formula_66 iid samples of formula_67 denoted as formula_68. Based on the first formula_69 samples, we define the empirical mean as formula_70 and the unbiased empirical covariance as formula_71. If formula_72 is nonsingular, then for all formula_73 then

: formula_74

==== Remarks ====
In the univariate case, i.e. formula_75, this inequality corresponds to the one from Saw et al. Moreover, the right-hand side can be simplified by upper bounding the floor function by its argument

: formula_76

As formula_77, the right-hand side tends to formula_78 which corresponds to the multivariate Chebyshev inequality over ellipsoids shaped according to formula_79 and centered in formula_80.

==Sharpened bounds==
Chebyshev&#x27;s inequality is important because of its applicability to any distribution. As a result of its generality it may not (and usually does not) provide as sharp a bound as alternative methods that can be used if the distribution of the random variable is known. To improve the sharpness of the bounds provided by Chebyshev&#x27;s inequality a number of methods have been developed; for a review see eg.

===Cantelli&#x27;s inequality===
Cantelli&#x27;s inequality due to Francesco Paolo Cantelli states that for a real random variable (&quot;X&quot;) with mean (&quot;μ&quot;) and variance (&quot;σ&quot;2)

: formula_81

where &quot;a&quot; ≥ 0.

This inequality can be used to prove a one tailed variant of Chebyshev&#x27;s inequality with &quot;k&quot; &gt; 0

:formula_82

The bound on the one tailed variant is known to be sharp. To see this consider the random variable &quot;X&quot; that takes the values

: formula_83 with probability formula_84
: formula_85 with probability formula_86

Then E(&quot;X&quot;) = 0 and E(&quot;X&quot;2) = &quot;σ&quot;2 and P(&quot;X&quot; &lt; 1) = 1 / (1 + &quot;σ&quot;2).

==== An application: distance between the mean and the median ====
The one-sided variant can be used to prove the proposition that for probability distributions having an expected value and a median, the mean and the median can never differ from each other by more than one standard deviation. To express this in symbols let &quot;μ&quot;, &quot;ν&quot;, and &quot;σ&quot; be respectively the mean, the median, and the standard deviation. Then

:formula_87

There is no need to assume that the variance is finite because this inequality is trivially true if the variance is infinite.

The proof is as follows. Setting &quot;k&quot; = 1 in the statement for the one-sided inequality gives:

:formula_88

Changing the sign of &quot;X&quot; and of &quot;μ&quot;, we get

:formula_89

As the median is by definition any real number &quot;m&quot; that satisfies the inequalities

:formula_90

this implies that the median lies within one standard deviation of the mean. A proof using Jensen&#x27;s inequality also exists.

===Bhattacharyya&#x27;s inequality===
Bhattacharyya extended Cantelli&#x27;s inequality using the third and fourth moments of the distribution.

Let formula_91 and formula_92 be the variance. Let formula_93 and formula_94.

If formula_95 then

:formula_96

The necessity of formula_95 may require formula_3 to be reasonably large.

In the case formula_99 this simplifies to
:formula_100
Since formula_101 for formula_3 close to 1, this bound improves slightly over Cantelli&#x27;s bound formula_103 as formula_104.

wins a factor 2 over Chebyshev&#x27;s inequality.

===Gauss&#x27;s inequality===
In 1823 Gauss showed that for a distribution with a unique mode at zero,

: formula_105

: formula_106

===Vysochanskij–Petunin inequality===
The Vysochanskij–Petunin inequality generalizes Gauss&#x27;s inequality, which only holds for deviation from the mode of a unimodal distribution, to deviation from the mean, or more generally, any center. If &quot;X&quot; is a unimodal distribution with mean &quot;μ&quot; and variance &quot;σ&quot;2, then the inequality states that

: formula_107 

: formula_108

For symmetrical unimodal distributions, the median and the mode are equal, so both the Vysochanskij–Petunin inequality and Gauss&#x27;s inequality apply to the same center. Further, for symmetrical distributions, one-sided bounds can be obtained by noticing that

:formula_109

The additional fraction of formula_110 present in these tail bounds lead to better confidence intervals than Chebyshev&#x27;s inequality. For example, for any symmetrical unimodal distribution, the Vysochanskij–Petunin inequality states that 4/(9 × 3^2) = 4/81 ≈ 4.9% of the distribution lies outside 3 standard deviations of the mode.

===Bounds for specific distributions===

DasGupta has shown that if the distribution is known to be normal

: formula_111

From DasGupta&#x27;s inequality it follows that for a normal distribution at least 95% lies within approximately 2.582 standard deviations of the mean. This is less sharp than the true figure (approximately 1.96 standard deviations of the mean).

*DasGupta has determined a set of best possible bounds for a normal distribution for this inequality.
*Steliga and Szynal have extended these bounds to the Pareto distribution.
*Grechuk et al. developed a general method for deriving the best possible bounds in Chebyshev&#x27;s inequality for any family of distributions, and any deviation risk measure in place of standard deviation. In particular, they derived Chebyshev inequality for distributions with log-concave densities.

==Related inequalities==
Several other related inequalities are also known.

===Paley–Zygmund inequality===
The Paley–Zygmund inequality gives a lower bound on tail probabilities, as opposed to Chebyshev&#x27;s inequality which gives an upper bound. Applying it to the square of a random variable, we get

: formula_112

===Haldane&#x27;s transformation===
One use of Chebyshev&#x27;s inequality in applications is to create confidence intervals for variates with an unknown distribution. Haldane noted, using an equation derived by Kendall, that if a variate (&quot;x&quot;) has a zero mean, unit variance and both finite skewness (&quot;γ&quot;) and kurtosis (&quot;κ&quot;) then the variate can be converted to a normally distributed standard score (&quot;z&quot;):

: formula_113

This transformation may be useful as an alternative to Chebyshev&#x27;s inequality or as an adjunct to it for deriving confidence intervals for variates with unknown distributions.

While this transformation may be useful for moderately skewed and/or kurtotic distributions, it performs poorly when the distribution is markedly skewed and/or kurtotic.

===He, Zhang and Zhang&#x27;s inequality===
For any collection of non-negative independent random variables with expectation 1 

: formula_114

==Integral Chebyshev inequality==

There is a second (less well known) inequality also named after Chebyshev

If &quot;f&quot;, &quot;g&quot; : [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;] → R are two monotonic functions of the same monotonicity, then

: formula_115

If &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; are of opposite monotonicity, then the above inequality works in the reverse way.

This inequality is related to Jensen&#x27;s inequality, Kantorovich&#x27;s inequality, the Hermite–Hadamard inequality and Walter&#x27;s conjecture.

===Other inequalities===

There are also a number of other inequalities associated with Chebyshev:

*Chebyshev&#x27;s sum inequality
*Chebyshev–Markov–Stieltjes inequalities

==Notes==

The Environmental Protection Agency has suggested best practices for the use of Chebyshev&#x27;s inequality for estimating confidence intervals.

<text>Super Furry Animals are a Welsh rock band formed in Cardiff in 1993. For the duration of their professional career, the band consisted of Gruff Rhys (lead vocals, guitar), Huw Bunford (lead guitar, vocals), Guto Pryce (bass guitar), Cian Ciaran (keyboards, synthesisers, various electronics, occasional guitar, vocals), and Dafydd Ieuan (drums, vocals). An earlier incarnation of the band featured actor Rhys Ifans on lead vocals. The band are considered to be part of the renaissance of Welsh culture which emerged in the 1990s: other Welsh bands of the time include the Manic Street Preachers, Stereophonics, Catatonia and Gorky&#x27;s Zygotic Mynci.

Super Furry Animals have recorded nine UK Albums Chart Top 25 studio albums (one BPI certified Gold and four certified Silver), plus numerous singles, EPs, compilations and collaborations. The band were known as central to the Cool Cymru era during which they were dominant, and are the act with the most top 40 hits without reaching the UK Singles Chart Top 10. Over the course of nine albums, Super Furry Animals has been described as &quot;one of the most imaginative bands of our time&quot; by &quot;Billboard&quot;, while according to a 2005 article in &quot;NME&quot;, &quot;There&#x27;s a case to be argued that [Super Furry Animals] were the most important band of the past 15 years&quot;.

==History==

===1990–1993: Formation===
Super Furry Animals formed in Cardiff in 1993 after being part of various other bands in Wales: Gruff Rhys and Dafydd Ieuan had played together in Ffa Coffi Pawb, whilst Huw Bunford and Guto Pryce were previously members of U Thant. Actor Rhys Ifans joined them as lead vocalist, and started to perform initially in a techno style before becoming more rock-orientated. Ifans would shortly leave however once his acting career took off, with Rhys stepping in on lead vocals. After Cian Ciaran (Ieuan&#x27;s younger brother) joined the band after being part of electronic outfit Wwzz, they signed to Ankst, a prolific Welsh indie label, in 1995.

The name of the band came from T-shirts being printed by Rhys&#x27; sister. She was making Super Furry Animals T-shirts for the fashion and music collective Acid Casuals (variants of whose name have appeared throughout Super Furry Animals&#x27; career – for example, in their song &quot;The Placid Casual&quot;, their record label Placid Casual). The band has also made reference to Blur, Elvis Costello, and Wynton Marsalis as major influences in their work.

===1994–1995: Early recordings===
The earliest Super Furry Animals track commercially available is &quot;Dim Brys: Dim Chwys&quot;, recorded in 1994 for Radio Cymru: an ambient piece, the track shows the band&#x27;s techno roots. However, by the time it was released (on the &quot;Triskedekaphilia&quot; compilation album in August 1995), the band had already put out their debut EP on the Ankst label. The &quot;Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyndrobwllantysiliogogogochynygofod (In Space)&quot; EP appeared in June 1995 and has been listed in the Guinness Book of Records as having the longest-ever title for an EP.

The &quot;Moog Droog&quot; EP followed in October 1995, named after the synthesiser manufacturer Robert Moog and the Nadsat term for &quot;friend&quot; in &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;. The EP&#x27;s title is also a pun on the Welsh slang for cannabis, literally &quot;bad (or naughty) smoke&quot;. The lyrics on all the tracks on both EPs were in Welsh, except for &quot;God! Show Me Magic&quot; from &quot;Moog Droog&quot;.

After gigging in London in late 1995, they were noticed by Creation Records boss Alan McGee at the Camden Monarch club, who signed them to his label. Creation was also home to Primal Scream, My Bloody Valentine and Teenage Fanclub, and had recently found massive commercial success with Oasis. The band have said that having watched their gig, McGee asked them if they could sing in English rather than Welsh in future shows. In fact, by this stage they were singing in English, but McGee did not realise because their Welsh accents were so strong. The Super Furry Animals received some criticism in the Welsh media for singing in English, something which the band felt &quot;completely pissed&quot; about. According to drummer Dafydd Ieuan: &quot;It all started when we played this festival in West Wales, and for some reason the Welsh media started foaming at the mouth because we were singing songs in Welsh and English. But they get The Dubliners playing and they do not sing in Irish. It&#x27;s ridiculous.&quot; The band have claimed that the decision to sing in English was taken in order to broaden their fanbase.

===1996–1998: &quot;Fuzzy Logic&quot; to &quot;Out Spaced&quot;===
In February 1996, the band&#x27;s debut on Creation, &quot;Hometown Unicorn&quot;, became New Musical Express&#x27;s Single of the Week, chosen by guest reviewers Pulp, and the first Super Furry Animals single to chart in the UK Top 50, peaking at No. 47. The follow-up, a re-recording of &quot;God! Show Me Magic&quot;, charted at No. 33 upon release in April 1996 and also became &quot;NME&quot; single of the week. Rawer than the &quot;Moog Droog&quot; version, it clocks in at 1 min 50 secs. In May, their debut album &quot;Fuzzy Logic&quot; was released, to wide critical acclaim. Sales were slow, with the album peaking at No. 23 in the charts, but it garnered a little more interest when next single &quot;Something 4 the Weekend&quot; (a reworked, more mellow version of the album track) was given considerable radio airplay and charted at No. 18 in July 1996.

The final single from the album, &quot;If You Don&#x27;t Want Me to Destroy You&quot;, was to have been backed by a track called &quot;The Man Don&#x27;t Give a Fuck&quot;. However, there were problems in clearing a sample from &quot;Showbiz Kids&quot; by Steely Dan which formed the basis of the chorus, and it was switched for a different track. The single charted at No. 18. However, Super Furry Animals regarded &quot;The Man Don&#x27;t Give a Fuck&quot; as one of their best songs and continued their efforts to clear the sample. When they managed this, there was no upcoming release to attach it to – so it came out as a limited edition single in its own right, in December 1996. This ultimately cemented its legendary status and did much to establish Super Furry Animals as cult heroes, as the song contained the word &quot;fuck&quot; over 50 times and therefore received practically no airplay. However, it hit No. 22 in the charts and became Super Furry Animals&#x27; standard closing number when they played live.

In early 1997, Super Furry Animals embarked on the &quot;NME&quot; Brats Tour and completed work on a speedy follow-up to &quot;Fuzzy Logic&quot;. Two singles preceded the new album, &quot;Hermann ♥&#x27;s Pauline&quot; in May and &quot;The International Language of Screaming&quot; in July, hitting No. 26 and No. 24 respectively: these releases were the first to feature cover art from Pete Fowler, who went on to design the sleeves of all their releases up until 2007&#x27;s &quot;Hey Venus&quot;. The album, &quot;Radiator&quot;, hit shelves in August. The reviews were, if anything, better than those for &quot;Fuzzy Logic&quot;, and it sold more quickly than its predecessor, reaching a peak of No. 8: however, Creation did not serve the album particularly well by releasing it just four days after the long-awaited new effort from Oasis, &quot;Be Here Now&quot;. Two further singles, &quot;Play It Cool&quot; (released September 1997) and &quot;Demons&quot; (November 1997) both hit No. 27 in the charts, suggesting that Super Furry Animals had hit a commercial ceiling though which they were struggling to break. However, they had established themselves as favourites in the music press, a cut above the majority of their Britpop peers.

After a chance to think about their music and their direction, Super Furry Animals decided to record a new EP in early 1998 at Gorwel Owen&#x27;s house and released it in May. This was the &quot;Ice Hockey Hair&quot; EP, widely held as one of their finest moments (&quot;ice hockey hair&quot; is a slang term for a mullet.) Featuring four tracks, the EP sampled from Black Uhuru. The title track, a melodic and very moving epic, gained airplay while &quot;Smokin&#x27;&quot;. In a &quot;Melody Maker&quot; interview, Super Furry Animals said the &quot;Smokin&#x27;&quot; referred to smoking haddock, or to truck drivers&#x27; tyres when they&#x27;re &#x27;burnin&#x27; the roads&#x27;. It became their most successful single up to this point, hitting No. 12 in the charts and leading to a memorable appearance on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;.

In November 1998, the album &quot;Out Spaced&quot; was released. This was a collection of songs from the 1995 Ankst releases (including &quot;Dim Brys: Dim Chwys&quot;), the band&#x27;s favourite B-sides, plus &quot;The Man Don&#x27;t Give a Fuck&quot; and &quot;Smokin&#x27;&quot;. A limited edition appeared in a comedy rubber sleeve, shaped like a nipple.

===1999–2000: &quot;Guerrilla&quot; and &quot;Mwng&quot;===
In 1999, &quot;NME&quot; readers named them &#x27;best new band&#x27; in January (this despite the fact it was now three years since they released their debut album). In May, the single &quot;Northern Lites&quot; was released and made No. 11 in the charts. A dense production, with steel drums clattering out a calypso rhythm whilst Rhys sang an irreverent lyric about the El Niño-Southern Oscillation weather phenomenon, it was an apt taster for the new album, &quot;Guerrilla&quot;. Recorded at the Real World Studios, the album retained SFA&#x27;s pop melodies but took a less guitar-centric approach to their execution and was their most experimental work to date. Layers of samples over brass, percussion and Gruff&#x27;s melodic singing produced an album which took the freewheeling approach of 1960s groups such as The Beatles, The Beach Boys and The Velvet Underground and updated it to the late 1990s. The album swung from glam and garage rock numbers (&quot;Night Vision&quot;, &quot;The Teacher&quot;) to novelty techno (&quot;Wherever I Lay My Phone (That&#x27;s My Home)&quot;), ambient indietronica (&quot;Some Things Come From Nothing&quot;) and upbeat drum and bass (&quot;The Door To This House Remains Open&quot;). For the cover art, Pete Fowler created the band&#x27;s first three-dimensional models, rather than the paintings he had supplied for the &quot;Radiator&quot; album and singles.

After playing several of the summer festivals, SFA released &quot;Fire in My Heart&quot;, the most soulful track from &quot;Guerrilla&quot;, in August and saw it chart at No. 25. They then embarked on a US and UK tour. SFA finished their UK tour at the Cardiff International Arena in Cardiff, where they showcased the first ever concert in surround sound and broadcast it on the World Wide Web.

January 2000 involved a series of changes for SFA. The last single from &quot;Guerrilla&quot;, &quot;Do or Die&quot;, was released and made No. 20. It was also the last single SFA released on Creation Records, as founder Alan McGee set off to pursue other interests. It had always been SFA&#x27;s plan to release their next album on their own label, Placid Casual, as it would be a deliberate sidestep from their recent work: a largely acoustic album of Welsh language songs entitled &quot;Mwng&quot;. Meaning &quot;mane&quot;, its lilting melodies established that SFA&#x27;s songwriting did not have to fall back on head-spinning production tricks. A limited edition (of 3000) 7 inch record, &quot;Ysbeidiau Heulog&quot; (meaning &quot;Sunny Intervals&quot;) preceded &quot;Mwng&quot; in May 2000. It came backed with &quot;Charge&quot;, a hard-rock jam recorded as a Peel Session for the BBC. The album, released the same month, sold remarkably well for a non-English LP – it made No. 11 in the charts – and received a rare distinction for a pop record, being commended in Parliament for its efforts in keeping the Welsh language alive.

2000 also saw the Furries contribute two tracks, Free Now and Peter Blake 2000, for the Liverpool Sound Collage project, which was nominated for a Grammy. They undertook this remixing of unreleased Beatles recordings at the invitation of Paul McCartney, whom they had met at the NME Awards, where they had won Best Live Act.

===2001–2003: &quot;Rings Around the World&quot; and &quot;Phantom Power&quot;===
With the demise of Creation, SFA needed to find a new label for their next album. Sony had long held a substantial stake in Creation and offered deals to many ex-Creation artists, including SFA, who signed with one of Sony&#x27;s subsidiaries, Epic. The band pushed for a deal which allowed them to take a new album elsewhere if the label was not interested in releasing it – thereby allowing them to find a home for any esoteric project they might want to undertake in the future.

The greater resources afforded them by Epic were apparent in their first album for the label, &quot;Rings Around the World&quot;, an album that recaptured the cohesive, experimental feel of &quot;Guerrilla&quot; but more song-driven and sonically expansive. It is cited by many critics and fans alike as their most polished and accessible work. Again the first single was a good indication of what was to come: &quot;Juxtapozed with U&quot;, released in July 2001, was a lush soul record which made No. 14 in the charts. The album followed in the same month and major label marketing muscle made it their biggest-seller to date, reaching No. 3 in the album charts. One of the tracks from the album, &quot;Receptacle For the Respectable&quot; featured Paul McCartney on &quot;carrot and celery rhythm track&quot; (a homage to his performance on the Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;Vegetables&quot;). SFA unleashed their experimental side on tracks such as &quot;Sidewalk Serfer Girl&quot; (which switches between light techno-pop and hardcore punk), &quot;[A] Touch Sensitive&quot; (gloomy trip-hop) and &quot;No Sympathy&quot; (which descends into chaotic drum&#x27;n&#x27;bass), but also apparent was an angrier edge to the lyrics: &quot;Run! Christian, Run!&quot; seemed to be an attack on the complacency of organised religion.

&quot;Rings Around the World&quot; is also remarkable for being the world&#x27;s first simultaneous release of an audio and DVD album. It was nominated for the Mercury Music Prize in 2001. The ceremony took place on the day after the terror attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, and SFA&#x27;s performance of the album track &quot;It&#x27;s Not the End of the World?&quot; took on a somewhat bitter edge. It was released as a single in January 2002 (chart No. 30), following &quot;(Drawing) Rings Around the World&quot; (chart No. 28): neither had that much impact but still received some airplay, notably on BBC Radio 2.

The next album, &quot;Phantom Power&quot;, relied less on sound experimentation and proved to be a more stripped-down, back-to-basics recording in contrast to the orchestral &quot;Rings Around the World&quot;. It was also released as both a CD and DVD album in July 2003, preceded by a single, &quot;Golden Retriever&quot;, in June (chart No. 13). Although the reviews for the album were generally good and it sold well initially, charting at No. 4, the album broke little new ground by SFA&#x27;s standards and the band had fallen out of fashion, receiving little coverage in the music press. Another single, &quot;Hello Sunshine&quot;, hit No. 31 in October 2003 and was eventually featured on the soundtrack of &quot;The O.C.&quot;.

===2004–2005: &quot;Phantom Phorce&quot; to &quot;Love Kraft&quot;===
Perhaps recognising that their approach to &quot;Phantom Power&quot; had been a little too straightforward, the group followed it up in 2004 with a remix version, &quot;Phantom Phorce&quot;, with tracks reworked by the likes of Killa Kela, Four Tet and Brave Captain. They accompanied this with a download single, &quot;Slow Life&quot;, which also included the track &quot;Motherfokker&quot;, a collaboration with Goldie Lookin Chain, both tracks are now available as a free download via the Placid Casual website. In October 2004 the band released a best of album, &quot;&quot;, accompanied by a single – a live version of &quot;The Man Don&#x27;t Give a Fuck&quot; (chart No. 16).

In early 2005, Gruff Rhys released a solo album &quot;Yr Atal Genhedlaeth&quot;, (&quot;The Stuttering Generation&quot;, and also a play on words as &quot;Atal Genhedlu&quot; means contraception), sung all in Welsh. Gruff played most of the instruments himself, mainly using guitars, drums and his own multi-tracked voice. The band also selected tracks for a volume in the &quot;Under the Influence&quot; series of compilations, in which artists present the songs that they feel have most contributed to their sound.

In 2005 Super Furry Animals were asked to put together the sixth release from the &#x27;Under The Influence&#x27; series - &quot;Under the Influence: Super Furry Animals&quot;. Each member chose 3 track each - Pryce&#x27;s selections were Dawn Penn &quot;You Don&#x27;t Love Me (No, No, No)&quot;, Dennis Wilson and Rumbo &quot;Lady&quot; and MC5 &quot;Kick Out the Jams&quot;.

Also in 2005 it was reported that the band turned down a US$1.8m advertising deal with Coca-Cola after visiting a Coca-Cola plantation in Colombia with charity War on Want, where they heard of management-directed killings of trade-union members. The company were asking for use of &quot;Hello Sunshine&quot; as part of their campaign. In a statement to British magazine &quot;Q&quot;, Coca-Cola denied the allegations, stating they had been &quot;an exemplary member of the business community&quot; in Colombia.

In August 2005, Super Furry Animals released their seventh studio effort, &quot;Love Kraft&quot;, recorded in Spain. This represented a departure from their previous working methods: although all five members had always contributed to the development of the songs, Rhys had been the main songwriter. On &quot;Love Kraft&quot; this was no longer the case, as Rhys, Bunford, Ieuan and Ciaran all contributed songs and lead vocals. There was only one single from the album, &quot;Lazer Beam&quot;, released on 15 August (chart No. 28). The laid-back ambience recalls early-1970s Beach Boys albums such as &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot; (which SFA have referred to as one of their favourite albums), whilst the heavy use of strings suggested the likes of Scott Walker and Curtis Mayfield. The album&#x27;s cool commercial reception (it charted at just No. 19) suggested that they had returned to their familiar status of critically acclaimed cult favourites. &quot;Love Kraft&quot; was also the last album released under Epic Records, as their contract expired in early 2006.

===2006–2008: Rough Trade and &quot;Hey Venus!&quot;===
Ciaran&#x27;s side project Acid Casuals released their debut album &quot;Omni&quot; in January 2006 on the Placid Casual label. Drummer Ieuan formed a band known as The Peth which has been described by Rhys in various magazine articles as &quot;Satanic Abba&quot;: the band also reunites Rhys Ifans with the SFA family, as he takes lead vocal duties.

The band signed to Rough Trade Records during 2006 and are reportedly working on three projects for the label. Gruff Rhys has also signed for Rough Trade Records as a solo artist in his own right and released a single on 7&quot; vinyl and download entitled &quot;Candylion&quot; in late 2006 which preceded an album of the same name that was released during the second week of 2007. Unlike his debut &quot;Yr Atal Genhedlaeth&quot;, &quot;Candylion&quot; is primarily sung in English but has two Welsh tracks and one in &quot;bad Spanish&quot;: it is primarily an acoustic album, and came about because Rhys has written several acoustic pop songs that did not fit with the direction of the new SFA record.

During this time some of the bands&#x27; music was used prominently in The Rock-afire Explosion documentary movie, namely &quot;Hello Sunshine&quot; and &quot;Some things Come From Nothing&quot;.

Recording sessions took place in a chateau in the south of France in 2007 for the band&#x27;s first release for Rough Trade, &quot;Hey Venus!&quot;, which was released on 27 August that year. Gruff himself described the record as &quot;speaker blowing&quot;. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Show Your Hand&quot;, failed to enter the top 40, their first to do so since 1996&#x27;s &quot;Hometown Unicorn&quot;, despite modest airplay. The album itself fared much better, peaking at No. 11 and was a slight improvement from the sales of &quot;Love Kraft&quot;. The album became their first to enter the iTunes Music Store top 10 album charts, peaking at No. 9. Over the 2007 Christmas period SFA released a single, &quot;The Gift That Keeps Giving&quot;, free from their website.

===2009–2014: &quot;Dark Days/Light Years&quot; and hiatus ===
On 16 March 2009, Super Furry Animals released their ninth and final studio album, &quot;Dark Days/Light Years&quot;, digitally via their website. The album&#x27;s progress was recorded in a series of short films that were shown on the band&#x27;s website in the build-up to the release. Later in March, they performed the record in its entirety through an exclusive stream on their website. A physical release on Rough Trade Records followed on 21 April, resulting in a number 23 UK Chart placement. &quot;Dark Days/Light Years&quot; notably featured a guest appearance from Nick McCarthy of Franz Ferdinand on &quot;Inaugural Trams.&quot; &quot;Dark Days/Light Years&quot; received strong critical feedback, with The Guardian writing that &quot;it has more spark and invention than most teen bands manage on their debuts.&quot;

In 2010, Super Furry Animals went on what became a five-year hiatus, as bassist Guto Pryce revealed in an interview with Wales Online. Pryce noted that the band expected to reconvene as soon as the members finished with the various projects they were working on.

Super Furry Animals reconvened for one performance on 29 February 2012 at Cardiff City Stadium before a Wales v Costa Rica Gary Speed Memorial Match, in tribute to the late Welsh footballer and team manager.

In 2014, craft brewer The Celt Experience created a tribute &quot;Fuzzy Beer&quot; in collaboration with the band.

===2015–2016: Reunion===
In May 2015, the band played several gigs from early May to September to accompany a major reissue of their 15-year-old album &quot;Mwng&quot;, which had been out of print. The same month a biography, &quot;Rise of the Super Furry Animals&quot;, was published by HarperCollins. In January 2016, the band announced their first North American tour in six years. In May 2016, the band released &quot;Bing Bong&quot;, their first single in seven years. The song was released to celebrate the Wales national football team&#x27;s qualification for UEFA Euro 2016. They headlined the Caught by the River Festival in August 2016, and announced the re-release of &quot;Fuzzy Logic&quot;. A compilation album, &quot;Zoom! The Best of 1995–2016&quot;, was released on 4 November 2016. The final tour of their reunion, in which they played both &quot;Fuzzy Logic&quot; and &quot;Radiator&quot; in full across the UK and Ireland, took place in December 2016.

===2017–present: Second hiatus and Das Koolies===
In September 2018, the official Super Furry Animals Twitter feed posted an announcement of a multi-disc set of recordings made at the BBC to be released on 23 November 2018.

In 2019 Bunford, Ciaran, Pryce, and Ieuan reformed without Rhys under the name Das Koolies, an alter ego SFA used around 2000 for an experimental electronic album that was never officially released. Das Koolies released their debut single &quot;It&#x27;s All About The Dolphins&quot; on 29 January 2020. According to Ciaran, Das Koolies is now their main focus; they are no longer focusing on anything from Super Furry Animals.

On March 4, 2022, the band made the first song they ever recorded, &quot;Of No Fixed Identity&quot;, recorded in 1993 and featuring Rhys Ifans on lead vocals, available for one week only on Bandcamp, with all the proceeds going towards Save the Severn, an ongoing environmental campaign to protect the Severn Estuary.

<text>&quot;Two&quot; is the season 3 premiere and 66th episode overall of the American television anthology series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. The episode stars Charles Bronson and Elizabeth Montgomery.

The radio adaptation of this episode starred Don Johnson in the Charles Bronson role.

==Opening narration==

==Plot==
A woman wearing a tattered uniform stumbles into a deserted city. She spots what was a restaurant and finds a can of chicken in the kitchen. A man in a different, well-worn uniform soon enters the kitchen, and after a brief scuffle, knocks her out and eats half the chicken. He later wakes the woman by dumping a pot of water on her face. He says there is no reason to fight anymore, as there are no more armies, but eventually realizes that she cannot understand him and departs. She eats the canned chicken he left for her.

The woman tracks him down, and they wander down the street, coming to a movie theater. He stares at a poster for a wartime romance film and turns to smile at her. They find the skeletal remains of soldiers at the theater entrance and abruptly grab the rifles of the dead owners, simultaneously aiming at each other. After a tense moment, the man turns and walks away, slinging his weapon over his shoulder.

The woman follows him, and the two walk along the city street. They stop in front of a store with a cocktail dress in the smashed display window. Upon her saying &quot;Prekrasnyy&quot; (Russian for &quot;beautiful&quot;), he hands the dress to her and tells her to put it on. She enters an office next to the department store to change into the dress, but then she notices the jingoistic enlistment posters on the wall and realizes it is a recruiting office for the other side. She grabs her rifle, exits the office and angrily shoots at the man twice, but misses. He gets up, looks at her incredulously, and walks away.

The next morning, the man has changed out of his uniform into a tuxedo without a shirt and has found two jars of peaches. He sees the woman waiting for him, peeking up from behind a truck in the street below. He yells at her to leave, to &quot;take your war to more suitable companions.&quot; She steps out into the street, wearing the dress. He joins her, tosses one of the jars to her and says &quot;Prekrasnyy&quot;. She smiles, and the two walk away together.

==Closing narration==

==Music==
An abbreviated version of the music for this episode, composed by Nathan Van Cleave, served as the basis for the opening and closing music for the radio drama &quot;CBS Radio Mystery Theater&quot;. The episode relies heavily on the music as there is very little dialogue throughout.

==Production notes==

This episode was filmed on the backlot of Hal Roach Studios in Culver City, California, which was falling apart due to mismanagement and disuse (the facilities were finally torn down in 1963). Very little set decoration was needed to create the illusion of an abandoned city. The interior bracing that holds up the facade is visible through the second story windows in the opening shots of the episode and the credits.

The sound for the &quot;blaster&quot; was taken from &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot;, where Robby the Robot exclaims that an Earthman&#x27;s weapon was &quot;a simple blaster&quot;.

<text>In music, a single is a type of release of a song recording of fewer tracks than an album (LP), typically one or two tracks. A single can be released for sale to the public in a variety of physical or digital formats. Singles may be standalone tracks or connected to an artist&#x27;s album, and in the latter case would often have at least one single release before the album itself, called lead singles.

The single was defined in the mid-20th century with the &quot;45&quot; (named after its speed in revolutions per minute), a type of 7-inch sized vinyl record containing an A-side and a B-side, i.e. one song on each side. The single format was highly influential in pop music and the early days of rock and roll, and it was the format used for jukeboxes and preferred by younger populations in the 1950s and 1960s.

Singles in digital form became very popular in the 2000s. Distinctions for what makes a &quot;single&quot; have become more tenuous since: the biggest digital music distributor, the iTunes Store, only accepts as singles releases with three tracks or fewer that are less than ten minutes each (with longer releases being classified as &quot;EPs&quot; or &quot;albums&quot;). However, releases which do not fit these criteria have been promoted as singles by artists and labels elsewhere, such as on Spotify and the Bandcamp storefront.

Nowadays physically-released music is mainly bought in the form of full-length albums instead of singles. The most common physical formats of singles had been the 7&quot; (45) vinyl records and the CD single, but singles have also been released on other formats such as 12&quot; vinyl records, 10&quot; shellac records, cassette single, and mini CD.

==Early history==
The origins of the single are in the late 19th century, when music was distributed on phonograph cylinders that held two to four minutes&#x27; worth of audio. They were superseded by disc phonograph records, which initially also had a short duration of playing time per side. In the first two to three decades of the 20th century, almost all commercial music releases were, in effect, singles (the exceptions were usually for classical music pieces, where multiple physical storage media items were bundled together and sold as an album). Phonograph records were manufactured with a range of playback speeds (from 16 to 78 rpm) and in several sizes (including ). By about 1910, however, the , 78-rpm shellac disc had become the most commonly used format.

The inherent technical limitations of the gramophone disc defined the standard format for commercial recordings in the early 20th century. The relatively crude disc-cutting techniques of the time and the thickness of the needles used on record players limited the number of grooves per inch that could be inscribed on the disc surface and a high rotation speed was necessary to achieve acceptable recording and playback fidelity. 78 rpm was chosen as the standard because of the introduction of the electrically powered synchronous turntable motor in 1925, which ran at 3,600 rpm with a 46:1 gear ratio, resulting in a rotation speed of 78.3 rpm.

With these factors applied to the 10-inch format, songwriters and performers increasingly tailored their output to fit the new medium. The three-minute single remained the standard into the 1960s, when the availability of microgroove recording and improved mastering techniques enabled recording artists to increase the duration of their recorded songs. The breakthrough came in the U.K. with The Animals &quot;The House of The Rising Sun&quot; of 4 minutes 29 seconds (cut down to 2 minutes 59 seconds for the U.S.A. market) in 1964, followed by Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot; in 1965: although Columbia Records tried to make the record more &quot;radio-friendly&quot; by cutting the performance into halves and separating them between the two sides of the disc, both Dylan and his fans demanded that the full six-minute take be placed on one side and that radio stations play the song in its entirety. The next milestone, which cemented pop radio&#x27;s tolerance for longer songs, was the Beatles Hey Jude; released August 1968 it clocked in at over seven minutes, pushing the limits of the 45 rpm single.

==Types of physical singles==
Singles have been issued in various formats, including , 10-inch and 12-inch discs, usually playing at 45 rpm; 10-inch shellac discs, playing at 78 rpm; maxi singles; 7-inch plastic flexi discs; cassettes; CD singles, and less commonly on Digital Compact Cassette and many non-standard sizes of vinyl disc (, , etc.). Singles were also released on DVD and Laserdisc video formats, which would additionally contain music videos to be watched on a display such as a television set.

===7-inch format===
The most common form of the vinyl single is the &quot;45&quot; or &quot;7-inch&quot;. The names are derived from its play speed, 45 rpm, and the standard diameter, . The 45 rpm speed was chosen to allow a minute playing time from the 7-inch disc.

The 7-inch 45 rpm record was released March 31, 1949, by RCA Victor as a smaller, more durable and higher-fidelity replacement for the 78 rpm shellac discs. The first 45 rpm records were monaural, with recordings on both sides of the disc. As stereo recordings became popular in the 1960s, almost all 45 rpm records were produced in stereo by the early 1970s. Columbia Records, which had released the  rpm 12-inch vinyl LP in June 1948, also released  rpm 7-inch vinyl singles in March 1949, but they were soon eclipsed by the RCA Victor 45. The first regular production 45 rpm record pressed was &quot;PeeWee the Piccolo&quot;: RCA Victor 47-0146 pressed December 7, 1948 at the Sherman Avenue plant in Indianapolis; R.O. Price, plant manager.

The claim made that 48-0001 by Eddy Arnold was the first 45 is evidently incorrect (even though 48-0000 has not turned up, 50-0000-Crudup, 51-0000-Meisel, and 52-0000 Goodman are out there) since all 45s were released simultaneously with the 45 player in March 1949. There was plenty of information leaked to the public about the new 45 rpm system through front-page articles in &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine on December 4, 1948, and again on January 8, 1949. RCA was trying to blunt the lead Columbia had established upon releasing their   LP system in June 1948.
To compete with Columbia, RCA released albums as boxes of 45 rpm seven-inch singles that could be played continuously like an LP on their record changer. RCA was also releasing 7-inch singles pressed in different colors for different genres, making it easy for customers to find their preferred music. The novelty of multicolored singles wore off soon: by 1952, all RCA singles were pressed in black vinyl. The lowest recording numbers found (so far) for each genre of RCA 45s are: 47-0146 yellow, 47-2715 black, 48-0001 green, 49-0100 deep red, 50-0000 cerise, 51-0000 light blue. 52-0000 deep blue. What became of 48-0000 is not known, perhaps a copyright or other legal problem.

The lightweight and inexpensive 45 rpm discs introduced by RCA were quickly popular and in the early 1950s all major US labels had begun manufacturing seven-inch singles. In the decades that followed, the seven-inch single was the format that many major artists made their recording debut on and some recordings were exclusively released as vinyl 45s only. According to the &quot;New York Times&quot;, the popularity of the seven-inch single reached a peak in 1974 when 200 million were sold. In the 1980s its popularity began to decline as jukeboxes became fewer, consumers tended to prefer to buy albums and formats such as cassettes and CDs was overtaking vinyl 45s. Despite its major decline, vinyl seven-inch singles has continued to released in the 2000s by indie labels such as Sub Pop and Third Man Records.

====Variations====

In some regions (e.g. US), the default hole size fitted the original RCA hub which, due to a format war, was incompatible with the spindle of a Columbia-system 33 1/3 RPM 12-inch LP player. In other regions (e.g. UK, Australia), the default was a small hole compatible with a multi-speed 0.25-inch spindle player, but with a &quot;knock out&quot; that could be removed for usage on a larger hub player.

One could play a large-hole record on a player with a quarter-inch spindle by inserting a single &quot;puck&quot; or by using a spindle adapter.

===12-inch format===

Although 7 inches remained the standard size for vinyl singles, 12-inch singles were introduced for use by DJs in discos in the 1970s. The longer playing time of these singles allowed the inclusion of extended dance mixes of tracks. In addition, the larger surface area of the 12-inch discs allowed for wider grooves (larger amplitude) and greater separation between grooves, the latter of which results in less cross-talk. Consequently, they are less susceptible to wear and scratches. The 12-inch single is still considered a standard format for dance music, though its popularity has declined in recent years.

===10-inch format===
Before the 7-inch single was introduced, 78 rpm 10-inch shellac records with around three minutes of music on them were the standard format. Later, 10-inch vinyl singles have commonly been released as limited edition collectors items, which sometimes includes rare tracks or special artwork.

==Digital era==
With the rise of digital downloading and audio streaming, individual tracks within an album became accessible separately. Despite this shift, the notion of a &quot;single&quot; from an album remains, pinpointing the more promoted or favored songs. The surge in music downloads escalated following the introduction of Apple&#x27;s iTunes Store originally known as iTunes in January 2001, along with the emergence of portable music devices like the iPod.

In September 1997, with the release of Duran Duran&#x27;s &quot;Electric Barbarella&quot; for paid downloads, Capitol Records became the first major label to sell a digital single from a well-known artist. Previously, Geffen Records also released Aerosmith&#x27;s &quot;Head First&quot; digitally for free. In 2004, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) introduced digital single certification due to significant sales of digital formats, with Gwen Stefani&#x27;s &quot;Hollaback Girl&quot; becoming RIAA&#x27;s first platinum digital single. In 2013, RIAA incorporated on-demand streams into the digital single certification.

Single sales in the United Kingdom reached a low in January 2005, as the popularity of the compact disc was overtaken by the then-unofficial medium of the music download. Recognizing this, on 17 April 2005, Official UK Singles Chart added the download format to the existing format of physical CD singles. Gnarls Barkley was the first act to reach No.1 on this chart through downloads alone in April 2006, for their debut single &quot;Crazy&quot;, which was released physically the following week. On 1 January 2007, digital downloads (including unbundled album tracks) became eligible from the point of release, without the need for an accompanying physical. Sales gradually improved in the following years, reaching a record high in 2008 that still proceeded to be overtaken in 2009, 2010 and 2011.

In the late 2010s, artists began a trend of releasing multiple singles before eventually releasing a studio album. An unnamed A&amp;R representative confirmed to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 2018 that &quot;an artist has to build a foundation to sustain&quot; and added that &quot;When artists have one big record and go run with that, it doesn&#x27;t work because they never had a foundation to begin with.&quot; The same article cited examples such as Cardi B, Camila Cabello and Jason Derulo releasing four or more singles prior to their album releases. Kanye West released singles weekly in 2010 with his GOOD Fridays series. He did this to support his upcoming release at the time, &quot;My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy&quot;, and ended up releasing 15 tracks in the program.

CD singles and 7-inch records are now obscure and uncommon for new releases: as of the 2020s singles are predominantly digital, and physical releases are mainly full-length albums instead, on CD and 12-inch LPs.

==Culture==

The sales of singles are recorded in record charts in most countries in a Top 40 format. The charts are often published in magazines and numerous television shows and radio programs count down the list. To be eligible for inclusion in charts, the single must meet the requirement set by the charting company that governs the playing time of the single.

In popular music, the commercial and artistic importance of the single (as compared to the EP or album) has varied over time, technological development, and according to the audience of particular artists and genres. Singles have generally been more important to artists who sell to the youngest purchasers of music (younger teenagers and pre-teens), who tend to have more limited financial resources.

Starting in the mid-1960s, albums became a greater focus and became more important as artists created albums of uniformly high-quality and coherent themes, a trend that reached its apex in the development of the concept album. Over the 1990s and the early 2000s, the single generally received less and less attention in the United States as albums, which on compact disc had virtually identical production and distribution costs but could be sold at a higher price, became most retailers&#x27; primary method of selling music. Singles continued to be produced in the UK and Australia and survived the transition from compact disc to digital download. The decline of the physical single in the US during this time has been cited as a major marketing mistake on the part of record companies, as it eliminated an inexpensive recording format for young fans to become accustomed to purchasing music. In its place was the predominance of the album, which alienated customers by the expense of purchasing a longer format for only one or two songs of interest. That in turn encouraged interest in file sharing software on the internet like Napster for single recordings, which began to undercut the music recording market.

Dance music, however, has followed a different commercial pattern and the single, especially the 12-inch vinyl single, remains a major method by which dance music is distributed.

Another development of the 2000s was the popularity of mobile phone ringtones based on pop singles. In September 2007, Sony BMG announced that it would introduce a new type of CD single, called &quot;ringles&quot;, for the 2007 holiday season. The format included three songs by an artist, plus a ringtone accessible from the user&#x27;s computer. Sony announced plans to release 50 singles in October and November, and Universal Music Group expected to release somewhere between 10 and 20 titles. In a reversal of this trend, a single has been released based on a ringtone itself: the Crazy Frog ringtone, which was a cult hit in Europe in 2004, was released as a mashup with &quot;Axel F&quot; in June 2005 amid a massive publicity campaign and subsequently hit No. 1 on the UK chart.

The term &quot;single&quot; is sometimes regarded as a misnomer since one record usually contains two songs: the A-side and B-side. In 1982, CBS marketed one-sided singles at a lower price than two-sided singles.

===In South Korea===
In South Korean music, the terminology for &quot;albums&quot; and &quot;singles&quot; is unique and includes an additional term, the single album (). In contemporary usage in English, the term &quot;album&quot; refers to an LP-length recording regardless of the medium. In contrast, under the country&#x27;s copyright law, the Korean usage of &quot;album&quot; () denotes a musical recording of any length that is released specifically on physical media. A &quot;single album&quot; refers to a physical release (such as a CD, LP, or other media) that typically contains one to three unique tracks, while a &quot;single&quot; is only a song itself, typically a digital stream or download. Although the terms &quot;single albums&quot; and &quot;singles&quot; are similar and sometimes may overlap, they are generally considered two distinct release types in South Korea. In Western contexts, a &quot;single album&quot; would otherwise be called a &quot;single&quot; or &quot;extended play&quot;, depending on the length.

As a distinct release type, the single album developed during the CD era in the 1990s. Single albums were marketed as a more affordable alternative to a full-length CD album. The Circle Album Chart tracks sales of all albums released as physical media (described as &quot;offline&quot; media), therefore, single albums compete alongside full-length studio albums (LPs) and mini-albums (EPs) on the chart, even if they only contain one song. The Circle Digital Chart, which tracks downloads and streams of sole tracks, is regarded as the official &quot;singles&quot; chart.

To give an example of the differences between full-length albums, single albums, and singles, the K-pop girl group Wonder Girls released the single album &quot;The Wonder Begins&quot;, which consists of the single &quot;Irony&quot; alongside two other unique tracks and a remix. &quot;Irony&quot; was later included on their debut studio album &quot;The Wonder Years&quot;.

A single album is distinct from a single even if it includes only one song. The single &quot;Gotta Go&quot; by Chungha was released on a single album titled &quot;XII&quot;, which was a one-track CD. Even though &quot;Gotta Go&quot; was the only song on &quot;XII&quot;, the two releases charted separately: &quot;XII&quot; reached No.4 on the Gaon Album Chart, and &quot;Gotta Go&quot; reached No.2 on the Circle Digital Chart. Even when a single album and single share the same name, they still chart separately, as was the case with the Wonder Girls single album and single &quot;Why So Lonely&quot;: the single album peaked at No. 3 on the Gaon Album Chart, while the single peaked at No. 1 on the Gaon Digital Chart.

<doc id="156541" wikidata="Q215233" url="?curid=156541" title="A-side and B-side">
<text>The A-side and B-side are the two sides of phonograph records and cassettes, and the terms have often been printed on the labels of two-sided music recordings. The A-side usually features a recording that its artist, producer, or record company intends to be the initial focus of promotional efforts and radio airplay, with the aim of it becoming a hit record. The B-side (or &quot;flip-side&quot;) is a secondary recording that typically receives less attention, although some B-sides have been as successful as, or more so than, their A-sides.

Use of this language has largely declined in the 21st century as the music industry has transitioned away from analog recordings towards digital formats without physical sides, such as downloads and streaming. Nevertheless, some artists and labels continue to employ the terms &quot;A-side&quot; and &quot;B-side&quot; metaphorically to describe the type of content a particular release features, with &quot;B-side&quot; sometimes representing a &quot;bonus&quot; track or other material.

==History==
Conventions shifted in the early 1960s, at which point record companies started assigning the song they wanted radio stations to play to side A, as 45 rpm single records (&quot;45s&quot;) dominated most markets in terms of cash sales in comparison to albums, which did not fare as well financially. Throughout the decade the industry would slowly shift to an album-driven paradigm for releasing new music; it was not until 1968 that the total production of albums on a unit basis finally surpassed that of singles in the United Kingdom.

Today, with the vast majority of music released and accessed digitally on streaming services, the traditional A-side/B-side is obsolete as a technological necessity. Nonetheless, some contemporary artists have added on a second track to a single release as a nominal B-side, which can serve as an aesthetic choice as well as a promotional tool.

==Double A-side==
A &quot;double A-side&quot;, &quot;AA-side&quot;, or &quot;dual single&quot; is a single where both sides are designated the A-side, with no designated B-side; that is, both sides are prospective hit songs and neither side will be promoted over the other. In 1949, Savoy Records promoted a new pair of singles by one of its artists, Paul Williams&#x27; &quot;House Rocker&quot; and &quot;He Knows How to Hucklebuck&quot;, as &quot;The New Double Side Hit – Both Sides &#x27;A&#x27; Sides&quot;. In 1965, &quot;Billboard&quot; reported that due to a disagreement between EMI and John Lennon about which side of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;We Can Work It Out&quot; and &quot;Day Tripper&quot; single should be considered the A-side and receive the plugging, &quot;EMI settled for a double-side promotion campaign—unique in Britain.&quot;

In the UK, before the advent of digital downloads, both A-sides were accredited with the same chart position, for the singles chart was compiled entirely from physical sales. In the UK, the biggest-selling non-charity single of all time was a double A-side, Wings&#x27; 1977 release &quot;Mull of Kintyre&quot;/&quot;Girls&#x27; School&quot;, which sold over two million copies. It was also the UK Christmas No. 1 that year. Nirvana released &quot;All Apologies&quot; and &quot;Rape Me&quot; as a double A-side in 1993, and both songs are accredited as a hit on both the UK Singles Chart and the Irish Singles Chart.

== B/W ==
The term &quot;b/w&quot;, an abbreviation of &quot;backed with&quot;, is often used in listings to indicate the B-side of a record. The term &quot;c/w&quot;, for &quot;coupled with&quot;, is used similarly.

==Characteristics==
B-sides are often considered to be filler material: songs of lower quality. However, some pop artists such as Prince, The Smiths, Def Leppard, Oasis, Bon Jovi and The Beatles have been particularly known for releasing strong material on B-sides. B-sides have often been compiled on expanded or &quot;deluxe&quot; editions of albums or may be compiled into a &quot;B-side compilation album&quot; across multiple periods of an artist&#x27;s career.

<text>&quot;The Arrival&quot; is the second episode of the third season and 67th overall episode of the American television anthology series &quot;The Twilight Zone.&quot; It was written by the series&#x27; creator and showrunner Rod Serling, and was directed by Boris Sagal.

==Opening narration==
==Plot==

After Flight 107, a propeller-driven Douglas DC-3 from Buffalo, lands safely with no crew or passengers aboard, the FAA sends Grant Sheckly, an inspector with 22 years of experience and proud of his flawless record of solving cases, to investigate the matter. He is assisted by the airport staff — vice president Bengston, PR man Malloy, mechanic Robbins, and ramp attendant Cousins — but despite their combined efforts, no one can explain how an empty plane could safely land and taxi to a stop. Sheckly is nagged by the familiarity of the pilots&#x27; and passengers&#x27; names.

The investigation continues to prove fruitless until Robbins remarks about the plane&#x27;s blue seats, which puzzles Sheckly, who remembers them from when he entered the plane as being brown. Bengston further says they were red. When they examine the plane&#x27;s tail and each see different registration numbers, Sheckly claims the plane is not real, merely an illusion each of them has imagined somehow.

To prove his hypothesis, as well as to break the illusion, Sheckly proposes a simple, yet potentially fatal, test: he will put his arm in the arc of the plane&#x27;s turning propeller. Despite their objections, he convinces the staff to go along with it, and Robbins starts the plane&#x27;s engines. After some hesitation, Sheckly places his arm directly into the spinning propeller; just as he predicted, his arm remains unharmed, and the plane vanishes. However, when Sheckly successively turns to the others, he is met only with silence as they each disappear, just as the plane did.

Calling out for the staff, Sheckly makes his way back to the Operations room where he finds Bengston and Malloy, only to discover that they have no recollection of the empty plane or Sheckly&#x27;s investigation. When asked, Bengston states that Flight 107 landed safely with full crew and passengers and shows him a newspaper article to prove it. But as Sheckly continues to press them about losing &quot;Flight 107&quot;, Bengston remembers that the only plane the airline ever lost was a Flight 107, 17 or 18 years previously. The case had been investigated by Sheckly but was never solved, the only case he never figured out, closed as &quot;presumed crashed for reasons unknown&quot; at sea. Sheckly staggers away and wanders through the airfield he calls out, demanding to know the fate of Flight 107, then slumps onto the ramp as the sound of an aircraft&#x27;s jet engine is heard passing overhead.

==Closing narration==
==Critical responses==
&quot;The show now seems to be feeding off itself. Last Friday&#x27;s episode, unless it proves to be an exception in the new skein, doesn&#x27;t augur well for the future of the series. &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; seems to be running dry of inspiration.&quot; —&quot;from the Variety review.&quot;

”You should track down the episode. It’s not the strongest you’ll see of season three, let alone any other, but it has a kick ass moment of extreme tension that stands as quite memorable. At least to this particular viewer. Rod Serling delivers another slice of quality entertainment. The double twist earns major points.” —&quot;from the Addicted to Horror Movies review.&quot;

<doc id="156546" wikidata="Q1265202" url="?curid=156546" title="Stepin Fetchit">
<text>Lincoln Theodore Monroe Andrew Perry (May 30, 1902 – November 19, 1985), better known by the stage name Stepin Fetchit, was an American vaudevillian, comedian, and film actor of Jamaican and Bahamian descent, considered to be the first black actor to have a successful film career. His highest profile was during the 1930s in films and on stage, when his persona of Stepin Fetchit was billed as the &quot;Laziest Man in the World&quot;.

Perry parlayed the Fetchit persona into a successful film career, becoming the first black actor to earn $1 million. He was also the first black actor to receive featured screen credit in a film.

Perry&#x27;s film career slowed after 1939 and nearly stopped altogether after 1953. Around that time, Black Americans began to see his Stepin Fetchit persona as an embarrassing and harmful anachronism, echoing negative stereotypes. However, the Stepin Fetchit character has undergone a re-evaluation by some scholars in recent times, who view him as an embodiment of the trickster archetype.

==Early life==
Little is known about Perry&#x27;s background other than that he was born in Key West, Florida, to West Indian immigrants. He was the second child of Joseph Perry, a cigar maker from Jamaica (although some sources indicate the Bahamas) and Dora Monroe, a seamstress from Nassau, The Bahamas. Both of his parents came to the United States in the 1890s, where they married. By 1910, the family had moved north to Tampa, Florida. Another source says he was adopted when he was 11 years old and taken to live in Montgomery, Alabama.

His mother wanted him to be a dentist, so Perry was adopted by a quack dentist, for whom he blacked boots before running away at age 12 to join a carnival. He earned his living for a few years as a singer and tap dancer.

==Vaudeville career==
In his teens, Perry became a comic character actor. By the age of 20, Perry had become a vaudeville artist and the manager of a traveling carnival show. His stage name was a contraction of &quot;step and fetch it&quot;. His accounts of how he adopted the name varied, but generally he claimed that it originated when he performed a vaudeville act with a partner. Perry won money betting on a racehorse named &quot;Step and Fetch It&quot;, and his partner and he decided to adopt the names &quot;Step&quot; and &quot;Fetchit&quot; for their act. When Perry became a solo act, he combined the two names, which later became his professional name.

==Film career==

Perry played comic-relief roles in a number of films, all based on his character known as the &quot;Laziest Man in the World&quot;. In his personal life, he was highly literate and had a concurrent career writing for &quot;The Chicago Defender&quot;. He signed a five-year studio contract following his performance in the film, &quot;In Old Kentucky&quot; (1927). The film&#x27;s plot included a romantic connection between Perry and actress Carolynne Snowden, a subplot that was a rarity for black actors appearing in a white film during this era. Perry also starred in &quot;Hearts in Dixie&quot; (1929), one of the first studio productions to boast a predominantly black cast.

Jules Bledsoe provided Perry&#x27;s singing voice for his role as Joe in the 1929 version of &quot;Show Boat&quot;. Fetchit did not sing &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot;, but he did sing &quot;The Lonesome Road&quot; in the film. In 1930, Hal Roach signed him to a film contract to appear in nine &quot;Our Gang&quot; episodes in 1930 and 1931. However, his only appearance in the series was in &quot;A Tough Winter&quot;. Perry&#x27;s contract was canceled for unknown reasons after its release.

Perry was good friends with fellow comic actor Will Rogers. They appeared together in &quot;David Harum&quot; (1934), &quot;Judge Priest&quot; (1934), &quot;Steamboat &#x27;Round the Bend&quot; (1935), and &quot;The County Chairman&quot; (1935).
By the mid-1930s, Perry was the first black actor to become a millionaire. He appeared in 44 films between 1927 and 1939. In 1940, Perry temporarily stopped appearing in films, having been frustrated by his unsuccessful attempt to get equal pay and billing with his white costars. He returned in 1945, in part due to financial need, though he only appeared in eight films between 1945 and 1953. He declared bankruptcy in 1947, stating assets of $146. He returned to vaudeville; he appeared at the Anderson Free Fair in 1949 alongside Singer&#x27;s Midgets. He became a friend of heavyweight boxing champion Muhammad Ali in the 1960s, allegedly converting to the Nation of Islam shortly before. (Other sources have said he was a lifelong Catholic; he was buried at Calvary Cemetery, a Catholic institution in Los Angeles.)

After 1953, Perry appeared in cameos in the made-for-television movie &quot;Cutter&quot; (1972) and the feature films &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; (1974) and &quot;Won Ton Ton, the Dog Who Saved Hollywood&quot; (1976). He found himself in conflict during his career with civil rights leaders who criticized him personally for the film roles that he portrayed. In 1968, CBS aired the hour-long documentary &quot;Black History: Lost, Stolen, or Strayed&quot;, written by Andy Rooney (for which Rooney received an Emmy Award) and narrated by Bill Cosby, which criticized the depiction of black people in American film, and especially singled out Stepin Fetchit for criticism. After the show aired, Perry unsuccessfully sued CBS and the documentary&#x27;s producers for defamation of character.

== Music composition ==
In late November 1963, Perry collaborated with Motown Records founder Berry Gordy Jr. and Esther Gordy Edwards in composing &quot;May What He Lived for Live,&quot; a song intended to honor the memory of President John F. Kennedy in the wake of his assassination. Perry was credited under the pseudonym W.A. Bisson. The song was recorded in December 1963 by Liz Lands, who in 1968 performed the work at the funeral of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.

==Death==
Perry suffered a stroke in 1976, ending his acting career; he then moved into the Motion Picture &amp; Television Country House and Hospital. He died on November 19, 1985, from pneumonia and heart failure, at the age of 83. He was buried at Calvary Cemetery in East Los Angeles following a Catholic funeral Mass.

==Legacy==
Perry spawned imitators, such as Willie Best (&quot;Sleep &#x27;n Eat&quot;) and Mantan Moreland, the scared, wide-eyed manservant of Charlie Chan. Perry had actually played a manservant in the &quot;Charlie Chan&quot; series before Moreland in 1935&#x27;s &quot;Charlie Chan in Egypt&quot;.

Perry appeared in one 1930 &quot;Our Gang&quot; short subject, &quot;A Tough Winter,&quot; at the end of the 1929–30 season. Perry signed a contract to star with the gang in nine films for the 1930–31 season and be part of the &quot;Our Gang&quot; series, but for some unknown reason, the contract fell through, and the gang continued without Perry. Previous to Perry entering films, the &quot;Our Gang&quot; shorts had employed several black child actors, including Allen Hoskins, Jannie Hoskins, Ernest Morrison, and Eugene Jackson. In the sound &quot;Our Gang&quot; era, black actors Matthew Beard and Billie Thomas were featured. The black performers&#x27; personas in &quot;Our Gang&quot; shorts were the polar opposites of Perry&#x27;s persona.

In the 2005 book &quot;Stepin Fetchit: The Life and Times of Lincoln Perry&quot;, African-American critic Mel Watkins argued that the character of Stepin Fetchit was not truly lazy or simple-minded, but instead a prankster who deliberately tricked his white employers so that they would do the work instead of him. This technique, which developed during American slavery, was referred to as &quot;putting on old massa&quot;, and it was a kind of con art with which black audiences of the time would have been familiar.

=== Awards and honors ===
Fetchit has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

In 1976, despite popular aversion to his character, the Hollywood chapter of the NAACP awarded Perry a special NAACP Image Award. Two years later, he was inducted into the Black Filmmakers Hall of Fame.

==Personal life==
In 1929, Perry married Dorothy Stevenson. She gave birth to their son, Jemajo, on September 12, 1930. In 1931, Dorothy filed for divorce, stating that Perry had broken her nose, jaw, and arm with &quot;his fists and a broomstick.&quot; A few weeks after their divorce was granted, Dorothy told a reporter she hoped someone would &quot;just beat the devil out of him,&quot; as he had done to her. When Dorothy contracted tuberculosis in 1933, Perry moved her to Arizona for treatment. She died in September 1934.

Perry reportedly married Winifred Johnson in 1937, but no record of their union has been found. On May 21, 1938, Winifred gave birth to a son, Donald Martin Perry. Their relationship ended soon after Donald&#x27;s birth. According to Winifred&#x27;s brother, Stretch Johnson, their father intervened after Perry knocked Winifred down the stairs and broke her nose. In 1941, Perry was arrested after Winifred filed a suit for child support. When he was released from jail, he told reporters, &quot;Winnie and I were never married. It was all a publicity stunt. I want you and everybody else to know that that is not my baby. Winnie knows the baby isn&#x27;t mine but she&#x27;s trying to be smart.&quot; Winifred admitted that they were not legally married, but she insisted Perry was her son&#x27;s father. The court ruled in her favor and ordered Perry to pay $12 a week () for the child&#x27;s support. Donald later took his stepfather&#x27;s surname, Lambright.

Perry married Bernice Sims on October 15, 1951. Although they separated by the mid-1950s, they remained married for the rest of their lives. Bernice died on January 9, 1985.

For at least the great majority of his life, Perry was a devout Catholic, but he allegedly became a member of the Nation of Islam in the early 1960s, following the footsteps of his close friends Muhammad Ali and Malcolm X, even appearing in the 1977 movie &quot;Muhammad Ali, the Greatest&quot;. (Other sources say he was a lifelong Catholic; he was buried at Calvary Cemetery, a Catholic institution in Los Angeles.)

<text>A remix (or reorchestration) is a piece of media which has been altered or contorted from its original state by adding, removing, or changing pieces of the item. A song, piece of artwork, book, poem, or photograph can all be remixes. The only characteristic of a remix is that it appropriates and changes other materials to create something new.

Most commonly, remixes are a subset of audio mixing in music and song recordings. Songs may be remixed for a large variety of reasons:
* to adapt or revise a song for radio or nightclub play
* to create a stereo or surround sound version of a song where none was previously available
* to improve the fidelity of an older song for which the original master has been lost or degraded
* to alter a song to suit a specific music genre or radio format
* to use some of the original song&#x27;s materials in a new context, allowing the original song to reach a different audience
* to alter a song for artistic purposes
* to provide additional versions of a song for use as bonus tracks or for a B-side, for example, in times when a CD single might carry a total of 4 tracks
* to create a connection between a smaller artist and a more successful one, as was the case with Fatboy Slim&#x27;s remix of &quot;Brimful of Asha&quot; by Cornershop
* to improve the first or demo mix of the song, generally to ensure a professional product.
* to improve a song from its original state
Remixes should not be confused with edits, which usually involve shortening a final stereo master for marketing or broadcasting purposes. Another distinction should be made between a remix, which recombines audio pieces from a recording to create an altered version of a song, and a cover: a re-recording of someone else&#x27;s song.

While audio mixing is one of the most popular and recognized forms of remixing, this is not the only media form which is remixed in numerous examples. Literature, film, technology, and social systems can all be argued as a form of remix.

== Origins ==

Since the beginnings of recorded sound in the late 19th century, technology has enabled people to rearrange the normal listening experience. With the advent of easily editable magnetic tape in the 1940s and 1950s and the subsequent development of multitrack recording, such alterations became more common. In those decades the experimental genre of musique concrète used tape manipulation to create sound compositions. Less artistically lofty edits produced medleys or novelty recordings of various types.

Modern remixing had its roots in the dance hall culture of late-1960s and early-1970s Jamaica. The fluid evolution of music that encompassed ska, rocksteady, reggae and dub was embraced by local music mixers who deconstructed and rebuilt tracks to suit the tastes of their audience. Producers and engineers like Ruddy Redwood, King Tubby and Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry popularized stripped-down instrumental mixes (which they called &quot;versions&quot;) of reggae tunes. At first, they simply dropped the vocal tracks, but soon more sophisticated effects were created, dropping separate instrumental tracks in and out of the mix, isolating and repeating hooks, and adding various effects like echo, reverberation and delay. The German krautrock band Neu! also used other effects on side two of their album Neu! 2 by manipulating their previously released single &quot;Super/Neuschnee&quot; multiple ways, utilizing playback at different turntable speeds or mangling by using a cassette recorder.

From the mid-1970s, DJs in early discothèques were performing similar tricks with disco songs (using loops and tape edits) to get dancers on the floor and keep them there. One noteworthy figure was Tom Moulton who invented the dance remix as we now know it. Though not a DJ (a popular misconception), Moulton had begun his career by making a homemade mix tape for a Fire Island dance club in the late 1960s. His tapes eventually became popular and he came to the attention of the music industry in New York City. At first, Moulton was simply called upon to improve the aesthetics of dance-oriented recordings before release (&quot;I didn&#x27;t do the remix, I did the mix&quot;—Tom Moulton). Eventually, he moved from being a &quot;fix it&quot; man on pop records to specializing in remixes for the dance floor. Along the way, he invented the breakdown section and the 12-inch single vinyl format. Walter Gibbons provided the dance version of the first commercial 12-inch single (&quot;Ten Percent&quot;, by Double Exposure). Contrary to popular belief, Gibbons did not mix the record. In fact his version was a re-edit of the original mix. Moulton, Gibbons and their contemporaries (Jim Burgess, Tee Scott, and later Larry Levan and Shep Pettibone) at Salsoul Records proved to be the most influential group of remixers for the disco era. The Salsoul catalog is seen (especially in the UK and Europe) as being the &quot;canon&quot; for the disco mixer&#x27;s art form. Pettibone is among a very small number of remixers whose work successfully transitioned from the disco to the House era. (He is certainly the most high-profile remixer to do so.) His contemporaries included Arthur Baker and François Kevorkian.

Contemporaneously to disco in the mid-1970s, the dub and disco remix cultures met through Jamaican immigrants to the Bronx, energizing both and helping to create hip-hop music. Key figures included, DJ Kool Herc and Grandmaster Flash. Cutting (alternating between duplicate copies of the same record) and scratching (manually moving the vinyl record beneath the turntable needle) became part of the culture, creating what &quot;Slate&quot; magazine called &quot;real-time, live-action collage.&quot; One of the first mainstream successes of this style of remix was the 1983 track &quot;Rockit&quot; by Herbie Hancock, as remixed by Grand Mixer D.ST. Malcolm McLaren and the creative team behind ZTT Records would feature the &quot;cut up&quot; style of hip hop on such records as &quot;Duck Rock&quot;. English duo Coldcut&#x27;s remix of Eric B. &amp; Rakim&#x27;s &quot;Paid in Full&quot; Released in October 1987 is said to have &quot;laid the groundwork for hip hop&#x27;s entry into the UK mainstream&quot;. Dorian Lynskey of The Guardian named it a &quot;benchmark remix&quot; and placed it in his top ten list of remixes. The Coldcut remix &quot;Seven Minutes of Madness&quot; became one of the first commercially successful remixes, becoming a top fifteen hit in countries such as Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.

==History==

Early pop remixes were fairly simple; in the 1980s, &quot;extended mixes&quot; of songs were released to clubs and commercial outlets on vinyl 12-inch singles. These typically had a duration of six to seven minutes, and often consisted of the original song with 8 or 16 bars of instruments inserted, often after the second chorus; some were as simplistic as two copies of the song stitched end to end. As the cost and availability of new technologies allowed, many of the bands who were involved in their own production (such as Yellow Magic Orchestra, Depeche Mode, New Order, Erasure, and Duran Duran) experimented with more intricate versions of the extended mix. Madonna began her career writing music for dance clubs and used remixes extensively to propel her career; one of her early boyfriends was noted DJ John &quot;Jellybean&quot; Benitez, who created several mixes of her work.

Art of Noise took the remix styles to an extreme—creating music entirely of samples. They were among the first popular groups to truly harness the potential that had been unleashed by the synthesizer-based compositions of electronic musicians such as Kraftwerk, Yellow Magic Orchestra, Giorgio Moroder, and Jean-Michel Jarre. Contemporaneous to Art of Noise was the seminal body of work by Yello (composed, arranged and mixed by Boris Blank). Primarily because they featured sampled and synthesized sounds, Yello and Art of Noise would produce a great deal of influential work for the next phase. Others such as Cabaret Voltaire and the aforementioned Jarre (whose &quot;Zoolook&quot; was an epic usage of sampling and sequencing) were equally influential in this era.

After the rise of dance music in the late 1980s, a new form of remix was popularised, where the vocals would be kept and the instruments would be replaced, often with matching backing in the house music idiom. Jesse Saunders, known as The Originator of House Music, was the first producer to change the art of remixing by creating his own original music, entirely replacing the earlier track, then mixing back in the artist&#x27;s original lyrics to make his remix. He introduced this technique for the first time with the Club Nouveau song &quot;It&#x27;s a Cold, Cold World&quot;, in May 1988. Another clear example of this approach is Roberta Flack&#x27;s 1989 ballad &quot;Uh-Uh Ooh-Ooh Look Out (Here It Comes)&quot;, which Chicago House great Steve &quot;Silk&quot; Hurley dramatically reworked into a boisterous floor-filler by stripping away all the instrumental tracks and substituting a minimalist, sequenced &quot;track&quot; to underpin her vocal delivery, remixed for the UK release which reached No1 pop by Simon Harris. The art of the remix gradually evolved, and soon more avant-garde artists such as Aphex Twin were creating more experimental remixes of songs (relying on the groundwork of Cabaret Voltaire and the others), which varied radically from their original sound and were not guided by pragmatic considerations such as sales or &quot;danceability&quot;, but were created for &quot;art&#x27;s sake&quot;.

In the 1990s, with the rise of powerful home computers with audio capabilities came the mash-up, an unsolicited, unofficial (and often legally dubious) remix created by &quot;underground remixers&quot; who edit two or more recordings (often of wildly different songs) together. Girl Talk is perhaps the most famous of this movement, creating albums using sounds entirely from other music and cutting it into his own. Underground mixing is more difficult than the typical official remix because clean copies of separated tracks such as vocals or individual instruments are usually not available to the public. Some artists (such as Björk, Nine Inch Nails, and Public Enemy) embraced this trend and outspokenly sanctioned fan remixing of their work; there was once a web site which hosted hundreds of unofficial remixes of Björk&#x27;s songs, all made using only various officially sanctioned mixes. Other artists, such as Erasure, have included remix software in their officially released singles, enabling almost infinite permutations of remixes by users. The band has also presided over remix competitions for their releases, selecting their favourite fan-created remix to appear on later official releases.

Remixing has become prevalent in heavily synthesized electronic and experimental music circles. Many of the people who create cutting-edge music in such genres as synthpop and aggrotech are solo artists or pairs. They will often use remixers to help them with skills or equipment that they do not have. Artists such as Chicago-based Delobbo, Dallas-based LehtMoJoe, and Russian DJ Ram, who has worked with t.A.T.u., are sought out for their remixing skill and have impressive lists of contributions. It is not uncommon for industrial bands to release albums that have remixes as half of the songs. Indeed, there have been popular singles that have been expanded to an entire album of remixes by other well-known artists.

Some industrial groups allow, and often encourage, their fans to remix their music, notably Nine Inch Nails, whose website contains a list of downloadable songs that can be remixed using Apple&#x27;s GarageBand software. Some artists have started releasing their songs in the U-MYX format, which allows buyers to mix songs and share them on the U-MYX website.

==In popular music==
Recent technology allows for easier remixing, leading to a rise in its use in the music industry. It can be done legally, but there have been numerous disputes over rights to samples used in remixed songs. Many famous artists have been involved in remix disputes. In 2015, Jay-Z went to trial over a dispute about his use of a sample from &quot;Khosara Khosara&quot;, a composition by Egyptian composer Baligh Hamdy in his song &quot;Big Pimpin&#x27;&quot;. Osama Fahmy, a nephew of Hamdy, argued that while Jay-Z had the &quot;economic rights&quot; to use the song, he did not have the &quot;moral rights&quot;.

In 1988, Sinéad O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s art-rock song &quot;I Want Your (Hands on Me)&quot; was remixed to emphasize the urban appeal of the composition (the original contains a tight, grinding bassline and a rhythm guitar not entirely unlike Chic&#x27;s work). In 1989, the Cure&#x27;s &quot;Pictures of You&quot; was remixed turning &quot;the music on its head, twisted the beat completely, but at the same time left the essential heart of the song intact.&quot; 

Remixes have become the norm in contemporary dance music, giving one song the ability to appeal across many different musical genres or dance venues. Such remixes often include &quot;featured&quot; artists, adding new vocalists or musicians to the original mix. The remix is also widely used in hip hop and rap music. An R&amp;B remix usually has the same music as the original song but has added or altered verses that are rapped or sung by the featured artists. It usually contains some if not all of the original verses of the song however they may be arranged in a different order than they originally were.
In the early 1990s, Mariah Carey became one of the first mainstream artists who re-recorded vocals for a dancefloor version, and by 1993 most of her major dance and urban-targeted versions had been re-sung, e.g. &quot;Dreamlover&quot;. Some artists would contribute new or additional vocals for the different versions of their songs. These versions were not technically remixes, as entirely new productions of the material were undertaken (the songs were &quot;re-cut&quot;, usually from the ground up). Carey worked with producer Puff Daddy to create the official Bad Boy remix of &quot;Fantasy&quot;. The Bad Boy remix features background vocals by Puff Daddy and rapping by Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard, the latter being of concern to Columbia who feared the sudden change in style would affect sales negatively. Some of the song&#x27;s R&amp;B elements were removed for the remix, while the bassline and &quot;Genius of Love&quot; sample were emphasized and the bridge from the original version was used as the chorus. There is a version omitting Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard&#x27;s verses. The &quot;Bad Boy Fantasy Remix&quot;, combines the chorus from the original version and the chorus of the Bad Boy Remix together, removing Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard&#x27;s vocals from his second verse. Carey re-recorded vocals for club remixes of the song by David Morales, titled &quot;Daydream Interlude (Fantasy Sweet Dub Mix)&quot;.

The Bad Boy remix garnered positive reviews from music critics. &quot;Fantasy&quot; exemplified how a music sample could be transformed &quot;into a fully realized pop masterpiece&quot;. The song and its remix arguably remains as one of Carey&#x27;s most important singles to date. Due to the song&#x27;s commercial success, Carey helped popularize rapper as a featured act through her post-1995 songs. Sasha Frere-Jones, editor of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; commented in referencing to the song&#x27;s remix: &quot;It became standard for R&amp;B/hip-hop stars like Missy Elliott and Beyoncé, to combine melodies with rapped verses. And young white pop stars—including Britney Spears, &#x27;N Sync, and Christina Aguilera—have spent much of the past ten years making pop music that is unmistakably R&amp;B.&quot; Moreover, Jones concludes that &quot;Her idea of pairing a female songbird with the leading male MCs of hip-hop changed R&amp;B and, eventually, all of pop. Although now anyone is free to use this idea, the success of &quot;Mimi&quot; [ref. to &quot;The Emancipation of Mimi&quot;, her tenth studio album released almost a decade after &quot;Fantasy&quot;] suggests that it still belongs to Carey.&quot; John Norris of MTV News has stated that the remix was &quot;responsible for, I would argue, an entire wave of music that we&#x27;ve seen since and that is the R&amp;B-hip-hop collaboration. You could argue that the &#x27;Fantasy&#x27; remix was the single most important recording that she&#x27;s ever made.&quot; Norris echoed the sentiments of TLC&#x27;s Lisa Lopes, who told MTV that it&#x27;s because of Mariah that we have &quot;hip-pop.&quot; Judnick Mayard, writer of &quot;TheFader&quot;, wrote that in regarding of R&amp;B and hip hop collaboration, &quot;The champion of this movement is Mariah Carey.&quot; Mayard also expressed that &quot;To this day ODB and Mariah may still be the best and most random hip hop collaboration of all time&quot;, citing that due to the record &quot;Fantasy&quot;, &quot;R&amp;B and Hip Hop were the best of step siblings.&quot; In the 1998 film &quot;Rush Hour&quot;, Soo Yong is singing the song while it plays on the car radio, shortly before her kidnapping. In 2011, the experimental metal band Iwrestledabearonce used the song at the beginning and end of the video &quot;You Know That Ain&#x27;t Them Dogs&#x27; Real Voices&quot;.
Indie artist Grimes has called &quot;Fantasy&quot; one of her favorite songs of all-time and has said Mariah is the reason there is a Grimes.

M.C. Lyte was asked to provide a &quot;guest rap&quot;, and a new tradition was born in pop music. George Michael would feature three artistically differentiated arrangements of &quot;I Want Your Sex&quot; in 1987, highlighting the potential of &quot;serial productions&quot; of a piece to find markets and expand the tastes of listeners. In 1995, after doing &quot;California Love&quot;, which proved to be his best selling single ever, Tupac Shakur would do its remix with Dr. Dre again featured, who originally wanted it for his next album, but relented to let it be on the album &quot;All Eyez on Me&quot; instead. This also included the reappearance of Roger Troutman, also from the original, but he ended the remix with an ad-lib on the outro. Mariah Carey&#x27;s song &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; was remixed, containing lyrical interpolations and an instrumental sample from &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Fun (If the Homies Can&#x27;t Have None)&quot; by Snoop Dogg. A separate music video was filmed for the remix, shot in black and white and featuring a cameo appearance by Snoop. In 2001, Jessica Simpson released an urban remix of her song &quot;Irresistible&quot;, featuring rappers Lil&#x27; Bow Wow and Jermaine Dupri, who also produced the track. It samples the Kool &amp; the Gang&#x27;s song &quot;Jungle Boogie&quot; (1973) and &quot;Why You Treat Me So Bad&quot; by Club Nouveau (1987).
Released on July 12, 1999, &quot;Always You&quot; remix by Jennifer Paige, reached number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance/Club Play chart.

The main single of &quot;I Turn to You&quot; by Melanie C was released as the &quot;Hex Hector Radio Mix&quot;, for which Hex Hector won the 2001 Grammy as Remixer of the Year.

Another well-known example is R. Kelly, who recorded two different versions of &quot;Ignition&quot; for his 2003 album &quot;Chocolate Factory&quot;. The song is unique in that it segues from the end of the original to the beginning of the remixed version (accompanied by the line &quot;Now usually I don&#x27;t do this, but uh, go ahead on, break em&#x27; off with a little preview of the remix.&quot;). In addition, the original version&#x27;s beginning line &quot;You remind me of something/I just can&#x27;t think of what it is&quot; is actually sampled from an older Kelly song, &quot;You Remind Me of Something&quot;. Kelly later revealed that he actually wrote &quot;Ignition (remix)&quot; before the purported original version of &quot;Ignition&quot;, and created the purported original so that the chorus lyric in his alleged remix would make sense. Madonna&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Breathless&quot; featured a remix of &quot;Now I&#x27;m Following You&quot; that was used to segue from the original to &quot;Vogue&quot; so that the latter could be added to the set without jarring the listener.

In 2015, EDM artist Deadmau5, who worked with Jay-Z&#x27;s Roc Nation, tried to sue his former manager for remixing his songs without permission, claiming that he gave his manager the go-ahead to use his work for some remixes, but not others. Deadmau5 wanted reimbursement for the remixes his manager made after they had severed ties, because he claimed it was his &quot;moral right&quot; to turn these future remixing opportunities away if he had wanted to. The two parties reached an agreement in 2016 that kept Play Records from making any new remixes. 
50 Cent tried to sue rapper Rick Ross in October 2018 for remixing his &quot;In da Club&quot; beat, due to their publicized feud. However, a judge threw out the lawsuit claiming that 50 Cent did not have copyright on the beat, but rather it belonged to Shady/Aftermath Records.

Many hip-hop remixes arose either from the need for a pop/R&amp;B singer to add more of an urban, rap edge to one of their slower songs, or from a rapper&#x27;s desire to gain more pop appeal by collaborating with an R&amp;B singer. Remixes can boost popularity of the original versions of songs.

Thanks to a combination of guest raps, re-sung or altered lyrics and alternative backing tracks, some hip-hop remixes can end up being almost entirely different songs from the originals. An example is the remix of &quot;Ain&#x27;t It Funny&quot; by Jennifer Lopez, which has little in common with the original recording apart from the title.

Slow ballads and R&amp;B songs can be remixed by techno producers and DJs in order to give the song appeal to the club scene and to urban radio. Conversely, a more uptempo number can be mellowed to give it &quot;quiet storm&quot; appeal. Frankie Knuckles saddled both markets with his Def Classic Mixes, often slowing the tempo slightly as he removed ornamental elements to soften the &quot;attack&quot; of a dancefloor filler. These remixes proved hugely influential, notably Lisa Stansfield&#x27;s classic single &quot;Change&quot; would be aired by urban radio in the Knuckles version, which had been provided as an alternative to the original mix by Ian Devaney and Andy Morris, the record&#x27;s producers.
In the age of social media, anybody can make and upload a remix. The most popular apps for doing this are Instagram and YouTube.

==Broader context==

A remix may also refer to a non-linear re-interpretation of a given work or media other than audio such as a hybridizing process combining fragments of various works. The process of combining and re-contextualizing will often produce unique results independent of the intentions and vision of the original designer/artist. Thus the concept of a remix can be applied to visual or video arts, and even things farther afield. Mark Z. Danielewski&#x27;s disjointed novel &quot;House of Leaves&quot; has been compared by some to the remix concept.

==In literature==

A remix in literature is an alternative version of a text. William Burroughs used the cut-up technique developed by Brion Gysin to remix language in the 1960s. Various textual sources (including his own) would be cut literally into pieces with scissors, rearranged on a page, and pasted to form new sentences, new ideas, new stories, and new ways of thinking about words.

&quot;The Soft Machine&quot; (1961) is a famous example of an early novel by Burroughs based on the cut-up technique. Remixing of literature and language is also apparent in &quot;Pixel Juice&quot; (2000) by Jeff Noon who later explained using different methods for this process with &quot;Cobralingus&quot; (2001).

==In art==

A remix in art often takes multiple perspectives upon the same theme. An artist takes an original work of art and adds their own take on the piece creating something completely different while still leaving traces of the original work. It is essentially a reworked abstraction of the original work while still holding remnants of the original piece while still letting the true meanings of the original piece shine through. Famous examples include &quot;The Marilyn Diptych&quot; by Andy Warhol (modifies colors and styles of one image), and &quot;The Weeping Woman&quot; by Pablo Picasso, (merges various angles of perspective into one view). Some of Picasso&#x27;s other famous paintings also incorporate parts of his life, such as his love affairs, into his paintings. For example, his painting &quot;Les Trois Danseuses&quot;, or &quot;The Three Dancers&quot;, is about a love triangle.

Other types of remixes in art are parodies. A parody in contemporary usage, is a work created to mock, comment on, or make fun at an original work, its subject, author, style, or some other target, by means of humorous, satiric or ironic imitation. They can be found all throughout art and culture from literature to animation. Famous song parody artists include &quot;&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic&quot; and &quot;Allan Sherman&quot;. Several current television shows are filled with parodies, such as South Park, Family Guy, and The Simpsons.

The internet has allowed for art to be remixed quite easily, as evidenced by sites like memgenerator.net (provides pictorial template upon which any words may be written by various anonymous users), and Dan Walsh&#x27;s Garfieldminusgarfield.net(removes the main character from various original strips by Garfield creator Jim Davis).

&quot;A feminist remix is a creative resistance and cultural production that talks back to patriarchy by reworking patriarchal hierarchical systems privileging men.
Examples include Barbara Kruger&#x27;s &quot;You are not yourself&quot; (1982), &quot;We are not what we seem&quot; (1988), and &quot;Your body is a battleground&quot; (1989)
Barbara Kruger, Orlan&#x27;s (1994) &quot;Self-Hybridizations&quot; Orlan, Evelin Stermitz&#x27;s remix, &quot;Women at War&quot; (2010), and &quot;Distaff&quot; [Ain&#x27;t I Redux] (2008) by artist Sian Amoy.

==In media and consumer products==

In recent years the concept of the remix has been applied analogously to other media and products. In 2001, the British Channel 4 television program &quot;Jaaaaam&quot; was produced as a remix of the sketches from the comedy show &quot;Jam&quot;. In 2003 The Coca-Cola Company released a new version of their soft drink Sprite with tropical flavors under the name Sprite Remix.

In 1995, Sega released &quot;Virtua Fighter Remix&quot; (バーチャファイター　リミックス/Bāchafaitā rimikkusu) as an update to, just months after the &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; release on the Sega Saturn.

&quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; had been released on the Saturn in a less-than-impressive state. Sega had attempted to make an accurate port of the Sega Model 1 arcade version, and therefore chose to use untextured models and the soundtrack from the arcade machine. However, as the Saturn was incapable of rendering as many polygons on screen as Model 1 hardware, characters looked noticeably worse. Many claim it to be even worse than the Sega 32X version, thanks to the added CD loading time.

&quot;Virtua Fighter Remix&quot; was created to address many of these flaws. Models have a slightly higher polygon count (though still less than the Model 1 version); they are also texture-mapped, leading to a much more modern-looking game that could effectively compete with the PlayStation. The game also allows players to use the original flat-shaded models.

In the west, a CG Portrait Collection Disc was also included in the Saturn bundle. North American owners would get &quot;Virtua Fighter Remix&quot; for free if they registered their Saturns, while Japanese customers would later receive a SegaNet compatible version. Sega would also bring Virtua Fighter Remix to Sega Titan Video arcade hardware.

==Copyright implications==

Because remixes may borrow heavily from an existing piece of music (possibly more than one), the issue of intellectual property becomes a concern. The most important question is whether a remixer is free to redistribute his or her work, or whether the remix falls under the category of a derivative work according to, for example, United States copyright law. Of note are open questions concerning the legality of visual works, like the art form of collage, which can be plagued with licensing issues.

There are two obvious extremes with regard to derivative works. If the song is substantively dissimilar in form (for example, it might only borrow a motif which is modified, and be completely different in all other respects), then it may not necessarily be a derivative work (depending on how heavily modified the melody and chord progressions were). On the other hand, if the remixer only changes a few things (for example, the instrument and tempo), then it is clearly a derivative work and subject to the copyrights of the original work&#x27;s copyright holder.

The Creative Commons is a non-profit organization that allows the sharing and use of creativity and knowledge through free legal tools and explicitly aims for enabling a Remix culture. They created a website that allows artists to share their work with other users, giving them the ability to share, use, or build upon their work, under the Creative Commons license. The artist can limit the copyright to specific users for specific purposes, while protecting the users and the artist.

The exclusive rights of the copyright owner over acts such as reproduction/copying, communication, adaptation and performance – unless licensed openly – by their very nature reduce the ability to negotiate copyright material without permission.
Remixes will inevitably encounter legal problems when the whole or a substantial part of the original material has been reproduced, copied, communicated, adapted or performed – unless a permission has been given in advance through a voluntary open content license like a Creative Commons license, there is fair dealing involved (the scope of which is extraordinarily narrow), a statutory license exists, or permission has been sought and obtained from the copyright owner. Generally, the courts consider what will amount to a substantial part by reference to its quality, as opposed to quantity and the importance the part taken bears in relation to the work as whole.

There are proposed theories of reform regarding the copyright law and remixes. Nicolas Suzor believes that copyright law should be reformed in such a manner as to allow certain reuses of copyright material without the permission of the copyright owner where those derivatives are highly transformative and do not impact upon the primary market of the copyright owner. There certainly appears to be a strong argument that non commercial derivatives, which do not compete with the market for the original material, should be afforded some defense to copyright actions.

Stanford Law professor Lawrence Lessig believes that for the first time in history creativity by default is subject to regulation because of two architectural features. First, cultural objects or products created digitally can be easily copied, and secondly, the default copyright law requires the permission of the owner. The result is that one needs the permission of the copyright owner to engage in mashups or acts of remixing. Lessig believes that the key to mashups and remix is &quot;education – not about framing or law – but rather what you can do with technology, and then the law will catch up&quot;. 
He believes that trade associations – like mashup guilds – that survey practices and publish reports to establish norm or reasonable behaviours in the context of the community would be useful in establishing fair use parameters. Lessig also 
believes that Creative Commons and other licences, such as the GNU General Public Licence are important mechanisms which mashup and remix artists can use to mitigate the impact of copyright law. Lessig laid out his ideas in a book called &quot;Remix&quot; which is itself free to remix under a CC BY-NC license.

The Fair Use agreement allows users to use copyrighted materials without asking the permission of the original creator (section 107 of the federal copyright law). Within this agreement, the copyrighted material that is borrowed must be used under specific government regulations. Material borrowed falls under fair use depending on the amount of original content used, the nature of the content, the purpose of the borrowed content, and the effect the borrowed content has on an audience. Unfortunately, there are no distinct lines between copyright infringement and abiding by fair use regulations while producing a remix. However, if the work that is distributed by the remixer is an entirely new and transformative work that is not for profit, copyright laws are not breached. The key word in such considerations is transformative, as the remix product must have been either sufficiently altered or clearly used for a sufficiently different purpose for it to be safe from copyright violation.

In 2012, Canada&#x27;s Copyright Modernization Act explicitly added a new exemption which allows non-commercial remixing.
In 2013, the US court ruling &quot;Lenz v. Universal Music Corp.&quot; acknowledged that amateur remixing might fall under fair use and copyright holders are requested to check and respect fair use before doing DMCA take down notices.

In June 2015, a WIPO article named &quot;Remix Culture and Amateur Creativity: A Copyright Dilemma&quot; acknowledged the &quot;age of remixing&quot; and the need for a copyright reform.

<text>Gruffudd Maredudd Bowen Rhys (; born 18 July 1970) is a Welsh musician, composer, producer, filmmaker and author. He performs solo and with several bands, including Super Furry Animals, which obtained mainstream success in the 1990s. He formed the electro-pop outfit Neon Neon with Boom Bip. Their album &quot;Stainless Style&quot; was nominated for the 2008 Nationwide Mercury Prize. He won the 2011 Welsh Music Prize for his album &quot;Hotel Shampoo&quot;, which was followed up by &quot;American Interior&quot; in 2014, accompanied by a film, a book and a mobile app. His most recent album, &quot;Sadness Sets Me Free&quot;, was released in 2024. He is considered a figurehead of the era known as Cool Cymru.

== Early life ==
Rhys was born 18 July 1970 in Haverfordwest, Wales. He has a brother and a sister; his father was Ioan Bowen Rees (13 January 1929 – 4 May 1999), a &quot;poet, essayist, polemicist, mountaineer, internationalist ... and a White Robe Druid of the Gorsedd of Bards&quot;. Bowen Rees &quot;campaigned all his life for Welsh rights, language and culture&quot; although he did not believe in the narrow view of nationalism, glorifying one country over another, rather that the &quot;battle for Wales is the battle for all small nations, all small communities, all individuals in the age of genocide&quot;. Rhys&#x27;s mother, Margaret Wynn Meredith, shared his father&#x27;s love of writing and was a poet.

Rhys was educated at Ysgol Dyffryn Ogwen, Bethesda, Gwynedd, North Wales and was awarded a degree in art at Manchester Metropolitan University.

==Musical career==

===Ffa Coffi Pawb===

As a teenager in 1985, Gruff Rhys played drums for the North Wales band, Machlud, appearing at the Pesda Roc festival in Bethesda. After playing drums for the band Emily, Rhys found fame in Wales as the front man of Ffa Coffi Pawb. Translated, the name means &#x27;everyone&#x27;s coffee beans&#x27;, though if said quickly in Welsh, it can sound like &#x27;fuck off everyone&#x27; in English and Welsh combined.

On signing to Ankstmusik, Ffa Coffi Pawb became one of the leading bands on the Welsh music scene during the Cool Cymru movement, and released three albums – &quot;Clymhalio&quot;, &quot;Dalec Peilon&quot; and &quot;Hei Vidal!&quot;.

Rhys plays the guitar in an unusual style. Although he is right-handed, he learned to play left-handed on his brother&#x27;s left-handed guitar. Once his brother left home, Rhys only had access to a right-handed guitar. As he had already learned to play left-handed, and rather than invert the nut and re-string it, he taught himself to play the right-handed guitar upside down so the bass strings are on the bottom. Today, Rhys still plays left-handed on an upside down right-handed guitar.

===Super Furry Animals===

When Ffa Coffi Pawb disbanded in 1993, Rhys and drummer Dafydd Ieuan, of Rhoscefnhir, Anglesey, who had played for Catatonia, Anhrefn, Hanner Pei and many other Welsh language bands, formed the basis of Super Furry Animals. They soon settled on a line-up consisting of Rhys on vocals and guitar, Ieuan on drums, his brother Cian Ciaran (formerly of WWZZ) on keyboards, Huw Bunford (formerly of U-Thant) on guitar and Guto Pryce on bass. This line-up has remained constant to the present day, although the role of each member has become more flexible, particularly in the studio.

In 1995, following a couple of largely Welsh-language EPs on the Ankst label, they signed to Creation Records. Apparently, when offering them the deal after a gig, Alan McGee, head of Creation, asked that they sing more songs in English. Rhys pointed out that all the songs that night had been in English. Super Furry Animals went on to release their critically acclaimed first album, &quot;Fuzzy Logic&quot;, in 1996 – the first time Rhys had recorded in English. He later observed that his singing sounded like a random collection of accents – but it was nevertheless very successful.

Follow-up albums included &quot;Radiator&quot; in 1997, &quot;Guerrilla&quot; in 1999 and &quot;Mwng&quot; in 2000. They also became particularly famous for their 40-foot inflatable bears and a blue tank with &#x27;SFA&#x27; written upon it which toured summer festivals playing techno music at high volume. Super Furry Animals made a further mark on history in July 2001, when they released their first album for the Sony label, &quot;Rings Around the World&quot;, on CD and DVD simultaneously. They repeated this for 2003&#x27;s &quot;Phantom Power&quot;. Unfortunately 2005&#x27;s &quot;Love Kraft&quot; performed poorly commercially and Super Furry Animals agreed to leave Sony. They are presently signed to Rough Trade and released &quot;Hey Venus!&quot; in 2007 in the UK. In 2009 they released their latest record to date, entitled &quot;Dark Days/Light Years&quot;.

===Solo===
On 24 January 2005, Rhys released his first solo album, &quot;Yr Atal Genhedlaeth&quot;, on the Placid Casual label. It was a loose, sketchy, all-Welsh-language album, with most of the instruments played by Rhys. A tour of Wales and several festival appearances followed. After Super Furry Animals signed to Rough Trade, the new label agreed to take on his solo works as well, and on 8 January 2007 they released &quot;Candylion&quot;, a batch of acoustic pop songs in English, Spanish and Welsh, which Rhys wrote whilst touring &quot;Love Kraft&quot; but which did not fit with the direction of the new Super Furry Animals album. A third solo album by Rhys, &quot;Hotel Shampoo&quot;, was released on 14 February 2011. On 4 March 2011, it was announced that Rhys would be playing at Glastonbury 2011.

In May 2014, Rhys released his new work, &quot;American Interior&quot; (&quot;I Grombil Cyfandir Pell&quot;), a combined project of an album, a film, a hardback book and an app for mobile devices. The film was co-directed by Dylan Goch, who also worked with Rhys on his previous film, &quot;Separado!&quot; (2010).

From December 2015 to January 2016, Rhys fronted a co-production with National Theatre Wales titled &quot;The Insatiable, Inflatable Candylion&quot;, featuring songs from &quot;Candylion&quot; and several new tracks. The music and lyrics were by Gruff Rhys and the play&#x27;s text, which included audience participation, by Tim Price. The musicians appearing with Rhys were Lisa Jên Brown (who also sang on the original album), Sweet Baboo, Emma Daman Thomas and Kliph Scurlock. The show also included actors Remy Beasley, Matthew Bulgo, Dyfan Dwyfor, Natasha Lewis and Dyfrig Morris.

On 21 April 2016, Rhys released a new song entitled &quot;I Love EU&quot;, a song praising the European Union ahead of the EU Referendum on 23 June 2016.

Rhys released his fifth album, entitled &quot;Babelsberg&quot;, on 8 June 2018. A further album, &quot;Pang!&quot;, was released on 13 September 2019, produced by South African DJ Muzi.

===Neon Neon===
In 2007 Rhys launched a new electro-pop collaborative project with Boom Bip under the collective moniker Neon Neon. Their album, titled &quot;Stainless Style&quot;, is a loose concept album based on the tumultuous life of DeLorean Motor Company founder John DeLorean, and was released on 18 March 2008 via Lex Records. The album includes a number of high-profile guest appearances from Fab Moretti of The Strokes, Har Mar Superstar, Yo Majesty, Spank Rock, Cate Le Bon and The Magic Numbers. The first single, &quot;Raquel&quot;, was released on 26 November 2007. The follow-up single &quot;I Lust U&quot;, featured fellow Welsh artist Cate Le Bon on vocals. The album was nominated for the 2008 Mercury Prize.

On 29 April 2013, Neon Neon released their second studio album, &quot;Praxis Makes Perfect&quot;, followed by a limited run of live performances featuring actors from National Theatre Wales. The album and live show are based on the life of Giangiacomo Feltrinelli.

===Collaborations with other artists===
Rhys has occasionally collaborated with other artists, providing vocals for the track &quot;Dial: Revenge&quot; on the Mogwai album &quot;Rock Action&quot; as well as guesting on the songs &quot;Fear of Guitars&quot; (from the album &quot;Machine Says Yes&quot; by FC Kahuna) and &quot;Do&#x27;s and Don&#x27;ts&quot; (by Boom Bip) as well as &quot;Just War&quot; from Danger Mouse and Sparklehorse&#x27;s album &quot;Dark Night of the Soul&quot;. He has also featured on the Myspace remix track &quot;I&#x27;m Not Lying&quot; by Goldie Lookin&#x27; Chain. He features on the track &quot;Cream Dream&quot; from the 2009 Simian Mobile Disco album &quot;Temporary Pleasure&quot;. He also eats carrots on the Misty&#x27;s Big Adventure album &quot;Television&#x27;s People&quot;, continuing the vegetable relay started by Brian Wilson on &quot;Smile&quot;. Miles Kane has also called for him to produce the next album by his band the Rascals. Rhys also collaborated with influential hip-hop group De La Soul on a Gorillaz track titled &quot;Superfast Jellyfish&quot;. The track is on the third Gorillaz studio album, &quot;Plastic Beach,&quot; and provided vocals on the song &quot;We Won&#x27;t be Broke Forever Baby&quot; on Akira the Don&#x27;s LP &quot;The Life Equation.&quot;

In 2010 he released an album with Brazilian artist Tony da Gatorra on Turnstile Music. The album featured both compositions by Tony da Gatorra, who is relatively unknown in his native Brazil, and Gruff Rhys.

On 17 December 2011, Rhys joined Manic Street Preachers on stage during the band&#x27;s 38 song &quot;A Night of National Treasures&quot; one-off live event at the O2 Arena in London to provide the lead vocals for the song &quot;Let Robeson Sing&quot;. Introducing Rhys to the stage, lead singer James Dean Bradfield explained that Rhys had been set to perform the song at the band&#x27;s 2001 performance in Havana, Cuba but circumstances had prevented this from happening.

===Documentaries===
In 2010, Dylan Goch&#x27;s film &quot;Separado!&quot; premiered. It is a documentary about Gruff Rhys&#x27;s trip to Patagonia to try to locate members of his family whose ancestors had emigrated in Victorian times.

In 2014, the pair co-directed a film about the Welsh explorer John Evans, &quot;American Interior&quot;. It was released in cinemas in the UK on 9 May 2014.

===Computer game music===
In 2011 Rhys composed the music for the successful iOS and Android game &quot;Whale Trail&quot; which has been an iTunes game of the week.

===Political music===
In 2016 Rhys composed and sang &quot;I Love EU&quot; to support the Remain campaign in the UK European Membership Referendum.

==Film scores==
In 2014, Rhys composed the film score for &quot;Set Fire to the Stars&quot; about Dylan Thomas and starring Celyn Jones and Elijah Wood. The jazz group he formed to record the music features drummer Chris Walmsley, double-bassist Jim Barr (Portishead), Gavin Fitzjohn on trumpet and pianist Osian Gwynedd (formerly of Big Leaves and Sybridion) on piano, with strings arranged by Gruff Ab Arwel (Y Niwl). Additional string music was recorded by the Elysian Quartet. In September 2015, Rhys won the 2015 BAFTA Cymru award for Original Music for the score.

==Opera==
Rhys wrote the libretto for the 2017 opera &quot;2117/Hedd Wyn&quot;, with music by the composer Stephen McNeff. The story is inspired by the life of the Welsh poet Hedd Wyn; set in the year 2117, it imagines a group of schoolchildren in a post-apocalyptic Trawsfynydd learning about the life and work of the poet. It was recorded by Ty Cerdd Records and released in 2022.

==Personal life==
He supports Bangor City F.C. of the League of Wales.

He formed ieie Productions with his partner Catryn Ramasut in 2006 to produce film and television projects.

In July 2015, Rhys received an Honorary Fellowship from Bangor University. Among those also receiving the honor that day was Rhys&#x27;s cousin, DJ and music promoter Huw Stephens. Their mutual grandfather was president of the Students Union at the university. Rhys is also the cousin of musician MC Mabon (Gruff Meredith).

<doc id="156549" wikidata="Q322503" url="?curid=156549" title="Audio mixing">
<text>Audio mixing is the process by which multiple sounds are combined into one or more audio channels. In the process, a source&#x27;s volume level, frequency content, dynamics, and panoramic position are manipulated or enhanced. This practical, aesthetic, or otherwise creative treatment is done in order to produce a finished version that is appealing to listeners.

Audio mixing is practiced for music, film, television and live sound. The process is generally carried out by a mixing engineer operating a mixing console or digital audio workstation.

== Recorded music ==

Before the introduction of multitrack recording, all the sounds and effects that were to be part of a recording were mixed together at one time during a live performance. If the sound blend was not satisfactory, or if one musician made a mistake, the selection had to be performed over until the desired balance and performance was obtained. However, with the introduction of multitrack recording, the production phase of a modern recording has radically changed into one that generally involves three stages: recording, overdubbing, and mixdown.
==Film and television==
During production dialogue recording of actors is done by a person variously known as location sound mixer, production sound or some similar designation. That person is a department head with a crew consisting of a boom operator and sometimes a cable person.

Audio mixing for film and television is a process during the post-production stage of a moving image program by which a multitude of recorded sounds are combined. In the editing process, the source&#x27;s signal level, frequency content, dynamics, and panoramic position are commonly manipulated and effects added. In video production, this is called sweetening.

The process takes place on a mixing stage, typically in a studio or purpose-built theater, once the picture elements are edited into a final version. Normally the engineers will mix four main audio elements called stems: speech (dialogue, ADR, voice-overs, etc.), ambience (or atmosphere), sound effects, and music. As multi machine synchronization became available, filmmakers were able to split elements into multiple reels. With the advent of digital workstations and growing complexity, track counts in excess of 100 became common.

=== Dialogue intelligibility ===
Since the 2010s, critics and members of the audience have reported that dialogue in films tends to be increasingly more difficult to understand than in older films, to the point where viewers need to rely on subtitles to understand what is being said. Ben Pearson of &quot;SlashFilm&quot; attributed this to a combination of factors, only some of which can be addressed through audio mixing:

* Unintelligibility as a stylistic choice by filmmakers, particularly by Christopher Nolan and those influenced by him
* Soft, under one&#x27;s breath delivery of lines by actors, a practice particularly popular among younger actors, as opposed to the theatrical clarity of delivery previously used
* Low priority of sound recording on set, with priority given to the visual aspects of production
* Increased technological possibilities, including in post-production, no longer compel filmmakers to obtain an optimal recording on set
* The film crew&#x27;s familiarity with the dialogue can lead them to overestimate its intelligibility
* Theaters play films at a lower than recommended volume to avoid excessive loudness complaints from the audience
* Different standards of compression and volume balance applied by the various streaming platforms
* Inadequate audio remixing for films played in a home theater setting or on mobile devices, where the audio playback capabilities of the various setups strongly differ from each other and from cinema settings
==Live sound==

Live sound mixing is the process of electrically blending together multiple sound sources at a live event using a mixing console. Sounds used include those from instruments, voices, and pre-recorded material. Individual sources may be equalised and routed to effect processors to ultimately be amplified and reproduced via loudspeakers. The live sound engineer balances the various audio sources in a way that best suits the needs of the event.

<text>Guto Dafydd Pryce (Welsh pronunciation: ; born 4 September 1972) is a Welsh musician best known as bass guitar player and songwriter in the band Super Furry Animals. With them he has recorded nine UK Albums Chart Top 25 studio albums, plus numerous singles, EPs, compilations and collaborations. Pryce also records and performs with several other musical acts including his band Gulp. He is part of the era of Welsh music prominence known as Cool Cymru.

==Biography==
He was born in Cardiff.

Pryce was in the Welsh-language band , with his brother Iwan Pryce, Huw Bunford (also later of Super Furry Animals), Owen Powell (later of Catatonia) and others in a changing line-up, from 1989 to 1993. He recorded with Catatonia on their first two EPs before Super Furry Animals formed in 1993.

Working with dub and reggae label Trojan Records, Pryce put together a compilation &quot;Furry Selection: Luxury Cuts Of Trojan Chosen by a Super Furry Animal&quot; in 2007.

In 2008 Pryce recorded &quot;The Golden Mile&quot; with The Peth, a group which features Welsh actor Rhys Ifans on vocals, Super Furry Animals bandmate Dafydd Ieuan, Meilyr Gwynedd, Osian Gwynedd, Mick Hilton, Dic Ben and Kris Jenkins.

In 2010 Pryce played bass for Spectrum on their US and European tours.

Under the band name The Stand, Pryce joined Welsh actor Jonny Owen, Owen Powell (formerly of Catatonia) and Ryan Richards of Funeral for a Friend to record a fundraising single &quot;I&#x27;ll Be There&quot; in 2010. Stuart Cable of Stereophonics was involved in the project prior to his death. Proceeds from sales went to a fund to erect a statue of the footballer Fred Keenor on the Cardiff City F.C. grounds. The song was adapted from the original written during the coal miner&#x27;s General Strike of 1926 and often sung by Cardiff City fans. Pryce had previously shown his support for the team when the Super Furry Animals signed on as sponsors in 1999, with the band&#x27;s name displayed on team jerseys.
In 2012, Pryce began performing with his partner, Scottish singer and keyboardist Lindsey Leven, under the name Gulp. The band includes Gid Goundrey on guitar, Gwion Llewelyn (formerly of Race Horses and currently of Yr Ods) on drums, with contributions from Gareth Bonello (The Gentle Good) on acoustic guitar and cello. Gulp has performed around the UK, Europe and United States and done several UK radio sessions, including for BBC Radio Wales and Sŵn Radio. Their track &quot;Game Love&quot; was included on the compilation &quot;Late Night Tales: Django Django&quot;, and they released a cover of Django Django&#x27;s &quot;Hand of Man&quot;. Gulp&#x27;s debut album &quot;Season Sun&quot; was released in July 2014 on Everloving Records in the US and on Sonic Cathedral in the UK.

Pryce was part of a rare 2012 concert appearance by English singer-songwriter Mark Fry, honouring Fry&#x27;s 1972 album &quot;Dreaming with Alice&quot;, along with Nick Franglen of Lemon Jelly, Nick Palmer of The A. Lords, Grasshopper of Mercury Rev and Martin Smith of Tunng.

In 2012, Pryce led music workshops for youth at the charity Grassroots Cardiff Ltd. At Focus Wales 2013, Pryce was a panelist for the Welsh Music Foundation.

Pryce and Leven currently live in Dundee, after years in Cardiff. Their son Elis was born in 2018.

<text>Huw &quot;Bunf&quot; Bunford (born Huw Cennydd Bunford; 15 September 1967 in Cardiff, Wales) is a musician best known as the guitarist in Super Furry Animals.

==Biography==
Bunford studied at Lanchester Polytechnic (now Coventry University) and worked as a teacher. His last teaching position was Head of Art at Ysgol Gyfun Rhydfelen near Pontypridd.

Bunford&#x27;s first band was the Welsh language school band Edrych am Jiwlia which was formed in Ysgol Gyfun Gymraeg Glantaf, Cardiff. From 1989 he played with Guto Pryce in the punk band U Thant, before they both joined Super Furry Animals.

In 2012 Bunford performed a mix of found sounds with artist Naomi Kashiwagi at the Whitworth Art Gallery of University of Manchester. In 2013 he released music with Richard Chester under the band name Pale Blue Dots. Several songs were aired on BBC Radio Wales and C2 in Wales, and were posted on the group&#x27;s SoundCloud page.

Bunford also later studied film scoring and soundtrack production and has contributed to several film productions.

In 2019 Bunford and three other members of Super Furry Animals formed a new group under the name Das Koolies, an alter ego SFA used around 2000 for an experimental electronic album that was never officially released. The only member of SFA not involved in Das Koolies is Gruff Rhys, who continues to work as a solo artist. Das Koolies released their debut album, &quot;DK.01&quot;, in October 2023.

<doc id="156554" wikidata="Q2850364" url="?curid=156554" title="Ankst">
<text>Ankst was a Welsh independent record label formed in 1988 at the University of Wales, Aberystwyth by Alun Llwyd, Gruffudd Jones and Emyr Glyn Williams. After a handful of low key cassette releases, the label relocated to Cardiff and became a more serious concern, providing a launch-pad for several popular Welsh artists, including Llwybr Llaethog, Super Furry Animals and Gorky&#x27;s Zygotic Mynci. The &quot;Rough Guide to Wales&quot; described Ankst as &quot;one of the most prolific, eclectic and innovative&quot; of the 1990s Welsh music labels.

Between 1988 and 1997, the label put out some 80 releases before splitting in 1997 into two separate companies. Ankst Management (run by Llwyd and Jones and responsible for Melys, Super Furry Animals, Gorky&#x27;s Zygotic Mynci, Los Campesinos!, The Longcut, and, for a time, Cerys Matthews) and Ankstmusik, the label, that Williams ran from his house in Pentraeth on Anglesey, converting the garage into an office and store-room. Ankst remained true to its low-budget not for profit ideals at a time when the ‘Arts’ in Wales fell to corporate control and public funding. In all, the label released over 170 records by a huge assortment of bands and performers, such as Tystion, Ectogram, Zabrinski, Rheinallt H Rowlands, MC Mabon and Wendykurk.

Ankst moved into film making in the 2000s, releasing the Bafta-winning &quot;Y Lleill&quot; in 2005.

Alun Llwyd also co-managed, with Kevin Tame, the Cardiff-based indie label Turnstile, home of Perfume Genius, Christopher Owens, Gruff Rhys, Cate Le Bon and others. He is now chief executive at PR/distribution label Pyst.

Emyr &#x27;Ankst&#x27; Williams died at his home in Pentraeth on 17 January 2023, whilst receiving treatment for cancer. He was 57.

<doc id="156558" wikidata="Q607122" url="?curid=156558" title="Baby Boy (film)">
<text>Baby Boy is a 2001 American coming-of-age hood drama film directed, written and produced by John Singleton, and starring Tyrese Gibson, Snoop Dogg, Ving Rhames, Omar Gooding, A.J. Johnson and Taraji P. Henson. The film follows Joseph &quot;Jody&quot; Summers (Gibson), a 20-year-old bike mechanic as he lives and learns in his everyday life in the hood of Los Angeles.

The film was originally written with rapper-actor Tupac Shakur in mind to play Jody; Shakur had previously worked with Singleton on &quot;Poetic Justice&quot;. However, following Shakur&#x27;s murder in 1996, Singleton decided to replace Shakur with R&amp;B artist Tyrese Gibson. Additionally, the role of Rodney was originally written for Ice Cube, who had worked with Singleton on &quot;Boyz n the Hood&quot; and &quot;Higher Learning&quot;. The film marked the feature acting debut of Gibson and provided Henson with her first prominent role.

Released in the United States on June 27, 2001, the film received predominantly positive reviews from critics and audiences, with many deeming it as Singleton&#x27;s best film since &quot;Boyz n the Hood&quot;. The film is also the final feature film written by Singleton as he did not write any of his later feature-length directorial projects before his death in April 2019.

==Plot==
Joseph &quot;Jody&quot; Summers waits for his girlfriend Yvette at an abortion clinic after compelling her to go. They then have a heated argument about his lack of commitment and selfishness; she asks him if he will ever come live with her and their son JoJo, but he deliberately avoids the subject and comes and goes as he pleases.

Meanwhile, Jody also continues having affairs with other women, including a young girl named Peanut, with whom he also has a daughter, Lil&#x27; Nut. Jody also nearly has sex with Pandora, Yvette&#x27;s colleague and co-worker, but manages to rebuff her advances. When Yvette discovers his cheating, their ensuing argument eventually turns physical, culminating in her kicking him out of her home.

Yvette&#x27;s gangster ex-boyfriend Rodney is released from San Quentin State Prison and returns to the neighborhood to move in with Yvette. However, Rodney does not care for JoJo and wants to impregnate Yvette himself, but when Rodney attempts to rape Yvette in front of her son, he stops himself out of guilt. Despite their previous issues, Yvette begins to realize she still loves Jody.

Jody’s mother Juanita finds marijuana in her garden and blames him, who then angrily blames her new boyfriend Melvin, an ex-convict. Melvin comes home, admits to Juanita that he planted it and apologizes. An upset Jody argues with his mother before getting into an argument with Melvin, which ends with Melvin punching him and breaking a table.

Frustrated, Jody leaves the house to see his friend Sweetpea. Soon after, Yvette kicks Rodney and his friends out of her apartment. Eventually, Yvette and Jody reconcile at Sweetpea&#x27;s house, and Yvette tells Jody about how Rodney tried to rape her in front of JoJo. Rodney then steals Yvette’s money and keys from her wallet and drives off in her car to go and find Jody, whom he unsuccessfully tries to kill in a drive-by shooting.

Later that night, Jody and Sweetpea confront Rodney, and as he attempts to escape, Jody shoots him in the back of his legs. Sweetpea urges Jody to kill Rodney, but he refuses, and so Sweetpea shoots and kills Rodney himself with four shots. Horrified by Rodney&#x27;s death, Jody prepares to commit suicide by shooting himself in the head, but Melvin stops him before taking the gun. After reflecting on Rodney&#x27;s death and how his absence endangered her and JoJo, Jody finally decides to move in with Yvette.

Jody then accepts that Juanita&#x27;s relationship with Melvin is stable, and that he needs to protect and care for his own family. Afterward, Jody and Yvette get married and look forward to the birth of their unborn child. Meanwhile, Sweetpea decides to get baptized and abandon his old life as a criminal.

== Reception ==

===Box office===
In its opening weekend, the film grossed $8,606,403 in 1,533 theaters in the United States, averaging $5,614 per theater, and ranking #5 at the box office. It grossed a total of $28,734,552 domestically and $647,097 elsewhere for a total of $29,381,649, above its $16 million production budget.

===Critical response===
&quot;Baby Boy&quot; received positive reviews from critics and has a rating of 71% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 93 reviews with an average score of 6.2/10. The consensus states: &quot;Preachy and repetitive in parts, &quot;Baby Boy&quot; still manages to exude authenticity, thanks to its competent cast.&quot; The film also has a score of 55 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 26 critics indicating &#x27;Mixed or average reviews&#x27;.

Roger Ebert gave the film 3½ stars out of 4, and stated in his review: &quot;&quot;Baby Boy&quot; is a bold criticism of young black men who carelessly father babies, live off their mothers and don&#x27;t even think of looking for work. It is also a criticism of the society that pushes them into that niche. There has never been a movie with this angle on the African-American experience&quot; and &quot;[it] doesn&#x27;t fall back on easy liberal finger-pointing. There are no white people in this movie, no simplistic blaming of others; the adults in Jody&#x27;s life blame him for his own troubles, and they should.&quot;

Kenneth Turan, film critic for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, praised the film for being &quot;...Compelling... heartfelt and personal...&quot; Jonathan Rosenbaum of &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; also liked the film, stating: &quot;Like John Singleton&#x27;s other features, this is far from flawless... But the characters are so full-bodied and the feelings so raw and complex that I&#x27;d call this the best thing he&#x27;s done to date...&quot;

The film ultimately received ten nominations at the Black Reel Awards of 2002, including Outstanding Film, and three nominations at 2002 NAACP Image Awards, including Outstanding Motion Picture. The film was also screened at the 2001 Locarno International Film Festival in competition for the Golden Leopard, and would receive a &#x27;Special Mention&#x27; from the jury for &quot;For its innovative concept and ensemble acting.&quot;

Director John Singleton was very proud of the movie: &quot;It was just soulful, I made a movie that I wanted to be as soulful as a Marvin Gaye record. That was my goal for better or worse. Not necessarily a perfect film, but just something that you watch, it’s memorable. That’s what I love about that movie.&quot;

==Soundtrack==

A soundtrack containing hip-hop and R&amp;B music was released by Universal Records on June 19, 2001. It peaked at #41 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, #12 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums and #5 on the Top Soundtracks, and spawned one charting single, &quot;Just a Baby Boy&quot;, performed by Snoop Dogg featuring Tyrese &amp; Mr. Tan, which made it to #90 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and #40 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles &amp; Tracks. The soundtrack contains interludes which are sound clips from the film. An album of the film&#x27;s score, by British composer David Arnold, was released by Varese Sarabande.

<text>&quot;The Passersby&quot; is the 69th episode of the American television anthology series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. It was written by series creator and showrunner Rod Serling.

==Opening narration==
As the episode starts, a group of Civil War soldiers are walking down a road as Rod Serling narrates:

After the first dialogue between the Sergeant and Lavinia Godwin, Rod Serling resumes:

==Plot==
At the end of the Civil War, a Confederate Army Sergeant walks down a road aided by a wooden crutch. He carries with him a dirty bed roll and a homemade guitar. The limping Sergeant comes across a ruined antebellum mansion which belongs to Lavinia Godwin, a Southern belle whose husband was killed in the war and whose bitterness toward the Union Army still survives.

The Sergeant receives permission from Lavinia to sit on a bench under a dead tree in her front yard. He plays his guitar, and Lavinia recognizes the tune as one that her husband used to sing. The two watch as soldiers belonging to both the Union and the Confederacy pass by the house and continue down the road. The Sergeant learns about Lavinia&#x27;s illness and her husband&#x27;s death.

As they reminisce, a Union Lieutenant on horseback stops by the home to ask for water. The Sergeant recognizes him as the man that saved his life in the war. Meanwhile, Lavinia retrieves an old shotgun and fires at the Lieutenant. The blast passes through him and he remarks that nothing matters anymore. The Sergeant then remembers that the man who saved his life was killed. He gives the Lieutenant a drink from the well and the soldier continues on his way.

The night passes and the Sergeant begins to understand that this is not a normal road and these are not ordinary wounded soldiers. He tells Lavinia that there is something at the end of the road he has to find. As the Sergeant turns to leave, Lavinia tries to persuade him to stay. They then hear a man&#x27;s voice singing the same song the Sergeant had played earlier on his guitar − it is Lavinia&#x27;s husband, Jud.

Jud reveals to Lavinia that everyone on the road is indeed dead, including her. The Sergeant, understanding Jud&#x27;s words, sighs and begins to walk down the road, but Lavinia refuses to believe. Jud tells her that there is nothing left for him in that house. Jud rejects her pleas and continues his journey, reassuring her that he will wait for her at the end of the road.

Lavinia is then comforted by a lone passerby, who turns out to be Abraham Lincoln, the last casualty of the Civil War. Lincoln quotes a line from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;, before Lavinia runs to join her husband:

==Closing narration==
==Cast==
* James Gregory as The Sergeant
* Joanne Linville as Lavinia Godwin
* Warren Kemmerling as Jud Godwin
* Rex Holman as Charlie Constable
* David Garcia as Union Lieutenant
* Austin Green as Abraham Lincoln
* Jamie Farr as Soldier (uncredited)

==Episode notes==
The traditional folk song &quot;Black Is the Color (Of My True Love&#x27;s Hair)&quot; is featured prominently throughout this episode.

Elements of the episode are re-made in an episode of the 2002 revival named, &quot;Homecoming&quot;. In the episode a dead soldier returns from Iraq to repair his relationship with his son.

The radio adaptation of this episode starred Morgan Brittany as Lavinia.

<doc id="156561" wikidata="Q2616091" url="?curid=156561" title="A Game of Pool (The Twilight Zone, 1959)">
<text>&quot;A Game of Pool&quot; is episode 70 of the American television anthology series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. It originally aired on October 13, 1961, on CBS. According to Rod Serling, it is &quot;the story of the best pool player living and the best pool player dead.&quot;

==Opening narration==
==Plot==
Pool shark Jesse Cardiff stays after hours practicing at Lister&#x27;s Pool Room in Chicago. He bitterly muses that he would be considered the greatest pool player of all time, if it were not for the memory of James Howard &quot;Fats&quot; Brown, who died sixteen years previously, overshadowing him.

Jesse says he would give anything to play one game against Fats, prompting Fats himself to wearily rise from a pool table in the afterlife. He appears in the pool room and offers to play against Jesse, with a wager attached. If Jesse wins, he will be acknowledged as the greatest pool player ever; if he loses, he forfeits his life. Jesse accepts these conditions and the two begin to play. 

As the game goes on, Jesse snaps that as he grew up he got tired of everyone looking down on him; when he was aged 15, he came to the Pool Hall and won his first game. The owner has since let him practice after working hours, although at the expense of not having a social life, forgoing going to the movies or dating. Throughout the game, Fats laments that Jesse has done nothing with his life but play pool, explaining that he himself lived a full life in addition to becoming a great player. Jesse ignores Fats, convinced that he is just trying to distract him.

With one ball left on the table and both men needing to sink it in order to win, Fats misses his shot on purpose, and he warns Jesse that he may get more than he bargained for if he wins the game. Jesse sinks the ball and revels in his victory, now secure in his status as the best pool player of all time. Fats thanks Jesse for beating him, leading Jesse to angrily call him a sore loser, before Fats disappears.

Long after his own death, Jesse is summoned from the afterlife to travel to Mason&#x27;s Pool Hall in Sandusky, Ohio, to play against a challenger. Known even in death as the greatest pool player ever, Jesse has no choice but to face an endless series of would-be successors until someone beats him and claims his title. Meanwhile Fats has gone fishing, relieved of his obligation.

==Closing narration==
==Remake with alternative ending==
George Clayton Johnson&#x27;s script originally featured an ending in which Jesse loses the game and yet finds himself still alive. Seeing this, Fats explains that he will die &quot;as all second-raters die: you&#x27;ll be buried and forgotten without me touching you. If you&#x27;d beaten me, you&#x27;d have lived forever.&quot; Fats disappears, while Jesse vows to keep practicing until he is good enough to face the champion again.

The episode was remade in the 1980s version of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. The remade version featured Esai Morales as Jesse Cardiff and Maury Chaykin as Fats Brown. This version used the original alternate ending that Johnson intended for the original 1961 version.

<doc id="156569" wikidata="Q681043" url="?curid=156569" title="Dursley">
<text>Dursley is a market town and civil parish in the Stroud District of Gloucestershire, England. It lies between the cities of Bristol and Gloucester. It is under the northeast flank of Stinchcombe Hill, and about southeast of the River Severn. The town is adjacent to the village of Cam. The population of Dursley was 7,463 at the 2021 Census.

==History==

Ancient historical sites in the vicinity give evidence of earlier occupation. Uley Bury is an Iron Age hill fort dating from around 300 BC. The area also has neolithic long barrows; one called &quot;Hetty Pegler&#x27;s Tump&quot; can be entered. Roman remains exist at Frocester, West Hill near Uley, Woodchester and Calcot Manor.

Dursley once had a castle, built by Roger de Berkeley in 1153.

Dursley gained borough status in 1471 and lost it in 1886. From 1837 to 1851, it was the administrative centre of Dursley Registration District which recorded vital records of people living in the parishes of North Nibley, Coaley, Slimbridge, Stinchcombe, Uley, Dursley, Cam, Nympsfield, Kingswood, Wotton-under-Edge and Owlpen. From 1886 until 1974 it was the administrative centre of Dursley Rural District (RDC). In 1974 the RDC became part of Stroud District.

The Grade I listed parish church of St. James the Great dates from the 13th century. The modern building is largely of 14th and 15th century construction and carries the Tudor coat of arms on the outside below the guttering, indicating that some of its construction was funded by the Tudor royals. The original church spire collapsed in January 1699 during a bell-ringing session, causing casualties. The current belltower, in an imposing Gothic survival style, was built by Thomas Sumsion of Colerne in 1708–09.

Dursley Town Hall, a structure complete with statue of Queen Anne and bell turret, dates from 1738, when the town&#x27;s markets attracted farmers and traders from miles around. It is now maintained by the Dursley Town Council.

In 1856, a short branch line railway opened, called the &quot;Dursley Donkey&quot; by locals, linking Dursley and Cam to the Bristol–Gloucester main line at Coaley Junction. The branch line was closed in 1968 and Coaley Junction station was also closed at about this time. However, in 1994, a new station called Cam and Dursley was opened on the main line, 330 yards north of the site of Coaley Junction.

In the 19th and 20th centuries, Dursley was a large-scale manufacturing town; engines built here by the Lister engine company founded in 1867 were used around the world. 

That company&#x27;s successor, Lister Petter, was based in the town until 2014, though much of the original factory site was acquired in 2000 by the South West Regional Development Agency and then in 2011 by Stroud District Council. It is now being developed as a large housing development with some industrial units. The Towers, a large gothic-style house, formerly part of the Lister Petter estate, still overlooks the town and has been converted into flats and a residential care home. The Lister Hall theatre is named after the company.
Other large factories based in the town included Mawdsley&#x27;s, an electrical equipment manufacturer; Bymack&#x27;s, an upholsterers; and the Bailey Newspaper Group, a newspaper printer, all of which have reduced or closed operations.

==Character and amenities==

The town sits on the edge of the Cotswolds escarpment where it drops off towards the Severn Vale and the River Severn. 

Dursley&#x27;s main watercourse is the River Ewelme which becomes the River Cam when it enters Cam. The town is surrounded by woodland and countryside, and the Cotswold Way long distance trail passes through Dursley town centre.

In March 2010, Sainsbury&#x27;s opened a newly built 20,000 sq ft supermarket within walking distance of the town centre. Other recent arrivals include Lidl (November 2009, in premises on Kingshill Road previously occupied by the Regal Cinema and then Somerfield) and Iceland (July 2010, replacing Somerfield in the town centre). The Co-op has operated a smaller store in Rosebery Road since 2002. The town centre also has a number of independent shops and cafes.

A range of markets are held at the Market Place in the centre of the town; a farmers&#x27; market is held there on the second Saturday of every month and a craft market on the fourth Saturday of each month. There is an active Transition group in Cam and Dursley (part of the global Transition town network) which looks after Dursley&#x27;s Secret Garden, among other projects.

Dursley has a number of licensed premises and the Old Spot pub is regularly voted Gloucestershire &#x27;Pub of the Year&#x27;. The pub was named as 2007 CAMRA National Pub of the year.

==Popular culture==
Author J. K. Rowling, born in nearby Yate, named the Dursley family in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; books after the town due to disliking the place. She has jokingly remarked, &quot;I don&#x27;t imagine I&#x27;m very popular in Dursley&quot;.

In &quot;Richard II&quot; there is reference to &quot;the wolds of Gloucestershire&quot;, and when Bolingbrook asks how far it is to Berkeley as &quot;these wild hills and rough uneven ways draw out for miles&quot;, the reply given is &quot;there stands the castle beyond that tuft of trees&quot;. Many people understand this as a conversation taking place on Stinchcombe Hill overlooking the Vale of Berkeley and its castle.

<text>USS &quot;George H. W. Bush&quot; (CVN-77) is the tenth and final supercarrier of the United States Navy. She is named for the 41st President of the United States and former Director of Central Intelligence George H. W. Bush, who was a naval aviator during World War II. The vessel&#x27;s callsign is &quot;Avenger&quot;, after the TBF Avenger aircraft flown by then-Lieutenant George H. W. Bush in World War II. Construction began in 2003 at Northrop Grumman, in Newport News, Virginia and was completed in 2009 at a cost of $6.2 billion. Her home port is Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia.

==Naming==
George H. W. Bush became one of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s youngest pilots when he received his Naval Aviator wings and naval commission on 9 June 1943, three days before turning 19. He flew torpedo bombers off on active duty from August 1943 to September 1945 during World War II. On 2 September 1944, during a mission over the Pacific, Japanese anti-aircraft fire hit his plane. The Navy submarine rescued him. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and three Air Medals for courageous service in the Pacific Theater.

USS &quot;George H. W. Bush&quot; is the second United States aircraft carrier to be named after a naval aviator ( was the first) and the second, following , to be named after a then living former president (&quot;Ronald Reagan&quot; was christened in 2001 while Reagan was still alive).

==Ship&#x27;s seal==
Each element of the seal is significant for its relevance to the ship&#x27;s namesake, naval aviation, naval service, and the nation. There are six prominent features of the seal, beginning with the 41 white stars, symbolizing the ship&#x27;s namesake (the 41st president). The rays of light that appear on the seal&#x27;s horizon represent Bush&#x27;s concept of a &quot;thousand points of light&quot;, wherein he urged Americans to find meaning and reward by serving a purpose higher than themselves. The graphic depiction of the aircraft carrier reflects the carrier, as both a symbol and instrument of American strength as a force for freedom. Above the carrier are the overhead profiles of a TBM Avenger torpedo bomber (representing Bush&#x27;s days as a Navy pilot), an F/A-18 Hornet strike fighter, and an F-35C Lightning II, superimposed one upon the other in reverse chronological order of the individual aircraft&#x27;s service entry date, and in diminishing scale so each outline is contained within that of the newer aircraft.

Fouled anchors and shields, centered on naval aviators wings, honor the ship&#x27;s namesake&#x27;s aviation history. Finally, the motto &quot;Freedom at Work&quot; is adapted from Bush&#x27;s inaugural speech, during which he said, &quot;We know what works: Freedom works. We know what’s right: Freedom is right.&quot;

==Description==
&quot;George H. W. Bush&quot; measures and displaces over 100,000 tons, making her one of the world&#x27;s largest warships (though she is slightly shorter than ). Her top speed exceeds 30 knots; powered with two nuclear reactors, she can operate for more than 20 years without refueling.

Several features differentiate CVN-77 from other ships in the &quot;Nimitz&quot; class.

===Hull===
New features include a bulbous bow design that provides more buoyancy to the forward end of the ship and improves hull efficiency, curved flight deck edges to reduce radar signature, a new underwater hull coating system, deck modernized coverings to reduce ship weight by 100 tons, low solar absorptive and anti-stain paint, a less cluttered hangar bay, and a new propeller design.

===Island===

&quot;George H. W. Bush&quot; is the second carrier to have a modernized island, which includes a new radar tower (enclosed to reduce radar signature), navigation system upgrades, communication systems enhancements, and armored windows. The island is smaller and has been repositioned further aft to improve flight deck access and reduce signature and electronic self-interference.

===Air operations===
New air operations design features include an updated aviation fuel storage and distribution system, semi-automated refueling and servicing with new deck locations to provide faster, more efficient aircraft pit stops, requiring fewer people, modernized aircraft launch, and recovery equipment, and redesigned jet blast deflectors.

===Environmental===
Environmental upgrades have also been designed into the ship, including a vacuum collection/marine sanitation device (VC/MSD), a new marine sewage system that uses sea water in lieu of fresh water for lower maintenance costs. Many older ships in the U.S. Navy utilize a gravity-driven collection holding and transfer (CHT) system to handle sewage waste. Newer U.S. Navy ships, including now CVN-77, collect sewage waste by vacuum, allowing for greater flexibility in piping installation, smaller pipe sizes overall and reducing water consumption. The collection tanks of &quot;George H. W. Bush&quot; were modified to accommodate both the VCHT (Vacuum CHT) equipment and the elements of a marine sanitization device to treat the waste prior to discharge. &quot;George H. W. Bush&quot; is the only aircraft carrier in the U.S. Navy to combine the two technologies.

This new VC/MSD driven waste management system has, however, not been without problems. Reports began surfacing immediately after delivery in May 2009 of issues with the ship&#x27;s toilet system. As of November 2011, the entire system has gone down at least twice, rendering all 423 commodes in the ship&#x27;s 130 heads inoperable, with many more incidents that have rendered either half of the ship, or sections of the ship, without operating sanitary facilities. In one ship-wide incident, a repair crew spent 35 non-stop hours attempting to return the system to working order. The system is said to suffer breakdowns when inappropriate materials such as feminine hygiene products are flushed down the toilets. During a four-month maintenance period in the dock in 2012, anti-clog measures were installed in the ship&#x27;s toilet disposal systems.

===Electronics and communications===
New electronics and communications technology, space rearrangement, operational procedure changes, advanced sensor technologies and maintenance systems have been incorporated to reduce manning costs. A new zonal electrical distribution system will keep problems from affecting other parts of the ship. Automated material movement devices, semi-autonomous, gravity compensated weapons handling devices, damage control automation systems and components have also been installed. Medical and dental equipment have been upgraded, integrated display screens in Damage Control Central have been modernized to improve data integration and display, and equipment in general shops has been modernized to improve productivity.

==History==
The contract to build CVN-77 was awarded to Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding Newport News on 26 January 2001. A naming ceremony was held on 9 December 2002 at Northrop Grumman Newport News, with former president George H .W. Bush attending. Secretary of the Navy Gordon R. England, presided at the ceremony.

===Construction===
Construction took place at the Northrop Grumman Newport News shipyard&#x27;s Dry Dock 12, the largest in the western hemisphere. The keel laying ceremony was held on 6 September 2003, with former president George H. W. Bush serving as the keynote speaker. Former First Lady Barbara Bush also attended with their daughter, Dorothy Bush Koch, the ship&#x27;s sponsor. The former president authenticated the keel by chalking his initials onto a metal plate. His initials were then welded onto the plate, which was permanently affixed to the ship.

The ship was modularly constructed, where large sections are assembled and then lifted into place using a large crane. Major milestones in the construction include the bow placement in March 2005, followed by the island placement on 8 July 2006. The island was lifted onto the flight deck in a ceremony called &quot;stepping the mast&quot; which dates from antiquity and consists of placing coins or other items of significance under the step or bottom of a ship&#x27;s mast during construction. Since at least the construction of in the 1790s, this tradition has been passed on as a symbol of good luck for U.S. Navy ships. George H. W. Bush participated in the event, placing his naval aviator wings underneath the island during the ceremony.

&quot;George H. W. Bush&quot; was christened on 7 October 2006. Former president George H. W. Bush attended the ceremony and became the first president in history to participate in the christening of his namesake ship. President George W. Bush also attended and honored his father during the ceremony as a special guest speaker. Other officials participating in the ceremony included Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, Secretary of the Navy Donald Winter; Virginia Senators John Warner and George Allen, Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine, and Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Michael Mullen.

Other construction milestones included catapult system testing on the ship&#x27;s flight deck on 25 January 2008. Former president George H. W. Bush signaled the launch of two &quot;dead loads&quot; off the deck of the carrier. Dead loads are large, wheeled, steel vessels weighing up to simulating the weight of actual aircraft.

On 11 August 2008, the Pre-Commissioning Unit (PCU) crew moved aboard the ship, the first meals were served in the galley, the U.S. flag was raised on the fantail for the first time, and the first watches were set. &quot;George H. W. Bush&quot; left Northrop Grumman Ship Building for the first time on 23 December 2008, proceeding a few miles down river to Norfolk Naval Station.

===Commissioning===

&quot;George H. W. Bush&quot; was commissioned 10 January 2009 at Norfolk Naval Station prior to her official delivery to the Navy, in a ceremony attended by approximately 15,000 people. Veterans of , the ship George H. W. Bush served on during World War II, were also present. President George W. Bush delivered the principal address, George H. W. Bush set the first watch, and ship&#x27;s sponsor Dorothy &quot;Doro&quot; Bush Koch gave the order to &quot;man our ship and bring her to life!&quot; A GM-built Grumman TBM Avenger like the one then-Lieutenant junior grade George Bush flew in World War II performed a fly-over.

Northrop Grumman Corporation Builder&#x27;s sea trials were completed on 16 February 2009, providing an opportunity to test systems, components and compartments at sea for the first time. The trials included high-speed runs and a demonstration of the carrier&#x27;s other capabilities. Following builder&#x27;s trials, the ship underwent acceptance trials on 10 April 2009, conducted by representatives of the U.S. Navy Board of Inspection and Survey, to test and evaluate the ship&#x27;s systems and performance.

===Delivery and shakedown===
&quot;George H. W. Bush&quot; was officially delivered to the Navy on 11 May 2009.

The first fixed-wing flights were conducted on 19 May 2009 when F/A-18 Super Hornets from Air Test and Evaluation Squadron at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland began flight deck certification, which tests a carrier&#x27;s ability to conduct air operations.

On 26 May 2009, former president George H. W. Bush and his daughter, Dorothy Bush Koch, flew aboard the carrier to observe flight operations during the ship&#x27;s underway period in the Atlantic Ocean. USS &quot;George H. W. Bush&quot; successfully completed her first flight deck certification on that day.

&quot;George H. W. Bush&quot; returned to Northrop Grumman Newport News shipyard on 18 June 2009 for post-delivery maintenance work, also known as the ship&#x27;s post shakedown availability (PSA). A PSA is a typical availability in the early life of a carrier that allows the Navy and builder to resolve any items that came up during trials and delivery and make any last-minute changes and upgrades. Work includes the installation of a Rigid Hull Inflatable Boat (RHIB) handling system and a new fresh water purification system. Other changes include compartment reconfigurations, combat system and radar equipment upgrades, and minor repairs. The work was scheduled to last through early 2010.

===Maiden 2011 deployment===

The ship was assigned to Carrier Strike Group Two for her first deployment. Under the command of Rear Admiral Nora Tyson, &quot;George H. W. Bush&quot;, Carrier Air Wing Eight and the four ships of her group departed on her first deployment on 11 May 2011. They sailed across the Atlantic to Britain to participate in Exercise Saxon Warrior, held in the Western Approaches and culminating in a so-called &#x27;Thursday War&#x27;. She then moved towards Portsmouth, United Kingdom, on 27 May, anchoring adjacent to Stokes Bay through 31 May, because she was too large to enter the harbor, and the naval base did not have sufficient nuclear berths for the carrier to moor alongside. The carrier arrived at Naples, Italy on 10 June 2011.

The carrier returned to Norfolk on 10 December 2011, following a seven-month deployment supporting operations with the U.S. Navy&#x27;s 5th and 6th fleets.

===2012===

On 25 July 2012, &quot;George H. W. Bush&quot; began her four-month overhaul at Norfolk Naval Shipyard at Portsmouth, Virginia, included scheduled short-term technical upgrades. On 1 December 2012, &quot;George H. W. Bush&quot; completed her PIA maintenance cycle and began sea trials on 3 December 2012. After completing sea trials on 4 December 2012, the carrier started her training and qualification cycle in preparation for the group&#x27;s 2013 deployment.

===2013===
During a two-week underway period beginning 14 January 2013, &quot;George H. W. Bush&quot; tested the MV-22 tilt-rotor aircraft from squadron VMX-22 as a potential carrier onboard delivery aircraft as well as operating mine-sweeping MH-53E helicopters from squadron HM-14.

During another underway period, &quot;George H. W. Bush&quot; conducted at-sea tests for X-47B unmanned drone in the Atlantic Ocean, including the first time that an unmanned drone has been catapulted off an aircraft carrier on the morning of 14 May 2013 (&quot;pictured&quot;). On 17 May 2013, another first was achieved when the X-47B performed touch-and-go landings and take-offs on the flight deck of &quot;Bush&quot; while underway in the Atlantic Ocean. Also during this two-week underway period, the aircraft carrier tested a new torpedo self-defense system, as well as completed more than 115 launches and landings in assessing a new precision landing system, before returning to Norfolk on 24 May 2013.

On 10 July 2013, an unmanned X-47B drone completed an arrested landing on the flight deck of &quot;George H. W. Bush&quot;. The landing marks the first time any unmanned aircraft had completed an arrested landing on board an aircraft carrier operating at sea. The drone completed a second successful arrested landing on &quot;George H. W. Bush&quot;, but it was diverted to the Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia after an issue was detected, requiring that a planned third landing to be aborted. One of the drone&#x27;s three navigational sub-systems failed, which was identified by the other two sub-systems. The anomaly was indicated to the mission operator, who followed test plan procedures to abort the landing. The Navy stated that the aircraft&#x27;s detection of a problem demonstrated its reliability and ability to operate autonomously. On 15 July 2013, in a fourth attempt, an X-47B drone failed to make a successful flight deck landing on board the vessel due to &quot;technical issues.&quot;

===2014 deployment===

In late February 2014, &quot;George H. W. Bush&quot; transited the Strait of Gibraltar on the way to a stop in Piraeus, Greece, for a scheduled port visit.

On 5 March 2014, &quot;George H. W. Bush&quot; arrived off southern Turkey, which is under 500 miles away from Crimea, amid developing tensions over Ukraine with Russia. On 9 March 2014, the carrier entered port in Antalya, in southern Turkey. Some news sources had speculated that the ship&#x27;s stay in the Mediterranean Sea would be extended as a result of the annexation of Crimea, but this proved to not be the case with Carrier Strike Group 2 proceeding through the Suez Canal.

The carrier was transiting the Suez Canal on 18 March 2014. On 23 March officially turned over the watch to &quot;George H. W. Bush&quot; in the U.S. 5th Fleet area of responsibility conducting maritime security operations and supporting theater security cooperation efforts.

On 14 June 2014, &quot;George H. W. Bush&quot; was ordered to the Persian Gulf to protect US interests in Iraq in light of the militant group Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant&#x27;s (ISIL) offensive and takeover of several major cities in that country.

On 8 August 2014, two F/A-18F Super Hornets launched from the ship and dropped laser-guided bombs on an ISIL mobile artillery cannon shelling Kurdish forces outside their capital city, Erbil. The mission was launched in accordance with President Obama&#x27;s announcement on the evening of 7 August that the US would begin airstrikes to protect US personnel and the Yazidis in the region from ISIL attacks.

On 23 September 2014 F/A-18 Hornets and Super Hornets from Carrier Air Wing Eight launched from &quot;George H. W. Bush&quot; in the Persian Gulf to strike at specific targets in Syria such as command-and-control centers, training camps, and weapons depots.

On 15 November 2014, &quot;George H. W. Bush&quot; returned to her homeport in Norfolk, Virginia after a nine-month deployment.

===2017 deployment===

Following a 14-month shipyard availability at Norfolk Naval Shipyard and a compressed training cycle, &quot;George H. W. Bush&quot; and Carrier Air Wing Eight departed Norfolk on 21 January for her third deployment. She transited the Strait of Gibraltar on 2 February and after a port visit to Souda Bay, Crete, she again participated in strikes against ISIL in support of Operation Inherent Resolve.

In July 2017, &quot;George H. W. Bush&quot; arrived in the UK to take part in Exercise &quot;Saxon Warrior&quot;, a joint exercise involving Carrier Strike Group 2 plus elements of the Royal Navy, German Navy, Royal Norwegian Navy and Swedish Navy. This included the staff of the Royal Navy&#x27;s Carrier Strike Group embarking &quot;Bush&quot; as part of their preparation for the entry into service of , the first of Britain&#x27;s new aircraft carriers.

===2018===
In May 2018, &quot;George H. W. Bush&quot; took part in the Franco-American exercise Chesapeake Mission, with twelve Dassault Aviation Rafale M and a Grumman E-2C Hawkeye from the French Navy embarked on board.

===2019===
In February 2019, &quot;George H. W. Bush&quot; arrived at Norfolk Naval Shipyard for a planned 28-month docking planned incremental availability (DPIA). This was the ship&#x27;s first DPIA.

The United States Navy announced on 24 September that there had been three suicides among the crew serving aboard &quot;George H. W. Bush&quot; in one week. Two previous ship suicides had taken place in November 2017 and July 2019.

=== 2020 ===
On , &quot;Navy Times&quot; reported that a spokesperson for Naval Air Force Atlantic confirmed that a &quot;small number&quot; of sailors assigned to &quot;George H. W. Bush&quot; had tested positive for COVID-19 during the summer. The spokesperson declined to provide an exact number of sailors or a more precise date regarding when the virus was detected, citing US Defense Department policy, but added that the carrier was not deployed at the time, and that those infected &quot;remain[ed] in isolation at their private residences in Virginia and receive[d] daily medical supportive care&quot;.

In August 2020, &quot;George H. W. Bush&quot; left dry dock at Norfolk Naval Shipyard, after 18 months of the planned two-year overhaul. It was the vessel&#x27;s most extensive maintenance period and marked the first time out of water since she was built. The overhaul was the most complex undertaken at the shipyard to date, according to the Navy.

=== 2022–2023 deployment ===
On 10 August 2022, &quot;George H. W. Bush&quot;, with Carrier Air Wing 7 (CVW-7) embarked, began a deployment as part of Carrier Strike Group 10 (CSG-10). This marks the carrier&#x27;s first deployment since her 2017 deployment, after which she underwent major maintenance. CSG-10 was reportedly set to relieve Carrier Strike Group 8 (CSG-8) and its flagship, , in the Mediterranean Sea. On 25 August 2022, &quot;George H. W. Bush&quot; and CSG-10 transited the Strait of Gibraltar and entered the Mediterranean Sea. &quot;George H. W. Bush&quot; returned to Norfolk on 23 April 2023.

<doc id="156575" wikidata="Q1646630" url="?curid=156575" title="Xunantunich">
<text>Xunantunich () is an Ancient Maya archaeological site in western Belize, about 70 miles (110 km) west of Belize City, in the Cayo District. Xunantunich is located atop a ridge above the Mopan River, well within sight of the Guatemala border – which is to the west. It served as a Maya civic ceremonial centre to the Belize Valley region in the Late and Terminal Classic periods (c.700-900AD). At that time, when the region was at its peak, nearly 200,000 people lived in the Belize Valley.

Xunantunich&#x27;s name means &quot;Maiden of the Rock&quot; in the Maya languages Mopan and Yucatec, combining &quot;Xunaan&quot; (noble lady) and &quot;Tuunich&quot; (stone for sculpture). The &quot;Stone Woman&quot; refers to the ghost of a woman claimed by several people to inhabit the site, beginning in 1892. She is said to be dressed completely in white with fire-red glowing eyes. She generally appears in front of &quot;El Castillo&quot;, ascends the stone stairs, and disappears into a stone wall.. Like many names given to Maya archaeological sites, &quot;Xunantunich&quot; is a modern name; the ancient name is unknown.

== History of Excavations ==
The first modern explorations of the site were conducted by Thomas Gann in the mid-1890s. Gann moved from Britain and served as the district surgeon and district commissioner of Cayo, British Honduras, starting in 1892. He chose this area to settle in due to his interest in Maya archaeology and the unknown wonders of the indigenous people that occupied the area. Gann&#x27;s successor, Sir J. Eric S. Thompson, implemented a more methodical approach, and was able to establish the region&#x27;s first ceramic chronology. 

In 1959–60, the Cambridge Expedition to British Honduras arrived in the colony, and its archaeologist member, Euan MacKie, who carried out several months of excavation at Xunantunich. He excavated the upper building on Structure A-11 in Group B and a newly discovered residential structure, A-15, just outside the main complex. Using the European method of detailed recording of the stratigraphy of the superficial deposits (the masonry structures themselves were not extensively cut into) he was able to infer that both buildings had been shattered by a sudden disaster which marked the end of the Classic period occupation. An earthquake was tentatively proposed as the cause; it is inferred purely on the basis of the excavated evidence, and also on the very damaged state of the top building of Structure A-6 (&#x27;El Castillo&#x27;). MacKie was also able to confirm the later part of the pottery sequence constructed by Thompson. The detailed report by MacKie is &quot;Excavations at Xunantunich and Pomona, Belize, in 1959–60&quot;. British Archaeological Reports (Int. series), 251, 1985: Oxford.

The main recent archaeological teams to work at Xunantunich and the surrounding region are the Xunantunich Archaeological Project (XAP), the Xunantunich Settlement Survey (XSS), and the Belize Valley Archaeological Reconnaissance Project (BVAR).

Farmers that fed the occupants of Xunantunich typically lived in small villages, divided into kin-based residential groups. The farms were spread out widely over the landscape, though the center of Xunantunich itself is rather small in comparison. These villages were economically self-sufficient, which may be the reason why Xunantunich lasted as long as they did; they were not dependent on the city to provide for them. Settlement density was relative to soil quality, proximity to rivers, and localized political histories. Since the farmers were long established on their plots of land, they would not want to be involved with a polity that was under constant upheaval due to invading forces and more. Other nearby Maya archaeological sites include Chaa Creek and Cahal Pech, Buenavista del Cayo, and Naranjo.

==Chronology==

There is evidence of Xunantunich being settled as early as the ceramic phase of the Preclassic period. The findings have been too insubstantial to prove that Xunantunich was a site of importance. It was not until the Samal phase in AD 600–670 that Xunantunich began to grow significantly in size. Architectural constructions boomed in Hats’ Chaak phase (AD 670–750) when Xunantunich&#x27;s connection with the polity Naranjo solidified. Left in a state of abandonment at approximately AD 750 due to an unknown violent event (see Euan MacKie&#x27;s work in 1959–60, above, which may be relevant here), Xunantunich did not re-establish itself as a strong presence in the region until the Tsak’ phase in AD 780–890.

==Monuments==

The core of the city Xunantunich occupies about one square mile (2.6 km2), consisting of a series of six plazas surrounded by more than 26 temples and palaces. As an entire polity, Xunantunich contains 140 mounds per square km, as discovered in the surveys done by the XSS. One of Xunantunich&#x27;s better known structures is the pyramid known as &quot;El Castillo&quot; (not to be confused with the El Castillo at Chichen Itza). 
The site is broken up into four sections – Group A, Group B, Group C, and Group D, with Group A being central and most significant to the people. Prior to the seventh century, the site was mainly occupied by small houses, forming the occasional village. With the architectural boom in the Samal phase, we see the extreme importance of cosmological and political placing of the monuments in relation to the axis mundi (the intersection cardinal axis of the site; the heart of the site).

===El Castillo===

It is the second tallest structure in Belize (after the temple at Caracol), at some 130 feet (40 m) tall. El Castillo is the “axis mundi” of the site, or the intersection of the two cardinal lines. Evidence of construction suggests the temple was built in two stages (the earlier dubbed Structure A-6–2nd, which dates to around 800 AD, and the later Structure A-6–1st). Structure A-6–2nd had three doorways, whereas Structure A-6–1st only had doors on the north and south. The pyramid lies underneath a series of terraces. The fine stucco or &quot;friezes&quot; are located on the final stage. The northern and southern friezes have eroded, and the others were covered during the reconstruction and over time. There is a plaster mold on the Eastern wall frieze. The frieze depicts many things. Each section of the frieze is broken up by framing bands of plaited cloth or twisted cords (which represent celestial phenomena). The frieze depicts the birth of a god associated with the royal family, gods of creation, as well as the tree of life (which extends from the underworld, the earth, and the heavens).

===Structure A-1===

Structure A-1 was built in the Late Classic, at around 800 AD. It bisected Plaza A-I, which had until then been the most important plaza in the site. It now lies on top of the original ball court of Xunantunich between Structure A-6 (El Castillo) and A-11. It became a ritual space solely for the rulers and elite, which doubled as an impediment to other public spaces.

=== Burial chamber ===
On July 19, 2016, a team led by Jaime Awe discovered an untouched burial chamber attached to a larger building. It is considered to be one of the largest Maya burial chambers found within the last 100 years. The chamber contained the corpse of a male, aged between 20 and 30 years. The chamber also contained a number of ceramic vessels, obsidian knives, jade pearls, animal bones and some other artefacts made of stone. Osteologists believe the man was athletic and quite muscular when he died.

==Relationships with other sites==

During a time period when most of Maya civilizations were crumbling, Xunantunich was managing to expand its city and its power over other areas within the valley. It lasted a century longer than most of the sites within the region. It is known that Xunantunich superseded Buenavista as the hub of sociopolitical administration for the upper valley, in addition to the main location for elite ancestral and funeral rites and ceremonies. One theory is the move was made due to political strife in the lowlands due to neighbors vying for control over Buenavista, and that Xunantunich was a much more easily defensible site (located on top of a hill).

There is evidence of trade and communication between other sites in abundance. First, there is the disbursement of pine. Pine naturally grows in the Mountain Pine Ridge, which is accessible via the Macal River. It was imported to Xunantunich, where the disbursement of this valuable commodity could be controlled by elites and rulers. This resource was used in ritualistic and building purposes for the upper class, and would sometimes be given to members of the lower class to strengthen socio-political strategies. Similarities between pottery among different sites is a trait commonly looked for by archaeologists. The difference between qualities of pottery can accentuate gaps between social classes within a location, just as it can show the difference between classes of other polities. In the Terminal Classic period, equality in the distribution of pottery at Xunantunich can be seen as political currency across the Belize Valley. Pottery types became uniform among sites found in the areas in Belize Valley around Xunantunich, further evidence of their strong relationships with the “Stone Woman” site.

===Naranjo===

Due to regional conflicts, Naranjo, a regional polity, began to disintegrate around the 9th century. It transformed from a regional authority to a smaller site, which eventually disappeared into the background. For reasons not yet understood, documentary hieroglyphs rapidly disappeared in AD 820 at Naranjo; which aligns with the earliest stela at Xunantunich, Stela 8. The stela, hieroglyphs and architecture are stylistically similar to Naranjo&#x27;s in style From here, there was a power shift to Xunantunich, although the influence of Naranjo prior to this is certain. The construction of the core site itself is extremely similar to the layout of Naranjo&#x27;s Group B layout. The pronounced north–south axis (believed to be a link to royal authority and continuity) is shared between the two, the buildings are placed in similar spots, and the shapes of the buildings resemble one another.

<doc id="156576" wikidata="Q626756" url="?curid=156576" title="Ebenezer Scrooge">
<text>Ebenezer Scrooge () is a fictional character and the protagonist of Charles Dickens&#x27;s 1843 novel, &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;. Initially a cold-hearted miser who despises Christmas, his redemption by visits from the ghost of Jacob Marley, the Ghost of Christmas Past, the Ghost of Christmas Present, and the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come has become a defining tale of the Christmas holiday in the English-speaking world.

Dickens describes Scrooge thus early in the story: &quot;The cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose, shrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin lips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice.&quot; Throughout the novella, visits from the four ghosts show Scrooge the errors of his ways, and he transforms into a better, more generous man. Scrooge&#x27;s last name has entered the English language as a byword for greed and misanthropy, while his catchphrase, &quot;Bah! Humbug!&quot; is often used to express disgust with many modern Christmas traditions.


== Description ==
Charles Dickens describes Scrooge as &quot;a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous, old sinner! Hard and sharp as flint... secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.&quot; He does business from a Cornhill warehouse and is known among the merchants of the Royal Exchange as a man of good credit. Despite having considerable personal wealth, he underpays his clerk Bob Cratchit and hounds his debtors relentlessly while living cheaply and joylessly in the chambers of his deceased business partner, Jacob Marley. Most of all, he detests Christmas, which he associates with reckless spending. When two men approach him on Christmas Eve for a donation to charity, he sneers that the poor should avail themselves of the treadmill or the workhouses, or else die to reduce the surplus population. He also refuses his nephew Fred&#x27;s invitation to Christmas dinner and denounces him as a fool for celebrating Christmas. He even frightens a young carol singer by gripping a ruler with a fit of energy. Scrooge resents giving Cratchit Christmas Day off, as there will be no business for Scrooge during the day. 

That night, Scrooge is visited by Marley&#x27;s ghost, who is condemned to walk the world forever bound in chains as punishment for his greed and inhumanity in life. Marley tells Scrooge that he will be visited by three spirits, in the hope that he will mend his ways; if he does not, Marley warns, Scrooge will wear even heavier chains than his in the afterlife.

The first spirit, the Ghost of Christmas Past, shows Scrooge visions of his early life. These visions establish Scrooge&#x27;s unloving childhood in a boarding school, where at Christmas he remained alone while his schoolmates returned home to their families. One of Scrooge&#x27;s happy memories was when his sister Fan—later Fred&#x27;s mother—came to take him home one Christmas, saying that their hard-hearted father had changed. Scrooge then apprenticed at the warehouse of a jovial and generous master, Mr. Fezziwig. He was engaged to a young woman named Belle, but gradually his love for Belle was overwhelmed by his love for money. Belle realised that he would resent her poverty and left him, eventually marrying another man. The present-day Scrooge reacts to his memories with nostalgia and deep regret.

The Ghost of Christmas Present arrives and shows Scrooge that his greed and selfishness have hurt others as well, particularly Cratchit, who cannot afford to provide his desperately ill son Tiny Tim with medical treatment because of Scrooge&#x27;s miserliness. The Spirit tells an ashamed Scrooge that Tiny Tim will die unless something changes, and throws back at Scrooge his own heartless words about the poor and destitute. Scrooge and the ghost also visit Fred&#x27;s Christmas party, where Fred defends his uncle from his guests&#x27; snide remarks. 

Finally, the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come shows Scrooge where his greed and selfishness will lead: a lonely death and a neglected grave, unpaid servants stealing his belongings, debtors relieved at his passing, and the Cratchit family devastated by the loss of Tiny Tim. Scrooge asks the Spirit if this future can still be changed, and begs for another chance, promising to change his ways – and finds himself in his bed on Christmas Day. 

An overjoyed Scrooge commits to being more generous and compassionate; he accepts his nephew&#x27;s invitation to Christmas dinner, provides for Cratchit and his family, and donates to the charity fund. From then, he is said to have become the embodiment of the Christmas spirit and became a &quot;second father&quot; to Tiny Tim.

==Origins==
Several theories have been put forward as to where Dickens got the inspiration for the character.

Ebenezer Lennox was supposedly a merchant from Edinburgh who won a catering contract for King George IV&#x27;s visit to Scotland. He was buried in Canongate Kirkyard, with a gravestone that is now lost. The theory is that Dickens noticed the gravestone that described Scroggie as being a &quot;meal man&quot; (grain merchant) but misread it as &quot;mean man.&quot; This theory has been described as &quot;a probable Dickens hoax&quot; for which &quot;[n]o one could find any corroborating evidence&quot;. There is no record of anyone named Scroggie in the Edinburgh census returns of the period. Jemmy Wood, owner of the Gloucester Old Bank and possibly Britain&#x27;s first millionaire, was nationally renowned for his stinginess, and may have been another model for Scrooge. The man whom Dickens eventually mentions in his letters and who strongly resembles the character portrayed by Dickens&#x27; illustrator, John Leech, was a noted British eccentric and miser named John Elwes (1714–1789). Another suggested inspiration for the character of Scrooge is Daniel Dancer, who Dickens mentions, along with Elwes, in &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot;.

It has been suggested that he chose the name Ebenezer (&quot;stone (of) help&quot;) to reflect the help given to Scrooge to change his life. Commentators have suggested that the surname was partly inspired by the word &quot;scrouge&quot;, meaning &quot;crowd&quot; or &quot;squeeze&quot;, which was in use in the early 1800s.

Kelly writes that Scrooge may have been influenced by Dickens&#x27; conflicting feelings for his father, whom he loved and demonised. This psychological conflict may be responsible for the two radically different Scrooges in the tale—one a cold, stingy recluse, the other a benevolent, loving man. Robert Douglas-Fairhurst, a professor of English literature, considers that in the opening part of the book portraying young Scrooge&#x27;s lonely and unhappy childhood, and his aspiration to rise from poverty to riches &quot;is something of a self-parody of Dickens&#x27;s fears about himself&quot;; the post-transformation parts of the book are how Dickens optimistically sees himself.

One school of thought is that Dickens based Scrooge&#x27;s views of the poor on those of political economist and demographer Thomas Malthus, as evidenced by his callous attitude towards the &quot;surplus population&quot;. &quot;And the Union workhouses? ... The treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour, then?&quot; are a reflection of a sarcastic question raised by the reactionary philosopher Thomas Carlyle: &quot;Are there not treadmills, gibbets; even hospitals, poor-rates, New Poor-Law?&quot;

There are literary precursors for Scrooge in Dickens&#x27;s own works. Peter Ackroyd, Dickens&#x27;s biographer, sees similarities between Scrooge and the title character of &quot;Martin Chuzzlewit&quot;, although the latter is &quot;a more fantastic image&quot; than the former; Ackroyd observes that Chuzzlewit&#x27;s transformation to a charitable man is parallel to that of Scrooge. Douglas-Fairhurst sees that the minor character Gabriel Grub from &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot; was also an influence when creating Scrooge.

== Analysis ==
Scrooge&#x27;s character, particularly how it changes throughout &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, has been the subject of several analyses.

The psychological phenomenon of increased generosity and altruism following encounters with mortality or existential dread is called the Scrooge effect.

==In other media==
* The character of Scrooge McDuck, created by Carl Barks, was at least partially based on Ebenezer Scrooge: &quot;I began to think of the great Dickens Christmas story about Scrooge… I was just thief enough to steal some of the idea and have a rich uncle for Donald.&quot;

<text>In economics, an absentee landlord is a person who owns and rents out a profit-earning property, but does not live within the property&#x27;s local economic region. The term &quot;absentee ownership&quot; was popularised by economist Thorstein Veblen&#x27;s 1923 book of the same name, &quot;Absentee Ownership&quot;. Overall, tax policy seems to favour absentee ownership. However, some jurisdictions seek to extract money from absentee owners by taxing land. Absentee ownership has sometimes put the absentee owners at risk of loss.

== Ireland ==
Absentee landlords were a highly significant issue in the history of Ireland. During the course of 16th and 17th centuries, much of Ireland&#x27;s land was confiscated from Irish Catholic landowners by the Crown during the Plantations of Ireland and granted to Protestant settlers from Great Britain who were members of the established churches (the Church of England and the Church of Ireland at the time); in Ulster, many of the landowners were Scottish Presbyterians. Confiscated land was also given to absentee Protestant landlords in Great Britain, some of whom rented it out to Irish tenants, while they themselves continued to reside in Britain. By 1782, Anglo-Irish politician Henry Grattan noted that absentee Irish landlords earned approximately £800,000 &quot;per annum&quot;, and he attempted to place an extra tax on remittances paid out to these landowners. However, many absentees landlords also reinvested part of their rents into roads and bridges, to improve local economies, that are still seen today. A notable beneficial absentee in the 19th century was Lord Palmerston, who went into debt to develop his part of Sligo; an investment that eventually paid off.

By the 1800s, resentment grew as not only were the absentee landlords Protestant (while most tenants were Catholic and forbidden to inherit land), but their existence meant that the goods produced in Ireland were primarily exported. This system became particularly detrimental to the Irish public during the Great Famine when, despite Ireland being a net exporter of food, millions starved, died of disease, or emigrated. In the years following, the land issue with the Irish Land League&#x27;s Land War became a significant issue in Ireland. The land issue was one of the historic factors which resulted in Ireland&#x27;s troubled history until the 1920s, though it had largely been addressed legislatively by 1903 in the Irish Land Acts.

== Prince Edward Island ==
An absentee landlord crisis was a key factor in Prince Edward Island&#x27;s decision to become a part of Canada when the idea of Confederation was proposed in 1867. In the mid-1760s, a survey team divided the Island into 67 lots. On July 1, 1767, these properties were allocated to associates of George III by means of a lottery. Ownership of the land remained in the hands of British-based landlords, angering settlers on the island who were unable to gain title to land on which they worked and lived. Significant rent charges (to absentee landlords) created further anger. The land had been given to the absentee landlords with a number of conditions attached regarding upkeep and settlement terms; many of these conditions were not satisfied. The settlers spent decades trying to convince the Crown to confiscate the lots, however the descendants of the original owners generally held significant levels of influence with Crown officials and refused to give up the land.

In 1853, the colonial government on the island passed the Land Purchase Act, which empowered them to purchase lands from those owners who were willing to sell, and then resell the land to settlers for low prices. This scheme collapsed when the colonial government ran short of money to continue with the purchases. Many of these lands also were fertile, and were some of the key factors to sustaining Prince Edward Island&#x27;s economy.

In 1864, the colonial government saw union with Canada as a possible solution to the landlord crisis. This followed a rent strike and riots on the island. At the Charlottetown Conference, delegates proposed a fund to purchase landlords&#x27; holdings if the Island joined Confederation. Several weeks later at the Quebec Conference this offer was withdrawn. The Island resolved not to enter Confederation as a result. The government refused offers from the other provinces and relented in 1873 only after the local economy was pushed near to collapse. Under the terms of union, Canada agreed to provide the Island with an $800 000 fund to purchase the remaining absentee holdings. in 1875, the &quot;Land Purchase Act&quot; was enacted to force owners of the large estates to sell their holdings to the provincial government.

The Island&#x27;s experience with absentee landlords affects its land ownership laws to this day. Non-residents are not permitted to purchase land in excess of two hectares without prior approval from the cabinet. In 2009 an American was fined $29,000 for contravening these laws.

== Palestine ==

The Ottoman Empire embarked on a systematic land reform program in the second half of the 19th century. Two of the new laws were the 1858 land registration law and the 1873 land emancipation act.

Prior to 1858, land in Palestine, then a part of the Ottoman Empire since 1516, was cultivated or occupied mainly by peasants. Land ownership was regulated by people living on the land according to customs and traditions. Usually, the land was communally owned by village residents, though land could be owned by individuals or families.

In 1858 the Ottoman Empire introduced &quot;The Ottoman Land Code of 1858&quot;, requiring landowners to register ownership. The reasons behind the law were twofold. (1) to increase tax revenue, and (2) to exercise greater state control over the area. Peasants, however, saw no need to register claims, for several reasons:

* landowners were subject to military service in the Ottoman Army
* general opposition to official regulations from the Ottoman Empire
* evasion of taxes and registration fees to the Ottoman Empire

The registration process itself was open to misregistration and manipulation. Land collectively owned by village residents ended up registered to one villager, and merchants and local Ottoman administrators took the opportunity to register large areas of land to their own name. The result was land that became the legal property of people who had never lived on the land, while the peasants, having lived there for generations, retained possession, but became tenants of absentee owners.

The 1856 Emancipation Reform Decree and 1869 citizenship law was interpreted as giving Jews the right to own land in Ottoman Syria under their own name. The changing of this law (the change occurring at the same time as the freeing of the Africans in the United States and in South America and the emancipation of the serfs in Russia (held in slavery by the Russian landowning class) was a part of the worldwide 19th-century movement towards emancipation and civil rights for oppressed minorities. This 1873 secular land reform/civil rights law was popularly confused with religious law and it was held as a &quot;humiliation to Islam that Jews should own a part of the Muslim Ummah&quot;. The confusion between religious and secular law made the laws (ended in 1873) against Jewish ownership of land &#x27;religious laws&#x27;. 

Over the course of the next decades land became increasingly concentrated on fewer hands; the peasants continued to work on the land, giving landlords a share of the harvest. This led to both an increased level of Palestinian nationalism as well as civil unrest. At the same time the area witnessed an increased flow of Jewish immigrants who did not restrict themselves to the cities where their concentration offered some protection from persecution. These new Jews came hoping to create a new future in what they regarded as the homeland of their ancestors. Organizations created to aid the Jewish migration to Palestine also bought land from absentee landowners. Jewish immigrants then settled on the land, sometimes replacing peasants already living there. A steady arrival of Jewish immigrants from 1882 led to several peasant insurgencies, recorded from as early as 1884–1886.

<doc id="156587" wikidata="Q181291" url="?curid=156587" title="Death Eater">
<text>The Death Eaters are characters featured in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series of novels and films. They are a radical group of wizards and witches, led by the dark wizard Lord Voldemort, who seek to purify the wizarding community by eliminating wizards and witches born to non-magical parents. They attempt to create a new order within the Ministry of Magic by spreading fear through the wizarding community and murdering those who speak out against them. Their primary opposition is the Order of the Phoenix.

Death Eaters recognise one another by the Dark Mark, a sigil branded on each of their left forearms that allows Voldemort to summon any of them instantly. Their typical attire includes black hooded robes and masks. The Death Eaters as a group first appeared in the novel &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot;, although individual members of the group, such as Severus Snape, Lucius Malfoy, and Peter Pettigrew had appeared in earlier books in the series. The group had also been mentioned indirectly in &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; and in &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot;, when followers of Voldemort were mentioned. They were mentioned the first time directly in &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot;.

==Concept==
During a Carnegie Hall event in 2007, Rowling compared the Death Eaters to the Nazi party of Germany.

==Synopsis==
===Pre-Harry Potter===
The Death Eaters first existed over 11 years before the events of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; novels, torturing and murdering Muggles (non-magical people), as well as anyone who opposed them. When a deadly curse from Voldemort rebounded off Harry Potter and disembodied the Dark Lord, the Death Eaters largely disbanded and vanished.

===Re-emergence===
Early in &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot;, a group of Death Eaters gathers at the Quidditch World Cup, which spreads chaos and fear amongst the wizarding community. Voldemort regains his full strength at the end of &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot;, and summons his followers to him.

The Minister for Magic, Cornelius Fudge, deluded himself into believing that Voldemort could not have come back and that it was all a lie cooked up by Dumbledore, who Fudge believed had designs on his political office. The Death Eaters use this tactical advantage throughout &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot; to maintain their secrecy. Because of the Ministry&#x27;s refusal to remove the Dementors from Azkaban, which Dumbledore advised immediately following Voldemort&#x27;s return, the Death Eaters recruited the Dementors to their cause and made similar progress with the giants; the Dementors&#x27; revolt against the Ministry of Magic also allowed the Death Eaters to bolster their ranks with the mass break-out of several imprisoned Death Eaters, including Bellatrix Lestrange.

Towards the end of &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot;, the Death Eaters attack Hogwarts for the first time, leading to the death of Albus Dumbledore and injuries to several of the school&#x27;s defenders. A second, more deadly attack near the conclusion of &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot; results in over 50 deaths, including Voldemort, who dies when the Killing Curse he casts at Harry rebounds on him. All the Dark Marks on the remaining Death Eaters have been reduced to scars.

===Ideology===
Voldemort&#x27;s Death Eaters practise illegal and dangerous spells known as dark magic. They follow a racist ideology that places pure-blooded wizards at the top of a racial hierarchy, above all other magical or non-magical people and entities. They believe wizards are, as a genealogy book within the story phrases it, &quot;Nature&#x27;s Nobility&quot;; other magical creatures and the non-magical are inferior and should be subjugated. Within the wizarding community, only those who are born to wizard parents are worthy of magical power, despite the fact that parentage does not in fact determine who possess such powers. They categorise wizards according to blood purity; &quot;pure-bloods&quot; (those with only wizards as parents) out-rank &quot;half-bloods&quot; (mixed parentage) and &quot;mudbloods&quot;, a derogatory name for those born to non-magical parents (Muggles). Death Eaters have also attacked pure-bloods who oppose them. Examples of this are pure-blooded members of the Order of the Phoenix such as Sirius Black, the Prewett brothers, who were murdered because of their loyalties, and the entire Weasley family. Such people are often called &quot;blood traitors&quot; by those who subscribe to Death Eater ideologies.

In reality, the idea of blood purity is a misnomer – Voldemort himself is a half-blood – and it is unlikely that all of them could be pure-bloods, as very few, if any, such people could exist given the small gene pool. In &quot;Half-Blood Prince&quot;, Rowling depicts the Gaunts as a family who are obsessed with their ancestry and driven to inbreeding to preserve its integrity. Rowling has stated on her website that there are no true pure-blood families left but that those who call themselves such simply strike Muggles, Squibs, and half-bloods from their family records. On the other hand, &quot;in rare circumstances&quot; a Muggle-born wizard can become a Death Eater. They are also not above recruiting creatures they deem inferior, as proven by werewolf Fenrir Greyback and the giant clan from continental Europe, as long as they help further the larger Death Eater agenda.

The Death Eaters seek complete power and control over the entire Wizarding world, wishing to restrict leadership to a small band of pure-bloods. The Death Eaters not only seek the restoration of pure-blood rule over the Wizarding community, but also the eventual subjugation of the Muggle community under Wizarding rule. During their control over the Ministry of Magic, they severely persecuted Muggle-born wizards, sending them to Azkaban for life or feeding them to Dementors.

==Notable Death Eaters==
===Alecto and Amycus Carrow===
Alecto and Amycus Carrow are siblings who participate in the assault on Hogwarts at the end of &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot;. Amycus is described as being squat and lumpy, with a lopsided leer and a wheezy giggle; Alecto is described as a &quot;stocky little woman&quot; and shares her brother&#x27;s squatness and laugh.

In &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot;, Alecto and Amycus become &quot;teachers&quot; at Hogwarts, severely disciplining students who oppose Voldemort. Amycus teaches Defence Against the Dark Arts, but as Neville Longbottom puts it, it becomes just &quot;The Dark Arts&quot; in which students are forced to perform the Cruciatus Curse against students who have been assigned to detention. Alecto teaches Muggle Studies, which becomes a compulsory subject, and teaches students that Muggles are like animals.

Ralph Ineson plays Amycus, and Suzie Toase appears as Alecto in the films, wherein they are reduced to non-speaking roles.

===Barty Crouch Jr===
Bartemius &quot;Barty&quot; Crouch, Junior is captured by the Ministry of Magic along with Bellatrix, Rodolphus, and Rabastan Lestrange. His father, Barty Crouch Sr., who heads the Department of Magical Law Enforcement at this time, sentences him to life imprisonment in Azkaban.

Crouch Jr later imprisons Alastor &quot;Mad-Eye&quot; Moody, a famous Auror, and uses Polyjuice Potion to assume Moody&#x27;s appearance and infiltrate Hogwarts as the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher.

The revived Triwizard Tournament is held at Hogwarts, and Voldemort tasks Crouch Jr with making sure Harry wins. To do so, he puts Harry&#x27;s name in the Goblet of Fire, bewitches Viktor Krum to attack Cedric Diggory in the maze, and stuns Fleur Delacour. When Harry and Cedric simultaneously touch the Triwizard Cup, which is a portkey, it transports them to the graveyard in Little Hangleton, home of the Riddle family. There, after killing Cedric, Death Eater Peter Pettigrew uses Harry&#x27;s blood in a ritual that re-embodies Voldemort. The Dark Lord attempts to kill Harry, but with the help of the ghost-echoes from Voldemort&#x27;s wand, Harry escapes via the Portkey.

When Harry reappears at Hogwarts, the still-disguised Crouch Jr hopes to succeed where his master failed; however, Dumbledore, Snape, and McGonagall foil his plot. Under the effects of Veritaserum, he recounts his plan to them. Although he is closely guarded so he can later repeat his testimony, a Dementor acting as bodyguard to Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge attacks Crouch and sucks out his soul before anyone can stop it. Crouch thus lives in a vegetative state, bereft of his memories or sense of self.

He is played by David Tennant in the film adaptation of &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot;.

===Antonin Dolohov===
Antonin Dolohov has a long, pale, and twisted face. He is confirmed in &quot;Half-Blood Prince&quot; to be one of Voldemort&#x27;s first Death Eaters. Dolohov is one of the five Death Eaters who murder Gideon and Fabian Prewett (Molly Weasley&#x27;s brothers). Dolohov is imprisoned in Azkaban but escapes during the mass break-out.

He participates in the battle of the Department of Mysteries, where he injures Hermione, but is imprisoned again and returns to Azkaban. He escapes once more some time before the events of &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot;. Dolohov later participates in the Battle of Hogwarts, killing Remus Lupin. Professor Flitwick finally defeats him. He is portrayed by Arben Bajraktaraj in the film adaptations of &quot;Order of the Phoenix&quot; and &quot;Deathly Hallows – Part 1&quot;.

===Fenrir Greyback===
Fenrir Greyback is a werewolf involved with the Death Eaters. He works alongside Lord Voldemort because of his promises of fairness to werewolves around the country. He does not carry the Dark Mark as he is not a Death Eater. He is known as the most savage werewolf ever to live and is greatly feared throughout the wizarding world. To fulfil his agenda of creating as many werewolves as possible, Greyback has infected scores of people, including the young Remus Lupin. Unlike most werewolves, Greyback thirsts for blood even in his human form. In &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot;, Greyback first appears on the night of Dumbledore&#x27;s death, when he attacks Harry and badly scars Bill Weasley. Greyback does not transmit his lycanthropy to Bill because he was in human form at the time.

During the Battle of Hogwarts, Ron Weasley and Neville Longbottom combine forces to defeat him.

Dave Legeno portrayed Greyback in the film adaptation of &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot;. He reprised the role in both parts of &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot;.

===Igor Karkaroff===
Igor Karkaroff (Cyrillic: Игор Каркаров) is the Headmaster at Durmstrang Institute, one of the three schools (together with Hogwarts and Beauxbatons Academy) that enter the Triwizard Tournament. As Headmaster, Karkaroff is also one of the judges. He is described as a neat, fussy-looking man with an oily voice and manner who sports a small grey goatee. While unctuously pleasant most of the time, he is capable of violent rage. He is also described as &quot;a man with yellowish teeth whose smile does not reach his cold stare&quot;. Karkaroff is angered and threatens to withdraw from the tournament when Harry is selected as a fourth champion and second representative for Hogwarts. Although he is talked down and agrees to stay, he nevertheless shows evident favouritism towards the Durmstrang champion, Bulgarian Quidditch player Viktor Krum.

Sirius Black later identifies Karkaroff as a former Death Eater.

In the sixth novel, &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot;, Remus Lupin states that Karkaroff was found dead in a shack with the Dark Mark hovering over it, an indication that he was killed by other Death Eaters.

Predrag Bjelac appeared as Karkaroff in the film adaptation of &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot;.

===Bellatrix Lestrange===

Bellatrix Lestrange is the aunt of Draco Malfoy and Nymphadora Tonks. She is introduced in &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot;. She is the most faithful member of Voldemort&#x27;s inner circle. She is described as being highly attractive yet emaciated due to her time in Azkaban. Bellatrix is portrayed as paranoid, insane, sadistic, and fanatically devoted to Voldemort, seeing service to him as the noblest duty for any true wizard or witch.

===Draco Malfoy===

Draco Malfoy is the pure-blooded son of Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy. He was a notorious bully to Harry Potter and his friends throughout the series. Draco becomes a Death Eater in his sixth year at Hogwarts and is assigned to kill Dumbledore. However, he fails and Dumbledore is ultimately killed by Snape. Draco, like his family, is part of Slytherin house. Draco repaired a vanishing cabinet to let the Death Eaters in from the inside.
In the Cursed Child, Malfoy was married to Astoria Greengrass, and has a child named Scorpius, one of the two main protagonists in the eighth Harry Potter book, and best friends with Albus Severus Potter.
He is portrayed by Tom Felton in all of the films and by Tom Stephens in the Cursed Child.

===Lucius Malfoy===
Lucius Malfoy is the head of a wealthy pure-blood wizarding family. He lives with his wife Narcissa Malfoy and their son Draco at the Malfoy Manor in Wiltshire. Lucius was a school governor of Hogwarts before being sacked, and has very close connections at the Ministry of Magic. He was educated at Hogwarts, where he was a prefect in Slytherin House.

He debuts as the main antagonist in &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot;, in which just before Draco and Harry&#x27;s second year at Hogwarts, Lucius plants Tom Riddle&#x27;s diary in Ginny Weasley&#x27;s potions cauldron while she is shopping for school supplies at Flourish &amp; Blotts, in a plot to use her to reopen the Chamber of Secrets, which would lead to attacks on Muggle-born students.

Lucius knows the diary is cleverly enchanted, but is not aware that it is a horcrux containing a part of Voldemort&#x27;s soul. He is careless with it and punished by Voldemort himself. Lucius intends to use the opening of the Chamber of Secrets by Ginny to discredit her father, Arthur Weasley, and Dumbledore. Lucius&#x27; plans are ultimately thwarted with the help of the Malfoys&#x27; house-elf Dobby, and Harry, but not before the Chamber is opened and Lucius uses the ensuing terror (and threats to attack their families) to influence the school&#x27;s Board of Governors to discredit and dismiss Dumbledore as Headmaster.

After the basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets is killed, Dumbledore is reinstated as Headmaster. Lucius, whose part in the scheme to remove Dumbledore is exposed, is ultimately stripped of his title as a Hogwarts school governor.

In &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot;, when Voldemort rises again and summons his Death Eaters, Malfoy rejoins him and asserts that he had done everything he could to help his master, who however remains unimpressed. Harry reports Malfoy&#x27;s declarations to Minister Fudge, who refuses to believe him.

During the climax of &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot;, Malfoy is the leader of the Death Eaters who are sent to retrieve the prophecy from Harry in the Hall of Prophecy. Lucius tries several ways to get the prophecy from Harry without breaking it, but the boy and his friends manage to escape from the Hall. Malfoy finally meets him in the Death Chamber, where Harry is about to give it to Malfoy when the Order of the Phoenix breaks into the Ministry and begins to duel with the Death Eaters. Dumbledore himself arrives at the end of the battle and Malfoy is captured and sent to Azkaban.

By the final book, Voldemort has given Malfoy his freedom, though he looks significantly the worse for wear, having lost Voldemort&#x27;s favour. Voldemort treats him with great contempt by hijacking his house for Headquarters, and is forcing his son to do dark deeds against his nature, sparking sympathy for the notorious family for the first time in the series. Voldemort borrows Lucius&#x27;s wand, which is accidentally destroyed by Harry Potter. Later in the book, Lucius, along with his wife and sister-in-law, accidentally allow Harry and his friends to escape from Malfoy Manor. Voldemort punishes them severely, eventually putting them under house arrest.

Despite his long-standing position as a Death Eater and Voldemort&#x27;s advocate of pure-blood supremacy, Lucius decides his love for his family is more important than his involvement in the war. During the Battle of Hogwarts, he pleads with Voldemort to let him onto the battlefield so he can find his son. He is reunited with the rest of his family at the end of the book. Because Narcissa aided Harry in the Forbidden Forest, the Malfoys all manage to avoid being sent to Azkaban after Voldemort&#x27;s death.

Lucius&#x27;s ultimate fate after &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot; is unknown, but the &quot;Malfoy Family&quot; story at the Harry Potter website claims that Lucius and Draco were pardoned of their crimes while cooperating with the authorities.

The play &quot;Harry Potter and the Cursed Child&quot; revealed that Lucius became the grandfather of Scorpius Malfoy. He would also be revealed in Act 4 to have created a prototype Time-Turner with Theodore Nott and another Time-Turner that was used by Scorpius.

In the film series, Lucius is portrayed by Jason Isaacs as an adult. Scenes with Tony Coburn as a teenage Lucius were recorded for &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot;, but were cut from the final movie. According to Isaacs, Lucius&#x27;s desire to be in a position of supremacy and a &quot;fear of the future he doesn&#x27;t belong in&quot; drive his actions; Isaacs described Lucius as &quot;a repulsive creature[...]a racist.[...] a eugenicist.[...] a bully.[...] a terrible father&quot;. When it came to Malfoy&#x27;s fate, Isaacs surmised in an interview with &quot;Syfy Wire&quot; that he believes Lucius would not feel like a member of wizarding society again after Voldemort&#x27;s fall, as society would shun him. Isaacs also states that Lucius would become a shell of his former self, lose the respect of his wife and son, protect himself with his money, and drink himself into an early grave.

===Peter Pettigrew===
Peter Pettigrew (aka Wormtail) is one of two Death Eaters known to have been in a House other than Slytherin (Gryffindor) while at Hogwarts. There, he was a close friend of Sirius Black, James Potter, and Remus Lupin, although he was the least intelligent and least talented of the group. With Sirius and James&#x27; help, Pettigrew becomes an Animagus, with the ability to transform at will into a rat. After leaving Hogwarts, Pettigrew joins forces with Voldemort, and in exchange for his own life becomes Voldemort&#x27;s spy within the Order of the Phoenix, of which Pettigrew is a member. When the Potters know that their son, Harry, is Voldemort&#x27;s target, Sirius suggests to them to use Pettigrew as Secret-Keeper because he does not believe Voldemort would ever suspect a &quot;weak, talentless thing&quot; like Pettigrew. Pettigrew betrays the secret to Voldemort, an act that leads to James and Lily&#x27;s deaths (and, ironically, Voldemort&#x27;s near-destruction). Sirius seeks revenge on Pettigrew, but during the confrontation, Pettigrew publicly accuses Sirius of the Potters&#x27; deaths, murders twelve Muggles, and cuts off his own index finger before transforming into a rat, thereby framing Sirius for the betrayal of the Potters, as well as for his own murder and that of the bystanders. Despite having done these above treacherous acts, Pettigrew genuinely felt remorse to a certain extent for his betrayal. Pettigrew is (seemingly posthumously) awarded the Order of Merlin, and hides during the next twelve years. Wanting to keep an eye on the wizarding world, he masquerades as a rat, first as Percy Weasley&#x27;s pet, and then as Ron Weasley&#x27;s. In this form (named &quot;Scabbers&quot; by the family), he is missing a toe from one paw due to the finger he cut off.

Although Pettigrew appears in the first two books in the form of Scabbers, his identity is not revealed until &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot;, in which he is the main antagonist. When a photograph of the Weasley family appears in the &quot;Daily Prophet&quot; newspaper, Sirius recognises Pettigrew&#x27;s Animagus form and escapes from Azkaban to track him down. The two confront each other in the Shrieking Shack, where Lupin and Black compel Scabbers to resume his human form. Pettigrew confesses his treachery, claiming to have committed it only to save his own life. With Sirius and Lupin about to take their revenge, Harry begs Sirius to turn Pettigrew over to the Ministry of Magic instead, to prove Sirius&#x27; innocence. Pettigrew escapes while being led out of the Shack when Lupin transforms into a werewolf. Harry&#x27;s actions result in Pettigrew owing him a life debt, and Pettigrew had in fact shown gratitude to Harry for sparing his life. This would be the reason behind Pettigrew (fruitlessly) trying to convince Voldemort to use the blood of another wizard when Voldemort wanted to use Harry&#x27;s blood to restore his corporeal form in the next book.

Pettigrew returns to the service of Voldemort, seeking him out in the forests of Albania and helping him to return to a feeble baby&#x27;s body. He abducts a Ministry of Magic employee named Bertha Jorkins, who is able to provide Voldemort with valuable information. Pettigrew (almost always referred to as &quot;Wormtail&quot; hereafter) assists Barty Crouch Jr in overpowering Mad-Eye Moody, setting up the events in the fourth book, &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot;. In the climactic confrontation in that book, Pettigrew murders Cedric Diggory on Voldemort&#x27;s orders, and brews the complex potion to regenerate Voldemort, severing his hand as one of the ingredients. Upon his return to corporeal form, Voldemort replaces Pettigrew&#x27;s missing hand with a silver one that possesses five intact fingers and great strength. Despite his actions, Pettigrew&#x27;s fortunes remain low; in &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot; Snape treats him as a servant, and in &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot; he is tasked with keeping watch over prisoners in the cellar of Malfoy Manor. While Harry and Ron are being kept there, Pettigrew checks on the prisoners and is attacked. Pettigrew begins strangling Harry with the silver hand, but when reminded by Harry that he once saved his life, Pettigrew hesitates for a moment. The silver hand turns against him and strangles him to death as punishment for his moment of pity.

In the films, Pettigrew is portrayed by Timothy Spall as an adult and by Charles Hughes as a teenager. In &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1&quot;, Pettigrew is not strangled to death by his own silver hand in Malfoy Manor as in the book; he is instead struck by Dobby and collapses. It is unknown whether he was simply stunned or killed. He only appears in a flashback in &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2&quot;.

===Severus Snape===

Severus Snape is characterised as a person of considerable complexity, whose coldly sarcastic and controlled exterior conceals deep emotions and anguish. In the first novel of the series, Snape is a teacher who is hostile from the start toward Harry and is built up to be the primary antagonist until the final chapters. As the series progresses, Snape&#x27;s portrayal evolves from that of a malicious and partisan teacher to that of a complex, pivotal character of moral ambiguity, whose true loyalties are not revealed until the end. Snape is, as revealed in &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot;, actually a spy in Voldemort&#x27;s ranks for Dumbledore. Alan Rickman plays Severus Snape in all eight movies.

===Corban Yaxley===
Corban Yaxley is the brutal-faced Death Eater who is present in the battle in which Snape killed Dumbledore. He is one of the more prominent Death Eaters, and one of Voldemort&#x27;s spies in the Ministry of Magic. In &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot;, Yaxley is invited to Malfoy Manor to witness the murder of Charity Burbage, and argues with Snape about the correct date of Harry&#x27;s departure from the Dursleys&#x27;, but John Dawlish, an Auror who is tricked by an Order member, gives him incorrect information.

Yaxley places the Imperius Curse upon Pius Thicknesse, the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. He uses Thicknesse to Imperius the other major department heads and they allow Voldemort to murder Rufus Scrimgeour; thus Thicknesse becomes Minister for Magic.

When Harry, Ron, and Hermione, disguised as ministry officials, enter the Ministry to find Slytherin&#x27;s locket, it is revealed that Yaxley has become Head of Magical Law Enforcement. He also assists Dolores Umbridge in leading the Muggle-Born Registration Commission, and the two seem to have a good relationship, together humiliating the Muggle-borns. Both are immobilised by Harry, but Yaxley recovers and grabs Hermione while she is Apparating her friends to safety. Yaxley arrives with them at Grimmauld Place, thus revealing their headquarters, but not the location to which the trio subsequently apparate.

He participates in the Battle of Hogwarts, where he duels with Professor Flitwick and is later seen among those who wait with Voldemort for Harry Potter to come to him, mistakenly believing that Harry would not come within the allotted time. When the battle resumes, he is defeated by George Weasley and Lee Jordan.

Peter Mullan appears as Yaxley in the film adaptation of &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot;.

===Other Death Eaters===
==Cultural impact==
The Mexican heavy metal band Velvet Darkness released the song &quot;Death Eaters&quot; in 2015 as part of their debut EP &quot;Delusion&quot;. It was later rerecorded in 2018 as bonus track for their debut LP &quot;Nothing But Glory&quot;, and a music video for the song was released in 2019 with a live recording of it.

<doc id="156589" wikidata="Q2866" url="?curid=156589" title="Alexander Lukashenko">
<text>Alexander Grigoryevich Lukashenko (also transliterated as Alyaksandr Ryhoravich Lukashenka; born 30 August 1954) is a Belarusian politician who has been the first and only president of Belarus since the office&#x27;s establishment in 1994, making him the current longest-serving European leader.

Before embarking on his political career, Lukashenko worked as the director of a state farm (&quot;sovkhoz&quot;) and served in both the Soviet Border Troops and the Soviet Army. In 1990, Lukashenko was elected to the Supreme Soviet of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, he assumed the position of head of the interim anti-corruption committee of the Supreme Council of Belarus. In 1994, he won the presidency in the country&#x27;s inaugural presidential election after the adoption of a new constitution.

Lukashenko opposed economic shock therapy during the 1990s post-Soviet transition, maintaining state ownership of key industries in Belarus. This spared Belarus from recessions as devastating as those in other post-Soviet states and the former Eastern Bloc countries which prevented the rise of oligarchy. Lukashenko&#x27;s maintenance of the socialist economic model is consistent with the retaining of Soviet-era symbolism, including the Russian language, coat of arms and national flag. These symbols were adopted after a controversial 1995 referendum.

Subsequent to the same referendum, Lukashenko acquired increased power, including the authority to dismiss the Supreme Council. Another referendum in 1996 further facilitated his consolidation of power. Lukashenko has since presided over an authoritarian government and has been labeled by the media as &quot;Europe&#x27;s last dictator&quot;. International monitors have not regarded Belarusian elections as free and fair, except for his initial win. The government suppresses opponents and limits media freedom. This has resulted in multiple Western governments imposing sanctions on Lukashenko and other Belarusian officials. Lukashenko&#x27;s contested victory in the 2020 presidential election preceded allegations of vote-rigging, amplifying anti-government protests, the largest seen during his rule. Consequently, the United Kingdom, the European Union, and the United States ceased to recognise Lukashenko as the legitimate president of Belarus following the disputed election.

Such isolation from parts of the West has increased his dependence on Russia, with whom Lukashenko had already maintained close ties despite some disagreements related to trade. This has been particularly the case following the rise to power of Vladimir Putin, replacing reformist president Boris Yeltsin. Lukashenko played a crucial role in creating the Union State of Russia and Belarus, enabling Belarusians and Russians to travel, work, and study freely between the two countries. He also reportedly played a crucial role in brokering a deal to end the Russian Wagner Group rebellion in 2023, allowing some Wagner soldiers into Belarus.

==Early life, family and education==
Lukashenko was born on 30 August 1954 in the settlement of Kopys in Vitebsk Region of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic. Starting with an interview given in 2009, Lukashenko has said that his actual birthday is 31 August, the same as his son&#x27;s Nikolai&#x27;s. This caused some confusion as all official sources had said 30 August 1954 up until then. An explanation was later given that his mother had entered the hospital on the 30th in labour but not given birth until after midnight.

His maternal grandfather, Trokhym Ivanovich Lukashenko, was born near Shostka in the then-Russian Empire, now in the Ukrainian village known today as Sobycheve. Lukashenko grew up without a father in his childhood, leading him to be taunted by his schoolmates for having an unmarried mother. Due to this, the origin of his patronymic &quot;Grigorevich&quot; is unknown and there are varying rumours about the identity of Lukashenko&#x27;s father. The most common suggestion is that the man was a Roma passing through the region. His mother, Ekaterina Trofimovna Lukashenko (1924–2015), had given birth to another son, older than Alexander, who later died on an unknown date. Ekaterina worked unskilled jobs on a railway, at a construction site, at a flax factory in Orsha and finally as a milkmaid in Alexandria, a small village in the east of Belarus, close to the Russian border.

Lukashenko went to Alexandria secondary school. He graduated from the Mogilev Pedagogical Institute (now Mogilev State A. Kuleshov University) in Mogilev in 1975 after 4 years of studies. He also completed studies at the Belarusian Agricultural Academy in Horki in 1985.

==Military and early politics career==

He served in the Soviet Border Troops from 1975 to 1977, where he was an instructor of the political department of military unit No. 2187 of the Western Frontier District in Brest and in the Soviet Army from 1980 to 1982. In addition, he led an All-Union Leninist Young Communist League (Komsomol) chapter in Mogilev from 1977 to 1978. While in the Soviet Army, Lukashenko was a deputy political officer of the 120th Guards Motor Rifle Division, which was based in Minsk.

In 1979, he joined the ranks of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Communist Party of Byelorussia. After leaving the military, he became the deputy chairman of a collective farm in 1982 and in 1985. In 1987, he was appointed as the director of the Gorodets state farm in Shklow district and in early 1988, was one of the first in Mogilev Region to introduce a leasing contract to a state farm.

In 1990, Lukashenko was elected Deputy to the Supreme Soviet of the Byelorussian SSR. Having acquired a reputation as an eloquent opponent of corruption, Lukashenko was elected in April 1993 to be interim chairman of the anti-corruption committee of the Belarusian parliament. In late 1993 he accused 70 senior government officials, including the Supreme Soviet chairman Stanislav Shushkevich and prime minister Vyacheslav Kebich, of corruption including stealing state funds for personal purposes. While the charges ultimately proved to be without merit, Shushkevich resigned his chairmanship due to the embarrassment of this series of events and losing a vote of no-confidence. He was in that position until July 1994.

==Presidency==
===First term (1994–2001)===
A new Belarusian constitution enacted in early 1994 paved the way for the first democratic presidential election on 23 June and 10 July. Six candidates stood in the first round, including Lukashenko, who campaigned as an independent on a populist platform. In an interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot;, he declared: &quot;I am neither with the leftists nor the rightists. But with the people against those who rob and deceive them.&quot; Stanislav Shushkevich and Vyacheslav Kebich also ran, with the latter regarded as the clear favorite. Lukashenko won 45.1% of the vote while Kebich received 17.4%, Zianon Pazniak received 12.9% and Shushkevich, along with two other candidates, received less than 10% of votes.

Lukashenko won the second round of the election on 10 July with 80.1% of the vote. The presidential inauguration was held in the halls of the Government House, on 20 July 1994, exactly ten days after the election, during a special meeting of the parliament, the Supreme Council. Shortly after his inauguration, he addressed the State Duma of the Russian Federation in Moscow proposing a new Union of Slavic states, which would culminate in the creation of the Union of Russia and Belarus in 1999.

In February 1995, Lukashenko announced his intention to hold a referendum. For the young democratic republic this raised the controversial issue of the Russification of Belarus. Lukashenko said he would press ahead with the referendum regardless of opposition in the Supreme Council and threatened to suspend its activities if it did not agree to hold the referendum. On 11 April 1995, a vote was held in parliament on calling a referendum on four issues proposed by Lukashenko: 1) granting Russian the status of a state language, 2) changing state symbols, 3) on economic integration with Russia and 4) on giving the president the right to dissolve parliament. The deputies rejected all the issues, except for that which regarded economic integration with Russia. It is unclear whether the president had legal power independently to call referendums, and if so, if they would be binding. Lukashenko stated that the referendum would be held despite the rejection by the deputies.

In protest, 19 out of a total of 238 deputies of the Belarusian Popular Front led by Zianon Pazniak and the Belarusian Social Democratic Assembly led by Oleg Trusov (b. Алег Анатолевіч Трусаў) began a hunger strike in the parliamentary meeting room and stayed there overnight on the night of 11–12 April. At night, under the pretext of a bomb threat, unidentified law enforcement personnel attacked and forcibly expelled the deputies. Lukashenko stated that he personally ordered the evacuation for security purposes. The Supreme Council accepted to hold the referendum on 13 April and in May 1995, Belarusian authorities held a referendum on the four issues. The OSCE Parliamentary Assembly found neither the referendum nor the 1995 Belarusian parliamentary election which took place in the same month to have met conditions for free and fair elections.

In the summer of 1996, deputies of the 199-member Belarusian parliament signed a petition to impeach Lukashenko on charges of violating the Constitution. Shortly after that, a referendum was held on 24 November 1996 in which four questions were offered by Lukashenko and three offered by a group of Parliament members. The questions ranged from social issues, including changing the independence day to 3 July (the date of the liberation of Minsk from Nazi forces in 1944) and the abolition of the death penalty, to the national constitution. As a result of the referendum, the constitution that was amended by Lukashenko was accepted and the one amended by the Supreme Council was voided. On 25 November, it was announced that 70.5% of voters, of an 84% turnout, had approved the amended constitution. The US and the EU, however, refused to accept the legitimacy of the referendum.

After the referendum, Lukashenko convened a new parliamentary assembly from those members of the parliament who were loyal to him. After between ten and twelve deputies withdrew their signature from the impeachment petition, only about forty deputies of the old parliament were left and the Supreme Council was dismissed by Lukashenko. Nevertheless, international organizations and many Western countries do not recognize the current parliament given the way it was formed. Lukashenko was elected chairman of the Belarusian Olympic Committee in 1997. At the start of 1998, the Central Bank of Russia suspended trading of the Belarusian ruble, which led to a collapse in the value of the currency. Lukashenko responded by taking control of the National Bank of the Republic of Belarus, sacking the entire bank leadership and blaming the west for the free fall of the currency.
Lukashenko blamed foreign governments for conspiring against him and, in April 1998, expelled ambassadors from the Drazdy complex near Minsk and moved them to another building. The Drazdy conflict caused an international outcry and resulted in a travel ban on Lukashenko from both the EU and the US. Although the ambassadors eventually returned after the controversy died down, Lukashenko stepped up his rhetorical attacks against the West. He stated that Western governments were trying to undermine Belarus at all levels, even sports, during the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan.

Upon the outbreak of the Kosovo War in 1999, Lukashenko suggested to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milošević that Yugoslavia join the Union of Russia and Belarus.

===Second term (2001–2006)===
Under the original constitution, Lukashenko should have been up for reelection in 1999. However, the 1996 referendum extended Lukashenko&#x27;s term for two additional years. In the 9 September 2001 election, Lukashenko faced Vladimir Goncharik and Sergei Gaidukevich. During the campaign, Lukashenko promised to raise the standards of farming, social benefits and increase industrial output of Belarus. Lukashenko won in the first round with 75.65% of the vote. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) said the election process &quot;failed to meet international standards&quot;.

&quot;Jane&#x27;s Intelligence Digest&quot; surmised that the price of Russian support for Lukashenko ahead of the 2001 presidential election was the surrender of Minsk&#x27;s control over its section of the Yamal–Europe gas pipeline. After the results were announced declaring Lukashenko the winner, Russia publicly welcomed Lukashenko&#x27;s re-election; the Russian President, Vladimir Putin, telephoned Lukashenko and offered a message of congratulations and support.

Following the 2003 invasion of Iraq, American intelligence agencies reported that aides of Saddam Hussein managed to acquire Belarusian passports while in Syria, but that it was unlikely that Belarus would offer a safe haven for Saddam and his two sons. This action, along with arms deals with Iraq and Iran, prompted Western governments to take a tougher stance against Lukashenko. The US was particularly angered by the arms sales, and American political leaders increasingly began to refer to Belarus as &quot;Europe&#x27;s last dictatorship&quot;. The EU was concerned for the security of its gas supplies from Russia, which are piped through Belarus, and took an active interest in Belarusian affairs. With the accession of Poland, Latvia and Lithuania, the EU&#x27;s border with Belarus has grown to more than 1000 kilometers.

During a televised address to the nation on 7 September 2004, Lukashenko announced plans for a referendum to eliminate presidential term limits. This was held on 17 October 2004, the same day as parliamentary elections, and, according to official results, was approved by 79.42% of voters. Previously, Lukashenko had been limited to two terms and thus would have been constitutionally required to step down after the presidential elections in 2006. Opposition groups, the OSCE, the European Union, and the US State Department stated that the vote fell short of international standards. Belarus grew economically under Lukashenko, but much of this growth was due to Russian crude oil which was imported at below-market prices, refined, and sold to other European countries at a profit.

=== Third term (2006–2010) ===
After Lukashenko confirmed he was running for re-election in 2005, opposition groups began to seek a single candidate. On 16 October 2005, on the Day of Solidarity with Belarus, the political groups Zubr and Third Way Belarus encouraged all opposition parties to rally behind one candidate to oppose Lukashenko in the 2006 election. Their chosen candidate was Alexander Milinkevich. Lukashenko reacted by saying that anyone going to opposition protests would have their necks wrung &quot;as one might a duck&quot;. On 19 March 2006, exit polls showed Lukashenko winning a third term in a landslide, amid opposition reports of vote-rigging and fear of violence. The Belarusian Republican Youth Union gave Lukashenko 84.2% and Milinkevich 3.1%. The Gallup Organisation noted that the Belarusian Republican Youth Union are government-controlled and released the exit poll results before noon on election day even though voting stations did not close until 8 pm.

Belarusian authorities vowed to prevent any large-scale demonstrations following the election (such as those that marked the Orange Revolution in Ukraine). Despite their efforts, the opposition had the largest number of demonstrators in years, with nightly protests in Minsk continuing for a number of days after the election. The largest protest occurred on election night; reporters for the Associated Press estimated that approximately 10,000 people turned out. Election observers from the Russia-led Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) differed on the Belarusian election.

The OSCE declared on 20 March 2006 that the &quot;presidential election failed to meet OSCE commitments for democratic elections.&quot; Lukashenko &quot;permitted State authority to be used in a manner which did not allow citizens to freely and fairly express their will at the ballot box... a pattern of intimidation and the suppression of independent voices... was evident throughout the campaign.&quot; The heads of all 25 EU countries declared that the election was &quot;fundamentally flawed&quot;. In contrast, the Russian minister of foreign affairs declared, &quot;Long before the elections, the OSCE&#x27;s Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights had declared that they [the elections] would be illegitimate and it was pretty biased in its commentaries on their progress and results, thus playing an instigating role.&quot; Lukashenko later stated that he had rigged the election results, but against himself, in order to obtain a majority more typical of European countries. Although he had won 93.5% of the vote, he said, he had directed the government to announce a result of 86%.

Some Russian nationalists, such as Dmitry Rogozin and the Movement Against Illegal Immigration, stated that they would like to see Lukashenko become President of Russia in 2008. Lukashenko responded that he would not run for the Russian presidency, but that if his health was still good, he might run for reelection in 2011.

In September 2008, parliamentary elections were held. Lukashenko had allowed some opposition candidates to stand, though in the official results, opposition members failed to get any of the 110 available seats. OSCE observers described the vote as &quot;flawed&quot;, including &quot;several cases of deliberate falsification of results&quot;. Opposition members and supporters demonstrated in protest. According to the Nizhny Novgorod-based CIS election observation mission, the findings of which are often dismissed by the West, the elections in Belarus conformed to international standards. Lukashenko later commented that the opposition in Belarus was financed by foreign countries and was not needed.

In April 2009, he held talks with Pope Benedict XVI in the Vatican, Lukashenko&#x27;s first visit to Western Europe after a travel ban on him a decade earlier.

In August 2009, during a working trip to the Vitebsk Region, Lukashenko announced a program for the revival of Belarusian potato production, saying: &quot;We will finish working on a special program, we will decide how many potatoes we need for the domestic market, how many potatoes we can sell&quot; and that &quot;we&#x27;ll bring back this crop that is very valuable to us&quot;. Later, Lukashenko received the nickname &quot;potato führer&quot; from his detractors.

=== Fourth term (2010–2015) ===
Lukashenko was one of ten candidates registered for the presidential election held in Belarus on 19 December 2010. Though originally envisaged for 2011, an earlier date was approved &quot;to ensure the maximum participation of citizens in the electoral campaign and to set most convenient time for the voters&quot;. The run-up to the campaign was marked by a series of Russian media attacks on Lukashenko. The Central Election Committee said that all nine opposition figures were likely to get less than half the vote total that Lukashenko would get. Though opposition figures alleged intimidation and that &quot;dirty tricks&quot; were being played, the election was seen as comparatively open as a result of desire to improve relations with both Europe and the US.

On election day, two presidential candidates were seriously beaten by police in different opposition rallies. On the night of the election, opposition protesters chanting &quot;Out!&quot;, &quot;Long live Belarus!&quot; and other similar slogans attempted to storm the building of the government of Belarus, smashing windows and doors before riot police were able to push them back. The number of protesters was reported by major news media as being around or above 10,000 people. At least seven of the opposition presidential candidates were arrested.

Several of the opposition candidates, along with their supporters and members of the media, were arrested. Many were sent to prison, often on charges of organizing a mass disturbance. Examples include Andrei Sannikov, Alexander Otroschenkov, Ales Michalevic, Mikola Statkevich, and Uladzimir Nyaklyayew. Sannikov&#x27;s wife, journalist Irina Khalip, was put under house arrest. Yaraslau Ramanchuk&#x27;s party leader, Anatoly Lebedko, was also arrested.

The CEC said that Lukashenko won 79.65% of the vote (he gained 5,130,557 votes) with 90.65% of the electorate voting. The OSCE categorized the elections as &quot;flawed&quot; while the CIS mission observers approved the results as legitimate. However, the OSCE also stated that some improvements were made in the run-up to the election, including the candidates&#x27; use of television debates and ability to deliver their messages unhindered. Several European foreign ministers issued a joint statement calling the election and its aftermath an &quot;unfortunate step backwards in the development of democratic governance and respect for human rights in Belarus.&quot;

Lukashenko&#x27;s inauguration ceremony of 22 January 2011 was boycotted by EU ambassadors, and only thirty-two foreign diplomats attended. During this ceremony, Lukashenko defended the legitimacy of his re-election and vowed that Belarus would never have its own version of the 2004 Orange Revolution in Ukraine or Georgia&#x27;s 2003 Rose Revolution.

Effective 31 January 2011, the EU renewed a travel ban, prohibiting Lukashenko and 156 of his associates from traveling to EU member countries, as a result of the crackdown on opposition supporters.

Lukashenko was supportive of China&#x27;s Belt and Road Initiative global infrastructure development strategy, and the inception in 2012 of the associated low-tax China–Belarus Industrial Park near Minsk National Airport planned to grow to by the 2060s.

=== Fifth term (2015–2020) ===


On 11 October 2015, Lukashenko was elected for his fifth term as the president of Belarus. Just over three weeks later, he was inaugurated in the Independence Palace in the presence of attendees such as former president of Ukraine Leonid Kuchma, Chairman of the Russian Communist Party Gennady Zyuganov and Belarusian biathlete Darya Domracheva. On mid-September 2017, Lukashenko oversaw the advancement of joint Russian and Belarusian military relations during the military drills that were part of the Zapad 2017 exercise.

In August 2018, Lukashenko fired his prime minister Andrei Kobyakov and various other officials due to a corruption scandal. Sergei Rumas was appointed to take his place as prime minister. In May 2017, Lukashenko signed a decree on the Foundation of the Directorate of the 2019 European Games in Minsk.
In April 2019, Lukashenko announced that the games were on budget and on time and eventually he opened the 2nd edition of the event on 21 June. Between 1–3 July 2019, he oversaw the country&#x27;s celebrations of the 75th anniversary of the Minsk Offensive, which culminated in an evening military parade of the Armed Forces of Belarus on the last day, which is the country&#x27;s Independence Day.In August 2019, Lukashenko met with former Kyrgyz President Kurmanbek Bakiyev, who has lived in exile in Minsk since 2010, in the Palace of Independence to mark Bakiyev&#x27;s 70th birthday, which he had marked several days earlier. The meeting, which included the presentation of traditional flowers and symbolic gifts, angered the Kyrgyz Foreign Ministry which stated that the meeting &quot;fundamentally does not meet the principles of friendship and cooperation between the two countries&quot;. In November 2019, Lukashenko visited the Austrian capital of Vienna on a state visit, which was his first in three years to an EU country. During the visit, he met with President Alexander Van der Bellen, Chancellor Brigitte Bierlein, and National Council President Wolfgang Sobotka. He also paid his respects at the Soviet War Memorial at the Schwarzenbergplatz.

During the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, he undertook two working visits to Russia, one of the few European leaders to undertake foreign visits during the pandemic. He also received Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán during his state visit to Minsk. Orbán called for an end to EU sanctions on Belarus during this visit. His first visit to Russia was to attend the rescheduled Moscow Victory Day Parade on Red Square together with his son.

=== Sixth term (2020–2025) ===
On 9 August 2020, according to the preliminary count, Lukashenko was re-elected for his sixth term as the President of Belarus. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned that the election was &quot;not free [or] fair&quot;.

Mass protests erupted across Belarus following the 2020 Belarusian presidential election which was marred by allegations of widespread electoral fraud. Subsequently, opposition presidential candidate Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya claimed she had received between 60 and 70% of the vote and formed a Coordination council to facilitate the peaceful and orderly transfer of power in Belarus.

On 15 August 2020, Lithuanian foreign minister Linas Linkevičius referred to Lukashenko as the &quot;former president&quot; of Belarus. It was reported that President Lukashenko&#x27;s authorities asked Kremlin representatives about the possibility of Lukashenko escaping to Russia. Furthermore, it was reported that Russia admits that Lukashenko&#x27;s resignation from the post of head of state is likely.

On 17 August 2020, the members of the European Parliament issued a joint statement which stated that they do not recognise Alexander Lukashenko as the president of Belarus, considering him to be &quot;persona non grata&quot; in the European Union. On 19 August, the member states of the European Union agreed to not recognise the results and issued a statement saying &quot;The 9 August elections were neither free nor fair, therefore we do not recognise the results&quot;. The governments of the United States, United Kingdom and Canada have also refused to recognise the results. In an interview on 22 August, Josep Borrell explicitly stated that the European Union does not recognise Lukashenko as the legitimate president of Belarus in the same manner that it does not recognise Nicolás Maduro as the legitimate president of Venezuela.

On 23 August 2020, footage emerged showing Lukashenko at the Independence Palace in Minsk. In the first two videos, he is seen walking near a helicopter, wearing a bullet proof vest and holding an assault rifle (possibly an AK-47) and then walking around the palace grounds. In the latter footage, Lukashenko was heard to say &quot;Leave me alone,&quot; and &quot;There is no one left there, right?&quot;. His 15-year-old son, Nikolai, was seen with him dressed in military uniform and holding a gun.

In a third video, he is seen surveying protestors from a helicopter and is heard saying &quot;How the rats ran away&quot; in an apparent reference to the protesters. In a fourth video, Lukashenko was seen removing the former flag of Belarus from a flower bed, waving at security personnel and in reference to protesters, saying &quot;we will deal with them&quot;. On 30 August, the Independence Palace became again a scene of protests. When questioned about the whereabouts of Alexander Lukashenko on this day, his publicity team released an undated photograph of him walking around the grounds of the Independence Palace holding a gun.

On 23 September 2020, Lukashenko was formally inaugurated president for a sixth term in a ceremony at the Palace of Independence attended by an invited group of 700 guests.

On 27 November 2020, Lukashenko announced that he would resign once Belarus&#x27; new constitution was adopted.

In December, the executive board of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) decided to exclude until further notice all members of the Belarusian Olympic Committee from all IOC events, specifically targeting Lukashenko who was elected as its chairman in 1997.

On 17 April 2021, Russia&#x27;s FSB security service exposed an alleged military coup and assassination attempt of Lukashenko. Russia also stated that it prevented Lukashenko&#x27;s murder. Two suspects, who were detained at Lukashenko&#x27;s request, were and Yuras Zyankovich. Both are critics of Lukashenko, with the latter being a dual American-Belarusian citizen, despite Belarus not recognizing dual citizenship.

On 24 April 2021, Lukashenko announced that he would sign a decree to amend emergency transfer of power. &quot;I will sign a decree about how the power in Belarus will be set up. If the President is shot the security council will get the power.&quot; Lukashenko is the head of the Security Council himself; however, his eldest son, Victor Lukashenko, is regarded as its informal leader. This move was seen to empower his son, to be in the perfect position to succeed him in the next elections. Under current law, the prime minister assumes the presidential powers if the presidency becomes vacant, but Lukashenko said that the prime minister will only become the nominal leader and all decisions would be taken by the 20-person security council, by secret ballot.
On 5 May 2021, Belarusians in Germany filed a legal complaint against Lukashenko for &#x27;state torture&#x27; and &#x27;crimes against humanity.&#x27; If he enters Germany he risks trial or if convicted and enters Germany faces punishment given by court. Lukashenko responded that Germany was not in a position to criticize him, referring to the German Government as the &quot;Heirs of Fascism&quot;. At the same time, he said that he will not resign, a reversal from his statement in November, but said he will call early presidential elections if and only if the United States does so as well.
On 9 May 2021, Lukashenko signed the decree, announced on 24 April 2021, titled &quot;On the Protection of sovereignty and constitutional order&quot;. The contingency decree states that in the event that the President is unable to perform his duties, martial law will be immediately imposed and presidential power will be transferred to the Security Council, which is widely believed to be made up of strong allies of Lukashenko.

On 24 June 2023, Lukashenko said he had negotiated with Yevgeny Prigozhin with the agreement of Vladimir Putin in ending the Wagner Group rebellion. Lukashenko told Wagner that he would be squashed like bugs if he tried to enter Belarus and warned that Putin would never agree to remove top generals, including Defense minister Sergei Shoigu. He promised to accommodate Wagner&#x27;s troops in Belarus. He claimed that Putin desired to destroy the Wagner Group after the mutiny and he prevented Putin from materializing the obliteration of the group. Lukashenko&#x27;s rule in the crisis raised his clout internationally.

On 25 March 2023, Putin announced plans to install Russian tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus. On 27 September 2024, Lukashenko warned that Belarus will use nuclear weapons if attacked by the West.

=== Seventh term (2025–present) ===
Lukashenko was reelected in the 2025 Belarusian presidential election on 26 January, with official results showing that he had won around 88% of the vote.

=== Domestic policy ===
The political system of Lukashenko has become colloquially known as &quot;Lukashism&quot; or &quot;Lukashenkoism&quot;. John Sweeney summarised Lukashism as &quot;a mutant version of the Soviet Union&#x27;s deal with its people: they pretend to pay us, and we pretend to work; we pretend to vote for him; he pretends that the vote is fair&quot;.

Lukashenko promotes himself as a &quot;.&quot; Lukashenko wanted to rebuild Belarus when he took office; the economy was in freefall due to declining industry and lack of demand for Belarusian goods. Lukashenko kept many industries under the control of the government. In 2001, he stated his intention to improve the social welfare of his citizens and to make Belarus &quot;powerful and prosperous.&quot;

With the ascent to power of Lukashenko in 1994, the Russification policy of Russian Imperial and Soviet era was renewed. In 2006, Lukashenko said that people who speak Belarusian language cannot do anything, because nothing great can be expressed in Belarusian as the Belarusian language is a poor language and there are only two great languages in the world: Russian and English.

Since the November 1996 referendum, Lukashenko has effectively held all governing power in the nation. Under the Constitution, if the House of Representatives rejects his choice for prime minister twice, he has the right to dissolve it. His decrees have greater weight than ordinary legislation. He also has near-absolute control over government spending; parliament can only increase or decrease spending with his permission. However, the legislature is dominated by his supporters in any event, and there is no substantive opposition to presidential decisions. Indeed, every seat in the lower house has been held by pro-Lukashenko MPs for all but one term since 2004. He also appoints eight members of the upper house, the Council of the Republic, as well as nearly all judges.

====Economy====

Lukashenko&#x27;s early economic policies aimed to prevent issues that occurred in other post-Soviet states, such as the establishment of oligarchic structures and mass unemployment. The unemployment rate for the country at the end of 2011 was at 0.6% of the population (of 6.86 million eligible workers), a decrease from 1995, when unemployment was 2.9% with a working-eligible population of 5.24 million. The per-capita gross national income rose from US$1,423 in 1993 to US$5,830 at the end of 2011.

One major economic issue Lukashenko faced throughout his presidency was the value of the Belarusian ruble. For a time it was pegged to major foreign currencies, such as the euro, US dollar and the Russian ruble in order to maintain the stability of the Belarusian ruble. Yet, the currency has experienced several periods of devaluation. A major devaluation took place in 2011 after the government announced that average salaries would increase to US$500. The 2011 devaluation was the largest on record for the past twenty years according to the World Bank.

Belarus also had to seek a bailout from international sources and, although it has received loans from China, loans from the IMF and other agencies depend on how Belarus reforms its economy.

Some critics of Lukashenko, including the opposition group Zubr, use the term &quot;Lukashism&quot; to refer to the political and economic system Lukashenko has implemented in Belarus. The term is also used more broadly to refer to an authoritarian ideology based on a cult of his personality and nostalgia for Soviet times among certain groups in Belarus. The US Congress sought to aid the opposition groups by passing the Belarus Democracy Act of 2004 to introduce sanctions against Lukashenko&#x27;s government and provide financial and other support to the opposition.

Lukashenko supporters argue that his rule spared Belarus the turmoil that beset many other former Soviet countries. Lukashenko commented on the criticism of him by saying: &quot;I&#x27;ve been hearing these accusations for over 10 years and we have got used to it. We are not going to answer them. I want to come from the premise that the elections in Belarus are held for ourselves. I am sure that it is the Belarusian people who are the masters in our state.&quot;

&quot;Global Finance&quot; magazine listed Belarus as the 115th poorest country in the world in 2024.

====COVID-19 pandemic====
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Lukashenko stated that concerns about the pandemic were a &quot;frenzy and a psychosis&quot; and that working the tractors, drinking vodka and going to saunas could prevent people from infection from the virus. &quot;People are working in tractors. No one is talking about the virus&quot;, Lukashenko said on 16 March 2020. &quot;There, the tractor will heal everyone. The fields heal everyone&quot;. He also said: &quot;I don&#x27;t drink, but recently I&#x27;ve been saying that people should not only wash their hands with vodka, but also poison the virus with it. You should drink the equivalent of 40–50 milliliters of rectified spirit daily&quot;, but he advised against doing so while at work. Lukashenko described these comments as a joke. By early May, Belarus was reported to have 15,000 diagnosed cases, one of the highest per capita rates of infection in Eastern Europe.

On 28 July 2020, Lukashenko announced he had asymptomatic COVID-19. Neither the Presidential Administration nor the country&#x27;s health service have commented on this statement.

On 12 August 2021, Lukashenko stated that he is strongly opposed to making vaccination mandatory. &quot;There will be no mandatory vaccination in Belarus. I am strongly against it. Vaccination will remain voluntary. If a person wants to be vaccinated it is good, if not, let it be&quot;.

===Political repression===
==== Torture, sexual abuse and other forms of repression ====

On 1 September 2020, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) declared that its experts received reports of 450 documented cases of torture and ill-treatment of people who were arrested during the protests following the presidential election. The experts also received reports of violence against women and children, including sexual abuse and rape with rubber batons. According to the OHCHR, both male and female detainees were subjected to rape and other forms of sexual and gender-based violence. Medical records reviewed by OHCHR indicate lesions and other injuries to the male genitalia associated with forcible twisting and rape. Psychological violence, including threats of rape, was also used against detainees.

At least three detainees suffered injuries indicative of sexual violence in Okrestino prison in Minsk or on the way there. The victims were hospitalized with intramuscular bleeding of the rectum, anal fissure and bleeding, and damage to the mucous membrane of the rectum.

In an interview from September 2020 Lukashenko claimed that detainees faked their bruises, saying, &quot;Some of the girls there had their butts painted in blue&quot;. In November 2021, however, Lukashenko confirmed in an interview to the British Broadcasting Corporation that people were beaten in Okrestino, saying: &quot;OK, OK, I admit it, I admit it. People were beaten in the Okrestina Detention Centre. But there were police beaten up too and you didn&#x27;t show this.&quot;

In January 2021, an audio recording was released in which the commander of internal troops and deputy interior minister of Belarus Mikalai Karpiankou tells security forces that they can cripple, maim and kill protesters in order to make them understand their actions. This, he says, is justified because anyone who takes to the streets is participating in a kind of guerrilla warfare. In addition, he discussed the establishment of camps, surrounded by barbed wire, where protesters will be detained until the situation calms down. A spokeswoman for the Interior Ministry stamped the audio file as a fake.

However, a phonoscopic examination of the audio recording confirmed that the voice on the recording belongs to Karpiankou. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe expressed its concern about the remarks. According to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, such a camp was indeed used near the town of Slutsk in the days from 13 to 15 August 2020. Many of those detained there are said to have been brought from the Okrestina prison in Minsk.

In March 2023, Lukashenko signed a law which allows to use capital punishment against officials and soldiers convicted of high treason.

==== Forced disappearances ====

In 1999 opposition leaders Yury Zacharanka and Viktar Hanchar together with his business associate Anatol Krasouski disappeared. Hanchar and Krasouski disappeared the same day of a broadcast on state television in which President Alexander Lukashenko ordered the chiefs of his security services to crack down on &quot;opposition scum.&quot; Although the State Security Committee of the Republic of Belarus (KGB) had them under constant surveillance, the official investigation announced that the case could not be solved. The investigation of the disappearance of journalist Dzmitry Zavadski in 2000 has also yielded no results. Copies of a report by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, which linked senior Belarusian officials to the cases of disappearances, were confiscated.

In September 2004, the European Union and the United States issued travel bans for five Belarusian officials suspected in being involved in the kidnapping of Zacharanka: Interior Affairs Minister Vladimir Naumov, Prosecutor General Viktor Sheiman, Minister for Sports and Tourism Yuri Sivakov, and Colonel Dmitri Pavlichenko from the Belarus Interior Ministry.

In December 2019, Deutsche Welle published a documentary film in which Yury Garavski, a former member of a special unit of the Belarusian Ministry of Internal Affairs, confirmed that it was his unit which had arrested, taken away and murdered Zecharanka and that they later did the same with Viktar Hanchar and Anatol Krassouski.

==== Assassination plans on dissidents abroad ====
On 4 January 2021, the EU Observer reported that new evidence, including documents and audio recordings, provide that Belarusian secret services planned to murder dissidents abroad. An audio file, allegedly being a recording from a bugged meeting in 2012, reveals Vadim Zaitsev, the KGB chairman at the time, discussing the murder plot with two officers from the KGB&#x27;s Alpha Group, an elite counter-terrorism unit. Translated from Russian, one of the voices in the recording says, &quot;We should be working with Sheremet, who is a massive pain in the arse [inaudible]. We&#x27;ll plant [a bomb] and so on and this fucking rat will be taken down in fucking pieces, legs in one direction, arms in the other direction. If everything [looks like] natural causes, it won&#x27;t get into people&#x27;s minds the same way.&quot; In addition to planting a bomb, they also discuss poisoning Sheremet.

====Allegations of state-sponsored hijacking====
On 23 May 2021, Lukashenko personally ordered Ryanair Flight 4978 en route from Athens to Vilnius, carrying the opposition journalist Roman Protasevich, to land in Belarus. The flight was forced to land at Minsk International Airport shortly before it reached the Lithuanian border after Belarusian air traffic control conveyed a report of explosives on board the plane. The flight was escorted by a Belarusian Air Force MiG-29 fighter jet. Belarusian authorities said no explosives were found and arrested Protasevich, who was placed in a list of &quot;individuals involved in terrorist activity&quot; the previous year for his role in the anti-government protests and incitement to Public disorder. The move was condemned by opposition figures, with Tsikhanouskaya saying that Protasevich &quot;faces the death penalty&quot; in Belarus.

===Foreign policy===
====Russia====

In the 1990s, Lukashenko and the then-Russian president Boris Yeltsin envisaged the formation of a Union State. Yeltsin suffered from poor health and alcoholism, which induced Lukashenko into thinking that he would lead both states. But After Yeltsin anointed Putin as his successor, Lukashenko stalled the merger.

Lukashenko&#x27;s relationship with Russia, once his powerful ally and vocal supporter, has significantly deteriorated. The run-up to the 2010 Belarusian presidential election was marked by a series of Russian media attacks on Lukashenko. Throughout July state-controlled channel NTV broadcast a multi-part documentary entitled &quot;The Godfather&quot; highlighting the suspicious disappearance of the opposition leaders Yury Zacharanka and Viktar Hanchar, businessman Anatol Krasouski and journalist Dzmitry Zavadski during the late 1990s. Lukashenko called the media attack &quot;dirty propaganda&quot;.

Despite a historically good relationship with Russia, tensions between Lukashenko and the Russian government started showing in 2020. On 24 January 2020, Lukashenko publicly accused Russian president Vladimir Putin of trying to make Belarus a part of Russia. This led to Russia cutting economic subsidies for Belarus. In July 2020, the relationship between Belarus and Russia was described as &quot;strained&quot; after 33 Russian military contractors were arrested in Minsk.

Lukashenko afterwards accused Russia of collaborating with opposition activist Siarhei Tsikhanouski and trying to cover up an attempt to send 200 fighters from a private Russian military firm known as the Wagner Group into Belarus on a mission to destabilize the country ahead of its 9 August presidential election. On 5 August 2020, Russia&#x27;s security chief Dmitry Medvedev warned Belarus to release the contractors. Lukashenko also claimed Russia was lying about its attempts to use the Wagner Group to influence the upcoming election.

On 11 November 2021, Lukashenko raised the possibility of interrupting the Yamal–Europe pipeline carrying Russian gas to the European Union if the bloc imposes further sanctions on Belarus. Putin said that Lukashenko had not consulted him before raising the possibility of stopping gas deliveries coming from Russia to the EU via a pipeline through Belarus, adding that such a move would risk harming ties between Belarus and Russia.

In February 2022, Lukashenko permitted Russian forces to stage part of the invasion of Ukraine from Belarusian territory. Commenting on the war in Ukraine Lukashenko has said that he didn&#x27;t expect the conflict “drag on this way.” In June 2023, Lukashenko claimed that &quot;the only mistake we made’ was not finishing off Ukraine with Russia in 2014&quot;. In August 2024, Lukashenko urged both Russia and Ukraine to start peace negotiations, saying in an interview with Russian state television: &quot;Neither the Ukrainian people, nor the Russians, nor the Belarusians need it. It’s them in the West, who need [the war].&quot; He accused the West of supporting Ukraine&#x27;s incursion into the Kursk region.

==== European Union ====
Lukashenko&#x27;s relationship with the EU has been strained, in part by choice and in part by his policies towards domestic opponents. Lukashenko&#x27;s repression of opponents caused him to be called &quot;Europe&#x27;s last dictator&quot; and resulted in the EU imposing visa sanctions on him and a range of Belarusian officials. At times, the EU has lifted sanctions as a way to encourage dialogue or gain concessions from Lukashenko. Since the EU adopted this policy of &quot;change through engagement&quot;, it has supported economic and political reforms to help integrate the Belarusian state.

After the EU sanctioned Belarus for its crackdown against the 2020 mass protests, Lukashenko advertised Belarus as an entry point for migrants to reach the EU, resulting in the Belarus–European Union border crisis.

==== United States ====
In March 2003, Lukashenko said that Belarus unanimously condemned the US-led Iraq War.

On 29 August 2019, John Bolton, then National Security Advisor of the United States, was received by Lukashenko during his visit to Minsk, which was the first of its kind in 18 years.

==== China ====
Under Lukashenko, China and Belarus have maintained close ties, with him advocating an approach of &quot;understanding China, learning from China, and approaching China.&quot; In 2012, the chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress Wu Bangguo noted that Belarus has been rapidly developing under Lukashenko. On 1 March 2023, Lukashenko met Chinese president Xi Jinping in Beijing, which produced a range of cooperation documents on industry, trade, agricultural, and other matters.

==== Middle East ====
Following the 2014 Syrian presidential election, President Lukashenko congratulated President Bashar al-Assad. His cable &quot;expressed keenness to strengthen and develop bilateral relations between Belarus and Syria in all fields for the benefit of the two peoples.&quot;

Belarus condemned the NATO-led military intervention in Libya, and the foreign ministry stated that &quot;the missile strikes and bombings on the territory of Libya go beyond Resolution 1973 of the UN Security Council and are in breach of its principal goal, ensuring safety of the civilian population. The Republic of Belarus calls on the states involved with the military operation to cease, with immediate effect, the military operations which lead to human casualties. The settlement of the conflict is an internal affair of Libya and should be carried out by the Libyan people alone without military intervention from outside.&quot; They did not recognize the National Transitional Council.

Upon hearing the news regarding the death of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, Alexander Lukashenko said that &quot;aggression has been committed, and the country&#x27;s leadership, not only Muammar Gaddafi, has been killed. And how was it killed? Well, if they had shot him in a battle, it&#x27;s one thing, but they humiliated and tormented him, they shot at him, they violated him when he was wounded, they twisted his neck and arms, and then they tortured him to death. It&#x27;s worse than the Nazis once did.&quot; He also condemned the current situation of Libya and was critical regarding the future of the country.

==== Others ====
His policies have been praised by some other world leaders. In response to a question about Belarus&#x27;s domestic policies, President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela said &quot;We see here a model social state like the one we are beginning to create.&quot; In 2015, Lukashenko sought to improve trade relations between Belarus and Latin America.

In March 2022, Australia sanctioned Lukashenko for giving &quot;strategic support to Russia and its military forces&quot; in the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Also in 2022, he was blacklisted by New Zealand and Japan on the same grounds.

In September 2023, Lukashenko, reacting to the 2023 North Korea–Russia summit, proposed a three-way cooperation pact with Russia and North Korea.

At the December 2024 summit of the Eurasian Economic Union, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan engaged in a heated argument with Lukashenko during a livestream attended by other EEU leaders after Pashinyan refused Lukashenko&#x27;s invitation to visit Belarus for the next EEU summit, citing Minsk&#x27;s support for Azerbaijan.

==Public life==
===Controversial statements===
Lukashenko has made several controversial statements during his presidency which have been regarded as antisemitic, homophobic and misogynistic.

In 1995, Lukashenko made a remark in which he named Adolf Hitler as a role model for his presidential system in Belarus: &quot;The history of Germany is a copy of the history of Belarus. Germany was raised from ruins thanks to firm authority and not everything connected with that well-known figure Hitler was bad. German order evolved over the centuries and attained its peak under Hitler. This corresponds with our understanding of a presidential republic and the role of a president in it.&quot; Lukashenko refused to take the quote back, but stated that the consequences of Hitler&#x27;s leadership style in foreign policy had been bad.

In October 2007, Lukashenko was accused of making antisemitic comments; addressing the &quot;miserable state of the city of Babruysk&quot; on a live broadcast on state radio, he stated: &quot;This is a Jewish city, and the Jews are not concerned for the place they live in. They have turned Babruysk into a pigsty. Look at Israel—I was there and saw it myself ... I call on Jews who have money to come back to Babruysk.&quot; Members of the US House of Representatives sent a letter to the Belarusian ambassador to the US, Mikhail Khvostov, addressing Lukashenko&#x27;s comments with a strong request to retract them, and the comments also caused a negative reaction from Israel.

Consequently, Pavel Yakubovich, editor of &quot;Belarus Today&quot;, was sent to Israel, and in a meeting with the Israel Foreign Ministry said that Lukashenko&#x27;s comment was &quot;a mistake that was said jokingly, and does not represent his positions regarding the Jewish people&quot; and that he was &quot;anything but anti-Semitic,&quot; and had been &quot;insulted by the mere accusation.&quot; The Belarusian Ambassador to Israel, Igor Leshchenya, stated that the president had a &quot;kind attitude toward the Jewish people&quot;, and Sergei Rychenko, the press secretary at the Belarusian Embassy in Tel Aviv, said parts of Lukashenko&#x27;s comments had been mistranslated.

On 4 March 2012, two days after EU leaders (including openly gay German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle) had called for new measures to pressure Lukashenko over alleged human rights abuses in Belarus at a summit in Brussels, Lukashenko provoked diplomatic rebuke from Germany after commenting that it was &quot;better to be a dictator than gay&quot; in response to Westerwelle having referred to him as &quot;Europe&#x27;s last dictator&quot; during the meeting.

After some of the initial candidates for the 2020 Belarusian presidential election were imprisoned, three women involved with the candidates, led by Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya emerged as leading opposition against him and contested the results of the election. Lukashenko has spoken dismissively about the role of women in Belarusian society, saying that &quot;society is not mature enough to vote for a woman&quot; and, referring specifically to Tsikanouskaya, that &quot;she just cooked a tasty cutlet, maybe fed the children, and the cutlet smelled nice [...] And now there&#x27;s supposed to be a debate about some issues&quot; and that the burden of the presidency would cause her to &quot;collapse, poor thing&quot;.

In July 2021, Lukashenko was accused of making antisemitic comments during his Independence Day speech to the armed forces; saying &quot;the Jews managed to force the world to remember the Holocaust. The entire world grovels before them and gives in to them. They are afraid to say a single word out of place&quot; and adding &quot;We are tolerant and likeable. We left things alone until it got to the point where others started attacking us and the memory of our efforts.&quot; The Israeli government said the comments were &quot;unacceptable&quot; and summoned the chargé d&#x27;affaires at the Belarus embassy in Israel.
===Public opinion===
Independent polling is tightly restricted in Belarus. Surveys are monopolized by the government, which either does not publish its surveys or uses them for propagandistic purposes.

According to a leaked internal poll, a third of the population had trust in Lukashenko. The last credible public poll in Belarus was a 2016 poll showing approximately 30% approval for Lukashenko.

Lukashenko is referred to as &quot;Batska&quot; (, &quot;father&quot;) by his supporters.

During the 2020–21 Belarusian protests, opponents of Lukashenko began to refer to him as &quot;Sasha 3%&quot; on the basis that they believed that he was only supported by three percent of the Belarusian population. The term has subsequently become a popular meme within the Belarusian opposition appearing on T-shirts and posters. Lukashenko has also been referred to as &quot;Tarakanishche&quot; (&quot;Cockroach&quot;) by his opponents in reference to the poem &quot;The Monster Cockroach&quot;, in which a moustached cockroach inflicts a reign of terror on the other animals before being eaten by a sparrow.

===Accusations of corruption===
A film produced by Nexta, a Belarusian media service based in Poland, accuses Lukashenko of misappropriating EU funds on residences and automobiles. The film was uploaded to Telegram and YouTube, where it had over 6 million views. Lukashenko did not comment on the film directly, but on a factory visit in March 2021 claimed that opponents were creating a fake story to destabilize the country. Lukashenko states &quot;I want you to understand: I have been working as president for a quarter of a century, and if there were already some billions, as they say, or palaces, I would have already been torn to pieces from all sides.&quot; An EU official, Ana Pisonero, said that accusations of Lukashenko misusing EU funds for buildings and residential properties were &quot;speculation&quot;.

==Personal life==
===Marriage and children===
Lukashenko married Galina Zhelnerovich, his high school sweetheart, in 1975. Later that year, his oldest son, Viktor, was born. Their second son, Dmitry, was born in 1980. Galina lives separately in a house in the village Shklow. Though they are still legally married, Galina Lukashenko has been estranged from her husband since shortly after he became president. In a 2014 interview, Lukashenko said that they had not lived together for 30 years and the only reason they had not divorced was that he did not want to traumatize his adult sons. Lukashenko has been seen on public occasions with various women; when asked about this in the same 2014 interview he explained that he did not want to sit with an official with a &quot;sour face&quot;, preferring &quot;My son on one side, and a girl on the other&quot;.

Lukashenko fathered a son, Nikolai, who was born in 2004. Though never confirmed by the government, it is widely believed that Nikolai&#x27;s mother is Irina Abelskaya—the two had an extramarital affair when she was Lukashenko&#x27;s personal doctor. There has never been any public statement about who Nikolai&#x27;s mother is; Nikolai was raised solely by his father. It has been reported by Western observers and media that Nikolai, nicknamed &quot;Kolya&quot;, is being groomed as Lukashenko&#x27;s successor. According to Belarusian state media, these speculations were dismissed by Lukashenko, who also denied that he would remain in office for a further thirty years—the time Nikolai will become eligible to stand for election and succeed him. Lukashenko has a pet dog, a spitz named Umka.

===Sports===
Lukashenko used to play football, but stopped playing during his presidency. His two elder sons also play ice hockey, sometimes alongside their father. Lukashenko started training in cross-country running as a child, and in the 2000s still competed at the national level. He is a keen skier and ice hockey forward. In an interview he said that he plays ice hockey three times a week. He has established the Belarus President&#x27;s team, an amateur team which he sometimes plays for. Numerous ice rinks intended to enable competitive ice hockey games to be played, have been built all over Belarus at Lukashenko&#x27;s behest. Lukashenko was instrumental in getting the 2014 IIHF World Championship in ice hockey to be hosted by Belarus which was considered controversial due to Lukashenko&#x27;s repressive regime. Belarus was supposed to host the 2021 IIHF World Championship in May 2021, but that was cancelled after international condemnation and threats by sponsors to withdraw.

===Religion and beliefs===
Lukashenko describes himself as an &quot;Orthodox atheist&quot; and has said that he believes that a president should be a conservative person and avoid using modern electronic technology such as a tablet or smartphone. He used to play the bayan, a musical instrument similar to an accordion.

<text>A Scientologist is an adherent of the doctrines and beliefs of Scientology. Some adherents of the belief system of Scientology practice independently in what is often referred to as free zone Scientology. The Church of Scientology organization claims &quot;SCIENTOLOGIST is a collective membership mark indicating membership in a church and church membership services of the affiliated Scientology churches and missions.&quot;

Scientologists not in trouble with the ethics department are considered &quot;in good standing&quot; and are allowed to be on Church of Scientology premises, receive services, and attend events.

== Members ==

Public Scientologists are those individuals who are &quot;not&quot; staff. They pay the Church of Scientology for training or auditing services, and live and work independent of the organization. Collectively, non-staff Scientologists may be referred to as &quot;members&quot;, the &quot;public&quot;, or the &quot;field&quot;.

Even though public members are not employed by the organization, they are ranked within the entire chain of command and defer to all staff personnel, who are seen as their seniors. Members are frequently pressed into service for clerical or promotional tasks or to recruit new members. Members who recruit people for Scientology services are called &quot;field staff members&quot; (FSM) and are paid a commission of 10%–15% of the amount their recruit pays for a service.

<text>A puppeteer is a person who manipulates an inanimate object called a puppet to create the illusion that the puppet is alive. The puppet is often shaped like a human, animal, or legendary creature. The puppeteer may be visible to or hidden from the audience.

==Description==
Performing as a puppeteer can be physically demanding. A puppeteer can operate a puppet indirectly by the use of strings, rods, wires, electronics or directly by their own hands placed inside the puppet or holding it externally or any other part of the body- such as the legs. Some puppet styles require two or more puppeteers to work together to create a single puppet character.

The puppeteer&#x27;s role is to manipulate the physical object in such a manner that the audience believes the object is imbued with life. In some instances, the persona of the puppeteer is also an important feature, as with ventriloquist&#x27;s dummy performers, in which the puppeteer and the human figure-styled puppet appear onstage together, and in theatre shows like &quot;Avenue Q&quot;.

The puppeteer might speak in the role of the puppet&#x27;s character, synchronising the movements of the puppet&#x27;s mouth. However, there is much puppetry which does not use the moving mouth (which is a lip-sync innovation created originally for television where close-ups are popular). Often, in theatre, a moveable mouth is used only for gestural expression, or speech might be produced by a non-moving mouth. In traditional glove puppetry often one puppeteer will operate two puppets at a time out of a cast of several. Much work is produced without any speech at all with all the emphasis on movement.

In a shadow play, only the shadows of the puppet are seen on a screen positioned between the puppets and the audience.

The relationship between the puppeteer and the puppet-maker is similar to that between an actor and a playwright, in cases where a puppet-maker designs a puppet for a puppeteer. Very often, though, the puppeteer assumes the joint roles of puppet-maker, director, designer, writer and performer. In this case a puppeteer is a more complete theatre practitioner than is the case with other theatre forms, in which one person writes a play, another person directs it, and then actors perform the lines and gestures.

Puppetry is a complex medium sometimes consisting of live performance, sometimes contributing to stop frame puppet animation, and film where performances might be technically processed as motion capture, CGI or as virtual puppetry.

<text>Puppetry is a form of theatre or performance that involves the manipulation of puppets – objects, often resembling some type of human or animal figure, that are animated or manipulated by a human called a puppeteer. Such a performance is also known as a puppet production. The script for a puppet production is called a puppet play. Puppeteers use movements from hands and arms to control devices such as rods or strings to move the body, head, limbs, and in some cases the mouth and eyes of the puppet. The puppeteer sometimes speaks in the voice of the character of the puppet, while at other times they perform to a recorded soundtrack.

There are many different varieties of puppets, and they are made of a wide range of materials, depending on their form and intended use. They can be extremely complex or very simple in their construction. The simplest puppets are finger puppets, which are tiny puppets that fit onto a single finger, and sock puppets, which are formed from a sock and operated by inserting one&#x27;s hand inside the sock, with the opening and closing of the hand simulating the movement of the puppet&#x27;s &quot;mouth&quot;. A hand puppet or glove puppet is controlled by one hand which occupies the interior of the puppet and moves the puppet around. Punch and Judy puppets are familiar examples. Other hand or glove puppets are larger and require two puppeteers for each puppet. Japanese Bunraku puppets are an example of this. Marionettes are suspended and controlled by a number of strings, plus sometimes a central rod attached to a control bar held from above by the puppeteer. Rod puppets are made from a head attached to a central rod. Over the rod is a body form with arms attached controlled by separate rods. They have more movement possibilities as a consequence than a simple hand or glove puppet.

Puppetry is a very ancient form of theatre which was first recorded in the 5th century BC in Ancient Greece. Some forms of puppetry may have originated as long ago as 3000 years BC. Puppetry takes many forms, but they all share the process of animating inanimate performing objects to tell a story. Puppetry occurs in almost all human societies where puppets are used for the purpose of entertainment through performance, as sacred objects in rituals, as symbolic effigies in celebrations such as carnivals, and as a catalyst for social and psychological change in transformative arts.
==History==

Puppetry is a very ancient art form, thought to have originated about 4000 years ago. Puppets have been used since the earliest times to animate and communicate the ideas and needs of human societies. Some historians claim that they pre-date actors in theatre. There is evidence that they were used in Egypt as early as 2000 BCE when string-operated figures of wood were manipulated to perform the action of kneading bread. Wire controlled, articulated puppets made of clay and ivory have also been found in Egyptian tombs. Hieroglyphs also describe &quot;walking statues&quot; being used in ancient Egyptian religious dramas. Puppetry was practiced in ancient Greece and the oldest written records of puppetry can be found in the works of Herodotus and Xenophon, dating from the 5th century BC.

===Africa===
Sub-Saharan Africa may have inherited some of the puppet traditions of ancient Egypt. Certainly, secret societies in many African ethnic groups still use puppets (and masks) in ritual dramas as well as in their healing and hunting ceremonies. Today, puppetry continues as a popular form, often within a ceremonial context, and as part of a wide range of folk forms including dance, storytelling, and masked performance. In the 2010s throughout rural Africa, puppetry still performed the function of transmitting cultural values and ideas that in large African cities is increasingly undertaken by formal education, books, cinema, and television.

=== Asia ===

====East Asia====

There is evidence for puppetry in the Indus Valley civilization. Archaeologists have unearthed one terracotta doll with a detachable head capable of manipulation by a string dating to 2500 BC. Another figure is a terracotta monkey which could be manipulated up and down a stick, achieving minimum animation in both cases. Puppets are described in the epic &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, Tamil literature from the Sangam era, and various literary works dating from the late centuries BC to the early centuries AD, including the Edicts of Ashoka. Works like the &quot;Natya Shastra&quot; and the &quot;Kama Sutra&quot; elaborate on puppetry in some detail.

China has a history of puppetry dating back 3000 years, originally in &quot;pi-yung xi&quot;, the &quot;theatre of the lantern shadows&quot;, or as it is more commonly known today, Chinese shadow theatre. By the Song dynasty (960–1279 AD), puppets played to all social classes including the courts, yet puppeteers, as in Europe, were considered to be from a lower social stratum.
In Taiwan, budaixi puppet shows, somewhat similar to the Japanese bunraku, occur with puppeteers working in the background or underground. Some very experienced puppeteers can manipulate their puppets to perform various stunts, for example, somersaults in the air.

Japan has many forms of puppetry, including the bunraku. Bunraku developed out of Shinto temple rites and gradually became a highly sophisticated form of puppetry. Chikamatsu Monzaemon, considered by many to be Japan&#x27;s greatest playwright, gave up writing kabuki plays and focused exclusively on the puppet-only bunraku plays. Initially consisting of one puppeteer, by 1730 three puppeteers were used to operate each puppet in full view of the audience. The puppeteers, who dressed all in black, would become invisible when standing against a black background, while the torches illuminated only the carved, painted and costumed wooden puppets.
Korea&#x27;s tradition of puppetry is thought to have come from China. The oldest historical evidence of puppetry in Korea comes from a letter written in 982 A.D. from Choe Seung-roe to the King. In Korean, the word for puppet is &quot;Kkoktugakshi&quot;. &quot;Gagsi&quot; means a &quot;bride&quot; or a &quot;young woman&quot;, which was the most common form the dolls took. A kkoktugakshi puppet play has eight scenes.

====Southeast Asia====

The Indonesian &quot;wayang&quot; theater was influenced by Indian traditions. Some scholars trace the origin of puppets to India 4000 years ago, where the main character in Sanskrit plays was known as &quot;Sutradhara&quot;, &quot;the holder of strings&quot;. &quot;Wayang&quot; is a strong tradition of puppetry native to Indonesia, especially in Java and Bali. In Java, &quot;wayang kulit&quot;, an elaborate form of shadow puppetry, is very popular. Javanese rod puppets have a long history and are used to tell fables from Javanese history. Another popular puppetry form in Indonesia is &quot;wayang golek&quot;.

Thailand has &quot;hun krabok&quot;, a popular form of rod puppet theatre.

Vietnam developed the art form of water puppetry, unique to that country. The puppets are built out of wood and the shows are performed in a waist-high pool. A large rod under the water is used by puppeteers to support and control the puppets, creating the appearance of the puppets moving over water. The origin of this form of puppetry dates back seven hundred years when the rice fields would flood and the villagers would entertain each other. Puppet show competitions between Vietnamese villages eventually led to the creation of secretive and exclusive puppet societies.

The Philippines first developed its art of puppetry during the Spanish colonial period. The oldest known Filipino puppetry is the &quot;carrillo&quot;, also known as &quot;kikimut&quot;, &quot;titire&quot;, and &quot;potei&quot;. It was first recorded in 1879. It involves small carts used in puppet plays with figures made of cardboard utilized for shadow plays. In the late 1800s, another Filipino puppetry developed. &quot;Higantes&quot; are giant papier-mâché puppets, numbering more than a hundred, paraded through town during the Higantes Festival. These puppets are made as a devotion to San Clemente and as a mockery against colonial-era land owners who discriminated Filipinos. Various traditions are connected with the &quot;higantes&quot;. Since the 20th century, multiple puppet arts have developed in the Philippines. A notable Filipino puppeteer is Amelia Lapeña Bonifacio.

In Burma, today called Myanmar, an elaborate form of puppet shows, called Yoke thé, evolved, based on royal patronage. The probable date of the origin of Burmese marionettes is given as around 1780, during the reign of King Singu Min, and their introduction is credited to the Minister of Royal Entertainment, U Thaw. From their inception, marionettes enjoyed great popularity in the courts of the Konbaung dynasty. Little has changed since the creation of the art by U Thaw, and the set of characters developed by him is still in use today.
====India====

India has a long tradition of puppetry. In the ancient Indian epic &quot;Mahabharata&quot; there are references to puppets. Another ancient reference to puppetry is found in Tamil classic ‘Silappadikaaram’ written around 1st or 2nd century B.C. Kathputli, a form of string puppet performance native to Rajasthan, is notable and there are many Indian ventriloquists and puppeteers. The first Indian ventriloquist, Professor Y. K. Padhye, introduced this form of puppetry to India in the 1920s and his son, Ramdas Padhye, subsequently popularised ventriloquism and puppetry. Almost all types of puppets are found in India.

;String puppets

India has a rich and ancient tradition of string puppets or marionettes. Marionettes with jointed limbs controlled by strings allow far greater flexibility and are therefore the most articulate of the puppets. Rajasthan, Orissa, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu are some of the regions where this form of puppetry has flourished. The traditional marionettes of Rajasthan are known as &quot;Kathputli&quot;. Carved from a single piece of wood, these puppets are like large dolls that are colourfully dressed. The string puppets of Orissa are known as &quot;Kundhei&quot;. The string puppets of Karnataka are called &quot;Gombeyatta&quot;. Puppets from Tamil Nadu, known as &quot;Bommalattam&quot;, combine the techniques of rod and string puppets.

;Shadow Puppets

Shadow puppets are an ancient part of India&#x27;s culture and art, particularly regionally as the &quot;keelu bomme&quot; and &quot;Tholu bommalata&quot; of Andhra Pradesh, the &quot;Togalu gombeyaata&quot; in Karnataka, the &quot;charma bahuli natya&quot; in Maharashtra, the &quot;Ravana chhaya&quot; in Odisha, the &quot;Tholpavakoothu&quot; in Kerala and the &quot;thol bommalatta&quot; in Tamil Nadu. Shadow puppet play is also found in pictorial traditions in India, such as temple mural painting, loose-leaf folio paintings, and the narrative paintings. Dance forms such as the Chhau of Odisha literally mean &quot;shadow&quot;. The shadow theatre dance drama theatre are usually performed on platform stages attached to Hindu temples, and in some regions these are called &quot;Koothu Madams&quot; or &quot;Koothambalams&quot;. In many regions, the puppet drama play is performed by itinerant artist families on temporary stages during major temple festivals. Legends from the Hindu epics &quot;Ramayana&quot; and the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; dominate their repertoire. However, the details and the stories vary regionally.

During the 19th century and early parts of the 20th century of the colonial era, Indologists believed that shadow puppet plays had become extinct in India, though mentioned in its ancient Sanskrit texts. In the 1930s and thereafter, states Stuart Blackburn, these fears of its extinction were found to be false as evidence emerged that shadow puppetry had remained a vigorous rural tradition in central Kerala mountains, most of Karnataka, northern Andhra Pradesh, parts of Tamil Nadu, Odisha and southern Maharashtra. The Marathi people, particularly of low caste, had preserved and vigorously performed the legends of Hindu epics as a folk tradition. The importance of Marathi artists is evidenced, states Blackburn, from the puppeteers speaking Marathi as their mother tongue in many non-Marathi speaking states of India.
According to Beth Osnes, the &quot;tholu bommalata&quot; shadow puppet theatre dates back to the 3rd century BCE, and has attracted patronage ever since. The puppets used in a &quot;tholu bommalata&quot; performance, states Phyllis Dircks, are &quot;translucent, lusciously multicolored leather figures four to five feet tall, and feature one or two articulated arms&quot;. The process of making the puppets is an elaborate ritual, where the artist families in India pray, go into seclusion, produce the required art work, then celebrate the &quot;metaphorical birth of a puppet&quot; with flowers and incense.

The &quot;tholu pava koothu&quot; of Kerala uses leather puppets whose images are projected on a backlit screen. The shadows are used to creatively express characters and stories in the &quot;Ramayana&quot;. A complete performance of the epic can take forty-one nights, while an abridged performance lasts as few as seven days. One feature of the &quot;tholu pava koothu&quot; show is that it is a team performance of puppeteers, while other shadow plays such as the &quot;wayang&quot; of Indonesia are performed by a single puppeteer for the same &quot;Ramayana&quot; story. There are regional differences within India in the puppet arts. For example, women play a major role in shadow play theatre in most parts of India, except in Kerala and Maharashtra. Almost everywhere, except Odisha, the puppets are made from tanned deer skin, painted and articulated. Translucent leather puppets are typical in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, while opaque puppets are typical in Kerala and Odisha. The artist troupes typically carry over a hundred puppets for their performance in rural India.
;Rod puppets
Rod puppets are an extension of glove-puppets, but are often much larger and supported and manipulated by rods from below. This form of puppetry now is found mostly in West Bengal and Orissa. The traditional rod puppet form of West Bengal is known as &quot;Putul Nautch&quot;. They are carved from wood and follow the various artistic styles of a particular region. The traditional rod puppet of Bihar is known as &quot;Yampuri&quot;.

;Glove puppets
Glove puppets are also known as sleeve, hand or palm puppets. The head is made of either papier mâché, cloth or wood, with two hands emerging from just below the neck. The rest of the figure consists of a long, flowing skirt. These puppets are like limp dolls, but in the hands of an able puppeteer, are capable of producing a wide range of movements. The manipulation technique is simple the movements are controlled by the human hand, the first finger inserted in the head and the middle finger and the thumb in the two arms of the puppet. With the help of these three fingers, the glove puppet comes alive.

The tradition of glove puppets in India is popular in Uttar Pradesh, Orissa, West Bengal and Kerala. In Uttar Pradesh, glove puppet plays usually present social themes, whereas in Orissa such plays are based on stories of Radha and Krishna. In Orissa, the puppeteer plays a &quot;dholak&quot; (hand drum) with one hand and manipulates the puppet with the other. The delivery of the dialogue, the movement of the puppet and the beat of the dholak are well synchronised and create a dramatic atmosphere. In Kerala, the traditional glove puppet play is called &quot;Pavakoothu&quot;.

====Afghanistan====
Afghanistan has produced a form of puppetry known as buz-baz. During a performance a puppeteer will simultaneously operate a marionette of a markhor while playing a dambura (long-necked lute).

===West Asia===

Middle Eastern puppetry, like its other theatre forms, is influenced by the Islamic culture. Karagoz, the Turkish Shadow Theatre, has widely influenced puppetry in the region and it is thought to have passed from China by way of India. Later, it was taken by the Mongols from the Chinese and passed to the Turkish peoples of Central Asia. The art of Shadow Theater was brought to Anatolia by the Turkish people emigrating from Central Asia. Other scholars claim that shadow theater came to Anatolia in the 16th century from Egypt. The advocates of this view claim that shadow theatre found its way into the Ottoman palaces when Yavuz Sultan Selim conquered Egypt in 1517. He saw shadow theatre performed during a party in his honour and he was said to be so impressed with it that he took the puppeteer back to his palace in Istanbul where his 21-year -old son, later Sultan Suleyman the Magnificent, developed an interest in the plays.

In other areas, the style of shadow puppetry known as &quot;khayal al-zill&quot;, a metaphor translated as &quot;shadows of the imagination&quot; or &quot;shadow of fancy&quot;, still survives. This is a shadow play with live music, &quot;the accompaniment of drums, tambourines and flutes...also...&quot;special effects&quot; – smoke, fire, thunder, rattles, squeaks, thumps, and whatever else might elicit a laugh or a shudder from his audience&quot;

In Iran, puppets are known to have existed much earlier than 1000 AD, but initially only glove and string puppets were popular . Other genres of puppetry emerged during the Qajar era (18th and 19th centuries) as influences from Turkey spread to the region. &quot;Kheimeh Shab-Bazi&quot; is a traditional Persian puppet show which is performed in a small chamber by a musical performer and a storyteller called a &quot;morshed&quot; or &quot;naghal&quot;. These shows often take place alongside storytelling in traditional tea and coffee-houses (&quot;Ghahve-Khane&quot;). The dialogue takes place between the morshed and the puppets. A recent example of puppetry in Iran is the touring opera &quot;Rostam and Sohrab&quot;.

===Europe===
====Ancient Greece and Rome====

Although there are few remaining examples of puppets from ancient Greece, historical literature and archaeological findings shows the existence of puppetry. The Greek word translated as &quot;puppet&quot; is &quot;νευρόσπαστος&quot; (&quot;nevrospastos&quot;), which literally means &quot;drawn by strings, string-pulling&quot;, from &quot;νεῦρον&quot; (&quot;nevron&quot;), meaning either &quot;sinew, tendon, muscle, string&quot;, or &quot;wire&quot;, and &quot;σπάω&quot; (&quot;spaō&quot;), meaning &quot;draw, pull&quot;. Aristotle referred to pulling strings to control heads, hands and eyes, shoulders and legs. Plato&#x27;s work also contains references to puppetry. The &quot;Iliad&quot; and the &quot;Odyssey&quot; were presented using puppetry. The roots of European puppetry probably extend back to the Greek plays with puppets played to the &quot;common people&quot; in the 5th century BC. By the 3rd century BC these plays would appear in the Theatre of Dionysus at the Acropolis.

In ancient Greece and ancient Rome clay dolls, and a few of ivory, dated from around 500 BC, were found in children&#x27;s tombs. These dolls had articulated arms and legs, and in some cases an iron rod extending up from the tops of their heads. This rod was used to manipulate the doll from above, as it is done today in Sicilian puppetry. A few of these dolls had strings in place of rods. Some researchers believe these ancient figures were simply toys and not puppets, due to their small size.

====Italy====
;Middle Ages and Renaissance

Italy is considered by many to be the early home of the marionette due to the influence of Roman puppetry. Xenophon and Plutarch refer to them. The Christian church used marionettes to perform morality plays. It is believed that the word marionette originates from the little figures of the Virgin Mary, hence the word &quot;marionette&quot; or &quot;Mary doll. Comedy was introduced to the plays as time went by, and ultimately led to a church edict banning puppetry. Puppeteers responded by setting up stages outside cathedrals and became even more ribald and slapstick. Out of this grew the Italian comedy called Commedia dell&#x27;arte. Puppets were used at times in this form of theatre and sometimes Shakespeare&#x27;s plays were performed using marionettes instead of actors. An early depiction of a puppet show within a (shown right) illustrates fol. 54v of &quot;Li romans du boin roi Alixandre&quot; (&#x27;The Romance of the Good King Alexander&#x27;), a Flemish manuscript illuminated by the workshop of Jehan de Grise between 1338 and 1344.

In Sicily, the sides of donkey carts are decorated with intricate, painted scenes from the Frankish romantic poems, such as &quot;The Song of Roland&quot;. These same tales are enacted in traditional puppet theatres featuring hand-made marionettes of wood. In Sicilian this is called &quot;Opera dei pupi&quot;, or &quot;Opera of the puppets&quot;. The &quot;Opera dei pupi&quot; and the Sicilian tradition of cantastorie, the word for storyteller, are rooted in the Provençal troubadour tradition, in Sicily during the reign of Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, in the first half of the 13th century.

;18th and 19th centuries
The 18th century was a vital period in the development of all Italian theatre, including the marionette theatre. The rod puppet was mainly of lower-class origin, but the marionette theatre was popular in aristocratic circles, as a celebration of the Age of Enlightenment. The effects, and the artful and complex construction of the puppets, the puppet theatres, and the puppet narratives, were all popular, particularly in Venice. In the 19th century, the marionettes of Pietro Radillo became more complex and instead of just the rod and two strings, Radillo&#x27;s marionettes were controlled by as many as eight strings, which increased control over the individual body parts of the marionettes.

====France====
Guignol is the main character in the French puppet show which has come to bear his name. Although often thought of as children&#x27;s entertainment, Guignol&#x27;s sharp wit and linguistic verve have always been appreciated by adults as well, as shown by the motto of a prominent Lyon troupe: &quot;Guignol amuses children… and witty adults&quot;. Laurent Mourguet, Guignol&#x27;s creator, fell on hard times during the French Revolution, and in 1797 started to practice dentistry, which in those days was simply the pulling of teeth. To attract patients, he started setting up a puppet show in front of his dentist&#x27;s chair.
His first shows featured Polichinelle, a character borrowed from the Italian commedia dell&#x27;arte. By 1804 the success was such that he gave up dentistry altogether and became a professional puppeteer, creating his own scenarios drawing on the concerns of his working-class audience and improvising references to the news of the day. He developed characters closer to the daily lives of his Lyon audience, first Gnafron, a wine-loving cobbler, and in 1808 Guignol. Other characters, including Guignol&#x27;s wife Madelon and the gendarme Flagéolet soon followed, but these are never much more than foils for the two heroes. Guignol&#x27;s inevitable victory is always the triumph of good over evil.

====Great Britain====

The traditional British &quot;Punch and Judy&quot; puppetry traces its roots to the 16th century to the Italian commedia dell&#x27;arte. The character of &quot;Punch&quot; derives from the character Pulcinella, which was Anglicized to &quot;Punchinello&quot;. He is a manifestation of the Lord of Misrule and Trickster, figures of deep-rooted mythologies. Punch&#x27;s wife was originally &quot;Joan&quot;, but later became &quot;Judy&quot;. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the familiar &quot;Punch and Judy&quot; puppet show which existed in Britain was performed in an easily transportable booth. The British Puppet and Model Theatre Guild in the early 20th century instigated a resurgence of puppetry. Two of the Guild&#x27;s founders, H. W. Whanslaw and Waldo Lanchester, both worked to promote and develop puppetry with publications of books and literature, mainly focusing on the art of the marionette. Lanchester had a touring theatre and a permanent venue in Malvern, Worcestershire, regularly taking part in the Malvern Festival and attracting the attention of George Bernard Shaw. One of Shaw&#x27;s last plays, &quot;Shakes versus Shav&quot;, was written for and first performed in 1949 by the company.

From 1957 to 1969, Gerry Anderson produced many television series starring marionettes, starting with Roberta Leigh&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures of Twizzle&quot; and ending with &quot;The Secret Service&quot;. Many of these series (the most famous of which was &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;) employed a technique called Supermarionation, which automatically synchronized the pre-recorded character dialogue to the puppets&#x27; mouth movements. Anderson returned to puppetry in 1983 with &quot;Terrahawks&quot; and the unaired pilot &quot;Space Police&quot; in 1987.

Current British puppetry theatres include the Little Angel Theatre in Islington, London, Puppet Theatre Barge in London, Norwich Puppet Theatre, the Harlequin Puppet Theatre, Rhos-on-Sea, Wales, and the Biggar Puppet Theatre, Biggar, Lanarkshire, Scotland. British puppetry now covers a wide range of styles and approaches. There are also a number of British theatre companies, including Horse and Bamboo Theatre, and Green Ginger, which integrate puppetry into highly visual productions. From 1984 to 1996, puppetry was used as a vehicle for political satire in the British television series &quot;Spitting Image&quot;. Puppetry has also been influencing mainstream theatre, and several recent productions combine puppetry with live action, including &quot;Warhorse&quot;, at the Royal National Theatre and &quot;Madam Butterfly&quot; at the English National Opera.

====Netherlands, Denmark, Romania, and Russia====
Many regional variants of Pulcinella were developed as the character spread across Europe. In the Netherlands it is &quot;Jan Klaassen&quot; (and Judy is &quot;Katrijn&quot;); in Denmark &quot;Mester Jackel&quot;; in Russia &quot;Petrushka&quot;; and in Romania &quot;Vasilache&quot;. In Russia, the Central Puppet Theatre in Moscow and its branches in every part of the country enhanced the reputation of the puppeteer and puppetry in general.
====Germany and Austria====
There is a long tradition of puppetry in Germany and Austria. Much of it derives from the 16th-century tradition of the Italian commedia dell&#x27;arte. The German version of the British character of &#x27;Punch&#x27; is called Kasperle of Kaspar while Judy is called Grete. In the 18th century, operas were specifically composed for marionette puppets. Gluck, Haydn, de Falla and Respighi all composed adult operas for marionettes.

In 1855, Count Franz Pocci founded the Munich Marionette Theatre. A German dramatist, poet, painter and composer, Pocci wrote 40 puppet plays for his theatre. Albrecht Roser has made a considerable impact with his marionettes in Stuttgart. His characters &quot;Clown Gustaf&quot; and &quot;Grandmother&quot; are well-known. &quot;Grandmother&quot;, while outwardly charming, is savagely humorous in her observations about all aspects of society and the absurdities of life.

In Lindau, the Lindau Marionette Opera was founded in 2000 by Bernard Leismueller and Ralf Hechelmann. The company performs a large number of operas as well as a marionette ballet, &quot;Swan Lake&quot;.

In Augsburg, the historic Augsburg Marionette Theatre was founded in 1943 by Walter Oehmichen. It continues to this day along with an adjoining puppet museum under the grandsons of the founder, Klaus Marschall and Juergen Marschall.

Much earlier in nearby Salzburg, Austria, the Salzburg Marionette Theatre was founded in 1913 by Professor Anton Aicher and is world-famous. The Salzburg Marionette Theatre still continues the tradition of presenting full-length opera using marionettes in their own purpose built theatre until recently under the direction of Gretl Aicher. It performs mainly operas such as &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot; and &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; and a small number of ballets such as &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;. The Salzburg Marionette Theatre productions are aimed for adults although children are of course welcome.

There is also a marionette theatre at Schoenbrunn Palace in Vienna founded by Christine Hierzer-Riedler and Werner Hierzer over 40 years ago. The marionette theatre performs world famous operas, musicals and fairy tales.

====Czech Republic and Slovakia====
Marionette puppet theatre has had a very long history in entertainment in Prague, and elsewhere in the former Czechoslovakia and then in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. It can be traced deep into the early part of the Middle Ages. Marionettes first appeared around the time of the Thirty Years&#x27; War. The first noted Czech puppeteer was Jan Jiří Brat, who was born in 1724. He was the son of a local carpenter and created his own puppet theatre. Matěj Kopecký was the most famous 19th-century Czech puppeteer, and was responsible for communicating the ideas of national awareness.

In 1911, Jindřich Veselý co-founded the Czech Association of Friends of Puppet Theatre and in 1912 advocated the publication of the oldest specialist puppet-theatre magazine still published today, &quot;Loutkář&quot;. Veselý played a key role in founding UNIMA (International Puppetry Association) in 1929, and was elected its first president.

In 1920 and 1926 respectively, Josef Skupa created his most famous puppet characters: Spejbl and Hurvínek, comical father and his rascal son. In 1930, he set up the first modern professional puppet theatre. An important puppet organisation is the National Marionette Theatre in Prague. Its repertoire mainly features a marionette production of Mozart&#x27;s opera &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;. The production has period costumes and 18th-century setting. There are numerous other companies, including Buchty a Loutky (&quot;Cakes and Puppets&quot;), founded by Marek Bečka. Puppets have been used extensively in animated films since 1946. Jiří Trnka was an acknowledged leader in this area. Miroslav Trejtnar is a master puppeteer and teacher of traditional Czech marionette-making skills.

In 2016, Czech and Slovak Puppetry was included on the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists.

====19th century====
Throughout this period, puppetry developed separately from the emerging mainstream of actor theatres, and the &#x27;ragged&#x27; puppeteers performed outside of theatre buildings at fairs, markets etc., continuing to be classified along with bandits and gypsies. In the 19th century, puppetry faced competition from other forms of theatre such as vaudeville and music hall, but it adapted to these challenges, for example: by developing stage acts and participating in the new forms of popular theatre, or reinventing itself in other ways and finding audiences at the newly fashionable seaside resorts.

===North America===
The Teotihuacan culture (Central Mexico) of 600 AD made figurines with moveable arms and legs as part of their funerary rites. Native Americans also used ceremonial puppets.
In 1519, two puppeteers accompanied Hernando Cortez on his first journey to Mexico. Europeans brought their own puppet traditions with them, but gradually distinctive styles, forms and puppet characters developed in North America.

During the Depression, folk puppeteers traveled with carnivals, working with their own scripts and with dioramas and marionettes of their own manufacture.

Some advances in 20th-century puppetry have originated in the United States. Marionette puppetry was combined with television as early as the 1940s, with Howdy Doody of the United States being a notable marionette in this field. Bil Baird worked on revitalising marionette theatre and puppetry in the United States. He and his wife, Cora Eisenberg, had their own marionette theatre in New York. Ventriloquist, Edgar Bergen also made a major contribution. In the 1960s Peter Schumann&#x27;s Bread and Puppet Theater developed the political and artistic possibilities of puppet theatre in a distinctive, powerful and immediately recognizable way. At roughly the same time, Jim Henson was creating a type of soft, foam-rubber and cloth puppet which became known collectively as Muppets. Initially, through the children&#x27;s television show &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, and later in &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; and on film, these inspired many imitators and are today are recognised almost everywhere (Henson also branched out into animatronics through the formation of his Creature Shop, as showcased in his films &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot; and &quot;Labyrinth&quot;). Wayland Flowers also made a major contribution to adult puppetry with his satirical puppet, Madame.

Sid and Marty Krofft are two of Americas most well known puppeteers and were mainly known for their live action children&#x27;s TV series in the 60s and 70s namely HR Pufnstuf and Lidsville.

Puppets also have been used in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; films, notably with the character of Yoda. His voice and manipulation was provided by Frank Oz.

===Australia===
The Aboriginal peoples of Australia have a long tradition of oral storytelling which goes back many thousands of years. They used masks and other objects to convey deep and meaningful themes about morality and nature. Masks were carved from wood and heavily decorated with paint and feathers.

In Australia in the 1960s, Peter Scriven founded the Marionette Theatre of Australia and staged beautiful marionette productions such as &quot;The Tintookies&quot;, &quot;Little Fella Bindi&quot;, &quot;The Explorers&quot; and &quot;The Water Babies&quot;.

Phillip Edmiston, who worked alongside Peter Scriven at the Marionette Theatre of Australia, went on to mount in 1977 a lavish marionette production of &quot;The Grand Adventure&quot; under the umbrella of his own company, Theatrestrings. With 127 marionettes, the A$120,000 production opened in Nambour in the Civic Hall on 28 May 1977 and subsequently toured to Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. The musical was composed by Eric Gross with book and lyrics by Hal Saunders. The story broadly told of Captain James Cook&#x27;s South Sea Island voyage with botanist Joseph Banks on HMS &quot;Endeavour&quot;. Edmiston went on to tour Queensland throughout the 1980s and 1990s with numerous productions with his new company Queensland Marionette Theatre.

Bilbar Puppet Theatre, established by Barbara Turnbull and her husband Bill Turnbull, toured Australia extensively under the auspices of the Queensland Arts Council in the 1970s and 1980s. Their shows included &quot;The Lucky Charm&quot;, &quot;Funnybone&quot;, Mozart&#x27;s opera &quot;Bastien and Bastienne&quot;, and &quot;Lazy Liza&quot;. Bilbar Puppet Theatre&#x27;s puppets are now held at the Queensland Performing Arts Centre, Brisbane. David Poulton toured marionette shows via the Queensland Arts Council along his &#x27;Strings and Things&#x27; with his wife Sally for many years from the late 1970s. Gwen and Peter Iliffe also toured with Puppet People. One of their shows was &quot;Bees Hey&quot; using the music of Bizet. Another successful group were Ehmer Puppets.

David Hamilton, one of the last remaining marionette puppeteers in Australia, tours independently and formerly toured under the auspices of the Queensland Arts Council. Some of his puppets were displayed in a special puppet exhibition mounted at the Queensland Performing Arts Complex in 2018.

Comedian and radio broadcaster Jamie Dunn was famous for his Muppet-style character, Agro, who featured on several Seven Network television programs throughout the 1980s and 1990s.

Formally trained in the United States by puppeteers from the Jim Henson Company, Brett Hansen and his Brisbane-based Larrikin Puppets company is one of only a few Muppet-style puppeteers actively performing in Australia. Cabaret Puppet Theatre, based in Brisbane&#x27;s Redlands area, also tours with productions for children and adults.

In Melbourne, Handspan Theatre (1977–2002) evolved from humble collective beginnings to a large, design-rich theatre format dubbed &#x27;Visual Theatre&#x27;, and became a hothouse for innovative projects and multimedia collaborations within Australia and around the world.

A post-graduate course existed at the Victorian College of the Arts, University of Melbourne in the late 1990s, but has since been discontinued.

Australian puppeteer Norman Hetherington was famous for his marionette, Mr. Squiggle, who featured on an Australian Broadcasting Commission television program from 1 July 1959 until 9 July 1999. In every episode he would create several pictures from &quot;squiggles&quot; sent in by children from around the country.

Richard Bradshaw OAM is another famous Australian puppeteer. He is a past president of UNIMA Australia, former artistic director of the Marionette Theatre Company of Australia, and does shadow puppetry and writing in the field.

Rod Hull also made a contribution with his puppet Emu. In the 1960s, Hull presented a children&#x27;s breakfast television programme in Australia.

Snuff Puppets is one of Australia&#x27;s modern puppet theatre troupes. Based in Melbourne, their work is full of wild black humour, political and sexual satire, and a handmade aesthetic. Snuff Puppets has performed in over 15 countries, including tours to major festivals in Asia, South America and Europe.

There is an annual winter festival of puppets at the City of Melbourne&#x27;s ArtPlay and at Federation Square in Melbourne.

In Sydney, Jeral Puppets, founded by John and Jackie Lewis in 1966, regularly performs at Puppeteria Puppet Theatre and on tour.

Spare Parts Puppet Theatre of Fremantle, Western Australia was founded by Peter Wilson, Cathryn Robinson, and Beverley Campbell-Jackson in 1981, as part of an artist-in-residency program initiated by the WA Institute of Technology (now Curtin University of Technology). The company&#x27;s first project was a puppet adaptation of Christopher Marlowe&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Faustus&quot; for the 1981 Festival of Perth.

==Contemporary era==
From early in the 19th century, puppetry began to inspire artists from the &#x27;high-art&#x27; traditions. In 1810, Heinrich von Kleist wrote an essay &#x27;On the Marionette Theatre&#x27;, admiring the &quot;lack of self-consciousness&quot; of the puppet. Puppetry developed throughout the 20th century in a variety of ways. Supported by the parallel development of cinema, television and other filmed media it now reaches a larger audience than ever. Another development, starting at the beginning of the century, was the belief that puppet theatre, despite its popular and folk roots, could speak to adult audiences with an adult, and experimental voice, and reinvigorate the high art tradition of actors&#x27; theatre.

Sergei Obraztsov explored the concept of &quot;kukolnost&quot; (&#x27;puppetness&#x27;), despite Joseph Stalin&#x27;s insistence on realism. Other pioneers, including Edward Gordon Craig and Erwin Piscator were influenced by puppetry in their crusade to regalvanise the mainstream. Maeterlinck, Shaw, Lorca and others wrote puppet plays, and artists such as Picasso, Jarry, and Léger began to work in theatre. Craig&#x27;s concept of the &quot;übermarionette&quot;—in which the director treats the actors like objects—has been highly influential on contemporary &quot;object theatre&quot; and &quot;physical theatre&quot;. Tadeusz Kantor frequently substituted actors for puppets, or combined the two, and conducted each performance from the edge of the stage, in some ways similar to a puppeteer.

Kantor influenced a new formalist generation of directors such as Richard Foreman and Robert Wilson who were concerned with the &#x27;object&#x27; in theatrical terms &quot;putting it on stage and finding different ways of looking at it&quot; (Foreman). Innovatory puppeteers such as Tony Sarg, Waldo Lanchester, John Wright, Bil Baird, Joan Baixas, Sergei Obratsov, Philipe Genty, Peter Schumann, Dattatreya Aralikatte, The Little Players, Jim Henson, Dadi Pudumjee, and Julie Taymor have also continued to develop the forms and content of puppetry, so that the phrase &#x27;puppet theatre&#x27; is no longer limited to traditional forms of marionettes, glove, or rod puppets. Directors and companies like Peter Schumann of Bread and Puppet Theatre, Bob Frith of Horse and Bamboo Theatre, and Sandy Speiler of In the Heart of the Beast Puppet and Mask Theatre have also combined mask and puppet theatre where the performer, puppets and objects are integrated within a largely visual theatre world that minimises the use of spoken language.

The Jim Henson Foundation, founded by puppeteer and Muppet creator Jim Henson, is a philanthropic, charitable organization created to promote and develop puppetry in the United States. It has bestowed 440 grants to innovative puppet theatre artists. Puppetry troupes in the early 21st-century such as HomeGrown Theatre in Boise, Idaho continue the avant garde satirical tradition for millennials.

==Events==
The International Puppet Festival (PIF) has taken place annually in mid-September Zagreb, Croatia. since 1968.

<text>Carl Henry Vogt (February 19, 1895 – May 12, 1956), known by his stage name Louis Calhern, was an American actor. Described as a “star leading man of the theater and a star character actor of the screen,” he appeared in over 100 roles on the Broadway stage and in films and television, between 1923 and 1956. He was nominated for the Academy Award and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor for portraying U.S. Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes in the 1950 film &quot;The Magnificent Yankee&quot;. 

Often cast in films as distinguished and sophisticated characters, Calhern&#x27;s other notable film roles included the scheming Ambassador Trentino in the classic Marx Brothers comedy &quot;Duck Soup&quot; (1933), the antagonist to Robert Donat&#x27;s Edmond Dantès in &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; (1934), the head of the US Secret Service in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Notorious&quot; (1946), the pivotal villain Alonzo Emmerich in John Huston’s film noir &quot;The Asphalt Jungle&quot; (1950), Buffalo Bill in the musical &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot; (1950), and the title character in Joseph L. Mankiewicz all-star 1953 film adaptation of Julius Caesar. He won a Special Jury Prize at the 15th Venice International Film Festival for his performance in &quot;Executive Suite&quot; (1954). 

==Early life==
Calhern was born Carl Henry Vogt in Brooklyn, New York, in 1895, the son of German immigrants Eugene Adolf Vogt and Hubertina Friese Vogt. He had one known sibling, a sister. His father was a tobacco dealer. His family left New York while he was in elementary school and moved to St. Louis, Missouri, where he was raised. While playing high school football, a stage manager from a touring theatrical stock company noticed the tall, handsome youth and hired him as a bit player. Another source states &quot;Grace George hired his entire high school football team as supers for a Shakespearean play.&quot;

==Career==

Just before World War I, Calhern returned to New York to pursue an acting career. He began as a prop boy and bit player with various touring and burlesque companies. He became a matinee idol after being in a play titled &quot;Cobra&quot;. Calhern&#x27;s burgeoning career was interrupted by World War I; he served in France in the 143rd Field Artillery of the U.S. Army.

Due to the anti-German sentiment during World War I, he changed his German given name, Carl. His stage name is an amalgam of his adopted hometown of St. Louis and his first and middle names, Carl and Henry (Calhern).

Calhern began working in silent films for director Lois Weber in the early 1920s, the most notable being &quot;The Blot&quot; (1921). A newspaper article commented: &quot;The new arrival in stardom is Louis Calhern, who, until Miss Weber engaged him to enact the leading male role in &quot;What&#x27;s Worth While?&quot;, had been playing leads in the Morosco Stock company of Los Angeles.&quot;

In 1923, Calhern left the movies, deciding to devote his career entirely to the stage. He returned to films early in the sound era where he was primarily cast as a character actor, while he continued to play leading roles on the stage. In 1945, Calhern won the Donaldson Award for Best Actor in a Play for his performance in &quot;The Magnificent Yankee&quot;.

Among Calhern&#x27;s notable screen portrayals were as the partner in crime to Spencer Tracy and Bette Davis in &quot;20,000 Years in Sing Sing&quot; (1932), as Ambassador Trentino in the classic Marx Brothers comedy &quot;Duck Soup&quot; (1933), as Major Dort in &quot;The Life of Emile Zola&quot; (1937), and as the spy boss of Cary Grant in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Notorious&quot; (1946).

In 1948, Calhern joined Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer as a contract player, receiving wide acclaim for three diverse roles that he appeared in for the studio in 1950: a singing role as Buffalo Bill in the film version of the musical &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot;; as a double-crossing lawyer and sugar daddy to a young Marilyn Monroe in John Huston&#x27;s &quot;The Asphalt Jungle&quot;; and his Oscar-nominated performance as Oliver Wendell Holmes in &quot;The Magnificent Yankee&quot; (re-creating his role from the Broadway stage). He was subsequently cast in the title role of Joseph L. Mankiewicz’s 1953 all-star film version of Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar, earning more praise.

Calhern played the role of the devious George Caswell, the manipulative board member of Tredway Corporation, in the 1954 production of &quot;Executive Suite&quot;, followed by the role of a jaded, acerbic high school teacher in &quot;Blackboard Jungle&quot; (1955). His performance as cheerfully lecherous Uncle Willie in &quot;High Society&quot; (1956), a musical remake of &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot;, was his final film appearance.

==Personal life==
Calhern battled alcoholism for much of his adult life; as a result, he lost several important screen and stage roles. According to former wife Natalie Schafer, Calhern&#x27;s inability to overcome his addiction ended their marriage. While he was willing to consult doctors, she said Calhern refused to attend Alcoholics Anonymous because he was an atheist and considered AA to be a religious organization. Calhern ultimately overcame his alcohol addiction by the late 1940s.

==Death==
On May 12 1956, Calhern died unexpectedly at age 61 of a heart attack in Nara, Japan, while there to film &quot;The Teahouse of the August Moon&quot;. His body was cremated and was interred at Hollywood Forever Cemetery in Los Angeles, California.

<doc id="156596" wikidata="Q765264" url="?curid=156596" title="The Magnificent Yankee (1950 film)">
<text>The Magnificent Yankee is a 1950 American biographical film adapted by Emmet Lavery from his 1946 play of the same title, which was in turn adapted from the 1942 book &quot;Mr. Justice Holmes&quot; by Francis Biddle. The story examines the life of United States Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.

The film was directed by John Sturges, with stars Louis Calhern, Ann Harding, Eduard Franz, and Philip Ober. Calhern created the role of Oliver Wendell Holmes in the original Broadway production. Calhern began as a leading man in silent films but became primarily a character actor with the arrival of the sound era. His portrayal of Holmes was his only true starring role in a sound film. A grateful Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer purchased the film rights to the play specifically for Calhern in appreciation for his consistently fine work in many supporting roles during his years with the studio.

The film was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Actor in a Leading Role (Louis Calhern) and Best Costume Design, Black-and-White.

A &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot; television production of the same title was broadcast in 1965 starring Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne.

==Plot==

Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes spends his leisure time at his home, where he entertains guests with the assistance of his loving wife, Fanny. His most trusted friend is Judge Louis Brandeis, with whom he spends hours debating the law. When Fanny dies, Holmes is heartbroken and aimless, but he finds direction again by dedicating himself to his court duties and teaching the Harvard law clerks who come to work for him.

==Cast==
* Louis Calhern as Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.
* Ann Harding as Fanny Bowditch Holmes
* Philip Ober as Owen Wister
* Eduard Franz as Justice Louis Brandeis
* Ian Wolfe as Henry Adams
* Edith Evanson as Annie Gough
* Jimmy Lydon as Clinton
* Richard Anderson as Reynolds
* Herbert Anderson as Baxter
* Hayden Rorke as Graham (uncredited)
* Dan Tobin as Dixon (uncredited)

==Release==
The film was well received by critics. While produced on a relatively modest budget, the movie initially earned just $487,000 in the US and Canada and $76,000 elsewhere, resulting in a loss to MGM of $471,000.

==Accolades==
==Music==
For his score for this film, David Raksin incorporated the songs &quot;The Battle Hymn of the Republic&quot;, &quot;Auld Lang Syne,&quot; and a portion of &quot;A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square.&quot; Raksin also conducted the score.

The complete score was issued on CD in 2009, on Film Score Monthly records.

<text>Megatron is a fictional character and the main antagonist of the &quot;Transformers&quot; media franchise produced by the American toy company Hasbro and the Japanese toy company Takara Tomy. He is the tyrannical leader of the Decepticons, a villainous faction of alien robots that seeks to conquer their home planet of Cybertron and the rest of the known universe, and serves as the archenemy of Optimus Prime, the leader of the rival Autobot faction. As with all Cybertronians, Megatron can disguise himself by transforming into vehicles or weapons. His alternate modes have included a Walther P38 handgun, a particle-beam weapon, a telescopic laser cannon, a Cybertronian jet, and various tanks, depending on which continuity he is depicted in. In some continuities, his original name is D-16.

Megatron&#x27;s most consistent origin portrays him as having risen up from being an oppressed worker to a gladiatorial champion who took the legendary name of one of the original Thirteen Primes—Megatronus—as his own. He shortened his name when he became a political revolutionary who attempted to reform Cybertron&#x27;s corrupt governing body and called for an end to its decrepit caste system. As the mentor of the young Orion Pax, Megatron preached that freedom of self-determination was the right of all sentient beings. When Megatron grew corrupted by his power, Orion would utilize his teachings against him as Optimus Prime. In most incarnations, Megatron would eventually meet his demise at Optimus&#x27; hands, only to later be resurrected as Galvatron although some continuities have Galvatron as a separate entity from Megatron.

Megatron has become one of the franchise&#x27;s most iconic characters and a widely recognized villain in popular culture. The character&#x27;s popularity has seen him appear on a variety of merchandise, such as toys, clothing and collectible items, theme park attractions, and be referenced in a number of media. He has been adapted in live-action, animated, and video game incarnations, having been voiced by actors including Frank Welker, Corey Burton, Hugo Weaving, and Brian Tyree Henry.

==Thirteen original Primes==

The original Megatronus, better known as the Fallen, was one of the original Thirteen Primes created by Primus. Megatronus betrayed his creator by siding with Primus&#x27; dark twin, the malevolent planet-eater Unicron. In the final battle between Primus and Unicron, Megatronus fell victim to the same fate as his master, sucked through a black hole into another dimension. However, while Unicron emerged in another universe, the Fallen was not so fortunate, finding himself trapped in the &quot;underspace&quot; between dimensions. 

The Fallen made his first appearance in the fifth volume of &quot;&quot;. The character appears as the main antagonist in the second live action film, &quot;&quot;, the 2009 sequel to the 2007 &quot;Transformers&quot; movie, voiced by Tony Todd. He has the ability to teleport and generate a shockwave upon reappearance. He wields a spear as his weapon and has the ability of telekinesis. Megatronus is also mentioned as one of Thirteen in &quot;&quot; and later appeared as the main antagonist in the first-season finale of &quot;&quot;, voiced by Gil Gerard.

==&quot;Generation 1&quot;==
Megatron is the founder of the Decepticon uprising and their most feared leader. Bob Budiansky, the writer for the Marvel Comics series, stated that originally Hasbro took issue with the name, saying it sounded too frightening. Budiansky responded that as the lead villain, that was the point. Hasbro later agreed with his reasoning, and approved the name &quot;Megatron&quot;. Budiansky has said in interviews that it is a portmanteau of &quot;electronic&quot; and &quot;megaton&quot;.

Megatron is able to transform into a handgun, delivering more focused energy blasts than he could in his robotic form. He can adjust his size and mass as he transforms, to comfortably allow another Transformer or even a human being to wield him. His robot form has an arm-mounted fusion cannon. He can retract and replace his right hand with energy flail. He can fire electrical blasts from his hands, laser blasts from his eyes, and can reprogram computers with a port in his head.

Megatron is a Decepticon, one of the lineal descendants of the military hardware robots created by the Quintessons on their factory world of Cybertron. In a conflict between two robotic factions, the Decepticons and the Autobots, the Autobots&#x27; invention of transformation gave them an advantage, leading to their victory. The ensuing Golden Age of Cybertron was disrupted by the rise of Megatron, who led the Decepticons against the Autobots. Megatron&#x27;s eventual defeat resulted in his rebirth as Galvatron through an alliance with the cosmic entity Unicron. Galvatron aimed to destroy the Autobot Matrix of Leadership, but his plans were thwarted, and he was thrown into space.
Galvatron&#x27;s minions later rescued him from being submerged in a plasma pit, which augmented his strength but affected his mind, making him more prone to violence and anger. Despite the damage to his mind, he retook leadership of the Decepticons and occasionally exhibited bouts of lucidity, even temporarily cooperating with Optimus Prime to combat a cosmic plague. Following a period of peace, Galvatron devised a plan to destroy Cybertron and Earth. His scheme involved using a powerful energy chamber to trigger a solar explosion. Despite his efforts, Galvatron&#x27;s plan failed, and he and his followers were launched into space.

In the Japanese continuation of the Transformers series, Galvatron remained a central figure as he led the Decepticons in various conflicts. Ultimately, he was entombed in ice by Autobot Headmasters.

The narrative centers on the ongoing struggle between the Autobots and Decepticons, highlighting the transformation of key characters, Megatron&#x27;s evolution, his alliance with Unicron, and his relentless pursuit of power and dominance. The story unfolds across different series and episodes, depicting battles, alliances, and Megatron&#x27;s relentless determination to achieve his goals, which ultimately lead to his eventual defeat and entombment.

===Other appearances===
Megatron appears in the short-lived online &quot;Universe&quot; cartoon, where he plots to steal gasoline in order to produce Energon. Notably, his alternate mode of a jet is exactly the same as that of Cyclonus, and he incorporates several elements from his live-action movie design, such as both arms fusing together to form his fusion cannon. Megatron made a cameo in the pilot of the &quot;&quot; series on a historical video being viewed by Optimus Prime. This historical video was stock footage from the original animated series.

===Books===
Megatron appeared in the following books:
* &quot;The Revenge of the Decepticons&quot; written by Suzanne Weyn and published by Marvel Books in 1984.
* The 1985 audio story &quot;Sun Raid&quot; and &quot;Satellite of Doom&quot;.
* The Ladybird Transformers audio books &quot;Autobots&#x27; Lightning Strike&quot;, &quot;Laserbeak&#x27;s Fury&quot;, &quot;Megatron&#x27;s Fight for Power&quot; and &quot;Autobots Fight Back&quot;.
* The 1985 Find Your Fate Junior book called &quot;Dinobots Strike Back&quot; by Casey Todd.
* The 1985 Find Your Fate Junior book called &quot;Battle Drive&quot; by Barbara Siegel and Scott Siegel.

Megatron was featured in the 1993 &quot;Transformers: Generation 2&quot; coloring book &quot;Decepticon Madness&quot; by Bud Simpson.

===Comics===
====Japanese manga====
In the Japanese manga &quot;Big War&quot; #2, the Autobots Rodimus Prime, Grimlock, Kup and Wheelie, along with their human allies Spike Witwicky and Daniel Witwicky send Computron into battle against Galvatron&#x27;s new warrior combiner Abominus. The Terrorcons spit &quot;corrosive control liquid&quot; against Computron, taking control of him and turning him into a Decepticon. Spike luckily uses his new Exosuit to free Computron with &quot;defense spray.&quot; Defeated, Galvatron retreats.

In the Transformers Manga #5, Galvatron and his Decepticons attacked the Prime Energy Tower. Galvatron ordered the Decepticons to form Menasor, Devastator and Bruticus and attack. Rodimus Prime counted this move by ordering in Superion, Omega Supreme and Defensor. Galvatron then ordered in Predaking, knowing that Sky Lynx was elsewhere and couldn&#x27;t counter them. Rodimus ordered the Omnibots to attack Predaking&#x27;s legs. Tripping up the giant he fell into the other Decepticon giants, winning the day for the Autobots.

Galvatron also appeared in a series of Japanese Manga comic strips set in continuity with the &quot;Headmasters&quot; series, where he attempted to destroy the Autobots with such schemes as creating his own army of Megatron clones, attempting to destroy Fortress Maximus and creating a hybrid of the original Megatron and Optimus Prime named Guiltor to destroy Rodimus Prime, although he ended up teaming up with his enemy to destroy it after it went rogue.

After Galvatron&#x27;s seeming destruction in &quot;Headmasters&quot;, this was all that was heard from Galvatron in the animated continuity for several years until the &quot;Battlestars: The Return of Convoy&quot; storyline (although not animated in itself, consisting of one manga chapter and a selection of magazine spreads, it continues the storyline of the animated series). Buried and deactivated beneath the ice, Galvatron was recovered by the evil entity, Dark Nova, and reformatted into Super Megatron and later on as Ultra Megatron, going on to battle Star Convoy (a similarly reborn Optimus Prime).

====Marvel Comics====
In the world of Marvel Comics, Megatron begins by rising from his beginnings as a gladiator for the city-state of Tarn. Megatron and the Decepticons were the ones who developed transformation first, using it to begin the war against the Autobots, who fought back by mimicking the technology. Eventually, Cybertron was shaken from its orbit and fell into the path of an asteroid cluster. This would result in the Ark venturing out and then crashing into prehistoric Earth. Four million years later, in 1984, the Transformers were reawakened, and Megatron was defeated twice by Optimus Prime.

Megatron also featured prominently in &quot;Alignment&quot;, Simon Furman&#x27;s take on what happened after the &quot;Generation 2&quot; comic. In this story, Megatron was defeated for command of the Decepticons by Galvatron II (the U.S. comics version) and left for dead. Soundwave had revived his master. Megatron took a fleet of scavenged Warworlds to face the Liege Maximo. He was destroyed by Maximo&#x27;s arm cannon; he unleashed an Energon-fueled blast that destroyed the Maximo. This sets up the Pax Cybertronia and the evolution of the Autobots and Decepticons into Maximals and Predacons. Whether this story is reconcilable with &quot;Reaching the Omega Point&quot;, or whether it is even part of the Transformers canon is debatable.

====TFcon comics====
Megatron appeared in the 2006 TransformersCon voice actor play. Voices in the play were performed by a variety of volunteers and the actual voice actors attending the convention. The play itself should be considered unofficial but was notable because it featured several Transformers&#x27; original voice actors reprising their Transformers roles. In this voice actor play various Transformers from different timelines and realities were swept up in a repeating wave and transported along with Unicron to Earth. The Transformers included &quot;Generation 1&quot; Tracks, Ariel, Cosmos and Megatron, &quot;Beast Wars&quot; Tarantulas, &quot;Robots in Disguise&quot; Sky-Byte and &quot;Beast Machines&quot; Tankor.

====Dreamwave Productions====
In the 21st-century reimagining of the Generation One Universe by Dreamwave Productions, Megatron was envisioned as an ancient gladiatorial combatant in the depths of Cybertron&#x27;s underworld. As victory upon victory mounted, he began to realize that the games were nothing more than an elaborate attempt by the Cybertronian elders to hide the truth of Cybertron&#x27;s history from the masses. When Megatron attempted to gain access to that knowledge through exploration and research, the Cybertronian elders attempted to have him assassinated—a plan that only resulted in stirring up even more discontent among Cybertronians which allowed Megatron to begin recruiting for the Decepticon movement. It is known that at one point Megatron attempted to recruit Grimlock as one of his inner circle, but the fellow gladiator refused the position, eventually joining the Autobots.

Megatron would also appear in Dreamwave&#x27;s &quot;Transformers/G.I. Joe&quot; limited series. Unlike many of the other Transformers (who were given World War II vehicle alternate modes), Megatron would keep his basic Walther P38 handgun transformation, which was indeed a WWII German handgun. Forming an alliance with Cobra Commander due to their similar natures, Megatron nonetheless had a bitter personal rivalry with the tyrannical leader of the terrorist group Cobra, resulting in Megatron killing several of his troops and Cobra Commander having to use the Matrix to keep him in line. Later, Megatron refuses to help the Commander since Bruticus had tried to crush him and allows the Baroness to use him in gun mode to shoot the helpless Cobra Leader. After battling Optimus Prime, he was deactivated along with all the Transformers when Snake Eyes opened the Matrix.

====Devil&#x27;s Due Publishing====
In the &quot;G.I. Joe vs. The Transformers&quot; comics printed by Devil&#x27;s Due Publishing, Megatron was again among the Decepticons who crashed in the Ark on Earth, but this time the Ark was discovered by Cobra, who reformatted the Autobots and Decepticons into weapons and vehicles for themselves called Battle Android Troopers controlled by the Tele-Vipers.

Megatron is locked in gun mode and kept by Cobra Commander. When Optimus Prime broke free of the controls, Megatron convinced his keeper to free him to fight Optimus. Wounded by the Autobots and a malfunctioning orbiting weapons system, Megatron was eventually defeated and believed destroyed. In reality, much of his body remained and the U.S. government studied his workings to advance their own projects in military supercomputers.

In the third volume of the series, it was revealed that the U.S. Government had created the android Serpentor (or, as he is called here, Serpent O.R., standing for Organic Robot) using DNA from great historical war leaders and parts from Megatron. Serpentor succeeded where Megatron had failed and captured Optimus Prime. But Serpentor&#x27;s exposure to the Matrix, possession by Cobra Commander, and subsequent destruction left Megatron&#x27;s legacy unfulfilled.

====Fun Publications====
The &quot;Transformers Classics&quot; comics published in the Official Transformers Collectors Club magazine are set in the Marvel Comics continuity, but in a timeline where the events of &quot;Generation 2&quot; did not occur. The story occurs fifteen years after Megatron was presumed dead in the crash of the Ark. Megatron survived, and eventually upgraded his body (based on his Classics toy) and gathered many other Decepticons to him. Soundwave helped him in recovering the body of Astrotrain, which was then used to help locate the placement of other fallen Decepticons around the globe. Those who joined Megatron included Laserbeak, Ramjet, Ravage, Skywarp, Soundwave, Starscream and the Constructicons. Megatron also reactivated Thrust, Dirge and Thundercracker, but the three left him to join up with Bludgeon&#x27;s troops — mostly because they couldn&#x27;t work with Starscream, who had killed them once. Megatron based his command on the wreck of the Ark in the Yukon, where he keeps the fallen body of Ratchet as a trophy and the severed, but living, head of Shockwave as an advisor.

In &quot;Crossing Over&quot;, when Skyfall and Landquake were presumed killed in the midst of a bloody Mini-Con civil war and attack by Unicron (set concurrently with the events of &quot;&quot;), they were, in actuality, transported across universes, from the world of the &quot;Unicron Trilogy&quot; into the &quot;Marvel Comics&quot; timeline. Unclear what had happened, they then found themselves staring down the barrel of Megatron&#x27;s cannon. The two were saved when a group of Robot Hunters in battle suits attacked Megatron. Megatron slaughtered them, only to be confronted by a team of Autobots led by Optimus Prime. Skyfall went with the Autobots, while Landquake was taken by Megatron. Back at the Ark Landquake was interrogated and swore loyalty to Megatron. Scrapper detected an unusual Energon reading similar to that of Landquake and the Decepticons went to investigate, only to be confronted by the Autobots again.

In &quot;Games of Decepticon&quot;, Megatron detects the arrival of Bugbite&#x27;s ship on Earth and sends Starscream, Skywarp, and Ramjet to investigate. The Decepticons capture the Autobot spy Mirage. Returning to the Ark the Decepticons fall under the sway of Bugbite, who is using cerebro shells he stole from the Insecticon Bombshell. Megatron overcomes the shell and destroys Bugbite, as the Autobots under the command of Grimlock raid the Ark, destroying the computer and saving Mirage.

Megatron appears in &quot;At Fight&#x27;s End&quot; talking to Ratchet. Megatron defeated Deathsaurus in combat for leadership of the Decepticons. He orders the combiner technology that he captures from Deathsaurus to be used on the Constructicons. Megatron then attacks Iacon with his new weapon, Devastator.

====IDW Publishing====
After Dreamwave&#x27;s closure, the rights to the Transformers comics were taken over by IDW Publishing. IDW would take the opportunity to reboot the Transformers universe, including a revised origin for Megatron detailing how he came to power. Here, Megatron was originally a lowly Energon miner. He also formed an uneasy truce with Starscream.

In the IDW continuity, Megatron retains his role as supreme commander of the Decepticon army, although, in this continuity, they are no longer based on Cybertron (which was rendered uninhabitable by Thunderwing) and are fighting to conquer multiple worlds simultaneously. In fact, he barely seems to care about Cybertron and was willing to order its total destruction to stop the reanimated Thunderwing. Having now ingested Ore-13, Megatron is able to easily manage mass displacement and thus turn into an Earth handgun (in &quot;Escalation #2&quot;), and the newfound power appears to have affected his actions—he personally went on the Brasnya mission and is confident enough to transform &amp; battle Optimus in front of human witnesses, actions that Optimus finds out of character. His instability is also what leads the other Decepticons to awaken Starscream to stand up to him in &quot;Devastation&quot;. Eventually, after witnessing Bumblebee&#x27;s willingness to sacrifice himself in order to stop the machinations of Shockwave, Megatron does the unthinkable and joins the Autobot cause. Megatron joins the crew of the &quot;Lost Light&quot; as its captain, though the bulk of the crew refuses to accept his change of heart and mutinies against him and his new Autobot friends. Megatron subsequently leads the outcasts into battle against the fanatical Decepticon Justice Division but later is trapped in the alternate Functionist universe with his old mentor Terminus.

Megatron features prominently in &quot;Transformers: Regeneration One&quot;, Simon Furman&#x27;s continuation of the original Marvel series in which the events of &quot;Generation 2&quot; did not occur. Here, Megatron&#x27;s lifeforce is still linked to Ratchet&#x27;s, and after waking up on Earth in 1994, he has built what&#x27;s left of Ratchet into a battle sled. Megatron also creates a zombie army from the mostly-Decepticon victims of the Underbase-empowered Starscream, while lobotomizing the still-living Starscream himself. Megatron proceeds to devastate the Earth, turning its nuclear arsenal against the population and destroying Fortress Maximus. The Wreckers discover what Megatron&#x27;s done in the year 2012, prompting Optimus Prime to bring an assault team from Cybertron. Megatron is defeated when Kup destroys Ratchet, stopping Megatron in his tracks and permitting Optimus to destroy him once and for all.

In an interview, writer Simon Furman indicated that Galvatron made his first IDW Publishing appearance in &quot;The Transformers: Spotlight&quot; issue featuring Nightbeat. Unlike other incarnations, this Galvatron was not a recreated Megatron, but instead a separate Transformer from the Golden Age of Cybertron who is driven by a belief in having a great destiny. He was one of the crew of the lost &quot;Ark-1&quot;, which had secretly been seeking out (under orders from Nova Prime) an anomaly that was &quot;a door to somewhere else... a dark mirror of the Matrix itself&quot;. Galvatron deliberately flew the &quot;Ark&quot; into the anomaly to find out the answers, thus marooning the crew in the Dead Universe. In the present day, he heads for Cybertron to obtain Thunderwing&#x27;s body, destroying an alien observation station on the way. On Cybertron, Galvatron killed Leadfoot and easily overpowered Hound&#x27;s unit, though he left them alive as a small act of defiance against his master. He made his first appearance in the main storyline in issue 3 of &quot;The Transformers: Devastation&quot;, being sent to Earth by Nemesis Prime to stop the Reapers from destroying it too soon. He turned the Reaper leader into a dead being able to kill by touch (like himself) and left it to decimate his fellow Reapers. Caught between this and the Ore-13-charged Decepticons, the Reapers were soon annihilated, and Galvatron left with the body of Sixshot. He then reported back to Prime, who made it clear in conversation with Jhiaxus that he was not unaware of Galvatron&#x27;s rebellious ambitions.

As with the Marvel version of Galvatron, he is seemingly invincible and shrugs off powerful weapons. Unlike other incarnations of the character, he appears to be able to kill and decay others by touch and can even survive being shot through the head at close range by powerful weapons. In &quot;Devastation&quot; he is shown to be able to confer his touch of death onto others, turning the Reaper leader into an unwilling &quot;giver of unlife&quot;. There are hints that he is not actually alive—after surviving his headshot, he responded to a cry of &quot;He&#x27;s not dead!&quot; by thinking &quot;Wrong&quot;, and he has referred to the others in the Dead Universe as actually being dead: &quot;I killed them&quot;.

====Kiss Players====
Although Megatron himself would not make an appearance in the Japanese-exclusive Kiss Players line, he would nonetheless have a small role to play. When Rodimus Prime hurled Galvatron out of Unicron at the climax of &quot;The Transformers: The Movie&quot;, Galvatron hurtled through space, out of control, until he eventually crash-landed in Tokyo, devastating much of the city. Although comatose, Galvatron&#x27;s Unicron-corrupted cells spread throughout Earth and fused with various creatures. 

====Binaltech====
Megatron is largely &quot;off-screen&quot; for most of the Binaltech saga, reflecting the absence of a Megatron figure in that toy line. Due to the interference of Ravage (the same future Ravage who appears in the Beast Wars), most of the events of the original animated feature do not transpire; most importantly the Battle of Autobot City does not occur, and Optimus Prime and Megatron do not have their final showdown, meaning that Optimus Prime does not die, and Megatron is never reformatted into Galvatron.

====Unite Warriors====
The Unite Warriors storyline—exclusive to Japan—introduced the character of Megaempress, a female Decepticon whose bio states that she was created from parts left over from Megatron&#x27;s construction. She thus considers herself to be Megatron&#x27;s wife—or the Transformer equivalent—and Empress of the Decepticons; whether Megatron views her in this fashion is unknown.

==Beast Era==

The &quot;Beast Wars&quot; and &quot;Beast Machines&quot; version of Megatron appears in the aforementioned parts of the &quot;Transformers&quot; animated series, toy lines, and multiverse. This Megatron is a separate character from his original &quot;Generation 1&quot; counterpart, but the original pack-in mini-comic and biographies released with the earliest &quot;Beast Wars&quot; toys indicate that the character was supposed to be the original Megatron, in a new body. With the advent of the animated series, however, the fiction of &quot;Beast Wars&quot; was reimagined and eventually applied to the toy line, establishing this Megatron as an independent character.

In the past, a few fans have referred to him as Megatron II to distinguish him from the original character of the same name; in the Japanese &quot;Transformers: Robot Masters&quot; series, he was named Beast Megatron for this purpose. Usually, however, he is simply referred to as the &quot;Beast Wars&quot; Megatron. His ultimate goal is the conquest of Cybertron, where he was branded a criminal. Few pieces of information exist about Megatron before the &quot;Beast Wars&quot;. The Japanese Beast Wars II toy catalogue claims that he had battled and lost to Galvatron (the villain of that series) in the past, while the 2006 BotCon comics claime he was previously a commander in the Predacon army who had developed many of the Predacons&#x27; tactics.

According to the 2007 CGI movie &quot;Theft of the Golden Disk&quot;, Megatron was Cryotek&#x27;s pupil. It was Cryotek who masterminded the theft of the Golden Disk, but Megatron betrayed his mentor and fled Cybertron with his prize, leaving Cryotek and Dirge to be arrested by Maximals. In a 2010 interview with &quot;Shogun Gamer&quot;, David Kaye said that Megatron is the role he is more likely to be remembered for.

Three centuries after the end of The Great War, when Maximal and Predacon had risen to replace the Autobots and the Decepticons, one Predacon, in particular, was discontented with the Maximals&#x27; control of Cybertron following the Autobot victory in the war. Studying the ancient Cybertronian text called the Covenant of Primus, the Predacon took the name &quot;Megatron&quot; from a great destroyer of the same name that the book foretold (which may or may not have been also an indirect homage to his namesake, the Decepticon Megatron). Searching for Energon to power his takeover bid, he stole the legendary artifact known as the Golden Disk but discovered amongst its data more than the mere location of an Energon source—encoded onto the disk was a message from the original Megatron, which contained the coordinates of the prehistoric planet Earth. Using transwarp technology would allow a user to travel back in time and alter history—specifically, to destroy Optimus Prime as he lay in stasis within the &quot;Ark&quot;, thereby preventing the Autobots from winning The Great War.

In &quot;Beast Machines&quot;, Megatron&#x27;s personality underwent a change to become a much darker character. Losing many of his previous personality quirks, he developed a hatred of organics and free will, but oddly saw himself as a savior of Cybertron. His sense of humor vanished, replaced with &quot;Machine Precision&quot; and his plans had evolved to galactic conquest. He even developed some sense of honor, keeping his word to Rattrap in one case where he would have formerly taken advantage of an opponent. However, he still retained his strategic brilliance and manipulative abilities, outwitting the Maximals and other enemies with his plans on nearly every occasion.

===Comics===

====3H Enterprises====
Megatron&#x27;s sudden development of a transformation-freezing virus, spark-extraction and Vehicon technology, and drones went without explanation in the animated series, with the large time gap between his return and the Maximals&#x27; left to serve as a grey area in which these innovations occurred. The comics exclusive to the BotCon convention, however, shone some light on this period of time and revealed that upon his return to Cybertron, Megatron met his former mentor, Cryotek. Cryotek offered to free Megatron of his beast mode by transferring most of it to himself, only to have the transfer send him into a period of stasis lock. Megatron went into seclusion, using Cryotek&#x27;s plundered inventions to develop the technology that he used to enslave Cybertron.

Megatron was intended to appear in an upgraded form during the &quot;Universe&quot; storyline, but the line was canceled before this could come to pass. However, an alternate version was mentioned as hailing from a universe where he was overthrown and killed by Obisidian after taking control of Cybertron with his Vehicons. &quot;Ask Vector Prime&quot; later expanded on this storyline, revealing that in this universe Starscream&#x27;s Spark had possessed Waspinator and destroyed the Maximals, while the Quantum Surge was caused when Megatron tricked Blackarachnia into destroying the Vok weapon in orbit around prehistoric Earth. &quot;Waspscream&quot; then overthrew Megatron and killed him, Scorponok, and Inferno, later doing the same to Silverbolt after he left the Predacons. However, during the crew&#x27;s journey back to Cybertron, Megatron would escape and beat the others back to the planet, taking it over as he had in &quot;Beast Machines.&quot;

Waspscream, Tarantulas, Protoform X, and Terrorsaur would escape Megatron&#x27;s transformation virus and be reformatted into techno-organic forms by the Oracle, becoming a resistance force that opposed Megatron and his generals: the liberated Inferno and the reprogrammed/reformatted Silverbolt and Scorponok, who became Jetstorm and Tankor. Waspscream&#x27;s forces later saved Silverbolt, and the threat of other resistance groups soon pushed Megatron to recruit Obsidian as a new general; however, without Strika to serve as his counterbalance Obsidian turned against Megatron and overthrew him. This pushed Inferno into the Predacon camp, and after Obsidian and Tankor were drawn into the Universe War by Unicron Waspscream and the other rebel forces reclaimed Cybertron.

====Dreamwave Productions====
Megatron&#x27;s earliest fictional depiction in comics was in a two-part short story told in Dreamwave&#x27;s &quot;Transformers: More Than Meets The Eye&quot; series of character profiles. The tale started and finished the series, showing a mysterious figure (who would be revealed at the story&#x27;s close as Megatron) and his accomplice accessing the supercomputer Vector Sigma through a node in an ancient Autobot library and viewing the profiles of the Autobots and Decepticons of the Great War (in reality the character profiles of the series). As the accomplice dispatched a Maximal security agent his leader obtained the Golden Disk and announced he wished to be addressed as Megatron from now on, implying he took the name after viewing the profile of the original Megatron.

In addition to his surprise appearance in Dreamwave&#x27;s &quot;More Than Meets The Eye&quot; series, Megatron was set to appear in Dreamwave&#x27;s unpublished &quot;Beast Wars&quot; comic. Although the company&#x27;s bankruptcy meant that no issues were released, released art and information have revealed that the second issue would have dealt with Megatron&#x27;s trial on Cybertron at the hands of Magmatron.

====IDW Publishing====
IDW Publishing&#x27;s 2006 comic book, &quot;Beast Wars: The Gathering&quot;, sees Megatron&#x27;s old rival from Cybertron, Magmatron, travel back to the time of the &quot;Beast Wars&quot; (shortly after Megatron&#x27;s failed attempt at killing Optimus Prime) at the behest of the Tripredacus Council. Activating all the remaining stasis pods on the planet, Magmatron quickly assembled a Predacon army of his own, including a reanimated Ravage. Although Magmatron had ambitions to stage a coup like Megatron, he did not want to reveal his intentions to the Tripredacus Council yet and aimed to capture Megatron for them as his mission required, to divert suspicion. Revealing himself to Megatron, the two would-be tyrants battled, but Megatron was captured when Magmatron&#x27;s lackeys Iguanus and Drill Bit managed to knock Megatron out. Magmatron aimed to send him back to Cybertron, but due to the intervention of Razorbeast, Optimus Minor, and Grimlock, Magmatron was sent back to Cybertron instead. Razorbeast left the unconscious Megatron on Earth, fearing an alteration to the time stream if he captured him.

Megatron&#x27;s presence is felt in IDW&#x27;s second &quot;Beast Wars&quot; series as well, with Ravage (resurrected as a Transmetal by Magmatron) aiming to capture Razorbeast&#x27;s chronal armband, which would allow him to interfere with the &quot;main&quot; timestream (the &quot;Beast Wars&quot; of the TV show). He planned to free Megatron from his imprisonment on the Autobot shuttle and ally with him to kill all the Maximals on the planet. His plan was thwarted by Razorbeast. However, in the very last panel of the series, Megatron is seen overlooking a ravaged Cybertron, presumably having just arrived from his long transwarp journey before his Maximal rivals.

Megatron has a biography printed in the &quot;Beast Wars Sourcebook&quot; by IDW Publishing. In 2016, he also appeared in the &quot;Dawn of the Predacus&quot; comic released at the BotCon convention that year, with IDW publishing the comic in place of Fun Publications. In this storyline, set some 300 years before the Beast Wars, Megatron&#x27;s form—a Retool of &quot;Robots in Disguise&quot; Megatron/Galvatron—is the result of having his body reconstructed with Techno-Organic Tri-Malteranium, a technology also known as &quot;TM3&quot;. In this story, Megatron is a Decepticon commander who, after learning of Galvatron&#x27;s death and the Tripredacus Council&#x27;s resolution to call a cease-fire, orders his forces—including Predaking—to attack. His force is then engaged by Magnaboss, but after learning of Predaking&#x27;s defeat he is stunned by Ravage, and later disciplined for failing to follow the orders of the Tripredacus Council.

====Fun Publications====
Megatron was featured in the 2006 BotCon tale &quot;Timelines: Dawn of Futures Past&quot;, which picked up where the Dreamwave story left off. Much more of the background surrounding his theft of the Golden Disk artifacts was revealed. A feared general in the Predacon army, he went rogue from the Predacons after the signing of the Pax Cybertronia—a peace treaty between the Maximal and Predacon factions—and took the name of Megatron. He swiftly gathered a crew of like-minded individuals and, while Waspinator and Terrorsaur stole a ship, he, Dinobot, and Scorponok stole the disk, battling the guards and destroying one, leaving the other to commandeer a ship to pursue them. Picked up by their ship, they fled and were pursued by two ships—one of which was the &quot;Axalon&quot;. Tarantulas was able to decode enough information from the Golden Disk to set a course through transwarp space. With a little help from Laserbeak and Buzzsaw (secretly sent by Divebomb to ensure Megatron&#x27;s plan to change history succeeded), they destroy one of their pursuers, and the newly christened &quot;Darkside&quot; flees into Transwarp space, with the &quot;Axalon&quot; in pursuit—thus beginning the &quot;Beast Wars&quot;.

To marry the visual appearance of Megatron&#x27;s pre-Beast form seen in the first episode of the &quot;Beast Wars&quot; animated series (indeed, Megatron is the &quot;only&quot; character whose entire body is depicted, albeit briefly, prior to reformatting into a beast mode) with the toy of the character available exclusively at the convention, the story notes that Megatron adopts a detachable suit of armor that transforms into a missile tank, similar to a Pretender Shell or Ultra Magnus&#x27;s outer armor in Dreamwave&#x27;s series. The tank is his toy; the character&#x27;s profile in the widespread release of the comic notes that his original body transforms into a hover tank. Notably, &quot;Timelines&quot; presents a slightly different version of the disk&#x27;s theft to the story presented in Dreamwave comics. In &quot;Timelines&quot;, Megatron seems to already be known to other characters by that name, whereas in Dreamwave&#x27;s story, he only takes the name after taking possession of the disk. Whether the two are reconcilable is unknown.

Megatron appeared in the 2008 BotCon voice-actor play &quot;Bee in the City&quot;, voiced by David Kaye. After losing Optimus Prime and Sari to the Transtech incarnation of Shockwave, Bumblebee and Flareup meet Megatron, who goes by the name of &quot;Joe&quot; to avoid any attraction. Learning of the Allspark key on Sari&#x27;s person, Megatron offers his aid. Once Bumblebee frees his friends, Megatron reveals himself as he uses the key to bring an army to life. However, when his army realizes the consequence of their coming to being within Transtech Cybertron, a mutiny ensues as Megatron is dragged off while vowing revenge.

&quot;Ask Vector Prime&quot; also introduces an alternate version of Megatron created by the events of the Binaltech storyline who later invades the &quot;Robots in Disguise&quot; universe and is transformed into the villainous &quot;Megahead Megatron&quot;. Establishing a horde of Vehicons as his original counterpart had, he proceeded to plunge Cybertron into a Spark War, with Mirage as one of his many victims. However, he was eventually defeated due to the actions of the Binaltech Alternity in dispatching a crew of similarly created Maximals—including Air Attack Optimus Primal—to challenge his efforts. However, his legacy would continue to plague that universe, as his associate Cryotek would use the Transwarp technology Megatron contributed to their efforts to launch a campaign across time and space.

Megatron&#x27;s story continued in the pages of the biography printed by Fun Publications for the 25th-anniversary Optimus Primal toy. Even his death at the conclusion of &quot;Beast Machines&quot; would not be the end of Megatron&#x27;s villainy. Due to the inextricable link that had been forged between himself and Optimus Primal when Cybertron was reformatted, Primal&#x27;s return to life to lead the &quot;Children of Primus&quot; against the machinations of Unicron meant that Megatron was also brought back to the land of the living. This time, however, the two old enemies found themselves in an uneasy alliance, traveling from universe to universe to wherever the multiversal conflict had spread. While this storyline would never play out, the design used for Megatron&#x27;s Universe form—a remold/redeco of &quot;Robots in Disguise&quot; Megatron—would later see use in the &quot;Dawn of Predacus&quot; storyline for BotCon 2016.

====TFcon comics====
Megatron appears among the characters in &quot;Re-Unification&quot;, the 2010 TFCon voice actor play prelude comic. He is featured in the Beast Wars Transformers Mutating Card Game by Parker Brothers.

==&quot;Beast Wars Second&quot;==
In the interim between the first and second seasons of the &quot;Beast Wars&quot; animated series, the &quot;Beast Wars II&quot; anime was produced in Japan to fill the gap, producing a feature film titled &quot;Beast Wars II: Lio Convoy&#x27;s Close Call!&quot; In this film, the Predacons of the series discover a mysterious transwarp device. The Predacons&#x27; leader, Galvatron, attempted to use the time-and-space-warping gate to summon a &quot;Megatron&quot; to his aid. It is unclear whether he was searching for the original Megatron or the Predacon who went by the same name, but regardless, Galvatron&#x27;s brother Gigastorm screwed up the calculations and instead summoned the titanic Majin Zarak, whom Galvatron proudly declared to be far superior to Megatron.

==&quot;Transformers: Robot Masters&quot;==
The short-lived &quot;Transformers: Robot Masters&quot; line released exclusively in Japan saw Megatron transported through the mysterious &quot;Blastizone&quot; to Earth in the early 21st century, where he sided with the Decepticons, currently led by Starscream after the disappearance of Megatron. Dubbed &quot;Beast Megatron&quot; to distinguish him from his predecessor, Megatron bested Starscream and took leadership of the Decepticons until the original Megatron returned in the form of Reverse Convoy, and the two Megatrons merged their energies to create the &quot;Double Megatron Tornado&quot;. This power, however, was thwarted by the &quot;Triple Convoy Tornado Link Attack&quot; formed from the energy of Optimus Prime, Optimus Primal, and Lio Convoy.

Oddly, the &quot;Robot Masters&quot; series depicted Megatron standing as tall as the original Decepticon characters, when Maximals and Predacons were much smaller. Additionally, he is capable of robot-mode flight and breathes fire in dinosaur mode, neither of which he can do in the &quot;Beast Wars&quot; TV series.

==Robots in Disguise==

This version of Megatron (known as Gigatron in Japan) is a six-changer, powerful enough to transform into five additional modes besides his robot form—twin-headed dragon, bat-gargoyle creature, race car, spaceship and claw (GigaDragon, GigaBat, GigaFormula, GigaJet and GigaHand in Japanese). Each form has its own different frightening capabilities, making Megatron a very unstable and unpredictable fighter. Unlike his namesake, Megatron would often sit back from a conflict and allow his subordinates to do the dirty work. Like his counterparts, he is arrogant, but unlike them, he also was incompetent, as most of his schemes were badly planned and badly executed. Upon his upgrade into Galvatron, he gains additional forms and the ability to absorb energy from other lifeforms.

A Predacon warlord before coming to Earth, Megatron is believed to have decimated numerous planets in his quest for energy. Optimus stated that Megatron left entire planets as &quot;lifeless barren rocks&quot;. Needing ever more energy, Megatron targeted Earth&#x27;s energy; to that end, he kidnapped the human energy-research expert, Doctor Kenneth Onishi, using his psycho-probe to drain information on Earth&#x27;s energy sources from his mind. But even his subordinates were unaware that Megatron had a greater scheme in motion. In the original Car Robots series, the character was developed as a new, unique villain character called Gigatron; however, the name &quot;Megatron&quot; was used in the U.S. dub due to recognition, as well as maintaining ownership of the trademark. In Korea, the character has been established as being the same character as &quot;Beast Wars II&quot; Galvatron. In this version of the series, each of Gigatron&#x27;s modes has its own personality.

===Comics===
====Dreamwave Productions====
The character of &quot;RiD&quot; Megatron made one appearance in Dreamwave comics &#x27;Summer Special&#x27; issue before the company went under, sending his bickering lieutenants Scourge and Sky-Byte to steal a nuclear generator while he led the other Decepticons and Predacons to distract the Autobots. There was a contest in the issue as to whether &quot;RiD&quot; or &quot;Beast Wars&quot; would be the next Dreamwave comic series, which &quot;Beast Wars&quot; won. But Dreamwave went bankrupt before the series began.

====IDW Publishing====
Gigatron appears in the &quot;Generation 1&quot; IDW Publishing series that focuses on the Autobot Drift in design completely based on his &quot;Robots in Disguise&quot; appearance, but as a character separate from G1 Megatron.
===Other versions===
&quot;Ask Vector Prime&quot; would introduce additional versions of this Megatron/Galvatron, both associating with other tyrants. One version would join forces with the Predacon Cryotek, who reformatted him into the Vehicon Megabolt to enable him to control Fortress Maximus. Similarly, in another universe, the tyrannical Megazarak would use the remains of the fallen Megatron to create an undead Megabolt to serve as his own controller for Fortress Maximus. However, before he could implement this plan, Megabolt and others of Megazarak&#x27;s forces would be abducted by Unicron.

==Unicron trilogy==

The Megatron of the &quot;Unicron Trilogy&quot; (&quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;) is the leader of the evil Decepticons in that universe of the &quot;Transformers&quot; mythology. In all three animated series, he is modified into Galvatron, reverting to his Megatron name at the beginning of each series. He is voiced by David Kaye, who also voiced the &quot;Beast Wars&quot; and &quot;Beast Machines&quot; version of Megatron.

===Animated series===
Megatron is a refined, focused general of the Decepticons. He is extremely cruel, ruthless, and cunning as well as incredibly strong and intelligent. Only Optimus Prime can be compared with him in force. Megatron will stop at nothing in order to achieve his ultimate object, that is to say, to rule over the entire Universe, in the end. In&quot; Micron Legend &quot;(the Japanese version of&quot; Transformers: Armada&quot;) Megatron did not rename himself Galvatron when he received his power boost. Instead, he renames himself when he is reborn in &quot;Superlink&quot;, using the name &quot;Galvatron&quot; throughout the series. In the American version, on the other hand, he reverts to using the name Megatron again, changing it to Galvatron once more towards the end of the series.

Ten years later, Primus&#x27;s plan to imprison Unicron&#x27;s spark at the heart of the sun ultimately failed, leading the star to collapse, creating a black hole that threatened the existence of Cybertron, and the rest of the universe. Escaping his confinement within the sun, Megatron (now known as Master Megatron in Japan) enhanced his powers by merging his body with the remnants of Unicron&#x27;s shattered form, increasing his power with the dark god&#x27;s own. In this new form, Megatron becomes a Triple Changer with the ability to change into a monstrous racing vehicle and a Cybertronian jet plane. His primary weapons consist of two rear-mounted missile launchers and the ability to unleash energy streams from his palms in the shape of lightning bolts. In addition, he can call upon a Cyber Key to activate high-speed thrusters in vehicle mode, as well as a battle claw (named Death Claw in Japan) in robot mode.

Megatron (in his &quot;Cybertron&quot; form) appears among the characters in &quot;Re-Unification&quot;, the 2010 TFcon voice actor play prelude comic.

===Comics===
====Dreamwave Productions====
The story of Megatron in the &quot;&quot; comics would be similar to his animated counterpart, but with an expanded backstory. Attacking various Mini-Con villages to draw the Autobots away, Megatron&#x27;s forces then declared war and invaded Cyber-City, crushing all resistance and announcing himself as its new leader. The Autobots returned but were no match for the Mini-Con-enhanced Decepticons. However, a handful of Mini-Cons broke into Decepticon headquarters, freed most of their comrades, and evacuated the planet. Despite this setback, the few Mini-Cons that Megatron had left were still enough to allow him to conquer Cybertron.

Realizing that the threat Unicron posed was too great to be overcome on his own, Megatron agreed to cooperate with Optimus Prime by pooling resources. Megatron&#x27;s Decepticons and the Autobots came to a truce for their final battle with Unicron. Megatron returned the Mini-Cons and joined the battle against Unicron, but secretly planned to let the Autobots die and then strike a bargain with Unicron. In the final battle with Unicron, Hot Shot, Red Alert and Scavenger attacked Megatron and knocked him into Unicron&#x27;s mouth, where he was devoured alive.(Transformers: Armada #18 )

The origin of &quot;Energon&quot; Megatron was different in the Dreamwave comics. Although Megatron appeared dead, seemingly devoured by Unicron at the end of the &quot;Armada&quot; comics, it was later revealed that Megatron&#x27;s mind was trapped within Unicron&#x27;s bulk, where he existed undetected by Unicron, slowly building himself a new body. However, he could not move his consciousness into the body without being detected by Unicron.

Megatron would also appear in the Energon promotional comic. On Earth, Megatron, with the aid of Snowcat, Shockwave, Mirage and Demolishor, has cornered Optimus Prime and a wounded Hot Shot. Optimus refused to give up despite the odds. The other Autobot reinforcements were over ten minutes away when Wing Saber arrived. Megatron was shocked to learn the power of Optimus Prime when he Powerlink with Wing Saber and turned back all the Decepticons, and then Megatron himself. The Autobots then arrive and Optimus thanked Wing Saber for his help.

====3H Enterprises====
Plucked from his timeline by the power of Unicron immediately after building the Star Saber, Megatron was thrust together with Grimlock and Optimus Primal to battle Striker and Reptilion. Though his fate was not revealed in the line before its cancellation, &quot;Ask Vector Prime&quot; revealed the continued history of this incarnation of Armada Megatron. Having witnessed the evil of Unicron firsthand, he was more easily convinced to join forces with the Autobots, and did not have to witness Starscream&#x27;s willingness to sacrifice himself. As a result, Starscream stepped up to fill his shoes after Megatron fell during the battle with Unicron, and the Autobots and Decepticons were more fully united when he reappeared as leader of the Terrorcons. Later, during the events of the Unicron Singularity, Megatron would be reformatted into Beast Megatron rather than Galvatron, and eventually face the similarly reformatted Beast Optimus in battle before being destroyed by Vector Prime&#x27;s sword Rhisling.

&quot;Ask Vector Prime&quot; would also feature another alternate Armada Megatron, this one has become Galvatron, who attempted to form an alliance with Megazarak when that Decepticon arrived in his universe. However, after briefly working together and defeating the Autobots and Rodimus&#x27;s Omnicons, Galvatron and his Decepticons were set upon by Megazarak and his Destructicons and destroyed.

====Pack-in comics====
In the second &quot;Transformers: Energon&quot; pack-in comic Prowl, Inferno and Landmine discover some hills on Earth that are rich with Energon and call in to Optimus Prime that they should put an Energon tower up. Optimus warns the Autobots that Decepticon activity has been scanned nearby. Megatron attacks with a horde of Divebomb Terrorcon clones. The Autobots attempt to fight back by having Mirage and Inferno Powerlinx while Landmine goes into brute mode, but they are overwhelmed when Insecticon Terrorcon hordes join in the attack. The Autobots retreat and Megatron takes the Energon for himself.
==Transformers Cinematic Universe==

In the 2007 live-action &quot;Transformers&quot; film, Megatron&#x27;s alternate mode is a Cybertronian jet. The apparent explanation for the departure from his gun form is that director Michael Bay does not want to include any sort of size changing in the transformations, which the writers described as &quot;cheating&quot;. (This significant change in size is known in Transformers fan communities as &quot;mass shifting&quot; and &quot;mass displacement&quot;.) In one of the special features on the DVD, G1 Megatron&#x27;s transformation is likened to Darth Vader turning into his own lightsaber to be wielded by another person. Additionally, Bay states in the DVD that Megatron&#x27;s face was originally different from the one shown in the film, but he asked it to be redesigned due to fans reacting with strong opposition to it once Megatron&#x27;s design was unveiled before the film was completed.

Actor Hugo Weaving provides the voice of Megatron in the first three films. His voice in the series (as well as those of the other voice actors) seems to have been modulated to give it a deeper, growling tone. The original voice of Megatron, Frank Welker, provides his voice for the 2007 and 2009 video games, the exclusive animated prequel and &quot;&quot;.

Like all characters in the film, Megatron was redesigned for purposes of realism and focus on the alien aspect of the Transformer race. However, he still retains some minor aspects of his &quot;Generation 1&quot; design. As shown in the first film, he can transform his right hand into his iconic fusion cannon and his right arm into a steel flail. He can also combine both of his hands to form an more powerful, long-barreled variation of his fusion cannon that functions akin to a sniper rifle. In the second film, after his resurrection, he can transform his right arm into a fusion cannon, coupled with a lobster claw-like blade. In the third film, he uses a handheld version of his fusion cannon, which resembles a human shotgun, specifically a Lupara. In the fourth and fifth film, Megatron (or Galvatron in the fourth film) once again uses a fusion cannon integrated into his right arm, as well as utilizing a handheld sword resembling a Congolese short sword in the fifth film.

According to an early interview with Michael Bay, Megatron stands at tall, but according to his profile in the second issue of the &quot;Transformers UK&quot; comic Megatron stands &quot; tall&quot; and weighs 8.6 tons. Additionally, the magazine and the &quot;Movie Guide&quot; state he is powered by a self-regenerating dark matter power core. Hasbro has now said that Megatron officially stands 35 feet and weighs in at 5.7 metric tons.

===Films===
Megatron appears in &quot;Transformers&quot;. Megatron was the leader of the Decepticons in a war against the Autobots. Megatron has located the AllSpark on Earth, but he crash lands during the Ice Age and becomes frozen due to the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field interfering with Megatron&#x27;s telemetry. Megatron&#x27;s body was discovered by Captain Archibald Witwicky and is transported to the Hoover Dam guarded by Sector 7, a secret government organization that studies Non-Biological Extraterrestrials (N.B.E.), as well as other alien-related activities. 

Megatron was studied, and his technology was reverse-engineered to advance human technology. Megatron&#x27;s location, as well as the AllSpark&#x27;s, is located by a group of Decepticons led by Starscream. Frenzy thaws out Megatron, who escapes outside and learns from Starscream that the humans and the Autobots have taken the Allspark. Megatron pursues the Autobots and their allies where he kills Jazz before battling Optimus Prime. After being weakened by human fighter jets, Megatron attempts to seize the AllSpark, but Sam Witwicky shoves it into his exposed spark chamber, killing him. Megatron&#x27;s body is later dumped into the Laurentian Abyss, along with the other dead Decepticons.

In &quot;&quot;, he is revealed to be the Fallen&#x27;s disciple, the first Decepticon. Megatron is revived by Scalpel and the Constructicons with an AllSpark shard. He then flies to the Nemesis, where he is greeted by Starscream and then reunites with the Fallen, telling of the AllSpark&#x27;s demise before being told by his master that its knowledge (which has been passed on to Sam) is the key for providing Energon, which the Decepticons need to awaken their protoform armies. Sam, his girlfriend Mikaela Banes, and his dorm mate Leo Spitz are abducted by Grindor. Before the Decepticons can extract Sam&#x27;s brain, the Autobots rescue them. Megatron chases after Optimus and Sam in a forest, with Starscream and Grindor joining the battle. Megatron kills Prime but then is forced to escape due to the intervention of Autobot reinforcements.

Megatron and Starscream soon arrive in Egypt, and he commands his Decepticons to prevent Sam from getting the Matrix of Leadership to Optimus and retrieve it for the Fallen&#x27;s machine. He then summons Devastator, who destroys the top part of the Great Pyramid of Giza, revealing the Star Harvester. The Fallen soon arrives and takes the Matrix from a recently revived Optimus. Jetfire sacrifices himself to give Optimus his parts, and then Megatron, and the Fallen battle Optimus. Optimus severely wounds Megatron and kills the Fallen. With his master dead, Starscream advises that they should retreat. Megatron does so but vows that the war isn&#x27;t over.

Megatron returns in &quot;&quot;. In the four years since the events of &quot;Revenge of the Fallen&quot;, Megatron has been hiding out in Africa healing his wounds, and taking care of the hatchlings. In the film, it is revealed that Megatron allied himself with Sentinel Prime in an attempt to revitalize Cybertron. Soundwave and Laserbeak inform him of the Autobot&#x27;s discovery of the &quot;Ark&quot; ship on the moon and orders them to kill their human allies. When Sentinel betrays the Autobots, he transport Decepticon forces from the Moon to Earth and invade Chicago. Sentinel overthrows Megatron and becomes the leader of the Decepticons. Megatron is convinced by Carly Spencer that Sentinel will take all of the power and credit for himself. Angered, Megatron turns on Sentinel and severely damages him. When Cybertron is destroyed by the Space Bridge, Megatron proposes a truce to Optimus. Knowing that Megatron would betray him, Optimus refuses and finally kills him.

In &quot;&quot;, despite being destroyed, Megatron&#x27;s mind is still alive inside his severed head. Megatron&#x27;s remains are acquired by KSI, who attempts to forge their own Transformers with &quot;transformium&quot;. Their CEO, Joshua Joyce, forces Brains to download information from Megatron&#x27;s head, which the Decepticon leader silently allows so Joshua will gain the information needed to succeed, which will grant Megatron access to a new body. Megatron then infects and possesses the unit Galvatron. He then pretends to obey orders, only to finally defy his creators at the film&#x27;s climax and accept his new identity as Galvatron and rebirth.

Megatron returns in &quot;&quot;, having discarded his identity as Galvatron. He is in league with Quintessa, the creator of Cybertronians. When Barricade reports that Cade Yeager has received the talisman from the Cybertronian knight Steelbane, he decides to use the TRF (Transformers Reaction Force) to lead him to Cade. Megatron then goes after Cade, but Cade and his companions lure Megatron into a trap, killing all the Decepticons except him, Barricade, and Nitro Zeus. Forced to retreat, Megatron later sends Barricade after Cade and Bumblebee, but his plan is thwarted, and he instead follows Cade, Bumblebee, and Viviane Wembly to the submerged ship of the Knights of Iacon, where Quintessa&#x27;s Staff of Life, once wielded by Merlin, is hidden. When Optimus Prime steals the staff as Nemesis Prime, Megatron steals it himself and takes it to Stonehenge, where he uses it to open a portal that will allow Quintessa to destroy the Earth and face off against the Autobots and Optimus. Megatron is defeated by Optimus and is kicked out of Quintessa&#x27;s chamber.

=== &quot;Transformers One&quot; ===

In &quot;Transformers One&quot; (2024), Megatron reappeared as D-16, voiced by Brian Tyree Henry. As D-16, he is a Energon mining robot with his best friend Orion Pax, and admires the legendary Megatronus Prime. They secretly enter a race organized by Cybertron&#x27;s leader, Sentinel Prime, but lose. While Sentinel is impressed by their stunt, a jealous guard Darkwing, reassigns them to garbage incineration, where they meet B-127. The three discovered a chip among the junk containing a distress message from Alpha Trion, one of the Primes, revealing coordinates to his location on the surface. 

Accidentally taking Elita One with them, they found Alpha Trion alongside the corpses of the other Primes. Alpha Trion reveals that Sentinel betrayed the Primes and has been secretly working for the Quintessons, giving them regular supplies of Energon in exchange for letting him rule Cybertron while removing the miners&#x27; transformation cog to keep them subservient. D-16 was outraged that Sentinel lied to him, and receives his cog to transform into a silver tank. D-16 and his team manage to escape from Sentinel&#x27;s guards, but they are captured by the High Guard, Cybertronians rebelling against Sentinel. D-16 refuses to take orders from anyone else and seized command of them by defeating their leader, Starscream, with a new fusion cannon he transformed. D-16 was growing increasingly aggressive since learning the truth, before Sentinel&#x27;s guards attack and capture D-16, B-127 and half of the High Guard being taken to Iacon for public execution.

D-16 is tortured by Sentinel, upon learning that he took the cog of his idol, Megatronus Prime, before being branded with his symbol. Being rescued by Orion and shown Sentinel evidence of his betrayal, D-16 refuses to spare Sentinel and attempts to execute him in revenge, but is stopped by Orion, who is then mortally injured after taking the shot for Sentinel instead. D-16 lets his anger get the better of him, and decides to betray Orion by dropping him into Cybertron&#x27;s core. After killing Sentinel, D-16 announces his new rule over Cybertron after taking Megatronous&#x27; cog inside Sentinel, renaming himself &quot;Megatron&quot; and commands the High Guard to destroy Iacon. D-16 fought against Elita-1 and B-127, and before he could kill them, Orion Pax is resurrected as &quot;Optimus Prime&quot; and confronts him. Megatron was enraged that Orion was given the Matrix of Leadership and fights him. In a single combat, Optimus defeats him. He was called out for using his new powers to destroy Iacon instead of what Alpha Trion intended, and as punishment, Optimus exiles him and the High Guard. Megatron swore revenge against Optimus before leaving Iacon with the rest of the High Guard. Despite being defeated, Megatron vows to rule Cybertron and renames the High Guard as the Decepticons and declares war on Optimus.

===Animated series===
After the events of the &quot;Revenge of the Fallen&quot; film, Megatron goes into hiding, orchestrating the events from Soundwave getting into NEST headquarters to Lockdown being pursued by Ratchet. Megatron finally reveals himself in &quot;Cyber Missions 4&quot;, when Optimus and Sideswipe track his spark&#x27;s signal, which leads them to an abandoned warehouse. The two realize that Megatron is always one step ahead of them, and Megatron slashes at Sideswipe from behind. Megatron starts dueling Optimus, then Sideswipe joins in with him. Realizing that he is outnumbered, Megatron transforms into tank mode and shoots the roof, which collapses on Optimus and Sideswipe. Megatron gets away but leaves a trail of tank tread marks that lead out of the warehouse.

Megatron returns 8 episodes later in &quot;Cyber Missions #12&quot;, where he and Starscream scheme in the Arctic. He reveals to Starscream that he is aware of his ambitions and will punish him if he ever shows it again. Optimus Prime, who tracked them, soon arrives and combats them. When the rest of Optimus&#x27;s team arrives, Megatron orders Starscream to take care of them, which Starscream agrees to, but not without complaint. Megatron and Starscream are simultaneously defeated, and the Decepticon commander flees after Optimus grants him mercy.

Most of the Decepticons return for the final mission, &quot;Decepticons Attack.&quot; After receiving a signal from Soundwave emitting from a bullet train, Megatron arrived on the other side of the tunnel the train was emerging from and derailed it. Ripping open one of the cars, Megatron berated Soundwave for being captured so easily, until it was revealed it was simply a hologram of his communications officer. Megatron declared it a trap, to which Optimus replied that it was a moment later. The Autobots and Decepticons battled for one last time, with Optimus telling Megatron that his alliances were made out of fear, not friendship. The Decepticons are then cornered by the human troops. Optimus Prime then demands that all Decepticons leave Earth. All of the Decepticons, including Megatron, leave Earth, but not before the commander declares that he &quot;will&quot; return.

===Books===
Megatron appears in the prequel novel &quot;&quot;, where it is revealed that reverse-engineering of his body has produced a spacecraft called &quot;Ghost-1&quot;. The spacecraft is sent into space in 1969, where the humans on board encounter Megatron (here referred to throughout as the &quot;ice man&quot;), who is briefly reanimated in the middle of a battle between the Americans and the Soviets. However, he is placed in cryo-stasis once again.

The children&#x27;s book &quot;Transformers – Meet The Decepticons&quot;, by Jennifer Frantz, has a slightly different ending than the movie. This book has all six Decepticons leaving Earth together after being defeated by the Autobots, instead of having most of their numbers die.

The novelization for &quot;Transformers: Dark of the Moon&quot; ends with Megatron laying down his weapons and calling for a truce in earnest. Optimus Prime spares him and the Decepticons leave Earth to rebuild Cybertron.

In the novel, comic, and adaptations of &quot;Revenge of the Fallen&quot;, the slightly different ending gives more depth to Megatron&#x27;s relationship with the Fallen. The Fallen prepares for the final battle with Optimus Prime, it is revealed that the Fallen&#x27;s promises of power to his apprentice were lies. Out of anger, Megatron betrays the Fallen and allows Optimus to kill him for good. He then flies back aboard the &quot;Nemesis&quot; to take command of the remaining Decepticon army.
In the novel version of &quot;Dark of the Moon&quot;, Optimus and Megatron work together and defeat Sentinel Prime. Though a fight was teased, Megatron reveals to Optimus he is tired of fighting and is suing for peace. He declares he will work to restore Cybertron to its previous glory and will send for the Autobots, so that they may rebuild their planet, as brothers.

===Comics===
====IDW Publishing====
The back story of Megatron is told in both &quot;Transformers: Defiance&quot; and issue #1 of the &quot;&quot; comic. In the comics, Megatron is revealed to have co-ruled Cybertron together with Optimus Prime, serving as Lord High Protector. Megatron and Optimus learned of an alien force coming to their planet for the Allspark, just as a mysterious artifact was unearthed. Megatron is gravely injured, but the artifact (containing the Fallen) awakens and heals him, swaying him with promises of power. Megatron soon desires power over the Allspark, and under the Fallen&#x27;s influence, forms the Decepticons, sending the bulk of his soldiers in a craft, the &quot;Nemesis&quot;.

The Autobots attempt to hide the Allspark, but Megatron sees through the ruse and launches a full-scale attack, during which the Allspark is launched into space. Megatron almost catches up with the Allspark as it lands on Earth. In his reckless desire to possess it, Megatron pursues it right into Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and falls into the icy waters, resulting in his being frozen in stasis lock. In the late 19th century, Captain Archibald Witwicky discovers the Decepticon during an Arctic expedition. At the turn of the 20th century, a crew of men later take his body—dubbing him the &quot;ice man&quot;—and keep him in storage up until the present day, eventually relocating him to Hoover Dam in Nevada.

In a flashback in the movie sequel comic &quot;&quot;, Megatron&#x27;s negative relationship with Starscream is shown to be a result of Starscream failing on a mission.

====Titan Magazines====
All events that take place in the alternate reality where Megatron won the battle at Mission City are in italics.

In Titan Magazines&#x27; &quot;Transformers&quot; magazine, the UK-originated strips (written by Simon Furman) reveal Megatron&#x27;s actions between issues #1 and 2 of the IDW comic. Pursuing the Allspark into space following the events of &quot;Movie Prequel&quot; #1, Megatron is delayed in his pursuit by a tractor beam from Cybertron. Breaking free and attacking the culprits—Jazz, Ratchet, and Ironhide—Megatron realizes that if he engages them, he would be delayed further. Summoning Devastator to deal with them, he resumes his pursuit—but the desperate gamble works and he (temporarily) loses the Allspark&#x27;s trail.

The character profile the magazine provided sheds a little more light on Megatron&#x27;s desire to possess the Allspark. He believes that while Cybertronians could already transform into other forms via a scanning process, the Allspark could allow Transformers to simply imagine the form they want and change accordingly. Interfacing with the Allspark directly, Megatron gains his deadly jet mode and begins his plans to obtain it permanently.

In &quot;Twilight&#x27;s Last Gleaming&quot; part 3, Bumblebee attempts to take on Megatron in the Sector 7 base as Mikaela attempts to free Optimus Prime, but she is attacked by Frenzy. In part 4, Mikaela frees Prime and freezes Frenzy just as Autobot reinforcements arrive and assist Bumblebee in fighting Megatron.

====Cybertron&#x27;s Most Wanted====
Yet another version of Megatron was featured in BotCon&#x27;s 2015 &quot;Cybertron&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot; storyline. This version featured a history virtually identical to that of the Megatron of the films, up until the final battle of &quot;Dark of the Moon.&quot; At this point, some force intervened to save Megatron from Optimus&#x27;s killing blow, allowing Megatron to kill not only Optimus but Sentinel Prime as well. After rebuilding himself and conquering Earth, Megatron set out to reclaim Cybertron, only to be forced to contend with a new Autobot leader who proved to be an even more dangerous foe than Optimus: Rodimus Prime. Defeated and left hanging from the edge of a spacebridge, Megatron chose to abandon himself to fate rather than allow Rodimus to kill him, and wound up in the interdimensional city of Axiom Nexus, despite restrictions put in place by the Transtech to prevent versions of Megatron from taking up residence there. He soon formed a new gang of criminals including Maximal thief Packrat, Decepticon Triple-Changer Battletrap, Shattered Glass Autobot Stepper, and a trio of Microns.

====Sector 7 Adventures: The Battle at Half Dome====
In the &quot;Bumblebee movie&quot; tie-in comic, Megatron was frozen at the Igloo foreshadowing his appearance in The 2007 film

==Transformers: Animated==

Megatron&#x27;s Cybertronian design hearkens to the movie version but with more human-like features, while his Earth design bears similarities to the &quot;Super Megatron&quot; form of his G1 incarnation. He wields his trademark fusion cannon (which is much larger than usual in this series) and carries a pair of swords. Early artwork depicted them as katana, but this was later changed. His original alternate mode is an unknown Cybertronian space vehicle but becomes a tiltrotor aircraft once he is rebuilt to blend in with Earth.

===Animated series===
In this series, Megatron has his own catchphrase: &quot;Decepticons, transform and rise up!&quot;, contrasting Optimus Prime&#x27;s classic &quot;Autobots, transform and roll out!&quot; line. A marked contrast between this and other series is that Megatron and Optimus Prime&#x27;s antagonism is not personal: before their first battle, they had never met, and they continue to clash on the basis that they are on opposite sides rather than on any particular personal hatred. Megatron does not even bother to remember Optimus&#x27;s name until the series finale. Unlike several other series, Megatron does not upgrade into Galvatron (though a character named Cyclonus appears in season 3 mentioning a Galvatron), he remains as Megatron for the full three seasons. The scale chart released for the series indicates Megatron stands about tall.

As revealed in &quot;Transform and Roll Out&quot;, Megatron had spent 4 million stellar cycles (years) in search of the Allspark. Even though he found it, Megatron was betrayed at the beginning of the series by Starscream, who planted an explosive device on his back. Due to the explosion that crippled the Autobots craft, Megatron&#x27;s lifeless body crashed on Earth, contracting &quot;space barnacles,&quot; while his disembodied head was found in rural Michigan by a young Isaac Sumdac. Megatron&#x27;s head subsequently became a keystone for Sumdac&#x27;s various robotic creations, which he used to help convert Detroit into a technological metropolis within the next 50 years.

This version is less tolerant of Starscream&#x27;s treachery: after gaining his new body, he uses Sari Sumdac&#x27;s key to slay Starscream, and takes great pleasure in killing him several times once he discovers that Starscream has become immortal due to a shard of the Allspark embedded in his head, and he would later destroy Starscream&#x27;s replacement body, moments after he got it, once the treacherous Decepticon had outgrown his usefulness. Megatron is also the most cool-headed among his other adaptations, despite being just as arrogant as his predecessors. Furthermore, he doesn&#x27;t consider Optimus of any actual importance until the climactic final battle on Earth, where Megatron finally acknowledged him as a threat by name. In the end, Megatron is captured and brought to Cybertron.

After the events of the animated series, Megatron was placed in detention at the Trypticon stronghold in Kaon city. If Cyclonus is to be believed, in the far future, Megatron will become Galvatron, under unknown circumstances, and kill Oil Slick.
==Transtech==

The Megatron of the Transtech world works together with his world&#x27;s Optimus Prime. Shockwave is one of his chief scientific researchers. Shockwave used to work for the renegade Decepticon Jhiaxus as a scientist, but after Jhiaxus was destroyed Shockwave was brought in by Megatron as a prisoner. Initially put on trial for war crimes he was freed by Megatron, who argued to Sentinel Prime that Shockwave&#x27;s mind would be an invaluable asset to them.

===Fun Publications===
In &quot;Withered Hope&quot; Megatron and Optimus Prime heard the pleas of six Gobots whose home dimension was being destroyed, but he wasn&#x27;t interested in helping them.

In &quot;Transcendent&quot; Shockwave kidnapped Breakaway to examine him under the orders of Megatron. After Shockwave discovered that certain systems in Breakaway were unique and might be useful Megatron requested permission from &quot;Transtech&quot; Ratbat to take the Autobot apart, even if it may kill him. When Alpha Trion&#x27;s forces raided the lab to free Skyfall Megatron opposed them, but they escaped to another dimension.

Megatron appeared in &quot;Invasion Prologue&quot; by Fun Publications.
==&quot;Shattered Glass&quot;==

This Megatron, later called Galvatron, is a heroic mirror image of the usual Megatron character from the BotCon exclusive &quot;Shattered Glass&quot; comic, in which the Decepticons are on the side of good and the Autobots on the side of evil. Megatron transforms into a Cybertronian jet. He has a drone partner named Rumbler, who can act as a cannon for Megatron or form a neutronic blade weapon. After nearly being killed in an assassination attempt Megatron was rebuilt by Nexus Prime into Galvatron. According to his Tech Specs Megatron was once a young mathematician who lectured at one of Cybertron&#x27;s most prestigious universities.

===Fun Publications===
In the Fun Publications story &quot;Shattered Glass&quot; Megatron recruits the Autobot Cliffjumper from an alternate reality to aid him against the Autobots of his world. He later leads an attack on the Autobot&#x27;s &quot;Ark&quot; launch site. Megatron appears in &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dinobots&quot;, a text-based story. He defends the Arch-Ayr fuel dump from an Autobot attack. He later sends several of his troops to capture and reprogram the rogue Dinobots built by the mad Autobot scientist Wheeljack.

Megatron is captured by the Autobot Targetmasters in &quot;Do Over&quot;, but is freed thanks to help by the Predacons and Whisper. When confronted by Optimus Prime he attempts to use the Autobot Targetmaster Nightstick to shoot the Autobot leader, but Nightstick takes control of Megatron&#x27;s arm. Megatron then tricks Optimus into using Megatron&#x27;s own weapon to cut Megatron&#x27;s hand off, freeing him from Nightstick. Megatron misses the launch of the Decepticon ship &quot;Nemesis&quot;, which is taken over by Starscream to counter Autobot ship &quot;Ark&quot;.

In &quot;Reunification&quot;, Megatron greets a Quintesson and the dimensional travelers Breakaway, Topspin Skyfall and Landquake after their escape from the Autobot combiner Computron. Megatron introduces the travelers to Heatwave but then is shot by the traitor Cyclonus, who is working for Alpha Trion. The travelers try to combine their powers with Heatwave to return Megatron to life, but instead, have a vision of Skyfall and are combined into Nexus Prime. Nexus Prime resurrects Megatron as Galvatron. Megatron appears in a flashback in &quot;The Coming Storm&quot;, depicting his rebirth as Galvatron by Nexus Prime.

Another character named &quot;Megatron&quot; would appear in the story &quot;Shattered Destiny&quot;, the final chapter of the Beast Wars Shattered Glass comic arc. This version is a heroic counterpart to the Beast Era Megatron. Megatron is a heroic Predacon. Megatron&#x27;s ship, the &quot;Darksyde&quot;, was battling the &quot;Axalon&quot; when it was pulled through an unexpected temporal and dimensional rift and crash-landed on prehistoric Earth. He and his crew disembarked to find Depth Charge outside. Megatron appears to be based on the deluxe-sized Beast Wars 10th-anniversary Megatron toy with Optimus Primal&#x27;s color scheme.
==&quot;Transformers Prime&quot;==

Megatron is the leader of the main group of Decepticons in the 2010 animated robot superhero TV series &quot;&quot;. Megatron started out as a nameless worker, numbered D-16, who took the name Megatronus (after a &quot;mythical&quot; character in Cybertronian history) during his days in the Gladiator ring. His name was shortened to simply Megatron by the chanting crowds at one match, and he took it as his own unique name. He believes that Earth-style forms are beneath him, preferring to hold onto his frequently changed Cybertronian forms. After infusing Dark Energon in his system, Megatron&#x27;s eyes flicker between red and purple. The Generations Megatron toy was picked at the 6th-best toy of 2010 by Topless Robot.

===Animated series===
Megatron was a regular character in the &quot;&quot; animated series, the main antagonist along with Unicron, and one of the main characters in &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;. He is the leader of the Decepticons during the Great War on Cybertron. During the Golden Age on Cybertron, Megatron named himself Megatronus, named after one of the Thirteen, Megatronus Prime. Megatronus was a gladiator in the pits of Kaon, who grew ambitious and saw corruption within the caste system and sought to put an end to it, with his own rule. Megatron began talking with his old friend, Orion Pax, who became a mentor to him. After leaving the gladiatorial arena for the political one, Megatronus saw fit to shorten his name. When &quot;Megatron&quot; was rejected by the Autobot High Council, he waged war on Cybertron and left the planet wasted. Now he and his long story rival, Optimus Prime, battle on the planet Earth for control of the human planet.

Megatron&#x27;s first grand plan was to invade Earth with an army of undead Terrorcons but he himself was gravely wounded, leaving Starscream in charge of the Decepticon army until he was reawakened by Bumblebee who he managed to possess for a brief time where he retook command. Megatron then, however, found himself teaming up with Team Prime, at that time, to counter the threat of Unicron. After Unicron&#x27;s defeat, Megatron found himself both on a mission to retrieve the Iacon relic weapons as well as keep his troops in line from various infighting among the ranks which resulted in a few casualties and several betrayals. Eventually fighting for the restoration of Cybertron and cyberforming of Earth, which was foiled by Optimus, but Megatron had his revenge and used the Nemesis to destroy the Autobot base before setting up the new fortress of Darkmount. Shortly after the destruction of the base Megatron sent massive search parties to find the surviving Autobots and was even given a Predacon to look for them. However, Darkmount was soon destroyed by an all-out attack by the Autobots. Megatron&#x27;s next plan was to create an entire army of Predacons to serve him. However, when his lone beast evolved and transformed, Megatron became fearful of what he was capable of and scrapped it. In the destruction Megatron found the means to restore Cybertron once more with Synthetic Energon, as Megatron&#x27;s plan to rebuild the Omega Lock progressed, the Autobots invaded the Nemesis. As Optimus and Megatron fought, the tyrant was finally killed by Bumblebee.

The series&#x27; finale movie, &quot;Transformers Prime Beast Hunters: Predacons Rising&quot;, though &quot;killed&quot;, Megatron was awakened by Unicron, who took possession of his body and reformatted him with new improvements upon his chassis. Unicron would then inflict eternal suffering upon the warlord as Unicron attempted to kill his brother, Primus, which would also destroy Cybertron, but was freed from the chaos lord by Optimus Prime. Megatron then regained control of his body, but then abandoned any plans of conquest, having realized the true meaning of oppression by Unicron&#x27;s treatment of him. He abandons leading the Decepticons and disbands them as a military force, then flies off into space, presumably as banishment and self-imposed exile for his past actions. Optimus even stated that every sentient being, including Megatron, has the capacity to change for the better.

While Megatron doesn&#x27;t appear in the sequel series, &quot;&quot;, or the spin-off, &quot;&quot;, which is aimed at younger audiences, he is sometimes referenced or mentioned, tying those series into the larger continuity.

===Books===
Megatron appears in the short story &quot;Bumblebee at Tyger Pax&quot; By Alex Irvine. Megatron also appears in the novel &quot;Transformers: Exodus&quot;. It shows that he got his name originated from the original name of the Fallen, Megatronus. He reappears in the sequels &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;. In the novels, he is portrayed as a miner originally known only by the designation D-16 who fought alongside Sentinel Prime and others in resisting the Quintesson occupation of Cybertron. However, the resulting caste system imposed on Cybertron left Megatron on the lower rungs of society, and he eventually became a gladiator. Desiring to establish a new identity for himself and reshape Cybertron, he took the name of Megatronus, which was eventually shortened to Megatron by his followers. He eventually began using his fame as a gladiator to take a political stance, crying for the lower members of Cybertronian society to rise up and claim what was rightfully theirs. In the process of this, he attracted the attention of a data clerk named Orion Pax, who contacted Megatron and began consulting with him regarding their agenda.

Megatron&#x27;s followers soon began launching terrorist attacks which he denied involvement in, and he arranged through Orion to appear before the High Council of Cybertron. There Megatron argued for the destruction of the old system, while Orion called for reform; it was after their appeals that the Council renamed Orion, dubbing him Optimus Prime and charging him with seeking out the Matrix of Leadership. Enraged by this ruling, Megatron and his Decepticons declared war against Optimus and his Autobot adherents. The conflict devastated much of Cybertron, and in his quest for an advantage, Megatron learned of the existence of Dark Energon. Utilizing this new power, the Decepticons began to gain ground, and Megatron sought a means of infecting all of Cybertron with the substance to ensure an unending supply. In the process, he was forced to face Sentinel Prime, whom his forces had previously held prisoner, and Starscream, who made a bid to take over the Decepticons. After mortally wounding Sentinel and humbling Starscream into continued subservience, Megatron succeeded in defeating Omega Supreme as well as infecting Cybertron with Dark Energon. The Autobots managed to remove the taint, but Optimus Prime and many of his forces departed Cybertron in the &quot;Ark&quot; to give the planet time to heal, prompting Megatron to give chase in his &quot;Nemesis&quot; battleship.

Megatron and his forces pursued the &quot;Ark&quot; to Velocitron, where he made contact with a local Decepticon faction alerted to his impending arrival by a Decepticon double-agent amongst the Autobots. Continuing on, they arrived on the planet Junkion, where they discovered the Requiem Blaster, Megatronus Prime&#x27;s long-lost weapon of mass destruction. Recovering the weapon from within the planet, the Decepticons attached it to the &quot;Nemesis&quot; and engaged the Autobots in battle. However, the Requiem Blaster proved too powerful to utilize more than once, prompting the Decepticons to jettison it. After dueling Optimus Prime, who wielded the legendary Cyber Caliber, Megatron was confronted by another member of the Thirteen: Nexus Prime. During his battle with Optimus, he briefly saw into his opponent&#x27;s mind and got a sense of the direction in which to seek the Allspark, a legendary artifact jettisoned from Cybertron by Optimus to keep it out of Megatron&#x27;s hands. Megatron and his forces set out in search of it but ran afoul of a crew of Star Seeker pirates led by Thundertron, who engaged the Decepticons in a heated battle before withdrawing.

The supposed Allspark signal would prove to be a ruse, generated by the Quintessons to lure the Autobots and Decepticons to one of their conquered worlds. Thus, on the planet Aquatron, Megatron, and Optimus were commanded to come to a peace agreement. However, this all proved to be another ruse intended to capture both factions of Transformers and use them to provide power for the Quintessons&#x27; invasion of Cybertron. Megatron and Optimus were forced into another duel and afterward drawn into the sewer-like depths of the Quintesson city. While there, Megatron discovered prophecies about himself recorded by the Sharkticons who had resisted Quintesson slavery in times past. Eventually, he realized these prophecies by taking into his body a facsimile of the Matrix of Leadership, which caused him to take on Sharkticon qualities. Leading the Sharkticons in battle, he fought against the Quintessons and sought to take over their world, only to be defeated by Quintesson-created Sharkticon General Tyrannicon, who stole the Matrix replica from him. The Autobots and Decepticons subsequently departed Aquatron, with their destinies eventually leading them to Earth.

==&quot;Transformers: EarthSpark&quot;==

Megatron appears as a supporting character in the animated series &quot;&quot;, voiced by Rory McCann. This incarnation transforms into an armored tiltrotor and speaks with a Scottish accent, now being an ally with the Autobots, as well as G.H.O.S.T. operative, to protect the people of Earth, human and Cybertronian alike.

==Voice actors==
Megatron is often voiced by Frank Welker, who originally voiced the G1 character, and while Hugo Weaving was chosen to voice Megatron in the first three live-action films, Welker voiced Megatron once again in supporting media and eventually inherited the role in 2017&#x27;s &quot;&quot;. He would later reprise his role as Megatron for the series &quot;&quot;. Eventually, to honor the 40th Anniversary of the Transformers, with the second animated feature film, since 1986&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, actor Brian Tyree Henry landed the role of D-16 later turned into Megatron in the 2024&#x27;s &quot;Transformers One&quot;.

The second most consistent voice actor may be David Kaye, who originally voiced the &quot;Beast Wars&quot; Predacon leader and an alternate version of the Decepticon leader in the Unicron Trilogy.

A number of other voice actors have voiced versions of Megatron such as Garry Chalk, Daniel Riordan, Corey Burton, Fred Tatasciore, Jason Marnocha, Marc Thompson, and Rory McCann, in &quot;Beast Wars&quot; as the original Megatron, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, the &quot;&quot; and the &quot;&quot; video game, and &quot;&quot;, respectively.

==Games==
&quot;Generation 1&quot; Megatron has appeared in numerous &quot;Transformers&quot; video games. Megatron appeared as a final boss in &quot;Transformers Battle Circuit&quot;, a simple Flash-based video game on the Hasbro web site. Megatron appeared as a playable character in the fighting games &quot;Transformers Battle Universe&quot;, a Net Jet game in which four incarnations of the character are playable, and &quot;DreamMix TV World Fighters&quot;, a crossover between various franchises including &quot;Transformers&quot;. The &quot;Generation 1&quot; version of Megatron is offered as a downloadable character for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions of the &quot;&quot; video game. Despite being a distinct playable character, he is also summoned in gun mode by Generation 1 Starscream as an attack move.

&quot;Armada&quot; Megatron is among the characters appearing in the 2004 &quot;Transformers&quot; video game for the PlayStation 2 as a boss.

&quot;Beast Era&quot; Megatron appears in the 1999 Game Boy Color video game &quot;Kettō Transformers Beast Wars: Beast Senshi Saikyō Ketteisen&quot;. He is a playable character in the fighting games &quot;Transformers Battle Universe&quot;, a Net Jet game. He is among the licensed characters in the PC video game &quot;Beast Wars Transformers&quot;.

Megatron, as he appears in the live-action films, is featured in the first film&#x27;s video game adaptation, &quot;&quot;. In the &quot;Autobot Campaign&quot;, Megatron appears at the last cut scene on level three being released from Hoover Dam in the Autobot campaign. He later appears as the final boss and is killed when Optimus Prime shoves the Allspark into his chest. In the &quot;Decepticon Campaign&quot;, Megatron is freed by Starscream and Blackout at the last cut scene when he goes on a rampage through the city looking for Optimus Prime, Sam, and the Allspark. He is also playable on the last mission where Optimus Prime is fought as the final boss. At the end, Optimus appears dead but is then seen sneaking up towards the Allspark. Megatron stops him in his path and kills him with his flail. He then appears in the last cut scene where he rules Earth and orders Barricade, Starscream, Blackout, and Brawl to kill off the rest of the human race.

In &quot;Transformers Autobots&quot;, Megatron fulfills much of the same role as he had in the 2007 film, awakening from stasis towards the climax and ultimately being killed with the Allspark. &quot;Transformers Decepticons&quot; revolves around a power struggle between Megatron and Starscream, who had taken command in his absence. The Decepticons ultimately side with Megatron as the player-created character learns that the true meaning of being a Decepticon is loyalty to Megatron. After all of his men are killed in Starscream&#x27;s bid for power, Megatron battles and kills Starscream for his treachery. Though he has lost the Allspark and his troops, Megatron is nonetheless satisfied, declaring that the weak all deserve to die and only serve to benefit the strong.

Megatron from the films is among the playable characters in the 2009 &quot;&quot; video game by Activision. In the game, he has two modes, Megatron (tank mode) and Megatron Flight (jetpack mode), the latter of which is only used in his fight against the Fallen after being betrayed. Megatron appears as a playable character in the fighting games &quot;Transformers Battle Universe&quot;, a Net Jet game. Megatron is among the characters who appear in the &quot;TRANSFORMERS CVBERVERSE Battle Builder Game&quot;. This interpretation of Megatron is also one of the Decepticons featured in at Universal Studios theme parks. In the ride, Megatron and the Decepticons invade N.E.S.T. headquarters to steal the Allspark shard, but the Autobot Evac acquires it and rushes across the city to keep it away from the Decepticons. Ultimately, in a scene similar to the end of the first film, Evac stabs Megatron in the chest with the Allspark shard, killing the Decepticon leader.

A younger version of &quot;Prime&quot; Megatron appears in the 2010 video game &quot;&quot; voiced by Fred Tatasciore. In the Decepticon Campaign, Megatron fights to return Cybertron to his version of the &quot;golden age&quot; by any means necessary. He discovers a source of all-powerful Dark Energon guarded by Starscream in a research station in orbit. Despite warnings from Starscream and his partner Jetfire that Dark Energon destroys all those who come into contact with it, Megatron obtains it and immerses himself in it, and uses it to power the Decepticon war effort. After Megatron corrupts the Core of Cybertron with Dark Energon, Cybertron begins shutting down to recover from the corruption in &quot;&quot;. Megatron blames Optimus Prime for the death of the planet but is killed by Metroplex. After being revived by Soundwave, Megatron leads his army into space to strip Earth of its resources. Megatron also appears in &quot;&quot;, set in between &quot;War for Cybertron&quot; and &quot;Fall of Cybertron&quot;, in which he attempts to harness the power of the Dark Spark.

Megatron appears as the main antagonist in the 2015 videogame &quot;&quot;. Set during the events of the 1984 series, Megatron seeks to control of the Proudstar so he will command the Insecticons to terraform the Earth into a new Cybertron. Unlike the original series where he transforms into a Walther P38 pistol, he instead turns into a M1 Abrams tank.

==Toys==

The Hasbro toys predate the film and animation versions of the Transformers. Since the character&#x27;s introduction, there have been many toys representing the original &quot;Generation 1&quot; incarnation of Megatron, some of which are adaptations of versions that appeared in narrative media. Additionally, some toy makers have made unlicensed toys in his image, or accessories for the existing toys. The original 1984 Megatron toy was released in Japan as part of Takara&#x27;s Microman line under the name &quot;MC-12 Gun Robo&quot;. The toy&#x27;s characteristics such as the head design and Fusion Cannon have been incorporated in other variants and incarnations of Megatron toys. Today, this toy is on a list of banned items on planes in the U.S., and a special license is required to own this toy in Australia. Despite this, Takara Tomy has reissued this toy numerous times in Japan, mostly to commemorate the anniversary of the Transformers franchise.

Due to stricter laws on toys resembling real weapons, toys of Megatron have undergone different forms of alternate modes such as tanks, cars, and jets. In 2006, Hasbro released the &quot;Classics&quot; Voyager Megatron figure, which transforms into a Nerf Maverick REV-6 replica—the first Megatron toy in over two decades to have a gun mode. Megatron, Shockwave, and Ravage are the three Decepticon figures available to play in the Monopoly Transformers Collectors Edition game.

<doc id="156602" wikidata="Q152230" url="?curid=156602" title="Tiye">
<text>Tiye (c. 1398 BC – 1338 BC, also spelled Tye, Taia, Tiy and Tiyi) was the Great Royal Wife of the Egyptian pharaoh Amenhotep III, mother of pharaoh Akhenaten and grandmother of pharaoh Tutankhamun; her parents were Yuya and Thuya. In 2010, DNA analysis confirmed her as the mummy known as &quot;The Elder Lady&quot; found in the tomb of Amenhotep II (KV35) in 1898.

==Family and early life==
Tiye&#x27;s father, Yuya, was a non-royal, wealthy landowner from the Upper Egyptian town of Akhmim, where he served as a priest and superintendent of oxen or commander of the chariotry. Tiye&#x27;s mother, Thuya, was involved in many religious cults, as her different titles attested (&quot;Singer of Hathor&quot;, &quot;Chief of the Entertainers&quot; of both Amun and Min...), which suggests that she was a member of the royal family.
Egyptologists have suggested that Tiye&#x27;s father, Yuya, was of foreign origin due to the features of his mummy and the many different spellings of his name, which might imply it was a non-Egyptian name in origin. Some suggest that the queen&#x27;s strong political and unconventional religious views might have been due not just to a strong character, but to foreign descent.

Tiye also had a brother, Anen, who was Second Prophet of Amun. Ay, a successor of Tutankhamun as pharaoh after the latter&#x27;s death, is believed to be yet another brother of Tiye, despite no clear date or monument confirming a link between the two. Egyptologists presume this connection from Ay&#x27;s origins (also from Akhmin), because he is known to have built a chapel dedicated to the local god Min there, and because he inherited most of the titles that Tiye&#x27;s father, Yuya, held at the court of Amenhotep III during his lifetime.

Tiye was married to Amenhotep III by the second year of his reign. He had been born of a secondary wife of his father and needed a stronger tie to the royal lineage. Their marriage was celebrated by the issue of commemorative scarabs, announcing Tiye as Great Royal Wife and giving the names of her parents. He appears to have been crowned while still a child, perhaps between the ages of six and twelve. The couple had at least seven, and possibly more, children.
===Issue===
# Sitamun – The eldest daughter, who was elevated to the position of Great Royal Wife around year 30 of her father&#x27;s reign.
# Isis – Also elevated to the position of Great Royal Wife.
# Henuttaneb – Not known to have been elevated to queenship, though her name does appear in a cartouche at least once.
# Nebetah – Sometimes thought to have been renamed Baketaten during her brother&#x27;s reign.
# Crown Prince Thutmose – Crown Prince and High Priest of Ptah, pre-deceasing his father.
# Amenhotep IV/Akhenaten – Succeeded his father as pharaoh, husband of Queen Nefertiti, father of Ankhesenamun, who married Tutankhamun. 
NB * Smenkhkare – has been speculated to be a son to Tiye but in fact primary sources that list her other children make this unlikely. Traditionally seen as one of Akhenaten&#x27;s immediate successors, today some Egyptologists such as Aidan Dodson believe he was the immediate predecessor of Neferneferuaten and a junior co-regent of Akhenaten who did not have an independent reign. Sometimes identified with the mummy from KV55, and therefore Tutankhamun&#x27;s father.
The Younger Lady from KV35 – A daughter of Amenhotep III and Tiye, mother of Tutankhamun and sister-wife of KV55. Presumably one of the already-known daughters of Amenhotep III and Tiye.
Beketaten – Sometimes thought to be Queen Tiye&#x27;s daughter, usually based on reliefs of Baketaten seated next to Tiye at dinner with Akhenaten and Nefertiti. Probably Nebetah who likely changed her name when her brother Akhenaten changed the religion.

==Monuments==
Her husband devoted a number of shrines to her and constructed a temple dedicated to her in Sedeinga in Nubia where she was worshipped as a form of the goddess Hathor-Tefnut. He also had an artificial lake built for her in his Year 12. On the colossal statue now in the Egyptian Museum she is of equal height with her husband. As the American Egyptologists David O&#x27;Connor and Eric Cline note:

==Influence at court==

Tiye wielded a great deal of power during both her husband&#x27;s and son&#x27;s reigns. Amenhotep III became a fine sportsman, a lover of outdoor life, and a great statesman. He often had to consider claims for Egypt&#x27;s gold and requests for his royal daughters in marriage from foreign kings such as Tushratta of Mitanni and Kadashman-Enlil I of Babylon. The royal lineage was carried by the women of Ancient Egypt and marriage to one would have been a path to the throne for their progeny. Tiye became her husband&#x27;s trusted adviser and confidant. Known for her intelligence and strong personality, she was able to gain the respect of foreign dignitaries. Foreign leaders were willing to deal directly with her. She continued to play an active role in foreign relations and was the first Egyptian queen to have her name recorded on official acts.

Tiye may have continued to advise her son, Akhenaten, when he took the throne. Her son’s correspondence with Tushratta, the king of Mitanni, speaks highly of the political influence she wielded at court. In Amarna letter EA 26, Tushratta, corresponded directly with Tiye to reminisce about the good relations he enjoyed with her then deceased husband and extended his wish to continue on friendly terms with her son, Akhenaten.

Amenhotep III died in Year 38 or Year 39 of his reign (1353 BC/1350 BC) and was buried in the Valley of the Kings in WV22; however, Tiye is known to have outlived him by as many as twelve years. Tiye continued to be mentioned in the Amarna letters and in inscriptions as queen and beloved of the king. Amarna letter EA 26, which is addressed to Tiye, dates to the reign of Akhenaten. She is known to have had a house at Akhetaten (Amarna), Akhenaten&#x27;s new capital and is shown on the walls of the tomb of Huya – a &quot;steward in the house of the king&#x27;s mother, the great royal wife Tiyi&quot; – depicted at a dinner table with Akhenaten, Nefertiti, and their family and then being escorted by the king to her &quot;sunshade&quot;. In an inscription approximately dated to November 21 of Year 12 of Akhenaten&#x27;s reign (1338 BC), both she and her granddaughter Meketaten are mentioned for the last time. They are thought to have died shortly after that date. This information is corroborated by the fact that the shrine which Akhenaten created for her—which was later found transported from Amarna to tomb KV55 in Thebes—bore the later form of the Aten&#x27;s name which was only used after Akhenaten&#x27;s Year 9.

If Tiye died soon after Year 12 of Akhenaten&#x27;s reign (1338 BC), this would place her birth around 1398 BC, her marriage to Amenhotep III at the age of eleven or twelve, and her becoming a widow at the age of forty-eight to forty-nine. Suggestions of a co-regency between Amenhotep III and his son Akhenaten lasting for up to twelve years continue, but most scholars today either accept a brief co-regency lasting no more than one year or no co-regency at all.

== Burial and mummy ==

Tiye is believed to have been originally buried in the Royal Tomb at Amarna alongside her son Akhenaten and granddaughter, Meketaten. Evidence shows the two northern pillars of the incomplete pillared hall were removed to accommodate a sarcophagus plinth and pieces of her smashed sarcophagus were found in and around the burial chamber. Analysis of the badly damaged decoration on the left wall beyond the plinth also indicates that Tiye was buried there. In a depiction that closely resembles the mourning of Meketaten in chamber γ, a figure stands beneath a floral canopy while the royal family grieves. The figure wears a queenly sash but cannot be Nefertiti as Nefertiti is shown with the mourners. Tiye&#x27;s sarcophagus was likely contained within multiple nested shrines, like those of her grandson Tutankhamun. The inscription on a portion of such a shrine found in KV55 indicates that Akhenaten had the shrines made for his mother.

Following the move of the capital back to Thebes, Tiye, along with others buried in the royal tomb, were transferred to the Valley of the Kings. The presence of pieces of one of her gilded burial shrines in KV55 indicate she was likely interred there for a time. Provisions had been made during the reign of her husband Amenhotep III for her burial within his tomb, WV22. Shabti figures belonging to her were found in this tomb.

In 1898, three sets of mummified remains were found in a side chamber of the tomb of Amenhotep II in KV35 by Victor Loret. One was an older woman and the other two were a young boy who died at around the age of ten, thought to be Webensenu or Prince Thutmose, and a younger, unknown woman. The three were found lying naked side-by-side and unidentified, having been unwrapped in antiquity by tomb robbers. The mummy of the older woman, who would later be identified as Tiye, was referred to by Egyptologists as the &#x27;Elder Lady&#x27; while the other woman was &#x27;The Younger Lady&#x27;. Several researchers argued that the Elder Lady was Queen Tiye. There were other scholars who were skeptical of this theory, such as British scholars Aidan Dodson and Dyan Hilton, who once stated that &quot;it seems very unlikely that her mummy could be the so-called &#x27;Elder Lady&#x27; in the tomb of Amenhotep II.&quot; 

A nest of four miniature coffins inscribed with her name and containing a lock of hair was found in the tomb of her grandson Tutankhamun – perhaps a memento from a beloved grandmother. In 1976, microprobe analysis conducted on hair samples from the Elder Lady and the lock from the inscribed coffins found the two were a near perfect match, thereby identifying the Elder Lady as Tiye.
By 2010, DNA analysis, sponsored by the Secretary General of the Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquities Zahi Hawass, was able to formally identify the Elder Lady as Queen Tiye. She was found to be about 40–50 years old at the time of her death, and tall. DNA results published in 2020 revealed that Tiye had the mtDNA haplogroup K (as did her mother, Thuya). Tiye&#x27;s father Yuya was found to have the Y-DNA haplogroup G2a and mtDNA haplogroup K.

Her mummy has the inventory number CG 61070. In April 2021 her mummy was moved from the Museum of Egyptian Antiquities to National Museum of Egyptian Civilization along with those of three other queens and 18 kings in an event termed the Pharaohs&#x27; Golden Parade.

<doc id="156604" wikidata="Q82425" url="?curid=156604" title="Brandenburg Gate">
<text>The Brandenburg Gate ( ) is an 18th-century neoclassical monument in Berlin. One of the best-known landmarks of Germany, it was erected on the site of a former city gate that marked the start of the road from Berlin to Brandenburg an der Havel, the former capital of the Margraviate of Brandenburg. The current structure was built from 1788 to 1791 by orders of King Frederick William II of Prussia, based on designs by the royal architect Carl Gotthard Langhans. The bronze sculpture of the quadriga crowning the gate is a work by the sculptor Johann Gottfried Schadow.

The Brandenburg Gate is located in the western part of the city centre within Mitte, at the junction of Unter den Linden and Ebertstraße. The gate dominates the Pariser Platz to the east, while to the immediate west it opens onto the Platz des 18. März beyond which the Straße des 17. Juni begins. One block to the north stands the Reichstag building, home to the German parliament (&quot;Bundestag&quot;), and further to the west is the Tiergarten inner-city park. The gate also forms the monumental entry to Unter den Linden, which leads directly to the former City Palace of the Prussian monarchs (now housing the Humboldt Forum museum), and Berlin Cathedral.

Throughout its existence, the Brandenburg Gate was often a site for major historical events. After World War II and during the Cold War, until its fall in 1989, the gateway was obstructed by the Berlin Wall, and was for almost three decades a marker of the city&#x27;s division. Since German reunification in 1990, it has been considered not only a symbol of the tumultuous histories of Germany and Europe, but also of European unity and peace.

==Description==
The central portion of the gate draws from the tradition of the Roman triumphal arch, although in style it is one of the first examples of Greek Revival architecture in Germany. The gate is supported by twelve fluted Doric columns, six to each side, forming five passageways. There are also walls between the pairs of columns at front and back, decorated with classicizing reliefs of the &quot;Labours of Hercules&quot;. Citizens were originally allowed to use only the outermost two passageways on each side. Its design is based on the Propylaea, the gateway to the Acropolis of Athens, which also had a front with six Doric columns, though these were topped by a triangular pediment.

The central portion is flanked by L-shaped wings on either side, at a lower height, but using the same Doric order. Next to, and parallel with, the gate these are open &quot;stoas&quot;, but the longer sides, stretching beyond the east side, have buildings set back from the columns. These are called &quot;custom houses&quot; for the Berlin Customs Wall, which was in force until 1860, or &quot;gatehouses&quot;.

The Doric order of the gate mostly, but not entirely, follows Greek precedents, which had recently become much better understood by the publication of careful illustrated records. The Greek Doric does not have bases to the columns, and the fluting here follows the Greek style for Ionic and Corinthian columns, with flat fillets rather than sharp arrises between the flutes, and rounded ends to the top and bottom of flutes. The entablature up to the cornice follows Greek precedent, with triglyphs, guttae, metopes, and mutules, except that there are half-metopes at the corners, the Roman rather than Greek solution to the &quot;Doric corner conflict&quot;. The 16 metopes along each of the long faces have scenes from Greek mythology in relief; many echo the Parthenon in showing centaurs fighting men. Statues in niches at the furthest side wall of &quot;Minerva&quot; and &quot;Mars&quot; were added in the 19th century.

After an attic storey that is plain apart from wide steps at the sides receding in both directions, leading, on the east side only, to a large allegorical relief of the &quot;Triumph of Peace&quot;, the figures mostly women and children. Above this there is a second cornice, with a projecting central section. On top of this is a &quot;bronze&quot; sculptural group by Johann Gottfried Schadow of a quadriga—a chariot drawn by four horses—driven by a goddess figure. This was initially intended to represent Eirene, the Greek goddess of peace, but after the Napoleonic Wars was rebranded as Victoria, the Roman goddess of victory, and given an Iron Cross standard with a crowned Imperial eagle perched on top, rather than a wreath. This faces into the city centre. It is the first quadriga group to be made since antiquity, made from copper sheets hammered in moulds; fortunately these moulds were kept, as they would be used more than once to renew the sculpture.

The side wings have plain metopes, and simple angled roofs, ending in gable pediments with a small circular relief in the tympanum.


==History==
===Previous gates===


In the time of King Frederick William I (1688), shortly after the Thirty Years&#x27; War and a century before today&#x27;s Brandenburg Gate was constructed, Berlin was a small walled city within a star fort with several named gates: Spandauer Tor, St. Georgen Tor, Stralower Tor, Cöpenicker Tor, Neues Tor, and Leipziger Tor &quot;(see map)&quot;. Relative peace, a policy of religious tolerance, and status as capital of the Kingdom of Prussia facilitated the growth of the city. With the construction of Dorotheenstadt around 1670 and its inclusion in Berlin&#x27;s city fortifications, a first gate was built on the site, approximately at the level of today&#x27;s Schadowstraße, consisting of a breach through the raised wall and a drawbridge over the dug moat.

With the expansion of Dorotheenstadt to the west and the construction of the Berlin Customs Wall () in 1734, the latter of which enclosed the old fortified city and many of its then suburbs, a predecessor of today&#x27;s Brandenburg Gate was built by the Court Architect Philipp Gerlach as a city gate on the road to Brandenburg an der Havel. The gate system consisted of two Baroque pylons decorated with pilasters and trophies, to which the gate wings were attached. In addition to the ornamental gate, there were simple passages for pedestrians in the wall, which were decorated with ornamental vases at this point.

===18th-century reconstruction===
Frederick William II of Prussia was in his early forties when he came to the throne in 1786. He was determined to establish his capital of Berlin as a cultural centre. The military triumphs of his uncle Frederick the Great had made the Kingdom of Prussia a power that could not be ignored in European politics, but Berlin lacked the monuments and cultural life of Vienna, Paris or London. His uncle&#x27;s tastes had been those typical of his generation, drawing on French classicism and English Palladianism, and his Brandenburg Gate in Potsdam (1770–71) was a much smaller monument, poised between Rococo and a Roman-influenced Neoclassical architecture.

Frederick William II summoned new German architects to Berlin, including Carl Gotthard Langhans from the city of Breslau (today Wrocław in Poland), who was appointed head court architect (&quot;Oberhofbauampt&quot;, or Court Superintendent of Buildings) in 1788. Though he had designed many Neoclassical buildings, this was his first significant work in the Greek style, and his last major one; by 1792 he had designed a small neo-Gothic building for the New Garden in Potsdam. The gate was the first element of a &quot;new Athens on the river Spree&quot; by Langhans.

The gate was originally called the &quot;&quot; or &quot;Peace Gate&quot;; the military victory it celebrated had been very complete, but almost fatality-free, so the name seemed justified. Frederick William II had restored his brother-in-law to power in the Netherlands. But the French Revolution began while construction was underway, and only a few years after it was completed, the Batavian Revolution sent the Dutch royal couple into exile in 1795, the first of many political upheavals throughout the gate&#x27;s history.

===19th and early 20th centuries===
The Brandenburg Gate has played different political roles in German history. After the 1806 Prussian defeat at the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt, Napoleon was the first to use the Brandenburg Gate for a triumphal procession, and took its quadriga to Paris. After Napoleon&#x27;s defeat in 1814 and the Prussian occupation of Paris by General Ernst von Pfuel, the quadriga was restored to Berlin. It was then redesigned by Karl Friedrich Schinkel for the new role of the Brandenburg Gate as a Prussian triumphal arch. The goddess, now definitely Victoria, was equipped with the Prussian eagle and Iron Cross on her lance with a wreath of oak leaves.

The quadriga faces east, as it did when it was originally installed in 1793. Only the royal family was allowed to pass through the central archway, as well as members of the Pfuel family, from 1814 to 1919. The Kaiser granted this honour to the family in gratitude to Ernst von Pfuel, who had overseen the return of the quadriga to the top of the gate. In addition, the central archway was also used by the coaches of ambassadors on the single occasion of their presenting their letters of credence to council.

After 1900, due to weathering and environmental damage, smaller and larger pieces of stone began to fall from the gate. Comprehensive renovation work began in 1913, which had to be interrupted by the outbreak of World War I and was not completed until 1926. Meanwhile, the events of the November Revolution had led to further significant damage, particularly to the quadriga. Indeed, the gate was used as a firing position by government troops during both the Spartacist uprising of January 1919 and the Kapp Putsch in March 1920. The restoration work was carried out on site under the direction of Kurt Kluge. For this purpose, the quadriga was encased in a wooden structure. Berliners spoke of the &quot;highest horse stable in Berlin&quot;, but regardless of the weather, the work could be carried out in the dry without any delay. The numerous sandstone reliefs were restored and partially renovated under the artistic direction of Wilhelm Wandschneider, who remodeled one of the centaur metopes with a different motif.

===Nazi Germany and World War II===

When the Nazis ascended to power, they used the gate as a party symbol. As part of Berlin&#x27;s transformation into the so-called &quot;world capital Germania&quot;, the gate was located on the east–west axis. A seven-kilometer-long section between the Brandenburg Gate and Adolf-Hitler-Platz (today Theodor-Heuss-Platz) was extended and put into operation in 1939. During the further expansion of the east–west axis, which never materialised, one of the plans was to move the side porticos away from the Brandenburg Gate. Traffic would then have been routed not only through, but also around the gate.

The gate survived World War II and was one of the damaged structures still standing in the Pariser Platz ruins in 1945 (another being the Academy of Fine Arts). The gate was badly damaged with holes in the columns from bullets and nearby explosions. One horse&#x27;s head from the original quadriga survived, and is today kept in the collection of the Märkisches Museum. Efforts to disguise the government district of Berlin and confuse Allied bombers had included the construction of a replica Brandenburg Gate located away from the city centre.

===Cold War===
After Germany&#x27;s surrender at the end of the war, the Brandenburg Gate was located in the Soviet occupation zone, directly next to the border to the zone occupied by the British, which later became the border between East and West Berlin. In connection with the East German uprising of 1953, three men took down the red flag on the roof of the Brandenburg Gate and, shortly after noon on 17 June 1953, hoisted the joint black-red-gold flag of East Germany and West Germany. One of the three men, Wolfgang Panzer, probably paid for this action with his life and was never seen again.

On 21 September 1956, the East Berlin magistrates decided to restore the only surviving but damaged former city gate. Despite heated arguments and mutual accusations, both parts of Berlin worked together on the restoration. The holes were patched, but were visible for many years. The quadriga was completely recreated based on a plaster cast from 1942; the reconstruction was carried out by the sculptor Otto Schnitzer and the traditional foundry Hermann Noack in Friedenau. The restoration was completed on 14 December 1957. The Iron Cross standard above the quadriga was replaced by a wreath, as originally intended, but the Iron Cross returned after German Reunification, and remains in place in 2025.

Vehicles and pedestrians could travel freely through the gate until the day after construction began on the Berlin Wall on Barbed Wire Sunday, 13 August 1961. West Berliners gathered on the western side of the gate to demonstrate against the Berlin Wall, among them West Berlin&#x27;s mayor, Willy Brandt, who had returned from a federal election campaign tour in West Germany earlier the same day. The wall passed directly by the western side of the gate, closing it throughout the Berlin Wall period, which ended on 22 December 1989.

===Post-1989===
When the Revolutions of 1989 occurred and the wall was demolished, the gate symbolized freedom and the desire to unify the city of Berlin. Thousands of people gathered at the wall to celebrate its fall on 9 November 1989. On 22 December 1989, the Brandenburg Gate border crossing was reopened when Helmut Kohl, the West German chancellor, walked through to be greeted by Hans Modrow, the East German prime minister. Demolition of the rest of the wall around the area took place the following year. In 1990, the quadriga was removed from the gate as part of renovation work carried out by the East German authorities following the fall of the wall in November 1989. Germany was officially reunified in October 1990.

The Brandenburg Gate was privately refurbished on 21 December 2000, at a cost of €6 million. It was once again opened on 3 October 2002 following extensive refurbishment, for the 12th anniversary of German reunification. On this occasion, the Berlin office of Kardorff Ingenieure developed a new lighting concept that emphasises the gate as the most important building on the Pariser Platz.

The Brandenburg Gate became the main venue for the 20th-anniversary celebrations of the fall of the Berlin Wall or &quot;Festival of Freedom&quot; on the evening of 9 November 2009. The high point of the celebrations was when over 1000 colourfully designed foam domino tiles, each over tall, were lined up along the route of the former wall through the city centre. The domino &quot;wall&quot; was then toppled in stages converging here.

The Brandenburg Gate is now again closed to vehicle traffic, and much of the Pariser Platz has been turned into a cobblestone pedestrian zone. The gate, along with the broad Straße des 17. Juni avenue to the west, is also one of the large public areas in Berlin where over a million people can gather to watch stage shows or party together, watch major sport events shown on huge screens, or see fireworks at midnight on New Year&#x27;s Eve. After winning the 2014 FIFA World Cup, the Germany national football team held their victory rally in front of the gate.

It has also hosted street events at 2009 IAAF World Championships in Athletics and repeated its role in 2018 European Athletics Championships. It is also the usual finish line of the Berlin Marathon.

==Political history==
A Soviet flag flew from a flagpole atop the gate from 1945 until 1957, when it was replaced by an East German flag. Since the reunification of Germany in 1990, the flag and the pole have been removed. During the 1953 riots in East Berlin the Soviet flag was torn off by West Germans.

In 1963, U.S. President John F. Kennedy visited the Brandenburg Gate. The Soviets hung large red banners across it to prevent him looking into East Berlin.

In the 1980s, decrying the existence of two German states and two Berlins, West Berlin mayor Richard von Weizsäcker said: &quot;The German Question is open as long as the Brandenburg Gate is closed.&quot;

On 12 June 1987, U.S. President Ronald Reagan spoke to the West Berlin populace at the Brandenburg Gate, demanding the razing of the Berlin Wall. Addressing the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev, Reagan said, 

On 25 December 1989, less than two months after the Berlin Wall began to come down, the conductor Leonard Bernstein conducted the Berlin Philharmonic in a version of the Ninth Symphony of Beethoven at the then newly opened Brandenburg Gate. In the concluding choral movement of the symphony, the &quot;Ode to Joy&quot;, the word &quot;Freude&quot; (&quot;Joy&quot;) was replaced with &quot;Freiheit&quot; (&quot;Freedom&quot;) to celebrate the fall of the Wall and the imminent reunification of Germany.

On 2–3 October 1990, the Brandenburg Gate was the scene of the official ceremony to mark the reunification of Germany. At the stroke of midnight on 3 October, the black-red-gold flag of West Germany—now the flag of a reunified Germany—was raised over the gate.

On 12 July 1994, U.S. President Bill Clinton spoke at the Brandenburg Gate about peace in post–Cold War Europe.

On 9 November 2009, Chancellor Angela Merkel walked through the Brandenburg Gate with Russia&#x27;s Mikhail Gorbachev and Poland&#x27;s Lech Wałęsa as part of the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall.

On 13 August 2011, Germany marked the 50th anniversary of the day the Berlin Wall began construction with a memorial service and a minute of silence in memory of those who died trying to flee to the West. &quot;It is our shared responsibility to keep the memory alive and to pass it on to the coming generations as a reminder to stand up for freedom and democracy to ensure that such injustice may never happen again,&quot; Berlin Mayor Klaus Wowereit said. German Chancellor Angela Merkel—who grew up behind the wall in Germany&#x27;s communist eastern part—also attended the commemoration. German President Christian Wulff added, &quot;It has been shown once again: Freedom is invincible at the end. No wall can permanently withstand the desire for freedom.&quot;

On 19 June 2013, U.S. President Barack Obama spoke at the Gate about nuclear arms reduction and the recently revealed U.S. internet surveillance activities.

On the night of 5 January 2015, the lights illuminating the gate were completely shut off in protest against a protest held by far-right anti-Islamic group Pegida.

In April 2017, &quot;Die Zeit&quot; noted that the gate was not illuminated in Russian colours after the 2017 Saint Petersburg Metro bombing. The gate was previously illuminated after attacks in Jerusalem and Orlando. The Berlin Senate only allows the gate to be illuminated for events in partner cities and cities with a special connection to Berlin.

In February 2022, the gate was lit up with the colours of the Ukrainian flag, during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. A candlelight vigil was also held in front of the gate on the 31st Independence Day of Ukraine.

==Vandalism==
On 17 September 2023, German climate activists who call themselves the Last Generation used fire extinguishers to spray paint the Brandenburg Gate&#x27;s columns orange. The Last Generation is known for their unorthodox protest tactics, including gluing themselves to roads to block traffic. The mayor of Berlin, Kai Wegner, condemned the tactics, saying they &quot;go beyond legitimate forms of protest.&quot; The mayor went on to say, &quot;With these actions, this group is not only damaging the historic Brandenburg Gate, but also our free discourse about the important issues of our time and future.&quot; Berlin police detained 14 people connected to the vandalism.

<doc id="156605" wikidata="Q1272318" url="?curid=156605" title="Great Northern Railway (U.S.)">
<text>The Great Northern Railway was an American Class I railroad. Running from Saint Paul, Minnesota, to Seattle, Washington, it was the creation of 19th-century railroad entrepreneur James J. Hill and was developed from the Saint Paul &amp; Pacific Railroad. The Great Northern&#x27;s route was the northernmost transcontinental railroad route in the U.S.

In 1970, the Great Northern Railway merged with three other railroads to form the Burlington Northern Railroad, which merged in 1996 with the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway to form the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway.

==History==
The Great Northern was built in stages, slowly creating profitable lines, before extending the road further into undeveloped Western territories. In a series of the earliest public relations campaigns, contests were held to promote interest in the railroad and the ranchlands along its route. Fred J. Adams used promotional incentives such as feed and seed donations to farmers getting started along the line. Contests were all-inclusive, from the largest farm animals to the largest freight carload capacity, and were promoted heavily to immigrants and newcomers from the East.

The very first predecessor railroad to the company was the St. Paul and Pacific Railroad owned by William Crooks. He had gone bankrupt running a small line between St. Paul and Minneapolis. He named the locomotive he ran for himself and the &quot;William Crooks&quot; would be the first locomotive of the Great Northern Railway. J.J. Hill convinced New York banker John S. Kennedy, Norman Kittson (a wealthy fur trader friend), Donald Smith (a Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company executive), George Stephen (Smith&#x27;s cousin and president of the Bank of Montreal), and others to invest $5.5 million in purchasing the railroad. On March 13, 1878, the road&#x27;s creditors formally signed an agreement transferring their bonds and control of the railroad to J.J. Hill&#x27;s investment group. On September 18, 1889, Hill changed the name of the Minneapolis and St. Cloud Railway (a railroad which existed primarily on paper) to the Great Northern Railway. On February 1, 1890, he consolidated his ownership of the StPM&amp;M, Montana Central Railway, and other rail lines to the Great Northern.

The Great Northern had branches that ran north to the Canada–US border in Minnesota, North Dakota, and Montana. It also had branches that ran to Superior, Wisconsin, and Butte, Montana, connecting with the iron range of Minnesota and copper mines of Montana. In 1898 Hill purchased control of large parts of the Mesabi Iron Range in Minnesota and its rail lines. The Great Northern began large-scale shipment of ore to the steel mills of the Midwest.

The railroad&#x27;s best-known engineer was John Frank Stevens, who served from 1889 to 1903. Stevens was acclaimed for his 1889 exploration of Marias Pass in Montana and determined its practicability for a railroad. Stevens was an efficient administrator with remarkable technical skills and imagination. He discovered Stevens Pass through the Cascade Mountains, set railroad construction standards in the Mesabi Range, and supervised the construction of the Oregon Trunk Line. He then became the chief engineer of the Panama Canal.

The logo of the railroad, a Rocky Mountain goat, was based on a goat William Kenney, one of the railroad&#x27;s presidents, had used to haul newspapers as a boy.

Locomotives and passenger cars were repaired and overhauled at the shops in St. Paul, Minnesota, while the shops at nearby St. Cloud were dedicated to freight cars beginning in 1890. In 1892, a new shop site was established five miles west of Spokane, Washington in Hillyard (named after James Hill) to serve the western half of the GN system. 

===Mainline===
The mainline began at Saint Paul, Minnesota, heading west along the Mississippi River bluffs, crossing the river to Minneapolis on a massive multi-piered stone arch bridge just below the Saint Anthony Falls. The bridge ceased to be used as a railroad bridge in 1978, becoming a pedestrian river crossing with excellent views of the falls and of the lock system. The mainline headed northwest from the Twin Cities, across North Dakota and eastern Montana. The line then crossed the Rocky Mountains at Marias Pass. It then followed the Flathead River and then Kootenai River to Bonners Ferry, Idaho, south to Sandpoint, Idaho, west to Newport, Washington, and then to Spokane, Washington. The company town and extensive railroad facility of Hillyard, Washington was named after James J. Hill and briefly manufactured the R Class 2-8-8-2 around 1927 which was the largest steam locomotive in the world at the time. From there the mainline crossed the Cascade Mountains through the Cascade Tunnel under Stevens Pass, reaching Seattle, Washington, in 1893, with the driving of the last spike at Scenic, Washington, on January 6, 1893. The Great Northern electrified Steven&#x27;s Pass and briefly owned the electric Spokane and Inland Empire Railway. The deadliest avalanche in US history swept two Great Northern trains off the tracks at Wellington, Washington by the Cascade Tunnel killing 96 people.

The mainline west of Marias Pass has been relocated twice. The original route over Haskell Pass, via Kalispell and Marion, Montana, was replaced in 1904 by a more circuitous but flatter route via Whitefish and Eureka, joining the Kootenai River at Rexford, Montana. A further reroute was necessitated by the construction of the Libby Dam on the Kootenai River in the late 1960s. The United States Army Corps of Engineers built a new route through the Salish Mountains, including the Flathead Tunnel, second-longest in the United States, to relocate the tracks away from the Kootenai River. This route opened in 1970. The surviving portions of the older routes (from Columbia Falls to Kalispell and Stryker to Eureka), were operated by Watco as the Mission Mountain Railroad until April 1, 2020, when BNSF (GN&#x27;s modern successor) took back control of the Kalispell to Columbia Falls section.

The Great Northern mainline crossed the continental divide through Marias Pass, the lowest crossing of the Rockies south of the Canada–US border. Here, the mainline forms the southern border of Glacier National Park, which the GN promoted heavily as a tourist attraction. GN constructed stations at East Glacier and West Glacier entries to the park, stone and timber lodges at the entries, and other inns and lodges throughout the Park. Many of the structures have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places due to unique construction, location, and the beauty of the surrounding regions.

In 1931, the GN also developed the &quot;Inside Gateway&quot;, a route to California that rivaled the Southern Pacific Railroad&#x27;s route between Oregon and California. The GN route was further inland than the SP route and ran south from the Columbia River in Oregon. The GN connected with the Western Pacific at Bieber, California; the Western Pacific connected with the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe in Stockton, California, and together the three railroads (GN, WP, and ATSF) competed with Southern Pacific for traffic between California and the Pacific Northwest. With a terminus at Superior, Wisconsin, the Great Northern was able to provide transportation from the Pacific to the Atlantic by taking advantage of the shorter distance to Duluth from the ocean, as compared to Chicago.

===Branch lines in Fraser Valley, British Columbia, Canada===
Between 1891 and 1917 GNR built a number of railway branch lines across the border with Canada. These lines were built to provide service to the city of New Westminster, Victoria (via ferry connection) and the new city of Vancouver. The first line was built between 1891 and 1893 providing a connection between Seattle and New Westminster. This line crossed at Blaine, passed through Cloverdale and terminated in Brownsville. In 1903 GNR constructed a line running from Cloverdale to Port Guichon (Present day Ladner, BC). A ferry service from the port provided service to Victoria and Vancouver Island. In 1909 this line was extended from Cloverdale to Huntingdon. Service from Blaine to New Westminster was redirected in 1909 over a new line past White Rock, across Mud Bay, through Annieville and on to Brownsville. After a new railway bridge was completed across the Fraser River from Brownsville to New Westminster the GNR extended its railway line to Vancouver. Between 1910 and 1913 GNR excavated the Grandview Cut to give it access to False Creek and used the resulting dirt to fill in the east end of False Creek. In 1915, on this infill, the GNR opened Union Station, the terminus of its rail line in Vancouver. Its service to Vancouver and Victoria experienced competition from a partnership between Northern Pacific and Canadian Pacific. This competing service terminated at Pacific Station in Downtown Vancouver and from there offered direct steamship service to Victoria, thus offering a superior alternative to both services offered by GNR.

===Settlements===
The Great Northern energetically promoted settlement along its lines in North Dakota and Montana, especially by Germans and Scandinavians from Europe. The Great Northern bought its lands from the federal government it received no land grants and resold them to farmers one by one. It operated agencies in Germany and Scandinavia that promoted its lands, and brought families over at low cost, building special colonist cars to transport immigrant families. The rapidly increasing settlement in North Dakota&#x27;s Red River Valley along the Minnesota border between 1871 and 1890 was a major example of large-scale &quot;bonanza&quot; farming.

===Later history===

During World War II, the Army moved its Military Railway Service (MRS) headquarters to Fort Snelling, Minnesota. The MRS worked collaboratively with commercial railroading in the U.S. The Great Northern sponsored the 704th Grand Railroad Division. It was the second Grand Division that the Army stood up. The Great Northern also sponsored the 732nd Railroad Operating Battalion (ROB). They were one of two ROBs. The 732nd operated in support of the Patton&#x27;s 3rd Armored Division crossing into Germany with them. The Officers of the 732nd were all previous employees of the Great Northern.

On March 2, 1970, the Great Northern, together with the Northern Pacific Railway, the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad and the Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway, merged to form the Burlington Northern Railroad. The BN operated until 1996 when it merged with the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway to form the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway.

== Passenger service ==

GN operated various passenger trains, but the &quot;Empire Builder&quot; was their premier passenger train. It was named in honor of James J. Hill, known as the &quot;Empire Builder.&quot; Amtrak still operates the &quot;Empire Builder&quot; today, running it over the old Great Northern&#x27;s Northern Transcon north of St. Paul. The GN had commuter service in the Minneapolis area running between Great Northern Depot and Hutchinson.

===Rails to Trails===
In addition to the Stone Arch Bridge, parts of the railway have been turned into pedestrian and bicycle trails. In Minnesota, the Cedar Lake Trail is built in areas that were formerly railroad yards for the Great Northern Railway and the Minneapolis and St. Louis Railway. Also in Minnesota, the Dakota Rail Trail is built on 26.5 miles of the railroad right-of-way. In Kalispell, Montana the original Great Northern grade from 1892 has been converted into a trail. The trail starts in Kila, MT, and goes to Kalispell Montana, travelling through downtown, right past the Kalispell Depot. The section of rails from Kila to West Kalispell was taken out in the early 1900s, while the section from downtown to where the current end of rail is, was taken out in 2021. Further west, the Iron Goat Trail in Washington follows the late 19th-century route of the Great Northern Railway through the Cascades and gets its name from the railway&#x27;s logo. The Spokane and Inland Empire Railroad that James J. Hill purchased in 1929 became a bicycle path between Spokane, Wa and Coeur d&#x27;Alene, Id. and Spokane, Wa. and Pullman, Wa.

== In popular culture ==

Appearances in popular culture:

* The Great Northern Railway is considered to have inspired (in broad outline, not in specific details) the Taggart Transcontinental railroad in Ayn Rand&#x27;s &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot;.
* The song &quot;Great Northern&quot; by the Western band Riders In The Sky featured on their 2002 album &quot;Ridin&#x27; The Tweetsie Railroad&quot; describes a journey along the Great Northern Railway.

The Great Northern is mentioned in the song &quot;Jack Straw,&quot; written by Bob Weir and Robert Hunter and originally performed by The Grateful Dead.

<doc id="156606" wikidata="Q351838" url="?curid=156606" title="Arthur Kennedy">
<text>John Arthur Kennedy (February 17, 1914January 5, 1990) was an American stage and film actor known for his versatility in supporting film roles and his ability to create &quot;an exceptional honesty and naturalness on stage&quot;, especially in the original casts of Arthur Miller plays on Broadway. He won the 1949 Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play for Miller&#x27;s &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot;. He also won the Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor for the 1955 film &quot;Trial&quot;, and was a five-time Academy Award nominee.

== Early life and education ==
Kennedy was born on February 17, 1914, in Worcester, Massachusetts, the son of Helen (née Thompson) and John Timothy &quot;J.T.&quot; Kennedy, a dentist. He attended South High School, Worcester, and graduated from Worcester Academy. He studied drama at the Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, graduating with a B.A. in 1934.

==Career==
Kennedy moved to New York City and, billed as John Kennedy, joined the Group Theatre. He then toured with a classical repertory company. In September 1937, he made his Broadway debut as Bushy in Maurice Evans&#x27; &quot;Richard II&quot; at the St. James Theatre. In 1939 he played Sir Richard Vernon in Evans&#x27; &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot;.

Kennedy&#x27;s first film role was of James Cagney&#x27;s younger brother in &quot;City for Conquest&quot; in 1940. He appeared in many Western films and police dramas.

Kennedy appeared in many notable films from the early 1940s through mid-1960s, including &quot;High Sierra&quot;, &quot;Champion&quot;, &quot;They Died with Their Boots On&quot;, &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot;, &quot;The Desperate Hours&quot;, &quot;Trial&quot;, &quot;Peyton Place&quot;, &quot;Some Came Running&quot;, &quot;A Summer Place&quot;, &quot;Elmer Gantry&quot;, &quot;The Man from Laramie&quot;, &quot;Barabbas&quot;, &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;, &quot;Nevada Smith&quot; and &quot;Fantastic Voyage&quot;.

Of Kennedy&#x27;s film work, he is perhaps best-remembered for his collaborations with director Anthony Mann and co-star James Stewart on &quot;Bend of the River&quot; (1952) and &quot;The Man from Laramie&quot; (1955), in both of which he played sympathetic villains. 

He also enjoyed a distinguished stage career over the same period, receiving a Tony Award for his role of Biff Loman in Arthur Miller&#x27;s &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot; (1949). He inaugurated three other major characters in Miller plays: Chris Keller in &quot;All My Sons&quot; (1947), John Proctor in &quot;The Crucible&quot; (1953) and Walter Franz in &quot;The Price&quot; (1968). In 1961 he played the title role in &quot;Becket&quot;, opposite Laurence Olivier as Henry II.

On February 5, 1959, Kennedy appeared on the episode &quot;Make It Look Good&quot; of CBS&#x27;s &quot;Dick Powell&#x27;s Zane Grey Theatre&quot;.

In 1974, Kennedy was a regular on the short-lived ABC police drama &quot;Nakia&quot;, as Sheriff Sam Jericho.

=== Waning interest, ill-health, then comeback ===

With the death of his wife in 1975, failing eyesight, alcoholism, and thyroid cancer, Kennedy was reported as having lost interest in filmmaking. After &quot;Covert Action&quot; (1978), his next films were &quot;The Humanoid&quot; (1979) and &quot;Signs of Life&quot; (1989).

== Awards and honors ==

In 1949, Kennedy won a Tony Award for best supporting actor as Biff in Arthur Miller&#x27;s &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot; at the Morosco Theatre.

The New York Film Critics named him Best Actor for &quot;Bright Victory&quot; (1951).

His performance in &quot;Trial&quot; won him a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor.

His portrayal of the newspaper reporter in &quot;Elmer Gantry&quot; (1960) gained him a Film Daily Award and a Limelight Award.

=== Oscar nominations ===

==Personal life==
Kennedy married Mary Cheffey in March 1938. They had two children: actress Laurie Kennedy and Terence.

==Death==

During the last years of his life, Kennedy had thyroid cancer and eye disease. He spent much of his later life in Savannah, Georgia, out of the public eye. He died of cancer on January 5 1990 at age 75.

<text>Nefertari, also known as Nefertari Meritmut, was an Egyptian queen and the first of the Great Royal Wives (or principal wives) of Ramesses the Great. She is one of the best known Egyptian queens, among such women as Cleopatra, Nefertiti, and Hatshepsut, and one of the most prominent not known or thought to have reigned in her own right. She was highly educated and able to both read and write hieroglyphs, a very rare skill at the time. She used these skills in her diplomatic work, corresponding with other prominent royals of the time. Her lavishly decorated tomb, QV66, is one of the largest and most spectacular in the Valley of the Queens. Ramesses also constructed a temple for her at Abu Simbel next to his colossal monument there.

==Translation of name==
There are different interpretations of the meaning of the name Nefertari. Nefertari means &#x27;beautiful companion&#x27; and Meritmut means &#x27;Beloved of the goddess Mut&#x27;. Some sources consider a more accurate translation for Nefertari as &quot;the most beautiful one&quot;, &quot;the most beautiful of them&quot;, &quot;the most beautiful one of them all&quot; &quot;the most beautiful (one) among them&quot;, &quot;the very best&quot;, or &quot;the most beautiful of the women&quot;.

== Titles ==

Nefertari held many titles, including: Great of Praises (&quot;wrt-hzwt&quot;), Sweet of Love (&quot;bnrt-mrwt&quot;), Lady of Grace (&quot;nbt-im3t&quot;), Great King&#x27;s Wife (&quot;hmt-niswt-wrt&quot;), his beloved (&quot;hmt-niswt-wrt meryt.f&quot;), Lady of The Two Lands (&quot;nbt-t3wy&quot;), Lady of all Lands (&quot;hnwt-t3w-nbw&quot;), Wife of the Strong Bull (&quot;hmt-k3-nxt&quot;), god&#x27;s Wife (&quot;hmt-ntr&quot;), Mistress of Upper and Lower Egypt (&quot;hnwt-Shm’w-mhw&quot;). Ramesses II also named her &#x27;The one for whom the sun shines&#x27;. 

==Family==

Although Nefertari&#x27;s family background is unknown, the discovery in her tomb of a knob inscribed with the cartouche of Pharaoh Ay has led people to speculate she was related to him. The time between the reign of Ay and Ramesses II means that Nefertari could possibly not have been a daughter of Ay, though she could have had all her children in her early to mid-30s, and, if any relation exists at all, she would be a great-granddaughter. There is no conclusive evidence linking Nefertari to the royal family of the 18th Dynasty, however. 
Nefertari married Ramesses II before he ascended the throne. Nefertari had at least four sons and two daughters. Amun-her-khepeshef, the eldest, was Crown Prince and Commander of the Troops, and Pareherwenemef would later serve in Ramesses II&#x27;s army. Prince Meryatum was elevated to the position of High Priest of Re in Heliopolis. Inscriptions mention he was a son of Nefertari. Prince Meryre is a fourth son mentioned on the façade of the small temple at Abu Simbel and is thought to be another son of Nefertari. Meritamen and Henuttawy are two royal daughters depicted on the façade of the small temple at Abu Simbel and are thought to be daughters of Nefertari.

Princesses named Bak(et)mut, Nefertari, and Nebettawy are sometimes suggested as further daughters of Nefertari based on their presence in Abu Simbel, but there is no concrete evidence for this supposed family relation.

== Biography ==

Nefertari first appears as the wife of Ramesses II in official scenes during the first year of Ramesses II. In the tomb of Nebwenenef, Nefertari is depicted behind her husband as he elevates Nebwenenef to the position of High Priests of Amun during a visit to Abydos. Nefertari also appears in a scene next to a year 1 stela. She is depicted shaking two sistra before Taweret, Thoth, and Nut.

Nefertari is an important presence in the scenes from Luxor and Karnak. In a scene from Luxor, Nefertari appears leading the royal children. Another scene shows Nefertari at the Festival of the Mast of Amun-Min-Kamephis. The king and the queen are said to worship in the new temple and are shown overseeing the Erection of the Mast before Amen-Re attended by standard bearers. Nefertari&#x27;s speech during this ceremony is recorded: 
Your beloved son, the Lord of Both Lands, Usermaatre Setepenre, has come to see you in your beautiful manifestation. He has erected for you the mast of the (pavilion)-framework. May you grant him eternity as King, and victory over those rebellious (against) His Majesty, L.P.H. 

Nefertari appears as Ramesses II&#x27;s consort on many statues in both Luxor and Karnak. In Western Thebes, Nefertari is mentioned on a statuary group from Deir el-Bahari, a stela and blocks from Deir el-Medina.

The greatest honor was bestowed on Nefertari however in Abu Simbel. Nefertari is depicted in statue form at the great temple, but the small temple is dedicated to Nefertari and the goddess Hathor. The building project was started earlier in the reign of Ramesses II, and seems to have been inaugurated by ca year 25 of his reign (but not completed until ten years later).

Nefertari&#x27;s prominence at court is further supported by cuneiform tablets from the Hittite city of Hattusas (today Boghazkoy, Turkey), containing Nefertari&#x27;s correspondence with the king Hattusili III and his wife Puduhepa. She is mentioned in the letters as &quot;Naptera.&quot; Nefertari is known to have sent gifts to Puduhepa:

The great Queen Naptera of the land of Egypt speaks thus: Speak to my sister Puduhepa, the Great Queen of the Hatti land. I, your sister, (also) be well!! May your country be well. Now, I have learned that you, my sister, have written to me asking after my health. ... You have written to me because of the good friendship and brotherly relationship between your brother, the king of Egypt, The Great and the Storm god will bring about peace, and he will make the brotherly relationship between the Egptian king, the Great King, and his brother, the Hatti King, the Great King, last for ever... See, I have sent you a gift, in order to greet you, my sister... for your neck (a necklace) of pure gold, composed of 12 bands and weighing 88 shekels, coloured linen maklalu-material, for one royal dress for the king... A total of 12 linen garments. 
Nefertari is shown at the inaugural festivities at Abu Simbel in year 24. Her daughter Meritamen is depicted taking part in place of her mother in some of the scenes. Nefertari may well have been in failing health at this point. After her death she was buried in tomb QV66 in the Valley of the Queens.

== Monuments==

===Abu Simbel, great temple===
Nefertari appears twice as one of the royal women represented beside the colossal statues of Ramesses II that stand before the temple. To the left of the doorway, Nefertari, Queen-Mother Tuya and the king&#x27;s son Amun-her-khepeshef (still called Amunhirwenemef here) flank the colossal statue of the king. To the right of the doorway Nefertari, Baketmut and the king&#x27;s son Ramesses are shown with the Pharaoh.

Inside the temple Nefertari is depicted on one of the pillars in the great pillared hall worshipping Hathor of Ibshek.

On the wall of the inner pillared hall Nefertari appears behind Ramesses II. They stand before the barque of Amun, and Nefertari is shown playing the sistra. Elsewhere Nefertari and Ramesses II are shown before a barque dedicated to a deified Ramesses II. Nefertari is shown twice accompanying her husband in Triumph scenes.

===Abu Simbel, small temple===
The small temple at Abu Simbel was dedicated to Nefertari and Hathor of Ibshek. The dedication text on one of the buttresses states:
: &quot;A temple of great and Mighty monuments, for the Great Royal Wife Nefertari Meryetmut, for whose sake the (very) sun does shine, given life and beloved&quot; (Kitchen).
While on other buttresses it says:
: &quot;King of South and North Egypt, Usermaatre Setepenre; he has made a Temple by excavation in the mountain, of eternal work(manship) in Nubia, which the King of South and North Egypt, Usermaatre Setepenre has made for the Great Royal Wife Nefertari Meryetmut, in Nubia, like Re forever and ever&quot; (Kitchen).

The two colossal standing statues of Nefertari in front of the small temple are equal in size to those of Ramesses II. Nefertari is shown holding a sistrum. She wears a long sheet dress and she is depicted with a long wig, Hathoric cow horns, the solar disk, and tall feathers mounted on a modius.

In the interior of the temple, Nefertari appears in a variety of scenes. She is shown for instance offering to a cow (Hathor) in a papyrus thicket, offering before Khnum, Satis, and Anuket, the triad of Elephantine, and offering to Mut and Hathor.
=== Tomb 66 in the Valley of the Queens===

The tomb of Nefertari, QV66 is one of the largest in the Valley of the Queens. It is 520 square meters, and covered with pictures of Nefertari. Her husband, the pharaoh, is not represented in any of the pictures. Nefertari can be seen wearing Greek silver earrings with a labrys design in one of the portraits. These would have been sent to her as a gift for diplomatic reasons. The tomb was robbed in antiquity. In 1904 it was rediscovered and excavated by Ernesto Schiaparelli. Several items from the tomb that were overlooked by the tomb robbers, including parts of gold bracelets, shabti figures and a small piece of an earring or pendant are now in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. Additional shabti figures are in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.

It was reported that a pair of mummified legs found in QV66 and now at the Museo Egizio of Turin may indeed be Nefertari&#x27;s based on the bone structure and the age of the person, which fits the profile of Nefertari.

<text>Stonehaven ( ) is a town on the northeast coast of Scotland, south of Aberdeen. It had a population of 11,177 at the 2022 Census.

Stonehaven was formerly the county town of Kincardineshire, succeeding the now abandoned town of Kincardine. It is currently administered as part of Aberdeenshire. The town is known in the local Doric dialect as &quot;Steenhive&quot; () and is nicknamed &quot;Stoney&quot;.

== Pre-history and archaeology ==
Stonehaven is the site of prehistoric events evidenced by finds at Fetteresso Castle and Neolithic pottery excavations from the Spurryhillock area. In 2004, archaeological work by CFA Archaeology, in advance of the building of the Aberdeen to Lochside Natural Gas Pipeline, found two short cists burials containing cremated remains to the southwest of Stonehaven. Radiocarbon dating put the burials in the first half of the 2nd millennium BC, which was the Early Bronze Age in Scotland. The burials contained stone tool artifacts and shale/cannel coal beads. That same year, researchers at the National Museums of Scotland and Yale University announced that a fossil found by an amateur paleontologist the previous year was the earliest known fossil of a land-dwelling animal. The fossil was about 420 million years old.

==History==

The town lies at the southern origin of the ancient Causey Mounth trackway, which was built on high ground to make passable this only available medieval route from coastal points south of Aberdeen. This ancient passage specifically connected the Bridge of Dee to Cowie Castle via the Portlethen Moss and the Stonehaven central plaza. The route was taken by the Earl Marischal and Marquess of Montrose when they led a Covenanter army of over 9,000 men in the first battle of the Wars of the Three Kingdoms in 1639.
The Covenanters were imprisoned in Dunnottar Castle, where many died. A memorial to them can be found in Dunnottar Church. Other castles in the vicinity are Fetteresso Castle and Muchalls Castle, both of which are in private ownership and not open to the public. The oldest surviving structure in Stonehaven is the Stonehaven Tolbooth at the harbour, used as an early prison and now a museum.

Dunnottar Castle, perched atop a rocky outcrop, was home to the Keith family, and during the Scottish Wars of Independence, the Scottish Crown Jewels were hidden there. In 1296, King Edward I of England took the castle only for William Wallace to reclaim it in 1297, burning down the church in the process with the entire English garrison still in it. In 1650, Oliver Cromwell sacked the castle to find the Crown Jewels following an eight-month siege (having previously destroyed the English Crown Jewels). However, just before the castle fell, the Crown Jewels were smuggled out by some ladies who took them by boat to a small church just down the coast in the village of Kinneff, where they remained undetected for eleven years.

Stonehaven was a Jacobite town in the Fifteen and it was a safe base for the retreating Jacobite army to stay overnight on the night of 5–6 February 1716. In the Forty-Five Stonehaven, part of the Episcopalian north-east, was again ‘reliably Jacobite’ and it was one of the north-eastern ports where reinforcements, plus money and equipment were periodically landed from France. After 1709, when Dunnottar Parish Church was taken over by the Church of Scotland Episcopalian services were held in the tolbooth until a meeting house was built in the High Street in 1738. Following the failure of the Forty-Five, the Duke of Cumberland ordered the building&#x27;s demolition. Services were then held in a house on the High Street. Stonehaven Town Hall, which is an events venue in the town, was completed in 1878. 

Near the Cowie Bridge, at the north of Stonehaven, was a fishing village known as Cowie, which has now been subsumed into Stonehaven. Somewhat further north are the ruins of Cowie Castle. Slightly to the west of Stonehaven is the ruined Ury House, originally a property of the Frasers.

A fossil of the oldest known land animal, &quot;Pneumodesmus newmani&quot;, a species of millipede, was found at Stonehaven&#x27;s Cowie Beach in 2004.

==Geography==
Stonehaven is 15 miles (24 km) south of Aberdeen sheltered in Stonehaven Bay. The Carron Water and Cowie Water run through the town. Stonehaven lies adjacent to a deeply indented bay surrounded on three sides by higher land between Downie Point and Garron Point. The harbour, consisting of two basins, was improved in the 1820s by the engineer Robert Stevenson (grandfather of the author Robert Louis Stevenson), and became an important centre of the 19th century herring trade; the harbour is bordered on the north by Bellman&#x27;s Head and the south by Downie Point. At the western edge of Stonehaven west of the A90 road lies the village of Kirkton of Fetteresso. Nearby to the south, Fowlsheugh is a coastal nature reserve, known for its 230-foot-high cliff formations and habitat supporting prolific seabird nesting colonies.
Stonehaven has grown rapidly since the oil boom in Aberdeen. The increasing demand for new, middle-class housing has seen four new estates being appended to the town, creating an expanse of suburbs and Stonehaven has been bypassed since 1984.

Parts of Stonehaven near to the Carron Water were prone to flooding following heavy rain. Aberdeenshire Council has completed construction of flood defenses in 2023 that have now been effective at preventing flooding from major storms. 

The Highland Boundary Fault traverses Scotland from the Isle of Arran and Helensburgh on the west coast to immediately north of Stonehaven on the east coast.

== Parks and green spaces ==
The largest park is Mineralwell, situated adjacent to the Glenury Viaduct which carries the Dundee–Aberdeen line. St Kieran&#x27;s Well, a grade-C listed public fountain, is situated in the park. It was restored in 1982, though its water supply has since been severed. The park contains one of the largest purpose built radio controlled car circuits in the UK, located at the edge of the park beside the viaduct. The John McRobert Pavilion was opened in the park in 1993 and an artificial turf pitch opened in the park in 2015. The park is home to a parkrun. In 2021, 120 cherry blossom trees were planted as part of the Sakura Cherry Tree Project. The trees are dedicated to Thomas Blake Glover.

Nearby Baird Park occupies an area of four acres and was given to the town by Sir Alexander Baird in 1920, though it had been leased to the council for the previous twelve years.

Stonehaven Recreation Grounds was opened in 1885 and is situated near the beach. It is owned by the council. It contains tennis courts and a bowling green.

Dunnottar Woods is a woodland area managed by the Woodland Trust.

==Education==
The town has a secondary school, Mackie Academy, which was founded at the site occupied currently by Arduthie School. Mackie takes pupils from a relatively large chunk of southern Aberdeenshire with its catchment zone stretching from Johnshaven and St Cyrus (Although the primary school is in the catchment area for Mearns Academy in Laurencekirk) in the south to Netherley in the north and out to Drumlithie in the west.
The feeder primary schools include: Glenbervie, Inverbervie, Lairhillock, Gourdon, Catterline, Kinneff, Arduthie, Mill’o forest, Dunnottar and Carronhill.

There are three primary schools:
* Arduthie School is one of the three primary schools in Stonehaven serving a large portion of the north and east of the town as well as the surrounding countryside to the north-west.
* Dunnottar School was founded in 1889. It is linked to the notable Parish Church and the historic Dunnottar Castle and is located at the edge of the old town. It serves the old town and the majority of the countryside surrounding Stonehaven As part of the Stonehaven flooding in 2009 the school was affected and pupils had to be relocated for a week while work was undertaken. It is currently due to close. 
* Mill O&#x27; Forest School, is located in the newer part of Stonehaven and serves the south and parts of the north of the town. It opened in 1977.
One special education school, Carronhill, opened in 1975. It is situated in the newer part of the town near Mill O&#x27; Forest Primary School.

==Commerce and culture==

Historically the chief commerce of Stonehaven lay in fishing. Led by the herring fishery, the catch peaked around the year 1894 with a peak catch of about 15 million fish per annum and employment in the fishing industry of 1280 people. Due to overfishing to serve the expanding regional population, the fishing industry declined with diminishing catches, such that by 1939 only a remnant of the earlier fishing fleet continued to exist, and the catch mostly supported the local population from that point onward. Glenury distillery was situated near Mineralwell park, and closed in 1985.
Currently, the town&#x27;s primary industries are marine services and tourism, with Dunnottar Castle, a local landmark, bringing in a large number of tourists every year. Dunnottar Castle is regularly used in promotional material by the Scottish tourism industry; in addition, it was used in the 1990 film &quot;Hamlet&quot;, and appeared as a featured desktop background in the UK edition of Microsoft Windows 7. 
Furthermore, Dunnottar Castle was also selected as Merida&#x27;s home in the Disney movie, Brave.
Situated nearby is Stonehaven War Memorial, constructed after World War I. It was unveiled by Viscountess Cowdray in 1923. It is visible from much of the town thanks to its prominent position on a hilltop overlooking the bay. Another attractive feature of the town is the long beach facing the North Sea, with large cliffs at either end sheltering small rock pools and inlets. It is also famous for its Olympic-size outdoor swimming pool, which is heated and filled with filtered seawater. The local harbour features the Tolbooth, the town&#x27;s small museum of local heritage.
During Hogmanay festivities, crowds watch the annual fireballs ceremony in which volunteers walk down the High Street swinging their fireball - a homemade ball of burning waste materials with a chain and handle attached. The Fireball Festival was part of the content of STV&#x27;s Hogmanay coverage. The fireballs are finally thrown into the harbour. It is uncertain when the fireballs began, however, reports covering the event from as early as 1911 exist. The event has taken place annually, though has been cancelled during the world wars and in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Stonehaven&#x27;s long-established pipe band plays at events throughout the year, including the folks festival and fireball ceremony. The band has competed at various levels throughout its illustrious history including several years at the prestigious Grade 1.

Stonehaven also hosts a Folk Festival.

=== Cuisine ===
The town&#x27;s Haven Fish Bar was the likely origin of the deep-fried Mars Bar, a snack now culturally associated with Scotland - and its health record - as a whole. In 2012, the (since renamed) Carron fish and chip shop sold around 100–150 deep-fried Mars bars per week, with tourists accounting for around 70% of this figure. The Carron was awarded No 1 Fish and Chip Shop in Scotland 2020. Another local fish and chip shop, the Bay, was awarded the number one fish and chip shop in Scotland, at the National fish and Chip awards in 2012 and 2013.

===Sports and events===
Every July, Stonehaven holds a Highland Games. All those competing in the heavy events (which include the Hammer, the Heavy Stone, and Tossing the Caber) must wear full Highland dress. Other events include the Stonehaven Folk Festival, regularly attended by famous Glaswegian comedian Billy Connolly. On the first Saturday in June, the Feein&#x27; Market recreates a 19th-century agricultural hiring fair. The RW Thomson Classic Car Rally is an annual celebration of the inventor of the pneumatic tire and attracts an impressive range of vintage and classic cars. There are two harbour festivals each summer. A farmers&#x27; market is now held once a month in the market square, where local food suppliers and producers can sell fresh fruit, vegetables, poultry, and other types of meat.

Stonehaven supports a rugby club - Mackie Academy Former Pupils Rugby Football Club - which plays in the RBS Caledonia Regional League Division 1. They have previously trained on pitches at Red Cloak.

The town has a Junior football club - Stonehaven F.C. - that plays in the North Region Scottish Junior Football North Premier League. Home games are played at Glenury Park, set in Mineralwell Park. There are also three amateur football clubs: AC Mill Inn, Cowie Thistle and Stonehaven Athletic, as well as Stonehaven Youth Football Club, who all play their games in Mineralwell Park. In 2015, a combination of Stonehaven Football Club, Cowie Thistle, Stonehaven Athletic, Stonehaven Youth Football Club and Stonehaven Ladies Football Club created the Stonehaven Community Football Club, which was recognised by the Scottish Football Association with a Quality Mark Community Level Award, and subsequently the Legacy Award in November 2017.

===Local radio===
The Local Community Radio Station &quot;Mearns FM&quot; broadcasts to the town and surrounding area, including Inverbervie and Laurencekirk. Staffed completely by volunteers, it is run as a not-for-profit organisation, broadcasting under a community radio license, with a remit to provide locally focused news, events, and programming. Jointly funded by local adverts and local and national grants, &quot;Mearns FM&quot; has one of the largest listening areas of any community radio station owing to the Mearns&#x27; distributed population.

==Notable residents==
Stonehaven was the birthplace of Robert William Thomson, inventor of the pneumatic tyre.
It is also the birthplace of James Murdoch, a journalist and Orientalist, Lord Reith of Stonehaven, the first Director-General of the BBC, and Tom McEwen, a Canadian communist politician and trade union organiser.

John Ellis, an architect who was born and lived here, was responsible for many local buildings including the War Memorial. George Thomson Chapman (1824–1881), a New Zealand publisher, was born in Stonehaven.

Ury House, Stonehaven, is the ancestral seat of the Viscounts Stonehaven. It was built by Sir Alexander Baird, 1st Baronet in 1885.

The novelist Lewis Grassic Gibbon (James Leslie Mitchell) attended school at what was the old Mackie Academy (now Arduthie Primary).

Famous historical visitors include William Wallace and Mary, Queen of Scots. Poet Robert Burns met friends in Stonehaven in 1787.

==Transport==

The town has been served by Stonehaven railway station on the Dundee–Aberdeen line since 1849. Initially located outside the town, Stonehaven has since grown and has absorbed the station. The A90 road bypasses the town, and meets the A92 here. The town has a local service and is also on the X7 Coastrider route between Aberdeen and Perth. A locally run Land Train runs from the town square to the outdoor pool, Dunnottar Castle and the harbour.

== Public services ==
Woodcot Hospital operated from 1867 to 1998. Kincardine Community Hospital continues to operate today. On 11 June 2013, it was decided by the Justice Committee that Stonehaven Sheriff Court would be closed. This was despite a petition attracting nearly 300 signatures and disagreement from the local community.

Lifeboats were provided by the local charity Maritime Rescue Institute until its closure in 2013. A Royal National Lifeboat Institution station was subsequently established.

Stonehaven Leisure Centre was opened in 1985 following an investment of £650,000 and contains sports halls and a 25 metre swimming pool.
