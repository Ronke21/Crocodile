<text>The River Foss is in North Yorkshire, England. It is a tributary of the River Ouse. It rises in the Foss Crooks Woods near Oulston Reservoir close to the village of Yearsley and runs south through the Vale of York to the Ouse in the centre of York. The name most likely comes from the Latin word Fossa, meaning ditch. It is mentioned in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot;. The York district was settled by Norwegian and Danish people, so parts of the place names could be old Norse. Referring to the etymological dictionary &quot;Etymologisk ordbog&quot;, deals with the common Danish and Norwegian languages – roots of words and the original meaning. The old Norse word &quot;Fos&quot; (waterfall) means impetuous. The River Foss was dammed, and even though the elevation to the River Ouse is small, a waterfall was formed. This may have led to the name &quot;Fos&quot; which became Foss.

The responsibility for the management of the river&#x27;s drainage area is the Foss Internal drainage board (IDB). It has responsibility for the area from Crayke to the pre-1991 city boundary of York covering 9,085 hectares and 162.54 km of waterways. The Foss IDB is part of the York Consortium of Drainage Boards that oversees 10 IDB&#x27;s in the Yorkshire region.

The typical river level range at the Foss Barrier is between 5.05m and 7.90m. The highest river level recorded was 10.20 metres and the river level reached 9.34 metres on 23 January 2008.

==Course==

The source of the Foss is a spring in the Howardian Hills adjacent to, and flowing into, Oulston Reservoir near Newburgh Priory, four miles (6.5 km) north of Easingwold. From there to the Blue Bridge in York, where it joins the Ouse, it is 19.5 miles (31 km) in length. For part of its way it runs close to the B1363 between Brandsby and Stillington. The river flows in wide meanders in a southerly direction for most of its course towards York. As of 2010 the river is navigable for some 1.5 miles (2 km) upstream of Castle Mills Lock. The bridges by Peasholme Green and Foss Bank restrict the headroom to an air space of 2.4 metres.

==River modifications==

The Foss Barrier was built across the river near its mouth at Castle Mills. When closed, it prevents floodwater from the Ouse forcing the flow of the Foss back on itself. When the Ouse reaches 7.4m above ordnance datum, the staff at the barrier are alerted. When the level reaches 7.8m AOD the barrier is lowered after running pumps for several minutes to clear silt and debris from the river bed to make a watertight fit. It takes four minutes to lower the barrier. 

To avoid the build-up of water behind the barrier causing the Foss to burst its banks, water is pumped around the barrier into the Ouse by eight pumps that pump water at 50 tonnes per second preventing the Foss flowing back on itself. The water pumped out should maintain a water level of 6.5m AOD behind the barrier. When both sides of the barrier are equalised, the barrier is raised.

Castle Mills Lock is 34 metres long and 6 metres wide. There are mooring points in the lock basin on the Ouse side and overnight mooring on the Foss is prohibited. Beyond Rowntree Wharf there are few opportunities for turning.

==History==

In 1069 William the Conqueror dammed the Foss just south of York Castle, close to its confluence with the Ouse creating a moat around the castle. It caused the river to flood further upstream in what is now the Hungate and Layerthorpe areas, forming a large lake that was known as the &quot;King&#x27;s Pool&quot; or the &quot;King&#x27;s Fish Pond&quot; and which provided fish for the markets. The lake was approximately 100 acres in extent and fishing was allowed by licence, except for the King&#x27;s Men.

The King&#x27;s Pool was part of the city&#x27;s inner defences during the Middle Ages as the marsh was virtually impassable and explains why there is no city wall between Layerthorpe Postern and the Red Tower.

In the 17th century, the King&#x27;s Pool and the Foss were in decline because silt from upriver collected in the Pool, and not enough water came down to move it on despite the main channel of the River Foss having been deepened in 1608. Eventually the lake was too shallow to remain viable as a defence. In 1644 the lake was shallow enough for Parliamentarian forces under Sir Thomas Fairfax to consider crossing it on foot to break the Siege of York during the English Civil War.

In 1727 an order was placed upon Arthur Ingram, 6th Viscount of Irvine to scour the River Foss from the Castle Mills to Foss Bridge, making it eight yards wide at the top and four yards at the bottom, and, in 1731 the Little Foss, the extension to enclose the castle was drained. In the 18th century, the water was so low that marshy islands were created (hence the modern name Foss Islands). Citizens used the river as a rubbish tip which became a health hazard. The &#x27; (33 Geo. 3. c. 99) and the &#x27; (41 Geo. 3. (U.K.) c. cxv) were enacted to make the Foss navigable and saw the end of the King&#x27;s Pool. The Foss Navigation Company canalised the river from 1778, to make it navigable as far as Sheriff Hutton.

The &#x27; (16 &amp; 17 Vict. c. lvi) saw York Corporation purchase the River Foss from the Foss Navigation Company. The &#x27; (22 Vict. c. xix) allowed the river above Yearsley Bridge was abandoned as a waterway.

Stillington Hall was a mansion on the west side of the Foss and adjoining the village of the same name. It was the home of the Croft family, who are descended from a common ancestor with the house of Croft, of Croft Castle in Herefordshire.

==Economy==

Remains of Roman jetties, wharves and warehouses have been found by excavations and building works on the banks of the Foss, suggesting that water-borne transport and trade were important from early in the history of the city.

The modern Foss benefits most from leisure activity and several long-distance walks cross its path. The Foss Walk follows much of the river course from Blue Bridge to Oulston Reservoir and on to Easingwold, a distance of 28 miles (45 km). Part of the Howardian Way near Yearsley and both the Ebor Way and Centenary Way as far as West Lilling also follow the Foss for part of their way.

==Ecology==

Several species of fish are found in the river, such as Pike, Dace, Chub, Gudgeon, Perch and Roach. At the start of the century, Barbel have been introduced into the river.

== River Foss Barrier ==

Flooding of the River Ouse occurs periodically in York. This is part of a series of schemes designed by the Yorkshire Water Authority.

The River Foss is a left bank tributary of the River Ouse, situated near the York Castle.

In the years 1947, 1978, 1982 and end of 2015 flooding occurred causing many areas to be under water.

In 1982, a feasibility study was undertaken that indicated flood levels in the Foss are directly related to River Ouse levels.

A barrier was proposed to counteract the backwash of the Ouse into the River Foss. In 2016 funds were allocated to upgrade the existing facilities to improve the pumping capacity.

<text>The Churches of Peace (, ) in Jawor and Świdnica in Lower Silesia. Poland, are 17th-century churches, named after the Peace of Westphalia of 1648.

The treaty granted the Lutherans of Silesia to build three churches from wood, loam and straw outside the city walls, without steeples and church bells. The construction time was limited to one year. The third Peace church, erected in Głogów, burned down in 1758.
The exterior of the churches look austere due to the religious restrictions of the time, while their interiors are ornately decorated in Baroque style.
The interior of the Jawor church is decorated with 180 paintings, depicting Biblical scenes from the Old and the New Testament, while the church in Świdnica features apocalyptic visions as well as the panorama of surrounding area.

Since 2001, the two remaining churches are listed as UNESCO World Heritage Sites:
* Holy Trinity Church of Peace in Świdnica
* Church of Peace in Jawor

== History ==
Despite the physical and political constraints, three of the churches became the biggest timber-framed religious buildings in Europe due to pioneering construction and architectural solutions.

The church in Jawor, dedicated to the Holy Ghost is long, wide and high and has capacity of 5,500. It was constructed by architect Albrecht von Saebisch (1610–1688) from Wroclaw (then German &quot;Breslau&quot;) and was finished a year later in 1655. The 200 paintings inside by were created by Georg Flegel in 1671–1681. The ornately decorated altar, by Martin Schneider, dates to 1672, the original organ of J. Hoferichter from Legnica (then German &quot;Liegnitz&quot;) of 1664 was replaced in 1855–1856 by Adolf Alexander Lummert.

By that time, the town had been part of the majority Protestant Kingdom of Prussia for about a century. Another 100 years later, in 1945, the town became again part of Poland, as a result of the Potsdam Agreement. Although most of the Protestant churches taken over by Poland in 1945 became Catholic, the two Peace Churches still serve their Lutheran parishes.

The similar church, erected in Głogów (then German &quot;Glogau&quot;) burned down in 1758, but the one in Świdnica, dedicated to the Holy Trinity, survived like the one in Jawor. Both were restored by a Polish–German cooperation, and recognized by UNESCO in 2001.

<text>The River Glen is a river in Lincolnshire, England with a short stretch passing through Rutland near Essendine.

The river&#x27;s name appears to derive from a Brythonic Celtic language but there is a strong early English connection.

==Naming==

In the language of the Ancient Britons, which survives today as Welsh, Cornish and Breton, the neighbouring rivers, the Glen and the Welland seem to have been given contrasting names. The Welland flowed from the area underlain by the Northampton Sands which in many places are bound together by iron oxide to form ironstone. In the Roman period, the sands were easily worked as arable land and the ironstone was dug for smelting. In both cases, the ground was exposed to erosion which meant that silt was carried down to The Fens by the river. In modern Welsh, &quot;gwaelod&quot; (from Late Proto-British &quot;*Woelǫd-&quot;) means bottom and its plural, &quot;gwaelodion&quot; means sediment. Among the medieval forms of the name &#x27;Welland&#x27; is Weolod; the river could have thus been named from its silty nature. In contrast, the Glen flowed from clays and limestone. Areas with clay-based soils tended to remain as woodland whilst the limestone areas provided grassland for pasture. Consequently, the River Glen did not carry much sediment. The modern Welsh for clean is &quot;glân&quot;. The relative amounts of silt deposited in the fens around Maxey and around Thurlby respectively, by the two rivers, support this view.

==Course==

The river has two sources, both in the low ridge of Jurassic rocks in the west of the county. The East Glen rises as a number of small streams near to Ropsley and Humby, close to the contour. It flows in a southerly direction, passing to the east of Ingoldsby and to the west of Bulby, to arrive at Edenham. The East Glen is sometimes called the River Eden, derived as a back-formation from its passing through the parish of Edenham. It continues south through Toft, where a Grade II listed bridge built in the early 1800s crosses, and Manthorpe, where there is another listed bridge with a single elliptical arch built in 1813, before turning east to join the West Glen at Wilsthorpe, Lincolnshire. The West Glen also has a number of sources, near to the contour at Old Somerby and Boothby Pagnall. It flows more or less parallel to the East Glen, passing through Bitchfield, Burton-le-Coggles, Corby Glen and Creeton to reach Essendine, where it turns east towards Greatford. In the village, a two-arched stone bridge built in the late 1700s carries Church Lane over the river.

Most of the water from the West Glen river no longer joins that from the East Glen, as it now flows along the Greatford Cut to join the River Welland upstream of Market Deeping. The re-routing was devised by E. G. Taverner, the chief engineer for the Welland and Deepings Drainage Board, towards the end of the Second World War, and was part of a much larger project which involved the digging of the Coronation Channel, a flood relief channel to divert the Welland around the south-eastern edge of Spalding, and the construction of Fulney lock, to exclude tidal water from the upper Welland. The whole scheme cost £723,000, and the Coronation Channel, which was completed in 1953, was named to commemorate the crowning of Queen Elizabeth II in the same year.

By the time the East and West rivers join, they are only just above the contour. Once joined, the river flows in a northerly direction, past Fletland Mill, a former grain mill which was built in 1759, and Kate&#x27;s Bridge weir, where a modern bridge carries the A15 road over it. This bypasses a single-arched bridge built in the late 1700s, which has a female head carved on the keystone of the western face, presumed to be the Kate after whom the bridge is named. Beyond the bridges, the river becomes a typical Fens high level carrier, embanked on both sides and partially straightened, with counter drains on both sides of the channel, to collect seepage through the banks, as the normal water levels are higher than the surrounding land. At Tongue End the waters of the Bourne Eau join. The river below here is navigable for its last , and there was once a navigable connection to the Bourne Eau, but the Tongue End pumping station now sits between the two rivers, to aid drainage of the land to the west. The Weir Dyke drain runs along the north bank of the Bourne Eau and then the west bank of the Glen, to join the South Forty-Foot Drain near Guthram Gowt. For some distance either side of Tongue End, the Counter Drain runs a considerable distance to the east of the channel, creating washlands between them which can be flooded if water is not able to dischange from the river into the Welland estuary, as a result of the state of the tides. A little before Guthram Gowt, the Counter Drain turns to the east to reach Pode Hole pumping station, which plays an important part in the drainage of Deeping Fen.

Beyond Guthram Gowt, the river flows in a north-easterly direction, and is flanked on both sides by drainage ditches because the land is low-lying. It passes through Pinchbeck and Surfleet to reach the tidal entrance sluice where it joins the River Welland. The sluice is only navigable when the tidal level is the same as the river level.

==History==
&quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;, an ancient history of Britain traditionally attributed to Nennius, a ninth-century Welsh monk, records that Arthur, the war leader of the Britons fought his first battle against the Anglo-Saxons at the mouth of the River Glein . Thomas Green presents a case for the Glein being the Glen, based on the identification of &quot;Linnuis&quot;, the district for four subsequent battles, being Lindsey, although he acknowledges that other locations, including the River Glen, Northumberland for example, have been suggested. This aerial photo shows the River Glen at Guthram, halfway between Twenty and West Pinchbeck. To the south, the Roman road across the fen lies hidden, buried in Baston Fen and Pinchbeck Common. In Arthur&#x27;s time, around the year 500, the north-flowing section of the Glen entered tidal flats lying in Pinchbeck North Fen, to the north-east of Guthram. The line of the river to the east of Guthram appears to have originated as a sea bank but when sedimentation and fen enclosure caused the sea no longer to reach it, the river was led away along the bank so that the sea bank became one of river&#x27;s banks instead. The section of the A151 road on the &#x27;seaward&#x27; side of the Glen was not built until 1822.

Close to the year 500, the spread of Anglian settlement had recently reached Baston, at the other end of this Roman road, on the landward side of this fen but burial at the Urns Farm cemetery alongside King Street then stopped abruptly.

Compared to its neighbour, the Welland, there are few records of the history of the Glen. Dugdale, writing his book &quot;The History of Imbanking and Drayning of divers Fenns and Marshes&quot; in 1662, which was based on personal observations he made during a trip to the Fens in May 1657, and the records of the Fens Office, most of which were destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666, thought it was the least of the rivers he had seen, and recorded that it &quot;serveth almost to none other use, but to carry away so much of its own water, with the rill descending from Burne, as can be kept between two defensible banks.&quot; The embanking of the lower river had thus already been done by the time of his account.

Both the Bourne Eau and the Glen were affected by flooding, causing failure of the banks, which was addressed in the Black Sluice Act 1765 (5 Geo. 3. c. &quot;86&quot; ). The history of navigation is intimately tied up with that of the Bourne Eau, since Bourne was the main centre of population above Spalding. The Bourne Eau Act 1781 (21 Geo. 3. c. 22) appointed trustees, who were to scour and cleanse the river, and could charge tolls to fund the operation. Corn and wool passed down the river, bound for Boston, while coal and groceries were the principal cargo in the opposite direction. In 1792, Thomas Hawkes wrote about trade in timber, which was carried from Bourne to Spalding, and there was a boat which carried passengers to the market at Spalding on Tuesdays, but he comments that the service was erratic, as there was often too little or too much water for the vessels to operate. The Black Sluice Commissioners installed flood doors between the Glen and the Bourne Eau at Tongue End, to prevent high water levels in the Glen passing up the river to Bourne.

Breaching of the banks by floodwater was a continual problem, with six breaches of the north bank recorded between 1821 and 1882, and eight of the south bank in the same period. Measurement showed that the river level rose by for every of rain falling on the river&#x27;s catchment area. The arrival of railways in the area resulted in a rapid decline of river traffic. A railway from Boston to Spalding opened in 1848, while the line from Spalding opened to Bourne in 1866 and on to Sleaford in 1872. Although occasional boats were still reaching Bourne in 1857, the self-acting doors at Tongue End were replaced by a sluice in the 1860s, which prevented passage from the Glen to the Bourne Eau, although the right of navigation was not officially revoked until 1962, as part of flood defence measures which included the replacement of the sluice by a pumping station in 1966.

Once the route to Bourne was closed off, there was little trade on the river, although a short section of about was used by barges until the 1920s. Although the present head of navigation is at Tongue End, there is evidence that lighters capable of carrying 15 tons used to navigate to Kate&#x27;s Bridge, where the Lincoln to Peterborough turnpike road crossed the river, and there are the remains of moorings at Greatford Hall, although navigation to there must have ceased after Kate&#x27;s Bridge was rebuilt.

In 1734, John Grundy, one of the pioneers in applying scientific principles to the solution of civil engineering problems, was asked by the Adventurers of Deeping Fen to consider the drainage of of fenland to the west of Spalding. His plans included the construction of a reservoir which covered , impounded by a sluice at Surfleet. At low tide, the water would be released, and the scouring action would deepen the channel, with a consequent improvement in drainage. Humphrey Smith directed the construction, with Grundy acting as engineer, which was completed in 1739, according to a plaque fixed to it at the time. The sluice had three openings, each wide, with pointed doors on the downstream site, which closed as the tide rose, and lifting gates on the upstream side, which would be raised to discharge the water. The present sluice was erected by the trustees of the Deeping Fen Drainage Act 1856. The first stone was laid by Lord Kesteven on 17th February 1879 and the sluice opened in November 1879 at a total cost of £15,000.

==Development==

The Environment Agency are the navigation authority responsible for the river. They issue licences for its use, and operate Surfleet sluice when required. While the river is navigable for to Tongue End, the upper reaches above Pinchbeck Bars are only suitable for smaller boats, as there are no locations where it is possible to turn a boat which is over long. However, the section of the river from its source to Guthram Gowt forms part of the proposed Fens Waterways Link, which will ultimately link the River Witham to the River Nene, via the South Forty-Foot Drain, the River Glen, the River Welland and some upgraded drains near Peterborough. Phase One, the connection of the South Forty-Foot Drain to The Haven at Boston by a new lock, was completed by December 2008, and was officially opened on 20 March 2009.
Construction of the second phase of the project, which will involve making the South Forty-Foot Drain navigable from Donington to Guthram Gowt, where a connection with the River Glen will be made, has been delayed by the change in the economic climate, and the complexity of the task.
==Water quality==
The Environment Agency measure the water quality of the river systems in England. Each is given an overall ecological status, which may be one of five levels: high, good, moderate, poor and bad. There are several components that are used to determine this, including biological status, which looks at the quantity and varieties of invertebrates, angiosperms and fish. Chemical status, which compares the concentrations of various chemicals against known safe concentrations, is rated good or fail.

The water quality of the River Glen system was as follows in 2019.
The reasons for the quality being less than good include sewage discharge affecting most of the river, physical modification of channels, ground water abstraction, and poor management of agricultural and rural land adjacent to the river system. Like most rivers in the UK, the chemical status changed from good to fail in 2019, due to the presence of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE), perfluorooctane sulphonate (PFOS) and mercury compounds, none of which had previously been included in the assessment.

<text>Matthew Parker (6 August 1504 – 17 May 1575) was an English bishop. He was the Archbishop of Canterbury in the Church of England from 1559 to his death. He was also an influential theologian and arguably the co-founder (with a previous Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Cranmer and the theologian Richard Hooker) of a distinctive tradition of Anglican theological thought.

Parker was one of the primary architects of the Thirty-nine Articles, the defining statements of Anglican doctrine. The Parker collection of early English manuscripts, including the book of St Augustine Gospels and &quot;Version A&quot; of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, was created as part of his efforts to demonstrate that the English Church was historically independent of Rome and was one of the world&#x27;s most important collections of ancient manuscripts. Along with the pioneering scholar Lawrence Nowell, Parker&#x27;s work concerning Old English literature laid the foundation for Anglo-Saxon studies.

== Early years (15041525) ==
Matthew Parker, the eldest son of William and Alice Parker, was born in Norwich in St Saviour&#x27;s parish on 6 August 1504; he was one of six children, and the third son and eldest surviving child. His father was a wealthy worsted weaver and the grandson of Nicholas Parker, registrar to successive archbishops of Canterbury between 1450 and 1483. His mother Alice Monins was originally from Kent; she may have been related by marriage to Thomas Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury from 1533 to 1555. William Parker died in about 1516, and within three or four years following his death, Alice Parker married John Baker. Their son, also called John, was later nominated as one of Parker&#x27;s executors. Matthew Parker&#x27;s surviving siblings were Botolph (who became a priest), Thomas (who during his life became Mayor of Norwich) and Margaret. Their mother died in 1553.

Parker was brought up in Norwich on Fye Bridge Street, now called Magdalen Street. He was possibly educated at home, and recalled later in life being taught by six men, mostly clerics. According to his biographer John Strype,

In 1520, the 16-year-old Parker went up to Cambridge University, where he studied at , now known as Corpus Christi College under Richard Cowper. On 20 March 1520, after six months at the college, he obtained a scholarship and became the Bible clerk at , and so was able to move from St Mary&#x27;s Hostel to rooms in the college. At Cambridge he was able to read the works of Martin Luther, and had access to books by married theologians from the Continent — he first commended clerical marriage when he was a student there. He was associated with the circle of Thomas Bilney, remaining loyal to him throughout their university days together. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1525.

==Career at Cambridge (15251547)==
Parker was ordained as a deacon on 20 April 1527 and a priest two months later, on 15 June. In September he was elected a fellow of Corpus Christi. There is no evidence that he was ever involved in a public dispute at Cambridge, unlike his contemporaries. Bilney was accused of heresy in 1527 and then recanted, but was imprisoned for two years. He returned to Cambridge, regretting his recantation, and began to preach throughout Norfolk. In August 1531 he was condemned to be burnt at the stake as a relapsed heretic; Parker was present at his execution in Norwich on 19 August, and afterwards defended Bilney after accusations were made that he had recanted at the stake.

In around 1527, Parker was one of the Cambridge scholars whom Cardinal Thomas Wolsey invited to Cardinal College at Oxford. Parker, like Cranmer, declined Wolsey&#x27;s invitation. The college had been founded in 1525 on the site of St Frideswide&#x27;s Priory, and was still being built when Wolsey fell from power in 1529.

Parker began his Master of Arts degree in 1528. He was licensed to preach by Cranmer in 1533, and quickly became a popular preacher in and around Cambridge; none of his sermons have survived. He would have had to adhere to the &quot;Ten Articles&quot; enforced on the clergy during that period.

After being summoned to the court of Anne Boleyn he became her chaplain. Through her influence he was appointed dean of the college of secular canons at Stoke-by-Clare in Suffolk in 1535, a post he held until 1547. The college had been secularised in 1514. The duties of the residents involved the regular performance of the offices of the church and prayers for the founder&#x27;s family, but little direction was provided in the statutes for other times during the day, and there was little to do for the residents beyond their daily tasks and the education of the choirboys. It had come close to be acquired by Wolsey, but this had been prevented by the intervention of the Bishop of Norwich and Henry VIII&#x27;s first wife, Catherine.

He retained his fellowship at Cambridge University whilst he was dean at Stoke-by-Clare. His biographer V.J.K. Brook commented that for Parker &quot;his new post provided him with a happy and quiet place of retirement in the country to which he became devoted&quot;; and allowed him to pursue his enthusiasm for education and the sponsorship of new buildings. At Stoke he transformed the college by introducing new statutes to ensure regular preaching occurred. Under Parker&#x27;s deanship, scholars came from Cambridge to deliver lectures, greater care was taken over the education of the boy choristers, and a free grammar school for local boys was built within the precincts. His successful revitalisation of the college caused its reputation to spread, and he was able to protect it from being dissolved by citing the good work being done there; it retained its status until after Henry&#x27;s death in 1547.

Shortly before Anne Boleyn&#x27;s arrest in 1536, she charged her daughter Elizabeth to Parker&#x27;s care, something he honoured for the rest of his life. He obtained his Bachelor of Divinity in July 1535, and in 1537 was appointed chaplain to Henry; he graduated Doctor of Divinity in July 1538.

In 1539 he was denounced to the Lord Chancellor, Thomas Audley, by his opponents at Stoke-by-Clare, who accused him of heresy and using &quot;disloyal language against Easter, relics and other details&quot;. Audley dismissed the charges and urged Parker to &quot;go on and fear no such enemies&quot;. In 1541 was appointed to the second prebend at Ely, a sign of royal approval.

On 4 December 1544, on Henry&#x27;s recommendation, he was elected master of Corpus Christi College. Such was his devotion towards the care of the college, he is now regarded as its second founder. Upon his election he began the process of putting organising its finances properly, which enabled him to repair the buildings and construct new ones&#x27; the master&#x27;s Lodgings, the college halls and many of the students&#x27; rooms were improved. He worked hard to make Corpus Christi a centre of learning, founding new scholarships.

In January 1545, after two months in the post of master of Corpus, he was elected vice-chancellor of the university. During his year in office he got into some trouble with the Chancellor of Cambridge University, Stephen Gardiner, over a play, &quot;Pammachius&quot;, performed by the students and censored by the college, which derided the old ecclesiastical system. Parker was obliged to make enquiries into the nature of the play, but then allowed to settle the matter himself on behalf of the university authorities.

===Career under Edward VI===
On the passing of the Act of Parliament in 1545 enabling the king to dissolve chantries and colleges, Parker was appointed one of the commissioners for Cambridge, and their report may have saved its colleges from destruction. Stoke, however, was dissolved in the following reign, and Parker received a generous pension. He took advantage of the new reign to marry in June 1547, before clerical marriages were legalised by Parliament and Convocation, Margaret, daughter of Robert Harlestone, a Norfolk squire. They had initially planned to marry since about 1540 but had waited until it was not a felony for priests to marry. The marriage was a happy one, although Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s dislike of Margaret was later to cause Parker much distress. They had five children, of whom John and Matthew reached adulthood. During Kett&#x27;s Rebellion, he preached at the rebels&#x27; camp on Mousehold Hill near Norwich, without much effect, and later encouraged his secretary, Alexander Neville, to write his history of the rising.

Parker&#x27;s association with Protestantism advanced with the times, and he received higher promotion under John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland, than under the moderate Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset. At Cambridge, he was a friend of the German Protestant reformer Martin Bucer after he was exiled to England, and preached Bucer&#x27;s funeral sermon in 1551. In 1552 he was promoted to the rich deanery of Lincoln.

==Demotion during the reign of Mary==
In July 1553 he supped with Northumberland at Cambridge, when the duke marched north on his hopeless campaign against the accession of Mary Tudor. As a supporter of Northumberland and a married man, under the new regime, Parker was deprived of his deanery, his mastership of Corpus Christi and his other preferments.

However, he survived Mary&#x27;s reign without leaving the country – a fact that would not have endeared him to the more ardent Protestants who went into exile and idealised those who were martyred by Mary. The historian James D. Wenn has suggested that Parker may have enjoyed the protection of Sir Rowland Hill of Soulton, Shropshire, during this time. Hill is associated with the publication of the Geneva Bible and joined Parker as a Commissioner for Ecclesiastical Cases in 1559.

Parker respected authority, and when his time came he could consistently impose authority on others. He was not eager to assume this task, and made great efforts to avoid promotion to Archbishop of Canterbury, which Elizabeth designed for him as soon as she had succeeded to the throne.

== Archbishop of Canterbury (1559–1575) ==
Elizabeth wanted a moderate man, so she chose Parker on the recommendations of William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley, her chief adviser. There was also an emotional attachment. Parker had been the favourite chaplain of Elizabeth&#x27;s mother, the queen Anne Boleyn. Before Anne was arrested in 1536 she had entrusted Elizabeth&#x27;s spiritual well-being to Parker. A few days afterwards Anne was executed following charges of adultery, incest and treason. Parker also possessed all the qualifications Elizabeth expected from an archbishop, except celibacy. Elizabeth had a strong prejudice against married clergy, and in addition, she seems to have disliked Margaret Parker personally, often treating her so rudely that her husband was &quot;in horror to hear it&quot;. After a visit to Lambeth Palace, the Queen duly thanked her hostess but maliciously asked how she should address her, &quot;For Madam I may not call you, mistress I should be ashamed to call you.&quot;

Parker was elected on 1 August 1559 but, given the turbulence and executions that had preceded Elizabeth&#x27;s accession, it was difficult to find the requisite four bishops willing and qualified to consecrate him, and not until 19 December was the ceremony performed at Lambeth by William Barlow, formerly Bishop of Bath and Wells, John Scory, formerly Bishop of Chichester, Miles Coverdale, formerly Bishop of Exeter, and John Hodgkins, Bishop of Bedford. The allegation of an indecent consecration at the Nag&#x27;s Head public house seems first to have been made by a Jesuit, Christopher Holywood, in 1604, and has since been discredited. Parker&#x27;s consecration was, however, legally valid only by the plenitude of the Royal Supremacy approved by the House of Commons and reluctantly by a vote of the House of Lords 21–18; the Edwardine Ordinal, which was used, had been repealed by Mary Tudor and not re-enacted by the parliament of 1559. In 1562 Parker granted a special licence to Thomas Ashton to become the founding headmaster of Shrewsbury School, which his associate Sir Rowland Hill had helped to on the grounds that that Ashton not being available would damage the progress of the school&#x27;s foundation, potential significance attaches to this because of the innovative approaches to teaching and drama that institution went on to exhibit.

Parker mistrusted popular enthusiasm, and he wrote in horror of the idea that &quot;the people&quot; should be the reformers of the church. He was convinced that if ever Protestantism was to be firmly established in England at all, some definite ecclesiastical forms and methods must be sanctioned to secure the triumph of order over anarchy, and he vigorously set about the repression of what he thought a mutinous individualism incompatible with a catholic spirit.

He was not an inspiring leader and no dogma or prayer book is associated with his name. However, the English composer Thomas Tallis contributed &quot;Nine Tunes for Archbishop Parker&#x27;s Psalter&quot; which bears his name. The 55 volumes published by the Parker Society include only one by its eponymous hero, and that is a volume of correspondence. He was a disciplinarian, a scholar, a modest and moderate man of genuine piety and irreproachable morals.

Probably his most famous saying, prompted by the arrival of Mary Queen of Scots in England, was &quot;I fear our good Queen has the wolf by the ears.&quot;

===Dispute about the validity of his consecration in 1559===
Parker&#x27;s consecration gave rise to a dispute, which continues to this day, in regard to its sacramental validity from the perspective of the Roman Catholic Church. This eventually led to the condemnation of Anglican orders as &quot;absolutely null and utterly void&quot; by a papal commission in 1896. The commission could not dispute that a consecration had taken place which met all the legal and liturgical requirement or deny that a &quot;manual&quot; succession, that is, the consecration by the laying on of hands and prayer had taken place. Rather the Pope asserted in the condemnation that the &quot;defect of form and intent&quot; rendered the rite insufficient to make a bishop in the apostolic succession (according to the Roman Catholic understanding of the minima for validity). Specifically the English rite was considered to be defective in &quot;form&quot;, i.e. in the words of the rite which did not mention the &quot;intention&quot; to create a sacrificing bishop considered to be a priest in a higher degree, and the absence of a certain &quot;matter&quot; such as the handing of a chalice and paten to symbolise the power to offer sacrifice.

The Church of England archbishops of Canterbury and York rejected the pontiff&#x27;s arguments in &quot;Saepius Officio&quot; in 1897. This rebuttal was written to demonstrate the sufficiency of the form and intention used in the Anglican Ordinal: the archbishops wrote that in the preface to the Ordinal the intention clearly is stated to continue the existing holy orders as received. They stated that even if Parker&#x27;s consecrators had private doubts or lacked intention to do what the rites of ordination clearly stated, it counted for nought, since the words and actions of a rite (the formularies) performed on behalf of the church by the ministers of the sacrament, and not the opinions, however erroneous or correct, or inner states of mind or moral condition of the actors who carry them out, are the sole determinants. This view is also held by the Roman Catholic Church (and others) with few exceptions since the 3rd century.

Likewise, according to the archbishops, the required references to the sacrificial priesthood never existed in any ancient Catholic ordination liturgies prior to the 9th century nor in certain current Eastern-rite ordination liturgies that the Roman Catholic Church considers valid nor in Orthodoxy. Also, the archbishops argued that a particular formula in this respect as a &quot;sine qua non&quot; made no difference to the substance or validity of the act since the only two components that all ordination rites had in common were prayer and the laying on of hands and, in this regard, the words in the Anglican rite itself gave sufficient evidence as to the intent of the participants as stated in the preface, words and action of the rite. They pointed out that the only fixed and sure sacramental formulary is the baptismal rite. They argued that it was not necessary to consecrate a bishop as a &quot;sacrificing priest&quot; since he already was one by virtue of being a priest, except in ordinations &quot;per saltim&quot;, i.e. from deacon to bishop when the person was made priest and bishop at once, a practice discontinued and forbidden. They also pointed out that none of the priests ordained with the English Ordinal were re-ordained as a requirement by Queen Mary - some did so voluntarily and some were re-anointed, a practice common at the time. On the contrary, the Queen, unhappy about married clergy, ordered all of them, estimated at 15% of the total at the beginning of her reign in 1553, to put their wives away. 

Parker was ordained in 1527 in the Latin Rite and before the break with Rome. As such according to this rite he was a &quot;sacrificing priest&quot; to which nothing more could be added by being consecrated a bishop. The orders of the Church of Ireland were also condemned as part of the wider denunciation of Anglican orders. The Popes at the time did not object to the Edwardine Ordinal but regarded those done from 1534 to 1553 as valid but illicit since they had not given permission for them.

In regard to the legal and canonical requirements, the government was at pains to see all were met for the consecration. None of the 18 Marian bishops would agree to consecrate Parker. Not only were they opposed to the changes the bishops had been excluded from decision-making regarding changes in liturgy, doctrine and the Royal Supremacy. The Commons approved the changes and the Lords 21-18 approved after pressure was brought to bear on them; concessions were made in a more Catholic tone in eucharistic doctrine, and allowance made for the use of Mass vestments and other traditional clerical dress in use in the second year of the reign of Edward VI, i.e. January 1548 to 49, when the Latin Rite was still the legal form of worship (the &#x27;Ornaments Rubric&#x27; in the 1559 Prayer Book seems to refer to the allowance as set forth in the 1549 BCP).

The government recruited four bishops who had been retired by Queen Mary or gone into exile. Two of the four, William Barlow and John Hodgkins had in Rome&#x27;s view valid orders, since, having been made bishops in 1536 and 1537 with the Roman Pontifical in the Latin Rite, their consecrations met the criteria according to the definition stated in &quot;Apostolicae Curae&quot;. John Scory and Miles Coverdale, the other two consecrators, were consecrated with the English Ordinal of 1550 on the same day in 1551 by Cranmer, Hodgkins and Ridley who were consecrated with the Latin Rite in 1532, 1537 and 1547 respectively. This ordinal was considered defective in form and intention. All four of Parker&#x27;s consecrators were consecrated by bishops who themselves had been consecrated with the Roman Pontifical in the Church of England which at the time was in schism from Rome. Even though two of the consecrators had orders recognised as validity by Rome the consecration was considered to be &quot;null and void&quot; by Rome because the ordinal used was judged to be defective in matter, form and intention.

In the first year of his archiepiscopate, Parker participated in the consecration of 11 new bishops and confirmed two who had been ordained in previous reigns.

=== Later years ===
Parker avoided involvement in secular politics and was never admitted to Elizabeth&#x27;s Privy Council. Ecclesiastical politics gave him considerable trouble. Some of the evangelical reformers wanted liturgical changes and at least the option not to wear certain clerical vestments, if not their complete prohibition. Early presbyterians wanted no bishops, and the conservatives opposed all these changes, often preferring to move in the opposite direction toward the practices of the Henrician church. The Queen herself begrudged episcopal privilege until she eventually recognised it as one of the chief bulwarks of royal supremacy. To Parker&#x27;s consternation, the queen refused to add her &quot;imprimatur&quot; to his attempts to secure conformity, though she insisted that he achieve this goal. Thus Parker was left to stem the rising tide of Puritan feeling with little support from Parliament, convocation or the Crown.

The bishops&#x27; &quot;Interpretations and Further Considerations&quot;, issued in 1560, tolerated a lower vestments standard than was prescribed by the rubric of 1559, but it fell short of the desires of the anti-vestment clergy such as Coverdale (one of the bishops who had consecrated Parker) who made a public display of their nonconformity in London.

The &quot;Book of Advertisements&quot;, which Parker published in 1566 to check the anti-vestments faction, had to appear without specific royal sanction; and the &quot;Reformatio legum ecclesiasticarum&quot;, which John Foxe published with Parker&#x27;s approval, received neither royal, parliamentary or synodical authorisation. Parliament even contested the claim of the bishops to determine matters of faith. &quot;Surely&quot;, said Parker to Peter Wentworth, &quot;you will refer yourselves wholly to us therein.&quot; &quot;No, by the faith I bear to God&quot;, retorted Wentworth, &quot;we will pass nothing before we understand what it is; for that were but to make you popes. Make you popes who list, for we will make you none.&quot;

Disputes about vestments had expanded into a controversy over the whole field of church government and authority. Parker died on 17 May 1575, lamenting that Puritan ideas of &quot;governance&quot; would &quot;in conclusion undo the Queen and all others that depended upon her&quot;. By his personal conduct, he had set an ideal example for Anglican priests.

He is buried in the chapel of Lambeth Palace. Matthew Parker Street, near Westminster Abbey, is named after him.

==Residences==
The Archbishop of Canterbury&#x27;s official residence in London is Lambeth Palace.

He also has a residence, named The Old Palace, next to Canterbury Cathedral on the site of the medieval Archbishop&#x27;s Palace.

==Scholarship==
Parker&#x27;s historical research was exemplified in his &quot;De antiquitate Britannicæ ecclesiae&quot;, and his editions of Asser, Matthew Paris (1571), Thomas Walsingham, and the compiler known as Matthew of Westminster (1571). &quot;De antiquitate Britannicæ ecclesiæ&quot; was probably printed at Lambeth in 1572, where the archbishop is said to have had an establishment of printers, engravers, and illuminators.

Parker gave the English people the &quot;Bishops&#x27; Bible&quot;, which was undertaken at his request, prepared under his supervision, and published at his expense in 1572. Much of his time and labour from 1563 to 1568 was given to this work. He had also the principal share in drawing up the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, for which his skill in ancient liturgies peculiarly fitted him. His liturgical skill was also shown in his version of the psalter. It was under his presidency that the Thirty-nine Articles were finally reviewed and subscribed by the clergy (1562).

Parker published in 1567 an old &quot;Saxon Homily on the Sacrament&quot;, by Ælfric of Eynsham. He published &quot;A Testimonie of Antiquitie Showing the Ancient Fayth in the Church of England Touching the Sacrament of the Body and Bloude of the Lord&quot; to prove that transubstantiation was not the doctrine of the ancient English Church. Parker collaborated with his secretary John Joscelyn in his manuscript studies.

===Manuscript collection===
Parker left a priceless collection of manuscripts, largely collected from former monastic libraries, to his college at Cambridge. Bevill has documented the manuscript transcriptions conducted under Parker.

The Parker Library at Corpus Christi bears his name and houses most of his collection, with some volumes in the Cambridge University Library.

The collection includes the important collection of early materials concerning St Erkenwald, the &quot;Miracula Sanct Erkenwaldi,&quot; preserved as a 12th-century manuscript in the Matthew Parker collection (Parker 161).

The Parker Library on the Web project has made digital images of all of these manuscripts available online.

<doc id="153641" wikidata="Q2883936" url="?curid=153641" title="Barbara Castle">
<text>Barbara Anne Castle, Baroness Castle of Blackburn, (&quot;née&quot; Betts; 6 October 1910 – 3 May 2002) was a British Labour Party politician who was a Member of Parliament from 1945 to 1979, making her one of the longest-serving female MPs in British history. Regarded as one of the most significant Labour Party politicians, Castle developed a close political partnership with Prime Minister Harold Wilson and held several roles in the Cabinet. She remains to date the only woman to have held the office of First Secretary of State.

A graduate of the University of Oxford, Castle worked as a journalist for both &quot;Tribune&quot; and the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, before being elected to Parliament as MP for Blackburn at the 1945 election. During the Attlee government, she was Parliamentary Private Secretary to Stafford Cripps, and later to Harold Wilson, marking the beginning of their partnership. She was a strong supporter of Wilson during his campaign to become Leader of the Labour Party, and following his victory at the 1964 election, Wilson appointed Castle to the Cabinet as Minister for Overseas Development, and later as Minister of Transport. In the latter role, she proved an effective reformer, overseeing the introduction of permanent speed limits for the first time on British roads, as well as legislating for breathalyser tests and compulsory seat belts.

In 1968, Wilson promoted Castle to become First Secretary of State, the second-most senior member of the Cabinet, as well as Secretary of State for Employment. In the latter role, Castle fiercely advocated the passage of the &quot;In Place of Strife&quot; legislation which would have greatly overhauled the operating framework for British trade unions. The proposal split the Cabinet, and was eventually withdrawn. Castle was also notable for her successful intervention over the strike by Ford sewing machinists against gender pay discrimination, speaking out in support of the strikers, and overseeing the passage of the Equal Pay Act. After Labour unexpectedly lost the 1970 election, some blamed Castle&#x27;s role in the debate over trade unions for the defeat, a charge she resisted.

Upon Labour&#x27;s return to power after the 1974 election, Wilson appointed Castle Secretary of State for Social Services, during which time she was responsible for the creation of Carer&#x27;s Allowance and the passage of the Child Benefit Act. She was also a prominent opponent of Britain&#x27;s continued membership of the European Economic Community during the 1975 referendum. When Castle&#x27;s bitter political rival, James Callaghan, replaced Wilson as Prime Minister in 1976, he sacked her immediately from the Cabinet; the two would remain bitter towards each other for the rest of their lives. Opting to retire from Parliament at the 1979 election, Castle quickly sought election to the European Parliament, representing Greater Manchester from 1979 to 1989; during this time, she was the Leader of the European Parliamentary Labour Party from 1979 to 1985, and publicly reversed her previous stance of Euroscepticism. She became a member of the House of Lords, having been granted a life peerage, in 1990, and remained active in politics until her death in 2002 at the age of 91.

==Early life==
Barbara Anne Betts was born on 6 October 1910 at 64 Derby Road, Chesterfield, the youngest of three children to Frank Betts and his wife Annie Rebecca (&quot;née&quot; Ferrand). Raised in Pontefract, Bradford, and Hyde, Castle grew up in a politically active home and was introduced to socialism from a young age. Her older sister, Marjorie, later became a pioneer of the Inner London Education Authority, while their brother Tristram (almost always called Jimmie) engaged in field work with Oxfam in Nigeria. She joined the Labour Party as a teenager.

Her father was a tax inspector, exempt from military service in the First World War due to his high rank in a reserved occupation. It was because of the nature of the tax-collecting profession, and the promotions he received, that the family frequently moved around the country. Having moved to Bradford in 1922, the Betts family swiftly became involved with the Independent Labour Party. Although her father was prohibited from formal political activity because of his role as a civil servant, he became editor of the &quot;Bradford Pioneer&quot;, the city&#x27;s socialist newspaper, after William Leach was elected to Parliament in 1935. Castle&#x27;s mother ran the family home while also operating a soup kitchen for the town&#x27;s coalminers. After Barbara had left home Annie was elected as a Labour councillor in Bradford.

==Education==
Castle attended Love Lane Elementary School, then Pontefract and District Girls High School. After moving to Bradford at the age of twelve, she attended Bradford Girls&#x27; Grammar School. She became involved in acting at the school and developed oratorical skills. She excelled academically, winning numerous awards from the school. She also organised mock elections at the school, in which she stood as the Labour candidate. There were some aspects of the school that she did not like, notably the presence of many girls from rich families. In her last year she was appointed head girl.

Her education continued at St Hugh&#x27;s College, Oxford, from which she graduated with a third-class BA in Philosophy, politics and economics in 1932. She began serious political activity at Oxford, serving as the Treasurer of the Oxford University Labour Club, the highest position a woman could hold in the club at the time. She struggled to accept the atmosphere of a university that had only recently begun to question its traditionally sexist attitudes. She was scornful of the elitist nature of some elements of the institution, branding the Oxford Union &quot;that cadet class of the establishment&quot;.

==Early career==
Castle was elected to St Pancras Metropolitan Borough Council in 1937 (where she remained until 1945), and in 1943 she spoke at the annual Labour Party Conference for the first time. Throughout the Second World War she worked as a senior administrative officer at the Ministry of Food and she was an Air Raid Precautions (ARP) warden during the Blitz.

She became a reporter on the left-wing magazine &quot;Tribune&quot;, where she had a romantic relationship with William Mellor, who was to become its editor, until his death in 1942. Following her marriage to Ted Castle in 1944, she became the housing correspondent at the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;.

==Member of Parliament (1945–1979)==
In the 1945 general election, which Labour won by a landslide, Castle was elected as the Member of Parliament for Blackburn. As Blackburn was then a two-member constituency, she was elected alongside fellow Labour candidate John Edwards. Castle had secured her place as a parliamentary candidate through the women of the Blackburn Labour Party, who had threatened to quit unless she was added to the otherwise all-male shortlist.

Castle was the youngest of the handful of women elected. Although she had grown up in similar northern industrial towns, she had no prior connection to Blackburn. Eager not to appear as a parachute candidate, she studied weaving and spinning, and spent time living with a local family. In her maiden speech she highlighted the problems facing servicemen then going through demobilization.

Immediately upon her entering the House of Commons Castle was appointed Parliamentary private secretary (PPS) to Stafford Cripps, President of the Board of Trade, who had known her as a member of the pre-war Socialist League. Harold Wilson succeeded Cripps in 1947 and retained Castle as his PPS, marking the beginning of the pair&#x27;s lengthy political relationship. She gained further experience as the UK&#x27;s alternate delegate to the United Nations General Assembly for 1949–1950, when she displayed particular concern for social and humanitarian issues. She soon achieved a reputation as a left-winger and a rousing speaker. During the 1950s she was a high-profile Bevanite, and made a name for herself as a vocal advocate of decolonisation and the Anti-Apartheid Movement.

===Cabinet minister===
====Minister for Overseas Development, 1964–1965====

Labour returned to government under Harold Wilson in October 1964 following a general election, defeating Alec Douglas-Home&#x27;s Conservative government by winning a slim majority of four seats, thus ending 13 years of successive Conservative governments. Wilson had selected his core Cabinet four months prior to the election; Castle knew Wilson intended to place her within his Cabinet, which would make her the fourth woman in British history ever to hold position in a Cabinet, after Margaret Bondfield, Ellen Wilkinson and Florence Horsbrugh.

Castle entered the Cabinet as the first Minister for Overseas Development, a newly created ministry for which she, alongside the Fabian Society, had drawn up the plans. For the previous year she had acted as the opposition spokeswoman on overseas development. Castle&#x27;s plans were extensive, though the ministry&#x27;s budget was modest. She set about trying to divert powers from other departments related to overseas aid, including the Foreign Office and the Treasury. She was only partially successful in her aims and provoked an internal Whitehall dispute in the process.

In June 1965 Castle announced interest-free aid loans would be available to certain (not exclusively Commonwealth) countries. She had previously criticised the Conservative government for granting loans that only waived interest for up to the first seven years, which she considered to be counter-productive.

In August, Castle published the government white paper &quot;Overseas Development: The Work of a New Ministry&quot;. The financial commitments of the ministry were omitted from the report, after a protracted clash between Castle and her cabinet colleagues James Callaghan (Chancellor of the Exchequer) and George Brown (Secretary of State for Economic Affairs). Labour had made a manifesto promise to increase aid spending to 1% of gross national product, almost double Conservative spending. However, the national economy was unstable, public resentment towards the Commonwealth was growing due to immigration, and within Cabinet aid was viewed with either indifference or contempt. Castle grappled with Callaghan and Brown over the department&#x27;s budgetary allocation; they reached a compromise following Wilson&#x27;s intervention, but the sum only amounted to a small increase in spending.

====Minister of Transport, 1965–1968====
Initially reluctant to head up the department, Castle accepted the role of Minister of Transport (23 December 1965 – 6 April 1968) in a Cabinet reshuffle after Wilson proved persuasive.

In February 1966, Castle addressed Parliament, calling for &quot;a profound change in public attitudes&quot; to curtail increasing road fatality figures, stating: &quot;Hitler did not manage to kill as many civilians in Britain as have been killed on our roads since the war&quot;. The statistics bore out; between 1945 and the mid-1960s approximately 150,000 people were killed and several million injured on Britain&#x27;s roads.

She introduced the breathalyzer to combat the then recently acknowledged crisis of drink-driving. Castle said she was &quot;ready to risk unpopularity&quot; by introducing the measures if it meant saving lives. She was challenged by a BBC journalist on &quot;The World This Weekend&quot;, who described the policy as a &quot;rotten idea&quot; and asked her: &quot;You&#x27;re only a woman, you don&#x27;t drive, what do you know about it?&quot; In the 12 months following the introduction of the breathalyser, Government figures revealed road deaths had dropped by 16.5%.

Castle also made permanent the national speed limit (70 mph). Having been introduced as a four-month trial by outgoing Transport Minister Tom Fraser in December 1965, Castle first extended the limit period in 1966 and in 1967 made the limit permanent, following a controversial report from the Road Research Laboratory concluding that motorway casualties had fallen 20% since its introduction.

During a tour of New York City in October 1966, where Castle was examining the impact of traffic problems in American cities, she vocalised plans to introduce a London congestion charge, which was to be introduced as soon as the technical details of fee collection were solved. Castle urged New York&#x27;s Transport Commissioner to adopt the same policy, describing plans for more roadways as &quot;self-defeating&quot;, stating the solution was &quot;more and better mass transit systems&quot;.

Castle also sanctioned the construction of the Humber Bridge, which was the world&#x27;s longest suspension bridge upon its opening in 1981. In late 1965, the Labour MP for nearby Kingston upon Hull North died, triggering a by-election. The marginal seat was of critical importance to the government and its loss would have reduced Labour&#x27;s majority in the House of Commons to just one. Harold Wilson invoked Castle to find the necessary funding and promise the bridge&#x27;s construction as an &#x27;election sweetener&#x27;. The move paid off, with Labour holding the seat.

She presided over the closure of approximately 2,050 miles of railways as she enacted her part of the Beeching cuts—a betrayal of pre-election commitments by the Labour party to halt the proposals. Nevertheless, she refused closure of several lines, one example being the Looe Valley Line in Cornwall, and introduced the first Government rail subsidies for socially necessary but unprofitable railways in the Transport Act 1968.

One of her most memorable achievements as Transport minister was to pass legislation decreeing that all new cars had to be fitted with seat belts. Despite being appointed to the Ministry of Transport, a role which she was originally unenthusiastic about, Castle could not actually drive herself, and was chauffeured to functions. (The Labour politician Hazel Blears recalled driving Castle at one time as a young Labour Party activist in the 1980s.) Despite her lack of a driving licence, she attracted controversy when she told local government leaders to give added emphasis to motor vehicle access in urban areas, as &quot;most pedestrians are walking to or from their cars.&quot;

Castle and her husband, Edward Castle, bought a new flat in John Spencer Square in late 1967 while she was the Minister of Transport.

====First Secretary of State and Secretary of State for Employment, 1968–1970====
As Secretary of State for Employment, Castle was also appointed First Secretary of State by Wilson, bringing her firmly into the heart of government. She was never far from controversy which reached a fever pitch when the trade unions rebelled against her proposals to reduce their powers in her 1969 white paper, &#x27;In Place of Strife&#x27;. This also involved a major cabinet split, with threatened resignations, hot tempers and her future nemesis James Callaghan breaking ranks to publicly try to undermine the bill. The whole episode alienated her from many of her friends on the left, with the &quot;Tribune&quot; newspaper railing very hard against the bill, which they held to be attacking the workers without attacking the bosses. The split is often said to have been partly responsible for Labour&#x27;s defeat at the 1970 general election. The eventual deal with the unions dropped most of the contentious clauses.

Castle also helped make history when she intervened in the Ford sewing machinists&#x27; strike of 1968, in which the women of the Dagenham Ford Plant demanded to be paid the same as their male counterparts. She helped resolve the strike, which resulted in a pay rise for Ford&#x27;s female workers bringing them to 92 per cent of what the men received. Most significantly, as a consequence of this strike, Castle put through the Equal Pay Act 1970. A 2010 British film, &quot;Made in Dagenham&quot;, was based on the Ford strike. She was portrayed by Miranda Richardson.

In April 1970, Castle&#x27;s husband, Ted, lost his position as an alderman of the Greater London Council. He was devastated and although he was supportive of his wife&#x27;s achievements, he considered himself a failure compared to her. Upset and concerned by her husband&#x27;s distress, Barbara persuaded Wilson to grant Ted a peerage.

===Opposition===
In May 1970, Wilson called a general election, held on 18 June. The Conservative Party, led by Edward Heath, enjoyed a surprise victory, despite opinion polling indicating a steady lead for Labour in the run-up. Castle privately blamed complacency within Labour for their loss and had expressed scepticism about their poll lead, writing in her diaries: &quot;I have a haunting feeling there is a silent majority sitting behind its lace curtains waiting to come out and vote Tory.&quot;

In the immediate aftermath of the government&#x27;s defeat, Castle found she was out of favour with Wilson. The day following the general election, Wilson held a final inner Cabinet meeting at Downing Street, to which Castle was not invited. Eager to make contact, she later called him at Chequers, where Wilson engaged in a brusque telephone conversation with her.

Refusing to acknowledge her career had been curtailed, Castle proposed to run for deputy leadership of the Parliamentary Labour Party. When she informed Wilson of her plans he was furious; Castle&#x27;s reputation within the party had been damaged by the failure of &quot;In Place of Strife&quot; and Wilson censured her, claiming her plan would split the party. In an act of retribution for her challenge to the deputy leadership, Wilson impeded Ted Castle&#x27;s peerage, which he had all but promised prior to the general election.

Despite not being elected to the Shadow Cabinet, Castle remained as the Labour shadow spokesperson on Employment. The new Government introduced many of her policy suggestions as part of their Industrial Relations Act. When she was attacking the Conservative bill, the government simply pointed to her own white paper, following which Wilson reshuffled her first to the health portfolio and then out of the shadow cabinet.

===Return to Cabinet===
====Secretary of State for Social Services, 1974–1976====
Despite having been on the Labour back benches since 1972 and not part of the shadow cabinet, in 1974, following Harold Wilson&#x27;s defeat of Edward Heath, Castle became Secretary of State for Social Services. While serving in this position, Castle introduced a wide range of innovative welfare reforms, including the introduction of the mobility allowance, the Invalid Care Allowance (July 1976) for single women and others who give up their jobs to care for severely disabled relatives, the introduction of a non-contributory invalidity pension for disabled persons who had not qualified for invalidity pension, reforms in child allowances, and the linking of most social security benefits to earnings rather than prices. She sought to remove private &quot;pay beds&quot; from the NHS, in conflict with the British Medical Association.

In the 1975 referendum debate she took a Eurosceptic stance. During a debate with Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe he asked her whether, if the vote would be yes, she would stay on as a minister. To this she replied: &quot;If the vote is yes my country will need me to save it.&quot; Despite her views she later became a Member of the European Parliament (1979–1989). Her public support of leaving the EEC infuriated Wilson. Castle recorded in her diary and in her subsequent autobiography that Wilson summoned her to Downing Street where he angrily accused her of disloyalty and that, as he had brought her back into the cabinet against others&#x27; wishes and advice, he deserved better from her. Castle claimed she offered to resign, but Wilson calmed down and she continued to campaign for leaving in the referendum.

In 1975, Castle introduced the Child Benefit Act, superseding the Family Allowances Act 1945. The act provided new support for families&#x27; first child, unlike the previous system in place, which provided benefit for second and subsequent children. Castle also ensured child benefit would be paid directly to mothers, not fathers, unlike Family Allowance, the previous system in place. The legislation faced opposition from unions whose male members would receive less take-home pay with the loss of Family Allowance.

Castle remained in cabinet until Wilson&#x27;s resignation in March 1976. The head of the Downing Street policy unit, Bernard Donoughue, records in his diary that he warned Wilson that Castle&#x27;s dogged pursuit of personal policy stances on public health would &quot;wreck the NHS&quot;. Donoughue claims that Wilson agreed, but admitted he would leave it to his successor to resolve.

Castle lost her place as a Cabinet minister when her bitter political enemy James Callaghan succeeded Wilson as prime minister following a leadership election. Although he left Wilson&#x27;s Cabinet virtually unchanged, he dismissed Castle almost immediately upon taking office, in the midst of a complex health bill that she was steering through the House of Commons at the time. Although he had not yet decided on her successor at the time he fired her, Callaghan removed her under the pretext he wanted to lower the average age of his Cabinet, which she regarded as a &quot;phoney reason&quot;. In an interview years later, she remarked that perhaps the most restrained thing she had ever achieved in her life was not to reply with &quot;Then why not start with yourself, Jim?&quot; (Callaghan was four years older than Wilson, the man he was replacing, and less than 18 months younger than Castle). Castle was angry to discover that Wilson had broken a private confidence in informing Callaghan that she had intended to retire from the cabinet before the next election.

==European Parliament (1979–1989)==

Less than a month after she left Westminster in 1979 she stood for and was elected to the European Parliament, writing in the &quot;Tribune&quot; that &quot;politics is not just about policies: it is about fighting for them in every available forum and at every opportunity.&quot; In 1982 she wrote in the &quot;New Statesman&quot; that Labour should abandon its opposition to British membership of the EEC and that the UK should fight its corner inside it. This led her former ally Ian Mikardo to say to her: &quot;Your name is mud&quot;.

She represented Greater Manchester North from 1979 to 1984, and was then elected to represent Greater Manchester West from 1984 to 1989. She was at that time the only British MEP to have held a cabinet position.

Castle led Labour&#x27;s delegation in the European Parliament. She also served as vice-chair of the Socialist Group, a member of the Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Rural Development, and a member of the Delegation for Relations with Malta.

&quot;The Castle Diaries&quot; were published in two volumes in 1980 and 1984, chronicling her time in office from 1964 to 1976 and providing insights into the workings of cabinet government. Edmund Dell, reviewing the diaries that cover the years 1974–76 in the &quot;London Review of Books&quot;, wrote that the volume &quot;shows more about the nature of cabinet government – even though it deals with only one Cabinet – than any previous publication, academic, political or biographical. It is, I think, better than Crossman&quot;. Michael Foot in the &quot;Listener&quot; claimed that the book, &quot;whatever else it is or not, is a human document, hopelessly absorbing&quot;. Paul Johnson wrote in the &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot; that it was &quot;a contribution of first-rate importance to our knowledge of modern politics&quot;.

==Life peer==
In 1974 Ted Castle was made a life peer. This meant that Barbara was now formally Lady Castle, though she chose not to use this courtesy title. Ted Castle died in 1979. On 16 July 1990 she was created a life peer in her own right, as Baroness Castle of Blackburn, of Ibstone in the County of Buckinghamshire. She remained active in politics up until her death, attacking the then Chancellor, Gordon Brown, at the Labour party conference in 2001 for his refusal to link pensions to earnings.

Castle was a critic of Blairism and &quot;New Labour&quot;, in particular on economic policy, which she perceived as involving acceptance of &quot;market economics, unchallenged globalization and the dominance of the multinationals&quot;. She also accused Blairites of distorting and dismissing the Labour Party&#x27;s past, stating in an interview published in the &quot;New Statesman&quot; in 2000, the year of the party&#x27;s centenary:&quot;They do not seem to have realised that all governments, whatever their complexion, end in apparent failure. Macmillan was triumphant in 1959 and was biting the dust shortly afterwards. Heath won in 1970, and spent three and half years doing U-turns, looking for the perfect answer. Thatcher was a remarkable woman, but her premiership ended in ignominy. But the current leadership seems preoccupied by the failing of Labour in power and in opposition.&quot;

==Death==
Barbara Castle died of pneumonia and chronic lung disease at Hell Corner Farm, her home in Ibstone, Buckinghamshire, on 3 May 2002.

==Legacy==

Castle has been acknowledged as the most important female Labour politician of the 20th century. An adept and gripping orator, Castle gained a reputation as a strong-willed, sometimes single-minded crusader. Political commentator Andrew Marr wrote of Castle in 1993: &quot;Performance has been at the centre of her career. She makes excellent television and was a good Commons speaker. But she was really made for the platform, either at Labour conferences or during election campaigns. There, her wit, self-confidence and theatricality were displayed. A good Castle speech is unforgettable.&quot;

She was admired by Bill Deedes, Conservative politician and editor of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, for &quot;her astonishing tenacity, her capacity for getting her own way in Cabinet and nearly everywhere else,&quot; though he derided her politics. To her allies, Castle was loyal and would fiercely defend them. Colleague Roy Hattersley credited her with saving his career by insisting he remain her junior Minister when Harold Wilson attempted to sack him. Nevertheless, she remained unforgiving of her enemies; when questioned on James Callaghan in a 2000 interview in the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, Castle said: &quot;I think it is safest all round if I don&#x27;t comment on him.&quot;

Referred to disparagingly by fellow Labour MP Gerald Kaufman as &quot;the Norma Desmond of politics [...] always ready for her close-up&quot;, she was noted for always paying particular attention to her appearance. Variously described as sophisticated, stylish and glamorous, Castle was also characterised as vain, while her critics called her egocentric. Former Labour leader Neil Kinnock recalled she was distraught when her hairdresser cancelled before a television appearance; in response, Castle said: &quot;If you&#x27;re a woman in the public eye, getting your hair nice is a constant preoccupation.&quot; Her weekly appointments with her hairdresser were &quot;an essential Friday engagement&quot; according to Hattersley, although she occasionally wore a wig – which she nicknamed Lucy – for public appearances without the benefit of her hairdresser to hand.
In 2008, Castle was named by &quot;The Guardian&quot; as one of four of &quot;Labour&#x27;s greatest heroes&quot; and in 2016 she was named on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Woman&#x27;s Hour&quot; Power List as one of seven women judged to have had the biggest impact on women&#x27;s lives over the past 70 years, alongside Margaret Thatcher, Helen Brook, Germaine Greer, Jayaben Desai, Bridget Jones, and Beyoncé. Several women politicians have cited Castle as an inspiration for embarking on their careers, including Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry, Tulip Siddiq, and former Conservative MP Edwina Currie.

Since Castle&#x27;s death there had been several plans mooted to memorialise her with a statue in her constituency town of Blackburn. In October 2021 a bronze statue of her was unveiled in Blackburn. The sculptor was Sam Holland. Castle is caught in mid-stride as she carries a copy of the Equal Pay Act 1970. In the town a dual carriageway that constitutes part of the ring road is named Barbara Castle Way.

She was commemorated on a postage stamp issued as part of the Royal Mail&#x27;s Women of Distinction series in 2008 for piloting the Equal Pay Act through parliament. She appears on the 81p denomination.

Castle was portrayed by British actress Miranda Richardson in the 2010 film &quot;Made in Dagenham&quot;, dealing with the 1968 strike at the Ford Dagenham assembly plant. She was later portrayed by stage actress Sophie-Louise Dann in the 2014 West End musical adaptation of the film. In the third series of Netflix drama &quot;The Crown&quot;, Castle is portrayed by Lorraine Ashbourne. In the BBC One drama &quot;The Trial of Christine Keeler&quot; (2019–2020) Castle is portrayed by Buffy Davis.

==Honours and awards==
Barbara Castle was a recipient of the Order of the Companions of O. R. Tambo in Silver, a South African award to foreign nationals for friendship with that country. In a statement the South African government recognised Castle&#x27;s &quot;outstanding contribution to the struggle against apartheid, and the establishment of a non-sexist, non-racial and democratic South Africa&quot;. Castle was an active supporter of the Anti-Apartheid Movement (AAM) in Britain from the very start of its existence.

In 1990 Castle received a Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany for &quot;services to European democracy&quot;.

In 2002 Castle was posthumously awarded an honorary doctorate by the Open University for public service in areas of special educational concern to the university.

In September 2008 Northern Rail, Blackburn with Darwen Borough Council and the PTEG (Passenger Transport Executive Group) named a train after her. The plaque was unveiled by Castle&#x27;s niece, Sonya Hinton, and Ruth Kelly MP, then Secretary of State for Transport. A commemorative brochure was produced by the PTEG for the event.

<text>Martin Bucer (; Early German: &quot;Martin Butzer&quot;; 11 November 1491 – 28 February 1551) was a German Protestant reformer based in Strasbourg who influenced Lutheran, Calvinist, and Anglican doctrines and practices. Bucer was originally a member of the Dominican Order, but after meeting and being influenced by Martin Luther in 1518 he arranged for his monastic vows to be annulled. He then began to work for the Reformation, with the support of Franz von Sickingen.

Bucer&#x27;s efforts to reform the church in Wissembourg resulted in his excommunication from the Catholic Church, and he was forced to flee to Strasbourg. There he joined a team of reformers which included Matthew Zell, Wolfgang Capito, and Caspar Hedio. He acted as a mediator between the two leading reformers, Martin Luther and Huldrych Zwingli, who differed on the doctrine of the Eucharist. Later, Bucer sought agreement on common articles of faith such as the Tetrapolitan Confession and the Wittenberg Concord, working closely with Philipp Melanchthon on the latter.

Bucer believed that the Catholics in the Holy Roman Empire could be convinced to join the Reformation. Through a series of conferences organised by Charles V, he tried to unite Protestants and Catholics to create a German national church separate from Rome. He did not achieve this, as political events led to the Schmalkaldic War and the retreat of Protestantism within the Empire. In 1548, Bucer was persuaded, under duress, to sign the Augsburg Interim, which imposed certain forms of Catholic worship. However, he continued to promote reforms until the city of Strasbourg accepted the Interim, and forced him to leave.

In 1549, Bucer was exiled to England, where, under the guidance of Thomas Cranmer, he was able to influence both Edwardine Ordinals and the second revision of the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;. He died in Cambridge, England, at the age of 59. Although his ministry did not lead to the formation of a new denomination, many Protestant denominations have claimed him as one of their own. He is remembered as an early pioneer of ecumenism.

==Historical context==

In the 16th century, the Holy Roman Empire was a centralised state in name only. The Empire was divided into many princely and city states that provided a powerful check on the rule of the Holy Roman Emperor. The division of power between the emperor and the various states made the Reformation in Germany possible, as individual states defended reformers within their territories. In the Electorate of Saxony, Martin Luther was supported by the elector Frederick III and his successors John and John Frederick. Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse—whose lands lay midway between Saxony and the Rhine—also supported the Reformation, and he figured prominently in the lives of both Luther and Bucer. The Emperor Charles V had to balance the demands of his imperial subjects. At the same time, he was often distracted by war with France and the Ottoman Empire and in Italy. The political rivalry among all the players greatly influenced the ecclesiastical developments within the Empire.

In addition to the princely states, free imperial cities, nominally under the control of the Emperor but really ruled by councils that acted like sovereign governments, were scattered throughout the Empire. As the Reformation took root, clashes broke out in many cities between local reformers and conservative city magistrates. It was in a free imperial city, Strasbourg, that Martin Bucer began his work. Located on the western frontier of the Empire, Strasbourg was closely allied with the Swiss cities that had thrown off the imperial yoke. Some had adopted a reformed religion distinct from Lutheranism, in which humanist social concepts and the communal ethic played a greater role. Along with a group of free imperial cities in the south and west of the German lands, Strasbourg followed this pattern of Reformation. It was ruled by a complex local government largely under the control of a few powerful families and wealthy guildsmen. In Bucer&#x27;s time, social unrest was growing as lower-level artisans resented their social immobility and the widening income gap. The citizens may not have planned revolution, but they were receptive to new ideas that might transform their lives.

==Early years (1491–1523)==
Martin Bucer was born in Sélestat (Schlettstadt), Alsace, a free imperial city of the Holy Roman Empire. His father and grandfather, both named Claus Butzer, were coopers (barrelmakers) by trade. Almost nothing is known about Bucer&#x27;s mother. Bucer likely attended Sélestat&#x27;s prestigious Latin school, where artisans sent their children. He completed his studies in the summer of 1507 and joined the Dominican Order as a novice. Bucer later claimed his grandfather had forced him into the order. After a year, he was consecrated as an acolyte in the Strasbourg church of the Williamites, and he took his vows as a full Dominican friar. In 1510, he was ordained as a deacon.

By 1515, Bucer was studying theology in the Dominican monastery in Heidelberg. The following year, he took a course in dogmatics in Mainz, where he was ordained a priest, returning to Heidelberg in January 1517 to enroll in the university. Around this time, he became influenced by humanism, and he started buying books published by Johannes Froben, some by the great humanist Erasmus. A 1518 inventory of Bucer&#x27;s books includes the major works of Thomas Aquinas, leader of medieval scholasticism in the Dominican Order.

In April 1518, Johannes von Staupitz, the vicar-general of the Augustinians, invited the Wittenberg reformer Martin Luther to argue his theology at the Heidelberg Disputation. Here Bucer met Luther for the first time. In a long letter to his mentor, Beatus Rhenanus, Bucer recounted what he learned, and he commented on several of Luther&#x27;s &quot;Ninety-five Theses&quot;. He largely agreed with them and perceived the ideas of Luther and Erasmus to be in concordance. Because meeting Luther posed certain risks, he asked Rhenanus to ensure his letter did not fall into the wrong hands. He also wrote his will, which contains the inventory of his books. In early 1519, Bucer received the &quot;baccalaureus&quot; degree, and that summer he stated his theological views in a disputation before the faculty at Heidelberg, revealing his break with Aquinas and scholasticism.
The events that caused Bucer to leave the Dominican Order arose from his embrace of new ideas and his growing contact with other humanists and reformers. A fellow Dominican, Jacob van Hoogstraaten, the Grand Inquisitor of Cologne, tried to prosecute Johann Reuchlin, a humanist scholar. Other humanists, including the nobles Ulrich von Hutten and Imperial Knight Franz von Sickingen, took Reuchlin&#x27;s side. Hoogstraten was thwarted, but he now planned to target Bucer. On 11 November 1520, Bucer told the reformer Wolfgang Capito in a letter that Hoogstraaten was threatening to make an example of him as a follower of Luther. To escape Dominican jurisdiction, Bucer needed to be freed of his monastic vows. Capito and others were able to expedite the annulment of his vows, and on 29 April 1521 he was formally released from the Dominican Order.

For the next two years, Bucer was protected by Sickingen and Hutten. He also worked for a time at the court of Ludwig V, Elector Palatine, as chaplain to Ludwig&#x27;s younger brother Frederick. Sickingen was a senior figure at Ludwig&#x27;s court. This appointment enabled Bucer to live in Nuremberg, the most powerful city of the Empire, whose governing officials were strongly reformist. There he met many people who shared his viewpoint, including the humanist Willibald Pirckheimer and the future Nuremberg reformer Andreas Osiander. In September 1521, Bucer accepted Sickingen&#x27;s offer of the position of pastor at Landstuhl, where Sickingen had a castle, and Bucer moved to the town in May 1522. In summer 1522, he met and married Elisabeth Silbereisen, a former nun.

Sickingen also offered to pay for Bucer to study in Wittenberg. On his way, Bucer stopped in the town of Wissembourg, whose leading reformer, Heinrich Motherer, asked him to become his chaplain. Bucer agreed to interrupt his journey and went to work immediately, preaching daily sermons in which he attacked traditional church practices and monastic orders. On the basis of his belief that the Bible was the sole source for knowledge to attain salvation (&quot;sola scriptura&quot;), he preached that the Mass should not be considered as the recrucifying of Christ, but rather the reception of God&#x27;s gift of salvation through Christ. He accused the monks of creating additional rules above what is contained in the Bible. He summarised his convictions in six theses, and called for a public disputation. His opponents, the local Franciscans and Dominicans, ignored him, but his sermons incited the townspeople to threaten the town&#x27;s monasteries. The bishop of Speyer reacted by excommunicating Bucer, and although the town council continued to support him, events beyond Wissembourg left Bucer in danger. His leading benefactor, Franz von Sickingen, was defeated and killed during the Knights&#x27; War, and Ulrich von Hutten became a fugitive. The Wissembourg council urged Bucer and Motherer to leave, and on 13 May 1523 they fled to nearby Strasbourg.

==Reformer in Strasbourg (1523–1525)==
Bucer, excommunicated and without means of subsistence, was in a precarious situation when he arrived in Strasbourg. He was not a citizen of the city, a status that afforded protection, and on 9 June 1523 he wrote an urgent letter to the Zürich reformer, Huldrych Zwingli, pleading for a safe post in Switzerland. Fortunately for Bucer, the Strasbourg council was under the influence of the reformer, Matthew Zell; during Bucer&#x27;s first few months in the city he worked as Zell&#x27;s unofficial chaplain and was able to give classes on books of the Bible. The largest guild in Strasbourg, the &quot;Gärtner&quot; or Gardeners, appointed him as the pastor of St Aurelia&#x27;s Church on 24 August 1523. A month later the council accepted his application for citizenship.
In Strasbourg, Bucer joined a team of notable reformers: Zell, who took the role of the preacher to the masses; Wolfgang Capito, the most influential theologian in the city; and Caspar Hedio, the cathedral preacher. One of Bucer&#x27;s first actions in the cause of reform was to debate with Thomas Murner, a monk who had attacked Luther in satires. While the city council vacillated on religious issues, the number of people supporting the Reformation and hostile towards the traditional clergy had grown.

The hostility reached a boiling point when Conrad Treger, the prior provincial of the Augustinians, denounced the reformist preachers and the burghers of Strasbourg as heretics. On 5 September 1524, angry mobs broke into the monasteries, looting and destroying religious images. Many opponents of the Reformation were arrested, including Treger. After the council requested an official statement from the reformers, Bucer drafted twelve articles summarising the teachings of the Reformation, including justification by faith (&quot;sola fide&quot;). He rejected the Mass and Catholic concepts such as monastic vows, veneration of saints, and purgatory. He refused to recognise the authority of the pope and instead emphasised obedience to the government. Treger was released on 12 October and left Strasbourg. With his departure, overt opposition to the Reformation ended in the city.

The reformers&#x27; first goal was the creation of a new order of service—at this time the Strasbourg reformers followed Zwingli&#x27;s liturgy. They presented proposals for a common order of service for the entire Reformation movement to the theologians of Wittenberg and Zürich. In Bucer&#x27;s book &quot;Grund und Ursach&quot; (Basis and Cause), published in December 1524, he attacked the idea of the Mass as a sacrifice, and rejected liturgical garments, the altar, and certain forms of ritual. It was also this publication that acknowledged the introduction of congregational German hymn singing in the city. (Only his preface to the 1541 &quot;Gesangbuch&quot; surpassed it in terms of musical significance.) By May 1525, liturgical reforms had been implemented in Strasbourg&#x27;s parish churches, but the city council decided to allow masses to continue in the cathedral and in the collegiate churches St. Thomas, Young St Peter, and Old St Peter.

==Dialogue with Luther and Zwingli (1524–1530)==

Beginning in 1524, Bucer concentrated on the main issue dividing leading reformers, the eucharist. In this dispute, he attempted to mediate between Martin Luther and Huldrych Zwingli. The two theologians disagreed on whether the body and blood of Christ were physically present within the elements of bread and wine during the celebration of the Lord&#x27;s Supper. Luther believed in a corporeal or physical real presence of Christ; and Zwingli believed Christ&#x27;s body and blood were made present by the Holy Spirit. By late 1524, Bucer had abandoned the idea of corporeal real presence and, after some exegetical studies, accepted Zwingli&#x27;s interpretation. However, he did not believe the Reformation depended on either position but on faith in Christ, other matters being secondary. In this respect he differed from Zwingli.

In March 1526, Bucer published &quot;Apologia&quot;, defending his views. He proposed a formula that he hoped would satisfy both sides: different understandings of scripture were acceptable, and church unity was assured so long as both sides had a &quot;child-like faith in God&quot;. Bucer stated that his and Zwingli&#x27;s interpretation on the eucharist was the correct one, but while he considered the Wittenberg theologians to be in error, he accepted them as brethren as they agreed on the fundamentals of faith. He also published two translations of works by Luther and Johannes Bugenhagen, interpolating his own interpretation of the Lord&#x27;s Supper into the text. This outraged the Wittenberg theologians and damaged their relations with Bucer. In 1528, when Luther published , detailing Luther&#x27;s concept of the sacramental union, Bucer responded with a treatise of his own, . It took the form of a dialogue between two merchants, one from Nuremberg who supported Luther and the other from Strasbourg who supported Bucer, with the latter winning over his opponent. Bucer noted that as Luther had rejected impanation, the idea that Christ was &quot;made into bread&quot;, there was no disagreement between Luther and Zwingli; both believed in a spiritual presence of Christ in the eucharist. Luther harshly rejected Bucer&#x27;s interpretation.

During this time, Bucer and Zwingli remained in close touch, discussing other aspects of theology and practice such as the use of religious images and the liturgy. Bucer did not hesitate to disagree with Zwingli on occasion, although unity between Strasbourg and the Swiss churches took priority over such differences. In 1527, Bucer and Capito attended the Bern Disputation to decide whether the city should accept reformed doctrines and practices. Bucer provided strong support for Zwingli&#x27;s leading role in the disputation, which finally brought the Reformation to Bern.

The last meeting between Zwingli and Luther was at the Marburg Colloquy of October 1529, organised by Philip of Hesse and attended by various leading reformers, including Bucer. Luther and Zwingli agreed on 13 of the 14 topics discussed, but Zwingli did not accept the doctrine of the real presence, on which Luther would not compromise. After the discussion broke down between the two, Bucer tried to salvage the situation, but Luther noted, &quot;It is obvious that we do not have one and the same spirit.&quot; The meeting ended in failure. The following year, Bucer wrote of his disappointment at doctrinal inflexibility:
==Competing Protestant confessions (1530–1533)==

The extent of the theological division among the reformers became evident when the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V asked them to present their views to him in 1530 at the Diet of Augsburg. Philipp Melanchthon, the main delegate from Wittenberg, quickly prepared the draft that eventually became the Augsburg Confession. The Wittenberg theologians rejected attempts by Strasbourg to adopt it without the article on the Lord&#x27;s Supper. In response, Bucer wrote a new confession, the &quot;Confessio Tetrapolitana&quot; (Tetrapolitan Confession), so named because only four cities adopted it, Strasbourg and three other southern German cities, Konstanz, Memmingen, and Lindau. A copy of Melanchthon&#x27;s draft was used as the starting point and the only major change was the wording on the article on the eucharist. According to Eells, the article on the eucharist in the Tetrapolitan Confession stated, &quot;In this sacrament his true body and true blood are truly given to eat and drink, as food for their souls, and to eternal life, that they may remain in him and he in them&quot;. The ambiguous word &quot;truly&quot; was not defined.

Charles, however, decreed on 22 September that all reformers must reconcile with the Catholic faith, or he would use military force to suppress them. This prompted Melanchthon to call a meeting with Bucer and after lengthy discussions they agreed on nine theses, which they sent to Luther and to Strasbourg. The Strasbourg magistrates forwarded them to Basel and Zürich. Bucer met Luther in Coburg on 26–28 September. Luther still rejected Bucer&#x27;s theses, but he encouraged him to continue the search for unity. Bucer then traveled to several southern German cities, including Ulm, Isny, Konstanz, Memmingen, and Lindau, and to the Swiss cities of Basel and Zürich. In Zurich on 12 October, he presented the articles to Zwingli, who neither opposed him nor agreed with him.

In February 1531, the evangelical princes and cities of the empire set up the Protestant Schmalkaldic League to defend the reformed religion. Strasbourg&#x27;s Jakob Sturm negotiated the city&#x27;s inclusion on the basis of the Tetrapolitan Confession. By this time, Bucer&#x27;s relationship with Zwingli was deteriorating. Strasbourg&#x27;s political ties with the Elector of Saxony, and Bucer&#x27;s partial theological support of Luther, became too much for Zwingli, and on 21 February 1531, he wrote to Bucer ending their friendship. When representatives of the southern German cities convened in Ulm on 23–24 March 1532 to discuss their alliance with the Schmalkaldic League, Bucer advised them to sign the Augsburg Confession, if they were being pressured to do so. For Bucer to recommend the rival confession over his own version surprised the Swiss cities. Luther continued his polemical attacks on Bucer, but Bucer was unperturbed: &quot;In any case, we must seek unity and love in our relationships with everyone,&quot; he wrote, &quot;regardless of how they behave toward us.&quot; In April and May 1533, he again toured the southern German cities and Swiss cities. The latter remained unconvinced and did not join the Protestant alliance.

==Organising the Strasbourg church (1529–1534)==

While these events unfolded, the reformers in Strasbourg were slowly making progress. Their pressure on the council to ban all masses finally succeeded. On 20 February 1529, Strasbourg openly joined the Reformation when the practice of the mass was officially suspended. In its place, two preaching services (&quot;Predigtgottesdienste&quot;) per Sunday were held in all the parish churches. On 5 January 1530, when Strasbourg joined the alliance of Swiss cities, the , the council systematically removed images and side altars from the churches. Bucer had at first tolerated images in places of worship as long as they were not venerated. He later came to believe they should be removed because of their potential for abuse, and he advocated in a treatise for their orderly removal. First the authority of the magistrates should be obtained, and then the people instructed on abandoning devotion to images.

Bucer&#x27;s priority in Strasbourg was to instill moral discipline in the church. To this end, special wardens (&quot;Kirchenpfleger&quot;), chosen from among the laity, were assigned to each congregation to supervise both doctrine and practice. His concerns were motivated by the effects of a rapidly rising refugee population, attracted by Strasbourg&#x27;s tolerant asylum policies. Influxes of refugees, particularly after 1528, had brought a series of revolutionary preachers into Strasbourg. These men were inspired by a variety of apocalyptic and mystical doctrines, and in some cases by hostility towards the social order and the notion of an official church. Significant numbers of refugees were Anabaptists and spiritualists, such as the followers of Melchior Hoffman, Caspar Schwenckfeld, and Clemens Ziegler. Bucer personally took responsibility for attacking these and other popular preachers to minimize their influence and secure their expulsion and that of their followers. On 30 November 1532, the pastors and wardens of the church petitioned the council to enforce ethical standards, officially sanction the reformed faith, and refute the &quot;sectarian&quot; doctrines. The ruling authorities, who had allowed sectarian congregations to thrive among the refugees and lower orders, would only expel the obvious troublemakers. Bucer insisted that the council urgently take control of all Christian worship in the city for the common good.

In response to the petition, the council set up a commission that proposed a city synod. For this gathering, Bucer provided a draft document of sixteen articles on church doctrine. The synod convened on 3 June 1533 at the Church of the Penitent Magdalens to debate Bucer&#x27;s text, eventually accepting it in full. Sectarian leaders were brought before the synod and questioned by Bucer. Ziegler was dismissed and allowed to stay in Strasbourg; Hoffmann was imprisoned as a danger to the state; and Schwenckfeld left Strasbourg of his own accord.

Following the synod, the city council dragged its heels for several months. The synod commission, which included Bucer and Capito, decided to take the initiative and produced a draft ordinance for the regulation of the church. It proposed that the council assume almost complete control of the church, with responsibility for supervising doctrine, appointing church wardens, and maintaining moral standards. Still the council delayed, driving the pastors to the brink of resignation. Only when Hoffman&#x27;s followers seized power in Münster, in the Münster Rebellion, did the council act, fearing a similar incident in Strasbourg. On 4 March 1534, the council announced that Bucer&#x27;s Tetrapolitan Confession and his sixteen articles on church doctrine were now official church statements of faith. All Anabaptists should either subscribe to these documents or leave the city. The decision established a new church in Strasbourg, with Capito declaring, &quot;Bucer is the bishop of our church.&quot;

==Champion of Protestant unity (1534–1538)==

By 1534, Bucer was a key figure in the German Reformation. He repeatedly led initiatives to secure doctrinal agreement between Wittenberg, the south German cities, and Switzerland. In December 1534, Bucer and Melanchthon held productive talks in Kassel, and Bucer then drafted ten theses that the Wittenberg theologians accepted. In October 1535, Luther suggested a meeting in Eisenach to conclude a full agreement among the Protestant factions. Bucer persuaded the south Germans to attend, but the Swiss, led by Zwingli&#x27;s successor Heinrich Bullinger, were skeptical of his intentions. Instead they met in Basel on 1 February 1536 to draft their own confession of faith. Bucer and Capito attended and urged the Swiss to adopt a compromise wording on the eucharist that would not offend the Lutherans. The true presence of Christ was acknowledged while a natural or local union between Christ and the elements was denied. The result was the First Helvetic Confession, the success of which raised Bucer&#x27;s hopes for the upcoming meeting with Luther.

The meeting, moved to Wittenberg because Luther was ill, began on 21 May 1536. To the surprise of the south Germans, Luther began by attacking them, demanding that they recant their false understanding of the eucharist. Capito intervened to calm matters, and Bucer claimed that Luther had misunderstood their views on the issue. The Lutherans insisted that unbelievers who partake of the eucharist truly receive the body and blood of Christ. Bucer and the south Germans believed that they receive only the elements of the bread and the wine. Johannes Bugenhagen formulated a compromise, approved by Luther, that distinguished between the unworthy (&quot;indigni&quot;) and the unbelievers (&quot;impii&quot;). The south Germans accepted that the unworthy receive Christ, and the question of what unbelievers receive was left unanswered. The two sides then worked fruitfully on other issues and on 28 May signed the Wittenberg Concord. Strasbourg quickly endorsed the document, but much coaxing from Bucer was required before he managed to convince all the south German cities. The Swiss cities were resistant, Zürich in particular. They rejected even a mild statement suggesting a union of Christ with the elements of the eucharist. Bucer advised the Swiss to hold a national synod to decide on the matter, hoping he could at least persuade Bern and Basel. The synod met in Zürich from 28 May to 4 April 1538, but Bucer failed to win over a single city. The Swiss never accepted or rejected the Wittenberg Concord.

Bucer&#x27;s influence on the Swiss was eventually felt indirectly. In summer 1538, he invited John Calvin, the future reformer of Geneva, to lead a French refugee congregation in Strasbourg. Bucer and Calvin had much in common theologically and maintained a long friendship. The extent to which Bucer influenced Calvin is an open question among modern scholars, but many of the reforms that Calvin later implemented in Geneva, including the liturgy and the church organisation, were originally developed in Strasbourg.

==Advice to Philip of Hesse (1538–1539)==
When Philip of Hesse&#x27;s law on the protection of the Jews in his territory expired in 1538, he commissioned Bucer to create a new policy. Philip gave him a draft that was tolerant in the regulation of their affairs. Bucer rejected the favourable conditions and recommended that Jews be prohibited from all trades except those providing minimum subsistence. His &quot;Judenratschlag&quot; also included his first use of negative stereotypes of the Jews. Philip&#x27;s ordinance of 1539 represented a compromise. He allowed the Jews to engage in trade and commerce but included strict rules on their association with Christians. The potential for an arbitrary enforcement of the new policy was frightening, and as a result many Jews chose to leave Hesse. For this Bucer must share part of the blame.

In November 1539, Philip asked Bucer to produce a theological defence of bigamy, since he had decided to contract a bigamous marriage. Bucer reluctantly agreed, on condition the marriage be kept secret. Bucer consulted Luther and Melanchthon, and the three reformers presented Philip with a statement of advice (&quot;Wittenberger Ratschlag&quot;); later, Bucer produced his own arguments for and against bigamy. Although the document specified that bigamy could be sanctioned only under rare conditions, Philip took it as approval for his marriage to a lady-in-waiting of his sister. When rumours of the marriage spread, Luther told Philip to deny it, while Bucer advised him to hide his second wife and conceal the truth. Some scholars have noted a possible motivation for this notorious advice: the theologians believed they had advised Philip as a pastor would his parishioner, and that a lie was justified to guard the privacy of their confessional counsel. The scandal that followed the marriage caused Philip to lose political influence, and the Reformation within the Empire was severely compromised.

==Doctrinal issues (1539–1542)==
At the end of 1538, shortly before the Catholic Duke Georg of Saxony died, a religious colloquy was convened in Leipzig to discuss potential reforms within the Duchy. The Electorate of Saxony sent Melanchthon, and Philip of Hesse sent Bucer. The Duchy itself was represented by Georg Witzel, a former Lutheran who had reconverted to Catholicism. In discussions from 2 to 7 January 1539, Bucer and Witzel agreed to defer controversial points of doctrine, but Melanchthon withdrew, feeling that doctrinal unity was a prerequisite of a reform plan. Bucer and Witzel agreed on fifteen articles covering various issues of church life. Bucer, however, made no doctrinal concessions: he remained silent on critical matters such as the mass and the papacy. His ecumenical approach provoked harsh criticism from other reformers.
In the Truce of Frankfurt of 1539, Charles and the leaders of the Schmalkaldic League agreed on a major colloquy to settle all religious issues within the Empire. Bucer placed great hopes on this meeting: he believed it would be possible to convince most German Catholics to accept the doctrine of &quot;sola fide&quot; as the basis for discussions on all other issues. Under various pseudonyms, he published tracts promoting a German national church. A conference in Haguenau began on 12 June 1540, but during a month&#x27;s discussion the two sides failed to agree on a common starting point. They decided to reconvene in Worms. Melanchthon led the Protestants, with Bucer a major influence behind the scenes. When the colloquy again made no progress, the imperial chancellor, Nicholas Perrenot de Granvelle, called for secret negotiations. Bucer then began working with Johannes Gropper, a delegate of the archbishop of Cologne, Hermann von Wied. Aware of the risks of such apparent collusion, he was determined to forge unity among the German churches. The two agreed on twenty-three articles in which Bucer conceded some issues toward the Catholic position. These included justification, the sacraments, and the organisation of the church. Four disputed issues were left undecided: veneration of the saints, private masses, auricular confession, and transubstantiation. The results were published in the &quot;Worms Book&quot;, which they confidentially presented to a prince on each side of the religious divide: Philip of Hesse and Joachim II, Elector of Brandenburg.

The Worms Book laid the groundwork for final negotiations at the Diet of Regensburg in 1541. Charles created a small committee, consisting of Johannes Eck, Gropper, and Julius Pflug on the Catholic side and Melanchthon, Bucer, and Johann Pistorius on the Protestant side. The basis for discussion was the &quot;Regensburg Book&quot;—essentially the Worms Book with modifications by the papal legate, Gasparo Contarini, and other Catholic theologians. The two sides made a promising start, reaching agreement over the issue of justification by faith. But they could not agree on the teaching authority of the Church, the Protestants insisting it was the Bible, the Catholics the &quot;magisterium&quot;—in other words, the pope and his bishops. Into the article on the mass and the Lord&#x27;s Supper, Contarini had inserted the concept of transubstantiation, which was also unacceptable to the Protestants. As a result, the colloquy became deadlocked. To salvage some of the agreements reached, Charles and Granvelle had the Regensburg Book reprinted with additional articles in which the Protestants were allowed to present their views. However, Luther in Wittenberg and the papal court in Rome had by this time seen the book, and they both publicly rejected the article on justification by faith. The failure of the conference was a major setback for Bucer.

After Bucer&#x27;s return from Regensburg, the city of Strasbourg was struck by the plague. First, Bucer&#x27;s friend and colleague Wolfgang Capito succumbed to the disease; then Bucer&#x27;s wife Elisabeth died on 16 November 1541. How many children Elisabeth had borne is unknown; several died during child-birth or at a young age. One son, Nathanael, although mentally and physically handicapped, survived to adulthood and remained with the Bucer family throughout his life. During Elisabeth&#x27;s final hours, she urged Bucer to marry Capito&#x27;s widow, Wibrandis Rosenblatt, after her death. He married Rosenblatt on 16 April 1542, as her fourth husband—she had outlived Ludwig Keller, Johannes Oecolampadius, and Wolfgang Capito. She brought with her four children from her previous marriages. The new couple produced a daughter, whom they named Elisabeth.

==Reform in the Electorate of Cologne (1542–1547)==

On 5 February 1542, Bucer and Gropper met with Hermann von Wied, archbishop-elector of Cologne, to discuss the introduction of church reform in his archdiocese. As one of the seven electors of the Holy Roman Empire, the archbishop of Cologne was a key political figure for both the emperor and the reformers. After consulting the territorial diet, the archbishop enlisted Bucer to lead the reform, and on 14 December Bucer moved to Bonn, the capital of the electorate. His selection caused consternation in the Cologne cathedral chapter, the clerics assisting the archbishop. The hostility of the clergy soon caused a rift between Bucer and Gropper. On 19 December, the chapter lodged a formal protest against Bucer&#x27;s appointment, but von Wied supported his new protégé and Bucer was allowed to stay. He led a small congregation at Bonn cathedral, where he preached three times a week, although his main responsibility was to plan reform.

In January 1543, Bucer began work on a major document for von Wied, . Melanchthon joined him in Bonn in May, and Caspar Hedio a month later, to help draft the document. At the beginning of July, Bucer discussed the draft with the archbishop, who, after studying it, submitted the document to the territorial diet on 23 July. Although the cathedral chapter flatly rejected it, the diet ruled in favour of the reform programme. The final document was over three hundred pages and covered a number of subjects on doctrine, church law, and liturgy. Some of the principles proposed include justification by faith, the acceptance of baptism and the Lord&#x27;s Supper as the only valid sacraments, the offering of the cup to the laity, the holding of worship services in the vernacular, and the authorisation of priests to marry.

These first steps toward reform were halted on 17 August 1543 when Charles V and his troops entered Bonn. The emperor was engaged in a harsh campaign to assert his claim over lands contested by Wilhelm, Duke of Jülich-Cleves-Berg. Bucer was forced to return to Strasbourg shortly afterwards. When the anti-reformist Cologne cathedral chapter and the University of Cologne appealed to both emperor and pope for protection against their archbishop, Charles took their side. Bucer wrote several treatises defending von Wied&#x27;s reformation plan, including a six-hundred-page book, &quot;Beständige Verantwortung&quot; (Steadfast Defence), but he was unable to influence the course of events. Von Wied was excommunicated on 16 April 1546, and he formally surrendered his electoral titles on 25 February 1547. Bucer&#x27;s congregation in Bonn wrote to him in dismay at this disaster. Bucer reassured them that Christians who humble themselves before God eventually receive his protection.

==Rejecting the Augsburg Interim (1547–1549)==
With the onset of the Schmalkaldic War in 1546, Protestants began a gradual retreat within the Empire. On 21 March 1547, Strasbourg surrendered to the imperial army, and the following month the decisive imperial victory at the Battle of Mühlberg ended most Protestant resistance. In Strasbourg, Bucer and his colleagues, including Matthew Zell, Paul Fagius and Johannes Marbach, continued to press the council to bring more discipline and independence to the church. Charles V overruled their efforts at the Diet of Augsburg, which sat from September 1547 to May 1548. The Diet produced an imperial decree, the provisional Augsburg Interim, which imposed Catholic rites and ceremonies throughout the Empire, with a few concessions to the Reformation. To make the document acceptable to the Protestants, Charles needed a leading figure among the reformers to endorse it, and he selected Bucer.

Bucer arrived in Augsburg on 30 March 1548 of his own volition. On 2 April, after he was shown the document, he announced his willingness to ratify it if certain changes were made; but the time for negotiations had passed, and Charles insisted on his signature. When he refused, he was placed under house arrest on 13 April, and shortly afterwards in close confinement. On 20 April, he signed the Interim and was immediately freed.

Despite this capitulation, Bucer continued to fight. On his return to Strasbourg, he stepped up his attacks on Catholic rites and ceremonies, and on 2 July published the , a confessional statement calling on Strasbourg to repent and to defend reformed principles outlined in twenty-nine articles. Charles ordered all copies destroyed. Tension grew in Strasbourg, as Bucer&#x27;s opponents feared he was leading the city to disaster. Many Strasbourg merchants left to avoid a potential clash with imperial forces. On 30 August, the guild officials voted overwhelmingly to begin negotiations to introduce the Interim. Bucer stood firm; even after the city of Konstanz surrendered and accepted the Interim, he called for Strasbourg to reject it unconditionally. In January 1549, with plans underway for the implementation of the Interim in Strasbourg, Bucer and his colleagues continued to attack it, producing a memorandum on how to preserve the Protestant faith under its directives. With no significant support left, Bucer and Fagius were finally relieved of their positions and dismissed on 1 March 1549. Bucer left Strasbourg on 5 April a refugee, as he had arrived twenty-five years earlier.

==Exile in England (1549–1551)==

Bucer received several offers of sanctuary, including Melanchthon&#x27;s from Wittenberg and Calvin&#x27;s from Geneva. He accepted Archbishop Thomas Cranmer&#x27;s invitation to come to England; from his correspondence with several notable Englishmen, he believed that the English Reformation had advanced with some success. On 25 April 1549 Bucer, Fagius, and others arrived in London, where Cranmer received them with full honours. A few days later, Bucer and Fagius were introduced to Edward VI and his court. Bucer&#x27;s wife Wibrandis and his stepdaughter Agnes Capito (daughter of Wolfgang Capito) joined him in September. The following year, Wibrandis arranged for the rest of her children and her elderly mother to come to England.

Bucer took the position of Regius Professor of Divinity at the University of Cambridge. In June he entered a controversy when Peter Martyr Vermigli, another refugee who had taken the equivalent Regius Professor position at Oxford University, debated with Catholic colleagues over the issue of the Lord&#x27;s Supper. Martyr asked Bucer for his support, but Bucer did not totally agree with Martyr&#x27;s position and thought that exposure of differences would not assist the cause of reform. Unwilling to see the eucharist conflict repeat itself in England, he told Martyr he did not take sides, Catholic, Lutheran, or Zwinglian. He said, &quot;We must aspire with the utmost zeal to edify as many people as we possibly can in faith and in the love of Christ—and to offend no one.&quot;

In 1550, another conflict arose when John Hooper, the new bishop of Gloucester, refused to don the traditional vestments for his consecration. The vestments controversy pitted Cranmer, who supported the wearing of clerical garments, against Hooper, Martyr and Jan Laski, the pastor of the Stranger church in London. As it was known that Bucer had reformed the church services in Strasbourg to emulate the simplicity of the early church, Hooper expected Bucer&#x27;s support. However, Bucer tried to stay out of the fray, arguing that there were more important issues to deal with—lack of pastors and pastoral care, the need for catechismal instruction, and the implementation of church discipline. Hooper refused to be swayed, and was imprisoned in the Tower of London until he accepted Cranmer&#x27;s demand.
Bucer had ambitious goals in diffusing the Reformation throughout England. He was disappointed, therefore, when those in power failed to consult him in bringing about change. On learning about the custom of presenting a memorandum to the king every new year, he worked on a major treatise which he gave as a draft to his friend John Cheke on 21 October 1550. The was the culmination of Bucer&#x27;s many years of experience, a summary of his thought and theology that he described as his legacy. In it he urged Edward VI to take control of the English Reformation, and proposed that Parliament introduce fourteen laws of reform, covering both ecclesiastical and civil matters. In his view the Reformation was not only concerned with the church, but in all areas of life. Noting the difficult social conditions in England, he promoted the role of deacons to care for the poor and needy. He described marriage as a social contract rather than a sacrament, hence he permitted divorce, a modern idea that was considered too advanced for its time. He advocated the restructuring of economic and administrative systems with suggestions for improving industry, agriculture, and education. His ideal society was distinctively authoritarian, with a strong emphasis on Christian discipline. The &quot;De Regno Christi&quot; was never to be the charter of the English Reformation that Bucer intended: it was finally printed not in England but in Basel, in 1557.

Bucer&#x27;s last major contribution to the English Reformation was a treatise on the original 1549 edition of the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;. Cranmer had requested his opinion on how the book should be revised, and Bucer submitted his response on 5 January 1551. He called for the simplification of the liturgy, noting non-essential elements: certain holidays in the liturgical calendar, actions of piety such as genuflections, and ceremonies such as private masses. He focused on the congregation and how the people would worship and be taught. How far Bucer&#x27;s critique influenced the 1552 second edition of the Prayer Book is unknown. Scholars agree that although Bucer&#x27;s impact on the Church of England should not be overestimated, he exercised his greatest influence on the revision of the Prayer Book.

==Death and legacy==

Bucer&#x27;s time in England was dogged by illnesses, including rheumatism, coughs, and intestinal ailments. Symptoms such as vomiting, shivering, and sweating suggest severe tuberculosis. In February 1551, his health finally broke down, and on the 22nd he dictated an addition to his will. He named Walter Haddon and Matthew Parker as executors, commended his loved ones to Thomas Cranmer, and thanked his stepdaughter Agnes Capito for taking care of him. On 28 February, after encouraging those near him to do all they could to realise his vision as expressed in &quot;De Regno Christi&quot;, he died at the age of 59. He was buried in the church of Great St Mary&#x27;s in Cambridge before a large crowd of university professors and students.

In a letter to Peter Martyr, John Cheke wrote a fitting eulogy:
Bucer left his wife Wibrandis a significant inheritance consisting mainly of the household and his large collection of books. She eventually returned to Basel, where she died on 1 November 1564 at the age of 60.

When Mary I came to the throne, she had Bucer and Fagius tried posthumously for heresy as part of her efforts to restore Catholicism in England. Their caskets were disinterred and their remains burned, along with copies of their books. On 22 July 1560, Elizabeth I formally rehabilitated both reformers. A brass plaque on the floor of Great St Mary&#x27;s marks the original location of Bucer&#x27;s grave.

After Bucer&#x27;s death, his writings continued to be translated, reprinted, and disseminated throughout Europe. No &quot;Buceran&quot; denomination, however, emerged from his ministry, probably because he never developed a systematic theology as Melanchthon had for the Lutheran church and Calvin for the Reformed churches. Several groups, including Anglicans, Puritans, Lutherans, and Calvinists, claimed him as one of their own. The adaptability of his theology to each confessional point-of-view also led polemicists to criticise it as too accommodating. His theology could be best summarised as being practical and pastoral rather than theoretical. Bucer was not so concerned about staking a doctrinal claim &quot;per se&quot;, but rather he took a standpoint in order to discuss and to win over his opponents. At the same time his theological stand was grounded in the conditions of his time where he envisioned the ideal society to be one that was led by an enlightened, God-centred government with all the people united under Christian fellowship. Martin Bucer is chiefly remembered for his promotion of doctrinal unity, or ecumenism, and his lifelong struggle to create an inclusive church.

<text>William Warham ( – 22 August 1532) was the Archbishop of Canterbury from 1503 to his death in 1532.

==Early life and education==
Warham was the son of Robert Warham of Malshanger in Hampshire. He was educated at Winchester College and New College, Oxford.

==Legal career==
After graduating, Warham practised and taught law both in London and Oxford. His father was a tenant farmer, but his brother, Sir Hugh Warham, acquired an estate at Croydon, which passed to his daughter Agnes, who married Sir Anthony St Leger.

==Bishopric==
Later, Warham took holy orders, held two livings (Barley and Cottenham) and became Master of the Rolls in 1494. Henry VII found him a useful and clever diplomatist. He helped to arrange the marriage between Henry&#x27;s son, Arthur, Prince of Wales, and Catherine of Aragon. He went to Scotland with Richard Foxe, then bishop of Durham, in 1497. He was partly responsible for several commercial and other treaties with Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor, also Count of Flanders and Regent Duke of Burgundy, on behalf of his son Philip IV of Burgundy.

==Archbishopric==
In 1502, he was consecrated Bishop of London and became Keeper of the Great Seal, but his tenure of both offices was short, as in 1504, he became Lord Chancellor and Archbishop of Canterbury. In 1506, he became Chancellor of Oxford University, a role he held until his death. In 1509, he presided over the wedding of and then crowned Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon.

On 28 September 1511, he made a visit to the hospital at Maison Dieu, Faversham.

As archbishop, Warham seems to have been somewhat arbitrary; for example, his actions led to a serious quarrel with Foxe, then Bishop of Winchester, and others in 1512. That made him gradually withdraw into the background after the coronation. He resigned the office of Lord Chancellor in 1515 and was succeeded by Thomas Wolsey, whom he had consecrated as bishop of Lincoln in the previous year. His resignation was possibly because of his dislike of Henry&#x27;s foreign policy.

Warham was present at the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520 and assisted Wolsey as assessor during the secret inquiry into the validity of Henry&#x27;s marriage with Catherine in 1527. Throughout the divorce proceedings, Warham&#x27;s position was essentially that of an old and weary man. He was named as one of the counsellors to assist the queen, but, fearing to incur the king&#x27;s displeasure and using his favourite phrase &quot;ira principis mors est&quot; (&quot;the king&#x27;s anger is death&quot;), he gave her very little help and signed the letter to Pope Clement VII that urged the pope to assent to Henry&#x27;s wish. Later, it was proposed that the archbishop himself should try the case, but the suggestion came to nothing.

Warham presided over the Convocation of 1531, when the clergy of the Province of Canterbury voted £100,000 to the king to avoid the penalties of praemunire and accepted Henry as supreme head of the church with the face-saving clause &quot;so far as the Law of Christ allows&quot;.

In Warham&#x27;s concluding years, however, the archbishop showed rather more independence. In February 1532, he protested against all acts concerning the church passed by the parliament that met in 1529, but that did not prevent the important proceedings which secured the complete submission of the church to the state later in the same year. Against this further compliance with Henry&#x27;s wishes, Warham drew up a protest in which he likened the action of Henry VIII to that of Henry II and urged Magna Carta in defence of the liberties of the church. He attempted in vain to strike a compromise during the Submission of the Clergy.

==Death and legacy==
Having been munificent in his public and moderate in his private life, he died on a visit to his nephew, also William Warham. He was buried in the Martyrdom (north) transept of Canterbury Cathedral. He was succeeded as archbishop by his rival, Thomas Cranmer. Warham Guild was named after him.

<text>Robin Ray (17 September 1934 – 29 November 1998) was an English broadcaster on radio and television, actor of stage and screen, and musician. The eldest son of the comedian Ted Ray, he was educated at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and was the school&#x27;s chief technical instructor from 1961 to 1965. 

Ray was the first chairman of the BBC Television panel programme &quot;Call My Bluff&quot; in the 1960s and regularly appeared on the BBC 2 evening quiz show &quot;Face the Music&quot; in the 1970s. He was the author of plays and books and was the music adviser to Classic FM Radio between 1988 and 1997 and artistic director for Performance Channel TV from 1996 to 1997.

==Early life==
Born Robin Olden in Fulham, London on 17 September 1934, he was the eldest son of Charles Olden, later known as the comedian Ted Ray, and the dancer Dorothy Sybil Stevens. His younger brother, Andrew, also became an actor. At age 10, Ray received records of Franz Schubert&#x27;s Unfinished Symphony and Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s Piano Sonata No. 14 from his father and briefly harboured aspirations of becoming a classical conductor. 

From the age of 15, he also wanted to become a concert pianist after an unsuccessful venture with the violin until he realised his lack of skill. Ray was taught at Highgate School in North London and decided to enrol at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) after his brother began working as an actor. He did his national service in the Royal Army Service Corps and rose to the rank of second lieutenant.

==Career==
Ray performed one stand-up comedy routine at a West End club at the age of 21 but was unsuccessful. In January 1956, Ray made his television debut as the youngest member of a gang in the ITV crime play &quot;The Guv&#x27;nor&quot;, and performed in a Bob and Alf Pearson summer show in Bournemouth. He first appeared as a professional actor in a West End production of &quot;The Changeling&quot; at the Royal Court Theatre in 1960, just after graduating from RADA with a diploma in acting. Ray was understudy to Dudley Moore in &quot;Beyond the Fringe,&quot; replacing Moore when the original cast went to the United States&quot;.&quot; He played small roles in the films &quot;I&#x27;m All Right Jack&quot; (1959) as a Young Chemist, a doctor in &quot;Doctor in Love&quot; (1960), a Flag Lieutenant in &quot;Watch Your Stern&quot; (1960), a seaman in &quot;Sink the Bismarck!&quot; (1960), an assistant manager in &quot;Carry On Constable&quot; (1960) and a TV floor manager in &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; (1964). 

Ray was the chief technical instructor at RADA from 1961 until his resignation in 1965, in support of the resignation of the principal John Fernald due to internal politics at the school. The decision allowed Ray to return to broadcasting, and he was broadcaster of writer of more than 1,000 programmes for the BBC and commercial radio and television between 1966 and 1995. He went on to serve as associate director of the Meadow Brook Theater in Detroit, United States from 1965 to 1966. Ray was a cast member of the 1963 BBC Television series &quot;Dig This Rhubarb&quot;. Two years later, he was selected to be the first chairman of the new BBC panel show &quot;Call My Bluff&quot;, and created the programme &quot;The Daring Young Men on the Black and White Keys&quot; on virtuoso pianists the following year. 

Ray acted as the compere of the 1968 Associated-Rediffusion series &quot;Where Did That Come From?&quot; in which contestants were required to make a derivation of quotes or words. He was the presenter of the 1968 television film &quot;Crazy World, Crazy People&quot;. He was the host of one series of the BBC 2 programme &quot;Music Now&quot; from 1969 to 1970. He was a regular panel member on the BBC 2 evening music quiz, &quot;Face the Music&quot;, which began in 1972. On radio, Ray presented &quot;Sounds Funny&quot; in 1972 in which celebrities spoke about things that amused them as well as &quot;The Year in Question&quot; in 1973. From 1979 to 1981, he was the presenter of the BBC Radio 4 series &quot;A Touch of Genius&quot; in which he reviewed notable musicians around the world. 

He presented quiz shows such as &quot;The Movie Quiz&quot; from 1972 to 1974 (he spent the final series as a team captain after deciding to give the presenting duties to Michael Aspel), and &quot;Film Buff of the Year&quot; about films from the silent era to the present day, which ran from 1982 to 1986. From 1976 to 1978, Ray was the compere of the Saturday night BBC 2 arts documentary series &quot;The Lively Arts&quot; about composers, musicians, performers and writers. He was the presenter of the BBC 2 television series &quot;Robin Ray&#x27;s Picture Gallery&quot; in 1979, comparing the treatment of various figures by the film industry with biographical information. Between 1980 and 1982, Ray was chairman of the Granada history quiz show &quot;Cabbages and Kings&quot;.

The children&#x27;s television programme &quot;Sounds Exciting&quot;, broadcast in 1968, was a musical education series culminating in a final &quot;whodunit&quot; called &quot;Dead in Tune&quot;, with Ray&#x27;s original story set to the music of Herbert Chappell performed by a chamber group of players from the Leicestershire Schools Symphony Orchestra (LSSO). Two years later, Argo recorded the piece using an ensemble of 47 LSSO players conducted by Chappell. This LP also included a new commission, &quot;George and the Dragonfly&quot;, with John Kershaw&#x27;s words set to the music of Chappell and narrated by Ray, John Kershaw and Susan Stranks (Ray&#x27;s wife).

From 1974 he presented a programme called &quot;Robin Ray&#x27;s Record Review&quot; on Capital Radio in London. Ray had a role in the 1977 production of the musical Side by Side by Sondheim at the Garrick Theatre and presented &quot;Tomfoolery&quot; based on the songs of Tom Lehrer at the Criterion Theatre in London in 1980. At the age of 45, he wrote the musical &quot;Cafe Puccini&quot; based on the life of the opera composer Giacomo Puccini with Andrew Lloyd Webber, which opened at the Wyndham&#x27;s Theatre in 1986 with musical director William Blezard. Ray was the author of several books. This included the anthology &quot;Time for Lovers&quot; (1975), &quot;Robin Ray&#x27;s Music Quiz&quot; (1978), &quot;Favourite Hymns and Carols&quot; (1982), &quot;Words on Music&quot; (1984), and was a consultant editor of &quot;Classic FM Music Guide to Classical Music&quot; (1996). 

He was a panellist for the Booker Prize in 1977, and was the drama critic for &quot;Punch&quot; magazine between 1986 and 1987. Ray co-wrote and narrated the songs of the &quot;Let&#x27;s Do It&quot; show that was complied by David Kernan from the music of Noël Coward and Cole Porter at the Chichester Festival in 1994. He was the artistic director of Performance Channel TV between 1996 and 1997 and was a consultant for Nimbus Records in 1998. He was employed as a music adviser to Classic FM Radio from 1988 until his resignation in 1997. He drew up a list of 50,000 pieces of classical music and rated them for popular appeal, which was the basis for the Classic FM playlist. This list proved to be extremely attractive to similar popular classical music radio stations in other countries, and there was a legal dispute between Ray and Classic FM, which Ray won in 1998, as to who was entitled to the copyright in the playlist and ratings.

==Personal life and death==
He became engaged to the actress and children&#x27;s television presenter Susan Stranks in August 1958 and they married at St. Gabriel&#x27;s Church in Warwick Street, Westminster on 25 January 1960. Early in their careers they decided they did not want to have children but later they changed their minds and had a son Rupert when Ray was 44. Ray died of lung cancer in Hove, Sussex on 29 November 1998. He was cremated privately on 3 December.

<doc id="153648" wikidata="Q1968450" url="?curid=153648" title="Thomas Bourchier (cardinal)">
<text>Thomas Bourchier (140430 March 1486) was a medieval English cardinal, Archbishop of Canterbury, and Lord Chancellor of England.

==Origins==
Bourchier was a younger son of William Bourchier, 1st Count of Eu (died 1420) by his wife Anne of Gloucester, a daughter of Thomas of Woodstock (1355–1397), youngest son of King Edward III. One of his brothers was Henry Bourchier, 1st Earl of Essex (died 1483), and his great-nephew was John Bourchier, 2nd Baron Berners, the translator of Froissart. Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham was his half-brother.

He was educated at the University of Oxford, after which he entered the church and obtained rapid promotion.

==Career==
After holding some minor appointments he was consecrated Bishop of Worcester on 15 May 1434. In the same year of 1434 he was Chancellor of the University of Oxford, and in 1443 was appointed Bishop of Ely. In April 1454 he was made Archbishop of Canterbury, and became Lord Chancellor of England in March 1455.

Bourchier&#x27;s short term of office as chancellor coincided with the start of the Wars of the Roses, and at first he was not a strong partisan, although he lost his position as chancellor when Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York, was deprived of power in October 1456. In 1458 he helped to reconcile the contending parties as part of The Love Day, but when the war was renewed in 1459 he had become a decided Yorkist. He crowned Duke Richard&#x27;s son Edward Plantagenet, 4th Duke of York as King Edward IV in June 1461, and four years later he crowned Edward&#x27;s queen, Elizabeth Woodville.

In 1457 Bourchier took the chief part in the trial for heresy of Reginald Pecock, Bishop of Chichester. In 1473 he was created a cardinal, not after some delay as this honour had been sought for him by King Edward IV in 1465. In 1475 he was one of the four arbitrators appointed to arrange the details of the Treaty of Picquigny between England and France. After the death of King Edward IV in 1483 Bourchier persuaded the queen to allow her younger son, Richard of Shrewsbury, 1st Duke of York, to join his elder brother King Edward V in (supposedly protective) residence in the Tower of London. Although Bourchier had sworn, before his father&#x27;s death, to be faithful to King Edward V, he nevertheless crowned King Richard III in July 1483.

The third English king crowned by Bourchier was King Henry VII (1485–1509), whom he also married to Elizabeth of York in January 1486.

==Death and burial==
Bourchier died on 30 March 1486 at the palatial residence he had transformed, Knole House, near Sevenoaks in Kent, and was buried in Canterbury Cathedral, where his monument can be found.

<text>The River Fowey ( ; ) is a river in Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. Its source is at Fowey Well (originally , meaning &quot;spring of the river Fowey&quot;) about north-west of Brown Willy on Bodmin Moor, not far from one of its tributaries rising at Dozmary Pool and Colliford Lake, passes Lanhydrock House, Restormel Castle and Lostwithiel, then broadens below Milltown before joining the English Channel at Fowey. The estuary is called Uzell (, meaning &quot;howling place&quot;). It is only navigable by larger craft for the last . From Fowey, there is a passenger ferry to Polruan and a car ferry to Bodinnick. The first road crossing going upstream is in Lostwithiel. The river has seven tributaries, the largest being the River Lerryn. The section of the Fowey Valley between Doublebois and Bodmin Parkway railway station is known as the Glynn Valley (, meaning &quot;deep wooded valley&quot;). The valley is the route of both the A38 trunk road and the railway line (built by the Cornwall Railway in 1859). The railway line is carried on eight stone viaducts along this stretch.

==History==
Donyarth (), or Dungarth (died 875), was the last-recorded king of Cornwall. He is thought to be the &#x27;Doniert&#x27; recorded on an inscription on King Doniert&#x27;s Stone, a ninth-century cross shaft which stands in St Cleer parish in Cornwall, although he is not given any title in the inscription.
According to the &quot;&quot;, he drowned in 875. His death may have been an accident, but it was recorded in Ireland as a punishment for collaboration with the Vikings, who were harrying the West Saxons and briefly occupied Exeter in 876 before being driven out by Alfred the Great. Philip Payton states that one must imagine that he drowned in the River Fowey, near King Doniert&#x27;s Stone.

The Polbrock Canal, approved by Parliament in the 1790s but never built, would have provided a link between the north and south coasts of Cornwall by joining the River Camel with the Fowey at Bodmin.

==Geology and hydrology==
The upper reaches of the Fowey are mainly moorland giving way to woodland and farmland, predominantly livestock. This means that 63.6% of the catchment is grassland, with a further 18.3% woodland and 10.7% arable land. Of the remaining 7.5%, 2.6% is urban or built-up areas, 2.5% is mountain, heath and bog and the remainder is inland waters.

The catchment area of the River Fowey covers a total of consisting of granite (in part kaolinised) on Bodmin Moor, Devonian slates and grits, and peat and valley gravels. Data collected by the National River Flow Archive shows that average flow at the Restormel monitoring station is and is affected by the reservoirs at Colliford and Sibleyback and by abstraction of water for public supply.

==Wildlife and conservation==


The river runs through two Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), one of which is also part of a national nature reserve (NNR). The Upper Fowey SSSI is a floodplain on the southern slopes of Bodmin Moor and is designated for its wet heath vegetation and herbaceous valley-floor mire communities. Downstream at Golitha Falls, part of the woodland is designated a NNR and is within the Draynes Wood SSSI. At this point the river runs through a gorge and is of particular importance for ″lower plants″ such as liverworts, mosses and lichens. Golitha (pronounced &quot;Goleetha&quot;) is derived from the Cornish word for &quot;obstruction&quot;. There is a riverside walk, from the visitor car park. Golitha Falls is the site of Wheal Victoria copper mine.

== Recreation ==
The upper part of the Fowey valley is within the Bodmin Moor area of the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty so many hikers, holidaymakers and tourists visit the places of interest. The river has very pleasant sites and special paths made for hiking and walking along the banks and in the countryside surrounding the towns; most of Bodmin Moor is designated as &#x27;open access&#x27; under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000.

The River Fowey is famous for its sailing because of its natural harbour. In the past it has been visited by up to 7,000 yachts in one season. Almost all sections of the river have been paddled by kayakers and canoeists: from the whitewater sections high up on the moor, all the way down to the estuary. Fowey has an excellent local chandlery.

Many fish can be caught in the River Fowey so many fishermen come to enjoy the excellent fishing conditions.

== Ferry services ==
Fowey to Polruan passenger and cycle ferry – runs year round.

Fowey to Bodinnick Ferry – there has been a ferry crossing the narrows between Fowey and Bodinnick since at least the 14th century. Today there is a vehicle ferry that runs year round between Bodinnick slipway and Caffa Mill slipway in Fowey.

The Fowey to Mevagissey Passenger Ferry – a timetabled summer service leaving Whitehouse Slip. Journey time is around 40 minutes. It provides an alternative route to the Lost Gardens of Heligan, finishing the journey on foot or by taxi.

<text>InterNIC, known as the Network Information Center (NIC) until 1993, was the organization primarily responsible for Domain Name System (DNS) domain name allocations and X.500 directory services. From its inception in 1972 until October 1, 1991, it was run by the Stanford Research Institute, now known as SRI International, and led by Jake Feinler. From October 1991 until September 18, 1998, it was run by Network Solutions. Thereafter, the responsibility was assumed by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).

It was accessed through the domain name internic.net, with email, FTP and World Wide Web services run at various times by SRI, Network Solutions, Inc., and AT&amp;T. This website is still active today, operated by ICANN, and currently provides reference documents and information related to domain registration. The InterNIC also coordinated the IP address space, including performing IP address management for North America prior to the formation of ARIN. InterNIC is a registered service mark of the U.S. Department of Commerce. The use of the term is licensed to the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).

==SRI==
The first central authority to coordinate the operation of the network was the Network Information Center (NIC). The NIC was based in Doug Engelbart&#x27;s lab, the Augmentation Research Center, at the Stanford Research Institute (now SRI International) in Menlo Park, California.

In 1972, Elizabeth J. Feinler, better known as Jake, became principal investigator of the project.
The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) assigned the numbers, while the NIC published them to the rest of the network. Jon Postel fulfilled the role of manager of IANA, in addition to his role as the RFC Editor, until his death in 1998.

The NIC provided reference service to users (initially over the phone and by physical mail), maintained and published a directory of people (the &quot;white pages&quot;), a resource handbook (the &quot;yellow pages&quot;, a list of services) and the protocol handbook. After the Network Operations Center at Bolt, Bernek and Newman brought new hosts onto the network, the NIC registered names, provided access control for terminals, audit trail and billing information, and distributed Request for Comments (RFCs). Feinler, working with Steve Crocker, Jon Postel, Joyce Reynolds and other members of the Network Working Group (NWG), developed RFCs into the official set of technical notes for the ARPANET and later the Internet. The NIC provided the first links to online documents using the NLS Journal system developed at SRI&#x27;s Augmentation Research Center.

On the ARPANET, hosts were given names to be used in place of numeric addresses. Owners of new hosts sent email to to request an address. A file named was distributed by the NIC and manually installed on each host on the network to provide a mapping between these names and their corresponding network address. As the network grew, this became increasingly cumbersome. A technical solution came in the form of the Domain Name System, designed by Paul Mockapetris.

The Defense Data Network Network Information Center (DDN-NIC) at SRI handled all registration services, including the top-level domains , , , , , and . DDN-NIC also performed root nameserver administration and Internet number assignments under a United States Department of Defense contract starting in 1984.

==Network Solutions==
In 1990, the Internet Activities Board proposed changes to the centralized NIC/IANA arrangement. The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) awarded the administration and maintenance of DDN-NIC, which had been managed by SRI since 1972, to Government Systems, Inc (GSI), which subcontracted it to the small private-sector firm Network Solutions.

On October 1, 1991, the NIC services were moved from a DECSYSTEM-20 machine at SRI to a Sun Microsystems SPARCserver running SunOS 4.1 at GSI in Chantilly, Virginia.

By the 1990s, most of the growth of the Internet was in the non-defense sector, and even outside the United States. Therefore, the US Department of Defense would no longer fund registration services outside of the domain.

The National Science Foundation started a competitive bidding process in 1992; subsequently, in 1993, NSF created the Internet Network Information Center, known as InterNIC, to extend and coordinate directory and database services and information services for the NSFNET; and provide registration services for non-military Internet participants. NSF awarded the contract to manage InterNIC to three organizations; Network Solutions provided registration services, AT&amp;T provided directory and database services, and General Atomics provided information services. General Atomics was disqualified from the contract in December 1994 after a review found their services not conforming to the standards of its contract. General Atomics&#x27; InterNIC functions were assumed by AT&amp;T.

===Inappropriate domain names===

Beginning in 1996, Network Solutions rejected domain names containing English language words on a &quot;restricted list&quot; through an automated filter. Applicants whose domain names were rejected received an email containing the notice: &quot;Network Solutions has a right founded in the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution to refuse to register, and thereby publish, on the Internet registry of domain names words that it deems to be inappropriate.&quot; Domain names such as &quot;shitakemushrooms.com&quot; would be rejected, but the domain name &quot;shit.com&quot; was active since it had been registered before 1996.

Network Solutions eventually allowed domain names containing the words on a case-by-case basis, after manually reviewing the names for obscene intent. This profanity filter was never enforced by the government and its use was not continued by ICANN when it took over governance of the distribution of domain names to the public.

==Transfer to ARIN and ICANN==
The InterNIC project included Internet IP number assignment, ASN assignment, and reverse DNS zone (in-addr.arpa) management tasks until December 1997 when the American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN) came into operation. At that time, responsibility for these tasks was transferred by the National Science Foundation from the InterNIC project to ARIN via modification of the cooperative agreement with Network Solutions.

The InterNIC Directory and Database services provided by AT&amp;T were discontinued on March 31, 1998, after their cooperative agreement with NSF expired.

In 1998, both IANA and InterNIC project were reorganized under the control of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), a California non-profit corporation contracted by the US Department of Commerce to manage a number of Internet-related tasks. The role of operating the DNS was privatized, and opened up to competition, while the central management of name allocations would be awarded on a contract tender basis. In July 2010, the IAB and Number Resource Organization agreed that ICANN should perform the in-addr.arpa zone technical management tasks, and this transition to ICANN was completed in February 2011.

==In popular culture==
In a database of InterNIC is featured. It can also be hacked in-game and it ironically has no security.

<doc id="153652" wikidata="Q924163" url="?curid=153652" title="Simon Sudbury">
<text>Simon Sudbury ( – 14 June 1381) was Bishop of London from 1361 to 1375, Archbishop of Canterbury from 1375 until his death, and in the last year of his life Lord Chancellor of England. He met a violent death during the Peasants&#x27; Revolt in 1381.

==Life==

The son of Nigel Theobald, Simon of Sudbury (as he later became known) was born at Sudbury in Suffolk, studied at the University of Paris, and became one of the chaplains of Pope Innocent VI, one of the Avignon popes, who in 1356 sent him on a mission to Edward III of England.

In 1361 Sudbury was made Chancellor of Salisbury and in October that year the pope provided him to be Bishop of London, Sudbury&#x27;s consecration occurring on 20 March 1362. He was soon serving Edward III as an ambassador and in other ways. On 4 May 1375 he succeeded William Whittlesey as archbishop of Canterbury, and during the rest of his life was a partisan of John of Gaunt.

In July 1377, following the death of Edward III in June, Simon of Sudbury crowned the new king, Richard II, at Westminster Abbey, and in 1378 John Wycliffe appeared before him at Lambeth, but Sudbury only undertook proceedings against him under great pressure.

In January 1380, Sudbury became Lord Chancellor of England, and the insurgent peasants regarded him as one of the principal authors of their woes. Having released John Ball from his prison at Maidstone, the Kentish insurgents attacked and damaged the archbishop&#x27;s property at Canterbury and Lambeth; then, rushing into the Tower of London, they seized the archbishop himself. So unpopular was Sudbury with the rebellious peasants that guards simply allowed the rebels through the gates, the reason being his role in introducing the third poll tax.

===Death===

Sudbury, who was saying Mass in St John&#x27;s Chapel, was dragged to Tower Hill together with Sir Robert Hales, the Lord High Treasurer. According to an account written by John Stow two centuries later, Sudbury was beheaded by eight frenzied sword blows to his neck, one of which also took off the fingers from one hand. His body lay in the open all day, but his severed head had his clerical hood nailed onto it and was fixed to a pole, then placed on London Bridge. His body was afterwards taken to Canterbury Cathedral, though his head was taken down after six days by William Walworth, the Lord Mayor of London, and was taken to Sudbury, where it is still kept at St Gregory&#x27;s Church, which Sudbury had partly rebuilt. With his brother, John of Chertsey, he also founded a college in Sudbury; he also did some building at Canterbury. His father was Nigel Theobald, sometimes called Simon Theobald or Tybald, who is also buried at St Gregory&#x27;s, with his wife Sara.

In March 2011 a CT scan of Sudbury&#x27;s mummified skull was performed at the West Suffolk Hospital to make a facial reconstruction, which was completed in September 2011 by forensics expert Adrienne Barker at the University of Dundee.
Sudbury&#x27;s tomb in Canterbury Cathedral contains his corpse with a lead cannonball in place of the missing head. The stone sarcophagus lacks the original gilt copper effigy, which was destroyed during the English Reformation, but the elaborately-carved stone canopy survives. By ancient tradition, the mayor of Canterbury places a wreath of red roses on the tomb at an annual civic service on Christmas Day, in recognition of Sudbury&#x27;s good works for the city.

==Arms==

Sudbury&#x27;s coat of arms was &quot;a talbot hound sejeant within a bordure engrailed&quot;, as is visible sculpted in stone on a wall in the nave of Canterbury Cathedral. The town of Sudbury uses &quot;a talbot hound sejeant&quot; in its arms in allusion to him.

<doc id="153653" wikidata="Q239023" url="?curid=153653" title="River Frome, Dorset">
<text>The River Frome is a river in Dorset in the south of England. At 30 miles (48 km) long it is the major chalkstream in southwest England. It is navigable upstream from Poole Harbour as far as the town of Wareham.

==Geography==
The river rises in the Dorset Downs at Evershot, passes through Cattistock, Maiden Newton, Dorchester, West Stafford and Woodsford. At Wareham it and the parallel River Piddle flow into Poole Harbour via the Wareham Channel. The catchment area is , approximately one sixth of the county. 

East of Dorchester the river runs over sands, clays and gravels which overlie the chalk; as the valley gradient is gentle the Frome has deposited much sediment here and thus created a broad floodplain. Historically this contained marshes and gave the name to the Durotriges, &quot;water dwellers&quot;, the Brittonic Celtic tribe who inhabited Dorset. The river forms a wide, shallow ria at its estuary, Poole Harbour.

Prior to the end of the last ice age, the Purbeck Hills were continuous with the Isle of Wight, and the Frome would have continued eastwards through what is now Poole Harbour and Poole Bay along the Solent, collecting the Stour–Avon, Beaulieu, and Test–Itchen–Hamble catchments, before emptying into the Channel between Bembridge and Selsey Bill.

==Human history==
At the end of the 1st century AD, the Romans built a aqueduct to supply public fountains and public baths at their new town of Durnovaria (Dorchester). Taking the form of a channel about 1.0 m wide and 0.35 m deep cut into the underlying chalk on an artificial terrace, lined and overlain with timber, the aqueduct took water from the Frome upstream at Nunnery Mead, near Notton (between modern-day Maiden Newton and Frampton) and closely followed the contours of the valley side to the southwest of the river. Over its course the aqueduct only fell , some less than the river itself. It has been calculated that water would have reached Durnovaria at the rate of 8 million gallons per day. Some traces of the aqueduct terrace can still be seen at Bradford Peverell and on the Dorchester by-pass.
The Danes made frequent raids up the river. The town walls at Wareham were built in 876, possibly by Alfred the Great, to defend the town against this threat.

Until the late 19th century the river was an important part of the trade route for the export of Purbeck Ball Clay from the Isle of Purbeck. Originally the clay was brought to wharves at Wareham by pack horse from the clay pits to the south. In around 1830 the Furzebrook Railway was built, connecting the pits to a wharf at Ridge. This route was eventually superseded by the use of the main line rail network, and eventually by road.

==Ecology==
The Frome has suffered a dramatic decline in the run of salmon in recent years. In 1988 over 4000 fish ran the river; by 2004 the run had fallen to 750 fish, and in 2023 to an estimated 443. The Game &amp; Wildlife Conservation Trust is carrying out research at its Salmon &amp; Trout Research Centre at East Stoke into the decline of Atlantic Salmon to understand the causes and how to reverse the decline.

<doc id="153654" wikidata="Q267065" url="?curid=153654" title="Theobald of Bec">
<text>Theobald of Bec ( 1090 – 18 April 1161) was a Norman archbishop of Canterbury from 1139 to 1161. His exact birth date is unknown. Some time in the late 11th or early 12th century Theobald became a monk at the Abbey of Bec, rising to the position of abbot in 1137. King Stephen of England chose him to be Archbishop of Canterbury in 1138. Canterbury&#x27;s claim to primacy over the Welsh ecclesiastics was resolved during Theobald&#x27;s term of office when Pope Eugene III decided in 1148 in Canterbury&#x27;s favour. Theobald faced challenges to his authority from a subordinate bishop, Henry of Blois, Bishop of Winchester and King Stephen&#x27;s younger brother, and his relationship with King Stephen was turbulent. On one occasion Stephen forbade him from attending a papal council, but Theobald defied the king, which resulted in the confiscation of his property and temporary exile. Theobald&#x27;s relations with his cathedral clergy and the monastic houses in his archdiocese were also difficult.

Serving during the disorders of Stephen&#x27;s reign, Theobald succeeded in forcing peace on the king by refusing to consecrate Stephen&#x27;s son and heir, Eustace. After Eustace&#x27;s death in 1153, Stephen recognised his rival Henry of Anjou as his heir, and later Theobald was named regent of the kingdom after Stephen&#x27;s death. After a long illness, Theobald died in 1161, following which unsuccessful efforts were made to have him canonised as a saint.

Theobald was the patron of his successor Thomas Becket, and a number of other future bishops and archbishops served as his clerks. During his time as archbishop Theobald augmented the rights of his see, or bishopric. Historians of his time and later were divided on his character and he is often overlooked in the historical record, mainly because of the fame of his successor.

==Early life==

===Family and background===

Theobald&#x27;s family was from the area around Thierville near Le Bec-Hellouin, in the Risle River valley. The modern historian Frank Barlow speculates that Theobald may have been a distant relative of his successor as archbishop, Thomas Becket, as Becket&#x27;s family came from the same part of Normandy. The exact date of Theobald&#x27;s birth is unknown; the only clue to his age is that when he died in 1161 contemporaries considered him an old man, suggesting a birth date of perhaps around 1090 to one modern historian. His father was supposedly a knight, but no contemporary reference gives his name. His brother Walter also became a priest, and later a bishop.

Theobald entered the Abbey of Bec in Normandy as a Benedictine monk in the late 11th or early 12th century, while William was the third abbot. But as William was abbot from 1096 to 1124, that leaves a wide range of possible entry dates. Theobald was the 266th monk admitted under William, out of 346. The historian Avrom Saltman suggests that, if admissions were spaced regularly throughout William&#x27;s abbacy, Theobald would have become a monk in about 1117, but qualifies his estimate with the statement that 1117 &quot;seems to be rather late&quot;.

===Life at Bec===

In 1127 Theobald was made prior of Bec, after Boso succeeded William as abbot. Theobald became abbot in 1137, following Boso&#x27;s death in June 1136. The monks of Bec unanimously elected him to be their new abbot without first consulting the Archbishop of Rouen, Hugh de Boves, who consequently threatened to void the result. Audoen, the Bishop of Evreux, and brother of Thurstan, the Archbishop of York, intervened with Hugh and persuaded him to ratify the election. Another problem then arose when Hugh demanded a written profession of obedience from Theobald, which Theobald refused to provide; no previous abbot had made such a profession. Theobald resisted for 14 months before a compromise was reached through the intercession of Peter the Venerable, Abbot of Cluny, allowing Theobald to give a verbal profession to Hugh.

No documents survive from Theobald&#x27;s tenure as abbot, nor is there any information on the administration of the monastery during his period of office, except that 47 monks were admitted to Bec while he was abbot. Theobald travelled to England on business for his abbey at least once during his abbacy, to supervise the monastery&#x27;s lands in England, a trip that took place shortly before his selection as the new Archbishop of Canterbury in 1138.

===Appointment to Canterbury===

In 1138 King Stephen chose Theobald to fill the vacant archbishopric of Canterbury over Stephen&#x27;s own brother Henry, the Bishop of Winchester, who had helped Stephen gain the throne of England. Stephen feared that Henry would be too powerful as archbishop, and would attempt to control the king. The election took place on 24 December; Stephen was present with the papal legate, Alberic of Ostia, and a small group of barons and bishops, but Henry was absent overseeing the ordination of deacons. Most historians consider that Stephen arranged the election&#x27;s timing to ensure Henry&#x27;s absence. Henry believed that Theobald had been elected not only because of Stephen&#x27;s concerns but also because Waleran of Meulan, the lay patron of Bec, was attempting to put his own man in one of the most powerful positions in England. Waleran and his twin brother Robert, Earl of Leicester, were Henry&#x27;s chief rivals for Stephen&#x27;s favour, and Henry disliked both of them intensely. Although Theobald was pious and well-educated, he had only become abbot the year before, and his election was probably influenced by the reputation of his monastery, which had already produced two archbishops of Canterbury, Lanfranc and Anselm. Theobald had no important family connections to advance his career, and few clerical allies.

==Archbishop==

===Early years===

Theobald was consecrated on 8 January 1139 by the legate, Alberic of Ostia. He went to Rome for his pallium and took part in the Second Lateran Council. As archbishop his behaviour was less political in comparison to that of his main rival, Henry of Blois. Henry was appointed a papal legate on 1 March 1139, which meant that Henry could now call church councils in England and had power equal to or exceeding that of Theobald. Theobald swore fealty to Stephen upon his election to Canterbury, recognising Stephen as the king of England.

Soon after his election Theobald selected his brother Walter to be archdeacon of Canterbury, and in 1148 promoted him to be Bishop of Rochester. Theobald attended the council held by Stephen in June 1139 that deprived Roger of Salisbury, Bishop of Salisbury, and his nephews Nigel, Bishop of Ely, and Alexander, Bishop of Lincoln, of their castles. According to most historians, Theobald took little part in the controversy that followed the council, which eventually ended with Roger&#x27;s death in 1139 and Nigel and Alexander&#x27;s restoration to favour. Recently however, that view has been challenged by two historians who argue that Theobald took a more active role in the council. They base their view on a &quot;Vita&quot;, or &quot;Life&quot; of the 12th-century mystic Christina of Markyate, which narrates the events and gives a more central role to Theobald, instead of Henry of Blois, in challenging Stephen&#x27;s arrest of the three bishops.

===Civil war===

Theobald&#x27;s actions in the next few years are intertwined with the history of Stephen&#x27;s ascension to the throne. Following King Henry I&#x27;s death in 1135 the succession was disputed between the king&#x27;s nephews—Stephen and his elder brother, Theobald II, Count of Champagne—and Henry&#x27;s surviving legitimate child Matilda, usually known as the Empress Matilda because of her first marriage to the German Emperor, Henry V. King Henry&#x27;s only legitimate son, William, had died in 1120. After Matilda was widowed in 1125, she returned to her father, who married her to Geoffrey, Count of Anjou. All the magnates of England and Normandy were required to declare fealty to Matilda as Henry&#x27;s heir, but when Henry I died, Stephen rushed to England and had himself crowned before either Theobald II or Matilda could react. The Norman barons accepted Stephen as Duke of Normandy, and Theobald II contented himself with his possessions in France. But Matilda was not resigned to the loss, and secured the support of the Scottish king, David, her maternal uncle, and in 1138 the support of her half-brother, Robert, Earl of Gloucester, an illegitimate son of Henry I.

After the Battle of Lincoln in 1141, with Stephen in captivity in Bristol, Theobald did not immediately join the Empress. He claimed that he needed to talk to Stephen before switching his oath of fealty. After consulting in person with Stephen, he secured permission to accept the current conditions, and then joined Henry of Blois, who had switched sides, at Winchester in April for a legatine council held to depose Stephen and crown Matilda as queen. Attendance at the council was sparse however, and the Empress could not be crowned because she did not hold London. After the unsuccessful attempt to crown Matilda, those gathered at Winchester had to flee before Stephen&#x27;s forces; one of Matilda&#x27;s chief supporters, her half-brother Robert of Gloucester, was captured. During their flight Theobald and his fellow bishops were robbed of their horses and ecclesiastical vestments. Theobald then took a leading part in the negotiations that led to the exchange of Robert for Stephen, which happened in November 1141. Henry of Blois, having switched sides again, then held another legatine council in Westminster, which reaffirmed Stephen as king. Theobald ceremonially crowned Stephen at Canterbury during the Christmas court held there.

Matilda remained in England until 1148. The disorders were at their peak between 1142 and 1148, but her cause could never secure enough support to enable her to be crowned. Nor could Stephen decisively defeat Matilda&#x27;s forces, which meant that England remained divided in allegiance between the two rivals. But while Matilda was in England, her husband Geoffrey was conquering Normandy, which he finally overran in 1144.

===Difficulties with Henry of Blois===
Theobald&#x27;s dealings with Henry of Blois, the Bishop of Winchester, his suffragan bishop, were strained because of Henry&#x27;s position as papal legate. Henry supported the appointment of William FitzHerbert as Archbishop of York in 1141, which Theobald opposed. Although Theobald spoke out against the manner of election, he took little active part in the subsequent electoral disputes, which resulted eventually in the deposition of FitzHerbert and his replacement at York by Henry Murdac. But in September 1143, Henry&#x27;s legatine powers lapsed when Pope Innocent II, who had made the legatine appointment, died. Celestine II was elected on 26 September 1143, but he was an opponent of Stephen, and thus was not favourably inclined towards Stephen&#x27;s brother Henry either. To secure appointment as legate, Theobald travelled to Rome in December 1143, arriving shortly before Celestine&#x27;s death on 8 March 1144. Theobald was probably accompanied by Nigel, Bishop of Ely, and Roger de Clinton, Bishop of Coventry. Before his death, Celestine forbade Theobald &quot;to allow any change to be made in the position of the English crown, since the transfer of it had been justly denounced, and the matter was still under dispute&quot;. This became the papal policy, and was a significant change from the recognition of Stephen as king by Pope Innocent II soon after Stephen&#x27;s coronation in 1135. It essentially forbade Theobald from crowning any successor to Stephen, especially while Stephen was still alive.

After Celestine&#x27;s death Theobald returned to England, stopping at St Denis Abbey in Paris to help Suger, the abbot, consecrate the newly rebuilt abbey church and its altars. Theobald was the only bishop present at the ceremony whose diocese was not in France. Meanwhile, Henry of Blois had arrived in Rome and begun negotiations with the new pope, Lucius II, over the elevation of the bishopric of Winchester to an archbishopric. It appears that Lucius appointed a legate, Cardinal Icmar, the Bishop of Tusculum, to travel to England and oversee the project, but Lucius died before anything was accomplished.

===Disputes with Stephen===

Theobald was back in Paris in May 1147 to meet with the new pope, Eugene III; among the issues probably discussed was Theobald&#x27;s dispute with Bernard of St Davids. Relations at this time between Theobald and Stephen seem to have been good, but when Eugene summoned the English bishops to the Council of Rheims in April 1148 the king forbade all of them from attending except for three he nominated: Chichester, Hereford and Norwich. Despite having been specifically refused permission Theobald sneaked away in a fishing boat, presumably accompanied by Gilbert Foliot, who attended the council with him. Theobald had a number of reasons for defying the king: chiefly his obedience to the pope&#x27;s order commanding his attendance, but also to keep the papacy from favouring the newly elected Archbishop of York, Henry Murdac, in the disputes between York and Canterbury. Murdac was known to be close to his fellow Cistercian Eugene.

Bethune, the Bishop of Hereford, died during the council, and Eugene nominated Foliot as his successor at Theobald&#x27;s urging. One of the council&#x27;s last acts was to suspend the non-attending bishops from their offices. The only English bishop specifically named was Henry of Blois, but the others who did not attend were presumably also suspended although not named. Henry of Blois was singled out for special handling, as the papacy ordered that he could not be reinstated by Theobald; Eugene reserved to himself the power to restore Henry. Theobald appears to have reinstated most of the bishops quickly, as Foliot wrote later in 1148 that only the bishops of Winchester, Durham, Worcester, Bath and Exeter were still suspended. Theobald forgave the bishops of Exeter, Worcester and Bath on 11 November 1148, according to the later chronicler Gervase of Canterbury. Gervase also lists Hilary of Chichester as one of those forgiven by Theobald on that date, but as Hilary attended the council it is likely that this is an error. Durham may have been omitted because he was a suffragan bishop of the Archbishop of York, and his reinstatement was in his archbishop&#x27;s hands.

The king was angry with Theobald for attending the council, even though the archbishop intervened with Eugene, who was displeased with the king for forbidding the bishops&#x27; attendance. Theobald persuaded Eugene against excommunicating Stephen, asking the pope to allow the king to make amends for his behaviour. But Stephen was unimpressed with Theobald&#x27;s intercession; he confiscated Theobald&#x27;s property and banished the archbishop. In September 1148, the pope put England under interdict, which was ignored except in Canterbury. At first Theobald was in exile at St Omer, where he consecrated Gilbert Foliot as Bishop of Hereford. He then returned to England and set himself up in Framlingham, which was held by Hugh Bigod, an adherent of the Empress. From there he conducted the ecclesiastical business of England, but Theobald&#x27;s presence in the country posed a threat to Stephen&#x27;s authority, and Stephen quickly settled the differences between the two.

Henry of Blois had lost his legateship before Celestine became pope, but it was not until about 1150 that Theobald was appointed legate by Eugene III, perhaps owing to the exhortations of Bernard of Clairvaux. Theobald held the legatine powers in England until his death in 1161. In 1151 Theobald held a legatine council in London. The council was attended by the king and Eustace, the king&#x27;s eldest son, as well as other members of the nobility. The council decreed eight canons, or ecclesiastical statutes, including ones condemning the pillaging of church properties and the imposition of financial levies on the clergy. Another canon of the council stated that bishops should no longer pursue violators of church property in the royal courts, but should use ecclesiastical courts instead. The other canons dealt with procedural matters arising from excommunications for abusing church property.

The next year, the archbishop refused to crown Eustace and was again exiled by Stephen, who was attempting to secure the succession for his son by imitating the Capetian dynasty of France, which usually saw the king&#x27;s heir crowned during his father&#x27;s lifetime. Although Theobald claimed papal authority for refusal, based on the prohibition by Celestine, it was more probable that he and the bishops had no desire to prolong the civil war. Stephen demanded in April 1152 that Theobald crown Eustace, but the archbishop once again refused, and went into exile in Flanders. Theobald claimed that Stephen had gained the throne through perjury, implying that if the archbishop crowned Eustace, Theobald would be perpetuating this crime. The king and the archbishop reached a truce in August.

In January 1153 Henry of Anjou, Matilda&#x27;s son, invaded England in pursuit of his claim to the throne, and with the death of Eustace in August 1153, Stephen gave up. Theobald was instrumental in the negotiations between Henry and Stephen that resulted in the Treaty of Wallingford, securing Henry&#x27;s succession to the throne. Theobald was also present when Henry of Anjou met with Stephen&#x27;s second son William, probably after Eustace&#x27;s death, to settle William&#x27;s lands and status after Henry succeeded Stephen. Pope Eugene III forced Stephen to reverse the sentence of banishment, and Theobald returned to his see. Later it was mainly Theobald and Henry of Blois who negotiated the treaty ending the civil war, as neither Stephen nor Henry of Anjou was interested in a compromise. Henry of Blois and Theobald, who had previously found working together difficult, managed to secure an end to the disorders in England.

===Under Henry II===
Theobald was present at Stephen&#x27;s deathbed in October 1154, and Stephen named him as regent until Henry could take up the crown. During the six weeks before Henry arrived, the archbishop had little difficulty in keeping the peace. After Henry&#x27;s arrival, Theobald crowned Henry and his wife Eleanor of Aquitaine on 19 December 1154 at Westminster Abbey.

For most of the remainder of Theobald&#x27;s life he was occupied with ecclesiastical affairs in his diocese, as well as attending the royal court when Henry was in England. In January 1155 Theobald helped to secure the Chancellorship for his protégé, Thomas Becket, an action that Barlow speculates happened because Theobald hoped to secure more influence with the king through Becket. If this was his hope, Barlow notes that it did not materialise. Although the king and the archbishop occasionally clashed when their interests conflicted, both appear to have wished to minimise the disputes and were willing to compromise to secure good relations. As an example, when Pope Adrian IV died in September 1159, two rival claimants for the papal throne emerged. King Henry, following the custom of his grandfather Henry I, forbade the bishops from recognising either claimant. Eventually, after Henry weighed the political factors, he recognised Pope Alexander III, and it was only then that Theobald also recognised Alexander as pope.

However, not everything was always harmonious between the king and the archbishop. In 1156, Theobald supported the efforts of Osbert de Bayeux, who was accused of poisoning William the Archbishop of York, to secure a trial for his alleged crimes in an ecclesiastical court rather than in the royal court. The crime had taken place during Stephen&#x27;s reign, but Stephen&#x27;s death had prevented Osbert from being tried in 1154. The delay allowed the shifting of the trial to the church courts, which Henry opposed. Although Theobald&#x27;s position displeased the king no open rupture ensued. Theobald himself admitted to the papacy in 1154 that English custom was to try clergy for crimes in the secular courts.

Theobald called a church council at London in June 1160, which dealt partly with the issues of the papal schism; his health was poor and he had to be taken to the council in a litter. A further cause of distress to Theobald was what he saw as the ingratitude of Becket, who did not visit the ailing archbishop.

===Relations with his cathedral clergy===

Theobald&#x27;s cathedral chapter was composed of monks, and he was considered the abbot of the monastery of Christ Church Cathedral. Because of his episcopal duties, the regular running of the cathedral was the responsibility of the prior. At the time of Theobald&#x27;s election there were about 140 monks in the chapter, and they seem to have expected that Theobald, being a monk himself, would take their side in disputes and continue to support their needs. Theobald began well, sending a party of monks from the cathedral to St Martin&#x27;s Priory at Dover, which had been settled with canons instead of monks. Theobald replaced the canons with the monks. Theobald also refounded a collegiate church at South Malling near Lewes to provide benefices for his cathedral chapter.

Theobald worked with his first prior, Jeremiah, to eliminate clerical marriage in the diocese. But Jeremiah had been elected during the vacancy before Theobald&#x27;s election, and the monks had not secured papal permission for the election of a new prior, so eventually Theobald decided to remove Jeremiah and install his own choice as prior. Jeremiah appealed to the papacy, but Theobald deposed him while the appeal was ongoing, and appointed Walter Durdent as prior. Innocent II, however, appointed Henry of Blois to hear the case, and Henry sided with Jeremiah and ordered Jeremiah&#x27;s reinstatement. Theobald then refused to perform any services in the cathedral until Jeremiah was removed by the chapter. The lack of services would have deprived the monks of income, and Theobald&#x27;s threat had the desired effect, as Jeremiah resigned his office and left Christ Church for St Augustine&#x27;s Abbey, Canterbury. Durdent was reinstalled as prior and remained in that position until he became Bishop of Coventry in October 1149.

At Easter, 1151, Theobald took over the management of the chapter&#x27;s estates, as the new prior, Walter Parvus, was not up to the task. At first, there were no disputes, but soon the monks felt that Theobald was cheating them and imposing too rigorous a definition of poverty, and asked that the stewardship of the estates be restored to Parvus. Theobald refused and the monks attempted to appeal to the papacy. Their envoys, however, were caught by agents of the archbishop and the appeal went nowhere. Theobald then deposed Parvus and appointed a new prior. Theobald&#x27;s relations with the monks after this point seem to have been without incident.

===Relations with other monastic houses===

Theobald also had a dispute with St Augustine&#x27;s Abbey over the right of the archbishop to receive annual payments, and whether those payments were for sacraments performed by the archbishop, which would have been uncanonical, or were for other reasons. The dispute was eventually settled by a compromise in which St Augustine&#x27;s continued to make the payments but they were specifically stated not to be for sacraments. Another dispute with St Augustine&#x27;s concerned the right of the archbishops to have a say in the election of new abbots and whether or not the abbots would make a profession of obedience to the archbishops. This was eventually settled by a papal mandate of 1144 instructing the abbots to profess obedience.

The conflict re-surfaced in 1149, when some of the monks of St Augustine&#x27;s, led by their prior and sacrist, refused to obey the interdict placed on England by Theobald and Pope Eugene III. Theobald had the two officials excommunicated and publicly flogged. When the previous abbot of St Augustine&#x27;s died in 1151, the prior, Silvester, paid the king for the right to administer the abbey and to hold a free election for a new abbot. The monks then proceeded to elect Silvester as the new abbot, but Theobald refused to confirm the election, accusing Silvester of buying the office. Eventually, however, Pope Eugene III ordered Theobald to allow Silvester to take up the office, which Theobald did in August 1152. Theobald and St Augustine&#x27;s also came into conflict over the abbey&#x27;s claims of exemption from the archbishops&#x27; oversight, because it owed obedience directly to the pope. Papal documents held at Rome backed the abbey, but there were no English royal charters that gave the abbey its liberty from the archbishops. Theobald attempted to end the confusion by legal actions both at Rome and in England, but the record was mixed. The documents at Rome clearly favoured the abbey, but at a royal council held at Northampton in 1157, Henry II ruled in favour of Theobald. As part of the settlement Silvester, as abbot, was required to make a formal profession of obedience to Theobald, something he had been attempting to avoid since his election. The struggle with Silvester was just one event in the long history of the dispute between Canterbury and St Augustine&#x27;s.

As well as St Augustine&#x27;s, the abbots of a number of other monasteries in the diocese of Canterbury are known to have professed obedience to Theobald, as the documents recording the events survive. Not only abbots and priors from within Canterbury, but some from other dioceses swore to obey Theobald, although normally such oaths would have gone to their diocesan bishop instead. Most of these exceptions occurred because the monastic house claimed exemption from the oversight of their diocesan bishop, and had a tradition of making those oaths to Canterbury instead. Besides these events, Theobald also intervened in the elections of some abbots, although not always successfully. He attempted to secure the right of Gilbert Foliot to remain Abbot of Gloucester after Foliot&#x27;s election as Bishop of Hereford, but a new abbot was elected by the monks of Gloucester. Theobald was more successful in securing the election of William, who had previously been a monk at Christ Church, to be Abbot of Evesham over the objections of some of the monks of Evesham.

Theobald also became embroiled in the dispute between Hilary, the Bishop of Chichester, and Walter de Lucy, the abbot of Battle Abbey, over Hilary&#x27;s claims to jurisdiction over the abbey and the abbey&#x27;s counter-claims that it was exempt from episcopal supervision. The abbey had never received a papal exemption, but relied instead on its royal foundation by King William I of England and its status as an eigenkirche, or proprietary church of the king. Under King Stephen, the abbey&#x27;s claims prevailed, but after Stephen&#x27;s death Hilary excommunicated the abbot, who appealed to the papacy. Theobald supported the bishop, who eventually secured a trial before King Henry II. It was a minor setback for Theobald when the case was eventually decided in Battle&#x27;s favour, mainly on the basis of charters that were thought at the time to be genuine, but modern historians have come to believe were forged.

===Relations with other bishops===

Theobald was instrumental in securing the subordination of the Welsh bishoprics to Canterbury. His first act in this area was the consecration of Meurig as Bishop of Bangor in 1140, during which Meurig made a profession of obedience like those made by other bishops subject to Canterbury. Bernard, Bishop of St Davids, contested Theobald&#x27;s right to consecrate Meurig and instead asserted that St Davids should be considered an archbishopric, and that Bernard should receive a pallium. This went against the last half-century of precedent that Canterbury had jurisdiction over the four Welsh sees, a precedent that dated back to Anselm&#x27;s days when Anselm had consecrated Urban as Bishop of Llandaff in 1107.

Also in 1140, Theobald consecrated Uhtred as Bishop of Llandaff, with Uhtred also swearing to obey Theobald. Likewise, when Theobald consecrated Gilbert as Bishop of St Asaph in 1142, a similar profession of obedience was made. Along with these consecrations, Theobald&#x27;s legal efforts enabled him to withstand the attempts of Bernard to turn St Davids into an archbishopric, and when Bernard was succeeded by David fitzGerald in 1148, Theobald secured the new bishop&#x27;s profession of obedience to Canterbury, thus ending the efforts to remove Wales from Canterbury&#x27;s jurisdiction. Also in 1148, Pope Eugene decided in favour of Canterbury and against the claims of St Davids, securing Canterbury&#x27;s jurisdiction over Wales.

Theobald even maintained the theoretical claim of Canterbury to jurisdiction over Irish sees by consecrating Patrick as Bishop of Limerick in 1140. That, however, was the last assertion of the claim, as in 1152 the papal legate Giovanni Paparo reorganised the Irish dioceses and settled the issue by appointing the Archbishop of Armagh the primate of Ireland.

Relations with bishops in England remained good, with little activity in the long-running Canterbury–York dispute over the primacy of Britain. Theobald obtained a vague confirmation of his see&#x27;s primacy from Celestine II in 1143–1144, but at the Council of Reims in 1148 Eugene clarified that this primacy did not affect the claims of York to be independent of Canterbury. Because of the unsettled election disputes during the 1140s over the see of York, when it was contested between William of York and Henry Murdac, Theobald faced little challenge from either William or Murdac as to the traditional dispute between Canterbury and York. When William of York died in 1154, Theobald secured York for his protégé, Roger de Pont L&#x27;Evêque. Further peace between the two sees was ensured when Theobald consecrated Roger without requiring a profession of obedience, which had previously been a major bone of contention between the two.

===Patronage and household===
Theobald&#x27;s household included many young men of ability, including his successor Thomas Becket. Theobald was instrumental in the early spread of Roman law to England, inviting the Bologna-schooled jurist Vacarius to join his administration and advise on legal matters. Whether Vacarius actually started a school in Theobald&#x27;s household is unclear, but in the 1140s he taught briefly at Oxford. Theobald was instrumental in fostering the teaching of canon law in England; the conflict that later arose between Henry II and Thomas Becket had its roots in disputes that were exposed during Theobald&#x27;s time in office. While still in Normandy, Theobald had made an intense study of ecclesiastical or canon law, which he continued after being elected archbishop.

Although Theobald was a monk, his episcopal household was not monastic in character. As he settled into the role of archbishop, he seems to have left most of his monastic habits behind, although he continued to have a monk as a companion. His nephews and brother benefited from his nepotism, with his nephews becoming part of his household early in his archiepiscopate. The four nephews—Guillaume, Gilbert, Roger and Lechard—were witnesses to a charter of Theobald&#x27;s dated to about 1150 or 1153. After Theobald&#x27;s death, Guillaume was a clerk in Bartholomew, the Bishop of Exeter&#x27;s household in around 1172.

Another charter of Theobald&#x27;s from about 1152 shows the usual household staff that surrounded him. It was witnessed by the archbishop&#x27;s crossbearer, three of Theobald&#x27;s nephews and the clerk who presumably was in charge of them, a chancellor, two chaplains who were monks, a butler, dispenser, chamberlain, steward, cook, usher, porter and marshal. Theobald also at about the same time granted a mill to his baker named William and some lands to his cook William and the cook&#x27;s heirs.

Theobald was the patron of three eminent men: Becket, Vacarius, and John of Salisbury. John of Salisbury was secretary to Theobald for many years, and after Theobald&#x27;s death became Bishop of Chartres. It was during John&#x27;s time as secretary that he wrote his two most famous works, the &quot;Policraticus&quot; and the &quot;Metalogicon&quot;. Others who studied for a time in Theobald&#x27;s household were Roger de Pont L&#x27;Evêque, later Archbishop of York, John Belemis, later Archbishop of Lyons, John de Pageham, later Bishop of Worcester, Bartholomew Iscanus, later Bishop of Exeter, William of Northall, later Bishop of Worcester, and William de Vere, later Bishop of Hereford. In all, his household produced three archbishops and six bishops. The household itself, although not formally a school, acted as one, with many going on to careers in the church.

==Death and legacy==

Theobald died on 18 April 1161, after a long illness, at his palace in Canterbury. He was buried in Canterbury Cathedral, in the Holy Trinity Chapel, near the tomb of Archbishop Lanfranc. His coffin was opened in 1190 during repairs to the cathedral and his body was found to be uncorrupted, but efforts to secure his canonisation as a saint on the basis of that evidence were unsuccessful. He was reburied in the nave near the altar to St Mary, with his old marble tomb replaced above his new resting place. In 1787 his lead coffin was found in Canterbury.

Although Theobald was troubled by the opposition of his suffragan Henry of Blois, he regained control of the English Church, secured the rights of his see, and helped maintain the unity of the realm. Contemporaries were somewhat divided on his effectiveness and personality. Gervase of Canterbury felt that he was too impetuous, probably because of Theobald&#x27;s treatment of his priors at Christ Church. Henry of Huntingdon, who knew him, felt that he was a worthy archbishop. Theobald&#x27;s legacy perhaps suffered because he was overshadowed by his successor, Becket. Modern historians have been kinder than his contemporaries; Frank Barlow says of Theobald that he was &quot;an upright man, but quick tempered, and sometimes spoke far too rashly&quot;.

<text>Sir John Mills (born Lewis Ernest Watts Mills; 22 February 190823 April 2005) was an English actor who appeared in more than 120 films in a career spanning seven decades. He excelled on camera as an appealing British everyman who often portrayed guileless, wounded war heroes. In 1971, he received the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Daughter&quot;.

For his work in film, Mills was knighted by Elizabeth II in 1976. In 2002, he received a BAFTA Fellowship from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts and was named a Disney Legend by The Walt Disney Company.

==Early life==
John Mills was born on 22 February 1908 in North Elmham, Norfolk, the son of Edith Mills (née Baker), a theatre box office manager, and Lewis Mills, a mathematics teacher.
Mills was born at Watts Naval School, where his father was a master. He spent his early years in the village of Belton where his father was the headmaster of the village school. He first felt the thrill of performing at a concert in the school hall when he was six years old. He then lived in a modest house on Gainsborough Road, Felixstowe, Suffolk, until 1929. His elder sister was Annette Mills, remembered as presenter of BBC Television&#x27;s &quot;Muffin the Mule&quot; (1946–55).

He was educated at Balham Grammar School in London, Sir John Leman High School in Beccles and Norwich High School for Boys, where it is said that his initials can still be seen carved into the brickwork on the side of the building in Upper St Giles Street. Upon leaving school he worked as a clerk at a corn merchant&#x27;s in Ipswich before finding employment in London as a commercial traveller for the Sanitas Disinfectant Company.

===Military service===
In September 1939, at the start of the Second World War, Mills enlisted in the British Army, joining the Royal Engineers. He was later commissioned as a Second Lieutenant, but in 1942 he received a medical discharge because of a stomach ulcer.

==Career==

===Early career===
Mills took an early interest in acting, making his professional début at the London Hippodrome in &quot;The Five O&#x27;Clock Girl&quot; in 1929. He followed this with a cabaret act.

Mills then got a job with a theatrical company that toured India, China and the Far East performing a number of plays. Noël Coward saw him appear in a production of &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot; in Singapore and wrote Mills a letter of introduction to use back in London.

On his return, Mills starred in &quot;The 1931 Revue&quot;, Coward&#x27;s &quot;Cavalcade&quot; (1931) and the Noël Coward revue &quot;Words and Music&quot; (1932).

He made his film debut in &quot;The Midshipmaid&quot; (1932). He also appeared in &quot;The Ghost Camera&quot; (1933) with Ida Lupino and &quot;Britannia of Billingsgate&quot; (1934).

Mills was promoted to leading roles in &quot;A Political Party&quot; (1934), a comedy. He was in a series of quota quickies: &quot;The River Wolves&quot; (1934); &quot;Those Were the Days&quot; (1934), the first film of Will Hay; &quot;The Lash&quot; (1934); &quot;Blind Justice&quot; (1934); &quot;Doctor&#x27;s Orders&quot; (1934); and &quot;Car of Dreams&quot; (1935). He did &quot;Jill Darling&quot; (1934) on stage and was one of many names in &quot;Royal Cavalcade&quot; (1935).

===&quot;A&quot; movies===
Mills had the star role in an A film, &quot;Brown on Resolution&quot; (1935). It was back to quota quickies for &quot;Charing Cross Road&quot; (1935) and &quot;The First Offence&quot; (1936). He had another excellent part in an &quot;A&quot;, playing Lord Guildford Dudley in &quot;Tudor Rose&quot; (1936). He did &quot;Aren&#x27;t Men Beasts?&quot; (1936) on stage and worked for Hollywood director Raoul Walsh in &quot;O.H.M.S.&quot; (1937).

Mills starred in &quot;The Green Cockatoo&quot; (1937) directed by William Cameron Menzies. He appeared as Colley in the hugely popular 1939 film version of &quot;Goodbye, Mr Chips&quot;, opposite Robert Donat.

===World War II===
At the Old Vic he was in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; (1939), &quot;She Stoops to Conquer&quot; (1939) and &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; (1939–40). He joined the army in 1939 but occasionally made films on leave. He went back to movies with &quot;Old Bill and Son&quot; (1940) and made &quot;Cottage to Let&quot; (1941), a war film for Anthony Asquith. Mills went back to supporting Will Hay in &quot;The Black Sheep of Whitehall&quot; (1942) and he was one of many names in the war film, &quot;The Big Blockade&quot; (1942).

He was in &quot;Men in Shadow&quot; (1942) on stage, written by his wife. He achieved acclaim for his performance as an able seaman in Noël Coward&#x27;s &quot;In Which We Serve&quot; (1942), a huge hit. Mills had another good support role in &quot;The Young Mr. Pitt&quot; (1942) playing William Wilberforce opposite Robert Donat. He was invalided out of the army in 1942.

===Stardom===
Mills&#x27;s climb to stardom began when he had the lead role in &quot;We Dive at Dawn&quot; (1943), a film directed by Asquith about submariners. He was top billed in &quot;This Happy Breed&quot; (1944), directed by David Lean and adapted from a Noël Coward play.

Also popular was &quot;Waterloo Road&quot; (1945), from Sidney Gilliat, in which Mills played a man who goes AWOL to retrieve his wife from a draft-dodger (played by Stewart Granger). Mills played a pilot in &quot;The Way to the Stars&quot; (1945), directed by Asquith from a script by Terence Rattigan, and another big hit in Britain. He did &quot;Duet for Two Hands&quot; (1945) on stage.

Mills had his greatest success to date as Pip in &quot;Great Expectations&quot; (1946), directed by David Lean. It was the third biggest hit at the British box office that year and Mills was voted the sixth most popular star.

Less successful critically and financially was &quot;So Well Remembered&quot; (1947) which used American writers and directors. &quot;The October Man&quot; (1947) was a mildly popular thriller from Roy Ward Baker.

Mills played the title role in &quot;Scott of the Antarctic&quot; (1948), a biopic of Captain Scott. It was the fourth-most-watched film of the year in Britain and Mills was voted the eighth-biggest star in an exhibitors&#x27; poll.

===Producer===
Mills turned producer with &quot;The History of Mr Polly&quot; (1949) from the novel by H. G. Wells. It was directed by Anthony Pelissier and Mills said it was his favorite film. Pelissier also made &quot;The Rocking Horse Winner&quot; (1949) which Mills produced; he also played a small role. More liked at the box office was a submarine drama, &quot;Morning Departure&quot; (1950), directed by Baker. By this stage his fee was a reported £20,000 a film.

===Career slump===
After &quot;Morning Departure&quot; Mills took almost two years off. The films he made on his return were not popular: a thriller, &quot;Mr Denning Drives North&quot; (1951); &quot;The Gentle Gunman&quot; (1952), where he and Dirk Bogarde played IRA gunmen for Basil Dearden; and &quot;The Long Memory&quot; (1953), a thriller from Robert Hamer.

===Popularity revival===

Mills had his first hit in a number of years with &quot;Hobson&#x27;s Choice&quot; (1954), directed by Lean. He appeared in the war film &quot;The Colditz Story&quot; (1955).

Mills played a supporting role in a movie for MGM, &quot;The End of the Affair&quot; (1955), with Deborah Kerr and Van Johnson. More liked in Britain was another war story, &quot;Above Us the Waves&quot; (1955); this was the sixth-most-popular film at the British box office that year, and it helped Mills become the fifth-most-popular star in the country.

After &quot;Escapade&quot; (1955), Mills made the popular military comedy &quot;The Baby and the Battleship&quot; (1956), one of the biggest hits of 1956. Also on that list was another Mills comedy, &quot;It&#x27;s Great to Be Young&quot; (1956).

Mills had a key support role as a peasant in &quot;War and Peace&quot; (1956) and made a cameo in &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot; (1956).

Mills appeared in the thrillers: &quot;Town on Trial&quot; (1957) directed by John Guillermin and &quot;The Vicious Circle&quot; (1957). More popular with the public were the war films: &quot;Dunkirk&quot; (1958), the second-most-popular film of the year in Britain; &quot;Ice Cold in Alex&quot; (1958), directed by J. Lee Thompson; and &quot;I Was Monty&#x27;s Double&quot;&#x27;(1958), directed by Guillermin.

In the 1959 crime drama &quot;Tiger Bay&quot;, directed by Thompson, Mills played a police detective investigating a murder that a young girl has witnessed. His daughter Hayley was cast, and earned excellent reviews.

Mills went to Australia to play a cane cutter in the Hollywood financed &quot;Summer of the Seventeenth Doll&quot; (1959). The movie was poorly received critically and commercially.

Better received was &quot;Tunes of Glory&quot; (1960), a military drama directed by Ronald Neame co-starring Alec Guinness. Mills&#x27;s performance earned him a Best Actor Award at the Venice Film Festival.

Walt Disney saw &quot;Tiger Bay&quot; and offered Hayley Mills the lead role in &quot;Pollyanna&quot; (1960). Disney also offered John Mills the lead in the adventure film &quot;Swiss Family Robinson&quot; (1960), which was a huge hit. He did &quot;Ross&quot; (1960–61) on stage.

The Rank Organisation insisted Mills play the role of the priest in &quot;The Singer Not the Song&quot; (1961) opposite Dirk Bogarde. Mills and Baker reteamed on an interracial drama, &quot;Flame in the Streets&quot; (1961), and an Italian-British war film, &quot;The Valiant&quot; (1962).

Mills did a comedy with James Mason, &quot;Tiara Tahiti&quot; (1962). He had a support role in &quot;The Chalk Garden&quot; (1964) starring Hayley.

After a cameo on the war film &quot;Operation Crossbow&quot; (1965), Mills made a third film with his daughter, &quot;The Truth About Spring&quot; (1965). He had a cameo in &quot;King Rat&quot; (1965) for Bryan Forbes, who then directed Mills in &quot;The Wrong Box&quot; (1966). Mills played Hayley&#x27;s father-in-law on screen in &quot;The Family Way&quot; (1966). He then directed her in &quot;Sky West and Crooked&quot; (1966) from a script written by his wife.

He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; on two occasions, firstly in 1960 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews outside Pinewood Studios, and again in 1983 when Eamonn surprised him on the stage of London&#x27;s Wyndham&#x27;s Theatre at the curtain call of the play &quot;Little Lies&quot;.

===Character actor===
Mills began to move into character roles, supporting Hugh O&#x27;Brian in &quot;Africa Texas Style&quot; (1967) and Rod Taylor in &quot;Chuka&quot; (1967). He went to Italy for a giallo, &quot;A Black Veil for Lisa&quot; (1968) and played William Hamilton in &quot;Emma Hamilton&quot; (1968).

Mills had a cameo in &quot;Oh! What a Lovely War&quot; (1969) for director Richard Attenborough and supported Mark Lester (though he was top billed) in &quot;Run Wild, Run Free&quot; (1969). He went to Australia to star in a convict drama, &quot;Adam&#x27;s Woman&quot; (1970).
For his role as the village idiot in &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1970)—a complete departure from his usual style—Mills won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar.

He was in &quot;Dulcima&quot; (1971), then had support roles in &quot;Young Winston&quot; (1972) for Attenborough, &quot;Lady Caroline Lamb&quot; (1972) and &quot;Oklahoma Crude&quot; (1973). On stage he did &quot;Veterans&quot; at the Royal Court, &quot;At the End of the Day&quot; (1973), &quot;The Good Companions&quot; (1974), &quot;Great Expectations&quot; (1975) and &quot;Separate Tables&quot; (1977).

Also on the small screen, in 1974 he starred as Captain Tommy &quot;The Elephant&quot; Devon in the six-part television drama series &quot;The Zoo Gang&quot;, about a group of former underground freedom fighters from the Second World War, alongside Brian Keith, Lilli Palmer and Barry Morse.

In the late 1970s Mills could still get lead roles in films, as shown by &quot;The &quot;Human&quot; Factor&quot; (1975), &quot;Trial by Combat&quot; (1976) and &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Advocate&quot; (1977). He had filmed supporting roles in &quot;The Big Sleep&quot; and &quot;The Thirty Nine Steps&quot; (both 1978).

His most famous television role was probably as the title character in &quot;Quatermass&quot; for ITV in 1979. He followed this with a sitcom in &quot;Young at Heart&quot; (1980–82).

On the big screen he was now mainly playing upper-crust types as in &quot;Zulu Dawn&quot; (1979), &quot;Gandhi&quot; (1982) and &quot;Sahara&quot; (1983). He performed &quot;Goodbye Mr Chips&quot; on stage (1982) followed by &quot;Little Lies&quot; (1983).

===Later career===

In 1986 he did &quot;The Petition&quot; at the National and the following year did &quot;Pygmalion&quot; on Broadway. He provided a voice for &quot;When the Wind Blows&quot; (1986) and supported Madonna in &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot; (1987). His best roles were on TV in &quot;Harnessing Peacocks&quot; (1993) and &quot;Martin Chuzzlewit&quot; (1994). Mills also starred as &quot;&quot; in the filmed version of the musical &quot;Cats&quot; in 1998.

In 2000, Mills released his extensive home cine-film footage in a documentary film entitled &quot;Sir John Mills&#x27;s Moving Memories&quot;, with interviews with Mills, his children Hayley, Juliet and Jonathan and Richard Attenborough. The film was produced and written by Jonathan Mills, directed and edited by Marcus Dillistone, and features behind the scenes footage and stories from films such as &quot;Ice Cold in Alex&quot; and &quot;Dunkirk&quot;. In addition the film also includes home footage of many of Mills&#x27;s friends and fellow cast members including Laurence Olivier, Harry Andrews, Walt Disney, David Niven, Dirk Bogarde, Rex Harrison and Tyrone Power. He portrayed a charming old gent as head of an art museum in 1997&#x27;s . Mills&#x27;s last cinema appearance was playing a tramp in &quot;Lights 2&quot; (directed by Marcus Dillistone); the cinematographer was Jack Cardiff. They had last worked together on &quot;Scott of the Antarctic&quot; in 1948.

==Personal life and death==
His first wife was the actress Aileen Raymond, They were married in 1932 and divorced in 1941. Raymond later became the mother of actor Ian Ogilvy.

His second wife was the dramatist Mary Hayley Bell. Their marriage, on 16 January 1941, lasted for 64 years until his death in 2005. They were married in a rushed civil ceremony, because of the war; it was not until sixty years later that they were married in a church. They lived in The Wick, London, for many years. They sold the house to musician Ronnie Wood in 1971 and moved to Hills House, Denham, Buckinghamshire.

Mills and Bell had two daughters, Juliet, star of television&#x27;s &quot;Nanny and the Professor&quot; and Hayley, a Disney child star who appeared in &quot;Pollyanna&quot;, &quot;The Parent Trap&quot; and &quot;Whistle Down the Wind&quot;. They had one son, Jonathan Mills, a screenwriter. In 1947, Mills appeared with his daughters in the film &quot;So Well Remembered&quot;. The three also appeared together decades later, on an episode of ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Love Boat&quot;. Mills&#x27;s grandson by Hayley, Crispian Mills, is a musician, best known for his work with the raga rock group Kula Shaker.

In the years leading up to John Mills&#x27;s death, he appeared on television only on special occasions, his sight having failed almost completely by 1992. After that, his film roles were cameos. He wrote an autobiography entitled &quot;Up in the Clouds, Gentlemen Please&quot;, which was published in 1980 and revised in 2001.

Mills died on 23 April 2005 in Denham, Buckinghamshire, aged 97, following a stroke.

Lady Mills died on 1 December 2005. They were buried in St Mary the Virgin Churchyard, Denham, Buckinghamshire.

==Honours==

Mills was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1960. In 1976 he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II.

<text>The River Hamble in south Hampshire, England, rises near Bishop&#x27;s Waltham and flows for through Botley, Bursledon, and Lower Swanwick before entering Southampton Water between Hamble Common and Warsash.

The river is tidal for about half its length and is navigable below Botley. From the medieval period to the present it has been a major ship and boat-building area. Leisure craft are still built by the Hamble today. One of the main builders was Luke &amp; Co, later Luke Bros, from around 1890 to its closure in 1945. The lower reaches are a major yachting area with easy access to the sheltered waters of Southampton Water and The Solent.

== Course ==
From source to mouth the river makes a repeated curve heading south-southwest. It gains tributary streams before reaching Botley, the site of an ancient watermill. Below Botley, the river becomes tidal and navigable. It gains strength from adjoining streams, draining surrounding Hedge End, Curdridge, Shedfield, and Burridge.

This section was extensively used for medieval shipbuilding, using timber grown locally in the neighbouring woods. Nearby Kings Copse, a cut-back form of Kings Forest, speaks of this key use of the land.

The river&#x27;s west bank can be accessed from Manor Farm Country Park, where it is possible to walk through Dock Copse and Fosters Copse. At extreme low tide, it is just possible to see the remains of the wreck of Henry V&#x27;s 15th century warship &quot;Grace Dieu&quot;. This section of the river was also home to HMS &quot;Cricket&quot;, the Royal Marine landing craft crew training base, during World War II.

At south of Botley, the river passes between the villages of Bursledon and Lower Swanwick and is crossed by the M27 motorway, the Portsmouth to Southampton railway line, and the A27 road via large bridges. A further south of Bursledon, the river flows between the villages of Hamble-le-Rice and Warsash before entering Southampton Water.

A passenger ferry crosses the river between Hamble-le-Rice and Warsash, forming a link for the Solent Way and E9 European Coastal Path. This section of the river is dominated by a number of marinas, the largest being the Port Hamble Marina, and boat yards on both banks as far upstream as Bursledon. On the east bank, south of Warsash, is the Warsash Maritime School, part of Solent University, which provides training for merchant navy crew.

==Lifeboat==
The Hamble and nearby Solent are patrolled by Hamble Lifeboat, an independent voluntary rescue service based in Hamble-le-Rice.

==Water quality==
The Environment Agency measure water quality of the river systems in England. Each is given an overall ecological status, which may be one of five levels: high, good, moderate, poor and bad. There are several components that are used to determine this, including biological status, which looks at the quantity and varieties of invertebrates, angiosperms and fish. Chemical status, which compares the concentrations of various chemicals against known safe concentrations, is rated good or fail.

Water quality of the River Hamble in 2019:
In the 1970s and 80s the many yachts using the river polluted the water by leaching tributyltin from their anti-fouling paints. By 1988 it had the highest known level in the UK. With its banning for use by vessels under long, the general concentration in the tidal waters declined to a level that is considered harmless.

<text>Wellman Braud (January 25, 1891 – October 29, 1966) was an American jazz upright bassist. His family sometimes spelled their last name &quot;Breaux&quot;, pronounced &quot;Bro&quot;.

== Biography ==
Born in St. James Parish, Louisiana, Braud settled in New Orleans, in his early teens. He was playing the violin and the upright bass and leading a trio in venues in the Storyville District before 1910. He moved to Chicago, Illinois in 1917. In 1923, he visited London with the Plantation Orchestra, in which he doubled on bass and trombone. Next, he moved to New York City, where he played with Wilber Sweatman&#x27;s band before joining Duke Ellington.

It has been observed by Branford Marsalis that Braud was the first to utilize the walking bass style, that has been a mainstay in modern jazz, as opposed to the &#x27;two-beat&#x27; pattern the tuba plays in the New Orleans style. His vigorous melodic bass playing, alternately plucking, slapping, and bowing, was an important feature of the early Ellington Orchestra in the 1920s and 1930s. Braud&#x27;s playing on Ellington&#x27;s regular radio broadcasts and recordings helped popularize the slap style of string bass playing, as well as encouraging many dance bands of the time to switch from using a tuba to an upright bass. (Like many of his contemporary New Orleans bassists, Braud doubled on tuba, and he recorded with that instrument on some sides with Ellington).

In 1936, Braud co-managed a short-lived Harlem club with Jimmie Noone, and recorded with the group Spirits of Rhythm from 1935 to 1937. He played with other New York bands including those of Kaiser Marshall, Hot Lips Page, and Sidney Bechet, and returned for a while to Ellington in 1944. In 1956, he joined the Kid Ory Band. In the late 1950s, he joined Barbara Dane&#x27;s trio alongside pianist/cornetist Kenny Whitson, turning down opportunities to return to Duke Ellington&#x27;s band or tour with Louis Armstrong.

He is a distant relative of the Marsalis brothers on their mother&#x27;s side.

He died in Los Angeles, California, at the age of 76.

Duke Ellington subsequently paid tribute to Braud, including the composition ‘Portrait of Wellman Braud&#x27; on his 1970 album &quot;New Orleans Suite&quot;.

<text>The River Hull is a navigable river in the East Riding of Yorkshire in Northern England. It rises from a series of springs to the west of Driffield, and enters the Humber Estuary at Kingston upon Hull. Following a period when the Archbishops of York charged tolls for its use, it became a free navigation. The upper reaches became part of the Driffield Navigation from 1770, after which they were again subject to tolls, and the section within the city of Hull came under the jurisdiction of the Port of Hull, with the same result.

Most of its course is through low-lying land that is at or just above sea level, and regular flooding has been a long-standing problem along the waterway. Drainage schemes to alleviate it were constructed on both sides of the river. The Holderness Drainage scheme to the east was completed in 1772, with a second phase in 1805, and the Beverley and Barmston Drain to the west was completed in 1810. Since 1980, the mouth of the river has been protected by a tidal barrier at the estuary, which can be closed to prevent tidal surges entering the river system and causing flooding upriver.

Most of the bridges which cross the river are movable, to allow shipping to pass. There are six swing bridges; four bascule bridges, two of which have twin leaves, one for each carriageway of the roads which they carry; and three Scherzer lift bridges, which are a type of rolling bascule bridge. The former Scott Street Bridge (taken out of use 1994 and dismantled 2020) was originally powered from a high pressure water main maintained by the first public power distribution company in the world.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Hull&quot; is probably of Brittonic origin. The name may derive from &quot;*hūl&quot;, an element related to &quot;*hū-&quot; meaning &quot;boil, soak, seethe&quot; (&lt; Old Celtic *seu-; c.f. River Sill in Europe).

==Course==
The source of the River Hull is in the Yorkshire Wolds. It rises from a series of springs to the west of Driffield, near the site of the medieval village of Elmswell. The Elmswell Beck flows eastwards from these, and is joined by the Little Driffield Beck, which flows southwards from Little Driffield. It continues as the Driffield Beck, flowing around the south-western edge of Driffield, where it is joined by the Driffield Trout Stream. After the junction, it becomes the River Hull or the West Beck and flows to the east, before turning south to reach Corps Landing. For much of the route below Driffield, the Driffield Navigation runs parallel to the river.

The river from Corps Landing to its mouth is navigable. At Emmotland, it is joined by the Frodingham Beck, which is also navigable, and leads to the canal into Driffield, which forms the major part of the Driffield Navigation. Scurf Dyke joins from the west and is followed by Struncheon Hill lock, which marks the end of the Navigation, and the official start of the navigable River Hull. Below here, the river is tidal. The tidal range of tides can be up to in winter and in summer. Just above the lock, the Beverley and Barmston Drain, which collects water from the catchwater drains on either side of the main channel, flows under the navigation in a tunnel, and runs just to the west of the river almost to its mouth. Below the lock, the surrounding land is almost at sea level, and the river is constrained by flood banks on both sides.
On its route southwards, the river passes the former junction with Aike Beck, once navigable to Lockington Landing, but the stream was subsequently re-routed to join the Arram Beck. The Leven Canal used to join on the east bank, but the entrance lock has been replaced by a sluice. The Arram Beck flows in from the west, and then the river is crossed by Hull Bridge, the cause of repeated disagreement between the owners of the Driffield Navigation and the Corporation of Beverley, who owned the bridge. Just above Beverley Beck, which joins from the west, is Grovehill Bridge, now a lift bridge but once a ferry bridge.

Once the river reaches the outskirts of Hull, its course is marked by a series of bridges, most of which open to allow boats to pass. There are swing bridges, lift bridges and bascule bridges, and the river becomes part of the Port of Hull. The river, which is the dividing line between West and East Hull, bisects the city&#x27;s industrial area. The bridges can cause traffic delays during high tides, though river traffic is less than it once was. The Beverley and Barmston Drain rejoins the river above Scott Street Bridge. Below North Bridge, an unused dry dock on the west bank marks the former entrance to Queens Dock. Below Drypool Bridge, a muddy basin on the east bank was once the entrance to Drypool Basin and Victoria Dock. The river reaches its confluence with the Humber Estuary in the centre of Kingston upon Hull. At its mouth, a tidal barrier has been constructed to prevent tidal surges from entering the river. In the past, these had regularly flooded the town and the flat countryside to the north.

==History==
The River Hull has served as a navigation and a drainage channel, and has been subject to the conflicts that this usually creates, as water levels need to be raised for navigation, but lowered for efficient drainage. In 1213, the Archbishops of York laid claim to the river, and declared their right to navigate on a channel. A number of fish-weirs made navigation difficult, and the Archbishop negotiated their removal in 1296, so that a wharf could be established at Grovehill to serve the town of Beverley. By 1321, river rights had been extended to the charging of tolls. One-third of a shilling (4d equivalent to 1.7p decimal currency) was charged for each bushel carried on the river between Emmotland and the Humber, but the merchants of Hull were unhappy with this; eventually the river had free navigation, and goods could be carried on it without toll. The Arram Beck was also exempt from all tolls. It has remained free, except for from the mouth, which is part of the Port of Hull and is under the control of Hull Corporation.

The outlet of the river onto the Humber is thought to have changed in the early medieval period. The original outlet has been identified at a place called Limekiln creek. A second channel Sayers Creek was cut or widened, with both outlets existing simultaneously at one point. Limekiln creek was subsequently reduced in flow to the level of a drain.
The lower river was bordered by salt marshes in medieval times, when efforts were first made to drain them. Further upstream, channels were cut through the fens in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries by the monks of Meaux Abbey, primarily to enable travel by boat, but these gradually became part of the drainage system. John Smeaton, when asked by the merchants of Driffield to advise on ways to allow keels to reach their town, suggested a small cut of about including one lock, from the river near Wansford. The merchants sought a second opinion, and John Grundy, Jr. suggested a much longer canal, running for from Fisholme on the Frodingham Beck. When fully opened in 1770, the new route was some shorter than the river, which follows an extremely winding course in its upper reaches. The river above Aike was now considered to be part of the Driffield Navigation, and tolls were charged for its use. Also in this period the first cut of the Holderness Drain was made, enabled by an act of Parliament, the Holderness Drainage Act 1764 (4 Geo. 3. c. &quot;47&quot; ), originally outfalling onto the river. In addition to the drainage works to the east of the river, the banks were raised for on the east side, to prevent flooding.

Although beyond their jurisdiction, the navigation commissioners attempted to extend their powers, to improve the river below the junction with Aike Beck. They particularly wanted to replace the stone Hull Bridge, near Beverley, with a swing bridge, which would make it easier for keels to reach Frodingham bridge. Beverley Corporation objected, because the bridge was the main route of communication between Beverley and Holderness, and the commissioners instead dredged parts of the river to improve access. Plans to improve Hull Bridge were again resisted by Beverley Corporation in 1799, but an agreement was finally reached in 1801, and an act of Parliament, the 
Hull and Frodingham Beck Navigation Act 1801 (41 Geo. 3. (U.K.) c. cxxxiv), was obtained in July of that year. William Chapman acted as engineer, as the act authorised the construction of towpaths, a new cut between Bethels Bridge and the lock at Struncheon Hill, to avoid a long loop in the river, and rebuilding of the bridge. The bridge cost £500, half of which was met by Richard Bethell, the owner of the Leven Canal, on condition that the tolls for passing through it were reduced significantly.

Passage through Hull had long been difficult, because of the number of ships which used the river for loading and unloading goods. In 1794, the merchants of Beverley had advocated the building of docks at Hull, with a separate entrance, so that traffic to the upper river would not be impeded, while the Driffield Navigation had unsuccessful attempted to get a clause inserted into the act of Parliament which the Hull Dock Company obtained in 1840, to ensure free passage for vessels, and the removal of tolls for boats not using the docks. The navigation company also received complaints from the Beverley and Barmston Drainage Commissioners, who believed that water levels were being kept at a higher level than was good for drainage.

In 1980, the Environment Agency constructed a tidal barrier at the mouth of the river. The structure spans the river, and a huge steel gate, weighing 202 tonnes, can be lowered into the waterway, effectively sealing the river from the Humber, and preventing tidal surges from moving up the river and flooding parts of the city and the low-lying areas beyond. The gate was initially lowered about twelve times a year, and protects around 17,000 properties. In 2009, a £10 million upgrade of the structure was started, to ensure it would stay operational for a further 30 years. The upgrade included a new drive mechanism, which raises and lowers the gate, and pivots it when it is at the top of the structure, so that it lies horizontally rather than vertically. It also included a new control system. In July 2017 the barrier was granted Grade II listed status. Plans have been considered to build a barrage at the mouth of the Hull where it joins the Humber Estuary to maintain a constant water level as it passes through the city. The idea was first raised by the &quot;Abercrombie report&quot;, which considered how to redevelop Hull after significant destruction during the Second World War. The estimated cost of such a project was around £195 million in 2007.

==Traffic==

Because the river was a free river, there are no figures for traffic on the lower river. However, it connected to a number of waterways on which tolls were collected, and so an indication of the traffic can be gained from the figures for these waterways. The main cargoes on Beverley Beck in 1730 were coal, bricks, turfs and wool, together with cereal crops, consisting of wheat, barley, oats and malt. Receipts from tolls more than doubled between 1732 and 1748, after which the tolls were let to an independent collector. The annual rent charged for this privilege doubled again between 1748 and 1792. There was a steady expansion of trade on the Driffield Navigation during the same period, as the dividends paid to shareholders rose from 1.5 to 4 per cent. In 1789, Bainton, Boyes and Co negotiated a lump sum payment to cover coal from the Aire and Calder Navigation to their new carpet factory and the export of their carpets in the downstream direction. The factory later became a corn mill.

Toll rentals continued to increase on the Beverley Beck, rising from £190 to £435 between 1793 and 1835. Some 31,185 tons of cargo were carried in 1838.
In 1817, a steam packet service started to run between Driffield and Hull. Three return trips each week were made, but the journey times were too long, and an advertisement in 1825 indicated that the engine had been altered and an express steam packet service would commence. Three boats were recorded as trading between Driffield and Hull every other day in a directory of Yorkshire published in 1823. Traffic for 1832 included 7,394 chaldrons of coal, 18,173 quarters of wheat, 7,745 quarters of oats, 19,396 quarters of barley and 4,555 sacks of flour. An additional 1,564 quarters of wheat and 8,194 sacks of flour were carried to or from Foston Mill, reached from Frodingham Beck. A regular carrier also operated between the Leven Canal and Hull once a week.

Between 1848 and 1905, traffic on Beverley Beck more than trebled, from 33,498 tons to 101,540 tons. Coal and other minerals accounted for around one quarter of the traffic in 1905, while goods carried in 1906 included fertiliser, burnt ore, flour and scrap metal. Commercial traffic continued into the 1970s, when tolls of £2,365 were collected on 28,169 tons of cargo. Traffic on the Driffield Navigation was relatively steady between 1871 and 1905, falling slightly from 35,654 to 32,666 tons. Goods carried included coal, linseed, cottonseed, wheat, flour and artificial manures. In 1922, £7 of income was received from pleasure craft using the navigation. Traffic declined during the 1930s, with commercial traffic finally ceasing in 1944. The Leven Canal carried 4,242 tons in 1888 and 4,546 in 1905, but then succumbed to road competition, and closed in 1935.

==Drainage==

The problems of flooding of the land adjacent to the river were addressed by the construction of catchwater drains to both sides of it. The east side of the river was protected by the Holderness Drainage scheme. John Grundy worked on plans for the scheme which would protect of low-lying land to the north-east of Hull. John Smeaton was also involved, although the final report was largely Grundy&#x27;s work, and an Act of Parliament to authorise the work was passed on 5 April 1764. The Trustees for the scheme wrote to Grundy and Smeaton in May 1764, asking them to work on the project. Grundy&#x27;s wife had died only a fortnight previously, and the two engineers corresponded, but besides valuable comment on Grundy&#x27;s plans for the outfall sluice, Smeaton had no further involvement, and it was Grundy who ran the project, which included of barrier bank along the east side of the river. John Hoggard acted as Superintendent for the scheme, while Joseph Page was appointed as resident engineer, to oversee the construction of the drains and the outfall sluice. Grundy made regular visits until October 1767, by which time the sluice and the main drainage channels were completed, at which point he and Page moved on, while Hoggard oversaw additional work on the drains and banks, which lasted for several more years. By the time of its completion in 1772, the scheme had cost £24,000.

Despite the Holderness scheme, there were still problems near Leven and Weel, and William Jessop spent a month inspecting the area before writing a report in July 1786. His plan advocated separating the water which fell on the uplands to the north and flowed through the low-lying areas, from the local drainage of those low-lying areas. George Plummer carried out most of the subsequent survey work on Jessop&#x27;s behalf, although Jessop surveyed the River Hull in 1787, to identify how the outfall could be improved. Jessop visited the works from time to time, making seven visits between 1789 and 1792, while the day to day oversight of the scheme was handled by Plummer as resident engineer. Plummer was succeeded by Anthony Bower, who was engineer from 1792 to 1795, and the whole scheme was completed in 1805, having cost £16,000.

In 1796, Robert Chapman was asked to report on possible solutions for flooding to the west. His report formed the basis for the Beverley and Barmston Drainage Act, which was passed by Parliament in June 1798. Chapman was appointed as engineer for the scheme, which would cost £115,000, and would provide flood defences and drainage for of land to the west of the river. The project included the construction of of drainage cuts, and building embankments along of the river. At Hull, an outfall sluice was constructed, and the drain passed through tunnels under eleven waterways, including the Beverley Beck. 27 bridges were built to carry roads over the drain, and the whole project was finished in 1810.
==River crossings==
There are several bridges in the Hull area which cross the River Hull. Details of them are shown in the following table, starting from that furthest north and moving south to the river mouth.
The present Drypool Bridge was designed by W. Morris, the Hull City Engineer, and it was built in Hull. The previous wrought iron swing bridge, which had opened in 1888, was too narrow, with a carriageway which was wide. It was closed in May 1959, so that it could be demolished and Morris&#x27;s new bridge opened in March 1961.

Scott Street Bridge had gradually deteriorated, and a public consultation was held in 1986, to determine its future. By that time a 10-ton weight limit had been imposed on traffic using the bridge, because of its poor structural state. Three suggestions were made as to its future. These were to close and demolish it, to refurbish it at an estimated cost of £1.6 million, and to build a new bridge on the same site but a different alignment, to eliminate the awkward turn at the west end, which was costed at £2 million. None of these actions have been taken, as the bridge leaves were raised in 1994, and have remained raised ever since. Consideration was given in 2007 to preserving two of the hydraulic rams which operated the bridge, during planning to demolish the structure. The Hull Hydraulic Power Company was set up in 1872, and by 1876 was operating a pumping station on Machell Street. This supplied water to a high pressure main which ran from Wellington Street to Sculcoates Bridge, and was used by local industries to power machinery, including the bridge when it was constructed. Although the power company closed in the 1940s, it made Hull the first city in the world to have a public system of power distribution.
The design for the Ennerdale Link road included a tunnel under the river. Initial investigations suggested that there was a layer of boulder clay below the alluvium of the river bed, and that a chalk aquifer was below the clay. Construction work started in July 1991. A cofferdam was built on the east bank, and the cutting which would have provided access to the twin-bore tunnel was nearly excavated when a hole appeared in the river bed, and the entire site flooded. A 3-month investigation took place, which suggested that it would be difficult to finish the tunnel and maintain the integrity of the aquifer. Despite some £10 million having been spent on the project, it was abandoned in 1993. A contract for a replacement bridge was awarded in June 1995 and the river was crossed by twin lift bridges, which were opened in April 1997. The project had cost £30 million, compared to an original budget of just £13 million.

A tunnel was successfully constructed under the river in 2001. The long sewer runs from the city centre to a treatment works at Salt End. It was excavated using two tunnelling machines, which were manufactured in Canada and were named &quot;Maureen&quot; and &quot;Gloria&quot;. The tunnel was officially opened on 21 August 2001, when a Mini car was driven through it, recreating scenes from the film &quot;The Italian Job&quot;.
Before 1897, there had been a ferry at Grovehill, and a shipyard on the east bank, owned by Joseph Scarr. To assist his workers to reach the shipyard, Scarr designed and built a ferry bridge, which cost him £300. It consisted of a large rectangular pontoon, above which was fitted a bridge deck with handrails. Two jack screws enabled the deck to be raised or lowered in relation to the pontoon, so that it remained at approximately the same height, whatever the state of the tide. On the eastern bank, Scarr constructed a variable-height landing, but the landing on the west bank was constructed by Beverley Council, and was fixed. Scarr campaigned to have a variable landing here as well, and was prepared to fund it, but his requests were always rejected. The fixed landing made access to the bridge difficult at high tides. When a boat needed to pass, the west end was freed, and the pontoon swung round to lie parallel to the bank, either upstream or downstream, depending on the state of the tide. It would then be winched back into position by a small barrel winch. At night the bridge was closed and moored beside the bank.

Responsibility for the bridge was taken over by Beverley Council before the Second World War. Its condition deteriorated, and in 1948, they attempted to replace it with a footbridge around further upstream. Because the ferry rights had been in existence for more than 600 years, an Act of Parliament was needed, and this was thwarted by a petition containing 84 signatures, presented by the people of Weel to the House of Lords. Plans for a new lift bridge were drawn up, and it was opened on 19 October 1953.

In 1913, the Hull Bridge upstream of Beverley, which had caused so much disagreement in the 18th century until it had been replaced in 1801, was demolished by the County Council, who installed a steel rolling bridge in its place. Once the Tickton Bypass bridge had been built a short distance upstream, it no longer needed to carry road traffic, and it was replaced by a footbridge in 1976.

At the other end of the river, the Millennium Bridge was opened in 2001. There was once a ferry at this point, before 1865, which gave access to the Victoria Dock, opened in 1850. South Bridge replaced the ferry in 1865, making it easier for workers to reach the dock. The swing footbridge was closed in 1934, but was not demolished until 1944.

==Water quality==
The Environment Agency measure the water quality of the river systems in England. Each is given an overall ecological status, which may be one of five levels: high, good, moderate, poor and bad. There are several components that are used to determine this, including biological status, which looks at the quantity and varieties of invertebrates, angiosperms and fish. Chemical status, which compares the concentrations of various chemicals against known safe concentrations, is rated good or fail.

The water quality of the River Hull system was as follows in 2016.
The reasons for the quality being less than good include sewage discharge and physical modification of the channel.

<doc id="153661" wikidata="Q431066" url="?curid=153661" title="Robert of Jumièges">
<text>Robert of Jumièges (died between 1052 and 1055) was the first Norman Archbishop of Canterbury. He had previously served as prior of the Abbey of St Ouen at Rouen in Normandy, before becoming abbot of Jumièges Abbey, near Rouen, in 1037. He was a good friend and adviser to the king of England, Edward the Confessor, who appointed him bishop of London in 1044, and then archbishop in 1051. Robert&#x27;s time as archbishop lasted only about eighteen months. He had already come into conflict with the powerful Earl Godwin and, while archbishop, made attempts to recover lands lost to Godwin and his family. He also refused to consecrate Spearhafoc, Edward&#x27;s choice to succeed Robert as Bishop of London. The rift between Robert and Godwin culminated in Robert&#x27;s deposition and exile in 1052.

A Norman medieval chronicler claimed that Robert travelled to Normandy in 1051 or 1052 and told Duke William of Normandy that Edward wished for him to become his heir. The exact timing of Robert&#x27;s trip, and whether he actually made it, have been the subject of debate among historians. The archbishop died in exile at Jumièges sometime between 1052 and 1055. Robert commissioned significant building work at Jumièges and was probably involved in the first Romanesque building in England, the church built in Westminster for Edward the Confessor, now known as Westminster Abbey. Robert&#x27;s treatment by the English was used by William as one of the justifications for his invasion of England.

==Background and life in Normandy==

Robert was prior of the monastery of St Ouen at Rouen before he became abbot of the important Jumièges Abbey in 1037. Jumièges had been refounded under the Norman ruler William Longsword around 940. Its ties with the ducal family were close and it played a role in ducal government and church reform. Robert&#x27;s alternate surname &quot;Champart&quot; or &quot;Chambert&quot; probably derived from champart, a term for the part of a crop paid as rent to a landlord. Besides evidence that the preceding abbot at Jumièges was a relative, Robert&#x27;s origin and family background are otherwise unknown. While abbot, Robert began construction of the abbey church, in the new Romanesque style.

Robert became friendly with Edward the Confessor, a claimant to the English throne, while Edward was living in exile in Normandy, probably in the 1030s. Edward was the son of Æthelred the Unready, king of England, who had been replaced by Cnut the Great in 1016. Cnut subsequently married Æthelred&#x27;s widow Emma of Normandy, Edward&#x27;s mother, and had a son with her, Harthacanute. For their own safety, Edward and his brother Alfred were sent to Emma&#x27;s relatives in Normandy. After Cnut&#x27;s death in 1035, Harold Harefoot, his elder son by his first wife, acceded to the English throne. Following Harald&#x27;s death in 1040, Harthacanute succeeded him for a short time, but as neither Harald nor Harthacanute left offspring, the throne was offered to Edward on Harthacanute&#x27;s death in 1042. There is some evidence that Edward spent some of his time in exile around Jumièges, as after becoming king he gave gifts to the abbey.

==Bishop and archbishop==
Robert accompanied Edward the Confessor on Edward&#x27;s recall to England in 1042 to become king following Harthacanute&#x27;s death. It was due to Edward that in August 1044 Robert was appointed Bishop of London, one of the first episcopal vacancies which occurred in Edward&#x27;s reign. Robert remained close to the king and was the leader of the party opposed to Earl Godwin, Earl of Wessex. Godwin, for his part, was attempting to expand the influence of his family, which had already acquired much land. His daughter was Edward&#x27;s queen, and two of his sons were elevated to earldoms. The &quot;Life of Saint Edward&quot;, a hagiographical work on King Edward&#x27;s life, claimed that Robert &quot;was always the most powerful confidential adviser of the king&quot;. Robert seems to have favoured closer relations with Normandy, and its duke. Edward himself had grown up in the duchy, and spent 25 years in exile there before his return to England. He brought many Normans with him to England, and seems to have spent much time in their company.

When Archbishop Eadsige of Canterbury died in October 1050, the post remained vacant for five months. The cathedral chapter elected Æthelric, a kinsman of Godwin and a monk at Canterbury, but were over-ruled when Edward appointed Robert Archbishop of Canterbury the following year. Godwin was attempting to exercise his power of patronage over the archbishopric, but the king&#x27;s appointment signalled that the king was willing to contest with the earl over the traditional royal rights at Canterbury. Although the monks of Canterbury opposed it, the king&#x27;s appointment stood. Robert went to Rome to receive his pallium and returned to England where he was ceremonially enthroned at Canterbury on 29 June 1051. Some Norman chroniclers state that he visited Normandy on this trip and informed Duke William the Bastard that he was the childless King Edward&#x27;s heir. According to these chroniclers, the decision to make William the heir had been decided at the same lenten royal council in 1051 that had declared Robert archbishop.

After returning from Rome, Robert refused to consecrate Spearhafoc, the Abbot of Abingdon and the king&#x27;s goldsmith, as his successor to the bishopric of London, claiming that Pope Leo IX had forbidden the consecration. Almost certainly the grounds were simony, the purchase of ecclesiastical office, as Leo had recently issued proclamations against the practice. In refusing to consecrate Spearhafoc, Robert may have been following his own interests against the wishes of both the king and Godwin, as he had his own candidate, a Norman, in mind. In the end Robert&#x27;s favoured candidate, William the Norman, was consecrated instead of Spearhafoc. Robert also discovered that some lands belonging to Canterbury had fallen into Godwin&#x27;s hands, but his efforts to recover them through the shire courts were unsuccessful. Canterbury had lost control of some revenues from the shire of Kent to Godwin during Eadsige&#x27;s tenure as archbishop, which Robert unsuccessfully attempted to reclaim. These disputes over the estates and revenues of the archbishopric contributed to the friction between Robert and Godwin, which had begun with Robert&#x27;s election. Robert&#x27;s election had disrupted Godwin&#x27;s patronage powers in Canterbury, and now Robert&#x27;s efforts to recover lands Godwin had seized from Canterbury challenged the earl&#x27;s economic rights. Events came to a head at a council held at Gloucester in September 1051, when Robert accused Earl Godwin of plotting to kill King Edward. Godwin and his family were exiled; afterwards Robert claimed the office of sheriff of Kent, probably on the strength of Eadsige, his predecessor as archbishop, having held the office.

Although Robert refused to consecrate Spearhafoc, there is little evidence that he was interested in the growing movement towards Church reform being promulgated by the papacy. Pope Leo IX was beginning a reform movement later known as the Gregorian Reform, initially focused on improving the clergy and prohibiting simony. In 1049 Leo IX declared that he would take more interest in English church matters and would investigate episcopal candidates more strictly before confirming them. It may have been partly to appease Leo that Edward appointed Robert instead of Æthelric, hoping to signal to the papacy that the English crown was not totally opposed to the growing reform movement. It was against this backdrop that Robert refused to consecrate Spearhafoc, although there is no other evidence that Robert embraced the reform position, and his claim that the pope forbade the consecration may have had more to do with finding an easy excuse than any true desire for reform. There are also some indications that Spearhafoc was allied to Godwin, and his appointment was meant as a &quot;quid pro quo&quot; for the non-appointment of Æthelric. If true, Robert&#x27;s refusal to consecrate Spearhafoc would have contributed to the growing rift between the archbishop and the earl.

==Royal adviser==

The &quot;Life of Saint Edward&quot; claims that while Godwin was in exile Robert tried to persuade King Edward to divorce Edith, Godwin&#x27;s daughter, but Edward refused and instead she was sent to a nunnery. However, the &quot;Life&quot; is a hagiography, written soon after Edward&#x27;s death to show Edward as a saint. Thus it stresses that Edward voluntarily remained celibate, something unlikely to have been true and not corroborated by any other source. Modern historians have felt it more likely that Edward, at Robert&#x27;s urging, wished to divorce Edith and remarry to have children to succeed him on the English throne, although it is possible that he merely wished to be rid of her, without necessarily wanting a divorce.

During Godwin&#x27;s exile, Robert is said to have been sent by the king on an errand to Duke William of Normandy. The reason for the embassy is uncertain. William of Jumièges says that Robert went to tell Duke William that Edward wished William to be his heir. The medieval writer William of Poitiers gives the same reason, but also adds that Robert took with him as hostages Godwin&#x27;s son Wulfnoth and grandson Hakon (son of Sweyn). The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; is silent on the visit however, so it is uncertain whether Robert visited Normandy or not, or why he did so. The entire history of the various missions which Robert is alleged to have made is confused, and complicated by propaganda claims made by Norman chroniclers after the Norman Conquest in 1066, leaving it unclear if Robert visited Normandy on his way to receive his pallium or after Godwin was in exile, or if he went twice or not at all.

==Outlawing, death, and legacy==
After Godwin left England, he went to Flanders, and gathered a fleet and mercenaries to force the king to allow his return. In the summer of 1052, Godwin returned to England and was met by his sons, who had invaded from Ireland. By September, they were advancing on London, where negotiations between the king and the earl were conducted with the help of Stigand, the Bishop of Winchester. When it became apparent that Godwin would be returning, Robert quickly left England with Bishop Ulf of Dorchester and Bishop William of London, probably once again taking Wulfnoth and Hakon with him as hostages, whether with the permission of King Edward or not. Robert was declared an outlaw and deposed from his archbishopric on 14 September 1052 at a royal council, mainly because the returning Godwin felt that Robert, along with a number of other Normans, had been the driving force behind his exile. Robert journeyed to Rome to complain to the pope about his own exile, where Leo IX and successive popes condemned Stigand, whom Edward had appointed to Canterbury. Robert&#x27;s personal property was divided between Earl Godwin, Harold Godwinson, and the queen, who had returned to court.

Robert died at Jumièges, but the date of his death is unclear. Various dates are given, with Ian Walker, the biographer of Harold arguing for between 1053 and 1055, but H. E. J. Cowdrey, who wrote Robert&#x27;s &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot; entry, says on 26 May in either 1052 or 1055. H. R. Loyn, another modern historian, argues that it is likely that he died in 1053.

Robert&#x27;s treatment was used by William as one of the justifications for his invasion of England, the other being that Edward had named William his heir. Ian Walker, author of the most recent scholarly biography of Harold Godwinson, suggests that it was Robert, while in exile after the return of Godwin, who testified that King Edward had nominated Duke William to be Edward&#x27;s heir. However, this view is contradicted by David Douglas, a historian and biographer of William the Conqueror, who believes that Robert merely relayed Edward&#x27;s decision, probably while Robert was on his way to Rome to receive his pallium. Several medieval chroniclers, including the author of the &quot;Life of Saint Edward&quot;, felt that the blame for Edward and Godwin&#x27;s conflict in 1051–1052 lay squarely with Robert; modern historians tend to see Robert as an ambitious man, with little political skill.

==Artistic patronage==
In notable contrast to his successor Stigand, Robert does not figure among the important benefactors to English churches, but we know of some transfers to Jumièges of important English church treasures, the first trickle of what was to become a flood of treasure taken to Normandy after the Conquest. These included the relic of the head of Saint Valentine only recently given to the monks of Winchester Cathedral by Emma of Normandy. Though the Winchester head remained in place, another one appeared at Jumièges; he &quot;must have clandestinely removed the head, or at least the greater part of it, and left his monks to venerate the empty or nearly empty &quot;capsa&quot;&quot;. Two of the four most important surviving late Anglo-Saxon illuminated manuscripts went the same way, thus probably preventing their destruction in a series of fires that devastated the major English libraries. One is the so-called &#x27;, actually a sacramentary with thirteen surviving full-page miniatures, which bears an inscription apparently in Robert&#x27;s own hand recording its donation to Jumièges when he was Bishop of London, and the other the so-called &#x27;, actually a pontifical with three remaining full-page miniatures and other decoration (respectively Rouen, Bibliothèque Municipale, Manuscripts Y.6 and Y.7). The latter may well have been commissioned by Æthelgar, Robert&#x27;s predecessor as archbishop in 988–90, although it is possible the &quot;Archbishop Robert&quot; of the traditional name is Emma&#x27;s brother Robert, Archbishop of Rouen from 990 to 1037. These masterpieces of the Winchester style were the most elaborately decorated Anglo-Saxon manuscripts known to have reached Normandy, either before or after the Conquest, and influenced the much less-developed local style, though this remained very largely restricted to initials.

Before he came to England, Robert had begun the construction of a new abbey church at Jumièges, in the new Romanesque style which was then becoming popular, and introduced to Normandy the two-towered western facade from the Rhineland. On his return to Normandy he continued to build there, and the abbey church was not finished until 1067. Although the choir has been torn down, the towers, nave and transepts have survived. Robert probably influenced Edward the Confessor&#x27;s rebuilding of the church at Westminster Abbey, the first known building in the Romanesque style in England, which is so described by William of Malmesbury. Edward&#x27;s work began in about 1050 and was completed just before his death in 1065. The recorded name of one of the senior masons, &quot;Teinfrith the churchwright&quot; indicates foreign origins, and Robert may have arranged for Norman masons to be brought over, though other names are English. It is possible that Westminster influenced the building at Jumièges, as the arcade there closely resembles Westminster&#x27;s arcade, both of them in a style that never became common in Normandy. The Early Romanesque style of both was to be superseded after the Conquest by the Anglo-Norman High Romanesque style pioneered in Canterbury Cathedral and St Étienne, Caen by Lanfranc.

<text>Cytokines () are a broad and loose category of small proteins (~5–25 kDa) important in cell signaling. Due to their size, cytokines cannot cross the lipid bilayer of cells to enter the cytoplasm and therefore typically exert their functions by interacting with specific cytokine receptors on the target cell surface. Cytokines have been shown to be involved in autocrine, paracrine and endocrine signaling as immunomodulating agents. 

Cytokines include chemokines, interferons, interleukins, lymphokines, and tumour necrosis factors, but generally not hormones or growth factors (despite some overlap in the terminology). Cytokines are produced by a broad range of cells, including immune cells like macrophages, B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes and mast cells, as well as endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and various stromal cells; a given cytokine may be produced by more than one type of cell. They act through cell surface receptors and are especially important in the immune system; cytokines modulate the balance between humoral and cell-based immune responses, and they regulate the maturation, growth, and responsiveness of particular cell populations. Some cytokines enhance or inhibit the action of other cytokines in complex ways. They are different from hormones, which are also important cell signaling molecules. Hormones circulate in higher concentrations, and tend to be made by specific kinds of cells. Cytokines are important in health and disease, specifically in host immune responses to infection, inflammation, trauma, sepsis, cancer, and reproduction.

The word comes from the ancient Greek language: &quot;cyto&quot;, from Greek κύτος, &quot;kytos&quot;, &#x27;cavity, cell&#x27; + &quot;kines&quot;, from Greek κίνησις, &quot;kinēsis&quot;, &#x27;movement&#x27;.

== Discovery ==

Interferon-alpha, an interferon type I, was identified in 1957 as a protein that interfered with viral replication. The activity of interferon-gamma (the sole member of the interferon type II class) was described in 1965; this was the first identified lymphocyte-derived mediator. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) was identified simultaneously in 1966 by John David and Barry Bloom.

In 1969, Dudley Dumonde proposed the term &quot;lymphokine&quot; to describe proteins secreted from lymphocytes and later, proteins derived from macrophages and monocytes in culture were called &quot;monokines&quot;. In 1974, pathologist Stanley Cohen, M.D. (not to be confused with the Nobel laureate named Stanley Cohen, who was a PhD biochemist; nor with the MD geneticist Stanley Norman Cohen) published an article describing the production of MIF in virus-infected allantoic membrane and kidney cells, showing its production is not limited to immune cells. This led to his proposal of the term cytokine. In 1993, Ogawa described the early acting growth factors, intermediate acting growth factors and late acting growth factors.

==Difference from hormones==
Classic hormones circulate in aqueous solution in nanomolar (10 M) concentrations that usually vary by less than one order of magnitude. In contrast, some cytokines (such as IL-6) circulate in picomolar (10 M) concentrations that can increase up to 1,000 times during trauma or infection. The widespread distribution of cellular sources for cytokines may be a feature that differentiates them from hormones. Virtually all nucleated cells, but especially endo/epithelial cells and resident macrophages (many near the interface with the external environment) are potent producers of IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α. In contrast, classic hormones, such as insulin, are secreted from discrete glands such as the pancreas. The current terminology refers to cytokines as immunomodulating agents.

A contributing factor to the difficulty of distinguishing cytokines from hormones is that some immunomodulating effects of cytokines are systemic (&quot;i.e.&quot;, affecting the whole organism) rather than local. For instance, to accurately utilize hormone terminology, cytokines may be autocrine or paracrine in nature, and chemotaxis, chemokinesis and endocrine as a pyrogen. Essentially, cytokines are not limited to their immunomodulatory status as molecules.
== Nomenclature ==
Cytokines have been classed as lymphokines, interleukins, and chemokines, based on their presumed cell of secretion, function, or target of action. Because cytokines are characterised by considerable redundancy and pleiotropism, such distinctions, allowing for exceptions, are obsolete.

* The term &quot;interleukin&quot; was initially used by researchers for those cytokines whose presumed targets are principally white blood cells (leukocytes). It is now used largely for designation of newer cytokine molecules and bears little relation to their presumed function. The vast majority of these are produced by T-helper cells.
* &quot;Lymphokines&quot;: produced by lymphocytes
* &quot;Monokines&quot;: produced exclusively by monocytes
* &quot;Interferons&quot;: involved in antiviral responses
* &quot;Colony stimulating factors&quot;: support the growth of cells in semisolid media
* &quot;Chemokines&quot;: mediate chemoattraction (chemotaxis) between cells.

== Classification ==

=== Structural ===
Structural homogeneity has been able to partially distinguish between cytokines that do not demonstrate a considerable degree of redundancy so that they can be classified into four types:

*The four-α-helix bundle family (): member cytokines have three-dimensional structures with a bundle of four α-helices. This family, in turn, is divided into three sub-families:
# the IL-2 subfamily. This is the largest family. It contains several non-immunological cytokines including erythropoietin (EPO) and thrombopoietin (TPO). They can be grouped into &quot;long-chain&quot; and &quot;short-chain&quot; cytokines by topology. Some members share the common gamma chain as part of their receptor.
# the interferon (IFN) subfamily.
# the IL-10 subfamily.
*The IL-1 family, which primarily includes IL-1 and IL-18.
* The cysteine knot cytokines () include members of the transforming growth factor beta superfamily, including TGF-β1, TGF-β2 and TGF-β3.
* The IL-17 family, which has yet to be completely characterized, though member cytokines have a specific effect in promoting proliferation of T-cells that have cytotoxic effects.

=== Functional ===
A classification that proves more useful in clinical and experimental practice outside of structural biology divides immunological cytokines into those that enhance cellular immune responses, type 1 (TNFα, IFN-γ, etc.), and those that enhance antibody responses, type 2 (TGF-β, IL-4, IL-10, IL-13, etc.). A key focus of interest has been that cytokines in one of these two sub-sets tend to inhibit the effects of those in the other. Dysregulation of this tendency is under intensive study for its possible role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disorders. Several inflammatory cytokines are induced by oxidative stress. The fact that cytokines themselves trigger the release of other cytokines and lead to increased oxidative stress makes them important in chronic inflammation, as well as other immunoresponses, such as fever and acute phase proteins of the liver (IL-1,6,12, IFN-a). Cytokines also play a role in anti-inflammatory pathways and are a possible therapeutic treatment for pathological pain from inflammation or peripheral nerve injury. There are both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines that regulate this pathway.

== Receptors ==

In recent years, the cytokine receptors have come to demand the attention of more investigators than cytokines themselves, partly because of their remarkable characteristics and partly because a deficiency of cytokine receptors has now been directly linked to certain debilitating immunodeficiency states. In this regard, and also because the redundancy and pleomorphism of cytokines are, in fact, a consequence of their homologous receptors, many authorities think that a classification of cytokine receptors would be more clinically and experimentally useful.

A classification of cytokine receptors based on their three-dimensional structure has, therefore, been attempted. Such a classification, though seemingly cumbersome, provides several unique perspectives for attractive pharmacotherapeutic targets.

* Immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily, which are ubiquitously present throughout several cells and tissues of the vertebrate body, and share structural homology with immunoglobulins (antibodies), cell adhesion molecules, and even some cytokines. Examples: IL-1 receptor types.
* Hemopoietic Growth Factor (type 1) family, whose members have certain conserved motifs in their extracellular amino-acid domain. The IL-2 receptor belongs to this chain, whose γ-chain (common to several other cytokines) deficiency is directly responsible for the x-linked form of Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (X-SCID).
* Interferon (type 2) family, whose members are receptors for IFN β and γ.
* Tumor necrosis factors (TNF) (type 3) family, whose members share a cysteine-rich common extracellular binding domain, and includes several other non-cytokine ligands like CD40, CD27 and CD30, besides the ligands on which the family is named.
* Seven transmembrane helix family, the ubiquitous receptor type of the animal kingdom. All G protein-coupled receptors (for hormones and neurotransmitters) belong to this family. Chemokine receptors, two of which act as binding proteins for HIV (CD4 and CCR5), also belong to this family.
* Interleukin-17 receptor (IL-17R) family, which shows little homology with any other cytokine receptor family. Structural motifs conserved between members of this family include: an extracellular fibronectin III-like domain, a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic SERIF domain. The known members of this family are as follows: IL-17RA, IL-17RB, IL-17RC, IL17RD and IL-17RE.

== Cellular effects ==
Each cytokine has a matching cell-surface receptor. Subsequent cascades of intracellular signaling then alter cell functions. This may include the upregulation and/or downregulation of several genes and their transcription factors, resulting in the production of other cytokines, an increase in the number of surface receptors for other molecules, or the suppression of their own effect by feedback inhibition. The effect of a particular cytokine on a given cell depends on the cytokine, its extracellular abundance, the presence and abundance of the complementary receptor on the cell surface, and downstream signals activated by receptor binding; these last two factors can vary by cell type. Cytokines are characterized by considerable redundancy, in that many cytokines appear to share similar functions. It seems to be a paradox that cytokines binding to antibodies have a stronger immune effect than the cytokine alone. This may lead to lower therapeutic doses.

It has been shown that inflammatory cytokines cause an IL-10-dependent inhibition of T-cell expansion and function by up-regulating PD-1 levels on monocytes, which leads to IL-10 production by monocytes after binding of PD-1 by PD-L. Adverse reactions to cytokines are characterized by local inflammation and/or ulceration at the injection sites. Occasionally such reactions are seen with more widespread papular eruptions.

==Roles in health and disease==
Cytokines are involved in several developmental processes during embryonic development. Cytokines are released from the blastocyst, and are also expressed in the endometrium, and have critical roles in the stages of zona hatching, and implantation. Cytokines are crucial for fighting off infections and in other immune responses. However, they can become dysregulated and pathological in inflammation, trauma, sepsis, and hemorrhagic stroke. Dysregulated cytokine secretion in the aged population can lead to inflammaging, and render these individuals more vulnerable to age-related diseases like neurodegenerative diseases and type 2 diabetes.

A 2019 review was inconclusive as to whether cytokines play any definitive role in ME/CFS.

A 2024 study found a positive correlation between plasma interleukin IL-2 and fatigue in patients with type 1 narcolepsy.

Autoantibodies against cytokines also plays a role in health and disease. In 2020 neutralizing autoantibodies against type I interferons were reported in 10.2% of patients with life-threatening COVID-19.

==Adverse effects==

Adverse effects of cytokines have been linked to many disease states and conditions ranging from schizophrenia, major depression and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease to cancer. T regulatory cells (Tregs) and related-cytokines are effectively engaged in the process of tumor immune escape and functionally inhibit immune response against the tumor. Forkhead box protein 3 (Foxp3) as a transcription factor is an essential molecular marker of Treg cells. Foxp3 polymorphism (rs3761548) might be involved in cancer progression like gastric cancer through influencing Tregs function and the secretion of immunomodulatory cytokines such as IL-10, IL-35, and TGF-β. 
Normal tissue integrity is preserved by feedback interactions between diverse cell types mediated by adhesion molecules and secreted cytokines; disruption of normal feedback mechanisms in cancer threatens tissue integrity.

Over-secretion of cytokines can trigger a dangerous cytokine storm syndrome. Cytokine storms may have been the cause of severe adverse events during a clinical trial of TGN1412. Cytokine storms are also suspected to have been the main cause of death in the 1918 &quot;Spanish Flu&quot; pandemic. Deaths were weighted more heavily towards people with healthy immune systems, because of their ability to produce stronger immune responses, with dramatic increases in cytokine levels. Another example of cytokine storm is seen in acute pancreatitis. Cytokines are integral and implicated in all angles of the cascade, resulting in the systemic inflammatory response syndrome and multi-organ failure associated with this intra-abdominal catastrophe. In the COVID-19 pandemic, some deaths from COVID-19 have been attributable to cytokine release storms. Current data suggest cytokine storms may be the source of extensive lung tissue damage and dysfunctional coagulation in COVID-19 infections.

==Medical use as drugs==

Some cytokines have been developed into protein therapeutics using recombinant DNA technology. Recombinant cytokines being used as drugs as of 2014 include:
* Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), used to treat bone-related conditions
* Erythropoietin (EPO), used to treat anemia
* Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), used to treat neutropenia in cancer patients
* Granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), used to treat neutropenia and fungal infections in cancer patients
* Interferon alfa, used to treat hepatitis C and multiple sclerosis
* Interferon beta, used to treat multiple sclerosis
* Interleukin 2 (IL-2), used to treat cancer. 
* Interleukin 11 (IL-11), used to treat thrombocytopenia in cancer patients.
* Interferon gamma is used to treat chronic granulomatous disease and osteopetrosis

<doc id="153664" wikidata="Q620877" url="?curid=153664" title="Hubert Walter">
<text>Hubert Walter ( – 13 July 1205) was an influential royal adviser in the late twelfth and early thirteenth centuries in the positions of Chief Justiciar of England, Archbishop of Canterbury, and Lord Chancellor. As chancellor, Walter began the keeping of the Charter Roll, a record of all charters issued by the chancery. Walter was not noted for his holiness in life or learning, but historians have judged him one of the most outstanding government ministers in English history.

Walter owed his early advancement to his uncle Ranulf de Glanvill, who helped him become a clerk of the Exchequer. Walter served King Henry II of England in many ways, not just in financial administration, but also including diplomatic and judicial efforts. After an unsuccessful candidacy to the see of York, Walter was elected Bishop of Salisbury shortly after the accession of Henry&#x27;s son .

Walter accompanied Richard on the Third Crusade, and was one of the principals involved in raising Richard&#x27;s ransom after the king was captured in Germany on his return from the Holy Land. As a reward for his faithful service, Walter was selected to become Archbishop of Canterbury in 1193. He also served as Richard&#x27;s justiciar until 1198, in which role he was responsible for raising the money Richard needed to prosecute his wars in France. Walter set up a system that was the precursor for the modern justices of the peace, based on selecting four knights in each hundred to administer justice. He also revived his predecessor&#x27;s dispute over setting up a church to rival Christ Church Priory in Canterbury, which was only settled when the pope ordered him to abandon the plan. Following Richard&#x27;s death in 1199, Walter helped assure the elevation of Richard&#x27;s brother John to the throne. Walter also served John as a diplomat, undertaking several missions to France.

==Early life==
Hubert Walter was the son of Hervey Walter and his wife Maud de Valoignes, one of the daughters (and co-heiresses) of Theobald de Valoignes, who was lord of Parham in Suffolk. Walter was one of six brothers. The eldest brother, Theobald Walter, and Walter himself, were helped in their careers by their uncle, Ranulf de Glanvill. Glanvill was the chief justiciar for Henry II; and was married to Maud de Valoignes&#x27; sister, Bertha. Walter&#x27;s father and paternal grandfather held lands in Suffolk and Norfolk, which were inherited by Theobald. A younger brother, Osbert, became a royal justice and died in 1206. Roger, Hamo (or Hamon) and Bartholomew only appear as witnesses to charters.

Walter&#x27;s family was from West Dereham in Norfolk, which is probably where Walter was born. Walter first appears in Glanvill&#x27;s household in a charter that has been dated to 1178, although as it is undated it may have been written as late as 1180. His brother Theobald also served in their uncle&#x27;s household. Walter&#x27;s gratitude towards his aunt and uncle is shown in the foundation charter of Walter&#x27;s monastery in Dereham, where he asks the foundation to pray for the &quot;souls of Ranulf Glanvill and Bertha his wife, who nourished us&quot;. Earlier historians asserted that Walter studied law at Bologna, based on his name appearing in a list of those to be commemorated at a monastery in Bologna in which English students lodged. Modern historians have discounted this, as the list also includes benefactors, not just students; other evidence points to the fact that Walter had a poor grasp of Latin, and did not consider himself to be a learned man. However, this did not mean that he was illiterate, merely that he was not &quot;book-learned&quot;, or educated at a university. His contemporary, the medieval writer Gerald of Wales said of Walter that the Exchequer was his school.

==Early assignments==

By 1184–1185 Walter had a position as a baron of the exchequer. The king employed him on several tasks, including as a negotiator, a justice, and as a royal secretary. He was appointed Dean of York by order of King Henry II about July 1186. The archbishopric had been vacant since 1181 and would remain so until 1189, so it was Walter&#x27;s job as dean to administer the archbishopric of York. Walter was also an unsuccessful candidate to become Archbishop of York in September 1186. The medieval chronicler Gervase of Canterbury said that during Henry II&#x27;s reign, Walter &quot;ruled England because Glanvill sought his counsel&quot;. Documents also show that Walter was active in the administration of the diocese of York.

At the same time he was administering York, Walter founded a Premonstratensian house of canons on purchased property at West Dereham, Norfolk in 1188. His uncle and other family members had favoured the Premonstratensian Order, and this West Dereham Abbey was located near the family lands in Norfolk.

In 1187 Walter, along with Glanvill and King Henry II, attempted to mediate a dispute between the Archbishop of Canterbury, Baldwin of Forde, and the monks of the cathedral chapter. Their efforts were fruitless, and Walter was later drawn back into the dispute, in early 1189 and again as archbishop. The dispute centred on the attempt by Baldwin to build a church dedicated to Saint Thomas Becket, just outside the town of Canterbury. The plan was to staff the church with canons instead of monks, which the monks of Canterbury&#x27;s cathedral chapter feared was an attempt to take away the cathedral chapter&#x27;s right to elect the archbishop. The attempt in 1189 was settled by Baldwin giving up the site near Canterbury for one further away at Lambeth, which was less threatening to the monks.

==Bishop and archbishop==
After the death of King Henry in 1189, the new King Richard I appointed Walter Bishop of Salisbury; the election took place on 15 September 1189 at Pipewell, with the consecration on 22 October 1189 at Westminster. Also elected to bishoprics at this council were Godfrey de Lucy to the see of Winchester, Richard FitzNeal to the see of London, and William Longchamp to the see of Ely. The elevation of so many new bishops was probably meant to signal the new king&#x27;s break with his father&#x27;s habit of keeping bishoprics empty to retain the revenues of the sees. At about the same time Glanvill was either forced out of his justiciarship or resigned, but the sources are unclear. Walter was probably elevated to a bishopric even though his uncle had lost some of his power because of political manoeuvring over the elevation of King Richard&#x27;s illegitimate half-brother Geoffrey to the see of York, which Walter had at first opposed. The bishopric was either a reward or a bribe for Walter&#x27;s withdrawal of his objections to Geoffrey&#x27;s election.

Soon after his appointment, Walter accompanied the king on the Third Crusade, going ahead of the king directly from Marseille to the Holy Land in a group that included Baldwin of Forde, Archbishop of Canterbury, and Ranulf de Glanvill. The group left Marseille in August 1190, and arrived at Acre two months later. While on crusade, he was praised by his fellow crusaders, and acted as Richard&#x27;s principal negotiator with Saladin for a peace treaty. After the conclusion of the treaty with Saladin, Walter was in the first band of pilgrims that entered Jerusalem. Saladin entertained Walter during his stay in Jerusalem, and the Englishman succeeded in extracting a promise from Saladin that a small group of Western clergy would be allowed to remain in the city to perform divine services. Walter subsequently led the English army back to England after Richard&#x27;s departure from Palestine, but in Sicily he heard of the king&#x27;s capture, and diverted to Germany. He, along with William of Sainte-Mère-Eglise, was among the first of Richard&#x27;s subjects to find the king at Ochsenfurt where he was being held. In April 1193 he returned to England to raise the king&#x27;s ransom. Richard wrote to his mother, Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine, that Walter should be chosen for the see of Canterbury, as well as to the monks of the cathedral chapter, and soon after Walter&#x27;s return to England, he was duly elected archbishop of Canterbury, having been translated to the see on 29 May 1193. He was chosen as archbishop without consultation from the bishops, who normally claimed the right to help decide the new archbishop. He received his pallium, the symbol of his archiepiscopal authority, from Pope Celestine III and was ceremonially enthroned at Canterbury on 7 November 1193.

==Justiciar==

After Richard was freed, he spent little time in England, instead concentrating on the war with King Philip II of France, which began with Philip&#x27;s attempts to acquire Richard&#x27;s possessions on the continent. Richard made Walter Chief Justiciar about 25 December 1193. Walter remained in England, raising money for the king&#x27;s wars and overseeing the administration of the kingdom. The constant warfare forced Walter to find new means of raising money through taxation. The historian Doris Stenton wrote that the Pipe Rolls, or financial records, during Walter&#x27;s time as justiciar &quot;give the impression of a country taxed to the limit&quot;. Walter was also responsible for choosing royal justices, and many of his choices were connected with, or had previously worked with, the archbishop in the royal administration. Because of Richard&#x27;s absence from England, Walter was able to exercise more authority as justiciar than any of his predecessors. All that Walter needed to do was keep Richard&#x27;s monetary needs satisfied. Combined with Walter&#x27;s position as archbishop, Walter wielded a power unseen in England since the days of Lanfranc.

One of Walter&#x27;s first acts as justiciar was in February 1194, when he presided over a feudal judgement of John, Richard&#x27;s younger brother. After Richard&#x27;s release from captivity, John, intending to begin a rebellion, had prepared his castles for defence. His letters ordering the preparations were intercepted and John was deprived of his lands. When John showed no signs of submitting, Walter called an ecclesiastical council at Westminster for the purposes of excommunicating John unless he submitted. John refused to submit, and was excommunicated. To defeat the rebellion, Walter was required to lay siege to Marlborough Castle himself. Walter employed his brother Theobald in similar actions in Lancaster, and rewarded him with the office of sheriff of Lancaster. Eventually in May 1194, John made peace with Richard, and was restored to favour, although the restoration of his lands did not occur until late in 1195.

Walter&#x27;s chief administrative measures were his instructions to the itinerant justices of 1194 and 1198, his ordinance of 1195, an attempt to increase order in the kingdom, and his plan of 1198 for the assessment of a land tax. In 1194 the justices were ordered by a document now known as the Articles of Eyre to secure the election of four coroners by each county court. The coroners were to &quot;keep&quot;, or register, royal pleas, which had previously been a duty of the sheriff. The juries were to be chosen by a committee of four knights, also elected by the county court. This introduction of coroners and constables eventually led to a change in the role of sheriffs, and a lessening of their importance in royal administration. Although he probably did not take part in the decision to set up a special exchequer for the collection of Richard&#x27;s ransom, Walter did appoint the two escheators, or guardians of the amounts due, who were Hugh Bardulf in the north of England and William of Sainte-Mère-Eglise in the south. His instructions for the eyre, or circuits of traveling justices, are the first that survive in English history. It was during his tenure of the justiciarship that the judicial role of the Exchequer became separated from the purely financial aspects.

He also worked to introduce order into the lending of money by Jewish moneylenders, and organised a system where the royal officials worked to combat fraud by both parties in the business of Jewish money lending. Walter was probably the originator of the custom of keeping an archival copy of all charters, letters, patents and feet of fines, or record of agreements reached in the royal courts, in the chancery. The first recorded &quot;foot of the fine&quot; is endorsed with the statement &quot;This is the first chirograph that was made in the king&#x27;s court in the form of three chirographs, according to the command of his lordship of Canterbury and other barons of the king, to the end that by this form a record can be made to be passed on to the treasurer to put in the treasury.&quot; The agreement concerns Walter&#x27;s brother Theobald, who was the plaintiff.

Walter also helped with the creation of a more professional group of royal justices. Although the group, which included Simon of Pattishall, Ralph Foliot, Richard Barre, William de Warenne, Richard Herriard, and Walter&#x27;s brother Osbert fitzHervey, had mostly already served as justices prior to Walter&#x27;s term of office, it was Walter who used them extensively. It appears likely that Walter chose them for their ability, not for any familial ties to himself. This group of men replaced the previous system of using mostly local men, and are the first signs of a professional judiciary.

In 1195 Walter issued an ordinance by which four knights were appointed in every hundred to act as guardians of the peace, a precursor to the office of Justice of the Peace. His use of the knights, who appear for the first time in political life, is the first sign of the rise of this class who, either as Members of Parliament (MPs) or justices of the peace, later became the mainstay of English government. In 1198, Walter requested a carucage, or plough-tax, of five shillings on every plough-land, or carucate, under cultivation. However, difficulties arose over the assessments, so the justiciar ordered them to be made by a sworn jury in every hundred. It is likely that those jurors were elected.

In foreign affairs, Walter negotiated with Scotland in 1195 and with the Welsh in 1197. Scotland claimed Northumbria, or northern England. Negotiations broke down, but relations between the two countries remained good throughout the rest of Richard&#x27;s reign. Talks with the Welsh began after the English lords Roger Mortimer and William de Briouze expanded into Welsh territory in 1195, causing a concern that the Welsh lord Rhys ap Gruffydd would strike back across the border. In 1196, Walter quickly suppressed a popular uprising in London led by William Fitz Osbern. FitzOsbern was an orator who harnessed the discontent of the poor residents of London against high taxes. His oratory provoked a riot in London, and he was apprehended and hanged on Walter&#x27;s orders.

==Ecclesiastical affairs and resignation==
Walter held a legateship from Pope Celestine III from 1195 to 1198, which enabled him to act with the pope&#x27;s delegated authority within the English Church. Walter actively investigated ecclesiastical misconduct, and deposed several abbots, including Robert of Thorney Abbey in 1195 and an abbot of St Mary&#x27;s in the province of the Archbishop of York. At the monastic cathedral of Worcester, he disciplined the monks between the death of Henry de Sully and the election of John of Coutances, as was his right as the archbishop of the province. In his own diocese, he granted markets and fairs to towns, was granted the privilege of minting coins at Shrewsbury, and worked to recover lands and manors that had been lost to the archdiocese.

Walter revived the scheme of his predecessor, Baldwin of Forde, to found a church in Canterbury that would be secular and not monastic. He promised that the new foundation&#x27;s canons would not be allowed to vote in archiepiscopal elections nor would the body of Saint Thomas Becket ever be moved to the new church, but the monks of his cathedral chapter were suspicious and appealed to the papacy. The dispute from the time of Baldwin of Forde flared up again, with the papacy supporting the monks and the king supporting the archbishop. Finally, Pope Innocent III ruled for the monks and ordered Walter to destroy what had been built.

The archbishop held ecclesiastical councils, including one at York in 1195 that legislated that the clergy should collect their tithes in full, &quot;...without any reduction&quot;. Another council was held at London in 1200 to legislate the size and composition of clerical retinues, and also ruled that the clergy, when saying Mass, should speak clearly and not speed up or slow down their speech. At the request of the papacy, Walter also led inquiries into the canonisations of Gilbert of Sempringham and Wulfstan of Worcester. Walter refused to acquiesce in the election of Gerald of Wales to the see of St David&#x27;s in Wales and opposed the efforts of Gerald and others to elevate St David&#x27;s to an archbishopric.

In the later part of Richard&#x27;s reign, the pressures mounted on Walter. Conflicts between his ecclesiastical duties and his government duties made him the target of criticism from both sides. A dispute in December 1197, over Richard&#x27;s demand that the magnates of England provide 300 knights to serve in France, led to renewed grumbling among the clergy and barons. Richard was also dissatisfied with the results of the carucage in 1198, so Walter resigned his position of chief justiciar on 11 July of that year. Walter may have resigned willingly, as he had talked of resigning his secular duties since 1194. Some medieval sources, however, stated that he was forced out of office by the king.

==Under John==

According to the &quot;Life of William Marshal&quot;, which dates to soon after 1219, when word reached William Marshal, one of the richest and most influential barons, that Richard was dead, he consulted with Walter and discussed whom to support as the next king. Marshal&#x27;s choice was John, but Walter initially leaned towards John&#x27;s young nephew Arthur of Brittany. When Marshall was insistent on John, who was an adult, the author of the &quot;Life&quot; has Walter say in reply &quot; &#x27;So be it then,&#x27; said the archbishop, &#x27;but mark my words, Marshal, you will never regret anything in your life as much as this.&#x27;&quot; This is almost certainly a retrospective comment that has been inserted into the biography, however, based on John&#x27;s later behaviour. Once John knew he had the support of Walter and William Marshal, he sent Walter ahead to England to request all free men to pledge fealty to the new king. On 27 May 1199 Walter crowned John, supposedly making a speech that promulgated, for the last time, the theory of a king&#x27;s election by the people. This story is only contained in the writings of Matthew Paris, however, and although it seems certain that Walter made a speech, it is not certain what the exact contents were. On his coronation day, John appointed Walter Lord Chancellor. W. L. Warren, historian and author of a biography of John, says of Walter that &quot;No one living had a firmer grasp of the intricacies of royal government, yet even in old age his mind was adaptable and fecund with suggestions for coping with new problems.&quot;

One of Walter&#x27;s first suggestions was to lower the fees for having charters confirmed, from nine pounds and five shillings to eighteen shillings and four pence. Accompanying this measure was a requirement that no charter would be accepted in a king&#x27;s court without having been confirmed by King John. Not only did this reduce forgeries, it led to the establishment of the Charter Roll, an administrative copy of all charters issued and confirmed by the government. In his relations with other officers, Walter worked closely with the justiciar Geoffrey Fitz Peter, on the collection of taxation, and both men went to Wales in 1203 on a diplomatic mission. Another joint action of the two men concerned a tax of a seventh part of all movables collected from both lay and ecclesiastical persons. The medieval chronicler Roger of Wendover said that the king &quot;had Archbishop Hubert of Canterbury to act for him in the matter of the church property, Geoffrey fitz-Peter in the matter of lay property; and these two spared no one in carrying out their orders.&quot; Walter was also responsible for the keeping of copies of other royal letters in the Close Rolls and the Patent Rolls. The Patent rolls record letters that were issued in &quot;patent&quot;, or openly and not sealed, and the Close rolls record letters issued sealed, or letters close. The various rolls are extant from 1199 for the Charter roll, 1201 for the Patent roll, and 1204 for the Close roll. Walter also continued to innovate in local government, as the earliest record of the coroner&#x27;s rolls, or county records, being used to cross-check oral testimony in the county courts date from 1202 and 1203, during Walter&#x27;s chancellorship.

In 1201 Walter went on a diplomatic mission to Philip II of France, which was unsuccessful, and in 1202 he returned to England as regent while John was abroad. In April 1204 Walter returned to France with John de Gray the Bishop of Norwich, Eustace the Bishop of Ely, William Marshal, and Robert de Beaumont the Earl of Leicester to seek peace with Philip Augustus. Philip insisted that John hand over Arthur of Brittany, Arthur&#x27;s sister Eleanor, and renounce all of his continental possessions before the French king would make peace. John refused to do this, and the embassy returned to England not long before Philip conquered Normandy.

Besides sending Walter on diplomatic missions, King John gave Walter custody of Rochester Castle on 20 July 1202, but as Walter was already accounting for the taxes and fees of the city of Rochester to the Exchequer in 1200, it is possible that he held the castle before 1202. John also upheld the right of the archbishop to mint coins, which Walter held until his death in 1205.

Under John, Walter continued to be active in ecclesiastical affairs, and in September 1200 held a provincial church council at London. This council set forth 14 canons, or decrees, which dealt with a number of subjects, including doctrinal concerns, financial affairs, and the duties of the clergy. It drew heavily on earlier church decrees, including those of the Third Lateran Council of 1179. Walter also interceded with Pope Innocent III in 1200, mediating between the pope and the king over a royal dispute with the Cistercians. Walter&#x27;s intercession prevented the dispute from escalating, and kept the pope from imposing sanctions on the king for his threats to the Cistercians. It was in 1200 that the church court records of the archdiocese of Canterbury began to be recorded and kept, although after Walter&#x27;s death in 1205 the records become sparse until the 14th century.

==Death and legacy==

Walter died on 13 July 1205, from a septic carbuncle on his back. The lingering character of his ailment permitted a reconciliation with his monks. The medieval chronicler Ralph of Coggeshall described his death as taking four days, and related that he gave vestments, jewellery, and altar furnishings to his monks, which were confiscated by King John after Walter&#x27;s death. He was buried in the Trinity Chapel in Canterbury Cathedral, next to Thomas Becket, where his tomb can still be seen. The tomb occupied a highly visible spot in the Trinity Chapel, and Walter was the first archbishop to be buried there since the 1170s, when all of the tombs but Becket&#x27;s had been relocated to focus attention on Becket&#x27;s shrine. He remained the only ecclesiastic to be buried there until the 14th century. The use by the archbishops of Canterbury of the title &quot;Primate of All England&quot; dates from Walter&#x27;s archepiscopal tenure.

The medieval chronicler Matthew Paris retold the story that when King John heard of Walter&#x27;s death, the king exclaimed &quot;Now for the first time I am king of England.&quot; This story, however entertaining, is apocryphal. More secure is the story that another chronicler, Roger of Wendover, relates about Walter&#x27;s Christmas celebrations in 1200. Roger reports that Walter distributed clothing to those attending his Christmas feast, which angered King John. The chronicler says that Walter &quot;wished to put himself on a par with the king&quot;.

Walter was not a holy man, although he was, as John Gillingham, a historian and biographer of Richard I, says, &quot;one of the most outstanding government ministers in English History&quot;. Hugh of Lincoln, a contemporary and later canonised, is said to have asked forgiveness of God for not having rebuked Walter as often as he probably should have. Modern historians tend not to share the older view that Walter was the driving force behind the administrative changes during Richard&#x27;s reign, that Richard was uninterested in government, and that he left all decisions in the hands of his ministers, especially Longchamp and Walter. The studies of James Holt and others have shown that Richard was highly involved in government decisions, and that it was more a partnership between the king and his ministers. Walter was, however, very innovative in his approach to government. Walter continued to enjoy the support of Richard&#x27;s brother John, and it was during John&#x27;s reign that a number of Walter&#x27;s administrative reforms took place, although how much royal initiative was behind the innovations is unknown, given John&#x27;s interest in government and administration.

Walter was the butt of jokes about his lack of learning, and was the target of a series of tales from the pen of the chronicler Gerald of Wales. Even Walter&#x27;s supporters could only state that he was &quot;moderately literate&quot;. Walter employed several canon lawyers who had been educated at Bologna in his household, including John of Tynemouth, Simon of Southwell, and Honorius of Kent. He also employed the architect Elias of Dereham, who was one of Walter&#x27;s executors. Elias is traditionally credited as being the architect of Salisbury Cathedral after Walter&#x27;s death. Another scholar employed by Walter was Peter of Blois, who served both Walter and his predecessor as a Latin secretary.

Little is known of his appearance, although he was described by Gerald of Wales as tall and handsome. Gerald also praised his intelligence and cleverness.

W. L. Warren advances the theory that either Walter or Geoffrey Fitz Peter, instead of Ranulf Glanvill, was the author of &quot;Tractatus de legibus et consuetudinibus regni Angliae,&quot; a legal treatise on the laws and constitutions of the English. Chrimes agrees that Glanvill was probably not the author, and feels that Walter likely was, although he could not be certain. If he was the author, he composed what Chrimes called a &quot;great literary memorial of Henry II&#x27;s government&quot;. Neither of Walter&#x27;s two modern biographers, however, feel that he was the author of the &quot;Tractatus&quot;, and the historian Ralph Turner agrees. The historian Michael Clanchy says of Walter &quot;The proliferation of documents was a European and a continuing phenomenon, yet if it were to be associated in England with one man, he would be Hubert Walter.&quot;

<text>Ammophila (synonymous with &quot;Psamma&quot; P. Beauv.) is a genus of flowering plants consisting of two or three very similar species of grasses. The common names for these grasses include marram grass, bent grass, and beachgrass. These grasses are found almost exclusively on the first line of coastal dunes. Their extensive systems of creeping underground stems or rhizomes allow them to thrive under conditions of shifting sands and high winds, and to help stabilize and prevent coastal erosion. &quot;Ammophila&quot; species are native to the coasts of the North Atlantic Ocean where they are usually the dominant species on dunes. Their native range includes few inland regions, with the Great Lakes of North America being the main exception. The genus name &quot;Ammophila&quot; originates from the Greek words ἄμμος (&quot;ámmos&quot;), meaning &quot;sand&quot;, and φίλος (&quot;philos&quot;), meaning &quot;friend&quot;.

The &quot;Ammophila&quot; grasses are widely known as examples of xerophytes, plants that can withstand dry conditions. Despite their occurrence on seacoasts, &quot;Ammophila&quot; grasses are not particularly tolerant of saline soils; they can tolerate a salinity of about 15 g/L (1.5%), which makes them &quot;moderate halophytes&quot;.

&quot;Ammophila&quot; builds coastal dunes and thus stabilizes the sand. For this reason, the plants are seen as a useful means of reinforcing dunes around the world and have been introduced far from their native range. Alfred Wiedemann writes that &quot;Ammophila arenaria&quot;, the European species, &quot;has been introduced into virtually every British colonial settlement within its latitudinal tolerance range, including southeast and southwest Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, the Falkland Islands, and Norfolk Island and has been reported from Argentina and Chile.&quot; &quot;Ammophila&quot; species were introduced in the late 19th century on the Pacific coast of North America as well, and massive, intentional plantings were continued at least through 1960. 

In essentially all of the locations where they have been introduced, &quot;Ammophila&quot; plants are now listed as invasive. &quot;Ammophila&quot; infestations largely impact coastal groundbirds and endemic dune plants, such as the Western Snowy plover, Streaked Horned lark (Eremophila alpestris strigata), and pink sand verbena (Abronia. umbellata ssp. breviflora). In California, efforts to cull invasive &quot;Ammophila arenaria&quot; from Morro Strand State Beach began in 2000 and involved a combination of herbicide treatments and handpulling by a California Conservation Corps crew. This initiative produced 60 percent mortality among the &quot;Ammophila&quot; after several months, but it was estimated that several additional rounds of treatment would be needed to fully remove the infestation, and the effort specifically focused on &quot;relatively new infestations.&quot; Bulldozing has also been used as an effective mechanical treatment for &quot;Ammophila&quot; infestations in the Pacific Northwest, but research indicates that the intensity and frequency of bulldozing employed to remove &quot;Ammophila&quot; may also harm endemic dune plants and have negative impacts on dune geomorphology.

== Species ==
Only two species seem incontrovertible: &quot;A. arenaria&quot; and &quot;A. breviligulata&quot;. Two other species have been proposed, and are discussed below.
* A. arenaria - European marram grass or European beachgrass. Native to coasts of Europe (north to Iceland) and northwest Africa. Inflorescence to 25 cm long; broad.
* A. baltica - Purple marram. &quot;A. baltica&quot; has now been identified as a hybrid between &quot;A. arenaria&quot; and &quot;Calamagrostis epigejos&quot;. The hybrid occurs in parts of northern Europe, mainly from the Baltic Sea west to eastern England, and is known as &quot;× Ammocalamagrostis baltica&quot; or &quot;× Calammophila baltica&quot;.
* A. breviligulata - American marram grass or American beachgrass. Native to coasts of eastern North America, including the shores of the Great Lakes. Inflorescence to 30 cm long; narrower than &quot;A. arenaria&quot;.
* A. champlainensis or A. breviligulata ssp. champlainensis - Champlain beachgrass. Native to the shores of Lake Ontario and Lake Champlain. Inflorescence to 22 cm long; very similar to &quot;A. breviligulata&quot;, and no longer considered a distinct species by several authorities.

== Ecology ==

In Europe, &quot;Ammophila arenaria&quot; has a coastal distribution and is the dominant species on dunes where it is responsible for stabilising and building the foredune by capturing blown sand and binding it together with the warp and weft of its tough, fibrous rhizome system. Marram grass is strongly associated with two coastal plant community types in the British National Vegetation Classification. In community SD6 (Mobile Dune) &quot;Ammophila&quot; is the dominant species. In the semi-fixed dunes (community SD7), where the quantity of blown sand is declining &quot;Ammophila&quot; becomes less competitive, and other species, notably &quot;Festuca rubra&quot; (red fescue) become prominent.

== Uses ==
The ability of marram grass to grow on and bind sand makes it a useful plant in the stabilization of coastal dunes and artificial defences on sandy coasts. The usefulness was recognized in the late 18th century. On the North Sea coast of Jutland,
Denmark, marram grass was traditionally much used for fuel, thatch, cattle fodder (after frost) etc. The use led to sand drift and loss of arable land. Hence, legislation promoting dune stabilization came into force in 1779 and 1792, successively leading to a system of state-supported &quot;dune planters&quot; overlooked by &quot;dune bailiffs&quot;. Marram grass was – and still is – propagated by root and shoot cuttings dug up locally and planted into the naked sand in periods of relatively calm and moist weather.

Women from the village of Newborough, Anglesey, Wales once used marram grass in the manufacture of mats, haystack covers and brushes for whitewashing.

Marram grass has been widely used for thatch in many areas of the British Isles close to the sea. The harvesting of marram grass for thatch was so widespread during the 17th century that it had the effect of destabilizing dunes, resulting in the burial of many villages, estates and farms. In 1695 the practice was banned by an Act of the Scottish Parliament: 

== Adaptations ==
Like other xerophytes, marram grass is well adapted to its surroundings to thrive in an otherwise harsh environment. The natural loss of water through transpiration is not desirable in a very dry landscape, and marram grass has developed particular adaptations to help it deal with this. Sandy conditions drain water quickly, and very windy conditions will further increase rates of transpiration.

Marram grass has a rolled leaf that creates a localized environment of water vapour concentration within the leaf and helps to prevent water loss. The stomata sit in small pits within the curls of the structure, which makes them less likely to open and lose water. The folded leaves have hairs on the inside to slow or stop air movement, much like many other xerophytes (though these are typically found on the outside of the plant,in marram grass they are also within the leaf as this has now become a structure with more volume). This slowing of air movement once again reduces the amount of water vapour being lost. A waxy cuticle on the leaf surface also prevents evaporation.

<text>Robert Kilwardby ( 1215 – 11 September 1279) was an Archbishop of Canterbury in England and a cardinal. Kilwardby was the first member of a mendicant order to attain a high ecclesiastical office in the English Church.

==Life==
Kilwardby studied at the University of Paris, then was a teacher of grammar and logic there. He then joined the Dominican Order and studied theology, and became regent at Oxford University before 1261, probably by 1245. He was named provincial prior of the Dominicans for England in 1261, and in October 1272 Pope Gregory X appointed him as Archbishop of Canterbury to end a dispute over the election. Kilwardby was provided to the archbishopric on 11 October 1272, given the temporalities on 12 December 1272, and consecrated on 26 February 1273.

Kilwardby crowned Edward I and his wife Eleanor as king and queen of England in August 1274, but otherwise took little part in politics. He instead concentrated on his ecclesiastical duties, including charity to the poor and donating to the Dominicans.

In 1278 Pope Nicholas III named Kilwardby Cardinal Bishop of Porto and Santa Rufina. He then resigned Canterbury and left England, taking with him papers, registers and documents belonging to the see. He also left the see deep in debt again, after his predecessor had cleared the debt. While in theory this was a promotion, probably it was not, as the pope was unhappy with Kilwardby&#x27;s support of efforts to resist the payment of papal revenues and with the lack of effort towards the reforms demanded at the Second Council of Lyon in 1274.

He died in Italy in 1279, and was buried in the Dominican convent in Viterbo.

==Reputation==
Kilwardby&#x27;s theological and philosophical views were summed up by David Knowles who said that he was a &quot;conservative eclectic, holding the doctrine of seminal tendencies and opposing...the Aristotelian doctrine of the unity of form in beings, including man.&quot; Some sources state that he was the author of &quot;Summa Philosophiae&quot;, a history and description of the schools of philosophical thought then current, but the writing style is not similar to his other works, and Knowles, for one, does not believe it was authored by Kilwardby.

It has been alleged that Kilwardby was an opponent of Thomas Aquinas. In 1277 he prohibited the teaching of thirty theses, some of which have been thought to touch upon Thomas Aquinas&#x27; teaching. Recent scholars, however, such as Roland Hissette, have challenged this interpretation.

<text>Geraint ( ; died 710), known in Latin as Gerontius, was a king of Dumnonia who ruled in the early 8th century. During his reign, it is believed that Dumnonia came repeatedly into conflict with the neighbouring Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Wessex. Geraint was the last recorded king of a unified Dumnonia, and was called King of the Welsh by the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;. Subsequent kings of Dumnonia (for example Donyarth and possibly Huwal) reigned over an area that was eventually reduced to the limits of present-day Cornwall.

==Biography==
A long and rather acrimonious letter survives that is addressed to Geraint from Aldhelm, Bishop of Sherborne, discussing the Easter Problem and the shape of the tonsure. It is clear from this letter that in the later 7th century the Britons in Cornwall and Devon still observed Easter on the dates that the British church had calculated, at variance with Roman Catholic practice. Geraint ultimately agreed with Aldhelm to comply with Roman practice on these points.

According to John of Worcester, Geraint was killed in 710 after a series of battles that culminated in a victory of the West Saxons under Ine of Wessex. It was probably around this time that the West Saxons entered Devon, possibly taking Exeter shortly afterward. Following Geraint&#x27;s death, however, Ine was unable to establish his authority further west; in 722, according to the &quot;Annales Cambriae&quot;, the Cornish won the Battle of Hehil, probably against Wessex.

Derek Bryce, following other scholars, suggests that Geraint of Dumnonia should be identified as the real warrior eulogized for his deeds at the Battle of Llongborth in the poem &quot;Geraint son of Erbin&quot; (10th–11th century, traditionally ascribed to Llywarch Hen), although its title names an earlier, 5th-century Geraint of dubious historicity. Bryce identifies Llongborth with the 710 battle between Geraint and Ine, and suggests Langport in Somerset as the location of the battle, though no settlement is known to have existed there until 880. Another interpretation is that the Battle of Llongborth is a different spelling of the Battle of Longecoleth , which is also dated to 710. The latter took place in the more northerly Kingdom of Strathclyde (also called Damnonia after the Damnonii tribe of the area in Romano-British times, and easily confused with Dumnonia/Devon). Strathclyde had rulers named Geraint and Erbin (or Elfin) in the same era.

A King Geraint is the patron folk saint of Gerrans, near Falmouth, with a feast day on 10 August. It is uncertain whether this figure represents this historical Geraint of the 7th–8th centuries, the 5th-century legendary figure, or some other Geraint.

<text>Robert Burnell (sometimes spelled Robert Burnel; 1239 – 25 October 1292) was an English bishop who served as Lord Chancellor of England from 1274 to 1292. A native of Shropshire, he served as a minor royal official before entering into the service of Prince Edward, the future King Edward I of England. When Edward went on the Eighth Crusade in 1270, Burnell stayed in England to secure the prince&#x27;s interests. He served as regent after the death of King Henry III of England while Edward was still on crusade. He was twice elected Archbishop of Canterbury, but his personal life—which included a long-term mistress who was rumoured to have borne him four sons—prevented his confirmation by the papacy. In 1275 Burnell was elected Bishop of Bath and Wells, after Edward had appointed him Lord Chancellor in 1274.

Burnell was behind the efforts of the royal officials to enforce royal rights during his term of office as chancellor, including the implementation of the &quot;Quo warranto&quot; procedures. He also helped with the legislative and legal reforms of Edward&#x27;s reign. During Burnell&#x27;s tenure the chancellor&#x27;s office and records became fixed in London rather than travelling with the king. Burnell went abroad on diplomatic missions for Edward, and for a time governed Gascony. He continued to enjoy the king&#x27;s trust until his death in 1292; one historian has suggested that Burnell may have been the most important royal official of the 13th century.

==Early life==
By 1198 Burnell&#x27;s family had bestowed its name on Acton Burnell in Shropshire, where Burnell was born probably in about 1239, as he was close in age to King Edward. His father was probably Roger Burnell, who died in about 1259. He had three brothers, two of whom died fighting the Welsh at the Battle of Moel-y-don in 1282; the third, Hugh, died in 1286. Hugh&#x27;s son Philip was Robert&#x27;s eventual heir. Burnell worked as a clerk in the royal chancery, the office responsible for the writing of documents, before moving to the household of Prince Edward, later King Edward I of England. By 1257 Burnell was spending most of his time with the prince and the prince&#x27;s household. After Simon de Montfort&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Lewes in 1264, Burnell continued to serve Edward, and was named the prince&#x27;s clerk in December 1264. As a reward for his service, Burnell was given the prebend of Holme in the diocese of York some time before 1267, and was named Archdeacon of York in December 1270. He also held the office of chancellor to Edward from the time of the Battle of Evesham in 1265 until 1270, when Edward left on crusade.

Prince Edward tried to have Burnell elected to the Archbishopric of Canterbury in 1270, but was frustrated by the Canterbury cathedral chapter&#x27;s members, who instead elected their prior, William Chillenden. Eventually Pope Gregory X set Chillenden aside and installed his own choice in the see, Robert Kilwardby. Burnell did not accompany the prince on crusade in late 1270, although he had originally planned to do so. Instead, he was appointed one of the four lieutenants who looked after Edward&#x27;s interests while the prince was away. Thus he was still in England when Henry III died in November 1272. Burnell acted as one of the regents of the kingdom until August 1274, when the prince, now king, returned from Palestine. During the regency Burnell supervised a parliament, dealt with raids on the Welsh Marches and resolved a trade conflict with Flanders. After the king&#x27;s return to England Burnell was made chancellor. The historian Richard Huscroft considers that Burnell gained valuable experience governing England during Edward&#x27;s absence, ensuring Burnell&#x27;s dominance in the English government after Edward&#x27;s return.

==Chancellor and bishop==
On 23 January 1275 Burnell was elected to the see of Bath and Wells. He received the temporalities of the see on 19 March 1275 and was consecrated on 7 April 1275. Three years later Edward once more tried to secure the see of Canterbury for his favourite. Burnell was elected to the archbishopric in June or July 1278, but the election was quashed by Pope Nicholas III in January 1279. King Edward sent a deputation, including the eventual appointee, John Peckham, to secure Nicholas&#x27; confirmation of the election. The pope named three cardinals as investigators, and then appointed Peckham instead. The bishop&#x27;s second failure to obtain the archbishopric was probably a consequence of his lifestyle, which included keeping a mistress. Edward made one final attempt to promote his friend to a wealthier see in early 1280, when Burnell was nominated to become Bishop of Winchester, but Pope Nicholas III quashed the election on 28 June 1280.

Burnell was the chief and most influential of Edward I&#x27;s advisers during the first half of his reign. As part of his duties Burnell spent most of his time in attendance on the king. He heard many requests and petitions from those who desired patronage or other advancements, and was diligent and active in dealing with routine business. Burnell played a leading role in the legislation introduced by King Edward. The king&#x27;s major legislative acts mainly date to Burnell&#x27;s tenure of the office of chancellor, from 21 September 1274 until Burnell&#x27;s death in 1292. Burnell was instrumental in the enforcement of royal writs and enactments, including the Statutes of Westminster, enacted in 1275, 1285, and 1290. Those of 1275 attempted to deal with the usurpation of royal rights. Keeping the peace in the realm and the extension of royal jurisdiction to cover rape was dealt with in the statutes from 1285, along with a number of other issues. The last statute, from 1290, regulated land law, the result of pressure from the magnates, the leading laymen of England.

During Burnell&#x27;s time in office Edward and his royal officials made great efforts to reassert royal rights that were felt to have been usurped by the king&#x27;s subjects. These efforts were made under writs of &quot;Quo warranto&quot;, which asked the recipient what royal grant or warrant gives the recipient the authority to exercise a right or a power. They were first issued in 1278, after earlier attempts to recover royal rights through parliament unintentionally resulted in too much work for that body. Through these writs, attempts were made to enforce the rule that the only correct way to receive a privilege or grant of land was through a written charter, which might have deprived most of the magnates of England of their lands and rights. Most lands at that time were held not by documentary grants, but by the force of custom. By the 1290s the government was forced to back down and permit rights as they had been allowed from &quot;time out of mind&quot;.

The distinction between the king&#x27;s personal household department of the Wardrobe and the governmental department of the Chancery, which was headed by the chancellor, disappeared almost entirely during Burnell&#x27;s period of office. The Wardrobe had developed as a less formal department for the collection and distribution of money, but under Edward had effectively become a treasury for warfare. There was no rivalry between the holders of the Great Seal, the official seal of government and used for formal documents, and the Privy Seal, used to authenticate the king&#x27;s less formal letters. During Burnell&#x27;s time in office the king only used a Privy Seal warrant, or an informal set of instructions for the chancellor to issue a letter from the Chancery under the Great Seal, when the king and Burnell were apart; after Burnell&#x27;s death the number of Privy Seal warrants increased greatly.

Edward had such trust in his chancellor and the chancellor&#x27;s clerks that Burnell and the clerks were allowed to dispense with the hanaper system, which required fees for sealing charters to be paid into the hanaper department of the Chancery for disbursal. Robert and his clerks were permitted to enjoy the profits from the fees of their office. Burnell was also responsible for the decision to force the Court of Chancery to settle in London, rather than following the king and his court around the country. A Chancery memorandum of 1280 records that the chancellor, along with the other ministers, now had the duty of sorting the many petitions that came into the government and only passing on the most urgent to the king.

As bishop, Burnell had a wall built around the cathedral at Wells, which helped to improve the security of the cathedral and its outlying buildings. He left the court each year at Lent, when he returned to his diocese and attended to its affairs. Peckham appointed Burnell to be his deputy when the archbishop went to Wales in 1282. It was probably Burnell who suggested a compromise in 1285 over the jurisdictions of the royal and ecclesiastical courts, which allowed royal officials to return cases involving only religious matters to the church courts.

==Foreign service==
Burnell was active in the king&#x27;s foreign policy, especially towards France, Scotland and Wales, and undertook a number of diplomatic missions to those countries. Burnell served as the royal spokesman on several of these occasions, one of them being at Paris in 1286 when he made a speech detailing the history of English–French relations since the Treaty of Paris of 1259. The speech was a prelude to discussions, successfully concluded, involving the homage that Edward owed to King Philip IV of France, for Edward&#x27;s land in France. Burnell was employed in Gascony during the late 1280s, helping to administer that duchy and to reorganise its government. He showed himself sensitive to the Gascon desire for independence and did not attempt to impose the same systems of government that were used in England. The historian Michael Prestwich therefore argues that the first half of Edward&#x27;s reign was the period when Gascony enjoyed its most successful government under the Plantagenets. Later, in June 1291, Burnell gave two speeches at the great council of English and Scottish nobles in Norham to decide the succession to the Scottish crown. Edward had been asked to mediate an end to the crisis over the succession, or the Great Cause as it was known in England.

In Welsh affairs, Burnell attended a number of councils dealing with Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, Prince of Wales, and in 1277 he escorted Llywelyn to Westminster, where Llywelyn pledged homage to Edward. Burnell was present during Edward&#x27;s conquest of Wales in the 1280s; he witnessed documents in Rhuddlan in 1282, and subsequently at Conwy and Caernarfon.

Sometime before 1290 Burnell vowed to go on crusade to help reinforce the crusader city of Acre, which was threatened by Muslims in the late 1280s, but he never fulfilled his obligation.

==Death and legacy==
Burnell died in Berwick, on 25 October 1292. His body, without his heart, is interred in the nave of Wells Cathedral; his heart was buried at Bath Abbey. Although he was usually busy with royal business, Burnell managed to expand his bishopric and provide for his relatives. He amassed great wealth, and acquired numerous estates in Shropshire, Worcestershire, Somerset, Kent, Surrey and elsewhere. At his death, he owned 82 manors over 19 counties, most of them his personal property rather than that of the diocese of Bath and Wells.
Even after he became a bishop Burnell kept a mistress, Juliana. Rumours circulated that they had four sons, and that he had a number of daughters, all of which Burnell denied. He kept a magnificent household, sufficient for him to be able to host a parliament at his home in Acton Burnell in autumn 1283. He married off a number of young female relatives, rumoured to be his daughters, to noblemen. Amabilla Burnell married a member of a royal justice&#x27;s family, and a Joan Burnell was the subject of a guarantee to the bishop that the son of William of Greystoke would marry her. A William Burnell was dean of Wells Cathedral, and was named as one of the bishop&#x27;s executors. Robert Burnell&#x27;s eventual heir was his nephew, Philip.

Burnell built extensively at Acton Burnell Castle, and large parts of his house have survived. It was substantially different in plan from the older hall-style houses, which had the private quarters at the back of a large hall. At Acton Burnell the bishop&#x27;s quarters were well away from the building&#x27;s main public spaces, and included a latrine. The house was not quite a castle, but it was designed to have some defensive capability. The overall form of the structure was of a fortified hall-house, much like the Norman-era hall-keeps. He also built the chapel and great hall in the Bishop&#x27;s Palace in Wells.

Burnell was a dominant figure during the first part of Edward&#x27;s reign, and he controlled most aspects of royal administration. He was involved not only in domestic issues but also in foreign relations, a responsibility he retained for two decades after Edward&#x27;s return to England in 1274. Huscroft argues that he may have been the most important royal administrator of the 13th century.

<text>The Nether Poppleton Tithe Barn is a tithe barn at Manor Farm in the village of Nether Poppleton in the unitary authority of City of York in the North of England. Research by dendrochronologists has shown that the tithe barn, which was built on the site of an old nunnery, is at least 450 years old. 

The area surrounding the barn forms part of a scheduled monument and after nearby St Everilda&#x27;s Church, the tithe barn is the oldest, largest and most important building in both Poppletons. 

== History ==
An old nunnery once occupied the site of the Nether Poppleton Tithe Barn until the dissolution of the monasteries. The Nether Poppleton Tithe Barn was then constructed on the site around 1542.

The building is often referred to as &quot;Rupert&#x27;s Barn&quot; because Prince Rupert of the Rhine is said to have stationed part of his army in the barn before the Battle of Marston Moor in 1644 during the English Civil War. There is also an historical connection with the Restoration of King Charles II because in 1660, Lord Fairfax and two hundred Yorkshire gentlemen gathered at the barn before marching into York for the proclamation of the restored King.

The current brickwork was added during the 18th century, and it was used to store hay and potatoes during the 20th century. The Barn was damaged in a fire in 1928 which saw the destruction of two gables at one end and the removal of the wagon entrance. 

It became a Grade II listed building on 27 August 1987 and The Friends of the Poppleton Tithe Barn (registered charity number 1060767) was then founded in 1997 to preserve and maintain the Tithe Barn for the benefit of the local community and future generations. It was restored in 1999 and completed in the year 2000. The Duke of York visited the Barn in 1999 whilst it was being restored.

<doc id="153671" wikidata="Q2077332" url="?curid=153671" title="Robert Winchelsey">
<text>Robert Winchelsey (or Winchelsea; 1245 – 11 May 1313) was an English Catholic theologian and Archbishop of Canterbury. He studied at the universities of Paris and Oxford, and later taught at both. Influenced by Thomas Aquinas, he was a scholastic theologian.

Winchelsey held various benefices in England and was the Chancellor of Oxford University before being elected to Canterbury in early 1293. Although he initially had the support of Edward I, Winchelsey later became a forceful opponent of the king. The archbishop was encouraged by the papacy to resist Edward&#x27;s attempts to tax the clergy. Winchelsey was also an opponent of the king&#x27;s treasurer Walter Langton as well as other clergy. On one occasion he rebuked an abbot so sternly that the abbot suffered a fatal heart attack.

Following the election of a former royal clerk as Pope Clement V in 1305, the king was able to secure the archbishop&#x27;s exile that same year. Upon the succession of Edward&#x27;s son, Edward II, Winchelsey was allowed to return to England after the new king petitioned the pope to allow his return. Winchelsey soon joined the king&#x27;s enemies, however, and was the only bishop to object to the return of the king&#x27;s favourite, Piers Gaveston. Winchelsey died in 1313. Although miracles were alleged to have happened at his tomb, an attempt to have him declared a saint was unsuccessful.

==Early life==

Winchelsey studied and taught at the universities of Paris and Oxford, and became the Rector of Paris, and Chancellor of Oxford. While in Paris, he read, and possibly met, Thomas Aquinas, and his own theology was thereafter purely scholastic.

In 1283, he was appointed canon of St. Paul&#x27;s in London, but it is unclear exactly when he returned to England. He held the prebend of Oxgate in the diocese of London, and was made Archdeacon of Essex, also in the London diocese, in about 1288.

==Archbishop==
===Election===
John Peckham, Archbishop of Canterbury, died in December 1292. On 13 February 1293, Winchelsey was elected as his successor. Unusually, neither the pope nor the king had a hand in his election. On 1 April, Winchelsey left England for Rome to get papal confirmation. He was not consecrated immediately because of a papal vacancy; Celestine V eventually performed the ceremony at Aquila on 12 September 1294.

===Disputes with Edward I===
Winchelsey was a fearless opponent of Edward I. When he swore his oath of fealty to Edward, he offended the king by adding a declaration that he was only swearing fealty for the temporalities, not the spiritualities. All through his term as archbishop he refused to allow Edward to tax the clergy beyond certain levels, and withstood severe pressure to change his mind. In August 1295, he offered the king a tenth of all ecclesiastical revenues, less than Edward had hoped to collect from the clergy. Winchelsey did concede though that if the war with France, which was what the money was requested to fund, continued into the following year, then the clergy would be amenable to making further contributions.

Following the issue of the papal bull &quot;Clericis laicos&quot; in 1296, forbidding the payment of taxes to a secular power, Winchelsey urged his clergy in 1297 to refuse payments to Edward. However, the clergy of the province of York paid a tax of a fifth of their revenues. Edward then declared clerics who refused to pay outlaws, and ordered their property to be seized. He conceded that the clergy could return to his protection if they paid a fine of a fifth of their revenues, exactly what the northern clergy had offered in the way of taxation. The royal clerks and many other clergy paid the fines, and in March, the southern clergy met again, and after a long debate, Winchelsey instructed each clerk to decide for himself whether or not to pay the fine. It appears that most chose to pay, but the archbishop still refused to make any contribution, and so Edward seized his lands. They were returned to him in July 1297, when the king and prelate were reconciled at Westminster. Winchelsey then tried to mediate between Edward and the earls, who also objected to Edward&#x27;s tax demands.

Winchelsey further irritated Edward with his opposition to the Bishop of Lichfield, Walter Langton, who was the king&#x27;s treasurer. The king was not the only one to be upset by the archbishop; the abbot of Oseney, in 1297, was so affected by a rebuke from him that he suffered a fatal heart attack. In 1299, Winchelsey and the king briefly reconciled, and the archbishop presided at the king&#x27;s second marriage, to Margaret of France, at Canterbury. Winchelsey vigorously asserted his authority over his suffragan, or subordinate bishops, quarrelled with Pope Boniface VIII over a Sussex living, and was excommunicated by one of the pope&#x27;s clerks in 1301. He was absolved in 1302.

===Exile and return===
Winchelsey and the barons joined in demanding reforms from the king at the parliament of Lincoln in 1301, but Winchelsey&#x27;s support of Boniface VIII&#x27;s claim to be the protector of Scotland broke the alliance. One of the reasons which led the archbishop to ally with the barons was his hostility to Edward&#x27;s adviser, Walter Langton, Bishop of Lichfield. The king took no action against Winchelsey until the Gascon and former royal clerk Bertrand de Got was named Pope Clement V in 1305. Edward then sent two envoys – Langton and Henry Lacy – to the pope, to press his claim that Winchelsey was plotting against him. Clement suspended the archbishop on 12 February 1306. Winchelsey left England and went to the papal court at Bordeaux, where he stayed until Edward&#x27;s death in July 1307. Only Antony Bek, Bishop of Durham supported the archbishop.

After the death of Edward I, the new king, Edward II, asked that Winchelsey be restored, which the pope agreed to on 22 January 1308. Soon after his return to England in early 1308 the archbishop joined the king&#x27;s enemies. The archbishop, along with the Earl of Warwick, were the only people to object to the return of the new king&#x27;s favourite Piers Gaveston to England in 1309. Winchelsey aided the barons in their prosecution of Edward II by sentencing their enemies to excommunication. He was appointed an Ordainer in 1310, and died at Otford on 11 May 1313.

==Legacy==
Winchelsey was a preacher of some note, and when preaching at St. Paul&#x27;s he attracted large crowds to his sermons and lectures. Winchelsey&#x27;s theological writings date primarily from his time at St. Paul&#x27;s, where he delivered a number of &quot;quodlibeta&quot;. The &quot;quaestiones disputatae&quot; from those sessions survive, and illustrate his highly orthodox trinitarian views and his scholastic method. Miracles were said to have been worked at his tomb in Canterbury cathedral, but efforts to have him declared a saint have been unsuccessful.

<text>Robert Thomas Powell ( ; born 1 June 1944) is an English actor who is known for the title roles in &quot;Mahler&quot; (1974) and &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot; (1977), and for his portrayal of secret agent Richard Hannay in &quot;The Thirty Nine Steps&quot; (1978) and its subsequent spinoff television series. Other major screen roles have included Tobias &quot;Toby&quot; Wren in the BBC science-fiction programme &quot;Doomwatch&quot; (1970), David Briggs in the sitcom &quot;The Detectives&quot; (1993–1997) with Jasper Carrott, and Mark Williams in the medical drama &quot;Holby City&quot; (2005–2011).

Powell’s distinctive voice has become well known as a narrator of documentaries, especially those concerning World War II including &quot;World War II in HD Colour&quot;, &quot;Hitler&#x27;s Bodyguard&quot;, &quot;The Story of the Third Reich&quot; and &quot;Secrets of World War II&quot;.

Powell was nominated for a Best Actor BAFTA TV Award for &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot; in 1978 and won a Best Actor award at the Venice Film Festival for his performance in the film &quot;Imperative&quot; in 1982.

==Early life==
Powell was born in Salford, Lancashire, the son of Kathleen (née Davis) and John Wilson Powell. He was educated at Manchester Grammar School (then a direct grant grammar school), and studied law at the University of Manchester. He has an older brother, Henry (Harry).

==Career==
Powell began acting at school, playing the title role in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;King Lear&quot;. He also appeared as a teenager in &quot;The Adventures of Samuel Poppleton&quot; on BBC Radio Children&#x27;s Hour from the North of England in Manchester, where he came under the guidance of producer, Trevor Hill, as detailed in Hill&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Over the Airwaves&quot;. He secured a post at a repertory theatre in Stoke-on-Trent. His first film part was in &quot;Robbery&quot; (1967), which starred Stanley Baker and was about the Great Train Robbery, in which he played the second man or locomotive driver&#x27;s assistant. He had a small role in the original film version of &quot;The Italian Job&quot; (1969) playing one of the gang, but had to wait a few years for his first success, playing scientist Toby Wren in the BBC&#x27;s science fiction series &quot;Doomwatch&quot; in 1970.

Having been killed off in &quot;Doomwatch&quot; right at the end of Series One in a bomb explosion, at his request, Powell became a pin-up and a household name, following up with starring roles in several BBC serials, including television adaptations of the novels &quot;Sentimental Education&quot; (1970) and &quot;Jude the Obscure&quot; (1971). In 1972–1973 he portrayed Charles Rolls in the miniseries &quot;The Edwardians&quot;. He starred in the very first episode of the British series &quot;Thriller&quot; in 1973. He also appeared in the 1975 series &quot;Looking for Clancy&quot;, based on the Frederic Mullally novel &quot;Clancy&quot;.

For several years Powell continued as a television regular, with occasional forays into film, as the Austrian composer Gustav Mahler in the Ken Russell biopic &quot;Mahler&quot; (1974) and Captain Walker in Russell&#x27;s film version of &quot;Tommy&quot; (1975). His role in &quot;Tommy&quot; had few lines, speaking only during the overture with Ann-Margret, he is primarily seen through the mind of his son as played by Barry Winch (Young Tommy) and Roger Daltrey.

Powell then played Jesus of Nazareth in &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot; (1977) following a successful second audition with Franco Zeffirelli. The four-part television film had an all-star cast, including Laurence Olivier as Nicodemus, Ernest Borgnine as the Roman Centurion, Stacy Keach as Barabbas, Christopher Plummer as Herod Antipas, Michael York as John the Baptist, Ian McShane as Judas Iscariot, Rod Steiger as Pontius Pilate and James Mason as Joseph of Arimathea. For this role, Powell was nominated for a BAFTA award, and collected the &quot;TVTimes&quot; Best Actor award for the same performance. His completist performance is frequently considered one of the best portrayals of Christ.

In 1978, Powell took the leading role of Richard Hannay in the third film version of &quot;The Thirty Nine Steps&quot;. It met with modest success, and critics compared Powell&#x27;s portrayal of John Buchan&#x27;s character favourably with those of his predecessors. His characterisation proved to be enduring, as almost ten years later a television series entitled simply &quot;Hannay&quot; appeared with Powell back in the role (although the Buchan short stories on which the series was based were set in an earlier period than &quot;The Thirty-Nine Steps&quot;). &quot;Hannay&quot; ran for two seasons.

In 1980, Powell appeared in the film &quot;Harlequin&quot; playing the Harlequin of the title, who seems to have the power to cure the son of a powerful politician. For this performance, he won the Best Actor Award at the Paris Film Festival. In 1982, he won Best Actor at the Venice Film Festival for his role in &quot;Imperativ&quot;.

In 1984, Powell made his U.S. film debut in &quot;What Waits Below&quot; (also known as &quot;Secrets of the Phantom Caverns&quot;).

In 1986, Powell narrated and co-starred in William C. Faure&#x27;s miniseries &quot;Shaka Zulu&quot;, with Henry Cele in the title role. In 1992, he starred in the New Zealand World War I film &quot;Chunuk Bair&quot;, as Sgt Maj Frank Smith. In 1993–95, he was the voice actor of Dr Livesey in &quot;The Legends of Treasure Island&quot;.

Powell then agreed to a request from his friend and golf partner, comedian Jasper Carrott, taking the part of an incompetent detective in a succession of sketches that formed part of Carrott&#x27;s television series. &quot;The Detectives&quot; proved to be popular and was later turned into a sitcom, Powell&#x27;s first and only venture into this genre.

Powell&#x27;s distinctive voice is frequently heard on voice-overs and as a narrator of television programmes such as &quot;Great Crimes and Trials&quot;, &quot;The Century of Warfare&quot; and &quot;World War II in HD Colour&quot;. He read the novel &quot;Love in the Time of Cholera&quot; by Gabriel García Márquez for BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Book at Bedtime&quot;, and has also narrated many audio books including &quot;The Thirty Nine Steps&quot;, abridged versions of many of Alan Garner&#x27;s books, and several abridged novels for The Talking Classics Collection. Powell has also lent his voice to musical works, such as David Bedford&#x27;s album &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot;, or the 2002 rock opera &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot;, by Clive Nolan and Oliver Wakeman, where he played the role of John Watson. He also narrated on two rock albums by Rick Wakeman called &quot;Cost of Living&quot; and &quot;The Gospels&quot; (1987).

On 29 October 2001, a state-of-the-art theatre named after him was opened at the University of Salford. He became a patron of 24:7 Theatre Festival in 2004, and continues to operate in this capacity. In early 2005 he became a regular in the UK TV medical drama, &quot;Holby City&quot;, where he remained for six years before departing to return to theatre. In 2005 Powell began appearing in the BBC soap opera &quot;Holby City&quot;, as a hospital administrator. He said that regular employment in the series helped him make up financial losses caused by the failure of the pension fund he held with The Equitable Life Assurance Society. On 9 February 2008, he performed as narrator in Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;Peter and the Wolf&quot; with the Huddersfield Philharmonic Orchestra with conductor Natalia Luis-Bassa in the North of England. In 2008–09, Powell was series announcer, (19 episodes), on BBC4&#x27;s &quot;The Book Quiz&quot;.

On Easter Sunday 1 April 2018, Powell appeared in a Smithsonian Channel Documentary Series based on his portrayal of the Franco Zeffirelli mini-series Jesus of Nazareth titled, &quot;The Real Jesus of Nazareth&quot;, narrated by Judd Hirsch. Based in Israel, it covered the life of Jesus juxtaposed with segments of the television series in which Powell starred in 1977. The characters who appeared in the series are also discussed and their historical significance uncovered. The series covered 4 segments, each one hour in length dealing with historical elements of the story along with Powell interviewing biblical historians such as Helen Bond and Candida Moss. The 1977 series starring Powell differed in at least two scenes from the Gospel&#x27;s historical account: in the film, the Virgin Mary is shown without the angel of the Annunciation and Jesus carries only the horizontal branch of the Holy Cross to Calvary.

==Personal life==
Powell met his future wife, the Pan&#x27;s People dancer Barbara &quot;Babs&quot; Lord, backstage at the BBC. On 29 August 1975, shortly before he was due to start filming for &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot; on location in Tunisia, the couple were married. On 23 November 1977, they had their son, Barney, followed in 1979 by a daughter, Kate.

The couple later took up sailing as a pastime. Babs Lord participated in the BT Global Yacht Challenge and the Polar race. Both took part, in different yachts, in a round-the-world race in 2000, though Powell himself was present for only one leg of the race.

Powell was a founder member of the Social Democratic Party in 1981, and campaigned alongside Barry Norman on behalf of the party&#x27;s first leader, Roy Jenkins.

==Filmography==
==Other work==
In 1995, Powell was one of the readers of Edward Lear poems on a specially made spoken word audio CD bringing together a collection of Lear&#x27;s nonsense songs.

Powell provided the narration for Clive Nolan and Oliver Wakeman’s 2002 adaptation of &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot; as a progressive rock album.

<doc id="153673" wikidata="Q76930" url="?curid=153673" title="Prince Rupert of the Rhine">
<text>Prince Rupert of the Rhine, Duke of Cumberland, (17 December 1619 (O.S.) [27 December 1619 (N.S.)] – 29 November 1682 (O.S.) [9 December 1682 (N.S)]) was an English-German army officer, admiral, scientist, and colonial governor. He first rose to prominence as a Royalist cavalry commander during the English Civil War. Rupert was the third son of the German Prince Frederick V of the Palatinate and Elizabeth, eldest daughter of King James VI and I of England and Scotland.

Prince Rupert had a varied career. He was a soldier as a child, fighting alongside Dutch forces against Habsburg Spain during the Eighty Years&#x27; War (1568–1648), and against the Holy Roman Emperor in Germany during the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648). Aged 23, he was appointed commander of the Royalist cavalry during the English Civil War, becoming the archetypal &quot;Cavalier&quot; of the war and ultimately the senior Royalist general. He surrendered after the fall of Bristol and was banished from England. He served under King Louis XIV of France against Spain, and then as a Royalist privateer in the Caribbean Sea. Following the Restoration, Rupert returned to England, becoming a senior English naval commander during the Second Anglo-Dutch War and Third Anglo-Dutch War, and serving as the first governor of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. He died in England in 1682, aged 62.

Rupert is considered to have been a quick-thinking and energetic cavalry general, but ultimately undermined by his youthful impatience in dealing with his peers during the Civil War. In the Interregnum, Rupert continued the conflict against Parliament by sea from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean, showing considerable persistence in the face of adversity. As the head of the Royal Navy in his later years, he showed greater maturity and made impressive and long-lasting contributions to the Royal Navy&#x27;s doctrine and development. As colonial governor, Rupert shaped the political geography of modern Canada: the English possession of Rupert&#x27;s Land was created for him to administer as its first governor and one of the founders of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. Rupert&#x27;s varied and numerous scientific and administrative interests, combined with his considerable artistic skills, made him one of the more colourful public figures in England of the Restoration period.

==Parents and ancestry==
Rupert&#x27;s father was Frederick V of the Palatinate, of the Palatinate-Simmern branch of the House of Wittelsbach. As Elector Palatine, Frederick was one of the most important princes of the Holy Roman Empire. He was also head of the Protestant Union, a coalition of Protestant German states. The Palatinate was a wealthy state, and Frederick lived in great luxury.

Frederick&#x27;s mother, Countess Louise Juliana of Nassau, was daughter of William the Silent and half-sister of Maurice, Prince of Orange, who as stadtholders of Holland and other provinces were the leaders of the Dutch Republic.

Rupert&#x27;s mother was Elizabeth Stuart, daughter of King James VI of Scotland and I of England. Thus Rupert was nephew of King Charles I of England and Scotland, and first cousin of King Charles II of England and Scotland, who made him Duke of Cumberland and Earl of Holderness. His sister Electress Sophia was the mother of George I of Great Britain.

Rupert was named in honour of Rupert, King of Germany, a famous Wittelsbach ancestor.

==Early life and exile==
Rupert was born in Prague, Bohemia, in 1619, and was declared a prince by the principality of Lusatia. His father had just been elected king by the largely Protestant estates of Bohemia. This was perceived as an act of rebellion by the Catholic House of Habsburg, who had been kings of Bohemia since 1526, and initiated the Thirty Years&#x27; War. Frederick was not supported by the Protestant Union, and in 1620 was defeated by Emperor Ferdinand II in the Battle of White Mountain. Rupert&#x27;s parents were thus mockingly termed the &quot;Winter King and Queen&quot;. Rupert was almost left behind in the court&#x27;s rush to escape Ferdinand&#x27;s advance on Prague, until courtier Kryštof z Donína (Christopher Dhona) tossed the prince into a carriage at the last moment.

Rupert accompanied his parents to The Hague, where he spent his early years at the &quot;Hof te Wassenaer&quot; (the Wassenaer Court). Rupert&#x27;s mother paid her children little attention even by the standards of the day, apparently preferring her pet monkeys and dogs. Instead, Frederick employed a French couple, Monsieur and Madame de Plessen, as governors to his children. They were raised with a positive attitude towards the Bohemians and the English, and as strict Calvinists. The result was a strict school routine including logic, mathematics, writing, drawing, singing, and playing instruments.

As a child, Rupert was at times badly behaved, &quot;fiery, mischievous, and passionate&quot; and earned himself the nickname &quot;Robert le Diable&quot;, or &quot;Rupert The Devil&quot;. Nonetheless, Rupert proved to be an able student. By the age of three, he could speak some English, Czech, and French, and mastered German while still young; however, he had little interest in Latin and Greek. He excelled in art, being taught by Gerard van Honthorst, and found mathematics and science easy. By the time he was 18 he stood about 6 ft 4 in (1.93 m) tall.

Rupert&#x27;s family continued their attempts to regain the Palatinate during their time in The Hague. Money was short, with the family relying upon a relatively small pension from The Hague, the proceeds from family investments in Dutch raids on Spanish shipping, and revenue from pawned family jewellery. Frederick set about convincing an alliance of nations—including England, France and Sweden — to support his attempts to regain the Palatinate and Bohemia. By the early 1630s, Frederick had built a close relationship with King Gustavus of Sweden, the dominant Protestant leader in Germany. In 1632, however, the two men disagreed over Gustavus&#x27; insistence that Frederick provide equal rights to his Lutheran and Calvinist subjects after regaining his lands; Frederick refused and set off to return to The Hague. He died of a fever along the way and was buried in an unmarked grave.

Rupert had lost his father at the age of 13, and Gustavus&#x27; death at the Battle of Lützen in the same month deprived the family of a critical Protestant ally. With Frederick gone, King Charles proposed that the family move to England; Rupert&#x27;s mother declined, but asked that Charles extend his protection to her remaining children instead.

==Teenage years==

Rupert spent the beginning of his teenage years between the courts of The Hague and that of his uncle, King Charles I, before being captured and imprisoned in Linz during the middle stages of the Thirty Years&#x27; War. Rupert had become a soldier early; at the age of 14 he attended the Dutch &quot;pas d&#x27;armes&quot; with the Protestant Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange. Later that year he fought alongside him and the Duke of Brunswick at the Anglo-German siege of Rheinberg, and by 1635 he was acting as a military lifeguard to Prince Frederick. Rupert went on to fight against imperial Spain in the successful campaign around Breda in 1637 during the Eighty Years&#x27; War in the Netherlands. By the end of this period, Rupert had acquired a reputation for fearlessness in battle, high spirits and considerable industry.

In between these campaigns, Rupert had visited his uncle&#x27;s court in England. The Palatinate cause was a popular Protestant issue in England, and in 1637 a general public subscription helped fund an expedition under Charles Louis to try to regain the electorate as part of a joint French campaign. Rupert was placed in command of a Palatinate cavalry regiment, and his later friend Lord Craven, an admirer of Rupert&#x27;s mother, assisted in raising funds and accompanied the army on the campaign. The campaign ended badly at the Battle of Vlotho (17 October 1638) during the invasion of Westphalia; Rupert escaped death, but was captured by the forces of the Imperial General Melchior von Hatzfeldt towards the end of the battle.

After a failed attempt to bribe his way free of his guards, Rupert was imprisoned in Linz. Lord Craven, also taken in the battle, attempted to persuade his captors to allow him to remain with Rupert, but was refused. Rupert&#x27;s imprisonment was surrounded by religious overtones. His mother was deeply concerned that he might be converted from Calvinism to Catholicism; his captors, encouraged by Emperor Ferdinand III, deployed Jesuit priests in an attempt to convert him. The emperor went further, proffering the option of freedom, a position as an Imperial general and a small principality if Rupert would convert. Rupert refused.

Rupert&#x27;s imprisonment became more relaxed on the advice of the Archduke Leopold, Ferdinand&#x27;s younger brother, who met and grew to like Rupert. Rupert practised etching, played tennis, practised shooting, read military textbooks and was taken on accompanied hunting trips. He also entered into a romantic affair with Susan Kuffstein, the daughter of Count von Kuffstein, his gaoler. He received a present of a rare white poodle that Rupert called Boy or sometimes Pudel, and which remained with him into the English Civil War. Despite attempts by a Franco-Swedish army to seize Linz and free Rupert, his release was ultimately negotiated through Leopold and the Empress Maria Anna; in exchange for a commitment never again to take up arms against the emperor, Rupert would be released. Rupert formally kissed the emperor&#x27;s hand at the end of 1641, turned down a final offer of an imperial command and left Germany for England.

==Career during the First English Civil War==
Rupert is probably best remembered today for his role as a Royalist commander during the English Civil War. He had considerable success during the initial years of the war, his drive, determination and experience of European techniques bringing him early victories. As the war progressed, Rupert&#x27;s youth and lack of maturity in managing his relationships with other Royalist commanders ultimately resulted in his removal from his post and ultimate retirement from the war. Throughout the conflict, however, Rupert also enjoyed a powerful symbolic position: he was an iconic Royalist Cavalier and as such was frequently the subject of both Parliamentarian and Royalist propaganda, an image which has endured over the years.

===Early phases, 1642–1643===
Rupert arrived in England following his period of imprisonment and final release from captivity in Germany. In August 1642, Rupert, along with his brother Prince Maurice and a number of professional soldiers, ran the gauntlet across the sea from the United Provinces, and after one initial failure, evaded the pro-Parliamentary navy and landed in Newcastle. Riding across country, he found the King with a tiny army at Leicester Abbey, and was promptly appointed General of Horse, a coveted appointment at the time in European warfare. Rupert set about recruiting and training: with great effort he had put together a partially trained mounted force of 3,000 cavalry by the end of September. Rupert&#x27;s reputation continued to rise and, leading a sudden, courageous charge, he routed a Parliamentarian force at Powick Bridge, the first military engagement of the war. Although a small engagement, this had a propaganda value far exceeding the importance of the battle itself, and Rupert became an heroic figure for many young men in the Royalist camp.

Rupert joined the King in the advance on London, playing a key role in the resulting Battle of Edgehill in October. Once again, Rupert was at his best with swift battlefield movements; the night before, he had undertaken a forced march and seized the summit of Edgehill, giving the Royalists a superior position. When he quarrelled with his fellow infantry commander, Robert Bertie, however, some of the weaknesses of Rupert&#x27;s character began to display themselves. Rupert vigorously interjected—probably correctly, but certainly tactlessly—that Lindsey should deploy his men in the modern Swedish fashion that Rupert was used to in Europe, which would have maximised their available firepower. The result was an argument in front of the troops and Lindsey&#x27;s resignation and replacement by Sir Jacob Astley. In the subsequent battle Rupert&#x27;s men made a dramatic cavalry charge, but despite his best efforts a subsequent scattering and loss of discipline turned a potential victory into a stalemate.

After Edgehill, Rupert asked Charles for a swift cavalry attack on London before the Earl of Essex&#x27;s army could return. The King&#x27;s senior counsellors, however, urged him to advance slowly on the capital with the whole army. By the time they arrived, the city had organised defences against them. Some argue that, in delaying, the Royalists had perhaps lost their best chance of winning the war, although others have argued that Rupert&#x27;s proposed attack would have had trouble penetrating a hostile London. Instead, early in 1643, Rupert began to clear the South-West, taking Cirencester in February before moving further against Bristol, a key port. Rupert took Bristol in July with his brother Maurice using Cornish forces and was appointed governor of the city. By mid-1643, Rupert had become so well known that he was an issue in any potential peace accommodation—Parliament was seeking to see him punished as part of any negotiated solution, and the presence of Rupert at the court, close to the King during the negotiations, was perceived as a bellicose statement in itself.

===Later stages, 1644–1646===
During the second half of the war, political opposition within the Royalist senior leadership against Prince Rupert continued to grow. His personality during the war had made him both friends and enemies. He enjoyed a &quot;frank and generous disposition&quot;, showed a &quot;quickness of... intellect&quot;, was prepared to face grave dangers, and could be thorough and patient when necessary. However, Prince Rupert lacked the social gifts of a courtier, and his humour could turn into a &quot;sardonic wit and a contemptuous manner&quot;: with a hasty temper, he was too quick to say whom he respected and whom he disliked. The result was that, while he could inspire great loyalty in some, especially with his men, he also made many enemies at the Royal court. When Prince Rupert took Bristol, he also slighted the Marquess of Hertford, the lethargic but politically significant Royalist leader of the South-West. Most critically, he fell out with George Digby, a favourite of both the King and the Queen. Digby was a classic courtier and Rupert fell to arguing with him repeatedly in meetings. The result was that towards the end of the war Prince Rupert&#x27;s position at court was increasingly undermined by his enemies.

Rupert continued to impress militarily. By 1644, now the Duke of Cumberland and Earl of Holderness, he led the relief of Newark, as well as York and its castle. Having marched north, taking Bolton and Liverpool along the way in two bloody assaults, Rupert then intervened in Yorkshire in two highly effective manoeuvres, in the first outwitting the enemy forces at Newark with speed; in the second, striking across country and approaching York from the north. Rupert then commanded much of the royalist army at its defeat at Marston Moor, with much of the blame falling on the poor working relationship between Rupert and the Marquess of Newcastle, and orders from the King that wrongly conveyed a desperate need for a speedy success in the north.

In November 1644, Rupert was appointed general of the entire Royalist army, which increased already marked tensions between him and a number of the King&#x27;s councillors. By May 1645, and now desperately short of supplies, Rupert captured Leicester, but suffered a severe reversal at the Battle of Naseby a month later. Although Rupert had counselled the King against accepting battle at Naseby, the opinions of Digby had won the day in council: nonetheless, Rupert&#x27;s defeat damaged him, rather than Digby, politically. After Naseby, Rupert regarded the Royalist cause as lost, and urged Charles to conclude a peace with Parliament. Charles, still supported by an optimistic Digby, believed he could win the war. By late summer, Prince Rupert had become trapped in Bristol by Parliamentary forces. Faced with an impossible military situation on the ground, Rupert surrendered Bristol in September 1645, and Charles dismissed him from his service and command.

Rupert responded by making his way across Parliamentary held territory to the King at Newark with Prince Maurice and around a hundred men, fighting their way through smaller enemy units and evading larger ones. King Charles attempted to order Rupert to desist, fearing an armed coup, but Rupert arrived at the royal court anyway. After a difficult meeting, Rupert convinced the King to hold a court-martial over his conduct at Bristol, which exonerated him and Maurice. After a final argument over the fate of his friend Richard Willis, the governor of Newark, who had let Rupert into the royal court to begin with, Rupert resigned and left the service of King Charles, along with most of his best cavalry officers. Earlier interpretations of this event focused on Rupert&#x27;s concern for his honour in the face of his initial dismissal by the King; later works have highlighted the practical importance of the courts martial to Rupert&#x27;s future employability as a mercenary in Europe, given that Rupert knew that the war by this point was effectively lost. Rupert and Maurice spent the winter of 1645 in Woodstock, examining options for employment under the Republic of Venice, before returning to Oxford and the King in 1646. Rupert and the King were reconciled, the Prince remaining to defend Oxford when the King left for the north. After the ensuing siege and surrender of Oxford in 1646, Parliament banished both Rupert and his brother from England.

===Reputation===

Rupert&#x27;s contemporaries believed him to have been involved in some of the bloodier events of the war. Rupert had grown up surrounded by the relatively savage customs of the Thirty Years&#x27; War in Europe. Shortly after his arrival in England he caused consternation by following similar practices; one of his early acts was to demand two thousand pounds from the people of Leicester for the King as the price of not sacking Leicester. Although in keeping with European practices, this was not considered appropriate behaviour in England and Rupert was reprimanded by the King.

Rupert&#x27;s reputation never truly recovered, and in subsequent sieges and attacks he was frequently accused of acting without restraint. Birmingham, a key arms producing town, was taken in April 1643, and Rupert faced allegations—probably untrue—of wilfully burning the town to the ground (see the Battle of Camp Hill). Shortly afterwards Rupert attempted to take the town of Lichfield, whose garrison had executed Royalist prisoners, angrily promising to kill all the soldiers inside. Only the urgent call for assistance from the King prevented him from doing so, forcing him to agree to more lenient terms in exchange for a prompt surrender. Towards the end of the war, practices were changing for the worse across all sides; a rebellious Leicester was retaken by the Prince in May 1645, and no attempt was made to limit the subsequent killing and plunder.

Rupert was accordingly a prominent figure in Parliamentary propaganda. He faced numerous accusations of witchcraft, either personally or by proxy through his pet dog, Boy, sometimes called Pudel, a large white hunting poodle which accompanied Rupert everywhere from 1642 up until the dog&#x27;s death at Marston Moor and which was suspected of being a witch&#x27;s familiar. There were numerous accounts of Boy&#x27;s abilities; some suggested that he was the Devil in disguise, come to help Rupert. Pro-Royalist publications ultimately produced parodies of these, including one which listed Rupert&#x27;s dog as being a &quot;Lapland Lady&quot; transformed into a white dog; Boy was able, apparently, to find hidden treasure, possessed invulnerability to attack, could catch bullets fired at Rupert in his mouth, and could prophesy as well as the 16th-century soothsayer, Mother Shipton. Similar stories from the period relate to Rupert&#x27;s pet monkey. Like his dog, the monkey was featured in newsprint of the day and was also reputed to have shapeshifting powers, being able to disguise itself behind enemy lines.

==Second English Civil War and Interregnum==
After the end of the First English Civil War Rupert was employed by the young King Louis XIV of France to fight the Spanish during the final years of the Thirty Years&#x27; War. Rupert&#x27;s military employment was complicated by his promises to the Holy Roman Emperor that had led to his release from captivity in 1642, and his ongoing commitment to the English Royalist faction in exile. He also became a Knight of the Garter in 1642. Throughout the period Rupert was inconvenienced by his lack of secure income, and his ongoing feuds with other leading members of the Royalist circle.

===Service in the French army===

Rupert first travelled to the Royal court in exile at St Germain but found it still dominated by the Queen and her favourite, Rupert&#x27;s enemy Digby. Instead, Rupert moved on, accepting a well paid commission from Anne of Austria to serve Louis XIV as a &quot;mareschal de camp&quot;, subject to Rupert being free to leave French service to fight for King Charles, should he be called upon to do so. In 1647, Rupert fought under Marshal Jean de Gassion against the Spanish. After a three-week siege, Rupert took the powerful fortress of La Bassée through quiet negotiations with the enemy commander—an impressive accomplishment, and one that won him favour in French court circles. Gassion and Rupert were ambushed shortly afterwards by a Spanish party; during the resulting fight, Rupert was shot in the head and seriously injured. Afterwards, Gassion noted: &quot;Monsieur, I am most annoyed that you are wounded.&quot; &quot;And me also,&quot; Rupert is recorded as replying. Gassion was himself killed shortly afterwards, and Rupert returned to St Germain to recuperate.

===Service in the Royalist navy===

In 1648, the relatively brief Second English Civil War broke out, and Rupert informed the French King that he would be returning to King Charles&#x27;s service. The Parliamentary navy mutinied in favour of the King and sailed for Holland, providing the Royalists with a major fleet for the first time since the start of the civil conflict; Rupert joined the fleet under the command of the Duke of York, who assumed the rank of Lord High Admiral.

Rupert argued that the fleet should be used to rescue the King, then being held prisoner on the Isle of Wight, while others advised sailing in support of the fighting in the north. The fleet itself rapidly lost discipline, with many vessels&#x27; crews focussing on seizing local ships and cargoes. This underlined a major problem for the Royalists—the cost of maintaining the new fleet was well beyond their means. Discipline continued to deteriorate and Rupert had to intervene personally several times, including defusing one group of mutinous sailors by suddenly dangling the ringleader over the side of his vessel and threatening to drop him into the sea. Most of the fleet finally switched sides once more, returning to England in late 1648.

Then, following a degree of reconciliation with Charles, Rupert obtained command of the Royalist fleet himself. The intention was to restore Royalist finances by using the remaining vessels of the fleet to conduct a campaign of organised piracy against English shipping across the region. One of the obstacles that this plan faced was the growing strength of the Parliamentary fleet and the presence of Robert Blake, one of the finest admirals of the period, as Rupert&#x27;s opponent during the campaign.
Rupert&#x27;s naval campaign formed two phases. The first involved the Royalist fleet sailing from Kinsale in Ireland to Lisbon in Portugal. He took three large ships, , the &quot;Convertine&quot; and the &quot;Swallow&quot;, accompanied by four smaller vessels. Rupert sailed to Lisbon taking several prizes en route, where he received a warm welcome from King John IV, the ruler of recently independent Portugal, who was a supporter of Charles II. Blake arrived shortly afterwards with a Parliamentary fleet, and an armed stand-off ensued. Tensions rose, skirmishes began to break out and King John became increasingly keen for his Royalist guests to leave. In October 1650, Rupert&#x27;s fleet, now comprising six vessels, broke out and headed into the Mediterranean. Still pursued by Blake, the Royalist fleet manoeuvred up the Spanish coast, steadily losing vessels to their pursuers.

The second phase of the campaign then began. Rupert crossed back into the Atlantic and, during 1651, cut west to the Azores, capturing vessels as he went. He intended to continue on to the West Indies, where there would be many rich targets. Instead he encountered a late summer storm, leading to the sinking of the &quot;Constant Reformation&quot; with the loss of 333 lives—almost including Rupert&#x27;s brother, Prince Maurice, who only just escaped — and a great deal of captured treasure. Turning back to regroup, repair and re-equip in early 1652, Rupert&#x27;s reduced force moored at Cape Blanc, an island near what is now Mauritania. Rupert took the opportunity to explore and acquired a Moorish servant boy, who remained in his service for many years. Rupert also explored 150 miles up the Gambia River, taking two Spanish vessels as prizes and contracting malaria in the process.

Rupert then finally made a successful crossing into the Caribbean, landing first at Saint Lucia, before continuing up the chain of the Antilles to the Virgin Islands. There the fleet was hit by a hurricane, which scattered the ships and sank the &quot;Defiance&quot;, this time with Prince Maurice on board. It was a while before Maurice&#x27;s death became certain, which came as a terrible blow to Rupert. He was forced to return to Europe, arriving in France in March 1653 with a fleet of five ships. It became clear, as the profits and losses of the piracy campaign were calculated, that the venture had not been as profitable as hoped. This complicated tensions in the Royalist court, and Charles II and Rupert eventually split the spoils, after which Rupert, tired and a little bitter, returned to France to recuperate from the long campaign.

In 1654, Rupert appears to have been involved in a plot to assassinate Oliver Cromwell, an event that would then have been followed by a coup, the landing of a small army in Sussex, and the restoration of Charles II. Charles himself is understood to have rejected the assassination proposal, but three conspirators—who implicated Rupert in the plan—were arrested and confessed in London.

Rupert&#x27;s presence at the royal court continued to be problematic; as in 1643, he was regarded by Edward Hyde (later Earl of Clarendon) and others as a bellicose figure and an obstacle to peace negotiations; in 1655 Rupert left for Germany.

===Service in Germany===

After his quarrel with the Royalist court in exile, Rupert travelled to Heidelberg to visit his brother Charles Louis, now partially restored as Elector Palatine, where the two had an ambivalent reunion. Charles Louis and Rupert had not been friendly as children and had almost ended up on opposite sides during the Civil War. To make matters worse, Charles Louis had been deprived of half the old Palatinate under the Peace of Westphalia, leaving him badly short of money, although he still remained responsible under the Imperial laws of apanage for providing for his younger brother and had offered the sum of £375 per annum, which Rupert had accepted. Rupert travelled on to Vienna, where he attempted to claim the £15,000 compensation allocated to him under the Peace of Westphalia from the Emperor. Ferdinand III warmly welcomed him, but was unable to pay such a sum immediately—instead, he would have to pay in installments, to the disadvantage of Rupert.

Over the next twelve months, Rupert was asked by the Duke of Modena in Northern Italy to raise an army against the Papal States—having done so, and with the army stationed in the Palatinate, the enterprise collapsed, with the Duke requesting that Rupert invade Spanish held Milan instead. Rupert moved on, having placed his brother Charles Louis in some diplomatic difficulties with Spain. Rupert travelled onwards, continuing to attempt to convince Ferdinand to back Charles II&#x27;s efforts to regain his throne.

In 1656, relations between Rupert and Charles Louis deteriorated badly. Rupert had fallen in love with Louise von Degenfeld, one of his sister-in-law&#x27;s maids of honour. One of Rupert&#x27;s notes proffering his affections accidentally fell into the possession of Charles Louis&#x27; wife Charlotte, who believed it was written to her. Charlotte was keen to engage in an affair with Rupert and became unhappy when she was declined and the mistake explained. Degenfeld was uninterested in Rupert, but was engaged in an affair with Charles Louis; this was discovered in due course, leading to the annulment of the marriage. Rupert, for his part, was unhappy that Charles Louis could not endow him with a suitable estate, and the two parted on bad terms in 1657, Rupert refusing ever to return to the Palatinate again and taking up employment under Ferdinand III in his Kingdom of Hungary.

===Interest in art===
During this period Rupert became closely involved in the development of mezzotint, a &quot;negative&quot; or intaglio printmaking process which eventually superseded the older woodcut process. Rupert appears to have told a range of associates that he had conceived of the mezzotint process through having watched a soldier scrape the rust from the barrel of his musket during a military campaign. John Evelyn credited Rupert as the inventor of the technique in 1662, and Rupert&#x27;s story was further popularised by Horace Walpole during the 18th century.
Considerable academic debate surrounds the issue, but the modern consensus is that mezzotint was instead invented in 1642 by Ludwig von Siegen, a German lieutenant-colonel who was also an amateur artist. Siegen may or may not have met Rupert: Siegen had worked as chamberlain, and probably part-tutor, to Rupert&#x27;s young cousin William VI, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel, with whom Rupert discussed the technique in letters from 1654. Rupert did, however, become a noted artist in mezzotint in his own right. He produced a few stylish prints in the technique, mostly interpretations of existing paintings, and introduced the form to England after the Restoration, though it was Wallerant Vaillant, Rupert&#x27;s artistic assistant or tutor, who first popularised the process and exploited it commercially. Rupert&#x27;s most famous and largest art work, &quot;The Great Executioner&quot;, produced in 1658, is still regarded by critics such as Arthur Hind and Antony Griffiths as full of &quot;brilliance and energy&quot;, &quot;superb&quot; and &quot;one of the greatest mezzotints&quot; ever produced; other important works by Rupert include the &quot;Head of Titian&quot; and &quot;The Standard Bearer&quot;.

==Career following the Restoration==
Following the Restoration of the monarchy under Charles II in 1660, Rupert returned to England, where Charles had already largely completed the process of balancing the different factions across the country in a new administration. Since most of the better government posts were already taken, Rupert&#x27;s employment was limited, although Charles rewarded him with the second highest pension he had granted, £4,000 a year. Rupert&#x27;s close family ties to King Charles were critical to his warm reception; following the deaths of the Duke of Gloucester and Princess Mary, Rupert was the King&#x27;s closest adult relation in England after his brother, the Duke of York, and so a key member of the new regime. Rupert, as the Duke of Cumberland, resumed his seat in the House of Lords. For the first time in his life, Rupert&#x27;s financial position was relatively secure, and he had matured. Near-contemporaries described how &quot;his temper was less explosive than formerly and his judgement sounder&quot;. Rupert continued to serve as an admiral in the Royal Navy throughout the period, ultimately rising to the rank of &quot;General at Sea and Land&quot;.

===Restoration statesman===
Rupert was appointed to the King&#x27;s Privy Council in 1662, taking roles on the Foreign Affairs Committee, the Admiralty Committee and the Tangier Committee. Accounts vary of Rupert&#x27;s role in all these committees of government. Samuel Pepys, no friend of Rupert&#x27;s, sat on the Tangier Committee with him and later declared that all Rupert did was to laugh and swear occasionally: other records, such as those of the Foreign Affairs Committee, show him taking a full and active role in proceedings.

In 1668, the King appointed Rupert to be the Constable of Windsor Castle. Rupert was already one of the Knights of the Garter, who had their headquarters at the castle, and was a close companion of the King, who would wish to be suitably entertained at the castle. Rupert immediately began to reorder the castle&#x27;s defences, sorting out the garrison&#x27;s accommodation, repairing the Devil&#x27;s Tower, reconstructing the real tennis court and improving the castle&#x27;s hunting estate. Rupert acquired his own apartments in the castle, which were recorded as being &quot;very singular&quot; with some decorated with an &quot;extraordinary&quot; number of &quot;pikes, muskets, pistols, bandoliers, holsters, drums, back, breast, and head pieces&quot;, and his inner chambers &quot;hung with tapisserie, curious and effeminate pictures&quot;. King Charles II and Rupert spent much time together over the years hunting and playing tennis together at Windsor, and Rupert was also a close companion of James, the Duke of York. Rupert was considered by Pepys to be among the four best tennis players in England.

Rupert became romantically engaged to Frances Bard (1646–1708), the daughter of the English explorer and Civil War veteran Henry Bard. Frances claimed to have secretly married Rupert in 1664, although this was denied by him and no firm proof exists to support the claim. Rupert acknowledged the son he had with Frances, Dudley Bard (1666–86), often called &quot;Dudley Rupert&quot;, who was schooled at Eton College. In 1673, Rupert was urged by Charles Louis to return home, marry and father an heir to the Palatinate, as it appeared likely that Charles Louis&#x27;s own son would not survive childhood. Rupert refused, and remained in England.

===Career in the Restoration navy===
For much of the 17th century, England was embroiled in conflict with commercial rival Holland through the Anglo-Dutch Wars. Rupert became closely involved in these as a senior admiral to King Charles II, rising to command the Royal Navy by the end of his career. Although several famous admirals of the day had previously been army commanders, including Blake and Monck, they had commanded relatively small land forces and Rupert was still relatively unusual for the period in having both practical experience of commanding large land armies and having extensive naval experience from his campaigns in the 1650s.

At the start of the Second Anglo-Dutch War (1665–1667), Rupert was appointed as one of the three squadron commanders of the English fleet, under the overall command of the Duke of York, taking as his flagship. As the commander of the White Squadron, Rupert fought at the Battle of Lowestoft in 1665, breaking through the enemy defences at a critical moment; Rupert&#x27;s leg was injured in the battle, an injury that caused him ongoing pain. Recalled to accompany the King during the plague that was sweeping London, Rupert continued to argue in favour of the fleet&#x27;s seeking a set-piece engagement with the Dutch that would force the Dutch back to the negotiating table. The following year, Rupert was made joint commander of the fleet with Monck and given the opportunity to put this plan into practice. In June 1666, they fought the Dutch at the Four Days&#x27; Battle, one of the longest naval battles in history; the battle saw the new aggressive tactics of Rupert and Monck applied, resulting in &quot;a sight unique till then in sailing-ship warfare, the English beating upwind and breaking the enemy&#x27;s line from leeward.&quot; However, the Four Days&#x27; Battle was considered a victory for the Dutch, but the St. James&#x27;s Day Battle the following month allowed Rupert and Monck to use the same tactics to inflict heavy damage on the Dutch and the battle resulted in a significant English victory. The Dutch however would see a favourable end to the war with the decisive Raid on the Medway.

Rupert also played a prominent role in the Third Anglo-Dutch War (1672–74). This time Louis XIV of France was a key English ally against Holland, and it was decided that the French would form a squadron in a combined fleet. The English fleet had been much expanded, and Rupert had three ships, , and , equipped with a high-specification, annealed and lathe-produced gun of his own design, the &quot;Rupertinoe&quot;. The cost of the weapon—three times that of a normal gun—prevented its wider deployment in the fleet. The French role in the conflict proved a problem when Charles turned to the appointment of an admiral. Rupert&#x27;s objection to the French alliance was well known, and accordingly the King appointed the Duke of York to the role instead. Rupert was instead instructed to take over the Duke&#x27;s work at the Admiralty, which he did with gusto. The Allied naval plans were stalled after the Duke&#x27;s inconclusive battle with the Dutch at Solebay.
The English plan for 1673 centred on first achieving naval dominance, followed by landing an army in Zeeland. The King appointed the Duke as supreme commander, with Rupert as his deputy, combining the ranks of general and vice admiral of England. During the winter of 1672, however, Charles—still (legitimately) childless—decided that the risk to the Duke, his heir, was too great and made Rupert supreme Allied commander in his place. Rupert began the 1673 campaign against the Dutch knowing the logistical support for his fleet remained uncertain, with many ships undermanned. The result was the Battle of Schooneveld in June and the Battle of Texel in August, a controversial sequence of engagements in which, at a minimum, poor communications between the French and English commanders assisted the Dutch victories. Many English commentators were harsher, blaming the French for failing to fully engage in the battles and Rupert—having cautioned against the alliance in the first place—was popularly hailed as a hero. Rupert finally retired from active seagoing command later that year.

Rupert had a characteristic style as an admiral; he relied upon &quot;energetic personal leadership backed by close contact with his officers&quot;; having decided how to proceed in a naval campaign, however, it could be difficult for his staff to change his mind. Recent work on Rupert&#x27;s role as a commander has also highlighted the progress the prince made in formulating the way that orders were given to the British fleet. Fleet communications were limited during the period, and the traditional orders from admirals before a battle were accordingly quite rigid, limiting a captain&#x27;s independence in the battle. Rupert played a key part in the conferences held by the Duke of York in 1665 to review tactics and operational methods from the First Anglo-Dutch War, and put these into practice before the St James Day battle. These instructions and supplementary instructions to ships&#x27; captains, which attempted to balance an adherence to standing orders with the need to exploit emerging opportunities in a battle, proved heavily influential over the next hundred years and shaped the idea that an aggressive fighting spirit should be at the core of British naval doctrine.

After 1673, Rupert remained a senior member of the Royal Navy and Charles&#x27;s administration. Rupert allied himself with Lord Shaftesbury on matters of foreign policy, but remained loyal to King Charles II on other issues, and was passionate about protecting the royal prerogative. As a consequence, he opposed Parliament&#x27;s plan in 1677 to appoint him to Lord High Admiral—on the basis that only the King should be allowed to propose such appointments—but noted that he was willing to become Admiral if the King wished him to do so. The King&#x27;s solution was to establish a small, empowered Admiralty Commission, of which Rupert became the first commissioner. As a result, from 1673 to 1679 Rupert was able to focus on ensuring a closer regulation of manning, gunning and the selection of officers. He was also involved in setting priorities between the different theatres of operations that the Royal Navy was now involved in around the world. Rupert was also appointed to the supreme position of &quot;General at Sea and Land&quot;, effectively assuming the wartime powers of the Lord High Admiral.

==Later life==
After the end of his seagoing naval career, Rupert continued to be actively involved in both government and science, although he was increasingly removed from current politics. To the younger members of the court, the prince appeared increasingly distant—almost from a different era. The Count de Gramont described Rupert as &quot;brave and courageous even to rashness, but cross-grained and incorrigibly obstinate... he was polite, even to excess, unseasonably; but haughty, and even brutal, when he ought to have been gentle and courteous... his manners were ungracious: he had a dry hard-favoured visage, and a stern look, even when he wished to please; but, when he was out of humour, he was the true picture of reproof&quot;. Rupert&#x27;s health during this period was also less robust; his head wound from his employment in France required a painful trepanning treatment, his leg wound continued to hurt and he still suffered from the malaria he had caught while in the Gambia.

===Colonial administration===
Rupert had demonstrated an interest in colonial issues for many years. On arriving in England in 1663, he had encouraged the government to continue his own exploration of the Gambia in an attempt to find gold, leading to Robert Holmes&#x27;s expedition the following year. Rupert was an active shareholder in the Company of Royal Adventurers Trading into Africa that was established as a result in 1662. The company continued operations for the next eight years, with backers including the King, the Duke of York and the Royal Society, with operations including engaging in the West African slave trade until it folded in 1670. The company&#x27;s operations merged with those of the Gambia Merchants&#x27; Company into the new Royal African Company, with a royal charter to right to set up forts and factories, maintain troops, and exercise martial law in West Africa, in pursuit of trade in gold, silver, and slaves; Rupert was the third named member of the company&#x27;s board.

By then, however, Rupert&#x27;s attention had turned to North America. The French explorers Pierre-Esprit Radisson and Médard des Groseilliers had come to England after conducting a joint exploration of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay region in 1659; there their account attracted the attention of the King and Rupert. Rupert put an initial investment of £270 of his own money into a proposal for a fresh expedition and set about raising more; despite setbacks, including the Great Fire of London, by 1667 he had formed a private syndicate and leased the &quot;Eaglet&quot; from the King for the expedition. The &quot;Eaglet&quot; failed, but her sister vessel, the &quot;Nonsuch&quot;, made a successful expedition, returning in 1669 with furs worth . In 1670, the King approved the charter for &quot;The Governor and Company of Adventurers of England trading into Hudson&#x27;s Bay&quot; that would form the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, which was granted a trading monopoly in the whole Hudson Bay watershed area, an immense territory named Rupert&#x27;s Land, with Rupert appointed the first Governor. Rupert&#x27;s first company secretary was Sir James Hayes and Radisson named the Hayes River, in present-day Manitoba, in his honour. The company continued to prosper, forming the basis for much of the commercial activity of colonial Canada. Rupert&#x27;s role in colonial commerce was marked by his being asked to lay the cornerstone of the new Royal Exchange in 1670, and being made one of its first councillors.

===Science and the Royal Society===

After Rupert&#x27;s retirement from active seafaring in around 1674, he was able to spend more time engaged in scientific research and became credited with many inventions and discoveries, although some subsequently turned out to be the innovative introduction of European inventions into England. Rupert converted some of the apartments at Windsor Castle to a luxury laboratory, complete with forges, instruments, and raw materials, from where he conducted a range of experiments.

Rupert had already become the third founding member of the scientific Royal Society, being referred to by contemporaries as a &quot;philosophic warrior&quot;, and guided the Society as a Councillor during its early years. Very early on in the Society&#x27;s history, Rupert demonstrated Prince Rupert&#x27;s drops to King Charles II and the Society, glass teardrops which explode when the tail is cracked; although credited with their invention at the time, later interpretations suggest that he was instead responsible for the introduction of an existing European discovery into England. He demonstrated a new device for lifting water at the Royal Society, and received attention for his process for &quot;painting colours on marble, which, when polished, became permanent&quot;. During this time, Rupert also formulated a mathematical question concerning the paradox that a cube can pass through a slightly smaller cube; Rupert questioned how large a cube had to be in order to fit. The question of Prince Rupert&#x27;s cube was first solved by the Dutch mathematician Pieter Nieuwland. Rupert was also known for his success in breaking cypher codes.

Many of Rupert&#x27;s inventions were military. After designing the &quot;Rupertinoe&quot; naval gun, Rupert erected a watermill on Hackney Marshes for a revolutionary method of boring guns; however, his secret died with him, and the enterprise failed. Rupert enjoyed other military problems, and took to manufacturing gun locks; he devised both a gun that fired multiple rounds at high speed, and a &quot;handgun with rotating barrels&quot;. He is credited with the invention of a form of gunpowder, which when demonstrated to the Royal Society in 1663, had a force of over ten times that of regular powder; a better method for using gunpowder in mining; and a torpedo. He also developed a form of grapeshot for use by artillery. Rupert also focussed on naval inventions: he devised a balancing mechanism to allow improved quadrant measurements at sea, and produced a diving engine for retrieving objects on the ocean floor. While recovering from his trepanning treatment Rupert set about inventing new surgical equipment to improve future operations.

Other parts of Rupert&#x27;s scientific work lay in the field of metallurgy. Rupert invented a new brass alloy, slightly darker in hue than regular brass involving three parts of copper to one part of zinc, combined with charcoal; this became known as &quot;Prince&#x27;s metal&quot; in his honour—sometimes also referred to as &quot;Bristol Brass&quot;. Rupert invented the alloy in order to improve naval artillery, but it also became used as a replacement for gold in decorations. Rupert was also credited with having devised an exceptional method for tempering kirby fish hooks, and for casting objects into an appearance of perspective. He also invented an improved method for manufacturing shot of varying sizes in 1663, that was later refined by the scientist Robert Hooke, one of Rupert&#x27;s Royal Society friends during the period. In particular he is credited with developing the process of casting tiny lead pellets or birdshot by pouring molten lead through a colander or sieve and allowing the droplets to fall several inches into water. Such shot found on archaeological sites, frequently on 17th- and 18th-century shipwrecks, are often referred to as Rupert shot by archaeologists.

==Family==
Towards the end of his life Rupert fell in love with an attractive Drury Lane actress named Margaret &quot;Peg&quot; Hughes. Rupert became involved with her during the late 1660s, leaving his previous mistress, Frances Bard, with whom he had a son, Dudley; although Hughes appears to have held out from reciprocating his attentions with the aim of negotiating a suitable settlement. Hughes rapidly received advancement through his patronage; she became a member of the King&#x27;s Company by 1669, giving her status and immunity from arrest for debt, and was painted four times by Sir Peter Lely, the foremost court artist of the day.

Despite being encouraged to do so, Rupert did not marry Hughes, but acknowledged their daughter, Ruperta (born in 1673 and who later became Mrs Emanuel Howe). Hughes lived an expensive lifestyle during the 1670s, enjoying gambling and jewels; Rupert gave her at least £20,000 worth of jewellery during their relationship, including several items from the Palatinate royal collection. Hughes continued to act even after Ruperta&#x27;s birth, returning to the stage in 1676 with the prestigious Duke&#x27;s Company at the Dorset Garden Theatre, near the Strand in London. The next year Rupert established Hughes with a &quot;grand building&quot; worth £25,000 that he bought in Hammersmith from Sir Nicholas Crispe. Rupert seems rather to have enjoyed the family lifestyle, commenting that his young daughter &quot;already rules the whole house and sometimes argues with her mother, which makes us all laugh.&quot;

==Death==
Rupert died at his house at Spring Gardens, Westminster, on 29 November 1682 after a bout of pleurisy, and was buried in the Mary, Queen of Scots vault at Westminster Abbey on 6 December in a state funeral. Rupert left most of his estate, worth some £12,000, equally to Hughes and Ruperta. Hughes had an &quot;uncomfortable widowhood&quot; without Rupert&#x27;s support, allegedly not helped by her unproductive gambling.

Presents from Rupert such as his mother&#x27;s earrings were sold to the Duchess of Marlborough, while a pearl necklace given by Elector Frederick to Electress Elizabeth was sold to fellow actress Nell Gwynn. Hughes sold the house in Hammersmith to two London merchants: Timothy Lannoy and George Treadwell—it was then purchased by the Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach and became known as Brandenburg (or Brandenburgh) House.

Ruperta later married Emanuel Howe, future MP and English general, and had five children, Sophia, William, Emanuel, James and Henrietta. Through William&#x27;s daughter, Mary, Rupert is an ancestor of the Bromley baronets.

Rupert&#x27;s son, Dudley Bard, became a military officer, frequently known as &quot;Captain Rupert&quot;, and died fighting at the siege of Buda while in his late teens.

==Legacy==
According to Ian Gentles:

Prince Rupert&#x27;s memory is well attested in the geography of Canada. The lands of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, being all the land drained by rivers flowing into Hudson Bay, were known as Rupert&#x27;s Land from 1670 until 1870. The Anglican Diocese of Rupert&#x27;s Land, based in Winnipeg, Manitoba, is the relic of this period, as are Prince Rupert Avenue, Rupert Avenue, and Rupertsland Avenue in Winnipeg.

Elsewhere in Canada, the city of Prince Rupert, British Columbia, the community of Prince Rupert in the city of Edmonton, Alberta and the Rupert River in Quebec are all named after the Prince. Rupert&#x27;s Bay on St Helena may also be named after him. In Bristol, there was also a street, Rupert Street, and formerly a public house, The Prince Rupert in Rupert Street, named to commemorate Prince Rupert.
A secondary school for children of military personnel living in British Forces Germany was named Prince Rupert School named after Prince Rupert.

<text>Thomas Bradwardine (c. 1300 – 26 August 1349) was an English cleric, scholar, mathematician, physicist, courtier and, very briefly, Archbishop of Canterbury. As a celebrated scholastic philosopher and doctor of theology, he is often called Doctor Profundus (medieval epithet, meaning &quot;the Profound Doctor&quot; or &quot;the Profound Teacher&quot;).

==Life==
Sources vary about Bradwardine&#x27;s early life before receiving his degree in 1321. His exact date of birth is unknown but sources point to a date between 1290 and 1300. His place of birth is also unknown but some sources point to it being near Chichester, Sussex, or Harfield. The first concrete sources of his do not appear until he received his degree in 1321 from Balliol College, Oxford. Thomas Bradwardine became a Fellow of Merton College in Oxford, and was awarded his B.A. in August 1321. Bradwardine stayed at Merton College until 1333, when he was appointed Canon of Lincoln, and in 1337 he was appointed the chaplain of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. His involvement with the ecclesiastical began in September 1333, when he was made the Canon of Lincoln. It is less corroborated by sources but it is stated that Bradwardine may have been the Bishop of Durham between 1335 and 1337. It is rumoured that this move to Durham helped put him into contact with King Edward III, which would lead to his eventual appointment of Chaplain of Old St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in London.

He acquired several degrees from Oxford, it is presumed he acquired them on these dates: B.A. by August 1321, an M.A. by 1323, a B.Th. by 1330, and a D.Th. by 1348.

Bradwardine was a precocious student, educated at Balliol College, Oxford, where he was a fellow by 1321; he took the degree of doctor of divinity, and acquired the reputation of a profound scholar, a skilful mathematician and an able theologian. He was also a gifted logician with theories on the &quot;insolubles&quot; and in particular the liar paradox.

Bradwardine subsequently moved to Merton College, Oxford on a fellowship. He was afterwards raised to the high offices of chancellor of the university and professor of divinity. Bradwardine (like his contemporary William of Ockham) was a culminating figure of the great intellectual movement at Oxford that had begun in the 1240s. 

Bradwardine was an ordinary secular cleric, which gave him intellectual freedom but deprived him of the security and wherewithal that the Preaching Orders would have afforded; instead he turned to royal patronage. From being chancellor of the diocese of London as Dean of St Paul&#x27;s, he became chaplain and confessor to Edward III, whom he attended during his wars in France at the Battle of Crécy, where he preached at the victory Mass, and at the subsequent siege of Calais. Edward repeatedly entrusted him with diplomatic missions. On his return to England, he was successively appointed prebendary of Lincoln and dean (1348). In 1349 the canons of the chapter at Canterbury elected him Archbishop following the death of Archbishop John Stratford, but Edward III withheld his consent, preferring his chancellor John de Ufford, perhaps loth to lose his trusted confessor. After Ufford died of the Black Death, 2 May, Bradwardine went to receive confirmation from Pope Clement VI at Avignon, but on his return he died of the plague at Rochester on 26 August 1349, forty days after his consecration. He was buried at Canterbury.

Chaucer in The Nun&#x27;s Priest&#x27;s Tale (line 476) ranks Bradwardine with Augustine and Boethius. His great theological work, to modern eyes, is a treatise against the Pelagians, entitled &quot;De causa Dei contra Pelagium et de virtute causarum&quot;. Bradwardine&#x27;s major treatise argued that space was an infinite void in which God could have created other worlds, which he would rule as he ruled this one. The &quot;causes of virtue&quot; include the influences of the planets, not as predestining a human career, but influencing a subject&#x27;s essential nature. This astrophysical treatise was not published until it was edited by Sir Henry Savile and printed in London, 1618; its circulation in manuscript was very limited. The implications of the infinite void were revolutionary; to have pursued them would have threatened the singular relationship of man and this natural world to God (Cantor 2001); in it he treated theology mathematically. He wrote also &quot;De Geometria speculativa&quot; (printed at Paris, 1530); &quot;De Arithmetica practica&quot; (printed at Paris, 1502); &quot;De proportionibus velocitatum in motibus (1328)&quot; (printed at Paris, 1495; Venice, 1505); &quot;De Quadratura Circuli&quot; (Paris, 1495); and an &quot;Ars Memorative&quot;, Sloane manuscripts. No. 3974 in the British Museum – earning from the Pope the title of the ‘Profound Doctor’. Another text, &quot;De Continuo&quot; is more tenuously credited to him and thought to be written sometime between 1328 and 1325.

== Theology ==
Bradwardine helped revive Augustinian Theology during his time in the fourteenth century. He wrote extensively on various subjects, including speculative arithmetic, geometry, and the workings of the human mind. As a theologian and scholar of natural philosophy, Bradwardine rejected William of Ockham&#x27;s belief that God could know future events and contingencies in a limited sense, insisting instead that God&#x27;s knowledge is absolute.

Bradwardine was influenced by the Augustinian soteriology, which centered on a divine monergism and implied a double predestination. He accepted the idea of predestination and suggested that all evil acts of Human will were due to God. He argued that providence is inseparable from predestination, and rejected the notion that humans could do good of their own volition. Instead, he claimed they act solely according to God&#x27;s will. Bradwardine would go on to write that free will and predestination through predeterminism are compatible, a theory known as compatibilism.

==Science==

Merton College sheltered a group of dons devoted to natural science, mainly physics, astronomy and mathematics, rivals of the intellectuals at the University of Paris. Bradwardine was one of these Oxford Calculators, studying mechanics with William Heytesbury, Richard Swineshead, and John Dumbleton. The Oxford Calculators distinguished kinematics from dynamics, emphasising kinematics, and investigating instantaneous velocity. They first formulated the mean speed theorem: a body moving with constant velocity travels the same distance as an accelerated body in the same time if its velocity is half the final speed of the accelerated body. They also demonstrated this theorem — the foundation of &quot;The Law of Falling Bodies&quot; — long before Galileo, who is generally credited with it.

The mathematical physicist and historian of science Clifford Truesdell, wrote:

In &quot;Tractatus de proportionibus&quot; (1328), Bradwardine extended the theory of proportions of Eudoxus of Cnidus to anticipate the concept of exponential growth, later developed by the Bernoulli and Euler, with compound interest as a special case. Arguments for the mean speed theorem (above) require the modern mathematical concept of limit, so Bradwardine had to use arguments of his day. Mathematician and mathematical historian Carl Benjamin Boyer writes, &quot;Bradwardine developed the Boethian theory of double or triple or, more generally, what we would call &#x27;n-tuple&#x27; proportion&quot;. Bradwardine attempted to reconcile contradictions in physics, where he largely adopted Aristotle&#x27;s description of the physical universe.

Bradwardine rejected four opinions concerning the link between power, resistance, and speed on the basis that were inconsistent with Aristotle&#x27;s or because they did not align with what could be easily observed regarding motion. He does this by examining the nature of ratios. The first opinion Bradwardine contemplates before rejecting is one he attributes to Avempace that states &quot; that speeds follow the excesses of motive powers over resistances&quot;, following the formula (V ∝ [M−R], where V = speed M = motive power, and R = resistance). he second opinion follows the formula (V ∝ [M−R]/R), which states &quot;that speeds follow the ratio of the excesses of the motive over the resisting powers to the resisting powers&quot;. Bradwardine claims this as the work of Averroes. The third opinion concerns the traditional interpretation of the Aristotelian rules of motion and states &quot;that the speeds follow the inverse of the resistances when the moving powers are the same (V ∝ 1/R when M is constant) and follow the moving powers when the resistances are the same (V ∝ M when R is constant)&quot;. His last rejection was &quot;that speeds do not follow any ratio because motive and resistive powers are quantities of different species and so cannot form ratios with each other&quot;. &quot;Bradwardine&#x27;s own rule is that the ratio of speeds follows the ratios of motive to resistive powers.&quot;

Bradwardine did identify one measurement error in Aristotle&#x27;s law of motion. Bradwardine&#x27;s identification of this error was described by Ernest Moody as a &quot;radical shift from Aristotelian dynamics to modern dynamics, initiated in the early fourteenth century.&quot; Aristotle&#x27;s calculation of average speed was criticized by Bradwardine for not examining &quot;the whole question of how moment-to-moment velocities are related within the whole time of the movement.&quot; Bradwardine also believed Aristotle contradicted himself with his explanation of resistance in motion. Aristotle believed &quot;that a force has to be greater than its resistance in order to move, and the &quot;proportion&quot; (Bradwardine&#x27;s word; we would say ratio) of force to resistance equaling the proportion of distance to time.&quot; Bradwardine did not accept the explanation and instead proposed &quot;that the rate of velocity is the ratio of an exponential increase in force to resistance.&quot; Bradwardine&#x27;s explanation does not align with the modern rules of the rates of motion, yet his goal to reconcile Aristotle&#x27;s claim was accomplished and he was the first person to be credited for using exponential functions in an attempt to explain the laws of motion.

Boyer also writes that &quot;the works of Bradwardine had contained some fundamentals of trigonometry gleaned from Muslim sources&quot;. Yet &quot;Bradwardine and his Oxford colleagues did not quite make the breakthrough to modern science&quot; (Cantor 2001, p. 122).

Al-Kindi in particular seemed to influence Bradwardine, though it is unclear whether this was directly or indirectly. Nonetheless, Bradwardine&#x27;s work bears many similarities to the work of Al-Kindi, &quot;Quia&quot; &quot;primos&quot; (or &quot;De Gradibus&quot;). Gerard of Cremona&#x27;s Latin translation of Quia primos (or De Gradibus) would have been available to Bradwardine, but Roger Bacon seemed to be the only European philosopher to have had a direct connection to the book, but not to the degree of Arnald of Villanova. Nonetheless, Bradwardine&#x27;s work bears many similarities to the work of Al-Kindi.

==Art of memory==
Bradwardine was also a practitioner and exponent of the art of memory, a loosely associated group of mnemonic principles and techniques used to organise memory impressions, improve recall, and assist in the combination and &#x27;invention&#x27; of ideas. His &quot;De Memoria Artificiali&quot; (&quot;c.&quot; 1335) discusses memory training current during his time.

Bradwardine&#x27;s &quot;On Acquiring a Trained Memory&quot;, translated by Mary Carruthers, contains, as Carruthers describes it, was similar to Cicero&#x27;s work on the art of memory. She states, &quot;Bradwardine&#x27;s art is notable for its detailed description of several techniques for fixing and recalling specific material through the use of graphically detailed, brilliantly colored, and vigorously animated mental images, grouped together in a succession of &quot;pictures&quot; or organized scenes, whose internal order recalls not just particular content but the relationship among its parts.&quot; She acknowledges this being similar to active imaging described by Cicero, along with the memory devices for things and words being changed in rhetoric, but are distinct since the imagery Bradwardine uses is decidedly medieval in nature.

==Legacy==
Bradwardine&#x27;s theories on the &quot;insolubilia&quot; including the liar paradox were a great influence on the work of Jean Buridan. Bradwardine&#x27;s work on kinematics was also influential to Buridan. Despite never rejecting the papacy, Thomas Bradwardine is cited as holding Reformation theology before Luther and Calvin.

His &quot;De Causa Dei&quot; influenced the theology of John Wycliffe on grace and predestination.

<text>Calleva Atrebatum (&quot;Calleva of the Atrebates&quot;) was an Iron Age oppidum, the capital of the Atrebates tribe. It then became a walled town in the Roman province of Britannia, at a major crossroads of the roads of southern Britain.

The modern village of Silchester in Hampshire, England, is about a mile (1.6 km) to the west of the site. The village&#x27;s parish church of St Mary the Virgin is just within the ancient walls. Most of the site lies within the modern civil parish of Silchester, although the amphitheatre is in the adjoining civil parish of Mortimer West End. The whole of the site is within the local authority district of Basingstoke and Deane and the county of Hampshire.

==History==

Unusually for an Iron Age tribal town in Britain, its exact site was reused for the Roman town. The Romans changed the layout and defences. 

Calleva Atrebatum (&quot;Calleva of the Atrebates&quot;) was an Iron Age settlement, as capital of the Atrebates tribe. It became a walled town in the Roman province of Britannia. 

===Celtic beginnings===
The Romanised Celtic &quot;Calleva&quot; can be translated to &#x27;woods&#x27; or &#x27;woody place&#x27;. The settlement was surrounded by dense woodlands that were used for fuel and to build structures. Given its access to east, west and northern domestic markets it was a centre of trade within Britain and with civilisations across the Channel and as far away as the Mediterranean.

===Iron Age===
The Late Iron Age settlement at Silchester has been shown by archaeology and coins of the British Q series to link Silchester with the seat of power of the Atrebates. Coins found stamped with &quot;COMMIOS&quot; show that Commius, king of the Atrebates, established his territory and mint here after moving from Gaul. The inner earthwork, constructed AD, enclosed and at a similar time others were built in the surrounds.

Small areas of Late Iron Age occupation were first uncovered on the south side of the inner earthwork and around the south gate. More detailed evidence for this was excavated below the forum/basilica. Several roundhouses, wells and pits were in a northeast–southwest alignment, dated to BC – 15 BC. Occupation of BC to AD 40 or 50 resulted in metalled streets, rubbish pits and palisaded enclosures. Imported Gallo-Belgic fine wares, amphorae and iron and copper-alloy brooches show that the settlement was high status. Distinctive food was identified, including oyster shell, a large briquetage assemblage and sherds from various amphorae for olive oil, fish sauce and wine.

Further such material was uncovered by the Insula &#x27;Town Life&#x27; project, including a great boundary ditch probably made about 40 to 20 BC, a large rectangular hall which could have been built any time between 25 BC to AD 10, and the laying out of lanes and new property divisions from about AD 10 to AD 40 or 50. Archaeobotanical studies have demonstrated the import and consumption of celery, coriander and olives in Insula IX before the Claudian Conquest.

===Roman===
After the Roman conquest of Britain in 43 AD the settlement developed into the Roman town of Calleva Atrebatum. 

It was slightly larger, covering about , and was laid out to a clear, new street grid. The town had several public buildings and flourished until the early Anglo-Saxon period.

A large mansio was in Insula VIII, near the South Gate, consisting of three wings arranged around a courtyard. A possible nymphaeum was near to the amphitheatre to the north of the walled city.

Calleva was a major crossroads. The Devil&#x27;s Highway connected it with the provincial capital Londinium (London). From Calleva, this road divided into routes to various other points west, including the road to Aquae Sulis (Bath); Ermin Way to Glevum (Gloucester); and the Port Way to Sorviodunum (Old Sarum near modern Salisbury).

The earthworks and, for much of the circumference, the ruined walls are still visible. The remains of the amphitheatre, added about AD 70–80 and outside the city walls, can also be clearly seen. The area inside the walls is now largely farmland with no visible distinguishing features other than the enclosing earthworks and walls, with a tiny mediaeval church in one corner. At its peak, the Roman amphitheatre would have housed around seven thousand spectators. Within, bear fighting, gladiator fighting, and other forms of entertainment were put on. Around the third century, renovations were made to the stadium including two new stadium entrances were added and the shape was turned into a more elliptical layout. After the Romans retreated, the British and the Anglo-Saxons continued to use the amphitheatre.

In the southeast of the city were the thermal baths. They belong to the earliest stone buildings of the city, which were perhaps built around 50 AD. The baths are not aligned with the later city grid, and the entrance area was rebuilt to fit into the new road network. Several construction phases can be distinguished. At first they consisted of a portico, a palaestra and the bath rooms behind. The portico was later removed and the bathrooms divided in half, presumably so that men and women could bathe separately.

There is a spring that emanates from inside the walls, near the original baths, and flows south-eastwards where it joins Silchester Brook. The Roman Calleva flourished (to nearly 10,000 inhabitants in the third/fourth century) around these springs that served the Roman baths excavated in summer 2019.

===Sub-Roman and medieval===

After the Roman withdrawal from Britain, Calleva Atrebatum remained inhabited, but its fortunes began to falter. Major buildings at the site were used 400–430, but evidence of occupation begins to decline sharply after AD 450. According to Daniel G. Russo the hypothesis that the city remained in use during the sixth century, thanks to its sturdy walls, is &quot;attractive,&quot; but based largely on guesswork, as &quot;there is no firm written or archaeological evidence that organised Romano-British urban life existed at Calleva beyond 450 at the latest.&quot; This is in contrast to most other Roman towns in Britain, which continued to exist after the end of the Roman era; Calleva is one of the six that did not survive the sub-Roman era, and disappeared in the Middle Ages. (That said, the historian David Nash Ford identifies the site with the Cair Celemion of Nennius&#x27;s list of the 28 cities of Sub-Roman Britain, which, if true, would mean that the site was at least partially extant during the Early Middle Ages.)

A hypothesis has emerged that the Saxons deliberately avoided Calleva after it was abandoned, preferring to maintain their existing centres at Winchester and Dorchester. There was a gap of perhaps a century before the twin Saxon towns of Basing and Reading were founded on rivers either side of Calleva. As a consequence, Calleva has been subject to relatively benign neglect for most of the last two millennia.

== Culture ==
=== Agriculture ===
The study of waterlogged macrofossils through a series of wells throughout the abandoned civilisation resulted in key evidence of animal stabling, hay meadows management, and the use of heath resources (such as heathers, gorse, and heathland grasses). The most abundant crops that were found in the area are &quot;Capsella bursa pastoris&quot;, &quot;Chenopodium album&quot;, &quot;Polygonum aviculare&quot;, &quot;Stellaria media&quot; and &quot;Urtica urens&quot;, &quot;Fallopia convolvulus&quot; and &quot;Sisymbrium&quot;. The use of new oil crops and grassland management is evident that the agricultural upheaval changes were related to those that provide food to livestock rather than providing food to the population of the civilisation. The development of the land represents a major change in the social organisation and settlement form. This is evident in the ample earthwork or large artificial banks of soil. Between the Hampshire chalk downs and alluvium-rich flood plains of the Thames valley, the civilisation is on a gravel terrace of the River Kennet, a major tributary of the Thames. This has left beneath its thin much later organic topsoil, feet of tertiary clay and sand. If ploughed the result is a &quot;well-drained brown-earth soil&quot; which, unirrigated, and without high fertilisation, yields low cereal returns. It is traditionally often cleared as pasture, orchards or kept as bramble-rich woodland for hogs and game. Palaeoenvironmental studies of the Early Iron Age at this site expose largely cleared land. Development of the heath from this time is evidenced by pollen analysis.

=== Diet ===
The study of plant remains from the across the city and especially Insula IX have shown that spelt, wheat and barley were the most common cereals consumed. A wide range of fruits (apple, fig, grape), flavourings (celery, coriander, dill), and pulses (celtic bean, pea) were consumed. Many houses had their own rotary querns for grinding flour. Cattle, sheep/goat and pig were the major sources of meat.

=== Religion ===
There is a range of evidence for religious practices in the town. A possible church was to the south-east of the Forum in Insula IV. The apse-ended basilica building has a layout comparable to early churches in the western Roman empire, but the date is likely to be pre-Constantinian. A Romano-Celtic temple was in Insula XXXV, where an inscription shows a dedication by the guild of &quot;peregrini&quot;. Three Romano-Celtic temples were in Insula XXX, just inside the east gate. These temples were constructed in the mid first century AD and went out of use after c. AD 200. A limestone head of Serapis was discovered in 1899 at Silchester Common.

=== Death and burial ===
Late Iron Age cremation burials have been excavated at Latchmere Green and Windabout Copse. The Roman cemeteries are thought to have been to the north and west of the Outer Earthwork, and have not been investigated. A tombstone recovered in 1577 reads &quot;To the memory of Flavia Victorina Titus Tammonius, Her husband set this up&quot;.
=== Defence ===
Built in two phases, the defence system of Calleva Atrebatum is evident in the remains of the North Gate. Construction of the wall surrounding the area first began around 200 AD. Parts of this rampart still remain in stone and tile remnants. In 270 AD, the defences were strengthened with an even larger stone wall. Defences were most probably strengthened due to the increasing number of Saxon raids in the area. The defence systems worked to protect from local uprisings, pillaging, and invaders from abroad. They also allowed for traffic to be monitored both in and out of the city.

== Economy ==

=== Craft production ===
Various craft activities have been evidenced through excavations in Insula IX, including bone- and antler- working, the working of copper-alloys, and leather-working. Imported whetstones were recycled into whetstones.

=== Building material ===
Production taking place in the area around Silchester includes a complex of tile kilns at Little London, including two tiles stamped with the title of the Emperor Nero. Because of the abundance of woods in the area, most of the structures were built out of timber.

=== Trade ===
A wide range of objects were imported to Silchester from the Roman Empire, including an ivory razor handle, a handle from a &quot;Fusshenkelkruge&quot; and a Harpocrates figure from a Campanian brazier. Imported ceramics include Central Gaulish samian produced in Lezoux, Dressel 2-4 and 14 amphora, Rhineland white ware mortaria, Moselkeramik black slipped ware and Cologne colour coated ware.

==Archaeology==

Calleva Atrebatum was first excavated by the Reverend James Joyce who, in 1866, discovered the bronze eagle known as &#x27;The Silchester eagle&#x27; now in the Museum of Reading. It may originally have formed part of a Jupiter statue in the forum.

Although it had long been known that there was an abandoned Roman civilisation, excavations ordered by the landowner, the Duke of Wellington, only began in the late nineteenth century. Joyce was the designated observer and recorder of all archaeological records. His overall goal was to reveal the complete plan of the Roman town. Little further investigation occurred until the 1961 re-excavation of the early Christian Church where the researchers found that eighty to ninety percent of the excavation had been completed. Within those limited excavations, the foundation and the plans of the masonry buildings were exposed. They were discovered by digging trenches through the area. The architecture and archaeology of the timber buildings of the ancient Roman town were misunderstood at the time of the excavation, timber was the most notable material.

Molly Cotton carried out excavations on the defences in 1938–39. Since the 1970s Michael Fulford and the University of Reading have undertaken several excavations on the town walls (1974–80), amphitheatre (1979–85) and the forum basilica (1977, 1980–86), which have revealed remarkably good preservation of items from both the Iron Age and early Roman occupations.

From 1997 to 2014 Reading University carried out sustained and concentrated excavations in Insula IX. Results of the Late Roman, Mid Roman and Late Iron Age phases have been published. In 2013, excavations began in Insula III, investigating a structure identified by the Victorian excavations as a bathhouse. From 2018, the University of Reading has re-explored the previously excavated ruins of the public bathhouse looking at what earlier excavators may have missed.

==Access==
Now primarily owned by Hampshire County Council and managed by English Heritage, the site of Calleva is open to the public during daylight hours, seven days a week and without charge. The full circumference of the walls is accessible, as is the amphitheatre. The interior is farmed and, with the exception of the church and a single track that bisects the interior, inaccessible.

The Museum of Reading in Reading Town Hall has a gallery devoted to Calleva, displaying many archaeological finds from the excavations.

<doc id="153679" wikidata="Q2622871" url="?curid=153679" title="Harriseahead">
<text>Harriseahead is a village in the county of Staffordshire, England, just north of the Potteries (Stoke on Trent) and about south-west of Biddulph and close to the border with Cheshire. Population details from the 2011 census can be found under Kidsgrove.

==History==
The etymology is unknown; although the &quot;-head&quot; ending of the name, from Old English &quot;heafod&quot; indicates the town&#x27;s high situation in the Staffordshire Moorlands.

Mow Cop Castle is on top of a hill just under a mile north of the village. It has been in the care of the National Trust since 1937, but has a history linking it with Methodism.

The County of Staffordshire is about as far inland as any county of the United Kingdom, and covers a distance of 55 miles from North to South and 36 miles from East to West. It has been hailed as the land of Crocks and Locks due to its links with canals and the pottery industry. There are few navigable rivers, and this lack of natural waterways initially put Staffordshire at a disadvantage when compared to other English counties. The coming of the canals was really to spur on industry and by the end of the 18th century Staffordshire sat at the economic and transport heart of the country.

The county was endowed with an abundance of minerals including copper, lead, limestone and, most importantly, coal. As the majority of minerals required firing, charcoal was initially used. As supplies became depleted, more and more coal had to be used. This had considerable effects on the developments of urban villages such as Harriseahead.

The tectonic structure within the coalfield is made up of a series of North / South folds which gave rise to many outcrops and footrail mines such as those found in Harriseahead. The coalfield is exceptionally rich in coal seams. It has been suggested that there may be up to 30 different seams with of aggregate depth of some 140 feet. The most productive seams are to be found within the Middle Coal Measures, varieties including coking coals which formed the backbone of the local iron smelting industry.

===Harriseahead in 1841===
The census of 1841 showed that the village of Harriseahead had a population of some 578 persons, 303 of which were male and 275 of which were females. There were 111 separate dwellings, with an average occupancy rate of 5.28 persons per dwelling. Of the population only 35.8% were in work.

Harriseahead was heavily involved with the coal mining industry for many years and now is a commuter village serving the urban conurbations of Stoke on Trent and as far away as Manchester and Birmingham. Along with other urban villages on the North Staffordshire Coalfield, the reliance on mining has been replaced, as the industry as a whole has declined both locally and nationally. The landscape still exhibits features of its former industrial heritage, including disused fustian mills the rebuilt winding house on Biddulph Road, the derelict buildings of Red Lion Pit, and the disused tramway which can be seen in the local fields.

===Links with Methodism===

The link with Methodism came when Hugh Bourne moved to Harriseahead in 1800, having bought an oak woodland there to supply pit props in Stonetrough Colliery and other local mines. In 1801 to 1802 he built a Methodist Chapel which became the centre of Methodist activity in that area and beyond. The Primitive Methodist movement grew out of this.

The village used to have both a Primitive and Wesleyan Methodist Chapel, however a single functioning chapel remains in the form of the Methodist Memorial Chapel found on the corner of High Street and Chapel Lane. The Chapel continues to have its annual Anniversary Sermons and Flower Festival which are well received locally.

The chapel closed in October 2018, holding a final service which was very well attended.

<text>Roger Walden (died 1406) was an English treasurer and Bishop of London.

==Life==

Little is now known of Walden&#x27;s birth nor of his early years. He had some connection with the Channel Islands, and resided for some time in Jersey where he was rector of the Parish Church of St Helier from 1371 to 1378. He then held livings in Yorkshire and in Leicestershire before he became Archdeacon of Winchester in 1387. His days, however, were by no means fully occupied with his ecclesiastical duties, and in 1387 also he was appointed Treasurer of Calais, holding about the same time other positions in this neighbourhood.

In 1395, after having served Richard II as secretary, Walden became treasurer of England, adding the deanery of York to his numerous other benefices. On 8 November 1397 he was chosen Archbishop of Canterbury in succession to Thomas Arundel, who had just been banished from the realm, but he lost this position when the new king Henry IV restored Arundel in 1399, and after a short imprisonment he passed into retirement, being, as he himself says, &quot;in the dust and under feet of men.&quot;

On 10 December 1405, through Arundel&#x27;s influence, Walden was elected Bishop of London, and he died at Much Hadham in Hertfordshire on 6 January 1406. He was buried in St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. An &quot;Historia Mundi&quot;, the manuscript of which is in the British Museum, is sometimes regarded as the work of Walden; but this was doubtless written by an earlier writer.

<doc id="153681" wikidata="Q187646" url="?curid=153681" title="Celestial equator">
<text>The celestial equator is the great circle of the imaginary celestial sphere on the same plane as the equator of Earth. By extension, it is also a plane of reference in the equatorial coordinate system. In other words, the celestial equator is an abstract projection of the terrestrial equator into outer space. Due to Earth&#x27;s axial tilt, the celestial equator is currently inclined by about 23.44° with respect to the ecliptic (the plane of Earth&#x27;s orbit), but has varied from about 22.0° to 24.5° over the past 5 million years due to perturbation from other planets.

An observer standing on Earth&#x27;s equator visualizes the celestial equator as a semicircle passing through the zenith, the point directly overhead. As the observer moves north (or south), the celestial equator tilts towards the opposite horizon. The celestial equator is defined to be infinitely distant (since it is on the celestial sphere); thus, the ends of the semicircle always intersect the horizon due east and due west, regardless of the observer&#x27;s position on Earth. At the poles, the celestial equator coincides with the astronomical horizon. At all latitudes, the celestial equator is a uniform arc or circle because the observer is only finitely far from the plane of the celestial equator, but infinitely far from the celestial equator itself.

Astronomical objects near the celestial equator appear above the horizon from most places on earth, but they culminate (reach the meridian) highest near the equator. The celestial equator currently passes through these constellations:

These are the most globally visible constellations.

Over thousands of years, the orientation of Earth&#x27;s equator and thus the constellations the celestial equator passes through will change due to axial precession.

Celestial bodies other than Earth also have similarly defined celestial equators.

<doc id="153682" wikidata="Q1190494" url="?curid=153682" title="Galindian language">
<text>The term Galindian is sometimes ascribed to two separate Baltic languages, both of which were peripheral dialects:
* a West Baltic language referred to as West Galindian; 
* a Baltic language previously spoken in Mozhaysk region (present day Russia), referred to as East Galindian or Golyad

==Name==
There are three proposed etymologies for the denomination &quot;Galindian&quot;:
* Proto-Baltic meaning &#x27;outsider&#x27; ( &#x27;wall; border&#x27;). This is supported by the etymology of the common Old Russian term for the Galindians &gt; &gt; Baltic );
* It is derived from the root found in Baltic hydronyms; and
* The name means &#x27;the powerful ones&#x27; ( &#x27;power, strength&#x27;) and also Celtic languages ( &#x27;strength&#x27;, &#x27;power&#x27;, &quot;Galli&quot;, &quot;Gallia&quot;).

==Proposed relation==
Based on the common name used for the two peoples by ancient authors, some scientists propose a common origin of the two peoples and languages. In order to prove this hypothesis, they investigate common features between Old Prussian/West Galindian and East Galindian.

== West Galindian==

West Galindian is the poorly attested extinct Baltic language of the Galindians previously spoken in what is today northeastern Poland and thought to have been a dialect of Old Prussian, or a Western Baltic language similar to Old Prussian. There are no extant writings in Galindian.

<text>John Potter (c. 167410 October 1747) was Archbishop of Canterbury (1737–1747).

==Life==
He was the son of a linen draper at Wakefield, Yorkshire. At the age of fourteen he entered University College, Oxford, and in 1693 he published notes on Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;De audiendis poetis&quot; and Basil&#x27;s &quot;Oratio ad juvenes&quot;. In 1694 he was elected fellow of Lincoln College, Oxford and in 1697 his edition of &quot;Lycophron&quot; appeared. It was followed by his &quot;Archaeologia graeca&quot; (2 vols. 8vo, 1697–1698), the popularity of which endured till the advent of Dr William Smith&#x27;s dictionaries. A reprint of his &quot;Lycophron&quot; in 1702 was dedicated to Graevius, and the &quot;Antiquities&quot; was afterwards published in Latin in the &quot;Thesaurus of Gronovius&quot;.

Besides holding several livings he became, in 1704, chaplain to Archbishop Tenison, and shortly afterwards was made Chaplain-in-Ordinary to Queen Anne. From 1708 he was Regius Professor of Divinity and canon of Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford. He married Elizabeth Venner in St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in 1709. She being a granddaughter of Thomas Venner, a Fifth Monarchy man hanged as a traitor. In 1715 he became Bishop of Oxford. In the same year appeared his edition of Clement of Alexandria. In 1707 he published a &quot;Discourse on Church Government,&quot; and he took a prominent part in the controversy with Benjamin Hoadly, Bishop of Bangor. Even though Potter was a notable Whig, he was a High Churchman and had opposed Hoadly. Bishop Potter also ordained John Wesley a deacon in the Church of England in September 1725, and ordained him a priest in 1728.

In January 1737 Potter was unexpectedly appointed to succeed William Wake in the see of Canterbury. While in that seat, he continued to represent a High Church position, but he was also ineffective at restoring the Convocation. Alexander Pope attacked him in the 1743 version of his &quot;The Dunciad&quot; (book II, 323).

Potter died on 10 October 1747. His &quot;Theological Works&quot;, consisting of sermons, charges, divinity lectures and the &quot;Discourse on Church Government&quot;, were published in three volumes.

He was buried in Croydon Minster in Surrey.

<text>Mow Cop Castle is a folly at Mow Cop in the civil parish of Odd Rode, Cheshire, England. It is designated as a Grade II listed building on the National Heritage List for England. The ridge, upon which the castle sits, forms the boundary between the counties of Cheshire and Staffordshire, the dioceses of Chester and Lichfield and the ecclesiastical provinces of Canterbury and York.

==History==
Traces of a prehistoric camp have been found here. In 1754, Randle Wilbraham of nearby Rode Hall built an elaborate summerhouse looking like a medieval fortress and round tower.

The area around the castle was nationally famous for the quarrying of high-quality millstones (&#x27;querns&#x27;) for use in water mills. Excavations at Mow Cop have found querns dating back to the Iron Age.

The Castle was given to the National Trust in 1937. That same year over ten thousand Methodists met on the hill to commemorate the first Primitive Methodist camp which met there in 1807.

At the turn of the millennium, on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1999, Mow Cop was a location for one of the hundreds of flaming beacons across the UK that were lit to welcome the new century.

Though visitors were originally allowed inside the tower of the folly, access is now prevented by a locked metal gate, which still allows views inside the folly. 

Mow Cop and its folly are central images in Alan Garner&#x27;s novel &quot;Red Shift&quot;.

<doc id="153687" wikidata="Q1340755" url="?curid=153687" title="Endon">
<text>Endon is a village within the Staffordshire Moorlands district of Staffordshire, England. It is southwest of Leek and north-northeast of Stoke-on-Trent. Endon was formerly a township in civil parish of Leek.

Together with neighbouring Stanley, Endon forms the civil parish of Endon and Stanley.

The local education consists of three schools; St. Luke&#x27;s Church of England Primary School, Endon Hall Primary School and Endon High School.

==Local features==
The Caldon Canal, a branch of the Trent &amp; Mersey Canal, passes around Endon.

The Ashes, a 17th-century house, lies to the north of the village.

==Railway==
The Endon railway station was opened by the North Staffordshire Railway on 1 November 1867 and operated for almost 100 years, closing in 1963 . There are ambitious plans in hand to develop passenger facilities at Endon, bringing the village station back to life after decades of disuse. The project to reconnect Endon is a joint partnership between Moorland &amp; City Railways and Churnet Valley Railway. Volunteers working on behalf of Churnet Valley Railway, will carry out repairs on the four-mile stretch of track, supported by contractors .

Reaching Endon will be a major milestone for the expansion project, and will mean that passenger trains will reconnect the outskirts of the Potteries with the Churnet Valley and Leek area for the first time since the cut backs of the Beeching Axe. It is also intended to make it possible to travel directly from Endon to Alton towers on this passenger train. Later, the intention is to reconnect Endon to Stoke-on-Trent. Large amounts of funding are required to meet this aim .

==Well dressing==

The village is unusual in the respect that it is one of only a few outside Derbyshire which practises the ancient custom of Well dressing . A weekend fair accompanies the dressing of the well at which a local girl is crowned as the Well Dressing Queen. The fair also includes a contest called &quot;Tossing the Sheaf&quot; where local men compete to see who can toss a bale of straw the highest over a raised bar. The fair is known for bringing the entire village together, which is a rare occasion for most modern villages .

==Literary and musical associations==
T. E. Hulme (1883–1917), an English critic and poet, was born at Gratton Hall. Through his writings on art, literature and politics, he had a notable influence upon modernism .

The opening line of the iconic 1976 Sutherland Brothers and Quiver hit &quot;Arms of Mary&quot;: &quot;the lights shine down the valley&quot;, was written by Iain Sutherland who was looking from a Stockton Brook farm house down over Endon.

<doc id="153688" wikidata="Q7981120" url="?curid=153688" title="Well dressing">
<text>Well dressing, also known as well flowering, is a tradition practised in some parts of rural England in which wells, springs and other water sources are decorated with designs created from flower petals. The custom is most closely associated with the Peak District of Derbyshire and Staffordshire. James Murray Mackinlay, writing in 1893, noted that the tradition was not observed in Scotland; W. S. Cordner, in 1946, similarly noted its absence in Ireland. Both Scotland and Ireland do have a long history of the veneration of wells, however, dating from at least the 6th century.

The custom of well dressing in its present form probably began in the late 18th century, and evolved from &quot;the more widespread, but less picturesque&quot; decoration of wells with ribbons and simple floral garlands.

==History==
The location identified most closely with well dressing is Tissington, Derbyshire, though the origins of the tradition are obscure. It has been speculated that it began as a pagan custom of offering thanks to gods for a reliable water supply; other suggested explanations include villagers celebrating the purity of their water supply after surviving the Black Death in 1348, or alternatively celebrating their water&#x27;s constancy during a prolonged drought in 1615. The practice of well dressing using clay boards at Tissington is not recorded before 1818, however, and the earliest record for the wells being adorned by simple garlands occurs in 1758.
Well dressing was celebrated in at least 12 villages in Derbyshire by the late 19th century, and was introduced in Buxton in 1840, &quot;to commemorate the beneficence of the Duke of Devonshire who, at his own expense, made arrangements for supplying the Upper Town, which had been much inconvenienced by the distance to St Anne&#x27;s well on the Wye, with a fountain of excellent water within easy reach of all&quot;. Similarly, well dressing was revived at this time in Youlgreave, to celebrate the supplying of water to the village &quot;from a hill at some distance, by means of pipes laid under the stream of an intervening valley.&quot;. With the arrival of piped water the tradition was adapted to include public taps, although the resulting creations were still described as well dressings.

The custom waxed and waned over the years, but has seen revivals in Derbyshire, Staffordshire, South Yorkshire, Cheshire, Shropshire, Worcestershire and Kent.

==Process==
Wooden frames are constructed and covered with clay, mixed with water and salt. A design is sketched on paper, often of a religious theme, and this is traced onto the clay. The picture is then filled in with natural materials, predominantly flower petals and mosses, but also beans, seeds and small cones. Each group uses its own technique, with some areas mandating that only natural materials be used while others feel free to use modern materials to simplify production. Wirksworth and Barlow are two of the very few dressings where the strict use of only natural materials is still observed.

==In literature==

John Brunner&#x27;s story &quot;In the Season of the Dressing of the Wells&quot; describes the revival of the custom in an English village of the West Country after World War I, and its connection to the Goddess.
Jon McGregor&#x27;s novel &quot;Reservoir 13&quot; is set in a village where well dressing is an annual event.

<text>Family Feud is an American television game show created by Mark Goodson. Two families compete on each episode to name the most popular answers to survey questions in order to win cash and prizes.

The show has had three separate runs, the first of which started in 1976. Its original run from 1976 to 1985 aired on ABC and in syndication, with Richard Dawson as host. In 1987, the series was revived as a pilot and later in 1988 aired on CBS and in syndication with Ray Combs hosting until 1994, with Dawson returning until the latter version ended in 1995. In 1999, the series was revived through its first-run syndication with four different hosts: Louie Anderson (1999–2002), Richard Karn (2002–2006), John O&#x27;Hurley (2006–2010), and Steve Harvey (2010–present). The show has had four announcers: Gene Wood (1976–1995), Burton Richardson (1999–2010), Joey Fatone (2010–2015), and Rubin Ervin (2015–present).

Within a year of its debut, the original version became the number one game show in daytime television; however, as viewing habits changed, the ratings declined. Harvey becoming host in 2010 increased Nielsen ratings significantly and eventually placed the program among the top three most-popular syndicated television shows in the United States. Harvey has also surpassed every previous host in tenure.

The program has produced multiple regional adaptations in over 50 international markets outside the United States. Reruns of episodes hosted by Steve Harvey air on Game Show Network, as well as in syndication while reruns of earlier versions air on BUZZR and Pluto TV. Aside from television shows, there have been also many home editions produced in board game, interactive film, and video game formats.

== Gameplay ==
The game features two competing families, each represented by five members (reduced to four contestants for the 1994–95 season), who compete to determine the answers to survey questions. The original version of the show began with the families being introduced, seated opposite each other as if posing for family portraits, after which the host interviewed them.

While there is no minimum age to participate in &quot;Family Feud&quot;, as long as at least one member of the family is 18 years of age or older, producers recommend that contestants are 15 years of age or older due to the nature of some questions. Each round begins with a &quot;face-off&quot; question that serves as a toss-up between two opposing contestants. The host asks a survey question that was previously posed to a group of 100 people, such as &quot;Name something you expect to see on the streets at Christmastime.&quot; A certain number of answers are concealed on the board, ranked by popularity of the survey&#x27;s responses.

The first contestant to buzz in gives an answer; if it is the most popular, their family immediately wins the face-off. Otherwise, the opponent is offered a chance to answer, and the face-off is won by whichever family&#x27;s member has offered a higher-valued answer (or, if both answers have the same point value, whoever rang in sooner). If neither contestant&#x27;s answer is on the board, the other eight contestants have a chance to respond, one at a time from alternating sides, until an answer is revealed. The family that wins the face-off may choose to play the question or pass control to their opponents (except on the 1988–95 versions, when the family who won the face-off automatically gained control of the question).

The family with control of the question then tries to win the round by guessing all of the remaining concealed answers, with each member giving one answer in sequence. Giving an answer not on the board or failing to respond within three seconds earns the family a strike. After three strikes are earned, the opposing family is given one chance to &quot;steal&quot; the points for the round by guessing any of the remaining answers. Otherwise, the points are automatically awarded to the family that originally had control. From 1992 to 2003, the value of the &quot;stealing&quot; answer was credited to the &quot;stealing&quot; family. If the opponents are given the opportunity to &quot;steal&quot; the points, then only their team&#x27;s captain is required to answer the question. For most of the series, this is done after the family confers with each other; the only exception was from 1988 to 1994 where Ray Combs polled each family member for an answer with the team captain having the option to either select one of the family&#x27;s answers or give a different answer. At the end of the round, any remaining concealed answers on the board that were not guessed are then revealed.

Answers are worth one point for every person in the 100-member survey who gave them. The winning family in each round scores the total points for all revealed answers to that question, including those given during the face-off but excluding the one used to steal. The number of answers on the board decreases from round to round, and as the game progresses, certain rounds are played for double or triple point value.

For most of the show&#x27;s existence, the first team to reach or surpass a certain point total won the game. The most common goal has been 300 points but there have been exceptions. When the original series first premiered, the goal was 200 points and for its final year, it was increased to 400 points. From the debut of the original series until 1992, families were awarded $1 per point scored.

From 1999 to 2003, the family with the highest point total after four rounds of play won the game regardless of their score. The first three rounds were played as normal rounds. In the fourth round, the point values were tripled, but the families were only allowed one strike if they had control. In the rare instance that the family in control was trailing and could not accumulate enough points to potentially overtake the leaders before striking out, the game ended without the other family attempting to steal.

On the first two series a match continued until a family reached the goal. The current series reinstated the 300 point goal in 2003 but kept the four round format. If neither family has reached 300 points after four rounds, one more triple value question is played as a sudden death face-off. Only the top answer is displayed on the board, and the first contestant to buzz in with it wins the points and the game for their team.

In the original periodic primetime specials, three games were played, with the first two ending when a team reaches 200 points. For the third game, only one question round was played with the winning two celebrity teams from the previous rounds playing.

=== Fast Money ===
At the end of the main game, the winning family selects two members to play the show&#x27;s bonus round, known as Fast Money. One contestant is onstage with the host, while the other is sequestered backstage with headphones so as not to hear or see the first portion of the round. The first contestant is asked five rapid-fire survey questions and has a set time limit in which to answer them (originally 15 seconds, extended to 20 in 1994). The contestant may pass on a question and return to it if time remains.

After the first contestant has finished answering or run out of time, they are awarded a point for each person in the survey who gave the same response. Once these points are tallied, the board is cleared except for the total score, and the second contestant is then brought out to answer the same five questions. The same rules are followed, but the time limit is extended by five seconds (originally 20, then extended to 25); in addition, if the second contestant duplicates an answer given by the first, the host prompts the contestant for an alternate answer. If the two contestants manage to reach a combined total of 200 points or more, the family wins a cash prize; otherwise, the family is awarded $5 for each point.

The cash prize for winning Fast Money has varied. During the ABC and CBS incarnations of the show, the top prize was $5,000. In the original periodic primetime specials, each game was followed by a Fast Money round. The first two were each worth $5,000, and the final one was worth $10,000. The prize money was increased to $10,000 on the syndicated version until September 2001.

In September 2001, the prize money was doubled to $20,000 at the request of then-host Louie Anderson. This initially lasted until September 2009, when the Bullseye round returned at the start of the show, meaning the total for Fast Money was an adjustable amount between $15,000 and $30,000 depending on how much each family won during Bullseye. In July 2010, however, Bullseye was removed and the prize money reverted to $20,000, which has remained ever since.

=== Returning champions ===
When &quot;Family Feud&quot; premiered on ABC, network rules dictated how much a family could win. Once any family reached $25,000, they were retired as champions. The accompanying syndicated series that premiered in 1977 featured two new families each episode because of a then common television syndication practice known as &quot;bicycling&quot; (wherein individual stations sent an episode of a series they had already aired to another station, reducing the number of tapes a syndicator had to send out but also ensuring that stations did not air the same episode of a show the same day, nor were they assured of airing in a proper sequence).

The CBS daytime and syndicated versions which began airing in 1988 also featured returning champions, who could appear for a maximum of five days. For a brief period in the 1994–95 season which aired in syndication, there were no returning champions. For these episodes, two new families competed in this first half of each episode. The second half featured former champion families who appeared on &quot;Family Feud&quot; between 1976 and 1985, with the winner of the first half of the show playing one of these families in the second half. When the champion rule was reinstated, the winner of the first half faced the champion family in the second. Occasionally two families from the 1976-1985 version would play the first half and celebrities would play for charity in the second half.

In some cases from 1992 to 1995, the returning champions continued until they were defeated. From 1999 to 2002, two new families appeared on each episode. In 2002, returning champions again appeared with the same five-day limit. In 2009, a new car was announced for a family who wins five games in a row. This was first changed to a $30,000 cash bonus in May 2024, and then changed again in September 2024 to a vacation and a $10,000 cash bonus.

=== Bullseye/Bankroll game ===
In June 1992, the CBS daytime edition of &quot;Feud&quot; expanded from 30 to 60 minutes and became known as the &quot;Family Feud Challenge.&quot; As part of the change, a new round was added at the start of each game called &quot;Bullseye&quot;. This round determined the potential Fast Money stake for each team. Each team was given a starting value for their bank and attempted to come up with the top answer to a survey question to add to it. The Bullseye round was added to the syndicated edition in September 1992, which remained 30 minutes and was retitled as the &quot;New Family Feud.&quot;

The first two members of each family appeared at the face-off podium and were asked a question to which only the number-one answer was available. Giving the top answer added the value for that question to the family&#x27;s bank. The process then repeated with the four remaining members from each family. On the first half of the daytime version, families were staked with $2,500. The first question was worth $500, with each succeeding question worth $500 more than the previous, with the final question worth $2,500. This allowed for a potential maximum bank of $10,000. For the second half of the daytime version, and also on the syndicated version, all values were doubled, making the maximum potential bank $20,000. The team that eventually won the game played for their bank in Fast Money.

In 1994, with Richard Dawson returning as host, the round&#x27;s name was changed to the &quot;Bankroll&quot; round. Although the goal remained of giving only the number-one answer, the format was modified to three questions from five, with only one member of each family participating for all three questions. The initial stake for each family remained the same ($2,500 in the first half of the hour and $5,000 in the second). However, the value for each question was $500, $1,500 and $2,500 in the first half, with values doubling for the second half. This meant a potential maximum bank of $7,000 in the first half and $14,000 in the second.

The Bullseye round returned for the 2009–2010 season and was played similarly to the format used from 1992 to 1994 on the syndicated version. Five questions were asked, worth from $1,000 to $5,000. However, each family was given a $15,000 starting stake, which meant a potential maximum of a $30,000 bank.

When Harvey took over as host, the Bullseye round was removed and the Fast Money jackpot reverted back to $20,000.

=== Celebrity Family Feud ===
The first edition of &quot;Celebrity Family Feud&quot; by NBC began in 2008 as part of a block of summer reality series it branded as &quot;All-American Summer&quot;. The NBC edition was hosted by Al Roker, with Burton Richardson as announcer. This version only lasted for one season and was canceled in March 2009. This is the first and (to date) only version of &quot;Family Feud&quot; to air exclusively on NBC. In 2015, the show was revived by ABC with Steve Harvey, host of the syndicated version of &quot;Family Feud&quot;, selected as host, and Burton Richardson returning as announcer. This would mark the first time any version of &quot;Family Feud&quot; has aired exclusively on ABC since the initial Dawson version was canceled in 1985. Harvey has hosted &quot;Celebrity Family Feud&quot; since 2015, while Richardson announced for &quot;Celebrity Family Feud&quot; from 2015 until 2023. Rubin Ervin replaced Richardson as announcer in July 2024.

As of 2024, eleven seasons of &quot;Celebrity Family Feud&quot; have aired (1 on NBC, 10 on ABC).

== Hosts and announcers ==

When &quot;Family Feud&quot; was conceived in 1976, Richard Dawson (then a regular panelist on the Goodson–Todman game show &quot;Match Game&quot;) had a standing agreement with Mark Goodson that when the next Goodson–Todman game show was in the planning stages, Dawson would be given an audition to host it. Dawson had read in trade publications that a pilot for a new show named &quot;Family Feud&quot; was in the works, and it was originally to be hosted by &quot;Star Trek&quot; actor William Shatner (although since they were involved in the run-throughs, Geoff Edwards and Jack Narz, the latter of whom reputedly was Goodson&#x27;s initial choice to host, were under consideration). Incensed, Dawson sent his agent to Goodson to threaten to present an un-funny, silent, and bland persona on future &quot;Match Game&quot; episodes if he was not given an audition for &quot;Feud&quot;.

Dawson was then selected as host of the original ABC and first syndicated versions of &quot;Family Feud&quot;. As writer David Marc put it, Dawson&#x27;s on-air personality &quot;fell somewhere between the brainless sincerity of Wink Martindale and the raunchy cynicism of Chuck Barris&quot;. Writers Tim Brooks, Jon Ellowitz, and Earle F. Marsh attributed &quot;Family Feud&quot;″s popularity to Dawson&#x27;s &quot;glib familiarity&quot; (he had previously played Newkirk on &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot;) and &quot;ready wit&quot; (from his tenure as a panelist on &quot;Match Game&quot;). The show&#x27;s original announcer was Gene Wood, with Johnny Gilbert and Rod Roddy serving as occasional substitutes.

In 1988, comedian Ray Combs took over Dawson&#x27;s role as host on CBS and in syndication with Wood returning as announcer and Roddy and Art James serving in that role when Wood was not available. Combs hosted the program until the daytime version&#x27;s cancellation in 1993 and the syndicated version until the end of the 1993–94 season. Dawson returned to the show at the request of Mark Goodson Productions for the 1994–95 season.

When &quot;Family Feud&quot; returned to syndication in 1999, it was initially hosted by comedian Louie Anderson, with Burton Richardson as the new announcer. In 2002, Richard Karn was selected to take over for Anderson, until he was replaced by John O&#x27;Hurley in 2006. In 2010, both O&#x27;Hurley and Richardson departed from the show. O&#x27;Hurley later stated that he left because he was resistant toward the show&#x27;s decision to emphasize ribald humor and wanted to keep the show family-friendly. Steve Harvey was later named the new host and began hosting on July 10, 2010. Harvey has been hosting the show ever since. Announcements were made using a pre-recorded track of Joey Fatone&#x27;s voice, which was used on the show until the end of the 2014–2015 season. Rubin Ervin, who has been a member of the production staff as the warmup man for the audience since Harvey took over, became the announcer at the start of the 2015–2016 season and has retained the role since.

The first four versions of the show were directed by Paul Alter and produced by Howard Felsher and Cathy Dawson. For the 1988 versions, Gary Dawson worked with the show as a third producer, and Alter was joined by two other directors, Marc Breslow and Andy Felsher. The 1999 version&#x27;s main staff include executive producer Gabrielle Johnston, co-executive producers Kristin Bjorklund, Brian Hawley and Sara Dansby, and director Ken Fuchs; Johnston and Bjorklund previously worked as associate producers of the 1980s version. The show&#x27;s classic theme tune was written by an uncredited Walt Levinsky for Score Productions. The theme and cues for the 1994–1995 version was written by Edd Kalehoff and are based on the Walt Levinsky composition. The themes used from 1999 to 2008 were written by John Lewis Parker. The production rights to the show were originally owned by the production company Goodson shared with his partner Bill Todman, but were sold to their current holder, Fremantle, when it acquired all of Goodson and Todman&#x27;s format catalog in 2002.

== Broadcast history ==

=== 1976–1985 ===
Mark Goodson created &quot;Family Feud&quot; during the increasing popularity of his earlier game show, &quot;Match Game&quot;, which had set daytime ratings records between 1973 and 1976, and on which Dawson appeared daily as one of its most popular panelists. &quot;Match Game&quot; aired on CBS, and by 1976, CBS vice-president Fred Silverman, who had originally commissioned &quot;Match Game&quot;, had moved to a new position as president of ABC. The show, along with a revised daytime schedule for the summer, was first announced by ABC at an annual meeting in May. The show premiered on ABC&#x27;s daytime lineup at 1:30 p.m. (ET)/12:30 p.m. (CT/MT/PT) on July 12, 1976. Because it faced the first halves of two long-running and popular soap operas, CBS&#x27; &quot;As the World Turns&quot; and NBC&#x27;s &quot;Days of Our Lives,&quot; &quot;Feud&quot; was not an immediate hit. But a timeslot change several months later made it a ratings winner for ABC, and it eventually surpassed &quot;Match Game&quot; to become the highest-rated game show on daytime TV.

Due to the expansion of &quot;All My Children&quot; to one hour in April 1977, the show was moved to 11:30/10:30 a.m., as the second part of an hour that had daytime reruns of &quot;Happy Days&quot; (later &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot;) as its lead-in. When the Dick Clark-hosted &quot;$20,000 Pyramid&quot; was canceled in June 1980, &quot;Feud&quot; moved a half-hour back to 12 noon/11:00 a.m. It remained the most popular daytime game show until Merv Griffin&#x27;s game show &quot;Wheel of Fortune,&quot; propelled by a new, highly-popular concurrent syndicated evening version, surpassed it in 1984. From May 8, 1978 until May 25, 1984, ABC periodically broadcast hour-long primetime &quot;All-Star Specials&quot;, in which celebrity casts from various primetime TV series (mostly ABC ones) competed instead of ordinary families.

The popularity of the program inspired Goodson to consider producing a nighttime edition, which launched in syndication on September 19, 1977 with Viacom Enterprises as distributor. Like many other game shows at the time, the nighttime &quot;Feud&quot; aired once a week; it expanded to twice a week in January 1979, and finally to five nights a week (Monday through Friday) in the fall of 1980, representing the first time that a weekday network game ran concurrently with a nightly syndicated edition. Dawson and &quot;Feud&quot; coasted for several years at the top, seen twice a day in much of the country.

However, the viewing habits of both daytime and syndicated audiences began changing around 1984. When Griffin launched &quot;Wheel&quot;″s syndicated version, starring Pat Sajak and Vanna White, in 1983, that show climbed the ratings to the point where it unseated &quot;Feud&quot; as the highest-rated syndicated show, even replacing it on some stations; the syndicated premiere of &quot;Wheel&quot;″s sister show &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; with Alex Trebek as host also siphoned ratings from &quot;Feud&quot; with its early (and surprising, given an unstable first few months) success. With declining ratings (probably due mainly to its overexposure and viewers subsequently tiring of the show), and as part of a scheduling reshuffle with two of ABC&#x27;s half-hour soaps, the show moved back to the 11:30/10:30 timeslot in October 1984, as the second part of a one-hour game show block with &quot;Trivia Trap&quot; (later &quot;All-Star Blitz&quot;) as its lead-in, hoping to make a dent in the ratings of &quot;The Price Is Right,&quot; coincidentally another Goodson-packaged show. Dawson also was growing increasingly exhausted with his workload. Having worked the equivalent of &quot;eleven years&quot; as host of &quot;Feud&quot;, as he told the Archive of American Television in 2010, Dawson did not want to continue in his role much longer. 

At 1984 was drawing to a close, ABC had not made a final decision on the fate of &quot;Feud&quot; but was expected not to renew its contract beyond the spring of 1985 when it came due. Viacom, on the other hand, had shown interest in bringing back the syndicated series and approached Dawson to gauge his interest. Dawson made clear that, even if ABC went ahead with a renewal, he would focus solely on hosting the syndicated series for 1985-86 and leave the program at the season&#x27;s conclusion.

However, in the interim, Viacom received a bit of news from NBC, which had been airing the syndicated &quot;Feud&quot; on its owned-and-operated stations in Prime Time Access slots since the beginning. Citing the downturn in ratings, NBC informed Viacom it would not be renewing its contract to continue airing the game show after the season concluded. Viacom decided not to try to find replacement slots on other stations in those markets, feeling it would lose more ratings ground, and shortly thereafter informed Dawson that they were not renewing &quot;Feud&quot; for another year; Viacom made this official at the 1985 NATPE convention in January. 

The ABC series, which had already been cancelled, came to an end on June 14, 1985. The final week was taped a month prior, on May 16. Newspapers via &quot;Associated Press&quot; reported that this version was slated to end on June 28. However, for reasons undisclosed, it ended two weeks prior to that instead. The syndicated version aired its last new episode on May 17, 1985, with reruns of the final season continuing until September of that year. Although first-run episodes were no longer airing, Viacom offered a &quot;best of&quot; package of reruns to stations for the 1985-86 season; the package was withdrawn from syndication at the end of the season.

=== 1988–1995 ===
&quot;Family Feud&quot; moved to CBS with Ray Combs hosting the show on July 4, 1988 at 10:00 a.m. (ET)/9:00 a.m. (CT/MT/PT), replacing &quot;The $25,000 Pyramid&quot; (which had aired continuously in that time slot since September 1982, except between January and April 1988, when &quot;Blackout&quot; took its place; CBS began development on &quot;Family Feud&quot; shortly after &quot;Blackout&quot; was canceled). Like its predecessor, this version had an accompanying syndicated edition which premiered September 19, 1988 and both editions started off well in the ratings.

However, the landscape in both daytime and first-run syndication was changing significantly during this time. Networks were starting to move away from game shows in their daytime lineups by the time the &quot;Feud&quot; revival launched in 1988; by the fall of 1991, only the daytime &quot;Feud&quot; and &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;, both airing on CBS, were left standing. &quot;Feud&quot;, like some others before it, was also prone to being preempted by CBS stations who wanted to air more profitable and successful syndicated offerings in the morning.

With the ratings for the daytime series at a low point in 1992, the producers of &quot;Feud&quot; instituted the afore-mentioned format changes, expanded it to an hour and renamed it &quot;Family Feud Challenge&quot;, which saw two families compete in the first half of the hour to face the returning champion family in the second half. The changes did not do enough for CBS, which publicly announced in November 1992 that it would return the 10:00 AM hour to its affiliates the following fall, effectively canceling &quot;Feud&quot;; the Daytime version ended March 26, 1993, with reruns continuing to air until September 10.

The syndicated series, however, remained in production and entered its sixth season in September 1993. However, the series had also been struggling in the ratings for several years. While initially receiving desirable time slots such as the Prime Access slots it had previously enjoyed in some markets, it began to lose ground as stations looked elsewhere for programming; for example, tabloid newsmagazines like &quot;A Current Affair&quot;, &quot;Inside Edition&quot;, &quot;Hard Copy&quot; and &quot;American Journal&quot; tended to draw better ratings, especially among younger demographics. The syndicated series found itself disappearing from some markets, while others saw the show relocated to much less desirable time slots such as the overnight hours. Ratings had virtually bottomed out during the 1992—93 television season and prior to the start of the sixth season, All American Television, which had acquired the assets of &quot;Feud&#x27;s&quot; former syndicator, LBS Communications, met with the production staff of &quot;Feud&quot; and told them that the upcoming season would be their last as distributor, unless significant changes were made to the production.

Meanwhile, during the previous season, a shakeup had occurred at Mark Goodson Productions. Towards the end of 1992, company namesake Mark Goodson died of pancreatic cancer. His son Jonathan had taken over control of the production company and was now tasked with finding a solution to the ratings decline. One of the options considered was a host change, with original &quot;Feud&quot; host Richard Dawson&#x27;s name being repeatedly mentioned as an option. Dawson had largely kept out of the spotlight since the original edition of &quot;Feud&quot; had left the air in 1985, with his only role of note being his turn as Damon Killian in the 1987 film &quot;The Running Man&quot;. In the intervening years, outside of a failed pilot for a revival of &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot;, Dawson had been living with his most recent wife, a former contestant on the series, and was raising a child with her. He did show some interest in returning, however, and began talking with Goodson about a return.

The decision to attempt to bring back Dawson was a reversal from the decision made when the revival was first proposed. Mark Goodson himself had steadfastly refused to consider Dawson for the hosting position, due in large part to his behavior and clashes with the production staff when he hosted the original series. Many of those same staff members were working on the current series, including Felsher, with whom Dawson&#x27;s relationship was particularly acrimonious. The elder Goodson also showed significant loyalty toward Combs as host, sticking with him despite the show&#x27;s struggles, but with him deceased, Dawson signed on to come back to his former position, and All American Television renewed the syndicated &quot;Feud&quot; for the following season. Combs was allowed to finish the season, and with his final episode, he tersely addressed how being displaced made him feel like &quot;a loser&quot; and brusquely left the studio as the credits rolled. Combs committed suicide two years later, in part because of the career collapse brought on by the hosting change and the financial ramifications of unemployment.

A revamped &quot;Family Feud&quot; returned for a seventh season in September 1994 with a significant number of changes made. In addition to Dawson&#x27;s return and a modernizing of the show&#x27;s set, the &quot;Family Feud Challenge&quot; format was reinstated as the show expanded to a full hour. However, the stations that were airing the show had the option to not air the first half of the program and instead simply carry the second half as a standalone half-hour. Dawson&#x27;s return brought an initial surge in ratings, but it was not sustainable long term, and Dawson&#x27;s (and the run&#x27;s) last episode as host aired on May 26, 1995. The show continued in reruns until September 8 of that year.

=== 1999–present ===
&quot;Family Feud&quot; returned in syndication on September 20, 1999, with comedian Louie Anderson as the next host. Three years later, Richard Karn took over the series, at which point the format was changed to reintroduce returning champions, allowing them to appear for up to five days. At the time, Anderson-hosted episodes continued in reruns that aired on PAX TV/Ion Television following his departure. 

In a 2024 interview, Karn stated that the producers of &quot;Family Feud&quot; originally wanted Al Roker to replace Anderson following his departure, however, Roker turned down the opportunity as he did not want to leave New York City, leading the producers to choose Karn as host. Karn jokingly said that he was chosen as he was &quot;the next Al on the list&quot; referencing his character Al Borland on the ABC show &quot;Home Improvement&quot;. Roker would ultimately host the first season of &quot;Celebrity Family Feud&quot; on NBC, which aired in summer 2008. 

Karn hosted the show for four years until he was replaced by John O&#x27;Hurley in 2006. By 2010, the show&#x27;s Nielsen ratings were at 1.5, putting it in danger of cancellation once again (as countless affiliates that carried the show from 1999 to 2010 aired it in daytime, graveyard or other low-rated time slots). That same year, O&#x27;Hurley left the show after four years and was replaced by Steve Harvey, who has hosted the show ever since.

Since Harvey took over the show, ratings increased by as much as 40%, and within two short years, the show was rated at 4.0, and had become the fifth-most-popular syndicated program. Fox News&#x27; Paulette Cohn argued that Harvey&#x27;s &quot;relatability,&quot; or &quot;understanding of what the people at home want to know,&quot; was what saved the show from cancellation; Harvey himself debated, &quot;If someone said an answer that was so ridiculous, I knew that the people at home behind the camera had to be going, &#x27;What did they just say?&#x27; ... They gave this answer that doesn&#x27;t have a shot in hell of being up there. The fact that I recognize that, that&#x27;s comedic genius to me. I think that&#x27;s [what made] the difference.&quot;

Steve Harvey&#x27;s &quot;Family Feud&quot; has regularly ranked among the top 10 highest-rated programs in all of daytime television programming and third among game shows (behind &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; and &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;); in February 2014, the show achieved a 6.0 share in the Nielsen ratings, with approximately 8.8 million viewers. In June 2015, &quot;Family Feud&quot; eclipsed &quot;Wheel of Fortune,&quot; which had been on top for over 30 years, as the most-watched syndicated game show on television, and consistently began ranking among the top three shows in all of syndication. The show has had improved syndication clearances and better timeslots. It has been airing in early fringe and prime access slots nationwide.

Production of &quot;Family Feud&quot; was shifted from Universal Orlando to Harvey&#x27;s hometown of Atlanta in 2011, first staged at the Atlanta Civic Center from 2011 to 2015 and later at the Georgia World Congress Center from 2015 to 2017 and from 2020 to 2021. Harvey was also originating a syndicated radio show from Atlanta, and the state of Georgia provided tax credits for the production. In 2017, production moved to Los Angeles Center Studios (later moved again to Universal Studios Hollywood and later still to CBS Studio Center) in Los Angeles to accommodate Harvey&#x27;s new syndicated talk show &quot;Steve&quot;, returning production of the regular series to Los Angeles for the first time since 2010.

In March 2020, after initially announcing that production would continue with no studio audience, Fremantle suspended production of all of its programs (including &quot;Family Feud&quot;) due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. In August 2020, &quot;Family Feud&quot; returned to production, returning to the state of Georgia after several years in California and with health and safety protocols (including social distancing and no studio audience) being enforced.

From 2021 to 2024, the series was filmed at the Cathy Family-owned Trilith Studios in Fayetteville, Georgia. In early 2024, production of &quot;Family Feud&quot; moved back to Atlanta, and was moved to Tyler Perry Studios on the site of the historic Fort McPherson.

In February 2023, &quot;Family Feud&quot; was renewed for three more seasons, taking the show through May 2026.

=== Reruns ===
Reruns of episodes hosted by Dawson, Combs, Anderson, and Karn have been included among Buzzr&#x27;s acquisitions since its launch on June 1, 2015. Dawson&#x27;s and Combs&#x27;s episodes also air as part of Family Feud Classic, a free ad-supported streaming television channel offered through Pluto TV. In 2019, reruns of the Karn-hosted episodes started airing on Up TV during the morning hours.

== Reception ==
&quot;Family Feud&quot; won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Game/Audience Participation Show in 1977 and 2019, Outstanding Directing for a Game Show and the show has won the Daytime Emmy for Outstanding Game Show Host, once with Dawson in 1978 and three times with Harvey in 2014, 2017 and 2022. &quot;Feud&quot; ranked number 3 on Game Show Network (GSN)&#x27;s 2006 list of the 50 Greatest Game Shows of All Time, and also on &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s 2013 list of the 60 greatest game shows ever.

Tara Ariano and Sarah D. Bunting, founders of the website Television Without Pity, wrote that they hated the 1999 syndicated version, saying &quot;Give us classic &quot;Feud&quot; every time&quot;, citing both Dawson and Combs as hosts. Additionally, they called Anderson an &quot;alleged sexual harasser and full-time sphere&quot;.

In more recent seasons, the show has become notorious for pushing the envelope with questions and responses that are sexual in nature, with content frequently referring to certain anatomy or acts of intercourse. This type of material has drawn criticism from viewers, including former &quot;NCIS&quot; actress Pauley Perrette, who in 2018 sent a series of tweets to &quot;Family Feud&quot; producers questioning why the show had to be &quot;so filthy.&quot; Dan Gainor of the Media Research Center, a politically conservative content analysis organization, suggested that the responses are in line with sexual content becoming more commonplace on television.

The popularity of &quot;Family Feud&quot; in the United States has led it to become a worldwide franchise, with over 50 adaptations outside the United States. Countries that have aired their own versions of the show include Australia, Canada, Colombia, France, Germany, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the Philippines, Poland, Russia, Thailand, the United Kingdom (known as Family Fortunes), South Africa, and Vietnam, among others.

== Merchandise ==

Since the show&#x27;s premiere in 1976, many home versions of &quot;Family Feud&quot; have been released in various formats. Milton Bradley, Pressman Games, and Endless Games have all released traditional board games based on the show, while Imagination Entertainment released the program in a DVD game format.

The game has been released in other formats by multiple companies; Coleco Adam released the first computer version of the show in 1983, and Sharedata followed in 1987 with versions for MS-DOS, Commodore 64, and Apple II computers. GameTek released versions for Nintendo Entertainment System, Super NES, Genesis, 3DO, and IBM PC compatibles (on CD-ROM) between 1990 and 1995. Hasbro Interactive released a version in 2000 for the PC and PlayStation. In 2006, versions were released for PlayStation 2, Game Boy Advance, and Microsoft Windows. Seattle-based Mobliss Inc. also released a mobile version of &quot;Family Feud&quot; that was available on Sprint, Verizon, and Cingular. Glu Mobile later released a newer mobile version of &quot;Family Feud&quot; for other carriers.

In conjunction with Ludia, Ubisoft has published &quot;Family Feud&quot; video games for multiple platforms. The first of these was entitled &quot;Family Feud: 2010 Edition&quot; and was released for the Wii, Nintendo DS, and PC in September 2009. Ubisoft then released &quot;Family Feud Decades&quot; the next year, which featured sets and survey questions from television versions of all four decades the show has been on air. A third game, entitled &quot;Family Feud: 2012 Edition&quot; was released for the Wii and Xbox 360 in 2011. A fourth game, produced by Ubisoft and developed by Snap Finger Click, was released for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and Stadia in 2020.

In addition to the home games, a DVD set titled &quot;All-Star Family Feud starring Richard Dawson&quot; was released on January 8, 2008, by BCI Eclipse LLC Home Entertainment (under license from Fremantle USA) and featured a total of 43 segments taken from 21 special celebrity episodes from the original ABC/syndicated versions on its four discs, uncut and remastered from original 2&quot; videotapes for optimal video presentation and sound quality. It was reissued as &quot;The Best of All-Star Family Feud&quot; on February 2, 2010.

== International versions ==
=== Family Feud Africa ===
&quot;Family Feud Africa&quot;, also hosted by Steve Harvey, began production after season 21 of the American version completed production in December 2019. It began airing on April 5, 2020. The countries included in this version are Ghana and South Africa. In conjunction, a website was launched dedicated to the region to catch up on previous episodes, submit entries and engage from a local perspective. Similar to the pre-1992 United States rules, families win money based on their main game score. Both families earn R50 per point with the higher scoring family playing Fast Money. The first and second rounds are single, the third and fourth rounds are double, and the fifth round is triple. For Fast Money, families play for R75,000, with a loss earning the family R150 per point.

Another spin-off show, titled &quot;Family Feud Botswana&quot;, hosted by Steve Harvey, began airing on February 9, 2025. The rules are identical to &quot;Family Feud Africa&quot;, where every point is worth P50, though the family that reaches 200 points in Fast Money would win P50,000.

<text>Alton ( ) is a village in Staffordshire, England. It is noted for the theme park Alton Towers, built around the site of Alton Mansion, which was owned by the Earls of Shrewsbury, and designed by Augustus Pugin. In the 1914 map by Whiston, there were copper works in the village.

The village is on the eastern side of the Churnet. It is mentioned in the Domesday Book, and contains numerous buildings of architectural interest; the Round-House, Alton Castle (now a Catholic youth retreat centre), St Peter&#x27;s Church, The Malt House, St John&#x27;s Church and Alton Towers.

Alton was served by the Alton railway station which was opened by the North Staffordshire Railway on 13 July 1849 and closed in January 1965.

The Chained Oak in Alton has been made famous by the ride Hex – The Legend of the Towers at Alton Towers and the legend involving the Earl of Shrewsbury.

<text>John of Salisbury (late 1110s – 25 October 1180), who described himself as Johannes Parvus (&quot;John the Little&quot;), was an English author, philosopher, educationalist, diplomat and bishop of Chartres. Among all the distinguished figures of his age (he) stands out as the most notable representative of that revival of learning which gave the title &quot;medieval renaissance&quot; to the twelfth century.

==Early life and education==
Born at Salisbury, England, he was of Anglo-Saxon rather than of Norman extraction, and therefore apparently a clerk from a modest background, whose career depended upon his education. Beyond that, and that he applied to himself the cognomen of &quot;Parvus&quot;, meaning &quot;short&quot; or &quot;small&quot;, few details are known regarding his early life. From his own statements it is gathered that he crossed to France about 1136, and began regular studies in Paris under Peter Abelard, who had for a brief period re-opened his famous school there on Montagne Sainte-Geneviève.

His vivid accounts of teachers and students provide some of the most valuable insights into the early days of the University of Paris. When Abelard withdrew from Paris, John studied under Master Alberic and Robert of Melun. In 1137, John went to Chartres, where he studied grammar under William of Conches, and rhetoric, logic and the classics under Richard l&#x27;Evêque, a disciple of Bernard of Chartres. Bernard&#x27;s teaching was distinguished partly by its pronounced Platonic tendency, and partly by the stress laid upon literary study of the greater Latin writers. The influence of the latter feature is noticeable in all of John of Salisbury&#x27;s works.

Around 1140 John returned to Paris to study theology under Gilbert de la Porrée, then under Robert Pullus and Simon of Poissy, supporting himself as a tutor to young noblemen. In 1148, he resided at the Abbey of Moutiers-la-Celle in the diocese of Troyes, with his friend Peter of Celle. He was present at the Council of Reims in 1148, presided over by Pope Eugene III. It is conjectured that while there, he was introduced by St. Bernard of Clairvaux to Theobald, whose secretary he became.

==Secretary to the Archbishop of Canterbury==
John of Salisbury was secretary to Archbishop Theobald for seven years. While at Canterbury he became acquainted with Thomas Becket, one of the significant potent influences in John&#x27;s life. During this period he went on many missions to the Papal See; it was probably on one of these that he made the acquaintance of Nicholas Breakspear, who in 1154 became Pope Adrian IV. The following year John visited him, remaining at Benevento with him for several months. He was at the court of Rome at least twice afterward.

During this time John composed his greatest works, published almost certainly in 1159, the &quot;Policraticus, sive de nugis curialium et de vestigiis philosophorum&quot; and the &quot;Metalogicon&quot;, writings invaluable as storehouses of information regarding the matter and form of scholastic education, and remarkable for their cultivated style and humanist tendency. The &quot;Policraticus&quot; also sheds light on the decadence of the 12th-century court manners and the lax morals of royalty. The idea of contemporaries &quot;standing on the shoulders of giants&quot; of Antiquity, attributed by him to Bernard of Chartres, first appears in written form in the &quot;Metalogicon&quot;. The &quot;Metalogicon&quot; consists of four books starting with defending the &quot;trivium&quot; and extending further to comments on other areas of logic. John defends the &quot;trivium&quot; by stating socialization is a critical part of human nature and well-being, while in the past Cornificius and his followers argued verbal arts should not be included in logic as they are nearly &quot;useless&quot;. After the death of Theobald in 1161, John continued as secretary to his successor, Thomas Becket, and took an active part in the long disputes between that primate and his sovereign, Henry II, who looked upon John as a papal agent.

John&#x27;s letters throw light on the constitutional struggle then agitating England. In 1163, John fell into disfavor with the king for reasons that remain obscure, and withdrew to France. The next six years he spent with his friend Peter of La Celle, now Abbot of St. Remigius at Reims. Here he wrote &quot;Historia Pontificalis&quot;. In 1170, he led the delegation charged with preparing for Becket&#x27;s return to England, and was in Canterbury at the time of Becket&#x27;s assassination. In 1174, John became treasurer of Exeter cathedral.

==Bishop of Chartres==
In 1176, he was made bishop of Chartres, where he passed the remainder of his life. In 1179, he took an active part in the Third Council of the Lateran. He died at or near Chartres on 25 October 1180.

==Scholarship and influences==
It is important to note that many of John&#x27;s works were not valued during his time. Many of these works survived only because they were copied into manuscripts that contained more popular works. It is still being disputed whether certain works were authored by John of Salisbury. John&#x27;s writings are excellent at clarifying the literary and scientific position of 12th-century Western Europe. Though he was well versed in the new logic and dialectical rhetoric of the university, John&#x27;s views also imply a cultivated intelligence well versed in practical affairs, opposing to the extremes of both nominalism and realism a practical common sense. His doctrine draws on the literary skepticism of Cicero, for whom he had unbounded admiration and on whose style he based his own. His view that the end of education was moral, rather than merely intellectual, became one of the prime educational doctrines of Western civilization. This moral vision of education shares more in common with the tradition of monastic education which preceded his own Scholastic age, and with the vision of education which re-emerges in the worldview of Renaissance humanism.

Of Greek writers he appears to have known nothing at first hand, and very little in translations, but he was one of the best Latinists of his age. The &quot;Timaeus&quot; of Plato in the Latin version of Chalcidius was known to him as to his contemporaries and predecessors, and probably he had access to translations of the &quot;Phaedo&quot; and &quot;Meno&quot;. Of Aristotle he possessed the whole of the &quot;Organon&quot; in Latin; he is, indeed, the first of the medieval writers of note to whom the whole was known.

He first coined the term &quot;theatrum mundi&quot;, a notion that influences the theater several centuries later. In several chapters of the third book of his &quot;Policraticus&quot;, he meditates on the fact that &quot;the life of man on earth is a comedy, where each forgetting his own plays another&#x27;s role&quot;.

=== Philosophical views ===
John of Salisbury was a follower of the Ciceronian perspective. Followers of this perspective believed that things could be definitively proven, but still left open to be challenged. John emphasized this belief in both the &quot;Policraticus&quot; and the &quot;Metalogicon&quot;. Following the worldview of Cicero, John of Salisbury dissociated himself from the extreme skepticism some of his fellow academics held. John instead held the view of moderate skepticism. In this worldview, there are three bases for which knowledge can be based in certainty. These bases are: Faith, reason, and the senses. This structure allowed for philosophers to think and discuss without having to question the existence of God or question other structures which were to not be questioned in their time.

John of Salisbury&#x27;s belief of moderate skepticism carried over into his other views of life. John detested the philosophy of Epicureanism, deeming it to be the opposite of moderation. John found some values in the teaching of Epicurus, but his criticisms were more directed to the followers of Epicureanism. He believed that Epicureans didn&#x27;t correctly follow Epicurus&#x27;s original philosophy and used it to indulge in unbridled hedonism. John argued that this form of Epicureanism would not allow its followers to achieve true happiness. John of Salisbury also criticized Epicureans who did not identify themselves as such. This pertained to individuals who were overly hedonistic and only ever served their own needs. Having not had wide access to ancient philosophers who challenged Epicurus&#x27;s ideas, it is most likely that John of Salisbury came to his conclusions based on his own life experiences and observations. Similarly to the Epicureans, John also detested the philosophies of Cornificius and his followers. However, he detested their philosophies because they attempted to reject the &quot;trivium&quot;.

However, John viewed the presence of any philosophical thought in humans as critical, despite his criticisms of certain philosophies. John believed that the capacity for logic was a natural dividing line between humans and lesser-sentient creatures. He stated that philosophy was essential to human health and mental well-being, while humans lacking philosophical thought were akin to feral creatures incapable of rationalization. This is also why John argued so strongly for the &quot;trivium&quot;, viewing socialization as an important aspect of sharing and enhancing philosophical thought—also contributing to well-being.

=== Medical views ===

John of Salisbury was fairly vocal about his criticisms of the medical system during his time, writing about it in both the &quot;Policraticus&quot; and the &quot;Metalogicon.&quot; He expressed his belief that medical science should have more balance between theory and practice; and his concern that the medical system had become corrupt. John of Salisbury believed medical science was important; however, he criticized the physicians practicing medicine for being seemingly more focused on personal gain than helping patients. Physicians who relied too much on inquiry began speculating about how the soul relates to health, which John believed impractical because it could not be tested and trespassed on religious belief. John believed, as a result, that theoretical physicians often ignored natural, tangible causes of illness in the body. On the other hand, he stated practical physicians chose to ignore their potential faults and chance for inquiry; making the claim that there is nothing they could have done better or differently if their patient succumbed to their illness. John argued instead that there should be an equal balance between seeking out new truths and practicing or pursuing those new truths. Due to the progressing division between the two types of physicians, John of Salisbury also argued they had begun diversifying the medical language used to a point where it was becoming more confusing than beneficial to clients. John posed the argument that physicians should focus more on a balance of both inquiry and practice while using a set of steps for treatment he coined as the &quot;regularum compendium&quot;: find the source of the illness, focus on healing the illness, and then perform aftercare to restore the health of the patient and prevent future illnesses from surfacing in the first place.

==Fictional portrayals==
John was portrayed by actor Alex G. Hunter in the 1924 silent film &quot;Becket&quot;, based on the play of the same title by Alfred Lord Tennyson.

<doc id="153694" wikidata="Q2353049" url="?curid=153694" title="Firebombing">
<text>Firebombing is a bombing technique designed to damage a target, generally an urban area, through the use of fire, caused by incendiary devices, rather than from the blast effect of large bombs. In popular usage, any act in which an incendiary device is used to initiate a fire is often described as a &quot;firebombing&quot;. 

Although simple incendiary bombs have been used to destroy buildings since the start of gunpowder warfare, World War I saw the first use of strategic bombing from the air to damage the morale and economy of the enemy, such as the German Zeppelin air raids conducted on London. The Chinese wartime capital of Chongqing was firebombed by the Imperial Japanese starting in early 1939 during the Second Sino-Japanese War. London, Coventry, and many other British cities were firebombed during the Blitz by Nazi Germany. Most large German cities were extensively firebombed starting in 1942, and almost all large Japanese cities were firebombed during the last six months of World War II.

This technique makes use of small incendiary bombs possibly delivered by a cluster bomb, such as the Molotov bread basket. If a fire catches, it could spread, taking in adjacent buildings that would have been largely unaffected by a high explosive bomb. This is a more effective use of the payload that a bomber could carry.

The use of incendiaries alone does not generally start uncontrollable fires where the targets are roofed with nonflammable materials such as tiles or slates. The use of a mixture of bombers carrying high explosive bombs, such as the British blockbuster bombs, which blew out windows and roofs and exposed the interior of buildings to the incendiary bombs, is much more effective. Alternatively, a preliminary bombing with conventional bombs can be followed by subsequent attacks by incendiary carrying bombers.

==Tactics==


Early in World War II many British cities were firebombed. Two particularly notable raids were the Coventry Blitz on 14 November 1940, and the blitz on London on the night of 29 December/30 December 1940, which was the most destructive raid on London during the war with much of the destruction caused by fires started by incendiary bombs. During the Coventry Blitz the Germans pioneered several innovations which were to influence all future strategic bomber raids during the war. These were: the use of pathfinder aircraft with electronic aids to navigate, to mark the targets before the main bomber raid; and the use of high explosive bombs and air-mines coupled with thousands of incendiary bombs intended to set the city ablaze. The first wave of follow-up bombers dropped high explosive bombs, the intent of which was to knock out the utilities (the water supply, electricity network and gas mains), and to crater the road — making it difficult for the fire engines to reach fires started by the successive waves of bombers. The follow-up waves dropped a combination of high explosive and incendiary bombs. There were two types of incendiary bombs: those made of magnesium and iron powders, and those made of petroleum. The high-explosive bombs and the larger air-mines were not only designed to hamper the Coventry fire brigade, they were also intended to damage roofs, making it easier for the incendiary bombs to fall into buildings and ignite them. As Sir Arthur Harris, commander of RAF Bomber Command, wrote after the war:

The tactical innovation of the bomber stream was developed by the RAF to overwhelm the German aerial defenses of the Kammhuber Line during World War II to increase the RAF&#x27;s concentration in time over the target. But after the lessons learned during the Blitz, the tactic of dropping a high concentration of bombs over the target in the shortest time possible became standard in the RAF as it was more effective than a longer raid. For example, during the Coventry Blitz on the night of 14/15 November 1940, 515 Luftwaffe bombers, many flying more than one sortie against Coventry, delivered their bombs over a period of time lasting more than 10 hours. In contrast, the much more devastating raid on Dresden on the night of 13/14 of February 1945 by two waves of the RAF Bomber Command&#x27;s main force, involved their bombs being released at 22:14, with all but one of the 254 Lancaster bombers releasing their bombs within two minutes, and the last one released at 22:22. The second wave of 529 Lancasters dropped all of their bombs between 01:21 and 01:45. This means that in the first raid, on average, one Lancaster dropped a full load of bombs every half a second and in the second larger raid that involved more than one RAF bomber Group, one every three seconds.

The United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) officially only bombed precision targets over Europe, but for example, when 316 B-17 Flying Fortresses bombed Dresden in a follow-up raid at around noon on 14 February 1945, because of clouds the later waves bombed using H2X radar for targeting. The mix of bombs to be used on the Dresden raid was about 40% incendiaries, much closer to the RAF city-busting mix than the bomb-load usually used by the Americans in precision bombardments. This was quite a common mix when the USAAF anticipated cloudy conditions over the target.

In its attacks on Japan, the USAAF abandoned its precision bombing method that was used in Europe before and adopted a policy of saturation bombing, using incendiaries to burn Japanese-held cities including Wuhan, and the cities of the Japanese home islands. These tactics were used to devastating effect with many urban areas burned out. The first incendiary raid by B-29 Superfortress bombers was against Kobe on 4 February 1945, with 69 B-29s arriving over the city at an altitude of , dropping 152 tons of incendiaries and 14 tons of fragmentation bombs to destroy about . The next mission was another high altitude daylight incendiary raid against Tokyo on 25 February when 172 B-29s destroyed around of the snow-covered city, dropping 453.7 tons of mostly incendiaries with some fragmentation bombs. Changing to low-altitude night tactics to concentrate the fire damage while minimizing the effectiveness of fighter and artillery defenses, the Operation Meetinghouse raid carried out by 279 B-29s raided Tokyo again on the night of 9/10 March, dropped 1,665 tons of incendiaries from altitudes of , mostly using the E-46 cluster bomb which released 38 M-69 oil-based incendiary bombs at an altitude of . A lesser number of M-47 incendiaries was dropped: the M-47 was a jelled-gasoline and white phosphorus bomb which ignited upon impact. In the first two hours of the raid, 226 of the attacking aircraft or 81% unloaded their bombs to overwhelm the city&#x27;s fire defenses. The first to arrive dropped bombs in a large X pattern centered in Tokyo&#x27;s working class district near the docks; later aircraft simply aimed near this flaming X. Approximately of the city were destroyed and 100,000 people are estimated to have died in the resulting conflagration, more than the immediate deaths of either the atomic bombings of Hiroshima or Nagasaki. After this raid, the USAAF continued with low-altitude incendiary raids against Japan&#x27;s cities, destroying an average of 40% of the built-up area of 64 of the largest cities.

<doc id="153695" wikidata="Q1602844" url="?curid=153695" title="Wilbur Sweatman">
<text>Wilbur Coleman Sweatman (February 7, 1882 – March 9, 1961) was an American ragtime and dixieland jazz composer, bandleader and clarinetist. Sweatman was one of the first African-American musicians to have fans nationwide. He was also a trailblazer in the racial integration of musical groups. 

==Early life==
Sweatman was born February 7, 1882, in Brunswick, Missouri, to parents Matilda and Coleman Sweatman. Wilbur&#x27;s father ran a barbershop in the riverside town to provide for his family, which also included daughters Eva and Lula. His mother was apparently of mixed racial background as she and the children were listed as mulatto on some census reports. While Wilbur was still a toddler his father abandoned the family, moving to St. Joseph, Missouri, and starting a new family. His mother persevered, continuing to operate the barbershop as well as taking in boarders. Wilbur received his education at the segregated Elliott School in Brunswick and helped out around the barbershop after school. His older sister Eva was responsible for much of Wilbur Sweatman&#x27;s early music training, teaching him to play piano. Later Sweatman would become a self-taught violinist, and subsequently took up the clarinet as well. Over the years he would also learn to play trombone, bass clarinet and organ.

==Music career==
Wilbur Sweatman&#x27;s professional music career began in the late 1890s when, still a teenager, he toured with circus bands, first with Professor Clark Smith&#x27;s Pickaninny Band from Kansas City, then with the P. G. Lowery Band. By 1901 he had become the youngest orchestra leader in America by fronting the Forepaugh and Sells Circus band. Sweatman briefly played with the bands of W.C. Handy and Mahara&#x27;s Minstrels before organizing his own dance band in Minneapolis by late 1902. It was there that Sweatman made his first recordings on phonograph cylinders in 1903 for the Metropolitan Music Store. These included what is reputed to have been the first recorded version of Scott Joplin&#x27;s &quot;Maple Leaf Rag&quot;; no copies are known. In 1908 Sweatman moved to Chicago, playing around the city in places like the Pekin Inn and the Monogram Theater before becoming the bandleader at the Grand Theater, and began to attract notice; a 1910 article referred to his nickname, &quot;Sensational Swet.&quot; As well as performing, Sweatman wrote and arranged music for his band. In addition, he worked with Dave Peyton and William Henry &quot;Billy&quot; Dorsey to arrange and transcribe music for other performers.

By 1911, he had moved to the vaudeville circuit full-time, developing a successful act of playing three clarinets at once. An Indianapolis account described his performance there:
Though somewhat diminutive in stature, Wilbur C. Sweatman has a style and grace of manner in all of his executions that is at once convincing, and the soulfulness of expression that he blends into his tones is something wonderful. His first number was a medley of popular airs and &quot;rags&quot; and had everybody shuffling their pedal extremities before it was half over.

He wrote a number of rags, &quot;Down Home Rag&quot; (1911) being the most commercially successful. The song was recorded by multiple bands in America and Europe. Sweatman moved to New York in 1913, touring widely. He was one of the few black solo acts to appear regularly on the major white vaudeville circuits. Around this time he became close friends with Scott Joplin; Joplin&#x27;s will would name Sweatman as executor of his estate. Joplin&#x27;s musical papers, including unpublished manuscripts, were willed to Sweatman, who took care of them while generously sharing access to those who inquired. However, as Joplin&#x27;s music came to be considered passé, such requests were few. After Sweatman&#x27;s death in 1961, the papers went into storage during a legal battle between Sweatman&#x27;s heirs and their current location is unknown, or even whether they still exist.

In December 1916, Sweatman recorded for minor label Emerson Records, including his own &quot;Down Home Rag&quot;. Some historians consider these recordings among the earliest examples of jazz on record. Taking note of the commercial success of the Original Dixieland Jass Band and the Original Creole Orchestra, Sweatman abruptly changed his sextet&#x27;s sound and instrumentation in early 1917. Sweatman&#x27;s band consisted of five saxophonists and himself on clarinet, a combo which soon signed with Pathé. They recorded rags, as well as some of the hit songs of the day.

Sweatman was the first African American to make recordings labeled as &quot;Jass&quot; and &quot;Jazz&quot;. Since Sweatman can be heard making melodic variations even in his 1916 recordings, it might be argued that Sweatman recorded an archaic type of jazz earlier than the Original Dixieland band. In 1917, he became one of the first blacks to join ASCAP.

In 1918, Sweatman landed with major label Columbia Records, where he would enjoy a meteoric rise with a wide variety of songs under his own name. His band also delivered several shorter anonymous performances for the label&#x27;s &quot;Little Wonder&quot; line of 90-second-long budget releases. The Sweatman band&#x27;s first release, &quot;Regretful Blues&quot;/&quot;Everybody&#x27;s Crazy&quot; would ship 140,000 copies, at a time when a third as many sales was considered a hit. Sweatman singles shipped over a million copies in 1919 alone. Several more successful releases followed in 1918–19, Sweatman&#x27;s peak of popularity. His best-selling song was &quot;Kansas City Blues&quot; (1919), which shipped 180,000 copies. However, by 1920 sales were on the wane, perhaps reflecting the ephemeral interest in his novelty style of jazz, and the growing popularity of syncopated big bands such as Columbia&#x27;s own Ted Lewis.

==Later years==
Sweatman continued to ply his somewhat dated style in live appearances throughout the Northeast. Several notable musicians passed through his band, including Duke Ellington, Coleman Hawkins and Cozy Cole. Sweatman also continued to record for such labels as Gennett, Edison, Grey Gull and Victor. He frequently played at the well known Harlem club Connie&#x27;s Inn. He continued playing in New York through the 1940s and early 1950s, but increasingly concentrated his efforts on the music publishing business and talent booking. His earlier compositions provided Sweatman with a steady income. In 1937 alone, ASCAP reported that &quot;Down Home Rag&quot; had been played on the radio over 2000 times, Sweatman receiving royalties for each play.

Wilbur Sweatman died in New York City on March 9, 1961. His daughter Barbara initially inherited his estate, consisting mostly of his publishing business and some personal papers. The estate, which also included the papers of Scott Joplin, eventually ended up in the hands of Sweatman&#x27;s sister Eva.

<text>Walter Reynolds (died 1327) was Bishop of Worcester and then Archbishop of Canterbury (1313–1327) as well as Lord High Treasurer and Lord Chancellor.

==Early career==

Reynolds was the son of a baker from Windsor, Berkshire, and became a clerk, or chaplain, in the service of Edward I.

Reynolds held several livings and, owing perhaps to his acting skill, he became a prime favourite with the Prince of Wales, afterwards Edward II, whom he served as Keeper of the Great Wardrobe. Just after the prince became king, on 22 August 1307 Reynolds, was appointed Treasurer of England.

On 13 November 1307 Reynolds, who had the living of St Mary&#x27;s Church, Wimbledon was elected Bishop of Worcester and consecrated on 13 October 1308. He was also on 6 July 1310 named Keeper of the Great Seal and Lord Chancellor of England. Amongst his duties as Bishop of Worcester was to act as the patron and appoint the headmaster of the school that later became the Royal Grammar School Worcester.

Reynolds was one of the godfathers of the future Edward III when the prince was christened on 17 November 1312.

== Episcopate ==
When Robert Winchelsea, Archbishop of Canterbury, died in May 1313 Edward II convinced Pope Clement V to appoint his favourite to the vacant archbishopric, and Reynolds was enthroned at Canterbury Cathedral in January 1314 as the 51st Archbishop.

Although the private life of the new archbishop appears to have been the reverse of exemplary, he attempted to carry out some very necessary reforms in his new official capacity; he also continued the struggle for precedence, which had been carried on for many years between the archbishops of Canterbury and of York. In this connection in 1317 he laid London under an interdict after William de Melton, the Archbishop of York, had passed through its streets with his cross borne erect before him.

Reynolds remained in general loyal to Edward II until 1324, when with all his suffragans he opposed the king in defence of the Bishop of Hereford, Adam Orleton. He then fought with Edward II over liturgical issues, and sent sums of money to Queen Isabella in her rebellion against the King. Having fled for safety into Kent he returned to London and declared for Edward III, whom he crowned on 1 February 1327. He was appointed as a member of the regency council for Edward III that was formed in February 1327. In 1327 Reynolds popularised in England the political argument of &quot;vox populi, vox Dei&quot;, contrary to Alcuin&#x27;s original warning to Charlemagne to resist such arguments, as the title of his sermon laying charges against Edward II.

Reynolds died at Mortlake on 16 November 1327.

<doc id="153700" wikidata="Q1234698" url="?curid=153700" title="Avebury (village)">
<text>Avebury () is a village and civil parish in Wiltshire, England. The village is about west of Marlborough and northeast of Devizes. Much of the village is encircled by the prehistoric monument complex also known as Avebury. The parish also includes the small villages of Avebury Trusloe and Beckhampton, and the hamlet of West Kennett.

==Prehistory==

=== Stone circles ===

The Avebury monument is vast, and consists of several smaller sites of varying dates. The earliest of these, the earthworks, dates to between 3400 and 2625 BC. Later additions include a henge and several stone circles. Starting in around the 14th century, locals began dismantling the stone circles for one reason or another: to clear land, to provide material for other building projects, or simply to efface a pagan monument. In 1648 John Aubrey visited the site and found most of the stones still standing or lying nearby:

These Downes looke as if they were Sown with great Stones, very thicke; and in a dusky evening they looke like a flock of Sheep: from whence it takes its name. One might fancy it to have been the Scene where the Giants fought with stones against the Gods... I was wonderfully surprised at the sight of those vast stones, of which I had never heard before; as also at the mighty Banke and Graffe [ditch] about it. I observed in the Inclosures some segments of rude circles, made with these stones, whence I concluded, they had been in old time complete.
In the 18th century, William Stukeley visited the site and chronicled the further damage that had been done. In 1872, the banker and Liberal MP, Sir John Lubbock, bought part of the village and protected the monuments. He later promoted the Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1882 to ensure the British government protected ancient monuments.

In the 1930s, the archaeologist Alexander Keiller re-erected many of the fallen stones, partially restoring the circle to its original condition. In 1943 the government took possession of the monument and the village; they are currently administered by the National Trust. In 1986 UNESCO added Avebury, along with Stonehenge, Silbury Hill, and associated local sites, to its World Heritage List.

=== Other sites ===
The earliest occupied site in the area is on Windmill Hill in the north-west of the parish, where a causewayed enclosure with three concentric ditches was built c.3700 BC on an earlier field system.

Two avenues of standing stones radiate from Avebury henge. Kennet Avenue runs south-east for about from the south entrance of the henge to Overton Hill, just beyond West Kennett hamlet. Originally there were around 100 pairs of stones, and many survive although some are buried or have been re-erected. On the hill stood a stone and timber circle, destroyed in the 18th century, known as The Sanctuary. The second avenue, known as Beckhampton Avenue, consisted of pairs of stones running south-west for about from the west entrance of the henge to a cove known as The Longstones near Beckhampton. Of this avenue, only one stone remains (one of the Longstones); the rest are either buried or missing.

Other prehistoric sites in the parish include Silbury Hill, south of the henge, a chalk and earth mound about high. Further south (on the other side of the A4) is West Kennet Long Barrow, a chambered long barrow. Falkner&#x27;s Circle, 750 metres (820 yards) south-east of the henge, was a stone circle of which one stone remains.

== Modern history ==

The Roman road from Silchester to Bath followed the Kennet valley west from Cunetio (near Marlborough), then continued over West Down. A section of the agger, some 300 metres (yards) long and up to 1 metre (3&#x27;) high, is visible south-west of Beckhampton.

Domesday Book in 1086 recorded a church at &quot;Avreberie&quot; but no further details; the population of the settlement may have been recorded under another estate name. Fourteen households were recorded at &quot;Backentone&quot;, on land held by Gilbert of Bretteville. The village grew around the church and the manor houses of Avebury and Avebury Trusloe. In 1377 there were 134 poll-tax payers in the village, making it one of the largest settlements in Selkley hundred, together with 31 at Beckhampton and 24 at West Kennet.

Henry I granted an estate at Avebury to his chamberlain William de Tancarville, who in 1114 granted it to the Abbey of Saint-Georges, Boscherville, Normandy, leading to the establishment of Avebury Priory. After the expulsion of the alien priories, in 1411 the manor was granted to the collegiate church at Fotheringhay, Northamptonshire. The college exchanged the land with the Crown in 1545, and in 1547 the manor was granted to the courtier Sir William Sharington, who had extensive landholdings in Wiltshire and neighbouring counties. Later owners included William Dunche (from 1551); John Stawell (from 1640); his son Ralph, created Baron Stawell in 1683; Adam Williamson (d.1798), governor of Jamaica; Sir Henry Meux (from 1873), MP and brewery owner, and his son, also Henry. Manor Farm (excluding the manor house) was sold off in 1902, and bought by the National Trust in 1943. The house, Avebury Manor, was bought in 1955 by Sir Francis Knowles, who restored it and began to open it to the public in 1956. After passing through several hands following his death in 1974, the house was bought by the National Trust in 1991.

The land held by the church at the time of the Domesday survey was granted to Cirencester Abbey by Henry III in 1133. In 1604 the rectory estate was granted to the Dunche family, and probably merged with the manor estate.

=== Avebury Trusloe ===
Another manor held by the abbey was bought by Joan Trusloe in 1563, and around 1628 the estate known as Avebury Trusloe was held by William Dunche; he sold it to Sir Edward Baynton in 1633. The Victoria County History traces the later owners including Alexander Keiller, who bought a farm in the 1920s and sold it to the National Trust in 1943. The house known as Trusloe Manor began as a rebuilding c.1520, was later reduced in size to four bays, and in the 1980s gained a large rear wing.

=== Beckhampton ===
Racehorses have been trained at Beckhampton House, using gallops on West Down, since the mid 19th century. Notable trainers include Sam Darling and his son Fred Darling who had nine Derby winners between them in the first half of the 20th century; then Noel Murless between 1948 and 1952, followed by Jeremy Tree, and since 1990 Roger Charlton.

== Geography ==
The River Kennet flows south through the parish, passing just west of Avebury village before turning east near Silbury Hill on its journey towards Marlborough. Higher ground includes Windmill Hill in the northwest corner of the parish, and Avebury Down in the east.

Beckhampton, Avebury Trusloe and Avebury are on the A4361, a renumbered section of the A361 between Devizes and Swindon. The Calne–Marlborough section of the A4 crosses the A361 at Beckhampton and continues east through West Kennet.

==Religious sites==

=== Parish church ===
Pevsner describes the Church of England parish church of St James as &quot;archaeologically uncommonly interesting&quot;. There was a stone church on this site, just west of the prehistoric earthwork, in the 10th century; it had a high and narrow nave without aisles, similar in its proportions to St Laurence&#x27;s Church, Bradford-on-Avon. Parts of this building survive, in quoins at the north-west corner and two small windows at the west end (now internal to the church), which had external shutters rather than glazing. Three circular clerestory windows in the north wall are also Anglo-Saxon.

Aisles were added in the 12th century, the nave walls being pierced by low arches; the aisles were widened in the 15th century and in 1812 the arches were rebuilt to let in more light, but fragments of 12th-century work remain. Pevsner called the newer Tuscan columns &quot;a surprise, but not an unpleasant one&quot;. In the 14th century the south porch was rebuilt, using a 12th-century doorway having two carved orders and a hood mould. The three-stage west tower, with stair-turret, was built around the same time.

The chancel was rebuilt in the 13th century, and again in 1879 during restoration by R. J. Withers. The church was designated as Grade I listed in 1966.

The stone font has carving which is probably from two periods. The lower part has an arcade of intersecting arches with a somewhat chaotic layout, while the upper decoration has foliage scrolls, two serpents or dragons, and a skirted figure which may be Saint Michael, holding a crozier. The font may be Saxon with Norman carving over-cut.

The chancel screen is a design of 1884 by C.E. Ponting, and above it is a 15th-century rood loft with coloured and gilded panels, complete and therefore described as &quot;rare&quot; by Historic England. The timbers of the loft were concealed behind a wall after the Reformation in the 16th century, remained undiscovered until 1810, and then were reinstalled by Ponting in 1878–1884. Monuments inside the church include an elaborate marble wall memorial to Susanna Holford (died 1772).

In 1979 there were five bells in the tower, dating from the 17th and 18th centuries; after the peal was restored in 1981 there were six cast at Whitechapel, and two more were added in 2009. The old tenor bell, cast in 1719 by Richard Phelps (born in Avebury and master of the Whitechapel foundry from 1701 to 1738) now strikes the hours.

The lychgate at the south entrance to the churchyard was designed by Ponting and erected in 1899. A heavy timber frame on low limestone walls, under a tiled roof, it is described by Historic England as a good example of its type.

The benefice was united with Winterbourne Monkton from 1747 to 1864, and again from 1929, although the parishes remained distinct. From 1952 and again from 1963, the incumbent also held the benefice of Berwick Bassett. In 1975 a team ministry was created for the area, and today the parish is part of the Upper Kennet Benefice, alongside seven others around Avebury.

=== Chapels ===
A nonconformist chapel was built inside the stone circle circa 1670, then extended in the 18th century and again in 1830. In the 20th century the congregation joined the United Reformed Church and in 1977 the building was designated as Grade II listed. The building was bought by the National Trust in 2017, regular worship having ceased by 2015, and is operated as an information centre.

A Strict Baptist chapel was built in 1873, replacing a building from the 1820s. The chapel closed circa 1953.

== Notable buildings ==
The parish has three Grade I listed buildings: St James&#x27; church, Avebury Manor, and the Great Barn at Manor Farm, north-east of the church. The late 17th-century barn has nine bays under a thatched roof; it was restored in 1978 and is used as a museum by the National Trust.

Beckhampton House began c.1745 as a large coaching inn on the Bath road; alterations in the 19th century included the addition of a stone porch. Built in brick with limestone sills, the house has three storeys and a five-bay front. Since 1855 it has been the farmhouse for the racehorse stables. A nearby 17th-century house, two storeys in stone with a thatched roof, is now the Waggon and Horses pub; additions in the late 19th century and early 20th are described as picturesque by Historic England.

West Kennett House was built c.1800. A three-storey house with a five-bay brick front and columned porch, it is described by Orbach as &quot;rather urban Late Georgian&quot;.

===Avebury Manor===
Avebury Manor and Garden is a National Trust property in the village, near the church, consisting of the manor house and its garden. The house was begun c.1557 by William Dunch, extended in 1601 and partly rebuilt c.1907; it is Grade I listed. Since 1938 its 18th-century stables have housed a museum, now the Alexander Keiller Museum. A well-preserved 16th-century circular dovecote in the grounds is Grade II* listed.

==Governance==
Avebury is a civil parish with an elected parish council. It is in the area of Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which is responsible for all significant local government functions. For Westminster elections, the parish is within the East Wiltshire constituency.

==Amenities==
The village pub, The Red Lion, a former farmhouse from the late 16th century, claims to be the only pub in the world to be enclosed by a stone circle. It was built around the 86-foot deep village well which has been covered over with glass and now features as a dining table. Another pub, the Waggon and Horses, is about one mile south-west of the village at Beckhampton. The National Trust has a restaurant for visitors in converted farm buildings.

The village has no school, following closure of the primary school in 2007. This school, on the High Street opposite the church, began as a National School in 1844, then was rebuilt in 1849 and enlarged in 1873. In 1970 a new school was built behind the original and the old building became a social club for the community.

==In media==
The stone circle has been used several times as a filming location. It was used in the short film &quot;Lucifer Rising&quot; (1972), and for the 1998 film &quot;Still Crazy&quot;.

Avebury was also the setting for the 1977 cult HTV West series &quot;Children of the Stones&quot; that depicts Avebury (renamed &quot;Millbury&quot;) as a town controlled by the stones. Also in 1977, it was the location for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;A Ghost Story for Christmas&quot; episode &quot;Stigma&quot;.

In 2002, the stones and the Red Lion were the subject of an episode of &quot;Most Haunted&quot;, first shown on Living TV.

Avebury is the setting for Robert Goddard&#x27;s thriller novel, &quot;Sight Unseen&quot; (2005).

Avebury, in particular, The Cove, is the setting for some of the action in and is referred to throughout Elly Griffiths&#x27; novel, &quot;The Stone Circle&quot; (Ruth Galloway, No.11) (2019).

<text>Croxden Abbey, also known as &quot;Abbey of the Vale of St. Mary at Croxden&quot;, was a Cistercian abbey at Croxden, Staffordshire, United Kingdom. A daughter house of the abbey in Aunay-sur-Odon, Normandy, the abbey was founded by Bertram III de Verdun of Alton Castle, Staffordshire, in the 12th century. The abbey was dissolved in 1538.

==History==
===Foundation and early history===

In 1176, Bertram III de Verdun, the lord of the manor of Croxden, endowed a site for a new abbey near Alton, Staffordshire, to a group of 12 Cistercian monks from Aunay-sur-Odon, Normandy. Bertram founded the abbey, like many noblemen of his time, for the souls of his family and on the condition that the monks would celebrate mass &quot;for the souls of Norman de Verdun, my father, and of Lescelina, my mother, and of Richard de Humez, who brought me up, and of my predecessors; and for the well-being of myself and Rohais my wife, and my successors&quot;;

The monks remained at the Alton site until 1179, before moving to land near Croxden, a few miles south. Grants of land were made by Bertram de Verdun to the abbey across Staffordshire, Cheshire, Derbyshire and Leicestershire, along with the churches of Alton and Tugby, and two chapels at Keythorpe and East Norton.

The abbey continued to expand into the 13th century, with King John awarding the monks an annuity of £5 from the Exchequer of Ireland in 1200, before exchanging it for land in Adeney, Shropshire, in 1206. Croxden was relatively prosperous at this time, drawing the majority of its wealth from sheep farming. By 1315, the monks were supplying more wool to the continent than any other religious house in the county, with transactions being recorded with Florentine merchants well into the 1420s. The abbey&#x27;s wealth is reflected in the purchase of a house in London by abbot William of Over for £20.

===Decline and dissolution===
By the 14th century, Croxden&#x27;s financial situation had worsened. The strains of royal taxation, the repayment of loans and the imposition of a corrodian combined with bad harvests and plague were a drain on the abbey&#x27;s resources.

With the death of Theobald II de Verdun, the last of the senior direct male line of the family in 1316, leaving four daughters as his heirs, the patronage of the abbey became the inheritance of the eldest heiress Joan de Verdun, who married secondly Thomas de Furnivall, 2nd Baron Furnivall of Hallamshire, into whose family Alton and Croxden passed. There was a number of serious disputes between the monks and de Furnivall concerning his use of abbey lands and property, culminating in the monks barricading themselves within the abbey for 16 weeks in 1319. It wasn&#x27;t until July 1319, with the help of other local landowners, that the monks received an assize of novel disseisin and their property usage was returned to them.

With an income of less than £200 per year the abbey should have been suppressed under the Suppression of Religious Houses Act 1535, which dictated all religious houses with a low annual income should be dissolved. The monks paid a fine of £100 for a royal licence to continue, until 1537 when the abbey was surrendered and the land and property sold off. The king granted the monks pensions, with the last abbot receiving an annual sum of £26 13s. 4d.

Two 16th-century deeds relating to the abbey&#x27;s property, just prior to its dissolution, are held at the Cadbury Research Library, University of Birmingham.

===After dissolution===
The mid-13th-century chapel survived as the church for the parish of Croxden until 1886, when it was replaced by newer building to the north. In 1936 the site passed into the care of the Ministry of Public Building and Works, and is today managed by English Heritage. The substantial ruins of a number of the buildings are still standing and, thanks to excavations in 1968, the foundations of some demolished buildings are also traceable.

==Layout and architecture==
The design of the church was based on the abbey&#x27;s mother church in Aunay-sur-Odon and is considered more elaborate than most Cistercian architecture. The west wall, including two doorways and lancet windows above them, is still almost complete.

The conventual and service buildings were situated to the south of the church, and include a sacristy, chapterhouse, kitchen and dormitory. The upper floors which included the dormitory and a treasury are no longer extant.

==The Uttoxeter Casket==
The Uttoxeter Casket or Dr Nelson&#x27;s Casket is a wooden Anglo-Saxon reliquary which probably came from Croxden Abbey. It is likely that it held a religious relic and was displayed on an altar. The casket currently resides in the Cleveland Museum of Art in Ohio.

<doc id="153708" wikidata="Q387396" url="?curid=153708" title="Świdnica">
<text>Świdnica (; ; ) is a city on the Bystrzyca River in south-western Poland in the Lower Silesian Voivodeship. As of 2021, it has a population of 55,413 inhabitants. It is the seat of Świdnica County, and also of the smaller district of Gmina Świdnica (although it is not part of the territory of the latter, as the town forms a separate urban gmina). It is the seventh largest city of the Lower Silesian Voivodeship. Świdnica became part of the Wałbrzych agglomeration on 23 January 2014.

A city with almost a thousand years of history, recorded in 1070, Świdnica was one of the main cities of Silesia and southwestern Poland in the Middle Ages, the second most important center of culture and art in the region (after Wrocław), a famed brewing center, and in 1291–1392 the capital of an eponymous principality ruled by a local line of the Piast dynasty. The city has a preserved Old Town with several Gothic and Baroque churches, including the St. Stanislaus and St. Wenceslaus Cathedral and the Church of Peace, two landmark churches listed as Historic Monuments of Poland with the latter also listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

==History==
===Medieval period===

The city&#x27;s name was first recorded as &quot;Svidnica&quot; in 1070, when it was part of Piast-ruled Poland. Świdnica became a town in 1250, although no founding document has survived that would confirm this fact. The town belonged at the time to the Duchy of Wrocław, a province of Poland. By 1290, Świdnica had city walls and six gates, crafts and trade were blossoming. At the end of the 13th century, there were guilds of bakers, weavers, potters, shoemakers, furriers and tailors in Świdnica. The city was famous for its beer production. In the late 15th century, almost three hundred houses had the right to brew beer. In various cities of the region (Wrocław, Oleśnica, Brzeg) and Europe (Kraków, Toruń, Prague, Pisa) there were so-called &quot;Świdnica Cellars&quot; – restaurants serving beer from Świdnica. Wrocław&#x27;s &quot;Piwnica Świdnicka&quot; exists to this day as the oldest restaurant in Poland and one of the oldest in Europe. There was also a mint in Świdnica. The Franciscans and Dominicans settled in the city in 1287 and 1291, respectively.

In 1291–1392 Świdnica was the capital of the Piast-ruled Duchy of Świdnica and Jawor. The last Polish Piast duke was Bolko II of Świdnica, and after his death in 1368 the duchy was held by his wife until 1392; after her death it was incorporated into the Kingdom of Bohemia by Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia. By the end of the 14th century, Świdnica was already one of the largest cities in Silesia, with about 6,000 inhabitants.

In 1429 the city successfully defended itself against a Hussite attack. From about 1469 to 1490 it was under the rule of the Kingdom of Hungary and after that it was part of Jagiellonian-ruled Bohemia. In the 15th century, several mills operated in the city. Large cattle and hop markets took place there. In 1493, the town is recorded by Hartmann Schedel in his Nuremberg Chronicle as &quot;Schwednitz&quot;.

===Early modern period===
In 1526 the city came under the rule of the Habsburg monarchy as part of the surrounding Duchy of Schweidnitz (Świdnica). In the 16th century it was one of the regional centers of Anabaptism. The city suffered greatly during the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–48) as a result of sieges, fires and epidemics. Świdnica, under the Germanized name &quot;Schweidnitz&quot;, was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia during the First Silesian War (1740–42). The town was turned into a fortress, which it remained until 1866.

It was captured again by Austria in October 1761, during the Third Silesian War, or Seven Years&#x27; War, but Prussians retook it one year later. In 1803 the city was visited by Polish jurist, poet, political and military activist Józef Wybicki, best known as the author of the lyrics of the national anthem of Poland. In 1807 the city was captured by French troops during the Napoleonic Wars. It became part of the Prussian-led German Empire in 1871 during the unification of Germany and stayed within Germany until the end of World War II. According to the Prussian census of 1905, the city of Schweidnitz had a population of 30,540 who were mostly Germans, but also included a Polish minority comprising around 3% of the population. The World War I flying ace Lothar von Richthofen was buried in Schweidnitz, until the city became owned by Poland after World War II in which the graveyard was leveled. During World War I, the Germans operated a POW camp for Allied officers and a forced labour camp for regular POWs in the town.

===World War II and recent history===
A Nazi prison was located in the city under Nazi Germany, and during World War II, the Germans also established a subcamp of the Gross-Rosen concentration camp, three prisoner of war labor divisions of the Stalag VIII-A camp and a forced labour camp. Among the prisoners was Lesław Bartelski, Polish writer and resistance member, who fought in the Warsaw Uprising. In January 1945, a German-perpetrated death march of Allied POWs from the Stalag Luft 7 passed through the city.

After the defeat of Germany in 1945, the town, like most of Silesia, became again part of Poland under border changes agreed at the Potsdam Conference. Those members of the German population who had not already fled or had been killed during the war were subsequently expelled to the remainder of Germany in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement and the city was repopulated with Poles, many of whom had themselves been expelled from Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union. Also Greeks, refugees of the Greek Civil War, settled in Świdnica in the 1950s. From 1975 to 1998 it was administratively located in the former Wałbrzych Voivodeship.

In 2004, Świdnica became the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Świdnica.

==Points of interest==

The Gothic Cathedral of St. Stanislaus and St. Wenceslaus from the 14th century has the highest tower in Silesia, standing 103 meters tall; it hosts an image of &quot;Our Lady Health of the Sick&quot;. It is listed as a Historic Monument of Poland.

The Evangelical Church of Peace, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and Historic Monument of Poland, was built in 1656–57.
The 16th-century town hall has been renovated numerous times and combines Gothic, Renaissance, and Baroque architectural elements. A museum is located in the town hall. The Baroque Church of St. Joseph and the Church of St. Christopher are from the same era. One remaining element of the former defensive works is the Chapel of St. Barbara.

Other notable destinations include the old town and the Stary Rynek square, Gola Dzierżoniowska Castle, Medieval town of Niemcza, Cistercian monastery at Henryków, where the oldest preserved manuscript in Polish was written, and the Wojsławice Arboretum.

<text>Jawor () is a town in south-western Poland with 22,890 inhabitants (2019). It is situated in the Lower Silesian Voivodeship. It is the seat of Jawor County, and lies approximately west of the regional capital Wrocław.

One of the oldest towns in the region, with a history of more than a thousand years, Jawor was one of the main centers of weaving in Silesia and, in 1274–1392, the capital of an eponymous principality ruled by a local line of the Piast dynasty. It has a preserved medieval urban layout with several Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque structures, including the Church of Peace, a Historic Monument of Poland and UNESCO World Heritage Site. Jawor is the site for electrical machinery, chemical, paper and food industries, and there are numerous granite and basalt quarries near the town. Through the town flows the 31 mile long Raging Nysa river (pl: &quot;Nysa Szalona&quot;).

==Etymology==
The name of the city &quot;Jawor&quot; comes from the Polish word for &quot;sycamore maple.&quot; The earliest recorded name dates from 1133 when the city was written down as Jawr and in 1203 as Jawor. Until the 16th century the name was written down in Latin in various forms such as: Iavor, Iavr, Javr, Javor, Jaur, Jaura, Jawer, Jauor. The Polish form Jawor continued to be used, for example, in painting from 1562 located in church of St.Martin. The other form Iawor is recorded in a document from 1248, and in a document from 1277 the name Iaver is used. In 1295, in the Latin work &quot;Liber fundationis episcopatus Vratislaviensis&quot;, the city is written as Jawor. In the 1475 Latin &quot;Statuta Synodalia Episcoporum Wratislaviensium&quot;, which also contains the oldest Polish-language printing, it is seen as Jaworensis.

The German name Jauer is a Germanized version of the original Slavic name, and by 1750 the Polish name Jawor was still used in Polish by Prussian authorities. The German name became official after 1763 and the Austro-Prussian war.

==History==

Jawor was the main stronghold of the Trzebowianie tribe, one of the Polish tribes, and became part of the emerging Polish state in the 10th century. According to medieval chronicles the settlement was expanded in the 11th century. It was granted town rights between 1242 and 1275. As a result of the fragmentation of Poland, Jawor became part of the Duchy of Silesia, then the Duchy of Legnica from 1248, and from 1274 it was the capital of the Duchy of Jawor, the southwesternmost duchy of medieval Poland, before being integrated with the Duchy of Świdnica in 1346, part of which it remained until 1392, all the time remaining under the founding dynasty of the Piasts. By the end of the 13th century, stone defensive walls were erected. Between 1279 and 1334 the St. Martin church was built and in 1311 the St. Barbara church was renovated. Churches of St. Martin and St. Barbara are the oldest churches in Jawor. In 1324 the first hospital was founded. The first known image of the coat of arms of Jawor, preserved on the city seal comes from 1300. Jawor has grown into one of the most important centers of weaving in Lower Silesia. In 1329 Jawor was granted staple right by Duke Henry I of Jawor. In the 14th century, the first guilds were founded, bringing together furriers, tailors, clothiers and merchants.

After loss of the town by Poland, it was then ruled by Bohemia, Hungary, Bohemia again and Austria. The town suffered during the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648) as a result of repeated invasions, occupations, religious persecutions and epidemics. In 1626 it was plundered by the Austrians, in 1633 briefly occupied by Saxony and recaptured by Austria, in 1639 occupied by the Swedes and in 1640 recaptured by Austria, in 1642 occupied by the Swedes, then the Austrians and again the Swedes, finally captured in 1648 by the Austrians, who plundered and burned the town and expelled its inhabitants. After the war, in accordance with the Peace of Westphalia, the so-called Church of Peace was built, however, the Protestants were still being discriminated against by the Austrian administration.
In the 18th century, the town and region was the subject of Austrian-Prussian wars, eventually passing to Prussia in 1763. The Prussians turned the Piast Castle into a prison. In 1776 the town suffered a fire. On 14 May 1807, during the Napoleonic Wars and Polish national liberation struggles, Polish troops marched through the town, the day before they fought the victorious battle of Struga against the more numerous Prussians. In 1871 along with Prussia the town became part of Germany, and remained within until 1945.

During World War II the Germans imprisoned French and Norwegian women in the castle, participants of anti-German resistance movements. In the final stages of the war, in early 1945, most of the town&#x27;s population was evacuated by the Germans. It was captured by the Soviets in February and passed to Poland in April. After the war the region officially became part of Poland again as per the Potsdam Agreement. Also according to the agreement, the Germans who had not already fled, were expelled and Polish citizens, many of whom had been expelled from the Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union, became the majority.

From 1975 to 1998 it was administratively located in the Legnica Voivodeship.

On 9 May 2002, a ceremony to commemorate officers of the Special Operations Executive murdered by Nazi Germany at the Gross-Rosen concentration camp, was held in Jawor, with the participation of representatives of the Embassy of the United Kingdom in Warsaw, the Institute of National Remembrance and GROM.

<text>Dominic James &quot;Nick&quot; LaRocca (April 11, 1889 – February 22, 1961), was an American early jazz cornetist and trumpeter and the leader of the Original Dixieland Jass Band, who is credited by some as being &quot;the father of modern jazz&quot;. He is the composer of one of the most recorded jazz classics of all-time, &quot;Tiger Rag&quot;. He was part of what is generally regarded as the first recorded jazz band, a band which recorded and released the first jazz recording, &quot;Livery Stable Blues&quot; in 1917.

==Background==
Nick LaRocca was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, the son of poor Sicilian immigrants. His father was Girolamo LaRocca of Salaparuta, Sicily and his mother was Vita De Nina of Poggioreale, Sicily. Young Nick was attracted to the music of the brass bands in New Orleans and covertly taught himself to play cornet against the wishes of his father who hoped his son would go into a more prestigious profession. LaRocca at first worked as an electrician, playing music on the side.

From around 1910 through 1916 he was a regular member of Papa Jack Laine&#x27;s bands. While not considered as one of the most virtuosic or creative of the Laine players, he was well regarded for playing a solid lead with a strong lip which allowed him to play long parades without let up or to play several gigs in a row on the same day.

In 1916 he was chosen as a last-minute replacement for Frank Christian in Johnny Stein&#x27;s band to play a job up in Chicago, Illinois. This band became the famous Original Dixieland Jazz Band, making the first commercially issued jazz recordings in New York City in 1917. These recordings were hits and made the band into celebrities.

Soon other New Orleans musicians began following the O.D.J.B.&#x27;s path, arriving in New York to play jazz. LaRocca was uneasy about competition. Frank Christian recalled that LaRocca offered him $200 and a return railway ticket to go back home. After a band featuring New Orleans musicians Alcide Nunez, Tom Brown, and Ragbaby Stevens won a battle of the bands against the O.D.J.B., drummer Ragbaby found his drum heads mysteriously slashed.

The band gave LaRocca the nickname &quot;Joe Blade&quot;, and published a song called &quot;Joe Blade, Sharp as a Tack&quot;.

LaRocca led this band on tours of England and the United States into the early 1920s, when he suffered a nervous breakdown. He returned to New Orleans and retired from music, going into the construction and contracting business. His chair in the band was taken by Henry Levine, a teenage trumpeter devoted to traditional jazz stylings. Levine later led one of the house bands on NBC&#x27;s radio series &quot;The Chamber Music Society of Lower Basin Street&quot;.

In 1936 Nick LaRocca reunited the ODJB for a successful tour and more recordings. LaRocca proclaimed that he and his band were the inventors of the now nationally popular swing music. He and the reunited Original Dixieland Jazz Band performed &quot;Tiger Rag&quot; in &quot;The March of Time&quot; newsreel segment titled &quot;Birth of Swing,&quot; released to U.S. theaters February 19, 1937. Personality conflicts broke up the band again in 1937, and LaRocca again retired from music. He died in New Orleans in 1961.
==Later life and controversy==
In the 1950s, he wrote numerous vehement letters to newspapers, radio, and television shows, stating that he was the true and sole inventor of jazz music, damaging his credibility and provoking a backlash against him and his reputation and career.

When Tulane University established their Archive of New Orleans Jazz, now the Hogan Jazz Archive, in 1958, LaRocca donated his large collection of items related to the O.D.J.B. to Tulane, including several scrapbooks made by LaRocca.

At the same time, he worked with writer H.O. Brunn on the book &quot;The Story of the Original Dixieland Jazz Band&quot;. In the book, LaRocca claimed that he founded the Original Dixieland Jass Band in 1908. The book was dismissive of the other members of the O.D.J.B. It was perhaps kindest to clarinetist Larry Shields.

Musicologists and historians who seek to assess LaRocca&#x27;s contributions to jazz are hindered by LaRocca&#x27;s self-aggrandizement. A balanced assessment would have to acknowledge that LaRocca was an important figure in taking jazz from a regional style to international popularity, the leader of the most influential jazz band of the period from 1917 to 1921, and a good player in a very early jazz style on records such as &quot;Clarinet Marmalade&quot;. LaRocca&#x27;s playing and recordings were an important early influence on such later jazz trumpeters as Red Nichols, Bix Beiderbecke and Phil Napoleon. LaRocca&#x27;s 1917 composition &quot;Tiger Rag&quot; was covered by Louis Armstrong in several different versions throughout his career, while Duke Ellington, Art Tatum, and The Mills Brothers also recorded important and influential cover versions of the jazz standard.

==Honors==

In 2006, his 1917 recording of &quot;Darktown Strutters&#x27; Ball&quot; with the Original Dixieland Jass Band was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

<text>Aldford is a village and former civil parish, now in the parish of Aldford and Saighton, in the Cheshire West and Chester district, in the ceremonial county of Cheshire, England. (). The village is approximately to the south of Chester, on the east bank of the River Dee. The Aldford Brook joins the Dee just north of the village.

In the 2001 census, the population of the parish was 213.
The population of the civil parish was recorded as 272 in the 2011 census. 

==History==
The name Aldford means &quot;Old Ford&quot; and likely derives from Old English. 

Aldford Castle dates back over 800 years.

The village was a township in Broxton Hundred. A civil parish from 1866, it was abolished on 1 April 2015 to form Aldford and Saighton civil parish. The population was 331 in 1801, rising to 521 in 1851, then 113 in 1901 and decreasing to 96 by 1951.

Between 1960 and 1991, the village was the location of a Royal Observer Corps monitoring bunker, to be used in the event of a nuclear attack. No trace of the bunker remains today. 

==Landmarks==
Most of the building stock was constructed as a &quot;designed village&quot; in the middle of the 19th century by Sir Richard Grosvenor, 2nd Marquess of Westminster, in almost rectangular form. A number of buildings in the village were designed by the architect John Douglas. These include the Grade II listed St John&#x27;s church and the Grosvenor Arms public house.

The River Dee outside the village is crossed by the Aldford Iron Bridge, which was built in 1824 by William Hazledine for the 1st Marquis. Iron Bridge Lodge, adjacent to this bridge, was designed by Douglas &amp; Fordham in 1894 and is listed Grade II.

Aldford Hall and the Roman road Watling Street are outside the village.

<text>A spring-loaded camming device (also SLCD, cam or friend) is a piece of rock climbing or mountaineering protection equipment. It consists of two, three, or four cams mounted on a common axle or two adjacent axles, so that pulling on the axle forces the cams to spread further apart. It is then attached to a sling and carabiner at the end of the stem. The SLCD is used by pulling on the &quot;trigger&quot; (a small handle) so that the cams retract together, then inserting it into a crack or pocket in the rock and releasing the trigger to allow the cams to expand. A pull on the rope, such as that generated by a climber falling, will cause a properly placed SLCD to convert the pulling force along the stem of the unit into outwards pressure on the rock, producing massive amounts of friction and preventing the removal of the unit from the rock. Due to the large forces exerted on the rock when an SLCD is fallen on, it is very important that SLCDs are only placed in solid, strong rock.

==History==
Vitaly Abalakov&#x27;s invention of the Abalakov Cam was the first application to climbing of the principle of a cam to climbing equipment. His cams were sections cut out of a pulley wheel and bear a remarkable resemblance to today&#x27;s tricams. Since these shapes were eccentric, the intercept angle of the cam changed as the cam rotates and expands.

In 1973, Greg Lowe filed for a patent for a cam that had a &quot;constant intercept&quot; angle. Using a logarithmic spiral shape resulted in a uniform angle between the rock and each lobe of the cam; this constant angle is designed to always provide the necessary friction to hold a cam in equilibrium. Designed so that a load produces a rotational force, the logarithmic cam shape allowed for a single device to fit securely in a range of crack sizes.

Modern SLCDs were invented by Ray Jardine in 1978 (US patent 4,184,657) and sold under the brand name of &quot;Friends&quot;. Ray designed a spring-loaded opposing multiple cam unit with a more stable 13.75 degree camming angle and an innovative triggering mechanism. (The term &quot;friend&quot; is widely used by climbers to refer to SLCDs in general, but properly speaking it refers to the brand popularized by Mark Vallance and manufactured by Wild Country). Other popular brands include Black Diamond Camalots, Metolius Power Cams, DMM 4CUs, Trango FlexCams, and CCH Aliens.

==Modern use==

The invention of SLCDs revolutionized rock climbing because it meant that parallel and flaring cracks could be easily protected. Furthermore, unlike pitons, SLCDs can be removed easily without causing damage to the rock, which made clean climbing (climbing without damaging the rock) practical on many more climbs. Since the invention of the Technical Friend (that replaces the original one-piece machined alloy shaft with a brazed assembly incorporating a length of thick stainless-steel cable, which is better able to cope with loading over an edge), there has been a great deal of development of the SLCD by a variety of manufacturers. For example, the adoption of the dual axle design by Black Diamond, the invention of three-lobed camming units to fit smaller cracks, and the more recent invention of the Link Cam by Omega Pacific, a design that allows one SLCD to span an even larger range of crack sizes. SLCDs are sold in various sizes to fit a diverse range of cracks from about wide, though devices of below about or above about are not often seen. To fit non-parallel cracks, there are SLCDs with asymmetrical &quot;offset&quot; cams and devices that expand the lobes independently (Totem Cam).

Traditional climbers frequently climb with numerous and variously sized SLCDs to cover a wide range of crack sizes, often having multiples of the same size, depending on the protection requirements of the climb. Some popular climbing areas like Indian Creek, UT have extremely consistent feature sizes that require climbers to carry double-digit numbers of the same size SLCDs to properly protect a route.
