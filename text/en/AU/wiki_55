<text>Ilkley is a spa town and civil parish in the City of Bradford in West Yorkshire, in Northern England. Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, Ilkley civil parish includes the adjacent village of Ben Rhydding and is a ward within the City of Bradford. Approximately north of Bradford and north-west of Leeds, the town lies mainly on the south bank of the River Wharfe in Wharfedale, one of the Yorkshire Dales.

Ilkley&#x27;s spa town heritage and surrounding countryside make tourism an important local industry. The town centre is characterised by Victorian architecture, wide streets and floral displays. Ilkley Moor, to the south of the town, is the subject of a folk song, often described as the unofficial anthem of Yorkshire, &quot;On Ilkla Moor Baht &#x27;at&quot;. The song&#x27;s words are written in Yorkshire dialect, its title translated as &quot;On Ilkley Moor without a hat.&quot;

==History==
The earliest evidence of habitation in the Ilkley area is from flint arrowheads or microliths, dating to the Mesolithic period, from about 11,000 BC onwards. The area around Ilkley has been continuously settled since at least the Neolithic, around 3000 BC; more than 250 cup and ring marks, and a curved swastika carving possibly dating to the period have been found on rock outcrops, and archaeological remains of dwellings are found on Ilkley Moor. A small stone circle (possibly a burial monument), known as the ‘Twelve Apostles’, was constructed 4,500 years ago, during the Early Bronze Age. Serious interest in the rock art of Ilkley began after the publication of the &quot;Prehistoric Rock Sculptures of Ilkley&quot; in 1879 by Romilly Allen in the &quot;Journal of the British Archaeological Association&quot;.

The remains of a Roman fort occupy a site near the town centre. Some authorities believe it is Olicana, dating to 79 AD, but the identification is not settled. A number of Roman altars have been discovered from the reigns of Antoninus Pius (138 to 161), and Septimius Severus and his son Caracalla (211 to 217). Ilkley Manor House stands on part of the site in Castle Yard and is home to various Roman artefacts, including an original altar dedicated to Verbeia, the goddess of the River Wharfe.

Three Anglo-Saxon crosses from the 8th century that stood in the churchyard of All Saints&#x27; Church have been moved inside to prevent erosion. The church site, as a centre for Christian worship, extends to 627 AD, and the present mainly Victorian-era church incorporates medieval elements.

The &quot;Domesday Book&quot;, of 1086, records Ilkley (&quot;Ilecliue/Illecliue/Illiclei/Illicleia&quot;) as being in the possession of William de Percy 1st Baron Percy. The land was acquired by the Middelton family of Myddelton Lodge, from about a century after the time of William the Conqueror. The family lost possession through a series of land sales and mortgage repossessions over a period of about a hundred years from the early 19th century. The agents of William Middelton (1815–1885) were responsible for the design of the new town of Ilkley to replace the village which had stood there before.

In the 17th and 18th centuries the town gained a reputation for the efficacy of its water. In the 19th century it became established as a fashionable spa town, with the construction of Ben Rhydding Hydro, a hydropathic establishment at Wheatley, a mile to the east, between 1843 and 1844. Charles Darwin underwent hydropathic treatment at Wells House when his book &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; was published on 24 November 1859, whilst staying with his family at North View House (now Hillside Court). Tourists flocked to &#x27;take the waters&#x27; and bathe in the cold-water spring. Wheatley was renamed Ben Rhydding after the Hydro, which has been demolished.

Development based on the Hydro movement, and on the establishment of convalescent homes and hospitals, was accelerated in August 1865 by the construction of the Otley and Ilkley Joint Railway, which linked to the Leeds and Bradford Railway and the North Eastern Railway. The Midland Railway built a connection to Skipton via Bolton Abbey in May 1888.

Other Victorian visitors to the town included Madame Tussaud. The only remaining hydro building is the white cottage known as White Wells House. The cottage can be seen and visited on the edge of the moor overlooking the town.

==Governance==
;Ilkley Town Council
In May 2018, the parish council became a town council, with Cllr Stephen Butler serving as the first Town Mayor. The town consists of four wards and elects 14 councillors: Ilkley North (3 councillors), Ilkley South (3), Ilkley West (4) and Ben Rhydding (4). It meets in the 1908 Ilkley Town Hall on Station Road. The council precept is collected with the annual Council Tax to fund its running and to aid the development of local projects.

;UK Parliament constituency
Ilkley is in the Keighley UK Parliament constituency, held since 2019 by Robbie Moore, the Conservative MP. He defeated John Grogan, who had himself defeated the previous Conservative MP, Kris Hopkins, in 2017. Hopkins was first elected in 2010, replacing Ann Cryer. Cryer held the seat between 1997 and 2010, and her late husband Bob held the seat between 1974 and 1983.

;Previous governance
Before 1974 Ilkley was an urban district, a type of local government district. Ilkley Urban District Council shared local government responsibilities with the West Riding County Council. The Local Government Act 1972 dissolved urban districts and in 1974 Ilkley adopted its current status as a ward of the metropolitan borough of the City of Bradford. Services provided by the urban district council are now run centrally by the City of Bradford Metropolitan District Council.

Until 2006 Ilkley civil parish consisted of Ilkley ward, which includes Ben Rhydding, and the north half of Rombalds ward. The latter ward housed the villages of Burley-in-Wharfedale and Menston. The population of the parish in 2001 was therefore considerably higher than it is today, consisting of 24,954 residents. In 2006, Burley-in-Wharfedale and Menston established their own parishes and today Ilkley consists only of Ilkley ward (13,828 residents).

;Local Councillors for the City of Bradford Metropolitan District Council
The town is a ward in the metropolitan borough of the City of Bradford and is represented by two Conservative councillors, Andrew Loy and David Nunns, and Ros Brown, a councillor for the Green Party.

==Geography==
Nearby are the North Yorkshire hamlets of Middleton (), Denton () and Bolton Abbey (); the villages of Addingham (), Burley-in-Wharfedale () and Menston (); and the towns of Guiseley () and Skipton ().

The town is within the travel-to-work radius of Leeds and Bradford. Leeds is away and Bradford by road, with a railway connection offering about 35 trains to each destination per day from Ilkley railway station. The railway, before the Beeching axe, also connected to Addingham, Bolton Abbey and Skipton to the west, and to Otley, Pool-in-Wharfedale, meeting the main Leeds to Harrogate line at Arthington.

The town partially straddles the River Wharfe in a valley, rising from the river at to above sea level, up Ilkley Moor (a bracken and heather covered moorland, with rocky outcrops, to the south) and to across Middleton Woods in the north. The river runs through the northern extent of the town from west to east, and is crossed by four bridges, in order: a 16th century three-arched stone bridge, now closed to road traffic; a 19th century single-span wrought-iron bridge; a suspension bridge for foot traffic only (a set of concrete stepping stones) and a prefabricated steel arched box-girder bridge. The river is prone to flooding the sports fields (and a few houses) that occupy the watermeadows.

===Demography===
A person from Ilkley is called an Olicanian which is derived from Olicana, thought to be the name of the Roman fort Ilkley is built upon. The ethnic make-up of Ilkley&#x27;s population is 98.02% White, 0.74% mixed, 0.72% Asian, 0.37% Chinese or other ethnic group and 0.14% Black. The largest age group is 45- to 59-year-olds (20.73%).

==Economy==

The town is a tourist destination and is used as a base from which to explore the famous moor and the countryside beyond. Ilkley is a shopping town that sells everything from game, fine wine, expensive fashions and fine art. The Victorian parades of the Grove and Brook Street have a selection of speciality shops. The town&#x27;s original Victorian arcade has been restored as an indoor shopping walkway complete with a fountain and hanging baskets. Bettys, the Yorkshire tea room, has a shop in the town.
Ilkley has little by way of industry or commerce but employers include the &quot;Woolmark Company&quot;, &quot;Spooner Industries&quot; and &quot;NG Bailey&quot;. The town is also home to three breweries, Ilkley Brewery situated on the outskirts, Wharfedale Brewery which is housed within the grounds of a former 18th century farmhouse in the town centre and Bini Brew Co a modern craft brewery near the town centre.

According to the 2001 UK census, the industry of employment of residents aged 16–74 was 18.8% property and business services, 14.8% retail and wholesale, 13.4% education, 13.1% health and social work, 9.6% manufacturing, 5.7% finance, 4.8% construction, 4.8% public administration, 4.4% hotels and restaurants, 4.2% transport and communications, 0.6% energy and water supply, 0.5% agriculture, 0.1% mining, and 5.2% other.

The census recorded the economic activity of residents aged 16–74, 2.2% students were with jobs, 3.7% students without jobs, 5.8% looking after home or family, 2.7% permanently sick or disabled, and 1.8% economically inactive for other reasons. Ilkley&#x27;s 1.8% unemployment rate was low compared with the national rate of 3.3%. The City of Bradford has a relatively low proportion of people who were self-employed compared to the whole of England, but Ilkley&#x27;s rate of 11.9% was well above both the district and national figures.

==Transport==
Ilkley bus station is the focal point for services to Keighley, Leeds, Leeds Bradford Airport, Skipton, Grassington, Malham and Otley. The main operators are First Leeds, Keighley Bus Company and North Yorkshire County Council.

The civil parish is served by two railway stations: Ilkley and Ben Rhydding. These are linked by the Wharfedale Line, along which Northern Trains operates services between Ilkley, Bradford Forster Square and Leeds stations.

Leeds Bradford International Airport is located close to Ilkley.

==Sport==
There is a wide variety of sports clubs and facilities in and around Ilkley. Notable clubs include the Ilkley Lawn Tennis and Squash Club, founded in 1880 (member of the Lawn Tennis Association), which hosts an Ilkley Squash Open that has attracted world-class players such as Peter Barker; and Ilkley Trophy, a distinguished tennis tournament for men (an ATP event) as well as women (an ITF W100 event).
Furthermore, there are also the Ilkley Golf Club, Yorkshire&#x27;s third oldest golf club founded in 1890, and where Colin Montgomerie for some years practised the game; Ilkley Rugby Club; and Ilkley Harriers Athletics Club. There are a number of football, rugby and hockey teams. Ilkley Cricket Club play in the Aire-Wharfe League. The nearby Ben Rhydding Sports Club in Ben Rhydding is the home of Ben Rhydding Hockey Club, founded in 1901, and Ben Rhydding Cricket Club. An Ilkley Karate Club is run by former UK champion Mark Outterside.

Public facilities include indoor and outdoor swimming pools, and outdoor tennis courts at Ilkley&#x27;s Lido. Constructed in 1935, it is one of only four public open-air swimming pools in Yorkshire and is a tourist attraction during the summer holiday season.

Ilkley Town A.F.C. are a Charter Standard Community Football Club that provides football opportunities to over 650 members (male &amp; female) from under 5&#x27;s to SuperVets (over 45&#x27;s). In 2021, the Ilkley Town AFC was admitted into the North West Counties League Division One North.

===Cycling races===
The town has seen a number of high-profile international cycle races pass through. The steep climb up to the Cow and Calf rocks at the edge of Ilkley Moor is normally the reason for the races to visit as it presents a short but challenging climb. For three consecutive years between 1994 and 1996, the climb was used as part of the Leeds Classic, which was part of the World Cup series of events. In both 2005 and 2007, the town hosted stages of the Tour of Britain race, with Ilkley Moor being a categorised climb on each occasion.

In 2014, the town had its biggest cycling moment to date when the Tour de France passed through. The route approached the town on the A65 from Otley and passed through the town centre along the A65. As a direct consequence of the success of the Tour de France its organisers, ASO, established the Tour de Yorkshire. Ilkley features in Stage 3 of the inaugural Tour, with the race set to enter from the west along the A65, before turning to climb up past the Cow and Calf.

The annual Tour de Yorkshire which is a spin-off from the 2014 Tour de France includes Ilkley as part of the route. In 2018 the stage 2 finish line was at the Cow and Calf rocks, its first ever summit finish.

==Culture and attractions==

Ilkley town centre is a tourist attraction with a high number of small independent shops. Of particular note is Lishman&#x27;s of Ilkley, an award-winning butcher shop whose owner, David Lishman, became one of Rick Stein&#x27;s superheroes in 2003. Ilkley is one of five towns to feature a Bettys tearoom and is home to the Michelin-starred Box Tree restaurant where Marco Pierre White trained.

Ilkley&#x27;s rural surroundings attract walkers and cyclists to the area. The landmark Cow and Calf rocks, which overlook the town on Ilkley Moor, consist of a large outcrop, which allegedly imitates a cow, and a boulder, which imitates a calf. The site is also visited for its rock climbing routes. The Old Bridge just outside the town centre is the official start to the Dales Way, an walk through the dales to Bowness-on-Windermere in the Lake District.

In December 2020 it was announced that a stretch of the River Wharfe at Ilkley would become the first river bathing place to be added to the list of designated bathing places in England under the Bathing Water Regulations 2013, which hitherto included coastal sites and lakes. This followed a campaign by the Ilkley Clean River Campaign.

===Places of worship===

Ilkley&#x27;s medieval parish church All Saints&#x27;, largely reconstructed in the Victorian era, houses artefacts of the site&#x27;s ancient Christian heritage including three Saxon crosses and today operates within the Anglican Communion. An expanding congregation in the 19th century triggered plans in 1873 for a second church which became St Margaret&#x27;s Church, designed by Richard Norman Shaw and completed in 1879. Worship at the church is conducted in the Anglo-Catholic tradition and in 2005 was led by David Hope, Baron Hope of Thornes. When the Archbishop of York resigned he became vicar at Ilkley until his retirement in 2006.

Churches Together in Ilkley exists to encourage co-operation amongst member churches.

The former Wesleyan Chapel at the junction of Skipton Road and Bolton Bridge Road was built in 1834 but in 1892 it became Ilkley&#x27;s first museum. In 1914 it became a commercial garage and is now a cycle store.

<text>Jacqueline &quot;Jacqui&quot; Frazier-Lyde (born Jacqueline Frazier; December 2, 1961) is an American lawyer and former professional boxer. She is the daughter of former world Heavyweight boxing champion Joe Frazier. In January 2000, at the age of 38, Frazier announced that she would begin participating in the sport of boxing. Frazier-Lyde was inducted into the International Women&#x27;s Boxing Hall of Fame in 2024.

==Early life and education==
Frazier was born in Beaufort, South Carolina on December 2, 1961, the daughter of former heavyweight boxing champion Joe Frazier. She later relocated to Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, where she attended Plymouth-Whitemarsh, where she was a student athlete in softball, basketball, lacrosse, and hockey. Frazier received a scholarship to American University in Washington D.C., where she played basketball and majored in criminal justice. Frazier earned her Juris Doctor at Villanova University School of Law in Villanova, Pennsylvania.

==Career==
After graduating from Villanova School of Law, Frazier practiced law and later opened her own firm. In 2008, Frazier was elected as a municipal court judge in Philadelphia.

===Boxing===
Inspired by Laila Ali&#x27;s participation in the sport and eager to avenge the losses her father suffered at the hands of Ali&#x27;s father, Muhammad Ali in two of their three fights, Frazier-Lyde began her career on February 6, 2000, knocking out Teela Reese in first round.

Laila Ali was 9-0 (8 knockouts) and Jacqui Frazier-Lyde was 7-0 (7 knockouts) when they starred on the first Pay Per View boxing card ever to be headlined by women. At 39 years of age, Frazier-Lyde was 16 years older than Ali. The bout was nicknamed &quot;Ali-Frazier IV&quot; by the media in allusion to their fathers&#x27; trilogy of fights in 1971, 1974, and 1975. It was boxed on June 8, 2001 to headline the weekend activities of the International Boxing Hall Of Fame induction ceremonies. Ali won the fight by a majority decision (79–73, 77–75, 76–76).

On December 14, 2001, Frazier-Lyde won the WIBA Light Heavyweight Title with a fourth round TKO win over Suzette Taylor in Philadelphia, with Joe and Jacqui becoming the first father-daughter world champions in boxing. She added the WIBF Intercontinental Super Middleweight title on July 27, 2002, with a third round TKO win over Heidi Hartmann. Frazier-Lyde successfully defended her WIBF Intercontinental Super Middleweight title on two occasions, defeating Kendra Lenhart and Shirvelle Williams by unanimous decisions, the latter by an 80–72 shut-out on all three judges&#x27; scorecards. Lenhart and Williams, along with Frazier-Lyde, are the only three women to have taken Laila Ali (24–0, with 21 knockouts) the distance in boxing fights.

Frazier-Lyde&#x27;s last two fights were in the Heavyweight division, with her opponent on August 31, 2004, Carley Pesente, weighing in at 213lbs, thus being the heaviest opponent that Frazier-Lyde had faced during her boxing career. Frazier-Lyde won the fight by a shut-out unanimous decision (40–36, 40–36, 40–36). On September 10, 2004, Frazier-Lyde won the UBA World Heavyweight title by unanimous decision (97–92, 96–92, 95–93) against Mary Ann Almager, despite Frazier-Lyde being knocked down twice by Almager for the only times in her career. This fight was to be Frazier-Lyde&#x27;s last boxing fight.

Frazier-Lyde ended her career with a record of 13 wins, 9 by knockout, and 1 loss.

==Professional boxing record==
13 Wins (9 knockouts, 4 decisions), 1 Loss (0 knockouts, 1 decision), 0 Draws, 1 No Contest

<text>Septoria are ascomycete pycnidia-producing fungi that cause numerous leaf spot diseases on field crops, forages and many vegetables including tomatoes which are known to contract &quot;Septoria musiva&quot; from nearby cottonwood trees, and is responsible for yield losses. The genus is widespread, and estimated to contain 1072 species. Pycnidia produce needle-like pycnidiospores.

&quot;Septoria apiicola&quot; is the cause of late blight of celery. It is characterized by the production of conidia within pycnidia. The symptoms include chlorotic spots that turn brown and necrotic. &quot;Septoria apiicola&quot; can survive on seeds.

Several species of passion flower are infected by several species of &quot;Septoria&quot;, and a fungus, which has been going by the name &quot;Septoria passiflorae&quot; but which is probably an undescribed species, has been used to control the invasive &quot;Passiflora tarminiana&quot; in Hawai&#x27;i.

==Taxonomy==
In 2013, two large volumes (about 80 pages a piece) on &quot;Septoria&quot; and septoria-like fungi were published in the open access journal &quot;Studies in Mycology&quot;. In these papers by Quaedvlieg et al. and Verkley et al., the genus &quot;Septoria&quot; is clearly defined and identification techniques are discussed in detail. Besides going into detail about the genus &quot;Septoria s. str.&quot;, many septoria-like genera are discussed and clearly illustrated.

<doc id="152487" wikidata="Q83428" url="?curid=152487" title="Paracelsus">
<text>Paracelsus (; ; 1493 – 24 September 1541), born Theophrastus von Hohenheim (full name Philippus Aureolus Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim), was a Swiss physician, alchemist, lay theologian, and philosopher of the German Renaissance.

He was a pioneer in several aspects of the &quot;medical revolution&quot; of the Renaissance, emphasizing the value of observation in combination with received wisdom. He is credited as the &quot;father of toxicology&quot;. Paracelsus also had a substantial influence as a prophet or diviner, his &quot;Prognostications&quot; being studied by Rosicrucians in the 17th century. Paracelsianism is the early modern medical movement inspired by the study of his works.

==Biography==

Paracelsus was born in , a village close to the Etzel Pass in Einsiedeln, Schwyz. He was born in a house next to a bridge across the Sihl river. His father Wilhelm (d. 1534) was a chemist and physician, an illegitimate descendant of the Swabian noble Bombast von Hohenheim (1453–1499), commander of the Order of Saint John in Rohrdorf.

Paracelsus&#x27; mother was probably a native of the Einsiedeln region and a bondswoman of Einsiedeln Abbey, who before her marriage worked as superintendent in the abbey&#x27;s hospital. Paracelsus in his writings repeatedly made references to his rustic origins and occasionally used &quot;Eremita&quot; (from the name of Einsiedeln, meaning &quot;hermitage&quot;) as part of his name.

Paracelsus&#x27; mother probably died in 1502, after which Paracelsus&#x27;s father moved to Villach, Carinthia, where he worked as a physician, attending to the medical needs of the pilgrims and inhabitants of the cloister. Paracelsus was educated by his father in botany, medicine, mineralogy, mining, and natural philosophy. He received a profound humanistic and theological education from local clerics and the convent school of St. Paul&#x27;s Abbey in the Lavanttal. It is likely that Paracelsus received his early education mainly from his father. Some biographers have claimed that he received tutoring from four bishops and Johannes Trithemius, abbot of Sponheim. However, there is no record of Trithemius spending much time at Einsiedeln, nor of Paracelsus visiting Sponheim or Würzburg before Trithemius&#x27;s death in 1516. All things considered, Paracelsus almost certainly received instructions from their writings, and not from direct teaching in person. At the age of 16, he started studying medicine at the University of Basel, later moving to Vienna. He gained his medical doctorate from the University of Ferrara in 1515 or 1516.

===Early career===

&quot;Paracelsus sought a universal knowledge&quot; that was not found in books or faculties. Thus, between 1517 and 1524, he embarked on a series of extensive travels around Europe. His wanderings led him from Italy to France, Spain, Portugal, England, Germany, Scandinavia, Poland, Russia, Hungary, Croatia, Rhodes, Constantinople, and possibly even Egypt. During this period of travel, Paracelsus enlisted as an army surgeon and was involved in the wars waged by Venice, Holland, Denmark, and the Tatars. Then Paracelsus returned home from his travels in 1524.

In 1524, &quot;[a]fter visiting his father at Villach and finding no local opportunity to practice, he settled in Salzburg&quot; as a physician, and remained there until 1527. &quot;Since 1519/20 he had been working on his first medical writings, and he now completed &quot;Elf Traktat&quot; and &quot;Volumen medicinae Paramirum&quot;, which describe eleven common maladies and their treatment, and his early medical principles.&quot; While he was returning to Villach and while he worked on his first medical writings, &quot;he contemplated many fundamental issues such as the meaning of life and death, health, the causes of disease (internal imbalances or external forces), the place of humans in the world and in the universe, and the relationship between humans (including himself) and God.&quot;

===Basel (1526–1528)===

In 1526, he bought the rights of citizenship in Strasbourg to establish his own practice. But soon after, he was called to Basel to the sickbed of printer Johann Frobenius and reportedly cured him. During that time, the Dutch Renaissance humanist Erasmus of Rotterdam, also at the University of Basel, witnessed the medical skills of Paracelsus, and the two scholars initiated a dialogue, exchanging letters on medical and theological subjects.

In 1527, Paracelsus was a city physician () in Basel with the privilege of lecturing at the University of Basel. At that time, Basel was a centre of Renaissance humanism, and Paracelsus here came into contact with Erasmus of Rotterdam, Wolfgang Lachner, and Johannes Oekolampad. When Erasmus fell ill while staying in Basel, he wrote to Paracelsus: &quot;I cannot offer thee a reward equal to thy art and knowledge—I surely offer thee a grateful soul. Thou hast recalled from the shades Frobenius who is my other half: if thou restorest me also thou restorest each through the other.&quot;

Paracelsus&#x27; lectures at Basel university unusually were given in German, not Latin. He stated that he wanted his lectures to be available to everyone. He published harsh criticism of the Basel physicians and apothecaries, creating political turmoil to the point of his life being threatened. In a display of his contempt for conventional medicine, Paracelsus publicly burned editions of the works of Galen and Avicenna. On 23 June 1527, he burnt a copy of Avicenna&#x27;s &quot;Canon of Medicine&quot;, an enormous tome that was a pillar of academic study, in market square. He was prone to many outbursts of abusive language, abhorred untested theory, and ridiculed anybody who placed more importance on titles than practice: &#x27;if disease put us to the test, all our splendour, title, ring, and name will be as much help as a horse&#x27;s tail&#x27;. During his time as a professor at the University of Basel, he invited barber-surgeons, alchemists, apothecaries, and others lacking academic background to serve as examples of his belief that only those who practised an art knew it: &quot;The patients are your textbook, the sickbed is your study.&quot; Paracelsus was compared with Martin Luther because of his openly defiant acts against the existing authorities in medicine. But Paracelsus rejected that comparison, famously stating: &quot;I leave it to Luther to defend what he says and I will be responsible for what I say. That which you wish to Luther, you wish also to me: You wish us both in the fire.&quot; A companion during the Basel years expressed a quite unflattering opinion on Paracelsus: &quot;The two years I passed in his company he spent in drinking and gluttony, day and night. He could not be found sober an hour or two together, in particular after his departure from Basel.&quot; Threatened with an unwinnable lawsuit, he left Basel for Alsace in February 1528.

===Later career===

In Alsace, Paracelsus took up the life of an itinerant physician once again. After staying in Colmar with Lorenz Fries, and briefly in Esslingen, he moved to Nuremberg in 1529. His reputation went before him, and the medical professionals excluded him from practising.

The name &quot;Paracelsus&quot; is first attested in this year, used as a pseudonym for the publication of a &quot;Practica&quot; of political-astrological character in Nuremberg. Pagel (1982) supposes that the name was intended for use as the author of non-medical works, while his real name &quot;Theophrastus von Hohenheim&quot; was used for medical publications. The first use of &quot;Doctor Paracelsus&quot; in a medical publication was in 1536, as the author of the &quot;Grosse Wundartznei&quot;. The name is usually interpreted as either a Latinization of &quot;Hohenheim&quot; (based on &quot;celsus&quot; &quot;high, tall&quot;) or as the claim of &quot;surpassing Celsus&quot;. It has been argued that the name was not the invention of Paracelsus himself, who would have been opposed to the humanistic fashion of Latinized names, but was given to him by his circle of friends in Colmar in 1528. It is difficult to interpret but does appear to express the &quot;paradoxical&quot; character of the man, the prefix &quot;para&quot; suggestively being echoed in the titles of Paracelsus&#x27;s main philosophical works, &quot;Paragranum&quot; and &quot;Paramirum&quot; (as it were, &quot;beyond the grain&quot; and &quot;beyond wonder&quot;), a &quot;paramiric&quot; treatise having been announced by Paracelsus as early as 1520.

The great medical problem of this period was syphilis, possibly recently imported from the West Indies and running rampant as a pandemic completely untreated. Paracelsus vigorously attacked the treatment with guaiac wood as useless, a scam perpetrated by the Fugger of Augsburg as the main importers of the wood in two publications on the topic. When his further stay in Nuremberg had become impossible, he retired to Beratzhausen, hoping to return to Nuremberg and publish an extended treatise on the &quot;French sickness&quot;; but its publication was prohibited by a decree of the Leipzig faculty of medicine, represented by Heinrich Stromer, a close friend and associate of the Fugger family.

In Beratzhausen, Paracelsus prepared &quot;Paragranum&quot;, his main work on medical philosophy, completed 1530. Moving on to St. Gall, he then completed his &quot;Opus Paramirum&quot; in 1531, which he dedicated to Joachim Vadian. From St. Gall, he moved on to the land of Appenzell, where he was active as lay preacher and healer among the peasantry. In the same year, he visited the mines in Schwaz and Hall in Tyrol, working on his book on miners&#x27; diseases. He moved on to Innsbruck, where he was once again barred from practising. He passed Sterzing in 1534, moving on to Meran, Veltlin, and St. Moritz, which he praised for its healing springs. In Meran, he came in contact with the socioreligious programs of the Anabaptists. He visited Pfäfers Abbey, dedicating a separate pamphlet to its baths (1535). He passed Kempten, Memmingen, Ulm, and Augsburg in 1536. He finally managed to publish his &quot;Die grosse Wundartznei&quot; (&quot;The Great Surgery Book&quot;), printed in Ulm, Augsburg, and Frankfurt in this year.

His &quot;Astronomia magna&quot; (also known as &quot;Philosophia sagax&quot;) was completed in 1537 but not published until 1571. It is a treatise on hermeticism, astrology, divination, theology, and demonology that laid the basis of Paracelsus&#x27;s later fame as a &quot;prophet&quot;. His motto &quot;Alterius non sit qui suus esse potest&quot; (&quot;Let no man belong to another who can belong to himself&quot;) is inscribed on a 1538 portrait by Augustin Hirschvogel.

===Death and legacy===

In 1541, Paracelsus moved to Salzburg where he died on 24 September. He was buried in St. Sebastian&#x27;s cemetery in Salzburg. His remains were relocated inside St. Sebastian&#x27;s church in 1752.

After his death, the movement of Paracelsianism was seized upon by many wishing to subvert the traditional Galenic physics, and his therapies became more widely known and used. His manuscripts have been lost, but many of his works which remained unpublished during his lifetime were edited by Johannes Huser of Basel during 1589 to 1591. His works were frequently reprinted and widely read during the late 16th to early 17th centuries, and although his &quot;occult&quot; reputation remained controversial, his medical contributions were universally recognized: a 1618 &quot;pharmacopeia&quot; by the Royal College of Physicians in London included &quot;Paracelsian&quot; remedies.

The late 16th century saw substantial production of Pseudo-Paracelsian writing, especially letters attributed to Paracelsus, to the point where biographers find it impossible to draw a clear line between genuine tradition and legend.

==Philosophy==
As a physician of the early 16th century, Paracelsus held a natural affinity with the Hermetic, Neoplatonic, and Pythagorean philosophies central to the Renaissance, a world-view exemplified by Marsilio Ficino and Pico della Mirandola. Astrology was a very important part of Paracelsus&#x27;s medicine and he was a practising astrologer, as were many of the university-trained physicians working at that time in Europe. Paracelsus devoted several sections in his writings to the construction of astrological talismans for curing disease. 

Paracelsus&#x27;s approach to science was heavily influenced by his religious beliefs. He believed that science and religion were inseparable, and scientific discoveries were direct messages from God. Thus, he believed it was mankind&#x27;s divine duty to uncover and understand all of His message. Paracelsus also believed that the virtues that make up natural objects are not natural, but supernatural, and existed in God before the creation of the universe. Because of this, when the Earth and the Heavens eventually dissipate, the virtues of all natural objects will continue to exist and simply return to God. His philosophy about the true nature of the virtues is reminiscent of Aristotle&#x27;s idea of the natural place of elements. To Paracelsus, the purpose of science is not only to learn more about the world around us, but also to search for divine signs and potentially understand the nature of God. If a person who doesn&#x27;t believe in God became a physician, he would not have standing in God&#x27;s eyes and would not succeed in their work because he did not practice in his name. Becoming an effective physician requires faith in God. Paracelsus saw medicine as more than just a perfunctory practice. To him, medicine was a divine mission, and good character combined with devotion to God was more important than personal skill. He encouraged physicians to practice self-improvement and humility along with studying philosophy to gain new experiences.

== Chemistry and alchemy ==
=== Chemistry in medicine ===
Paracelsus was one of the first medical professors to recognize that physicians required a solid academic knowledge in the natural sciences, especially chemistry. Paracelsus pioneered the use of chemicals and minerals in medicine.

=== Zinc ===
He was probably the first to give the element &quot;zinc&quot; (&quot;zincum&quot;) its modern name, in about 1526, likely based on the sharp pointed appearance of its crystals after smelting (&quot;zinke&quot; translating to &quot;pointed&quot; in German). Paracelsus invented chemical therapy, chemical urinalysis, and suggested a biochemical theory of digestion. Paracelsus used chemistry and chemical analogies in his teachings to medical students and to the medical establishment, many of whom found them objectionable.

=== Hydrogen ===
Paracelsus in the beginning of the sixteenth century had unknowingly observed hydrogen as he noted that in reaction when acids attack metals, gas was a by-product. Later, Théodore de Mayerne repeated Paracelsus&#x27;s experiment in 1650 and found that the gas was flammable. However, neither Paracelsus nor de Mayerne proposed that hydrogen could be a new element.

=== Elements ===
==== Classical elements ====
Paracelsus largely rejected the philosophies of Aristotle and Galen, as well as the theory of humours. Although he did accept the concept of the four elements—water, air, fire, and earth; he saw them as a foundation for other properties on which to build. In a posthumously published book entitled, &quot;A Book on Nymphs, Sylphs, Pygmies, and Salamanders, and on the Other Spirits&quot;, Paracelsus also described four elemental beings, each corresponding to one of the four elements: Salamanders, which correspond to fire; Gnomes, corresponding to earth; Undines, corresponding to water; and Sylphs, corresponding to air.

==== Elements, heaven and Earth ====
Paracelsus often viewed fire as the Firmament that sat between air and water in the heavens. Paracelsus often uses an egg to help describe the elements. In his early model, he claimed that air surrounded the world like an egg shell. The egg white below the shell is like fire because it has a type of chaos to it that allows it to hold up earth and water. The earth and water make up a globe which, in his egg analogy, is the yolk. In &quot;De Meteoris&quot;, Paracelsus claims the firmament is the heavens.

==== &quot;Tria prima&quot;====

From his study of the elements, Paracelsus adopted the idea of tripartite alternatives to explain the nature of medicines, which he thought to be composed of the (&#x27;three primes&#x27; or principles): a combustible element (sulphur), a fluid and changeable element (mercury), and a solid, permanent element (salt). The first mention of the mercury-sulphur-salt model was in the &quot;Opus paramirum&quot; dating to about 1530. Paracelsus believed that the principles sulphur, mercury, and salt contained the poisons contributing to all diseases. He saw each disease as having three separate cures depending on how it was afflicted, either being caused by the poisoning of sulphur, mercury, or salt. Paracelsus drew the importance of sulphur, salt, and mercury from medieval alchemy, where they all occupied a prominent place. He demonstrated his theory by burning a piece of wood. The fire was the work of sulphur, the smoke was mercury, and the residual ash was salt. Paracelsus also believed that mercury, sulphur, and salt provided a good explanation for the nature of medicine because each of these properties existed in many physical forms. The &quot;tria prima&quot; also defined the human identity. Salt represented the body; mercury represented the spirit (imagination, moral judgment, and the higher mental faculties); sulphur represented the soul (the emotions and desires). By understanding the chemical nature of the &quot;tria prima&quot;, a physician could discover the means of curing disease. With every disease, the symptoms depended on which of the three principles caused the ailment. Paracelsus theorized that materials which are poisonous in large doses may be curative in small doses; he demonstrated this with the examples of magnetism and static electricity, wherein a small magnet can attract much larger pieces of metal.

===== &quot;Tria prima&quot; in &quot;The Sceptical Chymist&quot; =====
Even though Paracelsus accepted the four classical elements, in Robert Boyle&#x27;s &quot;The Sceptical Chymist,&quot; published in 1661 in the form of a dialogue between friends, &quot;Themistius,&quot; the Aristotelian of the party, speaks of the three principles as though they were meant to replace, rather than complement, the classical elements and compares Paracelsus&#x27; theory of the elements unfavourably with that of Aristotle:

Boyle—speaking through other characters—rejected both Paracelsus&#x27; three principles (sulfur, mercury, and salt), and the “Aristotelian” elements (earth, water, air, and fire), or any system with a pre-determined number of elements. In fact, Boyle&#x27;s arguments were mainly directed against Paracelsus’ theory as being the one more in line with experience, so that arguments against it should be at least as valid against the Aristotelian view.

== Contributions to medicine ==
=== Hermeticism ===
His hermetic beliefs were that sickness and health in the body relied upon the harmony of humans (microcosm) and nature (macrocosm). He took a different approach from those before him, using this analogy not in the manner of soul-purification but in the manner that humans must have certain balances of minerals in their bodies, and that certain illnesses of the body had chemical remedies that could cure them. As a result of this hermetical idea of harmony, the universe&#x27;s macrocosm was represented in every person as a microcosm. An example of this correspondence is the doctrine of signatures used to identify curative powers of plants. If a plant looked like a part of the body, then this signified its ability to cure this given anatomy. Therefore, the root of the orchid looks like a testicle and can therefore heal any testicle-associated illness. Paracelsus mobilized the microcosm-macrocosm theory to demonstrate the analogy between the aspirations to salvation and health. As humans must ward off the influence of evil spirits with morality, they must also ward off diseases with good health.

Paracelsus believed that true anatomy could only be understood once the nourishment for each part of the body was discovered. He believed that one must therefore know the influence of the stars on these particular body parts. Diseases were caused by poisons brought from the stars. However, &#x27;poisons&#x27; were not necessarily something negative, in part because related substances interacted, but also because only the dose determined if a substance was poisonous. Paracelsus claimed in contrast to Galen, that like cures like. If a star or poison caused a disease, then it must be countered by another star or poison. Because everything in the universe was interrelated, beneficial medical substances could be found in herbs, minerals, and various chemical combinations thereof. Paracelsus viewed the universe as one coherent organism that is pervaded by a uniting, life-giving spirit, and this in its entirety, humans included, was &#x27;God&#x27;. His beliefs put him at odds with the Catholic Church, for which there necessarily had to be a difference between the creator and the created. Therefore, some have considered him to be a Protestant.

=== Discoveries and treatments ===
Paracelsus is frequently credited with reintroducing opium to Western Europe during the German Renaissance. He extolled the benefits of opium, and of a pill he called laudanum, which has frequently been asserted by others to have been an opium tincture. Paracelsus did not leave a complete recipe, and the known ingredients differ considerably from 17th-century laudanum.

Paracelsus invented, or at least named a sort of liniment, opodeldoc, a mixture of soap in alcohol, to which camphor and sometimes a number of herbal essences, most notably wormwood, were added. Paracelsus&#x27;s recipe forms the basis for most later versions of liniment.

His work &quot;Die große Wundarzney&quot; is a forerunner of antisepsis. This specific empirical knowledge originated from his personal experiences as an army physician in the Venetian wars. Paracelsus demanded that the application of cow dung, feathers and other noxious concoctions to wounds be surrendered in favour of keeping the wounds clean, stating, &quot;If you prevent infection, Nature will heal the wound all by herself.&quot; During his time as a military surgeon, Paracelsus was exposed to the crudity of medical knowledge at the time, when doctors believed that infection was a natural part of the healing process. He advocated for cleanliness and protection of wounds, as well as the regulation of diet. Popular ideas of the time opposed these theories and suggested sewing or plastering wounds. Historians of syphilitic disease credit Paracelsus with the recognition of the inherited character of syphilis. In his first medical publication, a short pamphlet on syphilis treatment that was also the most comprehensive clinical description the period ever produced, he wrote a clinical description of syphilis in which he maintained that it could be treated by carefully measured doses of mercury. Similarly, he was the first to discover that the disease could only be contracted by contact.

Hippocrates put forward the theory that illness was caused by an imbalance of the four humours: blood, phlegm, black bile and yellow bile. These ideas were further developed by Galen into an extremely influential and highly persistent set of medical beliefs that were to last until the mid-1850s. Contrarily, Paracelsus believed in three humours: salt (representing stability), sulphur (representing combustibility), and mercury (representing liquidity); he defined disease as a separation of one humour from the other two. He believed that body organs functioned alchemically, that is, they separated pure from impure. The dominant medical treatments in Paracelsus&#x27;s time were specific diets to help in the &quot;cleansing of the putrefied juices&quot; combined with purging and bloodletting to restore the balance of the four humours. Paracelsus supplemented and challenged this view with his beliefs that illness was the result of the body being attacked by &quot;outside&quot; agents. He objected to excessive bloodletting, saying that the process disturbed the harmony of the system, and that blood could not be purified by lessening its quantity. Paracelsus believed that fasting helped enable the body to heal itself. &#x27;Fasting is the greatest remedy, the physician within.&#x27; 

Paracelsus gave birth to clinical diagnosis and the administration of highly specific medicines. This was uncommon for a period heavily exposed to cure-all remedies. The germ theory was anticipated by him as he proposed that diseases were entities in themselves, rather than states of being. Paracelsus prescribed black hellebore to alleviate certain forms of arteriosclerosis. Lastly, he recommended the use of iron for &quot;poor blood&quot; and is credited with the creation of the terms &quot;chemistry,&quot; &quot;gas,&quot; and &quot;alcohol&quot;.

During Paracelsus&#x27;s lifetime and after his death, he was often celebrated as a wonder healer and investigator of those folk medicines that were rejected by the fathers of medicine (e.g. Galen, Avicenna). It was believed that he had success with his own remedies curing the plague, according to those that revered him. Since effective medicines for serious infectious diseases weren&#x27;t invented before the 19th century, Paracelsus came up with many prescriptions and concoctions on his own. For infectious diseases with fever, it was common to prescribe diaphoretics and tonics that at least gave temporary relief. Also many of his remedies contained the famed &quot;theriac&quot;, a preparation derived from oriental medicine sometimes containing opium. The following prescription by Paracelsus was dedicated to the village of Sterzing:

One of his most overlooked achievements was the systematic study of minerals and the curative powers of alpine mineral springs. His countless wanderings also brought him deep into many areas of the Alps, where such therapies were already practised on a less common scale than today. Paracelsus&#x27;s major work &quot;On the Miners&#x27; Sickness and Other Diseases of Miners&quot; () presented his observation of diseases of miners and the effects of various minerals and metals in the human organism.

===Toxicology===
Paracelsus extended his interest in chemistry and biology to what is now considered toxicology. He clearly expounded the concept of dose response in his &quot;Third Defence&quot;, where he stated that &quot;Solely the dose determines that a thing is not a poison.&quot; (&quot;Sola dosis facit venenum&quot; &quot;Only the dose makes the poison&quot;) This was used to defend his use of inorganic substances in medicine as outsiders frequently criticized Paracelsus&#x27;s chemical agents as too toxic to be used as therapeutic agents. His belief that diseases locate in a specific organ was extended to inclusion of target organ toxicity; that is, there is a specific site in the body where a chemical will exert its greatest effect. Paracelsus also encouraged using experimental animals to study both beneficial and toxic chemical effects. Paracelsus was one of the first European scientists to introduce chemistry to medicine. He advocated the use of inorganic salts, minerals, and metals for medicinal purposes. He held the belief that organs in the body operated on the basis of separating pure substances from impure ones. Humans must eat to survive and they eat both pure and impure things. It is the function of organs to separate the impure from the pure. The pure substances will be absorbed by the body while the impure will exit the body as excrement. He did not support Hippocrate&#x27;s theory of the four humours. Instead of four humours, Paracelsus believed there were three: salt, sulphur, and mercury which represent stability, combustibility, and liquidity respectively. Separation of any one of these humours from the other two would result in disease. To cure a disease of a certain intensity, a substance of similar nature but the opposite intensity should be administered. These ideas constitute Paracelsus&#x27;s principles of similitude and contrariety, respectively.

===Psychosomatism===

In his work &quot;Von den Krankeiten&quot; Paracelsus writes: &quot;Thus, the cause of the disease chorea lasciva [Sydenham&#x27;s chorea, or St. Vitus&#x27; Dance] is a mere opinion and idea, assumed by imagination, affecting those who believe in such a thing. This opinion and idea are the origin of the disease both in children and adults. In children the case is also imagination, based not on thinking but on perceiving, because they have heard or seen something. The reason is this: their sight and hearing are so strong that unconsciously they have fantasies about what they have seen or heard.&quot; Paracelsus called for the humane treatment of the mentally ill as he saw them not to be possessed by evil spirits, but merely &#x27;brothers&#x27; ensnared in a treatable malady.&quot; Paracelsus is one of the first physicians to suggest that mental well-being and a moral conscience had a direct effect on physical health. He proposed that the state of a person&#x27;s psyche could cure and cause disease. Theoretically, a person could maintain good health through sheer will. He also stated that whether or not a person could succeed in their craft depended on their character. For example, if a physician had shrewd and immoral intentions then they would eventually fail in their career because evil could not lead to success. When it came to mental illness, Paracelsus stressed the importance of sleep and sedation as he believed sedation (with sulphur preparations) could catalyse healing and cure mental illness.

==Reception and legacy==
===Portraits===


The oldest surviving portrait of Paracelsus is a woodcut by Augustin Hirschvogel, published in 1538, still during Paracelsus&#x27;s lifetime. A still older painting by Quentin Matsys has been lost, but at least three 17th-century copies survive, one by an anonymous Flemish artist, kept in the Louvre, one by Peter Paul Rubens, kept in Brussels, and one by a student of Rubens, now kept in Uppsala. Another portrait by Hirschvogel, dated 1540, claims to show Paracelsus &quot;at the age of 47&quot; (&quot;sue aetatis 47&quot;), i.e. less than a year before his death. In this portrait, Paracelsus is shown as holding his sword, gripping the spherical pommel with the right hand. Above and below the image are the mottos &quot;Alterius non sit qui suus esse potest&quot; (&quot;Let no man belong to another who can belong to himself&quot;) and &quot;Omne donum perfectum a Deo, inperfectum a Diabolo&quot; (&quot;All perfect gifts are from God, [all] imperfect [ones] from the Devil&quot;); later portraits give a German rendition in two rhyming couplets (&quot;Eines andern Knecht soll Niemand sein / der für sich bleiben kann allein /all gute Gaben sint von Got / des Teufels aber sein Spot&quot;). Posthumous portraits of Paracelsus, made for publications of his books during the second half of the 16th century, often show him in the same pose, holding his sword by its pommel.

The so-called &quot;Rosicrucian portrait&quot;, published with &quot;Philosophiae magnae Paracelsi&quot; (Heirs of Arnold Birckmann, Cologne, 1567), is closely based on the 1540 portrait by Hirschvogel (but mirrored, so that now Paracelsus&#x27;s left hand rests on the sword pommel), adding a variety of additional elements: the pommel of the sword is inscribed by &quot;Azoth&quot;, and next to the figure of Paracelsus, the Bombast von Hohenheim arms are shown (with an additional border of eight crosses patty). Shown in the background are &quot;early Rosicrucian symbols&quot;, including the head of a child protruding from the ground (indicating rebirth). The portrait is possibly a work by Frans Hogenberg, acting under the directions of Theodor Birckmann (1531/33–1586).

===Paracelsianism and Rosicrucianism===
Paracelsus was especially venerated by German Rosicrucians, who regarded him as a prophet, and developed a field of systematic study of his writings, which is sometimes called &quot;Paracelsianism&quot;, or more rarely &quot;Paracelsism&quot;. Francis Bacon warned against Paracelsus and the Rosicrucians, judging that &quot;the ancient opinion that man was &quot;microcosmus&quot;&quot; had been &quot;fantastically strained by Paracelsus and the alchemists&quot;.

&quot;Paracelsism&quot; also produced the first complete edition of Paracelsus&#x27;s works. Johannes Huser of Basel (c. 1545–1604) gathered autographs and manuscript copies, and prepared an edition in ten volumes during 1589–1591.

The prophecies contained in Paracelsus&#x27;s works on astrology and divination began to be separately edited as &quot;Prognosticon Theophrasti Paracelsi&quot; in the early 17th century. His prediction of a &quot;great calamity just beginning&quot; indicating the End Times was later associated with the Thirty Years&#x27; War, and the identification of Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden as the &quot;Lion from the North&quot; is based in one of Paracelsus&#x27;s &quot;prognostications&quot; referencing Jeremiah 5:6.

Carl Gustav Jung studied Paracelsus. He wrote two essays on Paracelsus, one delivered in the house in which Paracelsus was born at Einsiedeln in June 1929, the other to commemorate the 400th anniversary of Paracelsus&#x27;s death in 1941 at Zurich.

===In popular culture===
A number of fictionalized depictions of Paracelsus have been published in modern literature. The first presentation of Paracelsus&#x27;s life in the form of a historical novel was published in 1830 by Dioclès Fabre d&#x27;Olivet (1811–1848, son of Antoine Fabre d&#x27;Olivet), Robert Browning wrote a long poem based on the life of Paracelsus, entitled &quot;Paracelsus&quot;, published 1835. Meinrad Lienert in 1915 published a tale (which he attributed to Gall Morel) about Paracelsus&#x27;s sword.

Arthur Schnitzler wrote a verse play &quot;Paracelsus&quot; in 1899. Erwin Guido Kolbenheyer wrote a novel trilogy (&quot;Paracelsus-Trilogie&quot;), published during 1917–26. Martha Sills-Fuchs (1896–1987) wrote three &quot;völkisch&quot; plays with Paracelsus as the main character during 1936–1939 in which Paracelsus is depicted as the prophetic healer of the German people.
The German drama film &quot;Paracelsus&quot; was made in 1943, directed by Georg Wilhelm Pabst. Also in 1943, Richard Billinger wrote a play &quot;Paracelsus&quot; for the Salzburg Festival.

Finnish writer Mika Waltari&#x27;s &quot;The Adventurer&quot; (1948) has a scene fictionalizing Paracelsus&#x27;s acquisition of his legendary sword. Paracelsus is the main character of Jorge Luis Borges&#x27;s short story &quot;La rosa de Paracelso&quot; (anthologized in &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s Memory&quot;, 1983). &quot;The Rose of Paracelsus: On Secrets and Sacraments&quot;, borrowing from Jorge Luis Borges, is also a novel by William Leonard Pickard.

==Works==

Because of the work of Karl Widemann, who copied over 30 years the work of Paracelsus, many unpublished works survived.

<doc id="152490" wikidata="Q1524840" url="?curid=152490" title="Western Scheldt">
<text>The Western Scheldt ( ), in the province of Zeeland in the southwestern Netherlands, is the estuary of the Scheldt river. This river once had several estuaries, but the others are now disconnected from the Scheldt, leaving the Westerschelde as its only direct route to the sea. The Western Scheldt is an important shipping route to the Port of Antwerp, Belgium. Unlike the Eastern Scheldt estuary, it could not be closed off from the sea by a dam as part of the Delta Works. Instead, the dykes around it have been heightened and reinforced.

Over the years, many ships have sunk in the Western Scheldt. Following an agreement between the Dutch and Belgian governments in 1995, many of the wrecks have been removed to improve shipping access to Antwerp. It was expected that the last 38 wrecks in the shipping channel would be removed during 2003. The largest wreck, which was removed in June 2003, was that of the long &quot;Alan-A-Dale&quot;, sunk in December 1944 during the Second World War by a German &quot;Biber&quot; midget submarine.

The Western Scheldt was freed from German occupation in October and November 1944 by the First Canadian Army during the Battle of the Scheldt.

Recently, the Western Scheldt has been exploring the concept of &quot;wisselpolders&quot; or &quot;exchange polders&quot;, a sedimentation enhancing strategy, to offset land loss, enhance flood safety and create new land. One example is the Perkpolder project.

==Western Scheldt Tunnel==

In mid-March 2003, a tunnel under the Western Scheldt opened, the Western Scheldt Tunnel, running from Ellewoutsdijk in the municipality of Borsele (Zuid-Beveland) to Terneuzen in Zeelandic Flanders. It is the longest road tunnel in the Netherlands. The toll (2012) is €5 for cars and €2.50 for motorcycles. Prior to 2011, the charge for motorcycles was the same as for cars, but it was reduced following protests. The single toll station for both directions is on the north bank. Pedestrians, cyclists, and moped riders are not allowed in the tunnel and must travel through it by bus.

==Ferry==
The double-decker car ferries that serviced the two Western Scheldt crossings until 2003 were sold to Italian companies. The Queen Beatrix (renamed &quot;Tremestieri&quot;) and Prince Johan Friso (renamed &quot;Acciarello&quot;) were adapted for the crossing between Messina and Villa San Giovanni on the Italian mainland.

With the opening of the road tunnel, the Breskens-Vlissingen ferry was restricted to pedestrians and cyclists. It is operated by Westerschelde Ferry BV, a subsidiary of the province of Zeeland. The service initially used former car ferries, but as of 2 May 2004 it employs two &quot;small waterplane area twinhulls&quot; (swaths, similar to catamarans), built at the Royal Schelde Group in Vlissingen (Flushing), and named &quot;Prins Willem Alexander&quot; and &quot;Prinses Máxima&quot;.

Upstream, the Kruiningen-Perkpolder ferry was discontinued without replacement.

<text>Vechta () is a district (&quot;Landkreis&quot;) in Lower Saxony, Germany. It is bounded by (from the north and clockwise) the districts of Oldenburg, Diepholz, Osnabrück and Cloppenburg.

==History==
In the 13th century the region was acquired by the bishop of Münster and became a part of his clerical state. When the clerical states of Germany were dissolved in 1803, Vechta was given to Oldenburg, while clerically still belonging to Münster, hence the name Oldenburger Münsterland is also used for the region (together with Cloppenburg district). The present district was established in 1945 and became a part of the newly founded state of Lower Saxony.

In terms of political history, both Vechta and neighbouring Cloppenburg are, as one of the few historically Catholic districts in an otherwise majority-protestant state, some of the most conservative areas in Germany. The federal constituency Cloppenburg – Vechta is frequently the Christian Democratic Union&#x27;s safest constituency, winning a majority in all but two elections since WWII.

==Geography==
The countryside is generally flat. Only in the very south there is a hill chain close to the town of Damme, called the Damme Hills (&quot;Dammer Berge&quot;). The western shore of Lake Dümmer with its adjoining fens is also part of the district.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms displays:
* the arms of Oldenburg
* the arms of the County of Calvelage-Ravensberg (which ruled over the region before the 13th century)
* the arms of the counts of Galen (who were vassals of the bishops of Münster)

<text>Portland International Airport is a joint civil–military airport and the largest airport in the U.S. state of Oregon, accounting for 90% of the state&#x27;s passenger air travel and more than 95% of its air cargo. It is within Portland&#x27;s city limits just south of the Columbia River in Multnomah County, by air and by highway northeast of downtown Portland. Portland International Airport is often referred to by its IATA airport code, PDX. The airport covers 3,000 acres (1,214 ha) of land.

Portland International Airport has direct flights to cities throughout the United States and in several other countries, including Canada, Mexico, Germany, United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Iceland. The airport is a hub for Alaska Airlines. It also has a maintenance facility for Alaska Air subsidiary Horizon Air. General aviation services are provided at PDX by Atlantic Aviation. The Oregon Air National Guard has a base on the southwest portion of the airport property grounds, and is also the host unit of the 142nd Fighter Wing (142 FW), which operates the F-15 Eagle. Local transportation includes the MAX Red Line light rail, which takes passengers between PDX and downtown Portland, as well as farther west to Beaverton. There is also Interstate 205, which connects to southwestern Washington (north from PDX) along with many suburbs of Portland (south from PDX).

==History==
Portland&#x27;s first airport was the Swan Island Municipal Airport, northwest of downtown Portland on the Willamette River. The Port of Portland purchased and construction began in 1926. Charles Lindbergh flew in and dedicated the new airfield in 1927.

By 1935 it was becoming apparent to the Port of Portland that the airport was becoming obsolete. The small airfield couldn&#x27;t easily be expanded, nor could it accommodate the larger aircraft and passenger loads expected to become common to Portland. Plans immediately were conceived to relocate the outdated airfield to a larger site. The Swan Island area is now used by the Port of Portland as an industrial park.

===Construction and early operations===
The Portland City Council purchased the present PDX site in 1936. It was bordered by the Columbia River in the north and the Columbia Slough in the south. The city council issued US$300,000 and asked the Port of Portland to sponsor a US$1.3 million Works Progress Administration (WPA) grant to develop the site into a &quot;super airport&quot;. The project provided badly needed Great Depression-era jobs. Construction of the airport steadily employed over 1,000 men, and was described by historian Neil Barker as &quot;Portland&#x27;s most significant public works improvement during the New Deal era&quot;. The WPA and Port of Portland faced difficulties in preparing the site for construction because the low-lying area was frequently covered by flood waters from the Columbia River. Workers covered the area with over of sand to help drain it of water, and constructed a series of dikes to control flooding. Two runways capable of serving the modern aircraft of the time were operational by 1941. The airport was designated &quot;Portland–Columbia Airport&quot; to distinguish it from then-operating Swan Island Airport. During World War II, the airfield was used by the United States Army Air Forces.

The &quot;super airport&quot; had a terminal on the north side, off Marine Drive, and five runways (NE-SW, NW-SE, and an E-W runway forming an asterisk). This configuration was adequate until a new terminal and a longer, east–west runway were constructed in 1952.

In 1948 the entire airport grounds were flooded during the Vanport Flood, forcing scheduled airline services to reroute to nearby Troutdale Airport. The grounds were under water for several months.

===New terminal (1950s)===
Portland&#x27;s first jets were Pan Am 707-321s about October 1959. A new terminal opened in 1959, which for the most part serves as the present facility. The new terminal is located to the east of the original runways, and north of the then-new runway. Construction of a second east–west runway to the north made this a midfield terminal. At this point, all but the NE-SW (3/21) runway in the original &quot;X&quot; were abandoned and turned into taxiways. 3/21 was extended for use as a cross-wind runway. &quot;International&quot; was added to the airport&#x27;s official designation after the 1950s-era improvements.

The first international nonstop was Western&#x27;s 720B to Vancouver, British Columbia, in 1967. Plans made in 1968 to add a third runway by means of filling in parts of the Columbia River were met with vocal public opposition and scrapped. The airport switched from screening passengers at individual gates to screening all visitors at concourse entrances in 1973 as new FAA regulations went into effect. By 1974, the airport was served by Braniff, Cascade, Continental, Eastern, Hughes Airwest, Northwest Orient, Pan Am, United and Western, and the Seattle route was served by seven airlines with aircraft as large as Boeing 747s. In 1974, the south runway was extended to to service the newest jumbo jets. The terminal building was renovated and expanded in 1977.

United was the dominant carrier at PDX during the regulated era and through the 1980s. Air Oregon started short-haul service from Portland following deregulation in 1978, and by 1979 had routes to seven other cities in Oregon. In April 1983, United Airlines began a flight from Chicago to Tokyo&#x27;s Narita Airport that stopped in Seattle–Tacoma six days a week and in Portland once a week. The company operated the service with Boeing 747s. Meanwhile, Delta Air Lines wanted to add Tokyo to its network, but it lacked aircraft that could fly there nonstop from its Atlanta base. Consequently, the company established a &quot;Pacific gateway&quot; in Portland, a small hub for routes to Asia. Delta began service from Portland to Tokyo in March 1987.

By the 1980s, the terminal building began an extensive renovation in order to update PDX to meet future needs. The ticketing and baggage claim areas were renovated and expanded, and a new Concourse D for Alaska Airlines was added in 1986. Concourse E was first to be reconstructed in 1992, and featured PDX&#x27;s first moving sidewalks. The Oregon Marketplace, a small shopping mall, was added in the former waiting areas behind the ticket counters. The early 1990s saw a food court and extension added to Concourse C, and the opening of the new Concourse D in 1994. This marked the first concessions inside secured areas, allowing passengers to purchase items without having to be re-screened. An expanded parking garage, new control tower, and canopy over the curbside were finished in the late 1990s. Although hailed by architectural critics, the canopy blocked views of Mount Hood from the curbside. On July 31, 1997, during construction, the garage addition collapsed due to inadequate bolts holding girders together and inadequate securing of structural members, killing three steelworkers.

Delta added domestic flights to Portland to feed the Asia routes. In 1995, the carrier offered nonstop service to Tokyo, Seoul, Nagoya, and Taipei, with the Taipei flight continuing on to Bangkok. It also flew to eight domestic cities, such as Atlanta, New York, and San Francisco. However, Delta faced obstacles to the success of its operation in Portland. These included the 1997 Asian financial crisis and complaints about the treatment of Asian passengers at the immigration facility in Portland, which led to the nickname &quot;Deportland.&quot; Moreover, airlines were introducing more flights from the United States to Asia, allowing travelers to bypass the Portland hub. Delta reduced the number of Asian destinations to two, Tokyo and Nagoya. It finally closed the hub in March 2001 due to financial losses. The move left the airport without transpacific air service.The present H-shape of the PDX terminal, designed by Zimmer Gunsul Frasca Partnership, was completed on September 10, 2001, when the new A, B and C concourses, as well as the light rail line, were finished. Probably the most stunning portion of PDX&#x27;s interior, the new concourses reflect a Northwest theme, focusing heavily on the nearby Columbia River. A huge celebration was to be held the following weekend, but the September 11 attacks interceded. The new concourses, designed to be public spaces, were closed to non-passengers.

Lufthansa started direct flights to Frankfurt in March 2003. The route was operated by Airbus A340s. In June 2004, Northwest Airlines introduced nonstop service to its hub at Tokyo-Narita aboard a McDonnell Douglas DC-10. In order to funnel passengers from other American cities onto the flight, Northwest made use of its partnerships with four other carriers instead of adding its own domestic routes to Portland. This strategy was less costly than Delta&#x27;s.

In August 2005, the concourse connector was opened. This is a long hallway on the secure side of the airport that connects the A, B and C concourses to the D and E concourses on the other side of the airport. If there is a long line at the checkpoint at one end of the airport, passengers may use the other checkpoint and walk through the connector to their desired concourse. The connector closed permanently on January 5, 2021, to make room for terminal expansion.

The airport&#x27;s carpet, installed in 1987, was designed to stylize the criss-crossing north and south runways. Beginning in 2014, a new design replaced the original pattern. In response, many residents created products to celebrate the carpet as a local icon.

In December 2016, the Port of Portland renovated the security checkpoints and immigration facilities as part of its PDXNext project. This included the relocation and widening of the exit lanes by the security checkpoints and upgraded security on both sides of the terminal.

===Terminal expansion (2020s)===
In the latter half of 2016, the Port of Portland and several airlines at PDX approved a project intended to balance the use of the terminal and concourses at Portland International Airport. The subsequent project extended Concourse E by and added 6 new gates to the facility. After the project, Southwest Airlines relocated its operations from Concourse C to the newly expanded Concourse E, alongside United Airlines. With the relocation of Southwest Airlines to Concourse E, Alaska Airlines, American Airlines and JetBlue Airways became the primary users of Concourses B and C. Construction on this project began in the spring of 2017 and opened to passengers on July 15, 2020.

Concourse A was demolished in November 2019 due to the age and space of the structure and was replaced by an expanded Concourse B. The extension featured 4 jet bridges, 6 ground loading zones, and improved concession stands. All Horizon operations that operated out of Concourse A was temporarily moved to Concourse C until the expanded Concourse B was completed. The new concourse opened on December 8, 2021.

In March 2020, the main terminal began a five-year expansion process to generate more open space in the pre-security area and an expansion of 150 feet toward the west. The concourse connector was closed in January 2021 and the Clocktower Plaza closed three months later to make room for the expansion. During construction, the remains of the concourse connector was reused for passengers to bypass the construction zone to get to concourses C and D. Construction of phase one of the new main terminal was expected to be complete by May 2024. One month before its scheduled opening, however, the opening date for the new terminal was delayed by three months due to construction incidents on site. Phase one of the new terminal opened to the public on August 14, 2024. As of September 2024, total construction is expected to wrap up in early 2026.

==Facilities==

The airport has one passenger terminal composed of four concourses, which are designated B, C, D, and E. There are 60 gates in total. The international section of Concourse D was renamed the Governor Victor G. Atiyeh International Concourse to honor the former Oregon governor, who was also known as &quot;Trader Vic&quot; for launching international tourism and trade initiatives during his gubernatorial term.

The Port of Portland requires all airport shops and restaurants to practice fair retail pricing—businesses are not allowed to charge more than at off-airport locations. Unique amenities include a microcinema run by the Hollywood Theatre; it shows free short films by Portland-based filmmakers that are primarily focused on the culture of the Pacific Northwest. The terminal also houses a distillery. In the pre-security area, there are several local food carts. In addition, the lower terminal roadway near the TriMet MAX Red Line station has a work station and assembly for repairing bicycles. The Oregon Welcome Center also has a &quot;Tool check-out&quot;.

Jet fuel is supplied via the Portland Jet Line, an Kinder Morgan fuel pipeline running from the Northwest Industrial area of Portland&#x27;s Willbridge Terminal to the airport. Willbridge contains 40 tanks, connected to the Olympic pipeline and Eugene pipeline, BNSF rail, truck, and ships.

==Ground transportation==

Public transit service to the airport is provided by TriMet, the metropolitan area&#x27;s primary transit agency, with its MAX Red Line light rail service. The 1986-opened MAX Light Rail system was extended to the airport in 2001. The Red Line originally provided service as far as downtown Portland only, but in 2003 it was extended west to Beaverton. The light rail station is located only about from the airport&#x27;s baggage claim area. Prior to 2001, TriMet service to the airport consisted of bus route 72-82nd Avenue from 1970 to 1986, and route 12-Sandy Blvd. from 1986 to 2001. Pacific Crest Lines also offers daily service to Union Station, Salem and Bend. 

C-Tran route 67 bus connects the airport to Fisher&#x27;s Landing Transit Center in east Vancouver, Washington.

By road, the terminal is accessible from exit 24 on Interstate 205.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On October 1, 1966, West Coast Airlines Flight 956 crashed in a desolate section of the Mount Hood National Forest during descent into Portland International Airport. Of the 18 passengers and crew, there were no survivors. The probable cause of the accident was &quot;the descent of the aircraft below its clearance limit and below that of surrounding obstructing terrain, but the Board was unable to determine the cause of such descent.&quot; The accident was the first loss of a Douglas DC-9.
*On December 28, 1978, United Airlines Flight 173 was en route to Portland International Airport from Stapleton International Airport in Denver, Colorado. On approach to Portland International Airport, the crew lowered the landing gear which caused a loud thump, abnormal vibration, unusual yaw, and the landing gear indicator lights failed to light. The plane circled Portland while the crew investigated the problem. After about an hour, the plane exhausted its fuel supply and crashed into the suburban neighborhood of East Burnside Street and NE 158th Ave. Of the 189 passengers and crew on board, ten died and 24 more were injured. An investigation revealed that the crash was caused by &quot;the failure of the captain to properly monitor the aircraft&#x27;s fuel state&quot;. This accident&#x27;s investigation led to substantially improved aviation safety by widespread adoption of crew resource management which emphasizes crew teamwork and communication instead of a command hierarchy.
*On January 20, 1983, Northwest Airlines Flight 608, a Boeing 727 with 41 passengers and crew enroute from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport to PDX was hijacked by a male hijacker. He informed a flight attendant that he had a bomb in a box and wanted to be flown to Afghanistan. The hijacker agreed to land at PDX to refuel and shortly after, negotiations began. When the hijacker was engaged, federal agents boarded the aircraft through a cockpit window. When the hijacker was confronted, he threw the box at the agents and one of the agents fired one shot and killed the hijacker. It was later discovered the box contained no explosives.
*On February 16, 2008, visibility of 1/8 mile was a possible factor in the fatal accident that took the life of the pilot, Oregon doctor Richard Otoski, a Klamath Falls dermatologist flying his Columbia 400. The accident took place just short of runway 10R at Portland International Airport. Otoski was the only person on board the aircraft, manufactured by the former Lancair Company. &quot;Damn it... we&#x27;re gonna crash&quot; were the last words PDX controllers heard from N621ER. The aircraft was apparently in the process of making another missed approach in poor visibility following the ILS when it clipped an airport perimeter fence, crashed, and soon caught fire. The aircraft had departed from Klamath Falls 90 minutes earlier.
*On January 5, 2024, Alaska Airlines Flight 1282, a 3 month-old Boeing 737 MAX 9 was en route to Ontario, California from Portland when a door plug (a structure installed to replace an optional emergency exit door located in the rear mid-cabin just behind the wings) tore off mid-flight. The flight experienced uncontrolled decompression and was forced to turn around and perform an emergency landing at PDX, resulting in three minor injuries. The incident caused Boeing to temporary ground nearly all 737 MAX 9&#x27;s to investigate the maintenance of the door plug.
*On March 18, 2024, an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737-800 arriving from Washington, D.C., suffered a cracked windshield while landing. The plane landed safely with no one among the 165 people on board being injured. The airline repaired the aircraft.

<text>In ancient Egyptian history, the Old Kingdom is the period spanning –2200 BC. It is also known as the &quot;Age of the Pyramids&quot; or the &quot;Age of the Pyramid Builders&quot;, as it encompasses the reigns of the great pyramid-builders of the Fourth Dynasty, such as King Sneferu, under whom the art of pyramid-building was perfected, and the kings Khufu, Khafre and Menkaure, who commissioned the construction of the pyramids at Giza. Egypt attained its first sustained peak of civilization during the Old Kingdom, the first of three so-called &quot;Kingdom&quot; periods (followed by the Middle Kingdom and New Kingdom), which mark the high points of civilization in the lower Nile Valley.

The concept of an &quot;Old Kingdom&quot; as one of three &quot;golden ages&quot; was coined in 1845 by the German Egyptologist Baron von Bunsen, and its definition evolved significantly throughout the 19th and the 20th centuries. Not only was the last king of the Early Dynastic Period related to the first two kings of the Old Kingdom, but the &quot;capital&quot;, the royal residence, remained at Ineb-Hedj, the Egyptian name for Memphis. The basic justification for separating the two periods is the revolutionary change in architecture accompanied by the effects on Egyptian society and the economy of large-scale building projects.

The Old Kingdom is most commonly regarded as the period from the Third Dynasty to the Sixth Dynasty (2686–2181 BC). Information from the Fourth to the Sixth Dynasties of Egypt is scarce, and historians regard the history of the era as literally &quot;written in stone&quot; and largely architectural in that it is through the monuments and their inscriptions that scholars have been able to construct a history. Egyptologists also include the Memphite Seventh and Eighth Dynasties in the Old Kingdom as a continuation of the administration, centralized at Memphis. While the Old Kingdom was a period of internal security and prosperity, it was followed by a period of disunity and relative cultural decline referred to by Egyptologists as the First Intermediate Period. During the Old Kingdom, the King of Egypt (not called the Pharaoh until the New Kingdom) became a living god who ruled absolutely and could demand the services and wealth of his subjects.

Under King Djoser, the first king of the Third Dynasty of the Old Kingdom, the royal capital of Egypt was moved to Memphis, where Djoser established his court. A new era of building was initiated at Saqqara under his reign. King Djoser&#x27;s architect, Imhotep, is credited with the development of building with stone and with the conception of the new architectural form, the step pyramid. The Old Kingdom is best known for a large number of pyramids constructed at this time as burial places for Egypt&#x27;s kings.

==History==

===Rise of the Old Kingdom===
The first King of the Old Kingdom was Djoser (sometime between 2691 and 2625 BC) of the Third Dynasty, who ordered the construction of a pyramid (the Step Pyramid) in Memphis&#x27; necropolis, Saqqara. An important person during the reign of Djoser was his vizier, Imhotep.

It was in this era that formerly independent ancient Egyptian states became known as nomes, under the rule of the king. The former rulers were forced to assume the role of governors or otherwise work in tax collection. Egyptians in this era believed the king to be the incarnation of Horus, linking the human and spiritual worlds. Egyptian views on the nature of time during this period held that the universe worked in cycles, and the Pharaoh on earth worked to ensure the stability of those cycles. They also perceived themselves as specially selected people.

===Height of the Old Kingdom===

The Old Kingdom and its royal power reached a zenith under the Fourth Dynasty (2613–2494 BC). King Sneferu, the first king of the Fourth Dynasty, held territory from ancient Libya in the west to the Sinai Peninsula in the east, to Nubia in the south. An Egyptian settlement was founded at Buhen in Nubia which endured for 200 years. After Djoser, Sneferu was the next great pyramid builder. He commissioned the building of three pyramids. The first is called the Meidum Pyramid, named for its location in Egypt. Sneferu abandoned it after the outside casing fell off of the pyramid. The Meidum pyramid was the first to have an above-ground burial chamber.

Using more stones than any other Pharaoh, he commissioned the three pyramids: a now collapsed pyramid in Meidum, the Bent Pyramid at Dahshur, and the Red Pyramid, at North Dahshur. However, the full development of the pyramid style of building was reached not at Saqqara, but during the building of the Great Pyramids at Giza.

Sneferu was succeeded by his son, Khufu (2589–2566 BC), who commissioned the Great Pyramid of Giza. After Khufu&#x27;s death, his sons Djedefre (2566–2558 BC) and Khafre (2558–2532 BC) may have quarrelled. The latter commissioned the second pyramid and (in traditional thinking) the Great Sphinx of Giza. Recent re-examination of evidence has led Egyptologist Vassil Dobrev to propose that the Sphinx was commissioned by Djedefre as a monument to his father Khufu.Alternatively, the Sphinx has been proposed to be the work of Khafre and Khufu himself.

There were military expeditions into Canaan and Nubia, with Egyptian influence reaching up the Nile into what is today Sudan. The later kings of the Fourth Dynasty were Menkaure (2532–2504 BC), who commissioned the smallest of the three great pyramids in Giza; Shepseskaf (2504–2498 BC); and, perhaps, Djedefptah (2498–2496 BC).

===Fifth Dynasty===

The Fifth Dynasty (2494–2345 BC) began with Userkaf (2494–2487 BC) and was marked by the growing importance of the cult of sun god Ra. Consequently, fewer efforts were devoted to the construction of pyramid complexes than during the Fourth Dynasty and more to the construction of sun temples in Abusir. Userkaf was succeeded by his son Sahure (2487–2475 BC), who commanded an expedition to Punt. Sahure was in turn succeeded by Neferirkare Kakai (2475–2455 BC), who was Sahure&#x27;s son. Neferirkare introduced the prenomen in the royal titulary. He was followed by two short-lived kings, his son Neferefre (2455–2453 BC) and Shepseskare, the latter of uncertain parentage. Shepseskare may have been deposed by Neferefre&#x27;s brother Nyuserre Ini (2445–2421 BC), a long-lived pharaoh who commissioned extensively in Abusir and restarted royal activity in Giza.

The last pharaohs of the dynasty were Menkauhor Kaiu (2421–2414 BC), Djedkare Isesi (2414–2375 BC), and Unas (2375–2345), the earliest ruler to have the Pyramid Texts inscribed in his pyramid.

Egypt&#x27;s expanding interests in trade goods such as ebony, incense such as myrrh and frankincense, gold, copper, and other useful metals inspired the ancient Egyptians to build suitable ships for navigation of the open sea. They traded with Lebanon for cedar and travelled the length of the Red Sea to the Kingdom of Punt- modern-day Eritrea—for ebony, ivory, and aromatic resins.
Shipbuilders of that era did not use pegs (treenails) or metal fasteners, but relied on the rope to keep their ships assembled. Planks and the superstructure were tightly tied and bound together.
This period also witnessed direct trade between Egypt and its Aegean neighbors and Anatolia.

The rulers of the dynasty sent expeditions to the stone quarries and gold mines of Nubia and the mines of Sinai. there are references and depictions of military campaigns in Nubia and Asia.

===Decline into the First Intermediate Period===
The sixth dynasty peaked during the reigns of Pepi I and Merenre I with flourishing trade, several mining and quarrying expeditions and major military campaigns.
Militarily, aggressive expansion into Nubia marked Pepi I&#x27;s reign. At least five military expeditions were sent into Canaan.

There is evidence that Merenre was not only active in Nubia like Pepi I but also sent officials to maintain Egyptian rule over Nubia from the northern border to the area south of the third cataract.

During the Sixth Dynasty (2345–2181 BC) the power of the pharaoh gradually weakened in favor of powerful nomarchs (regional governors). These no longer belonged to the royal family and their charge became hereditary, thus creating local dynasties largely independent from the central authority of the Pharaoh. However, Nile flood control was still the subject of very large works, including especially the canal to Lake Moeris around 2300 BC, which was likely also the source of water to the Giza pyramid complex centuries earlier.

Internal disorders set in during the incredibly long reign of Pepi II (2278–2184 BC) towards the end of the dynasty. His death, certainly well past that of his intended heirs, might have created succession struggles. The country slipped into civil wars mere decades after the close of Pepi II&#x27;s reign.

The final blow was the 22nd century BC drought in the region that resulted in a drastic drop in precipitation. For at least some years between 2200 and 2150 BC, this prevented the normal flooding of the Nile.

Whatever its cause, the collapse of the Old Kingdom was followed by decades of famine and strife. An important inscription on the tomb of Ankhtifi, a nomarch during the early First Intermediate Period, describes the pitiful state of the country when famine stalked the land.

==Art==
The most defining feature of ancient Egyptian art is its function, as that was the entire purpose of creation. Art was not made for enjoyment in the strictest sense, but rather served a role of some kind in Egyptian religion and ideology. This fact manifests itself in the artistic style, even as it evolved over the dynasties. The three primary principles of that style, frontality, composite composition, and hierarchy scale, illustrate this quite well. These characteristics, initiated in the Early Dynastic Period and solidified during the Old Kingdom, persisted with some adaptability throughout the entirety of ancient Egyptian history as the foundation of its art.
Frontality, the first principle, indicates that art was viewed directly from the front. One was meant to approach a piece as they would a living individual, for it was meant to be a place of manifestation. The act of interaction would bring forth the divine entity represented in the art. It was therefore imperative that whoever was represented be as identifiable as possible. The guidelines developed in the Old Kingdom and the later grid system developed in the Middle Kingdom ensured that art was axial, symmetrical, proportional, and most importantly reproducible and therefore recognizable. Composite composition, the second principle, also contributes to the goal of identification. Multiple perspectives were used in order to ensure that the onlooker could determine precisely what they saw.

Though Egyptian art almost always includes descriptive text, literacy rates were not high, so the art gave another method for communicating the same information. One of the best examples of composite composition is the human form. In most two-dimensional relief, the head, legs, and feet are seen in profile, while the torso faces directly front. Another common example is an aerial view of a building or location. The third principle, the hierarchy of scale, illustrates relative importance in society. The larger the figure, the more important the individual. The king is usually the largest, aside from deities. The similarity in size equated to similarity in position. However, this is not to say that physical differences were not shown as well. Women, for example, are usually shown as smaller than men. Children retain adult features and proportions but are substantially smaller in size.

Aside from the three primary conventions, there are several characteristics that can help date a piece to a particular time frame. Proportions of the human figure are one of the most distinctive, as they vary between kingdoms. Old Kingdom male figures have characteristically broad shoulders and a long torso, with obvious musculature. On the other hand, females are narrower in the shoulders and waist, with longer legs and a shorter torso. However, in the Sixth Dynasty, the male figures lose their muscularity and their shoulders narrow. The eyes also tend to get much larger.

In order to help maintain the consistency of these proportions, the Egyptians used a series of eight guidelines to divide the body. They occurred at the following locations: the top of the head, the hairline, the base of the neck, the underarms, the tip of the elbow or the bottom of the ribcage, the top of the thigh at the bottom of the buttocks, the knee, and the middle of the lower leg.

From the soles of the feet to the hairline was also divided into thirds, one-third between the soles and the knee, another third between the knee and the elbow, and the final third from the elbow to the hairline. The broad shoulders that appeared in the Fifth Dynasty constituted roughly that one-third length as well. These proportions not only help with the identification of representations and the reproduction of art but also tie into the Egyptian ideal of order, which tied into the solar aspect of their religion and the inundations of the Nile.
Though the above concepts apply to most, if not all, figures in Egyptian art, there are additional characteristics that applied to the representations of the king. Their appearance was not an exact rendering of the king&#x27;s visage, though kings are somewhat identifiable through looks alone. Identification could be supplied by inscriptions or context. A huge, more important part of a king&#x27;s portrayal was about the idea of the office of kingship, which were dependent on the time period. The Old Kingdom was considered a golden age for Egypt, a grandiose height to which all future kingdoms aspired.

As such, the king was portrayed as young and vital, with features that agreed with the standards of beauty of the time. The musculature seen in male figures was also applied to kings. A royal rite, the jubilee run which was established during the Old Kingdom, involved the king running around a group of markers that symbolized the geographic borders of Egypt. This was meant to be a demonstration of the king&#x27;s physical vigor, which determined his capacity to continue his reign. This idea of kingly youth and strength were pervasive in the Old Kingdom and thus shown in the art.

The sculpture was a major product of the Old Kingdom. The position of the figures in this period was mostly limited to sitting or standing, either with feet together or in the striding pose. Group statues of the king with either gods or family members, typically his wife and children, were also common.

It was not just the subject of sculpture that was important, but also the material: The use of hard stone, such as gneiss, graywacke, schist, and granite, was relatively common in the Old Kingdom. The color of the stone had a great deal of symbolism and was chosen deliberately. Four colors were distinguished in the ancient Egyptian language: black, green, red, and white. Black was associated with Egypt due to the color of the soil after the Nile flood, green with vegetation and rebirth, red with the sun and its regenerative cycle, and white with purity.

The statue of Menkaure with Hathor and Anput is an example of a typical Old Kingdom sculpture. The three figures display frontality and axiality, while fitting with the proportions of this time period. The graywacke came from the Eastern Desert in Egypt and is therefore associated with rebirth and the rising of the sun in the east.

<doc id="152501" wikidata="Q2519720" url="?curid=152501" title="Susning.nu">
<text>Susning.nu (in English literally meaning &quot;&quot;) was a Swedish language wiki website created by Lars Aronsson (also the founder of Project Runeberg) in 2001 and active until 2009. In its first three years, the website ran as an open wiki that anyone could edit. Susning did not have a pronounced ambition and could be compared in scope to Everything2; Aronsson&#x27;s stated original aim for Susning was &quot;to make it into whatever the users want it to be&quot;. As such, Susning was an encyclopedia, a dictionary, and a discussion forum about any concept of interest to its users. Because of this, Susning grew and became Sweden&#x27;s biggest and the world&#x27;s next biggest wiki.

At its peak in April 2004, Susning had over 60,000 articles on various topics, which was more than any other Swedish wiki at that time. During its first few years, it was in direct competition with the Swedish Wikipedia. However, because of the website&#x27;s popularity and open nature, Susning was highly affected by vandals, eventually leading to the complete shutdown of the project. In attempt at preventing vandalism, many efforts were made by Susning&#x27;s founder Lars Aronsson, which were mostly unsuccessful. Users who regularly edited at Susning were called &quot;susare&quot;.

== History ==
Susning.nu was started on August 31, 2001, by Lars Aronsson and functioned as part of his personal website. It changed to Susning.nu on September 29, and was released on October 1. During October that year, Susning.nu was indexed by the bigger web search engines, and the article collection firmly increased. In one year, Susning.nu grew with 10,000 articles, and more features were added. Among them were link statistics for all pages, and date searching which automatically generated dates and search links in several languages. The first edit war broke out on July 31, 2002.

Susning used a heavily modified version of UseModWiki as its wiki engine. Its domain name , which belongs to the island of Niue in Oceania but which is sold primarily to foreigners, was chosen as a domain hack, because &quot;nu&quot; means &quot;&quot; in Swedish (as well as Danish and Dutch). &quot;&quot;Skaffa dig en susning.nu&quot; was the slogan of Susning and translates to &quot;Get a clue.now&quot;&quot;. (The standard top level domain for Sweden is .)

=== Issues with vandalism ===
A significant difference from the Swedish Wikipedia was that Susning did not have any voluntary administrators who could assist in blocking other users; the only person who could do that on Susning was Lars Aronsson. As Susning grew, the issue with vandalism became bigger. In December 2003, Susning was affected by a vandal who had automatized their activity through a script. In just a few minutes, thousands of articles were deleted. Several users were forced to spend hours restoring them. The issues increased even further with vandals who added pornographic images and made the site inaccessible. The issues with vandalism were practically going on daily. To aid removal and discovery of vandalism, a &quot;karma system&quot; was added on February 22, 2004. The system derailed fairly soon, as the karma only could decrease. Because of this, even the most established &quot;susare&quot; were affected by bad karma. The karma system was shut down on March 25, 2004.

As a last attempt at preventing vandalism, the ability to see images was shut down entirely on April 5, 2004. However, a couple of days later it was possible to add images from certain chosen domain names. Due to a bug in the system, there were ways to evade this, which the vandals utilised. The bug was fixed on April 15, 2004, but a few minutes later that day, all editing on Susning.nu was shut down. Aronsson announced that the editing abilities would be shut down until a solution to the vandalism issues had been found, and that a password system would be imposed.

=== Demise and closure ===
After the imposing of the password lock, Susning became a significantly more inactive project, and a dozen users made almost all edits. In March 2004, before the password system was imposed, articles were saved approximately 36,000 times; by May, this had been reduced to 1,600 times. On May 11, 2004, editing on Susning.nu was temporarily opened for non-logged-in users, but after just 18 hours, vandalism had once again become such a big problem that non-logged-in editing was once again shut down. In March 2006, editing by non-logged-in users was opened on Sunday afternoons between 12:00–16:00. A year later, editing between 06:00–07:00 each day was enabled as well. Overall, this worked well but with a bit of vandalism.

In mid-2008, the website was affected by a persistent spammer who used proxy servers to spam different articles with English advertisement links. In April 2009, this forced Aronsson to remove the daily editing abilities between 06:00–07:00. The editing abilities during Sunday afternoons, however, continued to be open despite recurring spam attacks. By this time, very few users were still creating and editing articles on the website, which was shut down entirely in mid-August 2009; no reason for this was ever announced.

== Reception ==

=== Opinions ===
One opinion aired was that Susning&#x27;s status as a one-man project on the technical side was a big obstacle. Some argued that shared responsibility of the site would likely have meant a higher rate of innovation, greater predictability and better communication between technicians and &quot;susare&quot;. Lars Aronsson clarified that he saw Susning.nu as his own project and that he was not interested in letting others control it. After imposing editing on Sunday afternoons only, Aronsson himself used Susning mostly as a logbook where he saved links regarding, for example, Google and Wikipedia.

=== Advertisement ===
Unlike its main competitor, the Swedish Wikipedia, Susning.nu placed advertisements on some of its articles. It also had no license agreement, which meant that the contributions remained copyrighted by their submitters (the right to modify was said to be implicit in the site&#x27;s function). This in turn meant that third parties, such as Wikipedia editors, could not legally use Susning.nu materials contributed by others without permission. It also meant that Susning.nu depended solely on Lars Aronsson&#x27;s willingness to continue the project.

<doc id="152505" wikidata="Q4801328" url="?curid=152505" title="List of artworks on stamps of the United States">
<text>This article lists people whose artwork has been featured on stamps of the United States. For this purpose &quot;featured&quot; is not limited to complete works but includes any identifiable representation of their works. Thus the &quot;Geophysical Year&quot; stamp of 1958 is considered to feature the work of Michelangelo because it shows two hands from his &quot;The Creation of Adam&quot;. The &quot;issue year&quot; refers to the year when that person&#x27;s work listed appeared on a stamp of the United States. Many artists have had the same work appear on different U.S. postages stamps and many artists have had multiple works appear on U.S. postage stamps.

The list does not include artists who were commissioned by the U.S. Post Office Department (or its successor, the United States Postal Service) to specifically create artwork for a postage stamp. Scenes from American history, famous Americans, and traditional Christmas images are postage stamp themes frequently employing original artwork.

The main references for the list are: National Postal Museum online database &quot;Arago: Philately&quot;, the Colnect Worldwide Stamp Catalog, and the US Stamp Gallery.

<doc id="152506" wikidata="Q722599" url="?curid=152506" title="Rhapsody in Blue">
<text>Rhapsody in Blue is a 1924 musical composition for solo piano and jazz band by George Gershwin. Commissioned by bandleader Paul Whiteman, the work combines elements of classical music with jazz-influenced effects and premiered in a concert titled &quot;An Experiment in Modern Music&quot; on February 12, 1924, in Aeolian Hall, New York City. Whiteman&#x27;s band performed the rhapsody with Gershwin playing the piano. Whiteman&#x27;s arranger Ferde Grofé orchestrated the rhapsody several times, including the 1924 original scoring, the 1926 pit orchestra scoring, and the 1942 symphonic scoring.

The rhapsody is one of Gershwin&#x27;s most recognizable creations and a key composition that defined the Jazz Age. Gershwin&#x27;s piece inaugurated a new era in America&#x27;s musical history, established his reputation as an eminent composer and became one of the most popular of all concert works. In the &quot;American Heritage&quot; magazine, Frederic D. Schwarz posits that the famous opening clarinet glissando has become as instantly recognizable to concert audiences as the opening of Beethoven&#x27;s Fifth Symphony.

== History ==
=== Commission ===

Following the success of an experimental classical-jazz concert held with Canadian singer Éva Gauthier in New York City on November 1, 1923, bandleader Paul Whiteman decided to attempt a more ambitious feat. He asked composer George Gershwin to write a concerto-like piece for an all-jazz concert in honor of Lincoln&#x27;s Birthday to be given at Aeolian Hall. Whiteman became fixated upon performing such an extended composition by Gershwin after he collaborated with him in &quot;The Scandals of 1922&quot;. He had been especially impressed by Gershwin&#x27;s one-act &quot;jazz opera&quot; &quot;Blue Monday&quot;. Gershwin initially declined Whiteman&#x27;s request on the grounds that he would have insufficient time to compose the work and there would likely be a need to revise the score.

Soon after, on the evening of January 3, George Gershwin and lyricist Buddy DeSylva played a game of billiards at the Ambassador Billiard Parlor at Broadway and 52nd Street in Manhattan. George&#x27;s brother, Ira Gershwin, interrupted their billiard game to read aloud the January 4 edition of the &quot;New-York Tribune&quot;. An unsigned &quot;Tribune&quot; article entitled &quot;What Is American Music?&quot; about an upcoming Whiteman concert had caught Ira&#x27;s attention. The article falsely declared that George Gershwin had begun &quot;work on a jazz concerto&quot; for Whiteman&#x27;s concert.

The news announcement puzzled Gershwin as he had politely declined to compose any such work for Whiteman. In a telephone conversation with Whiteman the next morning, Whiteman informed Gershwin that Whiteman&#x27;s arch rival Vincent Lopez planned to steal the idea of his experimental concert and there was no time to lose. Whiteman thus finally persuaded Gershwin to compose the piece.

=== Composition ===
With only five weeks remaining until the premiere, Gershwin hurriedly set about composing the work. He later claimed that, while on a train journey to Boston, the thematic seeds for &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; began to germinate in his mind. He told biographer Isaac Goldberg in 1931:

Gershwin began composing on January 7 as dated on the original manuscript for two pianos. He tentatively entitled the piece as &quot;American Rhapsody&quot; during its composition. Ira Gershwin suggested the revised title of &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; after his visit to a gallery exhibition of James McNeill Whistler paintings, which had titles such as &quot;Nocturne in Black and Gold: The Falling Rocket&quot; and &quot;Arrangement in Grey and Black&quot;. After a few weeks, Gershwin finished his composition and passed the score, titled &quot;A Rhapsody in Blue&quot;, to Ferde Grofé, Whiteman&#x27;s arranger. Grofé finished orchestrating the piece on February 4—a mere eight days before the premiere.

=== Premiere ===

&quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; premiered during a snowy Tuesday afternoon on February 12, 1924, at Aeolian Hall, Manhattan. Entitled &quot;An Experiment in Modern Music&quot;, the much-anticipated concert held by Paul Whiteman and his Palais Royal Orchestra drew a packed house. The excited audience consisted of &quot;vaudevillians, concert managers come to have a look at the novelty, Tin Pan Alleyites, composers, symphony and opera stars, flappers, cake-eaters, all mixed up higgledy-piggledy.&quot; A number of influential figures of the era were present, including Carl Van Vechten, Marguerite d&#x27;Alvarez, Victor Herbert, Walter Damrosch, and Willie &quot;the Lion&quot; Smith.

In a pre-concert lecture, Whiteman&#x27;s manager Hugh C. Ernst proclaimed the purpose of the concert to be &quot;purely educational&quot;. Whiteman had selected the music to exemplify the &quot;melodies, harmony and rhythms which agitate the throbbing emotional resources of this young restless age.&quot; The concert&#x27;s lengthy program listed 26 separate musical movements, divided into 2 parts and 11 sections, bearing titles such as &quot;True Form Of Jazz&quot; and &quot;Contrast—Legitimate Scoring vs. Jazzing&quot;. The program&#x27;s schedule featured Gershwin&#x27;s rhapsody as merely the piece which preceded Elgar&#x27;s &quot;Pomp and Circumstance March No. 1&quot;.

Many of the early numbers in the program underwhelmed the audience, and the ventilation system in the concert hall malfunctioned. Some audience members had departed the venue by the time Gershwin made his inconspicuous entrance for the rhapsody. The audience purportedly were irritable, impatient, and restless until the haunting clarinet glissando played the opening notes of &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot;. The distinctive glissando had been created quite by happenstance during rehearsals: 

Whiteman&#x27;s orchestra performed the rhapsody with &quot;twenty-three musicians in the ensemble&quot; and George Gershwin on piano. In characteristic style, Gershwin chose to partially improvise his piano solo. The orchestra anxiously waited for Gershwin&#x27;s nod which signaled the end of his piano solo and the cue for the ensemble to resume playing. As Gershwin did not write the solo piano section until after the concert, it remains unknown exactly how the original rhapsody sounded at the premiere.

=== Audience reaction and success ===

Upon the conclusion of the rhapsody, the audience tumultuously applauded Gershwin&#x27;s composition, and, quite unexpectedly, &quot;the concert, in every respect but the financial, became a &#x27;knockout&#x27;.&quot; The concert soon became historically significant due to the premiere of the rhapsody, and its program would &quot;become not only a historic document, finding its way into foreign monographs on jazz, but a rarity as well.&quot;

Following the success of the rhapsody&#x27;s premiere, future performances followed. The first British performance of &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; took place at the Savoy Hotel in London on June 15, 1925. The BBC broadcast the performance in a live relay. Debroy Somers conducted the Savoy Orpheans with Gershwin himself at the piano. Audiences heard the piece again in the United Kingdom during the second European tour of the Paul Whiteman Orchestra, most notably on April 11, 1926, at the Royal Albert Hall, with Gershwin in the audience. His Master&#x27;s Voice recorded and released this performance.

By the end of 1927, Whiteman&#x27;s band had performed &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; approximately 84 times, and its recording sold a million copies. For the entire piece to fit onto two sides of a 12-inch record, the rhapsody had to be played at a faster speed than usual in a concert, which gave the recording a hurried feel with noticeably lost rubato. Whiteman later adopted the piece as his band&#x27;s theme song and opened his radio programs with the slogan &quot;Everything new but the &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot;.&quot;

=== Critical response ===

In contrast to the warm reception by concert audiences, music critics gave the rhapsody mixed reviews. Samuel Chotzinoff, music critic of the &quot;New York World&quot;, conceded that Gershwin&#x27;s composition had &quot;made an honest woman out of jazz&quot;, while Henrietta Strauss of &quot;The Nation&quot; opined that Gershwin had &quot;added a new chapter to our musical history.&quot; Olin Downes, reviewing the concert in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, favorably noted the rhapsody as a &quot;highly original form&quot;, and the composer as a &quot;new talent finding its voice.&quot;

Nonetheless, other reviewers were less positive. Pitts Sanborn declared that the rhapsody &quot;begins with a promising theme well stated&quot; yet &quot;soon runs off into empty passage-work and meaningless repetition.&quot; A number of reviews were particularly negative. Lawrence Gilman—a Richard Wagner enthusiast who would later write a devastating review of Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;—harshly criticized the rhapsody as &quot;derivative&quot;, &quot;stale&quot;, and &quot;inexpressive&quot; in a &quot;New-York Tribune&quot; review on February 13, 1924.

Overall, professional music critics recurrently criticized Gershwin&#x27;s piece as essentially formless and asserted that the composer had haphazardly glued melodic segments together.

==== Retrospective reviews ====
Years after its premiere, &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; continued to divide music critics principally due to its perceived melodic incoherence. Constant Lambert, a British composer whose oeuvre often incorporated jazz elements, openly dismissed the work:

In an article in &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot; in 1955, Leonard Bernstein, who nevertheless admitted that he adored the piece, stated:

== Orchestration ==

As Gershwin did not have sufficient knowledge of orchestration in 1924, Whiteman&#x27;s pianist and chief arranger Ferde Grofé played a key role in the rhapsody&#x27;s meteoric success, and scholars have contended that Grofé&#x27;s arrangements of the &quot;Rhapsody&quot; secured its place in American culture. Gershwin&#x27;s biographer, Isaac Goldberg, noted in 1931 that Grofé played a crucial role in the premiere&#x27;s triumph:

Grofé hastily arranged the famous 1924 score to take full advantage of the Whiteman orchestra&#x27;s particular strengths. He developed this orchestration for solo piano and Whiteman&#x27;s twenty-three musicians. For the reeds section, Ross Gorman (Reed I) played an oboe, a heckelphone, a clarinet in B, sopranino saxophones in E &amp; B, an alto saxophone, one E soprano clarinet, and alto and bass clarinets; Donald Clark (Reed II) played a soprano saxophone in B, alto and baritone saxophones, and Hale Byers (Reed III) played soprano saxophone in B, tenor saxophone, baritone saxophone, and a flute.

For the brass section, two trumpets in B were played by Henry Busse and Frank Siegrist; two French horns in F were played by Arturo Cerino and Al Corral; two trombones were played by Roy Maxon and James Casseday, and a tuba and a double bass played by Guss Helleburg and Alus Armer respectively. The percussion section included a drum set, timpani, and a glockenspiel played by George Marsh; one piano typically played by either Ferde Grofé or Henry Lange; one tenor banjo played by Michael Pingatore, and a complement of violins.

Musicologists largely ignored this original arrangement—with its unique instrumental requirements—until its revival in reconstructions beginning in the mid-1980s, owing to the popularity and serviceability of the later scorings. After the 1924 premiere, Grofé revised the score and made new orchestrations in 1926 and 1942, each time for larger orchestras. He published his arrangement for a theater orchestra in 1926. Grofé orchestrated this adaptation for a more standard &quot;pit orchestra&quot;, which included one flute, one oboe, two clarinets, one bassoon, three saxophones; two French horns, two trumpets, and two trombones; as well as the same percussion and strings complement as the later 1942 version.

Grofé later produced a 1942 arrangement for a full symphony orchestra. It is scored for solo piano and an orchestra consisting of two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets in B and A, one bass clarinet, two bassoons, two alto saxophones in E, one tenor saxophone in B; three French horns in F, three trumpets in B, three trombones, one tuba; a percussion section that includes timpani, one suspended cymbal, one snare drum, one bass drum, one tam-tam, one triangle, one glockenspiel, and cymbals; one tenor banjo; and strings. Since the mid-20th century, the 1942 arrangement became a staple of the concert repertoire until 1976 when Michael Tilson Thomas recorded the original jazz band version for the first time, employing Gershwin&#x27;s actual 1925 piano roll with a full jazz orchestra.

Grofé&#x27;s other arrangements of Gershwin&#x27;s piece include those done for Whiteman&#x27;s 1930 film, &quot;King of Jazz&quot;, and the concert band setting (playable without piano) completed by 1938 and published 1942. The prominence of the saxophones in the later orchestrations is somewhat reduced, and the banjo part can be dispensed with, as its mainly rhythmic contribution is provided by the inner strings.

Gershwin himself made versions of the piece for solo piano as well as two pianos. The solo version is notable for omitting several sections of the piece. Gershwin&#x27;s intent to eventually do an orchestration of his own is documented in 1936–37 correspondence from the publisher Harms.

== Notable recordings ==
After the warm reception of &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; by the audience at Aeolian Hall, Gershwin recorded several abridged versions of his composition in different formats. On June 10, 1924, Gershwin and Whiteman&#x27;s orchestra created an acoustic recording running 8 minutes and 59 seconds and issued by the Victor Talking Machine Company. A year later, Gershwin recorded his performance on a 1925 piano roll for a two-piano version. Later, on April 21, 1927, he made an electrical recording with Whiteman&#x27;s orchestra running 9 minutes and 1 second and again recorded by Victor. Nathaniel Shilkret purportedly conducted the electrical recording after a dispute between Gershwin and Whiteman. Whiteman&#x27;s orchestra later performed a truncated version of the piece in the 1930 film &quot;The King of Jazz&quot; with Roy Bargy on piano. 

Due to the length limitations of early recording formats, the first complete and unabridged recording of Gershwin&#x27;s composition did not occur until the Great Depression. In July 1935, after several years of performing the rhapsody for sold-out audiences in Massachusetts, conductor Arthur Fiedler and the Boston Pops Orchestra recorded the first unabridged version—nearly fourteen minutes in length—with Puerto Rican pianist Jesús María Sanromá for RCA Victor. For this first unabridged recording, Fiedler discarded Ferde Grofé&#x27;s original 1924 arrangement and adapted the piece for a conventional symphony. At the time, contemporary critics praised Fiedler for jettisoning the so-called &quot;jazzy sentimentality&quot; of Grofé&#x27;s earlier arrangement and adding a &quot;more symphonic richness and authority.&quot;

During the final months of World War II, amid the box-office success of the Gershwin biographical film &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; (1945), pianist Oscar Levant recorded the now iconic composition with Eugene Ormandy&#x27;s Philadelphia Orchestra on August 21, 1945. Levant had been an intimate friend of the deceased composer, and he sought to replicate Gershwin&#x27;s idiomatic playing style in his performance. Levant&#x27;s homage—labelled Columbia Masterworks 251—received rapturous reviews and became one of the best-selling record albums of the year. As a result of Levant&#x27;s recording and the 1945 biographical film about Gershwin&#x27;s life, a &quot;Gershwin revival&quot; ensued.
By the 1960s and 1970s, Gershwin&#x27;s rhapsody had become a predictable staple of both concert performances and orchestra recordings; consequently, more diverse and irreverent interpretations appeared over time. In Summer 1973, Brazilian jazz-rock artist Eumir Deodato reinterpreted Gershwin&#x27;s rhapsody in an abridged version that featured uptempo neo‐samba rhythms. Although music critics derided Deodato&#x27;s interpretation as &quot;mangled&quot; and barely recognizable, his single reached No. 41 on the &quot;Hot 100&quot; and No. 10 on &quot;Easy Listening&quot; on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, and No. 48 and No. 13 respectively in Canada. In the wake of Deodato&#x27;s earlier reinterpretation, French pianist Richard Clayderman recorded a similarly abridged disco arrangement in 1978 which became one of his signature pieces.

Concurrent with the emergence of these more diverse interpretations, scholarly interest revived in the original 1924 arrangement by Ferde Grofé which had not been performed since the end of the Jazz Age. On February 14, 1973, conductor Kenneth Kiesler and pianist Paul Verrette performed Grofé&#x27;s original arrangement on the University of New Hampshire campus. Soon after, conductor Michael Tilson Thomas and the Columbia Jazz Band recorded Grofé&#x27;s arrangement in 1976, as did conductor Maurice Peress with pianist Ivan Davis in 1984 as part of a 60th-anniversary reconstruction of the entire 1924 concert.

One hundred years after the debut of Gershwin&#x27;s rhapsody in 1924, tens of thousands of orchestras as well as solo pianists have recorded the piece, both abridged and unabridged. A number of these recordings have garnered critical recognition such as pianist Michel Camilo&#x27;s 2006 rendition which won a Latin Grammy Award.

== Form and analysis ==

As a jazz concerto, &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; is written for solo piano with orchestra. A rhapsody differs from a concerto in that it features one extended movement instead of separate movements. Rhapsodies often incorporate passages of an improvisational nature—although written out in a score—and are irregular in form, with heightened contrasts and emotional exuberance. The music ranges from intensely rhythmic piano solos to slow, broad, and richly orchestrated sections. Consequently, the &quot;Rhapsody&quot; &quot;may be looked upon as a fantasia, with no strict fidelity to form.&quot;

The opening of &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; is written as a clarinet trill followed by a legato, 17 notes in a diatonic scale. During a rehearsal, Whiteman&#x27;s virtuoso clarinetist, Ross Gorman, rendered the upper portion of the scale as a captivating and trombone-like glissando. Gershwin heard it and insisted that it be repeated in the performance. The effect is produced using the tongue and throat muscles to change the resonance of the oral cavity, thus controlling the continuously rising pitch. Many clarinet players gradually open the left-hand tone holes on their instrument during the passage from the last concert F to the top concert B as well. This effect has now become standard performance practice for the work.

&quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; features both rhythmic invention and melodic inspiration, and demonstrates Gershwin&#x27;s ability to write a piece with large-scale harmonic and melodic structure. The piece is characterized by strong motivic inter-relatedness. Much of the motivic material is introduced in the first 14 measures. Musicologist David Schiff has identified five major themes plus a sixth &quot;tag&quot;. Two themes appear in the first 14 measures, and the tag shows up in measure 19. Two of the remaining three themes are rhythmically related to the first theme in measure 2, which is sometimes called the &quot;Glissando theme&quot;—after the opening glissando in the clarinet solo—or the &quot;Ritornello theme&quot;. The remaining theme is the &quot;Train theme&quot;, which is the first to appear at rehearsal 9 after the opening material. All of these themes rely on the blues scale, which includes lowered sevenths and a mixture of major and minor thirds. Each theme appears both in orchestrated form and as a piano solo. There are considerable differences in the style of presentation of each theme.

The harmonic structure of the rhapsody is more difficult to analyze. The piece begins and ends in B major, but it modulates towards the sub-dominant direction and abruptly returns to B major at the end. The opening modulates &quot;downward&quot; through the keys B, E, A, D, G, B, E, and finally to A major. Modulation through the circle of fifths in the reverse direction inverts classical tonal relationships, but does not abandon them. The entire middle section resides primarily in C major, with forays into G major (the dominant relation). Such modulations occur freely, although not always with harmonic direction. Gershwin frequently uses a recursive harmonic progression of minor thirds to give the illusion of motion when in fact a passage does not change key from beginning to end. Modulation by thirds is a common feature of Tin Pan Alley music.

The influences of jazz and other contemporary styles are present in &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot;. Ragtime rhythms are abundant, as is the Cuban &quot;clave&quot; rhythm, which doubles as a dance rhythm in the Charleston jazz dance. Gershwin&#x27;s own intentions were to correct the belief that jazz had to be played strictly in time so that one could dance to it. The rhapsody&#x27;s tempos vary widely, and there is an almost extreme use of rubato in many places throughout. The clearest influence of jazz is the use of blue notes, and the exploration of their half-step relationship plays a key role in the rhapsody. The use of so-called &quot;vernacular&quot; instruments, such as accordion, banjo, and saxophones in the orchestra, contribute to its jazz or popular style, and the latter two of these instruments have remained part of Grofé&#x27;s &quot;standard&quot; orchestra scoring.

Gershwin incorporated different piano styles into his work. He used the techniques of stride piano, novelty piano, comic piano, and the song-plugger piano style. Stride piano&#x27;s rhythmic and improvisational style is evident in the &quot;agitato e misterioso&quot; section, which begins four bars after rehearsal 33, as well as in other sections, many of which include the orchestra. Novelty piano can be heard at rehearsal 9 with the revelation of the Train theme. The hesitations and light-hearted style of comic piano, a vaudeville approach to piano made well known by Chico Marx, are evident at rehearsal 22.

== Legacy and influence ==
=== Cultural zeitgeist ===
With the debut of &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot;, Gershwin inaugurated a new era in America&#x27;s musical history. He established his reputation as one of the eminent composers of the Jazz Age, and his composition eventually became one of the most popular of all concert works. In the &quot;American Heritage&quot; magazine, Frederic D. Schwarz posits that the famous opening clarinet glissando has become as instantly recognizable to concert audiences as the opening of Beethoven&#x27;s Fifth Symphony.

According to critic Orrin Howard of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, Gershwin&#x27;s rhapsody made an indelible mark &quot;on the fraternity of serious composers and performers—many of whom were present at the premiere—and on Gershwin himself, for its enthusiastic reception encouraged him to other and more serious projects.&quot; Howard posits that the work&#x27;s legacy is best understood as embodying the cultural zeitgeist of the Jazz Age: 

Although Gershwin&#x27;s rhapsody is &quot;by no means a definitive example of jazz in the Jazz Age&quot;, music historians such as James Ciment and Floyd Levin have similarly concurred that it is the key composition that encapsulates the spirit of the era. As early as 1927, writer F. Scott Fitzgerald opined that &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; idealized the youthful zeitgeist of the Jazz Age. In subsequent decades, both the latter era and Fitzgerald&#x27;s related literary works have been often culturally linked by critics and scholars with Gershwin&#x27;s composition. In 1941, social historian Peter Quennell opined that Fitzgerald&#x27;s novel &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; embodied &quot;the sadness and the remote jauntiness of a Gershwin tune.&quot; Accordingly, director Baz Luhrmann used &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; as a dramatic leitmotif for the character of Jay Gatsby in his 2013 film &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;, a cinematic adaptation of Fitzgerald&#x27;s 1925 novel.

Various writers, such as the American playwright and journalist Terry Teachout, have likened Gershwin himself to the character of Gatsby due to his attempt to transcend his lower-class background, his abrupt meteoric success, and his early death while in his thirties.

=== Musical portrait of New York City ===

&quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; has been interpreted as a musical portrait of early-20th-century New York City. Culture scribe Darryn King wrote in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; that &quot;Gershwin&#x27;s fusion of jazz and classical traditions captures the thriving melting pot of Jazz Age New York.&quot;

Likewise, music historian Vince Giordano has opined that &quot;the syncopation, the blue notes, the ragtime and jazz rhythms that Gershwin wrote in 1924 was really a feeling of New York City in that amazing era. The rhythm of the city seems to be in there.&quot; Pianist Lang Lang echoes this sentiment: &quot;When I hear &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot;, I see the Empire State Building somehow. I see the New York Skyline in midtown Manhattan, and I already see the coffee shops [in] Times Square.&quot;

Accordingly, the opening montage of Woody Allen&#x27;s 1979 film &quot;Manhattan&quot; features a rendition by Zubin Mehta in which quintessential New York scenes are set to the music of Gershwin&#x27;s famed jazz concerto. Twenty years later, Walt Disney Pictures used the composition for the New York segment of the 1999 animated film &quot;Fantasia 2000&quot;, in which the piece lyrically frames an animated segment drawn in the style of illustrator Al Hirschfeld.

=== Influence on composers ===
Gershwin&#x27;s rhapsody has influenced a number of composers. In 1955, &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; inspired accordionist John Serry Sr. to compose his 1957 work &quot;American Rhapsody&quot;. Brian Wilson, leader of The Beach Boys, stated on several occasions that &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; is one of his favorite pieces. He first heard the piece as a two-year-old and recalled that he adored it. According to biographer Peter Ames Carlin, the rhapsody influenced Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Smile&quot; album. &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; also inspired a collaboration between blind savant British pianist Derek Paravicini and composer Matthew King on a new concerto, called &quot;Blue&quot; premiered at the South Bank Centre in London in 2011.

=== Other uses ===
At the opening ceremony of the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, 84 pianists played simultaneously &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; in an ensemble performance. Pianists Herbie Hancock and Lang Lang performed &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; at the 50th Grammy Awards on February 10, 2008. Since 1980, the piece has been used by United Airlines in their advertisements, in pre-flight safety videos, and in the Terminal 1 underground walkway at Chicago O&#x27;Hare International Airport. &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; was sampled in Ben Folds Five&#x27;s &quot;Philosophy&quot; and South Korean girl group Red Velvet&#x27;s &quot;Birthday&quot;.

== Preservation status ==
On September 22, 2013, the Gershwin estate announced that a musicological critical edition of the full orchestral score will be eventually released. The Gershwin family, working in conjunction with the Library of Congress and the University of Michigan, are working to make these scores available to the public. Though the entire Gershwin project may take 40 years to complete, the &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; edition will be an early volume.
&quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; entered the public domain on January 1, 2020, although individual recordings of it may remain under copyright. The first published recordings from 1924 entered the public domain in 2025.

<text>Ferdinand Rudolph von Grofé (March 27, 1892 April 3, 1972), known as Ferde Grofé () was an American composer, arranger, pianist, and instrumentalist. He is best known for his 1931 five-movement symphonic poem, &quot;Grand Canyon Suite&quot;, and for orchestrating George Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; for its 1924 premiere.

During the 1920s and 1930s, he went by the name Ferdie Grofé.

==Early life==

Grofé was born in New York City in 1892 to German immigrants. He came by his extensive musical interests naturally. His family included several musicians. His father, Emil von Grofé, was a baritone who mainly performed in light opera. His mother, Elsa Johanna Bierlich von Grofé, was a professional cellist and a versatile music teacher who taught Ferde to play both the violin and the piano. Elsa&#x27;s father, Bernard Bierlich, was a cellist in the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra in New York, and her brother, Julius Bierlich, was the first violinist and concertmaster of the Los Angeles Symphony.

==Musical education==

Ferde&#x27;s father died in 1899, after which his mother took him abroad to study piano, viola, and composition in Leipzig, Germany. Ferde became proficient on a wide range of instruments including piano (his favored instrument), violin, viola (he became a violist in the LA Symphony), baritone horn, alto horn, cornet and drums. This command of musical instruments and composition gave Ferde the foundation to become, first an arranger of other composers&#x27; music, and then a composer in his own right.

Grofé left home at age 14 and variously worked as a milkman, truck driver, usher, newsboy, elevator operator, helper in a book bindery, iron factory worker, and played in a piano bar for two dollars a night, and as an accompanist. He continued studying piano and violin. When he was 15 he was performing with dance bands. He also played the alto horn in brass bands. He was 17 when he wrote his first commissioned work, &quot;Elks&#x27; Grand Reunion March &amp; Two-step&quot;.

==Arranger for Paul Whiteman==

Beginning in 1920, he played piano with the Paul Whiteman orchestra. He served as Whiteman&#x27;s chief arranger from 1920 to 1932. He made hundreds of arrangements of popular songs, Broadway show music, and tunes of all types for Whiteman.

Grofé&#x27;s most memorable arrangement is that of George Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot;, which established Grofé&#x27;s reputation among musicians. Grofé took what Gershwin had written for two pianos and orchestrated it for Whiteman&#x27;s orchestra. He transformed Gershwin&#x27;s musical canvas with the colors and many of the creative touches for which it is so well known. He went on to create two more arrangements of the piece in later years. Grofé&#x27;s 1942 orchestration for full orchestra of &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; is the one most frequently heard today. In 1928, Gershwin wrote a letter to ASCAP complaining that Grofé had listed himself as a composer of &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot;. The dispute was settled, with Grofé receiving a portion of the music royalties for the piece. Despite this misunderstanding, Grofé served as one of the pallbearers at Gershwin&#x27;s funeral in 1937.

In 1932, &quot;The New York Times&quot; called Grofé &quot;the Prime Minister of Jazz&quot;. This was an oblique reference to the fact that Whiteman was widely called &quot;King of Jazz&quot;, especially after the appearance of the 1930 &quot;King of Jazz&quot; film which featured Whiteman and his music.

During this time, Grofé also recorded numerous piano rolls for the American Piano Company (Ampico) in New York. Some captured performances were embellished with additional notes after the initial recording took place to attempt to convey the thick lush nature of his orchestra&#x27;s style. Hence those published rolls are marked &quot;Played by Ferdie Grofé (assisted)&quot;.

Not everybody appreciated Grofé&#x27;s flowery arrangements during this time. In a review of a Whiteman jazz concert in New York, one writer said the music was expected to be pleasing, and &quot;it proved so when it was repeated last night, in spite of the excessive instrumentation of Ferde Grofé.&quot; A writer of a later generation said &quot;the Grofé and Gould pieces were the essence of slick commercialism...&quot;

==Radio, TV, conducting and teaching==
&quot;Mardi Gras&quot; (from &quot;Mississippi Suite&quot;) was recorded in the radio transcription series &quot;Shilkret Novelties&quot; in 1931. and again by Nathaniel Shilkret in RCA Victor&#x27;s transcription series &quot;His Master&#x27;s Voice of the Air&quot; in 1932. &quot;On the Trail&quot; (from &quot;Grand Canyon Suite&quot;) was also recorded in the &quot;His Master&#x27;s Voice of the Air&quot; transcriptions.

During the 1930s, he was the orchestra leader on several radio programs, including Fred Allen&#x27;s show, the George Burns and Gracie Allen show and his own &quot;The Ferde Grofé Show&quot;. The &quot;On the Trail&quot; segment of &quot;Grand Canyon Suite&quot; was used for many years as the &quot;musical signature&quot; for radio and television programs sponsored by Philip Morris cigarettes, beginning with their 1933 radio program featuring Grofé and his orchestra and concluding with &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; (1951–57). Jon Hendricks wrote lyrics for &quot;On the Trail&quot;, and the song was recorded for Hendricks&#x27; album &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; (1975). The piano version sheet music of the suite includes lyrics to the central section of &quot;On the Trail&quot; by songwriter Gus Kahn.

Several times he conducted orchestral programs in New York&#x27;s Carnegie Hall. On March 25, 1938, Ferde Grofe and his Symphony Orchestra played a concert at Carnegie Hall for the benefit of &quot;Free Milk Fund for Babies, Inc.&quot;, Mrs. William Randolph Hearst, President and Founder. The concert included a number of premieres, with George Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Three Preludes&quot; for orchestra (scored by Ferde Grofé) featured.

In January 1933 the premiere of his &quot;Tabloid&quot;, an orchestral suite in four movements, was presented in Carnegie Hall. In 1937, he conducted a concert tribute to George Gershwin at Lewisohn Stadium. The turnout (20,223 people) was the largest in that stadium&#x27;s history. In 1934, Grofé announced he was working on an opera, to be based on the Edgar Allan Poe story &quot;The Fall of the House of Usher&quot;.

In 1943, he was a guest on &quot;Paul Whiteman Presents&quot;. In 1944, he was a panelist on &quot;A Song Is Born&quot; radio show, judging the works of unknown composers. Before that time he had served several times as judge or co-judge in musical contests. Grofé was later employed as a conductor and faculty member at the Juilliard School of Music, where he taught orchestration.

==Grofé&#x27;s compositions==
In addition to being an arranger, Grofé was a composer in his own right. While still with Whiteman, in 1926, he wrote &quot;Mississippi Suite&quot;, which Whiteman recorded in a shortened format in 1927. He wrote a number of other pieces, including a theme for the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair and suites for Niagara Falls and the Hudson River. Possibly as a result of his World&#x27;s Fair theme, October 13, 1940, was designated &quot;Ferde Grofé Day&quot; at the American pavilion of the World&#x27;s Fair. In 1961, Grofé conducted his &quot;Niagara Falls Suite&quot; as part of the ceremony marking the opening of the first stage of the Niagara Falls Power Generation project.

Other notable compositions by Grofé were the &quot;Death Valley Suite&quot; and a music production about Mark Twain. The &quot;Death Valley Suite&quot; is a short symphonic suite written by Grofé in 1949, depicting the westward travels of pioneers through the &quot;harsh lands&quot; of Death Valley in California. Grofé was commissioned by the Death Valley 49ers, a nonprofit organization devoted to preserving the pioneering and mining history of the Death Valley region encompassing Death Valley National Monument (now Death Valley National Park) and the surrounding area. The composition and music was part of a pageant performed on December 3, 1949, celebrating the 100th anniversary of the Forty-niners who came by way of Death Valley in search of gold and other riches, as well as celebrating the California state centennial (1850–1950). The 1949 pageant setting was outdoors at Desolation Canyon in Death Valley. Grofé was the conductor, and actor James Stewart was the narrator. In 1960, work was announced on a musical production based on the life of Mark Twain. The music was first assigned to Victor Young, but Grofé was later brought in to complete the work.

Grofé is best known for his composition of the &quot;Grand Canyon Suite&quot; (1931), a work regarded highly enough to be recorded for RCA Victor with the NBC Symphony conducted by Arturo Toscanini (in Carnegie Hall in 1945, with the composer present). The earlier &quot;Mississippi Suite&quot; along with the later &quot;Death Valley Suite&quot; are occasionally performed and recorded. Grofé conducted the Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra in his &quot;Grand Canyon Suite&quot; and his piano concerto (with pianist Jesús María Sanromá) for Everest Records in 1960; the recording was digitally remastered and issued on CD in 1997.

In 1958, Walt Disney released a live-action, short subject film of the Grand Canyon using the Grand Canyon Suite music. The 30-minute Technicolor and CinemaScope film, entitled &quot;Grand Canyon&quot;, used no actors or dialogue, simply shots of the Grand Canyon itself and several animals around the area, all shown with Grofé&#x27;s music accompanying the visuals. The short won an Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Subject, and was shown as a featurette accompanying Disney&#x27;s 1959 &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;. Today, the &quot;Grand Canyon Suite&#x27;s&quot; third movement, &quot;On the Trail&quot;, can be heard playing as the Disneyland Railroad passes the Grand Canyon sections of the &quot;Grand Circle Tour&quot; of Disneyland.

Robert Moses, master urban planner, commissioned Grofé to compose the music for the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair. The fair&#x27;s opening day&#x27;s big musical performance was Paul Lavalle conducting a 94-piece orchestra in the world premiere of Grofé&#x27;s &quot;World&#x27;s Fair Suite&quot;. Moses had previously commissioned Grofé to compose the theme for his 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair. Mr. Grofé was present, listening from a wheelchair, having suffered a stroke in 1961. His score was in five movements—&quot;Unisphere&quot;, &quot;International&quot;, &quot;Fun at the Fair&quot;, &quot;Pavilions of Industry&quot; and &quot;National&quot;.

==Films==
Grofé began his second career as a composer of film scores in 1930, when he provided arrangements (and perhaps portions of the score) for the film &quot;King of Jazz&quot;. Published data for this movie do not list Grofé as the score&#x27;s composer, however. He is also credited with the film score for the 1930 movie &quot;Redemption&quot;.

A review for the 1944 Joseph Lewis film &quot;Minstrel Man&quot; stated, &quot;the music, scored by Ferde Grofé, is an outstanding item.&quot; Grofé was nominated, along with Leo Erdody, for an Academy Award in the category &quot;Scoring of a Musical Picture&quot; for this film.

The score he composed for &quot;Rocketship X-M&quot; (1950) was the first science fiction movie to feature the electronic instrument known as the theremin.

His other original film scores included &quot;Early to Bed&quot; (1928), &quot;Diamond Jim&quot; (1935), &quot;Time Out of Mind&quot; (1947) and &quot;The Return of Jesse James&quot; (1950).

==Personal life==
Although he spent the first half of his life living in New Jersey and working in and around New York City, by 1945 he had moved to Los Angeles full-time. In 1945 he also sold his Teaneck, New Jersey, home.

Grofé married his first wife, Mildred Fanchette Grizzelle, a lyric soprano singer, in San Francisco, CA on March 14, 1916, and divorced in 1928. In May 1951, he filed for divorce in Las Vegas from his second wife, Ruth, whom he had married in 1929. The day after the divorce was granted, he married his third wife, Anna May Lampton (January 13, 1952).

==Death==
Ferde Grofé died in Santa Monica, California, on April 3, 1972, aged 80, and was buried in the Mausoleum of the Golden West at the Inglewood Park Cemetery in Inglewood, California. He left four children, Ferdinand Rudolf Jr., Anne, Robert, and Delight, all of the Los Angeles area.

<text>Metastasis is a pathogenic agent&#x27;s spreading from an initial or primary site to a different or secondary site within the host&#x27;s body; the term is typically used when referring to metastasis by a cancerous tumor. The newly pathological sites, then, are metastases (mets). It is generally distinguished from cancer invasion, which is the direct extension and penetration by cancer cells into neighboring tissues.

Cancer occurs after cells are genetically altered to proliferate rapidly and indefinitely. This uncontrolled proliferation by mitosis produces a primary heterogeneic tumour. The cells which constitute the tumor eventually undergo metaplasia, followed by dysplasia then anaplasia, resulting in a malignant phenotype. This malignancy allows for invasion into the circulation, followed by invasion to a second site for tumorigenesis.

Some cancer cells, known as circulating tumor cells (CTCs), are able to penetrate the walls of lymphatic or blood vessels, and circulate through the bloodstream to other sites and tissues in the body. This process, known respectively as &quot;lymphatic&quot; or &quot;hematogenous&quot; spread, allows not only single cells but also groups of cells, or CTC clusters, to travel. Evidence suggests that CTC clusters may retain their multicellular configuration throughout metastasis, enhancing their ability to establish secondary tumors. This perspective aligns with the cancer exodus hypothesis, which posits that maintaining this cluster structure contributes to a higher metastatic potential. Metastasis is one of the hallmarks of cancer, distinguishing it from benign tumors. Most cancers can metastasize, although in varying degrees. Basal cell carcinoma for example rarely metastasizes.

When tumor cells metastasize, the new tumor is called a &quot;secondary&quot; or &quot;metastatic&quot; tumor, and its cells are similar to those in the original or primary tumor. This means that if breast cancer metastasizes to the lungs, the secondary tumor is made up of abnormal breast cells, not of abnormal lung cells. The tumor in the lung is then called &quot;metastatic breast cancer&quot;, not &quot;lung cancer&quot;. Metastasis is a key element in cancer staging systems such as the TNM staging system, where it represents the &quot;M&quot;. In overall stage grouping, metastasis places a cancer in Stage IV. The possibilities of curative treatment are greatly reduced, or often entirely removed when a cancer has metastasized.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Initially, nearby lymph nodes are struck early. The lungs, liver, brain, and bones are the most common metastasis locations from solid tumors.
* In lymph node metastasis, a common symptom is lymphadenopathy
* Lung metastasis: cough, hemoptysis and dyspnea (shortness of breath)
* Liver metastasis: hepatomegaly (enlarged liver), nausea and jaundice
* Bone metastasis: bone pain, fracture of affected bones
* Brain metastasis: neurological symptoms such as headaches, seizures, and vertigo

Although advanced cancer may cause pain, it is often not the first symptom.

Some patients, however, do not show any symptoms.
When the organ gets a metastatic disease it begins to shrink until its lymph nodes burst, or undergo lysis.

== Pathophysiology ==
Metastatic tumors are very common in the late stages of cancer. The spread of metastasis may occur via the blood or the lymphatics or through both routes. The most common sites of metastases are the lungs, liver, brain, and the bones

Currently, three main theories have been proposed to explain the metastatic pathway of cancer: the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) hypothesis (1), the cancer stem cell hypothesis (2), and the macrophage–cancer cell fusion hybrid hypothesis (3). Some new hypotheses were suggested as well, i.e., under the effect of particular biochemical and/or physical stressors, cancer cells can undergo nuclear expulsion with subsequent macrophage engulfment and fusion, with the formation of cancer fusion cells (CFCs). Understanding the enigma of cancer cell spread to distant sites, which accounts for over 90% of cancer-related deaths, necessitates comprehensive investigation. Key outstanding questions revolve around the survival and migration of cancer cells, such as the nucleus, as they face challenges in passage through capillary valves and hydrodynamic shear forces in the circulation system, making CTCs an unlikely source of metastasis. Moreover, understanding how cancer cells adapt to the metastatic niche and remain dormant (tumor dormancy) for extended periods presents difficult questions that require further investigation.

=== Factors involved ===
Metastasis involves a complex series of steps in which cancer cells leave the original tumor site and migrate to other parts of the body via the bloodstream, via the lymphatic system, or by direct extension. To do so, malignant cells break away from the primary tumor and attach to and degrade proteins that make up the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM), which separates the tumor from adjoining tissues. By degrading these proteins, cancer cells are able to breach the ECM and escape. The location of the metastases is not always random, with different types of cancer tending to spread to particular organs and tissues at a rate that is higher than expected by statistical chance alone. Breast cancer, for example, tends to metastasize to the bones and lungs. This specificity seems to be mediated by soluble signal molecules such as chemokines and transforming growth factor beta. The body resists metastasis by a variety of mechanisms through the actions of a class of proteins known as metastasis suppressors, of which about a dozen are known.

Human cells exhibit different kinds of motion: collective motility, mesenchymal-type movement, and amoeboid movement. Cancer cells often opportunistically switch between different kinds of motion. Some cancer researchers hope to find treatments that can stop or at least slow down the spread of cancer by somehow blocking some necessary step in one or more kinds of motion.

All steps of the metastatic cascade involve a number of physical processes. Cell migration requires the generation of forces, and when cancer cells transmigrate through the vasculature, this requires physical gaps in the blood vessels to form. Besides forces, the regulation of various types of cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesions is crucial during metastasis.

The metastatic steps are critically regulated by various cell types, including the blood vessel cells (endothelial cells), immune cells or stromal cells. The growth of a new network of blood vessels, called tumor angiogenesis, is a crucial hallmark of cancer. It has therefore been suggested that angiogenesis inhibitors would prevent the growth of metastases. Endothelial progenitor cells have been shown to have a strong influence on metastasis and angiogenesis. Endothelial progenitor cells are important in tumor growth, angiogenesis and metastasis, and can be marked using the Inhibitor of DNA Binding 1 (ID1). This novel finding meant that investigators gained the ability to track endothelial progenitor cells from the bone marrow to the blood to the tumor-stroma and even incorporated in tumor vasculature. Endothelial progenitor cells incorporated in tumor vasculature suggests that this cell type in blood-vessel development is important in a tumor setting and metastasis. Furthermore, ablation of the endothelial progenitor cells in the bone marrow can lead to a significant decrease in tumor growth and vasculature development. Therefore, endothelial progenitor cells are important in tumor biology and present novel therapeutic targets. The immune system is typically deregulated in cancer and affects many stages of tumor progression, including metastasis.

Epigenetic regulation also plays an important role in the metastatic outgrowth of disseminated tumor cells. Metastases display alterations in histone modifications, such as H3K4-methylation and H3K9-methylation, when compared to matching primary tumors. These epigenetic modifications in metastases may allow the proliferation and survival of disseminated tumor cells in distant organs.

A recent study shows that PKC-iota promotes melanoma cell invasion by activating Vimentin during EMT. PKC-iota inhibition or knockdown resulted in an increase in E-cadherin and RhoA levels while decreasing total Vimentin, phosphorylated Vimentin (S39) and Par6 in metastatic melanoma cells. These results suggested that PKC-ι is involved in signaling pathways which upregulate EMT in melanoma thereby directly stimulates metastasis.

Recently, a series of high-profile experiments suggests that the co-option of intercellular cross-talk mediated by exosome vesicles is a critical factor involved in all steps of the invasion-metastasis cascade.

=== Routes ===
Metastasis occurs by the following four routes:

==== Transcoelomic ====

The spread of a malignancy into body cavities can occur via penetrating the surface of the peritoneal, pleural, pericardial, or subarachnoid spaces. For example, ovarian tumors can spread transperitoneally to the surface of the liver.

==== Lymphatic spread ====

Lymphatic spread allows the transport of tumor cells to regional lymph nodes near the primary tumor and ultimately, to other parts of the body. This is called nodal involvement, positive nodes, or regional disease. &quot;Positive nodes&quot; is a term that would be used by medical specialists to describe regional lymph nodes that tested positive for malignancy. It is common medical practice to test by biopsy at least one lymph node near a tumor site when carrying out surgery to examine or remove a tumor. This lymph node is then called a sentinel lymph node.
Lymphatic spread is the most common route of initial metastasis for carcinomas. In contrast, it is uncommon for a sarcoma to metastasize via this route. Localized spread to regional lymph nodes near the primary tumor is not normally counted as a metastasis, although this is a sign of a worse outcome.
The lymphatic system does eventually drain from the thoracic duct and right lymphatic duct into the systemic venous system at the venous angle and into the brachiocephalic veins, and therefore these metastatic cells can also eventually spread through the haematogenous route.

==== Hematogenous spread ====

This is typical route of metastasis for sarcomas, but it is also the favored route for certain types of carcinoma, such as renal cell carcinoma originating in the kidney and follicular carcinomas of the thyroid. Because of their thinner walls, veins are more frequently invaded than are arteries, and metastasis tends to follow the pattern of venous flow. That is, hematogenous spread often follows distinct patterns depending on the location of the primary tumor. For example, colorectal cancer spreads primarily through the portal vein to the liver.

==== Canalicular spread ====

Some tumors, especially carcinomas may metastasize along anatomical canalicular spaces. These spaces include for example the bile ducts, the urinary system, the airways and the subarachnoid space. The process is similar to that of transcoelomic spread. However, often it remains unclear whether simultaneously diagnosed tumors of a canalicular system are one metastatic process or in fact independent tumors caused by the same agent (field cancerization).

===Organ-specific targets===

There is a propensity for certain tumors to seed in particular organs. This was first discussed as the seed and soil theory by Stephen Paget in 1889. The propensity for a metastatic cell to spread to a particular organ is termed &#x27;organotropism&#x27;. For example, prostate cancer usually metastasizes to the bones. In a similar manner, colon cancer has a tendency to metastasize to the liver. Stomach cancer often metastasises to the ovary in women, when it is called a Krukenberg tumor.

According to the seed and soil theory, it is difficult for cancer cells to survive outside their region of origin, so in order to metastasize they must find a location with similar characteristics. For example, breast tumor cells, which gather calcium ions from breast milk, metastasize to bone tissue, where they can gather calcium ions from bone. Malignant melanoma spreads to the brain, presumably because neural tissue and melanocytes arise from the same cell line in the embryo.

In 1928, James Ewing challenged the seed and soil theory, and proposed that metastasis occurs purely by anatomic and mechanical routes. This hypothesis has been recently utilized to suggest several hypotheses about the life cycle of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and to postulate that the patterns of spread could be better understood through a &#x27;filter and flow&#x27; perspective. However, contemporary evidences indicate that the primary tumour may dictate organotropic metastases by inducing the formation of pre-metastatic niches at distant sites, where incoming metastatic cells may engraft and colonise. Specifically, exosome vesicles secreted by tumours have been shown to home to pre-metastatic sites, where they activate pro-metastatic processes such as angiogenesis and modify the immune contexture, so as to foster a favourable microenvironment for secondary tumour growth.

=== Metastasis and primary cancer ===
It is theorized that metastasis always coincides with a primary cancer, and, as such, is a tumor that started from a cancer cell or cells in another part of the body. However, over 10% of patients presenting to oncology units will have metastases without a primary tumor found. In these cases, doctors refer to the primary tumor as &quot;unknown&quot; or &quot;occult,&quot; and the patient is said to have cancer of unknown primary origin (CUP) or unknown primary tumors (UPT). It is estimated that 3% of all cancers are of unknown primary origin. Studies have shown that, if simple questioning does not reveal the cancer&#x27;s source (coughing up blood—&quot;probably lung&quot;, urinating blood—&quot;probably bladder&quot;), complex imaging will not either. In some of these cases a primary tumor may appear later.

The use of immunohistochemistry has permitted pathologists to give an identity to many of these metastases. However, imaging of the indicated area only occasionally reveals a primary. In rare cases (e.g., of melanoma), no primary tumor is found, even on autopsy. It is therefore thought that some primary tumors can regress completely, but leave their metastases behind. In other cases, the tumor might just be too small and/or in an unusual location to be diagnosed.

==Diagnosis==

The cells in a metastatic tumor resemble those in the primary tumor. Once the cancerous tissue is examined under a microscope to determine the cell type, a doctor can usually tell whether that type of cell is normally found in the part of the body from which the tissue sample was taken.

For instance, breast cancer cells look the same whether they are found in the breast or have spread to another part of the body. So, if a tissue sample taken from a tumor in the lung contains cells that look like breast cells, the doctor determines that the lung tumor is a secondary tumor. Still, the determination of the primary tumor can often be very difficult, and the pathologist may have to use several adjuvant techniques, such as immunohistochemistry, FISH (fluorescent in situ hybridization), and others. Despite the use of techniques, in some cases the primary tumor remains unidentified.

Metastatic cancers may be found at the same time as the primary tumor, or months or years later. When a second tumor is found in a patient that has been treated for cancer in the past, it is more often a metastasis than another primary tumor.

It was previously thought that most cancer cells have a low metastatic potential and that there are rare cells that develop the ability to metastasize through the development of somatic mutations. According to this theory, diagnosis of metastatic cancers is only possible after the event of metastasis. Traditional means of diagnosing cancer (e.g. a biopsy) would only investigate a subpopulation of the cancer cells and would very likely not sample from the subpopulation with metastatic potential.

The somatic mutation theory of metastasis development has not been substantiated in human cancers. Rather, it seems that the genetic state of the primary tumor reflects the ability of that cancer to metastasize. Research comparing gene expression between primary and metastatic adenocarcinomas identified a subset of genes whose expression could distinguish primary tumors from metastatic tumors, dubbed a &quot;metastatic signature.&quot; Up-regulated genes in the signature include: SNRPF, HNRPAB, DHPS and securin. Actin, myosin and MHC class II down-regulation was also associated with the signature. Additionally, the metastatic-associated expression of these genes was also observed in some primary tumors, indicating that cells with the potential to metastasize could be identified concurrently with diagnosis of the primary tumor. Recent work identified a form of genetic instability in cancer called chromosome instability (CIN) as a driver of metastasis. In aggressive cancer cells, loose DNA fragments from unstable chromosomes spill in the cytosol leading to the chronic activation of innate immune pathways, which are hijacked by cancer cells to spread to distant organs.

Expression of this metastatic signature has been correlated with a poor prognosis and has been shown to be consistent in several types of cancer. Prognosis was shown to be worse for individuals whose primary tumors expressed the metastatic signature. Additionally, the expression of these metastatic-associated genes was shown to apply to other cancer types in addition to adenocarcinoma. Metastases of breast cancer, medulloblastoma and prostate cancer all had similar expression patterns of these metastasis-associated genes.

The identification of this metastasis-associated signature provides promise for identifying cells with metastatic potential within the primary tumor and hope for improving the prognosis of these metastatic-associated cancers. Additionally, identifying the genes whose expression is changed in metastasis offers potential targets to inhibit metastasis.

== Management ==
Treatment and survival is determined, to a great extent, by whether or not a cancer remains localized or spreads to other locations in the body. If the cancer metastasizes to other tissues or organs it usually dramatically increases a patient&#x27;s likelihood of death. Some cancers—such as some forms of leukemia, a cancer of the blood, or malignancies in the brain—can kill without spreading at all.

Once a cancer has metastasized it may still be treated with radiosurgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, biological therapy, hormone therapy, surgery, or a combination of these interventions (&quot;multimodal therapy&quot;). The choice of treatment depends on many factors, including the type of primary cancer, the size and location of the metastases, the patient&#x27;s age and general health, and the types of treatments used previously. In patients diagnosed with CUP it is often still possible to treat the disease even when the primary tumor cannot be located.

Current treatments are rarely able to cure metastatic cancer though some tumors, such as testicular cancer and thyroid cancer, are usually curable.

Palliative care, care aimed at improving the quality of life of people with major illness, has been recommended as part of management programs for metastasis. Results from a systematic review of the literature on radiation therapy for brain metastases found that there is little evidence to inform comparative effectiveness and patient-centered outcomes on quality of life, functional status, and cognitive effects.

==Research==
Although metastasis is widely accepted to be the result of the tumor cells migration, there is a hypothesis saying that some metastases are the result of inflammatory processes by abnormal immune cells. The existence of metastatic cancers in the absence of primary tumors also suggests that metastasis is not always caused by malignant cells that leave primary tumors.

The research done by Sarna&#x27;s team proved that heavily pigmented melanoma cells have Young&#x27;s modulus about 4.93, when in non-pigmented ones it was only 0.98. In another experiment they found that elasticity of melanoma cells is important for its metastasis and growth: non-pigmented tumors were bigger than pigmented and it was much easier for them to spread. They showed that there are both pigmented and non-pigmented cells in melanoma tumors, so that they can both be drug-resistant and metastatic.

==History==
The first physician to report the possibility of local metastasis from a primary cancerous source to nearby tissues was Ibn Sina. He described a case of breast cancer and metastatic condition in The Canon of Medicine. His hypothesis was based on clinical course of the patient.

In March 2014 researchers discovered the oldest complete example of a human with metastatic cancer. The tumors had developed in a 3,000-year-old skeleton found in 2013 in a tomb in Sudan dating back to 1200 BC. The skeleton was analyzed using radiography and a scanning electron microscope. These findings were published in the &quot;Public Library of Science&quot; journal.

==Etymology==
Metastasis is an Ancient Greek word (μετάστασις) meaning &quot;displacement&quot;, from μετά, &quot;meta&quot;, &quot;next&quot;, and στάσις, &quot;stasis&quot;, &quot;placement&quot;.

<text>Christoph Gottfried Bardili (18 May 17615 June 1808) was a German philosopher and cousin of Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling. He was critical of Kantian idealism and proposed his own system of philosophy known as rational realism, a view based purely upon &quot;thinking as thinking&quot;.

==Life==
Bardili was born on 18 May 1761 in Blaubeuren in the Duchy of Württemberg. In 1786 he became a Repentant at the Stift, a Protestant theological college in Tübingen. In 1790 he became a professor of philosophy at the Karlsschule in Stuttgart. After the closing of the Karlschule in 1794, he became a professor of philosophy at the Stuttgart &quot;Gymnasium Illustre&quot; where he taught until his death on 5 June 1808.

He dissented strongly from the Kantian distinction between matter and form of thought, and urged that philosophy should consider only thought in itself, pure thought, the ground or possibility of being.

The fundamental principle of thought is, according to him, the law of identity; logical thinking is real thinking. The matter upon which thought operated is in itself indefinite and is rendered definite through the action of thought. Bardili worked out his idea in a one-sided manner. He held that thought has in itself no power of development, and ultimately reduced it to arithmetical computation.

According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition:
Bardili died in .

<text>The Constitution of Ireland (, ) is the fundamental law of Ireland. It asserts the national sovereignty of the Irish people. It guarantees certain fundamental rights, along with a popularly elected non-executive president, a bicameral parliament, a separation of powers and judicial review.

It is the second constitution of the Irish state since independence, replacing the 1922 Constitution of the Irish Free State. It came into force on 29 December 1937 following a statewide plebiscite held on 1 July 1937. The Constitution may be amended solely by a national referendum. It is the longest continually operating republican constitution within the European Union.

==Background==
The Constitution of Ireland replaced the Constitution of the Irish Free State, which had been in effect since the independence, as a dominion, of the Irish state from the United Kingdom on 6 December 1922. There were two main motivations for replacing the constitution in 1937. Firstly, the Statute of Westminster 1931 granted parliamentary autonomy to the six British Dominions (now known as Commonwealth realms) within a British Commonwealth of Nations. This had the effect of making the dominions sovereign nations in their own right. The Irish Free State constitution of 1922 was, in the eyes of many, associated with the controversial Anglo-Irish Treaty. The anti-treaty faction, who opposed the treaty initially by force of arms, was so opposed to the institutions of the new Irish Free State that it initially took an abstentionist line toward them, boycotting them altogether. However, the largest element of this faction became convinced that abstentionism could not be maintained forever. This element, led by Éamon de Valera, formed the Fianna Fáil party in 1926, which entered into government following the 1932 general election.

After 1932, under the provisions of the Statute of Westminster, some of the articles of the original Constitution which were required by the Anglo-Irish Treaty were dismantled by acts of the Oireachtas of the Irish Free State. Such amendments removed references to the Oath of Allegiance, appeals to the United Kingdom&#x27;s Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, the British Crown and the Governor-General. The sudden abdication of Edward VIII in December 1936 was quickly used to redefine the Royal connection. Nevertheless, the Fianna Fáil government still desired to replace the constitutional document they saw as having been imposed by the British government in 1922.

The second motive for replacing the original constitution was primarily symbolic. De Valera wanted to put an Irish stamp on the institutions of government, and chose to do this in particular through the use of Irish language nomenclature.

===Drafting process===
De Valera personally supervised the writing of the Constitution. It was drafted initially by John Hearne, legal adviser to the Department of External Affairs (now called the Department of Foreign Affairs). It was translated into Irish over a number of drafts by a group headed by Micheál Ó Gríobhtha (assisted by Risteárd Ó Foghludha), who worked in the Irish Department of Education. De Valera served as his own External Affairs Minister, hence the use of the Department&#x27;s Legal Advisor, with whom he had previously worked closely, as opposed to the Attorney General or someone from the Department of the President of the Executive Council. He also received significant input from John Charles McQuaid, the then President of Blackrock College, on religious, educational, family and social welfare issues. McQuaid later became, in 1940, the Catholic Archbishop of Dublin. Other religious leaders who were consulted were Archbishop Edward Byrne (Roman Catholic), Archbishop John Gregg (Church of Ireland), William Massey (Methodist) and James Irwin (Presbyterian).

There are a number of instances where the texts in English and Irish clash, a potential dilemma which the Constitution resolves by favouring the Irish text even though English is more commonly used in the official sphere.

A draft of the constitution was presented personally to the Vatican for review and comment on two occasions by the Department Head at External Relations, Joseph P. Walsh. Prior to its tabling in Dáil Éireann and presentation to the Irish electorate in a plebiscite, Vatican Secretary of State Eugenio Cardinal Pacelli, the future Pope Pius XII, said of the final amended draft: &quot;We do not approve, neither do we disapprove; We shall maintain silence.&quot; The &quot;quid pro quo&quot; for this indulgence of the Catholic Church&#x27;s interests in Ireland was the degree of respectability which it conferred on De Valera&#x27;s formerly denounced republican faction and its reputation as the &#x27;semi-constitutional&#x27; political wing of the &#x27;irregular&#x27; anti-treaty forces.

During the Great Depression, as social polarisation generated campaigns and strikes, Catholic social jurists aimed to forestall class conflict. Taoiseach Éamon de Valera and clericalist advisors such as John Charles McQuaid considered constitutional provisions to incorporate land redistribution, credit system regulation, and welfare rights. Late in the drafting process, however, de Valera re-wrote these initially robust socio-economic rights as non-binding &#x27;directive principles&#x27;, primarily to satisfy the Department of Finance&#x27;s preferences for minimal state spending. In line with Ireland&#x27;s banks and grazier farming interests, the final wording thus preserved the state&#x27;s existing currency and cattle trading relations with the United Kingdom.

===Adoption===

The text of the draft constitution, with minor amendments, was approved on 14 June 1937 by Dáil Éireann (then the sole house of parliament, the Seanad having been abolished the previous year).
The draft constitution was then put to a plebiscite on 1 July 1937 (the same day as the 1937 general election), when it was passed by a plurality. 56% of voters were in favour, comprising 38.6% of the whole electorate. The constitution came into force on 29 December 1937 and, to mark the occasion, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs issued two commemorative stamps on that date.

Among the groups who opposed the constitution were supporters of Fine Gael and the Labour Party, Unionists, and some independents and feminists. The question put to voters was &quot;Do you approve of the Draft Constitution which is the subject of this plebiscite?&quot;.
===Response===
When the draft new constitution was published, the &quot;Irish Independent&quot; described it as one of de Valera&#x27;s &quot;finest tributes to his predecessors&quot;. &quot;The Irish Times&quot; criticised the constitution&#x27;s assertion of a territorial claim on Northern Ireland, and the absence in its text of any reference to the British Commonwealth. The London-based &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; included in its criticism the special position assigned to the Church of Rome under the new constitution. &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; concluded it would only help to &quot;perpetuate division&quot; between Dublin and Belfast. &quot;The Irish Catholic&quot; concluded it was a &quot;noble document in harmony with papal teachings&quot;.

When the new constitution was enacted, the British government, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;contented itself with a legalistic protest&quot;. Its protest took the form of a communiqué on 30 December 1937, in which the British stated:

The other governments of the British Commonwealth countries chose to continue to regard Ireland as a member of the British Commonwealth. A proposal by the Northern Ireland government that Northern Ireland be renamed &quot;Ulster&quot; in response to the new Irish constitution was aborted after it was determined that this would require Westminster legislation.

The Irish government received a message of goodwill from 268 United States congressmen, including eight senators. The signatories expressed &quot;their ardent congratulations on the birth of the State of Ireland and the consequent coming into effect of the new constitution&quot;, adding that &quot;We regard the adoption of the new constitution and the emergence of the State of Ireland as events of the utmost importance.&quot;

Feminists such as Hannah Sheehy Skeffington claimed that certain articles threatened their rights as citizens and as workers. Article 41.2, for example, equated womanhood with motherhood and further specified a woman&#x27;s &#x27;life within the home&#x27;. The Women Graduates&#x27; Association, the Joint Committee of Women&#x27;s Societies and Social Workers, together with the Irish Women Workers&#x27; Union mobilised a two-month campaign seeking the provisions&#x27; amendment or deletion.

The Republican Congress also critiqued the constitution&#x27;s &quot;stone-age conception of womanhood&quot;. Writing in the Irish Democrat, Peadar O&#x27;Donnell and Frank Ryan condemned the 1937 Constitution for upholding private property as a sacred, &#x27;natural right&#x27; and declaring that capitalism was &#x27;something ordained by Providence forever, amen!&#x27; The Congress further opposed the Roman Catholic Church&#x27;s position as a &#x27;State or semi-State church&#x27; in violation of republican principles and an offence to Protestants throughout the island. The &#x27;Roman Catholic Bishops of the South&#x27;, O&#x27;Donnell claimed, now functioned as &#x27;the watchdogs of the private property classes&#x27;.

==Main provisions==

The official text of the Constitution consists of a Preamble, numbered Articles arranged under headings, and a final dedication ( &quot;For the glory of God and the Honour of Ireland&quot;, from the Annals of the Four Masters). Its overall length is approximately 16,000 words.

===Preamble (full text)===
:&quot;In the Name of the Most Holy Trinity, from Whom is all authority and to Whom, as our final end, all actions both of men and States must be referred&quot;,
:&quot;We, the people of Éire&quot;,
:&quot;Humbly acknowledging all our obligations to our Divine Lord, Jesus Christ, Who sustained our fathers through centuries of trial&quot;,
:&quot;Gratefully remembering their heroic and unremitting struggle to regain the rightful independence of our Nation&quot;,
:&quot;And seeking to promote the common good, with due observance of Prudence, Justice and Charity, so that the dignity and freedom of the individual may be assured, true social order attained, the unity of our country restored, and concord established with other nations&quot;,
:&quot;Do hereby adopt, enact, and give to ourselves this Constitution&quot;.

===Characteristics of the nation and state===

*National sovereignty: The constitution asserts the &quot;inalienable, indefeasible, and sovereign right&quot; of the Irish people to self-determination (Article 1). The state is declared to be &quot;sovereign, independent, [and] democratic&quot; (Article 5).
*Popular sovereignty: It is stated that all powers of government &quot;derive, under God, from the people&quot; (Article 6.1). However, it is also stated that those powers &quot;are exercisable only by or on the authority of the organs of State&quot; established by the Constitution (Article 6.2).
*Name of the state: The Constitution declares that &quot;[the] name of the State is &quot;Éire&quot;, or, in the English language, &quot;Ireland&quot;&quot; (Article 4). Under The Republic of Ireland Act 1948 the term &quot;Republic of Ireland&quot; is the official &quot;description&quot; of the state; the Oireachtas, however, has left unaltered &quot;Ireland&quot; as the formal name of the state as defined by the Constitution.
*United Ireland: Article 2, as substituted after the Good Friday Agreement, asserts that &quot;every person born in the island of Ireland&quot; has the right &quot;to be part of the Irish Nation&quot;; however, Article 9.2 now limits this to persons having at least one parent as an Irish citizen. Article 3 declares that it is the &quot;firm will of the Irish Nation&quot; to bring about a united Ireland, provided that this occurs &quot;only by peaceful means&quot;, and only with the express consent of the majority of the people in both jurisdictions of Ireland.
*National flag: The national flag is defined as &quot;the tricolour of green, white and orange&quot; (Article 7).
*Capital city: The Houses of the Oireachtas (parliament) must usually meet in or near Dublin (Article 15.1.3°) (&quot;or in such other place as they may from time to time determine&quot;), and the President&#x27;s official residence must be in or near the city (Article 12.11.1°).

===Languages===
Article 8 of the Constitution states:
Interpretation of these provisions has been contentious. The Constitution itself is enrolled in both languages, and in case of conflict the Irish language version takes precedence, even though in practice the Irish text is a translation of the English rather than &quot;vice versa&quot;. The 1937 Constitution introduced some Irish-language terms into English, such as &quot;Taoiseach&quot; and &quot;Tánaiste&quot;, while others, such as &quot;Oireachtas&quot;, had been used in the Free State Constitution. The use in English of &quot;Éire&quot;, the Irish-language name of the state, is deprecated.

===Organs of government===

The Constitution establishes a government under a parliamentary system. It provides for a directly elected, largely ceremonial President of Ireland (Article 12), a head of government called the Taoiseach (Article 28), and a national parliament called the Oireachtas (Article 15). The Oireachtas has a dominant directly elected lower house known as Dáil Éireann (Article 16) and an upper house Seanad Éireann (Article 18), which is partly appointed, partly indirectly elected and partly elected by a limited electorate. There is also an independent judiciary headed by the Supreme Court (Article 34).

===National emergency===
Under Article 28.3.3° the Constitution grants the state sweeping powers &quot;in time of war or armed rebellion&quot;, which may (if so resolved by both Houses of the Oireachtas) include an armed conflict in which the state is not a direct participant. During a national emergency the Oireachtas may pass laws that would otherwise be unconstitutional, and the actions of the executive cannot be found to be &quot;ultra vires&quot; or unconstitutional provided they at least &quot;purport&quot; to be in pursuance of such a law. However, the constitutional prohibition on the death penalty (Article 15.5.2°), introduced by an amendment made in 2001, is an absolute exception to these powers.

There have been two national emergencies since 1937: an emergency declared in 1939 to cover the threat to national security posed as a consequence of World War II (although the state remained formally neutral throughout that conflict), and an emergency declared in 1976 to deal with the threat to the security of the state posed by the Provisional IRA.

===International relations===

*European Union: Under Article 29.4.6° EU law takes precedence over the Constitution if there is a conflict between the two, but only to the extent that such EU law is &quot;necessitated&quot; by Ireland&#x27;s membership. The Supreme Court has ruled that any EU Treaty that substantially alters the character of the Union must be approved by a constitutional amendment. For this reason separate provisions of Article 29 have permitted the state to ratify the Single European Act, Maastricht Treaty, Amsterdam Treaty, Nice Treaty and Treaty of Lisbon.
*International law: Under Article 29.6 international treaties to which the state is a party are not to be considered part of Ireland&#x27;s domestic law unless the Oireachtas has so provided. Under Article 29.3 it is declared that the state &quot;accepts the generally recognised principles of international law as its rule of conduct in its relations with other States&quot;, but the High Court has ruled that this provision is merely aspirational, and not enforceable.

===Individual rights===

====As enumerated under the heading &quot;Fundamental Rights&quot;====

*Equality before the law: Equality of all citizens before the law is guaranteed by Article 40.1.
*Prohibition on titles of nobility: The state may not confer titles of nobility, and no citizen may accept such a title without the permission of the Government (Article 40.2). In practice, governmental approval is usually a formality.
*Personal rights: The state is bound to protect &quot;the personal rights of the citizen&quot;, and in particular to defend &quot;the life, person, good name, and property rights of every citizen&quot; (Article 40.3).
*Unenumerated rights: The language used in Article 40.3.1° has been interpreted by the courts as implying the existence of unenumerated rights afforded to Irish citizens under natural law. Such rights upheld by the courts have included the right to marital privacy and the right of the unmarried mother to custody of her child.
*Abortion law: Pregnancy termination may be regulated by law (Article 40.3.3°). (Abortion had been prohibited by the previous Article 40.3.3°, which the Irish public repealed and replaced in a 2018 referendum.)
*Habeas corpus: The citizen&#x27;s right to personal liberty is guaranteed by Article 40.4, which section also sets out in detail the procedure for obtaining &quot;habeas corpus&quot;. However, these rights are specifically excepted from applying to the actions of the Defence Forces during a &quot;state of war or armed rebellion&quot; (Article 40.4.5°). Since the Sixteenth Amendment it has also been constitutional for a court to deny bail to someone charged with a crime where &quot;it is reasonably considered necessary&quot;, to prevent that person from committing a &quot;serious offence&quot; (Article 40.4.6°).
*Inviolability of the home: A citizen&#x27;s home may not be forcibly entered, except as permitted by law (Article 40.5).
*Freedom of speech: Subject to &quot;public order and morality&quot;, a qualified right of freedom of speech is guaranteed by Article 40.6.1°. However, &quot;the State shall endeavour to ensure that organs of public opinion&quot; (such as the news media) &quot;shall not be used to undermine public order or morality or the authority of the State&quot;. Furthermore, &quot;the publication or utterance of seditious or indecent matter&quot; is specifically stated to be a criminal offence. This also prohibited blasphemy until it was removed by referendum in 2018. In &quot;Corway v. Independent Newspapers&quot; (1999), the Supreme Court dismissed an attempt to bring a prosecution for blasphemy on the basis that, amongst other things, no coherent definition of the offence was provided by law. Such a definition was subsequently provided by the Defamation Act 2009, which defined it as the publication of matter &quot;grossly abusive or insulting in relation to matters held sacred by any religion, thereby [intentionally] causing outrage among a substantial number of the adherents of that religion&quot;. There was never a prosecution under this Act.
*Freedom of peaceful assembly: Subject to &quot;public order and morality&quot;, the right of citizens to peaceful assembly &quot;without arms&quot; is guaranteed by Article 40.6.1°. However, the Oireachtas is empowered to limit this right by law when a meeting may be &quot;calculated to cause a breach of the peace or to be a danger or nuisance to the general public&quot;; the Oireachtas is similarly empowered to limit this right in relation to meetings held &quot;in the vicinity&quot; of either House.
*Freedom of association: Subject to &quot;public order and morality&quot;, the right of citizens &quot;to form associations and unions&quot; is also guaranteed by Article 40.6.1°; however, the exercise of this right may be regulated by law &quot;in the public interest&quot;.
*Family and home life: Under Article 41.1 the state promises to &quot;protect the Family&quot;, and recognises the family as having &quot;inalienable and imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law&quot;. Under Article 41.2 the state is required to ensure that &quot;economic necessity&quot; does not oblige a mother &quot;to engage in labour to the neglect of [her] duties in the home&quot;. Article 41.3 sets out conditions that must be fulfilled before a court may grant a divorce, including that adequate financial provision has been made for both spouses and any of their children.
*Education: Article 42 guarantees parents the right to determine where their children shall be educated (including at home), provided a minimum standard is met. Under the same article the state must provide for free primary level education. Currently Irish law also guarantees free second and third level education.
*Private property: The right to own and transfer private property is guaranteed by Article 43, subject to &quot;the principles of social justice&quot;, and in accordance with laws passed reconciling the right &quot;with the exigencies of the common good&quot; (Article 43).
*Religious freedom: A citizen&#x27;s freedom of religious conscience, practice, and worship is guaranteed, &quot;subject to public order and morality&quot;, by Article 44.2.1°. The state may not &quot;endow&quot; any religion (Article 44.2.2°), nor discriminate on religious grounds (Article 44.2.3°).

====As enumerated under other headings====
*Prohibition of the death penalty: Since the enactment of the twenty-first amendment, signed into law in 2002, the Oireachtas is prohibited from enacting any law that imposes the death penalty (Article 15.5.2°); this restriction even applies during a time of war or armed rebellion (Article 28.3.3°).
*Prohibition of laws: The Oireachtas may not enact criminal laws (Article 15.5.1°).
*Due process and trial by jury: Trial for any alleged criminal offence may only be &quot;in due course of law&quot; (Article 38.1). All trials for a serious offence of a person not subject to military law must be before a jury (Article 38.5), except where &quot;special courts&quot; have been established by law because &quot;the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice, and the preservation of public peace and order&quot;, and except where military tribunals have been established by law &quot;to deal with a state of war or armed rebellion&quot;.
*Sexual discrimination: The sex of an individual cannot be a reason to deny them the right to citizenship (Article 9.1.3°), nor to deny them a vote for (or membership of) Dáil Éireann (Article 16.1).

===Directive Principles of Social Policy===
Article 45 outlines broad principles of social and economic policy. Its provisions are, however, intended solely &quot;for the general guidance of the Oireachtas&quot;, and &quot;shall not be cognisable by any Court under any of the provisions of this Constitution&quot; (preamble to Article 45).

The &quot;Directive Principles of Social Policy&quot; feature little in contemporary parliamentary debates. However, no proposals have yet been made for their repeal or amendment.

The principles require, in summary, that:
*&quot;justice and charity&quot; must &quot;inform all the institutions of the national life&quot;.
*Everyone has the right to an adequate occupation.
*The free market and private property must be regulated in the interests of the common good.
*The state must prevent a destructive concentration of essential commodities in the hands of a few.
*The state must supplement private industry where necessary.
*The state should ensure efficiency in private industry and protect the public against economic exploitation.
*The state must protect the vulnerable, such as orphans and the aged.
*No one may be forced into an occupation unsuited to their age, sex or strength.

The &quot;Directive Principles&quot; have influenced other constitutions. Notably, the famous &quot;Indian Directive Principles of State Policy&quot; contained in the Constitution of India are influenced by the Constitution of Ireland. Moreover, the previous Constitution of Nepal adopted in 1962 and in force for 28 years and commonly called &quot;Panchayat Constitution&quot; contained a verbatim translation of the &quot;Directive Principles&quot; of the Irish constitution.

===Transitory provisions===
The transitory provisions of the constitution provided for a smooth takeover from the pre-existing institutions of the Free State to those established by the new constitution. Institutions would initially be assigned to their Free State analogues where available; this applied to the Dáil, courts, government, public service, Attorney General, Comptroller and Auditor General, Defence Forces and police. For constitutional innovations — the President and Seanad — provision was made for their establishment within 180 days, and for the Oireachtas and Presidential Commission to function without them in the interim notwithstanding that they were otherwise essential.

Judges were required to swear allegiance to the new Constitution to continue in office, but other continuing public servants were not. Article 51 allowed constitutional amendments without referendum during the three years after the first President took office (Douglas Hyde did so on 25 June 1938). This was to facilitate the Oireachtas fixing any defects or oversights that quickly became obvious. The President could still demand a referendum in some cases, but the First (1939) and Second (1941) amendments were enacted under Article 51 without referendum.

The transitory provisions are mostly still in force but spent. They themselves mandate that they be omitted from all officially published texts of the Constitution: either as soon Hyde took office, or three years later in the case of Article 51. Article 51 expressly provides that it would cease to have legal effect once it was removed, but the rest remain in force, which has created subsequent inconvenience. The Second Amendment made changes to Article 56 despite the fact that it was no longer a part of the official text. The transitional continuation of the pre-1937 courts was not formally ended until the Courts (Establishment and Constitution) Act 1961, whose long title refers to &quot;Article 58 of the Constitution&quot;. A journalist commented in 1958 that the courts&#x27; status was determined by &quot;a non-existent provision of the Constitution&quot;.

Further transitory provisions have been added by subsequent constitutional amendments, and similarly omitted from officially published texts. The Nineteenth (1998) added subsections 3°, 4° and 5° to Article 29.7 to facilitate the 1999 changes to Articles 2 and 3; articles 34A and 64 were added by the Thirty-third (2013) to initialise the new Court of Appeal. The rejected 2013 proposal to abolish the Seanad included both the deletion of previous Seanad-related transitory provisions and the addition of two new abolition-related ones. The associated Referendum Commission published the full transitory provisions for the information of voters, with a disclaimer that this did not constitute an &quot;official&quot; text.

===Amendments===
Any part of the Constitution may be amended, but only by referendum.

The procedure for amendment of the Constitution is set out in Article 46. An amendment must first be passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, then be submitted to a referendum, and then finally must be signed into law by the President.

Amendments are sometimes proposed to address a new social problem or phenomenon not considered at the time of the Constitution being drafted (e.g. children&#x27;s rights, same-sex marriage), to address outmoded provisions in the Constitution (e.g. special position of the Roman Catholic Church, prohibition on abortion), or to attempt to reverse or alter an interpretation of the court through a corrective referendum (e.g. Oireachtas enquiries). Usually referendums are only proposed when there is wide political support for the proposed change.

====Enrollment of the Constitution====
Article 25.5 provides that from time to time, the Taoiseach may cause an up to date text of the Constitution to be prepared in Irish and in English, embodying all of the amendments made so far (and retaining the transitory provisions). Once this new text has been signed by the Taoiseach, the Chief Justice and the President, it is enrolled on vellum and deposited with the office of the Registrar of the Supreme Court. Once enrolled, the new text becomes conclusive evidence of the Constitution, and supersedes earlier enrolled copies. The Constitution has been enrolled six times: in 1938, 1942, 1980, 1990, 1999, and 2019.

==Judicial review of laws==
The Constitution states that it is the highest law of the land and grants the Supreme Court of Ireland authority to interpret its provisions, and to strike down the laws of the Oireachtas and activities of the Government it finds to be unconstitutional. Under judicial review the quite broad meaning of certain articles has come to be explored and expanded upon since 1937.

The Supreme Court ruled that Articles 2 and 3, before their alteration in 1999, did not impose a positive obligation upon the state that could be enforced in a court of law. The reference in Article 41 to the family&#x27;s &quot;imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law&quot; has been interpreted by the Supreme Court as conferring upon spouses a broad right to privacy in marital affairs. In &quot;McGee v. The Attorney General&quot; (1974) the court invoked this right to strike down laws banning the sale of contraceptives. The court also issued a controversial interpretation of Article 40.3.3°, which before its replacement in 2018 prohibited abortion. In &quot;Attorney General v X&quot; (1992), commonly known as the X Case, the Supreme Court ruled that the state must permit an abortion where there is a danger to her life, including a risk of suicide.

==Issues of controversy==
Writing in 1968, &quot;Irish Times&quot; literary editor Terence de Vere White criticised both the constitution and the existing political system, &quot;At the time of this writing, the Constitution of the Republic is under scrutiny, but it is unlikely that any proposed changes therein will radically alter the system established. A Constitution on the United States model might well suit the people better than the present one; but the Irish are too innately Conservative ever to bring about such a change except by gradual and almost imperceptible degrees.&quot;

===The &quot;national territory&quot;===

As adopted in 1937, Article 2 asserted that &quot;the whole island of Ireland, its islands and the territorial seas&quot; formed a single &quot;national territory&quot;, while Article 3 asserted that the Oireachtas had a right &quot;to exercise jurisdiction over the whole of that territory&quot;. These articles offended some Unionists in Northern Ireland, who considered them tantamount to an illegal extraterritorial claim.

Under the terms of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, Articles 2 and 3 were amended to remove any reference to a &quot;national territory&quot;, and to state that a united Ireland should only come about with the consent of majorities in both the jurisdictions on the island of Ireland. The amended Articles also guarantee the people of Northern Ireland the right to be a &quot;part of the Irish Nation&quot;, and to Irish citizenship. This change came into force in December 1999.

===Religion===

The Constitution guarantees freedom of worship, and forbids the state from creating an established church.

Article 44.1 as originally enacted explicitly &quot;recognised&quot; a number of Christian denominations, such as the Anglican Church of Ireland, the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, as well as &quot;the Jewish Congregations&quot;. It also recognised the &quot;special position&quot; of the Catholic Church. These provisions were removed by the Fifth Amendment in 1973 (see below). Nevertheless, the constitution still contains a number of explicit religious references, such as in the preamble, the declaration made by the President, and the remaining text of Article 44.1, which reads:

A number of ideas found in the Constitution reflect the Catholic social teachings when the original text was drafted. Such teachings informed the provisions of the (non-binding) Directive Principles of Social Policy, as well as the system of vocational panels used to elect the Senate. The Constitution also grants very broadly worded rights to the institution of the family.

The remaining religious provisions of the Constitution, including the wording of the Preamble, remain controversial and widely debated.

As originally enacted, the Constitution also included a prohibition on divorce. The ban on divorce was not removed until 1996.
*Incorporating Catholic social teaching into law was common to many predominantly Catholic countries in the 1930s. Divorce, for example, was banned in other states such as Italy, which repealed its ban in the 1970s.
*The reference to the Catholic Church&#x27;s special position was of no legal effect and there was significance in the fact that the &quot;special position&quot; of Catholicism was held to derive merely from its greater number of adherents. Notably, Éamon De Valera resisted pressure from right-wing Catholic groups such as Maria Duce to make Catholicism an established church or to declare it the &quot;one true religion&quot;.
*The prohibition on divorce was supported by senior members of the Protestant (Anglican) Church of Ireland.
*The Constitution&#x27;s explicit recognition of the Jewish community was progressive in the climate of the 1930s.

===Abortion===

The Constitution had, from 1983 to 2018, contained a prohibition of abortion. From 1992 the constitution did not prohibit the distribution of information about abortion services in other countries or the right of freedom of travel to procure an abortion. In theory, the prohibition of abortion did not apply to cases in which there was a threat to the life of the mother (including from risk of suicide), though the 2012 death of Savita Halappanavar suggested that the practical position was a total prohibition.

Article 40.3.3° was inserted into the Constitution in 1983 by the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland. The Eighth Amendment recognised &quot;the unborn&quot; as having a right to life equal to that of &quot;the mother&quot;. Accordingly, abortions could be legally conducted in Ireland only as part of a medical intervention performed to save the life of the pregnant woman, including a pregnant woman at risk of suicide. On 25 May 2018, a referendum was held asking whether the Eighth Amendment should be repealed. A majority voted to repeal, and the Eighth Amendment was subsequently repealed on 18 September 2018 via the passage of the Thirty-sixth Amendment.

===Status of women===
The Constitution guarantees women the right to vote and to nationality and citizenship on an equal basis with men. It also contains a provision, Article 41.2, which states:

A proposed amendment to this article (the Fortieth Amendment) was defeated in a referendum in March 2024.

===Head of state===

In 1949 the Irish state abandoned its few remaining constitutional ties with the British monarchy, and it was declared by an Act of the Oireachtas that the term &quot;Republic of Ireland&quot; could be used as a &quot;description&quot; for the Irish state. However, there is debate as to whether or not the state was a republic in the period 1937–1949; between these dates the state was not described in any law as a republic. The current text of the Constitution does not mention the word &quot;republic&quot;, but does for example assert that all power is derived, &quot;under God, from the people&quot; (Article 6.1).

Debate largely focuses on the question of whether, before 1949, the head of state was the President of Ireland or King George VI. The Constitution did not directly refer to the King, but also did not (and still does not) state that the President was head of state. The President exercised most of the usual internal functions of a head of state, such as formally appointing the Government, and promulgating laws.

In 1936, before the enactment of the existing Constitution, George VI had been declared &quot;By the Grace of God, of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas King, Defender of the Faith, Emperor of India&quot; and, under the External Relations Act of the same year, it was this King who formally represented the state in its foreign affairs. Treaties, for example, were signed in the name of the King, who also accredited ambassadors and received the letters of credence of foreign diplomats. Representing a state abroad is seen by many scholars as the key characteristic of a head of state. This role meant, in any case, that George VI was the Head of State in the eyes of foreign nations.

Section 3(1) of the Act stipulated that:

However, the removal of the king&#x27;s constitutional position within Ireland was brought about in 1948 not by any change to the Constitution but by ordinary law (The Republic of Ireland Act 1948). Since the Irish state was unambiguously a republic after 1949 (when the 1948 Act came into operation) and the same Constitution was in force prior to that time, some have argued that the Irish state was in reality a republic from the Constitution&#x27;s enactment in 1937.

===Name of the state===
The constitution begins with words &quot;&quot;We, the people of Éire&quot;. It then declares, in Article 4, that the name of the state is &quot;Éire&quot;, or, in the English language, &quot;Ireland&quot;&quot;. The text of the draft constitution as originally introduced into the Dáil had simply stated that the state was to be called &quot;Éire&quot;, and that term was used throughout the text of the draft constitution. However, the English text of the draft constitution was amended during the parliamentary debates to replace &quot;Éire&quot; with &quot;Ireland&quot;. (The only exceptions were the preamble, in which &quot;Éire&quot; is used alone, and Article 4, which was amended so as to refer to both &quot;Éire&quot; and the alternative English language name of &quot;Ireland&quot;.) The name of the state was the subject of a long dispute between the British and Irish governments, which has since been resolved.

===Non-traditional family units===
Article 41.1.1° of the Constitution &quot;recognises the Family as the natural primary and fundamental unit group of Society, and as a moral institution possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law&quot;, and guarantees its protection by the state. The 34th amendment in 2015 mandated recognition of same-sex marriage in Ireland. A referendum in March 2024 rejected a proposed amendment which would have deleted a claim that the family is founded on marriage and amended Article 41.1.1° so as to recognise &quot;the Family, &quot;whether founded on marriage or on other durable relationships&quot;.

A consequence of Article 41 is that non-marital family unit members are not entitled to any of the encompassed protections, including those under the realms of tax, inheritance, and social welfare, granted by Article 41. For example, in &quot;State (Nicolaou) v. An Bord Uchtála&quot; (1966), where an unmarried father, who had become estranged from the mother of his child some months after living and caring for the same child together, was prevented from invoking the provisions of Article 41 to halt the mother&#x27;s wishes of putting the child up for adoption. Supreme Court Justice Brian Walsh stated that &quot;the family referred to in [Article 41 was] the family which is founded on the institution of marriage&quot;.

=== Economic and social rights ===
Recent polls suggest that more than 70 percent of the Irish public believe that the Irish Constitution should be amended to protect human rights like the right to health and social security.

In February 2014, the Convention on the Irish Constitution (2014) voted to constitutionalise rights to health, housing, and adequate living standards. Successive Irish governments, however, have thus far not acted upon its recommendations to constitutionalise new economic and social rights.

Civil society groups have articulated and mobilised for socio-economic rights in response to the state&#x27;s handling of the 2008 crisis, particularly its nationalising of private banking debts and imposition of austerity. The Right2Water campaign (2015) mobilised tens of thousands of people in support of the constitutional recognition of a right to water, as well as rights to decent work, health, housing, education, debt justice, and democratic reform. Civil society organisations continue to call for a constitutional right to housing to address homelessness.

==Discrepancies between the Irish and English texts==
A number of discrepancies have been identified between the Irish language and English language texts of the Constitution. According to Article 25.5.4° the Irish text prevails in such cases. The second amendment resolved some of these in 1941 with changes to the Irish language texts of Articles 11, 13, 15, 18, 20, 28 and 34 which had no corresponding change to the English language text.

Perhaps the most significant remaining discrepancy between the two texts of the Constitution is to be found in the subsection stipulating the minimum age for a candidate to be eligible for election as President (Art. 12.4.1°). According to the English text, an eligible candidate &quot;has reached his thirty-fifth year of age&quot;, whereas the Irish text has this as &quot;&quot; (&quot;has completed his thirty-five years&quot;).

A person&#x27;s first year begins when they are born and ends the day before their first birthday. A first birthday is the beginning of their second year. Accordingly, the thirty-fifth year of age is reached on a person&#x27;s thirty-fourth birthday. In contrast a person has completed their first year on their first birthday and their thirty-fifth year on their thirty-fifth birthday. This can be contrasted with Article 16.1.2˚ regarding the entitlement to vote for Dáil Éireann which states this as those &quot;who have reached the age of eighteen years&quot;.

==Constitutional reviews==
The Constitution has been subjected to a series of formal reviews.

;1966: The then Taoiseach, Seán Lemass, encouraged the establishment of an informal Oireachtas committee, which undertook a general review of the Constitution and issued a report in 1967.

;1968: A draft report was produced by a legal committee, chaired by the Attorney General Colm Condon. No final report was published.

;1972: The Inter-Party Committee on the Implications of Irish Unity addressed constitutional issues in relation to Northern Ireland. Its work was continued by the 1973 All-Party Oireachtas Committee on Irish Relations and later by the 1982 Constitution Review Body, a group of legal experts under the chairmanship of the Attorney General. Neither of the 1972 groups published a report.

;1983–1984: The New Ireland Forum was established in 1983, and its report in 1984 covered some constitutional issues.

;1988: The Progressive Democrats published a review entitled &quot;Constitution for a New Republic&quot;.

;1994–1997: In October 1994, the government established a Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, which considered some constitutional issues relating to Northern Ireland. The Forum suspended its work in February 1996 but met once more in December 1997.

; 1995–1996: The Constitution Review Group was an expert group established by the government in 1995, and chaired by Dr T.K. Whitaker. Its 700-page report, published in July 1996, was described as &quot;the most thorough analysis of the Constitution from the legal, political science, administrative, social and economic perspectives ever made&quot;.

;1996–2007: The All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution was set up in 1996, running in three stages until it completed its work in 2007.

;2012–2014: A Constitutional Convention composed both of citizen members and elected representatives examined a number of specific measures and proposed their amendment

===All-Party Oireachtas Committee===
The All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution was established in 1996.

====First committee====
The First All-Party Committee (1996–1997), chaired by Fine Gael TD Jim O&#x27;Keeffe, published two progress reports in 1997:

*&quot;1st Progress Report&quot;, 1997
*&quot;2nd Progress Report&quot;, 1997

====Second committee====
The Second All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution (1997–2002) was chaired by Fianna Fáil TD Brian Lenihan. It published five progress reports:

*&quot;3rd Progress Report: The President&quot;, 1998
*&quot;4th Progress Report: the courts and judiciary&quot;, 1999
*&quot;5th Progress Report: abortion&quot;, 2000
*&quot;6th Progress Report: the referendum&quot;, 2001
*&quot;7th Progress Report: Parliament&quot;, 2002

The second committee also published two commissioned works:
*&quot;A new electoral system for Ireland?&quot;, by Michael Laver (1998)
*&quot;Bunreacht na hÉireann: a study of the Irish text&quot;, by Micheál Ó Cearúil (1999)

====Third committee====
The Third All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution (2002–2007) was chaired by Fianna Fáil TD Denis O&#x27;Donovan. It described its task as being to &quot;complete the programme of constitutional amendments begun by the earlier committees, aimed at renewing the Constitution in all its parts, for implementation over a number of years&quot;. It described the job as &quot;unprecedented&quot;, noting that &quot;no other state with the referendum as its sole mechanism for constitutional change has set itself so ambitious an objective&quot;.

The committee divided its work into considering three types of amendment:
*technical/editorial: changes in form but not in substance, for example changing &quot;he&quot; to &quot;he or she&quot; where it is clear that a provision in the Constitution applies to both men and women.
*non-contentious: changes in substance generally agreeable to the people, for example describing the President as Head of State.
*contentious: changes in substance which of their nature divide people, for example changes in the character and scope of human rights.

The Third All-Party Committee published three reports:

*&quot;8th Progress Report: Government, 2003&quot;
*&quot;9th Progress Report: Private Property, 2004&quot;
*&quot;10th Progress Report: The Family&quot;, 2006

<doc id="152518" wikidata="Q657482" url="?curid=152518" title="Abel–Ruffini theorem">
<text>In mathematics, the Abel–Ruffini theorem (also known as Abel&#x27;s impossibility theorem) states that there is no solution in radicals to general polynomial equations of degree five or higher with arbitrary coefficients. Here, &quot;general&quot; means that the coefficients of the equation are viewed and manipulated as indeterminates.

The theorem is named after Paolo Ruffini, who made an incomplete proof in 1799 (which was refined and completed in 1813 and accepted by Cauchy) and Niels Henrik Abel, who provided a proof in 1824.

&quot;Abel–Ruffini theorem&quot; refers also to the slightly stronger result that there are equations of degree five and higher that cannot be solved by radicals. This does not follow from Abel&#x27;s statement of the theorem, but is a corollary of his proof, as his proof is based on the fact that some polynomials in the coefficients of the equation are not the zero polynomial. This improved statement follows directly from . Galois theory implies also that 
:formula_1
is the simplest equation that cannot be solved in radicals, and that &quot;almost all&quot; polynomials of degree five or higher cannot be solved in radicals.

The impossibility of solving in degree five or higher contrasts with the case of lower degree: one has the quadratic formula, the cubic formula, and the quartic formula for degrees two, three, and four, respectively.

==Context==
Polynomial equations of degree two can be solved with the quadratic formula, which has been known since antiquity. Similarly the cubic formula for degree three, and the quartic formula for degree four, were found during the 16th century. At that time a fundamental problem was whether equations of higher degree could be solved in a similar way.

The fact that every polynomial equation of positive degree has solutions, possibly non-real, was asserted during the 17th century, but completely proved only at the beginning of the 19th century. This is the fundamental theorem of algebra, which does not provide any tool for computing the solutions, although several methods are known for approximating all solutions to any desired accuracy.

From the 16th century to beginning of the 19th century, the main problem of algebra was to search for a formula for the solutions of polynomial equations of degree five and higher, hence the name the &quot;fundamental theorem of algebra&quot;. This meant a solution in radicals, that is, an expression involving only the coefficients of the equation, and the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and th root extraction.

The Abel–Ruffini theorem proves that this is impossible. However, this impossibility does not imply that a specific equation of any degree cannot be solved in radicals. On the contrary, there are equations of any degree that can be solved in radicals. This is the case of the equation formula_2 for any , and the equations defined by cyclotomic polynomials, all of whose solutions can be expressed in radicals.

Abel&#x27;s proof of the theorem does not explicitly contain the assertion that there are specific equations that cannot be solved by radicals. Such an assertion is not a consequence of Abel&#x27;s statement of the theorem, as the statement does not exclude the possibility that &quot;every particular quintic equation might be soluble, with a special formula for each equation.&quot; However, the existence of specific equations that cannot be solved in radicals seems to be a consequence of Abel&#x27;s proof, as the proof uses the fact that some polynomials in the coefficients are not the zero polynomial, and, given a finite number of polynomials, there are values of the variables at which none of the polynomials takes the value zero.

Soon after Abel&#x27;s publication of its proof, Évariste Galois introduced a theory, now called Galois theory that allows deciding, for any given equation, whether it is solvable in radicals. This was purely theoretical before the rise of electronic computers. With modern computers and programs, deciding whether a polynomial is solvable by radicals can be done for polynomials of degree greater than 100. Computing the solutions in radicals of solvable polynomials requires huge computations. Even for the degree five, the expression of the solutions is so huge that it has no practical interest.

==Proof==
The proof of the Abel–Ruffini theorem predates Galois theory. However, Galois theory allows a better understanding of the subject, and modern proofs are generally based on it, while the original proofs of the Abel–Ruffini theorem are still presented for historical purposes.

The proofs based on Galois theory comprise four main steps: the characterization of solvable equations in terms of field theory; the use of the Galois correspondence between subfields of a given field and the subgroups of its Galois group for expressing this characterization in terms of solvable groups; the proof that the symmetric group is not solvable if its degree is five or higher; and the existence of polynomials with a symmetric Galois group.

===Algebraic solutions and field theory===
An algebraic solution of a polynomial equation is an expression involving the four basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), and root extractions. Such an expression may be viewed as the description of a computation that starts from the coefficients of the equation to be solved and proceeds by computing some numbers, one after the other.

At each step of the computation, one may consider the smallest field that contains all numbers that have been computed so far. This field is changed only for the steps involving the computation of an th root.

So, an algebraic solution produces a sequence
:formula_3
of fields, and elements formula_4 such that 
formula_5 for formula_6 with formula_7 for some integer formula_8 An algebraic solution of the initial polynomial equation exists if and only if there exists such a sequence of fields such that formula_9 contains a solution.

For having normal extensions, which are fundamental for the theory, one must refine the sequence of fields as follows. If formula_10 does not contain all formula_11-th roots of unity, one introduces the field formula_12 that extends formula_10 by a primitive root of unity, and one redefines formula_14 as formula_15

So, if one starts from a solution in terms of radicals, one gets an increasing sequence of fields such that the last one contains the solution, and each is a normal extension of the preceding one with a Galois group that is cyclic.

Conversely, if one has such a sequence of fields, the equation is solvable in terms of radicals. For proving this, it suffices to prove that a normal extension with a cyclic Galois group can be built from a succession of radical extensions.

===Galois correspondence===
The Galois correspondence establishes a one to one correspondence between the subextensions of a normal field extension formula_16 and the subgroups of the Galois group of the extension. This correspondence maps a field such formula_17 to the Galois group formula_18 of the automorphisms of that leave fixed, and, conversely, maps a subgroup of formula_19 to the field of the elements of that are fixed by .

The preceding section shows that an equation is solvable in terms of radicals if and only if the Galois group of its splitting field (the smallest field that contains all the roots) is solvable, that is, it contains a sequence of subgroups such that each is normal in the preceding one, with a quotient group that is cyclic. (Solvable groups are commonly defined with abelian instead of cyclic quotient groups, but the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups shows that the two definitions are equivalent).

So, for proving the Abel–Ruffini theorem, it remains to show that the symmetric group formula_20 is not solvable, and that there are polynomials with symmetric Galois groups.

===Solvable symmetric groups===
For , the symmetric group formula_21 of degree has only the alternating group formula_22 as a nontrivial normal subgroup (see ). For , the alternating group formula_22 is simple (that is, it does not have any nontrivial normal subgroup) and not abelian. This implies that both formula_22 and formula_21 are not solvable for . Thus, the Abel–Ruffini theorem results from the existence of polynomials with a symmetric Galois group; this will be shown in the next section.

On the other hand, for , the symmetric group and all its subgroups are solvable. This explains the existence of the quadratic, cubic, and quartic formulas, since a major result of Galois theory is that a polynomial equation has a solution in radicals if and only if its Galois group is solvable (the term &quot;solvable group&quot; takes its origin from this theorem).

===Polynomials with symmetric Galois groups===
====General equation====
The &quot;general&quot; or &quot;generic&quot; polynomial equation of degree is the equation
:formula_26
where formula_27 are distinct indeterminates. This is an equation defined over the field formula_28 of the rational fractions in formula_27 with rational number coefficients. The original Abel–Ruffini theorem asserts that, for , this equation is not solvable in radicals. In view of the preceding sections, this results from the fact that the Galois group over of the equation is the symmetric group formula_21 (this Galois group is the group of the field automorphisms of the splitting field of the equation that fix the elements of , where the splitting field is the smallest field containing all the roots of the equation).

For proving that the Galois group is formula_31 it is simpler to start from the roots. Let formula_32 be new indeterminates, aimed to be the roots, and consider the polynomial
:formula_33
Let formula_34 be the field of the rational fractions in formula_35 and formula_36 be its subfield generated by the coefficients of formula_37 The permutations of the formula_38 induce automorphisms of . Vieta&#x27;s formulas imply that every element of is a symmetric function of the formula_39 and is thus fixed by all these automorphisms. It follows that the Galois group formula_40 is the symmetric group formula_41

The fundamental theorem of symmetric polynomials implies that the formula_42 are algebraic independent, and thus that the map that sends each formula_43 to the corresponding formula_42 is a field isomorphism from to . This means that one may consider formula_45 as a generic equation. This finishes the proof that the Galois group of a general equation is the symmetric group, and thus proves the original Abel–Ruffini theorem, which asserts that the general polynomial equation of degree cannot be solved in radicals for .

====Explicit example====
The equation formula_1 is not solvable in radicals, as will be explained below.

Let be formula_47.
Let be its Galois group, which acts faithfully on the set of complex roots of .
Numbering the roots lets one identify with a subgroup of the symmetric group formula_48.
Since formula_49 factors as formula_50 in formula_51, the group contains a permutation formula_52 that is a product of disjoint cycles of lengths 2 and 3 (in general, when a monic integer polynomial reduces modulo a prime to a product of distinct monic irreducible polynomials, the degrees of the factors give the lengths of the disjoint cycles in some permutation belonging to the Galois group); then also contains formula_53, which is a transposition. Since formula_54 is irreducible in formula_55, the same principle shows that contains a 5-cycle. Because 5 is prime, any transposition and 5-cycle in formula_48 generate the whole group; see . Thus formula_57. Since the group formula_48 is not solvable, the equation formula_1 is not solvable in radicals.

==Cayley&#x27;s resolvent==
Testing whether a specific quintic is solvable in radicals can be done by using Cayley&#x27;s resolvent. This is a univariate polynomial of degree six whose coefficients are polynomials in the coefficients of a generic quintic. A specific irreducible quintic is solvable in radicals if and only, when its coefficients are substituted in Cayley&#x27;s resolvent, the resulting sextic polynomial has a rational root.

==History==
Around 1770, Joseph Louis Lagrange began the groundwork that unified the many different methods that had been used up to that point to solve equations, relating them to the theory of groups of permutations, in the form of Lagrange resolvents. This innovative work by Lagrange was a precursor to Galois theory, and its failure to develop solutions for equations of fifth and higher degrees hinted that such solutions might be impossible, but it did not provide conclusive proof. The first person who conjectured that the problem of solving quintics by radicals might be impossible to solve was Carl Friedrich Gauss, who wrote in 1798 in section 359 of his book &quot;Disquisitiones Arithmeticae&quot; (which would be published only in 1801) that &quot;there is little doubt that this problem does not so much defy modern methods of analysis as that it proposes the impossible&quot;. The next year, in his thesis, he wrote &quot;After the labors of many geometers left little hope of ever arriving at the resolution of the general equation algebraically, it appears more and more likely that this resolution is impossible and contradictory.&quot; And he added &quot;Perhaps it will not be so difficult to prove, with all rigor, the impossibility for the fifth degree. I shall set forth my investigations of this at greater length in another place.&quot; Actually, Gauss published nothing else on this subject.
The theorem was first nearly proved by Paolo Ruffini in 1799. He sent his proof to several mathematicians to get it acknowledged, amongst them Lagrange (who did not reply) and Augustin-Louis Cauchy, who sent him a letter saying: &quot;Your memoir on the general solution of equations is a work which I have always believed should be kept in mind by mathematicians and which, in my opinion, proves conclusively the algebraic unsolvability of general equations of higher than fourth degree.&quot; However, in general, Ruffini&#x27;s proof was not considered convincing. Abel wrote: &quot;The first and, if I am not mistaken, the only one who, before me, has sought to prove the impossibility of the algebraic solution of general equations is the mathematician Ruffini. But his memoir is so complicated that it is very difficult to determine the validity of his argument. It seems to me that his argument is not completely satisfying.&quot;

The proof also, as it was discovered later, was incomplete. Ruffini assumed that all radicals that he was dealing with could be expressed from the roots of the polynomial using field operations alone; in modern terms, he assumed that the radicals belonged to the splitting field of the polynomial. To see why this is really an extra assumption, consider, for instance, the polynomial formula_60. According to Cardano&#x27;s formula, one of its roots (all of them, actually) can be expressed as the sum of a cube root of formula_61 with a cube root of formula_62. On the other hand, since formula_63, formula_64, formula_65, and formula_66, the roots formula_67, formula_68, and formula_69 of formula_70 are all real and therefore the field formula_71 is a subfield of formula_72. But then the numbers formula_73 cannot belong to formula_71. While Cauchy either did not notice Ruffini&#x27;s assumption or felt that it was a minor one, most historians believe that the proof was not complete until Abel proved the theorem on natural irrationalities, which asserts that the assumption holds in the case of general polynomials. 
The Abel–Ruffini theorem is thus generally credited to Abel, who published a proof compressed into just six pages in 1824. (Abel adopted a very terse style to save paper and money: the proof was printed at his own expense.) A more elaborated version of the proof would be published in 1826.

Proving that the general quintic (and higher) equations were unsolvable by radicals did not completely settle the matter, because the Abel–Ruffini theorem does not provide necessary and sufficient conditions for saying precisely which quintic (and higher) equations are unsolvable by radicals. Abel was working on a complete characterization when he died in 1829.

According to Nathan Jacobson, &quot;The proofs of Ruffini and of Abel [...] were soon superseded by the crowning achievement of this line of research: Galois&#x27; discoveries in the theory of equations.&quot; In 1830, Galois (at the age of 18) submitted to the Paris Academy of Sciences a memoir on his theory of solvability by radicals, which was ultimately rejected in 1831 as being too sketchy and for giving a condition in terms of the roots of the equation instead of its coefficients. Galois was aware of the contributions of Ruffini and Abel, since he wrote &quot;It is a common truth, today, that the general equation of degree greater than cannot be solved by radicals... this truth has become common (by hearsay) despite the fact that geometers have ignored the proofs of Abel and Ruffini...&quot; Galois then died in 1832 and his paper &quot;Mémoire sur les conditions de resolubilité des équations par radicaux&quot; remained unpublished until 1846, when it was published by Joseph Liouville accompanied by some of his own explanations. Prior to this publication, Liouville announced Galois&#x27; result to the academy in a speech he gave on 4 July 1843. A simplification of Abel&#x27;s proof was published by Pierre Wantzel in 1845. When Wantzel published it, he was already aware of the contributions by Galois and he mentions that, whereas Abel&#x27;s proof is valid only for general polynomials, Galois&#x27; approach can be used to provide a concrete polynomial of degree 5 whose roots cannot be expressed in radicals from its coefficients.

In 1963, Vladimir Arnold discovered a topological proof of the Abel–Ruffini theorem, which served as a starting point for topological Galois theory.

<doc id="152528" wikidata="Q5027796" url="?curid=152528" title="Campaign for Homosexual Law Reform">
<text>The Campaign for Homosexual Law Reform was an organisation set up to campaign for the decriminalisation of homosexuality in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland in the 1970s. Its most prominent leader was David Norris, an English studies lecturer in Trinity College Dublin, Joycean scholar and from the 1980s to the present a member of Seanad Éireann.

==History==
While serving as a lecturer at Trinity College, Norris and a group of other students informally established the Sexual Liberation Movement in 1974. It was short-lived, but two of the splinter organizations formed on campus were the Dublin University Gay Society, the first long-term LGBT rights organization in Ireland, and a group of law students known as the Campaign for Homosexual Law Reform.

Its first legal advisor was Mary McAleese, Reid Professor of Law at Trinity College Dublin, future President of Ireland; she served as legal advisor from 1975 to 1979, when she left her professorial position to join RTÉ. She was succeeded in that role in the 1980s by Mary Robinson, a former Reid Professor of Law and then-Trinity College Senator, who later became the first female President of Ireland.

Norris took a case to the Irish High Court in 1980 seeking a declaration that the laws of 1861 and 1885 which criminalised homosexual conduct were not in force since the enactment of the Constitution of Ireland. Article 50 of the Constitution provides that laws enacted before the Constitution that are inconsistent with it would no longer be in force. The case (Norris v. Attorney General) was lost on legal grounds and the decision was upheld on appeal to the Supreme Court of Ireland which referred in its judgment to Christian moral teaching and the needs of society.

Norris then took a case in 1983 to the European Court of Human Rights claiming that the Irish laws breached the state&#x27;s obligations under Article 8 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, regarding respect for private life (Norris v. Ireland). In a 1988 ruling, the court found that the Irish laws were in breach of the convention and directed the state to pay costs to Norris.

No reform action was taken by the then government of Taoiseach Charles Haughey. When Albert Reynolds succeeded as Taoiseach in 1992, he declared that it was low on his list of priorities. However, in his subsequent coalition Fianna Fáil/Labour Party government, as a result of pressure from the Labour Party the laws were reformed by the Minister for Justice, Máire Geoghegan-Quinn in 1993. She was noted for insisting that an equal age of consent be provided for homosexuals and heterosexuals alike.

<text>Athaulf (also &quot;Athavulf&quot;, &quot;Atawulf&quot;, or &quot;Ataulf&quot; and &quot;Adolf&quot;, Latinized as &quot;Ataulphus&quot;) ( 37015 August 415) was king of the Visigoths from 411 to 415. During his reign, he transformed the Visigothic state from a tribal kingdom to a major political power of late antiquity.

==Life==
He was unanimously elected to the throne to succeed his brother-in-law Alaric, who had been struck down by a fever suddenly in Calabria. King Athaulf&#x27;s first act was to halt Alaric&#x27;s southward expansion of the Goths in Italy.

Meanwhile, Gaul had been separated from the Western Roman Empire by the usurper Constantine III. So in 411 Constantius, the &quot;magister militum&quot; (master of military) of the western emperor, Flavius Augustus Honorius, with Gothic auxiliaries under Ulfilas, crushed the Gallic rebellion with a siege of Arles. There Constantine and his son were offered an honorable capitulation— but were beheaded in September on their way to pay homage to Honorius at Ravenna.

In the spring of 412 Constantius pressed Athaulf. Taking the advice of Priscus Attalus—the former emperor whom Alaric had set up at Rome in opposition to Honorius at Ravenna, and who had remained with the Visigoths after he&#x27;d been deposed—Athaulf led his followers out of Italy. Moving north into a momentarily pacified Gaul, the Visigoths lived off the countryside in the usual way. Athaulf may have received some additional encouragement in the form of payments in gold from the Emperor Honorius—since Athaulf carried with him as a respected hostage the emperor&#x27;s half-sister Galla Placidia, who had long been his captive.

Once in Gaul, Athaulf opened negotiations with a new usurper, the Gallic Jovinus. But while on his way to meet Jovinus, Athaulf came across Sarus and some of his men. Athaulf attacked, captured, and later executed Sarus, continuing the feud between their families that had begun with Sarus and Alaric. Jovinus then named his brother Sebastianus (Sebastian) as Augustus (co-emperor). This offended Athaulf, who hadn&#x27;t been consulted. So he allied his Visigoths with Honorius. Jovinus&#x27; troops were defeated in battle, Sebastianus was captured, and Jovinus fled for his life. Athaulf then turned Sebastianus over for execution to Honorius&#x27; Gallic praetorian prefect (provincial governor), Claudius Postumus Dardanus. After this, Athaulf besieged and captured Jovinus at Valentia (Valence) in 413, sending him to Narbo (Narbonne), where he was executed by Dardanus.

The heads of Sebastianus and Jovinus arrived at Honorius&#x27; court in Ravenna in late August, to be sent forward for displaying among other usurpers on the walls of Carthage. Despite coming to terms with Honorius, their relationship soon deteriorated due to a new conflict caused by the War of Heraclianus in Africa. Heraclianus stopped the grain shipments from Africa, which prevented the emperor from delivering on his promise to provide the Visigoths in Gaul. Athaulf, in turn, refused to release Galla Placidia and his army resumed their hostilities against the Romans, taking the cities of Narbonne, Tolosa and Burdígala (present-day Bordeaux). In an attempt to conquer the city of Marseille, Ataulf was injured in a Roman attack led by Bonifatius. 

Nevertheless the relations between Athaulf and Honorius improved sufficiently for Athaulf to cement them by marrying Galla Placidia at Narbo in January 414, but Jordanes says he married her in Italy, at Forlì (Forum Livii). The nuptials were celebrated with high Roman festivities and magnificent gifts from the Gothic booty. Priscus Attalus gave the wedding speech, a classical epithalamium.

Under Athaulf&#x27;s rule, the Visigoths couldn&#x27;t be said to be masters of a settled kingdom until Athaulf took possession of Narbonne and Toulouse in 413. Although Athaulf remained an Arian Christian, his relationship with Roman culture was summed up, from a Catholic Roman perspective, by the words that the contemporary Christian apologist Orosius put into his mouth, Athaulf&#x27;s Declaration:

:&quot;At first I wanted to erase the Roman name and convert all Roman territory into a Gothic empire: I longed for Romania to become Gothia, and Athaulf to be what Caesar Augustus had been. But long experience has taught me that the ungoverned wildness of the Goths will never submit to laws, and that without law a state is not a state. Therefore I have more prudently chosen the different glory of reviving the Roman name with Gothic vigour, and I hope to be acknowledged by posterity as the initiator of a Roman restoration, since it is impossible for me to alter the character of this Empire&quot; 

Honorius&#x27;s general Constantius (who would later become Emperor Constantius III), poisoned official relations with Athaulf and gained permission to blockade the Mediterranean ports of Gaul. In reply, Athaulf acclaimed Priscus Attalus as Augustus in Bordeaux in 414. But Constantius&#x27; naval blockade was successful and, in 415, Athaulf withdrew with his people into northern Hispania. Attalus fled, fell into the hands of Constantius, and was banished to the island of Lipari.

Galla Placidia traveled with Athaulf. Their son, Theodosius, died in infancy and was buried in Hispania in a silver-plated coffin, thus eliminating an opportunity for a Romano-Visigothic line.

==Death and aftermath==
In Hispania, Athaulf imprudently accepted into his service one of the late Sarus&#x27; followers, unaware that the man harbored a secret desire to avenge the death of his beloved patron. And so, in the palace at Barcelona, the man brought Athaulf&#x27;s reign to a sudden end by killing him while he bathed.

Sigeric, the brother of Sarus, immediately became king—for a mere seven days, when he was also murdered and succeeded by Wallia. Under the latter&#x27;s reign, Galla Placidia was returned to Ravenna where, in 417, at the urging of Honorius, she remarried, her new husband being the implacable enemy of the Goths, Constantius.

The main sources for the career of Athaulf are Paulus Orosius, the chronicles of the Gallaecian bishop Hydatius, and those of Augustine&#x27;s disciple, Prosper of Aquitaine.

==Declaration==
The authenticity of Athaulf&#x27;s declaration at Narbonne, as Orosius reported it in a rhetorical history that was explicitly written &quot;against pagans&quot; (it was completed in 417/18) has been doubted. Antonio Marchetta concludes that the words are indeed Athaulf&#x27;s and distinguishes them from their interpretation by Orosius, who was preparing his readers for a conclusion that Christian times were felicitous and who attributed Athaulf&#x27;s apparent change of heart to the power of his love for Galla Placidia, the instrument of divine intervention in God&#x27;s plan for an eternal Roman Empire. Marchetta finds the marriage instead an act of hard-headed politics.

<doc id="152534" wikidata="Q22702" url="?curid=152534" title="Book burning">
<text>Book burning is the deliberate destruction by fire of books or other written materials, usually carried out in a public context. The burning of books represents an element of censorship and usually proceeds from a cultural, religious, or political opposition to the materials in question. Book burning can be an act of contempt for the book&#x27;s contents or author, intended to draw wider public attention to this opposition, or conceal the information contained in the text from being made public, such as diaries or ledgers. Burning and other methods of destruction are together known as biblioclasm or libricide.

In some cases, the destroyed works are irreplaceable and their burning constitutes a severe loss to cultural heritage. Examples include the burning of books and burying of scholars under China&#x27;s Qin dynasty (213–210 BCE), the destruction of the House of Wisdom during the Mongol siege of Baghdad (1258), the destruction of Aztec codices by Itzcoatl (1430s), the burning of Maya codices on the order of bishop Diego de Landa (1562), and the burning of Jaffna Public Library in Sri Lanka (1981).

In other cases, such as the Nazi book burnings, copies of the destroyed books survive, but the instance of book burning becomes emblematic of a harsh and oppressive regime which is seeking to censor or silence some aspect of prevailing culture.

In modern times, other forms of media, such as phonograph records, video tapes, and CDs have also been burned, shredded, or crushed. Art destruction is related to book burning, both because it might have similar cultural, religious, or political connotations, and because in various historical cases, books and artworks were destroyed at the same time.

When the burning is widespread and systematic, destruction of books and media can become a significant component of cultural genocide.

==Historical background==

The burning of books has a long history of being a tool utilized by authorities both secular and religious, in their efforts to suppress dissenting or heretical views that are believed to pose a threat to the prevailing order.

Books infested with bookworms were sometimes burned in the Medieval era as a rudimentary form of pest control, rather than targeted censorship.

=== Hebrew Bible (7th century BCE) ===
According to the Hebrew Bible, in the 7th century BCE, King Jehoiakim of Judah burned part of a scroll that Baruch ben Neriah had written at prophet Jeremiah&#x27;s dictation (see Jeremiah 36).

=== Burning of books and burying of scholars in China (213–210 BCE) ===
In 213 BCE Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of the Qin dynasty, ordered the burning of books and burying of scholars and in 210 BCE he supposedly ordered the premature burial of 460 Confucian scholars in order to stay on his throne. Though the burning of books is well established, the live burial of scholars has been disputed by modern historians who doubt the details of the story, which first appeared more than a century later in the Han dynasty official Sima Qian&#x27;s &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;. Some of these books were written in Shang Xiang, a superior school founded in 2208 BCE. The event caused the loss of many philosophical treatises of the Hundred Schools of Thought. Treatises which advocated the official philosophy of the government (&quot;legalism&quot;) survived.

=== Christian book burnings (80–1759 CE) ===
In the New Testament&#x27;s Acts of the Apostles, it is claimed that Paul performed an exorcism in Ephesus. After men in Ephesus failed to perform the same feat many gave up their &quot;curious arts&quot; and burned the books because apparently, they did not work.
And many that believed, came and confessed and shewed their deeds. Many of them also which used curious arts, brought their books together, and burned them before all men: and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.
After the First Council of Nicea (325 CE), Roman emperor Constantine the Great issued an edict against nontrinitarian Arians which included a prescription for systematic book-burning: &quot;In addition, if any writing composed by Arius should be found, it should be handed over to the flames, so that not only will the wickedness of his teaching be obliterated, but nothing will be left even to remind anyone of him. And I hereby make a public order, that if someone should be discovered to have hidden a writing composed by Arius, and not to have immediately brought it forward and destroyed it by fire, his penalty shall be death. As soon as he is discovered in this offense, he shall be submitted for capital punishment...&quot; According to Elaine Pagels, &quot;In AD 367, Athanasius, the zealous bishop of Alexandria... issued an Easter letter in which he demanded that Egyptian monks destroy all such unacceptable writings, except for those he specifically listed as &#x27;acceptable&#x27; even &#x27;canonical&#x27;—a list that constitutes the present &#x27;New Testament&#x27;&quot;. (Pagels cites Athanasius&#x27;s Paschal letter (letter 39) for 367 CE, which prescribes a canon, but her citation &quot;cleanse the church from every defilement&quot; (page 177) does not explicitly appear in the Festal letter.) 
Heretical texts do not turn up as palimpsests, scraped clean and overwritten, as do many texts of Classical antiquity. According to author Rebecca Knuth, multitudes of early Christian texts have been as thoroughly &quot;destroyed&quot; as if they had been publicly burnt.

In 1759 Pope Clement XIII banned all publications written by Swedish biologist Carl Linnaeus from the Vatican, and ordered that all copies of his work be burned.

=== Burning of Nestorian books (435 CE) ===
Activity by Cyril of Alexandria ( 376–444) brought fire to almost all the writings of Nestorius (386–450) shortly after 435. &#x27;The writings of Nestorius were originally very numerous&#x27;, however, they were not part of the Nestorian or Oriental theological curriculum until the mid-sixth century, unlike those of his teacher Theodore of Mopsuestia, and those of Diodorus of Tarsus, even then they were not key texts, so relatively few survive intact, cf. Baum, Wilhelm and Dietmar W. Winkler. 2003. The Church of the East: A Concise History. London: Routledge.

=== Burning of Arian books (587 CE) ===

According to the Chronicle of Fredegar, Recared, King of the Visigoths (reigned 586–601) and first Catholic king of Spain, following his conversion to Catholicism in 587, ordered that all Arian books should be collected and burned; and all the books of Arian theology were reduced to ashes, along with the house in which they had been purposely collected. Which facts demonstrate that Constantine&#x27;s edict on Arian works was not rigorously observed, as Arian writings or the theology based on them survived to be burned much later in Spain.

=== French burning of Jewish manuscripts (1244 CE) ===

In 1244, as an outcome of the Disputation of Paris, twenty-four carriage loads of Talmuds and other Jewish religious manuscripts were set on fire by French law officers in the streets of Paris.

=== Spanish burning of Aztec and Mayan manuscripts (1560s CE) ===

During the Spanish colonization of the Americas, numerous books written by indigenous peoples were burned by the Spaniards. Several books written by the Aztecs were burnt by Spanish conquistadors and priests during the Spanish conquest of Yucatán. Despite opposition from Catholic friar Bartolomé de las Casas, numerous books found by the Spanish in Yucatán were burnt on the order of Bishop Diego de Landa in 1562. De Landa wrote on the incident that &quot;We found a large number of books in these characters and, as they contained nothing in which were not to be seen as superstition and lies of the devil, we burned them all, which they (the Maya) regretted to an amazing degree, and which caused them much affliction&quot;.

=== Book burnings in Tudor and Stuart England (16th century CE)===

The founding of the Church of England after King Henry VIII broke away from the Catholic Church led to the targeting of English Catholics by Protestants. During the Tudor and Stuart periods, Protestant citizens loyal to the Crown attacked Catholic religious sites across England, frequently burning any religious texts they found. These acts were encouraged by the Crown, who pressured the general public to take part in such &quot;spectacles&quot;. According to American historian David Cressy, over &quot;the course of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries book burning developed from a rare to an occasional occurrence, relocated from an outdoor to an indoor procedure, and changed from a bureaucratic to a quasi-theatrical performance&quot;.

With the Bishops&#x27; Ban of 1599 the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of London ordered an end to the production of verse satire and the confiscation and the burning of specific extant works, including works by John Marston and Thomas Middleton. Nine books were specifically singled out for destruction. Scholars disagree about what properties these nine books have in common to cause official offence.

=== Burning of Voltaire&#x27;s books (18th century CE) ===

During the 18th century, the works of French philosopher and writer Voltaire were repeatedly burned by government officials in the kingdoms of France and Prussia. In 1734, the publication of his &quot;Lettres philosophiques&quot; in the city of Rouen led to a public outcry, as it was seen as an attack against the &quot;ancien régime&quot; of France. In response, the French authorities ordered copies of book to be publicly confiscated and burnt, and Voltaire was forced to flee Paris. In 1751, King of Prussia Frederick the Great ordered a pamphlet written by Voltaire titled &quot;Doctor Akakia&quot; to be publicly burnt as it insulted Pierre Louis Maupertuis, the president of the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin, of whom Frederick was a significant patron.

=== Burning of abolitionist books in the American South (1859–60 CE) ===

Following John Brown&#x27;s raid on Harpers Ferry in 1859, slaveholders and their supporters spread panic about abolitionism, believing that anti-slavery conspiracies would lead to widespread slave revolts. Pro-slavery southerners burned books in Mississippi, South Carolina, and Texas, including textbooks from public schools. Books that were critical of slavery, or insufficiently supportive of it, were seen as &quot;anti-Southern&quot; by the book-burners.

=== Comstock book burnings in the United States (1873–1950 CE)===

Anthony Comstock&#x27;s New York Society for the Suppression of Vice, founded in 1873, inscribed book burning on its seal, as a worthy goal to be achieved. Comstock&#x27;s total accomplishment in a long and influential career is estimated to have been the destruction of some 15 tons of books, 284,000 pounds of plates for printing such &quot;objectionable&quot; books, and nearly 4,000,000 pictures. All of this material was defined as &quot;lewd&quot; by Comstock&#x27;s very broad definition of the term – which he and his associates successfully lobbied the United States Congress to incorporate in the Comstock Law.

=== Nazi regime (1933 CE) ===

The Nazi government decreed broad grounds for burning material &quot;which acts subversively on Nazi Germany&#x27;s future or strikes at the root of German thought, the German home and the driving forces of German people&quot;.

=== Allied occupation of Japan (1945–1952 CE)===
During the Allied occupation of Japan, GHQ officials banned any kind of criticism of the Allies or &quot;reactionary&quot; political ideas and many books were confiscated and burned. Over 7,000 books were destroyed.

==Notable book burnings and destruction of libraries==
==Burnings by authors==
In 1588, the exiled English Catholic William Cardinal Allen wrote &quot;An Admonition to the Nobility and People of England&quot;, a work sharply attacking Queen Elizabeth I. It was to be published in Spanish-occupied England in the event of the Spanish Armada succeeding in its invasion. Upon the defeat of the Armada, Allen carefully consigned his publication to the fire, and it is only known of through one of Elizabeth&#x27;s spies, who had stolen a copy.

Carlo Goldoni is known to have burned his first play, a tragedy called &quot;Amalasunta&quot; in the 1730s, when encountering unfavorable criticism.

The Hassidic Rabbi Nachman of Breslov is reported to have written a book which he himself burned in 1808. To this day, his followers mourn &quot;The Burned Book&quot; and seek in their Rabbi&#x27;s surviving writings for clues as to what the lost volume contained and why it was destroyed.

Nikolai Gogol burned the second half of his 1842 magnum opus &quot;Dead Souls&quot;, having come under the influence of a priest who persuaded him that his work was sinful; Gogol later described this as a mistake.

As noted in Claire Tomalin&#x27;s intensively researched &quot;The Invisible Woman&quot;, Charles Dickens is known to have made a big bonfire of his letters and private papers, as well as asking friends and acquaintances to either return letters which he wrote to them or themselves destroy the letters – and most complied with his request in the 1850s and the 1860s. Dickens&#x27; purpose was to destroy evidence of his affair with the actress Nelly Ternan. To judge from surviving Dickens letters, the destroyed material – even if not intended for publication – might have had considerable literary merit.

Martin Gardner, a well-known expert on the work of Lewis Carroll, believes that Carroll had written an earlier version in the 1860s of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; which he later destroyed after writing a more elaborate version which he presented to the child Alice who inspired the book.

In the 1870s Tchaikovsky destroyed the full manuscript of his first opera, &quot;The Voyevoda&quot;. Decades later, during the Soviet period, &quot;The Voyevoda&quot; was posthumously reconstructed from surviving orchestral and vocal parts and the composer&#x27;s sketches.

===20th century===
Alberto Santos-Dumont, after being considered a spy by the French government in 1914 and then having this deception excused by the police, he destroyed all his aeronautical documents. The following year, according to the afterword to the historical novel &quot;De gevleugelde,&quot; Arthur Japin says that when Dumont returned to Brazil, he &quot;burned all his diaries, letters and drawings.&quot;

After Hector Hugh Munro (better known by the pen name &quot;Saki&quot;) was killed in World War I in November 1916, his sister Ethel destroyed most of his papers.

There is substantial evidence that Finnish composer Jean Sibelius worked on an Eighth Symphony. He promised the premiere of this symphony to Serge Koussevitzky in 1931 and 1932, and a London performance in 1933 under Basil Cameron was even advertised to the public. However, no such symphony was ever performed, and the only concrete evidence of the symphony&#x27;s existence on paper is a 1933 bill for a fair copy of the first movement and short draft fragments first published and played in 2011. Sibelius had always been quite self-critical; he remarked to his close friends, &quot;If I cannot write a better symphony than my Seventh, then it shall be my last.&quot; Since no manuscript survives, sources consider it likely that Sibelius destroyed most traces of the score, probably in 1945, during which year he certainly consigned a great many papers to the flames.

Aino, Sibelius&#x27; wife, recalled that &quot;In the 1940s there was a great auto da fé at Ainola [where the Sibelius couple lived]. My husband collected a number of the manuscripts in a laundry basket and burned them on the open fire in the dining room. Parts of the &quot;Karelia Suite&quot; were destroyed – I later saw remains of the pages which had been torn out – and many other things. I did not have the strength to be present and left the room. I therefore do not know what he threw on to the fire. But after this my husband became calmer and gradually lighter in mood.&quot; It is assumed that a draft of Sibelius&#x27; Eighth Symphony - which he worked on in the early 1930s but with which he was not satisfied - was among the papers destroyed.

Joe Shuster, who together with Jerry Siegel created the fictional superhero Superman, in 1938 burned the first Superman story when under the impression that it would not find a publisher.

Axel Jensen made his debut as a novelist in Oslo in 1955 with the novel &quot;Dyretemmerens kors&quot;, but he later burned the remaining unsold copies of the book.

In August 1963, when C.S. Lewis resigned from Magdalene College, Cambridge and his rooms there were being cleaned out, Lewis gave instructions to Douglas Gresham to destroy all his unfinished or incomplete fragments of manuscript - which scholars researching Lewis&#x27; work regard as a grievous loss.

In 1976 detractors of Venezuelan liberal writer Carlos Rangel publicly burned copies of his book &quot;From the Noble Savage to the Noble Revolutionary&quot; in the year of its publication at the Central University of Venezuela.

==Books saved from burning==
In Catholic hagiography, Saint Vincent of Saragossa is mentioned as having been offered his life on condition that he consign Scripture to the fire; he refused and was martyred. He is often depicted holding the book which he protected with his life.

Another book-saving Catholic saint is the 10th-century Saint Wiborada. She is credited with having predicted in 925 an invasion by the then-pagan Hungarians of her region in Switzerland. Her warning allowed the priests and religious of St. Gall and St. Magnus to hide their books and wine and escape into caves in nearby hills. Wiborada herself refused to escape and was killed by the marauders, being later canonized. In art, she is commonly represented holding a book to signify the library she saved, and is considered a patron saint of libraries and librarians.

During a tour of Thuringia in 1525, Martin Luther became enraged at the widespread burning of libraries along with other buildings during the German Peasants&#x27; War, writing &quot;Against the Murderous, Thieving Hordes of Peasants&quot; in response.

During the Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire the Imperial Court Library (now Austrian National Library) was in extreme danger, when the bombardment of Vienna caused the burning of the Hofburg, in which the Imperial Library was located. The fire was halted in a timely manner - saving countless irreplaceable books, diligently collected by many generations of Habsburg emperors and the scholars in their employ.

At the beginning of the Battle of Monte Cassino in World War II, two German officers – Viennese-born Lt. Col. Julius Schlegel (a Roman Catholic) and Captain Maximilian Becker (a Protestant) – had the foresight to transfer the Monte Cassino archives to the Vatican. Otherwise the archives – containing a vast number of documents relating to the 1500-years&#x27; history of the Abbey as well as some 1,400 irreplaceable manuscript codices, chiefly patristic and historical – would have been destroyed in the Allied air bombing which almost completely destroyed the Abbey shortly afterwards. Also saved by the two officers&#x27; prompt action were the collections of the Keats-Shelley Memorial House in Rome, which had been sent to the Abbey for safety in December 1942.

The Sarajevo Haggadah – one of the oldest and most valuable Jewish illustrated manuscripts, with immense historical and cultural value – was hidden from the Nazis and their Ustaše collaborators by Derviš Korkut, chief librarian of the National Museum in Sarajevo. At risk to his own life, Korkut smuggled the Haggadah out of Sarajevo and gave it for safekeeping to a Muslim cleric in Zenica, where it was hidden until the end of the war under the floorboards of either a mosque or a Muslim home. The Haggadah again survived destruction during the wars which followed the breakup of Yugoslavia. 
In 1940s France, a group of anti-fascist exiles created a Library of Burned Books which housed all the books that Adolf Hitler had destroyed. This library contained copies of titles that were burned by the Nazis in their campaign to cleanse German culture of Jewish and foreign influences such as pacifist and decadent literature. The Nazis themselves planned to make a &quot;museum&quot; of Judaism once the &quot;Final Solution&quot; was complete to house certain books that they had saved.

== Posthumous destruction of works ==

When Virgil died, he left instructions that his manuscript of the &quot;Aeneid&quot; was to be burnt, as it was a draft version with uncorrected faults and not a final version for release. However, this instruction was ignored. It is mainly to the &quot;Aeneid&quot;, published in this &quot;imperfect&quot; form, that Virgil owes his lasting fame – and it is considered one of the great masterpieces of classical literature as a whole.

Before his death, Franz Kafka wrote to his friend and literary executor Max Brod: &quot;Dearest Max, my last request: Everything I leave behind me... in the way of diaries, manuscripts, letters (my own and others&#x27;), sketches, and so on, [is] to be burned unread.&quot; Brod overrode Kafka&#x27;s wishes, believing that Kafka had given these directions to him, specifically, because Kafka knew he would not honour them – Brod had told him as much. Had Brod carried out Kafka&#x27;s instructions, virtually the whole of Kafka&#x27;s work – except for a few short stories published in his lifetime – would have been lost forever. Most critics, at the time and up to the present, justify Brod&#x27;s decision. In his foreword to Kafka&#x27;s &quot;The Castle&quot; Brod noted that when entering Kafka&#x27;s apartment after his death, he found several big empty folders and traces of burnt paper - the manuscripts which were in these folders having evidently been destroyed by Kafka himself before his death. Brod expressed pain at the irreversible loss of this material and happiness at having saved so much of Kafka&#x27;s work from its creator&#x27;s ruthlessness.

A similar case concerns the noted American poet Emily Dickinson, who died in 1886 and left to her sister Lavinia the instruction of burning all her papers. Lavinia Dickinson did burn almost all of her sister&#x27;s correspondences, but interpreted the will as not including the forty notebooks and loose sheets, all filled with almost 1800 poems; these Lavinia saved and began to publish the poems that year. Had Lavinia Dickinson been more strict in carrying out her sister&#x27;s will, all but a small handful of Emily Dickinson&#x27;s poetic work would have been lost.

In early 1964, several months after the death of C.S. Lewis, Lewis&#x27; literary executor Walter Hooper, rescued a 64-page manuscript from a bonfire of the author&#x27;s writings – the burning carried out according to Lewis&#x27; will. In 1977, Hooper published it under the name &quot;The Dark Tower&quot;. It was apparently intended as part of Lewis&#x27; &quot;Space Trilogy&quot;. Though incomplete and evidently an early draft which Lewis abandoned, its publication aroused great interest and a continued discussion among Lewis fans and scholars researching his work.

==Modern biblioclasm==
Although the act of destroying books is condemned by the majority of the world&#x27;s societies, book burning still occurs on a small or large scale.

===20th century===
In Azerbaijan, when a modified Latin alphabet was adopted, books which were published in the Arabic script were burned, especially those published in the late 1920s and 1930s. The texts were not limited to the Quran; medical and historical manuscripts were also destroyed.

Book burnings were regularly organised in Nazi Germany in the 1930s by stormtroopers so that &quot;degenerate&quot; works could be destroyed, especially works written by Jewish authors such as Thomas Mann, Marcel Proust, and Karl Marx. One of the most infamous book burnings in the 20th century occurred in Frankfurt, Germany, on May 10, 1933. Organized by Joseph Goebbels, books were burned in a celebratory fashion, complete with bands, marchers, and songs. Seeking to &quot;cleanse&quot; German culture of the &quot;un-German&quot; spirit, Goebbels compelled students (who were egged on by their professors) to perform the book burning. To some this could be easily dismissed as the childish actions of the youth, but to many in Europe and America, it was a horrific display of power and disrespect. During the denazification which followed the war, literature which had been confiscated by the Allies was reduced to pulp rather than burned.

In 1937, during Getúlio Vargas&#x27; dictatorship in Brazil, several books by authors such as Jorge Amado and José Lins do Rego were burned in an anti-communist act.

In the People&#x27;s Republic of China from the 1940s to present day, library officials publicize the burning of &quot;illegal publications, religious publications&quot;.

In 1942, local Catholic priests forced Irish storyteller Timothy Buckley to burn a book &quot;The Tailor and Ansty&quot; by Eric Cross about Buckley and his wife, because of its sexual frankness.

In the 1950s, over six tons of books by Wilhelm Reich were burned in the U.S. in compliance with judicial orders. In 1954, the works of Mordecai Kaplan were burned by Orthodox Jewish rabbis in America, after Kaplan was excommunicated.

In Denmark, a comic book burning took place on 23 June 1955. It was a bonfire which consisted of comic books topped by a life-size cardboard cutout of The Phantom.

During the military dictatorship in Brazil from (1964-1985), several methods of censure were used, among them, torture and the burning of books by firemen.

Some supporters have celebrated book-burning cases in art and other media. Such is the case in Italy in 1973 with &quot;The Burning of Heretical Books&quot; over a side door on the façade of Santa Maria Maggiore, Rome, the bas-relief by Giovanni Battista Maini, which depicts the burning of &quot;heretical&quot; books as a triumph of righteousness.

During the years of the Chilean military dictatorship under Augusto Pinochet from 1973 to 1990, hundreds of books were burned as a way of repression and censorship of left-wing literature. In some instances, even books on Cubism were burned because soldiers thought it had to do with the Cuban Revolution.
In 1981, the Jaffna Public Library in Jaffna, Sri Lanka, was burned down by Sinhalese police and paramilitaries during a pogrom against the minority Tamil population. At the time of its burning, it contained almost 100,000 Tamil books and rare documents.

Kjell Ludvik Kvavik, a senior Norwegian official, had a penchant for removing maps and other pages from rare books and he was noticed in January 1983 by a young college student. The student, Barbro Andenaes, reported the actions of the senior official to the superintendent of the reading room and then reported them to the head librarian of the university library in Oslo. Hesitant to make the accusation against Kvavik public because it would greatly harm his career, even if it was proven to be false, the media did not divulge his name until his house was searched by police. The authorities seized 470 maps and prints as well as 112 books that Kvavik had illegally obtained. While this may not have been the large-scale, violent demonstration which usually occurs during wars, Kvavik&#x27;s disregard for libraries and books shows that the destruction of books on any scale can affect an entire country. Here, a senior official in the Norwegian government was disgraced and the University Library was only refunded for a small portion of the costs which it had incurred from the loss and destruction of rare materials and the security changes that had to be made as a result of it. In this case, the lure of personal profit and the desire to enhance one&#x27;s own collection were the causes of the defacement of rare books and maps. While the main goal was not destruction for destruction&#x27;s sake, the resulting damage to the ephemera still carries weight within the library community.

In 1984, during India’s attack at Sikh Golden Temple, Indian forces ransacked the Sikh Reference Library which held invaluable manuscripts and records in relation to Sikh and wider history. Much of the material was confiscated and remaining newspaper archives etc. were burned by the Army later claiming falsely that the fire broke out due to crossfire between Sikh militants and government forces. The whereabouts of large volume of works which vanished during the attack are unknown.

In 1984, Amsterdam&#x27;s South African Institute was infiltrated by an organized group which was bent on drawing attention to the inequality of apartheid. Well-organized and assuring patrons of the library that no harm would come to them, group members systematically smashed microfiche machines and threw books into the nearby waterway. Indiscriminate with regard to the content which was being destroyed, shelf after shelf was cleared of its contents until the group left. Staff members fished books from the water in hopes of salvaging the rare editions of travel books, documents about the Boer Wars, and contemporary materials which were both for and against apartheid. Many of these materials were destroyed by oil, ink, and paint that the anti-apartheid demonstrators had flung around the library. The world was outraged by the loss of knowledge that these demonstrators had caused, and instead of supporting their cause and drawing people&#x27;s attention to the issue of apartheid, the international community denounced their actions at Amsterdam&#x27;s South African Institute. Some of the demonstrators came forward and sought to justify their actions by accusing the institute of being pro-apartheid and claiming that nothing was being done to change the status quo in South Africa.

===21st century===
The advent of the digital age has resulted in the cataloguing of an immense collection of written works, exclusively or primarily in digital form. The intentional deletion or removal of these works has often been referred to as a new form of book burning. For example, Amazon, the world&#x27;s largest online marketplace, has increasingly banned the sale of controversial books. An article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that &quot;Booksellers that sell on Amazon say the retailer has no coherent philosophy about what it decides to prohibit, and seems largely guided by public complaints.&quot;.

A biblioclastic incident occurred in Mullumbimby, New South Wales, Australia in 2009. Reported as &quot;just like the ritual burning of books in Nazi Germany&quot;, a book-burning ceremony was held by students of the &quot;socially harmful cult&quot; Universal Medicine, an esoteric healing business which was owned by Serge Benhayon. Students were invited to throw their books onto the pyre. Most of the volumes were on Chinese medicine, kinesiology, acupuncture, homeopathy and other alternative healing modalities, all of which Benhayon has decreed evil or &quot;prana&quot;.

Russian nationalists burned Ukrainian history books in Crimea in 2010. Prorussian demonstrators burned books in Eastern Ukraine, 2014.

After the failed 2016 Turkish coup d&#x27;état, the Turkish government burned 301,878 books deemed related to the coup or its alleged leader, Fethullah Gülen, including 18 textbooks with the word &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; in them. Photos of books being burned became a viral sensation on the internet once they were taken by a website named Kronos27.

In April 2019 Poland, priests in Gdańsk burned &quot;Harry Potter&quot; books.

In 2019, the French-language Providence Catholic School Board in southwestern Ontario held a &#x27;flame purification&#x27; ceremony and burned around thirty recently banned children&#x27;s books. The ashes were used as fertilizer to plant trees and according to the participants the action was &#x27;to turn a negative to a positive&#x27;. The books included Tintin and Asterix and were deemed harmful to Indigenous people.

Since the introduction of the controversial national security law in 2020, multiple counts of biblioclasm have been reported. Shortly after the introduction of the new law, books written by prominent Hong Kong pro-democracy figures, including Joshua Wong and Tanya Chan, have been removed from public libraries. In 2021, 29 previously available titles about the Tiananmen Massacre are completely removed from the public libraries, whilst 94 of the remaining 120 titles are only available on request. In 2022, reported by local media, three secondary schools removed more than 400 books since June 2021. Unlike the two book burning happened in the public libraries, the schools were not given any concrete criteria but the schools had to perform the self-censorship themselves. Titles that were removed included those related to the 2019-2020 Hong Kong protests, Tiananmen Massacre and jailed activists. In the same year, the Hong Kong government also refused to provide a list of books that have been removed from the public libraries.

In February 2021 some religious communities in the United States have started holding book burning ceremonies to garner attention and publicly denounce heretical beliefs. In Tennessee pastor Greg Locke has held sermons over the incineration of books like Harry Potter and Twilight. This trend of calling for the burning of books one&#x27;s ideology conflicts with has continued into the political sphere. Two members of a Virginia school board Rabih Abuismail, and Kirk Twigg, have condoned the burning of recently banned books to keep their ideas out of the minds of the public. In September 2023, Missouri State Senator and gubernatorial candidate Bill Eigel showed off a flamethrower at a campaign event and vowed to burn &quot;woke pornographic books [...] on the front lawn of the governor&#x27;s mansion&quot; if elected.

During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the destruction of Ukrainian books, especially on the history of Ukraine and the history of the Russian-Ukrainian war, are known. In Mariupol, Russians burned all the books from the library of the church of Petro Mohyla. In the temporarily occupied Mariupol, Russian invaders threw away books from the library collections of the Pryazovskyi State Technical University. Russian “military police” seized and destroyed books on Ukrainian history and culture in the occupied territories in the Northeast of Ukraine. There are also cases of destruction and damage to the Ukrainian archives with documents about Soviet repression and attempts to introduce Russian re-educational programs in Melitopol.

==Sikh book burning==
In the Sikh religion, any copies of their sacred book, Guru Granth Sahib, which are too badly damaged to be used, and any printer&#x27;s waste which bears any of its text, are cremated. This ritual is called an &quot;Agan Bhet&quot;, and it is similar to the ritual which is performed when a deceased Sikh is cremated.

==Book burnings in popular culture==
* In chapters 6 and 7 of the first part of &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, the titular character&#x27;s parish priest, relatives, and friends examine his library, full with chivalry romances and other books, and decide to burn most of them and seal the room. The comments of the priest allow author Cervantes to praise or condemn the books, while subtly satirizing the Spanish Inquisition.
*In his 1821 play, &quot;Almansor&quot;, the German writer Heinrich Heine – referring to the burning of the Muslim holy book, the Qur&#x27;an, during the Spanish Inquisition – wrote, &quot;Where they burn books, so too will they in the end burn people.&quot; (&quot;Dort, wo man Bücher verbrennt, verbrennt man auch am Ende Menschen.&quot;) Over a century later, Heine&#x27;s own books were among the thousands of volumes that were torched by the Nazis in Berlin&#x27;s Opernplatz, even while his poem &quot;Die Lorelei&quot; continued to be printed in German schoolbooks as &quot;by an unknown author&quot;.
* Book burning played a small part in Jules Verne&#x27;s 1864 &quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth&quot;. After Professor Lidenbrock deciphers a writing of Arne Saknussem and attempts to recreate his purported subterranean journey, his nephew Axel protests that they should study more of his works before making any rash decisions. Professor Lidenbrock explains that this is impossible: Saknussem was out of favor in his native country, whose leaders ordered all of his writings burned after his death.
* In Ray Bradbury&#x27;s 1953 novel &quot;Fahrenheit 451,&quot; about a culture which has outlawed books due to its disdain for learning, books are burned along with the houses they are hidden in.
* In the 1984 film &quot;Footloose&quot; book burning is a theme that in 2023 was linked to the Banned Books Week.

<text>The Enzian was a German WWII surface-to-air anti-aircraft missile that was the first to use a radio controlled guidance system. During the missile&#x27;s development in the late stages of the war it was plagued by organisational problems and was cancelled before becoming operational.

It was named for a genus of mountain flower, in English the Gentian.

== Development ==

As early as 1943 it was becoming clear that Messerschmitt&#x27;s Me 163 interceptor would be difficult to use in combat. After flying to the altitude of allied bombers, it had only a few minutes to find them and make an attack before running out of fuel. Even if the aircraft did accomplish this, it then had the additional problem of lacking a weapon that could be aimed effectively while closing on the target at some .

Dr. Herman Wurster of Messerschmitt proposed an answer in the form of &quot;Flak Rakete 1&quot; (FR-1) in 1943. Instead of tracking down the planes, the rocket would fly just in front of the target and then detonate a warhead, in the hope of bringing down several bombers at once. With no human pilot on board, and thus no need to limit takeoff acceleration, the rocket could use solid fuel boosters (four Schmidding 109-553s, for a total of of thrust, grouped around the exterior), reducing the amount of fuel needed for the rest of the climb by the sustainer motor, a Walther RI-10B. The liquid fueled sustainer used a combination of &quot;SV-Stoff&quot; and &quot;Br-Stoff&quot; (petrol), catalyzed by an amount of &quot;T-Stoff&quot;. The result, even with the heavy warhead, was that a much smaller airframe was needed to carry the required fuelso small it could be portable and launched from a modified 88 mm gun mounting.

The design made as much use of wood as possible, due to the need to conserve other &quot;strategic&quot; materials in the rapidly deteriorating war situation. For the same reasons a new type of Walter rocket was envisioned, a modification of the engine in the Me 163 that would burn coal-gas (benzine) instead of the hydrogen peroxide used in other Walter designs (although a small amount of peroxide was used to drive the fuel pumps). Thrust was also reduced in flight, from to .

The missile, which strongly resembled the Me 163 (with swept wings and elevons) would be guided primarily under radio control from the ground. The operator would fly the missile into the vicinity of the bombers, then cut the engine and let it glide. This presented a real problem in the &quot;Enzian&quot;. Other German missiles were high-speed designs that could be flown directly at their target along the line of sight, which is fairly straightforward even for an operator on the ground. The Enzian would instead be approaching its target from somewhere in front, which is considerably harder for the operator. Many experiments with radio and wire-guided missiles had demonstrated real problems with last-minute &quot;terminal guidance&quot; corrections.

The initial plans for solving this problem were rather advanced. The large airframe left plenty of room in the nose, which the designers intended to fill with a self-contained radar unit called &quot;Elsass&quot;. In the short term it was planned to use some sort of proximity fuze while flying the missile through the bomber stream. The warhead, of which several were studied, was to have a nominal lethal radius of .

Several elaborations of the basic design were carried out, resulting in the FR-1 through FR-5. The FR-5 was considered to be a reasonable starting point, so development commenced on the newly named &quot;Enzian&quot; E.1 (and its engine) in September 1943. By May 1944, 60 airframes were complete, awaiting their engines. In order to gain flight test data they were fitted with RATO units instead.

A series of 38 flight tests commenced with generally favourable results, but the engine still lagged. Finally Dr. Konrad, the designer of the engine of the Rheintochter missile, was asked to modify his design for use in the &quot;Enzian&quot;. On consideration, it appeared this was a much better (and cheaper) solution anyway, and after January 1945 there were no plans to use the Walter design. The resulting E-4 version with the Konrad engine was considered the production version.

Because of difficulties in perfecting the proximity fuze, an infrared homing system, &quot;Madrid&quot;, was proposed, allowing &quot;Enzian&quot; to be flown right to the target. However the system was never actually developed beyond a test-bench mockup.

On 17 January 1945, all development projects were cancelled by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; in order to concentrate all possible efforts on only two designs, the Messerschmitt Me 262 and the Heinkel He 162. Although this was the official story, many in the Nazi and &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; hierarchy had their own pet projects continue. &quot;Enzian&quot; was judged further from completion than Henschel&#x27;s &quot;Schmetterling&quot; missile, so it was cancelled. Messerschmitt engineers continued some low-level work on the project, hoping it would be re-funded, but by March it was clear the cancellation order would not be rescinded (although it had been for other designs) and all development efforts ceased.

== Survivors ==
Only two &quot;Enzian&quot; missiles are known to have survived the war. One is on display at the Royal Air Force Museum Cosford and the other is in storage at the Australian War Memorial&#x27;s Treloar Resource Centre after being displayed for many years at the Royal Australian Air Force Museum.

==Cultural references==
&quot;Enzian&quot; is the name of the foil character in Thomas Pynchon&#x27;s &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;, contrasted against the main character Slothrop&#x27;s association with the V-2.

<text>Hazel Reid O&#x27;Leary (born May 17, 1937) is an American lawyer, politician, and university administrator who served as the 7th United States secretary of energy from 1993 to 1997. A member of the Democratic Party, O&#x27;Leary was the first woman and first African American to hold that post. She also served as the 14th president of Fisk University from 2004 to 2013, a historically black college and her alma mater. O&#x27;Leary&#x27;s tenure at Fisk came amid financial difficulty for the school, during which time she increased enrollment and contentiously used the school&#x27;s art collection to raise funds.

O&#x27;Leary received her bachelor&#x27;s degree from Fisk before earning her Bachelor of Laws degree from Rutgers School of Law. O&#x27;Leary worked as a prosecutor in New Jersey and then in a private consulting/accounting firm before joining the Carter administration in the newly created Department of Energy. O&#x27;Leary returned to the private sector in 1981 but rejoined the government as secretary of energy under President Bill Clinton. During her tenure, she declassified documents detailing how the United States had conducted secret testing on the effects of radiation on unsuspecting American citizens. She also received criticism for excessive spending on international trips while in office.

==Early life and education==
Hazel Reid was born in Newport News, Virginia. Her parents, Russel E. Reid and Hazel Reid, were both physicians. They divorced when she was 18 months old. Her father and stepmother, a teacher named Mattie Pullman Reid, raised Hazel and her older sister Edna Reid, primarily in the East End neighborhood. Hazel attended school in a segregated school system in Newport News for eight years. She and her sister were then sent to live with an aunt in Essex County, New Jersey, and attend Arts High School, an integrated school. She earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree at Fisk University in Nashville in 1959. She then married Carl Rollins and had a son before returning to school and earning her Bachelor of Laws degree from Rutgers Law School in Newark in 1966.

==Career==

=== Early career ===
O&#x27;Leary worked as a prosecutor in New Jersey on organized crime cases, later becoming an assistant attorney general for the state. In 1969, after obtaining a divorce, O&#x27;Leary moved to Washington, D.C., where she joined the consulting/accounting firm Coopers &amp; Lybrand. During the Carter administration, O&#x27;Leary was appointed assistant administrator of the Federal Energy Administration, general counsel of the Community Services Administration, and administrator of the Economic Regulatory Administration at the newly created Department of Energy, where she met Deputy Secretary of Energy John F. O&#x27;Leary. They married on April24, 1980.

After Carter lost the 1980 election, the O&#x27;Learys established the consulting firm O&#x27;Leary &amp; Associates in Morristown, New Jersey, where she served as vice president and general counsel. After Jack died of cancer in 1987, she moved to Minnesota. From 1989 to 1993, O&#x27;Leary worked as an executive vice president of the Northern States Power Company, a Minnesota-based public utility.

=== Secretary of Energy ===
In a press conference on December 21, 1992, held in Little Rock, Arkansas, then President-elect Bill Clinton announced his intention to nominate O&#x27;Leary as secretary of energy. Clinton officially made the nomination on January20, 1993, and the Senate confirmed O&#x27;Leary by unanimous consent the next day. O&#x27;Leary was the first woman and first African American to serve as energy secretary. She was also the first secretary of that department to have worked for an energy company. At the time she led the Department of Energy, it had an annual budget of $18billion and approximately 18,000 employees.

O&#x27;Leary challenged the way the department had traditionally been run, particularly its focus on developing and testing nuclear weapons. During her tenure, the size of the Department of Energy was reduced by a third. It was also a target for Republicans who wanted it eliminated. While reducing the size of the department overall, O&#x27;Leary shifted resources toward efficient and renewable energy sources, a priority of the Clinton administration.

In this position, O&#x27;Leary won praise for declassifying old Department of Energy documents, including Cold War-era records that showed the U.S. government had used American citizens as guinea pigs in human radiation experiments, as had long been rumored. Clinton issued Executive Order 12891, which created the Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments (ACHRE) to prevent such abuses of power. O&#x27;Leary also announced a $4.6million settlement payment to the families of victims of past radiation experiments. Other declassified documents included facts about plutonium the United States had left in South Vietnam.

O&#x27;Leary also pushed to end nuclear testing in the United States. Her efforts resulted in Clinton signing a test ban on nuclear testing, a ban that other nations joined. Early in her tenure as secretary, O&#x27;Leary met with whistle-blowers who said they faced harassment for raising legitimate health and safety issues within the DOE. She announced a &quot;zero tolerance&quot; policy, prohibiting retaliation against whistle-blowers at nuclear plants.

O&#x27;Leary repeatedly faced criticism during her tenure. The DOE allocated $43,500 to a Washington firm to identify unfriendly media outlets, which White House Press Secretary Michael D. McCurry called &quot;unacceptable.&quot; O&#x27;Leary claimed the allocation was made without her direct knowledge and defended the research as an attempt to study the efficacy of the department&#x27;s messaging. A Government Accountability Office audit of travel criticized her for traveling too frequently and spending excessively on accommodations. She apologized to Congressional committees in 1996 for spending that exceeded limits on the funds appropriated to the agency for travel.

O&#x27;Leary resigned from her position effective January20, 1997, explaining she did not wish to stay in the job more than four years. In 1997, Johnny Chung, a Democratic political donor, claimed that O&#x27;Leary had met with Chinese oil officials after he gave $25,000 to O&#x27;Leary&#x27;s favorite charity, &quot;Africare&quot;, in 1995. In August of that year, Attorney General Janet Reno reviewed Chung&#x27;s allegations to decide whether to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate O&#x27;Leary. Reno determined there was &quot;no evidence&quot; of wrongdoing by O&#x27;Leary and no basis for a further investigation. Some observers, including a lawyer for the Government Accountability Project, saw some fault in O&#x27;Leary&#x27;s conduct but also saw racism and sexism in the way she was treated.

=== Post-government ===
After leaving the Clinton administration, O&#x27;Leary once again served as president of O&#x27;Leary &amp; Associates, her consulting firm. She also sat on the board of the environmental engineering firm ICF Kaiser International. In 2000, she became president and chief operating officer of an investment banking firm, Blaylock &amp; Partners. She left that firm in 2002.

====Fisk University president====
On July 13, 2004, O&#x27;Leary was selected and began work as president of her undergraduate &quot;alma mater&quot;, Fisk University, a historically black college in Nashville, Tennessee. She was officially installed as the university&#x27;s 14th president on October6, 2005. Before O&#x27;Leary&#x27;s tenure, the university had tried unsuccessfully to increase its enrollment and experienced financial problems. In 2008, Fisk had an enrollment of 770 students and 264 faculty and staff members. 
 By 2011, Fisk&#x27;s enrollment numbers improved, but the school was still operating with a loss in six of the previous nine years. These ongoing financial problems caused the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges to place Fisk on probation in 2010 over concerns for the university&#x27;s finances and prospects. The probation ended in December 2013.

Under O&#x27;Leary&#x27;s leadership, Fisk went to court in December 2005 seeking a ruling that it could sell a portion of the university&#x27;s Alfred Stieglitz Collection. Stieglitz&#x27;s widow Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe had bequeathed the collection to Fisk with restrictions on its sale. O&#x27;Leary intended to use the proceeds of the sale to fund a new academic building, endow professorships, and rebuild the school&#x27;s endowment, which had been drawn down several times before her arrival. The Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe Foundation opposed the sale, and later the Tennessee State Attorney General opposed any sale of the artwork out of state. Ultimately, after seven years of legal battles, the school was able to reach a deal with Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Arkansas to share the collection. At the time the deal was finalized, O&#x27;Leary said the arrangement was essential to keeping the university open.

Amidst the public battle over attempts to sell the Alfred Stieglitz Collection, O&#x27;Leary quietly arranged to sell two other works of art, including a work by Florine Stettheimer. Fisk&#x27;s board of trustees approved the sale in 2010 although it was not publicly disclosed until &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported it in 2016. O&#x27;Leary defended the decision to sell the artwork, saying it was done out of necessity amid financial difficulties.

In 2012, O&#x27;Leary announced that she would retire at the end of the calendar year. Her retirement was effective January31, 2013. She was succeeded by H. James Williams.

=== Other affiliations ===
O&#x27;Leary has served as a director for Alchemix Corp. and CAMAC Energy. She also served on the board of directors for nonprofit organizations such as the Nashville Alliance for Public Education, the Nashville Business Community for the Arts, and the Arms Control Association, and as a trustee on boards of the World Wildlife Fund, Morehouse College, and The Andrew Young Center of International Development.

==Personal life==
O&#x27;Leary has been married three times. Her first marriage to Carl G. Rollins, Jr., ended in divorce. The couple had a son, also named Carl, who became an attorney. O&#x27;Leary was briefly married to ABC News anchorman Max Robinson. In 1977, she met John F. O&#x27;Leary, then Deputy Secretary of Energy. They married on April24, 1980, and remained married until his death from cancer in 1987.

In 1997, O&#x27;Leary joined a Presbyterian Church. She is a member of The Links.

<doc id="152546" wikidata="Q50926" url="?curid=152546" title="Zita of Bourbon-Parma">
<text>Zita of Bourbon-Parma (Zita Maria delle Grazie Adelgonda Micaela Raffaela Gabriella Giuseppina Antonia Luisa Agnese; 9 May 1892 – 14 March 1989) was the wife of Charles I, the last monarch of Austria-Hungary. She was also the last Empress of Austria and Queen of Hungary, in addition to other titles. She was declared Servant of God by Pope Benedict XVI.

Born as the seventeenth child of the dispossessed Robert I, Duke of Parma, and Infanta Maria Antonia of Portugal, Zita married the then Archduke Charles of Austria in 1911. Charles became heir presumptive to the Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria in 1914 after the assassination of his uncle Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, and acceded to the throne in 1916 after the elderly emperor&#x27;s death.

After the end of World War I in 1918, the Habsburgs were deposed and the former empire became home to the states of Austria, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia, while other parts were annexed to or joined the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, Italy, Romania, and a reconstituted independent Poland. Charles and Zita left for exile in Switzerland and, after the failure of attempts to restore royal rule in Hungary, were subsequently removed from that country by the Allies to Madeira, where Charles died in 1922. After her husband&#x27;s death, Zita and her son Otto served as symbols of unity for the exiled dynasty. A devout Catholic, she raised a large family after being widowed at the age of 29; she never remarried.

==Early life==
Princess Zita of Bourbon-Parma was born at the Villa Pianore in the Italian Province of Lucca, 9 May 1892. The unusual name &quot;Zita&quot; was given to her after Zita, a popular Italian saint who had lived in Tuscany in the 13th century. She was the third daughter and fifth child of the deposed Robert I, Duke of Parma, and his second wife, Infanta Maria Antonia of Portugal, a daughter of King Miguel of Portugal and his wife Adelaide of Löwenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg. Zita&#x27;s father had lost his throne as a result of the movement for Italian unification in 1859 when he was still a child. He fathered twelve children during his first marriage to Princess Maria Pia of the Two Sicilies (six of whom were mentally disabled, and three of whom died young). Duke Robert became a widower in 1882, and two years later he married Infanta Maria Antonia of Portugal. The second marriage produced a further twelve children. Zita was the 17th among Duke Robert&#x27;s 24 children. Robert moved his large family between Villa Pianore (a large property located between Pietrasanta and Viareggio) and his Schwarzau Castle in Lower Austria. It was mainly in these two residences that Zita spent her formative years. The family spent most of the year in Austria, moving to Pianore in the winter and returning in the summer. To move between them, they took a special train with sixteen coaches to accommodate the family and their belongings.
Zita and her siblings were raised to speak Italian, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese and English. She recalled:
At the age of ten, Zita was sent to a boarding school at Zanberg in Upper Bavaria, where there was a strict regime of study and religious instruction. She was summoned home in the autumn of 1907 at the death of her father. Her maternal grandmother sent Zita and her sister Francesca to a convent on the Isle of Wight to complete their education. Brought up as devout Catholics, the Parma children regularly undertook good works for the poor. In Schwarzau the family turned surplus cloth into clothes. Zita and Francesca personally distributed food, clothing, and medicines to the needy in Pianore. Three of Zita&#x27;s sisters became nuns and, for a time, she considered following the same path. Zita went through a period of poor health and was sent for the traditional cure at a European spa for two years.

==Marriage==

In the close vicinity of Schwarzau castle was the Villa Wartholz, residence of Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria, Zita&#x27;s maternal aunt. She was the stepmother of Archduke Otto, who died in 1906, and the step-grandmother of Archduke Charles of Austria-Este, at that time second-in-line to the Austrian throne. The two daughters of Archduchess Maria Theresa were Zita&#x27;s first cousins and Charles&#x27; half-aunts. They had met as children but did not see one another for almost ten years, as each pursued their education. In 1909, his Dragoon regiment was stationed at Brandýs nad Labem, from where he visited his aunt at Františkovy Lázně. It was during one of these visits that Charles and Zita became reacquainted. Charles was under pressure to marry (Franz Ferdinand, his uncle and first-in-line, had married morganatically, and his children were excluded from the throne) and Zita had a suitably royal genealogy. Zita later recalled:
Archduke Charles traveled to Villa Pianore and asked for Zita&#x27;s hand and, on 13 June 1911, their engagement was announced at the Austrian court. Zita in later years recalled that after her engagement she had expressed to Charles her worries about the fate of the Austrian Empire and the challenges of the monarchy. Charles and Zita were married at the Schwarzau castle on 21 October 1911. Charles&#x27;s great-uncle, the 81-year-old Emperor Franz Joseph I, attended the wedding. He was relieved to see an heir make a suitable marriage, and was in good spirits, even leading the toast at the wedding breakfast. Archduchess Zita soon conceived a son, and Otto was born on 20 November 1912. Seven more children followed in the next decade.

==Wife of the heir to Austrian throne==
At this time, Archduke Charles was in his twenties and did not expect to become emperor for some time, especially while Franz Ferdinand remained in good health. This changed on 28 June 1914 when the heir and his wife Sophie were assassinated in Sarajevo by Bosnian Serb nationalists. Charles and Zita received the news by telegram that day. She said of her husband, &quot;Though it was a beautiful day, I saw his face go white in the sun.&quot;

In the war that followed, Charles was promoted to General in the Austro-Hungarian army, taking command of the 20th Corps for an offensive in Tyrol. The war was personally difficult for Zita, as several of her brothers fought on opposing sides in the conflict (Prince Felix and Prince René had joined the Austrian army, while Prince Sixtus and Prince Xavier lived in France before the war and enlisted in the Belgian army.) Also her country of birth, Italy, joined the war against Austria in 1915, and so rumours of the &#x27;Italian&#x27; Zita began to be muttered. Even as late as 1917, the German ambassador in Vienna, Count Botho von Wedel-Jarlsberg, would write to Berlin saying &quot;The Empress is descended from an Italian princely house... People do not entirely trust the Italian and her brood of relatives.&quot;

At Franz Joseph&#x27;s request, Zita and her children left their residence at Schloss Hetzendorf and moved into a suite of rooms at Schönbrunn Palace. Here, Zita spent many hours with the old Emperor on both formal and informal occasions, where Franz Joseph confided in her his fears for the future. Emperor Franz Joseph died of bronchitis and pneumonia at the age of 86 on 21 November 1916. &quot;I remember the dear plump figure of Prince Lobkowitz going up to my husband,&quot; Zita later recounted, &quot;and, with tears in his eyes, making the sign of the cross on Charles&#x27;s forehead. As he did so he said, &#x27;May God bless Your Majesty.&#x27; It was the first time we had heard the Imperial title used to us.&quot;

==Empress and queen==

Charles and Zita were crowned in Budapest on 30 December 1916. Following the coronation there was a banquet, but after that the festivities ended, as the emperor and empress thought it wrong to have prolonged celebrations during a time of war. At the beginning of the reign, Charles was more often than not away from Vienna, so he had a telephone line installed from Baden (where Charles&#x27;s military headquarters were located) to the Hofburg. He called Zita several times a day whenever they were separated. Zita had some influence on her husband and would discreetly attend audiences with the Prime Minister or military briefings, and she had a special interest in social policy. However, military matters were the sole domain of Charles. Energetic and strong-willed, Zita accompanied her husband to the provinces and to the front, as well as occupying herself with charitable works and hospital visits to the war-wounded.

===Sixtus affair===

By the spring of 1917, the War was dragging on towards its fourth year, and Zita&#x27;s brother Prince Sixtus of Bourbon-Parma, a serving officer in the Belgian Army, was a main mover behind a plan for Austria-Hungary to make a separate peace with France. Charles initiated contact with Sixtus through contacts in neutral Switzerland, and Zita wrote a letter inviting him to Vienna. Zita&#x27;s mother, Maria Antonia, delivered the letter in person.

Sixtus arrived with conditions for talks which had been agreed with the French – the restoration to France of Alsace-Lorraine (annexed by Germany after the Franco-Prussian War in 1870); restoration of the independence of Belgium; independence for the kingdom of Serbia; and the handover of Constantinople to Russia. Charles agreed, in principle, to the first three points and wrote a letter to Sixtus dated 25 March 1917 which sent &quot;the secret and unofficial message&quot; to the President of France that &quot;I will use all means and all my personal influence&quot;. This attempt at dynastic diplomacy eventually foundered. Germany refused to negotiate over Alsace-Lorraine, and, seeing a Russian collapse on the horizon, was loath to give up the war. Sixtus continued his efforts, even meeting David Lloyd George in London about Italy&#x27;s territorial demands on Austria in the 1915 Treaty of London, but the Prime Minister could not persuade his generals that Britain should make peace with Austria. Zita managed a personal achievement during this time by stopping the German plans to send airplanes to bomb the home of the King and Queen of Belgium on their name days.

In April 1918, after the German-Russian Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, Austrian Foreign Minister Count Ottokar Czernin made a speech attacking incoming French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau as being the main obstacle to a peace favouring the Central Powers. Clemenceau was incensed and, after seeing Emperor Charles&#x27;s letter of 24 March 1917, had it published. For a while, the life of Sixtus appeared to be in danger, and there were even fears that Germany might occupy Austria. Czernin persuaded Charles to send a &#x27;Word of Honour&#x27; to Austria&#x27;s allies saying that Sixtus had not been authorised to show the letter to the French Government, that Belgium had not been mentioned, and that Clemenceau had lied about the mentioning of Alsace. Czernin had actually been in contact with the German Embassy throughout the whole crisis and attempted to persuade the Emperor to step down because of the Affair. After failing to do so, Czernin resigned as Foreign Minister.

===End of Empire===
By this time, the war was closing in on the embattled Emperor. A Union of Czech Deputies had already sworn an oath to a new Czechoslovak state independent of the Habsburg Empire on 13 April 1918, the prestige of the German Army had taken a severe blow at the Battle of Amiens, and, on 25 September 1918, Zita&#x27;s brother-in-law King Ferdinand I of Bulgaria broke away from his allies in the Central Powers and sued for peace independently. Zita was with Charles when he received the telegram announcing Bulgaria&#x27;s collapse. She remembered it &quot;made it even more urgent to start peace talks with the Western Powers while there was still something to talk about.&quot; On 16 October, the Emperor issued a &quot;People&#x27;s Manifesto&quot; proposing the empire be restructured on federal lines with each nationality gaining its own state. Instead, each nation broke away and the empire effectively dissolved.

Leaving behind their children at Gödöllő, Charles and Zita travelled to the Schönbrunn Palace. By this time ministers had been appointed by the new state of &quot;German-Austria&quot;, and by 11 November, together with the Emperor&#x27;s spokesmen, they prepared a manifesto for Charles to sign. Zita, at first glance, mistook it for an abdication and made her famous statement:
Charles gave his permission for the document to be published, and he, his family and the remnants of his Court departed for the Royal shooting lodge at Eckartsau, close to the borders with Hungary and Slovakia. The Republic of German-Austria was proclaimed the next day.

==Exile==

After a difficult few months at Eckartsau, the Imperial Family received aid from an unexpected source. Prince Sixtus had met King George V and appealed to him to help the Habsburgs. George was reportedly moved by the request, it being only months since his imperial relatives in Russia had been executed by revolutionaries, and promised &quot;We will immediately do what is necessary.&quot;

Several British Army officers were sent to help Charles, most notably Lieutenant-Colonel Edward Lisle Strutt, who was a grandson of Lord Belper and a former student at the University of Innsbruck. On 19 March 1919, orders were received from the War Office to &quot;get the Emperor out of Austria without delay&quot;. With some difficulty, Strutt managed to arrange a train to Switzerland, enabling the Emperor to leave the country with dignity without having to abdicate. Charles, Zita, their children and their household left Eckartsau on 24 March escorted by a detachment of British soldiers from the Honourable Artillery Company under the command of Strutt.

===Hungary and exile in Madeira===
The family&#x27;s first home in exile was Wartegg Castle in Rorschach, Switzerland, a property owned by the Bourbon-Parmas. However, the Swiss authorities, worried about the implication of the Habsburgs living near the Austrian border, compelled them to move to the western part of the country. The next month, therefore, found them moving to Villa Prangins, near Lake Geneva, where they resumed a quiet family life. This abruptly ended in March 1920 when, after a period of instability in Hungary, Miklós Horthy was elected regent. Charles was still technically King (as Charles IV) but Horthy sent an emissary to Prangins advising him not to go to Hungary until the situation had calmed. After the Trianon Treaty Horthy&#x27;s ambition soon grew. Charles became concerned and requested the help of Colonel Strutt to get him into Hungary. Charles twice attempted to regain control, once in March 1921 and again in October 1921. Both attempts failed, despite Zita&#x27;s staunch support (she insisted on travelling with him on the final dramatic train journey to Budapest).

Charles and Zita temporarily resided at Tata Castle, the home of Count Esterházy, until a suitable permanent exile could be found. Malta was mooted as a possibility, but was declined by Lord Curzon, and French territory was ruled out given the possibility of Zita&#x27;s brothers intriguing on Charles&#x27;s behalf. Eventually, the Portuguese island of Madeira was chosen. On 31 October 1921, the former Imperial couple were taken by rail from Tihany to Baja, where the Royal Navy monitor HMS &quot;Glowworm&quot; was waiting. They finally arrived at Funchal on 19 November. Their children were being looked after at Wartegg Castle in Switzerland by Charles&#x27;s step-grandmother Maria Theresa, although Zita managed to see them in Zürich when her son Robert needed an operation for appendicitis. The children joined their parents in Madeira in February 1922.

===Death of Charles===
Charles had been in poor health for some time. After going shopping on a chilly day in Funchal to buy toys for Carl Ludwig, he was struck by an attack of bronchitis. This rapidly worsened into pneumonia, not helped by the inadequate medical care available. Several of the children and staff were also ill, and Zita (at the time eight months pregnant) helped nurse them all. Charles weakened and died on 1 April, his last words to his wife being &quot;I love you so much.&quot; Charles was 34 years old. After his funeral, a witness said of Zita &quot;This woman really is to be admired. She did not, for one second, lose her composure... she greeted the people on all sides and then spoke to those who had helped out with the funeral. They were all under her charm.&quot; Zita wore mourning black in Charles&#x27;s memory throughout sixty-seven years of widowhood.

==Widowhood==

After Charles&#x27;s death, the former Austrian imperial family were soon to move again. Alfonso XIII of Spain had approached the British Foreign Office via his ambassador in London, and they agreed to allow Zita and her seven (soon to be eight) children to relocate to Spain. Alfonso duly sent the warship &quot;Infanta Isabel&quot; to Funchal and this took them to Cadiz. They were then escorted to the Pardo Palace in Madrid, where shortly after her arrival Zita gave birth to Archduchess Elisabeth. Alfonso XIII offered his exiled Habsburg relatives the use of Palacio Uribarren at Lekeitio on the Bay of Biscay. This appealed to Zita, who did not want to be a heavy burden to the state that harboured her. For the next six years Zita settled in Lekeitio, where she got on with the job of raising and educating her children. They lived with straitened finances, mainly living on income from private property in Austria, income from a vineyard in Johannisberg in the Rhine Valley, and voluntary collections. Other members of the exiled Habsburg dynasty, however, claimed much of this money, and there were regular petitions for help from former Imperial officials.

===Move to Belgium===
By 1929, several of the children were approaching the age to attend university and the family moved to a castle in the Belgian village of Steenokkerzeel near Brussels, where they were closer to several members of their family. Zita continued her political lobbying on behalf of the Habsburg family, even sounding out links with Mussolini&#x27;s Italy. There was even a possibility of a Habsburg restoration under the Austrian Chancellors Engelbert Dollfuss and Kurt Schuschnigg, with Crown Prince Otto visiting Austria numerous times. These overtures were abruptly ended by the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany in 1938. As exiles, the Habsburg family took the lead in resisting the Nazis in Austria, but this foundered because of opposition between monarchists and socialists.

===Flight to North America===
With the Nazi invasion of Belgium on 10 May 1940, Zita and her family became war refugees. They narrowly missed being killed by a direct hit on the castle by German bombers and fled to Prince Xavier&#x27;s castle at Bostz in France. The Habsburgs then fled to the Spanish border, reaching it on 18 May. On June 12 the Portuguese ruler António Salazar issued instructions to the Portuguese consulates in France to provide Infanta Maria Antónia of Portugal Duchess of Parma with Portuguese passports. With these Portuguese passports the family could get visas without creating problems for the neutrality of the Portuguese Government. This way the daughter of Maria Antónia, Zita of Bourbon-Parma, and her son Otto von Habsburg got their visas because they were descendants of a Portuguese citizen.
They moved on to Portugal and resided in Cascais. Not long after, the archduke was informed by Salazar that Hitler had demanded his extradition. The demand would be refused, the Portuguese ruler told him, but hinted that his safety was precarious. On 9 July the United States government granted the family visas. After a perilous journey they arrived in New York City on 27 July, having family in Long Island and Newark, New Jersey; at one point, Zita and several of her children lived, as long-term house-guests, in Tuxedo Park, New York.

The Austrian imperial refugees eventually settled in Quebec, which had the advantage of being French-speaking (the younger children were not yet fluent in English) and continued their studies in French at . As they were cut off from all European funds, finances were more stretched than ever. At one stage, Zita was reduced to making salad and spinach dishes from dandelion leaves. However, all her sons were active in the war effort. Otto promoted the dynasty&#x27;s role in a post-war Europe and met regularly with Franklin Roosevelt; Robert was the Habsburg representative in London; Carl Ludwig and Felix joined the United States Army, serving with several American-raised relatives of the Mauerer line; Rudolf smuggled himself into Austria in the final days of the war to help organise the resistance. In 1945 Empress Zita celebrated her birthday on the first day of peace, 9 May. She was to spend the next two years touring the United States and Canada to raise funds for war-ravaged Austria and Hungary.

==Later life==

After a period of rest and recovery, Zita found herself regularly going back to Europe for the weddings of her children. She decided to move back to the continent full-time in 1952 to Luxembourg to look after her aging mother. Maria Antonia died at the age of 96 in 1959. The bishop of Chur proposed to Zita that she move into a residence that he administered (formerly a castle of the Counts de Salis) at Zizers, Graubünden in Switzerland. As the castle had enough space for visits from her large family and a nearby chapel (a necessity for the devoutly-Catholic Zita), she accepted with ease.

Zita occupied herself in her final years with her family. Although the restrictions on the Habsburgs entering Austria had been lifted, that applied only to those born after 10 April 1919. That meant that Zita could not attend the funeral of her daughter Adelheid in 1972, which was painful for her. She also involved herself in the efforts to have her deceased husband, the &quot;Peace Emperor&quot; canonised. In 1982, the restrictions were eased, and she returned to Austria after being absent for six decades. Over the next few years, the Empress made several visits to her former Austrian homeland and even appeared on Austrian television. In a series of interviews with the Viennese tabloid newspaper &quot;Kronen Zeitung&quot;, Zita expressed her belief that the deaths of Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria and his mistress Baroness Mary Vetsera, at Mayerling, in 1889, were not a double suicide but rather murder by French or Austrian agents.

===Death===

After a memorable 90th birthday, at which she was surrounded by her now vast family, Zita&#x27;s habitually-robust health began to fail. She developed inoperable cataracts in both eyes. Her last major family gathering took place at Zizers, in 1987, when her children and grandchildren joined in celebrating her 95th birthday. While visiting her daughter, in summer 1988, she developed pneumonia and spent most of the autumn and winter bedridden. Finally, she called Otto in early March 1989 and told him she was dying. He and the rest of the family travelled to her bedside and took turns keeping her company until she died in the early hours of 14 March 1989. She was 96 years old, and was the last surviving child of Robert, Duke of Parma from both his marriages.

Her funeral was held in Vienna on 1 April. The government allowed it to take place on Austrian soil if the cost was borne by the Habsburgs themselves. Zita&#x27;s body was carried to the Imperial Crypt under Capuchin Church in the same funeral coach she had walked behind during the funeral of Emperor Franz Joseph in 1916. It was attended by over 200 members of the Habsburg and Bourbon-Parma families, and the service had 6,000 attendees including leading politicians, state officials and international representatives, including a representative of Pope John Paul II. Following an ancient custom, the Empress had asked that her heart, which was placed in an urn, stay behind at Muri Abbey, in Switzerland, where the Emperor&#x27;s heart had rested for decades. In doing so, Zita assured herself that in death, she and her husband would remain by each other&#x27;s side.

When the procession of mourners arrived at the gates of the Imperial Crypt, the herald who knocked on the door during the traditional &quot;admission ceremony&quot; introduced her as &quot;Zita, Her Majesty the Empress and Queen&quot;.

==Cause of beatification and canonization ==

On 10 December 2009, Mgr Yves Le Saux, Bishop of Le Mans, France, opened the diocesan process for the beatification of Zita. Zita was in the habit of spending several months each year in the diocese of Le Mans at St. Cecilia&#x27;s Abbey, Solesmes, where three of her sisters were nuns.

The actor is the French Association pour la Béatification de l&#x27;Impératrice Zita. The postulator for the cause is Alexander Leonhardt. Vice postulator for Hungary is Catholic theologian Norbert Nagy. The judge of the tribunal is Bruno Bonnet. The promoter of justice is François Scrive.

With the opening of her cause, the late Empress has been named Servant of God.

<doc id="152547" wikidata="Q3128632" url="?curid=152547" title="Bisection">
<text>In geometry, bisection is the division of something into two equal or congruent parts (having the same shape and size). Usually it involves a bisecting line, also called a &quot;bisector&quot;. The most often considered types of bisectors are the &quot;segment bisector&quot;, a line that passes through the midpoint of a given segment, and the &quot;angle bisector&quot;, a line that passes through the apex of an angle (that divides it into two equal angles).
In three-dimensional space, bisection is usually done by a bisecting plane, also called the &quot;bisector&quot;.

== Perpendicular line segment bisector ==
=== Definition ===

*The perpendicular bisector of a line segment is a line which meets the segment at its midpoint perpendicularly.
*The perpendicular bisector of a line segment formula_1 also has the property that each of its points formula_2 is equidistant from segment AB&#x27;s endpoints:
(D)formula_3.
The proof follows from formula_4 and Pythagoras&#x27; theorem:
:formula_5

Property (D) is usually used for the construction of a perpendicular bisector:

=== Construction by straight edge and compass ===

In classical geometry, the bisection is a simple compass and straightedge construction, whose possibility depends on the ability to draw arcs of equal radii and different centers:

The segment formula_1 is bisected by drawing intersecting circles of equal radius formula_7, whose centers are the endpoints of the segment. The line determined by the points of intersection of the two circles is the perpendicular bisector of the segment.&lt;br&gt; 
Because the construction of the bisector is done without the knowledge of the segment&#x27;s midpoint formula_8, the construction is used for determining formula_8 as the intersection of the bisector and the line segment.

This construction is in fact used when constructing a &quot;line perpendicular to a given line&quot; formula_10 at a &quot;given point&quot; formula_11: drawing a circle whose center is formula_11 such that it intersects the line formula_10 in two points formula_14, and the perpendicular to be constructed is the one bisecting segment formula_1.

=== Equations ===
If formula_16 are the position vectors of two points formula_14, then its midpoint is formula_18 and vector formula_19 is a normal vector of the perpendicular line segment bisector. Hence its vector equation is formula_20. Inserting formula_21 and expanding the equation leads to the vector equation

(V) formula_22

With formula_23 one gets the equation in coordinate form:

(C) formula_24

Or explicitly:&lt;br&gt;
(E)formula_25, &lt;br&gt;
where formula_26, formula_27, and formula_28.

=== Applications ===
Perpendicular line segment bisectors were used solving various geometric problems:
#Construction of the center of a Thales&#x27; circle,
#Construction of the center of the Excircle of a triangle,
#Voronoi diagram boundaries consist of segments of such lines or planes.

=== Perpendicular line segment bisectors in space ===
*The perpendicular bisector of a line segment is a &quot;plane&quot;, which meets the segment at its midpoint perpendicularly. 
Its vector equation is literally the same as in the plane case:

(V) formula_22

With formula_30 one gets the equation in coordinate form:

(C3) formula_31

Property (D) (see above) is literally true in space, too:&lt;br&gt;
(D) The perpendicular bisector plane of a segment formula_1 has for any point formula_2 the property: formula_34.

==Angle bisector==
An angle bisector divides the angle into two angles with equal measures. An angle only has one bisector. Each point of an angle bisector is equidistant from the sides of the angle.

The &#x27;interior&#x27; or &#x27;internal bisector&#x27; of an angle is the line, half-line, or line segment that divides an angle of less than 180° into two equal angles. The &#x27;exterior&#x27; or &#x27;external bisector&#x27; is the line that divides the supplementary angle (of 180° minus the original angle), formed by one side forming the original angle and the extension of the other side, into two equal angles.

To bisect an angle with straightedge and compass, one draws a circle whose center is the vertex. The circle meets the angle at two points: one on each leg. Using each of these points as a center, draw two circles of the same size. The intersection of the circles (two points) determines a line that is the angle bisector.

The proof of the correctness of this construction is fairly intuitive, relying on the symmetry of the problem. The trisection of an angle (dividing it into three equal parts) cannot be achieved with the compass and ruler alone (this was first proved by Pierre Wantzel).

The internal and external bisectors of an angle are perpendicular. If the angle is formed by the two lines given algebraically as formula_35 and formula_36 then the internal and external bisectors are given by the two equations

:formula_37

==Triangle ==
===Concurrencies and collinearities===
The bisectors of two exterior angles and the bisector of the other interior angle are concurrent.

Three intersection points, each of an external angle bisector with the opposite extended side, are collinear (fall on the same line as each other).

Three intersection points, two of them between an interior angle bisector and the opposite side, and the third between the other exterior angle bisector and the opposite side extended, are collinear.

==== Angle bisector theorem ====
The angle bisector theorem is concerned with the relative lengths of the two segments that a triangle&#x27;s side is divided into by a line that bisects the opposite angle. It equates their relative lengths to the relative lengths of the other two sides of the triangle.

====Lengths====

If the side lengths of a triangle are formula_38, the semiperimeter formula_39 and A is the angle opposite side formula_40, then the length of the internal bisector of angle A is

:formula_41

or in trigonometric terms,

:formula_42

If the internal bisector of angle A in triangle ABC has length formula_43 and if this bisector divides the side opposite A into segments of lengths &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot;, then

:formula_44

where &quot;b&quot; and &quot;c&quot; are the side lengths opposite vertices B and C; and the side opposite A is divided in the proportion &quot;b&quot;:&quot;c&quot;.

If the internal bisectors of angles A, B, and C have lengths formula_45 and formula_46, then

:formula_47

No two non-congruent triangles share the same set of three internal angle bisector lengths.

====Integer triangles====

There exist integer triangles with a rational angle bisector.

===Quadrilateral===

The internal angle bisectors of a convex quadrilateral either form a cyclic quadrilateral (that is, the four intersection points of adjacent angle bisectors are concyclic), or they are concurrent. In the latter case the quadrilateral is a tangential quadrilateral.

====Rhombus====

Each diagonal of a rhombus bisects opposite angles.

====Ex-tangential quadrilateral====

The excenter of an ex-tangential quadrilateral lies at the intersection of six angle bisectors. These are the internal angle bisectors at two opposite vertex angles, the external angle bisectors (supplementary angle bisectors) at the other two vertex angles, and the external angle bisectors at the angles formed where the extensions of opposite sides intersect.

===Parabola===

The tangent to a parabola at any point bisects the angle between the line joining the point to the focus and the line from the point and perpendicular to the directrix.

==Bisectors of the sides of a polygon==

===Triangle===

====Medians====

Each of the three medians of a triangle is a line segment going through one vertex and the midpoint of the opposite side, so it bisects that side (though not in general perpendicularly). The three medians intersect each other at a point which is called the centroid of the triangle, which is its center of mass if it has uniform density; thus any line through a triangle&#x27;s centroid and one of its vertices bisects the opposite side. The centroid is twice as close to the midpoint of any one side as it is to the opposite vertex.

====Perpendicular bisectors====

The interior perpendicular bisector of a side of a triangle is the segment, falling entirely on and inside the triangle, of the line that perpendicularly bisects that side. The three perpendicular bisectors of a triangle&#x27;s three sides intersect at the circumcenter (the center of the circle through the three vertices). Thus any line through a triangle&#x27;s circumcenter and perpendicular to a side bisects that side.

In an acute triangle the circumcenter divides the interior perpendicular bisectors of the two shortest sides in equal proportions. In an obtuse triangle the two shortest sides&#x27; perpendicular bisectors (extended beyond their opposite triangle sides to the circumcenter) are divided by their respective intersecting triangle sides in equal proportions.

For any triangle the interior perpendicular bisectors are given by formula_48 formula_49 and formula_50 where the sides are formula_51 and the area is formula_52

===Quadrilateral===

The two bimedians of a convex quadrilateral are the line segments that connect the midpoints of opposite sides, hence each bisecting two sides. The two bimedians and the line segment joining the midpoints of the diagonals are concurrent at a point called the &quot;vertex centroid&quot; and are all bisected by this point.

The four &quot;maltitudes&quot; of a convex quadrilateral are the perpendiculars to a side through the midpoint of the opposite side, hence bisecting the latter side. If the quadrilateral is cyclic (inscribed in a circle), these maltitudes are concurrent at (all meet at) a common point called the &quot;anticenter&quot;.

Brahmagupta&#x27;s theorem states that if a cyclic quadrilateral is orthodiagonal (that is, has perpendicular diagonals), then the perpendicular to a side from the point of intersection of the diagonals always bisects the opposite side.

The perpendicular bisector construction forms a quadrilateral from the perpendicular bisectors of the sides of another quadrilateral.

==Area bisectors and perimeter bisectors==

===Triangle===

There is an infinitude of lines that bisect the area of a triangle. Three of them are the medians of the triangle (which connect the sides&#x27; midpoints with the opposite vertices), and these are concurrent at the triangle&#x27;s centroid; indeed, they are the only area bisectors that go through the centroid. Three other area bisectors are parallel to the triangle&#x27;s sides; each of these intersects the other two sides so as to divide them into segments with the proportions formula_53. These six lines are concurrent three at a time: in addition to the three medians being concurrent, any one median is concurrent with two of the side-parallel area bisectors.

The envelope of the infinitude of area bisectors is a deltoid (broadly defined as a figure with three vertices connected by curves that are concave to the exterior of the deltoid, making the interior points a non-convex set). The vertices of the deltoid are at the midpoints of the medians; all points inside the deltoid are on three different area bisectors, while all points outside it are on just one. 
The sides of the deltoid are arcs of hyperbolas that are asymptotic to the extended sides of the triangle. The ratio of the area of the envelope of area bisectors to the area of the triangle is invariant for all triangles, and equals formula_54 i.e. 0.019860... or less than 2%.

A cleaver of a triangle is a line segment that bisects the perimeter of the triangle and has one endpoint at the midpoint of one of the three sides. The three cleavers concur at (all pass through) the center of the Spieker circle, which is the incircle of the medial triangle. The cleavers are parallel to the angle bisectors.

A splitter of a triangle is a line segment having one endpoint at one of the three vertices of the triangle and bisecting the perimeter. The three splitters concur at the Nagel point of the triangle.

Any line through a triangle that splits both the triangle&#x27;s area and its perimeter in half goes through the triangle&#x27;s incenter (the center of its incircle). There are either one, two, or three of these for any given triangle. A line through the incenter bisects one of the area or perimeter if and only if it also bisects the other.

===Parallelogram===

Any line through the midpoint of a parallelogram bisects the area and the perimeter.

===Circle and ellipse===

All area bisectors and perimeter bisectors of a circle or other ellipse go through the center, and any chords through the center bisect the area and perimeter. In the case of a circle they are the diameters of the circle.

==Bisectors of diagonals==

===Parallelogram===

The diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other.

===Quadrilateral===

If a line segment connecting the diagonals of a quadrilateral bisects both diagonals, then this line segment (the Newton Line) is itself bisected by the vertex centroid.

==Volume bisectors==

A plane that divides two opposite edges of a tetrahedron in a given ratio also divides the volume of the tetrahedron in the same ratio. Thus any plane containing a bimedian (connector of opposite edges&#x27; midpoints) of a tetrahedron bisects the volume of the tetrahedron

<text>Maria Duce (Latin for &quot;With Mary as our Leader&quot;) was a small Catholic Integrist group active in Ireland, founded in 1942 by Fr Denis Fahey.
==History==
Like its founder, Maria Duce was avowedly anti-communist. Through their front organisation, &#x27;Catholic Cinema and Theatre Patrons Association&#x27; (CCTPA), they picketed a visit by film star Danny Kaye and campaigned against visits by actor Gregory Peck and writer/director Orson Welles, all of whom they accused of being communists. Also, like its founder, the group espoused antisemitic views.

The group&#x27;s principal aim was to embed Catholic doctrine in the legal structure of the Irish state, including recognition of the Catholic Church as the established church of Ireland, as it had been in Spain until 1931. This latter step had been contemplated during the drafting of Éamon de Valera&#x27;s 1937 Constitution of Ireland, but it was ultimately rejected in recognition of the obstacle posed by Ireland&#x27;s relatively large Protestant minority and due to aspirations for Irish unity and the detrimental effects such a clause would have on the unionist population in Northern Ireland. It did emphasise the &quot;special position&quot; of the church, with no specific legal entitlements.

Though Maria Duce&#x27;s membership probably did not much exceed one hundred, its monthly journal &quot;Fiat&quot; enjoyed a fairly wide circulation in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The movement was not encouraged by the Irish bishops, who viewed its extremism with suspicion and desired not to become associated with Fr. Fahey&#x27;s writings and statements. It was ordered to change its name by the Church authorities in 1955, a year after Fahey&#x27;s death, by the Archbishop of Dublin, John Charles McQuaid (a former pupil of Fahey&#x27;s and a fellow member of the Holy Ghost Fathers), in order to make it clear that it did not have official Church approval. As Fírinne [Irish for &quot;truth&quot;] it remained in existence until the early 1970s, publishing &quot;FIAT&quot; and organising pilgrimages to Fr. Fahey&#x27;s grave in the belief that he would one day be canonised as a saint.

John Ryan, the long time editor of &quot;The Irish Catholic&quot; Newspaper, was secretary of Maria Duce for a time. The IRA member Sean South (killed in the 1950s border campaign) founded a local branch of Maria Duce in Limerick.

<doc id="152552" wikidata="Q381750" url="?curid=152552" title="Aerospike engine">
<text>The aerospike engine is a type of rocket engine that maintains its aerodynamic efficiency across a wide range of altitudes. It belongs to the class of altitude compensating nozzle engines. Aerospike engines were proposed for many single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) designs. They were a contender for the Space Shuttle main engine. However, as of 2023 no such engine was in commercial production, although some large-scale aerospikes were in testing phases.

The term &quot;aerospike&quot; was originally used for a truncated plug nozzle with a rough conical taper and some gas injection, forming an &quot;air spike&quot; to help make up for the absence of the plug tail. However, a full-length plug nozzle may also be called an aerospike.

==Principles==
The purpose of any engine bell is to direct the exhaust of a rocket engine in one direction, generating thrust in the opposite direction. The exhaust, a high-temperature mix of gases, has an effectively random momentum distribution (i.e., the exhaust pushes in any direction it can). If the exhaust is allowed to escape in this form, only a small part of the flow will be moving in the correct direction and thus contribute to forward thrust. The bell redirects exhaust moving in the wrong direction so that it generates thrust in the correct direction. Ambient air pressure also imparts a small pressure against the exhaust, helping to keep it moving in the &quot;right&quot; direction as it exits the engine. As the vehicle travels upward through the atmosphere, ambient air pressure is reduced. This causes the thrust-generating exhaust to begin to expand outside the edge of the bell. Since this exhaust begins traveling in the &quot;wrong&quot; direction (i.e., outward from the main exhaust plume), the efficiency of the engine is reduced as the rocket travels because this escaping exhaust is no longer contributing to the thrust of the engine. An aerospike rocket engine seeks to eliminate this loss of efficiency.

Instead of firing the exhaust out of a small hole in the middle of a bell, an aerospike engine avoids this random distribution by firing along the outside edge of a wedge-shaped protrusion, the &quot;spike&quot;, which serves the same function as a traditional engine bell. The spike forms one side of a &quot;virtual&quot; bell, with the other side being formed by the outside air.

The idea behind the aerospike design is that at low altitude the ambient pressure compresses the exhaust against the spike. Exhaust recirculation in the base zone of the spike can raise the pressure in that zone to nearly ambient. Since the pressure in front of the vehicle is ambient, this means that the exhaust at the base of the spike nearly balances out with the drag experienced by the vehicle. It gives no overall thrust, but this part of the nozzle also doesn&#x27;t &quot;lose&quot; thrust by forming a partial vacuum. The thrust at the base part of the nozzle can be ignored at low altitude.

As the vehicle climbs to higher altitudes, the air pressure holding the exhaust against the spike decreases, as does the drag in front of the vehicle. The recirculation zone at the base of the spike maintains the pressure in that zone to a fraction of 1 bar, higher than the near-vacuum in front of the vehicle, thus giving extra thrust as altitude increases. This effectively behaves like an &quot;altitude compensator&quot; in that the size of the bell automatically compensates as air pressure falls.

The disadvantages of aerospikes seem to be extra weight for the spike. Furthermore, the larger cooled area can reduce performance below theoretical levels by reducing the pressure against the nozzle. Aerospikes work relatively poorly between Mach 1–3, where the airflow around the vehicle has reduced the pressure, thus reducing the thrust.

===Variations===
Several versions of the design exist, differentiated by their shapes. In the toroidal aerospike the spike is bowl-shaped with the exhaust exiting in a ring around the outer rim. In theory this requires an infinitely long spike for best efficiency, but by blowing a small amount of gas out of the center of a shorter truncated spike (like base bleed in an artillery shell), something similar can be achieved.

In the linear aerospike the spike consists of a tapered wedge-shaped plate, with exhaust exiting on either side at the &quot;thick&quot; end. This design has the advantage of being stackable, allowing several smaller engines to be placed in a row to make one larger engine while augmenting steering performance with the use of individual engine throttle control.

==Performance==

Rocketdyne conducted a lengthy series of tests in the 1960s on various designs. Later models of these engines were based on their highly reliable J-2 engine machinery and provided the same sort of thrust levels as the conventional engines they were based on; 200,000 lbf (890 kN) in the J-2T-200k, and 250,000 lbf (1.1 MN) in the J-2T-250k (the T refers to the toroidal combustion chamber). Thirty years later their work was revived for use in NASA&#x27;s X-33 project. In this case the slightly upgraded J-2S engine machinery was used with a linear spike, creating the XRS-2200. After more development and considerable testing, this project was cancelled when the X-33&#x27;s composite fuel tanks repeatedly failed.

Three XRS-2200 engines were built during the X-33 program and underwent testing at NASA&#x27;s Stennis Space Center. The single-engine tests were a success, but the program was halted before the testing for the two-engine setup could be completed. The XRS-2200 produces thrust with an Isp of 339 seconds at sea level, and thrust with an Isp of 436.5 seconds in a vacuum.

The RS-2200 Linear Aerospike Engine was derived from the XRS-2200. The RS-2200 was to power the VentureStar single-stage-to-orbit vehicle. In the latest design, seven RS-2200s producing each would boost the VentureStar into low Earth orbit. The development on the RS-2200 was formally halted in early 2001 when the X-33 program did not receive Space Launch Initiative funding. Lockheed Martin chose to not continue the VentureStar program without any funding support from NASA. An engine of this type is on outdoor display on the grounds of the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville Alabama.
The cancellation of the Lockheed Martin X-33 by the federal government in 2001 decreased funding availability, but aerospike engines remain an area of active research. For example, a milestone was achieved when a joint academic/industry team from California State University, Long Beach (CSULB) and Garvey Spacecraft Corporation successfully conducted a flight test of a liquid-propellant powered aerospike engine in the Mojave Desert on September 20, 2003. CSULB students had developed their Prospector 2 (P-2) rocket using a 1,000 lbf (4.4 kN) LOX/ethanol aerospike engine. This work on aerospike engines continues; Prospector-10, a ten-chamber aerospike engine, was test-fired June 25, 2008.

Further progress came in March 2004 when two successful tests sponsored by the NASA Dryden Flight Research Center using high-power rockets manufactured by Blacksky Corporation, based in Carlsbad, California. The aerospike nozzles and solid rocket motors were developed and built by the rocket motor division of Cesaroni Technology Incorporated, north of Toronto, Ontario. The two rockets were solid-fuel powered and fitted with non-truncated toroidal aerospike nozzles. Flown at the Pecos County Aerospace Development Center, Fort Stockton, Texas, the rockets achieved apogees of and speeds of about Mach 1.5.

Small-scale aerospike engine development using a hybrid rocket propellant configuration has been ongoing by members of the Reaction Research Society.

In 2020 the TU Dresden and Fraunhofer IWS started their CFDμSAT-Project for research on additively manufactured aerospike-engines. A prototype has already been tested in a test cell at TU Dresden&#x27;s Institute of Aerospace Engineering, achieving a
burn time of 30 seconds.

== Implementations ==
=== Firefly Aerospace ===
In July 2014 Firefly Space Systems announced its planned Alpha launcher that uses an aerospike engine for its first stage. Intended for the small satellite launch market, it is designed to launch satellites into low-Earth orbit (LEO) at a price of US$8–9 million, much lower than with conventional launchers.

Firefly Alpha 1.0 was designed to carry payloads of up to . It uses carbon composite materials and uses the same basic design for both stages. The plug-cluster aerospike engine puts out of thrust. The engine has a bell-shaped nozzle that has been cut in half, then stretched to form a ring with the half-nozzle now forming the profile of a plug.

This rocket design was never launched. The design was abandoned after Firefly Space Systems went bankrupt. A new company, Firefly Aerospace, has replaced the aerospike engine with a conventional engine in the Alpha 2.0 design. However, the company has proposed Firefly Gamma, a partially reusable spaceplane with aerospike engines.

=== ARCA Space ===
In March 2017 ARCA Space Corporation announced their intention to build a single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) rocket, named Haas 2CA, using a linear aerospike engine. The rocket is designed to send up to 100 kg into low-Earth orbit, at a price of US$1 million per launch. They later announced that their Executor Aerospike engine would produce of thrust at sea level and of thrust in a vacuum.

In June 2017, ARCA announced that they would fly their Demonstrator3 rocket to space, also using a linear aerospike engine. This rocket was designed to test several components of their Haas 2CA at lower cost. They announced a flight for August 2017. In September 2017, ARCA announced that, after being delayed, their linear aerospike engine was ready to perform ground tests and flight tests on a Demonstrator3 rocket.

On December 20, 2019, ARCA tested the LAS 25DA aerospike steam rocket engine for the Launch Assist System.

===KSF Space and Interstellar Space===
Another spike engine concept model, by KSF Space and Interstellar Space in Los Angeles, was designed for orbital vehicle named SATORI. Due to lack of funding, the concept is still undeveloped.

=== Rocketstar ===
Rocketstar planned to launch its 3D-printed aerospike rocket to an altitude of 50 miles in February 2019 but canceled the mission three days ahead of liftoff citing safety concerns. They are working on a second launch attempt.

=== Pangea Aerospace ===
In November 2021, Spain-based Pangea Aerospace began hot-fire testing of its small-scale demonstration methane-oxygen aerospike engine DemoP1.
After successfully testing the demonstrator DemoP1, Pangea plans to up-scale to the 300 kN ARCOS engine.

Headquartered in Kent, Washington, Stoke Space is building and testing a distributed architecture LH2/LOX aerospike system for its reusable second stage.

=== Polaris Spaceplanes ===
The Bremen-based German startup POLARIS Raumflugzeuge GmbH received a Bundeswehr contract to design and flight test a linear aerospike engine in April 2023. The company is set to test this new engine on board of its fourth spaceplane demonstrator, DEMO-4 MIRA, in late 2023 at Peenemünde, where the V-2 rockets were developed.

The original MIRA demonstrator was catastrophically damaged in a runway accident in February 2024.

On 29 October 2024, the company was the first ever to ignite an aerospike engine in a flight over the Baltic Sea, powering a four-engine, kerosene-fueled, turbojet MIRA-II demonstrator. The test involved a three-second burn to collect data with minimal engine stress. The vehicle achieved an acceleration of 4 m/s², producing 900 newtons of thrust.

=== Bath Rocket Team ===
Based at the University of Bath, the Bath Rocket Team has been developing their own hybrid rocket engine with an aerospike nozzle since 2020. The engine was first tested at the UK Race to Space National Propulsion Competition in 2023. The team is developing a flight-ready version of the engine they are planning to fly for the first time at EuRoC24. 

=== SpaceFields ===
SpaceFields, incubated at IISc, has successfully tested India&#x27;s first AeroSpike Rocket Engine at its Challakere facility on 11-Sep-2024. The engine achieved a peak thrust of 2000N and featured altitude compensation for optimal efficiency.
=== LEAP 71 ===

LEAP 71 a company based in Dubai, successfully hot fired a 5000N Aerospike powered by cryogenic liquid oxygen (LOX) and Kerosene at the test stand of Airborne Engineering in Westcott, UK. The engine was created through the Noyron Large Computational Engineering Model, and 3D-printed using Selective Laser Melting as a single monolithic part from copper (CuCrZr). The central spike was cooled using LOX, whereas the outer jacket was cooled using the Kerosene fuel.

<doc id="152553" wikidata="Q7205262" url="?curid=152553" title="Plug nozzle">
<text>The plug nozzle is a type of nozzle which includes a centerbody or plug around which the working fluid flows. Plug nozzles have applications in aircraft, rockets, and numerous other fluid flow devices.

==Hoses==
Common garden hose trigger nozzles are a simple example of the plug nozzle and its method of operation. In this example the nozzle consists of a conical or bell shaped opening with a plug on a movable rod positioned in front of the nozzle. The plug looks similar to a poppet valve. The stem of the valve runs back through the body of the nozzle body to a &quot;trigger&quot;, normally a long lever running down the back of the nozzle assembly. A spring keeps the valve pressed against the opening under normal use, thereby providing a failsafe cut-off that stops the flow of water when the nozzle is dropped.

When water is supplied to the hose, it flows through the nozzle body to the opening, where it would normally flow straight forward in a stream. Just after leaving the opening it encounters the plug, which deflects the water sideways through an angle. After travelling a short distance the water encounters the outside of the nozzle opening, which deflects it forward again. This two-step process causes the water to be ejected in a ring-shaped pattern, which causes less water to strike any one location, and thereby reduces erosion while also making it easier to water larger areas.

The shaping of the plug and the nozzle opening allows the angle of the ring to be adjusted. Normally this is shaped so that when the plug is pulled back toward the opening it both partially cuts off the water flow, as well as causing it to spread out to the widest possible angle. This can be used for &quot;misting&quot; plants. When the trigger is pushed down further, the plug moves away from the opening, causing less blockage and disruption of the flow, ultimately allowing the water to form back into a stream.

==In rockets==
Plug nozzles belong to a class of altitude compensating nozzles, much like the aerospike, which, unlike traditional designs, maintains its efficiency at a wide range of altitudes.

Similar to the garden hose example, plug nozzles use a shaped rocket nozzle with a poppet-shaped plug to allow the pattern of the rocket exhaust to be changed. This is used to adjust for changes in altitude; at lower altitudes the plug is pulled back to cause the exhaust to spread out, while at higher altitudes the lower air pressure will cause this to happen naturally. An alternative construction for the same basic concept is to use two nozzles, one inside the other, and adjust the distance between them. This pattern has the advantage of better control over the exhaust and simpler cooling arrangements.

Confusingly, the term &quot;plug nozzle&quot; may also be used to refer to an entirely different class of engine nozzles, the aerospikes. In theory the aerospike should look roughly like a lance, with a wide base and long tapering forebody. However, the &quot;spike&quot; portion can be cut off with only minor effects on performance, leaving just the base section. This looks very similar to a common drain plug or bung, and leads to widespread use of the term &quot;plug nozzle&quot; for this design as well.

==In aircraft and missiles==

The jet-engine plug nozzle has its origins in rocketry but has also been studied over the years, but not used, for supersonic cruise aircraft such as the Boeing SST, the proposed General Electric Variable Cycle Engine, with its acoustic plug nozzle, and Concorde. However, it was used for the AGM-28 Hound Dog missile and the Tu-144 airliner. The plug / &quot;external-expanding&quot; nozzle has a central plug and a freely-expanding supersonic jet rather than a diverging cone surface to contain the internal supersonic expansion as in a delaval convergent-divergent nozzle (con-di) nozzle. The Pratt &amp; Whitney J52 aircraft engine used in the supersonic AGM-28 Hound Dog missile used a plug nozzle which performed better over the missile&#x27;s flight envelope than either a convergent or a con-di nozzle. A translating center-body was used on the non-afterburning Kolesov RD-36-51A engine used for the Tupolev Tu-144D supersonic airliner. The center-body was perforated and compressed air forced into the exhaust jet through the perforations to attenuate the noise. 
Weight and cooling are typical concerns with aircraft plug nozzles. A plug nozzle design evaluated at the National Gas Turbine Establishment was rejected for the Concorde engine due to the weight penalty from the required variable features and concerns about adequate plug cooling during reheat operation. 
Plug nozzle model tests have shown reduced noise levels compared to traditional con-di nozzles.

Propelling nozzles for subsonic aircraft have used a center-body/bullet/cone to give the nozzle exit area required to set an axial compressor running-line correctly on its map. The first operational German turbojet engines with axial compressors, the Jumo 004 and BMW 003, needed a different exhaust nozzle areas for running properly at each of the operating regimes: start/idle, climb, high speed, high altitude. A nozzle with a fore/aft-translating &quot;bullet&quot; restrictive body in the center was chosen for each design. It provided area control with relatively simple actuation and matched the annular shape of the turbine exhaust.

<text>DEA Deutsche Erdoel AG was an international oil and gas company headquartered in Hamburg, Germany. It was a subsidiary of L1 Energy. In 2018, DEA owned stakes in oil and gas licenses in various countries and operated natural gas underground storage facilities in Germany. DEA is a derivation from &quot;Deutsche Erdöl-Aktiengesellschaft&quot;, the original name of the company. On 1 May 2019, DEA merged with Wintershall to form Wintershall Dea.

== History ==
=== The early years ===

&quot;Deutsche Tiefbohr-Actiengesellschaft&quot; was founded in Berlin on 10 January 1899. In 1900 the headquarter was relocated to Nordhausen. The new company specialised in all types of mineral oil product and, among other things, raw lignite, briquettes for domestic heating and industry, lignite tar and paraffin. Its managing director was the Krefeld businessman Rudolf Nöllenburg.
It first struck oil with a well of its own in 1901, in 1906 crude oil is officially declared the new main business. Since 1907 the companies headquarters were again moved to Berlin. In 1911, &quot;DTA&quot; and its subsidiary &quot;Vereinigte Norddeutsche Mineralölwerke AG&quot; were merged with &quot;Deutsche Mineralölindustrie AG&quot; to create &quot;Deutsche Erdoel-Actiengesellschaft (DEA)&quot;, based in Berlin.
DEA had stakes in oil fields in Alsace, Austria-Hungary and Romania from 1905/1906, but lost most of its foreign production when the World War I broke out. However, DEA drilled the world&#x27;s first oil shaft – in Pechelbronn in Alsace – in 1917. Unlike extraction close to the surface or by means of wells, this involved the first-ever application of the complex shaft construction method, in which oil is “mined”. However, domestic oil production was not able to secure the company&#x27;s survival and so DEA focused on coal mining until the early 1930s.

=== The Third Reich ===
DEA benefited from the seizure of power by the National Socialists, such as in the form of loans under the &quot;Reich Drilling Programme&quot; from 1934 onwards. Greater self-sufficiency in German&#x27;s supply of raw materials had been an official goal of the National Socialist state since Adolf Hitler&#x27;s Four-Year Plan Memorandum in 1936. The company began production operations in Czechoslovakia and in Alsace by participating in consortia such as Kontinentale Öl AG, which was founded in 1941. In 1937/1938, Jewish members were excluded from the management board and supervisory board. DEA also employed forced labourers on a large scale. The precise ties between company management and the NS regime have not yet been investigated.
At the time, the company&#x27;s business activities covered a large part of the production and supply chain: extraction, processing and utilisation of mineral oil products and their resale, acquisition of and trading in mining rights, and the manufacture of mining machinery and equipment.
In 1943, its subsidiaries and equity interests included &quot;Deutscher Mineralöl-Verkaufsverein GmbH&quot; in Berlin, &quot;Deutsche Viscobil Oel GmbH&quot; in Berlin and Braunkohle-Benzin AG (BRABAG) in Berlin.
Its hard coal operations in 1938 comprised the Graf Bismarck Colliery in Gelsenkirchen and the Königsgrube Colliery in Wanne-Eickel. Lignite operations were grouped at the Borna branch in the administrative district of Leipzig and consisted of various lignite works, briquette factories, an earthenware factory and a brick factory in the region.

=== Post-war era ===
The company was relocated to Hamburg in 1948. NITAG&#x27;s headquarters at Mittelweg in the Hamburg district of Rotherbaum were closed as a result of the merger between Gasolin and Wintershall&#x27;s subsidiary NITAG. DEA then moved into them. Its headquarters were then moved to Hamburg City Nord around 1970.
DEA developed various new fields in Germany as part of expansion of domestic oil production in the 1950s. In 1956, Wintershall and DEA contributed Deutsche Gasolin to Aral. However, DEA left the Aral Group in 1960 in order to build its own service station network.
In 1963 an employee of DEA, Rudolf Dittrich, and his team in Wieze were instrumental in rescuing 14 miners who were trapped for many days in a collapsed coal mine in Lengede, Lower Saxony. They did so, together with others, by applying very innovative drilling techniques. The successful effort is commonly known in German history as the “Miracle of Lengede” (Wunder von Lengede). By 1965, the DEA Group was generating revenue of DM 2.01 billion and had 26,400 employees. Texaco took over more than 90% of the shares in DEA in 1966. DEA became &quot;Deutsche Texaco AG&quot; in 1970. The mines it owned were contributed to &quot;Ruhrkohle AG (RAG)&quot; around 1970.

=== Acquisition, restructuring and sale by RWE ===
The takeover of &quot;Deutsche Texaco&quot; by RWE AG in 1988 created &quot;RWE-DEA Aktiengesellschaft für Mineraloel und Chemie&quot;. From then on, the company&#x27;s service stations once more bore the name “DEA”. After German reunification, the service station network was expanded to Eastern Germany.
The chemicals division &quot;Condea&quot; was sold to the South African company Sasol in 2001. The joint venture &quot;Fuchs Dea Schmierstoffe GmbH &amp; Co. KG&quot; between the partners Fuchs Petrolub AG and &quot;DEA Mineraloel AG&quot; was terminated effective 31 December 2001. In 2002, the company&#x27;s downstream business (refineries, logistics, service stations) was integrated into a joint venture with Shell named &quot;Shell &amp; DEA Oil GmbH&quot;, which was taken over fully by Shell effective 1 July 2002. Since mid-2002, RWE-Dea has focused on upstream business. From 2004, most of the DEA service stations were reflagged to “Shell”, while some were sold. The last DEA service station in Germany was located in Haltern; Shell AG continued running it so that it could secure the rights to the “DEA” trademark permanently. The service station was closed in 2017 and replaced by an old Shell service station with the DEA branding in Lichtenfels.
In March 2013, RWE announced its intention to sell DEA and use the proceeds to pay some of its €33 billion in debt. RWE received at least three bids in an auction up to the beginning of 2014. One of them came from L1 Energy, a subsidiary of the LetterOne Group. The LetterOne Group is an investment company that is headquartered in Luxembourg and whose main owner (indirectly through the Alfa Group) is the Russian business magnate Mikhail Fridman. RWE reported on 16 March 2014 that it had in principle agreed with LetterOne to sell DEA. RWE Dea was valued at €5.1 billion as part of the deal.
RWE announced on 30 March 2014 that the agreement with the LetterOne Group had been signed. In June, the German Federal Minister for Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel, ordered an examination of the sale, which lasted for two months. The takeover was finally approved by the German government on 22 August 2014. In October 2014, the Financial Times reported that the British Secretary of State for Energy Edward Davey would not agree to the sale in view of the tighter sanctions imposed on Russia. The multi-billion transaction was finally closed, despite the misgivings of the British government, at the start of the first week in March 2015.
== Merger with Wintershall Holding GmbH ==
A binding agreement to merge DEA and Wintershall was published on 27 September 2018. The merger was carried out with official approval in May 2019. It created Europe&#x27;s leading independent gas and oil company. BASF holds 67% of Wintershall Dea and LetterOne holds 33% of the ordinary shares in Wintershall Dea. To consider the value of the midstream business of Wintershall Dea, BASF further received preference shares which results in a current overall participation of BASF of 72.7% in the entire share capital of the company. The preference shares will convert into ordinary shares of the Company on May 1, 2022, or upon an initial public offering, whichever comes earlier.

<doc id="152557" wikidata="Q109053" url="?curid=152557" title="Art Tatum">
<text>Arthur Tatum Jr. (, October 13, 1909 – November 5, 1956), known professionally as &quot;Art Tatum&quot;, was an American jazz pianist who is widely regarded as one of the greatest ever. From early in his career, fellow musicians acclaimed Tatum&#x27;s technical ability as extraordinary. Tatum also extended jazz piano&#x27;s vocabulary and boundaries far beyond his initial stride influences, and established new ground through innovative use of reharmonization, voicing, and bitonality.

Tatum grew up in Toledo, Ohio, where he began playing piano professionally and had his own radio program, rebroadcast nationwide, while still in his teens. He left Toledo in 1932 and had residencies as a solo pianist at clubs in major urban centers including New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles. In that decade, he settled into a pattern he followed for most of his career – paid performances followed by long after-hours playing, all accompanied by prodigious alcohol consumption. He was said to be more spontaneous and creative in such venues, and although the drinking did not hinder his playing, it did damage his health.

In the 1940s, Tatum led a commercially successful trio for a short time and began playing in more formal jazz concert settings, including at Norman Granz–produced Jazz at the Philharmonic events. His popularity diminished towards the end of the decade, as he continued to play in his own style, ignoring the rise of bebop. Granz recorded Tatum extensively in solo and small group formats in the mid-1950s, with the last session only two months before Tatum&#x27;s death from uremia at the age of 47.

==Early life==
Tatum&#x27;s mother, Mildred Hoskins, was born in Martinsville, Virginia, around 1890, and was a domestic worker. His father, Arthur Tatum Sr., was born in Statesville, North Carolina, and had steady employment as a mechanic. In 1909, they made their way from North Carolina to begin a new life in Toledo, Ohio. The couple had four children; Art was the oldest to survive and was born in Toledo on October 13, 1909. He was followed by Arline nine years later and Karl after another two years. Karl went to college and became a social worker. The Tatum family was regarded as conventional and church-going.

From infancy, Tatum had impaired vision. Several explanations for this have been posited, most involving cataracts. As a result of eye operations, by the age of 11, Tatum could see objects close to him and perhaps distinguish colors. Any benefits from these procedures were reversed, however, when he was assaulted, probably in his early twenties. The attack left him completely blind in his left eye and with very limited vision in his right. Despite this, there are multiple accounts of him enjoying playing cards and pool.

Accounts vary on whether Tatum&#x27;s parents played any musical instruments, but it is likely that he was exposed at an early age to church music, including through the Grace Presbyterian Church that his parents attended. He also began the piano at a young age, playing by ear and aided by an excellent memory and sense of pitch. Other musicians reported that he had perfect pitch. As a child he was sensitive to the piano&#x27;s intonation and insisted it be tuned often. He learned tunes from the radio, records, and by copying piano roll recordings. In an interview as an adult, Tatum denied the story that his playing ability developed because he had attempted to reproduce piano roll recordings that, without his knowing, had been made by two performers. His interest in sports was lifelong, and he displayed an encyclopedic memory for baseball statistics.

Tatum first attended Jefferson School in Toledo, then moved to the School for the Blind in Columbus, Ohio, late in 1924. After less than a year, he transferred to the Toledo School of Music. Overton G. Rainey, who gave him formal piano lessons in the classical tradition at either the Jefferson School or the Toledo School of Music, was also visually impaired, did not improvise, and discouraged his students from playing jazz. Based on this history, it is reasonable to assume that Tatum was largely self-taught as a pianist. By the time he was a teenager, Tatum was asked to play at various social events, and he was probably being paid to play in Toledo clubs from around 1924–25.

Growing up, Tatum drew inspiration principally from Fats Waller and James P. Johnson, who exemplified the stride piano style, and to some extent from the more modern Earl Hines, six years Tatum&#x27;s senior. Tatum identified Waller as his biggest influence, while pianist Teddy Wilson and saxophonist Eddie Barefield suggested that Hines was one of his favorite jazz pianists. Another influence was pianist Lee Sims, who did not play jazz, but used chord voicings and an orchestral approach (i.e. encompassing a full sound instead of highlighting one or more timbres) that appeared in Tatum&#x27;s playing.

==Career and adult life==

===1927–1937===
In 1927, after winning an amateur competition, Tatum began playing on Toledo radio station WSPD during interludes in a morning shopping program and soon had his own daily program. After regular club dates, he often visited after-hours clubs to be with other musicians; he enjoyed listening to other pianists and preferred to play after all the others had finished. He frequently played for hours on end into the dawn; his radio show was scheduled for noon, allowing him time to rest before evening performances. During 1928–29, the radio program was rebroadcast nationwide by the Blue Network. Tatum also began to play in larger Midwestern cities outside his home town, including Cleveland, Columbus, and Detroit.

As word of Tatum spread, national performers passing through Toledo, including Duke Ellington and Fletcher Henderson, visited clubs where he was playing. They were impressed by what they heard: from near the start of his career, &quot;his accomplishment [...] was of a different order from what most people, from what even musicians, had ever heard. It made musicians reconsider their definitions of excellence, of what was possible&quot;, his biographer reported. Although Tatum was encouraged by comments from these and other established musicians, he felt that he was not yet, in the late 1920s, musically ready to move to New York City, the center of the jazz world and home to many of the pianists he had listened to growing up.

This had changed by the time that vocalist Adelaide Hall, touring the United States with two pianists, heard Tatum play in Toledo in 1932 and recruited him: he took the opportunity to go to New York as part of her band. On August 5 that year, Hall and her band recorded two sides (&quot;I&#x27;ll Never Be the Same&quot; and &quot;Strange as It Seems&quot;) that were Tatum&#x27;s first studio recordings. Two more sides with Hall followed five days later, as did a solo piano test-pressing of &quot;Tea for Two&quot; that was not released for several decades.

After his arrival in New York, Tatum participated in a cutting contest at Morgan&#x27;s bar in Harlem with the established stride piano masters – Johnson, Waller, and Willie &quot;The Lion&quot; Smith. Standard contest pieces included Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Harlem Strut&quot; and &quot;Carolina Shout&quot; and Waller&#x27;s &quot;Handful of Keys&quot;. Tatum played his arrangements of &quot;Tea for Two&quot; and &quot;Tiger Rag&quot;. Reminiscing about Tatum&#x27;s debut, Johnson said, &quot;When Tatum played &#x27;Tea for Two&#x27; that night I guess that was the first time I ever heard it really &quot;played&quot;.&quot; Tatum thus became the preeminent jazz pianist. He and Waller became good friends, with similar lifestyles: both drank excessively and lived as lavishly as their incomes permitted.
Tatum&#x27;s first solo piano job in New York was at the Onyx Club, which was later reported to have paid him &quot;$45 a week and free whiskey&quot;. The Onyx was one of the first jazz clubs to open on 52nd Street, which became the city&#x27;s focal point for public jazz performance for more than a decade. Tatum recorded his first four released solo sides, for Brunswick Records, in March 1933: &quot;St. Louis Blues&quot;, &quot;Sophisticated Lady&quot;, &quot;Tea for Two&quot;, and &quot;Tiger Rag&quot;. The last of these was a minor hit, impressing the public with its startling tempo of approximately 376 (quarter note) beats per minute, and with right-hand eighth notes adding to the technical feat.

Tatum&#x27;s only known child, Orlando, was born in 1933, when Tatum was 24. The mother was Marnette Jackson, a waitress in Toledo; the pair were not married. It is likely that neither parent had a major role in raising their son, who pursued a military career and died in the 1980s.

During the hard economic times of 1934 and 1935, Tatum mostly played in clubs in Cleveland, but also recorded in New York four times in 1934 and once in 1935. He also performed on national radio, including for the &quot;Fleischman Hour&quot; broadcast hosted by Rudy Vallee in 1935. In August of that year, he married Ruby Arnold, who was from Cleveland. The next month, he began a residence of about a year at the Three Deuces in Chicago, initially as a soloist and then in a quartet of alto saxophone, guitar, and drums.

At the end of his first Three Deuces stint, Tatum moved to California, traveling by train because of his fear of flying. There, he followed the pattern he had adopted early in his career: paid performances followed by long after-hours sessions, all accompanied by prodigious drinking. A friend from his early days in California observed that Tatum drank Pabst Blue Ribbon beer by the case. This lifestyle contributed to the effects of the diabetes that Tatum probably developed as an adult, but, as highlighted by his biographer, James Lester, Tatum would have faced a conflict if he wanted to address his diabetes: &quot;concessions – drastically less beer, a controlled diet, more rest – would have taken away exactly the things that mattered most to him, and would have removed him from the night-life that he seemed to love more than almost anything (afternoon baseball or football games would probably come next)&quot;.

In California, Tatum also played for Hollywood parties and appeared on Bing Crosby&#x27;s radio program late in 1936. He recorded in Los Angeles for the first time early the following year – four tracks as the sextet named Art Tatum and His Swingsters, for Decca Records. Continuing to travel by train, Tatum settled into a pattern of performances at major jazz clubs in Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York interspersed with appearances at minor clubs where musicians of his standing did not normally play. Thus, in 1937 he left Los Angeles for another residence at the Three Deuces in Chicago, and then went on to the Famous Door club in New York, where he opened for Louis Prima. Tatum recorded for Brunswick again near the end of that year.

===1938–1949===
In March 1938, Tatum and his wife embarked on the &quot;Queen Mary&quot; for England. He performed there for three months, and enjoyed the quiet listeners who, unlike some American audiences, did not talk over his playing. While in England, he appeared twice on the BBC Television program &quot;Starlight&quot;. Four of his very limited number of compositions were also published in Britain. He then returned to the Three Deuces. The overseas trip appeared to have boosted his reputation, particularly with the white public, and he was able to have club residencies of at least several weeks at a time in New York over the following few years, sometimes with stipulations that no food or drink be served while he was playing.
Tatum recorded 16 sides in August 1938, but they were not released for at least a decade. A similar thing happened the next year: of the 18 sides he recorded, only two were issued as 78s. A possible explanation is that the increasing popularity of big band music and vocalists limited the demand for solo recordings. One of the releases, a version of &quot;Tea for Two&quot;, was added to the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1986. One recording from early in 1941, however, was commercially successful, with sales of perhaps 500,000. This was &quot;Wee Baby Blues&quot;, performed by a sextet and with the addition of Big Joe Turner on vocals. Informal performances of Tatum&#x27;s playing in 1940 and 1941 were released decades later on the album &quot;God Is in the House&quot;, for which he was posthumously awarded the 1973 Grammy for Best Jazz Performance by a Soloist. The album title came from Waller&#x27;s reaction when he saw Tatum enter the club where Waller was performing: &quot;I only play the piano, but tonight God is in the house.&quot;

Tatum was able to earn a more than adequate living from his club performances. &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine suggested that he could make at least $300 a week as a soloist in 1943; when he formed a trio later that year, it was advertised by booking agents at $750 a week. The other musicians in the trio were guitarist Tiny Grimes and bassist Slam Stewart. They were a commercial success on 52nd Street, attracting more customers than any other musician, with the possible exception of vocalist Billie Holiday, and they also appeared briefly on film, in an episode of &quot;The March of Time&quot;. Up to that point, critics had praised Tatum as a solo pianist, but the paying public had given him relatively little attention; with the trio, he enjoyed more popular success, although some critics expressed disappointment. Nevertheless, Tatum was awarded &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine&#x27;s prize for pianists in its 1944 critics&#x27; poll, which led to his playing alongside other winners at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York.

All of Tatum&#x27;s 1944 studio recordings were with the trio, and radio appearances continued. He abandoned the trio in 1944, possibly at an agent&#x27;s behest, and did not record with one again for eight years. Early in 1945, &quot;Billboard&quot; reported that the Downbeat Club on 52nd Street was paying Tatum $1,150 a week to play four 20-minute sets per night as a soloist. This was described much later as an &quot;unheard-of figure&quot; for the time. The &quot;Billboard&quot; reviewer commented, &quot;Tatum is given a broken-down instrument, some bad lights and nothing else&quot;, and observed that he was almost inaudible beyond the front seating because of the audience noise.
Aided by name recognition from his record sales and reduced entertainer availability because of the World War II draft, Tatum began to play in more formal jazz concert settings in 1944, appearing at concert halls in towns and universities all around the United States. The venues were much larger than jazz clubs – some had capacities in excess of 3,000 people – allowing Tatum to earn more money for much less work. Despite the more formal concert settings, Tatum preferred not to adhere to a set program of pieces for these performances. He recorded with the Barney Bigard Sextet and cut nine solo tracks in 1945.

A fellow pianist from the years after World War II estimated that Tatum routinely drank two quarts (1.9 L) of whiskey and a case of beer over the course of 24 hours. Almost all reports are that such drinking did not hinder his playing. Rather than being deliberately or uncontrollably self-destructive, this habit was probably a product of his being careless about his health, a not uncommon characteristic of jazz musicians, and his enthusiasm for life.

Performances at concert settings continued in the second half of the 1940s, including participation in Norman Granz–produced Jazz at the Philharmonic events. In 1947, Tatum again appeared on film, in &quot;The Fabulous Dorseys&quot;. Columbia Records recorded and released a 1949 concert at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles as &quot;Gene Norman Presents an Art Tatum Concert&quot;. In the same year, he signed to Capitol Records and recorded 26 pieces for it. He also played for the first time at Club Alamo in Detroit, but stopped when a black friend was not served. The owner subsequently advertised that black customers were welcome, and Tatum played there frequently in the next few years.

Although Tatum remained an admired figure, his popularity waned in the mid-to-late 1940s, likely due in large part to the advent of bebop, a musical style he did not embrace.

===1950–1956===
Tatum began working with a trio again in 1951. The trio – this time with bassist Stewart and guitarist Everett Barksdale – recorded in 1952. In the same year, Tatum toured the U.S. with fellow pianists Erroll Garner, Pete Johnson, and Meade Lux Lewis, for concerts billed as &quot;Piano Parade&quot;.
Tatum&#x27;s four-year absence from the recording studios as a soloist ended when Granz, who owned Clef Records, decided to record his solo playing in a way that was &quot;unprecedented in the recording industry: invite him into the studio, start the tape, and let him play whatever he felt like playing. [...] At the time this was an astonishing enterprise, the most extensive recording that had been done of any jazz figure.&quot; Over several sessions starting late in 1953, Tatum recorded 124 solo tracks, all but three of which were released, spread over a total of 14 LPs. Granz reported that the recording tape ran out during one piece, but Tatum, instead of starting again from the beginning, asked to listen to a playback of just the final eight bars, then continued the performance from there on the new tape, keeping to the same tempo as on the first attempt. Clef released the solo pieces as &quot;The Genius of Art Tatum&quot;, which was added to the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1978.

Granz also recorded Tatum with a selection of other stars in seven more recording sessions, which led to 59 tracks being released. The critical reception was mixed and partly contradictory. Tatum was, variously, criticized for not playing real jazz, the choice of material, and being past his best, and praised for the enthralling intricacy and detail of his playing, and his technical perfection. Nevertheless, the releases renewed attention on him, including for a newer generation; he won &quot;DownBeat&quot; magazine&#x27;s critics&#x27; poll for pianists three years in a row from 1954 (he never won a &quot;DownBeat&quot; readers&#x27; poll).

Following a deterioration in his health, Tatum stopped drinking in 1954 and tried to control his weight. That year, his trio was part of bandleader Stan Kenton&#x27;s 10-week tour named &quot;Festival of Modern American Jazz&quot;. The trio did not play with Kenton&#x27;s orchestra on the tour, but had the same performance schedule, meaning Tatum sometimes traveled long distances by overnight train while the others stayed in a hotel and took a morning flight. He also appeared on television in &quot;The Spike Jones Show&quot; on April 17, to promote the imminent release of &quot;The Genius of Art Tatum&quot;. Black American musicians were not often filmed at this time, so very few visual recordings of Tatum exist, but his solo performance of &quot;Yesterdays&quot; on the show has survived as a video recording.

After two decades of marriage, Tatum and Ruby divorced early in 1955. They probably did not travel much together, and she had become an alcoholic; the divorce was acrimonious. Later that year, he married Geraldine Williamson, with whom he had probably already been living. She had little interest in music, and did not normally attend his performances.

By 1956, Tatum&#x27;s health had deteriorated due to advanced uremia. Nevertheless, in August of that year he played to the largest audience of his career: 19,000 gathered at the Hollywood Bowl for another Granz-led event. The next month, he had the last of the Granz group recording sessions, with saxophonist Ben Webster, and then played at least two concerts in October. He was too unwell to continue touring, so returned to his home in Los Angeles. Musicians visited him on November 4, and other pianists played for him as he lay in bed.

Tatum died the next day at Queen of Angels Medical Center in Los Angeles from uremia. He was buried at Rosedale Cemetery in Los Angeles but was moved to the Forest Lawn cemetery in Glendale, California, in 1992 by his second wife, so she could be buried next to him. Tatum was inducted into the &quot;DownBeat&quot; Jazz Hall of Fame in 1964 and given a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1989.

==Personality and habits==
Tatum was independent-minded and generous with his time and money. Not wanting to be restricted by Musicians&#x27; Union rules, he avoided joining for as long as he could. He also disliked having attention drawn to his blindness: he did not want to be physically led and so planned his independent walk to the piano in clubs if possible.

People who met Tatum consistently &quot;describe him as totally lacking in arrogance or ostentation&quot; and as gentlemanly. He avoided discussing his personal life and history in interviews and conversation with acquaintances. Although marijuana use was common among musicians during his lifetime, Tatum was not linked to the use of illegal drugs.

==After hours and repertoire==
Tatum was said to be more spontaneous and creative in free-form nocturnal sessions than in his scheduled performances. Whereas in a professional setting he would often give audiences what they wanted – performances of songs that were similar to his recorded versions – but decline to play encores, in after-hours sessions with friends he would play the blues, improvise for long periods on the same sequence of chords, and move even further away from a composition&#x27;s melody. Tatum also sometimes sang the blues in such settings, accompanying himself on piano. Composer and historian Gunther Schuller describes &quot;a night-weary, sleepy, slurry voice, of lost love and sexual innuendos which would have shocked (and repelled) those &#x27;fans&#x27; who admired Tatum for his musical discipline and &#x27;classical&#x27; [piano] propriety&quot;.

In after-hours performances, Tatum&#x27;s repertoire was much wider than in professional appearances, at which his staples were American popular songs. During his career, he also played his own arrangements of a few classical piano pieces, including Dvořák&#x27;s &quot;Humoresque&quot; and Massenet&#x27;s &quot;Élégie&quot;, and recorded around a dozen blues pieces. Over time, he added to his repertoire – by the late 1940s, most of the new pieces were medium-tempo ballads but also included compositions that presented him with harmonic challenges, such as the simplicity of &quot;Caravan&quot; and complexity of &quot;Have You Met Miss Jones?&quot; He did not add to the classical pieces he had used earlier.

==Style and technique==
Saxophonist Benny Green wrote that Tatum was the only jazz musician to &quot;attempt to conceive a style based upon all styles, to master the mannerisms of all schools, and then synthesize those into something personal&quot;. Tatum was able to transform the styles of preceding jazz piano through virtuosity: where other pianists had employed repetitive rhythmic patterns and relatively simple decoration, he created &quot;harmonic sweeps of colour [and] unpredictable and ever-changing shifts of rhythm&quot;.
Musicologist Lewis Porter identified three aspects of Tatum&#x27;s playing that a casual listener might miss: the dissonance in his chords; his advanced use of substitute chord progressions; and his occasional use of bitonality (playing in two keys at the same time). There are examples on record of the last of these going back to 1934, making Tatum the furthest harmonically out of jazz musicians until Lennie Tristano. On occasion, the bitonality was against what another musician was playing, as in &quot;Lonesome Graveyard Blues&quot; with guitarist Oscar Moore. Before Tatum, jazz harmony was mainly triadic, with flattened sevenths and infrequent ninths; he went beyond that, influenced by Debussy and Ravel. He incorporated upper intervals such as elevenths and thirteenths, and added tenths (and greater intervals) to the left-hand vocabulary of stride.

Tatum improvised differently than is typical in modern jazz. He did not try to create new melodic lines over a harmonic progression; instead, he implied or played the original melody or fragments of it, while superimposing countermelodies and new phrases to create new structures based around variation. &quot;The harmonic lines may be altered, reworked or rhythmically rephrased for moments at a time, but they are still the base underneath Tatum&#x27;s superstructures. The melodic lines may be transformed into fresh shapes with only a note or a beat or a phrase particle retained to associate the new with the original, yet the melody remains, if only in the listener&#x27;s imagination.&quot; This flexibility extended to his use of rhythm: regardless of the tempo, he could alter the number of notes per beat and use other techniques at the same time to alter his phrasing&#x27;s rhythmic intensity and shape. His rhythmic sense also allowed him to move away from an established tempo for extended periods without losing the beat.

For critic Martin Williams, there was also the matter of Tatum&#x27;s sly humor when playing: &quot;when we fear he is reaching the limits of romantic bombast, a quirky phrase, an exaggerated ornament will remind us that Tatum may be having us on. He is also inviting us to share the joke and heartily kidding himself as well as the concert hall traditions to which he alludes.&quot;

Until the 1940s, Tatum&#x27;s style was based on popular song form, which often meant two bars of melodic development followed by two more melodically static bars, which he filled with rapid runs or arpeggios. Beginning in the 1940s, he progressively lengthened the runs to eight or more bars, sometimes continuing them across the natural eight-bar boundaries of a composition&#x27;s structure, and began to use a harder, more aggressive attack. He also increased the frequency of harmonic substitutions and the variety of musical devices played by his left hand, and developed a greater harmonic and contrapuntal balance across the piano&#x27;s upper and lower registers. Schuller argues that Tatum was still developing toward the end of his life – he had greater rhythmic flexibility when playing at a given tempo, more behind-the-beat swing, more diverse forms of expression, and he employed far fewer musical quotations than earlier in his career.

Critic Whitney Balliett wrote of Tatum&#x27;s style, &quot;his strange, multiplied chords, still largely unmatched by his followers, his laying on of two and three and four melodic levels at once [...] was orchestral and even symphonic.&quot; This style was not one that could be adapted to the form of bebop: &quot;the orchestral approach to the keyboard [...] was too thick, too textured to work in the context of a bebop rhythm section.&quot;

Tatum&#x27;s approach has also been criticized on other grounds. Pianist Keith Jarrett has said that Tatum played too many notes, and a criticism of him in a band setting was that he often did not modify his playing, overwhelming the other musicians and appearing to compete with any soloist he was ostensibly supporting. Clarinetist Buddy DeFranco said that playing with Tatum was &quot;like chasing a train&quot;, and Tatum himself said that a band got in his way.

Tatum had a calm physical demeanor at the keyboard, not attempting crowd-pleasing theatrical gestures. This increased his playing&#x27;s impact, as did his seemingly effortless technique, as pianist Hank Jones observed: the apparently horizontal gliding of his hands across the keys stunned his contemporaries. Tatum&#x27;s relatively straight-fingered technique, compared to the curvature taught in classical training, contributed to this visual impression: a critic wrote in 1935 that, when playing, &quot;Tatum&#x27;s hand is almost perfectly horizontal, and his fingers seem to actuate around a horizontal line drawn from wrist to finger tip.&quot;

Tatum was able to use his thumbs and little fingers to add melody lines while playing something else with his other fingers; drummer Bill Douglass, who played with Tatum, said that he would &quot;do runs with these two fingers up here and then the other two fingers of the same hand playing something else down there. Two fingers on the black keys, and then the other two fingers would be playing something else on the white keys. He could do that in either hand&quot;. His large hands allowed him to play a left-hand trill with thumb and forefinger while also using his little finger to play a note an octave lower. He was also capable of reaching twelfth intervals in either hand, and could play a succession of chords such as the illustrated examples at high speed. He was able to play all of his chosen material in any key.

Tatum&#x27;s touch has also attracted attention: for Balliett, &quot;No pianist has ever hit notes more beautifully. Each one [...] was light and complete and resonant, like the letters on a finely printed page. Vast lower-register chords were unblurred, and his highest notes were polished silver.&quot; Tatum maintained these qualities of touch and tone even at the quickest tempos, when almost all other pianists would be incapable of playing the notes at all. Pianist Chick Corea said, &quot;Tatum is the only pianist I know of before Bill [Evans] that also had that feather-light touch – even though he probably spent his early years playing on really bad instruments.&quot;

Among the musicians who said that Tatum could make a bad piano sound good were Billy Taylor and Gerald Wiggins. Wiggins said that Tatum could identify and avoid using any keys on a piano that were not working, while guitarist Les Paul recounted that Tatum sometimes resorted to pulling up stuck keys with one hand, mid-performance, so that he could play them again.

==Influence==
Tatum&#x27;s improvisational style extended what was possible on jazz piano. The virtuoso solo aspects of his style were taken on by pianists such as Adam Makowicz, Simon Nabatov, Oscar Peterson, and Martial Solal. Even musicians who played in very different styles, such as Bud Powell, Lennie Tristano, and Herbie Hancock, memorized and recreated some of his recordings to learn from them. Although Powell was of the bebop movement, his prolific and exciting style showed Tatum&#x27;s influence. Mary Lou Williams said, &quot;Tatum taught me how to hit my notes, how to control them without using pedals. And he showed me how to keep my fingers flat on the keys to get that clean tone.&quot;

Tatum&#x27;s influence went beyond the piano: his innovations in harmony and rhythm established new ground in jazz more broadly. He made jazz musicians more aware of harmonic possibilities by changing the chords he used with great frequency; this helped lay the foundations for the emergence of bebop in the 1940s. His modern chord voicing and chord substitutions were also pioneering in jazz.

Other musicians sought to transfer elements of Tatum&#x27;s pianistic virtuosity to their instruments. When newly arrived in New York, saxophonist Charlie Parker worked for three months as a dishwasher in a restaurant where Tatum was performing and often listened to him. &quot;Perhaps the most important idea Parker learned from Tatum was that any note could be made to fit in a chord if suitably resolved.&quot; Trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie was also affected by Tatum&#x27;s speed, harmony, and daring solos. Vocalist Tony Bennett incorporated aspects of Tatum into his singing: &quot;I&#x27;d listen to his records almost daily and try to phrase like him. [...] I just take his phrasing and sing it that way.&quot; Saxophonist Coleman Hawkins changed his playing style after hearing Tatum play in Toledo in the 1920s: Hawkins&#x27;s &quot;arpeggio-based style and his growing vocabulary of chords, of passing chords and the relationships of chords, were confirmed and encouraged by his response to Art Tatum.&quot; This style was hugely influential on the development of jazz saxophone playing, and put the sax on course to becoming the dominant jazz instrument.

Some musicians were hampered by exposure to Tatum&#x27;s abilities. Many pianists tried to copy him and attain the same level of ability, hindering their progress toward finding their own styles. Others, including trumpeter Rex Stewart and pianists Oscar Peterson and Bobby Short, were overwhelmed and began to question their own abilities. Some musicians, including Les Paul and Everett Barksdale, stopped playing the piano and switched to another instrument after hearing Tatum.

==Critical standing==
There is little published information available about Tatum&#x27;s life. One full-length biography has been published – &quot;Too Marvelous for Words&quot; (1994), by James Lester. This lack of detailed coverage may be attributable to Tatum&#x27;s life and music not fitting any of the established critical narratives or frameworks for jazz: many historians of the music have marginalized him for this, so &quot;not only is Tatum underrepresented in jazz criticism but his presence in jazz historiography seems largely to prompt no particular effort in historians beyond descriptive writing designed to summarize his pianistic approach&quot;.

Critics have expressed strong opinions about Tatum&#x27;s artistry: &quot;Some applaud Tatum as supremely inventive, while others say that he was boringly repetitive, and that he barely improvised.&quot; Gary Giddins suggests that Tatum&#x27;s standing has not been elevated to the very highest level of jazz stars among the public because he did not employ the expected linear style of improvisation, and instead played in a way that requires listeners to concentrate, so he &quot;becalms many listeners into hapless indifference&quot;.

==Other forms of recognition==
In 1989, Tatum&#x27;s hometown of Toledo established the Art Tatum African American Resource Center in its Kent Branch Library. It contains print and audio materials and microfiche, and organizes cultural programs, including festivals, concerts, and a gallery for local artists.

In 1993, Jeff Bilmes, an MIT student in the field of computational musicology coined the term &quot;tatum&quot; in recognition of the pianist&#x27;s speed. It has been defined as &quot;the smallest time interval between successive notes in a rhythmic phrase&quot;, and &quot;the fastest pulse present in a piece of music&quot;.

In 2003, a historical marker was placed outside Tatum&#x27;s childhood home at 1123 City Park Avenue in Toledo, but by 2017 the unoccupied property was in a state of disrepair. In 2021, Art Tatum Zone, a nonprofit organization, was awarded grants to restore the house and improve the neighborhood. Also in Toledo, the Lucas County Arena unveiled a 27-feet-high sculpture, the &quot;Art Tatum Celebration Column&quot;, in 2009.

<text>A barbershop quartet is a group of four singers who sing music in the barbershop style, characterized by four-part harmony without instrumental accompaniment (a cappella). The four voices are: the lead, the vocal part which typically carries the melody; a [[Bass (voice type)|bass]], the part which provides the bass line to the melody; a [[tenor]], the part which harmonizes above the lead; and a [[baritone]], the part that frequently completes the chord. The baritone normally sings just below the lead singer, sometimes just above as the harmony requires. Barbershop music is typified by close harmony— the upper three voices generally remain within one octave of each other.

While the traditional barbershop quartet included only male singers, contemporary quartets can include any gender combination. All-female barbershop quartets were often called beauty shop quartets, a term that has fallen out of favor. The voice parts for women&#x27;s and mixed barbershop groups use the same names as those for male groups since the roles perform similar functions in the quartet although the vocal ranges may be different.

While the regional origins of barbershop quartet singing are not wholly agreed upon, current organizations that promote the style typify it as an &quot;old American institution.&quot; While the style is most popular in the United States, barbershop organizations exist in the United Kingdom, The Netherlands, Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Ireland, South Africa, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, New Zealand, Australia, and Canada.

Barbershop quartets have been featured in popular culture in musical theater productions such as &quot;The Music Man&quot;, or lampooned in television series such as &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and &quot;Family Guy&quot;.

== History ==
While many sources claim that barbershop singing originated in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in the United States of America, some maintain that the origins of barbershop singing are &quot;obscure&quot;. The style is considered a blend of White and African American musical styles. Although the African American influence is sometimes overlooked, these quartets had a formative role in the development of the style.

By the 1920s, the popularity of the style had begun to fade. It was revived in the late 1930s along with the founding of the Society for the Preservation and Encouragement of Barber Shop Quartet Singing in America (SPEBSQSA), now known as the Barbershop Harmony Society, or BHS. The society&#x27;s first meeting was held at the Tulsa Club in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on April 11, 1938, and it was open only to male singers. In 1945, a parallel organization for women was also founded in Tulsa, called Sweet Adelines International (SAI). Harmony, Incorporated (HI), also serving women, was established in Rhode Island in 1959.

In 1971, president of BHS Ralph Ribble launched the &quot;Barberpole Cat Program&quot; to encourage barbershop singing as widely as possible. Well-known and popular barbershop songs were published and promoted in order to provide a core set of pieces for barbershop quartets. The current list of 12 songs, commonly known as &quot;polecats&quot;, was selected in 1987. These songs, plus the tag end of two others, are:

== Style of dress ==
In competition, barbershop quartets generally wear coordinated outfits to mark them as members of the same group. The Society Contest and Judging Committee of the Barbershop Harmony Society notes in their rule book that aesthetics are important to competitive success: &quot;The judge responds to both the vocal and visual aspects of the performance, but the judge principally evaluates the interaction of those aspects as they work together to create the image of the song.&quot;

Traditionally, barbershop quartet attire consisted of: vest, straw hat, and spats, often with bow tie and sleeve garters; this is known as the Gay Nineties style. In popular culture, this style exemplifies the stereotypical barbershop quartet. Several Walt Disney theme parks feature a dedicated barbershop quartet called The Dapper Dans (Disney World version pictured). The outfits worn by these performers vary depending on location but do feature vests and straw hats.

== Roles of vocal parts ==
As a general rule, barbershop quartets use a TTBB (tenor—tenor—baritone—bass) arrangement, with the second tenor singing the lead. Since the 1940s, barbershop singers have tuned their seventh chords with just intonation to maximize the overtones, yielding a distinctive &quot;ringing&quot; sound. 

Tenor: The tenor generally harmonizes above the lead, making the part the highest in the quartet. So as not to overpower the lead singer, who carries the tune, the part is often sung in falsetto, which is of a softer quality than singing in the modal register, though some quartets do make use of tenors with a softer full voice quality. Notable examples of barbershop quartets which made use of the full-voiced tenor include The Buffalo Bills and Boston Common.

The range of a tenor in barbershop music does not necessarily closely correspond to that of a tenor&#x27;s range in Classical repertoire, often being more in the range of the classical countertenor range.

Lead: The lead, often a lower or second tenor or even more recently a higher or lighter baritone, usually sings the main melody.

Baritone: The baritone often completes the chord with a medium voice, usually slightly below the lead, but sometimes above it. While the baritone&#x27;s part by itself does not sound as &quot;melodious&quot; as the other three, the baritone is a fundamental role in the quartet to filling in the missing notes and giving each chord a fuller sound.

Bass: The bass always sings and harmonizes the lowest notes, often setting the root of the chord for root position chords, or singing the lowest note of the chord for inverted chords.

<text>The Strait of Dover or Dover Strait, historically known as the Dover Narrows, is the strait at the narrowest part of the English Channel, marking the boundary between the Channel and the North Sea, and separating Great Britain from continental Europe. The shortest distance across the strait, at approximately , is from the South Foreland, northeast of Dover in the English county of Kent, to Cap Gris Nez, a cape near to Calais in the French département of Pas-de-Calais. Between these points lies the most popular route for cross-channel swimmers. The entire strait is within the territorial waters of France and the United Kingdom, but a right of transit passage under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea allows vessels of other nations to move freely through the strait.

On a clear day, it is possible to see the opposite coastline of England from France and vice versa with the naked eye, with the most famous and obvious sight being the White Cliffs of Dover from the French coastline and shoreline buildings on both coastlines, as well as lights on either coastline at night, as in Matthew Arnold&#x27;s poem &quot;Dover Beach&quot;.

Most maritime traffic between the Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea and Baltic Sea passes through the Strait of Dover, rather than taking the longer and more dangerous route around the north of Scotland. The strait is one of the busiest international seaways in the world, used by over 400 commercial vessels daily. This has made traffic safety a critical issue, with HM Coastguard and the Maritime Gendarmerie maintaining a 24-hour watch over the strait and enforcing a strict regime of shipping lanes.

In addition to the intensive north-east to south-west traffic, the strait is crossed from north-west to south-east by ferries linking Dover to Calais and Dunkirk. Until 1994 these provided the only route across it except for air transport. The Channel Tunnel now provides an alternative route, crossing beneath the strait at an average depth of below the seabed.

The town of Dover gives its name to one of the sea areas of the British Shipping Forecast.
==Geological formation==

The formation of strait was through scouring by erosion. It had for many millennia (since the last warm interglacial) been a land bridge that linked the Weald in Great Britain to the Boulonnais in the Pas de Calais. Though pitted by troughs and rivers, the English Channel was almost mainly land at the height of the last ice age. The predominant geology of both and of the seafloor is chalk. Although somewhat resistant to erosion, erosion of both coasts has created the famous white cliffs of Dover in the UK and the Cap Blanc Nez in France. The Channel Tunnel was bored through solid chalk – compacted remains of sea creatures and marine-deposited, ground up calciferous rock/soil debris.

The Rhine (as the Urstrom) flows northeast into the North Sea as the sea (covering most of the Netherlands) fell during the start of the first of the Pleistocene Ice Ages. The new ice unusually created a dam from Scandinavia to Scotland, and the Rhine, combined with the Thames and drainage from much of north Europe, created a vast lake behind the dam, which eventually spilled over the Weald into the English Channel. This overflow followed by further scouring became recognisably the Short Straits (an alternative name for this strait) about 425,000 years ago. A narrow deep channel along the middle of the strait is the remnants of the main (summer) outflow of the northern Ustrom glacial lake (a collect for other then-seasonal rivers, in winter iced up, such as the Thames and Weser) in the last Ice Age. A deposit in East Anglia marks the old preglacial northward course of the Urstrom-Thames when it also drained Doggerland. The deep sea floor east of Lincolnshire and East Yorkshire, connecting to the Atlantic via the Pentland Firth in the last glaciation (of over 300,000 years) is a necessary pre-condition for the relatively late cutting through of the Strait to the south.
Likewise, a 2007 study concluded that the Strait was formed by erosion caused by two major floods. The first was about 425,000 years ago, when an ice-dammed lake in the southern North Sea overflowed and broke the Weald-Artois (Boulonnais) chalk range in a catastrophic erosion and flood event. Consequently the ice-age-muted flows from the Thames and Scheldt flowed through the gap into the English Channel/Inlet, but the Meuse and Rhine still flowed without any significant link to the inlet (such as today&#x27;s IJssel distributary supports). In a second flood about 225,000 years ago supported by glaciers extending from areas then land such as the Zuiderzee, the Meuse and Rhine were ice-dammed into a lake that broke catastrophically through a high weak barrier (perhaps chalk, or an end-moraine left by the ice sheet). Both floods cut massive flood channels in the dry bed of the English Channel, somewhat like the Channeled Scablands or the Wabash River in the USA.
A further update in 2017 attributed a series of previously described underwater holes in the Channel floor, &quot;100m deep&quot; and in places &quot;several kilometres in diameter&quot;, to lake water plunging over a rock ridge causing isolated depressions or plunge pools.
The melting ice and rising sea levels submerged Doggerland, the area linking Britain to France, around 6,500–6,200 BCE.

The Lobourg strait, the deepest part the strait, runs its wide slash on a NNE–SSW axis. Nearer to the French coast than to the English, it borders the Varne sandbank (shoals) where it plunges to and further south, the Ridge bank (shoals) (French name &quot;Colbart&quot;) with a maximum depth of .
== Marine wildlife ==
The depth of the strait varies between at the Lobourg strait and at the highest banks. The seabed forms successions of three habitats:
*rocky zones relatively deserted by ships wanting to spare their nets
*sandy flats
*sub-aqueous dunes. 

The strong tidal currents of the strait at depth slow around its rocky masses as these stimulate and deep, calm pockets where many species can find shelter. In these calmer lee zones, the water is clearer than in the rest of the strait; thus algae can grow despite the average depth. They help increase diversity in the local species – some of which are endemic to the strait. Moreover, this is a transition zone for the species of the Atlantic Ocean and those of the southern part of the North Sea.

This mix of various environments promotes a wide variety of wildlife.

The &quot;Ridens de Boulogne&quot;, a deep rocky shoal, partially sand-capped, west of Boulogne, boasts the highest profusion of maerl in the strait.

Thus some of the strait is classified as a Natura 2000 protection zone named &quot;Ridens et dunes hydrauliques du Pas de Calais&quot; (Ridens and sub-aqueous dunes of the Dover Strait). This includes the sub-aqueous dunes of Varne, Colbart, Vergoyer and Bassurelle, the &quot;Ridens de Boulogne&quot;, and the Lobourg channel which provides calmer and clearer waters due to its depth reaching .

==Unusual crossings==
Many crossings other than in conventional vessels have been attempted, including by pedalo, jetpack, bathtub, amphibious vehicle and more commonly by swimming. Since French law bans many of them, unlike English law, most such crossings originate in England.

==Ice==
In the late 17th century during the &quot;Little Ice Age&quot;, there were reports of severe winter ice in the English Channel and Strait of Dover, including a case in 1684 of only a league of open water remaining between Dover and Calais.

<doc id="152560" wikidata="Q541191" url="?curid=152560" title="Anglo-Irish Treaty">
<text>The 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty (), commonly known in Ireland as The Treaty and officially the Articles of Agreement for a Treaty Between Great Britain and Ireland, was an agreement between the government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and the government of the Irish Republic that concluded the Irish War of Independence. It provided for the establishment of the Irish Free State within a year as a self-governing dominion within the &quot;community of nations known as the British Empire&quot;, a status &quot;the same as that of the Dominion of Canada&quot;. It also provided Northern Ireland, which had been created by the Government of Ireland Act 1920, an option to opt out of the Irish Free State (Article 12), which was exercised by the Parliament of Northern Ireland.

The agreement was signed in London on 6 December 1921, by representatives of the British government (which included Prime Minister David Lloyd George, who was head of the British delegates, and Winston Churchill, who was Secretary of State for the Colonies) and by representatives of the government of the Irish Republic (which included Michael Collins, who was Secretary of State for Finance, and Arthur Griffith, who was Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs). The Irish representatives had plenipotentiary status (negotiators empowered to sign a treaty without reference back to their superiors) acting on behalf of the Irish Republic, though the British government declined to recognise that status. As required by its terms, the agreement was approved by &quot;a meeting&quot; of the members elected to sit in the House of Commons of Southern Ireland and [separately] by the British Parliament. In reality, Dáil Éireann (the legislative assembly for the &quot;de facto&quot; Irish Republic) first debated then approved the treaty; members then went ahead with the &quot;meeting&quot;. Though the treaty was narrowly approved, the split led to the Irish Civil War, which was won by the pro-treaty side.

The Irish Free State as contemplated by the treaty came into existence when its constitution became law on 6 December 1922 by a royal proclamation.

==Content==

Among the treaty&#x27;s main clauses were that:
* Crown forces would withdraw from most of Ireland.
* Ireland was to become a self-governing dominion of the British Empire, a status shared by Australia, Canada, Newfoundland, New Zealand, and the Union of South Africa.
* As with the other dominions, the King would be the Head of State of the Irish Free State (&quot;Saorstát Éireann&quot;) and would be represented by a Governor General (see Representative of the Crown).
* Members of the new free state&#x27;s parliament would be required to take an Oath of Allegiance to the Irish Free State. A secondary part of the oath was to &quot;be faithful to His Majesty King George V, His heirs and successors by law, in virtue of the common citizenship&quot;.
* Northern Ireland (which had been created earlier by the Government of Ireland Act) would have the option of withdrawing from the Irish Free State within one month of the Treaty coming into effect.
* If Northern Ireland chose to withdraw, a Boundary Commission would be constituted to draw the boundary between the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland.
* Britain, for its own security, would continue to control a limited number of ports, known as the Treaty Ports, for the Royal Navy. 
* The Irish Free State would assume responsibility for a proportionate part of the United Kingdom&#x27;s debt, as it stood on the date of signature.
* The treaty would have superior status in Irish law, i.e., in the event of a conflict between it and the new 1922 Constitution of the Irish Free State, the treaty would take precedence.

==Negotiators==
The negotiators included:

Providing secretarial assistance were:
* For the British:
** Thomas Jones
** Lionel George Curtis
* For the Irish:
** Erskine Childers
** Fionán Lynch
** Diarmuid O&#x27;Hegarty
** John Smith Chartres

Robert Barton was the last surviving signatory. He died on 10 August 1975 at the age of 94.

Notably, the President of the Irish Republic Éamon de Valera did not attend.

Winston Churchill held two different roles in the British cabinet during the process of Irish independence: until February 1921 he had been Secretary of State for War (minister for the Army) hoping to end the Irish War of Independence; from then on, as Secretary of State for the Colonies (which included dominion affairs), he was charged with implementing the treaty and conducting relations with the new state.

Erskine Childers, the author of &quot;The Riddle of the Sands&quot; and former Clerk of the British House of Commons, served as one of the secretaries of the Irish delegation. Thomas Jones was one of Lloyd George&#x27;s principal assistants, and described the negotiations in his book &quot;Whitehall Diary&quot;.

==Status of the Irish plenipotentiaries==

De Valera sent the Irish plenipotentiaries to the 1921 negotiations in London with several draft treaties and secret instructions from his cabinet. Pointedly the British side never asked to see their formal accreditation with the full status of plenipotentiaries, but considered that it had invited them as elected MPs &quot;to ascertain how the association of Ireland with the community of nations known as the British Empire can best be reconciled with Irish national aspirations&quot;. This invitation in August 1921 had been delayed for over a month by a correspondence in which de Valera argued that Britain was now negotiating with a sovereign state, a position Lloyd George continually denied.

In the meantime, de Valera had been elevated to President of the Republic on 26 August, primarily to be able to accredit plenipotentiaries for the negotiations, as is usual between sovereign states. On 14 September all the Dáil speakers unanimously commented that the plenipotentiaries were being sent to represent the sovereign Irish Republic, and accepted de Valera&#x27;s nominations without dissent, although some argued that de Valera himself should attend the conference.

On 18 September Lloyd George recalled that:
On 29 September Lloyd George reiterated to de Valera that recognition of the Irish republic was &quot;a recognition which no British Government can accord&quot;, and he repeated his invitation for talks on &quot;ascertaining how the association of Ireland with the community of nations known as the British Empire may best be reconciled with Irish national aspirations&quot;, to start in London on 11 October, which was tacitly accepted by the Irish side. On 7 October de Valera signed a letter of accreditation as &quot;President&quot; on behalf of the &quot;Government of the Republic of Ireland&quot;, but the letter was never requested by the British side. Both the Irish and British sides knew that, in the event of failure, the truce agreed in July 1921 would end and the war would inevitably resume, a war that neither side wanted. Three months had passed by with nothing agreed.

The ambiguous status of the plenipotentiaries was to have unforeseeable consequences within the Nationalist movement when it divided over the treaty&#x27;s contents in 1921–22. Plenipotentiaries usually have full powers to handle negotiations as they see fit, but de Valera had given them instructions to refer back to his cabinet on any &quot;main question&quot; and with &quot;the complete text of the draft treaty about to be signed&quot;, which created difficulties. Subsequently, the anti-treaty side felt that the plenipotentiaries from the existing sovereign republic had somehow been persuaded to agree to accept much less. The pro-treaty side was to argue that after 11 October the negotiations had been conducted on the understanding that, even though the British were not negotiating with a sovereign state, the agreement was a significant first step towards Irish sovereignty.

==Negotiations==
Days after the truce that ended the Anglo-Irish War, de Valera met Lloyd George in London four times in the week starting 14 July. Lloyd George sent his initial proposals on 20 July that were very roughly in line with the treaty that was eventually signed. This was followed by months of delay until October, when the Irish delegates set up headquarters in 22 Hans Place, Knightsbridge.

The first two weeks of the negotiations were spent in formal sessions. Upon the request of Arthur Griffith and Michael Collins, the two delegations began informal negotiations, in which only two members of each negotiating team were allowed to attend. On the Irish side, these members were always Collins and Griffith, while on the British side, Austen Chamberlain always attended, though the second British negotiator would vary from day to day. In late November, the Irish delegation returned to Dublin to consult the cabinet according to their instructions, and again on 3 December. Many points still had to be resolved, mainly surrounding the form of an oath to the monarch, but it was clear to all the politicians involved by this stage that a unitary 32-county Irish Republic was not on offer.
When they returned, Collins and Griffith hammered out the final details of the treaty, which included British concessions on the wording of the oath and the defence and trade clauses, along with the addition of a boundary commission to the treaty and a clause upholding Irish unity. Collins and Griffith in turn convinced the other plenipotentiaries to sign the treaty. The final decisions to sign the treaty was made in private discussions at 22 Hans Place at 11:15am on 5 December 1921. The Treaty was signed soon after 2 in the morning on 6 December, in the Cabinet Room at 10 Downing St.

Michael Collins later claimed that at the last minute Lloyd George threatened the Irish delegates with a renewal of &quot;terrible and immediate war&quot; if the Treaty was not signed at once. This was not specifically called &quot;a threat&quot; in an Irish memorandum about the close of negotiations. Barton noted that:

George Gavan Duffy (a member of the Irish delegation) described the pressure placed on them to sign the treaty:

Several months after the signing of the treaty (16 February 1922) Winston Churchill spoke in the British Parliament on the consequences the Irish delegation refusing to sign the treaty: 

Éamon de Valera called a cabinet meeting to discuss the treaty on 8 December, where he came out against the treaty as signed. The cabinet decided by four votes to three to recommend the treaty to the Dáil on 14 December.

The contents of the treaty divided the Irish Republic&#x27;s leadership, with de Valera leading the anti-treaty minority. The Treaty Debates were difficult but also comprised a wider and robust stock-taking of the position by the contending parties. Their differing views of the past and their hopes for the future were made public. The focus had to be on the constitutional options, but little mention was made of the economy, nor of how life would now be improved for the majority of the population. Though Sinn Féin had also campaigned to preserve the Irish language, very little use was made of it in the debates. Some of the female TDs were notably in favour of continuing the war until a 32-county state was established. Much mention was made of &quot;700 years&quot; of British occupation. Personal bitterness developed; Arthur Griffith said of Erskine Childers: &quot;I will not reply to any damned Englishman in this Assembly&quot;, and Cathal Brugha reminded everyone that the position of Michael Collins in the IRA was technically inferior to his.

The main dispute was centred on the status as a dominion (as represented by the Oath of Allegiance and Fidelity) rather than as an independent republic, but the Partition of Ireland was a significant matter for dissent. Ulstermen like Seán MacEntee spoke strongly against the partition clause. The Dáil voted to approve the treaty but the objectors refused to accept it, leading eventually to the Irish Civil War. MacEntee was among their leaders.

==Approval and ratification==

Under the terms of the treaty, it required approval by:
#the Parliament of the United Kingdom, and
#a &quot;meeting summoned for the purpose [of approving the Treaty] of the members elected to sit in the House of Commons of Southern Ireland&quot;. This referred to the persons elected at the 1921 Irish elections called under the Government of Ireland Act 1920. This &quot;parliament&quot; had never in fact come into operation; of the 128 members elected, the 124 Sinn Féin candidates refused to sit in the House, instead forming (along with some of the Northern representatives) an alternative parliamentary assembly, the Second Dáil, which claimed to represent all of Ireland.
The British House of Commons approved the treaty on 16 December 1921 by a vote of 401 to 58. On the same day the House of Lords voted in favour by 166 to 47.

The Dáil approved the new treaty after nine days of public debate on 7 January 1922, by a vote of 64 to 57, but it was not the assembly specified in the treaty. Therefore, its approval of the treaty was not enough to satisfy the requirements of the treaty. The &quot;meeting&quot; required under the terms of the treaty was therefore convened. It formally approved the treaty on 14 January 1922. The &quot;meeting&quot; itself had a somewhat ambiguous status, not being convened or conducted in accordance with the procedures established for the House of Commons, nor being declared a session of Dáil Éireann. Anti-treaty members of the Dáil stayed away, meaning only pro-treaty members and the four elected unionists (who had never sat in Dáil Éireann) attended the meeting. Those assembled overwhelmingly approved the treaty, nominated Michael Collins for appointment as chairman of the provisional government and immediately dispersed with no parliamentary business taking place. This was the nearest that the House of Commons of Southern Ireland ever came to functioning; no other meeting ever took place, but the vote on 14 January, in strict compliance with the treaty wording, allowed the British authorities to maintain that the legal niceties had been observed.

In terms of the ratification of the treaty, the treaty required that &quot;necessary legislation&quot; be enacted to ratify it. The legislation required was enacted solely by the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The legislation enacted to do so was the Irish Free State (Agreement) Act 1922 which became law on 31 March 1922.

On 11 July 1924, the treaty was registered at the League of Nations by the Irish Free State.

===Dáil debates===

The Dáil debates lasted much longer and exposed the diversity of opinion in Ireland. The new Parliament fiercely debated the terms of the Treaty yet devoted a small amount of time on the issue of partition, just nine out of 338 transcript pages. Opening the debate on 14 December, President de Valera stated his view on procedure:

However, when the treaty was ratified by the Dáil on 7 January, he refused to accept the vote as final, saying on 10 January that:

Secret sessions were held on 14 to 17 December, and on the morning of 6 January, to keep the discord out of the press and the public arena. During the first of these, de Valera also produced his ideal redraft, which was not in most respects radically different from the signed agreement, but which was probably not acceptable to the British side as the differing points had already been explored.

On 15 December, Robert Barton was questioned by Kevin O&#x27;Higgins about his notes on Lloyd George&#x27;s statement about signing the agreement or facing a renewal of war: &quot;Did Mr Lloyd George single Mr Barton out as the left wing of the delegation and did he say, &#x27;The man who is against peace may bear now and forever the responsibility for terrible and immediate war? Barton replied: &quot;What he did say was that the signature and the recommendation of every member of the delegation was necessary, or war would follow immediately and that the responsibility for that war must rest directly upon those who refused to sign the Treaty&quot;. This was seized upon by opponents of the treaty as a convenient proof that the Irish delegates had been subjected to duress at the last minute, and &quot;terrible and immediate war&quot; became a catch-phrase in the debates that followed. The next day, de Valera took up this point: &quot;therefore what happened was that over there a threat of immediate force upon our people was made. I believe that that document was signed under duress and, though I have a moral feeling that any agreement entered into ought to be faithfully carried out, I have no hesitation in saying that I would not regard it as binding on the Irish nation.&quot;

The crucial private Dáil session on 6 January was informed that it could not be told about a private conference of nine TDs that had reached a compromise agreement on almost all points the night before. Most TDs wanted at least to be told what matters were still not agreed on, and from this point onwards the pro-treaty members insisted that all sessions should be held in public.

The public sessions lasted nine days from 19 December to 7 January. On 19 December Arthur Griffith moved:
&quot;That Dáil Éireann approves of the Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland, signed in London on 6 December 1921.&quot;

By 6 January, the day before the final vote, de Valera acknowledged the deep division within his cabinet: &quot;When these Articles of Agreement were signed, the body in which the executive authority of this assembly, and of the State, is vested became as completely split as it was possible for it to become. Irrevocably, not on personalities or anything of that kind or matter, but on absolute fundamentals.&quot;

The Second Dáil ratified the treaty on 7 January 1922 by a vote of 64 to 57. De Valera resigned as president on 9 January and was replaced by Arthur Griffith, on a vote of 60 to 58. On 10 January, de Valera published his second redraft, known generally as &quot;Document No. 2&quot;.

Griffith, as President of the Dáil, worked with Michael Collins, who chaired the new Provisional Government of the Irish Free State, theoretically answerable to the House of Commons of Southern Ireland, as the treaty laid down. On 25 October 1922, a new Irish constitution was enacted by the Third Dáil, sitting as a constituent assembly; the British Parliament confirmed the enactment on 5 December 1922. This parallel enactment provided the legal basis for the Irish Free State.

The Treaty debates were held in private, and not published until 1972, &quot;in all their aggression and rawness&quot;. They comprise a vital resource on the psychology of the Irish War of Independence and show the varying ideals that sustained the Sinn Féin deputies. Definitions of their understanding of their mandate in 1918 and 1921, and of the Republic itself, are interspersed with the practicalities of devolving power from London to Dublin. The narrow division led to the outbreak of the Irish Civil War on 28 June 1922.

==Outcome==

The split over the treaty led to the Irish Civil War (1922–23). In 1922, its two main Irish signatories, Arthur Griffith and Michael Collins, both died. Birkenhead reportedly said on signing the treaty: &quot;Mr Collins, in signing this Treaty I&#x27;m signing my political death warrant&quot;, to which Collins is said to have replied, &quot;Lord Birkenhead, I&#x27;m signing my actual death warrant.&quot; Collins was killed by anti-treaty republicans in an ambush at Béal na Bláth in August 1922, ten days after Griffith&#x27;s death from heart failure which was ascribed to exhaustion. Both men were replaced in their posts by W. T. Cosgrave. Two of the other members of the delegation, Robert Barton and Erskine Childers, sided against the treaty in the civil war. Childers, head of anti-treaty propaganda in the conflict, was executed by the free state for possession of a pistol in November 1922.

The treaty&#x27;s provisions relating to the monarch, the governor-general, and the treaty&#x27;s own superiority in law were all deleted from the Constitution of the Irish Free State in 1932, following the enactment of the Statute of Westminster by the British Parliament. By this statute, the British Parliament had voluntarily relinquished its ability to legislate on behalf of dominions without their consent. Thus, the Government of the Irish Free State was free to change any laws previously passed by the British Parliament on their behalf.
Nearly 10 years earlier, Michael Collins had argued that the treaty would give &quot;the freedom to achieve freedom&quot;. De Valera himself acknowledged the accuracy of this claim both in his actions in the 1930s but also in words he used to describe his opponents and their securing of independence during the 1920s. &quot;They were magnificent&quot;, he told his son in 1932, just after he had entered government and read the files left by Cosgrave&#x27;s Cumann na nGaedheal Executive Council.

Although the British Government of the day had, since 1914, desired home rule for the whole of Ireland, the British Parliament believed that it could not possibly grant complete independence to all of Ireland in 1921 without provoking huge sectarian violence between overwhelmingly Protestant Irish Unionists and overwhelmingly Catholic Irish Nationalists. At the time, although there were Unionists throughout the country, they were concentrated in the north-east and their parliament first sat on 7 June 1921. An uprising by them against home rule would have been an insurrection against the &quot;mother county&quot; as well as a civil war in Ireland. (See Ulster Volunteers.) Dominion status for 26 counties, with partition for the six counties that the Unionists felt they could comfortably control, seemed the best compromise possible at the time.

In fact, what Ireland received in dominion status, on par with that enjoyed by Canada, New Zealand and Australia, was far more than the Home Rule Act 1914, and certainly a considerable advance on the home rule once offered to Charles Stewart Parnell in the nineteenth century albeit at the cost of the exclusion of Northern Ireland. Even de Valera&#x27;s proposals made in secret during the Treaty Debates differed very little in essential matters from the accepted text, and were far short of the autonomous 32-county republic that he publicly claimed to pursue.

The solution that was agreed had also been on Lloyd George&#x27;s mind for years. He met Tim Healy, a senior barrister and former nationalist MP, in late 1919 to consider his options. Healy wrote to his brother on 11 December 1919: &quot;Lloyd George said that, if he could get support for a plan whereby the six counties would be left as they are, he would be ready to give the rest of the country Dominion Home Rule, free from Imperial taxation, and with control of the Customs and Excise.&quot; Healy considered that the idea had foundered on de Valera&#x27;s insistence on having an all-Ireland republic, months before the war of independence became seriously violent in mid-1920.

Lloyd George had supported the 1893 Home Rule Bill and the slow process of the 1914 Home Rule Act, and liaised with the Irish Convention members in 1917–18. By 1921 his coalition government depended on a large Conservative majority, and collapsed during the Chanak crisis in October 1922.

<text>Rutabaga (; North American English) or swede (English and some Commonwealth English) is a root vegetable, a form of Brassica napus (which also includes rapeseed). Other names include Swedish turnip, neep (Scots), and [[Turnip (terminology)|turnip]] (Scottish,and Canadian English, Irish English, Cornish English and Manx English, as well as some dialects of English in Northern England). However, elsewhere, the name &quot;turnip&quot; usually refers to the related white turnip. The species &quot;Brassica napus&quot; originated as a hybrid between the cabbage (&quot;Brassica oleracea&quot;) and the turnip (&quot;Brassica rapa&quot;). Rutabaga roots are eaten as human food in various ways, and the leaves can be eaten as a leaf vegetable. The roots and tops are also used for livestock, fed directly in the winter or foraged in the field during the other seasons. Scotland, Northern and Western England, Wales, the Isle of Man, and Ireland had a tradition of carving the roots into Jack-o&#x27;-lanterns at Halloween.

==Etymology==

Rutabaga has many national and regional names. &quot;Rutabaga&quot; is the common North American term for the plant. This comes from the Swedish dialectal word , from &#x27;root&#x27; + &#x27;lump, bunch&#x27;. In the U.S., the plant is also known as &quot;Swedish turnip&quot; or &quot;yellow turnip&quot;.

The term &quot;swede&quot; (from &quot;Swedish turnip&quot;) is used in many Commonwealth Nations, including much of the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand. The name &quot;turnip&quot; is also used in parts of Northern and Midland England, the West Country (particularly Cornwall), Ireland, the Isle of Man, and Canada. In Wales, according to region, it is variously known as , , or in Welsh, and as &quot;swede&quot; or &quot;turnip&quot; in English.

In Scotland, it is known as &quot;turnip&quot;, &quot;tumshie&quot; (also used as a pejorative term for a foolish or stupid person), or &quot;neep&quot; (from Old English &#x27;, Latin &#x27;). Some areas of south-east Scotland, such as Berwickshire and Roxburghshire, still use the term &quot;baigie&quot;, possibly a derivative of the Swedish dialectal word &quot;&quot;. The term &quot;turnip&quot; is also used for the white turnip (&quot;Brassica rapa&quot; ssp &quot;rapa&quot;).

Some will also refer to both swede and (white) turnip as just &quot;turnip&quot; (this word is also derived from ). In north-east England, turnips and swedes are colloquially called &quot;snannies&quot; &quot;snadgers&quot;, &quot;snaggers&quot; (archaic) or &quot;narkies&quot;. Rutabaga is also known as &quot;moot&quot; in the Isle of Man and the Manx language word for turnip is .

==History==

The first known printed reference to the rutabaga comes from the Swiss botanist Gaspard Bauhin in 1620, where he notes that it was growing wild in Sweden. It is often considered to have originated in Scandinavia, Finland or Russia. According to the Natural Resources Institute Finland (now Luke), rutabaga or was most likely bred on more than one occasion in Northern Europe around the 16th century. Studies by its research institute have shown that was developed independently in Finland and Sweden from turnip and cabbage in connection with seed cultivation. There are contradictory accounts of how rutabaga arrived in England. Some sources say it arrived in England from Germany, while other accounts support Swedish origins. According to John Sinclair, the root vegetable arrived in England from Germany around 1750. Rutabaga arrived in Scotland by way of Sweden around 1781.

An article in &quot;The Gardeners&#x27; Chronicle&quot; suggests that the rutabaga was introduced more widely to England in 1790. Introduction to North America came in the early 19th century with reports of rutabaga crops in Illinois as early as 1817. In 1835, a rutabaga fodder crop was recommended to New York farmers in the Genesee River valley.

Rutabaga was once considered a food of last resort in both Germany and France due to its association with food shortages in World War I and World War II. Boiled stew with rutabaga and water as the only ingredients (Steckrübeneintopf) was a typical food in Germany during the famines and food shortages of World War I caused by the Allied blockade (the or Turnip Winter of 1916–17) and between 1945 and 1949. As a result, many older Germans had unhappy memories of this food.

===Botanical history===
Rutabaga has a complex taxonomic history. The earliest account comes from the Swiss botanist Gaspard Bauhin, who wrote about it in his 1620 &quot;Prodromus&quot;. &quot;Brassica napobrassica&quot; was first validly published by Carl Linnaeus in his 1753 work &quot;Species Plantarum&quot; as a variety of &quot;B. oleracea&quot;: &quot;B. oleracea&quot; var. &quot;napobrassica&quot;. It has since been moved to other taxa as a variety, subspecies, or elevated to species rank. In 1768, a Scottish botanist promoted Linnaeus&#x27; variety to species rank as &quot;Brassica napobrassica&quot; in &quot;The Gardeners Dictionary&quot;.

Rutabaga has a chromosome number of 2&quot;n&quot; = 38. It originated from a cross between turnip (&quot;Brassica rapa&quot;) and &quot;Brassica oleracea&quot;. The resulting cross doubled its chromosomes, becoming an allopolyploid. This relationship was first published by Woo Jang-choon in 1935 and is known as the Triangle of U.

==Cuisine==
=== Europe ===

==== Netherlands ====
In the Netherlands, rutabaga is traditionally served boiled and mashed. Adding mashed potatoes (and, in some recipes, similarly mashed vegetables or fruits) makes &#x27;mash pot&#x27;, a dish often served alongside smoked sausage. Similar dishes are known in the Southern low countries, down to and including Brussels, as stoemp.

==== Poland ====
During the difficult days of World War II, rutabaga and rutabaga juice were an important part of the local diet, and were consumed in large quantities.

==== Scandinavia ====

===== Sweden and Norway =====

In Sweden and Norway, rutabaga is cooked with potato and sometimes carrot, and mashed with butter and either stock or, occasionally, milk or cream, to create a puree called (Swedish, literally &#x27;root mash&#x27;) or (Norwegian). Onion is occasionally added. In Norway, is an obligatory accompaniment to many festive dishes, including , , and salted herring. In Sweden, is often eaten together with cured and boiled ham hock, accompanied by mustard. This classic Swedish dish is called .

===== Finland =====

Finns eat and cook rutabaga in a variety of ways. Rutabaga is the major ingredient in the popular Christmas dish &quot;lanttulaatikko&quot; (rutabaga casserole), one of the three main casseroles served during Finnish Christmas, alongside the potato and carrot casseroles.

Uncooked and thinly julienned rutabaga is often served as a side dish salad in school and workplace lunches. Raisins or canned pineapple in light syrup are often added to the rutabaga salad. Sometimes, thinly sliced raw carrots are mixed with rutabaga.

Finns use rutabaga in most dishes that call for a root vegetable. Many Finnish soup bases consist of potatoes, carrots, and rutabagas.

Finnish cuisine also roasts, bakes, boils, and grills rutabagas. Oven-baked root vegetables are another home-cooking classic in Finland: rutabaga, carrots, beetroots, and potatoes are roasted in the oven with salt and oil. Karelian hot pot () is a popular slow-cooking stew with root vegetables and meat cooked for a long time in a Dutch oven.

Finnish supermarkets sell alternative potato chips made from root vegetables, such as rutabagas, beetroots and carrots.

Rutabagas are also an ingredient in (rutabaga-, a traditional Savonian and Karelian dish).

==== United Kingdom ====

===== England =====
In England, swede is boiled with carrots and mashed or pureed with butter and ground pepper. The flavoured cooking water is often retained for soup or as an addition to gravy. Swede is also a component of the popular condiment Branston Pickle. The swede is also one of the four traditional ingredients of the pasty originating in Cornwall.

===== Scotland =====
In Scotland, separately boiled and mashed, swede (&quot;neeps&quot;) and potatoes are served as &quot;neeps and &quot; ( being the Scots word for potatoes), in a traditional Burns supper, together with the main course of haggis (the Scottish national dish). Neeps mashed with potatoes are called clapshot. Roughly equal quantities of neeps and tatties are boiled in salted water and mashed with butter. Seasoning can be augmented with black pepper. Onions are never used. Regionally, neeps are a common ingredient in soups and stews.

===== Wales =====
Swede is an essential vegetable component of the traditional Welsh lamb broth called cawl. A mash produced using just potato and swede is known as in the North-East of the country, as on the Llyn peninsula and as in other parts.

=== Outside Europe ===

==== Australia ====
In Australia, swedes are used as a flavour enhancer in casseroles, stews, and soups.

==== Canada ====
In Canada, they are considered winter vegetables, as, along with similar vegetables, they can be kept in a cold area or cellar for several months. They are primarily used as a side dish. They are also used as filler in foods such as mincemeat and Christmas cake. In Newfoundland, it is served with Jiggs dinner.

==== New Zealand ====
In New Zealand, they are more commonly available in winter but can be easily purchased for much of the year. It is thought they best grow in Southland, where the winters are colder. They are usually served mashed with butter but are often added to other dishes like casseroles or bakes.

==== United States ====
In the US, rutabagas are not widely eaten but may be found as part of stews or casseroles, served mashed with carrots, or baked in a pasty. They are sometimes included in the New England boiled dinner.

==Phytochemistry==

Rutabaga and other cyanoglucoside-containing foods (including cassava, maize (corn), bamboo shoots, sweet potatoes, and lima beans) release cyanide, which is subsequently detoxified into thiocyanate. Thiocyanate inhibits thyroid iodide transport and, at high doses, competes with iodide in the organification process within thyroid tissue. Goitres may develop when there is a dietary imbalance of thiocyanate-containing food in excess of iodine consumption, and these compounds can contribute to hypothyroidism. Yet, there have been no reports of ill effects in humans from the consumption of glucosinolates from normal amounts of &quot;Brassica&quot; vegetables. Glucosinolate content in &quot;Brassica&quot; vegetables is around one percent of dry matter. These compounds also cause the bitter taste of rutabaga.

As with watercress, mustard greens, turnip, broccoli, and horseradish, human perception of bitterness in rutabaga is governed by a gene affecting the TAS2R bitter receptor, which detects the glucosinolates in rutabaga. Sensitive individuals with the genotype PAV/PAV (supertasters) find rutabaga twice as bitter as insensitive subjects (AVI/AVI). The difference for the mixed type (PAV/AVI) is insignificant for rutabaga. As a result, sensitive individuals may find some rutabagas too bitter to eat.

Other chemical compounds that contribute to flavour and odour include glucocheirolin, glucobrassicanapin, glucoberteroin, gluconapoleiferin, and glucoerysolin. Several phytoalexins that aid in defence against plant pathogens have also been isolated from the rutabaga, including three novel phytoalexins that were reported in 2004.

Rutabaga contains significant amounts of vitamin C: 100 g contains 25 mg, 30% of the daily recommended dose.

==Other uses==

===Livestock===
The roots and tops of &quot;swedes&quot; came into use as a forage crop in the early nineteenth century, used as winter feed for livestock. They may be fed directly (chopped or from a hopper), or animals may be allowed to forage the plants directly in the field.

===Halloween===

People in Northern England, West England, Ireland, and Scotland have long carved turnips and often use them as lanterns to ward off harmful spirits. In the Middle Ages, rowdy bands of children roamed the streets in masks carrying carved turnips known in Scotland as &quot;tumshie heads&quot;. In modern times, turnips are often carved to look as sinister and threatening as possible and are put in the window or on the doorstep of a house on Halloween to ward off evil spirits.

Since pumpkins became readily available in Europe in the 1980s, they have taken over this role to a large extent. In the Isle of Man, turnip lanterns are still carved at Hop-tu-Naa (Manx equivalent of Halloween), lit with a candle or electric torch, and carried from house to house by some children, with the accompanying Hop tu Naa song; hoping for money or treats of food. The smell of burning turnip is an evocative part of the event.

===Festivals===
A local farmers&#x27; market in the town of Ithaca, New York, organizes what it calls the International Rutabaga Curling Championship annually on the last day of the market season. The villages of Askov, Minnesota, and Cumberland, Wisconsin, both hold annual rutabaga festivals in August.

<text>A courtesy name (), also known as a style name, is an additional name bestowed upon individuals at adulthood, complementing their given name. This tradition is prevalent in the East Asian cultural sphere, particularly in China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam. Courtesy names are a marker of adulthood and were historically given to men at the age of 20, and sometimes to women upon marriage.

Unlike art names, which are more akin to pseudonyms or pen names, courtesy names served a formal and respectful purpose. In traditional Chinese society, using someone’s given name in adulthood was considered disrespectful among peers, making courtesy names essential for formal communication and writing.

Courtesy names often reflect the meaning of the given name or use homophonic characters, and were typically disyllabic after the Qin dynasty. The practice also extended to other East Asian cultures, and was sometimes adopted by Mongols and Manchus during the Qing dynasty. The choice of a courtesy name was significant, intended to express moral integrity and respect within the cultural context.

==Usage==
A courtesy name is a name traditionally given to Chinese men at the age of 20 &quot;sui&quot;, marking their coming of age. It was sometimes given to women, usually upon marriage. The practice is no longer common in modern Chinese society. According to the &quot;Book of Rites&quot;, after a man reached adulthood, it was disrespectful for others of the same generation to address him by his given name. Thus, the given name was reserved for oneself and one&#x27;s elders, whereas the courtesy name would be used by adults of the same generation to refer to one another on formal occasions or in writing. Another translation of &quot;zi&quot; is &quot;style name&quot;, but this translation has been criticised as misleading, because it could imply an official or legal title.

Generally speaking, courtesy names before the Qin dynasty were one syllable, and from the Qin to the 20th century they were mostly disyllabic, consisting of two Chinese characters. Courtesy names were often relative to the meaning of the person&#x27;s given name, the relationship could be synonyms, relative affairs, or rarely but sometimes antonym. For example, Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s given name (, romanized as Chung-cheng) and courtesy name (, romanized as Kai-shek) are both from the &quot;yù&quot; (豫) hexagram 16 of I Ching.

Another way to form a courtesy name is to use the homophonic character &quot;zi&quot; () – a respectful title for a man – as the first character of the disyllabic courtesy name. Thus, for example, Gongsun Qiao&#x27;s courtesy name was Zichan (), and Du Fu&#x27;s was Zimei (). It was also common to construct a courtesy name by using as the first character one which expresses the bearer&#x27;s birth order among male siblings in his family. Thus Confucius, whose name was Kong Qiu (), was given the courtesy name Zhongni (), where the first character &quot;zhong&quot; indicates that he was the second son born into his family. The characters commonly used are &quot;bo&quot; () for the first, &quot;zhong&quot; () for the second, &quot;shu&quot; () for the third, and &quot;ji&quot; () typically for the youngest, if the family consists of more than three sons. General Sun Jian&#x27;s four sons, for instance, were Sun Ce (, Bófú), Sun Quan (, Zhòngmóu), Sun Yi (, Shūbì) and Sun Kuang (, Jìzuǒ).

Reflecting a general cultural tendency to regard names as significant, the choice of what name to bestow upon one&#x27;s children was considered very important in traditional China. Yan Zhitui of the Northern Qi dynasty asserted that whereas the purpose of a given name was to distinguish one person from another, a courtesy name should express the bearer&#x27;s moral integrity.

Prior to the twentieth century, sinicized Koreans, Vietnamese, and Japanese were also referred to by their courtesy name. The practice was also adopted by some Mongols and Manchus after the Qing conquest of China.

<doc id="152567" wikidata="Q685140" url="?curid=152567" title="Generalized Riemann hypothesis">
<text>The Riemann hypothesis is one of the most important conjectures in mathematics. It is a statement about the zeros of the Riemann zeta function. Various geometrical and arithmetical objects can be described by so-called global &quot;L&quot;-functions, which are formally similar to the Riemann zeta-function. One can then ask the same question about the zeros of these &quot;L&quot;-functions, yielding various generalizations of the Riemann hypothesis. Many mathematicians believe these generalizations of the Riemann hypothesis to be true. The only cases of these conjectures which have been proven occur in the algebraic function field case (not the number field case).

Global &quot;L&quot;-functions can be associated to elliptic curves, number fields (in which case they are called Dedekind zeta-functions), Maass forms, and Dirichlet characters (in which case they are called Dirichlet L-functions). When the Riemann hypothesis is formulated for Dedekind zeta-functions, it is known as the extended Riemann hypothesis (ERH) and when it is formulated for Dirichlet &quot;L&quot;-functions, it is known as the generalized Riemann hypothesis or generalised Riemann hypothesis (GRH). These two statements will be discussed in more detail below. (Many mathematicians use the label &quot;generalized Riemann hypothesis&quot; to cover the extension of the Riemann hypothesis to all global &quot;L&quot;-functions, 
not just the special case of Dirichlet &quot;L&quot;-functions.)

== Generalized Riemann hypothesis (GRH) ==
The generalized Riemann hypothesis (for Dirichlet &quot;L&quot;-functions) was probably formulated for the first time by Adolf Piltz in 1884. Like the original Riemann hypothesis, it has far reaching consequences about the distribution of prime numbers.

The formal statement of the hypothesis follows. A Dirichlet character is a completely multiplicative arithmetic function &quot;χ&quot; such that there exists a positive integer &quot;k&quot; with for all &quot;n&quot; and whenever . If such a character is given, we define the corresponding Dirichlet &quot;L&quot;-function by
:formula_1

for every complex number &quot;s&quot; such that . By analytic continuation, this function can be extended to a meromorphic function (only when formula_2 is primitive) defined on the whole complex plane. The generalized Riemann hypothesis asserts that, for every Dirichlet character &quot;χ&quot; and every complex number &quot;s&quot; with , if &quot;s&quot; is not a negative real number, then the real part of &quot;s&quot; is 1/2.

The case for all &quot;n&quot; yields the ordinary Riemann hypothesis.

=== Consequences of GRH ===
Dirichlet&#x27;s theorem states that if &quot;a&quot; and &quot;d&quot; are coprime natural numbers, then the arithmetic progression &quot;a&quot;, , , , ... contains infinitely many prime numbers. Let denote the number of prime numbers in this progression which are less than or equal to &quot;x&quot;. If the generalized Riemann hypothesis is true, then for every coprime &quot;a&quot; and &quot;d&quot; and for every ,
:formula_3
where formula_4 is Euler&#x27;s totient function and formula_5 is the Big O notation. This is a considerable strengthening of the prime number theorem.

If GRH is true, then every proper subgroup of the multiplicative group formula_6 omits a number less than , as well as a number coprime to &quot;n&quot; less than . In other words, formula_6 is generated by a set of numbers less than . This is often used in proofs, and it has many consequences, for example (assuming GRH):
*The Miller–Rabin primality test is guaranteed to run in polynomial time. (A polynomial-time primality test which does not require GRH, the AKS primality test, was published in 2002.)
*The Shanks–Tonelli algorithm is guaranteed to run in polynomial time.
*The Ivanyos–Karpinski–Saxena deterministic algorithm for factoring polynomials over finite fields with prime constant-smooth degrees is guaranteed to run in polynomial time.

If GRH is true, then for every prime &quot;p&quot; there exists a primitive root mod &quot;p&quot; (a generator of the multiplicative group of integers modulo &quot;p&quot;) that is less than formula_8

Goldbach&#x27;s weak conjecture also follows from the generalized Riemann hypothesis. The yet to be verified proof of Harald Helfgott of this conjecture verifies the GRH for several thousand small characters up to a certain imaginary part to obtain sufficient bounds that prove the conjecture for all integers above 1029, integers below which have already been verified by calculation.

Assuming the truth of the GRH, the estimate of the character sum in the Pólya–Vinogradov inequality can be improved to formula_9, &quot;q&quot; being the modulus of the character.

== Extended Riemann hypothesis (ERH) ==

Suppose &quot;K&quot; is a number field (a finite-dimensional field extension of the rationals &quot;Q&quot;) with ring of integers O&quot;K&quot; (this ring is the integral closure of the integers &quot;Z&quot; in &quot;K&quot;). If &quot;a&quot; is an ideal of O&quot;K&quot;, other than the zero ideal, we denote its norm by &quot;Na&quot;. The Dedekind zeta-function of &quot;K&quot; is then defined by
:formula_10
for every complex number &quot;s&quot; with real part &gt; 1. The sum extends over all non-zero ideals &quot;a&quot; of O&quot;K&quot;.

The Dedekind zeta-function satisfies a functional equation and can be extended by analytic continuation to the whole complex plane. The resulting function encodes important information about the number field &quot;K&quot;. The extended Riemann hypothesis asserts that for every number field &quot;K&quot; and every complex number &quot;s&quot; with ζ&quot;K&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) = 0: if the real part of &quot;s&quot; is between 0 and 1, then it is in fact 1/2.

The ordinary Riemann hypothesis follows from the extended one if one takes the number field to be &quot;Q&quot;, with ring of integers &quot;Z&quot;.

The ERH implies an effective version of the Chebotarev density theorem: if &quot;L&quot;/&quot;K&quot; is a finite Galois extension with Galois group &quot;G&quot;, and &quot;C&quot; a union of conjugacy classes of &quot;G&quot;, the number of unramified primes of &quot;K&quot; of norm below &quot;x&quot; with Frobenius conjugacy class in &quot;C&quot; is
:formula_11
where the constant implied in the big-O notation is absolute, &quot;n&quot; is the degree of &quot;L&quot; over &quot;Q&quot;, and Δ its discriminant.

<text>The Irish Republic ( or ) was a revolutionary state that declared its independence from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in January 1919. The Republic claimed jurisdiction over the whole island of Ireland, but by 1920 its functional control was limited to only 21 of Ireland&#x27;s 32 counties, and British state forces maintained a presence across much of the north-east, as well as Cork, Dublin and other major towns. The republic was strongest in rural areas, and through its military forces was able to influence the population in urban areas that it did not directly control.

Its origins date back to the Easter Rising of 1916, when Irish republicans seized key locations in Dublin and proclaimed an Irish Republic. The rebellion was crushed, but the survivors united under a reformed Sinn Féin party to campaign for a republic. The party won a clear majority of largely uncontested seats in the 1918 general election, and formed the first Dáil (legislature) of Ireland in Dublin on 21 January 1919. Republicans then established a government, a court system and a police force. At the same time, the Irish Volunteers, who came under the control of the Dáil and became known as the Irish Republican Army, fought against British state forces in the Irish War of Independence.

The War of Independence ended with the Anglo-Irish Treaty, signed on 6 December 1921 and narrowly approved by Dáil Éireann on 7 January 1922. A Provisional Government was set up under the terms of the treaty, but the Irish Republic nominally remained in existence until 6 December 1922, when 26 of the island&#x27;s 32 counties became a self-governing British dominion called the Irish Free State. The island had been partitioned by the Government of Ireland Act 1920, and the six counties of Northern Ireland, which had been partitioned so as to create and ensure a unionist majority, exercised their right under the treaty to opt out of the Free State, and remain in the United Kingdom.

== Name ==
In English, the revolutionary state was to be known as the &quot;Irish Republic&quot;. Two different Irish language titles were used: and , based on two alternative Irish translations of the word &quot;republic&quot;. The word was newly coined by the writers of the Easter Proclamation in 1916. was a compound word, based on the Irish words (&quot;free&quot;) and (&quot;state&quot;). Its literal translation was &quot;free state&quot;. The term is the one used in the Proclamation of 1916, but the Declaration of Independence and other documents adopted in 1919 used .

 was adopted as the official Irish title of the Irish Free State when it was established at the end of the Irish War of Independence, although this Free State was not a republic but a form of constitutional monarchy within the British Empire. Since then, the word has fallen out of use as a translation of &quot;republic&quot;. After the Irish state had changed its name to &quot;Ireland&quot;, in 1949 the description of the state was declared &quot;Republic of Ireland&quot;, while in Irish it was translated as .

In his memoir, Winston Churchill gives an account of the first meeting of Éamon de Valera (then the President of Dáil Éireann) with David Lloyd George (then the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom) on 14 July 1921, at which Churchill was present. Lloyd George was a native speaker of Welsh and a noted Welsh linguist, and as such was interested in the literal meaning of . De Valera replied that it meant &#x27;Free State&#x27;. Lloyd George asked, &quot;What is your Irish word for Republic?&quot; After what Churchill characterized as some delay and no reply from de Valera, Lloyd George commented: &quot;Must we not admit that the Celts never were Republicans and have no native word for such an idea?&quot;

Lord Longford gives a different account in &quot;Peace by Ordeal&quot;: &quot;The only doubt in de Valera&#x27;s mind, as he explained to Lloyd George, arose from the current dispute among Gaelic purists whether the idea Republic was better conveyed by the broader &#x27;Saorstát&#x27; or the more abstract &#x27;Poblacht&#x27;.&quot;

== Establishment ==

In 1916, nationalist rebels participating in the Easter Rising issued the Proclamation of the Republic. By this declaration, they claimed to establish an independent state called the &quot;Irish Republic&quot;, and proclaimed that the leaders of the rebellion would serve as the &quot;Provisional Government of the Irish Republic&quot; until it became possible to elect a national parliament. The Easter Rising was short-lived, largely limited to Dublin and, at the time it occurred, enjoyed little support from the Irish general public.

The leaders of the Easter Rising had proclaimed a republic. Arthur Griffith&#x27;s Sinn Féin organisation, which had favoured the establishment of a form of dual monarchy between Ireland and Britain, had not taken part in the Rising. In 1917, Griffith&#x27;s Sinn Féin and republicans under Éamon de Valera came together to form the new Sinn Féin Party. A compromise was reached at the 1917 Ard Fheis (party conference), where it was agreed that the party would pursue the establishment of an independent republic in the short term, until the Irish people could be given the opportunity to decide on the form of government they preferred. This agreement was subject to the condition that if the people chose monarchy, no member of the British royal family would be invited to serve as monarch.

In the 1918 general election, candidates of the radical Sinn Féin party—including many who had participated in the 1916 rebellion—issued a manifesto which included the statement: &quot;Sinn Féin aims at securing the establishment of that Republic&quot;. It also said it would boycott the British Parliament and instead unilaterally establish a new Irish assembly in Dublin. Sinn Féin candidates won a large majority of the seats: 73 out of 105, 25 of them uncontested. On 21 January 1919, 27 of them gathered in the Mansion House in Dublin to establish Dáil Éireann. Thirty-five other members were recorded as being (imprisoned by the foreign enemy) and another four as (deported by the foreign enemy). Thirty-seven others were recorded as not being present (), these were mainly from the northern six counties that would later form Northern Ireland. At this meeting, the Dáil adopted the Irish Declaration of Independence. Because of the Easter Proclamation of 1916, the Dáil retrospectively established the Irish Republic from Easter 1916.

On the same day as the Declaration of Independence was issued, two members of the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) escorting a cartload of gelignite were killed in the Tipperary Soloheadbeg Ambush, carried out by members of the 3rd Tipperary Brigade of the Irish Volunteers, led by Dan Breen and Seán Treacy. This ambush had not been ordered by the Dáil, but the course of events soon drove the Dáil to recognise the Volunteers as the army of the Irish Republic, and so the Soloheadbeg incident became the opening incident of the undeclared Anglo-Irish War between the Volunteers and Great Britain. Breen later recalled: &quot;Treacy had stated to me that the only way of starting a war was to kill someone, so we intended to kill some of the police.&quot;

The decision to establish a republic in 1919, rather than any other form of government, was significant because it amounted to a complete repudiation of all constitutional ties with Great Britain, and set the party against any compromise that might involve initial self-government under the Home Rule Act 1914 or continued membership of the British Empire. One obstacle to this decision—that the Unionists of the north-east had long indicated that they would never participate in any form of a republic—was left unresolved, the six north-eastern counties remaining part of the United Kingdom under the Government of Ireland Act 1920, and later the Anglo-Irish Treaty.

== Institutions of government ==
===Dáil Éireann===
The central institution of the republic was Dáil Éireann, a unicameral assembly formed by the majority of Irish Members of Parliament elected in the 1918 general election. Two further general elections called by the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, the head of the British Dublin Castle administration, were treated by nationalists as elections to the Dáil. The Second Dáil comprised members returned in the 1921 elections for the Parliaments of Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland; the Third Dáil was elected at the 1922 general election as the &quot;provisional parliament&quot; of &quot;Southern Ireland&quot;, as provided for by the Anglo-Irish Treaty.

At its first meeting the Dáil adopted a brief, provisional constitution known as the Dáil Constitution, as well as a series of basic laws, notably the Democratic Programme. It also passed a Declaration of Independence.

===Ministry===
The Dáil Constitution vested executive authority in a cabinet called the Ministry of Dáil Éireann (or in Irish). The Ministry was answerable to the Dáil which elected its head, known initially as the President of Dáil Éireann (). He in turn appointed the ministers. According to the original version of the constitution enacted in January 1919, there were to be four ministers:
:# Minister of Finance ()
:# Minister of Home Affairs ()
:# Minister of Foreign Affairs ()
:# Minister of National Defence ()

In April 1919, the ministry was increased in size to not more than nine ministers. In August 1921, it was changed again with the title President of the Republic used, suggesting a position of head of state. A ministry of six was created. These were:
:# Minister of Finance
:# Minister of Foreign Affairs
:# Minister of Home Affairs
:# Minister of Defence
:# Minister of Local Government
:# Minister of Economic Affairs

A number of previous cabinet ministers, notably Constance Markievicz, were demoted to under-secretary level.

The Ministry met as often as secrecy and safety allowed.

===Heads of state and government===
Initially, partly because of the division between republicans and monarchists, the Irish Republic had no head of state. The Republic&#x27;s leader was known initially as the , literally &quot;prime minister&quot; but referred to in the as &quot;President of the Ministry&quot;. Later the English title &quot;President of Dáil Éireann&quot; also came to be used for the same post, especially during President de Valera&#x27;s tour of the United States. On 26 August 1921, de Valera had the Dáil appoint him to the new post of &quot;President of the Republic&quot;, so that he would be regarded as the head of state in the forthcoming Treaty negotiations. This was to assert the claim that the negotiations were between two sovereign states (Ireland&#x27;s view), and not that it was between the British government and local politicians (Britain&#x27;s view). After de Valera&#x27;s resignation in January 1922, his successors Griffith and Cosgrave called themselves &quot;President of Dáil Éireann&quot;.

===Military===
The military branch of the Irish Republic were the Irish Volunteers who, in the course of the War of Independence, who were formally renamed the &quot;Irish Republican Army&quot; to reflect their status as the national army of the declared republic. Despite being theoretically under the command of the Dáil&#x27;s Ministry, in practice individual IRA columns enjoyed a high level of autonomy, subject to H.Q. in Dublin. Arrangements were made in August 1920 for the volunteers to swear an oath of allegiance to the Dáil.

===Judiciary and police===
The judicial arm of the Irish Republic consisted of a network of Dáil Courts administered by IRA officers, which at first operated in parallel with the British judicial system, and gradually came to supersede it as public opinion swung against the British in some parts of the island. British law allowed for the arbitration of disputes, provided the parties agreed to it, and as the Dáil Courts were initially described as arbitration panels it was impossible to outlaw them. In other cases the Dáil Courts proved more popular because of the speed and efficiency of their functioning, compared to the local Assize courts. They proved unable to deal with violent crimes but acquired a good reputation with farmers, particularly in dealing harshly with cases of cattle rustling.

The enforcement of law and the decrees of the Dáil Courts was vested in the Irish Republican Police.

== Functionality ==
The Irish Republic had some of the attributes of a functioning state; a ministry (with a head of state in the latter stages), a parliament, a courts system, a police force and a constitution. The extent to which these functioned fluctuated in different parts of the island, with the success or otherwise of republican institutions depending both on the degree of control of the IRA in the region and on the brutality of the Black and Tans and Auxiliaries, active from June 1920 to July 1921. The more brutal the &#x27;Tans&#x27; the more they alienated the local populace from the Dublin Castle administration and Assize courts and the greater success the republican alternatives had. Some measures such as the Dáil Decree of 6 August 1920 prohibiting emigration without a permit were violently enforced.

At the height of the Irish War of Independence, as atrocities committed by the Black and Tans reached such a scale as to result in the burning of the city of Cork (leading to widespread criticism in the United States and from King George V), the Republican Police and Dáil courts reached their zenith, and senior barristers who had qualified within the British courts system also represented defendants in the Dáil Courts. But even after the Truce of July 1921, when the Tans had stopped their activities, the continuing effectiveness of the Dáil courts and police was seen to be patchy. This was in part due to standing down the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) in early 1922 before a new police force was ready to operate; in the interim the Irish Republican Army (IRA), dividing within itself over the Treaty, was the only police force.

The main function of the Dáil courts was in resolving civil cases and very rarely dealt with criminal matters. The cabinet met frequently, though necessarily in secret, and dealt with everyday matters as well as the conduct of the war. The Dáil sat for 21 days before the Truce of July 1921, and more frequently after that.

Support for the Republic, though it ebbed and flowed constantly during the war, was strongest in the south of the country. The claim to authority of the Irish Republic was rejected in Unionist-dominated Northern Ireland and south County Dublin.

==Recognition==
Efforts by President de Valera in the United States and by the Republic&#x27;s &quot;ambassador&quot; at the Versailles Peace Conference, Seán T. O&#x27;Kelly, to win international recognition failed. O&#x27;Kelly had already established the Republic&#x27;s &quot;embassy&quot; in Paris in April 1919, and Dr. Patrick McCartan set one up in Washington, D.C. at the same time. Despite heavy lobbying from prominent Irish-Americans, President Woodrow Wilson refused to raise the Irish case at the conference as he did not want to antagonise the British. Finally in June &quot;Ireland&#x27;s demand for recognition&quot; was conveyed to Georges Clemenceau, the Conference Chairman, without effect.

In June 1920, a &quot;Draft Treaty between the new Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic and the Republic of Ireland&quot; was circulated in Dublin. E. H. Carr, the historian of early Bolshevism, considered that &quot;… the negotiations were not taken very seriously on either side.&quot;

The issue of recognition raises the question of how much the new Dáil, particularly de Valera, fully appreciated the developing relationship between the victorious powers following the war. Wilson had promised self-determination for nations and international norms were changing. Article V. of Wilson&#x27;s &#x27;Fourteen Points&#x27; outlined in January 1918 did not, however, promise that all colonies would be decolonised on demand at the end of the war, but that a colonial population&#x27;s claim for arbitration would have &quot;equal weight&quot; with any claim by its government. In declaring independence unilaterally for the whole island, the new republic had denied &quot;equal weight&quot; to the wishes of Britain or the Irish loyalists. Having misunderstood or misread this part of Wilson&#x27;s formula, the Dáil still required his support against his main ally.

The obvious problem was that the Irish Republic&#x27;s Declaration of Independence of January 1919 was hostile to Britain, which was one of the four main powers arranging terms at Versailles. The RSFSR was also not invited to Versailles. Although armistices were holding, World War I was technically unfinished until the treaties ending it were signed, starting with Germany on 28 June 1919. The British view was that the 69 new Sinn Féin members of parliament had chosen not to take their seats at Westminster (to the relief of the Conservative Party), and that an Irish settlement would be arranged after the more important treaties with the former Central Powers had been signed off, involving Sinn Féin as the representatives of the majority, whether or not it had proclaimed a republic.

The Irish Republic was never recognised by the British government. Because its original contents were not seen as workable, the government under David Lloyd George abandoned plans to amend the Third Home Rule Act enacted in 1914, having called the Irish Convention in 1917–18. The British cabinet started in September 1919 to work from Walter Long&#x27;s 1918 proposals, and in December 1920 they enacted the Government of Ireland Act 1920. This allowed for two home rule Irelands, partitioning Ireland into Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland. Each Ireland was to have a two bicameral parliaments, with a shared chief executive, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and a Council of Ireland which was intended to be an embryonic all-Ireland single parliament. The proposal was greeted with mild enthusiasm among Irish Unionists in the new Northern Ireland, who had never sought their own home rule, but was rejected by a combination of Irish Republicans, Irish Nationalists and Irish Unionists who were not in Northern Ireland. While rejecting the right of the British parliament to legislate for Ireland, Sinn Féin took the opportunity of the two general elections in May 1921, one in the north and one in the south, to seek a renewed mandate for the Republic. No contests resulted in the south, with all seats returning the nominated Sinn Féin candidate apart from Dublin University. The new Northern Ireland parliament in Belfast first sat on 7 June 1921 with a large Ulster Unionist majority and, while it did not formally recognise the Republic, its premier, Sir James Craig, had secretly met with Éamon de Valera in Dublin in May 1921. This was a recognition of de Valera&#x27;s position, but also recognition by de Valera that Craig could not be ignored.

The Truce signed between representatives of the Dáil and Britain was agreed on 9 July 1921, to become effective from noon on 11 July. This marked the end of the Irish War of Independence. On 14 July 1921 Éamon de Valera met David Lloyd George in London for the first time to find some common ground for a settlement. He had been invited as: &quot;the chosen leader of the great majority in Southern Ireland&quot;, but tried to extend this to a British recognition of the republic. Lloyd George made it clear to him, &#x27;that the achievement of a republic through negotiation was impossible&#x27;. In August, in preparation for the formalities, de Valera had the Dáil upgrade his status from prime minister to full President of the Republic. As a head of state he then accredited &quot;envoys plenipotentiary&quot;, an accreditation approved by the Dáil. This accreditation gave them the legal ability to sign a treaty without waiting for approval from the Republic&#x27;s cabinet, some of whose members were among the envoys. However, the British view was that they were not envoys, and they recognised them only as elected members of parliament representing those Irish people who wanted independence in one form or another.

By September, the British called for a conference with the envoys &quot;&quot;to ascertain how the association of Ireland with the community of nations known as the British Empire can best be reconciled with Irish national aspirations&quot;. De Valera replied on 12 September &quot;Our nation has formally declared its independence and recognises itself as a sovereign State.&quot;&quot; The same invitation was repeated and negotiations started on 11 October.

== Anglo-Irish Treaty ==
Each side in the 1921 negotiations used sufficiently elastic language to enable the Republic&#x27;s delegates to suggest that what was taking place was inter-state negotiations, while allowing the British Government to suggest that it was an internal United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland matter. The Anglo-Irish Treaty, when signed on 6 December, was similarly put through three processes to satisfy both sides. It was:
* passed by Dáil Éireann, to satisfy the belief in the Republic&#x27;s supporters that it was a state and its parliament was sovereign;
* passed by the United Kingdom, to satisfy British constitutional theory that a treaty had been negotiated between His Majesty&#x27;s Government and His Majesty&#x27;s subjects in Ireland;
* passed by the House of Commons of Southern Ireland, to reflect the belief in British constitutional law that Ireland already possessed a home rule parliament. In reality the House of Commons had the same membership (bar four) as the Dáil, though anti-Treaty members of the House stayed away.

Finally, the two structures of government (the British government&#x27;s administration in Dublin Castle and the Republic&#x27;s) began a process of convergence, to cover the year until the coming into force of the new Irish Free State.

== Dissolution ==

By approving the Anglo-Irish Treaty on 7 January 1922 and the Constitution of the Irish Free State in October 1922 the Dáil agreed to the replacement of the Republic with the system of constitutional monarchy of the Irish Free State.

In January 1922, a Provisional Government came into being, but the Irish Republic was not dismantled; its institutions continued to operate in parallel with those of the provisional authority. Michael Collins was designated as Chairman of the Provisional Government, in theory answerable to the House of Commons of Southern Ireland and appointed by the Lord Lieutenant. In contrast, the Republic&#x27;s Ministry continued with Arthur Griffith as President of the Republic following de Valera&#x27;s resignation. However the two administrations were progressively merged until in August, following the deaths of both Griffith and Collins, W. T. Cosgrave assumed both leadership positions simultaneously and so the two most important offices effectively became one, producing a unique constitutional hybrid; a crown-appointed prime minister &quot;and&quot; a president of a republic. Both parliaments, the Second Dáil and the House of Commons, were replaced by a joint parliament known variously as the Third Dáil or the &quot;Provisional Parliament&quot;, elected on 16 June 1922. As a constituent assembly this enacted a new constitution with the passage of the Irish Free State Constitution Act.

On 6 December 1922, the Constitution of the Irish Free State came into effect and the institutions of both the Irish Republic and the Provisional Government ceased to exist.

== Legacy ==
The goal of those who established the Irish Republic was to create an independent republic comprising the whole island of Ireland. They failed in this goal, but the Irish Republic paved the way for the creation of the Irish Free State, a Commonwealth dominion with self-government. By 1937, under a new constitution, the Free State became a fully independent republic with the self-designation &#x27;Ireland&#x27;. The principle of an all-island Republic remains a central aspiration of at least three of the main political parties in the Republic of Ireland (Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Sinn Féin) and of two of the main political parties in Northern Ireland (Sinn Féin and the SDLP).

== Irish Republic in the post-Treaty Republican tradition ==

Since the Civil War during 1922 and 1923, the Irish Republic has been an important symbol for radical republicans, amongst others. The Civil War began in June 1922 when both Sinn Féin and the IRA split between those pragmatists, who supported the Treaty, and the hardline republicans who opposed the compromises it contained. In particular the anti-Treaty faction objected to the continued role in the Irish constitution that would be granted to the British monarch under the Irish Free State. When the Dáil ratified the Treaty its opponents mostly walked out, arguing that the Dáil was attempting to &#x27;destroy&#x27; the Irish Republic, and that its members had no right to do so. After the Irish electorate voted in a majority of pro-Treaty candidates to the Dáil, Éamon de Valera declared that &quot;the people have no right to do wrong.&quot;

Opponents of the Treaty refused to recognise either the Provisional Government or, when it was established, the Irish Free State, insisting that the Irish Republic continued to exist as a entity. Their line of authority included some TDs but also the &quot;Army Executive&quot; of the IRA which decided in early 1922 that it, and no longer the Dáil, was the only body loyal to the republic. In August 1920 it had sworn allegiance to both the Dáil and the republic, and felt that the Dáil had broken its oath when it voted to approve the Treaty. Arguments about abandoning the republic had, however, been very fully discussed during the Treaty Debates.

The anti-treaty faction also refused to recognise the Third Dáil elected in June 1922, as the Second Dáil had not met to dissolve itself formally (though the &quot;declaration of election&quot; on 19 May, which gave dates for nominations and the election, was not opposed at the time). Anti-Treaty Republicans considered the Third Dáil, and all future institutions arising from it, as illegal, even though some had been elected to sit in it (See Second Dáil).

The anti-Treaty side was then defeated in the Civil War. Most militant opposition to the Free State came to an end on 24 May 1923 when Frank Aiken, chief-of-staff of the IRA, issued the order to &quot;dump arms&quot;, and Éamon de Valera issued his address to the &quot;Legion of the Rearguard&quot;. Éamon de Valera continued as president Sinn Féin. In March 1926, de Valera, along with most anti-Treaty politicians, founded a new party called Fianna Fáil and ended their boycott of the institutions of the Free State.

Nonetheless, a hard-line minority continued to reject the legitimacy of the Free State and its successor, the Republic of Ireland. In 1938, a group calling itself the Executive Council of the Second Dáil delegated its self-declared authority to the IRA Army Council. The Irish Republican Army ultimately ceased military operations against Ireland in 1948, but continued to consider itself the legitimate government of Ireland. The Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA) split with the original IRA in December 1969 and afterward claimed that it was the sole legitimate representative of the Irish Republic. It based its claim, in part, on the support of Second Dáil member Tom Maguire. The PIRA conducted a campaign of bombings and shootings in Northern Ireland from the late 1960s until 1998, and its political wing, the modern Sinn Féin party, used to insist that the Irish Republic was still legally in existence, with the Provisional IRA as its national army, and the IRA Army Council Ireland&#x27;s sole legitimate government. This view is still upheld by Republican Sinn Féin and the Continuity IRA. Until their disbandment, the Provisional IRA continued to use the title (lit. Volunteers of Ireland), the official Irish title for the Irish Defence Forces. Continuity IRA based their claims in part on the support they received from the last surviving anti-treaty Second Dáil member, Tom Maguire.

<text>María del Rosario Goico Rodríguez, (born on May 23, 1949 in Santa Lucía), better known in show business as simply Charytín Goyco or Charytín, is a Dominican singer, comedian, television hostess and actress.

==Early life==
Born in Santa Lucía, El Seibo, to a Dominican father (of Russian, Serbian, Montenegrin, French and Spanish ancestry), and a Spaniard mother (her mother was an attorney from Asturias, Spain who found herself exiled during the regime of Francisco Franco). At an early age, her mother took her and her sister to Spain after breaking up with her father. She returned to the Dominican Republic after nearly ten years of living abroad, when her parents reconciled.

==Career==
Charytín moved to Puerto Rico in the 1970s. She met her husband, television actor and producer Elín Ortiz while he was visiting the Dominican Republic and he became her manager. He was recently divorced from Puerto Rican vedette Iris Chacón. Later Charytín and Ortiz started a relationship and married in 1974. During the 1970s, she began a weekly TV show on WAPA-TV, which aired every Sunday night until 1985.

Charytín became an international superstar with her song &quot;Mosquita Muerta&quot;, named after a character she played on a comedy section of her show, becoming a chart topper in places like Mexico, Venezuela, and Argentina.

In 1974 she represented her country, the Dominican Republic in the third edition of the OTI Festival which was held in Acapulco, México, in which she achieved for her country the fifth place with seven points. In 1979, she and Elín had their first son, Shalim, who is now a singer and actor who has appeared on Lizzie McGuire and Heroes.

In 1983, Charytín made a movie in Spanish named &quot;Prohibido Amar en Nueva York&quot; with Mexican actor Julio Alemán. (&quot;Forbidden To Love in New York&quot;). Two of the songs on that movie&#x27;s soundtrack, &quot;Tu Vida Es Un Suspenso Hasta El Final&quot; &amp; &quot;Para Llegar&quot;, became another chart toppers for Charytín. In 1986, she and Iris Chacón acted together, alongside Dominican-Mexican actor Andrés García and Puerto Rican best selling singer, Yolandita Monge, on a soap opera named &quot;Escandalo&quot;. This telenovela did not enjoy much success and was cut by half by the producers. In 1988, she moved to Miami with Elin and Shalim, and in late 1989, she became pregnant again, giving birth in 1990 to twins, a boy (Alexander) and a girl (Sharinna) born at Pavia Hospital in San Juan, Puerto Rico.

During the early 1990s, she dedicated herself to raise her twins, taking them along on the few tours she did and her several trips to Puerto Rico. Late in the 1990s, she returned to television, hosting a show for a television shopping network. Additionally, she worked on commercials promoting Palmolive dish washing products for several years, most of which featured her twins.

In 2002 she began hosting a celebrity gossip show, &quot;Escándalo TV&quot; along Marisa del Portillo, Felipe Viel and Lilia Luciano for TeleFutura.

On April 19, 2003, Charytín won the Asociación de Cronistas de Espectáculos de Nueva York&#x27;s &quot;Premio Extraordinario ACE por Distinción y Mérito&quot; (&quot;ACE Extraordinary Award for Distinction and Merit&quot;) at its 35th Annual ACE Awards presentation.

She used to host a daily entertainment news show for Univisión Sister Station TeleFutura. This was a 2-hour gossip/entertainment show &quot;Escándalo TV&quot; (formerly &quot;Escándalo en el Medio Dia&quot;, but later changed due to a similarly named program airing in Mexico by Televisa S.A.) In 2007, the Art Critics Association of the Dominican Republic recognized her work with a Lifetime Achievement Award.
Later on, she had a new TV show ,&quot;CHARYTÍN&quot;, on Mega TV from Monday to Friday.

<text>Giovanni Pico dei conti della Mirandola e della Concordia ( ; ; ; 24 February 146317 November 1494), known as Pico della Mirandola, was an Italian Renaissance nobleman and philosopher. He is famed for the events of 1486, when, at the age of 23, he proposed to defend 900 theses on religion, philosophy, natural philosophy, and magic against all comers, for which he wrote the &quot;Oration on the Dignity of Man&quot;, which has been called the &quot;Manifesto of the Renaissance&quot;, and a key text of Renaissance humanism and of what has been called the &quot;Hermetic Reformation&quot;. He was the founder of the tradition of Christian Kabbalah, a key tenet of early modern Western esotericism. The &quot;900 Theses&quot; was the first printed book to be universally banned by the Church. Pico is sometimes seen as a proto-Protestant, because his 900 theses anticipated many Protestant views.

== Biography ==
=== Family ===

Giovanni was born at Mirandola, near Modena, the youngest son of Gianfrancesco I Pico, Lord of Mirandola and Count of Concordia, by his wife Giulia, daughter of Feltrino Boiardo, Count of Scandiano. The family had long dwelt in the Castle of Mirandola (Duchy of Modena), which had become independent in the fourteenth century and had received in 1414 from the Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund the fief of Concordia. Mirandola was a small autonomous county (later, a duchy) in Emilia, near Ferrara. The Pico della Mirandola were closely related to the Sforza, Gonzaga and Este dynasties, and Giovanni&#x27;s siblings wed the descendants of the hereditary rulers of Corsica, Ferrara, Bologna, and Forlì.

Born twenty-three years into his parents&#x27; marriage, Giovanni had two much older brothers, both of whom outlived him: Count Galeotto I continued the dynasty, while Antonio became a general in the Imperial army. The Pico family would reign as dukes until Mirandola, an ally of Louis XIV of France, was conquered by his rival, Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor, in 1708 and annexed to Modena by Duke Rinaldo d&#x27;Este, the exiled male line becoming extinct in 1747.

Giovanni&#x27;s maternal family was singularly distinguished in the arts and scholarship of the Italian Renaissance. His cousin and contemporary was the poet Matteo Maria Boiardo, who grew up under the influence of his own uncle, the Florentine patron of the arts and scholar-poet Tito Vespasiano Strozzi.

Giovanni had a paradoxical relationship with his nephew Giovanni Francesco Pico della Mirandola, who was a great admirer of his uncle, yet published &quot;Examen vanitatis doctrinae gentium&quot; (1520) in opposition to the espoused by Giovanni, described by historian Charles B. Schmitt as an attempt 

=== Education ===

A precocious child with an exceptional memory, Giovanni was schooled in Latin and possibly Greek at a very early age. Intended for the Church by his mother, he was named a papal protonotary (probably honorary) at the age of 10 and in 1477, he went to Bologna to study canon law.

At the sudden death of his mother three years later, Pico renounced canon law and began to study philosophy at the University of Ferrara. During a brief trip to Florence, he met Angelo Poliziano, the courtly poet Girolamo Benivieni, and probably the young Dominican friar Girolamo Savonarola. For the rest of his life, he remained very close friends with all three. He may also have been a lover of Poliziano.

From 1480 to 1482, he continued his studies at the University of Padua, a major centre of Aristotelianism in Italy. Already proficient in Latin and Greek, he studied Hebrew and Arabic in Padua with Elia del Medigo, a Jewish Averroist, and read Aramaic manuscripts with him as well. Del Medigo also translated Judaic manuscripts from Hebrew into Latin for Pico, as he would continue to do for a number of years. Pico also wrote sonnets in Latin and Italian which, because of the influence of Savonarola, he destroyed at the end of his life.

He spent the next four years either at home or visiting humanist centres elsewhere in Italy. In 1485, he travelled to the University of Paris, the most important centre in Europe for scholastic philosophy and theology, and a hotbed of secular Averroism. It was probably in Paris that Giovanni began his &quot;900 Theses&quot; and conceived the idea of defending them in public debate.

=== &quot;900 Theses&quot; ===
During this time two life-changing events occurred. The first was when he returned to settle for a time in Florence in November 1484 and met Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici and Marsilio Ficino. It was an astrologically auspicious day that Ficino had chosen to publish his translations of the works of Plato from Greek into Latin, under Lorenzo&#x27;s enthusiastic patronage. Pico appears to have charmed both men, and despite Ficino&#x27;s philosophical differences, he was convinced of their Saturnine affinity and the divine providence of his arrival. Lorenzo would support and protect Pico until his death in 1492.
Soon after this stay in Florence, Pico was travelling on his way to Rome where he intended to publish his &quot;900 Theses&quot; and prepare for a congress of scholars from all over Europe to debate them. Stopping in Arezzo he became embroiled in a love affair with the wife of one of Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici&#x27;s cousins, which almost cost him his life. Giovanni attempted to run off with the woman, but he was caught, wounded and thrown into prison by her husband. He was released only upon the intervention of Lorenzo himself.

Pico spent several months in Perugia and nearby Fratta, recovering from his injuries. It was there, as he wrote to Ficino, that Pico was introduced in Perugia to the mystical Hebrew &quot;Kabbalah&quot;, which fascinated him, as did the late classical Hermetic writers, such as Hermes Trismegistus. The &quot;Kabbalah&quot; and &quot;Hermetica&quot; were thought in Pico&#x27;s time to be as ancient as the Old Testament. Pico&#x27;s &quot;tutor&quot; in Kabbalah was Rabbi Johannan Alemanno (1430s – c. 1510), who argued that the study and mastery of magic was to be regarded as the final stage of one&#x27;s intellectual and spiritual education.

This contact, initiated as a result of Christian interest in probing the ancient wisdom found in Jewish mystical sources, resulted in unprecedented mutual influence between Jewish and Christian Renaissance thought. The most original of Pico&#x27;s 900 theses concerned the &quot;Kabbalah&quot;. As a result, he became the founder of the tradition known as Christian Kabbalah, which went on to be a central part of early modern Western esotericism. Pico&#x27;s approach to different philosophies was one of extreme syncretism, placing them in parallel, it has been claimed, rather than attempting to describe a developmental history.

Pico based his ideas chiefly on Plato, as did his teacher, Marsilio Ficino, but retained a deep respect for Aristotle. Although he was a product of the &quot;studia humanitatis&quot;, Pico was constitutionally an eclectic, and in some respects he represented a reaction against the exaggerations of pure humanism, defending what he believed to be the best of the medieval and Islamic commentators, such as Averroes and Avicenna, on Aristotle in a famous long letter to Ermolao Barbaro in 1485. It was always Pico&#x27;s aim to reconcile the schools of Plato and Aristotle since he believed they used different words to express the same concepts. It was perhaps for this reason his friends called him &quot;Princeps Concordiae&quot;, or &quot;Prince of Harmony&quot; (a pun on Prince of Concordia, one of his family&#x27;s holdings). Similarly, Pico believed that an educated person should also study Hebrew and Talmudic sources, and the Hermetics, because he thought they represented the same concept of God that is seen in the Old Testament, but in different words.

He finished his &quot;Oration on the Dignity of Man&quot; to accompany his &quot;900 Theses&quot; and travelled to Rome to continue his plan to defend them. He had them published together in December 1486 as &quot;Conclusiones philosophicae, cabalasticae et theologicae&quot;, and offered to pay the expenses of any scholars who came to Rome to debate them publicly. He wanted the debate to begin on 6 January, which was, as historian Steven Farmer has observed, the feast of Epiphany and . After emerging victorious at the culmination of the debate, Pico planned not only on the symbolic acquiescence of the pagan sages, but also the conversion of Jews as they realised that Jesus was the true secret of their traditions. According to Farmer, Pico may have been expecting quite literally that &quot;his Vatican debate would end with the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse crashing through the Roman skies&quot;.
In February 1487, Pope Innocent VIII halted the proposed debate, and established a commission to review the orthodoxy of the &quot;900 Theses&quot;. Although Pico answered the charges against them, thirteen theses were condemned. Pico agreed in writing to retract them, but he did not change his mind about their validity. Eventually, all 900 theses were condemned. He proceeded to write an &quot;apologia&quot; defending them, &quot;Apologia J. Pici Mirandolani, Concordiae comitis&quot;, published in 1489, which he dedicated to his patron, Lorenzo. When the pope was apprised of the circulation of this manuscript, he set up an inquisitorial tribunal, forcing Pico to renounce the &quot;Apologia&quot;, in addition to his condemned theses, which he agreed to do. The pope censured &quot;900 Theses&quot; as:
This was the first time that a printed book had been banned by the Church, and nearly all copies were burned. Pico fled to France in 1488, where he was arrested by Philip II, Duke of Savoy, at the demand of the papal nuncios, and imprisoned at Vincennes. Through the intercession of several Italian princes – all instigated by Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici – King Charles VIII had him released, and the pope was persuaded to allow Pico to move to Florence and to live under Lorenzo&#x27;s protection. But he was not cleared of the papal censures and restrictions until 1493, after the accession of Alexander VI (Rodrigo Borgia) to the papacy.

The experience deeply shook Pico. He reconciled with Savonarola, who remained a very close friend. It was at Pico&#x27;s persuasion that Lorenzo invited Savonarola to Florence. But Pico never renounced his syncretist convictions. He settled in a villa near Fiesole prepared for him by Lorenzo, where he wrote and published the &quot;Heptaplus id est de Dei creatoris opere&quot; (1489) and &quot;De Ente et Uno&quot; (&quot;Of Being and Unity&quot;, 1491). It was here that he also wrote his other most celebrated work, the &quot;Disputationes adversus astrologiam divinicatrium&quot; (&quot;Treatise Against Predictive Astrology&quot;), which was not published until after his death. In it, Pico acidly condemned the deterministic practices of the astrologers of his day.

After the death of Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici, in 1492, Pico moved to Ferrara, although he continued to visit Florence. In Florence, political instability gave rise to the increasing influence of Savonarola, whose reactionary opposition to Renaissance expansion and style had already brought about conflict with the Medici family (they eventually were expelled from Florence) and would lead to the wholesale destruction of books and paintings. Nevertheless, Pico became a follower of Savonarola. Determined to become a monk, he dismissed his former interest in Egyptian and Chaldean texts, destroyed his own poetry and gave away his fortune.

=== Death ===

In 1494, at the age of 31, Pico died under mysterious circumstances along with his friend Poliziano.

It was rumoured that his own secretary had poisoned him because Pico had become too close to Savonarola. He was interred together with Girolamo Benivieni at San Marco, and Savonarola delivered the funeral oration. Ficino wrote: 

In 2007, the bodies of Poliziano and Pico were exhumed from the Church of San Marco in Florence to establish the causes of their deaths. Forensic tests showed that both Poliziano and Pico likely died of arsenic poisoning, possibly at the order of Lorenzo&#x27;s successor, Piero de&#x27; Medici. Subsequent scientific investigation found that while Pico may have died from acute arsenic poisoning (intentional or otherwise), there was not enough evidence to conclude the same for Poliziano, and levels of arsenic found in his remains may have been from chronic exposure or have taken place post-mortem.

== Writings ==
In the &quot;Oratio de hominis dignitate&quot; (&quot;Oration on the Dignity of Man&quot;, 1486), Pico justified the importance of the human quest for knowledge, masterfully blending Neoplatonism and Aristotelian Scholasticism.

The &quot;Oration&quot; also served as an introduction to Pico&#x27;s 900 theses, which he believed to provide a complete and sufficient basis for the discovery of all knowledge, and hence a model for mankind&#x27;s ascent of the chain of being. The 900 Theses are a good example of humanist syncretism, because Pico combined Platonism, Neoplatonism, Aristotelianism, Hermeticism and Kabbalah. They also included 72 theses describing what Pico believed to be a complete system of physics.

Pico&#x27;s &quot;De animae immortalitate&quot; (Paris, 1541), and other works, developed the doctrine that man&#x27;s possession of an immortal soul freed him from the hierarchical stasis. Pico believed in universal reconciliation, as one of his 900 theses was it was among the theses pronounced heretical by Pope Innocent VIII in his bull of 4 August 1487.

In the &quot;Oration&quot; he argues, in the words of Pier Cesare Bori, that 

A portion of his &quot;Disputationes adversus astrologiam divinatricem&quot; was published in Bologna after his death. In this book, Pico presents arguments against the practice of astrology that have had enormous resonance for centuries, up to our own time. &quot;Disputationes&quot; is influenced by the arguments against astrology espoused by one of his intellectual heroes, Augustine of Hippo, and also by the medieval philosophical tale &quot;Ḥayy ibn Yaqẓān&quot; by ibn Tufail, which promoted autodidacticism as a philosophical program.

Pico&#x27;s antagonism to astrology seems to derive mainly from the conflict of astrology with Christian notions of free will. But Pico&#x27;s arguments moved beyond the objections of Ficino, who was himself an astrologer. The manuscript was edited for publication after Pico&#x27;s death by his nephew Giovanni Francesco Pico della Mirandola, an ardent follower of Savonarola, and may possibly have been amended to be more forcefully critical. This might possibly explain the fact that Ficino championed the manuscript and enthusiastically endorsed it before its publication.

Early in his career, Pico wrote a &quot;Commento sopra una canzone d&#x27;amore di Girolamo Benivieni&quot;, in which he revealed his plan to write a book entitled &quot;Poetica Theologia&quot;:
Pico&#x27;s &quot;Heptaplus&quot;, a mystical-allegorical exposition of the creation according to the seven Biblical senses, elaborates on his idea that different religions and traditions describe the same God. The book is written in his characteristic apologetic and polemic style:

&quot;On Being and the One&quot; () has explanations of several passages in the Pentateuch, Plato and Aristotle. It is an attempted reconciliation between Platonic and Aristotelian writings on the relative places of being and &quot;the one&quot; and a refutation of opposing arguments.

He wrote in Italian an imitation of Plato&#x27;s &quot;Symposium&quot;. His letters (&quot;Aureae ad familiares epistolae&quot; Paris, 1499) are important for the history of contemporary thought. The many editions of his entire works in the sixteenth century sufficiently prove his influence.

Another notorious text by Pico is &quot;De omnibus rebus et de quibusdam aliis&quot; (&quot;Of all things that exist and a little more&quot;), which is mentioned in some entries on Thomas More&#x27;s &quot;Utopia&quot; and makes fun of the title of Lucretius&#x27; &quot;De rerum natura&quot;.

* The beardless young man in Raphael&#x27;s fresco &quot;The School of Athens&quot; (1509–11) is thought to be Pico della Mirandola (or maybe Francesco della Rovere). Christiane Joost-Gaugier described Pico della Mirandola as 
* In James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot;, the precocious Stephen Dedalus recalls with disdain his boyhood ambitions, and apparently associates them with the career of Mirandola: 
* Of minor interest is a passing reference to Mirandola by H. P. Lovecraft, in the story &quot;The Case of Charles Dexter Ward&quot; (1927). Mirandola is given as the source of the fearsome incantation used by unknown evil entities as some sort of evocation. However, this &quot;spell&quot; was first depicted (as the key to a rather simple form of divination, not a great and terrible summoning) by, and in all likelihood created by, Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa von Nettesheim in his &quot;Three Books of Occult Philosophy&quot;. This was written several decades after Mirandola&#x27;s death and was the first written example of that &quot;spell&quot;, so it is almost impossible for Mirandola to have been the source of those &quot;magic words&quot;.
* Psychoanalyst Otto Rank, a rebellious disciple of Sigmund Freud, chose a substantial excerpt from Mirandola&#x27;s &quot;Oration on the Dignity of Man&quot; as the motto for his book &quot;Art and Artist: Creative Urge and Personality Development&quot;, including: .
* In Umberto Eco&#x27;s novel &quot;Foucault&#x27;s Pendulum&quot; the protagonist Casaubon claims that the idea that the Jews were privy to the enigma of the Templars was &quot;a mistake of Pico Della Mirandola&quot; caused by a spelling mistake he made between &quot;Israelites&quot; and &quot;Ismaelites&quot;.
* In Irving Stone&#x27;s novel about Michelangelo, &quot;The Agony and the Ecstasy&quot;, book 3, part 3 contains a paragraph&#x27;s description of Mirandola as part of the scholarly circle that surrounded Lorenzo di Medici in Florence. Mirandola was described as a man who spoke 22 languages, was deeply read in philosophy, and someone who made no enemies.
* Philosopher of social science René Girard mentions Mirandola passingly in his book , Girard writes in a disparaging tone, (p.141, 1987)
* In Roberto Bolaño&#x27;s novel &quot;2666&quot;, the philosophy professor Oscar Amalfitano begins his three-columned list of philosophers with Pico della Mirandola. Adjacent to Mirandola, Amalfitano writes Hobbes, while beneath him he writes Husserl (p.207, 2008).
* In Frédéric Lenoir&#x27;s novel &quot;L&#x27;Oracle della Luna&quot; (2006), the philosophy of Pico della Mirandola forms one of the major teachings acquired by the protagonist, Giovanni, from his main spiritual Master. The year is 1530. The major mentions are:
** at the end of Chapter 21 the sage – a fictitious character – says he has personally met Pico della Mirandola and discusses Mirandola&#x27;s disagreement with the pope about the 900 Theses (with Lenoir stating that only 7 of them had not been accepted) and the philosopher&#x27;s later fate. In the words of the sage, the main goal of Ficino and Pico della Mirandola was to acquire universal knowledge, free from prejudice and from linguistic and religious barriers;
** at the end of Chapter 24, having discussed Luther&#x27;s concept of free will, the sage wants to acquaint Giovanni with Mirandola&#x27;s ideas on this issue and lets him read &quot;De hominis dignitate&quot;; Giovanni peruses the book with great interest in Chapter 25;
** at the beginning of Chapter 26, with Giovanni having now read the &quot;Oration on the Dignity of Man&quot;, the sage discusses two issues from the book with him. One is Pico della Mirandola&#x27;s attempt to form one unified and universal philosophy and the difficulties thereof. The other one is Mirandola&#x27;s concept of free will. Giovanni has learnt one passage from the book by heart, about God addressing man and telling him, that He has made him neither a heavenly nor an earthly creature and that man is the forger of his own fate. This passage is quoted in the novel.
* English composer Gavin Bryars made use of the texts of Pico della Mirandola in his musical production; most notably in pieces like &quot;Glorious Hill&quot;, for vocal quartet/mixed choir, &quot;Pico&#x27;s Flight&quot;, for soprano and orchestra, and &quot;Incipit Vita Nova&quot; for alto and string trio.
* Pico della Mirandola appears as the character Ikaros in Jo Walton&#x27;s novels &quot;The Just City&quot; and &quot;The Philosopher Kings&quot;. Also, he is one of the main characters in her novel &quot;Lent&quot;.
* In the book &quot;Dying for Ideas; The Dangerous Lives of the Philosophers&quot; (2015) by Romanian philosopher Costica Bradatan, Mirandola&#x27;s life and work is taken as an early or even first example of taking human life as a project of &#x27;self-fashioning&#x27;, relating this to Mirandola&#x27;s heretic idea of man being part of creation with &#x27;an indefinite nature&#x27;.
* Pico della Mirandola is the protagonist in the short story by Jack Dann &quot;The Glass Casket&quot;, which was published as a part of the Snow White, Blood Red anthology.
* In the graphic novel All-Star Superman by Grant Morrison Giovanni Pico della Mirandola can be seen reciting a part of the Oration on the Dignity of Man.

<text>Edward Mayhoff &#x27;Ed&#x27; Grimley is a fictional character created and portrayed by Martin Short. Developed amongst The Second City improv comedy troupe, Grimley made his television debut on the sketch comedy show &quot;SCTV&quot; in 1982, leading to popular success for both Short and the persona. Short continued to portray Grimley on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and in various other appearances. The character also starred in Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s 1988 animated series &quot;The Completely Mental Misadventures of Ed Grimley&quot;, and appeared in Short&#x27;s comedy specials &quot;I, Martin Short, Goes Hollywood&quot; and &quot;I, Martin Short, Goes Home&quot;.

== Concept and creation ==
Martin Short originated the character on Toronto&#x27;s Second City stage as an unnamed school parent in a sketch. Originally, his hair was simply very greasy and unkempt, but Peter Aykroyd, another cast member, joked offstage that the height of the hair seemed to increase with each performance. In an interview, Short said that he was inspired by a scene from the John Wayne movie &quot;McLintock&quot; and started greasing it straight up. Short noticed an incidental baring of his teeth raised laughs; that too became a character trait. Over numerous appearances, the character of Ed Grimley began to take shape.

Ed Grimley is an excessively cowlicked, voluble, hyperactive manchild who is obsessed with banal popular culture, particularly &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; and its host, Pat Sajak. He also loves to play the triangle, which for him consists of playing a recorded musical piece, striking the triangle once, and then wildly dancing to the recording. His catchphrases include &quot;I must say&quot;, &quot;let&#x27;s face it&quot;, &quot;totally decent&quot;, &quot;makes me completely mental,&quot; and &quot;give me a break&quot;.

== Appearances ==
Short was added to the cast of Second City&#x27;s television offshoot &quot;SCTV&quot; in 1982, debuting the Ed Grimley character in the skit &quot;SCTV Movie of the Week: The Nutty Lab Assistant&quot;. Grimley became an &quot;SCTV&quot; fixture, appearing in the various shows, commercials, promos, and &quot;behind-the-scenes&quot; dramas that made up the fictional channel&#x27;s programming. After the show&#x27;s end in 1984, Short moved to the more prominent &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, bringing his breakout character with him.

With Grimley, his best-known original character, Martin Short&#x27;s popularity on &quot;SNL&quot; proved to be the springboard to a long career in film and TV. He appeared as Ed Grimley in his 1985 Showtime special &quot;Martin Short: Concert For the North Americas&quot;, at Comic Relief 1986, and in 1989&#x27;s &quot;I, Martin Short, Goes Hollywood&quot;. Grimley became a cartoon character in Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s 1988 animated series &quot;The Completely Mental Misadventures of Ed Grimley&quot;, featuring Second City colleagues Joe Flaherty (also reprising his &quot;SCTV&quot; character, Count Floyd), Catherine O&#x27;Hara and Andrea Martin as series regulars.

Short briefly revived the Ed Grimley role in his 1995 series &quot;The Show Formerly Known As the Martin Short Show&quot;, for a spoof of the comedy film &quot;Dave&quot;, and appeared again in a 1996 episode of &quot;Muppets Tonight&quot;, in which Grimley marries Miss Piggy to obtain an $85 inheritance from his deceased great-uncle. The character seemingly died later that year on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, in the skit &quot;Ed Grimley in Heaven&quot;, though Grimley is brought back to life by his guardian angel (played by guest star Chevy Chase) after showing a video of Ed Grimley&#x27;s life and commenting that he needs to do more with it before he can come back to Heaven. Grimley would however make a number of appearances in 1999&#x27;s &quot;The Martin Short (Talk) Show&quot;.

Ed Grimley made a brief onstage appearance, triangle in hand, in the 2006 Broadway show &quot;Martin Short: Fame Becomes Me&quot;. He appeared again in 2009&#x27;s &quot;Let Freedom Hum: An Evening of Comedy Hosted By Martin Short&quot;. Short reprised his role as Ed Grimley in a &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; parody music video of Drake&#x27;s &quot;Hotline Bling&quot; in November 2015 on the season 41 episode hosted by then-Presidential candidate Donald Trump.

<doc id="152577" wikidata="Q693379" url="?curid=152577" title="Petronia gens">
<text>The gens Petronia was a plebeian family at ancient Rome. This gens claimed an ancient lineage, as a Petronius Sabinus is mentioned in the time of Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, the last of the Roman kings, but few Petronii are mentioned in the time of the Republic. They are frequently encountered under the Empire, holding numerous consulships, and eventually obtaining the Empire itself during the brief reign of Petronius Maximus in AD 455.

==Origin==
The Petronii were of Sabine origin, as indicated by the surname &quot;Sabinus&quot;, belonging to the legendary figure from the time of Tarquin, and alluded to by coins minted by Publius Petronius Turpilianus, depicting the death of Tarpeia, whom according to legend was persuaded by the Sabines under Titus Tatius to open the citadel to them, in the time of Romulus. The nomen &quot;Petronius&quot; appears to be a patronymic surname derived from the Oscan praenomen &quot;Petro&quot; or &quot;Petrus&quot;, the Oscan equivalent of the Latin &quot;Quartus&quot;, fourth, and making &quot;Petronius&quot; cognate with a number of obscure Latin gentilicia, such as &quot;Quartius&quot; and &quot;Quartinius&quot;. An alternative derivation would be from the cognomen &quot;Petrus&quot;, a rustic, although this may also derive from the Oscan praenomen. &quot;Petronius&quot; belongs to a large class of gentilicia derived from other names ending in &quot;-o&quot;, most of which are plebeian.

==Praenomina==
The early Petronii used the praenomina &quot;Gaius&quot;, &quot;Marcus&quot;, and &quot;Publius&quot;, all of which were very common throughout Roman history. Other names occur toward the end of the second century AD, including &quot;Quintus&quot;, &quot;Lucius&quot;, and &quot;Sextus&quot;, but these may have been inherited from other families.

==Members==
* Petronius Sabinus, said to have copied the Sibylline Books during the reign of Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, with the assistance of a certain Marcus Tullius or Atilius.

<doc id="152578" wikidata="Q8310435" url="?curid=152578" title="List of heads of state of Mexico">
<text>The Head of State of Mexico is the person who controls the executive power in the country. Under the current constitution, this responsibility lies with the President of the United Mexican States, who is head of the supreme executive power of the Mexican Union. Throughout its history, Mexico has had several forms of government. Under the federal constitutions, the title of President was the same as the current one. Under the Seven Laws (centralist), the chief executive was named &quot;President of the Republic&quot;. In addition, there have been two periods of monarchical rule, during which the executive was controlled by the Emperor of Mexico.

The chronology of the heads of state of Mexico is complicated due to the country&#x27;s political instability during most of the nineteenth century and early decades of the twentieth century. With few exceptions, most of the Mexican presidents elected during this period did not complete their terms. Until the presidency of Lázaro Cárdenas, each president remained in office an average of fifteen months.

This list also includes the self-appointed presidents during civil wars and the collegiate bodies that performed the Mexican Executive duties during periods of transition.

After the end of the Mexican War of Independence, a Provisional Board of Governing consisting of thirty-four persons was set up. The Board decreed and signed the Declaration of Independence and appointed a regency composed of six people.

== Provisional Government (1823–1824) ==
The Provisional Government of 1823–1824 was an organization that served as the Executive in the government of Mexico after the abdication of Agustín I, monarch of Mexican Empire in 1823. The provisional government was responsible for convening the body that created the Federal Republic and existed from 1 April 1823 to 10 October 1824.

== Second Federal Republic (1846–1863) ==


=== Reform War 1858–1860 ===

==== President recognized by the Liberals ====

==== Presidents recognized by the Conservatives ====

== Second Mexican Empire (1863–1867) ==
=== Regency ===
On 22 June 1863, a &quot;Superior Governing Board&quot; was established. On 11 July, the Board became the Regency of the Empire.
=== Monarchy of Maximilian I ===
== Restored Republic (1867–1876) ==


== Porfiriato (1876–1911) ==


== Revolution (1911–1928) ==
;Political parties

=== Presidents recognized by the Convention of Aguascalientes ===

The Conventionists were followers of revolutionary generals Pancho Villa and Emiliano Zapata. They fought a civil war with the followers of revolutionaries under Venustiano Carranza.
=== Constitutionalist victory and restoration of democracy ===
The revolutionary Constitutionalist Army under the authority &quot;First Chief&quot; Venustiano Carranza defeated the Army of the Convention in 1915, with a new constitution drafted in 1916–17.

;Political parties

== Maximato (1928–1934) ==

President-elect Obregón was assassinated before he was inaugurated for a six-year presidential term. Calles brought together revolutionaries to found the National Revolutionary Party (now the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI)). Calles could not succeed himself as president, but he remained the power behind the presidency as the &quot;jefe máximo&quot; (maximum chief).

;Political parties

<doc id="152579" wikidata="Q213928" url="?curid=152579" title="List of prime ministers of Italy">
<text>The prime minister of Italy is the head of the Council of Ministers, which holds effective executive power in the Italian government. The first officeholder was Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour, who was sworn in on 23 March 1861 after the unification of Italy. Cavour previously served as Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Sardinia, an office from which the Italian prime minister took most of its powers and duties. During the monarchy period, prime ministers were appointed by the king of Italy, as laid down in the Albertine Statute. From 1925 until the fall of his regime in 1943, fascist dictator Benito Mussolini formally modified the office title to &quot;Head of Government, Prime Minister and Secretary of State&quot;. From 1861 to 1946, 30 men served as prime ministers, leading 67 governments in total.

After the abolition of the Kingdom of Italy in 1946 and the proclamation of the Italian Republic, the office was established by Articles 92 through 96 of the Constitution of Italy. Alcide De Gasperi is the only prime minister who has held this position both in the Kingdom of Italy and in the Republic of Italy.

The prime minister is appointed by the President of the Republic and must receive a confidence vote by both houses of Parliament: the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. From 1946 to 2022, in the first 76 years after the creation of the Republic, 30 men served as prime ministers. 
The current officeholder is Giorgia Meloni, who was appointed on 22 October 2022, becoming the first woman to hold this office.

The longest-serving prime minister in the history of Italy was Benito Mussolini, who ruled the country from 1922 until 1943; the longest-serving prime minister of the Italian Republic was Silvio Berlusconi, who held the position for more than nine years between 1994 and 2011. The shortest-serving officeholder was Tommaso Tittoni, who served as prime minister for only 16 days in 1905, while the shortest-serving prime minister of the Italian Republic was Fernando Tambroni, who governed for 123 days in 1960.

<text>Mushroom Records was an Australian flagship record label, founded in 1972 in Melbourne. It published and distributed many successful Australian artists and expanded internationally, until it was merged with Festival Records in 1998. Festival Mushroom Records was later acquired by Warner Bros. Records, which operated the label from 2005 to 2010 until it folded to Warner. Founder Michael Gudinski went on to become the leader of the Mushroom Group, the largest independent music and entertainment company in Australia, with divisions such as Frontier Touring.

==History==
Mushroom Records was an Australian record label formed by Michael Gudinski and Ray Evans in Melbourne in 1972. 

Its inaugural release was an ambitious triple live album of the 1973 Sunbury Pop Festival, and over the first few years of its existence Mushroom signed a number of important Australian acts including Madder Lake, Ayers Rock, and MacKenzie Theory. In December 1974, Gudinski flew to the US to promote his recording artists, with Ayers Rock securing a recording contract, and an advance from A&amp;M Records. Ayers Rock were the first Mushroom artist to sign an international recording contract. Mushroom struggled to survive for its first two years and reportedly came close to folding on several occasions. However, the label was dramatically pushed to the forefront of the Australian music scene in early 1975 following the massive success of Skyhooks, whose debut album, &quot;Living in the 70&#x27;s&quot;, became the biggest-selling Australian LP ever released up to that time.

Around the same time, Gudinski was convinced to sign expatriate New Zealand band Split Enz, who had recently relocated to Australia. Although they had only moderate success for the first few years, Split Enz scored huge success in 1980 with the release of their album &quot;True Colours&quot; and the hit single &quot;I Got You&quot;, which marked the emergence of Neil Finn.

In 1978, Gudinski started Suicide, a subsidiary label to Mushroom, to release punk music. Unlike Mushroom, Suicide was distributed by RCA. Its first release was a cover version of &quot;These Boots Are Made For Walking&quot; by The Boys Next Door.

In 1981, Gudinski started another subsidiary, White Label Records, to release what might now be called post-punk music, with signings such as Hunters &amp; Collectors, Machinations, Painters and Dockers, Kids in the Kitchen and The Stems.

In the 1990s, remixer Gavin Campbell&#x27;s Razor Records became a subsidiary of Mushroom.

Mushroom entered the international scene by setting up an International division in London headed by Gary Ashley (deceased 2017). The Australian label had some international success before then by signing The Saints, Dannii Minogue, Kylie Minogue and Jason Donovan in the eighties. However the last two were released internationally through PWL. 

After selling 49% of the company to News Corporation in 1993, Garbage signed to the label via Koda Marshall&#x27;s UK operation, followed by Pop Will Eat Itself, Ash, The Paradise Motel and Peter André.

Gudinski sold the remaining 51% share of the label to News Corporation in 1998 for a sum reported to have been around A$40 million. However, the sale of Australia&#x27;s last major independent label to a multinational engendered some adverse publicity, with Gudinski controversially claiming that he had sold the label as a protest at the federal government&#x27;s changes to the regulations governing the parallel importation of recordings.

Gudinski maintained control of most other Mushroom Group companies (including interests in music publishing, film production, band booking, national touring and venue management) and the name Mushroom Records. When Mushroom was merged with News Corporation&#x27;s record label Festival Records to form Festival Mushroom Records in 1998, Gudinski relaunched Liberation Music.

In October 2005, Festival Mushroom Records was wound up and its trademarks and assets (including its large archive of master recordings) were sold to the Australian division of the Warner Music Group in a deal reported to be worth around A$10 million.

The company&#x27;s other major asset, Festival Music Publishing, was sold to Gudinski&#x27;s Mushroom Music a month later for an undisclosed sum.

In December 2009, Gudinski announced that he bought the remaining 50% he did not own from Warner Bros. In 2010, it became fully independent again.

In 2021, Gudinski died in Melbourne at the age of 68.

Throughout 2023, the company celebrated their fiftieth anniversary with a yearlong celebration titled, &quot;&quot;.

==A&amp;E Records==
With the reorganisation into Festival Mushroom Records, a number of international operations and joint ventures were either shut down or sold. In the United Kingdom, the British arm of the company (including Infectious and Perfecto Records) was reorganised as A&amp;E Records and sold on to the Warner Music Group when Korda Marshall took a position within that company.
