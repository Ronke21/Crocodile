<text>Sir Kenneth Arthur Dodd (8 November 1927 – 11 March 2018) was an English comedian, singer and occasional actor. He was described as &quot;the last great music hall entertainer&quot; and was primarily known for his live stand-up performances.

A lifelong resident of Knotty Ash in Liverpool, Dodd&#x27;s career as an entertainer started in the mid-1950s. His performances included rapid and incessant delivery of often surreal jokes, and would run for several hours, frequently past midnight. His verbal and physical comedy was supplemented by his red, white, and blue &quot;tickling stick&quot; prop, although these could change for occasions such as St Patricks Day where he would choose a green, white and orange pair, and often introduced by his characteristic upbeat greeting of &quot;How tickled I am!&quot; He interspersed comedy with songs, both serious and humorous, and with his original speciality, ventriloquism. He also had several hit singles primarily as a ballad singer in the 1960s, and occasionally appeared in dramatic roles. He performed on radio and television and popularised the characters of the Diddy Men.
Dodd was knighted in the 2017 New Year Honours for services to entertainment and charity. His stage career lasted for over 60 years, and he continued to perform until the end of 2017; he died on 11 March 2018, aged 90.

==Early life==
Dodd was born on 8 November 1927 in a former farmhouse in Knotty Ash, a suburb of Liverpool, to Arthur Dodd and Sarah (née Gray). He had an older brother, William and a younger sister, June. He went to the Knotty Ash School, and sang in the local church choir of St John&#x27;s Church, Knotty Ash. He was to live in Knotty Ash all his life, dying in the house in which he was born, and often referred to the area—as well as its mythical &quot;jam butty mines&quot; and &quot;black pudding plantations&quot;—in his act. During the Second World War he was evacuated with his school to Shrewsbury, where he attended the Priory Grammar School for Boys. He was also evacuated to the village of Penmachno, near Betws y Coed, where he attended the local village school and learnt Welsh.
He then attended Holt High School, a grammar school in Childwall, Liverpool, but left at the age of 14 to work for his father, a coal merchant. Around this time he became interested in show business after seeing an advert in a comic: &quot;Fool your teachers, amaze your friends—send 6d in stamps and become a ventriloquist!&quot; and sending off for the book. Not long after, his father bought him a ventriloquist&#x27;s dummy and Ken called it Charlie Brown. He started entertaining at the local orphanage, then at various other local community functions. His distinctive buck teeth were the result of a cycling accident after a group of school friends dared him to ride a bicycle with his eyes closed. Aged 18, he began working as a travelling salesman, and used his work van to travel to comedy clubs in the evenings.

==Early career==
Before becoming a full-time professional performer, mostly on stage, his first known appearance on radio was in &quot;Variety Fanfare&quot; (producer: Ronnie Taylor, venue: Hulme Hippodrome) made by the BBC in Manchester in 1950–1952. 

He said he gained his big break at age 26 when, in September 1954, he made his professional show-business debut as Professor Yaffle Chucklebutty, Operatic Tenor and Sausage Knotter at the Nottingham Empire. He later said, &quot;Well at least they didn&#x27;t boo me off&quot;. 

He continued to tour variety theatres up and down the UK, and in 1955 he appeared at Blackpool, where, in the following year, he had a part in &quot;Let&#x27;s Have Fun&quot;. His performance at the Central Pier was part of a comedy revue with Jimmy James and Company. Also on the same bill were Jimmy Clitheroe and Roy Castle. Dodd first gained top billing at Blackpool in 1958.

==Comedy==
Dodd was described as &quot;the last great music hall entertainer&quot;. His stand-up comedy style was fast and relied on the rapid delivery of one-liner jokes. He said that his comic influences included other Liverpool comedians like Arthur Askey, Robb Wilton, Tommy Handley and the &quot;cheeky chappy&quot; from Brighton, Max Miller. 

In a radio interview in 2002 he recalled how he was very happy to meet Max Miller while they were performing on the same radio show recorded live at Hulme Hippodrome (probably, &quot;The Show Goes On&quot;, 1955) saying: “I once had the honour of being on the same bill, on the radio show as Max Miller, ‘the&#x27; Max Miller, the man, the grand-daddy of all comedians, was on that bill and I was on with Max Miller and he was a lovely man. Very happy days, the Hulme Hippodrome.” 

He interspersed the comedy with occasional songs, both serious and humorous, in an incongruously fine light baritone voice, and with his original speciality, ventriloquism. Part of his stage act featured the Diddy Men (&quot;diddy&quot; being Scouse slang for &quot;small&quot;). At first an unseen joke conceived as part of Dodd&#x27;s imagination, they later appeared on stage, usually played by children or puppets.

Dodd worked mainly as a solo comedian, including in a number of eponymous television and radio shows and made fifteen appearances on BBC TV&#x27;s music hall revival show, &quot;The Good Old Days&quot;. Although he enjoyed making people laugh, he was also a serious student of comedy and history, and was interested in Sigmund Freud and Henri Bergson&#x27;s analysis of humour. Occasionally, he appeared in dramatic roles, including Malvolio in William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; on stage in Liverpool in 1971; on television in the cameo role of &#x27;The Tollmaster&#x27; in the 1987 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story &quot;Delta and the Bannermen&quot;; as Yorick (in silent flashback) in Kenneth Branagh&#x27;s film version of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; in 1996; and as Mr. Mouse in the 1999 television movie adaptation of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;. Marking Dodd&#x27;s ninetieth birthday, an appreciation by &quot;Guardian&quot; theatre critic Michael Billington noted that &quot;Ken has done just about everything: annual Blackpool summer seasons, pantomimes, nationwide tours, TV and radio. He was a very fine Malvolio.&quot;
Dodd was renowned for the length of his performances, and during the 1960s he earned a place in &quot;The Guinness Book of Records&quot; for the world&#x27;s longest ever joke-telling session: 1,500 jokes in three-and-a-half hours (7.14 jokes per minute), undertaken at the Royal Court Theatre, Liverpool, where audiences entered the show in shifts.

Dodd appeared in many Royal Variety Performances. The last was in 2006, in front of Prince Charles and his wife Camilla, at the London Coliseum.

Dodd toured frequently throughout his professional career, performing lengthy shows into his eighties, that often did not finish until after midnight. In his final year, he continued to tour the UK extensively, with his comedy, music and variety show. His final performance was on 28 December 2017 at the Echo Arena Auditorium in Liverpool. He said the secret of his success was simply, &quot;I love what I do&quot;.

== Music ==
Dodd had many hit records, charting on 18 occasions in the UK Top 40, including his first single &quot;Love Is Like a Violin&quot; (1960), produced on Decca Records by Alex Wharton, which charted at number 8 (UK). His version of Bill Anderson&#x27;s song &quot;Happiness&quot; charted in 1964 and became Dodd&#x27;s signature song.

Dodd&#x27;s recording of &quot;Tears&quot; on the Columbia label topped the UK singles chart for five weeks in 1965, becoming the biggest hit single in Britain that year and selling over a million copies in the UK alone. The recording was the third-highest selling song of the 1960s in Britain; at the time it was the UK&#x27;s biggest selling single by a solo artist, and remains one of the biggest selling singles of all time. Dodd was selected to perform the song on &quot;A Jubilee of Music&quot; on BBC One on 31 December 1976, a celebration of the key pop successes of the Queen&#x27;s first 25 years as Britain&#x27;s monarch.

Dodd had two further UK top ten records: &quot;The River (Le Colline Sono In Fiore)&quot;, written by Renato Angiolini with lyrics by Mort Shuman (number 3, 1965); and &quot;Promises&quot;, written by Norman Newell and Tom Springfield (number 6, 1966). As well as his successful chart career as a ballad singer, Dodd occasionally released comedy novelty records, including the 1965 EP &quot;Doddy and the Diddy Men&quot;, featuring the song &quot;Where&#x27;s Me Shirt?&quot; which Dodd co-wrote.

In the 1960s, his fame in the UK was such that he rivalled the Beatles as a household name, and his records have sold millions worldwide.

In 2021, Ken Dodd&#x27;s recording of &quot;Love is Like a Violin&quot; was featured in the Walt Disney film &quot;Cruella&quot;.

==Tax evasion court case==
In 1989, Dodd was charged with tax evasion. The ensuing trial, with the prosecution case led by Brian Leveson QC, produced several revelations. The Diddy Men, who had appeared in his stage act, were often played by local children from stage schools and were revealed never to have been paid. Dodd was also revealed to have very little money in his bank account, having £336,000 in cash () stashed in suitcases in his attic. When asked by the judge, &quot;What does £100,000 in a suitcase feel like?&quot;, Dodd replied, &quot;The notes are very light, M&#x27;Lord.&quot; 

He also said: &quot;I am not mean, but I am nervous of money, nervous of having it, nervous of not having it&quot; and described money as &quot;important only because I have nothing else&quot;.

Dodd was represented by George Carman QC, who in court quipped, &quot;Some accountants are comedians, but comedians are never accountants&quot;. He described Dodd as &quot;a fantasist stamped with lifelong eccentricities.&quot; The trial lasted three weeks; Dodd was acquitted.

Despite the strain of the trial, Dodd immediately capitalised on his new-found notoriety with a successful season running from Easter to Christmas 1990 at the London Palladium. It was there he had previously broken the house record for the longest comedy season at the theatre, in 1965, with a residency lasting 42 weeks. Some of his subsequent material mocked the trial and tax in general. For a while, he introduced his act with the words, &quot;Good evening, my name is Kenneth Arthur Dodd; singer, photographic playboy, and failed accountant!&quot; Dodd also made a joke that when income tax was introduced it was a mere 2p in every £1 earned, followed by the punchline &quot;I thought it still was!&quot;

==Honours==

He was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1982 New Year Honours for services to show business and charity and was knighted in the 2017 New Year Honours for services to entertainment and charity. The award was formally conferred by Prince William, Duke of Cambridge in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace on 2 March 2017.

In 1993 Dodd won Top Variety Entertainer and was also awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award at ITV&#x27;s British Comedy Awards. In 1994, Dodd appeared in the TV special &quot;An Audience with Ken Dodd&quot;. The show was a success and introduced him to a younger audience. Dodd later became one of a select few to be given a second show, entitled &quot;Another Audience with Ken Dodd&quot; and originally broadcast in 2002.

He was made a Freeman of the City of Liverpool in 2001.

In a 2005 poll of comedians and comedy insiders to find the &#x27;Comedians&#x27; Comedian&#x27;, Dodd was voted amongst the &#x27;Top 50 Comedy Acts Ever&#x27;, ranked as number 36. He was made an honorary fellow of Liverpool John Moores University in 1997. A statue depicting Dodd with his trademark &quot;Tickling Stick&quot; was unveiled in Liverpool Lime Street railway station in June 2009. It was temporarily removed in 2017 for renovation works.

Dodd was inducted into the exclusive show business fraternity, the Grand Order of Water Rats.

Dodd was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Letters from the University of Chester at a graduation ceremony in 2009 in Chester Cathedral. He was awarded a Doctorate of Letters at Liverpool Hope University in 2010 during the university&#x27;s Foundation Day celebrations.

In 2016, Dodd was awarded the Aardman Slapstick Comedy Legend Award, a recognition of his lifetime&#x27;s contribution to the world of comedy. He received the award as part of the Slapstick Festival in Bristol.

==Personal life==
Dodd&#x27;s relationships with women lasted for decades; Dodd&#x27;s biographer Stephen Griffin wrote: &quot;As ever, despite the blossoming romance, there was to be no talk of marriage... he thought that marriage could lead to complacency in a relationship, and caused some couples to stop putting in any effort.&quot; In 1955, Dodd began a 22-year relationship with Anita Boutin; they were engaged at the time of her death from a brain tumour in 1977, at the age of 45. Shortly after her death, Dodd began a relationship with Anne Jones, which lasted from 1978 until his death. They had first met in 1961 when Jones appeared in &quot;The Ken Dodd Christmas Show&quot; at the Manchester Opera House. Dodd married Jones on 9 March 2018, two days before his death.

Dodd was a supporter of the Conservative Party and campaigned for Margaret Thatcher in the 1979 general election. In the last rally, at Wembley Arena, he introduced her onto the stage.

Dodd said that one of his biggest regrets in life was that he never had children. It was widely reported that he and Anne Jones were unable to conceive naturally. During his 1989 trial details of his personal life surfaced in the media, including revelations that he and Anne had undergone several failed rounds of IVF treatment in an attempt to start a family.

In October 2001, a stalker - Ruth Tagg - harassed Dodd and Jones by sending them threatening letters and a dead rat; also appearing on the front row at almost all of his live shows during this time. She also attempted to burn down their house by pushing burning rags through the letterbox causing £11,000 worth of damage to the ground floor. Tagg pleaded guilty to harassment and arson at Preston Crown Court in 2003.

==Death and tributes==

Dodd died aged 90, on 11 March 2018, at his home in Knotty Ash, the same home in which he was born and raised, soon after being hospitalised for six weeks with a chest infection. He had been touring with his stand-up stage show up until the end of 2017. Numerous stars paid tribute, including fellow Liverpudlian Paul McCartney.
At his funeral on 28 March, which was led by the Bishop of Liverpool, Paul Bayes, thousands of fans joined the cortege which passed from his Knotty Ash home to Liverpool Cathedral. The service was attended by actors Ricky Tomlinson, Stephanie Cole and Miriam Margolyes, comedians Jimmy Tarbuck, Stan Boardman, Roy Chubby Brown, and Jimmy Cricket, and television executive Michael Grade. After the service, Dodd was laid to rest - alongside both his parents - in a private burial service at Allerton Cemetery in Liverpool. Tickling sticks were placed on various statues around Liverpool in commemoration. At Liverpool Town Hall, St George&#x27;s Hall, the Cunard Building and Liverpool Central Library, flags were lowered to pay respect.

Theatre critic Michael Coveney declared in his appreciation for &quot;The Stage&quot;: &quot;Ken Dodd was the greatest live performer I ever saw on stage anywhere.&quot;

In the December 2018 BBC TV retrospective, &quot;How Tickled We Were&quot;, the comic&#x27;s biographer Michael Billington ranked Dodd alongside Lord Olivier as one of &quot;the two theatrical geniuses of the British stage&quot; in the writer&#x27;s own lifetime. In the same broadcast, fellow Liverpudlian and comedian Jimmy Tarbuck declared Dodd &quot;the greatest stage comic the country has ever seen&quot;.

In October 2020, Dodd&#x27;s headstone was vandalised with graffiti.

In September 2022, Lady Dodd endowed stained-glass windows at St Anne&#x27;s Church, Old Swan, in memory of her husband.

<doc id="151546" wikidata="Q2519129" url="?curid=151546" title="Thornhill, Southampton">
<text>Thornhill is a suburb of Southampton, United Kingdom, situated on the eastern border of the city and bounded by three major roads. According to the 2001 census the population was 11,460. Those under age 16 represent 23.4% of the population, 5% more than the city figure of 18.2%; those over age 65 represent 17.4% of the population, again higher than the city average of 14.5%.

==History==
In 1954 the boundaries of Southampton were extended to include Millbrook, Redbridge, Harefield and part of Thornhill. Thornhill was a small estate of private homes, which was massively expanded in the 1960s by the building of council properties. A large proportion of the occupiers of the original houses are retired accounting for the previously mentioned higher than normal numbers. After the introduction of The right to buy scheme in the late 1980s, a considerable number of the council properties were purchased from Southampton City Council. Owner-occupiers represent 43.9% of properties according to the 2001 census compared to 47.5% local council tenure. The remainder are made up of Housing Association and privately rented homes. The main road through the estate is Hinkler Road, which was named in honour of its most famous resident, Bert Hinkler who flew solo from England to Australia in 1928, there is also a pub named after him, The Hinkler, on Hinkler Road.

Recognised as an area of social deprivation, Thornhill was one of 39 areas around the country chosen in 1999 for the New Deal for Communities. This was controlled by a board of 12 local residents and 8 representatives of relevant agencies (police, primary health care, city council, chamber of commerce etc.) and was known as Thornhill Plus You. Almost £50 Million was available to invest in the area over a 10-year period which commenced in 2000. This was spent on a large number of diverse projects.

As part of the redevelopment of Thornhill, during the morning of Tuesday 29 June 2010, a turf-cutting ceremony signalled the start of construction at Eastpoint Centre in Burgoyne Road, Thornhill. The centre, now the Highpoint Centre, provides a hub for business and community alike. It boasts the latest conference facilities across a three-storey 3,770 sq m development. There is also training space, a social club and a cafe.

A succession strategy for the end of the 10-year programme was put in place resulting in the formation of Plus You Limited. The purpose of this was to ensure continued regeneration and benefit for the community of Thornhill.

==Culture and community==
Youth schemes such as the Thornhill Festival, which allowed musicians from the area to showcase their talents, &quot;Impact&quot; youth group and two active youth clubs were all lost soon after the end of the New Deal for Communities era, leaving a lack of activities for the higher than average number of young people in the area.

A shared Community Allotment on Hinkler Road, opposite the Hinkler Pub, is maintained by community members.

==Landmarks==

===Antelope Park===
Antelope Park was a run-down office block and Jewson&#x27;s regional headquarters. It has been redeveloped into a £25m retail and entertainment complex, with Jewsons being relocated to a new building at the rear of the site.

===Prospect Place===
On 22 February 2010, The Hinkler Parade Regeneration Scheme took a step forward with the approval of £15 million project which would see the demolition of seventeen shops – many of which were boarded up – twenty-two flats, and a five-storey block of sixteen flats in Marston Road, and their replacement with 106 new homes – which are a mix of rent, part buy-part rent and full ownership, 5 new shops and a community center. The property developers granted by Southampton City Council were Barratt Homes and First Wessex.

On 22 March 2010, a ceremony took place at 12:30pm which marked the beginning of the Hinkler Parade Regeneration Project. Hinkler Parade was also renamed to Prospect Place.

===Highpoint Centre===
Plus you Limited, the legacy of Thornhill&#x27;s New Deal for Community funding, own and run the Highpoint conference and business centre, continuing to generate income for the community of Thornhill.

==Education==
There are three schools on the Estate: Hightown Primary School, Kane&#x27;s Hill Primary School and Thornhill Primary School.

There is also a special needs primary school called Springwell School designated for pupils with minor learning difficulties including speech and language disorders, autism and challenging behaviour, which opened its doors to students in September 2007, though was not officially opened until March 2008.

==Transport==

Thornhill is currently served by multiple bus services, all operated by Bluestar. The primary routes serving the area are the 18 and 19, the former of which operates between here and Millbrook via Bitterne, and the latter of which operates between here and Lordshill via Woolston. Both routes operate via Southampton Central station and Shirley. The 19 was previously operated by CityRed as the 3, but was taken over by Bluestar following the decision by FirstGroup to withdraw all Southampton based bus services by the 19th of February 2023.

==Religious groups and sites==
There are three churches. One is Thornhill Baptist in Thornhill Park Road. Another is the Circle Community, formerly known as Thornhill Vineyard, who meet twice a month in Kanes Hill School. They left the Vineyard movement in 2024 because of the Vineyard&#x27;s more conservative stance on LGBT, which they disagreed with. Finally there is St. Christopher&#x27;s Parish Church on Hinkler Road. The Parish Church is close to the main shopping area (which includes the all usual social amenities) and is located in the centre of the estate.

==Public spaces==

===Hinkler Green===
The redevelopment of Hinkler Green added space for casual sports to the public park, with a football pitch, a running track, a basketball court, a MUGA, skateboard ramps and outdoor gym equipment. Hinkler Green also offers a children&#x27;s play area, a peaceful garden, mature trees, and space for picnics, and wild plants.

===Dumbleton Copse and Netley Common===
Dumbleton Copse and Netley Common are ideal spaces for a quiet local walk. Although sandwiched between Thornhill and the A27, there is a feeling of being in the countryside. At the right time of year Aberdeen Angus Cows can be seen on the common as part of its management.

===Thornhill Park===
Between Thornhill Park Road and Byron Road, Thornhill park is host to a multitude of mature trees and wildlife, as well as a children&#x27;s play area.

===Antelope Park===
As well as shopping, takeaway food, and a coffee shop, Antelope Park hosts a gym and a trampoline centre.

<text>Desmond Bernard O&#x27;Connor (12 January 1932 – 14 November 2020) was an English comedian, singer and television presenter.

He was a long-time TV chat-show host, beginning with &quot;The Des O&#x27;Connor Show&quot; in 1963, which ran for ten years as well as the lunchtime chat show &quot;Today with Des and Mel&quot; from 2002 to 2006 with Melanie Sykes. He also presented several UK television game shows, including &quot;Take Your Pick!&quot; from 1992 to 1999, and the long-running Channel 4 game show &quot;Countdown&quot; for two years between 2007 and 2008.

O&#x27;Connor recorded 36 albums and had four top-ten UK singles, including a number-one hit with &quot;I Pretend&quot;, with global sales of more than sixteen million records. Well known for his friendship with comedians Morecambe and Wise, his singing ability was often light-heartedly mocked on their show, with O&#x27;Connor taking part in the sketches.

==Early life==
Desmond Bernard O&#x27;Connor was born on 12 January 1932 in Stepney, East London, to Maude (&quot;née&quot; Bassett), a cleaner, and Harry O&#x27;Connor, a dustman. His father was of Irish Catholic descent and his mother was Jewish, and he joked that he was the first O&#x27;Connor to have a bar mitzvah.

In his childhood, he had rickets and was later badly injured in a hit-and-run car accident which meant he had to be in an iron lung for six months. He had a brother and a sister. He was evacuated to Northampton during the Second World War, where he worked in a shoe factory and was a schoolboy and reserves football player with Northampton Town.

After completing his national service in the Royal Air Force, he worked as a Redcoat at Butlin&#x27;s holiday camp in Filey, where he met his first wife Phyllis, and as a shoe salesman at Church&#x27;s in Northampton, and for the bus company United Counties, both on the road and in the office, before entering show business. Prior to his break on television, his first fully professional stage appearance in variety was in a Newcastle theatre. Later, while in Leeds, he invited the Welsh singer Shirley Bassey out on two dates. In 1958, when Buddy Holly toured the UK, O&#x27;Connor was the show&#x27;s compère for which he was paid £100 per week.&lt;br&gt; 

In 1950 and 1952, he collaborated in songwriting with British singer Sam Browne and Australian pianist and composer Ray Hartley. The team produced hit songs &quot;Let&#x27;s Do It Again&quot;, &quot;Start Singing A Song&quot;, &quot;Yes! Yes! Yes! (I Like Good Old Melody)&quot; and &quot;Why Do I Love You?&quot;. O&#x27;Connor and Hartley also created the hit song &quot;My Baby Told Me She Loves Me&quot;.

==Career==
===Stage===
O&#x27;Connor appeared at the Glasgow Empire, MGM Grand, Las Vegas, the Opera House, Sydney, and the O&#x27;Keefe Centre, Toronto, and made more than one thousand solo appearances at the London Palladium.

In late 2011, O&#x27;Connor starred in &quot;Dreamboats and Petticoats&quot; at the Playhouse Theatre.

In May 2012, O&#x27;Connor replaced Russell Grant in the West End musical, &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, at the London Palladium, as Professor Marvel, Doorman at the Emerald City, Tour Guide, and The Wizard.

In October 2015, O&#x27;Connor and Jimmy Tarbuck starred in their own one-off show at the London Palladium to raise money for the new Royal Variety Charity. Due to the success of this show, they toured the country in 2016 from April to October. The venues they visited were (in chronological order), the Southampton Mayflower Theatre, Leeds Grand Theatre, Southend Cliffs Pavilion, Bristol Hippodrome, Bournemouth International Centre, and Milton Keynes Theatre.

In 2017, O&#x27;Connor and Tarbuck toured the UK again from May to December. The venues they visited included Theatre Royal, Norwich, Wolverhampton Grand Theatre, Blackpool Opera House, Princess Theatre, Torquay, The Hexagon, Reading, Theatre Royal, Newcastle and Grand Theatre, Swansea.

Until 2019, O&#x27;Connor toured theatres around the UK with his one-man show.

===Television===
O&#x27;Connor starred in mainstream television shows in almost every year from 1963 until the 2000s, a feat that only one other television personality has achieved worldwide (U.S. game show host Bob Barker, who hosted mainstream television shows from 1956 until 2007, with 1966–1972 being in syndication).
* Between 1963 and 1971 O&#x27;Connor hosted &quot;The Des O&#x27;Connor Show&quot;, a British variety show, for eight series on ITV. This was followed by &quot;Des O&#x27;Connor Entertains&quot;, a show which ran for two series between 1974 and 1976 and featured singing, dancing, and comedy sketches. In 1969, thirteen editions of the show were sold to NBC in the United States, as a summer replacement for the network&#x27;s &quot;Kraft Music Hall&quot;. The series was broadcast in more than forty countries.
* Between 1977 and 2002, O&#x27;Connor presented his own chat show series entitled &quot;Des O&#x27;Connor Tonight&quot; which lasted for seven series on BBC Two and later seventeen on ITV.
* From 1992 to 1998 O&#x27;Connor presented the game show &quot;Take Your Pick!&quot; where he met fourth wife Jodie Wilson. In 1995 and 1997 O&#x27;Connor compèred the Royal Variety Performance.
* In January 2001 ITV aired &quot;An Audience with Des O&#x27;Connor&quot;.
* From 2002 to 2006 O&#x27;Connor co-hosted &quot;Today with Des and Mel&quot; opposite Melanie Sykes. The show was a lunchtime light entertainment programme aired on ITV. On 12 May 2006, the channel announced that the show would be one of a number to be axed in a &quot;painful, but utterly necessary&quot; move.
* In January 2007, O&#x27;Connor replaced Des Lynam as co-presenter of the Channel 4 game show &quot;Countdown&quot; with Carol Vorderman. He left the show in 2008 to spend more time on theatre and entertainment-based projects. In 2009, O&#x27;Connor was replaced by sports presenter Jeff Stelling.
* In April 2012, ITV aired &quot;The One and Only Des O&#x27;Connor&quot;, a one-off show that celebrated O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s 80th birthday, with guests including Katherine Kelly, Olly Murs, Robert Lindsay, and Melanie Sykes.

====Guest appearances====
* O&#x27;Connor appeared as a guest on &quot;The Morecambe and Wise Show&quot; a number of times. He was the butt of many a joke by Eric Morecambe, being referred to as &quot;Des – short for &#x27;desperate&quot;, and &quot;Death O&#x27;Connor&quot;. One line, sung to the tune of &quot;Crazy Words – Crazy Tune&quot; was, &quot;Roses are red, violets are blue, Des can&#x27;t sing, we know that&#x27;s true!&quot;. (O&#x27;Connor was actually an old friend of the duo, and even participated in writing many of the &quot;put-downs&quot;.)
* In May 2012, O&#x27;Connor took part in the TV game show &quot;Would I Lie to You?&quot;.
* In December 2012, O&#x27;Connor was invited to celebrate 100 years of the Royal Variety Performance with Bruce Forsyth, Ronnie Corbett, and Jimmy Tarbuck.
* In December 2012, O&#x27;Connor partnered Lee Mack in a celebrity edition of &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot;.
* In December 2013, O&#x27;Connor appeared in a celebrity edition of &quot;The Chase&quot;.
* In October 2014, O&#x27;Connor was a panellist on an episode of &quot;Through the Keyhole&quot;.
* In April 2017, O&#x27;Connor was on the panel of &quot;Harry Hill&#x27;s Alien Fun Capsule&quot;.

===Singing===
O&#x27;Connor had a successful career as a singer, recording 36 albums, five of which reached the top 40 of the UK Albums Chart. O&#x27;Connor appeared with Morecambe and Wise on several of their Christmas shows. He worked with many pop stars, including Adam Faith, Shirley Bassey, Barbra Streisand and Cilla Black. He toured with Buddy Holly (during Holly&#x27;s 1958 stay in the UK) and Jason Donovan.

He recorded four top 10 singles, including &quot;I Pretend&quot;, which topped the UK Singles Chart in 1968, and &quot;The Skye Boat Song&quot;, a 1986 duet with Roger Whittaker.

His singing ability was often parodied on &quot;The Morecambe &amp; Wise Show&quot;, with O&#x27;Connor taking part in the sketches.

==Awards and honours==

O&#x27;Connor was the first subject of the second incarnation of the long-running television programme &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;, when the show returned to screens after a five-year absence, produced by Thames Television. He was surprised live on the stage of the London Palladium by Eamonn Andrews in November 1969.

In 2001, O&#x27;Connor was presented with the Special Recognition Award at the National Television Awards for his contribution to television.

In 2002, his autobiography, &quot;Bananas Can&#x27;t Fly!&quot;, was published.

He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2008 Birthday Honours.

A month after his death, ITV aired a tribute, titled &quot;Des O&#x27;Connor: The Ultimate Entertainer&quot;, on 13 December 2020.

==Personal life==
O&#x27;Connor was married four times:
* Phyllis Gill (married 1953, divorced 1959; one daughter)
* Gillian Vaughan (married 1962, divorced 1982; two daughters)
* Jay Rufer (married 1985, divorced 1990, one daughter)
* Jodie Brooke Wilson (married September 2007; one son)

==Death==
On 14 November 2020, O&#x27;Connor died in his sleep at Wexham Park Hospital in Slough, aged 88, following a fall at his home in Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire, a week earlier. In a January 2021 interview, his widow Jodie revealed that in 2017, he had been diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease, although he thought that he had suffered from effects of it for a few years previously. The episode of &quot;Countdown&quot; broadcast on 16 November 2020 was dedicated to his memory.

<text>Thornhill (; meaning &quot;draen&quot; thorn + &quot;-en&quot; one + &quot;pen&quot; top + &#x27;y&#x27; the + &quot;craig&quot; rock [mutated to &#x27;graig&#x27;]) is a community in the north of the city of Cardiff, Wales. It lies south of Caerphilly.

==Description==

It is a relatively modern area with housing stock dating mainly from the late 1980s and beyond. The area has a centralised precinct providing services, comprising a community centre (Thornhill Church Centre), a Sainsbury&#x27;s supermarket, with an integral Post Office and Pharmacy; and the North Cardiff Medical Centre.

There are three public houses located in Thornhill: the Old Cottage, Pendragon, and the Ffynnon Wen. Though on Thornhill Road, The Traveller&#x27;s Rest to the north is on Caerphilly Mountain and in Caerphilly based on its postcode and council locale.

Thornhill Cemetery is a major cemetery located adjacent to Thornhill, in Rhiwbina. Thornhill crematorium was built on this site during the 1950s as a dedicated crematorium. This differs from the crematorium that was set up in nearby Glyntaff; this in contrast was a chapel that was originally used for traditional burials and modified to serve as a crematorium.

Most of Thornhill&#x27;s residential development took place during the 1990s. Cardiff Council originally planned Thornhill as &quot;The Villages of Thornhill&quot;; with clusters of houses interspersed by large &quot;green&quot; areas. These green areas were short lived as rapid housing development resulted in homes being built in areas adjoining the &quot;Villages&quot;.

Thornhill also houses a few tucked away historical sites including the remains of a castle situated close to the Caerphilly/Thornhill border known as Castell Morgraig.

==Transport==

Thornhill is served by Lisvane and Thornhill railway station which replaced Cefn Onn Halt railway station which closed in 1986.

Thornhill is served by bus services operated by Cardiff Bus. The 27 and 28 service runs through Thornhill and terminates at the Central Bus Station at regular intervals. Adventure Travel operates its C8 services, running from Taff&#x27;s Well to Cardiff Bay, via Thornhill and Cardiff city centre. Stagecoach service 25 follows a route along Thornhill road on its way to the University Hospital of Wales and Cardiff City Centre. This service replaced the A and B services in 2017. Stagecoach Wales have operated the 86 service since 1 April 2019 after Cardiff Bus withdrew from the route. Cardiff Council tendered for a new operator for two years after designating the 86 service as one of several new &#x27;socially necessary&#x27; routes in Cardiff.

The M4 motorway passes Thornhill between junctions 30 and 32 (but there is no Junction 31).

==Education==
The area is served by Thornhill Primary School. The nearest secondary school is Llanishen High School. Welsh medium education is provided most locally at Ysgol Y Wern in nearby Llanishen and Ysgol Gyfun Gymraeg Glantaf in Llandaf North.

==Government==
Thornhill falls into the Llanishen Ward on the City of Cardiff Council. In 2016 Thornhill became one of four new communities in Cardiff, having previously been part of the Llanishen community. There is no community council for the area.

==Notable people==
* Axel Rudakubana, murder suspect in the 2024 Southport stabbings, born and raised in Thornhill.

<text>Walton is a village and civil parish in the City of Wakefield in the county of West Yorkshire, England, 4 miles south-east of Wakefield. At the time of the 2011 Census, the parish had a population of 3,231. At the time of the 2011 Census the parish was part of the City of Wakefield&#x27;s ward of Crofton, Ryhill and Walton. The population of this ward at the Census was 15,144.

Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, the village lies on the Barnsley Canal and is home to Walton Hall, once the residence of Charles Waterton, known as &#x27;Squire&#x27; Waterton. He was a naturalist and explorer who, in 1820, transformed the grounds of the Walton Hall estate the world&#x27;s first nature reserve. The estate is also often referred to on Ordnance Survey maps, etc., as Walton Park and, less frequently, as Walton Hall Park. More recently, it has become widely known as Waterton Park.

Walton Hall is now Waterton Park Hotel. The park is now largely given over to a golf course, also named Waterton Park. There are public rights of way crossing the park.

Nearby, the site of the now demolished Walton Colliery, formerly known as Sharlston West colliery, has been transformed into a nature park (Walton Colliery Nature Park). Large lakes were constructed when the reserve was landscaped in the mid-1990s and the excavated earth was then used to cover the colliery&#x27;s vast spoil heaps. The village also contains a small park, a tennis club, football and rugby pitches, a newly renovated pub and a sports and social club.

==Name==
The village was recorded in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; () as &quot;Waleton&quot;, but from , it was known as &quot;Weala-tun&quot;, a name which means &#x27;Welshman&#x27;s Village&#x27;. This suggests a settlement of native British people was established well before the Saxons arrived during the 7th century. During the Norman dynasty, the village was recorded as &quot;Waton&quot;, but since the Middle Ages () to the present day, the village has held its current name of &quot;Walton&quot;.

==Schools==
The first village school was established in the village in 1722 when two large cottages on Shay Lane were donated by Charles Waterton (grandfather of the aforementioned Squire Charles Waterton). One of the two cottages was a small schoolroom and the other was let to the newly appointed schoolmaster free of charge, providing the two poor children of the village were educated for free.

In 1790, money from the will of wealthy woman called Catherine Neville of Chevet, Wakefield was donated. These funds were used to establish a new, free school in Walton which operated alongside a few other smaller schools in the area.

In 1857 Miss. Mary Pilkington of Chevet Hall, Sandal, financed the construction of a new school, a schoolmasters house and a laundry school on School Lane. This school continued its existence until 1911, gradually taking on more pupils from the other village schools until they were deemed redundant and closed.
It was closed and demolished in 1911, but replaced shortly after by another new school building for children aged 3 to 11.

As the village population grew, the new school was soon over capacity and a solution was needed. To combat this problem, a new infant school was built on The Grove, taking on all the pupils aged 3 to 8, with the pupils aged 8 to 11 remaining at the original building.

The original school closed in 2007 and the infant school was demolished when a new replacement was constructed in its place. It caters to the pupils of both the old infant school and the original school, as well as containing the new village library. The original 1911 school was finally demolished in 2009. In 2019, eight dwellings were erected on the site.

==Churches==
Since the 19th century, there have been two places of worship for the village community.
In the 1800s, the Methodist community were worshipping in a building on the Balk and in 1856 they built an additional small chapel on Shay Lane. When opened, St. Paul&#x27;s Church on the Balk was dedicated to the Bishop of Wakefield, its construction was financed by the Simpson family, who also provided the land. The village is in the Church of England Parish of Sandal Magna.

In 1896, with the village population on the increase, larger premises were needed for the Methodist congregation and a bigger chapel was built. The design incorporated the original building and in 1910, extra Sunday school rooms were added.

==Colliery==
Walton Colliery was the site of an explosion on 22 April 1959 that killed five men.

The pit closed on 3 December 1979, leading to the loss of 550 locally. This was planned to be one of the first en-bloc transfers of miners from an exhausted colliery to the new Selby Coalfield, but only around half of the workforce (excluding those that chose redundancy) moved to the Selby Coalfield. The remaining miners transferred to similar work at Ackton Hall, Allerton Bywater and Nostell Collieries immediately, and often later to Selby when those pits closed.

Before closure, Walton Colliery had been saved several times by industrial action. In 1977 it was reported to require investment of £5 million to open new faces, which was rejected by the Coal Board, but Arthur Scargill refused to accept the closure of a pit where the coal was not yet exhausted.

==War memorial==
At the centre of the village, at the junction of School Lane (B6378) and Shay Lane, a war memorial lists the names of local men who died serving in the First and Second World Wars.

<text>Roderick Keith Ogilvy &quot;Rory&quot; Bremner, (born 6 April 1961) is a Scottish impressionist and comedian, noted for his work in political satire and impressions of British public figures. He is best known for co-starring with John Bird and John Fortune in the comedy sketch shows &quot;Rory Bremner...Who Else?&quot; and &quot;Bremner, Bird and Fortune&quot;, as well as being a team captain on the first two series of comedy panel show &quot;Mock the Week&quot;.

==Early life==
Bremner was born in Edinburgh, the son of Major Donald Stuart Ogilvy Bremner (1907–1979) and his second wife Ann Simpson (1922–2001). He has an older brother and an older half-sister (from his father&#x27;s first marriage). Bremner was educated at Clifton Hall School and Wellington College, and then studied Modern Languages at King&#x27;s College London, graduating with a degree in French and German in 1984.

In 2009, Bremner was the subject of the series &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot; in a quest to research about his father, whom he barely knew. His father had served in the 1st Battalion, East Lancashire Regiment during the Second World War and was often away from home. Bremner travelled to &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch, the Dutch city liberated by the East Lancs, amongst other places to retrace his father&#x27;s footsteps. Together with his brother, they traced their father&#x27;s ancestry and discovered that their great-grandfather John Ogilvy had served as a &quot;surgeon general&quot; (equivalent of the present-day senior Royal Army Medical Corps medical officer) during the Crimean War and was later posted to British colonies.

==Career==
While studying at King&#x27;s College London, he worked on the cabaret circuit in the evenings and was also active in a student drama club. He first came into the limelight in 1985, when his single, &quot;N-N-Nineteen Not Out&quot; (released under the name of the Commentators) became a hit in the British charts. It was a parody of Paul Hardcastle&#x27;s number one hit, &quot;19&quot;, with Bremner impersonating cricket commentators, including Richie Benaud, John Arlott, and Brian Johnston, and replacing references to the Vietnam War with references to the England cricket team&#x27;s disastrous 1984 home series against the West Indies, in which the England captain David Gower had averaged 19. An uncredited Hardcastle himself played all the instruments.

Bremner contributed to &quot;And There&#x27;s More&quot;, &quot;Spitting Image&quot;, and &quot;Week Ending&quot;, and by 1987 he had his own BBC 2 sketch show, &quot;Now – Something Else&quot;. In 1993 he moved to Channel 4, teaming up with comedy veterans John Bird and John Fortune for &quot;Rory Bremner...Who Else?&quot; where his output became more satirical and the sporting commentators gradually came to represent a smaller proportion of his repertoire. In 1999 the show changed its name to &quot;Bremner, Bird and Fortune&quot;. Over the years the show won numerous awards. Bremner became well known for his impersonations of Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and various other government figures. &quot;Bremner, Bird and Fortune&quot; ended in 2010.

During the 1990s Bremner was also a semi-regular performer on the Channel 4 improvisational comedy show &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot;. In 2005 and 2006 he was a team captain for the first two series of the BBC Two satirical comedy panel show &quot;Mock the Week&quot;.

Bremner has performed on &quot;Sunday AM&quot;, impersonating politicians, with a review of recent political events. He has also presented a BBC Radio 4 series, &quot;Rory Bremner&#x27;s International Satirists&quot;, in which he talks to comedians and impressionists from other European countries. In September 2009, he presented a BBC Four documentary, &quot;Rory Bremner and the Fighting Scots&quot;, about the history of Scots serving in the British Army. In the run-up to the 2010 UK General Election, he performed a 20-date &quot;Election Battlebus Tour&quot;, his first stand-up comedy tour in five years.

Bremner has translated three operas into English: &quot;Der Silbersee&quot; by Kurt Weill, &quot;Carmen&quot; by Georges Bizet, and &quot;Orpheus in the Underworld&quot; by Jacques Offenbach. In April 2007, he took part in &quot;The Big Brecht Fest&quot; at the Young Vic Theatre in London celebrating the work of German dramatist Bertolt Brecht, where a series of newly translated versions of some of Brecht&#x27;s short plays were performed. One of the plays—the short comedy of manners &quot;A Respectable Wedding&quot;—was newly translated by Bremner, who also penned the title to the series. His translation drew a positive reception from critics, although it did draw the ire of some for the removal of any class conflict edge to the play, directed by Joe Hill-Gibbins as a squirming farce that relies heavily on the comic value of embarrassment.

Bremner took part in the 2011 series of &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;. His dance partner in the series was Erin Boag and on 23 October 2011, he was the 3rd celebrity to be eliminated.

In 2012, Bremner appeared on the BBC Four programme, &quot;The Story of Light Entertainment&quot;, in an episode about impressionists.

In January 2013, he began hosting a new Channel 4 quiz show, &quot;Face the Clock&quot;.

In 2013, Bremner presented &quot;Rory Goes to Holyrood&quot;, a one-off show for BBC Scotland that takes a satirical look at Scottish politics and the independence referendum. The programme was announced in March 2013, with plans for it to be aired later in the year. In a BBC press release for the show, Bremner spoke of his reasons for recording the programme. &quot;Coming back to Scotland in the run-up to the Referendum, I realised I knew almost nothing about Scottish Politics. Time I did. And why is there so little political comedy in Scotland outside the Parliament? Time to make sense (and nonsense) of it all.&quot; The programme featured Bremner presenting a one-off stand-up routine at Edinburgh&#x27;s Assembly Hall, airing on 13 June 2013. Bremner subsequently called for there to be more satire in the referendum debate: &quot;There&#x27;s great humour to be had. There&#x27;s a lot of big, different characters involved and good arguments, and there are plenty of good Scottish comedians who can have plenty of fun with it. It&#x27;s far too dangerous to leave it only to the politically minded.&quot;

In 2015, he returned to TV comedy with two political satire programmes on BBC Two: &quot;Rory Bremner&#x27;s Coalition Report&quot;, a satirical summary of the previous five years in British Politics, and the &quot;Election Report&quot;, a satire of the 2015 General Election.

Bremner is patron of the London-based drama school Associated Studios.

From 2016, Bremner has been a team captain on the ITV comedy game show &quot;The Imitation Game&quot;, a panel show hosted by Alexander Armstrong based around impressions.

In late 2016, he featured in the BBC Radio 4 miniseries &quot;Desolation Jests&quot; alongside David Jason, Jan Ravens and John Bird. The four-part show was written by David Renwick.

In September 2024, Bremner appeared live on an ABP Townhall with Captain Simon Bird.

==Recognition==
Bremner was awarded honorary life membership of the King&#x27;s College London Students&#x27; Union in the early 2000s. In 2005 he was made a fellow of his &quot;alma mater&quot;, King&#x27;s College London. Additionally, he was awarded an honorary fellowship by Queen Mary, University of London, in 2008.

Bremner also received an honorary doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in 2011.

He was placed at 49 on ITV&#x27;s list of TV&#x27;s 50 Greatest Stars, and in 2008 received the James Joyce Award of the Literary and Historical Society.

==Political views==
In a 2001 interview, Bremner expressed his disillusionment with the premiership of Tony Blair, despite being initially optimistic about him. He said: &quot;When I first met Tony Blair in 1996, he was open and idealistic, keen to bring a breath of fresh air to government. But something happened – was it just the arrogance of power? – that narrowed Labour&#x27;s vision from purposeful reform and investment, to peevish and petulant pragmatism.&quot; However, he remained an outspoken critic of the Conservative Party, saying: &quot;How dare they look at the railways, the schools, the hospitals, and say the priority is tax cuts?&quot; Bremner supported Reg Keys in the 2005 general election when he stood against Tony Blair as an anti-war candidate.

Bremner opposed Scottish independence in the 2014 referendum, arguing that &quot;social justice, a fairer society and the NHS don’t stop at the border&quot; and that people should &quot;fight for those things within the Union&quot;. He was also one of several celebrities who endorsed the parliamentary candidacy of the Green Party&#x27;s Caroline Lucas at the 2015 general election.

In August 2018, Bremner spoke at a People&#x27;s Vote rally in Edinburgh; People&#x27;s Vote was a campaign group calling for a public vote on the final Brexit deal between the UK and the European Union.

==Personal life==
Bremner&#x27;s first marriage was to Susan Shackleton, a teacher, in 1987; the couple divorced in 1995. On 11 September 1999, Bremner married Tessa Campbell Fraser; they have two daughters. 
Bremner speaks French and German and studied Russian at O-level.

Bremner has been diagnosed with ADHD.

<text>Robert Alan Monkhouse (1 June 1928 – 29 December 2003) was an English comedian, television presenter, writer and actor. He was the host of television game shows including &quot;The Golden Shot&quot;, &quot;Celebrity Squares&quot;, &quot;Family Fortunes&quot; and &quot;Wipeout&quot;.

== Early life and career ==
Monkhouse was born on 1 June 1928 at 168 Bromley Road, Beckenham, Kent, the son of chartered accountant Wilfred Adrian Monkhouse (1894–1957) and Dorothy Muriel Monkhouse (&quot;née&quot; Hansard, 1895–1971). Monkhouse had an elder brother, John, who was born in 1922. Monkhouse&#x27;s grandfather, John Monkhouse (1862–1938), was a prosperous Methodist businessman who co-founded Monk and Glass, which made custard powder and jelly. In a 2015 documentary, it was revealed that Monkhouse and his older brother suffered from physical and verbal abuse by their mother.

Monkhouse was educated at Goring Hall School in Worthing, Sussex, and Dulwich College in south London, from which he was expelled for climbing the clock tower. While still at school, Monkhouse wrote for &quot;The Beano&quot; and &quot;The Dandy&quot; and drew for other comics including &quot;Hotspur&quot;, &quot;Wizard&quot; and &quot;Adventure&quot;. He established a comics writing and art partnership with Dulwich schoolmate Denis Gifford and the two formed their own publishing company, Streamline, in the early 1950s. Among other writing, Monkhouse wrote more than 100 &quot;Harlem Hotspots&quot; erotic novelettes.

Monkhouse completed his National service with the Royal Air Force in 1948. He won a contract with the BBC after his unwitting RAF Group captain signed a letter that Monkhouse had written telling the BBC he was a war hero and that the corporation should give him an audition.

Before establishing himself as a successful writer and comedian, Monkhouse appeared on stage in London, first as Aladdin in a stage show of the same name written by S. J. Perelman and Cole Porter and then in the first London production of the musical &quot;The Boys from Syracuse&quot; (Antipholus of Syracuse) in 1963 at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, alongside Ronnie Corbett.

== Writing and acting success ==
Monkhouse began his adult career as a scriptwriter for radio comedy in partnership with Denis Goodwin, a fellow Old Alleynian with whom he also compèred &quot;Smash Hits&quot; on Radio Luxembourg. Aside from performing as a double act, Monkhouse and Goodwin wrote for comedians such as Arthur Askey, Jimmy Edwards, Ted Ray and Max Miller. In addition, they were gag writers for American comedians including Bob Hope, supplying jokes for British tours. Indeed, when Goodwin broke up the partnership in 1962, it was to work for Hope.

In 1956, Monkhouse was the host of &quot;Do You Trust Your Wife?&quot;, the British version of an American game show. He went on to host more than 30 quiz shows on British television. His public profile growing, Monkhouse also began appearing in comedy films, including the first of the Carry On film series, &quot;Carry On Sergeant&quot;, in 1958. He starred in &quot;Dentist in the Chair&quot; (1960) and &quot;Dentist on the Job&quot; (1961), later regretting not choosing the &quot;Carry On&quot;s over the dental comedies. Other presenting jobs in the 1960s included &quot;Candid Camera&quot; and &quot;Sunday Night at the London Palladium&quot;.

Around 1969 he was a partner, with Malcolm Mitchell, in the Mitchell Monkhouse Agency. In the early 1970s he appeared on BBC Radio in &quot;Mostly Monkhouse&quot; with Josephine Tewson and David Jason. In 1979 he starred in US sketch comedy television series &quot;Bonkers!&quot; with the Hudson Brothers and Joan Rivers, a job he disliked.

== Stand-up comedy ==
Monkhouse was a respected stand-up comedian, known for his talent at ad-libbing. He became much in demand as an after-dinner speaker and wrote a book about the subject, &quot;Just Say a Few Words&quot; (Lennard Publishing, 1988, 1999).

He also became a favourite with impressionists, and, as his comedy style fell out of favour in the 1980s, he was mocked for his slickness and accused of insincerity. He came back into fashion during the 1990s, and an appearance on &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; helped to restore his popularity.

Monkhouse&#x27;s final stand-up show was performed at the Albany Comedy Club in London on 25 August 2003, four months before his death. The show was broadcast by the BBC in 2016 and again in November 2019, April 2020 and December 2023 to mark the twentieth anniversary of his death. Among the audience were a number of British comedians who had been personally invited by Monkhouse, including Reece Shearsmith, Jon Culshaw, David Walliams, Fiona Allen and Mark Steel. The show also included a rare public appearance from Monkhouse&#x27;s friend Mike Yarwood.

== Game shows ==
In his later years, Monkhouse was probably better known for hosting television quiz shows than for being a comedian. One of his biggest successes was &quot;The Golden Shot&quot; from July 1967 until January 1972 and again from July 1974 to April 1975. This was broadcast live for 52 weeks a year and drew up to 17 million viewers. His first tenure ended with allegations, which he denied, that he had taken bribes to include branded goods on the programme as advertisements. He returned in 1974 after subsequent presenters and comedians Norman Vaughan and Charlie Williams were found wanting.

The dozens of other shows Monkhouse presented included &quot;Celebrity Squares&quot;, &quot;Family Fortunes&quot; and &quot;Bob&#x27;s Full House&quot;. Audiences regularly topped 15 million. From 1987 to 1989, he hosted three series of the revival of the talent show &quot;Opportunity Knocks&quot;, which aired as &quot;Bob Says Opportunity Knocks&quot;. He then moved to ITV to front two more game shows, &quot;Bob&#x27;s Your Uncle&quot; and &quot;The $64,000 Question&quot;, neither of which was a popular success.

From 1996 to 1998, Monkhouse presented &quot;The National Lottery Live&quot; show on Saturday evenings on BBC1, for which he created the catchphrase: &quot;I know I&#x27;m a sinner, but make me a winner!&quot; The opening to each show would see him deliver several minutes of topical jokes and on one occasion, where his autocue failed, he improvised a new and topical routine. This talent was used in &quot;Bob Monkhouse On the Spot&quot;, a return to pure television comedy, in which audience members suggested topics and Monkhouse came up with a routine. He was also at the helm when, on 30 November 1996, the lottery machine failed live on air, causing the draw to be delayed by 50 minutes until after that night&#x27;s episode of &quot;Casualty&quot; aired.

Monkhouse then returned to quizzes, taking over hosting duties on &quot;Wipeout&quot; from Paul Daniels when its studio recordings moved from London to Manchester and the show moved from primetime to daytime. Monkhouse hosted &quot;Wipeout&quot; from 1998 until a few months before his death in 2003.

== Chat show ==
After being a stalwart of chat shows, in the mid-1980s Monkhouse presented his own for the BBC, &quot;The Bob Monkhouse Show&quot;. The show lasted three series and showcased comedians of many generations. Monkhouse was criticised for sycophancy towards his guests but said that they were all heroes of his and that was how he felt about them. Monkhouse was a keen supporter of new comedy and used the show to introduce audiences to new comedians such as Kelly Monteith, Robin Williams and Jim Carrey. The format of the interviews varied between &quot;true&quot; chat and analysis of comedy to scripted routines in which Monkhouse would willingly play the role of the guest&#x27;s stooge, as he did with Bob Hope.

On one occasion the guest was the comedian Pamela Stephenson, who, after prior arrangement with the show&#x27;s producer, appeared in a series of fake plaster casts, apparently the result of accidents whilst at home. During the interview she produced a handgun and fired it on several occasions, destroying a plant pot on the set and a series of lights in the studio roof. She then presented a rocket launcher which she promptly &#x27;fired&#x27;, destroying a camera. The gun, launcher and camera were props. None of this was known to Monkhouse, who appeared genuinely frightened (but the production crew were aware).

== Film and television archive ==
An expert on the history of silent cinema and a film collector, Monkhouse presented &quot;Mad Movies&quot; in 1966. He wrote, produced, financed and syndicated the show worldwide. The show featured clips from comic silent films, many from his own private collection, some of which he had helped to recover and restore. This film collection was the cause of a court case at the Old Bailey in 1979. Having lent Terry Wogan&#x27;s son a film, Monkhouse was charged with attempting to defraud film distributors of royalties, but after two years the judge decided that there was no case to answer. Many of the films in his collection were seized and not returned to Monkhouse.

In 2008, the British Film Institute was contacted by Monkhouse&#x27;s daughter, Abigail, who asked if they would like to view the collection and provide some advice as to the best way of preserving it. Amongst the discoveries were many radio and TV shows long thought lost.

Amongst shows rediscovered were many featuring Monkhouse himself, including &quot;The Flip Side&quot;, a 1966 play in which he starred as a television DJ with his own late-night show, and the 1957–58 series of his comedy &quot;My Pal Bob&quot;, including an episode in which he is suspected of an extramarital affair. The archive consisted of 36,000 videotapes, going back to when Monkhouse first bought a home video recorder in 1966. His film archive began in the late 1950s.

The entire Monkhouse film and television archive is now held by Kaleidoscope, including all the material previously held by the National Film and Television Archive (NFTVA). It was catalogued and restored to digital formats for a major event at British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) on 24 October 2009. Chris Perry, of Kaleidoscope and Kaleidoscope Publishing, said: &quot;We are painstakingly transferring the important contents of the video tapes and restoring radio shows. There are many incredible finds, and the event [is] an exciting time for all concerned.&quot;

In his final years, Monkhouse hosted a show on BBC Radio 2 called &quot;The Monkhouse Archive&quot; in which he provided humorous links to clips of comedy acts spanning the previous 50 years.

== Honours, awards and legacy==
In 1993 Monkhouse was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for services to entertainment.

In 1995 the British Comedy Awards gave him its Lifetime Achievement Award for Comedy, and eight years later, a few weeks before he died, the Television and Radio Industries Club awarded him a &quot;Special Award for Outstanding Contribution to Broadcasting&quot;. He first appeared on &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1982 and received a second appearance on the show on 23 April 2003, just months before his death.

In a poll of fellow comedians and comedy insiders to find the Comedians&#x27; Comedian in 2005, Monkhouse was voted among the best 50 comedy acts.

In a piece written several years after Monkhouse&#x27;s death, critic and satirist Michael Deacon suggested that although Monkhouse had feared that his legacy as a comedian would be limited, as many people knew him only from his decades of work as a game-show host, his style of writing and performing could be seen as influencing many contemporary British comedians, such as Jimmy Carr (whose book on comedy &quot;The Naked Jape&quot; quoted several Monkhouse jokes), Michael McIntyre, Peter Kay, John Bishop, Lee Mack and Tim Vine.

== Personal life ==
Monkhouse was married twice, firstly to Elizabeth Thompson on 5 November 1949. The couple separated in 1967 and divorced in 1970. His second marriage, to Jacqueline Harding, lasted until his death. He had three children from his first marriage, but only his adopted daughter survived him.

His eldest son, Gary Alan, who had cerebral palsy, lived at Naish Farm House, a residential home for the disabled in Christchurch Road, New Milton, Hampshire. He went to Saint Michael&#x27;s School in Pinner and died in Braintree, Essex, in 1992, aged 40. Monkhouse was an avid campaigner for the disabled. His other son, Simon, a stand-up poet, from whom he had been estranged for 13 years, died aged 46 from a heroin overdose in a hotel in northern Thailand in April 2001.

Monkhouse lived in a house called &quot;Claridges&quot; in Eggington, near Leighton Buzzard, and had a flat in London and a holiday home in Barbados.

In his autobiography, he admitted to hundreds of sexual liaisons and affairs, but claimed that he only undertook this course of action because his first wife was unfaithful. His lovers before his second marriage included the actress Diana Dors, about whose parties he later commented after her death: &quot;The awkward part about an orgy is that afterwards you&#x27;re not too sure who to thank.&quot;

Throughout his career Monkhouse had jotted down jokes, odd facts, one-liners, sketches and ideas in a series of leather-bound books, which he took with him to every television, radio, stage and nightclub appearance he made. In July 1995 two were stolen, and Monkhouse offered a £15,000 reward. They were returned after 18 months, but the thief, although arrested, was never charged. On Monkhouse&#x27;s death, the books were bequeathed to Colin Edmonds.

Monkhouse was a vocal supporter of the Conservative Party for some years. He later told his friend Colin Edmonds that this may have been a mistake, but that he wanted to be associated with a winner and he knew Margaret Thatcher could not lose the 1987 general election.

==Death==

Monkhouse was diagnosed with prostate cancer in September 2001, and he died from this illness at his home on 29 December 2003 aged 75. His widow, Jacqueline, suffered a heart attack and died in Barbados on 28 March 2008.

== Posthumous advertisement ==
On 12 June 2007, Monkhouse posthumously appeared on British TV in an advertisement promoting awareness of prostate cancer for Male Cancer Awareness Week. Using computer animation techniques and a sound-alike actor, Monkhouse was seen in a graveyard next to his own grave (though in reality he was cremated) talking about the disease seriously, interspersed with humorous asides to another camera (&quot;What killed me kills one man per hour in Britain. That&#x27;s even more than my wife&#x27;s cooking.&quot;). He ended by saying, &quot;As a comedian, I&#x27;ve died many deaths. Prostate cancer, I don&#x27;t recommend. I&#x27;d have paid good money to stay out of here. What&#x27;s it worth to you?&quot; before walking away from his grave and disappearing.

The advertisement was made with the support of Monkhouse&#x27;s estate and supported by poster campaigns, including award-winning panels displayed in London Underground trains. Money raised went to the Prostate Cancer Research Foundation.

<text>Walton Hall is a country house in Walton near Wakefield in West Yorkshire, England. It was built on the site of a former moated medieval hall in the Palladian style in 1767 on an island in a lake. It was the ancestral home of the naturalist and traveller Charles Waterton, who made Walton Hall into the world&#x27;s first wildfowl and nature reserve.

== Early history ==
Walton Hall, and a residence at Cawthorne, were home to the Anglo-Saxon chieftain Ailric, who is mentioned in the Domesday Book and was the King&#x27;s Thane for South Yorkshire. When the Normans came to Yorkshire, Ailric was at Walton and was alerted by a man on horseback that they were coming in force. He amassed his retainers and on horseback they ambushed the mounted Norman knights of Ilbert de Laci, who were moving on the road from Tanshelf to Wakefield. The better armoured and armed knights of Ilbert de Laci resisted the attack. For two to three years Ailric maintained a guerrilla war out of his estates in the west of South Yorkshire, until de Laci was forced to come to an accommodation with him, whereby Ailric would communicate with the local people and de Laci would return many of his former estates, including Walton Hall.

A descendant of this family, Sara le Neville, married Thomas De Burgh, the Steward of the Countess of Brittany, Duchess of Richmond. Walton Hall was one of six manors, including the manors at Silkstone and Cawthorne and the De Burgh manors in North Yorkshire, that she lived at through the year. In 1333, Sir Philip de Burgh was granted a licence to crenellate his manor house at Walton.

The Waterton family acquired the Cawthorne estates and those at Walton including Walton Hall, with the marriage in 1435 of Constance Asshenhull, the heiress of the De Burgh family, to Richard Waterton.

In the time of Sir Robert Waterton, who served Henry VIII, the hall came to the water&#x27;s edge and was three storeys high. Sir Robert Waterton&#x27;s father-in-law was Sir Richard Tempest, who was with Henry VIII at the Field of the Cloth of Gold. His father-in-law was Steward of the King&#x27;s manor of Wakefield and involved in the Tempest–Saville feud. The only part of the old buildings that remain is the old watergate, which is said to be part of an earlier 14th-century structure. At that time it was the only entrance across a drawbridge. The old oak hall referred to by Charles Waterton was on the second storey and was in an L shape.

The entrance hall at Walton Hall has armorial shields on the walls representing the ancestors of the Waterton family. The Waterton family intermarried with other prominent Yorkshire families of the medieval age, including the Percys, the Barnbys, the Wentworths, the Hildyards and others.
== World&#x27;s first nature reserve ==
In 1805, Charles Waterton inherited the family estate at Walton Hall. He initially returned there in 1813 and settled more permanently in 1821 after returning from exploring and managing his uncle&#x27; slave plantations in British Guiana. Unusually for the time he was committed to nature conservation rather than hunting and game shooting for sport, which caused significant loss of native fauna. Between 1821 and 1826, he turned Waterton Park into a wildlife haven, designed to support and protect native and migratory species, especially birds. 

He insisted that the park be managed to minimise the disturbance to native wildlife. Keepers and dogs from nearby estates were banned during nesting season, shooting was forbidden and lake fishing was not allowed from autumn to May. He had a high boundary wall built, over 3 miles long and designed to deter foxes and poachers, that took five years to complete. He enjoyed observing wildlife and had watchtowers built so he could birdwatch. 

He opened the park to the public for free to encourage people to enjoy nature. This included patients from mental asylums whose visits to spend time in nature formed part of their treatments. The parkland is now considered the first wildlife reserve, a landscape designed to protect wildlife.

== Later history ==
Charles Waterton&#x27;s son, Edmund, went bankrupt and sold the estate. The Waterton Collection is in Wakefield Museum.

Walton Hall is now part of the Waterton Park Hotel. In the 1940s and again in the early 1950s and early 1960s the Hall was a maternity home.

Walton Hall is a proposed UNESCO World Heritage Site. Sir David Attenborough has stated that &quot;Walton Hall is an extremely important site in the history of nature conservation worldwide. It is, arguably, the first tract of land anywhere in modern times to be protected, guarded and maintained as a nature reserve.&quot; 

In 2024, Waterton Park, part of the estate, was registered at Grade II by Historic England, to ensure that the landscape considered &quot;the world’s first nature reserve&quot; is given greater protection and recognition.

==Walton Hall sundial==

There is a sundial located on the island to the rear of Walton Hall. It was made by George Boulby in 1813 and is made out of an ashlar with copper gnomons. It is a multi-faceted sundial made out of a polyhedron. It indicates the time in the following cities around the world: Amsterdam, Basel, Boston, Demerara, Madras, Madrid, Mexico City, Moscow, Beijing, Philadelphia, Rome, and Warsaw. It was described by Richard Hobson:
:&quot;On the southern side of the mansion, on a slightly elevated mound, stands a most complete and very beautiful sun-dial, deserving of careful observation, inasmuch as it reflects a great credit on the sculptor, the late George Boulby, who was a common mason at the contiguous and rural village of Crofton, in 1813. A work of art, and, especially when it was well known to have been executed by a totally uneducated man – by a common mason, not only devoid of inculcated literary attainments, but by one having had no guiding artistic instruction – by a man having to earn, &#x27;by the sweat of his brow&#x27;, the few shillings sufficient to enable him to secure some of the works of the philosopher of Athens – by one having to entirely depend upon self counsel so as to elevate him in his financial and social position. I venture to say, considering all these formidable disadvantages and impediments, that this specimen of sculpture is a wonderful development of innate talent, and must be admired and applauded, for generations in futurity, as a relic of the excellence of the scientific execution of the common stone mason.

:&quot;This dial is composed of twenty equilateral triangles, which are so disposed as to form a similar number of individual dials, ten of which, whenever the sun shines out, and whatever may be its altitude in the heavens, are always in use, and ever faithful time-keepers. On these separate dials are engraven, severally, the names of cities in all parts of the globe, which are placed in accordance with their different degrees of longitude, by which arrangement, the solar time, at each of the cities recorded on the different dials, can be simultaneously ascertained.

:&quot;On one occasion Mr. Waterton, having to pass Boulby&#x27;s house ... saw this dial in the stonemason&#x27;s yard, for which Boulby asked a mere trifle. The Squire, delighted with the execution and the ingenuity of this simple-minded man, generously presented Boulby with twenty guineas by way of purchase, when the ingenuous and unaffected mason was infinitely more delighted to have the honour of his own artistic skills exhibited at Walton Hall, under the patronage of the Squire, than with the douceur which the sculptor erroneously considered far beyond its value&quot;

<doc id="151569" wikidata="Q849428" url="?curid=151569" title="Toeplitz matrix">
<text>In linear algebra, a Toeplitz matrix or diagonal-constant matrix, named after Otto Toeplitz, is a matrix in which each descending diagonal from left to right is constant. For instance, the following matrix is a Toeplitz matrix:

:formula_1

Any formula_2 matrix formula_3 of the form

:formula_4

is a Toeplitz matrix. If the formula_5 element of formula_3 is denoted formula_7 then we have
:formula_8

A Toeplitz matrix is not necessarily square.

==Solving a Toeplitz system==
A matrix equation of the form

:formula_9

is called a Toeplitz system if formula_3 is a Toeplitz matrix. If formula_3 is an formula_2 Toeplitz matrix, then the system has at most only 
formula_13 unique values, rather than formula_14. We might therefore expect that the solution of a Toeplitz system would be easier, and indeed that is the case.

Toeplitz systems can be solved by algorithms such as the Schur algorithm or the Levinson algorithm in formula_15 time. Variants of the latter have been shown to be weakly stable (i.e. they exhibit numerical stability for well-conditioned linear systems). The algorithms can also be used to find the determinant of a Toeplitz matrix in formula_15 time.

A Toeplitz matrix can also be decomposed (i.e. factored) in formula_15 time. The Bareiss algorithm for an LU decomposition is stable. An LU decomposition gives a quick method for solving a Toeplitz system, and also for computing the determinant.

==Properties==
* An formula_18 Toeplitz matrix may be defined as a matrix formula_3 where formula_20, for constants formula_21. The set of formula_18 Toeplitz matrices is a subspace of the vector space of formula_18 matrices (under matrix addition and scalar multiplication).
* Two Toeplitz matrices may be added in formula_24 time (by storing only one value of each diagonal) and multiplied in formula_15 time.
* Toeplitz matrices are persymmetric. Symmetric Toeplitz matrices are both centrosymmetric and bisymmetric.
* Toeplitz matrices are also closely connected with Fourier series, because the multiplication operator by a trigonometric polynomial, compressed to a finite-dimensional space, can be represented by such a matrix. Similarly, one can represent linear convolution as multiplication by a Toeplitz matrix.
* Toeplitz matrices commute asymptotically. This means they diagonalize in the same basis when the row and column dimension tends to infinity.

* For symmetric Toeplitz matrices, there is the decomposition

::formula_26

:where formula_27 is the lower triangular part of formula_28.

* The inverse of a nonsingular symmetric Toeplitz matrix has the representation

::formula_29

:where formula_30 and formula_31 are lower triangular Toeplitz matrices and formula_31 is a strictly lower triangular matrix.

== Discrete convolution ==
The convolution operation can be constructed as a matrix multiplication, where one of the inputs is converted into a Toeplitz matrix. For example, the convolution of formula_33 and formula_34 can be formulated as:

:formula_35

: formula_36

This approach can be extended to compute autocorrelation, cross-correlation, moving average etc.

==Infinite Toeplitz matrix==

A bi-infinite Toeplitz matrix (i.e. entries indexed by formula_37) formula_3 induces a linear operator on formula_39.

:formula_40

The induced operator is bounded if and only if the coefficients of the Toeplitz matrix formula_3 are the Fourier coefficients of some essentially bounded function formula_42.

In such cases, formula_42 is called the symbol of the Toeplitz matrix formula_3, and the spectral norm of the Toeplitz matrix formula_3 coincides with the formula_46 norm of its symbol. The proof can be found as Theorem 1.1 of Böttcher and Grudsky.

<doc id="151570" wikidata="Q6221952" url="?curid=151570" title="John Bird (actor)">
<text>John Michael Bird (22 November 1936 – 24 December 2022) was an English actor, director, writer and satirist. He performed in the television satire boom of the 1960s, appearing in &quot;That Was the Week That Was&quot;. His television work included many appearances with John Fortune. Bird had an acting career in film, television, theatre and radio for over 55 years. He appeared in films including &quot;Take A Girl Like You&quot; (1970) and &quot;Jabberwocky&quot; (1977) as well as in television shows such as &quot;Joint Account&quot;, &quot;Marmalade Atkins&quot;, &quot;El C.I.D.&quot; and &quot;Chambers&quot;. He and Fortune also starred with Rory Bremner in the sketch show &quot;Bremner, Bird and Fortune&quot; (1993–2010), on Channel 4, which was nominated for BAFTA TV Awards.

==Early life==
John Michael Bird was born in Bulwell, Nottingham, where his father ran a small chemist&#x27;s shop. He lived at 445 Perry Road in New Basford, north of the (current) Nottingham Perry Road Sainsbury&#x27;s.

He failed his 11-plus, but his secondary modern headmaster managed to have him transferred, aged 12, to High Pavement Grammar School. At grammar school, he honed his acting skills in the dramatic society. In late January 1955 at the Co-operative Arts Centre (the former George Street Particular Baptist Church, which is now the Nottingham Arts Theatre in the city centre), he appeared in a school production of &quot;Strife&quot;, by John Galsworthy (known for &quot;The Forsyte Saga&quot;), where he played David Roberts; Geoffrey Braman played Simon Harness and Michael Hurworth played John Anthony. The female parts were played by girls from the Manning School, a girls grammar school, notably Angela Williams and Jacqueline Le Vick. The play was produced by a modern languages teacher, and the same group of people had taken part in a production of Julius Caesar, the year before, where he played Brutus. At the Arts Centre, he appeared in many productions of the Nottingham County Theatre Company.

In 1956 he passed the entrance exam for King’s College, Cambridge; he read English literature and stayed for postgraduate studies with a thesis entitled &quot;European Drama 1888–1914&quot;. At Cambridge in 1958, he jointly wrote a review, deliberately against the style of works by writers such as Julian Slade, who he disliked. He found American politics far more interesting than British politics, in content, but realised that American politics was much more coarser and uncivilised in tone; he thought that British politics, instead, was a lot more disciplined, but possibly too disciplined and straight-laced. He took an interest in anarchy, after reading &quot;The Secret Agent&quot; by Joseph Conrad.

==Acting career==
===1960s and 1970s===
While studying at Cambridge, Bird met fellow King&#x27;s student John Fortune. During the television satire boom of the 1960s, Bird appeared in &quot;That Was the Week That Was&quot; (1962–1963), the title of which he had coined. The stage director Ned Sherrin intended for him to play David Frost&#x27;s role in the series but Bird was committed elsewhere. He also appeared in the television programmes &quot;Not So Much a Programme, More a Way of Life&quot; (1964–1965), and &quot;If It Moves File It&quot; (1970).

Bird acted in straight and comic roles in several television series and in films including &quot;My Father Knew Lloyd George&quot; (1965), &quot;Red and Blue&quot; (1967), &quot;A Dandy in Aspic&quot; (1968), &quot;30 Is a Dangerous Age, Cynthia&quot; (1968), &quot;This, That and the Other&quot; (1969), &quot;Take A Girl Like You&quot; (1970), &quot;The Seven-Per-Cent Solution&quot; (1976) and &quot;Jabberwocky&quot; (1977). Bird also became an active stage director writer and actor, directing &quot;The Naming of Murderers’ Rock&quot; in 1960 at the Royal Court Theatre in London. He toured with the production &quot;One Over The Eight&quot; in 1961 and appeared in &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, directed by Jonathan Miller in 1966. His stage career continued into the 1970s, with his writing of the adaptation of &quot;Council Of Love&quot; in 1970, which was shown at the Criterion Theatre in London, his appearance in &quot;Who’s Who?&quot; in 1972 in Guildford and Southsea and in &quot;Habeas Corpus&quot; by Alan Bennett at the Oxford Playhouse in 1973, as well as at the Lyric Theatre from 1973 to 1974.

During the 1970s, while Idi Amin was at the height of his infamy, Bird starred on the album &quot;The Collected Broadcasts of Idi Amin&quot;, with lyrics based on Alan Coren&#x27;s anti-Amin &quot;Punch&quot; columns. In 1975 the single &quot;Amazin&#x27; Man&quot;, from the album, was released on the Transatlantic label. The record stayed for 12 weeks in the Australian Singles Chart, peaking at number 26. In 1975, Bird took the part of Mr Rembrandt in &quot;The Melting Pot&quot;, a sitcom written by Spike Milligan and Neil Shand. Milligan played Mr. Van Gogh (in brownface) alongside Bird as Mr. Rembrandt, father and son illegal Asian immigrants who are first seen being rowed ashore in England, having been told that the beach is in fact Piccadilly Circus. It was cancelled by the BBC after one episode had been broadcast. In 1979, Bird played an African chieftain in a cinema commercial for Silk Cut cigarettes. He played Raymond, a nervous boy who stuttered, in Dennis Potter&#x27;s play &quot;Blue Remembered Hills&quot; which was also broadcast in 1979.

===1980s===
In 1980 Bird appeared in &quot;The Dangerous Brothers&quot;. From 1981 to 1984, Bird made his mark in the world of children&#x27;s entertainment taking the role of Mr Humphrey Atkins, the roguish father of Marmalade Atkins (played by Charlotte Coleman) for Thames Television. In 1982, Bird performed in the role of the Duke of Albany in the BBC Television Shakespeare production of &quot;King Lear&quot;. In 1984 he played the part of Jack Ormand, a local gang boss, in the tenth episode of the Granada TV series &quot;Travelling Man&quot;. From 1986 to 1988 he starred as Ernest Hemmingway, the university vice chancellor, in the first series of &quot;A Very Peculiar Practice&quot;, working alongside Peter Davison.

Also in 1993, he was the guest star in the &quot;Sooty &amp; Co.&quot; episode &quot;Voice Problems&quot;. From 1996 to 1999, Bird starred as barrister John Fuller-Carp in the BBC radio and television sitcom &quot;Chambers&quot;.

Bird worked with John Fortune and Rory Bremner in the Channel 4 sketch comedy show&quot; Bremner, Bird and Fortune&quot;, which was nominated for BAFTA TV Awards. In the series of sketches with Fortune, &quot;The Long Johns&quot;, one of the two men interviewed the other, with the latter in the guise of a senior figure such as a politician, businessman or government consultant. Invariably the character was named George Parr. In 2012, Bird appeared in the BBC produced TV film &quot;Bert and Dickie&quot;. Bird worked with David Renwick again in 2016 on the BBC Radio 4 comedy show &quot;Desolation Jests&quot;. Bird&#x27;s final television appearance was in an episode of &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot; in 2017.

<text>Charles Waterton (3 June 1782 – 27 May 1865) was an English naturalist, plantation overseer and explorer best known for his pioneering work regarding conservation.

==Family and religion==
Waterton was of a Roman Catholic landed gentry family descended from Reiner de Waterton. The Watertons had remained Catholic after the English Reformation and consequently the vast majority of their estates were confiscated. Charles Waterton himself was a devout and ascetic Catholic, and maintained strong links with the Vatican.

&quot;Squire&quot; Waterton was born at Walton Hall, Wakefield, Yorkshire, to Thomas Waterton and Anne Bedingfield.

He was educated at Stonyhurst College in Lancashire where his interest in exploration and wildlife were already evident. On one occasion Waterton was caught by the school&#x27;s Jesuit Superior scaling the towers at the front of the building; almost at the top, the Superior ordered him to come down the way he had gone up. Waterton records in his autobiography that while he was at the school: By a mutual understanding, I was considered rat-catcher to the establishment, and also fox-taker, foumart-killer, and cross-bow charger at the time when the young rooks were fledged. ... I followed up my calling with great success. The vermin disappeared by the dozen; the books were moderately well-thumbed; and according to my notion of things, all went on perfectly right.

==South America==
In 1804 he travelled to British Guiana to take charge of his uncle&#x27;s slave plantations near Georgetown. In 1812 he started to explore the hinterland of the colony, making four journeys between then and 1824, and reaching Brazil walking barefoot in the rainy season. He described his discoveries in his book &quot;Waterton&#x27;s Wanderings in South America&quot;, which inspired British schoolboys such as Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace. His explorations laid to rest the persistent myth of Raleigh&#x27;s Lake Parime by suggesting that the seasonal flooding of the Rupununi savannah had been misidentified as a lake.

Waterton was a skilled taxidermist and preserved many of the animals he encountered on his expeditions. He employed a unique method of taxidermy, soaking the specimens in what he called &quot;sublimate of mercury&quot;. Unlike many preserved (&quot;stuffed&quot;) animals, his specimens are hollow and lifelike. He also displayed his anarchic sense of humour in some of his taxidermy: one tableau he created (now lost) consisted of reptiles dressed as famous English Protestants and entitled &quot;The English Reformation Zoologically Demonstrated&quot;. Another specimen was the bottom of a howler monkey which he turned into an almost human face and simply labelled &quot;The Nondescript&quot;. This specimen is still on display at the Wakefield Museum, along with other items from Waterton&#x27;s collection.

While he was in British Guiana Waterton taught his skills to one of his uncle&#x27;s slaves, John Edmonstone. Edmonstone, by then freed and practising taxidermy in Edinburgh, in turn taught the teenage Darwin.

Waterton is credited with bringing the anaesthetic agent &quot;wourali&quot; (curare) to Europe.

==Walton Hall==
In the 1820s Waterton returned to Walton Hall and built a nine-foot-high wall around three miles (5 km) of the estate, turning it into the world&#x27;s first wildfowl and nature reserve, making him one of the world&#x27;s first environmentalists. He also invented the bird nesting box. The Waterton Collection, on display at Stonyhurst College until 1966, is now in the Wakefield Museum. Waterton owned a dog who was prominent in the foundation of the modern English Mastiff and may be traced back to in the pedigrees of all living dogs of this breed. Waterton was voted as an honorary member of the Yorkshire Philosophical Society in its founding year of 1822.

On 11 May 1829, at the age of 47, Waterton married 17-year-old Anne Edmonstone, the granddaughter of an Arawak Native. His wife died shortly after giving birth to their son, Edmund, when she was only 18. After her death he slept on the floor with a block of wood for a pillow, &quot;as self-inflicted penance for her soul!&quot;

Waterton was an early opponent of pollution. He fought a long-running court case against the owners of a soap works that had been set up near his estate in 1839, and sent out poisonous chemicals that severely damaged the trees in the park and polluted the lake. He was eventually successful in having the soap works moved.

Waterton died in May 1865, after fracturing his ribs and injuring his liver in a fall on his estate. His coffin was taken from the hall by barge to his chosen resting place, near the spot where the accident happened, in a funeral cortege led by the Bishop of Beverley, and followed at the lakeside by many local people. The grave was between two oak trees, which are no longer there.

==Legacy==
Waterton is chiefly remembered for his association with curare, and for his writings on natural history and conservation. David Attenborough has described him as &quot;one of the first people anywhere to recognise, not only that the natural world was of great importance, but that it needed protection as humanity made more and more demands on it&quot;.

Waterton&#x27;s house, Walton Hall, which may be approached only by a pedestrian bridge to its own island, is now the main building of a hotel. There is a golf course in the vicinity and various public footpaths, some leading to a nature reserve, Anglers Country Park.

Waterton Lakes in Alberta, Canada, now a national park, was named after him by Thomas Blakiston in 1858. A road and school in Wakefield, Yorkshire, are also named after him.

Waterton was a slave owner, although later wrote: &quot;Slavery can never be defended: he whose heart is not of iron can never wish to be able to defend it.&quot;

In 2024, Waterton Park was registered at Grade II by Historic England, to protect the landscape which Waterton designed to protect wildlife and is considered the world&#x27;s first nature reserve.

<text>John Courtney Fortune (born John Courtney Wood; 30 June 1939 – 31 December 2013) was an English actor, writer and satirist, best known for his work with John Bird and Rory Bremner on the television series &quot;Bremner, Bird and Fortune&quot;.

== Early life ==
Fortune was born John Courtney Wood in Bristol on 30 June 1939. He was educated at Bristol Cathedral School and King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he was to meet and form a lasting friendship with John Bird.

== Career ==
Fortune&#x27;s early work included contributions to Peter Cook&#x27;s Establishment Club team in 1962, and as a regular member of the cast of the BBC-TV satire show &quot;Not So Much a Programme, More a Way of Life&quot;, both alongside Eleanor Bron and John Bird. Fortune and Bird also worked together on the TV show &quot;A Series of Birds&quot; in 1967, and Fortune and Bron wrote and performed a series of sketches for TV in &quot;Where Was Spring?&quot; in 1969. In 1971, with John Wells, he published the comic novel &quot;A Melon for Ecstasy&quot;, about a man who consummates his love affair with a tree. He appeared with Peter Sellers in a Barclays Bank television commercial in 1980, shortly before Sellers&#x27; death.

Along with writing several series for the BBC, in 1982 Fortune appeared in an episode of the BBC sitcom &quot;Yes Minister&quot;, as an army officer who brings the minister&#x27;s attention to British-made weapons getting into the hands of terrorists. In 1999, he starred with Warren Mitchell and Ken Campbell in &quot;Art&quot; at Wyndham&#x27;s Theatre in London&#x27;s West End. He also appeared in the films &quot;Take A Girl Like You&quot; (1970), in which he shared a TV debate with John Bird, Kenny Everett&#x27;s horror spoof &quot;Bloodbath at the House of Death&quot; (1984), &quot;England, My England&quot; (1995), &quot;Maybe Baby&quot; (2000), and &quot;Saving Grace&quot; (2000), and had a guest part in the sitcom &quot;Joking Apart.&quot; 

In 1993, Fortune and Bird began co-starring with Rory Bremner in the sketch show &quot;Rory Bremner...Who Else?&quot; on Channel 4. In 1999, the show changed its name to &quot;Bremner, Bird and Fortune&quot; and continued until 2010, receiving several BAFTA nominations along the way.

Fortune&#x27;s other work with John Bird included their series of satirical sketches &quot;The Long Johns&quot;, in which one interviewed the other, the latter being in the guise of a senior figure such as a politician, businessman or government consultant. The sketches earned several BAFTA award nominations, winning the Television Light Entertainment Performance award in 1997. In one episode, they were two of the very first to predict the 2007–2008 financial crisis during an episode of &quot;The South Bank Show&quot; broadcast on 14 October 2007. In Fortune&#x27;s latter years, he featured in the Radio 4 sitcom &quot;Ed Reardon&#x27;s Week&quot;, playing the head of a literary agency and as theatrical agent Mel Simons in a 2008 episode of &quot;New Tricks&quot;.

Fortune died on 31 December 2013, aged 74. His agent Vivienne Clore said he died peacefully, with his wife Emma and dog Grizelle at his bedside.

<text>Mark Clifford Thomas (born 11 April 1963) is an English comedian, best known for the political stunts that he performs on his show, &quot;The Mark Thomas Comedy Product&quot; on Channel 4. Thomas first became known as a guest comic on the BBC Radio 1 comedy show &quot;The Mary Whitehouse Experience&quot; first broadcast in March 1989 . He describes himself as a &quot;libertarian anarchist&quot;.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Mark Thomas was born in South London. His mother was a midwife and his father a self-employed builder (and ex-lay preacher).
Thomas was educated at Macaulay Church of England Primary School, Victoria Rise, Clapham until 1974, where his party trick was to recite the first verses of the four gospels from memory. He then won a scholarship to attend the independent Christ&#x27;s Hospital School, where he attained O-levels and A-levels in English, history, and politics and economics. At school, Thomas was influenced by his drama teacher, Duncan Noel-Paton, and by Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s play &quot;The Caucasian Chalk Circle&quot;, in which the audience&#x27;s sympathies are swayed from one view of a political argument to the other; speaking of this to &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 1999, he said &quot;I was amazed that a play could make you change your mind&quot;. In a 2016 interview, he stated that he became an atheist at the age of 12, and subsequently developed an interest in radical politics during his teenage years, including anarchism, Marxism and Trotskyism. He went on to be awarded a degree in Theatre Arts at Bretton Hall College. During his time at Bretton Hall, he made his debut as a performer, co-writing and performing satirical sketches at Wakefield Labour Club.

===Career===
After graduating, Thomas subsequently embarked on his comedy career, initially supporting himself through working on building sites with his father. Thomas&#x27; early exposure to comedy was through watching and listening to Dave Allen, &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot;, &quot;The Goon Show&quot; and Tony Hancock; his biggest influence was hearing a recording of Alexei Sayle: &quot;It was like someone had kicked the door in – just listening to that tape and thinking that someone could do this stuff&quot;. He also cited the playwright Trevor Griffiths as an early influence, describing him as &quot;an absolute genius&quot;. He went on to write material for Dave Allen.

Prior to his most renowned vehicle, &quot;The Mark Thomas Comedy Product&quot;, Thomas was a frequent guest comic on the BBC Radio 1 show &quot;The Mary Whitehouse Experience&quot;, where he would do a routine about a specific topic of the week and involve studio audience members in the discussions. He would also occasionally play parts in sketches written by the show&#x27;s main performers. He then became the resident stand-up comic on &quot;Saturday Zoo&quot;, a Channel 4 comedy series first screened in 1993 and appeared on an episode of &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;. He co-presented the highly successful Radio 1 comedy talk show &quot;Loose Talk&quot; with Kevin Day, and is a founder member of the London Comedy Store&#x27;s hard hitting &quot;Cutting Edge&quot; show.

His political comedy show, &quot;The Mark Thomas Comedy Product&quot; (later renamed as simply &quot;The Mark Thomas Product&quot;, to reflect its increasing political agenda) on Channel 4 earned him criticism from politicians but was seen by critics as a crucial investigative tool. In one edition, Thomas investigated the practice of avoiding inheritance tax by declaring art, furniture, homes and land available for public viewing. After discovering that Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) Nicholas Soames was claiming tax relief on a &quot;three-tier mahogany buffet with partially reeded slender balustrade upright supports&quot; on this basis, but without making any arrangements for the furniture to be inspected by the public, Thomas invented a &#x27;National Soames Day&#x27; on which hundreds of people made appointments to see the furniture. Soames subsequently decided to pay the tax on the item and Gordon Brown, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, changed the law. In 2015, Thomas told &quot;The Independent&quot;&#x27;s Adam Jacques: &quot;I try to find the good in my enemies. It&#x27;s not unusual to be able to get on with people despite what they are doing being awful. The only person I have met who I considered to be without any redeeming features was [...] Nicholas Soames. [...] He was such a pantomime baddie.&quot;

Leaving Channel 4 was a mutual decision, following a series of disputes over how far the channel would go in its broadcasting, one of which concerned the channel&#x27;s reluctance to support actions concerning corporate accountability and corporate manslaughter laws—a cause he had campaigned for—which coincided with the Queen Mother&#x27;s funeral. He declined to take part in a proposed &quot;Celebrity Guantanamo Bay&quot; &#x27;reality TV&#x27; show.

Thomas has appeared at numerous comedy benefit nights, and is a well established stand-up comedian in the UK. He is the chairman of the Ilısu Dam Campaign, a campaign which was successful in temporarily blocking the development of a large-scale hydroelectric dam in southeast Turkey that campaigners claim will lead to the displacement of up to 78,000 people, mostly Kurds, without adequate compensation or consultation, as well as to environmental and cultural destruction.

Recently, Thomas has been working with War on Want in India and investigating and filming alleged human rights violations in Colombia (by, amongst others, Coca-Cola) where trade unions are targeted by militia allegedly controlled by the government.
He wrote a regular column for the &quot;New Statesman&quot; between 2001 and 2007.

The parliamentary committee which oversees weapons exports, the House of Commons Quadripartite Select committee, commended him for his undercover work, which led to official warning letters being issued to a number of companies.
His work in this area is covered in &quot;As Used on the Famous Nelson Mandela: Underground Adventures in the Arms and Torture Trade&quot;, a book chronicling his experiences undercover, his political activism and his projects designed to find and report loopholes in arms trading laws, which culminated in a controversial un-broadcast &quot;Newsnight&quot; report about the Hinduja brothers.

Whilst promoting this book on his latest tour, Thomas organised mass lone demonstrations, in protest of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005, an act of Parliament that prevents any demonstrations within London&#x27;s Parliament Square zone without prior police approval. The last event attracted over 100 individual protesters at the same time. In 2006, he was added to the Guinness Book of Records for most demonstrations held on one day: 20 individual protests in 20 different locations. Although he actually performed 21 protests the first and last took place at the same location, so it was agreed that only 20 would count towards the record. His record was later beaten in 2010 by the Freman College Amnesty group, who held 23 demonstrations.

In 2008, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Bradford, for services to peace and for his work as a comedian, political activist, presenter and investigative journalist, especially for his effective campaigning on the ethics of the arms trade. The university has a long-standing Department of Peace Studies.

In 2009, Thomas launched the Huddersfield Policy postcard campaign, petitioning the Queen with protests against the prospect of a state funeral for Margaret Thatcher.

For his &#x27;It&#x27;s The Stupid Economy&#x27; UK tour in 2009, Thomas played 55 shows over 14 weeks between March and end July, and encouraged each audience to come up with their own policies (silly or serious) that would somehow make their lives better, forming a &quot;People&#x27;s Manifesto&quot;. Each audience then got to vote on their favourite policy of that evening and the winning suggestion then formed part of his manifesto which he will then campaign for and attempt to actually make at least some of the suggestions become reality.

In April 2010, Thomas was awarded £1200 compensation for a search carried out by police in 2007. He had been unlawfully subject to a stop-and-search without adequate cause, after speaking at an anti-arms rally.

During 2010 Thomas decided to go rambling in the Middle East and walked the entire length of the Israeli Separation Barrier, crossing between the Israeli and the Palestinian side. His touring show entitled &quot;Walking The Wall&quot; (2011) was shortlisted for the Amnesty International Freedom of Expression award and his book &quot;Extreme Rambling&quot; recounted the story.

Thomas revealed in 2013 that he had discovered, through a Data Protection request, that he had been under police surveillance as a result of his investigative journalism for Channel 4 and the &quot;New Statesman&quot; and put on the domestic extremist database. He cautioned other journalists, &quot;I apologise for the boastful tone but the police have monitored public interest investigations in my case since 1999. More importantly if the police are keeping tabs on a lightweight like myself then they are doing the same and more to others. This is more than supposition as I know of other NUJ members on the database.&quot; The following year, Thomas and five journalists and photographers who had also been under surveillance by the London Metropolitan Police Service&#x27;s National Domestic Extremism and Disorder Intelligence Unit (NDEDIU) began legal action against the force. The NDEDIU&#x27;s reports obtained by Thomas described him as a &quot;general rabble rouser and alleged comedian&quot; and stated, &quot;Mark Thomas stops. Has quantity of cress on rear of his cycle.&quot; He told &quot;The Independent&quot;&#x27;s Adam Lusher, &quot;The police&#x27;s powers of observation are to be admired, I did indeed have cress on my bike. [But] Is it really suitable to spend taxpayers&#x27; money observing the movement of cress?&quot;

In January 2020, Thomas returned to the stage with his new show &#x27;Mark Thomas: 50 Things About Us&#x27; where he states little-known facts about the UK with his trademark mix of stand-up, storytelling and research.

* International Service Award for the Global Defence of Human Rights (2004)
* MediActivist Awards (2005)
* Former Guinness World Record Holder for Most Number of Political Demonstrations in 24 Hours

He was also made an honorary Doctor of Letters by the University of Bradford on 3 December 2008, in recognition of his peace campaigning and services to comedy.

==Politics==
As a part of his television series, Thomas stood as an Independent candidate for the safe Labour parliamentary seat of Hemsworth in a 1996 by-election. He came eighth of ten candidates with 122 votes (0.6%) as the election was won by Labour&#x27;s Jon Trickett.

In his 4 March 2002 &quot;New Statesman&quot; column, Thomas placed a bounty on the head of US President George Bush to the value of £4,320 (his total earnings writing for the magazine to that point).

In February 2009 British entertainers David Baddiel, Bill Bailey, Morwenna Banks, Sanjeev Bhaskar, Jo Brand, Russell Brand, Rob Brydon, Jimmy Carr, Jack Dee, Omid Djalili, Sean Lock, Lee Mack, Alexei Sayle, Meera Syal, Mark Thomas said in an open letter printed in The Times newspaper of the Baháʼí leaders to be on trial in Iran: &quot;In reality, their only &quot;crime&quot;, which the current regime finds intolerable, is that they hold a religious belief that is different from the majority... we register our solidarity with all those in Iran who are being persecuted for promoting the best development of society ...(and) with the governments, human rights organisations and people of goodwill throughout the world who have so far raised their voices calling for a fair trial, if not the complete release of the Baháʼí leaders in Iran.&quot; Echoing the comments earlier in the month made by two hundred and sixty seven non-Baháʼí Iranian academics, writers, artists, journalists and activists from 21 countries including Iran who signed an open letter of apology posted to Iranian.com and stating they were &quot;ashamed&quot; and pledging their support in Baháʼís achieving the rights detailed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights for the Baháʼís in Iran. See Persecution of Baháʼís.

Prior to the 2015 UK general election, he was one of several celebrities who endorsed the parliamentary candidacy of the Green Party&#x27;s Caroline Lucas.

In December 2019, along with 42 other leading cultural figures, Thomas signed a letter endorsing the Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s leadership in the 2019 general election. The letter stated that &quot;Labour&#x27;s election manifesto under Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s leadership offers a transformative plan that prioritises the needs of people and the planet over private profit and the vested interests of a few.&quot;

== Collections ==
The University of Kent holds material by Thomas as part of the British Stand-Up Comedy Archive. The collection relates to Thomas&#x27; work as both comedian and activist, and includes audio-visual recordings, props and documents from performances, research material and drafts of publications.

<text>West Bretton is a village and civil parish in the Wakefield, West Yorkshire, England. It lies close to junction 38 of the M1 motorway at Haigh. It has a population of 546, reducing to 459 at the 2011 Census.

There is a school in the village, West Bretton Junior and Infant School, and a church, which is an Anglican-Methodist local ecumenical partnership.

==History==

===Toponymy===
Bretton derives from the Old English &quot;Brettas&quot;, the Britons and &quot;tūn&quot; meaning an enclosure, farmstead, village or estate. The Briton&#x27;s farm or settlement was recorded as &quot;Bretone&quot; in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; of 1086 and &quot;West Bretton&quot; in 1200.

===Manor===
This part of Yorkshire was laid waste in the Harrying of the North after the Norman conquest of England. Most of West Bretton was granted to the de Lacys, lords of the Honour of Pontefract by William I and a small part to the Manor of Wakefield. After the devastation, growth was slow but more land was eventually cultivated to sustain a growing population. A water-powered corn mill was recorded in 13th century and in 1379 there was a smith. The population at this time was approximately 70 people and one family had adopted the surname &quot;de Bretton&quot;. The de Bretton, Dronfield and Wentworth families became pre-eminent and Sir Willian Dronfield held the manor when he died in 1406.

Swein de Bretton granted the right to pasture 200 cattle and sheep on land north of the village to the monks of Byland Abbey. The population suffered the effects of the Black Death in 1350. Richard Wentworth inherited the manor and hall in 1477. His great-grandson, Sir Thomas Wentworth was Henry VIII&#x27;s Knight Marshall and keeper of Sandal Castle. An oak bed from this time, supposedly slept in by the king, is preserved at Temple Newsam. The old hall, on a different site to the present hall, was recorded on Christopher Saxton&#x27;s Yorkshire map of 1577 but its exact location is unknown.
Thomas Wentworth fought with the Royalists in the English Civil War and was captured at the Battle of Naseby and his estates confiscated. His estates were returned and he was knighted in 1660 when the monarchy was restored. Bretton Hall was built by Sir William Wentworth who inherited the estate in 1706. He was a Captain of Horse in the Trained Guards in the Jacobite rising of 1745. He was buried in the park chapel. Sir Thomas Wentworth (1735–1792) transformed the parkland to what it is today. He changed his name to Blackett, his mother&#x27;s name, when he inherited the Blackett fortune. He was unmarried but his illegitimate daughter Diana, wife of Lt Colonel Thomas Beaumont MP for Northumberland inherited the estate.

The Beaumonts&#x27; main residence was Bretton Hall and a considerable amount of money was spent on it during their time there. Their son Thomas Wentworth Beaumont was Liberal MP for seats in Stafford and Northumberland and supporter of the Reform Act 1832. His son Wentworth Blackett Beaumont spent more time in the north east where he owned more than 14,000 acres of land as well as the Bretton estate. He was ennobled as Baron Allendale of Allendale. His son Wentworth Canning Blackett Beaumont was MP for Hexham and a lord-in-waiting to George V. Wentworth Henry Canning Beaumont made Bretton his home. During the Second World War the hall was used by the military and maintenance cost rose leading to its sale to the West Riding County Council in 1947 followed by the estate land ten years later. The National Union of Mineworkers had wanted to turn it into a convalescent home.

===Agriculture===
The West Yorkshire Archaeological Society has documents relating to the three-field system that operated in the village in medieval times. Its fields were enclosed by 1759. Home Farm was built by 1800. Other farms were Town Farm and Manor Farm. Evidence of brewing is the old malt kiln at the farm of the same name.

===Industry===
After the Dissolution of the Monasteries Matthew Wentworth bought &quot;all the myne, and delff of ironstone&quot; around Bentley Grange, the Byland Abbey property. Though the ironstone was exhausted by the mid-1600s, smithies continued to operate fuelled by charcoal. The furnace at Bretton supplied pig iron to Colnebridge, Wortley Top Forge and Kirkstall in 1728. The furnace at Bretton was taken over by the Cockshutts of Wortley and pig iron was produced there in 1806 but the site had closed by 1820. Attempts were made to exploit coal which outcropped in Bretton but were small in scale. A mine was operated by Thomas Wood in 1806, Bretton Colliery managed by Tweedale and Watson paid rent to the estate in 1820s and bell pits, the Gate Royd Pits, (near the motorway service area) operated in 1849, The Jagger Brothers who owned Emley Colliery opened shafts on Malt Kiln Farm between 1856 and 1871.

Where millstone grit outcropped it was quarried, mostly between the 17th and 19th centuries and is the building stone for farmhouses and boundary walls. There was a brickworks producing rustic red bricks from fireclay outcrops near Bower Hill Lane. From 1723 until 1737 William Harrison who had moved from Burslem was making pots in the village.

==Governance==
Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, the chapelry of West Bretton was partly in the parish of Sandal Magna in the wapentake of Agbrigg and Morley and partly in the parish of Silkstone in the wapentake of Staincross. It became part of the Wakefield poor law union in 1837. West Bretton became part of Wakefield Rural District, created in 1894 and abolished 1974, when it became part of the City of Wakefield Metropolitan District Council.

==Geography==
West Bretton covers of hilly land from above sea level. It is at the watershed of the Rivers Dearne and Calder. The River Dearne flows west to east through the landscaped valley in Bretton Park where it is dammed to form two lakes.

The underlying geology is that of the Carboniferous period and comprises 18 coal seams of coal measures and the Tankersley ironstone seam. Millstone grit outcrops were quarried for building stone and dry stone boundary walls.
West Bretton is on the A637 Barnsley to Huddersfield road, south west of the junction with the A636 Wakefield to Denby Dale road and close to the M1 motorway, which passes to the east of the village.

==Education==
Sir Thomas Wentworth (who changed his name to Blackett) built a school sometime after he inherited the estate in 1763. Sir Thomas paid a schoolmaster £20 per year.
It became a national school and was used as a Sunday School. In 1865–1866 it had 65 pupils and when education was made compulsory to the age of 13 in 1881 there were 100. West Bretton J &amp; I School, with 89 pupils on roll aged from 3 to 11, occupies the original Grade II-listed school house.

Bretton Hall College opened in 1949 as a teacher training college, and specialist arts college of higher education. Among its more well known alumni are the TV comedy team known as The League of Gentleman, writers Colin Welland, Kay Mellor and John Godber and educationalist Sir Ken Robinson. John Godber wrote a play about life as a drama student at the college, It Started With a Kiss. The college offered University of Leeds degrees and was later, subsequently affiliated to the University of Leeds but closed in their care in 2007.

==Religion==
West Bretton was divided between the parishes of Sandal Magna and Silkstone and a chapel of ease was built by the Dronfields in 1358. St Bartholemew&#x27;s Chapel was mentioned in a will of 1406. In 1744 the old chapel was replaced on a different site by the present Park Chapel which contained the Wentworth&#x27;s family pew. It was given to the Diocese of Wakefield in 1959.

Methodism came to the village in 1811. A cottage, rented from the estate, was registered as a place of worship for Protestant Dissenters, Primitive Methodists in 1861. Methodists and Anglicans created a local ecumenical partnership, the Church in West Bretton, in 1982. It uses the mid-19th century Methodist premises.

==Yorkshire Sculpture Park==

The Yorkshire Sculpture Park, consists of of landscaped ground with a large collection of sculptures including some by Elisabeth Frink, some by Auguste Rodin, and others by local sculptors Barbara Hepworth, born in Wakefield, and Henry Moore, born in Castleford.

==Sport==

West Bretton Cricket Club on Park Lane and has two teams in the Pontefract &amp; District Cricket League, in Divisions 2 and 5. The Sunday side plays in the Barnsley &amp; District Sunday League, in Division 1. In 2007 the club celebrated its centenary year, and marked the occasion by inviting the former England wicket-keeper turned artist Jack Russell to visit the ground and paint a landscape of the pitch and clubhouse.

In 2021 West Bretton Football Club was founded by members of the cricket club. They play in the Barnsley &amp; District Sunday League Division 1.

<text>Cathay Pacific Airways Limited, or simply Cathay Pacific, is the flag carrier of Hong Kong, with its head office and main hub located at Hong Kong International Airport. The airline&#x27;s operations and its subsidiaries have scheduled passenger and cargo services to more than 190 destinations and more than 60 countries worldwide including codeshares and joint ventures.

Cathay Pacific operates a fleet consisting of Airbus A321neo, Airbus A330, Airbus A350, and Boeing 777 aircraft. Cathay Cargo operates two models of Boeing 747. Defunct wholly-owned subsidiary airline Cathay Dragon, which ceased operations in 2020, operated to 44 destinations in the Asia-Pacific region from its Hong Kong base. In 2010, Cathay Pacific and Cathay Cargo (previously Cathay Pacific Cargo), together with Cathay Dragon, transported nearly 27 million passengers and more than 1.8 million tons of cargo and mail.

Cathay Pacific was founded on 24 September 1946 by Australian Sydney H. de Kantzow and American Roy C. Farrell. The airline celebrated its 70th anniversary in 2016. As of March 2024, its major shareholders are Swire Pacific with a 45% stake, Air China with 30% and Qatar Airways with 9.9%.

Cathay Pacific is one of the founding members of Oneworld. The airline is ranked as a 5-star airline and has been ranked as the world&#x27;s best airline four times by Skytrax. In 2018, it was the 19th-largest airline group in the world ranked by traffic. As of 2024, it is ranked as the fifth best airline in the world.

==History==
===1946–1960: The early years===
Cathay Pacific Airways was founded on 24 September 1946 in Hong Kong. Sydney &quot;Syd&quot; de Kantzow, Roy Farrell, Neil Buchanan, Donald Brittan Evans and Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Stanley Russell were the initial shareholders. Buchanan and Russell had already worked for de Kantzow and Farrell at Roy Farrell Import-Export Company, the predecessor of Cathay Pacific, that was initially headquartered in Shanghai. Both de Kantzow and Farrell were Ex-Air Force pilots who had flown The Hump, a route over the Himalayan mountains. Farrell purchased the airline&#x27;s first aircraft, a Douglas DC-3, nicknamed &quot;Betsy&quot;, at Bush Field, New York City in 1945. The company began freight services on 28 January 1950 from Sydney to Shanghai, after Farrell and Russell flew the plane to Australia and obtained a licence to carry freight (but not passengers) earlier that month. Its first commercial flight was a shipment of Australian goods. The profitable business soon attracted attention from Republic of China government officials. After several instances where the company&#x27;s planes were detained by authorities in Shanghai, on 11 May 1946, the company relocated, flying its two planes to Hong Kong. Farrell and de Kantzow re-registered their business in Hong Kong on 24 September 1946 as Cathay Pacific Airways Limited, while another sister company, The Roy Farrell Export Import Company (Hong Kong) Limited, was incorporated on 28 August 1946 and chartered some flights from Cathay. (According to &quot;International Directory of Company Histories&quot;, two companies were formed for tax purposes.)

They named the airline &quot;Cathay&quot;, the ancient name given to China, and &quot;Pacific&quot; because Farrell speculated that they would one day fly across the Pacific (which happened in the 1970s). Moreover, to avoid the name &quot;Air Cathay&quot; as it had already been used in a comic. The Chinese name for the company (&quot;&quot;) was not settled on until the 1950s. It comes from a meaning &quot;Peace and Prosperity&quot; and was at the time often used by other businesses called &quot;Cathay&quot; in English.

According to legend, the airline&#x27;s unique name was conceived by Farrell and some foreign correspondents at the bar of the Manila Hotel, while another narrative was the name was taken in the Cathay Hotel in Shanghai Bund, during drinking and brainstorming, and choosing Cathay was to avoid the word China in the airline name. On Cathay Pacific&#x27;s maiden voyage, de Kantzow and Peter Hoskins flew from Sydney to Hong Kong via Manila. The airline initially flew routes between Hong Kong, Sydney, Manila, Singapore, Shanghai, Saigon, Bangkok, with additional chartered destinations. The airline grew quickly. By 1947, it had added another five DC-3s and two Vickers Catalina seaplanes to its fleet.

In 1948, a new legal person of Cathay Pacific Airways was incorporated, with John Swire &amp; Sons (now known as Swire Group), China Navigation Company, Australian National Airways being the new shareholders of the new entity, acquiring the assets from the old legal person; the old legal person, was renamed into Cathay Pacific Holdings, as well as retaining 10% shares of the new Cathay Pacific Airways. de Kantzow, Farrell and Russell were the shareholders of Cathay Pacific Holdings at that time. It was reported that the colonial British government of Hong Kong required the airline was majority-owned by the British. Despite de Kantzow being a British subject through his Australian roots, Farrell was an American, thus forcing them to sell their majority stake. Under Swire&#x27;s management, de Kantzow remained in the airline until 1951, while Farrell had sold his minority stake in Cathay Pacific soon after Swire&#x27;s takeover in 1948, due to his wife&#x27;s health problems. He returned to Texas and became a successful businessman.

Swire later acquired 52% of Cathay Pacific Airways. , the airline is still owned by Swire Group to the extent of 45% through its subsidiary Swire Pacific Limited, as the largest shareholder. However, Swire Group also formed a shareholders&#x27; agreement with the second largest shareholder, Air China (which controlled by state-owned China National Aviation Holding), which Cathay Pacific and Air China had a cross ownership.

In the late 1940s, the Hong Kong Government divided the local aviation market between Cathay Pacific and its only local competitor, the Jardine Matheson-owned Hong Kong Airways: Cathay Pacific was allocated routes to the south (including South-East Asia and Australia), while Hong Kong Airways was allocated routes to the north (including mainland China, Korea, and Japan). The situation changed with the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China and the Korean War, which reduced the viability of the northern routes. In 1959, Cathay Pacific acquired Hong Kong Airways, and became the dominant airline in Hong Kong.

Under Swire, another important sister company, HAECO, was established in 1950. Nowadays, it&#x27;s one of the major aeroplane repair service companies of Hong Kong with divisions in other cities of China.

===1960–1990: Expansion===
The airline thrived during the late 1950s and into the 1960s, culminating in its acquisition of Hong Kong Airways on July 1, 1959. Between 1962 and 1967, the airline recorded double digit growth on average every year and became one of the world&#x27;s first airlines to operate international services to Fukuoka, Nagoya and Osaka in Japan. In 1964, it carried its one millionth passenger and acquired its first jet engine aircraft, the Convair 880. In 1967, it became an all jet airline with the replacement of its last Lockheed L-188 Electra with a Convair 880.
In the 1970s, Cathay Pacific installed a computerised reservation system and flight simulators. In 1971, Cathay Pacific Airways received the first Boeing aircraft 707-320B. By 1972, it had five 707s. The new aircraft colour was known as Brunswick green. In July 1976, it began operating a Boeing 707 freighter from Hong Kong to Seoul, Bangkok and Singapore.

In 1974, Cathay Pacific almost purchased the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 to open a new flight route. During the flight route application process with the British government, due to the pressure from the British government, Cathay Pacific changed the application to apply for a route from Hong Kong to London using a Boeing 747. The application was ultimately rejected. In 1979, the airline acquired its first Boeing 747 and applied for traffic rights to fly to London in 1980, with the first flight taking place on 16 July.

Expansion continued into the 1980s. In 1982, Cathay Pacific Airways introduced Cathay Pacific Cargo (now Cathay Cargo), which provided cargo service to initiate the trend of Hong Kong becoming one of the largest re-export trading ports of the world. The airline&#x27;s long-haul dedicated cargo services started a twice a week with Hong Kong-Frankfurt-London service operated jointly with Lufthansa. Cathay Pacific kept its service to Vancouver in 1983, with service on to San Francisco in 1986, when an industry-wide boom encouraged route growth to many European and North American centres including London, Brisbane, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Rome, Paris, Zurich and Manchester.

On 15 May 1986, the airline went public and was listed in the Main Board of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong.

===1990–2000: Rebranding, renewal, and Oneworld===
In January 1990, Cathay Pacific and its parent company, Swire Pacific, acquired a significant shareholding in Dragonair, and a 75% stake in cargo airline Air Hong Kong in 1994. In 1994, the airline launched a program to upgrade its passenger service, including a HK$23 million program to update its image. Its logo was updated in 1994, and again in 2014.

The airline began a fleet replacement program in the mid 1990s, which cost a total of US$9 billion. In 1996, CITIC Pacific increased its holdings in Cathay Pacific from 10% to 25%, and two other Chinese companies, CNAC(G) and CTS, also bought substantial holdings, while the Swire Group holding was reduced to 44%. According to the &quot;International Directory of Company Histories&quot;, the sale of a 12.5% stake of Cathay Pacific by Swire Pacific to a Chinese state-owned company was regarded &quot;as evidence of China&#x27;s sincerity in maintaining the prosperity of Hong Kong.&quot;

In 1997, Cathay Pacific updated the registration numbers and flags on its fleet in conjunction with the handover of Hong Kong from the United Kingdom to China.
On 21 May 1998, Cathay Pacific took the first delivery of the Boeing 777-300 at a ceremony in Everett. On 21 September 1998, Cathay Pacific, together with American Airlines, British Airways, Canadian Airlines, and Qantas, co-founded Oneworld airline alliance. Cathay Pacific temporarily took over the domestic and international operations of Philippine Airlines during its two-week shutdown from 26 September to 7 October 1998. The airline was hurt by the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s, but recorded a record HK$5 billion profit in 2000.

====Transfer to Chek Lap Kok and transpolar flights====
On 5 July 1998, Cathay Pacific operated its last flight from Kai Tak International Airport to London Heathrow Airport, with the former airport ceasing operations after more than 73 years of operation. The next day, Cathay Pacific began flights from New York John F. Kennedy International Airport to the new Hong Kong-Chek Lap Kok International Airport. This flight was also the world&#x27;s first nonstop transpolar flight from New York to Hong Kong.

===2000–2010: Industrial troubles and acquisitions===

The year 2000 saw Cathay Pacific experience labour relations issues while completing the acquisition of Dragonair.

====The 49ers – employment dispute====
In 2001, the Hong Kong Aircrew Officers Association (HKAOA) launched a &quot;work to rule&quot; campaign to further its campaign for pay improvements and changes to roster scheduling practices. The action involved pilots refusing to work flights that were not scheduled on their roster. Although this alone did not cause extensive disruption, rostered pilots began to call in sick for their flights. Combined with the work-to-rule campaign, the airline was unable to cover all of its scheduled flights, and cancellations resulted. Cathay Pacific steadfastly refused to negotiate with the HKAOA under threat of industrial action.

On 9 July 2001, reportedly following a comprehensive review of the employment histories of all its pilots, the company fired 49 of its 1,500 pilots. This group became known colloquially as &quot;the 49ers&quot;. Nearly half of the fired pilots were captains, representing five percent of the total pilot group. Of the 21 officers of the HKAOA, nine were fired, including four of the seven union negotiators.

Then-HKAOA president Captain Nigel Demery took the view that &quot;the firing was pure intimidation, a union-bust straight up, designed to be random enough to put the fear in all pilots that they might be next, no reason given&quot;. The dismissals were challenged in a number of legal proceedings, but none were reinstated. The airline later offered the 49 pilots it terminated in 2001 the chance to reapply for pilot positions with its cargo division, guaranteeing such applicants first interviews, subject to passing psychometric testing. Nineteen former employees applied and twelve were offered jobs.

On 11 November 2009, 18 of the 49ers succeeded in the Hong Kong Court of First Instance concerning their joint claims for breach of contract, breach of the Employment Ordinance, and defamation.

Judge Anselmo Reyes ruled that the airline had contravened the Employment Ordinance by dismissing the pilots without a valid reason, adding that they had been sacked primarily because of union activities. He also held that remarks by then-chief operating officer Philip Chen Nanlok and current chief executive Tony Tyler after the sackings were defamatory. The judge handed the pilots a victory in their long-running legal battle, with individual awards of HK$3.3 million for defamation together with a month&#x27;s pay and HK$150,000 for the sackings.

On 24 December 2010, judges Frank Stock, Susan Kwan and Johnson Lam of the Court of Appeal overturned the judgment of the lower court to the extent that the claim for wrongful termination of the contract was dismissed. The finding that Cathay Pacific wrongly sacked the 18 pilots for their union activities was upheld. The court upheld the defamation claim but reduced the damages for the defamatory comments made by Cathay Pacific management. The judges also modified the judgment awarding payment of legal costs to the pilots and instead said that they should now pay some of Cathay&#x27;s costs.

The leader of the 49er Plaintiffs, Captain John Warham, launched a book titled &quot;The 49ers – The True Story&quot; on 25 March 2011.

The pilots were awarded leave on 26 October 2011 to take their case to the Court of Final Appeal. The matter was heard before Hon. Mr. Justices Bokhary, Chan and Ribeiro who are all Permanent Judges of the Court of Final Appeal. The matters to be decided upon by the Court concerned wrongful termination of contract and the level of damages for defamation. The case was heard by the Court of Final Appeal on 27 August 2012.

On 26 September 2012, 11 years after they were sacked, the 49ers were finally judged to have won the 3 prime issues of their legal case: breach of contract, breach of the Employment Ordinance, and defamation. The Court of Final Appeal agreed with the Court of Appeal&#x27;s methodology for reducing the defamation damages. However, it reinstated one month&#x27;s salary for each of the 49ers.

Regarding breach of contract, the overall picture leading to dismissal and events immediately after were analysed by the courts, not just the dismissal letter. Regarding the Employment Ordinance, an important aspect was that the judge defined the scope of &quot;union activities&quot; and its protection for workers in Hong Kong. The Court concluded: &quot;Accordingly, most (possibly all) union-sponsored action is potentially protected by s 21B(1)(b), but if the action is not carried out &quot;at [an] appropriate time&quot;, it is excluded from the provision&quot;. There was no challenge by Cathay Pacific to the Court of Appeal&#x27;s decision to uphold the original Judge&#x27;s conclusion that the statements made by Cathay Executives were defamatory of the plaintiffs.

John Warham, referring to the effect the fight has had on pilots&#x27; families, said: &quot;In terms of human life, three people are dead because of what Cathay Pacific did to us. That&#x27;s on their conscience, I hope they can live with that.&quot;

====Acquisition and downsizing of Dragonair====
On 28 September 2006, the airline underwent a shareholding realignment under which Dragonair became a wholly owned subsidiary but continued to operate under its brand. Acquiring Dragonair meant gaining more access to the restricted, yet rapidly growing, mainland China market and more opportunities for sharing of resources. CNAC, and its subsidiary, Air China, acquired a 17.5 percent stake in Cathay Pacific, and the airline doubled its shareholding in Air China to 17.5 percent. CITIC Pacific reduced its shareholding to 17.5 percent and Swire Group reduced its shareholding to 40 percent.

Dragonair had originally planned significant international expansion. It was already operating services to Bangkok and Tokyo, and was to have a dedicated cargo fleet of nine Boeing 747-400BCF aircraft by 2009 operating to New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco and Columbus. It had also acquired three Airbus A330-300 aircraft to commence services to Sydney and Seoul.
Following the acquisition by Cathay Pacific, Dragonair&#x27;s proposed expansion plans underwent a comprehensive route compatibility analysis with the Cathay network to reduce duplication. Dragonair services to Bangkok and Tokyo were terminated, and new services launched to Sendai, Phuket, Manila, and Kathmandu. With the merging of similar departments at the two previously separate airlines, some Dragonair staff have had their employment contracts transferred to Cathay Pacific, except Dragonair Pilots and Cabin Crew and others made redundant due to the efficiencies gained in the merger. This resulted in an approximately 37 percent decrease in the amount of staff contractually employed by Dragonair.

In January 2016, Cathay Pacific announced it was rebranding Dragonair as Cathay Dragon.

On 21 October 2020, Cathay Pacific announced that it would shut down all operations of Cathay Dragon and merge it with its parent company due to the lack of customers and heavy economic problems brought by the COVID-19 pandemic. This merger marked the end for the subsidiary carrier after 35 years of operation. Cathay Pacific and its wholly owned subsidiary, HK Express, would take over Cathay Dragon&#x27;s existing routes.

====Economic challenges====

To celebrate the airline&#x27;s 60th anniversary in 2006, a year of roadshows named the &quot;Cathay Pacific 60th Anniversary Skyshow&quot; was held where the public could see the developments of the airline, play games, meet some of the airline staff, and view vintage uniforms. Cathay Pacific also introduced anniversary merchandise and in-flight meals served by restaurants in Hong Kong in collaboration with the celebrations.

In June 2008, Cathay Pacific entered into a plea bargain with the United States Department of Justice in respect of antitrust investigations over air cargo price-fixing agreements. It was fined US$60 million. The airline has subsequently set up an internal Competition Compliance Office, reporting to chief operating officer John Slosar, to ensure that the Group complies with all relevant competition and antitrust laws in the jurisdiction in which it operates. The breaches for which Cathay Pacific Cargo were being investigated in the US were not illegal under Hong Kong competition law.

In September 2008, three of Cathay Pacific&#x27;s top ten global accounts, Lehmann Brothers, AIG and Merrill Lynch, hit financial trouble.

In March 2009, the airline reported a record full-year loss of HK$8.56 billion for 2008, which was also the carrier&#x27;s first since the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis. The record loss included fuel-hedging losses of HK$7.6 billion and a HK$468 million charge for a price-fixing fine in the US It had to scrap its final dividend. The hedging losses were a result of locking in fuel prices at higher than the prevailing market price. As of the end of 2008, Cathay Pacific has hedged about half of its fuel needs until the end of 2011. The airline at the time estimated that it would face no further cash costs from the hedges if the average market price stood at US$75, enabling it to recoup provisions it made in 2008.

The flattening out of fuel prices resulted in Cathay Pacific recording a paper fuel hedging gain for its half-year reports for 2009. However, as a result of the global economic situation, the Group reported an operating loss. Given the current economic climate, and in line with the steps being taken by other major airlines around the world, the airline has undertaken a comprehensive review of all its routes and operations. This has resulted in frequencies being reduced to certain destinations, ad hoc cancellations on other routes, deferred capital expenditure, parked aircraft and introduced a Special Leave Scheme for staff to conserve money. According to CEO Tony Tyler, the yield from passengers was &quot;hugely down&quot; and the airline had lost &quot;a lot of premium traffic&quot;. He noted that it could take 20 passengers in economy to make up for the lost revenue of one fewer first class passenger flying to New York from Hong Kong.

===2010–2020: Scandals and stagnancy===

In 2010, the airline set another record high profit, amounting to HK$14.05 billion despite record losses set in the same decade. At the same time, Cathay Pacific had taken delivery of several new aircraft types, including the Airbus A330-300 and Boeing 777-300ER. Tony Tyler left his position as CEO at the airline on 31 March 2010 to pursue his new job at the IATA. Chief operating officer John Slosar had succeeded as the new CEO. In addition, New Zealand&#x27;s Commerce Commission had dropped charges against Cathay Pacific concerning the air cargo price-fixing agreements. In 2014, the airline underwent the largest network expansion in recent years which included the addition of links to Manchester, Zurich and Boston.

On 8 October 2016, Cathay Pacific retired their last passenger Boeing 747 (a 747–400 with reg B-HUJ) with a farewell scenic flight around Hong Kong after more than 35 years of service of the type. Cathay operated the 747 since August 1979, when it was inaugurated on services to Australia.

During the first half of 2016, Cathay Pacific&#x27;s passenger yields fell 10 per cent, to the lowest in seven years as competing airlines from mainland China increased direct service to the U.S. and Europe, hurting the company&#x27;s revenue from its Hong Kong hub. In October, Cathay Pacific scrapped its profit forecast for the second half of the year, less than two months after its issuance.

From 15 September 2016, Cathay Pacific decided to reintroduce fuel surcharge on many flights after its half-year net profits dropped more than 80% and it suffered HK$4.5 billion loss from wrong bets on fuel prices. As of September 2016, oil prices were halved from 2014 and stayed below US$50 a barrel.

==== 2017–2019 transformation ====
Under new leadership, the airline started to transform its business after suffering from 2 years of consecutive loss. The strategy focuses on 5Ps – Places, Planes, Product, People, and Productivity to find new sources of revenue, deliver more value to its customers and improve efficiency and productivity.

The airline restructured its organisation to be more agile and faster in decision making as well as responding to customers&#x27; needs. It has also launched 13 new routes since 2017, introduced a wide range of changes to its service, including bringing back hot meals on its most busy route between Hong Kong and Taipei, designed an inflight menu that features famous Hong Kong dishes served in all cabins, and revamped its Business Class service proposition to provide more choice, more personalisation, better presentation and improved quality in its food and beverages offerings.

The airline has also invested significantly in other hard product and digital offerings such as an upgraded website, new or refurbished lounges across its network, including the first airline lounge yoga studio at The Pier – Business in Hong Kong. Wi-Fi was introduced in 2017 and will be retrofitted across its fleet by 2020.

In February 2019, the airline issued a profit alert to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange indicating a profit of HK$2.3 billion for the 2018 financial year, signaling early signs of success of its transformation.

==== 2018 data breach ====
In 2018, the airline discovered a data breach. Data of around 9.4 million passengers were compromised during the breach, with 860,000 passport numbers, 245,000 Hong Kong identity card numbers, 403 expired credit card numbers, and 27 credit card numbers without CVV being accessed. However, no passwords were stolen. The breach was suspected in March 2018, but was confirmed only in May 2018. In March 2020, the company was fined £500,000 (U.S. $639,600) by the British Information Commissioner&#x27;s Office (ICO) and avoided the heftier penalty of U.S. $564 million under the European Union&#x27;s GDPR-derived data privacy laws, which were not in force during the discovery of the breach.

==== 2019: Acquisition of HK Express ====
On 27 March 2019, Cathay Pacific officially announced it would acquire HK Express, the only low-cost carrier in Hong Kong, citing to &quot;expect synergies in generating a new business model and is a practical way to support long-term development and to enhance competitiveness&quot;. The transaction takes Cathay Pacific HK$4.93 billion total. The transaction is closed was July 2019, and HK Express became Cathay Pacific&#x27;s wholly owned subsidiary.

==== 2019–2020: Hong Kong protests ====
During the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests, Cathay Pacific employees participated in protests at Hong Kong International Airport. The Beijing government, which is a shareholder in Cathay Pacific, ordered Cathay to suspend any employees who participated in the protest. Cathay chairman John Slosar responded, &quot;We employ 27,000 staff in Hong Kong doing all sorts of different jobs... we certainly wouldn&#x27;t dream of telling them what they have to think about something.&quot; Cathay Pacific later suspended a pilot who was arrested during a protest, and CEO Rupert Hogg declared his support of the government, and reiterated that employees who violated the company&#x27;s code of conduct could be dismissed. On 16 August, Hogg resigned due to &quot;intense criticism&quot; from Chinese authorities as a result of Cathay staff participating in the protests. Chief customer and commercial officer Paul Loo also resigned. By late September, Cathay Pacific and Cathay Dragon had terminated the employment of 31 aviation professionals, or forced their resignations, on the basis of their participation in protests or expressions of support for them.

===2020–present: COVID-19 pandemic, recovery and ongoing developments===

==== 2020: Recapitalisation and government bailout ====
On 9 June 2020, Cathay Pacific, Swire Pacific and Air China halted stock trading pending an announcement. On 10 June, Cathay Pacific and the Government of Hong Kong jointly announced a HK$39 billion recapitalisation plan and rescue package for Cathay Pacific. In the rescue package, the Government of Hong Kong will be issued HK$19.5 billion dividend-paying preference shares and HK$1.95 billion of warrants, giving it a 6% stake. The stake of the three major stakeholders, Swire Pacific, Air China, and Qatar Airways, would fall to 42%, 28% and 9.4% due to the government stake. Also, Cathay Pacific would receive a HK$7.8 billion bridging loan and the Government would have the right to appoint two observers on Cathay&#x27;s board. The finance secretary of the HKSAR Government Paul Chan said, &quot;It is not our intention to become a long-term shareholder of Cathay Pacific.&quot;

====2020–2022: COVID-19 pandemic====

The COVID-19 pandemic led to travel bans and significantly reduced flight demands, which caused Cathay Pacific to cut international flights in response. In 2020, 96% of all flights from March to May were cancelled, while the group&#x27;s subsidiary HKExpress suspended all flight operations from 23 March to 30 April 2020, due to reduced demand. At one point during the crisis, only 582 passengers flew with Cathay Pacific in an entire day.

In December 2020, the company said that it expected losses in the second half to be higher than the losses of the first half due to low demand, restructuring charges, and impairments on its fleet.

In 2021, the company posted a record annual loss of US$2.8 billion for 2020. It was also announced that the company would cut an additional 8,500 jobs.

On 22 April 2021, the company began its job cuts by closing its Canada pilot base, on the same day they began consultation with pilots at their Australia and New Zealand pilot bases regarding base closure in those jurisdictions. Pilots with the right to live and work in Hong Kong would be offered employment, however, those without the right to live and work in Hong Kong would face redundancy. On the same day, the company announced that they would review its bases in Europe and the United States later in the year.

On 12 May 2021, the company announced the closing of its Frankfurt pilot base. Around 50 pilots&#x27; jobs were at risk. As with the Canada base closing announced two and a half weeks earlier, pilots with the right to live and work in Hong Kong would be offered jobs, while those without the right to live and work in Hong Kong would face redundancy.

In June 2021, the company said that losses in 1H 2021 were expected to be lower than US$1.27 billion in 2020, due to cost-saving measures and strong demand for cargo flights.

In 2023 and in conjunction with the Airport Authority Hong Kong&#x27;s &quot;World of Winners&quot; campaign, which aimed to promote tourism within Hong Kong, the airline provided some of the 500,000 tickets in the campaign, and released them in tranches for each region. Participants were required to register for its frequent flyer program and fill in a registration form on the date for the region the participant was in.

====2023–2024: Mass flight cancellations====
From December 2023 to January 2024, Cathay had to trim its schedules by an average of twelve flights per day through to the end of February to avoid significant flight cancellations over the peak Lunar New Year period. The pre-emptive decision comes as the airline grapples with a significant pilot shortage.

The cancellations were mainly on routes with multiple daily services, allowing Cathay to transfer booked passengers onto same day services. The carrier is also under some scrutiny in Hong Kong after a spate of flight cancellations since 24 December 2023, including forty flights over four days. Cancellations peaked on 7 January when the airline axed 27 flights at short notice.

After slashing its workforce during the COVID-19 pandemic, local news outlets say Cathay Pacific is now experiencing significant difficulties recruiting pilots, especially senior pilots. The Hong Kong Free Post outlet says Cathay only recruited 100 new pilots in 2023. According to &quot;The Straits Times&quot;, around 1,000 of the airline&#x27;s 4,000 pilots were made redundant during the pandemic, while a further 1,000 resigned, effectively reducing Cathay&#x27;s pilot pool by 50% over the period.

On 12 December 2024, it was reported that Cathay have met their target of hiring 3,400 pilots to bring the airline back to pre-pandemic capacity. The airline is also planning to add another 100 pilots in January 2025. Prior to the pandemic, Cathay had a base of 3,800 pilots.

====2024 and beyond====

On 8 January 2025, Cathay Pacific announced that the airline will be returning to Rome, their 12th destination in Europe and the second Italian destination after Milan. The flight on this route will commence on 5 June 2025, operated by Airbus A350-900 aircraft.

==Corporate affairs, identity and senior leadership==

=== Business trends ===
The key trends for Cathay Pacific are (as of the financial year ending December 31):
=== Head office===

Cathay Pacific&#x27;s head office, Cathay City, is located at Hong Kong International Airport. Cathay City was scheduled to be built in increments between April and September 1998. The headquarters opened in 1998. Previously the airline&#x27;s headquarters were at the Swire House, which was a complex in Central named after the airline&#x27;s parent company.

===Major shareholders===
* Swire Pacific 45%
* Air China 29.99%
* Qatar Airways 9.61%
* HKSAR government 6.08%

===Subsidiaries and associates===
Cathay Pacific has diversified into related industries and sectors, including ground handling, aviation engineering, and inflight catering.

Companies with Cathay Pacific Group stake include:


===Livery===

From June 1971 until November 1994, Cathay Pacific aircraft used a &quot;lettuce leaf sandwich&quot; livery in Brunswick green and white over bare metal and carried the British flag on the empennage. After the handover, aircraft carry the Brand Hong Kong logo and with &quot;HONG KONG&quot; or in Chinese &quot;香港&quot; under or beside the Brand Hong Kong logo instead of using the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) flag. The HKSAR flag has never appeared on any aircraft.

All Cathay Pacific aircraft carry the following livery, logos and trademarks: the &quot;Brushwing&quot; livery on the body and the vertical stabiliser, introduced in the early 1990s, and was first deployed on a Boeing 747–400 (VR-HOT, later re-registered as B-HOT), ahead of the launch of Airbus A340 service for Cathay Pacific. It also features the &quot;Asia&#x27;s world city&quot; brandline, the Brand Hong Kong logotype and the dragon symbol; the Oneworld logo and the Swire Group logo. For most aircraft, the fuselage were all-white livery with a light green cheatline under cabin windows, but for some Cathay Pacific Cargo aircraft, especially Boeing 747-200F, they were bare-metal livery instead.

The brushwing logo consists of a calligraphic stroke against a green background; the stroke is intended to appear like the wing of a bird. The previous logo, consisting of green and white stripes, was in place from the early 1970s until 1994.

On November 1, 2015, the airline revealed a refreshed version of its previous livery, featuring a simpler paint scheme while maintaining its trademark brushwing on an all-green tail. It was first unveiled on a Boeing 777-300ER (B-KPM), in preparation for the delivery of the first Airbus A350 for Cathay Pacific. The aircraft was withdrawn from service in June 2020 amidst the COVID-19 pandemic and returned to its lessor in September 2021 at the expiration of its lease. The second aircraft was a freighter aircraft, Boeing 747-400ERF (B-LIA). Repainting was completed in November 2024.

On June 18, 2023, Cathay Pacific updated its freighter livery, which replaced the &quot;Cathay Pacific Cargo&quot; text with the larger &quot;Cathay Cargo&quot; text, as part of Cathay Pacific&#x27;s rebranding. It was first unveiled on a Boeing 747-8F (B-LJN). An Airbus A330-300 (B-HLV) was the last remaining aircraft that had the classic &quot;Brushwing&quot; livery until it was repainted in November 2024.

==Fleet==
Cathay Pacific operates a fleet of Airbus narrow-body, and a mix of Airbus and Boeing wide-body aircraft. Its cargo division, Cathay Cargo, also operates a fleet of Boeing 747 freighters. Their main fleet consists of Airbus A321neo, Airbus A330, Airbus A350 and Boeing 777 aircraft, while their cargo division operates two models of the Boeing 747: 747-400F and 747-8F.

==Loyalty programs==

Before August 2022, the airline had two separate loyalty programs: The frequent flyer program called Marco Polo Club and Asia Miles, the travel reward program. Members of Cathay are automatically enrolled as Asia Miles members.

In August 2022, the airline decided to merge both the Asia Miles and Marco Polo Club programs. Members of either program received a single membership for both.

The Cathay membership also abolished the Diamond Plus Tier which existed in the Marco Polo Club, making the Diamond Tier currently the highest tier in the Cathay membership level.

===Membership levels===
The program is divided into four tiers: Green (entry level), Silver, Gold, and Diamond. There is no joining fee.

Members earn Asia Miles and &#x27;Status Points&#x27; on eligible fare classes with Cathay Pacific and Oneworld member airlines. These are used to calculate the member&#x27;s eligibility for membership renewal, upgrade or downgrade during the membership year. Higher-tiered members are provided with increased travel benefits such as guaranteed Economy Class seat, additional baggage allowance, priority flight booking and airport lounge access.

Once members reach the required number of status points, they are granted the relevant tier for a year. At the end of the year, if the member does not hold enough status points to renew their tier, they will be downgraded.

Irrespective of tier, at the end of each membership year, the member&#x27;s status points counter is reset to zero.

==== Green ====
The Green tier is the entry level to the program. Benefits include dedicated 24-hour club service line for flight reservations, extra baggage redemption and lounge access redemption. One Business Class lounge voucher will be issued for the member or their travelling companion at reaching 200 Status Points.

==== Silver ====
Silver tier is achieved or retained when the member earns 300 Status Points during the membership year. Additional benefits for Silver Card members include advanced seat reservations, priority wait-listing, Business Class check-in counters, priority baggage handling, and Business Class lounge access when flying Cathay Pacific operated flights. Additionally, members are eligible to use the Frequent Visitor e-Channels for seamless self-service immigration clearance at Hong Kong International Airport. At 450 Status Points, members will be issued two Business Class lounge vouchers for their travelling companions. Also, members are entitled to apply for at most three Membership Holidays in their lifetime, retaining their status for one year for each application.

Cathay Silver tier status is equivalent to Oneworld Ruby tier status, which entitles members to Oneworld Ruby benefits when travelling on a Oneworld member airline.

==== Gold ====
Gold tier is achieved or retained when the member earns 600 Status Points during the membership year. Additional benefits for Gold Card members include a guaranteed Economy Class seat on Cathay Pacific flights booked 72 hours before departure, or one piece of extra baggage allowance, Business Class lounge access with one accompanying guest when flying Cathay Pacific and Oneworld-operated flights and arrival lounge access when flying Cathay Pacific-operated and marketed flights. Two Business Class lounge vouchers will be issued for their travelling companions or members on their Asia Miles Redemption List at reaching 800 Status Points. At reaching 1000 Status Points, four Cabin Upgrade vouchers (for Cathay Pacific-operated short-haul or medium-haul routes) will be issued to members and their travelling companions.

Cathay Gold tier status is equivalent to Oneworld Sapphire tier status, which entitles members to Oneworld Sapphire benefits when travelling on a Oneworld member airline.

==== Diamond ====
The highest tier, Diamond is achieved or retained when the member earns 1200 Status Points during the membership year. Additional benefits for Diamond Card members include top priority waitlisting, guaranteed Economy Class or Business Class seat on Cathay Pacific flights booked 24 hours before departure, First Class check-in counters, or one piece of extra baggage allowance, First Priority baggage handling, First Class lounge access with two guests when flying Cathay Pacific-operated flights, one guest when flying Oneworld operated flights and Business Class lounge access with two guests when flying on any airline. At 1400 Status Points, members will be issued with two First or Business lounge vouchers for their travelling companions or members on their Asia Miles Redemption List. At 1600 Status Points, four Cabin Upgrade vouchers (for any Cathay Pacific-operated routes) will be issued to members, travelling companions and members on their Asia Miles Redemption List. At 1800 Status Points, members can nominate one member for Cathay Gold tier membership.

Cathay Diamond tier status is equivalent to Oneworld Emerald tier status, which entitles members to Oneworld Emerald benefits when travelling on a Oneworld member airline.

===Asia Miles===

Asia Miles is the loyalty currency that is earned when spending through the program via Asia Miles partners. It can also be earned through flying Cathay Pacific and its Oneworld partners. One Asia Miles are equal to one HKD.

==Services==
===Ground handling===
Beginning in 2007, Cathay Pacific launched more methods to check in for flights. Among them were self-check-in using a kiosk at Hong Kong International Airport and other select destinations and checking in via a mobile phone. Cathay Pacific also launched a mobile application on App Store and Google Play, formerly named CX Mobile. Passengers can use the application to check flight arrivals and departures, check in for their flights and read about the destinations they are flying to using City Guides. The app has become a hit with passengers, making Cathay Pacific one of the industry leaders in offering mobile services to users of smartphones.

Cathay Pacific is also now following a trend among many airlines to improve its brand image to customers and shareholders with social media, and is ranked fourth worldwide. The airline now uses a range of social media tools including Facebook, Flickr, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube and blogging to share ideas with customers. In addition, it has launched a virtual tour to enable passengers to experience Cathay Pacific&#x27;s new cabins and services without having to step aboard the aircraft.

On 4 January 2011, the cargo division of the airline, Cathay Pacific Cargo, became the first airline operating out of Hong Kong to fully switch to e-air waybill. This eliminates the need for all paper documents when issuing air waybills. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) selected nine countries and territories and airlines in which to run the e-AWB pilot program, including Hong Kong and Cathay Pacific.

====Economy Class====
Cathay Pacific currently has five types of Economy Class, different on each aircraft. From the oldest 2007 type to the newest 2021 type, each has its own unique features.

===== 2007 Economy Class (ex. 330, 340, 747, 777) =====

The phased-out old Economy Class seats, previously offered on aircraft outfitted with the refurbished long-haul interiors, were designed by B/E Aerospace and introduced in July 2008. These seats include a fixed back design (shell) that allows passengers to recline without intruding on those seated behind, a PTV providing AVOD, AC power located behind a larger tray table, a coat hook and a literature pocket that has been relocated to below the seat cushion to create more legroom. The fixed shell of these seats has been criticised. The previous Economy Class seats each feature PTVs with a choice of 25 channels. These seats are in width and have of pitch. These seats were replaced with an updated Economy Class seat on aircraft receiving the Cathay Pacific&#x27;s updated long-haul interior configuration. This is no longer available as it is replaced by the new 2012 Economy Class.

=====2012 Economy Class (333, ex. 777)=====

Cathay Pacific updated its economy class seats in March 2012, replacing the older fixed back design. They have a six-inch recline (two inches over the current long-haul economy seat). These seats are in width and have of pitch.

=====2016 Economy Class (359)=====

Cathay Pacific released their new economy class on the A350-900, featuring dark green seats with a 11.1 inch touch screen, USB ports and a tablet tray. Also, seats have access to 110-volt AC power. With the new economy class design, new in-flight entertainment was also provided. The headrest size has been enlarged.

=====2017 Economy Class (777)=====

Since 2017, all Boeing 777s were retrofitted with the popular long-haul economy product Recaro CL3710 seat. In addition, the fleet featured a change in configuration from 9 abreast to 10 abreast. This increased the economy class seats on board the −300 series from 356 to 396 seats &amp; the −300ER from 182/268 seats to 201/296 seats. All new seats feature new 11.6-inch touch screens, USB ports, &amp; improved seat pitch. The seat width is .

=====2018 Economy Class (35K)=====

The A350-1000 Economy Class utilizes a highly customized version of the HAECO Vector Y+ seat. A separate drink holder and a bottle pouch are added. The screens are matted and feature a privacy layer, ensuring neighboring seats may not easily view each other&#x27;s content for added privacy. The seat is double padded, making it thicker than any other Economy Class in the fleet (Other than the A321neo, which utilizes the same seat). The faux leather headrest is also bigger.

=====2021 Economy Class (321neo)=====

The 2021 Economy Class is identical to 2018 Economy Class, featuring the HAECO Vector Y+ design except a few upgrades, such as a 4K resolution in-flight entertainment system, which had its privacy screen removed after user feedback regarding inaccessibility. In addition, a smaller LCD screen is added below the main screen for additional information such as flight time, and destination time. These aircraft were originally designated for Cathay Dragon, which had its brand dissolved prior to taking delivery of these A321neos, which is why Cathay&#x27;s A321neo economy class features a distinct Cordova red color scheme in contrast with the rest of the Cathay fleet, which all feature bottle green seating.

===Catering===
Food and beverages are complimentary on all flights, with two hot meals generally served on each flight for long haul flights, along with free alcoholic beverages. Foods served on flights from Hong Kong are provided by Cathay Pacific Catering Services (CPCS) facilities in Hong Kong. CLS Catering Services Limited, a joint venture with LSG Sky Chefs, provides inflight catering from Toronto and Vancouver airports; while Vietnam Air Caterers, a joint venture between CPCS and Vietnam Airlines, provides the same for flights from Ho Chi Minh City. Meals on Manila–Hong Kong flights are typically served in snack bags as complimentary snacks and drinks.

===In-flight entertainment===
====StudioCX (2012)====

The first type is the StudioCX system that was launched in 2012. Now, it can only be found in unrefurbished A330s. The old system features movies, TV, music, inflight map and some games. The system is identical to Cathay Dragon&#x27;s Entertainment (StudioKA).

====StudioCX (2016)====

In 2016, following the new A350-900, Cathay Pacific launched the new entertainment system. Even though on the website, it still says it&#x27;s StudioCX, but on the system, they seem to give up on the old name &quot;StudioCX&quot;. The new system features a brand new, modern and lighter design. There are lots of new content from the old system, following a new moving map (rather than the stuck map from the StudioCX system), live TV, reading materials, magazines, news, shopping, Sports24 (only on A350) and more movies. Resolution is 4K on A321s. In 2017, the introduction for the StudioCX is updated.

StudioCX, Cathay Pacific&#x27;s in-flight entertainment system, equipped with personal televisions in every seat, offers movies, Asian and Western TV programs, music and games. The airline also provides a range of different newspapers and magazines from around the world, including the airline&#x27;s in-flight magazine &quot;Discovery&quot; (now &quot;Cathay&quot;). Passengers with visual impairment can request for Hong Kong&#x27;s &quot;South China Morning Post&quot; in Braille to be available on board.
StudioCX provides Audio/Video on Demand (AVOD) for every passenger and offers up to 100 movies, 350 TV programs, about 1000 CD albums in 25 different genres, 25 radio channels and more than 70 interactive games.

==Award and recognition==
On 24 June 2024, Cathay Pacific was voted &quot;2024 World&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Best Economy Class&quot; by Skytrax.

==Accidents and incidents==
Cathay Pacific has had some incidents and accidents over its history, although none have resulted in a hull loss or loss of life since 1972. Cathay Pacific is generally regarded to have a good safety reputation and has been rated as one of the world&#x27;s safest airlines.
* On 16 July 1948, &quot;Miss Macao&quot;, a Cathay Pacific-subsidiary-operated Consolidated PBY-5A Catalina from Macau to Hong Kong was hijacked by four men, who killed the pilot after take-off. The aircraft crashed in the Pearl River Delta near Zhuhai. Twenty-six people died, leaving only one survivor, a hijacker. This was the first hijacking of a commercial airliner in the world.
* On 24 February 1949, a Cathay Pacific Douglas C-47 Skytrain from Manila to Hong Kong crashed near Braemar Reservoir after a go-around in poor weather. All 23 people on board died.
* On 13 September 1949, a Cathay Pacific Douglas C-47 Skytrain departing from Anisakan, Burma crashed on take-off when the right-hand main gear leg collapsed. There were no reported fatalities.
* On 23 July 1954, a Cathay Pacific Douglas C-54 Skymaster from Bangkok to Hong Kong was shot down by aircraft of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Air Force in the South China Sea near Hainan Island. Ten people died, leaving nine survivors. After the incident, Cathay Pacific received an apology and compensation from the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Air Force. It was apparently mistaken for a Nationalist Chinese military aircraft.
* On 5 November 1967, Cathay Pacific Flight 033, operated by a Convair 880 from Hong Kong to Saigon, overran the runway at Kai Tak Airport. One person was killed and the aircraft was written off.
* On 15 June 1972, Cathay Pacific Flight 700Z, operated by a Convair 880 from Bangkok to Hong Kong, disintegrated and crashed while the aircraft was flying at over Pleiku, Vietnam after a bomb exploded in a suitcase placed under a seat in the cabin, killing all 81 people on board. This remains the last Cathay Pacific incident to involve a total hull loss and passenger fatalities.

* On 13 April 2010, Cathay Pacific Flight 780, operated by an Airbus A330-342 from Surabaya Juanda International Airport to Hong Kong, landed safely after both engines failed due to contaminated fuel. 57 passengers were injured in the ensuing slide evacuation. Its two pilots received the Polaris Award from the International Federation of Air Line Pilots&#x27; Associations for their heroism and airmanship.
*On 2 September 2024, Cathay Pacific Flight 383, operated by an Airbus A350-1041 from Hong Kong International Airport to Zurich Airport, experiened a serious incident after a leak in fuel system of the left engine, which caused an engine fire after departing Hong Kong. The plane circled over the sea for more than half an hour to dump fuel before landing safely back in Hong Kong. There were no casualties among the 348 people on board. Following the incident, the airline conducted engine inspections of its A350 fleet and identified fifteen A350s in its fleet with affected engine components. The aircraft was repaired and returned to service.

<doc id="151576" wikidata="Q15204649" url="?curid=151576" title="Bretton Hall, West Yorkshire">
<text>Bretton Hall is a country house in West Bretton near Wakefield, West Yorkshire, England. It housed Bretton Hall College from 1949 until 2001 and was a campus of the University of Leeds (2001–2007). It is a Grade II* listed building.

==History==
In the 14th century the Bretton estate was owned by the Dronsfields and passed by marriage to the Wentworths in 1407. King Henry VIII spent three nights in the old hall and furnishings, draperies and panelling from his bedroom were moved to the new hall. A hall is marked on Christopher Saxton&#x27;s 1577 map of Yorkshire.

The present building was designed and built around 1720 by its owner, Sir William Wentworth, assisted by James Moyser, to replace the earlier hall. In 1792 it passed into the Beaumont family, latterly Barons and Viscounts Allendale, and the library and dining room were remodelled by John Carr in 1793. Monumental stables designed by George Basevi were built between 1842 and 1852. The hall was sold to the West Riding County Council in 1947. Before the sale, the panelling of the &quot;Henry VIII parlour&quot; (preserved from the earlier hall) was given to Leeds City Council and moved to Temple Newsam house.

The hall housed Bretton Hall College of Education from 1949 until 2001 and was a campus of the University of Leeds from 2001 to 2007.

Plans to convert the hall to a hotel and offices were submitted for planning approval. 
and were approved in April 2013.

==Architecture==

The oldest part of the house, the south range dates from about 1720 and was designed by the owner, Sir William Wentworth and Colonel James Moyser. 
It was enlarged when the north range was added in the 1780s by William Lindley of Doncaster. A bow window and portico were added to the south range and the block linking the two ranges was remodelled between 1811 and 1814 by Jeffrey Wyatt for Colonel Thomas and Diana Beaumont. Around 1852 Thomas Richardson added the projecting dining room on the house&#x27;s east front for Thomas Blackett Beaumont.

===Exterior===
The house has a three-storey nine-bay by five-bay main range while the rest is two storeys high. It is built in sandstone ashlar and its roof is hidden behind a balustraded parapet. It has tall ornamental chimney stacks and the Wentworth shield decorates two ornamental rainwater heads. The south range has a symmetrical facade with a central Doric portico. The ground and first-floor windows have 12-pane sashes with triangular pediments to the ground floor and cornices to the first. The shorter second floor windows have casements added later. The south front has a three-bay bow window with tall ground-floor windows. The centre window was originally a doorway accessed by a flight of four steps.

The seven-bay north range has a symmetrical facade where the three centre bays have giant pilasters supporting a pediment. Either side of central eight-panel double door are 12-pane sash windows while the first-floor has nine-pane sash windows. A three-bay link block joins the ranges and terminates in the orangery. The orangery is built on a two-step podium. Its seven bays are divided by square Tuscan piers which support the frieze, cornice and blocking course.

===Interior===
The entrance hall to the south range has a groin vaulted passage with three arches and piers and its walls are decorated with grisaille paintings. Its main staircase has a wrought iron handrail. On either side the old billiard room and former breakfast room have Adam style ceilings from about 1770. The link range has an entrance vestibule with four piers supporting a glazed dome on pendentives. On the first floor the vestibule opens onto the half-landing of the south range&#x27;s main staircase. The old drawing room has a Baroque ceiling with pendant bosses. The former library and music room were in the Regency style of the 1811–14 extensions. The library had an apse where there was an organ, a coved ceiling with rinceau decoration, and a marble fireplace. The dining room was decorated in the Rococo style in about 1852. It has an elaborate marble fireplace and frieze and its ceiling is decorated with musical instruments.

==Park and gardens==

The pleasure grounds and parkland around the hall were the work of landscape gardeners Richard Woods in the 18th century and Robert Marnock, the estate&#x27;s head gardener, in the 1820s and 1830s. The hall overlooks the River Dearne, which flows in an easterly direction through the parkland. The river is dammed to form two lakes. Oxley Bank, a linear earthwork, forms the park&#x27;s eastern boundary.

Within and around the Grade II listed parkland and pleasure grounds are several historic structures. Four lodges stand at the estate&#x27;s main entrances. North Lodge and the grade II listed Haigh Lodge were probably designed by Jeffrey Wyattville at the same time as his 1811–14 extensions at the hall. Archway Lodge, a grade II* listed building by William Atkinson in 1805 takes the form of a giant archway with fluted columns. The extensively altered Hoyland Lodge is on Litherop Lane to the south. The redundant Grade II* listed St Bartholomew&#x27;s Chapel, West Bretton built by William Wentworth in 1744 has been restored as gallery space.

The parkland is the home of the 224 acre (90 ha) Yorkshire Sculpture Park and the 100 acre (40 ha) Bretton Country Park which has been a designated local nature reserve since 1994. The development of accommodation and car parks for the college and multiple use as a country and sculpture park and general neglect in the second half of the 20th century led to the historic landscape&#x27;s fragmentation and it was designated &quot;at risk&quot; by English Heritage in 2009. Yorkshire Sculpture Park is now responsible for most of the park and, in partnership with Natural England, who provided funding, and English Heritage, has a conservation management plan for the park. Trees and scrub have been cleared to provide access to a lakeside perimeter walk.

<doc id="151577" wikidata="Q1149766" url="?curid=151577" title="Causality (physics)">
<text>Causality is the relationship between causes and effects. While causality is also a topic studied from the perspectives of philosophy and physics, it is operationalized so that causes of an event must be in the past light cone of the event and ultimately reducible to fundamental interactions. Similarly, a cause cannot have an effect outside its future light cone.

== Macroscopic vs microscopic causality ==
Causality can be defined macroscopically, at the level of human observers, or microscopically, for fundamental events at the atomic level. The strong causality principle forbids information transfer faster than the speed of light; the weak causality principle operates at the microscopic level and need not lead to information transfer. Physical models can obey the weak principle without obeying the strong version.

== Macroscopic causality ==
In classical physics, an effect cannot occur &quot;before&quot; its cause which is why solutions such as the advanced time solutions of the Liénard–Wiechert potential are discarded as physically meaningless. In both Einstein&#x27;s theory of special and general relativity, causality means that an effect cannot occur from a cause that is not in the back (past) light cone of that event. Similarly, a cause cannot have an effect outside its front (future) light cone. These restrictions are consistent with the constraint that mass and energy that act as causal influences cannot travel faster than the speed of light and/or backwards in time. In quantum field theory, observables of events with a spacelike relationship, &quot;elsewhere&quot;, have to commute, so the order of observations or measurements of such observables do not impact each other.

Another requirement of causality is that cause and effect be mediated across space and time (requirement of &quot;contiguity&quot;). This requirement has been very influential in the past, in the first place as a result of direct observation of causal processes (like pushing a cart), in the second place as a problematic aspect of Newton&#x27;s theory of gravitation (attraction of the earth by the sun by means of action at a distance) replacing mechanistic proposals like Descartes&#x27; vortex theory; in the third place as an incentive to develop dynamic field theories (e.g., Maxwell&#x27;s electrodynamics and Einstein&#x27;s general theory of relativity) restoring contiguity in the transmission of influences in a more successful way than in Descartes&#x27; theory.

== Simultaneity ==
In modern physics, the notion of causality had to be clarified. The word &quot;simultaneous&quot; is observer-dependent in special relativity. The principle is relativity of simultaneity. Consequently, the relativistic principle of causality says that the cause must precede its effect &quot;according to all inertial observers&quot;. This is equivalent to the statement that the cause and its effect are separated by a timelike interval, and the effect belongs to the future of its cause. If a timelike interval separates the two events, this means that a signal could be sent between them at less than the speed of light. On the other hand, if signals could move faster than the speed of light, this would violate causality because it would allow a signal to be sent across spacelike intervals, which means that at least to some inertial observers the signal would travel &quot;backward in time&quot;. For this reason, special relativity does not allow communication faster than the speed of light.

In the theory of general relativity, the concept of causality is generalized in the most straightforward way: the effect must belong to the future light cone of its cause, even if the spacetime is curved. New subtleties must be taken into account when we investigate causality in quantum mechanics and relativistic quantum field theory in particular. In those two theories, causality is closely related to the principle of locality. 
Bell&#x27;s Theorem shows that conditions of &quot;local causality&quot; in experiments involving quantum entanglement result in non-classical correlations predicted by quantum mechanics.

Despite these subtleties, causality remains an important and valid concept in physical theories. For example, the notion that events can be ordered into causes and effects is necessary to prevent (or at least outline) causality paradoxes such as the grandfather paradox, which asks what happens if a time-traveler kills his own grandfather before he ever meets the time-traveler&#x27;s grandmother. See also Chronology protection conjecture.

== Determinism (or, what causality is &quot;not&quot;) ==
The word &quot;causality&quot; in this context means that all effects must have specific physical causes due to fundamental interactions. Causality in this context is not associated with definitional principles such as Newton&#x27;s second law. As such, in the context of &quot;causality,&quot; a force does not &quot;cause&quot; a mass to accelerate nor vice versa. Rather, Newton&#x27;s Second Law can be derived from the conservation of momentum, which itself is a consequence of the spatial homogeneity of physical laws. 

The empiricists&#x27; aversion to metaphysical explanations (like Descartes&#x27; vortex theory) meant that scholastic arguments about what caused phenomena were either rejected for being untestable or were just ignored. The complaint that physics does not explain the &quot;cause&quot; of phenomena has accordingly been dismissed as a problem that is philosophical or metaphysical rather than empirical (e.g., Newton&#x27;s &quot;Hypotheses non fingo&quot;). According to Ernst Mach the notion of force in Newton&#x27;s second law was pleonastic, tautological and superfluous and, as indicated above, is not considered a consequence of any principle of causality. Indeed, it is possible to consider the Newtonian equations of motion of the gravitational interaction of two bodies, 

:formula_1

as two coupled equations describing the positions formula_2 and formula_3 of the two bodies, &quot;without interpreting the right hand sides of these equations as forces&quot;; the equations just describe a process of interaction, without any necessity to interpret one body as the cause of the motion of the other, and allow one to predict the states of the system at later (as well as earlier) times.

The ordinary situations in which humans singled out some factors in a physical interaction as being prior and therefore supplying the &quot;because&quot; of the interaction were often ones in which humans decided to bring about some state of affairs and directed their energies to producing that state of affairs—a process that took time to establish and left a new state of affairs that persisted beyond the time of activity of the actor. It would be difficult and pointless, however, to explain the motions of binary stars with respect to each other in that way which, indeed, are time-reversible and agnostic to the arrow of time, but with such a direction of time established, the entire evolution system could then be completely determined.

The possibility of such a time-independent view is at the basis of the deductive-nomological (D-N) view of scientific explanation, considering an event to be explained if it can be subsumed under a scientific law. In the D-N view, a physical state is considered to be explained if, applying the (deterministic) law, it can be derived from given initial conditions. (Such initial conditions could include the momenta and distance from each other of binary stars at any given moment.) Such &#x27;explanation by determinism&#x27; is sometimes referred to as causal determinism. A disadvantage of the D-N view is that causality and determinism are more or less identified. Thus, in classical physics, it was assumed that all events are caused by earlier ones according to the known laws of nature, culminating in Pierre-Simon Laplace&#x27;s claim that if the current state of the world were known with precision, it could be computed for any time in the future or the past (see Laplace&#x27;s demon). However, this is usually referred to as Laplace &quot;determinism&quot; (rather than &#x27;Laplace causality&#x27;) because it hinges on determinism in mathematical models as dealt with in the mathematical Cauchy problem. 

Confusion between causality and determinism is particularly acute in quantum mechanics, this theory being acausal in the sense that it is unable in many cases to identify the causes of actually observed effects or to predict the effects of identical causes, but arguably deterministic in some interpretations (e.g. if the wave function is presumed not to actually collapse as in the many-worlds interpretation, or if its collapse is due to hidden variables, or simply redefining determinism as meaning that probabilities rather than specific effects are determined).

==Distributed causality==
Theories in physics like the butterfly effect from chaos theory open up the possibility of a type of distributed parameter systems in causality. The butterfly effect theory proposes:
&quot;Small variations of the initial condition of a nonlinear dynamical system may produce large variations in the long term behavior of the system.&quot; This opens up the opportunity to understand a distributed causality.

A related way to interpret the butterfly effect is to see it as highlighting the difference between the application of the notion of causality in physics and a more general use of causality as represented by Mackie&#x27;s INUS conditions. In classical (Newtonian) physics, in general, only those conditions are (explicitly) taken into account, that are both necessary and sufficient. For instance, when a massive sphere is caused to roll down a slope starting from a point of unstable equilibrium, then its velocity is assumed to be caused by the force of gravity accelerating it; the small push that was needed to set it into motion is not explicitly dealt with as a cause. In order to be a physical cause there must be a certain proportionality with the ensuing effect. A distinction is drawn between triggering and causation of the ball&#x27;s motion. By the same token the butterfly can be seen as triggering a tornado, its cause being assumed to be seated in the atmospherical energies already present beforehand, rather than in the movements of a butterfly.

==Causal sets==

In causal set theory, causality takes an even more prominent place. The basis for this approach to quantum gravity is in a theorem by David Malament. This theorem states that the causal structure of a spacetime suffices to reconstruct its conformal class, so knowing the conformal factor and the causal structure is enough to know the spacetime. Based on this, Rafael Sorkin proposed the idea of Causal Set Theory, which is a fundamentally discrete approach to quantum gravity. The causal structure of the spacetime is represented as a poset, while the conformal factor can be reconstructed by identifying each poset element with a unit volume.

<text>Wetherby ( ) is a market town and civil parish in the City of Leeds, West Yorkshire, England. It is close to West Yorkshire county&#x27;s border with North Yorkshire and lies approximately from Leeds city centre, from York and from Harrogate. The town stands on the River Wharfe and, for centuries, it has been a crossing place and staging post on the Great North Road midway between London and Edinburgh.

Wetherby Bridge, which spans the River Wharfe, is a Scheduled Ancient Monument and a Grade II listed structure. The course of the Old Great North Road passes through the town and, as result of its situation on the road, as well as being a major cattle droving route from Scotland to London, many coaching inns were established in Wetherby which are still used by travellers today.

The town lies in the Wetherby ward of Leeds City Council and the Wetherby and Easingwold parliamentary constituency. It was listed in the 2018 Sunday Times report on the &quot;Best Places to Live in Northern England&quot;.

==Etymology==
Wetherby is first attested in the Domesday Book of 1086, as &quot;Wedrebi&quot;. The name derives from the Old Norse words &quot;veðr&quot; (&quot;wether, castrated male sheep&quot;, in its genitive singular form &quot;veðrar&quot;) and &quot;bý&quot; (&quot;farmstead, village&quot;). Thus the name once meant &quot;wether&#x27;s farmstead&quot;.

== History ==

Historically, Wetherby was a part of the Claro Wapentake, as part of the parish of Spofforth, within the West Riding of Yorkshire.

In the 12th and 13th centuries, the Knights Templar, and later the Knights Hospitallers, were granted land and properties in Yorkshire. The local preceptory founded in 1217 was at Ribston Park. In 1240, the Knights Templar were granted by Royal Charter of Henry III the right to hold a market in Wetherby (known then as Werreby) on Thursdays and a yearly fair was permitted lasting three days over the day of St James the Apostle.

From 1318 to 1319, the North of England suffered many raids from the Scots. After the Battle of Bannockburn, Wetherby was burned and many people were taken and killed. According to the blue plaque at the entrance to the lane, &quot;Scott Lane&quot; could be named after the Scottish raiders in 1318 or the 18th-century drovers who used Wetherby as a watering place.

In the English Civil War in 1644, before marching to Tadcaster and on to Marston Moor, the Parliamentarians spent two days in Wetherby joining forces with the Scots.

In the heyday of the coaching era, Wetherby had up to forty inns and alehouses. The first recorded mail coach arrived in Wetherby in 1786.

In 1824, William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire sold the town of Wetherby (except one house) to finance work at Chatsworth. Wetherby provides the setting for the novel &quot;Oldbury&quot; (1869) by Annie Keary.

===20th century===

During the First World War, many Wetherby men served with either the 5th or 9th Battalion, West Yorkshire Regiment, which had great losses in Flanders. A war memorial designed by E. F. Roslyn was dedicated on 22 April 1922.

In 1918, residents contributed to support the crew of the HMS &quot;Wetherby&quot; despite hardship and shortages caused by the war.

During the Second World War, nearby RAF Tockwith was renamed RAF Marston Moor to avoid confusion with RAF Topcliffe. Part of the airfield is now a driver training centre and the old control tower is used as the offices. Parts of the runways can still be seen. Clark Gable was stationed at Marston Moor, during the Second World War, as a member of the USAAF ground staff, with the rank of captain. He was transferred to RAF Polebrook in Northamptonshire. Adolf Hitler offered a reward to anyone who was able to catch the airman. Group Captain Leonard Cheshire was stationed at Marston Moor for a short while before leaving to become commander of the 617 Dam Buster squadron.

Wetherby had the only stone frigate north of London, built on &quot;Hallfield Lane&quot; in 1942 (it later became the local secondary school), named in turn; HMS &quot;Cabot&quot;, &quot;Demetrius&quot;, &quot;Rodney&quot; and &quot;Ceres&quot;. The base was closed in 1958 and transferred to Chatham.

Throughout the 1960s, the town council deliberated over how best to enlarge the town centre to cope with the needs of a growing population and to provide the town with a purpose built supermarket. Plans were put forward to enlarge the town over the ings, or to develop the town centre into a pedestrian precinct. In the end, it was decided to build a purpose built shopping precinct, which was built in the 1970s and underwent a significant redevelopment throughout 2003. By 2006, the remaining open parts of the Horsefair Centre were enclosed under a glass canopy roof.

==Governance==

Since 2010, Wetherby has been in the Elmet and Rothwell constituency, a marginal seat. The town&#x27;s MP is Alec Shelbrooke, a Conservative, who has his constituency offices in the town. Wetherby is an electoral ward of Leeds City Council and has a town council responsible for amenities, such as parks.

The coat of arms transferred over from the former Wetherby Rural District Council; it was the first such arms to be granted by the College of Arms to a rural district council, on 7 January 1938.

===Crime and law enforcement===
West Yorkshire Police have a station in Boston Road.

===Twinnings===
* – Privas, France

==Geography==
===Divisions and suburbs===
* Ainsty is in the north of Wetherby, off the B1224 Deighton Road. Its earliest buildings date from the 1940s, made up of council and private housing. Much of the area was built by developer Norman Ashton in the 1960s. 
* Hallfield, in the south-east, is a large council estate and has some houses built by the prison service and some sheltered housing. The area is home to Wetherby High School, St James&#x27; Primary School, the cemetery, the Church on the Corner and Mason House Community Centre. A new medical centre has been built on the edge of the estate on the site of the demolished Hallfield Mansion.
* Micklethwaite was a village in its own right, but its identity as a separate area has disappeared since the Micklethwaite Farm&#x27;s buildings were demolished in the 2000s and replaced by 150 dwellings known as &quot;Micklethwaite&quot;. It is situated south of the River Wharfe and contains the police station, magistrates court, the Mercure Hotel and the town&#x27;s leisure centre and swimming baths.
* Deighton Bar is situated in the north-east, bordering Ainsty and Sandbeck and the village of Kirk Deighton in North Yorkshire, as is one street in Deighton Bar, Autumn Avenue. The oldest houses are in a row of terrace houses on Deighton Road. The area is home to Deighton Gates primary school between Ainsty and Deighton Bar. Most housing was built in the late 1970s by Barratt Developments.
* Barleyfields is a residential area of housing in central Wetherby. Its oldest houses are large Victorian terraces on Sandringham Terrace and the former quarry workers&#x27; cottages behind Prospect Villas. The area is situated in the middle of a large triangular dismantled railway junction. It is home to St Joseph&#x27;s Primary School, Crossley Street Primary School and Barleyfields Community Centre.
* Sandbeck is home to the Sandbeck Industrial Estate, some 1960s Norman Ashton houses and some 1970s council houses. 
* Linton Park View is an affluent area of private houses, mostly built in the 1970s between Spofforth Hill and Linton Lane in the north-west of Wetherby.
* Spofforth Hill, named after the road that passes through it, is an affluent area off the A661. It contains many large detached houses from Victorian times onwards. In the 1980s and 1990s, the area was expanded after Shepherd Homes built a housing estate on former agricultural land called the &quot;Glebe Field Estate&quot;.

===Weather and climate===

Wetherby has a cool, fairly moist climate with changeable weather year-round. Liquid equivalent precipitation totals about 630mm per year and is fairly well distributed through the seasons.

Cloudy weather tends to predominate, but settled, sunny spells occur at times.

Winter temperatures average just above freezing for lows, with highs about 5–9 °C.

Frost and snow are not uncommon, but are rarely severe or prolonged. Temperatures very rarely drop as low as −10 °C.

Summers are mild, with lows generally 10–15nbsp;°C and highs of 15–25 °C, with a few hot days approaching 30 °C.

== Demography ==

According to the 2001 UK Census, Wetherby had a population of 11,155 and the wider Wetherby ward had a population of 26,473 By the time of the 2011 census, the population of the town had fallen to 10,772. Since this was taken, the immediate town area has grown considerably. 150 new dwellings were built in one development in Micklethwaite, then a further 20 were added, flats have also appeared at the former Motorworld, La Locanda Restaurant, Deighton Road car garage, Fields Works and the cattle market. In the late 2010s, two new large scale greenfield housing developments started to be developed; one in the Sandbeck area and another in the Spofforth Hill area.

== Economy ==

The Wharfedale Brewery became Oxley&#x27;s mineral water factory during the inter-war years. It was demolished in the 1950s and redeveloped as the West Yorkshire Road Car Company bus depot and bus station; it has been further redeveloped to include shops, offices and a restaurant. The site of the watermill, by the weir, is now occupied by riverside flats.

Wetherby has a manufacturing presence in the town and on the Thorp Arch Trading Estate. Many residents work in Leeds or on the Sandbeck industrial estate, major retailers in the town centre or at Thorp Arch. Large employers include the British Library, Morrisons, Goldenfry Foods and Moores Furniture.

2017 saw the return of brewing to Wetherby, when the Wetherby Brew Company established a new microbrewery and taproom on the York Road Industrial Estate.

===Historic public houses===

In its heyday, Wetherby had seventeen pubs in its town centre. Only eleven now remain, of which ten are still open. The town&#x27;s oldest surviving pub, the &quot;Brunswick Hotel&quot;, closed in 2003 and reopened as &quot;Harris&#x27; Bar&quot;; in 2012, it reopened again as &quot;The Brunswick&quot; after refurbishment by Enterprise Inns. The &quot;Three Legs&quot; public house closed in 2007 and became &quot;bar Thr3&quot;, Wetherby&#x27;s first non smoking pub.

During the Second World War, the &quot;Angel&quot; public house served German and Italian prisoners of war from the nearby camps and, being the only pub in the town to do so, attracted some controversy as a result.

===Present day===

Goldenfry, which started as a fish and chip shop but which now makes other products including own-brand gravy for every UK supermarket, is situated on Sandbeck Way. Inspirepac has a factory on Sandbeck Lane.

The ICC Group is a multi national UK IT reseller and service provider, which was founded in 1998; it has its HQ at Sandbeck Lane. Supporting over 10% of the FTSE100, it specialises in HP/IBM and Dell products and associated IT services.

Proactis, a leading modular Source-to-Pay solutions provider, has been in based in Wetherby since 1996. Despite transitioning to a remote first workforce in 2020, the company still retains a large office in the town centre.

Farnell opened its first factory in 1956 on the York Road Industrial Estate, leasing some former W.D. Nissen huts. By 1963, it required new premises and moved to the Sandbeck Industrial Estate. In 1997, GSM Valtech Industries purchased the metalwork fabrication site of Farnell Electronics. GSM Valtech&#x27;s operations were transferred to the Wetherby site, increasing the manufacturing area to 28,000 sq ft and gaining staff with 40 years&#x27; experience in manufacturing electronic enclosures. Substantial investment followed. The company specialises in the manufacture and wholesale distribution of electrical, electronic and measurement, control and instrumentation equipment. In the 1990s the company moved to offices in Armley.

The Forensic Science Service had a laboratory in Wetherby on Sandbeck Way. This closed in 2012 and has been demolished, with a new housing estate built on the site. HM Prison Wetherby is located on York Road.

On 1 October 2008, the healthcare centre on Hallfield Lane was opened by Colin Burgon, the Labour Member of Parliament (MP) for Elmet. It was completed in May 2008 and services have been provided from the building since June 2008. The centre has a range of services including podiatry, physiotherapy and a baby clinic.

== Housing ==

In 1914, 100 dwellings in Wetherby were considered unfit for habitation. This, and previous reports under the Housing and Town Planning Act 1909, led to the building of many villas. There are many surviving examples of these, such as Park Villas, York Place, Grosvenor Terrace and Sandringham Terrace. Landlords found these hard to let due to exorbitant rents and many remained empty for years. This also led to the demolition of the town&#x27;s Bishopgate area. In 1910, the parish council started a programme to install street lighting in the hope of bettering the standard of living and reducing crime.

It was not until the post-war years that large housing estates appeared throughout Wetherby. From the 1940s until the 1980s, many large estates were built from scratch. Both the local corporation and the private sector built many houses to satisfy the huge demand for homes in Wetherby. Developer Norman Ashton&#x27;s company, Ashtons, were responsible for much of the housing in Wetherby, particularly around the Ainsty Estate, Hall Orchards and Templar Gardens areas. Most housing in the town is from these years. There is a wide variety of housing types in Wetherby, including waterside penthouses, council flats and maisonettes, large detached houses, small terraces and probably the most common, the three bedroomed twentieth century semi-detached home.

==Transport==
===Roads===
For many years from 1959, the town&#x27;s bypass started at a roundabout near a Forte Group Posthouse hotel until July 1988 when the A1 was diverted at a cost of £11.5 million. On 18 December 2004, the northern section of the bypass was diverted to a new section of the A1(M), around Kirk Deighton, after construction work had begun in August 2003. The upgrade of the section between Bramham and Wetherby started in July 2007 and was completed in 2009.

The upgrading of the A1 included the construction of Wetherby Services at the Wetherby North Junction. The upgrading of the A1(M) in Wetherby was the final development after 50 years of gradual improvement to motorway standard. A new road links all routes in and out of the town with the A1(M).

The racecourse has three stands, one constructed in the 1930s with football-style terracing, a two-tier seated stand constructed in the 1970s and the new Millennium Stand which opened in 1999 providing executive facilities.

<text>Mark Robert Bailey (born 13 January 1965), known professionally as Bill Bailey, is an English musician, comedian, actor and television presenter. He is known for his role as Manny in the sitcom &quot;Black Books&quot; and for his regular appearances on the panel shows &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot;, &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;, and &quot;QI&quot;, as well as for his stand-up comedy work. He plays a variety of musical instruments and incorporates music into his performances.

Bailey was listed by &quot;The Observer&quot; as one of the 50 funniest acts in British comedy in 2003. In 2007, and again in 2010, he was voted the seventh greatest stand-up comic on Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Stand-Ups&quot;. 
Bill Bailey made an appearance in the film &quot;Hot Fuzz&quot;. In 2020, Bailey won the 18th series of the televised BBC dancing competition &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; with his professional partner Oti Mabuse. At 55, he is the oldest winner in the show&#x27;s history . 
Bill is a cancer fundraiser and has walked 100 miles for cancer fundraising in honour of his mum, who passed away in 2005, as well as raising awareness for prostate cancer through television, print, and digital ads.
Bill Bailey was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Bath on 11 July 2018. Bill Bailey has recently become a patron of the Musical Comedy Awards and has written works such as &quot;Bill Bailey&#x27;s Remarkable Guide to British Birds&quot;,
&quot;Bill Bailey&#x27;s Remarkable Guide to Happiness&quot;, and &quot;My Animals, and Other Animals&quot;, a memoir of sorts. He has established his own webpage and offers a shop where you will find a list of his musical accomplishments since 1995.

==Early life==
Mark Robert Bailey was born on 13 January 1965 in Bath, Somerset, son of Christopher and Madryn Bailey. His father was an NHS general practitioner &quot;who ran a little surgery in the front of the house&quot;, and his mother a hospital ward nurse. Until 2018, when he revealed the correct date, his birthday was wrongly recorded by the media as 24 February. He spent most of his childhood in Keynsham, a town between Bath and Bristol. His maternal grandparents lived in an annexe built on the side of the house by his maternal grandfather, who was a stonemason and builder. Two rooms at the front of the family house were for his father&#x27;s surgery.

Bailey was educated at King Edward&#x27;s School, an independent school in Bath, where he was initially a highly academic pupil. At about the age of 15, he started to become distracted from school work when he realised the thrill of performance as a member of a school band called Behind Closed Doors, which played mostly original work. He is a classically trained musician and was the only pupil at his school to study A-level music, which he passed with an A grade. He also states he was good at sport and was the captain of the KES 2nd XI cricket team in 1982, which often surprised his teachers. He would often combine music and sport by leading the singing on the long coach trip back from away rugby fixtures. It was here that he was given the nickname Bill by his music teacher for being able to play the song &quot;Won&#x27;t You Come Home Bill Bailey&quot; so well on the guitar.

Bailey started studies for an English degree at Westfield College of the University of London, but left after a year. He received an Associate Diploma from the London College of Music. He was also made an honorary member of the Society of Crematorium Organists. He performed with a boy band called The Famous Five. Acting roles included a part in a Workers&#x27; Revolutionary Party stage production called &quot;The Printers&quot; with Vanessa Redgrave and Frances de la Tour.

==Career==

===Early stand-up===
Bailey began touring the country with comedians such as Mark Lamarr. In 1984, he formed a double act, the Rubber Bishops, with Toby Longworth (a fellow former pupil at King Edward&#x27;s, Bath). It was there that Bailey began developing his own style, mixing in musical parodies with deconstructions of or variations on traditional jokes (&quot;How many amoebas does it take to change a lightbulb? One, no two! No four! No eight...&quot;). Longworth left to join the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) in 1989 and was replaced by Martin Stubbs.

Stubbs later quit to pursue a more serious career, and in 1994 Bailey performed &quot;Rock&quot; at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe with Sean Lock, a show about an ageing rockstar and his roadie, script-edited by comedy writer Jim Miller. It was later serialised for the Mark Radcliffe show on BBC Radio 1. The show&#x27;s attendances were not impressive and on one occasion the only person in the audience was comedian Dominic Holland. Bailey almost gave up comedy to take up a telesales job.

He went solo the next year with the one-man show &quot;Bill Bailey&#x27;s Cosmic Jam&quot;. The show led to a recording at the Bloomsbury Theatre in London, which was broadcast in 1997 on Channel 4 as a one-hour special called &quot;Bill Bailey Live&quot;. It was not until 2005 that this was released on DVD uncut and under its original title. It marked the first time that Bailey had been able to tie together his music and post-modern gags with the whimsical rambling style he is now known for.

After supporting Donna McPhail in 1995 and winning a &quot;Time Out&quot; award, he returned to Edinburgh in 1996 with a show that was nominated for the Perrier Comedy Award. Amongst the other nominees was future &quot;Black Books&quot; co-star Dylan Moran, who narrowly beat him in the closest vote in the award&#x27;s history.

Bailey won the Best Live Stand-Up award at the British Comedy Awards in 1999.

===Television===
Although he did not win the Perrier Comedy Awards in 1996, the nomination was enough to get him noticed. In 1998, the BBC gave him his own television show, &quot;Is It Bill Bailey?&quot;. Bailey&#x27;s television debut had been on the children&#x27;s show &quot;Motormouth&quot; in the late 1980s – playing piano for a mind-reading dog. Bailey reminisced about the experience on the BBC show &quot;Room 101&quot; with Paul Merton in 2000. In 1991, he was appearing in stand-up shows such as &quot;The Happening&quot;, &quot;Packing Them In&quot;, &quot;The Stand Up Show&quot; and &quot;The Comedy Store&quot;. He also appeared as captain on two panel games, an ITV music quiz pilot called &quot;Pop Dogs&quot;, and the Channel 4 science fiction quiz show &quot;Space Cadets&quot;. &quot;Is it Bill Bailey?&quot; was the first time he had written and presented his own show.

Over the next few years, Bailey made guest appearances on shows such as &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;, &quot;World Cup Comedy&quot;, &quot;Room 101&quot;, &quot;Des O&#x27;Connor Tonight&quot;, &quot;Coast to Coast&quot; and three episodes of off-beat Channel 4 sitcom &quot;Spaced&quot;, in which he played comic-shop manager Bilbo Bagshot. In 1998, Dylan Moran approached him with the pilot script for &quot;Black Books&quot;, a Channel 4 sitcom about a cold-hearted bookshop owner, his nice-guy assistant, and their socially awkward female friend. It was commissioned in 2000, and Bailey took the part of the assistant Manny Bianco, with Moran playing the owner Bernard and Tamsin Greig the friend, Fran. Three series of six episodes each were made.

When Sean Hughes left his long-term role as a team captain on &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot; in 2002, Bailey became his successor. Host Mark Lamarr continually teased him about his looks and his pre-occupation with woodland animals. On 18 September 2008, it was announced that Bailey would leave the series and be replaced by a series of guest captains including Jack Dee and Dermot O&#x27;Leary. While touring in 2009, Bailey joked that the main reason for leaving the show was a lack of desire to continue humming Britney Spears&#x27; &quot;Toxic&quot; to little known figures in the indie music scene. During this time he also left his position as &quot;curator&quot; of &quot;the Museum of Curiosity&quot;, and declared his intention to &quot;retire&quot; from panel games, although he has since appeared on &quot;QI&quot; many more times and hosted &quot;Have I Got News For You&quot;.

Bailey has appeared frequently on the intellectual panel game &quot;QI&quot; since it began in 2003, alongside host Stephen Fry and regular panellist Alan Davies; he was the winner of the show&#x27;s unaired pilot episode. Other television appearances include a cameo role in Alan Davies&#x27; drama series &quot;Jonathan Creek&quot; as failing street magician Kenny Starkiss and obsessed guitar teacher in the &quot;Holiday&quot; episode of Sean Lock&#x27;s &quot;Fifteen Storeys High&quot;. He later appeared with Lock again as a guest on his show &quot;TV Heaven, Telly Hell&quot;. He appeared twice on &quot;Friday Night with Jonathan Ross&quot;. Bailey also hosted his own show &quot;Comic&#x27;s Choice&quot;, which aired in 2011.

Bailey presented &quot;Wild Thing I Love You&quot;, which began on Channel 4 on 15 October 2006. The series concentrates on the protection of Britain&#x27;s wild animals, and has included re-homing badgers, owls and water voles.

Bailey appeared in the second series of the E4 teenage &quot;dramedy&quot; &quot;Skins&quot; playing Maxxie&#x27;s dad, Walter Oliver. In episode 1, Walter struggles with his son&#x27;s desire to be a dancer, instead wishing him to become a builder, which is what he himself does for a living. Walter is married to Jackie, played by Fiona Allen.

Bailey appeared on the first episode of &quot;Grand Designs Live&quot; on 4 May 2008, helping Kevin McCloud build his eco-friendly home. In 2009, Bailey appeared in the BBC show &quot;Hustle&quot; as the character &quot;Cyclops&quot;, a side-line character. In autumn 2009, Bailey presented &quot;Bill Bailey&#x27;s Birdwatching Bonanza&quot;.

Continuing his foray into natural history, Bailey presented ITV1&#x27;s half-hour wildlife mini-series &quot;Baboons With Bill Bailey&quot;. The series was filmed in Cape Town and spanned eight episodes, with exclusive content available on itvWILD.

Bill Bailey played Droxil, a Harvest Ranger from the Planet Androzani Major, in the 2011 Christmas Special of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, titled &quot;The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe&quot;.

In 2009, Bailey presented a project about the explorer and naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace, in the form of an Indonesian travelogue. Bailey said in an interview that Wallace had been &quot;airbrushed out of history&quot;, and that he felt a &quot;real affinity&quot; with him. In 2013, to coincide with the centenary of Wallace&#x27;s death, Bailey presented a two-part documentary, &quot;Bill Bailey&#x27;s Jungle Hero&quot;, first broadcast on BBC Two on 21 and 28 April 2013. He travelled around producing and filming the series in Indonesia and Borneo.

Bailey took part in the eighteenth series of the televised dancing competition &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;, broadcast in late 2020. He won the competition with his partner, Oti Mabuse, becoming the show&#x27;s oldest winner at 55, displacing the previous oldest winner Joe McFadden. Their win made Mabuse the first dancer to receive the title two years in a row.

Bailey voiced Grandfather Smed in the 2022 short film &quot;The Smeds and the Smoos&quot;. 

===International tours===
In 2001, Bailey began touring the globe with &quot;Bewilderness&quot;. A recording of a performance in Swansea was released on DVD the same year, and the show was broadcast on Channel 4 that Christmas. A modified version of it also proved successful in America, and in 2002 Bailey released a CD of a recording at the WestBeth Theatre in New York City. The show contained his popular music parodies (such as Unisex Chip Shop, a Billy Bragg tribute, which he also performed with Bragg himself at the 2005 Glastonbury Festival), &quot;three men in a pub&quot; jokes (including one in the style of Geoffrey Chaucer) and deconstructions of television themes such as &quot;Countdown&quot; and &quot;The Magic Roundabout&quot;. A &quot;Bewilderness&quot; CD was sold outside gigs, a mixture of studio recordings of songs and monologues Bailey had performed in the past; it was later released in shops as &quot;Bill Bailey: The Ultimate Collection... Ever!&quot; That same year he also presented a Channel 4 countdown, &quot;Top Ten Prog Rock&quot;.

Bailey premiered his show &quot;Part Troll&quot; at the 2003 Edinburgh Festival Fringe. A critical and commercial success, he then transferred it to the West End, where tickets sold out in under 24 hours, and new dates had to be added. He continued to tour it all over the UK as well as in Australia, New Zealand and the US. Bailey expanded on subjects such as the war on Iraq. He also talks extensively about drugs, at one point asking the audience to name different ways of baking cannabis. A DVD was released in 2004.His 1995 show &quot;Bill Bailey&#x27;s Cosmic Jam&quot;. was released in 2005. The two-disc set also contained a director&#x27;s cut of &quot;Bewilderness&quot;, which featured a routine on Stephen Hawking&#x27;s &quot;A Brief History of Time&quot; not seen in the original version.

Bailey performed a show at the 2006 Edinburgh Festival Fringe entitled &quot;Steampunk&quot;.

Bailey appeared at the Beautiful Days festival in August 2007. The UK leg of the &quot;Tinselworm&quot; tour enjoyed three sell-out nights at the MEN Arena in Manchester, Europe&#x27;s largest indoor arena, and culminated with a sell-out performance at Wembley Arena.

Early in 2007, a petition was started to express fans&#x27; wishes to see him cast as a dwarf in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; films, after his stand-up routine mentioned auditioning for Gimli in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. The petition reached its goal in the early days of January, and was sent to the producers. It was hoped that as the &quot;Tinselworm&quot; tour took him to Wellington where the film was in pre-production, he would be able to audition.

&quot;Dandelion Mind&quot; was released on DVD on 22 November 2010.

In 2012, his world tour entitled &quot;Qualmpeddler&quot; toured the UK as well as returning to Australia and New Zealand in August and September 2012.

In September and October 2018, Bailey toured his show, &quot;The Earl of Whimsy&quot;, to seven venues within New Zealand.

In December 2021, Bailey started touring his new show, &quot;En Route To Normal&quot;, to venues in the United Kingdom and Ireland. In 2022 Bailey took the tour to venues in Europe, and in October to Australia.

===Music===

Bailey plays numerous musical instruments, and incorporates music into his comedy. He has perfect pitch. His stand-up routines often feature music 
from genres such as jazz, rock (most notably prog rock from the early 1970s), drum&#x27;n&#x27;bass, classical, and even theme songs, usually for comic value. Favourite instruments include the keyboard, guitar, theremin, kazoo and bongos. He also mentioned in an interview that he has achieved Grade 6 Clarinet. He was part of punk band Beergut 100, which he founded in 1995 with comedy writer Jim Miller and also featured Martin Trenaman and Phil Whelans, with Kevin Eldon as lead singer. The band performed at the 2006 Edinburgh Festival Fringe. His musical routines include performing &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; in a minor key and performing the Hokey Cokey in the style of the electronic band Kraftwerk.

In February 2007, Bailey appeared twice with the BBC Concert Orchestra and Anne Dudley in a show entitled &quot;Cosmic Shindig&quot;. Performed in the Colosseum in Watford on 24 February and in the Queen Elizabeth Hall on 26 February, the show contained orchestrally accompanied versions of many of Bailey&#x27;s previously performed songs, an exploration of the instruments of the orchestra and a number of new pieces of music. The Queen Elizabeth Hall performance was broadcast on BBC Radio 3 on 16 March 2007 as a part of Comic Relief 2007.

Bailey had planned to put himself forward as Britain&#x27;s Eurovision entry in 2008, as a result of several fan petitions encouraging him to do so.

In October 2008, he performed &quot;Bill Bailey&#x27;s Remarkable Guide to the Orchestra&quot; at the Royal Albert Hall with the BBC Concert Orchestra, conducted by Anne Dudley.

In November 2009, he was a guest on &quot;Private Passions&quot;, the biographical music discussion programme on BBC Radio 3.

In July 2011, Bailey performed at the Sonisphere Festival in Knebworth, headlining the Saturn Stage. He released an album, &quot;In Metal&quot;, using songs played at Sonisphere, later that year.

In June 2014, The Music House for Children announced Bailey would become their patron alongside Sophie Ellis-Bextor in celebration of their 20th anniversary.

==Personal life==
Bailey lives in the Hammersmith area of London with his wife Kristin, whom he married in 1998, on a whim, in Indonesia. In 2009, he said: &quot;We were travelling around Asia and sailed into a place called Banda, with a beautiful lagoon, and a smoking volcano on one side and a Dutch colonial fort, an old church and remains of a little town on the other. We decided to get married there and then.&quot; Their son Dax was born in 2003.

Bailey supports Queens Park Rangers and describes himself as an avid fan of &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

He has a carnivorous pitcher plant named after him, &quot;Nepenthes x Bill Bailey&quot;, created by Borneo Exotics in Sri Lanka. His sporting interests include standup paddleboarding (SUP). He is an active supporter of British Canoeing.

==Political views and activism==
Bailey is a lifelong supporter of the Labour Party and appeared in its fifth party election broadcast of the 2010 general election campaign. In 2015, he endorsed Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s campaign in the Labour Party leadership election, saying, &quot;Corbyn&#x27;s nomination showed there is a kind of craving for a bit of honest speaking, a bit of principled plain speaking. But I think he is in a bit of a bind. Nuanced debate doesn&#x27;t cut it in the toxic, political atmosphere. He’s having a fast-forward of his own political evolution, having to become &#x27;a politician&#x27; – the thing he never was.&quot;

Bailey is a feminist and a supporter of the Fawcett Society. He is also a prominent advocate of men&#x27;s issues, most notably raising awareness of prostate cancer and the Men United campaign. He is a patron of International Animal Rescue and has been instrumental in the organisation&#x27;s campaign to rescue dancing bears. He has also campaigned for the Sumatran Orangutan Society. For his work in environmental conservation, he received an honorary doctorate in conservation and sustainability from the Australian University of the Sunshine Coast in October 2014.

<text>Whitkirk is a suburb of east Leeds, England. It is situated between Cross Gates to the north, Austhorpe to the east, Killingbeck to the west, Colton to the south-east and Halton to the south-west. The Temple Newsam estate lies directly south of the area.

It falls into the Temple Newsam ward of Leeds City Council and Leeds East parliamentary constituency.

==History==
A church is recorded in the Domesday Survey (1086) as belonging to the manor of Gipton and Colton, and as Whitkirk is the only known medieval church in these area of Leeds, it is reasonable to assume that it is an earlier building replaced by the current Whitkirk church which is being referred to. This would suggest there was a late Anglo-Saxon church at least. The first mention of Whitkirk itself was in 1154–66, in the Early Yorkshire Charters referring to &quot;Witechirche&quot;, meaning &quot;white church&quot;. The name has Old English origins, with the ‘chirche’ element subsequently being replaced by the Old Norse ‘kirkja’. It is possible that the church was the focus of settlement activity at this period extending into the later medieval era.

Hollyshaw Lane, which links Whitkirk with Cross Gates, was formerly known as &quot;Allershaw&quot;, referring to local alder trees (cf. the derivation of the name of Chapel Allerton, another Leeds suburb). The lane originally led northwards from Whitkirk to Seacroft.

The renowned civil engineer John Smeaton was born in the local parish of Austhorpe and is buried in Whitkirk churchyard.

==Information==

Whitkirk is 4 miles east of Leeds city centre, and about 1 mile from Cross Gates Railway Station, which has services to Leeds City station and York railway station, and is close to the A63 dual carriageway and M1 motorway, meaning it is an ideal location for commuters. The area is well served by regular buses. The area has a cricket club which has a large cricket pitch, five tennis courts, a football pitch and a crown green bowling green, along with a large bar area. Housing in Whitkirk ranges from detached houses, semi-detached houses and terraced houses. It is also home to a Premier Inn, directly next to the Brown Cow public house, a gym, a Co-op, a carpet shop, an undertaker and an estate agent. The Temple Newsam War Memorial can be found a few hundred yards along Selby Road towards Halton.

==Education==
Whitkirk has three schools: Whitkirk Primary School, Temple Newsam Halton Primary School, and Temple Moor High School. The former Darcy hospital school was located on Hollyshaw Lane.

==Comparison==

Whitkirk lies within the LS15 postcode area. Here is a population breakdown of the postcode area in comparison with the UK population.

<doc id="151582" wikidata="Q7027243" url="?curid=151582" title="Nick Hancock">
<text>Nicholas John Hancock (born 25 October 1962) is an English actor and television presenter. He hosted the sports quiz &quot;They Think It&#x27;s All Over&quot; for 10 years. He also formerly presented &quot;Room 101&quot; (1994–1999) on TV, as well as its earlier radio version (1992–1994).

==Early life==
Hancock grew up with three elder sisters and his father Ken. He was educated at Yarlet School in Staffordshire and later Shrewsbury School. He was awarded a third-class degree in education by Homerton College, Cambridge. While he was at Cambridge Hancock was a member of the Footlights, where he first collaborated with Hugh Dennis and Steve Punt, and became president in 1983, with Punt as vice president. He was also a founding member of the Homerton College Blaggards.

After graduating Hancock became a PE teacher and practised stand-up comedy as a hobby. He formed a double act with Neil Mullarkey, another former member of the Footlights, and they mostly did satirical spoofs of the title sequences of television shows to accompanying music, several times on television, including on &quot;After Ten with Tarbuck&quot; in 1988. The shows included &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, &quot;Kojak&quot;, and &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;. One of Hancock&#x27;s earliest TV breaks was presenting &quot;La Triviatta&quot;, a comedy/chat show about trivia for the short-lived station British Satellite Broadcasting.

Hancock appeared in an advertisement for Datapost in 1988, and in a series of advertisements for Randall&#x27;s beer in 1990. They were shown only in Jersey, but were later lampooned by Angus Deayton in his TV show &quot;Before They Were Famous&quot;.

==Career==
Hancock appeared in two episodes of &quot;Mr. Bean&quot;, first as a thief who stole Mr. Bean&#x27;s camera, and later as a ticket inspector on a train. His early television credits also include &quot;Me, You and Him&quot; and &quot;The Mary Whitehouse Experience&quot;.

Hancock&#x27;s comedy idol is Peter Cook and he got the chance to meet him when Cook appeared on &quot;Room 101&quot;. Hancock enjoyed hosting &quot;They Think It&#x27;s All Over&quot;, especially when guests got in hot water: &quot;Chris Eubank was slagging off Kiwi rugby star Jonah Lomu, who&#x27;s 6 ft 5 in and about 18½ stone. I knew Jonah was backstage, about to come on for our &#x27;feel the sportsman&#x27; round. It was a very pleasing moment!&quot;

In 1998 Hancock starred (alongside Andy Smart) in a documentary/comedy about the Iranian national football team, &quot;The Outsiders&quot;. In 1999 he also appeared in &quot;Great Railway Journeys of the World&quot;, travelling from Guantanamo to Pinar del Rio.

In 1998 Hancock also provided the narration for a six-part BBC documentary &quot;Pleasure Beach&quot;, following the running of the Blackpool amusement park.

After passing on the host&#x27;s duties for both &quot;Room 101&quot; and &quot;They Think It&#x27;s All Over&quot;, Hancock took a sabbatical to spend more time with his family. He has made one-off appearances, including on Red Nose Day&#x27;s &quot;The Ultimate Makeover&quot;, in which Hancock, Anna Ryder Richardson, Phil Tufnell and TV gardener Joe Swift transformed a Liverpool play centre for children whose parents could not afford child-care.

In 2006 Hancock appeared on &quot;TV Heaven, Telly Hell&quot;, discussing his TV likes and dislikes, with Trinny and Susannah being his number one hate.

Hancock filmed a series for STV and Discovery Real Time called &quot;Nick Hancock&#x27;s Fishing School&quot;, where he teaches a number of students the art of fly fishing. The show, made by SMG Productions, began broadcasting in January 2007.

In 2007 he presented a new game show called &quot;Win My Wage&quot; for Channel 4. The show aired in &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot;&#x27;s usual slot during the latter&#x27;s summer break.

In 2007 it was announced that Hancock would host a new show on ITV1 in 2008 called &quot;Duel&quot;. The show was not recommissioned after its initial run.

In 2009 he became the host of a daytime cookery competition series, &quot;Taste the Nation&quot;, on ITV1.

In 2010 he stood in for Danny Baker and Colin Murray on the radio.

He appeared in a celebrity special edition of the ITV1 gameshow &quot;The Chase&quot; in 2011.

In 2011 he was asked by BBC America to join the panel of the NPR quiz show &quot;Wait Wait... Don&#x27;t Tell Me!&quot; for a year-end special, &quot;A Royal Pain in the News&quot;. Hancock won the game.

In 2012 he became the host of a new BBC Two show, &quot;Breakaway&quot;, which began on 12 March.

In June 2015 Hancock guest-hosted the breakfast show for Stoke-on-Trent radio station Signal 1.

In October 2021 he competed on Scott Mills and Chris Stark&#x27;s &quot;Upside Down Quiz&quot; on their Weekend Show for BBC Radio 5. Hancock&#x27;s podcast, &quot;The Famous Sloping Pitch&quot; is hosted on Apple.

In December 2022, Hancock&#x27;s barn conversion home and contents, featured in season 2/episode 4 of &quot;Celebrity Yorkshire Auction House&quot;, he submitted 15 quirky items to auction, including a club fender that made £400 and a retro lava lamp, which went for £30. In total, 14 items sold, raising £1,123, the unsold item, a cherished oil painting, returned home with him.

In April 2023 he appeared as a fictionalised version of himself in an episode of series 4 of &quot;Meet the Richardsons&quot;, having been tracked down by Jon Richardson to discuss life after showbusiness.

==Personal life==
Hancock met his wife, Iranian-born Shari Eftekhari, during a George Best and Rodney Marsh football roadshow in Staines, Surrey. Hancock proposed to Shari in a pub: &quot;We were playing pool in the Nellie Dean. I said to Shari: &#x27;Have I got something stuck between my teeth?&#x27; As she looked I stuck out my tongue – there was an engagement ring on it. She said: &#x27;That&#x27;s lovely, yes, I will – but can we change the ring?&quot; The couple married in Staffordshire in 1997, two years after they first met, and have two children.

Hancock is a lifelong supporter of Stoke City. In September 2001, he paid £20,000 at Sotheby&#x27;s Football Memorabilia auction in London for the FA Cup winner&#x27;s medal awarded to Sir Stanley Matthews in 1953. Hancock sold the medal in November 2014 for £220,000. In 2007, he made an appearance on an edition of &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot; recorded in Stoke-on-Trent, talking about some of the items in his collection of football memorabilia. He is also a cricket fan. He was interviewed by 6 Towns Radio about the 40th anniversary of Stoke&#x27;s 1972 League Cup win.

He lives with his wife and their two children in Shrewsbury.

<text>Patrick Rory McGrath (born 17 March 1956) is a British comedian, television personality, and writer. He came to prominence in the comedy show &quot;Who Dares Wins&quot; and was a regular panellist on the game show &quot;They Think It&#x27;s All Over&quot; for many years. He acted in the sitcom &quot;Chelmsford 123&quot; and appeared in the ITV reality show &quot;Sugar Free Farm&quot;.

==Early life==
McGrath was born in Redruth, Cornwall, England. He studied at Redruth Grammar School and Emmanuel College, Cambridge, from which he received a lower second class degree in modern languages.

==Career==
McGrath became a member of the Footlights while at Cambridge and met Jimmy Mulville, with whom he wrote and performed. After university, they wrote BBC radio scripts for Frankie Howerd and Windsor Davies. McGrath also co-wrote &quot;Black Cinderella Two Goes East&quot; with Clive Anderson for BBC Radio 2 in 1978. McGrath and Mulville went on to write for shows such as &quot;Not the Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot; and &quot;Alas Smith and Jones&quot;, and they were part of the team of writer/performers behind &quot;Injury Time&quot; (1980–1982), and the Channel 4 comedy sketch series &quot;Who Dares Wins&quot;. In 1981 McGrath wrote and performed in the radio show Glompus Van De Hloed&#x27;s Tales From The Crypt alongside Andrew Sachs, Chrissy Roberts, Griff Rhys Jones and Mel Smith, from which an album was produced.

In 1986, McGrath, with Jimmy Mulville and Denise O&#x27;Donoghue, co-founded the independent British TV production company Hat Trick Productions. An early production was &quot;Chelmsford 123&quot; (1988 and 1990), which McGrath and Mulville wrote and performed. In 1990, he hosted the game show &quot;Trivial Pursuit&quot; on BBC One, but in 1992 he was dismissed from Hat Trick. The confrontation came days after McGrath had left his wife and two young children. He was a panel member on the BBC comedy sports quiz &quot;They Think It&#x27;s All Over&quot; (1995–2006). He was presenter of the series &quot;Rory&#x27;s Commercial Breakdown&quot; (1997), where humorous adverts were shown from different countries. He has made two football DVDs, &quot;Own Goals and Gaffs – The Premiership&quot; in 2002 and &quot;More Own Goals and Gaffs&quot; in 2003. McGrath also appeared in an episode of the Sooty Show (Time Capsule), as a scuba diver who appeared from anywhere to stop Matthew Corbett and Sooty from burying their time capsule.

From 2006 to 2011, McGrath starred in the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Three Men in a Boat&quot; series, alongside Dara Ó Briain and Griff Rhys Jones. The series has included the trio rowing up the River Thames (similar to the eponymous 1889 novel &quot;Three Men in a Boat&quot; by Jerome K. Jerome), sailing from London to the Isle of Wight for a sailing yacht race, borrowing numerous vessels to make their way from Plymouth to the Isles of Scilly, taking to the Irish canals and rivers along with Ó Briain&#x27;s dog (Snip Nua), travelling in the Mediterranean to Venice and attempting to find a boat to take to the anniversary of the Statue of Liberty, where in response to a challenge between Ó Briain and Rhys Jones (who had each secured a boat and refused to give it up to use the other&#x27;s), he secured permission to use the Nantucket Lightship. He also hosted Industrial Revelations: Best of British Engineering, series 5, first broadcast in 2008.

His first book, &quot;Bearded Tit – Confessions of a Birdwatcher&quot;, was published by Ebury Press on 1 May 2008 and was serialised by BBC Radio 4.

First airing in August 2008, McGrath co-starred in a four-part television series with British comedian Paddy McGuinness, broadcast on Channel 5, &quot;Rory and Paddy&#x27;s Great British Adventure&quot;. In the series McGuinness and McGrath embarked on a nationwide road-trip, &quot;on a mission to explore Britain&#x27;s sporting heritage by probing the hidden life of its towns and villages&quot;. The series documented numerous arcane sports such as cheese rolling, toe wrestling and swamp soccer. In 2011, McGrath presented &quot;Pub Dig&quot; for History. He presented two series of &quot;The Lakes&quot; for ITV and in 2016, he took part in ITV&#x27;s &quot;Sugar Free Farm&quot; which saw him go sugar free for two weeks.

==Personal life==
McGrath is married to Nicola. They met at Cambridge, but married other people. After both their marriages ended, she contacted him and they restarted their relationship in 1995.

McGrath supports Arsenal, Celtic and Plymouth Argyle. He and Peter Cook (a Tottenham supporter) used to have a friendly rivalry over their respective clubs. On the night that Cook died in January 1995, Tottenham had beaten Arsenal. McGrath found out about his friend&#x27;s death after failing to receive Cook&#x27;s usual abusive phonecall the next morning. McGrath is a friend and fan of Ralph McTell. He contributed sleeve notes to &quot;Affairs of the Heart&quot;, a McTell compilation album.

==Criminal record==

In May 2013, McGrath assaulted two people whilst intoxicated, leaving one person with a bloody nose and scratches. He received a caution.

In January 2017, McGrath was sentenced to 10 weeks in jail, suspended for 18 months, for harassing a former lover.

<text>John Smeaton (8 June 1724 – 28 October 1792) was an English civil engineer responsible for the design of bridges, canals, harbours and lighthouses. He was also a capable mechanical engineer and an eminent physicist. Smeaton was the first self-proclaimed &quot;civil engineer&quot;, and is often regarded as the &quot;father of civil engineering&quot;. He pioneered the use of hydraulic lime in concrete, using pebbles and powdered brick as aggregate. Smeaton was associated with the Lunar Society.

==Law and physics==
Smeaton was born in Austhorpe, Leeds, England. After studying at Leeds Grammar School he joined his father&#x27;s law firm, but left to become a mathematical instrument maker (working with Henry Hindley), developing, among other instruments, a pyrometer to study material expansion. In 1750, his premises were in the Great Turnstile in Holborn.

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1753 and in 1759 won the Copley Medal for his research into the mechanics of waterwheels and windmills. His 1759 paper &quot;An Experimental Enquiry Concerning the Natural Powers of Water and Wind to Turn Mills and Other Machines Depending on Circular Motion&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Phil. Trans. 1759 51:100-174; doi:10.1098/rstl.1759.0019&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; addressed the relationship between pressure and velocity for objects moving in air (Smeaton noted that the table doing so was actually contributed by &quot;my friend Mr Rouse&quot; &quot;an ingenious gentleman of Harborough, Leicestershire&quot; and calculated on the basis of Rouse&#x27;s experiments), and his concepts were subsequently developed to devise the &#x27;Smeaton Coefficient&#x27;. Smeaton&#x27;s water wheel experiments were conducted on a small scale model with which he tested various configurations over a period of seven years. The resultant increase in efficiency in water power contributed to the Industrial Revolution.

Over the period 1759–1782 he performed a series of further experiments and measurements on water wheels that led him to support and champion the &quot;vis viva&quot; theory of German Gottfried Leibniz, an early formulation of conservation of energy. This led him into conflict with members of the academic establishment who rejected Leibniz&#x27;s theory, believing it inconsistent with Sir Isaac Newton&#x27;s conservation of momentum.

==Smeaton coefficient==
In his 1759 paper &quot;An Experimental Enquiry Concerning the Natural Powers of Water and Wind to Turn Mills and Other Machines Depending on Circular Motion&quot; Smeaton developed the concepts and data which became the basis for the &quot;Smeaton coefficient&quot;, the lift equation used by the Wright brothers. It has the form:

:formula_1

where:
:formula_2 is the lift
:formula_3 is the Smeaton coefficient (see note below)
:formula_4 is the velocity
:formula_5 is the area in square feet
:formula_6 is the lift coefficient (the lift relative to the drag of a plate of the same area)

The Wright brothers determined with wind tunnels that the Smeaton coefficient value of 0.005 was incorrect and should have been 0.0033. In modern analysis, the lift coefficient is normalised by the dynamic pressure instead of the Smeaton coefficient.

==Civil engineering==

Smeaton is important in the history, rediscovery of, and development of modern cement, identifying the compositional requirements needed to obtain &quot;hydraulicity&quot; in lime; work which led ultimately to the invention of Portland cement. Portland cement led to the re-emergence of concrete as a modern building material, largely due to Smeaton&#x27;s influence.

Recommended by the Royal Society, Smeaton designed the third Eddystone Lighthouse (1755–59). He pioneered the use of &#x27;hydraulic lime&#x27; (a form of mortar that will set under water) and developed a technique involving dovetailed blocks of granite in the building of the lighthouse. 

His lighthouse remained in use until 1877 when the rock underlying the structure&#x27;s foundations had begun to erode; it was dismantled and partially rebuilt at Plymouth Hoe where it is known as Smeaton&#x27;s Tower. In 2020 a Cornish granite bust of Smeaton by Philip Chatfield, commissioned by The Box, Plymouth and funded by Trinity House, was installed in the tower&#x27;s lantern chamber before its reopening. The bust is based on a plaster one donated by the Institution of Civil Engineers in about 1980, but later removed for safety reasons.
Deciding that he wanted to focus on the lucrative field of civil engineering, he commenced an extensive series of commissions, including:
* the Calder and Hebble Navigation (1758–70)
* Coldstream Bridge over the River Tweed (1763–66)
* Improvements to the River Lee Navigation (1765–70)
* Smeaton&#x27;s Pier in St Ives, Cornwall (1767–70)
* Perth Bridge over the River Tay in Perth (1766–71)
* Ripon Canal (1766–1773)
* Smeaton&#x27;s Viaduct, which carries the A616 road (part of the original Great North Road) over the River Trent between Newark and South Muskham in Nottinghamshire (1768–70)
* the Forth and Clyde Canal from Grangemouth to Glasgow (1768–77)
* Langley on Tyne smelt mill, with Nicholas Walton, acting as receivers to the Greenwich Hospital, London (1768)
* Banff harbour (1770–75)
* Lower North Water Bridge (1770–75)
* Aberdeen bridge (1775–80)
* Peterhead harbour (1775–1881)
* Nent Force Level (1776–77)
* Cardington Bridge (1778)
* Harbour works at Ramsgate (retention basin 1776–83; jetty 1788–1792)
* Hexham Bridge (1777–90); completed by Robert Mylne in 1793
* the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal (1782–89)
*St Austell&#x27;s Charlestown harbour in Cornwall (1792)
Smeaton is considered to be the first expert witness to appear in an English court. Because of his expertise in engineering, he was called to testify in court for a case related to the silting-up of the harbour at Wells-next-the-Sea in Norfolk in 1782. He also acted as a consultant on the disastrous 63-year-long New Harbour at Rye, designed to combat the silting of the port of Winchelsea. The project is now known informally as &quot;Smeaton&#x27;s Harbour&quot;, but despite the name his involvement was limited and occurred more than 30 years after work on the harbour commenced. It closed in 1839.

==Mechanical engineer==
Employing his skills as a mechanical engineer, he devised a water engine for the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew in 1761 and a watermill at Alston, Cumbria in 1767 (he is credited by some with inventing the cast-iron axle shaft for water wheels). In 1782 he built the Chimney Mill at Spital Tongues in Newcastle upon Tyne, the first 5-sailed smock mill in Britain. He also improved Thomas Newcomen&#x27;s atmospheric engine, erecting one at Chacewater mine, Wheal Busy, in Cornwall in 1775 which was both highly efficient and the most powerful at the time.

In 1789 Smeaton applied an idea by Denis Papin, by using a force pump to maintain the pressure and fresh air inside a diving bell. This bell, built for the Hexham Bridge project, was not intended for underwater work, but in 1790 the design was updated to enable it to be used underwater on the breakwater at Ramsgate Harbour. Smeaton is also credited with explaining the fundamental differences and benefits of overshot versus undershot water wheels. Smeaton experimented with the Newcomen steam engine and made marked improvements around the time James Watt was building his first engines ().

==Legacy==

Smeaton died after suffering a stroke while walking in the garden of his family home at Austhorpe, and was buried in the parish church at Whitkirk, West Yorkshire. His surviving daughters erected a memorial to him and his wife which is on the chancel wall of the church.

Due to the decay of the rock beneath the Eddystone Lighthouse the structure needed to be replaced. When the upper section of Smeaton&#x27;s lighthouse (which included the lantern, store and living and watch room) was about to be removed, it was suggested that some of it be brought to Whitkirk and set up as a memorial to him. Unfortunately, the project was deemed too expensive as it was estimated that it would cost around £1800.

He is highly regarded by other engineers, having contributed to the Lunar Society and founded the Society of Civil Engineers in 1771. He coined the term &quot;civil engineers&quot; to distinguish them from military engineers graduating from the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich. The Society was a forerunner of the Institution of Civil Engineers, established in 1818, and was renamed the Smeatonian Society of Civil Engineers in 1830. His pupils included canal engineer William Jessop and architect and engineer Benjamin Latrobe.

The pioneering constant of proportionality describing pressure varying inversely as the square of the velocity when applied to objects moving in air was named &quot;Smeaton&#x27;s coefficient&quot; in his honour. Based on his concepts and data, it was used by the Wright brothers in their pursuit of the first successful heavier-than-air aircraft.

Between 1860 and 1894 the design of the reverse side of the old penny coin showed (behind Britannia) a depiction of Smeaton’s Eddystone lighthouse.

Smeaton is one of six civil engineers depicted in the Stephenson stained glass window, designed by William Wailes and unveiled in Westminster Abbey in 1862. A memorial stone commemorating Smeaton himself was unveiled in the Abbey on 7 November 1994, by Noel Ordman, President of the Smeatonian Society of Civil Engineers. 

John Smeaton Academy, a secondary school in the suburbs of Leeds adjacent to the Pendas Fields estate near Austhorpe, is named after Smeaton. He is also commemorated at the University of Plymouth, where the Mathematics and Technology Department is housed in a building named after him. A viaduct in the final stage of the Leeds Inner Ring Road, opened in 2008, was named after him.

Smeaton is mentioned in the song &quot;I Predict a Riot&quot; (as a symbol of a more dignified and peaceful epoch in Leeds history; and in reference to a Junior School House at Leeds Grammar School, which lead singer Ricky Wilson attended) by the indie rock band Kaiser Chiefs, who are natives of Leeds.

<doc id="151585" wikidata="Q40054" url="?curid=151585" title="Jonathan Ross">
<text>Jonathan Stephen Ross (born 17 November 1960) is an English broadcaster, film critic, comedian, actor, writer, and producer. He presented the BBC One chat show &quot;Friday Night with Jonathan Ross&quot; during the 2000s and early 2010s, hosted his own radio show on BBC Radio 2 from 1999 to 2010, and served as film critic and presenter of the &quot;Film&quot; programme. 

After leaving the BBC in 2010, Ross began hosting his comedy chat show &quot;The Jonathan Ross Show&quot; on ITV&quot;.&quot; Other regular roles have included being a panellist on the comedy sports quiz &quot;They Think It&#x27;s All Over&quot; (1999–2005), being a presenter of the British Comedy Awards (1991–2007, 2009–2014), and being a judge on the musical competition show &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; (2020–present) and its spin-off series &quot;The Masked Dancer&quot; (2021–2022).

Ross began his television career as a TV researcher, before débuting as a presenter for &quot;The Last Resort with Jonathan Ross&quot; on Channel 4 in 1987. Over the next decade, he presented numerous radio and television programmes, many through his own production company, Channel X. In 1995, he sold his stake in Channel X, and embarked on a career with the BBC in 1997. In 1999, Ross took over presenting the &quot;Film&quot; programme from Barry Norman, and also began presenting his own radio show, while two years later he began hosting &quot;Friday Night with Jonathan Ross&quot;. For the chat show, Ross won three British Academy Television Awards for Best Entertainment Performance, in 2004, 2006 and 2007. 

In 2005, Ross was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for services to broadcasting. Ross has been involved in controversies throughout his broadcasting career. As a result, in 2008, he wrote a semi-autobiographical work titled &quot;Why Do I Say These Things?&quot;, detailing some of his life experiences. He has also written his own comic books, &quot;Turf&quot; and &quot;America&#x27;s Got Powers&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Jonathan Stephen Ross was born on 17 November 1960 in St Pancras, north London and raised in Leytonstone, east London. The son of John and actress Martha Ross, he has four brothers and one sister. He is the younger brother of journalist, television editor, and media personality Paul Ross.

Their mother put all of her children forward for roles in television advertisements. Ross first appeared in a television advertisement for the breakfast cereal Kellogg&#x27;s Rice Krispies in 1970, when he was 10 years old. He also appeared in an ad for the laundry detergent Persil.

Ross was educated at the comprehensive schools Norlington School for Boys and Leyton County High School for Boys. He then studied at the Southampton College of Art and took a degree in Modern European History at the School of Slavonic and East European Studies (SSEES) in London, which today forms part of University College London.

Ross began his adult career as a researcher on the Channel 4 show &quot;Loose Talk&quot;. After leaving this, he worked on various other shows before beginning another research job on &quot;Soul Train&quot;, which became &quot;Solid Soul&quot;. It is believed his first appearance on television was as an extra in the 1981 &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Half Hot, Mum&quot; episode &quot;The Last Roll Call&quot;.

==Career==

===1987–95: Channel X===
Whilst on &quot;Solid Soul&quot;, he met fellow researcher Alan Marke, and the two devised what would prove to be a breakthrough hit for Ross in 1987, &quot;The Last Resort with Jonathan Ross&quot;.

The two men based their concept on the successful American show &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;, and formed a new production company called Channel X, to produce a pilot. Ross had not planned to be the show&#x27;s host, but he presented the show from its debut in January 1987.

While the series was initially a co-production with Colin Callender, ownership transferred to Marke and Ross, meaning that the latter retained a great deal of control as well as being presenter. The show was successful for both Ross and for Channel 4, making him one of the major personalities on the channel. A year later, his documentary series &quot;The Incredibly Strange Film Show&quot; introduced many to the works of cult filmmakers like Sam Raimi and Jackie Chan. Ross and Raimi appeared together in a British television advertisement for Raimi&#x27;s 1987 film &quot;Evil Dead II&quot;.

In 1990 and 1991, his television documentary series &quot;Jonathan Ross Presents for One Week Only&quot; profiled and interviewed directors including Alejandro Jodorowsky, David Lynch, Aki Kaurismäki and in 2014, the Spanish filmmaker Pedro Almodóvar.

In 1989, he co-presented the biennial BBC charity telethon &quot;Comic Relief&quot;, the same year he launched &quot;One Hour with Jonathan Ross&quot; a short lived chat show on Channel 4. Its game show segment, &quot;Knock down ginger&quot;, introduced comedians such as Vic Reeves, Bob Mortimer, Paul Whitehouse and Charlie Higson to television. In December 1989, Ross appeared on &quot;Cilla&#x27;s Goodbye to the 80s&quot; and presented all four members of Queen with the &quot;Top Band of the Eighties&quot; prize in a broadcast for ITV which would turn out to be Freddie Mercury&#x27;s penultimate public appearance before his death from AIDS in 1991.

Ross presented the annual &quot;British Comedy Awards&quot; each year from 1991 to 2014 with the exception of 2008 following his suspension from the BBC. In 1992 he presented an interview with Madonna about her &quot;Erotica&quot; album and &quot;Sex Book&quot; promotion.

Ross has appeared in numerous television entertainment programmes on several channels throughout the 1990s and 2000s. He was a regular panellist on the sports quiz &quot;They Think It&#x27;s All Over&quot;, and hosted the panel game &quot;It&#x27;s Only TV...But I Like It&quot;. Other projects include the BBC joke-quiz &quot;Gagtag&quot;, the Channel 4 variety show &quot;Saturday Zoo&quot;, new-acts showcase &quot;The Big Big Talent Show&quot;, and the ITV programme &quot;Fantastic Facts&quot;.

In 1995, he left Channel X, despite its profitable nature. He was quoted in a 1998 article as stating:
===1995–2006===
In 1995, he presented &quot;Mondo Rosso&quot;, a programme about old cult films. He took over presenting of the Film programme, the BBC&#x27;s long-running cinema review series, in 1999 after Barry Norman left the show. Ross himself has made a number of cameo appearances in films, playing himself in the Spice Girls&#x27; film &quot;Spice World&quot; (1997) and voicing the character of Doris in the UK version of &quot;Shrek 2&quot; (2004). In 2001 he also played himself in &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot;, presenting &quot;Goldrush&quot;, a fictional television quiz on which the main character, Del, was a contestant. In 2001 he voiced characters in two episodes of the animated comedy series &quot;Rex the Runt&quot;. He also appeared on the first pilot show for &quot;Shooting Stars&quot;, acting as a team captain.

He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in March 2001 when he was surprised by Michael Aspel at the BBC Television Centre.

===1987, 1999–2010, 2014–2018: BBC Radio===
Ross&#x27;s first radio work was on BBC Radio 1 in 1987, when he sat in for Janice Long for two weeks. Ross began presenting a Saturday morning show on BBC Radio 2 in July 1999. He has also presented radio shows for Virgin Radio (having previously worked on Richard Branson&#x27;s earlier venture, &quot;Radio Radio&quot;), as well as the now-defunct commercial radio network service &quot;The Superstation&quot;, where his producer was Chris Evans. Ross&#x27;s show on Radio 2 last aired on 17 July 2010 when his contract at the BBC ended.

In August 2014, he returned to Radio 2 as a stand-in presenter on Steve Wright&#x27;s afternoon show for four days. 
In March 2015 Jonathan sat in for Steve Wright again from 16 to 27 March 2015. In February 2016 Ross returned to Radio 2 on a regular basis to present the weekly arts show. From January 11, 2018, Anneka Rice took over the arts show.

===2001–10: &quot;Friday Night with Jonathan Ross&quot; and other projects===

In 2001, Ross began presenting his BBC One comedy chat show &quot;Friday Night with Jonathan Ross&quot;.

In 2004, Ross presented a documentary on one of his favourite subjects, punk rock, for the BBC.

In November 2005, Ross appeared on Gordon Ramsay&#x27;s The F Word where Ramsay shows Ross how to kill lobster.

In 2005, Ross anchored the BBC television coverage of the Live 8 concerts. Later that year he was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours for services to broadcasting. He celebrated the news by playing &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; by The Sex Pistols (which was banned by the BBC when released in 1977) on his BBC Radio 2 Saturday morning show. On 21 June 2006, Ross was made a Fellow of University College London, where he studied.

In early 2006, Ross announced that after eight years he was quitting his regular panellist seat on the sport/comedy quiz show &quot;They Think It&#x27;s All Over&quot; explaining: &quot;I need time now to focus on my other commitments and so regrettably I won&#x27;t be back for the 20th series.&quot; Following Ross&#x27;s departure, only two more episodes of the show were made before it was cancelled.

In January 2006 he presented &quot;Jonathan Ross&#x27; Asian Invasion&quot;, broadcast on BBC Four. The three-part documentary followed Ross as he explored the film industry in Japan, Hong Kong and South Korea, interviewing directors and showcasing clips. His interest in East Asian culture and his self-confessed love for Japanese anime and video games led him to making three series of BBC Three show &quot;Japanorama&quot;, as well as producing another television series for the same channel called &quot;Adam and Joe Go Tokyo&quot;, starring Adam Buxton and Joe Cornish. He produced the latter programme through his own television production company Hot Sauce.

In June 2006, a bidding war was sparked between BBC and other broadcasters for Ross&#x27;s services. Although other broadcasters were unsuccessful in poaching Ross, it is believed that their bids were higher than the BBC during negotiations. ITV, who bid for Ross, poached chat host Michael Parkinson around the same time. Ross became the highest paid television personality in Britain, when a new BBC contract secured his services until 2010, for a reported £18 million (£6 million per year). That same month, he was named by &quot;Radio Times&quot; as the most powerful person in British radio.

On 25 June 2006, he performed at the Children&#x27;s Party at the Palace for the Queen&#x27;s 80th birthday. In August 2006, Ross asked the first question in the Yahoo! Answers &quot;Five Million Answers challenge&quot;. On 16 March 2007, Ross hosted Comic Relief 2007 alongside Fearne Cotton and Lenny Henry.

On 7 July 2007, Ross co-presented (with Graham Norton) BBC television coverage of the Live Earth climate change awareness concerts, which became the subject of controversy due to the foul language used by performers including Phil Collins,Madonna and Johnny Borrell, resulting in one of Ofcom&#x27;s toughest sanctions to date on the BBC. Ross had been required to apologise on the day for the language used by Collins and Borrell.

Ross is well-known as an enthusiastic comic book collector. Starting on 10 September 2007, he presented the BBC Four series &quot;Comics Britannia&quot;, about the history of the British comic. This forms the core of a Comics Britannia season, which includes another documentary, &quot;In Search of Steve Ditko&quot;, by Ross. Ross is also greatly interested in Japan, presenting a BBC-TV series on many different aspects of Japanese culture, &quot;Japanorama&quot;, for three series between 2002 and 2007. In May 2008, Ross won the Sony Gold Award &quot;Music Radio Personality of the Year&quot;. On 3 August 2008, he hosted &quot;Jonathan Ross Salutes Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;, a BBC One tribute to the sitcom set during World War II.

In 2010, Ross took part in &quot;Channel 4&#x27;s Comedy Gala&quot;, a benefit show held in aid of Great Ormond Street Children&#x27;s Hospital, filmed live at The O2 Arena in London on 30 March. On 7 April 2010, Ross&#x27;s first comic book was published. &quot;Turf&quot; was written by Jonathan himself and drawn by artist Tommy Lee Edwards. In 2011, Ross wrote an introduction for &quot;The Steve Ditko Omnibus Vol. 1&quot;, a collection of work by the American comics artist featured in Ross&#x27;s 2007 documentary.

===2010: Leaving the BBC===
On 7 January 2010, Ross confirmed that he would leave the BBC in July 2010. This would see him leave all his regular BBC roles, namely his Friday night chat show, Radio 2 show and the film review programme, although he would be continuing with some specials, such as Comic Relief and the BAFTA Awards.

Ross said that while he &quot;had a wonderful time working for the BBC&quot; he had &quot;decided not to re-negotiate when my current contract comes to an end,&quot; a choice which was &quot;not financially motivated&quot;. The announcement came a day after it became public knowledge that Graham Norton had signed a two-year deal with the BBC. Torin Douglas, the corporation&#x27;s media correspondent speculated Norton would be a ready-made replacement for Ross&#x27;s chat show role, while Mark Kermode of BBC Radio 5 Live was a potential successor in the film review role, but that &quot;replacing Ross on radio will be harder.&quot; Ross last appeared on the film programme in Episode 10 of &quot;Film 2010 with Jonathan Ross&quot; aired on 17 March 2010. After Kermode publicly ruled himself out on 26 March, Claudia Winkleman was announced 30 March 2010 as his replacement as host of the &quot;Film&quot; programme.

Ross&#x27;s final &quot;Friday Night&quot; chat show episode aired on 16 July 2010, with David Beckham, Jackie Chan, Mickey Rourke, and Roxy Music as guests. Ross ended the show with an affectionate tribute to his guests and to the audience, while mentioning that he had promised Morrissey that he would remain composed and &quot;wouldn&#x27;t cry.&quot; His final Radio 2 show was broadcast the following day. Patrick Kielty initially took over Ross&#x27;s Radio 2 slot, after which Graham Norton took over permanently from 2 October that year.

===2010–present: ITV and Channel 4===
On 19 December 2010, Ross presented a three-hour Channel 4 list show, &quot;100 Greatest Toys&quot;, with the broadcaster describing Ross as a &quot;huge toy enthusiast with a private collection that would rival any museum&#x27;s&quot;. In 2012, Ross&#x27;s voice appeared as a headteacher in &quot;Back to School&quot; at the Edinburgh Festival. In October 2013, Ross was hired by Xbox (Microsoft) to help promote the brand. In 2011, he presented &quot;Penn &amp; Teller: Fool Us&quot; on ITV, a collaboration with magicians Penn &amp; Teller, which he would resume hosting when the show moved to The CW in 2014.

Ross&#x27;s new chat show, &quot;The Jonathan Ross Show&quot;, began on 3 September 2011 on ITV1, drawing an audience of 4.3m viewers, compared to the 4.6m for his finale on the BBC show. The first series ran for thirteen weeks. Speaking about the new show, Ross said: &quot;I am thrilled and excited that after a short break I will be rolling up my sleeves and creating a brand new show for ITV1.&quot;
On 20 October 2014, it was announced by ITV that Ross had signed a new contract with ITV. The new contract will see him present two more series of his chatshow along with a Christmas Special on ITV in 2015. ITV&#x27;s Director of Entertainment and Comedy Elaine Bedell added: &quot;Jonathan is the king of talk shows and a valued member of the ITV family. He continues to attract the biggest names in showbiz onto his sofa and I am delighted that he will remain on the channel until at least the end of 2015.&quot; Ross said: &quot;I&#x27;ve been lucky enough to interview some of the biggest stars around on The Jonathan Ross Show and I&#x27;m delighted that I&#x27;ll continue to do so for ITV until at least the end of 2015 with two series booked for the channel for next year.&quot; 
In November 2014, Ross designed a Paddington Bear statue, one of fifty created by various celebrities which were located around London prior to the release of the film &quot;Paddington&quot;, with the statues auctioned to raise funds for the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC).

In 2015, Ross&#x27;s 2004 interview with Amy Winehouse was featured in Asif Kapadia&#x27;s highly praised documentary film about the late singer, entitled &quot;Amy&quot;. In 2017, Ross was a team captain along with Frank Skinner on the ITV panel show &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask Me Ask Britain&quot;. In December 2017, Ross presented &quot;Guess the Star&quot;, a one-off special for ITV. On 9 September 2019, Ross was announced as a judge for &quot;The Masked Singer UK&quot;, the UK version of the international music game show &quot;Masked Singer&quot;, which aired on ITV from January 2020.

In September 2020, Ross started hosting his own 30-minute weekly ITV show called &quot;Jonathan Ross&#x27; Comedy Club&quot;. On 4 March 2021, it was announced by ITV that Ross would be on the celebrity panel of a brand new spin-off show of &quot;The Masked Singer UK&quot;, &quot;The Masked Dancer,&quot; which aired in spring 2021. Ross made his debut appearance on &quot;Celebrity Gogglebox&quot; on 2 July 2021, and was joined by his son, Harvey, daughter Honey and her boyfriend. In March 2023, Ross replaced Andrew Collins as presenter of the weekly radio show &quot;Saturday Night at the Movies&quot; on Classic FM.

==Personal life==
Ross married the author, journalist, and broadcaster Jane Goldman in August 1988 in Las Vegas. They have since had three children: Betty Kitten, Harvey Kirby (named after Jack Kirby, a comic book creator whom Ross especially admires), and Honey Kinny. In 2005, Ross was made an OBE in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours for services to broadcasting. He celebrated the news by playing &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; by the Sex Pistols on his Radio 2 show.

Ross resides in Hampstead Garden Suburb, London. He owns a second home in Swanage in Dorset and owns property in Florida in the United States.

Ross and others have used his rhotacism for comic effect, and he is sometimes known as &quot;Wossy&quot;, including on his Twitter feed (@wossy).

Ross is a big pop and rock music fan and maintains a particular interest in British punk rock, which captivated him when he was young. The first band he saw in concert was punk band X-Ray Spex at Islington&#x27;s Hope and Anchor pub in North London. He paid tribute to lead singer Poly Styrene following her death. He has described himself as &quot;about as big a fan of David Bowie as you will find on the planet&quot;. The glam art rock band Roxy Music are one of his all-time favourite acts and were invited to perform on the final episode of &quot;Friday Night with Jonathan Ross&quot;.

Ross is a fan of science fiction, including &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. He contributed his early memories of the series, which included the 1968 serial &quot;The Invasion&quot;, to a book which raised funds for Alzheimer&#x27;s Research UK.

Ross is a fan of the animation studio Studio Ghibli, especially the works of director Hayao Miyazaki, and has been an early proponent of its works before its international popularity. He first saw &quot;Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind&quot; in 1987, which he praises as &quot;massively underrated&quot;, and considers &quot;Spirited Away&quot; to be a &quot;masterpiece&quot;. He would later interview Miyazaki for &quot;Japanorama&quot;. Ross provided a minor voice role in one episode of &quot;Ronja, the Robber&#x27;s Daughter&quot;.

Ross is also a fan of comic books and co-owned a comic shop in London with Paul Gambaccini. He released &quot;Turf&quot;, his first comic book, in 2010, with American artist Tommy Lee Edwards. 

Ross has attended a fundraiser for the James Randi Educational Foundation called &quot;The Amazing Meeting&quot; in London in 2009 and 2010. Ross has described himself as a big fan of James Randi and the other speakers – who were mainly prominent sceptics – and said that he and his wife had come to have a sceptical view of the world. Ross has been supportive of Simon Singh&#x27;s efforts to defend an accusation of libel by the British Chiropractic Association and Ross has posed for the &quot;Geek Calendar 2011&quot;, a fund raiser for The Libel Reform Campaign.

Ross&#x27;s mother, Martha Ross, died on 14 January 2019, at the age of 79.

In 2023, Ross was integral to the preservation of the arcade version of &quot;Um Jammer Lammy&quot;, previously thought to be lost media, by allowing video game archivists access to his arcade cabinet, thought of as one of the world&#x27;s last examples.

== Controversies ==

===BBC contract===
In April 2006, details of his fees and those of other BBC personalities were leaked to the tabloid press. It was claimed at the time, by a then-unidentified BBC mole, that Ross earned £530,000 per year for hosting his Radio 2 show (equivalent to £10,000 per show). While refusing to comment specifically on the leak in line with BBC policy on the matter, Ross did hint during his radio show that the figure was exaggerated; in addition to this, any pay highlighted as being &quot;his&quot; would actually be split between himself and his producer/co-presenter on the show, Andy Davies.

===David Cameron interview===
In June 2006, when Conservative Party leader David Cameron appeared on &quot;Friday Night with Jonathan Ross&quot;, Ross began a line of questioning relating to Conservative ex-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, culminating in the question &quot;Did you or did you not have a wank thinking of Margaret Thatcher?&quot; Ross was defended by the BBC publicly, but repeat showings of the interview have been banned.

===&quot;1,000 journalists&quot; comment===
On 5 December 2007, Ross joked at the &quot;British Comedy Awards&quot; that his salary meant that he was &quot;apparently worth 1,000 BBC journalists&quot;. His quip came shortly after the BBC had announced plans for more than 2,000 job cuts, and was condemned as &quot;obscene&quot; by the general secretary of the National Union of Journalists. Ross has denied this and in a 2011 article is quoted as saying that he was commenting on a piece that was written in a newspaper about his salary being that of 1,000 journalists:

===Gwyneth Paltrow interview===
The BBC Trust ruled that Ross&#x27;s interview with American actress Gwyneth Paltrow, broadcast on 2 May 2008, breached editorial guidelines. They ruled that bad language in an episode of Ross&#x27;s pre-recorded BBC1 chat show, &quot;Friday Night with Jonathan Ross&quot;, in which the presenter told Paltrow he &quot;would fuck her&quot;, was &quot;gratuitous and unnecessarily offensive&quot;. The trust said it disagreed with the judgement made by BBC management that the episode should be broadcast uncensored, adding that the comment was made in an &quot;overly sexual way&quot; and that it had upheld a number of complaints made about the edition of &quot;Friday Night with Jonathan Ross&quot;. The trust reminded BBC staff that &quot;the casual gratuitous use of the most offensive language is not acceptable on the BBC in accordance with the BBC&#x27;s existing guidelines and practices&quot;, adding that &quot;this particularly applies in entertainment programmes&quot;.

===&quot;The Russell Brand Show&quot; and Andrew Sachs===
Following a guest appearance by Ross on &quot;The Russell Brand Show&quot; broadcast on 18 October 2008, Ross was suspended for 12 weeks without pay by the BBC on 29 October, after a series of lewd answerphone messages, including Ross saying, &quot;He fucked your granddaughter&quot;, were left for then 78-year-old actor Andrew Sachs regarding Sachs&#x27; granddaughter Georgina Baillie, by Russell Brand and Ross, which were broadcast on the pre-recorded show. After little initial interest, a media story about the calls by the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; generated a high number of complaints. Brand resigned from the BBC, while Ross was suspended without pay. BBC director general Mark Thompson stated that Ross should take the disciplinary action as a &quot;final warning&quot;. The BBC was later fined £150,000 by Britain&#x27;s broadcast regulator for airing the calls.

On 21 November 2008, the BBC Trust said that the phone calls were a &quot;deplorable intrusion with no editorial justification&quot;. The trust gave its backing to Ross&#x27;s 12-week suspension but recommended that no further action be taken against him. He returned to work in January 2009 with a new series of &quot;Friday Night&quot;. From 23 May 2009, Ross&#x27;s BBC Radio 2 show was recorded 24 hours before broadcast.

===Homophobia accusation===
On 13 May 2009, Ross was accused of homophobia after a comment he made on his radio show, in which he said,

An incorrect version of this quote was also circulated, in which Ross was accused of saying:

Ofcom received 61 complaints following the comment. On 7 July 2009, Ofcom ruled that Ross did not breach the broadcasting code. They wrote in their opinion that &quot;the comment was clearly presented as a joke intended to make light of the reactions that some parents may have if their child chooses a toy that is very widely recognised to be designed and marketed for the opposite sex&quot; and that the nature of the joke and tone and manner in which it was presented &quot;made clear that it was not intended to be hostile or pejorative towards the gay community in general.&quot; Stonewall criticised the ruling; saying &quot;the fact that a comment is light-hearted does not absolve it from perpetuating the stereotypes that lead to homophobic bullying.&quot;

=== Hugo Awards ===
On 1 March 2014 Loncon 3, the 72nd World Science Fiction Convention, announced that Ross would be the Master of Ceremonies for the 2014 Hugo Awards ceremony, to be held in August at ExCeL London. This generated angry criticism from members of science fiction fandom who objected to the idea, citing Ross&#x27;s record of controversial statements and actions. Convention committee member Farah Mendlesohn strongly objected to the choice of Ross as MC, and resigned when the Loncon 3 Co-Chairs would not reconsider the choice, writing (in part), &#x27;[Ross] is a man who has made a fortune (6 million a year at one point) from abusing others—particularly women—live on air.&#x27; He publicly withdrew as MC not long after the announcement, tweeting &#x27;I have decided to withdraw from hosting the Hugo&#x27;s @loncon3 in response to some who would rather I weren&#x27;t there. Have a lovely convention.&#x27;

<text>The Eddystone Lighthouse is a lighthouse on the Eddystone Rocks, south of Rame Head in Cornwall, England. The rocks are submerged below the surface of the sea and are composed of Precambrian gneiss.

The current structure is the fourth to be built on the site. The first lighthouse (Winstanley&#x27;s) was swept away in a powerful storm, killing its architect and five other men in the process. The second (Rudyard&#x27;s) stood for fifty years before it burned down. The third (Smeaton&#x27;s) is renowned because of its influence on lighthouse design and its importance in the development of concrete for building; its upper portions were re-erected in Plymouth as a monument. The first lighthouse, completed in 1699, was the world&#x27;s first open ocean lighthouse, although the Cordouan Lighthouse off the western French coast preceded it as the first offshore lighthouse.

== The need for a light ==
The Eddystone Rocks are an extensive reef approximately SSW off Plymouth Sound, one of the most important naval harbours of England, and midway between Lizard Point, Cornwall and Start Point. They are submerged at high spring tides and were so feared by mariners entering the English Channel that they often hugged the coast of France to avoid the danger, which thus resulted not only in shipwrecks locally, but on the rocks of the north coast of France and the Channel Islands. Given the difficulty of gaining a foothold on the rocks particularly in the predominant swell it was a long time before anyone attempted to place any warning on them.

== Winstanley&#x27;s lighthouse ==

The first lighthouse on Eddystone Rocks was an octagonal wooden structure built by Henry Winstanley. The lighthouse was also the first recorded instance of an offshore lighthouse. Construction started in 1696 and the light was lit on 14 November 1698. During construction, a French privateer took Winstanley prisoner and destroyed the work done so far on the foundations, causing Louis XIV to order Winstanley&#x27;s release with the words &quot;France is at war with England, not with humanity&quot;.

The lighthouse survived its first winter but was in need of repair, and was subsequently changed to a dodecagonal (12 sided) stone clad exterior on a timber-framed construction with an octagonal top section as can be seen in the later drawings or paintings. The octagonal top section (or &#x27;lantern&#x27;) was high and in diameter, its eight windows each made up of 36 individual glass panes. It was lit by &#x27;60 candles at a time, besides a great hanging lamp&#x27;.

Winstanley&#x27;s tower lasted until the great storm of 1703 erased almost all trace on . Winstanley was on the lighthouse, completing additions to the structure. No trace was found of him, or of the other five men in the lighthouse.

The cost of construction and five years&#x27; maintenance totalled £7,814 7&quot;s.&quot;6&quot;d&quot;, during which time dues totalling £4,721 19&quot;s.&quot;3&quot;d&quot; had been collected at one penny per ton from passing vessels.

== Rudyard&#x27;s lighthouse ==


Following the destruction of the first lighthouse, Captain John Lovett acquired the lease of the rock, and by an act of Parliament, the (4 &amp; 5 Ann. c. 7), was allowed to charge passing ships a of one penny per ton. He commissioned John Rudyard (or Rudyerd) to design the new lighthouse.
Rudyard&#x27;s lighthouse, in contrast to its predecessor, was a smooth conical tower, shaped &#x27;so as to offer the least possible resistance to wind and wave&#x27;. It was built on a base of solid wood, formed from layers of timber beams, laid horizontally on seven flat steps which had been cut into the upper face of the sloping rock. On top of this base rose several courses of stone, interspersed with further layers of wood, which was designed to serve as ballast for the tower. This substructure rose to a height of , on top of which were raised four storeys of timber. The entire structure was sheathed in vertical wooden planks and anchored to the reef using 36 wrought iron bolts, forged to fit deep dovetailed holes which had been cut in the reef. The vertical planks were installed by two master-shipwrights from Woolwich Dockyard and were caulked like those of a ship. The tower was topped with an octagonal lantern, which brought it to a total height of . A light was first shone from the tower on and the work was completed in 1709. The light was provided by 24 candles. Rudyard&#x27;s lighthouse proved more durable than its predecessor, surviving and serving its purpose on the reef for nearly 50 years.

In 1715 Captain Lovett died and his lease was purchased by Robert Weston, Esq., in company with two others (one of whom was Rudyard).
On the night of 2 December 1755, the top of the lantern caught fire, probably through a spark from one of the candles used to illuminate the light, or else through a fracture in the chimney which passed through the lantern from the stove in the kitchen below. The three keepers threw water upwards from a bucket but were driven onto the rock and were rescued by boat as the tower burnt down. Keeper Henry Hall, who was 94 at the time, died several days later from ingesting molten lead from the lantern roof. A report on this case was submitted to the Royal Society by physician Edward Spry, and the piece of lead is now in the collections of the National Museums of Scotland.
== Smeaton&#x27;s lighthouse ==
The third lighthouse to be built on the Eddystone marked a major step forward in the design of such structures.

===Design and building===
Following the destruction of Rudyard&#x27;s tower, Robert Weston sought advice on rebuilding the lighthouse from the Earl of Macclesfield, then President of the Royal Society. He recommended mathematical instrument maker and aspiring civil engineer, John Smeaton, who was introduced to Weston in February 1756. In May, following a series of visits to the rock, Smeaton proposed that the new lighthouse should be built of stone and modelled on the shape of an oak tree. He appointed Josias Jessop to serve as his general assistant, and established a shore base for the construction works at Millbay.

Work began on the reef in August 1756, with the gradual cutting away of recesses in the rock which were designed to dovetail in due course with the foundations of the tower. During the winter, the workers stayed ashore and were employed in dressing the stone for the lighthouse; work then resumed on the rock the following June, with the laying of the first courses of stone. The foundations and outside structure were built of local Cornish granite, while lighter Portland limestone masonry was used on the inside. As part of the construction process, Smeaton pioneered &#x27;hydraulic lime&#x27;, a concrete that cured under water, and developed a technique of securing the blocks using dovetail joints and marble dowels. Work continued over the course of the following two years, and the light was first lit on 16 October 1759.

Smeaton&#x27;s lighthouse was high and had a diameter at the base of and at the top of . It was lit by a chandelier of 24 large tallow candles.

===Later modifications===

In 1807 the 100-year lease on the lighthouse expired, whereupon ownership and management devolved to Trinity House. In 1810 they replaced the chandelier and candles with 24 Argand lamps and parabolic reflectors.

In 1841 major renovations were made, under the direction of engineer Henry Norris of Messrs. Walker &amp; Burges, including complete repointing, replacement water tanks and filling of a large cavity in the rock close to the foundations. In 1845 the lighthouse was equipped with a new second-order fixed catadioptric optic, manufactured by Henry Lepaute of Paris, with a single multi-wick oil lamp, replacing the old lamps and reflectors. This was the first time that a fully catadioptric large optic (using prisms rather than mirrors above and below the lens) had been constructed, and the first such installation in any lighthouse. A new lantern was constructed and fitted to the top of the tower in 1848, as the original had proved unsatisfactory for housing the new optic.
From 1858 the tower&#x27;s exterior was painted with broad red and white horizontal bands, so as to render it &#x27;more distinctly visible during the day time&#x27;. In 1872 a 5 cwt fog bell was provided for the lighthouse; it was sounded &#x27;five times in quick succession every half minute&#x27; in foggy weather. That same year an improved lamp was installed, which more than doubled the intensity of the light.

In 1877 it was resolved to build a replacement lighthouse, following reports that erosion to the rocks under Smeaton&#x27;s tower was causing it to shake from side to side whenever large waves hit. During construction of the new lighthouse, the Town Council of Plymouth petitioned for Smeaton&#x27;s tower to be dismantled and rebuilt on Plymouth Hoe, in lieu of a Trinity House daymark which stood there. Trinity House consented to the removal and delivery of the lantern and the upper four rooms of the tower, the cost of labour to be borne by Plymouth Council. While the new tower was being built the old lighthouse remained operational, up until 3 February 1882 (after which a temporary fixed light was shown from the top of the new tower). When the latter was complete, Smeaton&#x27;s lighthouse was decommissioned and the crane which had been used to build the new lighthouse was transferred to the task of dismantling the old. William Tregarthen Douglass supervised the operation.

===Present day===
The upper part of Smeaton&#x27;s lighthouse was subsequently rebuilt, as planned, on top of a replica granite frustum on Plymouth Hoe: preserved &#x27;as a monument to Smeaton&#x27;s genius, and in commemoration of one of the most successful, useful and instructive works ever accomplished in civil engineering&#x27;. The rebuilding was funded by public subscription. It remains in place today and, as &#x27;Smeaton&#x27;s Tower&#x27;, is open to the public as a tourist attraction.

The original frustum or base of the tower also survives, standing where it was built on the Eddystone rocks, from the current lighthouse. Having dismantled the upper part of the structure, Douglass infilled the old entrance way and stairwell within the frustum and fixed an iron mast to the top of the stub tower. He expressed the hope that &#x27;the rock below will for ages endure to support this portion of Smeaton&#x27;s lighthouse, which, in its thus diminished form, is still rendering important service to the mariner, in giving a distinctive character to the Eddystone by day&#x27;.
== Douglass&#x27;s lighthouse ==

The current, fourth lighthouse was designed by James Douglass (using Robert Stevenson&#x27;s developments of Smeaton&#x27;s techniques). This lighthouse is still in use.

===Design and building===

By July 1878 the new site, on the South Rock was being prepared during the 3½ hours between ebb and flood tide; the foundation stone was laid on 19 August the following year by The Duke of Edinburgh, Master of Trinity House. The supply ship &quot;Hercules&quot; was based at Oreston, now a suburb of Plymouth; stone was prepared at the Oreston yard and supplied from the works of Messrs Shearer, Smith and Co of Wadebridge. The tower, which is high, contains a total of 62,133 cubic feet of granite, weighing 4,668 tons. The last stone was laid on 1 June 1881 and the light was first lit on 18 May 1882.

The lighthouse was topped by a larger than usual lantern storey, high and wide; the lantern was painted red. It contained a six-sided biform (i.e. two-tier) rotating optic of the first-order, high and weighing over seven tons. Each of the six sides of the optic was divided into two Fresnel lens panels, which provided the light&#x27;s characteristic of two flashes every thirty seconds. The optic was manufactured by Chance Brothers of Smethwick and designed by their chief engineer John Hopkinson FRS. At the time the Eddystone&#x27;s extra-tall () lenses were the largest in existence; their superior height was achieved through the use of extra-dense flint glass in the upper and lower portions of each panel.

The light had a range of . Illumination was provided by a pair of Douglass-designed six-wick concentric oil burners (one for each tier of the optic). This was said to represent &#x27;the first practical application of superposed lenses of the first order with oil as the illuminating material&#x27;. On clear nights, only the lamp in the lower tier of lenses was lit (producing a light of 37,000 candlepower); in poor visibility, however (judged by whether the Plymouth Breakwater light was visible), both lamps were used at full power, to provide a 159,600 candlepower light. Eighteen cisterns in the lower part of the tower were used to store up to 2,660 tons (nine months&#x27; worth) of colza oil to fuel the lamps.

In addition to the main light a fixed white light was shone from a room on the eighth storey of the tower (using a pair of Argand lamps and reflectors) in the direction of the hazardous Hand Deeps. The lighthouse was also provided with a pair of large bells, each weighing two tons, by Gillett, Bland &amp; Co., which were suspended from either side of the lantern gallery to serve as a fog signal; they sounded (to match the light characteristic of the lighthouse) twice every thirty seconds in foggy weather, and were struck by the same clockwork mechanism that drove the rotation of the lenses. The mechanism required winding every hour (or every forty minutes, when the bells were in use), &#x27;the weight to be lifted being equal to one ton&#x27;; shortly after opening, the lighthouse was equipped with a 0.5 h.p. caloric engine, designed &#x27;for relieving the keepers of the excessive strain of driving the machine when both illuminating apparatus and fog bell are in use&#x27;.

===Later modifications===

In 1894 an explosive fog signal device was installed on the gallery of lighthouse; the fog bells were briefly retained as a standby provision, but then removed. In 1904 the lamps were replaced with incandescent oil vapour burners. Following the invention of the mercury bath system (allowing a lighthouse optic to revolve in a trough of mercury rather than on rollers) the Eddystone lens pedestal was duly upgraded and the drive mechanism replaced. Later, beginning in 1959, the light was electrified: the new light source was a 1,250W incandescent lamp, powered by a diesel generator (three of which were installed in a lower store room). In place of the old lenses a new, smaller (fourth-order) AGA &#x27;bi-valve&#x27; optic was installed, which flashed at the faster rate of twice every ten seconds. The old optic was removed and donated to Southampton Maritime Museum (it was exhibited on the Royal Pier in the 1970s, but later removed to a council yard where it was destroyed by vandals). As part of the programme of modernisation, the lighthouse was given a &#x27;SuperTyfon&#x27; fog signal, with compressors powered from the diesel generators.
The lighthouse was automated in 1982, the first Trinity House &#x27;Rock&#x27; (or offshore) lighthouse to be converted. Two years earlier the tower had been changed by construction of a helipad above the lantern, to allow maintenance crews access; the helipad has a weight limit of 3600 kg (3½ tons). As part of the automation of the lighthouse a new electric fog signal was installed and a metal halide discharge lamp replaced the incandescent light bulb formerly in use. The light and other systems were monitored remotely, initially by Trinity House staff at the nearby Penlee Point fog signal station. Since 1999 the lighthouse has run on solar power.

===Present day===
The tower is high, and its white light flashes twice every 10 seconds. The light is visible to , and is supplemented by a foghorn of 3 blasts every 62 seconds. A subsidiary red sector light shines from a window in the tower to highlight the Hand Deeps hazard to the west-northwest. The lighthouse is now monitored and controlled from the Trinity House Operations Control Centre at Harwich in Essex.

<doc id="151587" wikidata="Q1652863" url="?curid=151587" title="Forth and Clyde Canal">
<text>The Forth and Clyde Canal is a canal opened in 1790, crossing central Scotland; it provided a route for the seagoing vessels of the day between the Firth of Forth and the Firth of Clyde at the narrowest part of the Scottish Lowlands. This allowed navigation from Edinburgh on the east coast to the port of Glasgow on the west coast. The canal is long and it runs from the River Carron at Grangemouth to the River Clyde at Bowling, and had an important basin at Port Dundas in Glasgow.

Successful in its day, it suffered as the seagoing vessels were built larger and could no longer pass through. The railway age further impaired the success of the canal, and in the 1930s decline had ended in dormancy. The final decision to close the canal in the early 1960s was made due to maintenance costs of bridges crossing the canal exceeding the revenues it brought in. However, subsidies to the rail network were also a cause for its decline and the closure ended the movement of the east-coast Forth River fishing fleets across the country to fish the Irish Sea. The lack of political and financial foresight also removed a historical recreational waterway and potential future revenue generator to the town of Grangemouth. Unlike the majority of major canals the route through Grangemouth was drained and backfilled before 1967 to create a new carriageway for port traffic.

The M8 motorway in the eastern approaches to Glasgow took over some of the alignment of the canal, but more recent ideas have regenerated the utility of the canal for leisure use.

==Geography==
The eastern end of the canal is connected to the River Forth by a stretch of the River Carron near Grangemouth. The canal roughly follows the course of the Roman Antonine Wall and was the biggest infrastructure project in Scotland since then. The highest section of the canal passes close to Kilsyth and it is fed there by an aqueduct which gathers water from (the purpose built) Birkenburn Reservoir in the Kilsyth Hills, stored in another purpose-built reservoir called Townhead near Banton, from where it feeds the canal via a feeder from the Shawend Burn near Craigmarloch. The canal continues past Twechar, through Kirkintilloch and Bishopbriggs to the Maryhill area north of Glasgow city centre. A branch to Port Dundas was built to secure the agreement and financial support of Glasgow merchants who feared losing business if the canal bypassed them completely. This branch flows past Murano Street Student Village, halls of residence for the University of Glasgow. The western end of the canal connects to the River Clyde at Bowling.

In 1840, a canal, the Forth and Cart Canal, was built to link the Forth and Clyde canal, at Whitecrook, to the River Clyde, opposite the mouth of the River Cart.

==Origins==




The canal was authorised by the (8 Geo. 3. c. 63).

Priestley, writing in 1831, said:

At first there were difficulties with securing the capital for the work, but soon, thanks in the main to investment by Sir Lawrence Dundas, 1st Baronet, &quot;the execution of this canal proceeded with such rapidity, under the direction of [the engineer] Mr. Smeaton, that in two years and three quarters from the date of the first act, one half of the work was finished; when, in consequence of some misunderstanding between him and the proprietors, he declined any further connection with the work, which was shortly afterwards let to contractors, who however failed, and the canal was again placed under the direction of its original projector, who brought it to within of its proposed junction with the Clyde, when the work was stopped in 1775 for want of funds, and it continued at a stand for several years.&quot;

Numerous supplementary acts of Parliament preceded this period, and more followed, but the key to unlocking the problem was some creativity, in which &quot;the Barons of the Court of Exchequer in Scotland, are, out of the money arising from the sale of forfeited estates, directed to lend the Forth and Clyde Navigation Company the sum of £50,000, by which they were enabled to resume their labours, under the direction of Mr. Robert Whitworth, an engineer possessing a well earned reputation&quot;. The work was completed on 28 July 1790.

The Forth and Clyde Navigation Committee was set up in Glasgow in (or before) 1787 and had several notable members: John Riddel (Lord Provost of Glasgow); John Campbell of Clathick; Patrick Colquhoun (Convenor and Superintendent); Robert Whitworth (engineer); Archibald Spiers; John Cumine (as collector of fees at east end) and James Loudon (as collector of fees at west end).

==Contemporary description==
Priestley wrote in 1831,

Besides the fine rivers above-mentioned [the Forth and Clyde, the canal], is joined by the Edinburgh and Glasgow Union Canal, near Falkirk; with the Monkland and Kirkintilloch Railway at its summit, near the last-mentioned village; and with the Monkland Canal and the Garnkirk and Glasgow Railway, at Port Dundas, near the city of Glasgow.

This magnificent canal commences in the River Forth, in Grangemouth Harbour, and near to where the Carron empties itself into that river. Its course is parallel with the Carron, and in nearly a westwardly direction, passing to the north of the town of Falkirk, and thence to Red Bridge, where it quits the county of Stirling, and enters a detached portion of the shire of Dumbarton. Hence it passes to the south of Kilsyth, and runs along the south bank of the River Kelvin, and over the Luggie Water, by a fine stone aqueduct, at Kirkintilloch; it then approaches within little more than of the north-west quarter of the city of Glasgow, to which there is a branch communicating with the Monkland Canal at Port Dundas, near that city. The remaining part of the line is in a westwardly direction, crossing the Kelvin River by a noble aqueduct, and thence to the Clyde, into which, after running parallel with it for some distance, it locks down at Bowling&#x27;s Bay, near Dalmuir Burnfoot.

The canal is in length, viz, from Grangemouth to the east end of the summit pool, is ten miles and three quarters [], with a rise, from low water in the Forth, of , by twenty locks. The summit level is in length, and in the remainder of its course, there is a fall to low water, in the Clyde, at Bowling&#x27;s Bay, of , by nineteen locks.

The branch to the Monkland Canal at Glasgow is two miles and three quarters []; and there is another cut into the Carron River, at Carron Shore, in order to communicate with the Carron Iron Works.

Though this canal was originally constructed for vessels drawing , yet by recent improvements, sea-borne craft of draught may now pass through it, from the Irish Sea to the German Ocean. The locks are 74 feet long and 20 wide []; and upon its course are thirty-three draw-bridges, ten large aqueducts and thirty-three smaller ones; that over the Kelvin being long and above the surface of the stream. It is supplied with water from reservoirs; one of which, at Kilmananmuir, is , and deep at the sluice; and that at Kilsyth is in extent, with water at its head.

==Passenger traffic==

Between 1789 and 1803 the canal was used for trials of William Symington&#x27;s steamboats, culminating in the &quot;Charlotte Dundas&quot;, the &quot;first practical steamboat&quot; built at the shipyard in Grangemouth by Alexander Hart.

Passenger boats ran on the canal from 1783, and in 1809 fast boats were introduced, running from Edinburgh to Falkirk in 3 hours 30 minutes, providing such comforts as food, drink and newspapers. By 1812 they carried 44,000 passengers, taking receipts of more than £3,450.

From 1828 there was a steamboat service, operated by Thomas Grahame&#x27;s boat &quot;Cupid&quot;.

==Construction==
The canal was designed by John Smeaton. Construction started in 1768 and after delays due to funding problems was completed in 1790. To mark the opening a hogshead of water taken from the Forth was emptied into the Clyde at Bowling to symbolise the union of the eastern and western seas. The geologist James Hutton became very involved in the canal between 1767 and 1774; he contributed his geological knowledge, made extended site inspections, and acted both as a shareholder and as a member of the management committee. The Union Canal was then constructed to link the eastern end of the canal to Edinburgh.

==Changes of ownership==

In 1842 an act of Parliament, the (5 &amp; 6 Vict. c. xli) was obtained authorising the Forth and Clyde Canal Company to take over the Forth and Cart Canal.

The (30 &amp; 31 Vict. c. cvi) authorised the Caledonian Railway to take over the Forth and Clyde Canal. In the meantime the canal company had itself built a railway branch line to Grangemouth Dock, which it owned.

The canal was nationalised in 1948, along with the railway companies, and control passed to the British Transport Commission. In 1962, the British Transport Commission was wound up, and control passed to the British Waterways Board; subsequently Scottish Canals took control.

==Run down and revival==

In 1963 the canal was closed rather than construct a motorway crossing, and so it became disused and semi-derelict. Canal locks in the Falkirk area on the Union Canal near the connection to the Forth and Clyde canal had been filled in and built over in the 1930s.

As part of the millennium celebrations in 2000, National Lottery funds were used to regenerate both canals. A boatlifting device, the Falkirk Wheel, was built to connect the two canals and once more allow boats to travel from the Clyde or Glasgow to Edinburgh, with a new canal connection to the River Carron and hence the River Forth. The Falkirk Wheel opened on 27 May 2002 and is now a tourist attraction.

When the canal was reopened, the Port Dundas branch was reinstated from Stockingfield Junction, where it leaves the main line, to Speirs Wharf, where further progress was blocked by culverts created as part of the M8 Motorway construction and the abortive Maryhill Motorway. A connection from there to Pinkston Basin, which once formed the terminus of the Monkland Canal, was later achieved by the construction of of new canal and two locks, lowering the level of the canal to enable it to pass beneath existing structures. The project cost £5.6 million, and the first lock and intermediate basin were opened on 29 September 2006. The lock was named Speaker Martin&#x27;s Lock, after Michael Martin MP, the speaker in the House of Commons who performed the opening ceremony. Opening of the second lock was delayed by a dispute over land ownership.

==Forth and Clyde Canal Society==
The Forth and Clyde Canal Society is a waterway society on the Forth and Clyde Canal in the central lowlands of Scotland. It was formed in 1980 to &quot;campaign for the Forth and Clyde&#x27;s preservation, restoration and development&quot;

According to the Forth and Clyde Canal Society&#x27;s website, their current aim is &quot;To promote the canal and to ensure its success&quot;.

The Society&#x27;s campaigning included a petition of over 30,000 signatures for the reopening of the canal, which was then put in place under the Millennium Link project which commenced work in 1999.

The society currently has three boats which are used as trip-boats, charter vessels and for members cruises along the canal.

<text>The NewTek Video Toaster is a combination of hardware and software for the editing and production of NTSC standard-definition video. The plug-in expansion card initially worked with the Amiga 2000 computer and provides a number of BNC connectors on the exposed rear edge that provide connectivity to common analog video sources like VHS VCRs. The related software tools support video switching, luma keying, character generation, animation, and image manipulation.

Together, the hardware and software provided, for a few thousand U.S. dollars, a video editing suite that rivaled the output of contemporary (i.e. early 1990s) professional systems costing ten times as much. It allowed small studios to produce high-quality material and resulted in a cottage industry for video production not unlike the success of the Macintosh in the desktop publishing (DTP) market only a few years earlier. The Video Toaster won the Emmy Award for Technical Achievement in 1993. Other parts of the original software package were spun off as stand-alone products, notably LightWave 3D, and achieved success on their own.

As the Amiga platform lost market share and Commodore International went bankrupt in 1994 as a result of declining sales, the Video Toaster was moved to the Microsoft Windows platform where it is still available. The company also produced what is essentially a portable pre-packaged version of the Video Toaster along with all the computer hardware needed, as the TriCaster. These became all-digital units in 2014, ending production of the analog line.

== First generation systems ==
The Video Toaster was designed by NewTek founder Tim Jenison in Topeka, Kansas. Engineer Brad Carvey built the first wire wrap prototype, and Steve Kell wrote the software for the prototype. Many other people worked on the Toaster as it developed.

The Toaster was announced at the World of Commodore expo in 1987 and released as a commercial product in December 1990 for the Commodore Amiga 2000 computer system, taking advantage of the video-friendly aspects of that system&#x27;s hardware to deliver the product at an unusually low cost of $2,399. The Amiga was well adapted to this application in that its system clock at was precisely double that of the NTSC color carrier frequency, , allowing for simple synchronization of the video signal. The hardware component is a full-sized card that is installed into the Amiga 2000&#x27;s unique single video expansion slot rather than the standard bus slots, and therefore cannot be used with the A500 or A1000 models. The card has several BNC connectors in the rear, which accepts four video input sources and provided two outputs (preview and program). This initial generation system is essentially a real-time four-channel video switcher.

One feature of the Video Toaster is the inclusion of LightWave 3D, a 3D modeling, rendering, and animation program. This program became so popular in its own right that in 1994 it was made available as standalone product separate from the Toaster systems.

Aside from simple fades, dissolves, and cuts, the Video Toaster has a large variety of character generation, overlays and complex animated switching effects. These effects are in large part performed with the help of the native Amiga graphics chipset, which is synchronized to the NTSC video signals. As a result, while the Toaster was rendering a switching animation, the computer desktop display is not visible. While these effects are unique and inventive, they cannot be modified. Soon Toaster effects were seen everywhere, advertising the device as the brand of switcher those particular production companies were using.

The Toaster hardware requires very stable input signals, and therefore is often used along with a separate video sync time-base corrector to stabilize the video sources. Third-party low-cost time-base correctors (TBCs) specifically designed to work with the Toaster quickly came to market, most of which were designed as standard ISA bus cards, taking advantage of the typically unused Bridgeboard slots. The cards do not use the Bridgeboard to communicate, but simply as a convenient power supply and physical location.

As with all video switchers that use a frame buffer to create DVEs (digital video effects), the video path through the Toaster hardware introduced delays in the signals when the signal was in &quot;digital&quot; mode. Depending on the video setup of the user, this delay could be quite noticeable when viewed along with the corresponding audio, so some users installed audio delay circuits to match the Toaster&#x27;s video-delay lag, as is common practice in video-switching studios.

A user still needs at least three video tape recorders (VTR) and a controller to perform A/B roll linear video editing (LE), as the Toaster serves merely as a switcher, which can be triggered through general-purpose input/output (GPIO) to switch on cue in such a configuration, as the Toaster has no edit-controlling capabilities. The frame delays passing through the Toaster and other low-cost video switchers make precise editing a frustrating endeavor. Internal cards and software from other manufacturers are available to control VTRs; the most common systems go through the serial port to provide single-frame control of a VTR as a capture device for LightWave animations. A Non-linear editing system (NLE) product was added later, with the invention of the Video Toaster Flyer.

Although initially offered as just an add-on to an Amiga, the Video Toaster was soon available as a complete turn-key system that included the Toaster, Amiga, and sync generator. These Toaster systems became very popular, primarily because at a cost of around US$5,000, they could do much of what a $100,000 fully professional video switcher (such as a Grass Valley switcher) could do at that time. The Toaster was also the first such video device designed around a general-purpose personal computer that is capable of delivering broadcast quality NTSC signals.

As such, during the early 1990s the Toaster was widely used by consumer Amiga owners, desktop video enthusiasts, and local television studios, and was even used during &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; regularly to produce special effects for comedy skits. It was often easy to detect a studio that used the Toaster by the unique and recognizable special switching effects. The NBC television network also used the Video Toaster with LightWave for its promotional campaigns, beginning with the 1990-1991 broadcast season (&quot;NBC: The Place To Be!&quot;). All of the external submarine shots in the TV series &quot;seaQuest DSV&quot; were created using LightWave 3D, as were the outer-space scenes in the TV series &quot;Babylon 5&quot; (although Amiga hardware was only used for the first three seasons). Because of the heavy use of dark blues and greens (for which the NTSC television standard is weak), the external submarine shots in &quot;seaQuest DSV&quot; could not have made it to air without the use of the ASDG Abekas driver, written specifically to solve this problem by Aaron Avery at ASDG (later Elastic Reality, Inc.). This was due to &quot;ASDG&#x27;s exclusive color encoding technology which increases the apparent color bandwidth of video&quot;.

An updated version called Video Toaster 4000 was later released, using the Amiga 4000&#x27;s video slot. The 4000 was co-developed by actor Wil Wheaton, then famous for &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, who worked on product testing and quality control. He later used his public profile to serve as a technology evangelist for the product. Besides Wheaton, Penn Jillette (of &quot;Penn and Teller&quot; fame) and skateboarder Tony Hawk also served as evangelists for the 4000. Hawk was given a Video Toaster 4000 by NewTek upon learning that he was an Amiga user, in exchange for appearing in a promotional video for the product. Tony Hawk later used the Toaster for editing a promotional video for the TurboDuo game &quot;Lords of Thunder&quot; in 1993. The Amiga Video Toaster 4000 source code was released in 2004 by NewTek &amp; DiscreetFX.

== Video Toaster Flyer ==
For the second generation NewTek introduced the Video Toaster Flyer. The Flyer is a much more capable non-linear editing system. In addition to just processing live video signals, the Flyer makes use of hard drives to store video clips as well as audio and allow complex scripted playback. The Flyer is capable of simultaneous dual-channel playback, which allows the Toaster&#x27;s video switcher to perform transitions and other effects on video clips without the need for rendering.

The hardware component is again a card designed for the Amiga&#x27;s Zorro II expansion slot, and was primarily designed by Charles Steinkuehler. The Flyer portion of the Video Toaster/Flyer combination is a complete computer of its own, having its own microprocessor and embedded software, which was written by Marty Flickinger. Its hardware includes three embedded SCSI controllers. Two of these SCSI buses are used to store video data, and the third to store audio. The hard drives are thus connected to the Flyer directly and use a proprietary filesystem layout, rather than being connected to the Amiga&#x27;s buses and were available as regular devices using the included DOS driver. The Flyer uses a proprietary Wavelet compression algorithm known as VTASC, which was well-regarded at the time for offering better visual quality than comparable motion-JPEG-based nonlinear editing systems.

One of the card&#x27;s primary uses is for playing back LightWave 3D animations created in the Toaster.

== Video Toaster Screamer ==

In 1993, NewTek announced the &quot;Video Toaster Screamer&quot;, a parallel extension to the Toaster built by DeskStation Technology, with four motherboards, each with a MIPS R4400 CPU running at and of RAM. The Screamer accelerated the rendering of animations developed using the Toaster&#x27;s bundled Lightwave 3D software, and is supposedly 40 times as powerful as a Toaster 4000. Only a handful of test units were produced before NewTek abandoned the project and refocused on the Flyer. This cleared the way for DeskStation Technology to release their own cut-down version, the Raptor.

== Later generations ==
Later generations of the product run on Windows NT PCs. In 2004, the source code for the Amiga version was publicly released and hosted on DiscreetFX&#x27;s site Open Video Toaster. With the additions of packages such as DiscreetFX&#x27;s Millennium and thousands of wipes and backgrounds added over the years, one can still find the Video Toaster systems in use today in fully professional systems. NewTek renamed the VideoToaster to &quot;VideoToaster[2]&quot;, and later, &quot;VT[3]&quot; for the PC version and is now at version 5.3. Since VT[4] version 4.6, SDI switching is supported through an add-on called SX-SDI.

NewTek released a spin-off product, known as the TriCaster, a portable live-production, live-projection, live-streaming, and NLE system. The TriCaster packaged the VT system as a turnkey solution in a custom-designed portable PC case with video, audio and remote computer inputs and outputs on the front and back of the case. As of April 2008, four versions were in production: the basic TriCaster 2.0, TriCaster PRO 2.0, TriCaster STUDIO 2.0 and the TriCaster BROADCAST, the latter of which added SDI and AES-EBU connectivity plus a preview output capability. The TriCaster PRO FX, a model that was situated in line between the original TriCaster PRO and TriCaster STUDIO was introduced in early 2008, and was discontinued. Its feature set was added to the TriCaster PRO 2.0. TriCaster STUDIO 2.0 and TriCaster BROADCAST which uses successively larger cases than the base model TriCaster 2.0. The units within the product line above the base-model TriCaster 2.0 enables use of LiveSet 3D Live Virtual Set technology developed by NewTek, which is also found in NewTek&#x27;s venerable VT[5] Integrated Production Suite, the modern-day successor to the original Video Toaster.

In late 2009, NewTek released its high-definition version of the TriCaster, called the TriCaster XD300, a three-input HD system. It is able to accept a variety formats (NTSC, 720p, or 1080i; and on multi-standard systems, PAL) that can be mixed to downstream keys. The XD300 also features five M/E style virtual inputs, permitting up to three video sources in one source, accessible like any other input on the switcher.

At NAB Show 2010, NewTek announced its TCXD850, a rack-mountable eight-input switcher with 22 channels. It was released on July 15, 2010.

==Decline==
By 2009, the Video Toaster started to receive less attention from NewTek in the run-up to the transition to HD systems. In December 2010, the discontinuation of VT[5] was announced, marking the end of the Video Toaster as a stand-alone product. TriCaster systems based on the VT platform were still made up until August 2012, when the TriCaster STUDIO was replaced by the TriCaster 40. This officially marked the end of the Video Toaster.

<doc id="151590" wikidata="Q208138" url="?curid=151590" title="Faraday cage">
<text>A Faraday cage or Faraday shield is an enclosure used to block some electromagnetic fields. A Faraday shield may be formed by a continuous covering of conductive material, or in the case of a Faraday cage, by a mesh of such materials. Faraday cages are named after scientist Michael Faraday, who first constructed one in 1836.
Faraday cages work because an external electrical field will cause the electric charges within the cage&#x27;s conducting material to be distributed in a way that cancels out the field&#x27;s effect inside the cage. This phenomenon can be used to protect sensitive electronic equipment (for example RF receivers) from external radio frequency interference (RFI) often during testing or alignment of the device. Faraday cages are also used to protect people and equipment against electric currents such as lightning strikes and electrostatic discharges, because the cage conducts electrical current around the outside of the enclosed space and none passes through the interior.

Faraday cages cannot block stable or slowly varying magnetic fields, such as the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field (a compass will still work inside one). To a large degree, however, they shield the interior from external electromagnetic radiation if the conductor is thick enough and any holes are significantly smaller than the wavelength of the radiation. For example, certain computer forensic test procedures of electronic systems that require an environment free of electromagnetic interference can be carried out within a screened room. These rooms are spaces that are completely enclosed by one or more layers of a fine metal mesh or perforated sheet metal. The metal layers are grounded to dissipate any electric currents generated from external or internal electromagnetic fields, and thus they block a large amount of the electromagnetic interference (see also electromagnetic shielding). They provide less attenuation of outgoing transmissions than incoming: they can block electromagnetic pulse (EMP) waves from natural phenomena very effectively, but especially in upper frequencies, a tracking device may be able to penetrate from within the cage (e.g., some cell phones operate at various radio frequencies so while one frequency may not work, another one will).

The reception or transmission of radio waves, a form of electromagnetic radiation, to or from an antenna within a Faraday cage is heavily attenuated or blocked by the cage; however, a Faraday cage has varied attenuation depending on wave form, frequency, or the distance from receiver or transmitter, and receiver or transmitter power. Near-field, high-powered frequency transmissions like HF RFID are more likely to penetrate. Solid cages generally attenuate fields over a broader range of frequencies than mesh cages.

== History ==
In 1754, Jean-Antoine Nollet published an account of the cage effect in his &quot;Leçons de physique expérimentale&quot;. 

In 1755, Benjamin Franklin observed the effect by lowering an uncharged cork ball suspended on a silk thread through an opening in an electrically charged metal can. The behavior is that of a Faraday cage or shield.

In 1836, Michael Faraday observed that the excess charge on a charged conductor resided only on its exterior and had no influence on anything enclosed within it. To demonstrate this, he built a room coated with metal foil and allowed high-voltage discharges from an electrostatic generator to strike the outside of the room. He used an electroscope to show that there was no electric charge present on the inside of the room walls.

== Operation ==
=== Continuous ===
A continuous Faraday shield is a hollow conductor. Externally or internally applied electromagnetic fields produce forces on the charge carriers (usually electrons) within the conductor; the charges are redistributed accordingly due to electrostatic induction. The redistributed charges greatly reduce the voltage within the surface, to an extent depending on the capacitance; however, full cancellation does not occur.

==== Interior charges ====
If charge formula_1 is placed inside an ungrounded Faraday shield without touching the walls, the internal face of the shield becomes charged with formula_2, leading to field lines originating at the charge and extending to charges inside the inner surface of the metal. The field line paths in this inside space (to the endpoint negative charges) are dependent on the shape of the inner containment walls. Simultaneously formula_1 accumulates on the outer face of the shield. The spread of charges on the outer face is not affected by the position of the internal charge inside the enclosure, but rather determined by the shape of outer face. So for all intents and purposes, the Faraday shield generates the same static electric field on the outside that it would generate if the metal were simply charged with formula_1. See Faraday&#x27;s ice pail experiment, for example, for more details on electric field lines and the decoupling of the outside from the inside. Note that electromagnetic waves are not static charges.

If the cage is grounded, the excess charges will be neutralized as the ground connection creates an equipotential bonding between the outside of the cage and the environment, so there is no voltage between them and therefore also no field. The inner face and the inner charge will remain the same so the field is kept inside.

==== Exterior fields ====
Effectiveness of the shielding of a static electric field is largely independent of the geometry of the conductive material; however, the static magnetic fields can penetrate the shield completely.

In the case of varying electromagnetic fields, the faster the variations are (i.e., the higher the frequencies), the better the material resists magnetic field penetration. In this case the shielding also depends on the electrical conductivity, the magnetic properties of the conductive materials used in the cages, as well as their thicknesses.

A good example of the effectiveness of a Faraday shield can be obtained from considerations of skin depth. With skin depth, the current flowing is mostly in the surface, and decays exponentially with depth through the material. Because a Faraday shield has finite thickness, this determines how well the shield works; a thicker shield can attenuate electromagnetic fields better, and to a lower frequency.

=== Faraday cage ===
Faraday cages are Faraday shields that have holes in them and are therefore more complex to analyze. Whereas continuous shields essentially attenuate all wavelengths whose skin depth in the hull material is less than the thickness of the hull, the holes in a cage may permit shorter wavelengths to pass through or set up &quot;evanescent fields&quot; (oscillating fields that do not propagate as EM waves) just beyond the surface. The shorter the wavelength, the better it passes through a mesh of given size. Thus, to work well at short wavelengths (i.e., high frequencies), the holes in the cage must be smaller than the wavelength of the incident wave.

== Examples ==

* Faraday cages are routinely used in analytical chemistry to reduce noise while making sensitive measurements.
* Faraday cages, more specifically dual paired seam Faraday bags, are often used in digital forensics to prevent remote wiping and alteration of criminal digital evidence.
* Faraday bags are portable containers fabricated with metallic materials that are used to contain devices in order to protect them from electromagnetic transmissions for a wide range of applications, from enhancing digital privacy of cell telephones to protecting credit cards from RFID skimming. 
* The U.S. and NATO Tempest standards, and similar standards in other countries, include Faraday cages as part of a broader effort to provide emission security for computers.
* Automobile and airplane passenger compartments are essentially Faraday cages, protecting passengers from electric charges, such as lightning.
* Electronic components in automobiles and aircraft use Faraday cages to protect signals from interference. Sensitive components may include wireless door locks, navigation/GPS systems, and lane departure warning systems. Faraday cages and shields are also critical to vehicle infotainment systems (e.g. radio, Wi-Fi, and GPS display units), which may be designed with the capability to function as critical circuits in emergency situations.
* A booster bag (shopping bag lined with aluminum foil) acts as a Faraday cage. It is often used by shoplifters to steal RFID-tagged items. Similar containers are used to resist RFID skimming.
* Elevators and other rooms with metallic conducting frames and walls simulate a Faraday cage effect, leading to a loss of signal and &quot;dead zones&quot; for users of cellular phones, radios, and other electronic devices that require external electromagnetic signals. During training, firefighters and other first responders are cautioned that their two-way radios will probably not work inside elevators and to make allowances for that.
* Small, physical Faraday cages are used by electronics engineers during equipment testing to simulate such an environment to make sure that the device gracefully handles these conditions.
* Properly designed conductive clothing can also form a protective Faraday cage. Some electrical linemen wear Faraday suits, which allow them to work on live, high-voltage power lines without risk of electrocution. The suit prevents electric current from flowing through the body and it has no theoretical voltage limit. Linemen have successfully worked even the highest voltage (Kazakhstan&#x27;s Ekibastuz–Kokshetau line 1150 kV) lines safely.
* The scan room of a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine is designed as a Faraday cage. This prevents external RF (radio frequency) signals from being added to data collected from the patient, which would affect the resulting image. Technologists are trained to identify the characteristic artifacts created on images should the Faraday cage be damaged, such as during a thunderstorm.
* A microwave oven uses a partial Faraday shield (on five of its interior six sides) and a partial Faraday cage, consisting of a wire mesh, on the sixth side (the transparent window), to contain the electromagnetic energy within the oven and to protect the user from exposure to microwave radiation.
* Plastic bags that are impregnated with metal are used to enclose electronic toll collection devices whenever tolls should not be charged to those devices, such as during transit or when the user is paying cash.
* The shield of a screened cable, such as USB cables or the coaxial cable used for cable television, protects the internal conductors from external electrical noise and prevents the RF signals from leaking out.
* Electronic components in some music instruments, such as in an electric guitar, are protected by Faraday cages made from copper or aluminum foils that protect the instrument&#x27;s electromagnetic pickups from interference from speakers, amplifiers, stage lights, and other musical equipment.
* Some buildings, such as prisons, are constructed as a Faraday cage because they have reasons to block both incoming and outgoing cell phone calls by prisoners. The exhibit hall of the Green Bank Observatory is a Faraday cage to prevent interference with the operations of their radio telescopes.

<doc id="151591" wikidata="Q1538073" url="?curid=151591" title="River Wharfe">
<text>The River Wharfe ( ) is a river in Yorkshire, England originating within the Yorkshire Dales National Park. For much of its middle course it is the county boundary between West Yorkshire and North Yorkshire. Its valley is known as Wharfedale.

The watercourse first becomes known as the River Wharfe at the confluence of Greenfield Beck and Oughtershaw Beck at Beckermonds. Flowing initially through Langstrothdale, it then passes by, or in some cases through, Kettlewell, Grassington, Bolton Abbey, Addingham, Ilkley, Burley-in-Wharfedale, Otley, Wetherby and Tadcaster. It then flows into the River Ouse near Cawood. The section of the river from its source to around Addingham is in Upper Wharfedale and has a very different character to the river downstream.

The Wharfe is long (before it joins the Ouse), making it the 21st longest river in Britain. It is a public navigation from the weir at Tadcaster to its junction with the Ouse near Cawood and is tidal from Ulleskelf to the Ouse.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Wharfe&quot;, at least in its present form, derives from the Old Norse &quot;hverfi&quot; meaning &#x27;a bend, crook, turn&#x27;, a name implying that the river was winding. However, this Old Norse form was probably adapted from an earlier name: a Roman altar found in Ilkley is inscribed &quot;VERBEIAE SACRUM&quot; (&#x27;sacred to Verbeia&#x27;) and apparently refers to the River Wharfe (personified as a goddess). The proto-Indo-European root *&quot;wer-&quot;, relating to turning or twisting, readily picked up a &quot;-b-&quot; extension to yield words such as Latin verbena, English warp, and their cognates, which displeases those who believe the name was created in a Celtic language. Hence Patrick Sims-Williams&#x27;s association of the name with Old Irish &quot;ferb&quot; (&#x27;cattle&#x27;) and Andrew Breeze&#x27;s case for a meaning &#x27;powerful striker&#x27;.

==Course==


The river is deemed to start at the confluence of Oughtershaw Beck and Green Field Beck in Langstrothdale near Beckermonds. It flows east and south-east taking the flows from several small streams originating on Yockenthwaite Moor on the north bank and Horse Head Moor on the south bank. After Hubberholme, the river flows south past Buckden and Starbotton and then south-east past Kettlewell before flowing south again. Near Conistone are the gentle waterfalls of Scar Lash. Near Grassington, the river turns south-east over Linton Falls. South of Appletreewick, the river flows south-west for a short distance until it reaches Gill Beck and returns southward. To the north of Bolton Bridge, the river narrows and goes over waterfalls in an area known as The Strid. The river winds south and south-east towards Ilkley where it heads east through Otley and Collingham. It briefly flows north to Wetherby before turning south and then south-east through Tadcaster to the confluence with the River Ouse.

=== The Strid ===
The Strid (grid reference: SE 064565; ) is a series of waterfalls and rapids contained within a deep channel cut into the local sandstone. The River Wharfe narrows dramatically here from approximately wide, just to the north of the start of the Strid, to about wide. It is especially dangerous as both banks are undercut, and it has been the scene of a number of fatalities, including those of a honeymooning couple in 1998. The Strid walk is very popular and is accessed from the car park at Bolton Abbey.

Its name comes from the Old English &quot;stryth&quot;, meaning &#x27;turmoil&#x27;. This was later corrupted to &quot;Strid&quot;, referring to &#x27;the possibility of striding across&#x27;.

The Strid&#x27;s hazardous nature is referenced in several literary works, including &quot;&quot; by William Wordsworth, and &quot;&quot; by Gertrude Atherton.

===Linton Falls===
Linton Falls (grid reference: SE 001633) are located close to the village of Linton, just south of Grassington. There is a footbridge straddling the falls for viewing.

===Water levels===

* Low and high water levels are an average figure.

A serious flood in 1686 carried away a number of bridges and buildings.

==Natural history==

===Fauna===

More than 230 species of bird have been observed along the river valley including red grouse, stonechat, whinchat, golden plover, pied flycatcher, redstart, wood warbler, common sandpiper, grey wagtail, dipper, tawny owl, sparrowhawk, greater spotted woodpecker, nuthatch, treecreeper and, in wetter places, common snipe and woodcock, chiffchaff, willow warbler, garden warbler, and twite.

The Wharfe has populations of signal crayfish and the few white-clawed crayfish remaining are at great risk. The river is also home to a colony of fine-lined pea mussels. The creature is mostly congregated in rivers in Wales and central and southern England; the presence of the mussels in the Wharfe has been noted as a &quot;considerable outpost&quot;.

There are populations of rabbit, red fox, grey squirrel, otter, water voles and deer.

===Flora===

Ferns found here include wall rue, maidenhair spleenwort, brittle bladder-fern, Hart&#x27;s-tongue and hard shield-fern. In Upper Wharfedale the scars and screes support a range of plants including the alpine cinquefoil and hoary whitlowgrass. Also to be found are lesser meadow-rue, goldenrod, scabious and bloody crane&#x27;s-bill with, to a lesser extent, mountain melick, limestone fern, wood crane&#x27;s-bill and melancholy thistle, green spleenwort, wall lettuce and hairy stonecrop.

Lower down the valley, species including alpine cinquefoil, lily-of-the-valley, mountain melick and herb paris, blue sesleria, common valerian and wild angelica. The limestone outcrops have uncommon species including rock whitebeam and Solomon&#x27;s seal as well as bird&#x27;s-eye primrose, butterwort, rockrose, dropwort and limestone bedstraw.

The limestone pavements of the area are a habitat for several species usually confined to woodlands, such as dog&#x27;s mercury, wood anemone and ramsons. Rarer species to be found in the grikes include baneberry and downy currant. Ferns in the moist grikes include rigid buckler-fern. Also to be found are alternate-leaved golden saxifrage, reed canary-grass and stone bramble.

Some of the inaccessible cliffs are home to ledge dwelling flora including mosses and liverworts, such as red leskea, sharp rock-bristle and the very rare &quot;Zygodon gracilis&quot;. The ledges also support woodrush, polypody and water avens, purple saxifrage, yellow saxifrage, hoary whitlowgrass and roseroot.
Blue moor-grass can also be found, with sheep&#x27;s-fescue and herbs such as thyme, salad burnet and common rock-rose. There is wild thyme, common milkwort, fairy flax, bird&#x27;s-foot trefoil, autumn gentian, harebell, eyebright.

Species of tree and shrub include ash, downy birch, hazel, hawthorn, yew and rowan. In the woods shrubs such as wild privet and spindle can be found. More rare is dark red helleborine.

==Geology==

Upper Wharfedale is an area whose rocks date from the Early Carboniferous period and lies north-west of Burnsall. Its main features are the Great Scar Limestone which forms a base to the overlying Yoredale Beds, a deep strata of hard limestones, sandstones and shale. These have been slightly tilted, toward the east. To the south-east of the area is the Millstone Grit laid down in the Late Carboniferous period, and covered by heather moorland, hard crags and tors.

Weathering of the Yoredale Beds has produced a stepped profile to the valley sides, consisting of a shelf of limestone, sometimes grassy but often displaying such karst features as limestone pavement, gorges and sinkholes. During the last ice age, the local ice cap at the head of the Dales fed glaciers to produce the classic U-shaped profiles seen today.

Where the river valley changes course into Lower Wharfedale, the change of underlying rock can be seen in the darker stone in the field walls. The Millstone Grit outcrops at the Cow and Calf Rocks near Ilkley form a rolling dissected plateau. Due to the impermeable nature of the rock, blanket bogs and mires form, and drier areas have wet and dry heaths and acid grasslands.

Coarse sandstones in the area are known as Addingham Edge and Bramhope Grits. The Otley Shell Beds become exposed at Otley Chevin. At Great Dib Wood the Otley Shell Bed is sandwiched between two Namurian sandstones.

Glacial lakes once filled Lower Wharfedale in which were deposited sand and gravel. These deposits were extracted and now form the basis of the Otley Wetland Reserve, and Ben Rhydding and Knotford Nook gravel pits.

==History==

The name Wharfe appears to be recorded in the form &quot;Verbeiae&quot; on a Roman inscription at Ilkley, dedicated to Verbeia, thought to be the tutelary goddess of the river. The name is probably of Brythonic origin, from a root meaning &quot;winding&quot;. Later forms of the name were probably influenced by the Old Norse &quot;hwerfi&quot;, meaning &quot;bend&quot;.

Iron Age fields and hut circles can still be seen in outline on the hills above Grassington and Kettlewell. The Romans built a road through Wharfedale that went over Stake Moss into neighbouring Wensleydale. The local British tribe of Brigantes were subdued by the Romans in AD 74. The Romans mined lead in the hills on Greenhow Hill overlooking Appletreewick until AD 410. After AD 620 the Romano-Britons were joined by Angles and increased the amount of forest clearing to establish fields for crops and animals. These were overrun by Danes initially before they too settled to farming near Burnsall and Thorpe. Vikings then settled the area in the 10th century, lending their language to some of the names of hamlets and landscape features of Upper Wharfedale, especially near the head of the valley. During Anglo-Saxon times, large estates were established and the River Wharfe and its valley came under the protection of Earl Edwin of Bolton-in-Craven. After the Norman invasion, the lands were given to Robert Romilly.

In medieval times low intensity methods were used to produce both crops and livestock but the great monasteries of Fountains, Rievaulx and Bolton Priory had large sheep flocks and sold their wool on the European market. In 1155, Alice de Romilly donated land for the establishment of Bolton Priory and land at Kilnsey to Fountains Abbey. The monasteries helped develop vast sheep farms and the founding of drove roads, which can still be seen and walked today. The success of the monasteries was also responsible for the growth of the market towns of Grassington and Kettlewell.

When the monasteries were dissolved in 1539, and wool prices fell, many tenant farmers took to cattle and sheep rearing. However, at the end of the 17th century there was still small-scale arable production. By the early 19th century there was a demand for food from the growing industrial towns and farmers and many farms began to produce milk from the lower lands and use the higher fells for sheep.

On 5 July 2014, the Tour de France Stage 1 from Leeds to Harrogate passed through Wharfedale along roads running close to the river. The route in Wharfedale started near the official start at Harewood and ended just after Buckden when the competitors turned to climb over Kidstones Pass near Cray.

The river has featured in films. In 1992, the town of Grassington was used as a filming location for &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;. The 2003 film, &quot;Calendar Girls&quot;, was filmed at several locations in the river valley including &quot;Ilkley Moor&quot;, &quot;Buckden&quot;, &quot;Burnsall&quot;, &quot;Kettlewell&quot; and &quot;Kilnsey&quot;.

==Economy==

During the 1990s there had been an increase in second home ownership, particularly in the Upper Wharfedale area. The 1991 census had shown 13% of homes in the Craven district were classified as second properties. The 2001 census showed that the figure for Upper Wharfedale was 15%, but it had dropped to only 7% by 2011.

Upper Wharfedale has been traditionally associated with farming, but there has been a change in the numbers and types of employment. Whilst there were declines in the number of people in this industry, farming accounted directly for 9.16% of employment in 2001 but this had increased to 11.27% by 2011.

Lead mining was once the main industry in Wharfedale. From the 17th century to the late 19th century it employed hundreds of men and boys, exploiting the veins in the limestone at Greenhow, Hebden, Grassington, Linton and Conistone, Appletreewick and elsewhere. The heaps of mining waste remain, contaminated with lead, and on which little will grow. The few plants that will are known as &#x27;lead plants&#x27; such as spring sandwort and alpine penny-cress.

Tourism is important to the rural economy of Wharfedale and there are many short, mid and long-distance walks, with clear waymarkers. Other outdoor activities take place such as rock climbing, most notably at Kilnsey Crag, kayaking and canoeing. Other activities include cycling, mountain biking, horse riding and caving. Several long-distance walks pass near or over the river:

* Dales Way (follows the river valley from &quot;Beckermonds&quot; to &quot;Ilkley&quot;)
* Lady Anne&#x27;s Way (enters the valley near &quot;Hubberholme&quot; and leaves to the west of &quot;Bolton Abbey&quot;)
* Inn Way to the Yorkshire Dales (part of walk from &quot;Grassington&quot; to &quot;Buckden&quot;)
* The Way of the Roses (part of the cycle route from &quot;Appletreewick&quot; to &quot;Thorpe&quot;)

The Wharfe has two hydro-electric generating plants; Burley (at Greenholme Mill in Burley in Wharfedale), which opened in August 2011 and Linton Falls, which opened in March 2012.

<text>NewTek, Inc., was a San Antonio, Texasbased hardware and software company that produced live and post-production video tools and visual imaging software for personal computers. The company was founded in 1985 in Topeka, Kansas, United States, by Tim Jenison and Paul Montgomery. On April 1, 2019, it was announced that NewTek would be acquired by Vizrt.

==Products==

In 2005, NewTek introduced TriCaster, a product that merges live video switching, broadcast graphics, virtual sets, special effects, audio mixing, recording, social media publishing, and web streaming into an integrated, portable and compact appliance. TriCaster was announced at DEMO@15 and then launched at the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) in 2005. At NAB 2006, NewTek announced TriCaster PRO, which introduced professional video, audio connections, and virtual sets (using proprietary NewTek LiveSet technology) to the TriCaster line.

At NAB 2007, NewTek introduced TriCaster STUDIO, the first TriCaster to support six cameras. At NAB 2008, NewTek introduced TriCaster BROADCAST, the first model to deliver SDI video and audio support. In early 2009, NewTek introduced 3PLAY, a portable multi-channel HD/SD slow-motion replay system. At NAB 2009, NewTek introduced TriCaster TCXD300, the first high-definition TriCaster. At NAB 2010, NewTek introduced TriCaster TCXD850, a 22-channel high-definition model in a rack mount form factor. The TCXD850 won four industry awards: the Winners Circle Award, STAR, Vidy, and Black Diamond awards from EventDV, TV Technology, Videography, and DV magazines, respectively, at NAB 2010.

In 2004, NewTek released the source code to some of their Amiga Platform products through DiscreetFX.

In 2015, NewTek announced the Network Device Interface (NDI) protocol which allows applications and devices to transport high-quality, low-latency video over gigabit Ethernet networks. The protocol was available for public products starting in early 2016. In 2017, version 3 of the protocol was released, which adds multicast support and a high-efficiency mode called NDI-HX.

==Company history==

The company&#x27;s first products included DigiView in 1986 and DigiPaint, both for the Commodore Amiga personal computer.

DigiView was the first full-color video digitizer and added slow-scan digitizing capabilities to the Amiga platform allowing images to be imported at low cost before modern image scanning technology was widely available. Consisting of an input module that allowed the connection of a standard black-and-white video camera (security cameras were popularly used), greyscale images could be captured to the Amiga. With the addition of a color wheel, full-color images could be captured by rotating the wheel&#x27;s red, green, and blue segments in front of the lens and capturing the same image three times, once through each filter. This could be done manually or with a motorized accessory. The software combined the color information from the three images into one color image. According to the company, DigiView sold over 100,000 units.

The Amiga hardware included the ability to display 4096 colors on the screen simultaneously, and DigiPaint allowed graphic artists to draw with a variety of tools in that full-color space at a time when IBM PCs were typically limited to between 4 and 16 colors. The DigiPaint product offered the unique capability of editing and painting on images in the Amiga&#x27;s unique Hold-And-Modify high color mode in real-time.

The company found widespread fame and started the desktop-video revolution by releasing the Video Toaster, an innovative system for low-cost video switching and post production. The company was featured in high-profile magazine articles such as &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and was also featured on &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot;. In the early 1990s, a proliferation of video effects in television shows is directly attributable to the Video Toaster&#x27;s effect of lowering the cost of video-processing hardware from the $100K range to the $4K range.

In addition, the company developed LightWave 3D, a 3D modeling, rendering, and animation system, which has been used extensively in television and film. For example, the television series &quot;Babylon 5&quot;, which eschewed models for space scenes, was 100% CGI from the first episode using the NewTek software.

The fame of Video Toaster extended beyond the product: the company&#x27;s founder, Tim Jenison, and its vice president, Paul Montgomery, were presented as a new breed of entrepreneurs running a different kind of company.

Jenison and Montgomery eventually split, with Montgomery leaving to help form a new company called Play, Inc., which ultimately ceased operations after Montgomery&#x27;s untimely death.

In 1997, the company moved to San Antonio, Texas, United States.

In 2005, NewTek founder, Tim Jenison, was inducted into the San Antonio Inventors Hall of Fame as the &quot;Father of Desktop Video.&quot;

In April 2019, NewTek was acquired by Vizrt for a sum of US$95.25 million, disclosed in Vizrt&#x27;s Q2 report.

==Notable personalities==

===Tim Jenison===
A founder of the company is Tim Jenison. In addition to his efforts at NewTek, with a personal interest in the artwork and the skill of the Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer, it eventually led to an investigation of the artist&#x27;s technique and a feature film documentary entitled &quot;Tim&#x27;s Vermeer&quot;. The movie was released in early 2014, and was directed by Teller, produced by Penn &amp; Teller, and distributed by Sony Pictures Classics.

===Kiki Stockhammer===
A spokesperson for the NewTek products, Kiki Stockhammer provided many demonstration images that were used in introductory videos, as well as providing her silhouette for a number of transition effects included with the Video Toaster.

<doc id="151594" wikidata="Q19718" url="?curid=151594" title="River Ouse, Yorkshire">
<text>The River Ouse ( ) is a river in North Yorkshire, England. Hydrologically, the river is a continuation of the River Ure, and the combined length of the River Ure and River Ouse makes it, at , the sixth-longest river of the United Kingdom and (including the Ure) the longest to flow entirely in one county. The length of the Ouse alone is about but the total length of the river is disputed.

It is a matter of opinion as to whether the River Ouse is formed at the confluence of the River Ure and the much-smaller Ouse Gill Beck at Cuddy Shaw Reach near Linton-on-Ouse, about six miles downstream of the confluence of the River Swale with the River Ure. An alternative opinion is recorded in a publication published in &quot;The Yorkshire Post&quot; in a series dated 1891, written and illustrated by Tom Bradley. His description and bird&#x27;s-eye-view maps—specifically in his account of the River Swale—suggests that the River Ouse starts at the confluence of the Swale and the Ure. His narrative states that the Ouse has no specific source, simply flowing from the stated confluence until it runs into the Humber at the confluence of the Ouse and Trent.

Continuing the path of the Ouse downstream from Linton-on-Ouse, it then flows through the city of York and the nearby towns of Selby and Goole before joining with the River Trent at Trent Falls, near the village of Faxfleet, then entering the Humber estuary.

The Ouse&#x27;s system of tributaries includes the Derwent, Aire, Don, Hipper, Wharfe, Rother, Nidd, Swale, Ure and Foss. Together they drain a large part of the Pennines, and much of the Yorkshire Dales and North York Moors.

The Ouse valley is a wide, flat plain; heavy rainfall higher in the river&#x27;s drainage basin can bring severe flooding to settlements. In recent years York, Selby and villages in between have been flooded.

== Sources ==

The traditional source of the Ouse is in the village of Great Ouseburn, and is marked by a stone column reading &quot;OUSE RIVER HEAD... OUSEGILL SPRING Ft. YORK 13 miles BOROUGHBRIDGE 4 miles&quot;. The site is from the present course of Ouse Gill Beck, a small stream earlier known as &quot;Usekeld Beck&quot;, meaning &quot;Spring or source of the Ouse&quot; (from Old Norse &quot;kelda&quot; &quot;spring&quot;).

The start of the Ouse is now considered to be the point where Ouse Gill Beck joins the River Ure, south-east of Great Ouseburn.

==Etymology==
The name was first recorded in about 780 as &quot;Usa&quot;. It has been speculated that the name is of Romano-Brittonic (Celtic) origin, from an assumed word &quot;udso-&quot;, assumed to be derived from the Indo-European root &quot;wed-&quot;, meaning &quot;water&quot;. Alternatively, &#x27;Isaf&#x27; and &#x27;Ychaf&#x27; are common form of place names in modern Welsh (Romano Britonic&#x27;s successor) meaning &#x27;upper&#x27; and &#x27;lower&#x27;. The letter &#x27;U&#x27; forms an &#x27;I&#x27; sound in Welsh. Other sources prefer a Proto-Celtic origin.

It has been suggested that the Ouse was once known as the &#x27;Ure&#x27;, but there seems to be no supporting evidence for this claim. The suggestion that the name derives from the Romano-British name of the Ure, assumed to be &quot;Isurā&quot; from the Roman name for Aldborough, and over time evolved into &quot;Isis&quot; and finally the Saxon &quot;Ouse&quot;, would go some way to explaining how the little tributary Ouse Gill Beck usurps the name of the much larger River Ure. However the form Ouse is little changed from the eighth century.

== Navigation ==
The Ouse is navigable throughout its length. Seagoing vessels use the river as far as Howdendyke. The inland port of Goole also accepts seagoing vessels on a regular basis. Goole also offers access to the Aire and Calder Navigation. At Selby there is access to the Selby Canal. The river is tidal up to Naburn; the resultant tidal bore is known locally as &quot;the Aegir&quot;.

At Naburn there is a weir with locks, so that boats of length and beam can reach York. Above York there is another weir with locks at Linton-on-Ouse, which allows boats of length to proceed to the River Ure Navigation. Adjacent to the lock is Linton Lock Hydro plant. This is capable of generating enough electricity to power 450 homes.

The navigation authority is Associated British Ports from Trent Falls to Goole railway swing bridge at Skelton, and the Canal &amp; River Trust upstream from there.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, there was considerable commercial traffic on the river, mainly from Selby, which then had a custom house, downstream. After the 1826 opening of the Aire and Calder Navigation, most traffic became concentrated on the port of Goole. This continues, although the coal trade which formed the backbone of the river trade has ceased.

==Flooding==
With both the Ouse and the Foss running through York, flooding has been a problem throughout its documented history. Flooding is known to have occurred in 1263, 1316, 1564, 1625, 1638, 1947, 1978, 1982, 2000, 2007, 2010 and 2015. In November 2000, the floods reached a height of above sea level, whilst over the Christmas period of 2015, the level reached . A barrier was installed on the mouth of the River Foss in York city centre in 1989, so that when the Ouse was in flood, water would not run upstream of the Foss and flood the city. Flooding occurs typically due to heavy rainfall further upstream in the catchment area of the Ouse (Swale, Ure, Nidd) which covers , (the Foss catchment is .

Low-lying land around the villages of Kelfield, Riccall, Wistow and Cawood, which are south of York, are designated as a floodplain, though it can cause damage to properties there. In February 2020, it was estimated that over of fields were under floodwater, making the size comparable to that of Windermere, England&#x27;s largest natural lake.

As the Ouse is tidal as far inland as Naburn, this means that flooding can occur due to heavy rainwater or tidal surges in the downstream settlements of Selby and Goole.

<doc id="151603" wikidata="Q215359" url="?curid=151603" title="Dean Martin">
<text>Dean Martin (born Dino Paul Crocetti; June 7, 1917 – December 25, 1995) was an American singer, actor, and comedian. Nicknamed the &quot;King of Cool&quot;, he is regarded as one of the most popular entertainers of the mid-20th century. Martin gained his career breakthrough together with comedian Jerry Lewis, billed as Martin and Lewis, in 1946. They performed in nightclubs and later had numerous appearances on radio and television and in films.

Following an acrimonious ending of the partnership in 1956, Martin pursued a solo career as a performer and actor. He established himself as a singer, recording numerous contemporary songs as well as standards from the Great American Songbook. Martin became one of the most popular acts in Las Vegas and was known for his friendship with fellow artists Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis Jr., who together with several others formed the Rat Pack.

Starting in 1965, Martin was the host of the television variety program &quot;The Dean Martin Show&quot;, which centered on Martin&#x27;s singing and comedic talents and was characterized by his relaxed, easy-going demeanor. From 1974 to 1984, Martin was roastmaster on &quot;The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast&quot;, a popular show that drew celebrities, comedians and politicians. Throughout his career, Martin performed on concert stages, in nightclubs and audio recordings and appeared in 85 film and television productions and sold 12 million records in the United States alone, over 50 million worldwide. Martin&#x27;s best-known songs include &quot;Ain&#x27;t That a Kick in the Head?&quot;, &quot;Memories Are Made of This&quot;, &quot;That&#x27;s Amore&quot;, &quot;Everybody Loves Somebody&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re Nobody till Somebody Loves You&quot;, &quot;Sway&quot;, and &quot;Volare&quot;.

==Early life==

Martin was born Dino Paul Crocetti on June 7, 1917, in Steubenville, Ohio, to Italian father Gaetano Alfonso Crocetti (1894–1967) and Italian-American mother Angela Crocetti (; 1897–1966). Gaetano, who was a barber, was originally from Montesilvano, Pescara, and Angela was born December 18, 1897, in Fernwood, Ohio. Angela&#x27;s father, Domenico Barra, emigrated from Monasterolo, Bergamo. Martin had an older brother Guglielmo &quot;William&quot; Antonio Crocetti (1916–1968). At 15, Martin billed himself as &quot;Kid Crochet&quot;. His prizefighting earned him a broken nose (later straightened), a scarred lip, many broken knuckles (a result of not being able to afford tape used to wrap boxers&#x27; hands), and a bruised body. Of his 12 bouts, Martin said that he &quot;won all but 11.&quot; For a time, he shared a New York City apartment with Sonny King, who was also starting in show business and had little money. The two reportedly charged people to watch them bare-knuckle box each other in their apartment, fighting until one was knocked out. Martin knocked out King in the first round of an amateur boxing match. Martin gave up boxing to work as a roulette stickman and croupier in an illegal casino behind a tobacco shop, where he had started as a stock boy. At the same time, he sang with local bands, calling himself &quot;Dino Martini&quot; (after the Metropolitan Opera tenor Nino Martini). Martin got his break working for the Ernie McKay Orchestra. He sang in a crooning style influenced by Harry Mills of The Mills Brothers and Perry Como. By late 1940, Martin had begun singing for Cleveland bandleader Sammy Watkins, who suggested he change his name to Dean Martin. He stayed with Watkins until at least May 1943. By fall 1943, Martin had begun performing in New York. He was drafted into the U.S. Army during World War II but was discharged after 14 months due to a hernia.

In October 1941, Martin married Elizabeth &quot;Betty&quot; Anne McDonald in Cleveland, and the couple had an apartment in Cleveland Heights for a while. They eventually had four children before divorcing in 1949.

==Career==
===Teaming with Jerry Lewis===
Martin attracted the attention of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Columbia Pictures, but a Hollywood contract was not forthcoming. Martin met comic Jerry Lewis at the Belmont Plaza Hotel in New York City in August 1944. According to Lewis, the two men met initially in the lobby, where Martin approached him and said, &quot;Hey, I saw your act, you&#x27;re a funny kid.&quot; Martin was singing at the hotel&#x27;s famous Glass Hat Club at the time and the two happened to be on the same bill. Martin and Lewis formed a fast friendship which led to their participation in each other&#x27;s acts and the formation of a music-comedy team. Their debut together occurred at Atlantic City&#x27;s 500 Club on July 24, 1946, and they were not well received. The owner, Skinny D&#x27;Amato, warned them that if they did not come up with a better act for their second show that night, they would be fired. Huddling in the alley behind the club, Lewis and Martin agreed to &quot;go for broke&quot;, they divided their act between songs, skits, and ad-libbed material. Martin sang and Lewis dressed as a busboy, dropping plates and making a shambles of Martin&#x27;s performance and the club&#x27;s decorum until Lewis was chased from the room as Martin pelted him with bread rolls.

They performed slapstick, reeled off old vaudeville jokes and did whatever else popped into their heads; the audience laughed. This success led to a series of well-paying engagements on the Eastern seaboard, culminating in a run at New York&#x27;s Copacabana. The act consisted of Lewis interrupting and heckling Martin while he was trying to sing, with the two ultimately chasing each other around the stage. The secret, both said, is that they ignored the audience and played to each other. The team made its television debut on the first broadcast of CBS-TV network&#x27;s &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; (then called &quot;The Toast Of The Town&quot;) on June 20, 1948, with composers Rodgers and Hammerstein also appearing. Hoping to improve their act, the two hired young comedy writers Norman Lear and Ed Simmons to write their bits. With the assistance of both Lear and Simmons, the two would take their act beyond nightclubs.

A radio series began in 1949, the year Martin and Lewis signed with Paramount producer Hal B. Wallis as comedy relief for the movie &quot;My Friend Irma&quot;. Their agent, Abby Greshler, negotiated one of Hollywood&#x27;s best deals: although they received only $75,000 between them for their films with Wallis, Martin and Lewis were free to do one outside film a year, which they would co-produce through their own York Productions.

They also controlled their club, record, radio, and television appearances, and through these they earned millions of dollars. In &quot;Dean &amp; Me&quot;, Lewis calls Martin one of the great comic geniuses of all time. They were friends, as well, with Lewis acting as best man when Martin remarried in 1949.

But harsh comments from critics, as well as frustration with the similarity of Martin and Lewis movies, which producer Hal Wallis refused to change, led to Martin&#x27;s dissatisfaction. He put less enthusiasm into the work.

Martin soldiered on during the production of the Martin &amp; Lewis feature &quot;3 Ring Circus&quot; (1954), when a publicity photo of Martin, Lewis, and actress Sheree North was published on the cover of &quot;Look&quot; magazine. Martin was shocked to see Lewis and North pictured but Martin cropped off the page. The team&#x27;s publicity manager, Jack Keller, remembered Martin walking on the set &quot;with a copy of &quot;Look&quot; and he threw it right in my face and called me every vile name he could think of.&quot; Lewis recalled Martin &quot;saying he was fed up to the ears playing a stooge. One morning he arrived an hour late on the set and stared daggers at me. &#x27;Anytime you wanta call it quits, just let me know.&#x27;&quot; Martin was chagrined by the situation: &quot;Why the hell should I come in on time? There&#x27;s not a damn thing for me to do.&quot;

In later years Martin reflected on the working conditions during &quot;3 Ring Circus&quot;: &quot;There was no sense of me being in that picture at all. The picture was on 35 minutes before I sang one song. Then it was an old one, &#x27;It&#x27;s a Big, Wide Wonderful World&#x27;, and I sang it to animals.&quot;

Martin lived up to his contract and remained with Lewis until the agreement expired on July 25, 1956, 10 years to the day from the first teaming.

===Solo career===

Martin&#x27;s first solo film, &quot;Ten Thousand Bedrooms&quot; (1957), was a box-office failure. Although &quot;Volare&quot; reached number 15 in the U.S. and number 2 in the UK, the era of the pop crooner was waning with the advent of rock and roll. Martin wanted to become a dramatic actor, known for more than slapstick comedy films. Though offered a fraction of his former salary to co-star in a war drama, &quot;The Young Lions&quot; (1958), Martin&#x27;s part would be with Marlon Brando and Montgomery Clift. Tony Randall already had the part, but talent agency MCA realized that with this film, Martin would become a triple threat: they could make money from his work in nightclubs, films, and records. Randall was paid off to relinquish the role, Martin replaced him and the film turned out to be the beginning of Martin&#x27;s comeback. He starred alongside Frank Sinatra for the first time in the Vincente Minnelli drama, &quot;Some Came Running&quot; (1958).

By the mid-1960s, Martin was a movie, recording, television, and nightclub star. He was known as Dude in &quot;Rio Bravo&quot; (1959), directed by Howard Hawks and also starring John Wayne and singer Ricky Nelson. Martin teamed again with Wayne in &quot;The Sons of Katie Elder&quot; (1965), cast as brothers. In 1960, Martin was cast in the film version of the Judy Holliday stage musical comedy &quot;Bells Are Ringing&quot;. He won a Golden Globe nomination for his performance in the 1960 film comedy &quot;Who Was That Lady?&quot;, but continued to seek dramatic roles, portraying a Southern politician in 1961&#x27;s &quot;Ada&quot;, and starring in 1963&#x27;s screen adaptation of an intense stage drama, &quot;Toys in the Attic&quot;, opposite Geraldine Page, as well as in 1970&#x27;s drama &quot;Airport&quot; with Burt Lancaster, a huge box-office success.

Sinatra and Martin teamed up for several more movies, the crime caper &quot;Ocean&#x27;s 11&quot;, the musical &quot;Robin and the 7 Hoods&quot;, and the Western comedies &quot;Sergeants 3&quot; and &quot;4 for Texas&quot;, with their Rat Pack pals such as Sammy Davis, Jr., Peter Lawford, and Joey Bishop, as well as a romantic comedy, &quot;Marriage on the Rocks&quot;. Martin also co-starred with Shirley MacLaine in a number of films, including &quot;Some Came Running&quot;, &quot;Artists and Models&quot;, &quot;Career&quot;, &quot;All in a Night&#x27;s Work&quot;, and &quot;What a Way to Go!&quot; He played a satiric variation of his own womanizing persona as Las Vegas singer &quot;Dino&quot; in Billy Wilder&#x27;s comedy &quot;Kiss Me, Stupid&quot; (1964) with Kim Novak, and Martin poked fun at his image in films such as the &quot;Matt Helm&quot; spy spoofs of the 1960s, in which he was a co-producer. In the third Matt Helm film &quot;The Ambushers&quot; (1967), Helm, about to be executed, receives a last cigarette and tells the provider, &quot;I&#x27;ll remember you from the great beyond&quot;, continuing &quot;sotto voce&quot;, &quot;somewhere around Steubenville, I hope&quot;.

As a singer, Martin copied the styles of Harry Mills (of the Mills Brothers), Bing Crosby, and Perry Como until he developed his own and could hold his own in duets with Sinatra and Crosby. Like Sinatra, Martin could not read music, but he recorded 35 studio albums and over 550 songs. His signature tune, &quot;Everybody Loves Somebody&quot;, knocked the Beatles&#x27; &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; off number one in the United States in 1964. This was followed by &quot;The Door is Still Open to My Heart&quot;, which reached number six that year. Elvis Presley was said to have been a fan of Martin, and patterned his performance of &quot;Love Me Tender&quot; after Martin&#x27;s style. Martin, like Elvis, was influenced by country music. By 1965, some of Martin&#x27;s albums, such as &quot;Dean &quot;Tex&quot; Martin Rides Again&quot;, &quot;Houston,&quot; &quot;Welcome to My World&quot;, and &quot;Gentle on My Mind&quot;, were composed of country and western songs by artists such as Johnny Cash, Merle Haggard, and Buck Owens. Martin hosted country performers on his TV show and was named &quot;Man Of the Year&quot; by the Country Music Association in 1966. The final album of his recording career was 1983&#x27;s &quot;The Nashville Sessions&quot;.

The image of Martin as a Vegas entertainer in a tuxedo has been an enduring one. &quot;Ain&#x27;t That a Kick in the Head?&quot;, a song Martin performed in &quot;Ocean&#x27;s 11&quot;, did not become a hit at the time, but has enjoyed a revival in the media and pop culture and has been his most frequently played song in media for two decades. For three decades, Martin was among the most popular acts in Las Vegas, where he sang and was a comedian, benefiting from the decade of comedy with Lewis. Martin&#x27;s daughter, Gail, also sang in Vegas and on many TV shows including his, co-hosting his summer replacement series on NBC. Daughter Deana Martin continues to perform, as did youngest son Ricci Martin until his death in August 2016. Eldest son Craig was a producer on Martin&#x27;s television show and daughter Claudia was an actress in films such as &quot;For Those Who Think Young&quot;. Though thought of as promiscuous, Martin spent much time with his family; as second wife Jeanne put it, prior to the couple&#x27;s divorce, &quot;He was home every night for dinner.&quot;

===Rat Pack===

As Martin&#x27;s solo career grew, he and Frank Sinatra became friends. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Martin and Sinatra, along with friends Joey Bishop, Peter Lawford, and Sammy Davis Jr., formed the Rat Pack, so-called after an earlier group of social friends, the Holmby Hills Rat Pack centered on Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, of which Sinatra had been a member (The Martin-Sinatra-Davis-Lawford-Bishop group referred to themselves as &quot;The Summit&quot; or &quot;The Clan&quot; and never as &quot;The Rat Pack&quot;, although this has remained their identity in popular imagination). The men made films together, formed part of the Hollywood social scene, and were politically influential (through Lawford&#x27;s marriage to Patricia Kennedy, sister of President John F. Kennedy).

The Rat Pack was legendary for its Las Vegas Strip performances. For example, the marquee at the Sands Hotel might read &quot;DEAN MARTIN—MAYBE FRANK—MAYBE SAMMY&quot;. Their appearances were valuable because the city would flood with wealthy gamblers. Their act (always in tuxedo) consisted of each singing individual numbers, duets and trios, along with seemingly improvised slapstick and chatter. In the socially charged 1960s, their jokes revolved around adult themes, such as Sinatra&#x27;s womanizing and Martin&#x27;s drinking, as well as Davis&#x27;s race and religion. Sinatra and Martin supported the civil rights movement and refused to perform in clubs that would not allow black American or Jewish performers. Posthumously, the Rat Pack has experienced a popular revival, inspiring the George Clooney/Brad Pitt &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Trilogy&quot;.

===&quot;The Dean Martin Show&quot;===
In 1965, Martin launched his weekly NBC comedy-variety series, &quot;The Dean Martin Show&quot;, which ran for 264 episodes until 1974. He won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Television Series Musical or Comedy in 1966 and was nominated again the following three years. The show exploited his image as a carefree boozer. Martin capitalized on his laid-back persona of the half-drunk crooner, inappropriately hitting on women, and making snappy if slurred remarks about fellow celebrities during his roasts. During an interview on the British TV documentary &quot;Wine, Women and Song&quot;, aired in 1983, Martin stated, perhaps tongue-in-cheek, that he had someone record them on cassette tape so he could listen to them. Martin&#x27;s TV show was a success. The show&#x27;s loose format featured quick-witted improvisation from Martin and his weekly guests. This prompted a battle between Martin and NBC censors, who insisted on more scrutiny of the content. He later had trouble with NBC for his off-the-cuff use of obscene Italian phrases, which brought complaints from viewers who spoke the language. The show was often in the Top Ten. Martin, appreciative of the show&#x27;s producer, his friend Greg Garrison, made a handshake deal giving Garrison, a pioneer TV producer in the 1950s, 50% of the show. However, the validity of that ownership is the subject of a lawsuit brought by NBCUniversal.

Despite Martin&#x27;s reputation as a drinker—perpetuated via his vanity license plate &quot;DRUNKY&quot;—his alcohol use was quite disciplined. Martin was the first to call it a night and, when not on tour or on a film location, liked to go home to see his family. Martin borrowed the lovable-drunk shtick from Joe E. Lewis, but his convincing portrayals of heavy boozers in &quot;Some Came Running&quot; and Howard Hawks&#x27; &quot;Rio Bravo&quot; led to unsubstantiated claims of alcoholism. Martin starred in and co-produced four Matt Helm superspy comedy adventures during this time, as well as a number of Westerns. By the early 1970s, &quot;The Dean Martin Show&quot; was still earning solid ratings, and although he was no longer a Top 40 hitmaker, his record albums continued to sell. He found a way to make his passion for golf profitable by offering a signature line of golf balls, and the Dean Martin Tucson Open was an event on golf&#x27;s PGA Tour from 1972 to 1975. At his death, Martin was reportedly the single largest minority shareholder of RCA stock.

Martin began reducing his schedule once comfortable financially. The final (1973–1974) season of his variety show was retooled into one of celebrity roasts, requiring less involvement. In the roasts, Martin and his panel of pals made fun of a variety of popular entertainment, athletic, and political figures. After the show&#x27;s cancellation, NBC continued to air &quot;The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast&quot; as a series of TV specials through 1984.

===Later career===

For nearly a decade, Martin had recorded as many as four albums a year for Reprise Records. Martin recorded his final Reprise album, &quot;Once in a While&quot;, in 1974, which was not issued until 1978. His final recordings were made for Warner Bros. Records. &quot;The Nashville Sessions&quot; was released in 1983, from which he had a hit with &quot;(I Think That I Just Wrote) My First Country Song&quot;, which was recorded with Conway Twitty and made a respectable showing on the country charts. A follow-up single, &quot;L.A. Is My Home&quot;/&quot;Drinking Champagne&quot;, came in 1985. The 1974 film drama &quot;Mr. Ricco&quot; marked Martin&#x27;s final starring role, in which he played a criminal defense lawyer.

In 1972, Martin filed for divorce from his second wife, Jeanne. A week later, his business partnership with the Riviera hotel in Las Vegas dissolved amid reports of the casino&#x27;s refusal to agree to Martin&#x27;s request to perform only once a night. Martin joined the MGM Grand Hotel and Casino, where he was the featured performer on the hotel&#x27;s opening night of December 23, 1973, and Martin&#x27;s contract required him to star in a film (&quot;Mr. Ricco&quot;) for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios.

Martin also made a public reconciliation with Lewis on his partner&#x27;s Labor Day telethon, benefiting the Muscular Dystrophy Association, in September 1976. Sinatra shocked Lewis by bringing Martin out on stage and as the two men embraced, the audience gave them a standing ovation and the phones lit up, resulting in one of the telethon&#x27;s most profitable years up to that time. Lewis later reported the event was one of the three most memorable of his life. Lewis quipped, &quot;So, you working?&quot; Martin, playing drunk, replied that he was appearing &quot;at the &#x27;Meggum (meaning the MGM Grand Hotel). This, with the death of Martin&#x27;s son Dean Paul Martin more than a decade later, helped bring the two men together. They maintained a quiet friendship, but only performed again once, on Martin&#x27;s 72nd birthday in 1989.

Martin returned to films briefly with appearances in the star-laden, critically panned but commercially successful &quot;The Cannonball Run&quot; and its sequel &quot;Cannonball Run II&quot;. He also had a minor hit single with &quot;Since I Met You Baby&quot; and made his first music video, which appeared on MTV and was created by Martin&#x27;s youngest son, Ricci. On March 21, 1987, Martin&#x27;s son, actor Dean Paul Martin (formerly Dino of the 1960s &quot;teeny-bopper&quot; rock group Dino, Desi &amp; Billy), died when his F-4 Phantom II jet fighter crashed while flying with the California Air National Guard. Martin&#x27;s grief over his son&#x27;s death left him depressed and demoralized. Lewis stated in an on-stage interview in 2005 that subsequent to his son&#x27;s death Martin became a reclusive alcoholic. Later, a tour with Davis and Sinatra in 1988, undertaken in part to help Martin recover, sputtered.

==Personal life==
Martin was married three times. He wed Elizabeth Anne &quot;Betty&quot; McDonald, (July 14, 1922 – July 11, 1989) of Ridley Park, Pennsylvania in 1941. The couple had four children:
* Craig Martin (born 1942).
* Claudia Martin (March 16, 1944 – February 16, 2001).
* Gail Martin (born 1945).
* Deana Martin (born 1948).

Martin then married Dorothy Jean &quot;Jeanne&quot; Biegger (March 27, 1927 – August 24, 2016), a former Orange Bowl queen from Coral Gables, Florida. Their marriage lasted 24 years (1949–1973) and produced three children: 
* Dean Paul Martin (November 17, 1951 – March 21, 1987).
* Ricci Martin (September 20, 1953 – August 3, 2016).
* Gina Martin (born 1956).

Less than a month after his second marriage had dissolved, Martin, at 55, married 26-year-old Catherine Hawn on April 25, 1973. Hawn had been the receptionist at the chic Gene Shacove hair salon in Beverly Hills. They divorced November 10, 1976. He was also briefly engaged to Gail Renshaw, Miss World–U.S. 1969. Eventually, Martin reconciled with Jeanne, though they never remarried.

Martin and Hawn had no biological children of their own, but Martin adopted Hawn&#x27;s daughter, Sasha. After their divorce, Martin had a brief relationship with model and longtime friend Patricia Sheehan.

Martin&#x27;s uncle was Leonard Barr, who appeared in several of his shows. In the 1960s and early 1970s Martin lived at 363 Copa De Oro Road in Bel Air, Los Angeles, before selling it to Tom Jones for $500,000 in June 1976.

Martin&#x27;s son-in-law was the Beach Boys&#x27; Carl Wilson, who married Martin&#x27;s daughter Gina. Figure skater Dorothy Hamill and actress Olivia Hussey were his daughters-in-law during their marriages to Martin&#x27;s son, Dean Paul Martin. Craig, Martin&#x27;s elder son, was married to Lou Costello&#x27;s daughter Carole (1938–1987) until her death from a stroke at age 48.

Dean Martin bred Andalusian horses at his Hidden Valley Ranch, Thousand Oaks, Ventura County, California.

Martin volunteered to perform fundraisers for the Bergson Group in the late 1940s.

Although a Republican, Martin supported Democratic candidate Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964.

===Illness and death===

Martin, a lifelong heavy smoker, was diagnosed with lung cancer at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in September 1993. He was told that he would require surgery to prolong his life, but he rejected it. Martin retired from public life in early 1995 and died of acute respiratory failure resulting from emphysema at his Beverly Hills home on Christmas Day, 1995, at the age of 78. The lights of the Las Vegas Strip were dimmed in his honor. Martin was interred at the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles. The crypt features the epitaph &quot;Everybody loves somebody sometime&quot;, the first line of his signature song.

==Tributes and legacy==
In 1997, Ohio Route 7 through Steubenville was rededicated as Dean Martin Boulevard. Road signs bearing an Al Hirschfeld caricature of Martin&#x27;s likeness designate the stretch with a historical marker bearing a small picture and brief biography in the Gazebo Park at Route 7 and North Fourth Street.

The Dean Martin Hometown Festival is held over a long weekend every June in Steubenville. Led by The Dean Martin Association since 2024, impersonators, friends and family, and entertainers, many of Italian ancestry, appear.

In 2005, Clark County, Nevada, renamed a portion of Industrial Road as Dean Martin Drive. A similarly named street was dedicated in 2008 in Rancho Mirage, California.

Martin&#x27;s family was presented a gold record in 2004 for &quot;,&quot; his fastest-selling album, which also hit the iTunes Top 10, and in 2006 it was certified &quot;Platinum&quot;.

There is a street named after Martin in San Antonio, Texas.

For the week ending December 23, 2006, the Dean Martin and Martina McBride duet of &quot;Baby, It&#x27;s Cold Outside&quot; reached No. 7 on the R&amp;R AC chart. It also went to No. 36 on the R&amp;R Country chart – the last time Martin had a song this high in the charts was in 1965, with the song &quot;I Will&quot;, which reached No. 10 on the Pop chart. An album of duets, &quot;Forever Cool&quot;, was released by Capitol/EMI in 2007. It features Martin&#x27;s voice with Kevin Spacey, Shelby Lynne, Joss Stone, Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, Robbie Williams, McBride and others. His footprints were immortalized at Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre in 1964. Martin has three stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame: one at 6519 Hollywood Boulevard for movies; the second at 1617 Vine for recordings; and a third at 6651 Hollywood Boulevard for television. In February 2009, Martin was honored with a posthumous Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. Four of his surviving children, Gail, Deana, Ricci and Gina accepted it on his behalf. In 2010, Martin received a posthumous star on the Italian Walk of Fame in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

The town of origin of Dean&#x27;s father, Montesilvano, dedicated to him a square between via Sarca and via Torrente Piomba and a congress palace called Pala Dean Martin congress center in via Aldo Moro adjacent to the Porto Allegro structure (former cinema Warner).

==In popular culture==

A number of Martin songs have been featured across popular culture for decades. Hits such as &quot;Ain&#x27;t That a Kick in the Head&quot;, &quot;Sway&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re Nobody Till Somebody Loves You&quot;, &quot;That&#x27;s Amore&quot;, and Martin&#x27;s signature song &quot;Everybody Loves Somebody&quot; have been in films (such as the Oscar-winning &quot;Logorama&quot;, &quot;A Bronx Tale&quot;, &quot;Casino&quot;, &quot;Goodfellas&quot;, &quot;Payback&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Sexy Beast&quot;, &quot;Moonstruck&quot;, &quot;Vegas Vacation&quot;, &quot;Swingers&quot;, and &quot;Return to Me&quot;), television series (such as &quot;American Dad!&quot;, &quot;Friends&quot;, &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, &quot;Mad Men&quot;, &quot;House MD&quot;, &quot;Samurai Jack&quot;, and &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot;), video games (such as &quot;The Godfather: The Game&quot;, &quot;The Godfather II&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Mafia II&quot;), and fashion shows (such as the 2008 &quot;Victoria&#x27;s Secret Fashion Show&quot;).

Danny Gans portrayed Martin in the 1992 CBS miniseries &quot;Sinatra&quot;. Martin was portrayed by Joe Mantegna in the 1998 HBO movie about Sinatra and Martin titled &quot;The Rat Pack&quot;. Mantegna was nominated for both an Emmy Award and a Golden Globe Award for the role. British actor Jeremy Northam portrayed the entertainer in the 2002 made-for-TV movie &quot;Martin and Lewis&quot;, alongside &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot; Sean Hayes as Jerry Lewis.

Martin is the subject of &quot;Dean Martin&#x27;s Wild Party&quot; and &quot;Dean Martin&#x27;s Vegas Shindig&quot;, a pair of video slot machines found in many casinos. The games feature songs sung by Martin during the bonus feature and the count-up of a player&#x27;s winnings. A compilation album called &quot;Amore!&quot; debuted at Number One on &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s Top Pop Catalog Albums chart in its February 21, 2009, issue.

In 1998, the MTV animated show &quot;Celebrity Deathmatch&quot; had a clay-animated fight to the death between Martin and comedian Jerry Lewis. Martin wins by whacking Jerry out of the ring. &quot;The Rat Pack: Live from Las Vegas&quot; has been a successful tribute show, featuring Martin impersonators, on stage in Europe and North America since 2000. The popular Las Vegas show, &quot;The Rat Pack is Back&quot; has played The Copa Room at the Tuscany Suites Casino for several years. The walk-up song for Francisco Cervelli, a catcher for the Atlanta Braves, is the Dean Martin tune &quot;That&#x27;s Amore&quot;. In DePatie-Freleng&#x27;s animated theatrical cartoon series &quot;The Ant and the Aardvark&quot;, the Ant&#x27;s voice was performed by John Byner as an imitation of Martin.

Martin appears as Matt Helm in Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s 2019 period piece &quot;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood&quot;. Sharon Tate (played by Margot Robbie) goes to a cinema to see &quot;The Wrecking Crew&quot;.

<text>Deception is the act of convincing one or many recipients of untrue information. The person creating the deception knows it to be false while the receiver of the information does not. It is often done for personal gain or advantage.

Deceit and dishonesty can also form grounds for civil litigation in tort, or contract law (where it is known as misrepresentation or fraudulent misrepresentation if deliberate), or give rise to criminal prosecution for fraud.

== Types ==

=== Communication ===

The Interpersonal Deception Theory explores the interrelation between communicative context and sender and receiver cognitions and behaviors in deceptive exchanges.

Some forms of deception include:
* Lies: making up information or giving information that is the opposite or very different from the truth.
* Equivocations: making an indirect, ambiguous, or contradictory statement.
* Concealments: omitting information that is important or relevant to the given context, or engaging in behavior that helps hide relevant information.
* Exaggerations: overstatement or stretching the truth to a degree.
* Understatements: minimization or downplaying aspects of the truth.
* Untruths: misinterpreting the truth.

Buller and Burgoon (1996) have proposed three taxonomies to distinguish motivations for deception based on their Interpersonal Deception Theory:
* Instrumental: to avoid punishment or to protect resources
* Relational: to maintain relationships or bonds
* Identity: to preserve &quot;face&quot; or the self-image

=== Appearance ===

==== Mimicry ====
In the biological world, mimicry involves deception by similarity to another organism, or to a natural object. Animals for example may deceive predators or prey by visual, auditory or other means.

==== Camouflage ====

The camouflage of a physical object often works by breaking up the visual boundary of that object. This usually involves colouring the camouflaged object with the same colours as the background against which the object will be hidden.

Military camouflage as a form of visual deception is a part of many campaigns.

==== Disguise ====

Disguises are used to create the impression of a false appearance. A seventeenth-century story collection, Zhang Yingyu&#x27;s &quot;The Book of Swindles&quot; (ca. 1617), offers multiple examples of the bait-and-switch and fraud techniques involving the stimulation of greed in Ming-dynasty China.

== In romantic relationships ==
Deception has also been observed and studied in romantic relationships.

There are three primary motivations for deception in relationships.

Deception impacts the perception of a relationship in a variety of ways, for both the deceiver and the deceived. The deceiver typically perceives less understanding and intimacy from the relationship, in that they see their partner as less empathetic and more distant. The act of deception can also result in feelings of distress for the deceiver, which become worse the longer the deceiver has known the deceived, as well as in longer-term relationships. Once discovered, deception creates feelings of detachment and uneasiness surrounding the relationship for both partners; this can eventually lead to both partners becoming more removed from the relationship or deterioration of the relationship. In general, discovery of deception can result in a decrease in relationship satisfaction and commitment level, however, in instances where a person is successfully deceived, relationship satisfaction can actually be positively impacted for the person deceived, since lies are typically used to make the other partner feel more positive about the relationship.

In general, deception tends to occur less often in relationships with higher satisfaction and commitment levels and in relationships where partners have known each other longer, such as long-term relationships and marriage. In comparison, deception is more likely to occur in casual relationships and in dating where commitment level and length of acquaintanceship is often much lower.

=== Deception and infidelity ===

Unique to exclusive romantic relationships is the use of deception in the form of infidelity. When it comes to the occurrence of infidelity, there are many individual difference factors that can impact this behavior. Infidelity is impacted by attachment style, relationship satisfaction, executive function, sociosexual orientation, personality traits, and gender. Attachment style impacts the probability of infidelity and research indicates that people with an insecure attachment style (anxious or avoidant) are more likely to cheat compared to individuals with a secure attachment style, especially for avoidant men and anxious women. Insecure attachment styles are characterized by a lack of comfort within a romantic relationship resulting in a desire to be overly independent (avoidant attachment style) or a desire to be overly dependent on their partner in an unhealthy way (anxious attachment style). Those with an insecure attachment style are characterized by not believing that their romantic partner can/will support and comfort them in an effective way, either stemming from a negative belief regarding themselves (anxious attachment style) or a negative belief regarding romantic others (avoidant attachment style). Women are more likely to commit infidelity when they are emotionally unsatisfied with their relationship whereas men are more likely to commit infidelity if they are sexually unsatisfied with their current relationship. Women are more likely to commit emotional infidelity than men while men are more likely to commit sexual infidelity than women; however, these are not mutually exclusive categories as both men and women can and do engage in emotional or sexual infidelity.

Executive control is a part of executive functions that allows for individuals to monitor and control their behavior through thinking about and managing their actions. The level of executive control that an individual possesses is impacted by development and experience and can be improved through training and practice. Those individuals that show a higher level of executive control can more easily influence/control their thoughts and behaviors in relation to potential threats to an ongoing relationship which can result in paying less attention to threats to the current relationship (other potential romantic mates). Sociosexual orientation is concerned with how freely individuals partake in casual sex outside of a committed relationship and their beliefs regarding how necessary it is to be in love in order to engage in sex with someone. Individuals with a less restrictive sociosexual orientation (more likely to partake in casual sex) are more likely to engage in infidelity. Individuals that have personality traits including (high) neuroticism, (low) agreeableness, and (low) conscientiousness are more likely to commit infidelity. Men are generally speculated to cheat more than women, but it is unclear if this is a result of socialization processes where it is more acceptable for men to cheat compared to women or due to an actual increase in this behavior for men. Research conducted by Conley and colleagues (2011) suggests that the reasoning behind these gender differences stems from the negative stigma associated with women who engage in casual sex and inferences about the sexual capability of the potential sexual partner. In their study, men and women were equally likely to accept a sexual proposal from an individual who was speculated to have a high level of sexual prowess. Additionally, women were just as likely as men to accept a casual sexual proposal when they did not anticipate being subjected to the negative stigma of sexually permissible women as slutty.

=== Online dating deceptions ===
Research on the use of deception in online dating has shown that people are generally truthful about themselves with the exception of physical attributes to appear more attractive. According to the Scientific American, &quot;nine out of ten online daters will fib about their height, weight, or age&quot; such that men were more likely to lie about height while women were more likely to lie about weight. In a study conducted by Toma and Hancock, &quot;less attractive people were found to be more likely to have chosen a profile picture in which they were significantly more attractive than they were in everyday life&quot;. Both genders used this strategy in online dating profiles, but women more so than men. Additionally, less attractive people were more likely to have &quot;lied about objective measures of physical attractiveness such as height and weight&quot;. In general, men are more likely to lie on dating profiles the one exception being that women are more likely to lie about weight.

== In business ==
People who negotiate feel more tempted to use deceit. In negotiation, it includes both parties to trust and respect one another. In negotiations, one party is unaware of what is going on in the other side of the thing that needs to be negotiated. Deception in negotiation comes in many forms, and each has its reaction (Gaspar et al.,2019).
* Price reservation: Not stating the real budget or price that one has in mind.
* Misrepresentation of interests: Getting interests if the buyer seems desperate.
* Fabrication of facts: This is the most immoral part, where the person lies about materials, misleading information to get a sale.
* Omitting relevance: Not stating something that is helpful to know: for example, a car can be like new but it does not help if the seller omits the fact that there is a problem with the transmission.

== In journalism ==
Journalistic deception ranges from passive activities (i.e. blending into a civil rights march) to active deception (i.e. falsely identifying oneself over the telephone, getting hired as a worker at a mental hospital). Paul Braun says that the journalist does not stand apart from the rest of the populace in the use of deception.

== In law ==

For legal purposes, deceit is a tort that occurs when a person makes a factual misrepresentation, knowing that it is false (or having no belief in its truth and being reckless as to whether it is true) and intending it to be relied on by the recipient, and the recipient acts to his or her detriment in reliance on it. Deceit may also be grounds for legal action in contract law (known as misrepresentation, or if deliberate, fraudulent misrepresentation), or a criminal prosecution, on the basis of fraud.

== In religion ==
Deception is a common topic in religious discussions. Some sources focus on how religious texts deal with deception. But, other sources focus on the deceptions created by the religions themselves. For example, Ryan McKnight is the founder of an organization called FaithLeaks. He stated that the organizations &quot;goal is to reduce the amount of deception and untruths and unethical behaviors that exist in some facets of religion&quot;.

=== Christianity ===
=== Islam ===

In general, Islam never allows deception and lie. Prophet Muhammad said, &quot;He who deceives is not of me (is not my follower)&quot;. However, there are some exceptions, especially in case of war or peace making or in case of safeguarding one&#x27;s faith. For an example,
Taqiya is an Islamic juridical term for the cases in which a Muslim is allowed to lie under the circumstance when need to deny their faith due to force or when faced with persecution. The concept mainly followed by Shi&#x27;ite sect, but it varies &quot;significantly among Islamic sects, scholars, countries, and political regimes&quot;, and has been evoked by critics of Islam to portray the faith allowing dishonesty.

== In psychological research ==
Though commonly used and allowed by the ethical guidelines of the American Psychological Association, there has been debate about whether or not the use of deception should be permitted in psychological research experiments. Those against deception object to the ethical and methodological issues involved in its use. Dresser (1981) notes that, ethically, researchers are only to use subjects in an experiment after the subject has given informed consent. However, because of its very nature, a researcher conducting a deception experiment cannot reveal its true purpose to the subject, thereby making any consent given by a subject misinformed. Baumrind (1964), criticizing the use of deception in the Milgram (1963) obedience experiment, argues that deception experiments inappropriately take advantage of the implicit trust and obedience given by the subject when the subject volunteers to participate.

From a practical perspective, there are also methodological objections to deception. Ortmann and Hertwig (1998) note that &quot;deception can strongly affect the reputation of individual labs and the profession, thus contaminating the participant pool&quot;. If the subjects in the experiment are suspicious of the researcher, they are unlikely to behave as they normally would, and the researcher&#x27;s control of the experiment is then compromised. Those who do not object to the use of deception note that there is always a constant struggle in balancing &quot;the need for conducting research that may solve social problems and the necessity for preserving the dignity and rights of the research participant&quot;. They also note that, in some cases, using deception is the only way to obtain certain kinds of information, and that prohibiting all deception in research would &quot;have the egregious consequence of preventing researchers from carrying out a wide range of important studies&quot;.

Some findings suggest that deception is not harmful to subjects. Christensen&#x27;s (1988) review of the literature found &quot;that research participants do not perceive that they are harmed and do not seem to mind being misled&quot;. Furthermore, those participating in experiments involving deception &quot;reported having enjoyed the experience more and perceived more educational benefit&quot; than those who participated in non-deceptive experiments. Lastly, it has also been suggested that an unpleasant treatment used in a deception study or the unpleasant implications of the outcome of a deception study may be the underlying reason that a study using deception is perceived as unethical in nature, rather than the actual deception itself.

== In social research ==
Some methodologies in social research, especially in psychology, involve deception. The researchers purposely mislead or misinform the participants about the true nature of the experiment. In an experiment conducted by Stanley Milgram in 1963 the researchers told participants that they would be participating in a scientific study of memory and learning. In reality the study looked at the participants&#x27; willingness to obey commands, even when that involved inflicting pain upon another person. After the study, the subjects were informed of the true nature of the study, and steps were taken in order to ensure that the subjects left in a state of well-being. Use of deception raises many problems of research ethics and it is strictly regulated by professional bodies such as the American Psychological Association.

== Online disinhibition ==
Through the internet, individuals can portray themselves however they please because of the lack of face-to face communication. Digital deception is widely used within different forms of technology to misrepresent someone or something. Through digital deception, people are easily capable of deceiving others whether it be for their own benefit or to ensure their safety. One form of digital deception is catfishing. By creating a false identity catfishers deceive those online to build relationships, friendships, or connections without revealing who they truly are as a person. They do so by creating an entirely new account that has made up information allowing them to  portray themselves as a different person. Most lies and misinformation are spread commonly through emails and instant messaging since these messages are erased faster. Without face to face communication, it could be easier to deceive others, making it difficult to detect the truth from a lie.  These unreliable cues allow digital deception to easily influence and mislead others.

== Double bluff ==
Double bluffing is a deceptive scenario, in which the deceiver tells truth to a person about some subject, but makes the person think that the deceiver is lying. In poker, the term double bluff refers to a situation in which the deceiving player is trying to bluff with bad cards, then gets re-raised by the opponent, and then re-raises again in the hopes that the enemy player folds. This strategy works best on opponents who easily fold under pressure.

== Deception detection ==
Deception detection is extremely difficult unless it is a blatant or obvious lie or contradicts something the other knows to be true. While it is difficult to deceive a person over a long period of time, deception often occurs in day-to-day conversations between relational partners. Detecting deception is difficult because there are no known completely reliable indicators of deception and because people often reply on a truth-default state. Deception, however, places a significant cognitive load on the deceiver. He or she must recall previous statements so that his or her story remains consistent and believable. As a result, deceivers often leak important information both verbally and nonverbally.

Deception and its detection is a complex, fluid, and cognitive process that is based on the context of the message exchange. The interpersonal deception theory posits that interpersonal deception is a dynamic, iterative process of mutual influence between a sender, who manipulates information to depart from the truth, and a receiver, who attempts to establish the validity of the message. A deceiver&#x27;s actions are interrelated to the message receiver&#x27;s actions. It is during this exchange that the deceiver will reveal verbal and nonverbal information about deceit. Some research has found that there are some cues that may be correlated with deceptive communication, but scholars frequently disagree about the effectiveness of many of these cues to serve as reliable indicators. A cross cultural study conducted to analyze human behavior and deception concluded detecting deception often has to do with the judgements of a person and how they interpret non-verbal cues. One&#x27;s personality can influence these judgements also as some people are more confident in deceiving compared to others. Noted deception scholar Aldert Vrij even states that there is no nonverbal behavior that is uniquely associated with deception. As previously stated, a specific behavioral indicator of deception does not exist. There are, however, some nonverbal behaviors that have been found to be correlated with deception. Vrij found that examining a &quot;cluster&quot; of these cues was a significantly more reliable indicator of deception than examining a single cue.

Many people believe that they are good at deception, though this confidence is often misplaced. Deception detection can decrease with increased empathy. Emotion recognition training does not affect the ability to detect deception. 

Mark Frank proposes that deception is detected at the cognitive level. Lying requires deliberate conscious behavior, so listening to speech and watching body language are important factors in detecting lies. If a response to a question has a lot disturbances, less talking time, repeated words, and poor logical structure, then the person may be lying. Vocal cues such as frequency height and variation may also provide meaningful clues to deceit.

Fear specifically causes heightened arousal in liars, which manifests in more frequent blinking, pupil dilation, speech disturbances, and a higher pitched voice. The liars that experience guilt have been shown to make attempts at putting distance between themselves and the deceptive communication, producing &quot;nonimmediacy cues&quot;. These can be verbal or physical, including speaking in more indirect ways and showing an inability to maintain eye contact with their conversation partners. Another cue for detecting deceptive speech is the tone of the speech itself. Streeter, Krauss, Geller, Olson, and Apple (1977) have assessed that fear and anger, two emotions widely associated with deception, cause greater arousal than grief or indifference, and note that the amount of stress one feels is directly related to the frequency of the voice.

<doc id="151606" wikidata="Q3177366" url="?curid=151606" title="Mark Waugh">
<text>Mark Edward Waugh (born 2 June 1965) is an Australian cricket commentator and former international cricketer, who represented Australia in Test matches from early 1991 to late 2002, after previously making his One Day International (ODI) debut in 1988. Waugh was a part of the Australian team that won the 1999 Cricket World Cup.

Waugh is younger than his twin brother Steve Waugh by a few minutes. Dean Waugh, another of Mark&#x27;s brothers, is also a cricketer, having played both first-class and List A cricket in Australia for New South Wales. His nephew and Steve&#x27;s son, Austin Waugh, was selected in the Australian under-19 team. He was previously a national selector, holding that position until August 2018. On 15 May 2018, he announced his intentions to swap national selector duties for a TV commentating role with Fox Sports.

==Key achievements==
Waugh was primarily a right-handed batsman who batted in the No. 4 position in Test matches. He was also a handy medium pace bowler, but changed to an off-spin bowler after back injuries restricted him. Waugh is regarded as one of the best slip fielders ever to play cricket and held the world record for most Test catches by a non-wicketkeeper until Rahul Dravid broke it in 2009.

He began as an all-rounder in the Australian ODI team, but he later focussed on batting and progressed to opening the batting, where he excelled and became Australia&#x27;s leading one day runscorer. His three centuries at the 1996 Cricket World Cup made him the first batsman to ever achieve this feat, with the record later equaled by Indian captain Sourav Ganguly at the 2003 Cricket World Cup. This record was later broken by India&#x27;s Rohit Sharma in 2019 Cricket World Cup with 5 centuries. A fourth century in the 1999 Cricket World Cup made him the only Australian to score four centuries and more than 1000 runs in World Cup competition. He also became the leading Australian run-scorer and century maker in ODIs during the 1999 tournament as well.

Waugh is regarded as one of the most elegant and gifted stroke makers to ever play the game and his stylish strokeplay was likened to that of Stan McCabe, Alan Kippax, Victor Trumper, Charlie Macartney and Greg Chappell.

Following his debut Test century, Australian coach Bob Simpson compared Waugh&#x27;s elegance to that of Archie Jackson. Mark Taylor called Waugh the &quot;best-looking leg-side player I&#x27;ve seen in my time. . . anything drifting into his pads is hit beautifully.&quot;

His facile grace also led to accusations that he was a &quot;lazy&quot; batsman who was vulnerable to soft dismissals.

Waugh is the younger fraternal twin brother of Steve Waugh, with whom he played for most of his career and also under his captaincy. 

==Early years==

Born on 2 June 1965 at Canterbury Hospital in Campsie, New South Wales, Waugh was the second of twin boys born to Rodger and Beverley Waugh. He arrived four minutes after Steve. His father was a bank official and his mother was a teacher within the New South Wales Department of Education. The family settled in the western Sydney suburb of Panania. The twins were later joined by two more brothers, Dean and Danny. From an early age, the parents introduced their children to sport. By the age of six, the twins were playing organised soccer, tennis and cricket. In their first cricket match, the brothers were both dismissed for ducks.

The twins came from a sporting family. Their paternal grandfather Edward was a greyhound trainer. Raised in the northern coastal town of Bangalow, Edward earned selection for the New South Wales Country team in rugby league. He was about to join Eastern Suburbs in the New South Wales Rugby League, but had to give up his career due to family reasons. Rodger was Edward&#x27;s only son and was promising tennis player, who was ranked eighth in Australia in his junior years and was the state champion at under-14 level. On the maternal side, Bev was a tennis player who won the under-14 singles at the South Australian Championships. Her eldest brother Dion Bourne was an opening batsman who played for Bankstown in Sydney Grade Cricket and remains the leading runscorer in the club&#x27;s history.

The twins made their first representative cricket team when they were selected the Bankstown District under-10s at the age of eight. In 1976, the twins were the youngest ever to be selected in the New South Wales Primary Schools&#x27; soccer team. Playing for Panania Primary School, the twins swept their school to win the Umbro International Shield, a statewide knockout soccer competition, scoring all of their team&#x27;s three goals in the final. They were a key part of their school&#x27;s consecutive state cricket championships and were part of school tennis team that came second in the state in their final year. In their final year, Mark was the captain of the state primary school cricket and tennis teams, both of which won the national championships. The twins were instrumental in New South Wales winning the cricket carnival without a defeat.

By this time, the increasing time demands led to conflicts between the sports and were in one case delisted from a team due to a conflict of commitments. The twins progressed to East Hills Boys Technology High School, which had a history of producing Australian international representatives in a number of sports. Aged 13, the twins were invited by their uncle Bourne, then the captain of Bankstown&#x27;s first grade team, to trial for the club&#x27;s under-16 team for the Green Shield and both were selected. Aged fourteen, both made their senior grade cricket debut in 1979–80, playing in the Fourth XI. The twins broke into East Hills Boys First XI in the same season and achieved the same level in soccer. In 1980–81 the brothers were elevated to the Third XI mid-season. Mark&#x27;s performance in the Green Shield saw him selected in Bankstown&#x27;s under-21 team, still aged 15. The brothers often won formed a two-man team—in one match, Mark scored a century and then the brothers took 16/85 between them. At the end of 1980, the twins were selected in the state under-16 team for the national carnival, with Mark as vice-captain.

When Mark was 16, he grew around one foot in one year. It was a relief, because he had been diagnosed with the repetitive stress injury Osgood-Schlatter disease at 15 and told that he would not grow any further than his then height of 152 cm. The pair changed soccer teams to play in the reserve grade for Sydney Croatia in the state league and the pair were paid small amounts in the professional league. However, they quickly left as their cricket careers increasingly demanded more time.

The brothers were promoted to Bankstown&#x27;s Second XI, before being selected for the First XI in the 1982–83 season, aged 17, both making their debut against Western Suburbs, with Mark making 97 on debut, ending the season with 427 runs at 30.50. This placed him second in his team&#x27;s aggregates and he contributed 14 wickets at 10.71. By this time, his coaches had already identified the traits by which Mark was to be characterised in his international career, those of apparent laziness and reliable catching.

The twins finished high school at the end of 1983. In 1983–84, both were members of New South Wales Combined High Schools and the state under-19 team. Mark was named as the player of the series after scoring two centuries. The brothers were then selected for Australia for the first time. They had been named in the national under-19 team to play a Test and ODI series against the touring Sri Lankan counterparts. The under-19 series pitted several future international players against one another. Mark scored 123 in the second Test at the Adelaide Oval.

Waugh did not contemplate going to university; both he and his brother became sports equipment salesmen. He made his maiden First XI century during the season, scoring 108 against Mosman.

At the start of the 1984–85 season, the brothers were included in the New South Wales state squad.

==Formative professional career==

At the end of the season, the Waugh twins signed a contract to spend the Australian winter to play for Egerton in the Bolton League in Lancashire in northern England. Each club was allowed to have one professional; Steve was officially designated as such but would split the earnings with Mark. The twins were billeted with a local family. However, during the year, an Australian rebel tour to South Africa was staged, breaking the boycott against the apartheid regime. Some players defected from the Australian Test team to play in South Africa. This resulted in Dave Gilbert being promoted to the national squad, forcing him to forfeit his Esso scholarship, which allowed him to play Second XI cricket in the County Championship. Steve was selected to replace Gilbert with Essex, leaving Mark as the lone professional. Waugh struggled at first, but recovered to score six centuries for the season. As a reward for scoring more than 800 runs and taking more than 50 wickets, Waugh&#x27;s captain, who was a dentist, gave him free service. Waugh eventually finished the season with 1460 runs and 75 wickets, breaking the club runscoring record by more than 200 runs.

Waugh returned to Australia for the 1985–86 season, looking to make his First-class debut. He scored 177 against Petersham in just five hours and was selected for the state Second XI. Then, an opportunity arose with further ramifications of the rebel tours of South Africa. A two-year ban on playing state cricket was imposed on the players. This meant that New South Wales was looking for two new opening batsmen, as both Steve Smith and John Dyson had defected and been banned. Waugh and Taylor were selected to make their Sheffield Shield debut.

==Domestic career==
===First-class cricket===
Waugh and Mark Taylor opened on debut against Tasmania at Hobart&#x27;s TCA Ground. New South Wales were sent into bat and Waugh was dismissed for 13 and New South Wales fell to 3/60 in the first innings. He scored 28 in the second innings, but the drawn match was more notable for an incident on the third morning, when the new opening pair overslept on Taylor&#x27;s 21st birthday. They were punished by coach Bob Simpson with fielding drills, forcing the pair to take hundreds of catches. He took his first catch, that of Roger Woolley on debut. Waugh fell on tough times, being dismissed for a duck and four by Test bowler Merv Hughes in the next match against Victoria and then 17 and a run out for another duck against the touring New Zealand. With a First-class average of 10.33, Waugh was dropped for the next five matches. However, for the final four matches of the season, Waugh was recalled to the team as a front-line fast bowler and middle order batsman. He took 4/130 in the first innings against Queensland in his first match in the role. They were his first First-class wickets. His bowling was characterised by his liberal use of short-pitched bowling. In the next match against Tasmania, Waugh opened the bowling with Mike Whitney, due to injuries to other bowlers, taking 2/31 in the first innings. Waugh then took 3/49 in the final round robin match against Queensland, before the teams met again in the Sheffield Shield final at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Whitney and Waugh were New South Wales&#x27; only pacemen and Waugh bowled 27 overs to take 1/71. Batting at No. 7, Waugh was involved in a century stand with Greg Dyer to help avoid the follow on with 41. Waugh made only 24 in the second innings as the home team hung on for a draw to secure the Shield. Waugh had scored 167 runs at 15.18 and took 11 wickets at 32.00 for the season. He played in one limited overs match, scoring 13 and taking 1/28 against Victoria.

At this stage of his career, Waugh lived in the shadow of his brother Steve, who was promoted to the Australian team at the age of 20. As a result, Mark was sometimes called &quot;Afghan&quot;, a reference to the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, sometimes dubbed the &quot;forgotten war&quot;. Building up an impressive record at First-class level, Waugh spent two seasons with English county Essex as the team&#x27;s successor to Allan Border as an overseas professional. In 1987–88 and 1989–90, he was voted the Sheffield Shield Player of the Year.

In mid-1988, Waugh was signed to replace Australian captain Allan Border for a six-week stint as the overseas professional at Essex County Cricket Club in England, after just one full season of Sheffield Shield. Border had to leave before the end of the season because of the Australian tour of Pakistan and had recommended Waugh, who arrived with high expectations. Essex were one of the strongest teams in England and Border had scored six centuries that season. Waugh&#x27;s debut came in August in a limited overs match against Nottinghamshire at Colchester. After struggling at the start of his innings, Waugh found his rhythm and reached 103 from only 94 balls, accumulating his second 50 in just 28 balls. He ended with 15 fours and a six and then took 2/16 with the ball. Waugh played in three First-class matches, scoring 178 runs at 44.50. His performances were enough to prompt Essex officials to invite him to return for the 1989 season. Waugh accepted, subject to him not being selected for the 1989 Ashes tour of England with the national side.

In the longer form, Waugh continued to be overlooked and was criticised for his apparently casual attitude. Simpson, now the Australia coach, criticised Waugh, believing that he was not fully exploiting his talent. He scored only one half-century in the remainder of the First-class season, ending the season with 727 First-class runs at 40.39. He did not take a wicket for the season. He was overlooked for the 1989 Ashes tour.

In 1989, Waugh returned to Essex for his first full season as the overseas professional. He began slowly with a 77 against Derbyshire being his only score beyond 50 in his first six innings. He then scored 92 and took 3/23 against Cambridge University and then three fifties in the next six innings, including 89 not out against Leicestershire. Waugh then broke through for his first First-class county century, scoring 109 at Ilford in late June against Hampshire, whose pace attack was led by Malcolm Marshall. He then scored 112 not out against Glamorgan in a one-dayer, but had another lean run in the County Championship, failing to pass 30 in nine consecutive innings. Waugh returned to form with 110 against Middlesex, before scoring an unbeaten century against Australia in a tour match. He scored 100 from 165 deliveries, while Steve reached his century in 101 balls for Australia. Waugh finished his season with 165 against Leicester. He had scored 1537 runs at 43.91. He took 31 catches in 24 matches and took 14 wickets at 29.62. Essex finished second in the County Championship, six points behind Worcestershire. They would have won were it not for the 25-point penalty that was incurred for pitch-doctoring. Essex paid Waugh and his teammates championship-winning bonuses, indicating their belief that they were the rightful champions. Essex reached the final of the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup against Nottinghamshire. Waugh made 41 from 58 balls before his team lost after conceding the winning runs from the last ball of the match.

In the first Sheffield Shield match of the season, Waugh scored 172 from 301 balls, his highest First-class score to date. He hit 20 boundaries. He then struck 42 and took three wickets against Sri Lanka, but was overlooked for the Test against New Zealand. He scored 46 and 18 and took 1/31 and 2/34 against Queensland, before striking and unbeaten 100 against Victoria. Despite this Waugh was not selected for the opening phase of the season&#x27;s ODI tournament. At the start of 1990, he went three innings without passing 30, before striking another unbeaten century against Victoria. New South Wales was then sent in at the Sydney Cricket Ground and Waugh struck 137 from 185 runs on the first day, including a six from Peter Sleep that narrowly missed the clock tower. The Sydney Morning Herald opined that &quot;Waugh would imperiously render them [the fielders] obsolete, going over, between and sometimes through them&quot;.

Waugh returned to state duty and New South Wales needed to beat Tasmania in their last match to qualify for the final. They were struggling at 3/33 in reply to Tasmania&#x27;s 117 when Waugh came to the crease and made 198 not out from 390 balls. New South Wales won by an innings to reach the Shield final against Queensland. Waugh scored an unbeaten 78 in the second innings as his team won the title. Waugh ended the Sheffield Shield as the top-scorer, with 967 runs at 80.85, prompting the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) to select him as its Player of the Year. It noted that Waugh&#x27;s &quot;characteristic blend of dash and elegance . . .seemed to be reinforced now by extra application and determination.&quot;

In 1990, Waugh and his brother combined in an unbeaten partnership of 464 in 407 minutes for New South Wales against Western Australia at the WACA Ground, setting a world First-class record for the fifth wicket. Both teams were at full strength and Western Australia&#x27;s attack included Test bowlers Terry Alderman, Bruce Reid and Chris Matthews. The twins ended unbeaten with 216 and 229 respectively.

On the tour of England in 1993, Waugh scored 174 against Surrey and reclaimed his Test position from Damien Martyn. He scored an ODI and a Test century in matches at Edgbaston.

==International career==
===Debut years===
Waugh was seeking to force his way into the Australian team at the start of the 1988–89 season. He started poorly, with a duck and 18 against Queensland and not taking a wicket. In the next match he made a duck and appeared to be in control in the second innings when he was run out for 46. He then faced the touring West Indies, Waugh was dismissed for nine in the first innings. In the second innings, Waugh bounced back to score an unbeaten 103 from 163 balls against the team regarded as the best in the world at the time, earning praise from their captain Viv Richards. In the following match against Tasmania, Waugh was immediately out for a duck attempting a cut shot, but made 100 not out in the second innings. He then scored 69 and 39 against Western Australia. Waugh was overlooked for Test selection, but was selected in the ODI squad for the start of the triangular tournament against the West Indies and Pakistan. It was to be the first time that twins played international cricket for Australia.

Waugh made his ODI debut against Pakistan at the Adelaide Oval in December, but did not bat or bowl as Australia took a nine-wicket victory. Two days later against the West Indies in Sydney, Waugh took his first ODI catch when he caught Gordon Greenidge from Peter Taylor. He batted for the first time, partnering his brother during a run chase, scoring 18 from 19 balls. Steve was run out, something that was to occur multiple times while they batted together. Australia lost by one run. Waugh made 32 in the next match against the West Indies, and again Steve was run out while they were batting together. Waugh was omitted for the next three ODIs but returned to make 12 against Pakistan before scoring 42 from 53 in the final round-robin match against the West Indies. Waugh was omitted for the first final, which Australia won by two runs, before replacing Simon O&#x27;Donnell in the second match. He took two catches in the second match and scored 22 and five as Australia lost both to concede the series. Waugh ended his first international series with 131 runs at 21.83.

Waugh returned to Australia in preparation for the 1989–90 season, having been overlooked for the ODI squad for the Nehru Cup in India. At the start of the season, the Australian selectors wanted Waugh to tighten up before he could be selected for Tests. He was selected for his only ODI season in 1990, scoring 14 in the second final as Australia won the series, and was overlooked of the New Zealand tour in March 1990.

===Test century on debut===
At the age of 25, he was finally picked for his Test debut in 1990–91, which resulted in mixed emotions: his place in the team game came at the expense of his out-of-form brother, who had only scored 82 runs at 20.50 for the series. Playing against England in the fourth Test at the Adelaide Oval, Waugh came to the crease in the first innings on the first day with Australia in trouble at 4/104. The situation deteriorated when Australia fell to 5/126 and Greg Matthews joined Waugh at the crease. The pair batted until the end of the day, and Waugh brought up his century with a square drive late on the first day. This made him the fifteenth Australian to make a century on debut. Phil Wilkins of &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; wrote that &quot;Such a maiden Test century could hardly have been surpassed for commanding presence&quot;. Waugh was widely lauded for the style and elegance of his innings. Waugh ended the day at 116 not out and was bowled early on the second morning for 138 by paceman Devon Malcolm to end a 171-run stand with Matthews. His innings had taken only 188 deliveries and featured heavy scoring through leg-side flicks. Waugh made 23 in the second innings and took his first Test catch, Mike Atherton, caught from the bowling of Bruce Reid. The match was drawn and Waugh experienced his first Test victory when he scored 26 in the fifth Test in Perth as Australia sealed the series 3–0. His performances saw him selected for the early 1991 tour of the West Indies, to play in five Tests and five ODIs against the world&#x27;s most powerful team. Australia had not won a Test series in the Caribbean for 18 years against a team known for their physically intimidating fast bowlers.
In the first tour match against Jamaica, Waugh was felled by a bouncer from Courtney Walsh, but recovered to score a century despite the presence of his teammate&#x27;s spilt blood on the pitch. Waugh scored 67 from 66 balls in the first ODI at Sabina Park in Kingston as Australia took a 1–0 lead. The ODI series was interrupted by the first Test, also at Sabina Park. Waugh scored 39 in a rain-affected draw, later admitting to having felt out of his depth against the hostile fast bowling—blood was spilt on both sides. The ODI series resumed and after consecutive matches without passing 20, Waugh played a large part in victory in the fourth match that gave Australia the series win. He scored 49 from only 37 balls and then took 3/34 to seal a 37-run win. He ended the series with 156 runs at 31.20 and eight wickets at 18.25. The Test series resumed and Waugh scored 71 in the second Test as Australia lost by ten wickets.

The brothers played their first Test match together in the third Test at Queen&#x27;s Park Oval in Trinidad. Waugh top-scored with 64 in the first innings of another rain-affected draw, before taking his first Test wicket, Curtly Ambrose. He admitted that he was pleased that the weather prevented him from having to spend more time facing the West Indian pacemen. He did not pass 20 in the fourth Test in Bridgetown, Barbados, as the West Indies retained the Frank Worrell Trophy 2–0 with a 343-run victory. He was the most successful bowler in the second innings, taking 4/80, including the wicket of Viv Richards. His bowling included short-pitched bowling, reasoning that the Australians were going to be bounced anyway.

In the fifth Test of the series in St. John&#x27;s, Antigua, Waugh made 139 not out from 188 balls. Devising a different strategy of combating the short-pitched bowling, Waugh backed away from the stumps and sliced the bowlers over the slips cordon. Shielding the tailenders from the West Indies fast bowlers, he still managed to score a century between tea and stumps. He reached his century in 133 minutes and was unbeaten at the end of the innings with 11 fours and three sixes. Australia made 403 in the first day and went on to win the match. Waugh ended the Test series with 367 runs at 61.17, the best among the Australians, in addition to taking eight wickets at 22.83.

===Run of bad form===
During the 1991–92 Australian summer, Waugh hit a patch of bad form. He was dropped from the ODI team in the early part of the season, then omitted from the Test team in favour of Tom Moody for the fifth Test against India in Perth. Following his recall to the ODI team in place of the injured Bruce Reid, Waugh scored only 20 runs at 6.67.

He was part of the team that failed to make the semi-finals of the 1992 World Cup, but did not play the entire tournament due to his poor form. After scoring two in the opening match against New Zealand at Eden Park, he was dropped for three games, then played in the last four matches. His best effort was an unbeaten 66 from 39 balls against Zimbabwe at Bellerive Oval. On the tour of Sri Lanka that followed, Waugh returned to the Test team and scored five and 56 in the first Test but followed it with four consecutive ducks.

A score of 112 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in the second Test of 1992–93 helped set up an Australian victory and a 1–0 lead in the Frank Worrell Trophy series against the West Indies. During that season&#x27;s World Series Cup, he scored a half-century and took 5/24 as Australia successfully defended a small total.

===ODI opener===
After two unproductive Tests on the 1993 New Zealand tour, Waugh was dropped for the third Test, this time in favour of the younger Damien Martyn. In the ODI series, Australia opted for a new strategy and promoted Waugh to open the batting. He scored 60 and 57 in the first two matches to help set up an Australian victory, then scored his maiden ODI century, 108 in Hamilton. A score of 83 in the final match made him the leading batsman of the series with 308 runs at 61.60.

In the second Test at Lord&#x27;s—the spiritual home of cricket— Waugh started on six on the second morning scored quickly to reach 99. He was looking for his century during an over by Phil Tufnell. Tufnell was employing his customary defensive approach of pitching the ball outside the leg stump with a leg side field. The first ball was a half-volley and Waugh hit it straight from the middle of the bat. However, the ball hit the short leg fielder in the shins. Later in the over, another leg side ball hit his pads, rolled between his legs and onto the stumps, meaning that Waugh missed out on his century.

Tufnell dismissed him more than ten times in Test matches utilising this tactic. A century against New Zealand in Hobart brought Waugh&#x27;s total to 987 Test runs for the calendar year.

===Bribery claims===
Starting 1994 well, Waugh was named Player of the Finals against South Africa in the World Series Cup and he then scored a century against the same opponents in the drawn third Test in Durban. Later in the year, Waugh claimed that Pakistan captain Saleem Malik had offered him (along with Tim May and Shane Warne) money to perform poorly during a match on the tour of Pakistan. Waugh&#x27;s performances were beyond reproach: he scored three half-centuries in the Tests and an ODI century during the match in question.

In the first Test of 1994–95, Waugh hit his highest score yet, 140 against England in Brisbane. In the second innings, Australia was seeking quick runs to set up a declaration. Waugh&#x27;s old sparring partner Tufnell was bowling defensive to a packed leg side field. Waugh attempted a reverse sweep for the first time in his career, attempting to collect runs in the sparsely patrolled off side, but only managed to hit the ball onto his stumps and was bowled for 15. Australia went on to win the Test and Waugh contributed 71 and 29 in another win in Melbourne.

Waugh failed to pass 25 in the rain-affected draw in the third Test in Sydney, before claiming career-best bowling figures of 5/40 in a losing team during the second innings of the fourth Test in Adelaide. In the fifth Test at the WACA, Waugh scored 88 in the first innings before returning as a runner for the injured Craig McDermott. He was run out in a mix-up with his brother while looking for the single that would have given Steve his century. This left his brother on 99 not out with Australia all out. Waugh contributed a further three wickets as Australia completed a 3–1 series win.

On the subsequent tour of the West Indies, Waugh scored what Paul Reiffel described as a &quot;nonchalantly [...] beautiful&quot; 126 and combined with his brother for a 231-run partnership in the deciding fourth Test in Jamaica. This set up victory and Australia&#x27;s first series win over the West Indies since 1975–76.

Waugh had a productive and consistent 1995–96 Australian summer, scoring two centuries and four half-centuries in six Tests against Pakistan and Sri Lanka. He passed 50 in each Test. The series against Pakistan started amidst a new development in the bribery claims against Malik. A Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) inquiry cleared Malik and speculated that Waugh and the Australians had concocted the claims. At the start of the season, back injuries forced him to convert to bowling off-spin a during the season. During the first Test in Brisbane, Waugh scored 59 as Australia took an innings victory. He also took his first Test wicket as a spin bowler, that of Inzamam-ul-Haq. Waugh scored 88 in the second Test win in Hobart and the teams moved to Sydney, where Australia sought a clean sweep. He had a poor Test record on his home ground, having accumulated only 126 runs in seven innings at the ground. Waugh&#x27;s 116 from 206 balls was highlighted by his battle against the spinners Mushtaq Ahmed and Saqlain Mushtaq and was the mainstay of Australia&#x27;s first innings of 257. Australia were set 247 for victory and were well placed at 2/117, with Waugh having scored 34 from only 46 deliveries. He was given out caught behind, although the ball only flicked his pad. Australia subsequently collapsed to be all out for 172, losing the Test. Despite the loss, Waugh had compiled 300 runs at 60.00 for the series.

The series against Sri Lanka had started in Perth with speculation regarding Waugh&#x27;s four consecutive Test ducks. After four hours, Waugh reached his century and ended with 111 to end his run of ducks. On reaching his century, he gestured to a section of the crowd who had been heckling him. Australia won by an innings and Waugh then scored 61 in another innings victory in the second Test in Melbourne. He was batting when off-spinner Muttiah Muralitharan was repeatedly no-balled for throwing by Darrell Hair, before being bowled by the spinner. Waugh scored 71 in the third Test and ended with 255 runs at 63.75 in a series clean sweep.

During the triangular ODI tournament, Waugh was the Man of the Match in the opening game against the West Indies at the Adelaide Oval, scoring 53 and conceding only 26 runs in 10 overs. Later in the tournament, Waugh returned to the opening position after the omission of Michael Slater, a position he retained until his retirement. In his first match in the role, Waugh scored 130 from 144 balls against Sri Lanka at the WACA Ground. At the time, the innings was the third-highest ODI score by an Australian and the opening partnership of 189 with Taylor was the seventh-highest of all time. In the second final, Waugh made 73 in a 135-run partnership with Taylor and then in an unorthodox tactic, he opened the bowling with his off-spin, taking 1/31. Waugh ended the summer with 357 runs at 35.70 and took six wickets.

===1996 World Cup===
Waugh was one of the leading players at the 1996 Cricket World Cup in the Indian subcontinent. Opening the batting, he scored 130 from 130 balls in Australia&#x27;s opening game against Kenya in Visakhapatnam. He combined in a 207-run partnership with his brother, the first double-century stand in World Cup history. He followed this up with 126 from 135 balls against India in Bombay, frequently hitting through cover and midwicket. The innings made him the first player to score consecutive centuries in World Cup competition. Waugh then dismissed Sachin Tendulkar for 90 when he looked likely to win the game for India. Tendulkar charged down the pitch to Waugh&#x27;s off spin, who responded by bowling a wide, resulting in the Indian&#x27;s stumping. Waugh was named Man of the Match on both occasions. He made an unbeaten 76 against Zimbabwe in a nine-wicket win in Nagpur. He scored only 30 from 63 balls, but took 3/38 in the final group game against the West Indies in Jaipur, which Australia lost. Australia progressed to the quarter-finals, where they faced New Zealand in Madras, he scored his third century (110) to guide a successful Australian run chase, again winning the man of the match. The innings took Waugh&#x27;s tournament tally to 472 runs, the record for Australia in a single tournament. Although he managed only 0 and 12 in the semi-final and final, Waugh finished the tournament with 484 runs at an average of 80.66 and a strike rate of 85.36, second only to Tendulkar. He contributed five wickets with the ball.

After a four-month break, Waugh returned to international duty with a short tour of the subcontinent. In two tournaments, he scored 207 runs at 25.88 in eight matches, scoring exactly 50 in two matches and taking eight wickets at 36.00. The Australians then lost a one-off Test against Delhi at Feroz Shah Kotla Ground, with Waugh scoring 26 and 23. He took his best First-class career bowling figures of 6/68 in the tour match against the Indian Board President&#x27;s XI in Patiala that preceded the Test.

Waugh had a consistent series despite failing to score a century in the five Tests against the West Indies during the 1996–97 home season, He scored four half-centuries, only failing to pass 50 in the third Test, ending the series with 370 runs at 41.11. During the second innings of the second Test in Sydney, Waugh collided with batting partner Matthew Elliott, causing Elliott to be taken from the ground on a stretcher due to a knee injury. The fifth Test in Perth marked the 44th time that the Waugh brothers had played together in Tests, surpassing the world record set by Ian and Greg Chappell in the 1970s. In the limited overs format, Waugh was Australia&#x27;s leading runscorer in the triangular ODI tournament with 358 runs at 59.66, making 102 against the West Indies in Brisbane. He had scored 1059 ODI runs in the 1996 calendar year. However, the team performance was poor and Australia missed the finals for the first time in 17 years. His batting partner Taylor particularly struggled, with only 143 runs at 17.87, attracting substantial media criticism.

The Australian summer was followed by a tour of South Africa. Waugh made 26 in the opening Test, which Australia won by an innings. In the second Test in Port Elizabeth, Australia were skittled in the first innings for 108 and were forced to chase 270 for victory on a seaming wicket. Waugh came to the crease with Australia at 2/30 on the third afternoon. After a hard-fought afternoon, Australia reached the close of play at 3/154 with Waugh on 54. The next morning he continued to his century, before he was bowled for 116, leaving Australia at 6/258. Australia lost two more wickets, but stumbled to victory with two wickets in hand. The five and half-hour innings is often regarded as his finest Test performance. Waugh ended the series with 209 runs at 41.80.

In the ODI series, he hit an unbeaten 115 to steer at a successful run chase in the second match in Port Elizabeth, hitting consecutive sixes to reach his century. He missed several matches due to injury—the first match due to a back problem and then two further matches when he split his hand webbing while failing to take a catch in the third match. Apart from the century, he scored only three further runs at ended with 118 runs at 59.00 for the series.

Waugh proceeded to England for his second Ashes tour in 1997 and gained attention upon his arrival for questioning the hunger and toughness of the home team. He scored 131 runs at 43.66 as Australia lost all three ODIs, with a top-score of 95 in the final match at The Oval. In the first Test at Edgbaston, Waugh made 5 and 1 as Australia suffered a nine-wicket loss. The English media and public reminded Waugh of his pre-series comments about the England cricket team. To make matters worse, he was hospitalised for two days in the middle of the match with suspected appendicitis. The condition was eventually diagnosed as a severe viral infection. Waugh made only 209 runs at 20.90 for the series, with only one half-century. He hit two centuries in the tour matches, including one against Middlesex at Lord&#x27;s. In the sixth Test, he was dismissed in both innings by his old sparring partner Tufnell, who he had criticised at the start of the series as a &quot;fairly weak sort of player&quot;.

Waugh&#x27;s performances in England had stirred questions about his position in the team. The scrutiny increased after Waugh failed to pass 20 in the first Test against New Zealand in Brisbane and dropped a catch. Waugh made a turnaround in the second Test in Perth, taking a horizontal airborne catch of Chris Cairns at full stretch. He proceeded to score 86, including a lofted drive from Daniel Vettori onto the roof of the Lillee-Marsh Stand. The ball travelled approximately 130 m, one of the longest sixes in history. Australia went on to win the match and Waugh made 81 in the third Test and ended the series with 196 runs at 39.20, enough to save his position in the team.

===Consecutive centuries===
In the 1997–98 Test series against South Africa, Waugh finished the year with 0 and 1 against South Africa in the Boxing Day Test match in Melbourne. Waugh scored 100 in the New Year&#x27;s Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground to set up an Australian victory. This came during a 116-run partnership with his brother, noted for a particularly menacing spell by Allan Donald with the second new ball, repeatedly hitting the twins. He batted out the entire fifth day for an unbeaten 115 in the third Test at the Adelaide Oval to deny the South Africans a victory and win the series for Australia. Having scored 63 in the first innings, Waugh came the crease late on the fourth day with Australia at 2/17 and attempting to survive for a draw. He was dropped early and was 11 at stumps. Waugh continued to resist on the following day and brought up his century. Struck by a bouncer from Shaun Pollock late on the final day, Waugh broke the stumps with his bat while walking away, so South Africa appealed for hit wicket, which was denied. South African skipper Hansie Cronje later speared a stump through the umpires&#x27; dressing room in anger at the decision. It was only the second time in his career that he had scored consecutive centuries. Waugh took satisfaction in the fact that his century was responsible for saving the Test. He finished the series with 279 runs at 69.75.

The 1997–98 Australian season marked a change in Waugh&#x27;s ODI career. The Australian selectors changed their policy and picked Test and ODI teams separately, with specialists chosen accordingly in either form of the game. Waugh&#x27;s captain and opening partner Taylor was dropped. Australia had trouble finding a suitable partner for Waugh, with Michael di Venuto, Tom Moody and Stuart Law all trialled as his opening partner. Despite the instability, Waugh compiled 104 to help Australia successfully chase a target against New Zealand in a round-robin match at the Adelaide Oval. He finished the series as Australia&#x27;s leading runscorer with 320 runs at 35.55, and took seven wickets at 25.43. During the finals series, new wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist was elevated to the opening position. The new combination got off to a poor start, with Waugh run out for three in a mix-up in the first final, but the pair went on to become Australia&#x27;s long term opening pair. After losing all four group matches to South Africa, Australia won the finals series 2–1. The partnership with Gilchrist marked a shift in Waugh&#x27;s role in ODIs. Waugh had previously been more aggressive while Taylor was his partner, but with the naturally aggressive Gilchrist as his partner, Waugh tended to anchor the innings.

Waugh&#x27;s strong start to the year continued in two brief ODI series in New Zealand and India, in which he scored 374 runs at 41.56 respectively, with three half-centuries. Australia lost the first two Tests in India, with Waugh scoring 66 in the first innings in the first Test in Chennai but otherwise failing to pass 20. In the third Test in Bangalore, Waugh scored his highest Test score of 153 not out while suffering nausea, vomiting and fever. He was 58 at stumps on the second day before being taken ill and requiring overnight injections. It was the first time that he had batted without his helmet, instead using a floppy hat due to the heat and fever. He claimed that he could not recall much of the innings and was batting on &quot;automatic pilot&quot;. Waugh was the only Australian to aggregate more than 200 runs for the series, finishing with 280 runs at 70.00. Australia played nine more ODIs for the year in Asia, spread across three series. Waugh scored 266 runs at 23.25. Waugh was also a part of the limited overs team that won a silver medal at the 1998 Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, losing the final to South Africa. The matches were not accredited as ODIs by the International Cricket Council (ICC).

Australia toured Pakistan in late 1998. In the first Test in Rawalpindi, Waugh scored a duck as Australia won by an innings, its first Test win in Pakistan in 39 years. His tour was disrupted by an appearance at a judicial hearing to give evidence relating to allegations of match-fixing he made against Saleem Malik. After making 42 and 43 in the high-scoring second Test in Peshawar, Waugh scored 117 in the second innings of the third Test in Karachi to end the series with 228 runs at 45.60.

===Bribery scandal re-emerges===
Waugh made starts in all four innings of the first two Ashes Tests in Australia in 1998–99, scoring 31, 27*, 36 and 17* as the first two matches were drawn and won respectively. In the build-up to the third Test in Adelaide, news broke that in 1994–95 Waugh and Shane Warne had accepted money from an Indian bookmaker in exchange for pitch and weather information. The Australian Cricket Board (ACB) has secretly fined both players for their actions. The ACB&#x27;s suppression of the case and the actions of the two players were widely condemned.

Waugh was booed when he went out to bat in the first innings and, apparently rattled by the hostile reception, he batted scratchily for 36 minutes before being dismissed for seven. He regarded it as the most difficult day of his career. In the second innings, he scored an unbeaten 51 and was given a standing ovation by some parts of the crowd in contrast to other hostile sections. He took three catches in England&#x27;s second innings as Australia won the match to retain the Ashes. Waugh scored 36 and 43 in the Boxing Day Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, which saw him pass 1,000 Test runs for the calendar year.

Waugh started 1999 as he did the previous year, with a century in the New Year&#x27;s Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground. After being dropped before he had scored, Waugh scored 121 in five hours on the first day, sharing a partnership of 190 with his brother. He became the fifth Australian to take 100 Test catches when he caught Nasser Hussain in the first innings from the bowling of Colin Miller. Australia won the Test and Waugh ended the series with 393 runs at 56.14, placing him second in the batting averages. In the ODI series, he scored six consecutive half-centuries in a consistent run that augured well for the upcoming World Cup. His tally of 542 runs at 49.27 was the highest for the tournament. For the majority of the ODI tournament, Waugh acted as vice-captain to Warne as his brother Steve was sidelined by a hamstring strain.

===1999 World Cup===
Taylor retired after the Australian summer and Waugh&#x27;s brother became the Test captain and the first assignment was a tour of the Caribbean. Waugh had a modest Test series, finishing with 202 runs at 25.25 as Australia retained the Frank Worrell Trophy 2–2. His best score was 67 in the first innings of second Test, which was terminated when he was bowled by a ball that scooted along the ground. Speculation about his future began to simmer again. He then made 217 runs at 31.00 in the ODIs, Australia&#x27;s second highest runscorer, before the team headed to England for the 1999 World Cup.

Waugh started the tournament with a Man of the Match 67 against Scotland in Worcester as Australia unconvincingly won by four wickets in its first match. He then scored two and 41 as Australia lost to New Zealand and Pakistan respectively, leaving them needing to avoid defeat in all of their remaining matches to win the World Cup. Waugh scored only 33 and three as Australia defeated Bangladesh and the West Indies to progress to the Super Six phase. Needing to win all their matches, Waugh top-scored with 83 against India at The Oval in a win. He then scored 104 from 120 balls against Zimbabwe at Lord&#x27;s in another victory. In the process, he passed Allan Border&#x27;s Australian record of 6,524 ODI career runs and became the first person to score four centuries in World Cup competition. He dedicated this achievement to his dying grandfather. He was then run out for five in the final Super Six match against South Africa. In the semi-final against same team, he was dismissed without scoring. Waugh participated in the final play of the match. With the scores tied in the last over of South Africa&#x27;s run chase and with one wicket remaining, he fielded the ball as Lance Klusener and Allan Donald attempted the winning run. The South Africans had a mix-up and a run out resulted in a tie. The Australians progressed to the final as they had won their previous meeting.

In the final against Pakistan at Lord&#x27;s, he set the tone of the match with a sideways diving catch to dismiss Wajahatullah Wasti. Pakistan were bowled out for 132. Waugh was 37 not out when Darren Lehmann struck the winning runs. He finished the tournament with 375 runs at 41.67, making him Australia&#x27;s second highest runscorer for the tournament.

In late 1999, Australia toured Sri Lanka. Waugh continued to perform in the ODIs, with 174 runs at 34.80, but his Test troubles continued with 29 runs at 7.25. In six Tests on the island nation, he had managed 90 runs at an average of 9.00. Australia proceeded to Zimbabwe, where Waugh scored 90 in a ten-wicket win. Had he reached his century, Waugh would have become the first player to record centuries against the eight other Test-playing nations. Waugh then scored 106 from 97 balls in the first ODI before scoring 54* in the second match. That ended his ODI year, with a total of 1468 runs at 44.48.

===Close to omission and 100th Test match===

He made a strong start to the 1999–00 Australian summer, scoring 100 in the first Test against Pakistan in Brisbane and then taking a reflex catch to dismiss Inzamam-ul-Haq in the second Test at Bellerive Oval, although he only scored five and a duck. However, after a duck in the third Test in Perth, he gave a poor display in the first Test against India at the Adelaide Oval which led to calls for his axing. After being dismissed for five in the first innings, he came out to bat in the second innings late on the third day and was protected from the strike by Greg Blewett, who refused to take singles hit into the outfield. After being jeered, he was eventually dismissed the next day for eight, after batting almost an hour. Waugh made only one and 25 in an interstate match following the Test but was retained for the Boxing Day Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. He managed a survivalist 41 in the first innings and an unbeaten 51 against the backdrop of a supportive crowd. He was then on a hat-trick in the second innings as Australia won the Test. Waugh was retained and made his 100th Test appearance in the 2000 New Year&#x27;s Test in Sydney, where he scored 32 in his only innings.

Further poor displays in the early phase of the subsequent ODI tournament, including an innings of 3 from 30 balls, lead to repeated calls for his omission, until he scored a 116 at the Adelaide Oval on Australia Day against India to lay the foundation for Australia&#x27;s largest ever total on home soil of 5/329. Waugh ended the series with 305 runs at 30.50 and was retained for the tour of New Zealand, where he scored a respectable 206 runs at 41.20 in the abbreviated form of the game including two half-centuries. He then scored an unbeaten 72 in the first Test at Eden Park to set up a victory in a low-scoring game—only one other player passed 20. Waugh ended the series with 190 runs at 47.50 as Australia won 3–0. However, a run of seven ODIs during the 2000 Australian winter including two series against South Africa in which he tallied only 84 runs at 12.00 again saw further media speculation of impending demise.

===Return to form===
After the being close to omission the previous season, Waugh made a good start to the 2000–01 season, scoring 119 against the West Indies in the second Test in Perth. He added two further half-centuries to total 339 runs at 48.4 as the Windies were defeated 5–0. His productive summer continued in the limited overs format when he went on to score an Australian ODI record of 173 in the second tri-series final against the West Indies at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. It was one of three ODI centuries he scored in that tournament, the others being a 112 and 102, both not out, against the West Indies and Zimbabwe respectively. In total he scored 540 runs in the series at an average of 108.00. As the leading runscorer by far in the tournament, he was expected to be named Player of the Series, resulting in widespread crowd jeering when it was instead awarded to Brian Lara. Waugh was also tipped to win the Allan Border Medal due to his prolific runscoring that year. However, despite leading the player votes with 32, the umpire and media thought otherwise, awarding Steve Waugh 37 votes to his 32, making Steve the winner 65–64.

The 2001 tour of India saw Australia&#x27;s 16 Test winning streak come to an end when India claimed the series 2–1. Waugh scored 70 and 57 in the third Test in Chennai to finish with 149 runs at 29.80 in a difficult series. Waugh continued his fine ODI form with another century, an unbeaten 133 against India in the second ODI, but was forced to return home after his finger was fractured by a Javagal Srinath delivery.

===Catching world record===

During the 2001 Ashes series, Waugh topped the aggregates with 430 runs, scoring Test centuries at Lord&#x27;s (108) and The Oval (120). He broke Mark Taylor&#x27;s world record of 157 Test catches. Waugh was unable to maintain this form in the 2001–02 Australian summer: he totalled 269 (at 33.6) in six Tests against New Zealand and South Africa, without a century. Media scrutiny of his inability to combat short-pitched bowling increased and led to speculation about his long-term future in the team.

Nevertheless, he passed two major milestones: the Test at Adelaide marked the 100th Test in which both Waughs played, while the following game was his 100th consecutive Test match. Waugh and fellow ODI opener Adam Gilchrist both hit a batting slump during the VB series, with Waugh averaging 26 for the series and Gilchrist less. Frequent poor starts to the innings resulted in Australia&#x27;s failure to qualify for the final of the tri-series for the first time in five years. Later in the year, the selectors reacted by dropping Steve and Mark Waugh, the oldest members of the team, in favour of younger players.

===Final series===
Maintaining his place in the Test team, Waugh toured South Africa in early 2002. Although he passed 15 in each of his innings, he managed only one half-century in his 169 runs at 33.8. In an attempt to regain form, he had a brief stint with Essex in the English County Championship. In the subsequent three-Test series against Pakistan, played on neutral grounds in Sri Lanka and the United Arab Emirates due to security reasons, he made only 80 runs at 20. Waugh retired from international cricket in late 2002 after being omitted for the upcoming Test series against England in favour of Darren Lehmann.

Waugh retired as Australia&#x27;s highest run scorer and century maker (18) in ODI cricket, with these records having since been broken by Ricky Ponting. His world record of 181 Test catches was broken by India&#x27;s Rahul Dravid in 2009.

==Fielding==
Waugh took a record 181 catches in Test matches, the second highest for a non-wicketkeeper. He primarily fielded in the second slip position whilst a fast bowler was operating. He would field at silly point whilst a spin bowler was operating and then at first slip for a spinner following the retirement of Mark Taylor. Additionally, he would field at mid-wicket or short mid-wicket when he was not required in a close catching position and also during ODIs.

==Involvement with bookmakers==
In 1993, Waugh was a member of the Australian team competing in the Hong Kong Sixes; one of the Indian team was Test all-rounder Manoj Prabhakar. A report by the Central Bureau of Investigation in 2000 implicated Prabhakar for acting as a conduit for bookmakers involved in illegal cricket betting, which resulted in Prabhakar receiving a five-year suspension from the game. The report also documented allegations by Indian bookmaker Mukesh Gupta that Prabhakar had introduced him to Waugh during the tournament and that Waugh was paid A$20,000 for insider information about the Australian team, pitch conditions and weather information.

When the allegations were made public by the report in November 2000, Waugh immediately pledged to co-operate with any inquiry. In January 2001, the International Cricket Council&#x27;s anti-corruption unit and the ACB&#x27;s special investigator Greg Melick requested an interview with Waugh, which his management &quot;presently declined&quot;. Waugh received legal advice to seek further clarification of the scope of the investigation. After condemnation from the ACB and media, and the possibility of losing his contract with the ACB, Waugh agreed to the interview. He was cleared in August 2001.

During the Singer World Series tournament, played in Sri Lanka during September 1994, Waugh made a decision which came back to affect his career four years later. He was approached in Colombo by an Indian named &quot;John&quot;, a bookmaker who asked him for general pitch and weather information as well as insider team information. In return, Waugh received US$4,000. The arrangement continued during the 1994–95 Australian summer, but he refused to divulge inside team information. Waugh introduced &quot;John&quot; to Shane Warne.

On the 1994 tour of Pakistan, Waugh claimed that along with Warne and Tim May, he was offered A$200,000 to underperform by Pakistan captain Saleem Malik. The offer was in regard to an ODI played in Rawalpindi on 22 October. Waugh says he rejected the bribe and went on to score 121* from 134 deliveries in the match. The trio signed a statement in early 1995 stating their claims, which were forwarded to the ICC. In October 1995, a Pakistan Cricket Board inquiry led by former Pakistan Supreme Court judge Fakhruddin G. Ebrahim ruled that the allegations, &quot;are not worthy of any credence and must be rejected as unfounded&quot;. Further, he stated that they &quot;appear to have been concocted&quot;.

However, during the 1998 tour of Pakistan, the issue was again raised, as the Government of Pakistan had initiated a separate judicial inquiry into general issues regarding the performance of the Pakistani team and allegations of illegal betting by past and former players. Waugh, along with his captain Mark Taylor and ACB CEO Malcolm Speed, were summoned to Lahore by PCB CEO Majid Khan to appear before an inquiry led by Justice Malik Mohammed Qayyum.

In December 1998, prior to the Adelaide Test match against England, news broke that Waugh and Warne were involved with &quot;John&quot; four years earlier and had been fined by the ACB. Both players were required to make public statements acknowledging that they had been, &quot;naive and stupid&quot; and reasserting that they were not involved in corruption. The players were widely condemned by the media and public, with Prime Minister of Australia John Howard stating that he felt an &quot;intense feeling of disappointment&quot;. Former Test player Neil Harvey called for both players to be banned. In May 2000, the PCB banned Malik for life, after a recommendation from the Qayyum investigation, which concluded that Malik had attempted to bribe Waugh, Warne and May.

==After cricket==
In 2002, Waugh did a brief stint as Nine Network cricket commentator during the 3-match Australia-Pakistan ODI series.

Waugh was previously a commentator on Network Ten for the Big Bash as well as a national selector. In 2018, Ten lost the rights to the Big Bash.

He was named as an opening batsman in Australia&#x27;s &quot;greatest ever ODI team.&quot; He was also inducted into the Australian Hall of Fame by CA in 2014.

In 2018–19, Waugh joined Adam Gilchrist as a cricket commentator for Fox Sports.

After separating from Sue Porter - his partner of 17 years in 2004 - he then married Sydney Cup-winning thoroughbred trainer Kim Waugh (née Moore) on 9 April 2005.

== International centuries ==

Waugh scored 38 international centuries - 20 in Test matches and 18 in ODIs.

<text>Ian Michael Chappell (born 26 September 1943) is a former cricketer who played for South Australia and Australia. Known as &quot;Chappelli&quot;, he is considered as one of the greatest captains the game has seen. He captained Australia between 1971 and 1975 before taking a central role in the breakaway World Series Cricket organisation. Born into a cricketing family—his grandfather and brother also captained Australia—Chappell made a hesitant start to international cricket playing as a right-hand middle-order batsman and spin bowler. He found his niche when promoted to bat at number three. Chappell&#x27;s blunt verbal manner led to a series of confrontations with opposition players and cricket administrators; the issue of sledging first arose during his tenure as captain, and he was a driving force behind the professionalisation of Australian cricket in the 1970s. He was the captain of the Australian squad which finished as runners-up at the 1975 Cricket World Cup.

John Arlott called him &quot;a cricketer of effect rather than the graces&quot;. An animated presence at the batting crease, he constantly adjusted his equipment and clothing, and restlessly tapped his bat on the ground as the bowler ran in. Basing his game on a sound defence learned during many hours of childhood lessons, Chappell employed the drive and square cut to full effect. He had an idiosyncratic method of playing back and across to a ball of full length and driving wide of mid-on, but his trademark shot was the hook, saying &quot;three bouncers an over should be worth 12 runs to me&quot;. A specialist slip fielder, he was the fourth player to take one hundred Test catches.

Since his retirement in 1980, he has pursued a high-profile career as a sports journalist and cricket commentator, predominantly with Channel Nine. He remains a key figure in Australian cricket: in 2006, Shane Warne called Chappell the biggest influence on his career. Chappell was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1986, the FICA Cricket Hall of Fame in 2000 and the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 2003. On 9 July 2009, Ian Chappell was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.

== Family and early career ==
The first of four sons (Ian, Greg, Trevor, Michel) born in Unley, near Adelaide, to Martin and Jeanne (), Chappell was steeped in the game from an early age. His father was a noted Adelaide grade cricketer who put a bat in his hands as soon as he could walk, and his maternal grandfather was famous all-round sportsman Vic Richardson, who captained Australia at the end of a nineteen-Test career. Chappell was given weekly batting lessons from the age of five, as were younger brothers Greg and Trevor, who both also went on to play for Australia.

Chappell grew up in the beachside suburb of Glenelg and attended the local St Leonard&#x27;s Primary School where he played his first competitive match at the age of seven. He was later selected for the South Australian state schoolboys team. He then enrolled at Prince Alfred College, a private secondary school noted for producing many Test cricketers, including the Australian captains Joe Darling and Clem Hill. His other sporting pursuits included Australian football and baseball: Chappell&#x27;s performances for South Australia in the Claxton Shield won him All-Australian selection in 1964 and 1966 as a catcher. He credits Vic Richardson, who had represented both SA and Australia in baseball during the 1920s, for his love of the sport. At the age of 18, his form in grade cricket for Glenelg led to his first-class debut for South Australia (SA) against Tasmania in early 1962.

The aggressive style of Sobers and of South Australia captain Les Favell heavily influenced Chappell during his formative years in senior cricket. In 1962–63, Chappell made his initial first-class century against a New South Wales team led by Australian captain Richie Benaud, who was bemused by the young batsman&#x27;s habit of gritting his teeth as he faced up; to Benaud, it looked as if he was grinning. Chappell spent the northern summer of 1963 as a professional in England&#x27;s Lancashire League with Ramsbottom and played a single first-class match for Lancashire against Cambridge University.

== International career ==
In 1963–64, Chappell batted at number three for SA for the first time, in a match against Queensland at Brisbane, and scored 205 not out. He was the youngest member of the SA team that won the Sheffield Shield that season. A century against Victoria early the following season resulted in Chappell&#x27;s selection for a one-off Test against Pakistan at Melbourne in December 1964. He made 11 and took four catches, but was dropped until the Fourth Test in the 1965–66 Ashes series. Chappell supplemented his aggressive batting with brilliant fielding in the slips, and he showed promise as a leg-spinner. At this point, the selectors and captain Bob Simpson considered him an all-rounder: he batted at number seven and bowled 26 (eight-ball) overs for the match.

===Hesitant start===
He retained his place for the following Test and for the tour of South Africa in summer 1966–67. Playing in a side defeated 1–3, Chappell struggled to make an impression. His highest score in ten Test innings was 49, while his five wickets cost 59 runs each. On the advice of Simpson, he ceased playing the hook shot as it was often leading to his dismissal. In the first Test of 1967–68 against India, he failed twice batting in the middle order. Heading into the second Test at Melbourne, Chappell&#x27;s place was in jeopardy, but he rode his luck to score 151 – his innings contained five chances that the Indians failed to take. However, in the remainder of the series, he managed only 46 runs in four innings, so his selection for the 1968 tour of England was based as much on potential as form.

In England, Chappell rewarded the faith of the selectors by scoring the most first-class runs on the tour (1,261 runs, including 202 not out against Warwickshire), leading the Australian Test aggregates with 348 runs (at 43.50). His top score was 81 in the fourth Test at Leeds. &quot;Wisden&quot; lauded his play off the back foot and judged him the most difficult Australian batsman to dismiss.

===Promotion to number three===
A string of big scores and a record number of catches during the 1968–69 season earned Chappell the Australian Cricketer of the Year award. Against the touring West Indies, Chappell hit 188 not out, 123, 117, 180 and 165 before the New Year. Two of these centuries came in the Test series, when Chappell&#x27;s average for 548 runs was 68.50. Chappell was elevated to number three in the batting order and became a less-frequent bowler; he was also appointed vice-captain of the team.

Following up with a successful tour of India in late 1969, Chappell demonstrated his fluency against spin bowling by compiling Test innings of 138 at Delhi and 99 at Kolkata. His ability against both fast and slow bowling earned high praise, including from his captain Bill Lawry. When the Australians arrived in South Africa in early 1970, following their victory over India, Lawry told the local media that Chappell was the best all-round batsman in the world. His appraisal looked misguided when Chappell managed just 92 runs (at 11.5 average), with a top score of 34, as Australia lost 0–4.

On this tour, Chappell clashed with cricket administrators over pay and conditions for the first time. The South African authorities requested that an extra Test be added to the fixture and the Australian Board of Control consented. Incensed that the players were not consulted about the change, Chappell led a group of his teammates in a demand for more money to play the proposed game. Eventually the match was cancelled after Chappell and his supporters refused to back down.

===Captaincy===

Chappell became South Australian captain when the long-serving Les Favell retired at the start of the 1970–1971 season. His younger brother Greg made his debut in the second Test of the summer against Ray Illingworth&#x27;s England. Facing an English attack led by the hostile fast bowling of John Snow, Chappell scored a half-century in each of the first two Tests, but failed to capitalise on good starts while Greg Chappell scored 108 in his initial innings. Rain caused the abandonment of the third Test without a ball being bowled. Temporarily promoted to open the batting, Chappell failed in the fourth Test as Australia lost. In the fifth Test at Melbourne, he returned to number three and started nervously. Dropped on 0 and 14, Chappell found form and went on to post his maiden Ashes century (111 from 212 balls), which he followed with scores of 28 and 104 in the sixth Test.

The washed-out Test resulted in a late change to the schedule and an unprecedented seventh Test was played at Sydney in February 1971. Trailing 0–1 in the series, Australia could retain The Ashes by winning this game. Australia&#x27;s performances were hampered by playing slow, defensive cricket. In a radical attempt to breathe some aggression into the team, the selectors sacked captain Bill Lawry and appointed Chappell in his stead. Dismayed by the manner of Lawry&#x27;s dismissal, Chappell responded with an attacking performance as captain, he won the toss, put England in and dismissed them for 184, and Australia led the first innings by 80 runs, but set 223 to win they folded for 160 and lost The Ashes after holding them for 12 years. Chappell gained some consolation at the end of a dramatic summer when he led SA to the Sheffield Shield, the team&#x27;s first win for seven years.

Chappell&#x27;s battles against the short-pitched bowling of Snow during the season compelled him to reappraise his game. Following a conversation with Sir Donald Bradman, he decided to reinstate the hook shot and spent the winter months practising the stroke by hitting baseballs thrown by his brother Greg.

===A team in his own image===
Australia lost an unofficial Test series to a Rest of the World team led by Gary Sobers that toured in 1971–72 as a replacement for the politically unacceptable South Africans. Chappell was the outstanding batsman of the series, with four centuries included in his 634 runs, at an average of 79.25. He took the team to England in 1972 and was unlucky not to regain The Ashes in a rubber that ended 2–2. The series began disastrously for Chappell when he was out hooking from the first ball he faced in the opening Test at Manchester. He fell the same way in the second innings and Australia lost the match. However, the team regrouped and had the better of the remaining matches, apart from the fourth Test at Leeds, played on a controversial pitch that the Australians believed was &quot;doctored&quot; to suit the England team. Greg Chappell emerged as a prolific batsman during the series, batting one place below his brother in the order. The siblings shared several crucial partnerships, most notably 201 at the Oval in the last Test when they became the first brothers to score centuries in the same Test innings. Australia won the game, an effort that Chappell later cited as the turning point in the team&#x27;s performances.

In 1972–73, Australia had resounding victories against Pakistan (at home) and the West Indies (away). Chappell&#x27;s leadership qualities stood out in a number of tight situations. He hit his highest Test score of 196 (from 243 balls) in the first Test against Pakistan at Adelaide. Pakistan &quot;appeared probable winners of the last two Tests on the second last day of each game&quot;, yet Chappell&#x27;s team managed to win on both occasions.

On indifferent pitches in the Caribbean, Chappell was the highest-scoring batsman of the Test series with 542 runs (at 77.4 average). He hit 209 in a tour match against Barbados, two Test centuries and a &quot;glorious&quot; 97 on a poor pitch at Trinidad in the third Test, batting with an injured ankle. This set up a dramatic last day when the West Indies needed just 66 runs to win with six wickets in hand at lunch. The home team collapsed against an inspired Australian bowling attack supported by Chappell&#x27;s aggressive field-placements.

===The ugly Australians===

Australia played six Tests against New Zealand on both sides of the Tasman in 1973–74. Chappell led his team to a 2–0 victory in the three Tests played in Australia. During the third Test at Adelaide, he equalled the world record of six catches in a Test match by a fielder, which was beaten by his brother Greg the following season. In the drawn first Test at Wellington, the Chappells became the first brothers to each score a century in both innings of a Test match. The Australians lost to the Kiwis for the first time ever in the second Test at Christchurch, when Chappell was involved in a verbal confrontation with the leading New Zealand batsman, Glenn Turner. The Australians then played an ill-tempered tour match at Dunedin that didn&#x27;t enhance the reputation of Chappell or his team, before winning the final Test at Auckland. On this tour, the behaviour of the team was questioned with some journalists labelling them &quot;ugly Australians&quot;. In 1976, Chappell wrote about his attitude to the opposition:
... although we didn&#x27;t deliberately set out to be a &#x27;bunch of bastards&#x27; when we walked on to the field, I&#x27;d much prefer any team I captained to be described like that than as &#x27;a nice bunch of blokes on the field.&#x27; As captain of Australia my philosophy was simple: between 11.00am and 6.00pm there was no time to be a nice guy. I believed that on the field players should concentrate on giving their best to the team, to themselves and to winning; in other words, playing hard and fairly within the rules. To my mind, doing all that left no time for being a nice guy.

The increasing prevalence of verbal confrontation on the field (later known as sledging) concerned cricket administrators and became a regular topic for the media. Its instigation is sometimes attributed to Chappell. By his own admission, he was a frequent user of profanity who was often at &quot;boiling point&quot; on the field, but claims that the various incidents he was involved in were not a premeditated tactic. Rather, they were a case of him losing his temper with an opponent.

===The Ashes regained and the first World Cup===

The highlight of Chappell&#x27;s career was Australia&#x27;s 4–1 win over England in 1974–75 that reclaimed The Ashes. Strengthened by the new fast bowling partnership of Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson, the Australians played aggressive cricket and received criticism for the amount of short-pitched bowling they employed. Chappell scored 90 on an &quot;unreliable&quot; pitch on the first day of the opening Test at Brisbane. He finished the six Tests with 387 runs at 35.18 average, and took 11 catches in the slips. The Test matches attracted big crowds and record gate takings, enabling Chappell to negotiate a bonus for the players from the Australian Cricket Board (ACB). Although this more than doubled the players&#x27; pay, their remuneration amounted to only 4.5% of the revenue generated by the series.

Within months, Chappell was back in England leading Australia in the inaugural World Cup. His dislike of the defensive nature of limited-over cricket led to the Australians placing a full slips cordon for the new ball and employing Test-match style tactics in the tournament. Despite the apparent unsuitability of this approach, Chappell guided the team to the final where they lost a memorable match to the West Indies.

The workload of the captaincy was telling on Chappell and the four-Test Ashes series that followed the World Cup dampened his appetite for the game. After winning the only completed match of the series, the first Test at Birmingham, Australia&#x27;s retention of the Ashes was anticlimactic: the third Test at Leeds was abandoned due to vandalism of the pitch during the night before the last day&#x27;s play. In the last Test at the Oval, Chappell scored 192 from 367 balls to set up an apparent victory. However, England managed to bat for almost 15 hours to grind out a draw and Chappell announced his resignation from the captaincy on the final day of the match. In 30 Tests as captain, he scored 2,550 runs at an average of 50, with seven centuries.

===First retirement===
Remaining available for Test cricket, he played in the 1975–76 series against the West Indies under the captaincy of his brother Greg. Australia avenged their loss in the World Cup final by winning 5–1, claiming the unofficial title of best team in the world. During the season, Chappell incurred censure for his behaviour in a Sheffield Shield match and was warned not to continue wearing a pair of adidas boots with the three stripes clearly visible. This breached the prevailing protocol of cricketers wearing all white. His highest innings of the summer was 156 during Australia&#x27;s only loss, at Perth in the second Test. &quot;Wisden&quot; nominated him as the most influential player of the series for his 449 runs at an average of 44.90. Throughout the course of the series, Chappell passed two significant milestones when he became the fourth Australian to make 5,000 runs in Test cricket and the first player to hold one hundred Test catches for Australia. The summer ended in controversy and triumph in the domestic competition. During a dispute with the SACA over team selection, he threatened a &quot;strike&quot; action by the SA team. After the matter was resolved, Chappell led the side to the Sheffield Shield title for the second time in his career and shared the inaugural Sheffield Shield player of the season award with his brother Greg. He retired from first-class cricket at the end of the season, aged only 32.

== World Series Cricket and aftermath ==
In 1976, Chappell toured South Africa with Richie Benaud&#x27;s International Wanderers team, released his autobiography &quot;Chappelli&quot; and was named as one of five Wisden Cricketers of the Year. He was hired to spend the summer of 1976–77 as a guest professional in the Melbourne district competition where he was paid more than he had been as Australian captain. During the season, he was involved in a famous altercation with a young English all-rounder who was in Victoria on a cricketing scholarship, Ian Botham. Both men have put forward vastly different versions as to what happened during the physical confrontation in a Melbourne pub. The animosity between them continues and Channel Nine used it as a marketing ploy when Botham temporarily partnered Chappell as a television commentator during the 1998–99 season. Botham again revived the feud in his 2007 autobiography with another version of the incident.

===Rebel skipper===
Throughout his career, Chappell found the ACB obdurate in his attempts to make a living from the game. In 1969 and 1970, they refused his applications to play professionally in England. As Australian captain, he made several unsuccessful representations at ACB meetings in an effort to secure a more realistic financial deal for the Australian players. In consultations with the then-president of the ACTU, Bob Hawke, he explored the possibility of unionising the players.

Approached to lead an Australian team in World Series Cricket (WSC), a breakaway professional competition organised by Kerry Packer for Channel Nine, Chappell signed a three-year contract worth A$75,000 in 1976. His participation was, &quot;fundamental to the credibility of the enterprise&quot;. Chappell devised the list of Australian players to be signed, and was involved in the organisation and marketing of WSC. His central role was the result of, &quot;years of personal disaffection with cricket officialdom&quot;, in particular Don Bradman. Recently, Chappell wrote:
While captaining Australia, I was approached on three separate occasions before WSC to play &#x27;professional&#x27; cricket, and each time I advised the entrepreneurs to meet the appropriate cricket board because they controlled the grounds. On each occasion, the administrators sent the entrepreneurs packing and it quickly became clear they weren&#x27;t interested in a better deal for the players.

That&#x27;s why I say the players didn&#x27;t stab the ACB in the back. The administrators had numerous opportunities to reach a compromise but displayed little interest in the welfare of the players. It wasn&#x27;t really surprising then that more than 50 players from around the world signed lucrative WSC contracts and a revolution was born. About half of the WSC players were from Australia and this high ratio can, in part, be attributed to Bradman&#x27;s tight-fisted approach to the ACB&#x27;s money.

In WSC&#x27;s debut season of 1977–78, Chappell hit the first Supertest century and finished fifth in overall averages. The prevalence of short-pitched fast bowling and a serious injury to Australian David Hookes led to the innovation of batting helmets; Chappell was one of the many batsmen to use one. Following their 1975–76 tour of Australia, the West Indies adopted a four-man fast bowling attack, while the World XI contained fast bowlers of the calibre of Imran Khan, Mike Procter, Garth Le Roux, Clive Rice and Sarfraz Nawaz. The constant diet of pace bowling undermined the confidence of some batsmen during WSC. Chappell&#x27;s form fell away during the second season and he scored only 181 runs at 25.85 in four Supertests. During the last six days of the season, the WSC Australians lost the finals of both the limited-overs competition (to the West Indies XI) and the Supertest series (to the World XI), thus forfeiting the winner-takes-all prize money. After the latter match, Chappell vented his frustrations on World XI captain Tony Greig by refusing to shake his hand and criticising Greig&#x27;s inconsequential contribution to his team&#x27;s victory. The final act of the competition was a series between the WSC Australians and the WSC West Indies played in the Caribbean in the spring of 1979. After the Australians suffered a heavy defeat in the first Supertest at Jamaica, Chappell rallied his team to draw the five match series one-all. His best effort were scores of 61 and 86 at Barbados.

===Return to Tests===
Convinced to return to official cricket when WSC ended, Chappell resumed as captain of SA in 1979–80, a decision he later regretted. It was a season too far for the increasingly irascible Chappell. Reported by an umpire for swearing in a match against Tasmania, he received a three-week suspension. In his first match after the ban, he was again reported for his conduct in a game against the touring English team. Given a suspended ban by the ACB, he was then selected for Australia&#x27;s last three Tests of the season. His Test career finished with scores of 75 and 26 not out at the MCG against England in February 1980. In his final first-class match, SA needed to beat Victoria to win the Sheffield Shield. Although Chappell scored 112, SA lost the match and the shield. Ironically, the umpires voted him the competition&#x27;s player of the season for a second time.

===ODI record===
Chappell&#x27;s aggressive approach suited limited-overs cricket; he scored his runs at a strike-rate of 77 runs per hundred balls. The timing of his career limited him to 16 ODI matches, but he appeared in a number of historic fixtures such as the first ODI (at the MCG in 1971), the first World Cup final (at Lord&#x27;s in 1975) and the first day/night match (during WSC, at VFL Park in 1978). He passed fifty in half of his innings with a top score of 86 at Christchurch in 1973–74. In his final season of international cricket, he scored 63 not out (from 65 balls) against the West Indies at the SCG to win the player of the match award; five days later he hit an unbeaten 60 from 50 balls in his penultimate ODI appearance, against England. As captain, he recorded six wins and five losses from 11 matches. He is also credited to have hit the first ever six in an ODI match (which is in fact the first ODI match ever played).

===Legacy===
The title of the ABC&#x27;s documentary &quot;The Chappell Era&quot;, broadcast in 2002, encapsulated Chappell&#x27;s significance to Australian cricket. Subtitled &quot;Cricket in the &#x27;70s&quot;, it chronicled the rise of the Australian cricket team under Chappell, the fight for better pay for the players, and professionalisation of the game through WSC. During the program, Chappell reiterated his criticisms of cricket&#x27;s administration at the time.

In &quot;Wisden&quot;, Richie Benaud wrote, &quot;Chappell will be remembered as much for his bid to improve the players&#x27; lot as he will for his run-getting and captaincy&quot;. During the WSC period, he founded a players&#x27; association with a loan provided by Kerry Packer. Despite Chappell&#x27;s continued support for the organisation after his retirement, apathy and a lack of recognition from the ACB led to its demise in 1988. Revived in 1997 as the Australian Cricketers&#x27; Association (ACA), it is now an important organisation within the structure of Australian cricket. In 2005, Chappell became a member of the ACA executive.

Chappell was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1986, the FICA Cricket Hall of Fame in 2000 and the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 2003. Two new grandstands at the Adelaide Oval were named the Chappell Stands; at the dedication ceremony in 2003, the SACA president Ian McLachlan called the Chappells, &quot;the most famous cricketing family in South Australia&quot;. In 2004, the Chappell family was again honoured with the creation of the Chappell–Hadlee Trophy, an annual series of ODI matches played between Australia and New Zealand.

Chappell is the leading advocate for greater formal recognition of the first Australian sporting team to travel overseas, the Australian Aboriginal cricket team in England in 1868.

== Feud with Ian Botham ==
Chappell has an infamous feud with Ian Botham. It started over an incident in 1977 and continues to this day. The pair were assigned to commentate together in 1998 and didn&#x27;t exchange a word.
In 2023, the pair were brought together for a TV special and it only seemed to make matters worse and reignite the feud.

== Media career ==
Following the path of his grandfather Vic Richardson, who was a radio commentator for many years, Chappell entered the media in 1973 by writing magazine articles and a column for &quot;The Age&quot;. He did television commentary for the 0–10 Network and the BBC before playing WSC. During the 1980s, Chappell spent eight years co-hosting with Mike Gibson, &quot;Wide World of Sports&quot;, an innovative magazine-style program broadcast by Channel Nine on Saturday afternoons and co-hosted a sister show, &quot;Sports Sunday&quot;, for five years. Early in his stint on the former program, he swore without realising that he was live to air. A similar incident occurred during a live telecast of the 1993 Ashes series.

Chappell began working as a commentator for Channel Nine&#x27;s cricket coverage in the 1980–81 season, a position he retains until the network lost the Australian home cricket rights to Channel 7 in April 2018.

Chappell became a radio commentator for the Macquarie Sports Radio in 2018. He later moved to ABC Radio before retiring in August 2022.

===Leadership critiques===
====Greg Chappell====
The greatest controversy of his first season was the Underarm Incident, which involved his two younger brothers in an ODI played between Australia and New Zealand at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Chappell showed no fraternal bias and was vehement in his criticism of his brother Greg&#x27;s tactic. He wrote in a newspaper column on the matter: &quot;Fair dinkum, Greg, how much pride do you sacrifice to win $35,000?&quot;

====Kim Hughes====
He supported the claims of Rod Marsh to the Australian captaincy over the incumbent, Kim Hughes, in the early 1980s. The constant campaign against Hughes destabilised his authority. Compounding the situation, the ACB compelled Hughes to be interviewed by Chappell on a regular basis. He also criticised Hughes&#x27;s batting. &quot;Hughes needs to score the runs when they are needed most. He is not doing this and his inconsistency is rubbing off on others... there is a not a lot of thought in his batting&quot;.

On the morning of the second test against the West Indies in 1984–85, Chappell asked Hughes &quot;Three months ago, you claimed Australia possessed no Test-worthy legspinner. So what is Bob Holland doing in the team?&quot; Hughes resigned as captain after that match. Following Hughes&#x27; resignation, Australian cricket went into turmoil and Chappell received a share of the blame for the outcome.

====Allan Border &amp; Bob Simpson====
Chappell had a direct influence on Hughes&#x27; successor, Allan Border. Early in his captaincy tenure, Border was struggling with the burdens of the position so the ACB appointed Bob Simpson as team coach to assist. There was animosity between Chappell and Simpson prior to this and Chappell continue to deride the need for a coach. Simpson responded by writing that the peer influence of older players helping younger players fell away during the era when the Chappell brothers led the team, and he was redressing the problem.

Chappell believed that the Border-Simpson leadership was too defensive and that Simpson usurped too much of Border&#x27;s control of the team; Border heeded Chappell&#x27;s assessment and adopted a more aggressive on-field approach later in his career and became known as &quot;Captain Grumpy&quot; to his teammates. Mark Taylor, who captained the team after Border, moved to dilute Simpson&#x27;s authority. Chappell remains a long-standing critic of the use of coaches by national teams.

====Steve Waugh====
Ian Chappell was often critical of Steve Waugh as captain, believing him to be a selfish player and unimaginative captain. When Waugh was appointed captain in 1999 Chappell said:
I think he&#x27;s been a selfish cricketer . . . I&#x27;ve always felt that the things you do as a player leading up to getting the captaincy do have an effect [on] how players perceive you. I&#x27;ve had the feeling that a selfish player when he becomes captain . . . gets a little less out of his players than someone who is not selfish.
Chappell felt Shane Warne should have been picked as captain instead and his criticism of Waugh&#x27;s captaincy did not abate during Waugh&#x27;s stint in that role, despite his success. Waugh later wrote of Chappell:
Ian Chappell ... always sweated on my blunders and reported them with an &#x27;I told you so&#x27; mentality... To say Chappell&#x27;s criticism irked me would be an understatement, though I knew that, like anyone, he was entitled to an opinion. I don&#x27;t mind the fact he criticised me — in fact, I would much rather someone make a judgement than not, but I have always felt that a critic must be either constructive or base his comments on fact... It was something I had to live with, and when I realised he was never going to cut me much slack, I decided anything he said that was positive would be a bonus and the rest just cast aside.
Chappell rated Ricky Ponting a better captain than Waugh.

===Player critiques===
Chappell has been a vocal critic of a number of Australian players, most recently Ed Cowan and George Bailey.

===Books and writings===
Chappell&#x27;s first book was an account of the 1972 Ashes tour, &quot;Tigers Among the Lions&quot;, followed by a series of books of cricketing humour and anecdotes published in the early 1980s. The more analytical &quot;The Cutting Edge&quot;, an appraisal of modern cricket, appeared in 1992. Ashley Mallett&#x27;s biography, &quot;Chappelli Speaks Out&quot; (published in the UK as &quot;Hitting Out – the Ian Chappell Story&quot;) was written in collaboration with Chappell and released in 2005. It caused controversy due to Chappell&#x27;s assessment of Steve Waugh, who he described as &quot;selfish&quot; and as a captain, &quot;ran out of ideas very quickly&quot;. In 2006, Chappell released an anthology of his cricket writings entitled &quot;A Golden Age&quot;. He is a regular contributor for ESPNcricinfo.

== Personal life ==
After leaving school, Chappell spent two years as a clerk in a sharebroker&#x27;s office, which he left to play league cricket in England. He then worked as a promotions representative for Nestlé and, later, the cigarette manufacturer WD &amp; HO Wills. After eight years with Wills, Chappell capitalised on his fame as Australian captain by forming his own company specialising in advertising, promotion and journalism, which has remained his profession. He is twice married, and has a daughter (Amanda) with his first wife Kay. Chappell now lives in Sydney with his second wife Barbara-Ann. In recent years, Chappell has been a high-profile activist for better treatment of asylum seekers by the Australian government, in particular its policy of mandatory detention. He supports Australia cutting ties with the United Kingdom and becoming a republic, being a founding member of the Australian Republic Movement.

In July 2019, Chappell announced that he had been undergoing radiotherapy for skin cancer.
