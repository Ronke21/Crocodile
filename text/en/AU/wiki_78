<text>Dendermonde (; , ) is a city in the Flemish province of East Flanders in Belgium. The municipality comprises the city of Dendermonde and the towns of Appels, Baasrode, Grembergen, Mespelare, Oudegem, Schoonaarde, and Sint-Gillis-bij-Dendermonde. Dendermonde is at the mouth of the river Dender, where it flows into the Scheldt. The town has a long-standing folkloric feud with Aalst, south along the same river, which dates from the Middle Ages.

The city is an administrative, commercial, educational, and medical centre for the surrounding region. The current mayor of Dendermonde is Leen Dierick (Christian Democratic and Flemish).

==History==

===Origins to the 15th century===
The region of the Scheldt was inhabited in prehistory, as proven by some La Tène artifacts found in Appels. Grave sites from the 2nd and 6th century also attest to dense settlement in Gallo-Roman and Merovingian times. In 843, the Treaty of Verdun placed Dendermonde in Lotharingia. After the Norman invasions of 883, however, Baldwin II took over the region and incorporated it into the German part of the newly founded County of Flanders.

Otto II built a fort here in the 10th century, encouraging further settlements in the area. The town received its city charter in 1233 and grew quickly after that, thanks to a thriving cloth industry. Several cloisters, chapels and churches, and a fortified defensive wall were built as well. A cloth hall and belfry were erected on the market square in the mid 14th century. The town&#x27;s prosperity, however, gave rise to severe competition with cities such as Ghent and to occasional attacks and plunders by neighbours. In 1384, the whole area came under the control of the Valois dukes of Burgundy.

===16th to 20th century===
The 16th century saw a decline in Dendermonde&#x27;s fortunes. In 1572, the city was conquered by William the Silent. The same year, however, Spanish troops under Duke Alexander Farnese of Parma, took over the city, looted and mostly destroyed it. A decade later, the Spaniards built their own fortress between the Dender and the Scheldt. In 1667, it was France&#x27;s turn, under Louis XIV, to advance on the city, but they were turned back when the defenders opened the dikes and flooded the countryside. The allied troops of the Netherlands and England, under the Duke of Marlborough, caused the heaviest damage in 1706. The city was then fortified by the Austrians against further French ambitions. After a last siege by Louis XV, the city could finally breathe to the point that the fortifications were dismantled a few decades later.

The second half of the 18th century was generally prosperous, with the advent of the Industrial Revolution and a local cotton industry. After 1800, the port facilities were modernized and the first railways laid down, allowing other industries (e.g. oil, shoe, leather, etc.) to move in.

The onset of World War I in September 1914 was disastrous for the city as more than half of its housing and the city archives were either bombed or burned down.

===21st century===
On August 19, 2006, 28 prisoners managed to escape Dendermonde prison. Seven of them were captured within hours. A few were later found in Italy and Russia. They managed to escape because the lock was old and rusty. They simply walked away, tied all their sheets together, climbed over the wall, jumped on a phone booth and ran away.

On 23 January 2009, a 20-year-old Flemish man named Kim De Gelder attacked a children&#x27;s daycare centre in the village of Sint-Gillis-bij-Dendermonde, stabbing three people to death and wounding as many as twenty. One of the school teachers and two babies, aged 8 and 9 months, died in the attack.

The village lies to the east of Ghent, near a former course of the River the Scheldt and is notable for its castle. The castle dates from the twelfth and later centuries, notably, the seventeenth, and has been sympathetically restored and re-furnished.

The name arises from the Germanic &quot;hlaeri&quot; which signifies terrain seen as wooded and marshy. It is possible to speculate that the village originated in serving the castle, which in turn, guarded the river approach to Ghent from the sea. In the twelfth century, the river was less remote from the city than it is today. In 1040, Laarne was mentioned as &quot;Laren&quot;.

The lordship passed by inheritance through the families of Schoutheete, Van Vilsteren and others, finally to the counts of Ribaucourt. The castle is now owned by the &quot;Vereniging van Historische Woonsteden van België&quot; (the Union of Historic Homesteads of Belgium).

<doc id="154920" wikidata="Q17700" url="?curid=154920" title="Mink">
<text>Mink are dark-colored, semiaquatic, carnivorous mammals of the genera &quot;Neogale&quot; and &quot;Mustela&quot; and part of the family Mustelidae, which also includes weasels, otters, and ferrets. There are two extant species referred to as &quot;mink&quot;: the American mink and the European mink. The extinct sea mink was related to the American mink but was much larger.

The American mink&#x27;s fur has been highly prized for use in clothing. Their treatment on fur farms has been a focus of animal rights and animal welfare activism. American mink have established populations in Europe (including Great Britain and Denmark) and South America. Some people believe this happened after the animals were released from mink farms by animal rights activists, or otherwise escaped from captivity. In the UK, under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, it is illegal to release mink into the wild. In some countries, any live mink caught in traps must be humanely killed.

American mink are believed by some to have contributed to the decline of the less hardy European mink through competition (though not through hybridization—native European mink are in fact more closely related to polecats than to North American mink). Trapping is used to control or eliminate introduced American mink populations.

Mink oil is used in some medical products and cosmetics, as well as to treat, preserve, and waterproof leather.

==Species==
The American mink (&quot;Neogale vison&quot;) is larger and more adaptable than the European mink (&quot;Mustela lutreola&quot;) but, due to variations in size, an individual mink usually cannot be determined as European or American with certainty without looking at the skeleton. However, all European mink have a large white patch on their upper lip, whereas only some American mink have this marking. Therefore, any mink without the patch is certainly of the American species. Taxonomically, both American and European mink were placed in the same genus &quot;Mustela&quot; but the American mink was reclassified as belonging to its own genus, &quot;Neovison&quot;, though it has recently been reclassified alongside several other weasels into the genus &quot;Neogale&quot;.

The sea mink (&quot;Neogale macrodon&quot;), native to the New England area, is considered to be a close relative of the American mink. Its extinction in the late 19th century, was chiefly result of hunting for the fur trade.

==Description==
A wild male mink weighs about and is about in length. Farm-bred males can reach . The female weighs about and reaches a length of about . The sizes above do not include the tail, which can be from .

A mink&#x27;s rich glossy coat in its wild state is brown and looks silky. Farm-bred mink can vary from white to almost black, which is reflected in the British wild mink. Their pelage is deep, rich brown, with or without white spots on the underparts, and consists of a slick, dense underfur overlaid with dark, glossy, almost stiff guard hairs.

Mink show the curious phenomenon of delayed implantation. Although the true gestation period is 39 days, the embryo may stop developing for a variable period, so that as long as 76 days may elapse before the litter arrives. Between 45 and 52 days is normal. There is only one litter per year. They typically have between six and 10 kits per litter. Litters as large as 16 have been recorded at fur farms.

The maximum lifespan of a mink is usually around ten years, but rarely exceeds three years in the wild.

==Diet==
Mink prey on fish and other aquatic life, small mammals, birds, and eggs; adults may eat young mink. Mink raised on farms primarily eat expired cheese, eggs, fish, meat and poultry slaughterhouse byproducts, dog food, and turkey livers, as well as prepared commercial foods. A farm with 3,000 mink may use as much as two tons of food per day.

==Habitats==
Mink like to live near water and are seldom found far from riverbanks, lakes, and marshes. Even when roaming, they tend to follow streams and ditches. Sometimes they leave the water altogether for a few hundred meters, especially when looking for rabbits, one of their favourite foods. In some places, particularly in Scotland and in Iceland, they live along the seashore. Sometimes they live in towns if suitable water is available. Mink may be present at all hours, even when people are nearby.

==Territory==
Mink are territorial animals. A male mink will not tolerate another male within his territory but appears to be less aggressive towards females. Generally, the territories of both male and female animals are separate, but a female&#x27;s territory may sometimes overlap with that of a male.

The territories, which tend to be long and narrow, stretch along river banks, or around the edges of lakes or marshes. Territory sizes vary, but they can be several miles long. Female territories are smaller than those of males.

Each territory has one or two central areas (core areas) where the mink spends most of its time. The core area is usually associated with a good food supply, such as a pool rich in fish, or a good rabbit warren. The mink may stay in its core area, which can be quite small, for several days at a time, but it also makes excursions to the ends of its territory. These excursions seem to be associated with the defense of the territory against intruders. The mink likely checks for any signs of a stranger mink and leaves droppings (scat) redolent of its personal scent to reinforce its territorial rights.

==Human uses==
===Farming===
The American mink&#x27;s fur has been highly prized for use in clothing, with hunting giving way to farming. Their treatment on fur farms has been a focus of animal rights and animal welfare activism. American mink have established populations in Europe (including Great Britain) and South America, after being released from mink farms by animal rights activists, or otherwise escaping from captivity. In the UK, under the Wildlife &amp; Countryside Act 1981, it is illegal to release mink into the wild. In some countries, any live mink caught in traps must be humanely killed.

In February 2022, the US House of Representatives passed a ban on commercial mink farming following the global SARS-CoV-2 outbreak on mink farms, however it did not pass in the Senate so did not become law. The ban was attempted to be enacted in an effort to protect public health in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Mink farms pose the risk of producing SARS-CoV-2 variants that could be transmitted to humans. The cramped living conditions along with the high volume of immunosuppressed mink inhabiting the farms creates a highly hospitable environment for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. There have been approximately 6.1 million mink infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, with three variants traced back to farms in the U.S, France, and Denmark.

==== Ireland ====
There are three mink farms in Ireland, in Donegal, Kerry, and Laois. Mink farming was introduced into the country by two veterinarians. Three thousand mink were released by campaigners into the wild from a farm in the 1960s. It is estimated that there are 33,500 wild mink in Ireland.

The Irish Department of Agriculture stated in November 2020 saying that the Department of Health had advised, following the detection of coronavirus among animals on a Danish mink farm, that the roughly 120,000 farmed Irish mink should be culled. Mink farming was already due to be discontinued under the 2020 Programme for Government but the coronavirus risk had expedited the closure of the industry.

==== Denmark ====
===Health concerns===

Mink are among the animals that can be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and that are also known to spread infections among themselves and to humans. Transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus from mink to humans was first documented in the Netherlands by way of genetic tracing, which prompted the government to bring forward to the end of 2020 a ban on mink farming scheduled to come into effect in 2024. The United States Department of Agriculture confirmed that cases of minks infected with COVID-19 had been documented in Utah in August 2020.

In November 2020, Denmark, then the world&#x27;s largest producer of mink fur, slaughtered its entire mink population of 15 to 17 million animals to stop the spread of Cluster 5, a mutated strain of the virus, which has been linked to the animals and resulted in the infection of 12 humans with the mutated variant. The decision was later deemed to have been illegal, although the law was later changed in support of the action. Infections within mink were also deemed ancestral to a highly mutated SARS-CoV-2 strain found in Canadian white-tailed deer which subsequently spilled back into humans.

Similar to their role of a viral incubator in the COVID-19 pandemic, in October 2022, mink at a farm in Spain became the first observed case of mammal-to-mammal transmission of Influenza A virus subtype H5N1, an avian flu which had only previously jumped to mammals upon close contact or consumption or infected birds. The infected mink in Spain exhibited multiple new mutations when compared to viral sequences obtained from infected birds, one of which helps H5N1 to better replicate within mammals.

=== Stereotypy ===
On farms, minks are placed in battery cages, a type of soft, metal wire cage that restricts their ability to move. This often results in a condition referred to as stereotypies, an abnormal behavior. These abnormal, repetitive behaviours are a result of keeping them imprisoned, and is similar to the deterioration of mental health in humans. Stereotypies have also been noted to increase during human presence.

To attempt to eliminate stereotypies in captive mink, the Canadian National Farm Animal Care Council has implemented regulations on incorporating environmental enrichments into mink cages. Enrichments are pen-related alterations or the addition of novel objects to improve the mink&#x27;s physical and psychological health. Enrichments may help reduce the onset of stereotypies, but rarely decrease or eliminate them entirely. Leaving minks alone plays a large role in the prevention of stereotypies, and the animals&#x27; well-being.

<text>Assenede () is a municipality located in the Belgian province of East Flanders. The municipality comprises the towns of Assenede proper, , Boekhoute and Oosteeklo. On 1 January 2021, Assenede had a total population of 14,369. The total area is 87.22 km².

==History==
Assenede is one of the oldest villages in Flanders, the earliest mention of Assenede date back to as early as the 10th century.

==Geography ==
Assenede stands on two different types of soil, to the west most of the land is pure sand and called &quot;Houtland&quot; (woodland), and the side towards the northeast is mainly polder of the marsh type because Assenede and Boekhoute bordered the sea during the Middle Ages. The harbor in Assenede disappeared around 1500 but a small canal called the &quot;Vliet&quot; maintained some access to the Boekhouter &#x27;s harbor that existed much longer, and was present to around 1946. The last polder dyke was closed after that year. The creeks are nature reserves.

<text>Eeklo () is a Belgian municipality in the Flemish province of East Flanders. The municipality comprises only the city of Eeklo proper. The name &quot;Eeklo&quot; comes from the contraction of &quot;eke&quot; and &quot;lo&quot;, two Old German words meaning &#x27;oak&#x27; and &#x27;sparse woods&#x27; (compare English &quot;&quot;).

==History==

===Origins and Middle Ages===
There are not many traces of early habitation in the Eeklo area. It is presumed that some oaks would have attracted the attention of travellers on the Roman road that ran along the local sandbar among the marshes. By 1240, a town had grown here and had already become important enough to warrant a civic charter by Jeanne of Constantinople, Countess of Flanders. Over the years, the marshes were drained to give place to fortified farms, some remnants of which can still be seen today (&quot;Groot Goed&quot;). Like most other cities in the County of Flanders, Eeklo&#x27;s economy was based on the cloth industry, and commercial relations were established with the more powerful neighbouring cities, Ghent and Bruges.

===16th century - present===

During the second half of the 16th century, Eeklo was in the unfortunate position of being on the border between the Catholic south and the Protestant north, which resulted in so much destruction that the town was nearly abandoned by its inhabitants. At around that time the legend of &quot;recooking&quot; appeared, actually a rejuvenation recipe that involved drinking a youth elixir, cutting one&#x27;s head off and baking it again. While the head was in the oven, a green cabbage took its place on the body, symbol of the empty head.

The 18th and 19th century were more favourable and the textile industry took off again. Most of the town&#x27;s schools and neo-Gothic buildings date from that period. Today, Eeklo is changing its vocation from an industrial town to one of services to the neighbouring communities.

==Main sights==
*The town hall and belfry have been designated by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site in 1999.
*Eeklo has a few notable churches and chapels, such as the St Vincent Church (&quot;Sint-Vincentiuskerk&quot;) and the chapel of the clinic of the Holy Heart (&quot;Heilig Hartkliniek&quot;).
*A nearby provincial park, “Het Leen”, includes an arboretum and museum.
*A local park, the &quot;Heldenpark&quot;, offers concerts in summer, and houses a playground for children, bowling areas for seniors, and a soccer and baseball field.

<text>Kaprijke () is a municipality in the Belgian province of East Flanders. The municipality comprises the towns of Kaprijke proper and . In 2021, Kaprijke had a total population of 6,508.

==History==
The name Kaprijke comes from Gallo-Roman name &quot;Capricum&quot; which means &quot;Land of Caprius&quot;. It used to be the site of a Roman garrison, which can still be seen at the square in front of the old town hall. Kaprijke received city rights in 1240 by Joan, Countess of Flanders.

During the 14th and 15th century, the cloth industry flourished in Kaprijke. However, during the period of religious strife during the 16th century, the merchants and cloth makers withdrew to safer locations. Following the resolution of the problems, the merchants and weavers did not return, leading up to the decline of the city of Kaprijke into a rural village during the 17th and 18th centuries.

Kaprijke is known for its beautiful castle built in 1550, Hof ter Kruisen. It was commissioned by Andries of Baviere and finished in 1628.

In 1976, Kaprijke merged with another town called Lembeke, for a total population of around 6,200 people.

Lembeke is the home of Lotus Bakeries. The Bardelaere Museum is located in Lembeke.

<doc id="154938" wikidata="Q4354281" url="?curid=154938" title="Richard Murdoch">
<text>Richard Bernard Murdoch (6 April 1907 – 9 October 1990) was an English actor and entertainer.

After early professional experience in the chorus in musical comedy, Murdoch quickly moved on to increasingly prominent roles in musical comedy and revue in the West End and on tour. He made his first radio broadcast for the BBC in 1932 and in 1937 and 1938 he featured in early television broadcasts.

He came to national fame when cast with the comedian Arthur Askey in the radio show &quot;Band Waggon&quot; in 1938. Their contrasting styles appealed to the public and they took a version of the show on tour to theatres around the country and made a film adaptation of it. Serving in the Royal Air Force during the Second World War, Murdoch met a fellow officer, Kenneth Horne, and together they conceived, wrote and starred in the radio series &quot;Much-Binding-in-the-Marsh&quot;, which ran from 1944 to 1954. Murdoch&#x27;s last long-running radio programmes were &quot;The Men from the Ministry&quot; (1962–1977) in which he played a well-meaning but disaster-prone civil servant, and &quot;Many a Slip&quot;, a panel game that combined humour and erudition, in which he appeared from 1964 to 1973.

Murdoch appeared on air and on stage in Australia, Canada and South Africa, and continued acting and broadcasting into his eighties.

==Life and career==
===Early years===
Murdoch was born on 6 April 1907 at his family&#x27;s home in Keston, Kent, the only son of Bernard Murdoch, a tea merchant, and his wife, Amy Florence, daughter of the Ven Avison Scott, archdeacon of Tonbridge. He was educated at Charterhouse School in Surrey, and Pembroke College, Cambridge, which he left without taking a degree. His biographer Barry Took comments that Murdoch&#x27;s appetite for a career in show business was &quot;whetted by success with the Cambridge Footlights&quot;.

Murdoch made his professional stage debut in March 1927 at the Kings Theatre, Southsea, in the chorus of &quot;The Blue Train&quot;, a musical comedy starring Lily Elsie and directed by Jack Hulbert. He remained in the show when it opened in the West End in May of that year. He graduated from the chorus to a supporting role in a tour of &quot;Oh! Letty&quot;, a &quot;musical farce&quot; in which he was praised by Neville Cardus for &quot;a stretch of distinguished dancing&quot;. In 1932 he married Peggy, daughter of William Rawlings, solicitor. They had one son and two daughters. During the 1930s he gained increasingly prominent roles in musicals and revues, including the secondary romantic lead to Jack Buchanan&#x27;s star, in &quot;Stand up and Sing&quot; (1932), and the lead in a 1936 tour of &quot;Gay Divorce&quot; in the part played in New York and London by Fred Astaire.

The BBC transmitted a live radio relay of &quot;Stand up and Sing&quot; in April 1932, and Murdoch was in another such relay in 1934 in an entertainment called &quot;Bubbles&quot;. His first studio work for the corporation was in 1936 in a radio show called &quot;Tunes of the Town&quot;, and during 1937 and early 1938 he took part in five broadcasts by the fledgling BBC Television service, including an adaptation of Noël Coward&#x27;s one-act comedy with music, &quot;Red Peppers&quot; in which he played the Coward role.

===&quot;Band Waggon&quot; and &quot;Much-Binding-in-the-Marsh&quot;===

In 1938 the BBC teamed Murdoch with Arthur Askey in the radio series &quot;Band Waggon&quot;, where they were soon billed as &quot;Richard (&#x27;Stinker&#x27;) Murdoch and &quot;&#x27;Big-hearted&#x27; Arthur Askey&quot;. The smooth West End style of Murdoch contrasted with the down-to-earth humour of Askey, whose background was in seaside concert parties. Their main slot in the weekly show took up only about ten minutes, but caught the public imagination. They were depicted as occupying a flat on top of Broadcasting House. Took comments that their humour was a forerunner of much radio comedy to come:
Towards the end of 1938, after two series on the BBC, &quot;Band Waggon&quot; became a stage show. The impresario Jack Hylton presented the two stars and a supporting cast in a show that toured the provincial music-halls and finished with a run at the London Palladium in 1939. &quot;The Observer&quot; commented that they worked so well together because &quot;they find the same things funny. Each has a special line of humour that sets the other going&quot;. The stars featured in a film adaptation in 1940.

Murdoch was conscripted into the Royal Air Force in 1941, serving as a pilot officer in the intelligence section of Bomber Command, before being posted to the Department of Allied Air Force and Foreign Liaison as a flight lieutenant. In 1943 he joined the Directorate of Administrative Plans at the Air Ministry, where he shared an office with wing commander Kenneth Horne, being responsible for the supply of aircraft and air equipment to Russia. He finished the war with the rank of Squadron Leader. Horne and Murdoch quickly became friends and as both were regular broadcasters they invented a fictitious RAF station Much-Binding-in-the-Marsh for a programme of the same name. It went on air in January 1944, and when peace came in 1945 it became a civilian airport and the show continued successfully; the last programme was in March 1954.

===Later years===

Murdoch&#x27;s later career is described by Took as &quot;varied and interesting&quot;. In 1954 the Australian Broadcasting Corporation presented a series of variety programmes called &quot;Much Murdoch&quot;, in which, during the run, he worked again with Horne, who took advantage of a three-week holiday to join him. Murdoch worked again with Askey in 1958 in the television series &quot;Living It Up&quot;, running a pirate TV station from the roof of Television House. His next major broadcasting success was the BBC radio series &quot;The Men from the Ministry&quot; (1962–1977). His character, Richard Lamb, was a well-meaning but not conspicuously bright civil servant, who, together with his equally disaster-prone superior, Roland Hamilton-Jones (Wilfrid Hyde-White) and later Deryck Lennox-Brown (Deryck Guyler), continually found the wrong answers to the pressing problems of government. Murdoch&#x27;s last long running radio show was &quot;Many a Slip&quot;, a panel game that combined humour and erudition, in which he appeared from 1964 to 1973.

Murdoch appeared in two seasons at the Shaw Festival and on tour in North America, playing Aubrey in &quot;Tons of Money&quot; (1968) and William the waiter in &quot;You Never Can Tell&quot; (1973); he toured South Africa in a comedy called &quot;Not in the Book&quot; (1974), and toured Britain as Sir William Boothroyd, the role created by Ralph Richardson, in William Douglas-Home&#x27;s &quot;Lloyd George Knew My Father&quot;. From 1978 to 1990, Murdoch had a long-running regular role as &quot;Uncle Tom&quot;, the briefless senior barrister of chambers, in &quot;Rumpole of the Bailey&quot;. In 1981 he played the headmaster in Alan Bennett&#x27;s &quot;Forty Years On&quot;. In 1989 he played Lord Caversham in Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;An Ideal Husband&quot; on tour and at the Westminster Theatre; &quot;The Times&quot; commented that he managed to make &quot;Caversham&#x27;s ghastly mixture of the sanctimonious, the roguish and the bluff&quot; seem human.

== Personal life ==
In 1932, Murdoch married Peggy, the daughter of solicitor William Rawlings. The couple had a son and two daughters.

Murdoch, a keen golfer, died while playing golf at Walton Heath, Surrey, on 9 October 1990, aged 83. He was survived by his wife and children.

<text>Alfred Victor, Comte de Vigny (; 27 March 1797 – 17 September 1863) was a French poet and early French Romanticist. He also produced novels, plays, and translations of Shakespeare.

==Biography==
Vigny was born in Loches (a town to which he never returned) to an aristocratic family. His father was a 60-year-old veteran of the Seven Years&#x27; War who died before Vigny&#x27;s 20th birthday; his mother, 20 years younger, was a strong-willed woman who was inspired by Rousseau and took personal responsibility for Vigny&#x27;s early education. His maternal grandfather, the Marquis de Baraudin, had served as commodore with the royal navy.

Vigny grew up in Paris, and attended preparatory studies for the École Polytechnique at the Lycée Bonaparte, obtaining a good knowledge of French history and the Bible before developing an &quot;inordinate love for the glory of bearing arms&quot;.

As was the case for every noble family, the French Revolution diminished the family&#x27;s circumstances considerably. After Napoléon&#x27;s defeat at Waterloo, a Bourbon, Louis XVIII, the brother of Louis XVI, was restored to authority, and in 1814 Vigny enrolled in one of the privileged aristocratic companies of the &quot;Maison du Roi&quot; (king&#x27;s guard) as a second lieutenant.

Though he was promoted to first lieutenant in 1822 and to captain the next year, the military profession in time of peace bored him. After taking several leaves of absence he abandoned military life during 1827, having already published his first poem &quot;Le Bal&quot; during 1820 and an ambitious narrative poem &quot;Éloa&quot; in 1824 on the popular romantic theme of the redemption of Satan.

Prolonging successive leaves from the army, he settled in Paris with his young English bride Lydia Bunbury, whom he married in Pau in 1825. He collected his recent works in January 1826 in &quot;Poèmes antiques et modernes&quot;. Three months later he published the first important historical novel in French, &quot;Cinq-Mars&quot;, based on the life of Louis XIII&#x27;s favorite Henri Coiffier de Ruzé, Marquis of Cinq-Mars, who conspired against the Cardinal de Richelieu. With the success of these two volumes, Vigny seemed to be becoming a major Romantic celebrity, though one of Vigny&#x27;s friends, Victor Hugo, soon became much more famous. Vigny wrote of Hugo: &quot;The Victor I loved is no more... now he likes to make saucy remarks and is turning into a liberal, which does not suit him.&quot; Unlike Hugo and Alphonse de Lamartine, who became gradually liberal and then radical during the 1830s, Vigny remained pliantly centrist in his politics: he accepted the July Monarchy, at first welcomed and then rejected the Second French Republic, and then endorsed Napoleon III. Vigny later denounced people he knew well whom he suspected of republican sympathies to the imperial police.

The visit of an English theater troupe to Paris in 1827 revived French interest in Shakespeare. Vigny worked with Emile Deschamps on a translation of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. During 1831 he presented his first original play, &quot;La Maréchale d&#x27;Ancre&quot;, a historical drama recounting events just prior to the reign of King Louis XIII. Attending the theater, he met the actress Marie Dorval, who became his paramour until 1838. (Vigny&#x27;s wife had become a near invalid and never learned to speak French fluently; they did not have any children, and Vigny was also disappointed when his father-in-law&#x27;s remarriage deprived the couple of an anticipated inheritance.)

During 1835 Vigny produced a drama titled &quot;Chatterton&quot;, based on the life of Thomas Chatterton, an English poet who committed suicide while young, with Marie Dorval acting as Kitty Bell. &quot;Chatterton&quot; is considered to be one of the best of the French romantic dramas and is still performed regularly. The story of Chatterton had inspired one of the three episodes of Vigny&#x27;s philosophical novel &quot;Stello&quot; (1832), in which he examined the relationship of poetry to society and concluded that the poet, doomed to be regarded with suspicion by people of every social order, must remain somewhat aloof from the social order. &quot;Servitude et grandeur militaires&quot; (1835) was a similar tripartite meditation on the condition of a soldier. It is discussed by characters in the novel, &quot;The Valley of Bones,&quot; by Anthony Powell.
Although Vigny gained success as a writer, his personal life was often unhappy. His marriage was a disappointment; his relationship with Marie Dorval was plagued by jealousy; and eventually even his literary fame was diminished by the achievements of others. After the death of his mother in 1838 he inherited the property of Maine-Giraud, near Angoulême, where it was said that he had withdrawn to his &#x27;ivory tower&#x27; (an expression Sainte-Beuve coined with reference to Vigny). There Vigny wrote some of his most famous poems, including &quot;La Mort du loup&quot; and &quot;La Maison du berger&quot;. Proust regarded &quot;La Maison du berger&quot; as the greatest French poem of the 19th century. In 1845, after several unsuccessful attempts to be elected, Vigny became a member of the Académie française.

During later years, Vigny ceased to publish. He continued to write, however, and his &quot;Journal&quot; is considered by modern scholars to be a great work in its own right, though it awaits a definitive scholarly edition. Vigny considered himself a philosopher as well as a literary author; he was, for example, one of the first French writers to take a serious interest in Buddhism. His own philosophy of life was pessimistic and stoical, but valued human fraternity, the growth of knowledge, and mutual assistance. He was the first in literary history to use the word spleen in the sense of woe, grief, gall, descriptive of the condition of the soul of modern man. During his later years he spent much time preparing the posthumous collection of poems known now as &quot;Les Destinées&quot;, for which his intended title was &quot;Poèmes philosophiques&quot;. It concludes with Vigny&#x27;s final message to humanity, &quot;L&#x27;Esprit pur&quot;.

Vigny developed what is believed to have been stomach cancer during his early sixties. He endured its torments with exemplary stoicism for several years: &#x27;When we see what we were on Earth and what we leave behind/Only silence is great; everything else is weakness.&#x27; () Vigny died in Paris on 17 September 1863, a few months after the death of his wife. He was buried beside her in the Cimetière de Montmartre in Paris. Several of his works were published posthumously.
In 1876, the composer Ruggero Leoncavallo wrote an opera CHATTERTON based upon Vigny&#x27;s play and novel.

Eid al-Fitr is celebrated by Muslims worldwide because it marks the end of the month-long dawn-to-dusk fasting of Ramadan. Eid al-Fitr falls on the first day of Shawwal in the Islamic calendar; this does not always fall on the same Gregorian day, as the start of any lunar Hijri month varies based on when the new moon is sighted by local religious authorities. The holiday is known under various other names in different languages and countries around the world. The day is also known as the &quot;First Eid&quot; or as the &quot;Lesser Eid&quot; () by some Muslim communities.

It may only be performed in congregation () and features six additional (raising of the hands to the ears whilst reciting the Takbir, saying &quot;Allāhu ʾAkbar&quot;, meaning &quot;God is the greatest&quot;). In the Hanafi school of Sunni Islam, there are three at the start of the first and three just before in the second . Other Sunni schools usually have 12 , similarly split in groups of seven and five. In Shia Islam, the has six in the first at the end of , before , and five in the second. Depending on the juristic opinion of the locality, this is either (, obligatory) or (strongly recommended).

== History ==
According to Muslim tradition, Muhammad instituted the celebration of Eid al-Fitr. According to certain ahadith, these festivals were initiated in Medina after the migration of Muhammad from Mecca. Anas ibn Malik, a companion of Muhammad, narrated that when Muhammad arrived in Medina, he found people celebrating two specific days in which they entertained themselves with recreation. Muhammad then remarked that God had fixed two mandatory days of festivity: Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha. 
== General rituals ==

Eid al-Fitr begins at sunset on the night of the first sighting of the crescent moon. The night on which the moon is sighted is celebrated as &quot;Chand Raat&quot; in countries like Bangladesh. If the moon is not observed immediately after the 29th day of the previous lunar month (either because clouds block its view or because the western sky is still too bright when the moon sets), then the holiday is celebrated the following day. Eid al-Fitr is celebrated for one to three days, depending on the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;aljazeera/June&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It is forbidden to fast on the Day of Eid, and a specific prayer is nominated for this day.

Next, the takbir al-ihram is performed, by saying takbir three times, raising hands to the ears and dropping them each time, except for the last when the hands are folded. The Imam then reads al-Fatihah, followed by another surah. The congregation performs ruku and sujud. This completes the first .

The congregation rises and folds their hands for the second rak&#x27;ah, after which the imam recites al-Fatiha followed by another surah. After this, three takbirs are called out just before the ruku, each time raising hands to the ears and dropping them. For the fourth time, the congregation says Allahu Akbar and subsequently goes into the ruku. The rest of the prayer is completed regularly. This completes the Eid prayer. After the prayer, there is a khutbah.

====Malaysia and Singapore====

In Malaysia, Singapore, and Brunei, Eid is more commonly known as &quot;Hari Raya Aidilfitri&quot; (Jawi: هاري راي عيدالفطري), &quot;Hari Raya Idul Fitri&quot;, &quot;Hari Raya Puasa&quot;, &quot;Hari Raya Fitrah&quot; or &quot;Hari Lebaran&quot;. &quot;Hari Raya&quot; means &#x27;Great Day&#x27;.

It is customary for workers in the city to return to their home town to celebrate with their families and to ask forgiveness from parents, in-laws, and other elders. Forgiveness is often requested without citing any specific error to avoid arguments. This is known in Malaysia as &quot;balik kampung&quot; (homecoming).

The night before Hari Raya is filled with the sounds of takbir in the mosques or musallahs. In many parts of Malaysia, especially in the rural areas, &quot;pelita&quot; or &quot;panjut&quot; or &quot;lampu colok&quot; (as known by Malay-Singaporeans) (oil lamps, similar to tiki torches) are lit up and placed outside and around homes, while tiki torches themselves are also a popular decoration for that holiday. Special dishes like ketupat, rendang, lemang (a type of glutinous rice cooked in bamboo) and Malay delicacies such as various &quot;kuih-muih&quot; are served during this day. It is common to greet people with &quot;Salam Aidilfitri&quot; or &quot;Selamat Hari Raya&quot; which means &quot;Happy Eid&quot;. Muslims also greet one another with &quot;maaf zahir dan batin&quot;, which means &quot;Forgive my physical and emotional (wrongdoings)&quot;.

It is customary for Muslim-Malaysians to wear a traditional cultural clothing on Hari Raya. The Malay variant (worn in Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei and Southern Thailand) is known as the Baju Melayu, shirt worn with a &quot;sarong&quot; known as &quot;kain samping&quot; or songket and a headwear known as &quot;songkok&quot;. Malaysian women&#x27;s clothing is referred to as Baju Kurung and baju kebaya. It is a common practice however for the Malays in Singapore and Johor, Malaysia to refer to the &quot;baju kurung&quot; in reference to the type of outfit, worn by both men and women.
In Malaysia, especially in the major cities, people take turns to set aside a time for &quot;open house&quot; when they stay at home to receive and entertain neighbours, family and other visitors. It is common to see non-Muslims made welcome during Eid at these &quot;open houses&quot;. They also celebrate by lighting traditional bamboo cannon firecrackers known as &quot;meriam buluh&quot;, using kerosene in large hollow bamboo tubes or Chinese imported crackers. The traditional bamboo cannon, &quot;meriam buloh&quot;, and fireworks are notoriously loud and can be very dangerous to operator, bystander and even nearby buildings. These are usually bamboo tubes in diameter and long, filled with either: water and several hundred grams of calcium carbide, or heated kerosene, then ignited by match.

In Malaysia, children are given token sums of money, also known as &quot;duit raya&quot;, from their parents or elders.

====Brunei====
In Brunei, a special centrepiece is made to coming guests by young ladies of the family called the &quot;kepala meja&quot; (&#x27;head of the table&#x27;) where a decorated cake is presented so any man who wished to propose and take her in marriage would cut the cake in response. Here is also where special dishes unique to this country are served, such as kelupis with prawn or tahai (smoked sardinella) sambal and curry.

==== Myanmar ====
During Ramadan, in small towns and big villages with significant Muslim populations, Burmese Muslim youth organize singing teams called Jago (meaning &quot;wake up&quot;). Jago teams usually do not use musical instruments apart from the occasional use of harmonica mouth organs. The roving groups of singers will take the tunes of popular Hindi movie songs, replaced with Burmese lyrics and invocations about fasting, the principles of Islam, and the benefits of Salat.

==== Philippine ====
Among Muslim Filipinos in the Philippines, Eid al-Fitr is commonly known as &quot;Hariraya&quot;, &quot;Buka&quot;, &quot;Hariraya Buka&quot;, or &quot;Hariraya Buka Puasa&quot;. &quot;Eid al-&quot; is often replaced with &quot;Eid&#x27;l&quot; in the country&#x27;s local English variant. It is also known as &quot;Wakas ng Ramadan&quot; ( &quot;End of Ramadan&quot;), &quot;Araw ng Raya&quot; (&quot;Feast Day&quot;), or &quot;Pagtatapos ng Pag-aayuno&quot; (&quot;End of the Fast&quot;) in Filipino. It was proclaimed a legal holiday for Muslim Filipinos in 1977 by Presidential Decree No. 1083. In 2002, this was upgraded to a public national holiday by Republic Act No. 9177. It is also sometimes known by its Malay name &quot;Hari Raya Puasa&quot;; and by its Indonesian name &quot;Lebaran&quot;.
Its beginning is decided by the sighting of the crescent moon (&quot;hilal&quot;), followed by morning prayers in mosques or public plazas. When this occurs can sometimes differ depending on the regional government. In some places it is based on the physical sighting of the &quot;hilal&quot;; while in others it is determined by the Regional Darul Ifta&#x27; of Bangsamoro (RDI-BARMM) or the National Commission on Muslim Filipinos (NCMF), especially during cloudy days.

The sighting of the &quot;hilal&quot; is traditionally marked by the beating of drums in some regions. In modern times, this has evolved into a noise barrage known as &quot;Mobile Takbir&quot;, where celebrants, especially youths, rev their motorcycles or honk their horns while driving through the streets. Guns are also sometimes fired. These practices have been discouraged by the Grand Mufti of Bangsamoro and local government officials as not being in accordance with Islamic teachings as well as being dangerous and causing accidents in the past.

Hariraya is characterized by the giving of gifts (known as &quot;Eid&quot;), food sharing (&quot;salu-salo&quot;), and visiting the elderly and the sick. Food, alms, and basic necessities are also donated to the poor, a practice known as &quot;Fitrana&quot; or &quot;Zakat al-Fitr&quot;. This is usually done a day before Eid al-Fitr. Various traditional sweet delicacies of the different Muslim Filipino ethnic groups are served for breakfast, including daral, dodol, browas, tinagtag, panyalam, jampok, and so on. Various activities also mark the celebrations, including dancing, boat races, horse races, and carabao fighting in cities and towns with significant Muslim populations. In Metro Manila, the celebrations are usually held at the Manila Golden Mosque and the Quirino Grandstand. The celebration lasts for three days.

It is also a public holiday in China in certain regions, including two Province Prefecture Level regions, Ningxia and Xinjiang. All residents in these areas, regardless of religion, are entitled to either a one-day or three-day official holiday. Outside the Muslim-majority regions, only Muslims are entitled to a one-day holiday. In Xinjiang province, Eid al-Fitr is even celebrated by the Han Chinese population. During the holiday, supplies of mutton, lamb and beef are distributed to households as part of a welfare program funded by government agencies, public and private institutions, and businesses. In Yunnan, Muslim populations are spread throughout the region. On Eid al-Fitr, however, some devotees may travel to Sayyid &#x27;Ajjal&#x27;s grave after their communal prayers. There, they will conduct readings from the Quran and clean the tomb, reminiscent of the historic annual Chinese Qingming festival, in which people go to their ancestors&#x27; graves, sweep and clean the area, and make food offerings. Finally the accomplishments of the Sayyid &#x27;Ajall will be related in story form, concluded by a special prayer service to honour the hundreds of thousands of Muslims killed during the Panthay Rebellion, and the hundreds killed during the Shadian incident.

== In the Gregorian calendar ==
Although the date of Eid al-Fitr is always the same in the Islamic calendar, the date in the Gregorian calendar falls approximately 11 days earlier each successive year, since the Islamic calendar is lunar and the Gregorian calendar is solar. Hence if the Eid falls in the first ten days of a Gregorian calendar year, there will be a second Eid in the last ten days of the same Gregorian calendar year, as happened in 2000 CE. The Gregorian date may vary between countries depending on the local visibility of the new moon. Some expatriate Muslim communities follow the dates as determined for the nearest Islamic country to their country of residence, while others follow the local dates of their home country.

The following table shows predicted dates and announced dates based on new moon sightings for Saudi Arabia.

Because the Hijri year differs by about 11 days from the AD year, Eid al Fitr can occur twice a year. The next occurrence of this will be in 2033.

<text>Alfred Deakin (3 August 1856 – 7 October 1919) was an Australian politician who served as the second prime minister of Australia from 1903 to 1904, 1905 to 1908, and 1909 to 1910. He held office as the leader of the Protectionist Party, and in his final term as that of the Liberal Party. He is notable for being one of the founding fathers of Federation and for his influence in early Australian politics.

Deakin was born in Melbourne to middle-class parents. He was elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly in 1879, aged 23, additionally working as a barrister and journalist. He held ministerial office sporadically beginning in 1883, serving twice as Attorney-General of Victoria and aligning himself with liberal and radical reformers. In the 1890s, Deakin became one of the leading figures in the movement for the federation of the Australian colonies. He was a delegate to the federal conventions and served on the committees that drafted the federal constitution. He later campaigned at a series of referendums and lobbied the British government for its adoption.

After the Federation in 1901, Deakin became the inaugural Attorney-General of Australia in the ministry led by his close friend Edmund Barton. He succeeded Barton as prime minister in September 1903. Two subsequent elections in 1903 and 1906 produced an even split between three parties, with Deakin&#x27;s Liberal Protectionist Party occupying an effective middle ground between the Free Traders and the Australian Labour Party (ALP). He left office in April 1904 following an unproductive first term but returned in July 1905 and was able to form a functional government with the support of the ALP. He relinquished office again in August 1908.

In 1909, in what became known as the Fusion, Deakin controversially led his supporters into a union with the Free Traders. Their alliance, based on anti-socialism, marked the beginning of a two-party system in federal politics and allowed him to form Australia&#x27;s first majority government. Deakin regarded his final term as prime minister, from June 1909 to April 1910, as his most productive. However, to his surprise, the ALP won a majority in both houses at the 1910 election. He retired from politics in 1913, in the early stages of a degenerative neurological condition that led to his death at the age of 63.

Deakin is regarded as one of Australia&#x27;s most influential prime ministers. He was the principal architect of the &quot;Australian settlement&quot;, the features of which – the White Australia policy, compulsory arbitration, protectionism, state paternalism, and support for the British Empire – formed the basis of Australia&#x27;s socio-economic framework well into the 20th century.

==Early life==
===Birth and family background===
Deakin was born on 3 August 1856 in his parents&#x27; cottage at 90 George Street, Fitzroy, Melbourne, Victoria. He was of English and Welsh descent, the younger of two children born to Sarah (&quot;née&quot; Bill) and William Deakin. His father left school at the age of 14 and became a travelling salesman. He met his future wife while travelling through Abergavenny, and they married at Grosmont, Monmouthshire in 1849. Britain was experiencing an economic depression associated with the Panic of 1847, and they decided to migrate to Australia. The Deakins arrived in Adelaide, South Australia, in March 1850. Their first child Catherine (known as Kate) was born in July 1850, at which point her father was working as a storekeeper and clerk. The family moved to Melbourne as a result of the Victorian gold rush, which began the following year. William Deakin initially struggled to find steady employment, but later became involved with the carrying and coaching trade, transporting people and goods; he was listed as a at the time of his son&#x27;s birth in 1856. By the early 1870s, he was working with Cobb &amp; Co. as a manager, inspector, and accountant, earning a salary that allowed he and his family to maintain a comfortable middle-class lifestyle.

===Childhood and education===

Deakin spent his early years in Fitzroy, then lived briefly in Emerald Hill (now South Melbourne) before his family settled in South Yarra in about 1863. Rather than build an entirely new house, his father transported a wooden cottage from Fitzroy to South Yarra and then had it brick-nogged. His parents and sister would live there for the rest of their lives. At the age of four, Deakin was sent to join his ten-year-old sister in Kyneton, a small country town where she was attending a girls&#x27; boarding school run by the Thompson sisters. He was the only male pupil at the school. It was unusual for children to be sent away at such a young age, and his biographer Judith Brett has speculated that their mother may have been suffering from a bout of depression or recovering from a stillbirth. The Thompson sisters eventually moved their school to Melbourne, which Deakin continued to attend until the age of seven. In early 1864, he was enrolled at Melbourne Grammar School as a day-boy. He attended Melbourne Grammar for eight years, where he was a good student without excelling academically. He later recalled that he had been &quot;an incessantly restless, random and at times studiously mischievous pupil&quot;, and regretted that he had not been made to work harder. Deakin was also passionate about Australian rules football a game which he played during his youth, though it is not known for which clubs or teams he played in.

In 1871, aged 15, Deakin passed the matriculation exam for the University of Melbourne. He formed an ambition to become a barrister, and began attending evening classes the following year. He could not afford to study full-time, working during the day as a schoolteacher and private tutor. At the time, the Victorian Bar did not require a complete university degree for admission, only passing grades in relevant legal subjects. Deakin was consequently admitted to the bar in September 1877, aged 21, without ever graduating from university. According to his biographer John La Nauze, his legal studies were &quot;the least important part of his education&quot; during his time at university. He was a frequent speaker in the Melbourne University Debating Society, where he was mentored by Charles Henry Pearson, and was also involved in the Eclectic Society. He spent much of his spare time reading, &quot;from Chaucer to the great writers of his own time&quot;. For some time Deakin was &quot;more interested in dreams of being a dramatist, a poet or a philosopher&quot; rather than a lawyer. He wrote numerous works of blank verse and narrative poetry, and in 1875 published &quot;Quentin Massys&quot;, a drama in five acts.

Deakin initially had difficulty in obtaining briefs as a barrister. In May 1878, he met David Syme, the owner of the Melbourne daily &quot;The Age&quot;, who paid him to contribute reviews, leaders and articles on politics and literature. In 1880, he became editor of &quot;The Leader&quot;, &quot;The Age&quot;″s weekly. During this period Syme converted him from supporting free trade to protectionism. He became active in the Australian Natives&#x27; Association and began to practise vegetarianism. He became a lifelong spiritualist, holding the office of President of the Victorian Spiritualists&#x27; Union.

==Early political career==

Deakin stood for the largely rural seat of West Bourke in the Victorian Legislative Assembly in February 1879, as a supporter of Victorian Legislative Council reform, protection to encourage manufacturing and the introduction of a land tax to break up the big agricultural estates, and won by 79 votes. Due to a number of voters being disenfranchised by a shortage of voting papers, he used his maiden speech to announce his resignation; he lost the subsequent by-election by 15 votes, narrowly lost the seat in the February 1880 general election, but won it in yet another early general election in July 1880. The radical premier, Graham Berry, offered him the position of Attorney-General of Victoria in August, but Deakin turned him down.

During the 1880s, Deaking became involved in a number of organisations relating to public affairs, including the National Anti-Sweating League.

In 1882, Deakin married Elizabeth Martha Anne (&quot;Pattie&quot;) Browne, daughter of a well-known spiritualist. They lived with Deakin&#x27;s parents until 1887, when they moved to &quot;Llanarth&quot;, in Walsh Street, South Yarra. They had three daughters, Ivy (b. 1883), Stella (b. 1886), and Vera (b. 1891).

Deakin became Commissioner for Public Works and Water Supply in 1883, and the following year became Solicitor-General and Minister of Public Works. In 1885 Deakin secured the passage of the colony&#x27;s pioneering Factories and Shops Act, enforcing regulation of employment conditions and hours of work. In December 1884 he went to the United States to investigate irrigation, and presented a report in June 1885, &quot;Irrigation in Western America&quot;. Percival Serle described this report as &quot;a remarkable piece of accurate observation, and was immediately reprinted by the United States government&quot;. In June 1886, he introduced legislation to nationalise water rights and provide state aid for irrigation works that helped establish irrigation in Australia.

In 1885, Deakin became Chief Secretary and Commissioner for Water Supply and from 1890 Minister for Health and, briefly, Solicitor-General. In 1887 he led Victoria&#x27;s delegation to the Imperial Conference in London, where he argued forcibly for reduced colonial payments for the defence provided by the British Navy and for improved consultation concerning the New Hebrides. In 1889, he became the member for the Melbourne seat of Essendon and Flemington.

The government was brought down in 1890, over its use of the militia to protect non-union labour during the maritime strike. In addition, Deakin lost his fortune and his father&#x27;s fortune in the property crash of 1893, and had to return to the bar to restore his finances. In 1892, he unsuccessfully defended the mass murderer Frederick Bailey Deeming and assisted the defence in the 1893–94 libel trial of David Syme.

===Road to Federation===

After 1890, Deakin refused all offers of cabinet posts and devoted his attention to the movement for federation. He was Victoria&#x27;s delegate to the Australasian Federal Conference, convened by Sir Henry Parkes in Melbourne in 1890, which agreed to hold an intercolonial convention to draft a federal constitution. He was a leading negotiator at the Federal Conventions of 1891, which produced a draft constitution that contained much of the Constitution of Australia, as finally enacted in 1900. Deakin was also a delegate to the second Australasian Federal Convention, which opened in Adelaide in March 1897 and concluded in Melbourne in January 1898. He was somewhat out of sympathy with the tendency of the convention, and sided with the majority in only 55 percent of divisions; fewer occasions than all but five delegates. He supported wide taxation powers for the federal government, successfully opposed conservative plans for the indirect election of senators, and attempted to weaken the powers of the Senate, in particular seeking to prevent it from being able to defeat money bills. He had told the National Australasian Convention of 1891 &#x27;To introduce an American Senate into a British constitution is to destroy both&#x27;. Deakin often had to reconcile differences and find ways out of apparently impossible difficulties. Between and after these meetings, he travelled through the country addressing public meetings and he was partly responsible for the large majority in Victoria at each referendum.

In 1900 Deakin travelled to London with Edmund Barton and Charles Kingston to oversee the passage of the federation bill through the Imperial Parliament, and took part in the negotiations with Joseph Chamberlain, the Colonial Secretary, who insisted on the right of appeal from the High Court of Australia to the Privy Council. Eventually a compromise was reached, under which constitutional (&quot;inter se&quot;) matters could be finalised in the High Court, but other matters could be appealed to the Privy Council.

Deakin defined himself as an &quot;independent Australian Briton&quot;, favouring a self-governing Australia but loyal to the British Empire. He certainly did not see federation as marking Australia&#x27;s independence from Britain. On the contrary, Deakin was a supporter of closer empire unity, serving as president of the Victorian branch of the Imperial Federation League, a cause he believed to be a stepping stone to a more spiritual world unity.

=== Attorney-General ===
In 1901 Deakin was elected to the first federal Parliament as MP for the Division of Ballaarat, and became Attorney-General of Australia in the ministry headed by Edmund Barton. He was active, especially in drafting bills for the Public Service, arbitration and the High Court. His second reading speech on the Immigration Restriction Bill to implement the White Australia policy was notable for its blatant racism, including arguing that it was necessary to exclude the Japanese because of their good qualities, which would place them at an advantage over European Australians. His March 1902 speech in favour of the bill establishing the High Court of Australia helped overcome significant opposition to its establishment.

Deakin attempted to resign from cabinet in April 1902, writing two letters of resignation to Barton. The primary cause was his opposition to the government&#x27;s proposed 50% pay rise for MPs, but his wife had also been in poor health. He wrote to Barton that &quot;my retirement will be a relief from a strain which has been severe at times&quot;, and hoped to still assist the government as a backbencher. Barton replied that his departure would &quot;break my heart&quot; and &quot;wreck the ministry&quot;. He agreed to drop the proposed pay rise and Deakin agreed to continue as a minister.

In May 1902, Barton left the country to attend the coronation of Edward VII and 1902 Colonial Conference. Deakin was Acting Prime Minister of Australia until Barton&#x27;s return in October 1902. During this time he dealt with the resignation of Governor-General Lord Hopetoun over a salary dispute and conflict with the South Australian government over the external affairs power, which was resolved in favour of the federal government. He also secured the passage of the &quot;Customs Tariff 1902&quot;, which the Senate had twice returned to the House with a series of proposed amendments. In view of the urgent need for government revenue, Deakin successfully convinced the House and his fellow ministers to accept the amendments, but in a way that avoided setting a new constitutional precedent over money bills.

Deakin continued his efforts to establish a federal judiciary when parliament resumed in May 1903. The government eventually passed a compromise bill, the &quot;Judiciary Act 1903&quot;, which established a High Court of three judges. Concessions were made on the number of judges (three rather than five) as well as their salary and pension entitlements. In July 1903, Deakin was tasked with securing the passage of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill which had been drafted by Charles Kingston. He made the second reading speech on the bill at short notice, following Kingston&#x27;s surprise resignation from cabinet. He argued the bill, which would introduce a compulsory arbitration scheme for industrial disputes, would &quot;bring both employer and employee before the bar of a tribunal which would mete out even-handed justice&quot;. However, in early September the government unexpectedly abandoned the bill. The ALP, with the &quot;mischievous support&quot; of the opposition, had passed an amendment extending its provisions to state railway workers, which Deakin regarded as unconstitutional. He received much of the criticism for the decision to withdraw the bill.

== Prime Minister, 1903–1904 ==

After the passage of the &quot;Judiciary Act&quot;, cabinet began to consider who would fill the newly created seats on the High Court. Encouraged by his colleagues, Barton decided to retire from politics and accept appointment to a puisne justiceship. Deakin was his presumed successor and faced no significant opposition from the government and its supporters. The only obstacle was his own willingness to take on the role, and he expressed doubts about his suitability for the position in diary entries and letters to friends. He seriously considered allowing William Lyne to take over the government, but Lyne proved unable or unwilling to do so. After cabinet confirmed Barton&#x27;s appointment to the High Court, Deakin was sworn in as prime minister on 24 September 1903 at Government House, Melbourne. He relinquished the attorney-generalship and took on Barton&#x27;s external affairs portfolio. The new ministry was unchanged apart from the additions of Austin Chapman and Thomas Playford to replace Barton and Richard O&#x27;Connor (another High Court appointee). Lyne was given second rank in cabinet.

===1903 election and the &quot;three elevens&quot;===
Parliament was dissolved a month after Deakin took office, with the 1903 Australian federal election called for mid-December. He was the first prime minister to call an early election, to catch his opponents off guard and take advantage of a large number of urban educated female voters who could cast a ballot for the first time.

Deakin outlined the government&#x27;s platform at a speech in Ballarat on 29 October 1903. He called on voters to unite behind &quot;fiscal peace and preferential trade for a White Australia&quot;. The &quot;fiscal peace&quot; to which he referred was an end to conflict over the recently enacted tariff, while &quot;preferential trade&quot; referred to the idea of Imperial Preference, which Deakin hoped would bring Australia closer to Britain and the rest of the Empire. Reid continued to campaign on unrestricted free trade, while the ALP focused on class issues, particularly the need for compulsory arbitration, and was rewarded with large gains in both houses. The final result in the House was an effective three-way tie between Deakin&#x27;s Liberal Protectionists, Reid&#x27;s Free Traders, and Chris Watson&#x27;s Labour Party.

Inspired by the ongoing Ashes series, in a January 1904 speech Deakin used an uncharacteristic sporting analogy to call for the establishment of majority government and a two-party system:

What kind of a game of cricket could you have, if you had three elevens in the field instead of two, and one sometimes played on one side, sometimes on the other, and sometimes for itself?

He went on to call it &quot;absolutely essential&quot; for the three parties to be reduced to two &quot;as soon as possible&quot;, although he stated that he was unsure which parties should merge. Deakin&#x27;s analogy passed into common usage to describe the unstable party system in the first decade after Federation. However, according to the analogy was imperfect, as realistically the Labour Party and Free Traders would never agree to an alliance; Deakin&#x27;s party was an obligatory partner in any coalition government.

===Defeat and resignation===
Deakin sought to form an &quot;understanding&quot; with the ALP during the parliamentary recess after the election, but made little progress. When parliament resumed in March 1904, he introduced a modified Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, but ignored Labour&#x27;s requests for its provisions to be extended to state public servants. He believed that the government did not have the constitutional authority to do so, whereas the ALP (and some radicals within his own party) thought the issue should be determined by the High Court. On 22 April, Andrew Fisher moved for the bill to be amended to cover state public servants. The amendment passed by 38 votes to 29, which Deakin treated as a motion of no confidence in his government. He tendered his resignation as prime minister on the same day and was formally succeeded by Watson on 27 April.

Deakin&#x27;s motivations for relinquishing office have been debated. He was under no obligation to resign, as the ALP had not intended for the amendment to be treated as a confidence motion. It has been suggested he thought forcing Watson into office unprepared would demonstrate the ALP&#x27;s weakness as a party of government. However, his diaries also suggest he was under considerable personal strain and could have been &quot;simply courting defeat to relieve himself of the burden of office&quot;.

==Out of office==

Deakin promised to extend &quot;the utmost fair play&quot; to the new Watson government, and allowed H. B. Higgins to join the government as attorney-general. The Liberal Protectionists were divided between radicals seeking an alliance with the ALP and anti-socialists seeking an alliance with the Free Traders; Reid continued as leader of the opposition. Despite the party&#x27;s lack of a majority, the ALP caucus did not immediately authorise Watson to seek an alliance, and Deakin instead negotiated a draft agreement with the Free Traders in which Reid would become prime minister. Deakin himself would remain party leader but retire to the backbenches, as he did not wish to be bound by cabinet solidarity. The Liberal Protectionists rejected the agreement, according to John Forrest out of reluctance to serve in a ministry Deakin did not lead.

Watson attempted to form an alliance with the Liberal Protectionists in June 1904, but was rebuffed. Deakin felt that the power of the Protectionists would be diminished by Labour&#x27;s party discipline. He elaborated on his decision-making in an August speech to the National Political League, a newly anti-socialist organisation in Ballarat. His speech did not attack the government on policy grounds but condemned the ALP&#x27;s principles of caucus solidarity and organisational control over the parliamentary party. He saw himself as a progressive liberal torn between conservative obstructivism on one hand and Labour&#x27;s materialist collectivism on the other. Two days later &quot;The Age&quot;, edited by his friend David Syme, published a scathing editorial calling his speech &quot;transcendental musings&quot; and stating he had &quot;lost himself in the clouds amongst politico-philosophical questions&quot; instead of offering substantive leadership. This led to a major falling-out between the two, with Deakin writing to Syme that he had &quot;been more deeply upset by this incident than by any during my political life&quot;.

The Watson government fell less than two weeks after Deakin&#x27;s speech in Ballarat, which may have been taken by Reid as a cue to challenge the status quo. While debating the revived Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, a majority of the Liberal Protectionists joined with the Free Traders in opposing a procedural motion on an amendment. Watson took the vote as a motion of no confidence and resigned. Many ALP members felt betrayed by Deakin, and Billy Hughes accused him of hypocrisy in speeches which he later told Atlee Hunt had been deliberately provocative. Deakin in response made personal attacks on Hughes, comparing him to an &quot;ill-bred urchin one saw dragged from a tart shop kicking, screeching and scratching&quot;. He eventually apologised in the House for his reaction. Deakin declined to join the Reid government, but lent his support and encouraged Protectionists (including his former treasurer George Turner) to accept ministerial posts; others within the party joined the crossbench. He and Reid agreed to a &quot;fiscal truce&quot; in which the issue of the tariff would not be raised until the next election.

Deakin maintained an &quot;enigmatic public silence&quot; on the Reid government&#x27;s actions, particularly during the long parliamentary recess from December 1904 to June 1905. During this time he seriously considered leaving politics. He had been engaged to write monthly anonymous articles for the &quot;National Review&quot;, in addition to his weekly articles for the &quot;Morning Post&quot;. However, his primary interest was in religion, particularly the role of the preacher. He met with Salvation Army founder William Booth on a number of occasions, even chairing one of Booth&#x27;s meetings at the Royal Exhibition Building. In his notebooks he drafted sermons and &quot;weighed the religious against the political life, the preacher against the legislator, and both against the ultimate purpose of existence&quot;. Late in 1904, Deakin purchased at Point Lonsdale. He named the property &quot;Ballara&quot; and moved a wooden house onto the land, which served as a holiday home for the rest of his life.

===&quot;Notice to quit&quot;===

Deakin&#x27;s supporters began to lobby him to seek a return to government in 1905. He was reinvigorated by a trip to Western Australia early in the year, where he was struck by the development of the Eastern Goldfields and received encouragement from John Forrest and Austin Chapman. Most importantly, Chris Watson wrote privately that he would have the &quot;active support&quot; of the Labour Party if he resumed office.

On 24 June 1905, the weekend before parliament resumed, Deakin delivered a two-hour speech to his constituents in Ballarat. He claimed the pragmatic middle ground for his party, criticising the policies of Labour and the Free Traders as vague and impractical, and further accused Reid of breaking their fiscal truce. The significance of his address was elevated two days later when &quot;The Age&quot; stated that &quot;Mr Deakin&#x27;s Ballarat speech, read in any light, is a notice to Mr Reid to quit&quot;. Although Deakin denied that this interpretation was correct, Reid took it to mean he had withdrawn his support and stated as such in parliament. Deakin then successfully moved an amendment to the address-in-reply, while denying it had been premeditated. By convention, this was treated as a motion of no confidence. Reid sought a dissolution and early election, but was refused by the Governor-General, Lord Northcote; Deakin was then commissioned to form a new government.

==Prime Minister, 1905–1908==
===Domestic policy===
Deakin resumed office in mid-1905, and retained it for three years. During this, the longest and most successful of his terms as prime minister, his government was responsible for much policy and legislation giving shape to the Commonwealth during its first decade, including bills to create an Australian currency. The Copyright Act was passed in 1905, the Commonwealth Bureau of Census and Statistics was established in 1906, Commonwealth Bureau of Meteorology was established in 1908 and the Quarantine Act was passed in 1908.

In 1906 Deakin&#x27;s government amended the Judiciary Act to increase the size of the High Court to five judges, as envisaged in the constitution, and appointed Isaac Isaacs and H. B. Higgins to fill the two additional seats. The first protective Federal tariff, the Australian Industries Protection Act was passed. This &quot;New Protection&quot; measure attempted to force companies to pay fair wages by setting conditions for tariff protection, although the Commonwealth had no powers over wages and prices.

The Papua Act of 1905 established an Australian administration for the former British New Guinea and Deakin appointed Hubert Murray as Lieutenant-Governor of Papua in 1908, who ruled it for a 32-year period as a benevolent paternalist. His government passed a bill for the transfer of control of the Northern Territory from South Australia to the Commonwealth, which became effective in 1911. As prime minister Deakin championed the &quot;Seat of Government Act 1904&quot;, that had ordained the establishment of the Commonwealth&#x27;s capital at Dalgety, and vigorously, if unsuccessfully, fought the move to relocate the capital to the Canberra area.

===Defence and external affairs===
In December 1907, he introduced the first bill to establish compulsory military service, which was also strongly supported by Labour&#x27;s Watson and Billy Hughes. He had long opposed the naval agreements to fund Royal Navy protection of Australia although Barton had agreed in 1902 that the Commonwealth would take over such funding from the colonies. In 1906 he announced that Australia would purchase destroyers, and in 1907 travelled to an Imperial Conference in London to discuss the issue, without success. In 1908 he invited Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s Great White Fleet to visit Australia, in a symbolic act of independence from Britain. The Surplus Revenue Act of 1908 provided £250,000 for naval expenditure, although these funds were first applied by the Andrew Fisher Labour government, creating the first independent navy in the British empire.

==Fusion==
In 1908, Deakin was again forced from office by Labour. He then formed a coalition, the &quot;Fusion&quot;, with Joseph Cook and the Anti-Socialist Party, and returned to power in May 1909 at the head of Australia&#x27;s first majority government. The Fusion was seen by many as a betrayal of Deakin&#x27;s liberal principles, and he was called a &quot;Judas&quot; by Sir William Lyne.

==Prime Minister, 1909–1910==
Deakin was sworn in as prime minister for a third time on 2 June 1909. The Third Deakin Ministry contained five first-time appointees, reflecting the need to balance the competing interests within the new party.

In a letter to his sister, Deakin described the legislative achievements of 1909 as &quot;the finest harvest of any session&quot;. Acts were passed authorising the creation of a separate Australian coinage, establishing compulsory military training for young men, defining the extent of the future Australian Capital Territory, and creating the office of the Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, Australia&#x27;s first official diplomatic posting. Bills were also introduced to create the Inter-State Commission and formalise federal control over the Northern Territory, but were not progressed and were passed by the succeeding ALP government.

Deakin and Forrest negotiated the Financial Agreement of 1909 with the state governments, which distributed surplus federal revenues to the states as per-capita grants and became the model for intergovernmental financial relations. This replaced the interim arrangements provided by Section 87 of the Constitution of Australia. Deakin subsequently sought to enshrine the agreement in the constitution, at the urging of state premiers. This step was seen as unnecessary by many, including within his own party, but a second proposed amendment allowing the federal government to take over state debts was less controversial. Two referendums were held simultaneously with the 1910 federal election, with the state debts amendment being accepted and the surplus revenues amendment being rejected. The Financial Agreement nonetheless remained in place until 1927, and was seen by Deakin as one of his most important accomplishments.

===Final defeat===

Deakin did not call an early election, allowing the parliament to run to its maximum permissible length. He expected a &quot;sweeping victory&quot;, anticipating that after being confirmed in office he could complete his legislative agenda, attend the 1911 Imperial Conference and then hand over to a successor. The April 1910 federal election was the first to present a straight choice between two alternative parties. To Deakin&#x27;s surprise, the ALP won a clear majority, gaining 16 seats in the House and sweeping the Senate. In what he called &quot;the Waterloo of the Liberal Party&quot;, many former Protectionists lost their seats, and Deakin himself won by fewer than 500 votes. While there were several factors in Labour&#x27;s victory, Deakin&#x27;s perceived hypocrisy in the creation of the Fusion was frequently brought up in the campaign and likely cost the Liberals the votes of many of his former supporters.

==Leader of the Opposition, 1910–1913==

After the 1910 election, Deakin had less influence than any previous opposition leader, with the ALP holding clear majorities in both houses. His diaries indicate that he would have preferred to resign and retire from politics, but he was asked to stay on in the absence of an obvious successor. He led the campaign against the Fisher government&#x27;s proposed constitutional amendments in 1911, which would have significantly expanded the powers of the federal government. He spent two months campaigning for the &quot;No&quot; vote, visiting every state except Western Australia which turned out to be the only state to vote &quot;Yes&quot;. The result was regarded as a triumph for the opposition.

By 1912, Deakin had &quot;lost all zest for public life and was trudging on until he could retire&quot;. He made his final speech to parliament on 18 December 1912 and publicly announced his intention to retire on 8 January 1913, after informing Joseph Cook a day earlier. His last action as leader of the Liberal Party was to oversee the election of his successor, held on 20 January. He supported Cook, who defeated John Forrest by a single vote. Deakin retired from parliament at the 1913 federal election held in May, which saw Cook and the Liberals form government with a bare one-seat majority in the House.

==Final years==

After the 1913 election, Cook offered Deakin the position of chairman of the Interstate Commission, but he declined. In 1914, following the outbreak of World War I, he did accept a request to chair a royal commission into food supply during the war. Deakin&#x27;s final public engagement was as leader of the Australian delegation to the 1915 Panama–Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco. He was offered the role initially by Cook and then by Andrew Fisher, who returned as prime minister in September 1914. The appointment was entirely ceremonial and had the support of both Fisher and his deputy Billy Hughes. However, Deakin&#x27;s involvement was subject to political interference from external affairs minister Hugh Mahon, and he decided on an early return to Australia.

===Illness and death===
The final years of Deakin&#x27;s political career coincided with the early stages of a degenerative neurological condition, with memory loss as the primary feature. In his personal diaries, he meticulously documented his loss of function and increasing anguish at his decline. Other health records suggest he also suffered from chronic hypertension. He had hoped that his symptoms were due to stress and leaving politics would aid his recovery, but instead found that &quot;when I stepped out of Parliament in some mysterious fashion all my memories commenced to die or disappear&quot;. Contemporary doctors were unable to give him a clear diagnosis, other than a 1913 opinion of &quot;hyperneurasthenia&quot;. Later writers have suggested vascular dementia, early-onset Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, neurosyphilis, and Vitamin B12 deficiency from vegetarianism as possible causes of his illness.

In October 1914, Deakin wrote that he had &quot;no continuity of memory or argument&quot; and relied upon &quot;impressions that fade or are forgotten in a few minutes and often in a few seconds&quot;. In November 1915, he wrote that he could remember what he had read for only a few hours and that &quot;no collapse could be ghastlier&quot;. The following month, he wrote that &quot;I have now become a mere juggler with myself [...] my helpless attempts to read the riddle of my mind and thought must be frankly abandoned&quot;. At her urging, Deakin and his wife left Australia in September 1916 to seek advice from specialists in England and the United States, and also to visit their daughter Vera in London. They returned to Australia in early 1917, after which he was generally confined to his home in South Yarra and only saw family members.
Deakin died at his home on 7 October 1919, aged 63. His official cause of death was given as meningoencephalitis. He was granted a state funeral at Queen&#x27;s Hall in Parliament House, Melbourne, after a period lying in state. He was interred next to his parents in the non-denominational section of St Kilda Cemetery, joined by his widow Pattie following her death in 1934.

==Journalism==
In his youth, Deakin published &quot;Quentin Massys&quot;, a drama in five acts. Deakin attempted to burn the prints. However some survived and the play was reprinted 1940, as an example of Australian verse.

Deakin continued to write prolifically throughout his career. He was a member of the Eclectic Association; fellow members included authors Theodore Fink, Arthur Topp, Arthur Patchett Martin and David Mickle. Deakin wrote anonymous political commentaries for the London &quot;Morning Post&quot; even while he was prime minister. His account of the federation movement appeared as &quot;The Federal Story&quot; in 1944 and is a vital primary source for this history. His account of his career in Victorian politics in the 1880s was published as &quot;The Crisis in Victorian Politics&quot; in 1957. His collected journalism was published as &quot;Federated Australia&quot; in 1968.

==Spirituality==

He was active in the Theosophical Society until 1896, when he resigned on joining the Australian Church led by Charles Strong.

Though Deakin always took pains to obscure the spiritual dimensions of his character from the public gaze, he felt a strong sense of providence and destiny working in his career. Like Dag Hammarskjöld much later, Deakin&#x27;s sincere longing for spiritual fulfilment led him to express a sense of unworthiness in his private diaries, which mingled with his literary aspirations as a poet.

His private prayer diaries, like those of Samuel Johnson, express a profound contemplative (though more ecumenical) Christian view of the importance of humility in seeking divine assistance with his career. &quot;A life, the life of Christ&quot;, Deakin wrote, &quot;that is the one thing needfulthe only revelation required is there... We have but to live it.&quot; In 1888, as an example relevant to his work for Federation, Deakin prayed: &quot;Oh God, grant me that judgment &amp; foresight which will enable me to serve my countryguide me and strengthen me, so that I may follow &amp; persuade others to follow the path which shall lead to the elevation of national life &amp; thought &amp; permanence of well-earned prosperitygive me light &amp; truth &amp; influence for the highest &amp; the highest only.&quot; As Walter Murdoch pointed out, &quot;[Deakin] believed himself to be inspired, and to have a divine message and mission.&quot;

Historian Manning Clark, whose &quot;History of Australia&quot; cites extensively from his studies of Deakin&#x27;s private diaries in the National Library of Australia, wrote: &quot;By reading the world&#x27;s scriptures and mystics a deep peace had settled far inside [Deakin]: now he felt a &#x27;serenity at the core of my heart.&#x27; He wanted to know whether participation in the world&#x27;s affairs would disturb that serenity... he was tormented by the thought that the emptiness of the man within corresponded with the emptiness of society at large where Mammon had found a new demesne to infest.&quot;

Deakin processed a deep spiritual conviction and read widely on the subject. His daughter Vera Deakin (Lady White) said in a 1960 ABC radio interview &quot;He had tremendously deep religious views, I&#x27;m sure of that. He read to us on Sundays from the Bible, from great preachers, and he was deeply, always deeply conscious of being, as he put it, a tool for providence to work through. Any powers he had he felt he owed to the divine one and it was not his doing.&quot;

==Legacy==
Deakin was almost universally liked, admired and respected by his contemporaries, who called him &quot;Affable Alfred&quot;. He made his only real enemies at the time of the Fusion, when not only Labor but also some liberals such as Sir William Lyne reviled him as a traitor. He is regarded as a founding father by the modern Liberal Party of Australia.

His life was dramatised in the 1951 play &quot;Tether a Dragon&quot; by Kylie Tennant.

The Alfred Deakin Prize for an Essay Advancing Public Debate a literary prize (now defunct), was created in his honour.

==Honours==
Deakin generally rejected honours during his lifetime. He was first offered a knighthood at the 1887 Colonial Conference, aged 30, but declined to accept. On three separate occasions – in 1900, 1907, and 1913 – he refused appointment to the Privy Council, which would have entitled him to be styled &quot;The Right Honourable&quot;. His refusal was &quot;singular, indeed unique, among Australian politicians of comparable prominence&quot;. Except for Chris Watson, who was never offered the appointment, Deakin was the only Australian prime minister not to be a privy counsellor until Gough Whitlam refused appointment in the 1970s. He also refused to accept any honorary degrees as prime minister, believing they should only be awarded based on academic prowess. He rejected honorary Doctor of Civil Law degrees from the University of Oxford in 1900 and 1907, and an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the University of Cambridge in 1912. Deakin generally only accepted honours when he believed it would advance Australian interests, or if rejection could be taken as an insult. While visiting England as prime minister in 1907, he was made an honorary freeman of the cities of London and Edinburgh and an honorary bencher of Gray&#x27;s Inn. The one honorary degree he did accept was from the University of California in 1915, when he was representing Australia at the Panama–Pacific International Exposition.

Since Deakin&#x27;s death, several places have been named in his honour. Educational institutions that bear his name include Melbourne&#x27;s Deakin University, Canberra&#x27;s Alfred Deakin High School, Deakin House at Melbourne Grammar School, and Deakin Hall at Monash University. He is one of only two prime ministers to have a university named in his honour, along with John Curtin (Curtin University).

Other places named after Deakin include the suburb of Deakin in Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, and the Division of Deakin in the House of Representatives, located in Melbourne&#x27;s eastern suburbs. In 1969, Australia Post honoured him on a postage stamp bearing his portrait.

<text>William Morris Hughes (25 September 1862 – 28 October 1952) was an Australian politician who served as the seventh prime minister of Australia from 1915 to 1923. He led the nation during World War I, and his influence on national politics spanned several decades. He was a member of the federal parliament from the Federation of Australia in 1901 until his death in 1952, and is the only person to have served as a parliamentarian for more than 50 years. He represented six political parties during his career, leading five, outlasting four, and being expelled from three.

Hughes was born in London to Welsh parents. He emigrated to Australia at the age of 22, and became involved in the fledgling Australian labour movement. He was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in 1894, as a member of the New South Wales Labor Party, and then transferred to the new federal parliament in 1901. Hughes combined his early political career with part-time legal studies, and was called to the bar in 1903. He first entered cabinet in 1904, in the short-lived Watson government, and was later the Attorney-General of Australia in each of Andrew Fisher&#x27;s governments. He was elected deputy leader of the Australian Labor Party in 1914.

Hughes became prime minister in October 1915, when Fisher retired due to ill health. The war was the dominant issue of the time, and his support for sending conscripted troops overseas caused a split within Labor ranks. Hughes and his supporters were expelled from the party in November 1916, but he was able to remain in power at the head of the new National Labor Party, which after a few months merged with the Liberals to form the Nationalist Party. His government was re-elected with large majorities at the 1917 and 1919 elections. Hughes established the forerunners of the Australian Federal Police and the CSIRO during the war, and also created a number of new state-owned enterprises to aid the post-war economy. He made a significant impression on other world leaders at the 1919 Paris Peace Conference, where he secured Australian control of the former German New Guinea.

At the 1922 Australian federal election, the Nationalists lost their majority in parliament and were forced to form a coalition with the Country Party. Hughes&#x27;s resignation was the price for Country Party support, and he was succeeded as prime minister by Stanley Bruce. He became one of Bruce&#x27;s leading critics over time, and in 1928, following a dispute over industrial relations, he and his supporters crossed the floor on a confidence motion and brought down the government. After a period as an independent, Hughes formed his own organisation, the Australian Party, which in 1931 merged into the new United Australia Party (UAP). He returned to cabinet in 1934, and became known for his prescient warnings against Japanese imperialism. As late as 1939, he missed out on a second stint as prime minister by only a handful of votes, losing the 1939 United Australia Party leadership election to Robert Menzies.

Hughes is generally acknowledged as one of the most influential Australian politicians of the 20th century. He was a controversial figure throughout his lifetime, and his legacy continues to be debated by historians. His strong views and abrasive manner meant he frequently made political enemies, often from within his own parties. Hughes&#x27;s opponents accused him of engaging in authoritarianism and populism, as well as inflaming sectarianism; his use of the &quot;War Precautions Act 1914&quot; was particularly controversial. His former colleagues in the Labor Party considered him a traitor, while conservatives were suspicious of what they viewed as his socialist economic policies. He was extremely popular among the general public, particularly ex-servicemen, who affectionately nicknamed him &quot;the little digger&quot;.

==Early years==
===Birth and family background===

Hughes was born on 25 September 1862, at 7 Moreton Place, Pimlico, London, the son of William Hughes and the former Jane Morris. His parents were both Welsh. His father, who worked as a carpenter and joiner at the Palace of Westminster, was from North Wales and was a fluent Welsh speaker. His mother, a domestic servant, was from the small village of Llansantffraid-ym-Mechain (near the English border), and spoke only English. Hughes was an only child; at the time of their marriage, in June 1861, his parents were both 37 years old.

===Wales===
Hughes&#x27;s mother died in May 1869, when he was six years old. His father subsequently sent him to be raised by relatives in Wales. During the school term, he lived with his father&#x27;s sister, Mary Hughes, who kept a boarding house in Llandudno named &quot;Bryn Rosa&quot;. He earned pocket money by doing chores for his aunt&#x27;s tenants and singing in the choir at the local church. Hughes began his formal education in Llandudno, attending two small single-teacher schools. He spent his holidays with his mother&#x27;s family in Llansantffraid. There, he divided his time between &quot;Winllan&quot;, the farm of his widowed aunt (Margaret Mason), and &quot;Plas Bedw&quot;, the neighbouring farm of his grandparents (Peter and Jane Morris).

Hughes regarded his early years in Wales as the happiest time of his life. He was immensely proud of his Welsh identity, and he later became active in the Welsh Australian community, frequently speaking at Saint David&#x27;s Day celebrations. Hughes called Welsh the &quot;language of heaven&quot;, but his own grasp of it was patchy. Like many of his contemporaries, he had no formal schooling in Welsh, and had particular difficulties with spelling. Nonetheless, he received and replied to correspondence from Welsh-speakers throughout his political career, and as prime minister famously traded insults in Welsh with David Lloyd George.

===London===
At the age of eleven, Hughes was enrolled in St Stephen&#x27;s School, Westminster, one of the many church schools established by the philanthropist Angela Burdett-Coutts, 1st Baroness Burdett-Coutts. He won prizes in geometry and French, receiving the latter from Lord Harrowby. After finishing his elementary schooling, he was apprenticed as a &quot;pupil-teacher&quot; for five years, instructing younger students for five hours a day in exchange for personal lessons from the headmaster and a small stipend. At St Stephen&#x27;s, Hughes came into contact with the poet Matthew Arnold, who was an examiner and inspector for the local school district. Arnold – who coincidentally had holidayed at Llandudno – took a liking to Hughes, and gifted him a copy of the Complete Works of Shakespeare; Hughes credited Arnold with instilling his lifelong love of literature.

After finishing his initial apprenticeship, Hughes stayed on at St Stephen&#x27;s as a teaching assistant. He had no interest in teaching as a career though, and also declined Matthew Arnold&#x27;s offer to secure him a clerkship at Coutts. His relative financial security allowed him to pursue his own interests for the first time, which included bellringing, boating on the Thames, and travel (such as a two-day trip to Paris). He also joined a volunteer battalion of the Royal Fusiliers, which consisted mainly of artisans and white-collar workers. In later life, Hughes recalled London as &quot;a place of romance, mystery and suggestion&quot;.

==First years in Australia==
===Queensland===
At the age of 22, finding his prospects in London dim, Hughes decided to emigrate to Australia. Taking advantage of an assisted-passage scheme offered by the Colony of Queensland, he arrived in Brisbane on 8 December 1884 after a two-month journey. On arrival, he gave his year of birth as 1864, a deception that was not uncovered until after his death. Hughes attempted to find work with the Education Department, but was either not offered a position or found the terms of employment to be unsuitable. He spent the next two years as an itinerant labourer, working various odd jobs. In his memoirs, Hughes claimed to have worked variously as a fruitpicker, tally clerk, navvy, blacksmith&#x27;s striker, station hand, drover, and saddler&#x27;s assistant, and to have travelled (mostly on foot) as far north as Rockhampton, as far west as Adavale, and as far south as Orange, New South Wales. He also claimed to have served briefly in both the Queensland Defence Force and the Queensland Maritime Defence Force. Hughes&#x27;s accounts are by their nature unverifiable, and his biographers have cast doubt on their veracity – Fitzhardinge states that they were embellished at best and at worst &quot;a world of pure fantasy&quot;.

===New South Wales===

Hughes moved to Sydney in about mid-1886, working his way there as a deckhand and galley cook aboard SS &quot;Maranoa&quot;. He found occasional work as a line cook, but at one point supposedly had to resort to living in a cave on The Domain for a few days. Hughes eventually found a steady job at a forge, making hinges for colonial ovens. Around the same time, he entered into a common-law marriage with Elizabeth Cutts, his landlady&#x27;s daughter; they had six children together. In 1890, Hughes moved to Balmain. The following year, with his wife&#x27;s financial assistance, he was able to open a small shop selling general merchandise. The income from the shop was not enough to live on, so he also worked part-time as a locksmith and umbrella salesman, and his wife as a washerwoman. One of Hughes&#x27;s acquaintances in Balmain was William Wilks, another future MP, while one of the customers at his shop was Frederick Jordan, a future Chief Justice of New South Wales.

==Early political career==

In Balmain, Hughes became a Georgist, a street-corner speaker, president of the Balmain Single Tax League, and joined the Australian Socialist League. He was an organiser with the Australian Workers&#x27; Union and may have already joined the newly formed Labor Party. In 1894, Hughes spent eight months in central New South Wales organising for the Amalgamated Shearers&#x27; Union of Australasia and then won the Electoral district of Sydney-Lang of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly by 105 votes.

While in Parliament he became secretary of the Wharf Labourer&#x27;s Union. In 1900 he founded and became first national president of the Waterside Workers&#x27; Union. During this period Hughes studied law, and was admitted as a barrister in 1903. Unlike most Labor men, he was a strong supporter of Federation and Georgism.

In 1901 Hughes was elected to the first federal Parliament as Labor MP for the Division of West Sydney. He opposed the Barton government&#x27;s proposals for a small professional army and instead advocated compulsory universal training. In 1903, he was admitted to the bar after several years part-time study. He became a King&#x27;s Counsel (KC) in 1909. 
In 1911, he married Mary Campbell. He was Minister for External Affairs in Chris Watson&#x27;s first Labor government. He was Attorney-General in Andrew Fisher&#x27;s three Labor governments in 1908–09, 1910–13 and 1914–15.

In 1913, at the foundation ceremony of Canberra as the capital of Australia, Hughes gave a speech proclaiming that the country was obtained via the elimination of the indigenous population. &quot;We were destined to have our own way from the beginning..[and]..killed everybody else to get it,&quot; Hughes said, adding that &quot;the first historic event in the history of the Commonwealth we are engaged in today [is] without the slightest trace of that race we have banished from the face of the earth.&quot; But he warned that &quot;we must not be too proud lest we should, too, in time disappear.&quot;

His abrasive manner (his chronic dyspepsia was thought to contribute to his volatile temperament) made his colleagues reluctant to have him as Leader. His on-going feud with King O&#x27;Malley, a fellow Labor minister, was a prominent example of his combative style.
Hughes was also the club patron for the Glebe Rugby League team in the debut year of Rugby League in Australia, in 1908. Hughes was one of a number of prominent Labor politicians who were aligned with the Rugby League movement in Sydney in 1908. Rugby League was borne out of a player movement against the Metropolitan Rugby Union who refused to compensate players for downtime from their jobs due to injuries sustained playing Rugby Union. Labor politicians aligned themselves with the new code as it was seen as a strong social standpoint, politically, and it was an enthusiastic professional game, which made the politicians themselves appear in a similar vein, in their opinions anyway.

==Prime minister==

Following the 1914 Australian federal election, the Labor Prime Minister of Australia, Andrew Fisher, found the strain of leadership during World War I taxing and faced increasing pressure from the ambitious Hughes who wanted Australia to be firmly recognised on the world stage. By 1915 Fisher&#x27;s health was suffering and, in October, he resigned and was succeeded by Hughes. In social policy, Hughes introduced an institutional pension for pensioners in benevolent asylums, equal to the difference between the &#x27;act of grace&#x27; payment to the institution and the rate of IP.

From March to June 1916, Hughes was in Britain, where he delivered a series of speeches calling for imperial co-operation and economic warfare against Germany. These were published under the title &quot;The Day—and After&quot;, which was a bestseller. His biographer, Laurie Fitzhardinge, said these speeches were &quot;electrifying&quot; and that Hughes &quot;swept his hearers off their feet&quot;. According to two contemporary writers, Hughes&#x27;s speeches &quot;have in particular evoked intense approbation, and have been followed by such a quickening power of the national spirit as perhaps no other orator since Chatham ever aroused&quot;.

In July 1916 Hughes was a member of the British delegation at the Paris Economic Conference, which met to decide what economic measures to take against Germany. This was the first time an Australian representative had attended an international conference.

Hughes was a strong supporter of Australia&#x27;s participation in World War I and, after the loss of 28,000 men as casualties (killed, wounded and missing) in July and August 1916, Generals Birdwood and White of the First Australian Imperial Force (AIF) persuaded Hughes that conscription was necessary if Australia was to sustain its contribution to the war effort.

However, a two-thirds majority of his party, which included Roman Catholics and trade union representatives as well as the Industrialists (Socialists) such as Frank Anstey, were bitterly opposed to this, especially in the wake of what was regarded by many Irish Australians (most of whom were Roman Catholics) as Britain&#x27;s excessive response to the Easter Rising of 1916.

In October, Hughes held a national plebiscite for conscription, but it was narrowly defeated. The enabling legislation was the &quot;Military Service Referendum Act 1916&quot; and the outcome was advisory only. The narrow defeat (1,087,557 Yes and 1,160,033 No), however, did not deter Hughes, who continued to argue vigorously in favour of conscription. This revealed the deep and bitter split within the Australian community that had existed since before Federation, as well as within the members of his own party. 

Conscription had been in place since the 1910 Defence Act, but only in the defence of the nation. Hughes was seeking via a referendum to change the wording in the act to include &quot;overseas&quot;. A referendum was not necessary but Hughes felt that in light of the seriousness of the situation, a vote of &quot;Yes&quot; from the people would give him a mandate to bypass the Senate. The Lloyd George Government of Britain did favour Hughes but only came to power in 1916, several months after the first referendum. The predecessor Asquith government greatly disliked Hughes considering him to be &quot;a guest, rather than the representative of Australia&quot;. According to David Lloyd George: &quot;He and Asquith did not get on too well. They would not. They were antipathetic types. As Hughes was never over-anxious to conceal his feelings or restrain his expression of them, and was moreover equipped with a biting tongue, the consultations between them were not agreeable to either&quot;.

In reaction to Hughes&#x27;s campaign for conscription, on 15 September 1916 the NSW executive of the Political Labour League (the state Labor Party organisation at the time) expelled him and other leading New South Wales pro-conscription advocates from the Labor movement. Hughes remained as leader of the federal parliamentary Labor Party until, at 14 November caucus meeting, a no-confidence motion against him was passed. Hughes and 24 others, including almost all of the Parliamentary talent, walked out to form a new party heeding Hughes&#x27;s cry &quot;Let those who think like me, follow me.&quot; This left behind the 43 members of the Industrialists and Unionists factions. That same evening Hughes tendered his resignation to the Governor-General, received a commission to form a new Government, and had his recommendations accepted. Years later, Hughes said, &quot;I did not leave the Labor Party, The party left me.&quot; The timing of Hughes&#x27;s expulsion from the Labor Party meant that he became the first Labor leader who never led the party to an election. On 15 November, Frank Tudor was elected unopposed as the new leader of the Federal Parliamentary Australian Labor Party.

=== Nationalist Party ===
Hughes and his followers, which included many of Labor&#x27;s early leaders, called themselves the National Labor Party and began laying the groundwork for forming a party that they felt would be both avowedly nationalist as well as socially radical. Hughes was forced to conclude a confidence and supply agreement with the opposition Commonwealth Liberal Party to stay in office.

A few months later, the Governor-General, Ronald Munro Ferguson, 1st Viscount Novar, persuaded Hughes and Liberal Party leader Joseph Cook (himself a former Labor man) to turn their wartime coalition into a formal party. This was the Nationalist Party of Australia, which was formally launched in February. Although the Liberals were the larger partner in the merger, Hughes emerged as the new party&#x27;s leader, with Cook as his deputy. The presence of several working-class figures—including Hughes—in what was basically an upper- and middle-class party allowed the Nationalists to convey an image of national unity. At the same time, he became and remains a traitor in Labor histories.

At the 1917 Australian federal election Hughes and the Nationalists won a huge electoral victory, which was magnified by the large number of Labor MPs who followed him out of the party. At this election Hughes gave up his working-class Sydney seat and was elected for the Division of Bendigo, after he won the seat by defeating the sitting Labor MP Alfred Hampson, and both marks the only time that a sitting prime minister had challenged and ousted another sitting MP for his seat along with him becoming the first of only a handful of Members of the Australian Parliament who have represented more than one state or territory.

Hughes had promised to resign if his Government did not win the power to conscript. Queensland Premier T. J. Ryan was a key opponent to conscription, and violence almost broke out when Hughes ordered a raid on the Government Printing Office in Brisbane, with the aim of confiscating copies of Hansard that covered debates in the Queensland Parliament where anti-conscription sentiments had been aired. A second plebiscite on conscription was held in December 1917, but was again defeated, this time by a wider margin. Hughes, after receiving a vote of confidence in his leadership by his party, resigned as prime minister. However, there were no credible alternative candidates. For this reason, Munro-Ferguson used his reserve power to immediately re-commission Hughes, thus allowing him to remain as prime minister while keeping his promise to resign.

===Domestic policy===
====Electoral reform====

The government replaced the first-past-the-post electoral system applying to both houses of the Federal Parliament under the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1903 with a preferential system for the House of Representatives in 1918. That preferential system has essentially applied ever since. A multiple majority-preferential system was introduced at the 1919 Australian federal election for the Senate, and that remained in force until it was changed to a quota-preferential system of proportional representation in 1948. Those changes were considered to be a response to the emergence of the Country Party, so that the non-Labor vote would not be split, as it would have been under the previous first-past-the-post system.

====Science and industry====
=====Research body=====
In early 1916, Hughes established the Advisory Council on Science and Industry, the first national body for scientific research and the first iteration of what is now the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). The council had no basis in legislation, and was intended only as a temporary body to be replaced with &quot;Bureau of Science and Industry&quot; as soon as possible. However, due to wartime stresses and other considerations the council endured until 1920, at which point an act of parliament was passed transforming it into a new government agency, the Institute of Science and Industry. According to Fitzhardinge: &quot;The whole affair was highly typical of Hughes&#x27;s methods. An idea coming from outside happened to chime with his preoccupation of the moment. He seized it, put his own stamp on it, and pushed it through to the point of realization. Then, having established the machinery, he expected it to run itself while he turned his full energies elsewhere, and tended to be evasive or testy if he was called back to it. Yet his interest was genuine, and without his enthusiasm and drive the Commonwealth intervention would either not have come at all or would have been far slower&quot;.

=====Aviation=====

It was a scheme of Hughes&#x27; devising that set the scene for long-distance civil aviation in Australia. His interest in the possibilities of peacetime aviation was sparked by his flights travelling between London and Paris for the Paris Peace Conference. On a Christmas visit the year before, in 1918, to wounded servicemen convalescing in Kent, Hughes had met Australian pilots who were facing the seven-week sea voyage home and were eager to pioneer an air route and fly to Australia instead. Such a vast distance had never been attempted by air; the first ocean crossing by aircraft occurred only months later in June 1919. Despite the risks of such a venture, Hughes&#x27; eagerness to see Australia at the forefront of technological development and in a central position in world affairs, had him seeking the support of his cabinet for a scheme to establish a Britain–Australia route. A February 1919 cable from Hughes said: &quot;Several Australian aviators are desirous of attempting flight London to Australia they are all first-class men and very keen your thoughts&quot;, and also advised the cabinet of the advantages that such a groundbreaking flight would offer Australia: &quot;would be a great advertisement for Australia and would concentrate the eyes of the world on us.&quot;

A month later, the acting prime minister of Australia, William Watt, announced: &quot;With a view to stimulating aerial activity, the Commonwealth Government has decided to offer £10,000 for the first successful flight to Australia from Great Britain.&quot; The reward would go to the first crew to complete the journey in under thirty days. Brothers Ross and Keith Smith, pilot and navigator, and mechanics Walter Shiers and Jim Bennett won the prize when their Vickers Vimy G-EAOU twin engine plane landed in Darwin on 10 December 1919. The flight set a record for distance travelled by aircraft, having flown , surpassing the previous record of set the year before on a Cairo to Delhi flight. Hughes achieved his aim of garnering world press attention for Australia, while Australia&#x27;s first, and one of the world&#x27;s earliest airlines, Qantas, was founded in 1920, commencing international passenger flights in 1935. A cofounder of the airline, Hudson Fysh, who had been commissioned by the government to survey landing fields in northern Australia for the competition, was present to greet the crew of the Vimy when it landed.

=== Paris Peace Conference ===

In 1919 Hughes, with former prime minister Joseph Cook, travelled to Paris to attend the Versailles Peace Conference. He remained away for 16 months, and signed the Treaty of Versailles on behalf of Australia – the first time Australia had signed an international treaty.

At a meeting of the Imperial War Cabinet on 30 December 1918, Hughes warned that if they &quot;were not very careful, we should find ourselves dragged quite unnecessarily behind the wheels of President Wilson&#x27;s chariot&quot;. He added that it was intolerable for Wilson &quot;to dictate to us how the world was to be governed. If the saving of civilisation had depended on the United States, it would have been in tears and chains to-day&quot;. He also said that Wilson had no practical scheme for a League of Nations and added: &quot;The League of Nations was to him what a toy was to a child—he would not be happy till he got it&quot;. At the Paris Peace Conference, Hughes clashed with Wilson. When Wilson reminded him that he spoke for only a few million people, Hughes replied: &quot;I speak for 60,000 dead. How many do you speak for?&quot;

The British Dominions of New Zealand, South Africa and Australia argued their case to keep their occupied German possessions of German Samoa, German South West Africa, and German New Guinea respectively; these territories were given as &quot;Class C Mandates&quot; to the respective Dominions. In a same-same deal Japan obtained control over its occupied German possessions north of the equator. At the meeting of 30 January, Hughes clashed with Wilson on the question of mandates, as Hughes preferred formal sovereignty over the islands. According to the British Prime Minister, David Lloyd George, Wilson was dictatorial and arrogant in his approach to Hughes, adding that &quot;Hughes was the last man I would have chosen to handle in that way&quot;. Lloyd George described how, after Hughes stated his case against subjecting the islands conquered by Australia to a mandate:

President Wilson pulled him up sharply and proceeded to address him personally in what I would describe as a heated allocution rather than an appeal. He dwelt on the seriousness of defying world opinion on this subject. Mr. Hughes, who listened intently, with his hand cupped around his ear so as not to miss a word, indicated at the end that he was still of the same opinion. Whereupon the President asked him slowly and solemnly: &quot;Mr. Hughes, am I to understand that if the whole civilised world asks Australia to agree to a mandate in respect of these islands, Australia is prepared still to defy the appeal of the whole civilised world?” Mr. Hughes answered: &quot;That&#x27;s about the size of it, President Wilson&quot;. Mr. Massey grunted his assent of this abrupt defiance.

However, South Africa&#x27;s Louis Botha intervened on Wilson&#x27;s side, and the mandates scheme went through. Hughes&#x27;s frequent clashes with Wilson led to Wilson labelling him a &quot;pestiferous varmint&quot;.

Hughes, unlike Wilson or South African Prime Minister Jan Smuts, demanded heavy reparations from the German Empire, suggesting the sum of £24,000,000,000 of which Australia would claim many millions to off-set its own war debt. Hughes was a member of the British delegation on the Reparations Committee, with Walter Cunliffe, 1st Baron Cunliffe and John Hamilton, 1st Viscount Sumner. When the Imperial Cabinet met to discuss the Hughes Report, Winston Churchill asked Hughes if he had considered the effects that reparations would have on working-class German households. Hughes replied that &quot;the Committee had been more concerned in considering the effects upon the working-class households in Great Britain, or in Australia, if the Germans did not pay an indemnity&quot;.

At the Treaty negotiations, Hughes was the most prominent opponent of the inclusion of Japan&#x27;s Racial Equality Proposal, which as a result of lobbying by him and others was not included in the final Treaty. His position on this issue reflected the racist attitudes dominant among white Australians; informing David Lloyd George that he would leave the conference if the clause was adopted, Hughes clarified his opposition by announcing at a meeting that &quot;ninety-five out of one hundred Australians rejected the very idea of equality.&quot; Hughes offered to accept the clause so long as it did not affect immigration policy but the Japanese turned the offer down. Lloyd George said that the clause &quot;was aimed at the restrictions and disabilities which were imposed by certain states against Japanese emigration and Japanese settlers already within their borders&quot;.

Hughes had entered politics as a trade unionist, and like most of the Australian working class was very strongly opposed to Asian immigration to Australia (excluding Asian immigration was a popular cause with unions in Canada, the U.S., Australia and New Zealand in the early 20th century). Hughes believed that accepting the Racial Equality Clause would mean the end of the White Australia policy that had been adopted in 1901, one of his subordinates writing: &quot;No Gov&#x27;t could live for a day in Australia if it tampered with a White Australia ...The position is this – either the Japanese proposal means something or it means nothing: if the former, out with it; if the latter, why have it?&quot;{ He later said that &quot;the right of the state to determine the conditions under which persons shall enter its territories cannot be impaired without reducing it to a vassal state&quot;, adding: &quot;When I offered to accept it provided that words were incorporated making it clear that it was not to be used for the purpose of immigration or of impairing our rights of self-government in any way, [the Japanese delegate] Baron Makino was unable to agree&quot;.

When the proposal failed, Hughes reported in the Australian parliament:The White Australia is yours. You may do with it what you please, but at any rate, the soldiers have achieved the victory and my colleagues and I have brought that great principle back to you from the conference, as safe as it was on the day when it was first adopted.

Japan was notably offended by Hughes&#x27;s position on the issue. Like Jan Smuts of South Africa, Hughes was concerned by the rise of Japan. Within months of the declaration of the European War in 1914, Japan, Australia and New Zealand had seized all German territorial possessions in the Pacific. Though Japan had occupied German possessions with the blessing of the British, Hughes felt alarm at this turn of events.

With reference to Hughes&#x27;s actions at the Peace Conference, the historian Ernest Scott said that although Hughes failed to secure sovereignty over the conquered German islands or relief for Australia&#x27;s war debts, &quot;both he and his countrymen found satisfaction with his achievements. By characteristic methods he had gained single-handed at least the points that were vital to his nation&#x27;s existence&quot;. Joan Beaumont said Hughes became &quot;something of a folk hero in later Australian historiography for his assertiveness at the Paris peace conference&quot;.

Seth Tillman described him as &quot;a noisesome demagogue&quot;, the &quot; of Anglo-American relations&quot;. Unlike Smuts, Hughes opposed the concept of the League of Nations, as in it he saw the flawed idealism of &quot;collective security&quot;. He declared in June 1919 that Australia would rely on the League &quot;but we shall keep our powder dry&quot;.

On returning home from the conference, he was greeted with a welcome &quot;unsurpassed in the history of Australia&quot; which historian Ann Moyal says was the highpoint of his career.

===1920–1923===
Hughes demanded that Australia have independent representation within the newly-formed League of Nations. Despite the rejection of his conscription policy, Hughes retained popularity with Australian voters and, at the 1919 Australian federal election, his government was comfortably re-elected.

After 1920, Hughes&#x27;s political position declined. Many of the more conservative elements of his own party never trusted him because they thought he was still a socialist at heart, citing his interest in retaining government ownership of the Commonwealth Shipping Line and the Australian Wireless Company. However, they continued to support him for some time after the war, if only to keep Labor out of power.

A new party, the Country Party (known since 1975 as the National Party of Australia, was formed, representing farmers who were discontented with the Nationalists&#x27; rural policies, in particular Hughes&#x27;s acceptance of a much higher level of tariff protection for Australian industries, that had expanded during the war, and his support for price controls on rural produce. In the New Year&#x27;s Day Honours of 1922, Hughes&#x27;s wife Mary was appointed a Dame Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (GBE).

At the 1921 Imperial Conference, Hughes argued unsuccessfully in favour of renewing the Anglo-Japanese Alliance.

At the 1922 Australian federal election, Hughes gave up the seat of Bendigo and transferred to the upper-middle-class Division of North Sydney, thus giving up one of the last symbolic links to his working-class roots. The Nationalists lost their outright majority at the election. The Country Party, despite its opposition to Hughes&#x27;s farm policy, was the Nationalists&#x27; only realistic coalition partner. However, party leader Earle Page let it be known that he and his party would not serve under Hughes. Under pressure from his party&#x27;s right wing, Hughes resigned in February 1923 and was succeeded by his Treasurer, Stanley Bruce. His eight-year tenure was the longest for a prime minister until Robert Menzies passed him in 1957.

Whilst the incumbent prime minister, Hughes switched seats at both the 1917 and 1922 elections, the only prime minister to have done so not once but twice. All other elections have seen the prime minister re-contest the seat that they held prior to the election.

==Political eclipse and re-emergence==
Hughes played little part in parliament for the remainder of 1923. He rented a house in Kirribilli, New South Wales in his new electorate and was recruited by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; to write a series of articles on topics of his choosing. In the articles he defended his legacy as prime minister and stated he would support the new government as long as it followed his principles. In 1924, Hughes embarked on a lecture tour of the United States. His health broke down midway through the tour, while he was in New York. As a result he cancelled the rest of his engagements and drove back across the country in a new Flint automobile, which he brought back to Australia. Later in the year he purchased a house in Lindfield, which was to be his primary residence for the rest of his life. In 1925 Hughes again had little involvement in parliamentary affairs, but began to portray himself as &quot;champion of Australian industries struggling to get established against foreign competition and government indifference&quot;, with the aid of his friends James Hume Cook and Ambrose Pratt.

Hughes was furious at being ousted by his own party and nursed his grievance on the back-benches until 1929, when he led a group of back-bench rebels who crossed the floor of the Parliament to bring down the Bruce government. Hughes was expelled from the Nationalist Party, and formed his own party, the Australian Party. After the Nationalists were heavily defeated in the ensuing election, Hughes initially supported the Labor government of James Scullin. He had a falling-out with Scullin over financial matters, however. In 1931 he buried the hatchet with his former non-Labor colleagues and joined the Nationalists and several right-wing Labor dissidents under Joseph Lyons in forming the United Australia Party (UAP), under Lyons&#x27; leadership. He voted with the rest of the UAP to bring the Scullin government down.

==1930s==

The UAP won a sweeping victory at the 1931 election. Lyons sent Hughes to represent Australia at the 1932 League of Nations Assembly in Geneva and in 1934 Hughes became Minister for Health and Repatriation in the Lyons government. Later Lyons appointed him Minister for External Affairs, but Hughes was forced to resign in 1935 after his book &quot;Australia and the War Today&quot; exposed a lack of preparation in Australia for what Hughes correctly supposed to be a coming war. Soon after, the Lyons government tripled the defence budget. Hughes also wrote in &quot;Australia and the War Today&quot; that the League of Nations was broken and that it could have worked only if it had been backed by force. He believed that every nation must look to its own defences and that, as Britain was preoccupied in European affairs, Australia would have to defend itself.

After the 1931 Japanese invasion of Manchuria, Hughes believed that the British should remain neutral, and adopted the same attitude towards Italy&#x27;s invasion of Abyssinia in 1935. Hughes believed that the British Empire was in danger because of its weakness in the Mediterranean.

Hughes was brought back to Australia by Lyons as Minister for External Affairs in 1937. In 1938 Germany requested the return of her Pacific colonies but Hughes declared that Australia should hold onto New Guinea, and in April 1939 he said that if Germany wanted colonies she would have to fight for them.

By the time of Lyons&#x27; death in 1939, Hughes was also serving as Attorney-General and Minister for Industry. He also was Minister for the Navy, Minister for Industry and Attorney-General at various times under Lyons&#x27; successor, Robert Menzies.

==World War II==
Defence issues became increasingly dominant in public affairs with the rise of Fascism in Europe and militant Japan in Asia. From 1938, Prime Minister Joseph Lyons had Hughes head a recruitment drive for the Defence Forces. On 7 April 1939, Lyons died in office. The United Australia Party selected Robert Menzies as his successor to lead a minority government on the eve of World War Two. Australia entered the Second World War on 3 September 1939 and a special War Cabinet was created after war was declared – initially composed of Prime Minister Menzies and five senior ministers including Hughes. Labor opposition leader John Curtin declined to join and Menzies lost his majority at the 1940 Election. With the Allies suffering a series of defeats and the threat of war growing in the Pacific, the Menzies government (1939-1941) relied on two independents, Arthur Coles and Alex Wilson for its parliamentary majority.

Unable to convince Curtin to join in a War Cabinet and facing growing pressure within his own party, Menzies resigned as prime minister on 29 August 1941. Although the UAP had been in government for a decade, it was so bereft of leadership that a joint UAP-Country meeting elected Country Party leader Arthur Fadden to lead the Coalition. Hughes remained in the Fadden government, serving as Attorney-General and Minister for the Navy. A month later, Coles and Wilson joined with the Labor opposition to defeat the budget and bring down the government. The independents, under prodding from Governor-General Alexander Hore-Ruthven, 1st Earl of Gowrie, then threw their support to Opposition Leader John Curtin, who was sworn in as prime minister on 7 October 1941. Going into opposition the UAP opted for a joint Coalition opposition led by Fadden, which led Menzies to resign the leadership. The 79-year-old Hughes was narrowly elected leader on 9 October but widely regarded as a stop-gap given his age.

On 7 December, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor. Soon afterwards, Hughes criticised the British government for their weakness in the Far East and declared that they were living on &quot;fast-fading gleams of British triumphs in other wars&quot;. However, in February 1942 he said that &quot;Britain has temporarily lost control of the seas but she has lost it in an effort to protect Australia. It would be well if those who criticise Britain would turn the searchlights on Australia&quot;. In August he criticised the defensive strategy of the Allies in the Pacific but after the Battle of the Solomons he praised the United States&#x27; armed forces. Hughes opposed the Curtin government&#x27;s Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942, which incorporated sections 2–6 of the Statute of Westminster 1931 into law. He believed that Britain and the Dominions should instead work together for a common foreign policy.

Hughes led the UAP into the 1943 Australian federal election largely by refusing to hold any party meetings and by agreeing to let Fadden lead the Opposition as a whole. The Coalition was severely defeated, winning only 19 seats. Hughes himself was nearly defeated in North Sydney on a swing of over 14 percent, seeing his majority dwindle from a comfortably safe 67 percent to a marginal 53 percent. After the election, Hughes yielded the leadership of the UAP back to Menzies.

==Final years==

In February 1944, the parliamentary UAP voted to withdraw its members from the Advisory War Council. Hughes and Menzies resigned, but Percy Spender chose to remain on the council and was expelled from the UAP. A few months later, Hughes rejoined the War Council at the personal invitation of John Curtin. He was expelled from the UAP on 14 April 1944, and replaced as deputy leader by Eric Harrison. Hughes and Spender sat as an independents until 13 September 1945, when they joined the new Liberal Party of Australia that had been founded earlier in the year. By that point the War Council had been abolished.

A major redistribution and expansion of the House of Representatives occurred prior to the 1949 election, with much of the northern portion of North Sydney transferred to the new Division of Bradfield. Hughes faced a preselection challenge for the first time since 1894, but defeated Harry Turner for Liberal Party endorsement and won a comfortable victory. He was elected to the House of Representatives for the 20th and final time at the 1951 Australian federal election, with 79 percent of the vote. Hughes&#x27;s last speech in parliament was an attack on the Menzies government&#x27;s decision to sell its share in Commonwealth Oil Refineries, one of the state-owned enterprises his government had established over 30 years earlier. According to H.V. Evatt, his speech &quot;seemed at once to grip the attention of all honourable members present ... nobody left the House, and nobody seemed to dare to move&quot;.

Hughes celebrated a number of milestones in his last years in parliament. In 1944, a celebratory dinner was held to commemorate the 50th anniversary of his election to the Parliament of New South Wales, and 50 consecutive years of service as an MP. Prime Minister John Curtin toasted him as someone who had &quot;fought like hell for what he believed to be right, and for that Australia will honour him&quot;. In June 1951, Hughes was the guest of honour at a banquet marking the golden jubilee of the federal parliament. The following year, &quot;almost every member of the House of Representatives and Senate&quot; attended his birthday dinner. Prime Minister Robert Menzies observed that Hughes had been a member of every political party at one time or another, at which point Arthur Fadden interjected that he had never joined the Country Party. Hughes then remarked &quot;had to draw the line somewhere, didn&#x27;t I?&quot;.

==Death and funeral==

Hughes died on 28 October 1952, aged 90, at his home in Lindfield. His state funeral was held at St Andrew&#x27;s Cathedral, Sydney, and was one of the largest Australia has seen: some 450,000 spectators lined the streets. He was later buried at Macquarie Park Cemetery and Crematorium with his daughter Helen; his widow Dame Mary joined them upon her death in 1958.

At the age of 90 years, one month and three days, Hughes is the oldest person ever to have been a member of the Australian parliament. His death sparked the 1952 Bradfield by-election. He had been a member of the House of Representatives for 51 years and seven months, beginning his service in the reign of Queen Victoria and ending it in the reign of Queen Elizabeth II. Including his service in the New South Wales colonial parliament before that, Hughes had spent a total of 58 years as an MP, and had never lost an election. His period of service remains a record in Australia. He was the last member of the original Australian Parliament elected in 1901 still serving in Parliament when he died. Hughes was the penultimate member of the First Parliament to die; King O&#x27;Malley outlived him by fourteen months. Hughes was also the last surviving member of the Watson Cabinet, as well as the first and third Cabinets of Andrew Fisher.

==Personal life==
===First marriage===

Soon after arriving in Sydney, Hughes entered into a common-law marriage with Elizabeth Cutts, the daughter of one of his landladies. Their relationship was never formally registered or solemnised, but they lived as husband and wife and had six children together – William (b. 1891; died in infancy), Ethel (b. 1892), Lily (b. 1893), Dolly (b. 1895), Ernest (b. 1897), and Charles (b. 1898). They also raised Arthur (b. 1885), Elizabeth&#x27;s son from a previous relationship, who took Hughes as his surname. Their marriage was solid, though sometimes strained by Hughes&#x27;s devotion to his work and frequent absences from home. Elizabeth had little interest in politics, and was sometimes ill at ease in the social situations that occurred as her husband&#x27;s career progressed. She died of heart failure on 1 September 1906, aged 42, after a long period of ill health.

===Second marriage===
After his first wife&#x27;s death, Hughes&#x27;s oldest daughter Ethel kept house for him and helped look after the younger children. After a brief courtship, he remarried on 26 June 1911 to Mary Ethel Campbell, the daughter of a well-to-do pastoralist. At the time of their marriage, he was 48 and she was 37. Mary was politically and socially astute, and her husband often turned to her for advice on political matters. Unusually for the time, he insisted that he be accompanied by her on all of his overseas trips, even those made during wartime. Through his second marriage, Hughes also became the brother-in-law of John Haynes, one of the founders of &quot;The Bulletin&quot;. His niece, Edith Haynes, lived with him and his wife as a companion for many years.

The only child from Hughes&#x27;s second marriage was Helen Myfanwy Hughes, who was born in 1915 (a few months before he became prime minister). He doted upon her, calling her the &quot;joy and light of my life&quot;, and was devastated by her death in childbirth in 1937, aged 21. Her son survived and was adopted by a friend of the family, with his grandfather contributing towards his upkeep. Because she was unmarried at the time, the circumstances of Helen&#x27;s death were kept hidden and did not become generally known until 2004, when the ABC screened a programme presented by the actor Martin Vaughan. Vaughan had played Billy Hughes in the 1975 film &quot;Billy and Percy&quot;, and his continuing interest in him led to the unearthing of Helen&#x27;s fate.

===Health===

Hughes had a severe hearing loss that began when he was relatively young and worsened with age. He relied on a primitive electronic hearing aid, which was so bulky that it could only be worn for short periods and had to be carried around in a box. However, his deafness could sometimes be to his advantage, as he could feign misapprehension or simply turn off his device when he no longer wished to listen to someone. Physically, Hughes was short in stature and slightly built, standing and weighing around at most. He had a &quot;naturally weak constitution&quot;, suffering frequently from colds and other infections, and to compensate became a &quot;fanatical devotee of physical fitness&quot;. He also suffered from chronic indigestion, on account of which he abstained from red meat and alcohol and rarely ate large meals. Hughes often worked himself to exhaustion, and required long periods of convalescence to recharge – sometimes weeks or even months. He was prone to bouts of depression interspersed with periods of euphoria, and following a near nervous breakdown in 1924 was diagnosed with &quot;psychasthenia&quot;.

===Religion===
Hughes was a lifelong Anglican. He inherited this affiliation from his maternal side – his father was a Primitive Baptist and a deacon at the Welsh Baptist Church in London, though he wed with Anglican rites. Hughes attended church schools as a boy, and knew the King James Bible &quot;back to front&quot;. As an adult, he would often use Biblical turns of phrase in his writing and public speaking. Hughes&#x27;s participation in organised religion seemingly declined after he moved to Australia, and some writers have suggested that he became an agnostic or an atheist. The evidence for this is largely circumstantial – he was not a regular churchgoer, his first marriage was never solemnised in a church, and he frequently used blasphemous language.

All of Hughes&#x27;s biographers have regarded him as a sincere Christian, albeit with a rather idiosyncratic theology. Fitzhardinge writes that Hughes had &quot;a generalised faith in the spiritual values of Christianity&quot; combined with &quot;a profound belief in the after-life and the all-pervasiveness of God&quot;. Hughes rarely addressed metaphysics in his own works, but in his memoirs did note that he had rejected the doctrine of predestination at an early age: &quot;I believed as a man sowed so he should reap ... &quot;by faith and works&quot; he might find salvation.&quot; Manning Clark was somewhat sceptical of the earnestness of the beliefs that Hughes professed in public. With regard to Hughes&#x27;s personal philosophy, Clark wrote that he had a &quot;bleakly Hobbesian view of life&quot;, seeing it as &quot;a savage elemental struggle for survival in which strong men crushed the weak&quot;.

Hughes frequently exploited religion for political ends. In his early days in the labour movement, he drew on his mastery of scripture to reassure Christians that socialism was not anti-religious or atheistic. Hughes became stridently anti-Catholic during World War I, though this was due to political interference from the church hierarchy rather than on theological grounds. He &quot;inflamed sectarianism to a tragic degree&quot; with vitriolic personal attacks on Catholic leaders; James Scullin, Australia&#x27;s first Catholic prime minister, would later suggest that Hughes&#x27;s divisiveness &quot;very nearly wrecked Australia&quot;. He also banned the use of German in Australian churches, though this affected Lutherans more than Catholics.

===Sport===
Hughes was a supporter of the Glebe Dirty Reds in the New South Wales Rugby League premiership, and was their inaugural club Patron in 1908.

==Legacy==
Hughes, a tiny, wiry man, with a raspy voice and an increasingly wizened face, was an unlikely national leader, but during the First World War he acquired a reputation as a war leader—the troops called him the &quot;Little Digger&quot;—that sustained him for the rest of his life. He is remembered for his outstanding political and diplomatic skills, for his many witty sayings, and for his irrepressible optimism and patriotism. At the same time, the Australian labour movement never forgave him for defecting to the conservatives, and still considers him a &quot;rat&quot;.
==Honours==
* King&#x27;s Counsel (KC), 1909 
* Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada (PC), 1916 
* Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH), 1941
* Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour, 1941
* In 1916 he declined the offer of a peerage from the UK Prime Minister David Lloyd George, saying &quot;Good God, David! Do you want to ruin me? I am Labor Prime Minister of Australia and President of the Waterside Workers&#x27; Federation&quot;. He also declined offers of knighthood.

===Freedom of the City===
Hughes was honored with fifteen &quot;Freedom of the City&quot; awards – more than any other Prime Minister of Australia. Among these are the following cities in the United Kingdom:
* Aberdeen, Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Liverpool, London, Manchester, Sheffield, York

===Honorary appointments===
Hughes received honorary degrees from the following universities: 
* University of Edinburgh
* University of Glasgow
* University of Birmingham 
* University of Oxford
* University of Wales 
The Division of Hughes and the suburb of Hughes, Australian Capital Territory in Canberra are named after him. A park in Lane Cove, is named Hughes Park after Hughes.

In 1972, he was honoured on a postage stamp bearing his portrait issued by Australia Post.

After marrying his wife Mary in 1911, the couple went on a long drive, because he did not have time for a honeymoon. Their car crashed where the Sydney–Melbourne road crossed the Main Southern railway line north of Albury, leading to the level crossing there being named after him; it was later replaced by the Billy Hughes Bridge.

<text>Ocean&#x27;s 11 is a 1960 American heist film directed and produced by Lewis Milestone from a screenplay by Harry Brown and Charles Lederer, based on a story by George Clayton Johnson and Jack Golden Russell. The film stars an ensemble cast and five members of the Rat Pack: Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Peter Lawford, and Joey Bishop. Centered on a series of Las Vegas casino robberies, the film also stars Angie Dickinson, Richard Conte, Cesar Romero, Patrice Wymore, Akim Tamiroff, and Henry Silva. It includes cameo appearances by Shirley MacLaine, Red Skelton, and George Raft.

&quot;Ocean&#x27;s 11&quot; premiered in Las Vegas on August 3, 1960, and was theatrically released in the United States on August 10 by Warner Bros. Pictures. The film received mixed reviews from critics. It originated the &quot;Ocean&#x27;s&quot; film series.

==Plot==
World War II veterans Danny Ocean and Jimmy Foster recruit nine comrades from their unit in the 82nd Airborne Division to simultaneously rob five Las Vegas casinos: the Sahara, the Riviera, the Desert Inn, the Sands, and the Flamingo.
The gang plans the elaborate New Year&#x27;s Eve heist with the precision of a military operation. Josh Howard takes a job as a sanitation worker driving a garbage truck while others get jobs at the various casinos. Sam Harmon entertains in one of the hotel&#x27;s lounges. Demolition charges are planted on a local electric power transmission tower and the backup electrical systems are covertly rewired in each casino to open the cashier cages when the automatic generator kicks in. At midnight on New Year&#x27;s Eve, the tower is blown up and the Las Vegas Strip goes dark, as the men sneak into the money cages, hold up the cashiers, and dump their collection bags into the hotels&#x27; garbage bins. A garbage truck driven by Josh picks up the bags and passes through the police blockade. Everything appears to have gone off without a hitch.

The gang&#x27;s electrician, Tony Bergdorf, drops dead of a heart attack in the middle of the Strip. This raises police suspicions, who wonder if there is any connection to the thefts. Reformed mobster Duke Santos offers to recover the casino bosses&#x27; money for a percentage. As the robbery was well organized, he assumes that it was a Mafia operation until his underworld connections deny any involvement. Duke is engaged to Foster&#x27;s mother, who casually mentions that Foster and Ocean, having fought together in the army, are both unexpectedly in Las Vegas. Duke also learns about Bergdorf&#x27;s military record from the police. By the time that Bergdorf&#x27;s body arrives at the mortuary, Duke has pieced it all together.

Duke confronts the thieves, demanding half of their take. In desperation, they hide the money in Bergdorf&#x27;s coffin, setting aside $10,000 for his widow. The group plans to take back the rest, making no payoff to Duke, after the coffin is shipped to San Francisco. Their plan backfires when the funeral director talks Bergdorf&#x27;s widow into having the funeral in Las Vegas. She has the body and coffin cremated along with all of the hidden cash.

==Production==
Peter Lawford was first told of the film&#x27;s basic premise by director Gilbert Kay, who had heard the idea from a filling station attendant. Lawford bought the rights in 1958, envisioning William Holden in the lead. Frank Sinatra became interested in the idea, and a variety of writers worked on the project. When Lawford first told Sinatra of the story, Sinatra joked, &quot;Forget the movie, let&#x27;s pull the job!&quot;

The animated title sequence was designed by Saul Bass. The film&#x27;s closing shot shows the main cast walking away from the funeral home, with the Sands Hotel marquee behind them, listing their names as headliners.

The Las Vegas portion of the film was shot on location at the Flamingo, Sands, Desert Inn, Riviera, and Sahara hotels. One segment was also filmed at the former Las Vegas Union Pacific station. According to Frank Sinatra, Jr., the Rat Pack members were performing shows at 8pm and midnight during the production, so by the time the cast and crew were ready after the shows, much of the footage on location was shot between 3am and dawn.

Two Beverly Hills locations were used: the opening barber shop scene was filmed at 9740 Wilshire Boulevard and the scenes at Spyros Acebos&#x27;s house were filmed at 230 Ladera Drive, which belonged to Hollywood agent Kurt Frings.

==Reception==
The film received mixed reviews from critics. Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; disliked the film because &quot;there is no built-in implication that the boys have done something wrong. There is just an ironic, unexpected and decidedly ghoulish twist whereby they are deprived of their pickings and what seems their just desserts. This is the flaw in the picture — this and the incidental fact that a wholesale holdup of Las Vegas would not be so easy as it is made to look&quot;.

&quot;Variety&quot; wrote that the film was &quot;frequently one resonant wisecrack away from turning into a musical comedy. Laboring under the handicaps of a contrived script, an uncertain approach and personalities in essence playing themselves, the Lewis Milestone production never quite makes its point, but romps along merrily unconcerned that it doesn&#x27;t&quot;. Leo Sullivan of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called the film &quot;nothing more than a whopping sick joke in Technicolor ... It&#x27;s a completely amoral tale, told for laughs&quot;.

Philip K. Scheuer of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that the film &quot;has a pretty good surprise twist at the finish and is, of its type, a pretty good comedy-melodrama&quot;. A mixed review in &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; called it &quot;an overlong, intermittently amusing picture full of surface effects and private jokes ... Despite Milestone&#x27;s efforts, the first third tends to drag, due mainly to desultory characterisation, but when the raid begins both situations and dialogue improve considerably&quot;.

On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Ocean&#x27;s 11&quot; holds a &quot;rotten&quot; rating of 45%, based on 33 reviews, with an average rating of 5.3/10. The critical consensus reads: &quot;Easygoing but lazy, &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Eleven&quot; blithely coasts on the well-established rapport of the Rat Pack royalty&quot;. On Metacritic, it has a score of 57 out of 100 based on 6 critics reviews, indicating &quot;Mixed or average reviews.&quot;

<doc id="154957" wikidata="Q55801" url="?curid=154957" title="New Zealand national rugby union team">
<text>The New Zealand national rugby union team, commonly known as the All Blacks, represents New Zealand in men&#x27;s international rugby union, which is considered the country&#x27;s national sport. Famed for their international success, the All Blacks have often been regarded as one of the most successful sports teams in history.

The team won the Rugby World Cup in 1987, 2011, and 2015, second only to South Africa&#x27;s Springboks, who have won the Rugby World Cup four times. They were the first country to retain the Rugby World Cup. Since their international debut in 1903, the All Blacks have played test matches against 19 nations, of which 12 have never won a game against the team. New Zealand has a 76 per cent winning record in test match rugby, and has secured more wins than losses against every test opponent. The team has also played against three multinational all–star teams, losing only 8 of 45 matches. Since the introduction of the World Rugby Rankings in 2003, New Zealand has held the number-one ranking longer than all other teams combined. They jointly hold the record for the most consecutive test match wins for a tier-one ranked nation, along with England.

The All Blacks compete with Argentina, Australia and South Africa in the Rugby Championship, and have won the trophy twenty times in the competition&#x27;s 29–year history. The team has completed a Grand Slam tour against the four Home Nations four times (1978, 2005, 2008 and 2010). World Rugby has named New Zealand the World Rugby Team of the Year ten times since the award was initiated in 2001, and an All Black has won the World Rugby Player of the Year award ten times over the same period. Nineteen former All Blacks have been inducted into the World Rugby Hall Of Fame.

The team&#x27;s first match took place in 1884 in New South Wales and their first international test match in 1903 against Australia in Sydney. The following year New Zealand hosted their first home test, a match against a British Isles side in Wellington. There followed a 34–game tour of Europe and North America in 1905 (which included five test matches), where New Zealand suffered only one defeat: their first test loss, against Wales.

New Zealand&#x27;s early uniforms consisted of a black jersey with a silver fern and white shorts. By the 1905 tour they were wearing all black, except for the silver fern, and the name &quot;All Blacks&quot; dates from this time.

The team perform a haka before every match; this is a Māori challenge or posture dance. Traditionally the All Blacks use Te Rauparaha&#x27;s haka &quot;Ka Mate&quot;, although players have also performed &quot;Kapa o Pango&quot; since 2005.

==History==

===Introduction of rugby to New Zealand===
Rugby union, known almost universally in New Zealand as just &quot;rugby&quot;, was introduced to the nation by Charles Monro in 1870; he had discovered the sport while completing his studies at Christ&#x27;s College in Finchley, England. The first recorded game in New Zealand took place in May 1870 in the city of Nelson, between the Nelson rugby club and Nelson College. The first provincial union, the Canterbury Rugby Football Union, was formed in 1879, and New Zealand&#x27;s first internationals were played in 1882 when the &quot;Waratahs&quot; from New South Wales toured the country. The Australian team did not face a New Zealand national team but played seven provincial sides; the tourists won four games and lost three. Two years later, the first New Zealand team to travel overseas toured New South Wales, winning all eight of their games.

A privately organised British team, which later became the British &amp; Irish Lions, toured New Zealand in 1888. The visitors only played provincial sides and no test matches were played. Wales and Scotland were represented in the British team, but the players were drawn mainly from Northern England.

===International competition begins===

In 1892, following the canvassing of provincial administrators by Ernest Hoben, the New Zealand Rugby Football Union (NZRFU) was formed by the majority of New Zealand&#x27;s provincial unions, but did not include Canterbury, Otago or Southland. The first officially sanctioned New Zealand side toured New South Wales in 1893, where the Thomas Ellison captained team won nine of their ten matches. The following year New Zealand played its first home &quot;international&quot; game, losing 6–8 to New South Wales. The team&#x27;s first true test match occurred against Australia on 15 August 1903 at the Sydney Cricket Ground in front of over 30,000 spectators and resulted in a 22–3 victory.
A representative New Zealand team first toured the British Isles in 1905. The side is now known as the &quot;Originals&quot;, as the &quot;All Blacks&quot; name emerged during this tour when, according to team member Billy Wallace, a London newspaper reported that the New Zealanders played as if they were &quot;all backs&quot;. Wallace claimed that because of a typographical error, subsequent references were to &quot;All Blacks&quot;. This account is most likely a myth: because of their black playing strip, the side was probably referred to as the &quot;Blacks&quot; before they left New Zealand. Even though the name All Blacks most likely existed before the trip, the tour did popularise it.

The Originals played 35 matches on tour, and their only loss was a 0–3 defeat to Wales in Cardiff. The match has entered into the folklore of both countries because of a controversy over whether All Black Bob Deans had scored a try that would have earned his team a 3–3 draw. In contrast to the success of the Originals on the field, the team did antagonise some in the Home Nations&#x27; rugby establishment; both administrators and the press complained that the All Blacks did not play the game within the amateur and gentlemanly spirit promoted by the International Rugby Football Board. This complaint continued to dog New Zealand teams until the 1930s.

The success of the Originals had uncomfortable consequences for the amateur NZRFU. In 1907, a party of professional players was assembled to tour the British Isles and play rugby leaguea professional offshoot of rugby union that was played by clubs that split from England&#x27;s Rugby Football Union (RFU) due to disagreements over financial compensation for players. When the &quot;All Golds&quot;, as the team came to be known, returned they established rugby league in New Zealand, and a large number of players switched to the professional code. English and Welsh authorities were alarmed by the threat of professionalism to rugby in New Zealand, and in 1908 an Anglo-Welsh side undertook a tour to New Zealand to help promote the amateur values under which they believed sport should be played. The tourists were defeated 2–0 in the three-test series by New Zealand, but the Anglo-Welsh did manage to draw the second test 3–3.

===Development of a legacy===
International rugby was suspended during the First World War, but a New Zealand Services team did compete in inter-services competition known as the King&#x27;s Cup. After their departure from Europe the side toured South Africa before their return to New Zealand, and that tour paved the way for a South African team to tour New Zealand in 1921. The Springboksas the South African team is knownplayed New Zealand in a test series that ended all square. New Zealand conducted a return tour to South Africa in 1928, and the test series was again drawn; both teams winning two tests each.
The 1924 All Black tourists to the British Isles and France were dubbed &quot;the Invincibles&quot; because they won every game. However, the team was deprived of a potential grand slam when Scotland refused to play them because they were upset the tour was organised through the RFU rather than the IRFB. The first British Isles side since 1908 toured New Zealand in 1930. Although the Lions won the first test, the home side regrouped and went on to win the series 3–1. New Zealand toured the British Isles again in 1935–36, losing only three gamesincluding two testsduring a 30-match tour. In one of these losses, Alexander Obolensky famously scored two tries to help England to a 13–0 win; their first over New Zealand.

In 1937, South Africa toured New Zealand and decisively won the test series despite losing the first test; this 1937 South African team was described as the best team ever to leave New Zealand. It was not until 1949 that New Zealand next played the Springboks when they toured South Africa with Fred Allen as captain. Although each test against South Africa was very close, New Zealand lost the series 0–4. As part of this 25-match, 4-test series, an All Blacks &#x27;second string&#x27; side travelled up to Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) to face the Rhodesia representative side 
in two non-Test Internationals. The result of the first match saw Rhodesia run out winners, 10–8. Three days later, the second match resulted in a 3–3 draw. Two of the Rhodesian players were later capped for South Africa (being eligible due to Rhodesia&#x27;s treatment as a province of South Africa, for rugby reasons) in the All Blacks second test of the tour. No International caps were awarded to either side for these two matches.
At the same time as an All Black team was touring South Africa, Australia were touring New Zealand. The two tours coincided because Māori players were not able to go to South Africa at the time due to apartheid (the All Black team in South Africa refused to do the haka in protest), meaning the Australians played against a New Zealand team made up of the best Māori and the reserve non-Māori players, while the South Africans encountered the best pākehā (white) players. On the afternoon of 3 September New Zealand, captained by Johnny Smith, were beaten 6–11 by Australia in Wellington. New Zealand then lost their second test 9–16, giving Australia a Bledisloe Cup series win in New Zealand for the first time. 1949 was an &quot;annus horribilis&quot; for the All Blacks as they lost all six of their test matches, and the experience of playing two test series simultaneously has not been repeated.

The two consecutive series losses to South Africa made their 1956 tour of New Zealand highly anticipated. New Zealand were captained by Bob Duff and coached by Bob Stuart, and their 3–1 series win was their first over the Springboks and the Springboks&#x27; first series loss that century. During the series, New Zealand introduced Don Clarke, and brought prop Kevin Skinner out of retirement to help secure the win. Skinner, a former New Zealand boxing champion, had retired from international rugby, but was convinced to return for the third and fourth tests. One reason for Skinner&#x27;s selection was to &quot;sort out&quot; the South African props, while Clarke become known as &quot;The Boot&quot; for his goal kicking.

New Zealand&#x27;s 3–1 series win over the Lions in 1959 proved to be the start of a dominant period in All Black rugby. This was followed by the 1963–64 tour to Britain and Ireland, led by Wilson Whineray, in which New Zealand were deprived of a Grand Slam by a scoreless draw with Scotland. The only loss on this tour was to Newport RFC, who won 3–0 at Rodney Parade, Newport on 30 October 1963. The 1967 side won three tests against the home nations, but was unable to play Ireland because of a foot-and-mouth scare. This tour formed part of New Zealand&#x27;s longest winning streak, between 1965 and 1970, of 17 test victories. This was also the longest test winning streak by any nation at the time; it was equalled by the Springboks in 1998, and surpassed by Lithuania in 2010.

NZ then lost the 1970 away series in South Africa. Although the 1966 Lions had been defeated 0–4 in their New Zealand tour, there was a reversal of fortune five years later when the 1971 Lions, under the captaincy of Welshman John Dawes, beat New Zealand in a test series, which remains the Lions&#x27; only series victory in New Zealand.

The 1972–3 tourists narrowly missed a Grand Slam with a draw against Ireland. The tour was notable for the sending home of prop Keith Murdoch, who was alleged to have been involved in a brawl in a Cardiff hotel while celebrating the defeat of Wales.

In 1978, Graham Mourie captained New Zealand to their first Grand Slam, including a 13–12 victory over Wales. That game generated controversy after New Zealand won as the result of a late penalty. Lock Andy Haden had dived out of a line-out in an attempt to earn a penalty, but referee Roger Quittenden insisted the penalty was against Welsh lock Geoff Wheel for jumping off the shoulder of Frank Oliver. New Zealand&#x27;s only loss on the tour was the famous 12–0 defeat by Irish province Munster at Thomond Park. A play that focused on the loss was later written by John Breen, called &quot;Alone it Stands&quot;.

===Controversial tours===

For the 1960 All Blacks tour of South Africa, the South African authorities insisted that Maori players be excluded from the team. The subsequent controversy led to the New Zealand Rugby Union refusing any other tour of the country for the following 10 years until the 1970 tour, when Maori players were accepted as &quot;honorary whites&quot;.

The 1976 All Blacks tour of apartheid South Africa generated much controversy and led to the boycott of the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal by 33 African nations after the IOC refused to ban the team. New Zealand again failed to win the test series in South Africa, and did not secure another series victory until 1996, after the fall of apartheid and the introduction of neutral referees. The 1976 tour contributed to the Gleneagles Agreement being adopted by the Commonwealth Heads of State in 1977.
The 1981 South African tour to New Zealand sparked a protest movement against South Africa&#x27;s apartheid policy; this type of protest had not been seen in New Zealand since the 1951 waterfront dispute. The NZRU had invited the Springboks to tour because the Muldoon government refused to involve politics in sport. Although New Zealand won the test series, two of the tour&#x27;s provincial games were cancelled and the whole tour was marred by violence and protest. The third and final test match of the tour is sometimes known as the Flour Bomb test, as an anti-apartheid activist in a Cessna light aircraft dropped leaflets, flares, a parachute-supported banner reading &quot;Biko&quot;, and flour bombs, into Auckland&#x27;s Eden Park throughout the match, felling a New Zealand player. The country experienced unrest during the tour, which had a significant impact on New Zealand society.

The 1985 All Blacks tour to South Africa was cancelled after legal action on the grounds that it would breach the NZRU&#x27;s constitution. In 1986, a rebel tour to South Africa took place that had not been authorised by the NZRU and the team, named the Cavaliers, included many All Blacks. Those that participated in the tour received a ban for two tests from the NZRU when they returned to New Zealand. Allegations that players received payment for the tour were never proved.

===Early World Cups===
New Zealand hosted and won the inaugural World Cup in 1987 beating France 29–9 in the final. New Zealand conceded only 52 points and scored 43 tries in six games en route to the title, beating Italy, Fiji, Argentina, Scotland, Wales and France.

The All Blacks suffered a dual blow in early-mid 1990. Undisputed test fullback John Gallagher switched codes and signed to play with English rugby league club Leeds. This came after his 1989 tour understudy Matthew Ridge had signed to play rugby league with Sydney based club Manly-Warringah less than a week earlier. Around this time union also lost other goal-kicking All Blacks to rugby league including John Schuster (Newcastle Knights in Australia), Frano Botica (English club Wigan) and Kurt Sherlock (Sydney club Eastern Suburbs). New Zealand rugby also lost Waikato goal kicking fullback Daryl Halligan who signed to play league for the North Sydney Bears. As it turned out, they were also very close to losing Zinzan Brooke who was set to join Ridge at Manly when (according to Ridge) a personal dispute between the two saw Brooke back out on a signed contract with Manly (allegedly worth AU$100,000 per season) to stay in rugby union.

By the 1991 World Cup New Zealand were an ageing side, co-coached by Alex Wyllie and John Hart. After beating hosts England in the tournament opener, they struggled during pool matches against the United States and Italy, and won their quarter-final against Canada. They were then knocked out by eventual winners Australia 16–6 in their semi-final at Lansdowne Road. In the wake of the tournament, there were many retirements, including coach Wyllie, who had enjoyed an 86 per cent win rate during 29 tests in charge.

Laurie Mains replaced Wyllie in 1992, and was given the job of preparing the side for the 1995 event in South Africa. New Zealand were again one of the favourites to take the championship. Their status as favourites was enhanced when a young Jonah Lomu scored four tries against England in the 45–29 semi-final win. They managed to take hosts South Africa to extra time in the final, before losing 12–15 to Joel Stransky&#x27;s drop goal.

===Professionalism===
The professional era in rugby union began in 1995, spurred by creation of the SANZAR group (a combination of South Africa, New Zealand and Australia) which was formed with the purpose of selling broadcast rights for two new competitions, the domestic Super 12 competition and the Tri-Nations. The first Tri-Nations was contested in 1996, with New Zealand winning all four of their tests to take the trophy. After a 1996 Tri-Nations match hosted by South Africa, won 29–18 by New Zealand, preceded a separate three-match test series between the two sides. Under new coach John Hart and the captaincy of Sean Fitzpatrick, New Zealand won a test series in South Africa for the first time. Fitzpatrick rated the series win higher than the 1987 World Cup victory in which he had participated.

The next three seasons saw mixed results for New Zealand, who won all their Tri-Nations tests in 1997 before losing the title for the first time in 1998. In 1998 New Zealand lost all five tests in the Tri-Nations and Bledisloe Cup series (two to South Africa and three to Australia), the first time they had lost four tests in succession since 1949. The following year they suffered their worst test loss, 7–28 to Australia in Sydney. At the 1999 World Cup later that year, the All Blacks dominated their pool, handing England a 16–30 defeat at Twickenham. They advanced past Scotland 30–18 in the quarter-finals to play France at Twickenham. After New Zealand finished the first half 17–10 ahead, France then produced a famous half of rugby to which New Zealand had no answer, winning 43–31. Hart subsequently resigned as coach and was replaced by co-coaches Wayne Smith and Tony Gilbert.

Under Smith and Gilbert, New Zealand came second in the 2000 and 2001 Tri-Nations, and in neither season did the side reclaim the Bledisloe Cupwhich had been lost in 1998. Both coaches were replaced by John Mitchell on 3 October 2001, and he went on to coach New Zealand to victory in both the 2002 and 2003 Tri-Nations, as well as regaining the Bledisloe Cup in 2003. Mitchell&#x27;s abrasive personal manner and management style, together with his coaching techniques, were the subject of some controversy both at the time and subsequently. Despite losing to England earlier in the year, the All Blacks entered the 2003 World Cup as one of the favourites and dominated their pool, running up wins against Italy, Canada and Tonga, before winning one of the most competitive matches of the tournament against Wales. They defeated South Africa in their quarter-final, a team they had never beaten at the World Cup, 29–9, but lost to Australia 10–22 in the semi-final in Sydney. Following the team&#x27;s lacklustre showing in the tournament, the NZRU terminated Mitchell&#x27;s contract and installed Graham Henry as national coach.

===Henry era===
Graham Henry&#x27;s tenure as coach began with a double victory over 2003 Rugby World Cup winners England in 2004. The two games had an aggregate score of 72–15, and England were kept try-less. Despite the winning start to Henry&#x27;s tenure, the Tri-Nations was a mixed success with two wins and two losses. The competition was the closest ever, bonus points decided the outcome, and New Zealand finishing last. The 2004 season finished with three wins in Europe, including a record 45–6 victory over France under new captain and outside centre Tana Umaga.

2005 saw New Zealand host the touring British &amp; Irish Lions, steered by World Cup-winning English coach Clive Woodward, and featuring a number of Northern Hemisphere stars including Jonny Wilkinson. New Zealand won all three games easily, with a young Dan Carter turning in a masterclass in the second test. The series was marred by an incident in the first test after the Lions captain, Irish centre Brian O&#x27;Driscoll, was upended in an aggressive clearout by Tana Umaga and Keven Mealamu. O&#x27;Driscoll suffered a dislocated shoulder and missed the rest of the tour as a result. Match footage was inconclusive at the time, and both Umaga and Mealamu escaped serious sanction. O&#x27;Driscoll and the Lions management maintained it was a deliberate spear tackle, and the controversy both tainted the All Blacks&#x27; series victory and continued for some years afterward.

That same year, they also won the Tri-Nations, and achieved a second Grand Slam over the Home Nations for the first time since 1978. They went on to sweep the major IRB (now World Rugby) awards in which they were named: Team of the Year, Henry was named Coach of the Year, and first five-eighth Dan Carter was Player of the Year. New Zealand were nominated for the Laureus World Sports Award for Team of the Year in 2006 for their 2005 performance. The following year they again took the Tri-Nations Series after winning their first five matches, three against Australia and two against South Africa. They lost their final match of the series against South Africa. They completed their end of year tour unbeaten, with record away wins over France, England and Wales. New Zealand were named 2006 IRB Team of the Year and were nominated for the Laureus World Sports Award for the second time, while flanker and newly appointed captain Richie McCaw was named IRB Player of the Year for the first time.

The 2007 season started off with two mid-year tests against France. New Zealand won the tests 42–11 at Eden Park and 61–10 at Westpac Stadium. A third game, against Canada, resulted in a 64–13 win, although the game was more competitive than the scoreline indicated. New Zealand&#x27;s first Tri-Nations game of 2007 was against the Springboks in Durban, South Africa. New Zealand scored two tries in the final fifteen minutes of the game to win 26–21. The following week against the Wallabies at the Melbourne Cricket Ground the Wallabies upset New Zealand to win 20–15. The All Blacks won their following home games to successfully defend the Tri-Nations Series for 2007. New Zealand entered the 2007 Rugby World Cup as favourites, and topped their pool, beating Scotland, Italy, Romania and Portugal by at least 40 points. However, they then suffered a defeat by hosts France in the quarter-finals in Cardiff. Following the loss to France coach Graham Henry&#x27;s job was reappointed amid vocal debate and comment, despite Robbie Deans being a strong contender.
The 2008 season started with three mid-year tests against Ireland and England, all of which New Zealand won. New Zealand played their first Tri-Nations game against South Africa in Wellington, winning 19–8, but a week later at Carisbrook in Dunedin they lost to South Africa 28–30, ending a 30-match winning streak at home. New Zealand played their next Tri-Nations match on 26 July against Australia in Sydney, losing 19–34 but a week later against Australia in New Zealand won 39–10. They then beat South Africa 19–0 at Newlands Stadium. New Zealand played their final match on 13 September against Australia at Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane winning 28–24 and retaining the Bledisloe Cup and the Tri-Nations.

The All Blacks opened the 2009 season with a 22–27 loss to France at Carisbrook, but defeated them 14–10 in Wellington a week later. On points difference, France won the Dave Gallaher Cup for the first time. A week later the All Blacks defeated Italy 27–6 in Christchurch. They finished second in the Tri-Nations Series, behind South Africa who lost only one game, and ended the series with a 33–6 win over Australia in Wellington.

In 2010, the All Blacks won the Tri-Nations Series for the tenth time after three successive victories against South Africa, and won the Bledisloe Cup after consecutive victories against Australia. An undefeated streak in tests that began in 2009 reached 15 matches. Despite losing the 2011 Tri-Nations after a loss to Australia in Brisbane, they still entered the 2011 Rugby World Cup as one of the favourites. The All Blacks went through their pool matches undefeated, and after defeating Argentina, and then Australia, faced France in the final. New Zealand scored one try and a penalty to narrowly win 8–7. Henry stepped down as coach following the World Cup, and was replaced as head coach by his assistant Steve Hansen.

===Hansen era===
The Tri-Nations was expanded to include Argentina in 2012, and subsequently renamed The Rugby Championship. The All Blacks went undefeated in the inaugural tournament, and went through the year unbeaten until their last match of the year, where they lost to England at Twickenham. In 2013 New Zealand hosted France in a three-match seriestheir first meeting since the 2011 World Cup final. They won all three tests, before going unbeaten in the 2013 Rugby Championship. In November 2013, New Zealand became the first rugby nation in the professional era to achieve a 100 per cent record in a calendar year.

At the 2014 Rugby Championship, the All Blacks drew with Australia and lost to South Africa in the away matches, but won the other four matches and the tournament. At the shortened 2015 Rugby Championship, the All Blacks lost to Australia and was runner-up in the competition. They did, however achieve a significant return victory in the second Bledisloe test that year to retain the trophy. The team entered the 2015 Rugby World Cup and again went undefeated in their pool matches. They defeated France 62–13 in the quarter-finals, South Africa 20–18 in the semi-finals, and Australia 34–17 in the final to become the first nation to retain the World Championship title and the first to win the Rugby World Cup three times.

The All Blacks went undefeated at the 2016 Rugby Championship, claiming bonus points at each match, under new captain and Number 8, Kieran Read and vice-captain and fullback Ben Smith. Smith and wing Israel Dagg were also the joint highest try scorers in the competition with five each, while fly-half Beauden Barrett was the highest points scorer of the competition with 81 in total. The autumn of 2016 witnessed an historic defeat, with the All Blacks enduring their first ever loss to Ireland after 111 years of competition, going down by 29–40 at Soldier Field in Chicago. New Zealand redeemed the loss by defeating Ireland in Dublin in the return game two weeks later, by 21–9.

In 2017, the British &amp; Irish Lions toured New Zealand for the second time in the professional era. The series finished in a draw, with the All Blacks and Lions recording 1–1–1. The All Blacks had won the first test 30–15, the Lions took the second test 24–21, and the final test was drawn 15–15. Like the 2005 tour, this Lions series was dogged by controversy, with the Lions&#x27; tactics (under expat Kiwi Coach Warren Gatland), the tone of local media coverage, the Red Card awarded to Sonny Bill Williams in the second test and the refereeing of French officials Romain Poite and Jerome Garces all hotly debated. The drawn series, combined with the loss to Ireland to previous year led some in the media to claim that the team were on the slide, and that the Northern Hemisphere sides were catching up. However they went on to go undefeated in the Rugby Championship 2017 season and also securing the Bledisloe Cup against rivals Australia after defeating the Aussies twice in the Rugby Championship. In October, New Zealand suffered a surprise 18–23 loss to Australia, in the final Bledisloe game of the year at Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane. The autumn saw the All Blacks defeat a Barbarians team 32–21, France 38–18, Scotland 22–17 and Wales 33–18 to end the 2017 season.

At the start of the 2018 season, the All Blacks saw off a touring French side in a 3–0 series victory, and won their first games of the Rugby Championship against Australia by 38–13 and 40–12 to keep the Bledisloe Cup for another year. Another easy win against Argentina by 46–24 followed, however the All Blacks were subsequently beaten at home in Wellington by South Africa for the first time since 2009, losing by 34–36 in a tightly contested game, before again beating Argentina by 35–17. In the return match against South Africa in Pretoria, the All Blacks trailed for much of the game but produced a thrilling comeback late the second half to win by 32–30. They went on to post another crushing win over Australia by 37–20 in Yokohama, to confirm a Bledisloe whitewash for the year. A development side was left behind to pummel Japan 69–31, while the first team travelled to Europe for the autumn internationals. That series proved a relatively difficult one for the All Blacks, with a single-point victory over England (16–15) in a very closely fought test, followed by a second-ever loss to Ireland by 9–16 in a cauldron atmosphere at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin. They went on to thrash Italy by 66–3 to finish their season with a win.

2019 was a mixed year for the All Blacks, starting their campaign with an unconvincing 16 - 20 win over a tough Argentine side, and a 16 all draw against the Springboks. However, the next week they were given their joint worst loss in their history, once again to the Wallabies, 26 - 47, after Scott Barrett was sent off. They got back on track, showcasing the form they have been in the past years, with a 36 - 0 shutout in their rematch at Eden Park to retain the Bledisloe Cup, and finished their season with a 92 - 7 pummelling against Tonga.

The 2019 Rugby World Cup saw New Zealand face off against South Africa. They won, 23 - 13 in Yokohama, then notched wins up on Canada and Namibia, scoring a total of 135 points in the 2 games. In the quarter-final, they faced off against Ireland in Chofu, dominating from start to finish and prevailing 46 - 14. The team&#x27;s run ended in the semi-finals with a 7 - 19 loss to England in Yokohama, which ended their chances of a third consecutive world title, or &quot;three-peat&quot;. This was the team&#x27;s first World Cup defeat in 20 matches stretching back over twelve years. New Zealand finished their campaign with a 40 - 17 win over Wales in Chofu to claim the bronze medal. Hansen retired after the World Cup, along with many All Blacks veterans, most notably captain Kieran Read, Owen Franks and Ben Smith. Ian Foster was appointed as the new All Blacks coach.

=== Foster Era ===
2020

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 Rugby Championship was cancelled. Instead, a Tri-Nations revival tournament was held from October to December 2020. Two warm-up Bledisloe Cup matches were held before that, the first was a 16–16 draw and the second a 27–7 win. They then travelled over to Australia for the Tri-Nations, where they opened by securing the Bledisloe Cup with a (43–5) victory over Australia, but going on to lose to them a week later (22–24). The All Blacks lost a week later to Argentina (15–25) which was their first ever defeat to the Los Pumas and the first time they had lost back-to-back test matches since 2011. Thanks to a 38–0 win against Argentina two weeks later, the All Blacks won the Tri-Nations. They ended the 2020 season with three wins, two losses and a draw.

2021

The All Blacks opened their 2021 campaign by easily defeating Tonga (102–0), followed by two wins against Fiji (57–23) and (60–13). They opened their Bledisloe Cup campaign by defeating Australia at Eden Park (33–25). The All Blacks then went onto defeat the Wallabies 2 more times, (57–22) and (38–21) to retain the Bledisloe Cup. They defeated Argentina twice by comfortable margins. Against South Africa, their record was split (1-1), with New Zealand winning in the 100th Test Match between the two countries in a historic (19–17) victory, with the Springboks winning a week later by (31–29). They retained the Freedom Cup and they went on to win the Rugby Championship and finish the competition with a (5–1) record. In their first Northern Hemisphere Tour since 2018, the All Blacks played five matches and finished with a record of (3–2). They defeated the United States (104–14), Wales (54–16) and Italy (47–9), and then went onto lose two matches in a row against Ireland (20–29) and France (25–40), to finish the season (12–3). The back to back losses against Ireland and France was the first time since 1998 that they finished their season with 2 straight defeats in consecutive weeks.

2022

In July 2022, the All Blacks hosted Ireland to a 3-Test Match Series. In the first game the All Blacks defeated Ireland (42–19), before losing to them in the second game (12–23) and third game (22–32). It was the first time that Ireland had beaten the All Blacks at home, two times in a row and across a Test series. This also marked the third straight season that the All Blacks lost back to back test matches and this led them to make changes in their coaching setup. They opened their Rugby Championship campaign with a loss to the Springboks in South Africa (10–26), their third consecutive loss. They then rallied back the following week with a win at Ellis Park (35–23) to retain the Freedom Cup. They lost to Argentina (18–25) for the first time in New Zealand, before bouncing back with a (53–3) victory a week later. They then defeated Australia in a controversial and much debated (39–37) win, thus retaining the Bledisloe Cup. The All Blacks went on to defeat the Wallabies again (40–14) at Eden Park in Auckland. In their End Of Year Northern Tour, they defeated Japan (38–31), Wales (55–23), Scotland (31–23) but drew against England (25–25). The All Blacks finished with eight wins, four losses and one draw. It was their worst win/loss record since the 1998 season.

2023

In 2023, the All Blacks won the shortened version of the Rugby Championship (due to the World Cup) by defeating Argentina (41–12), South Africa (35–20), and Australia (38–7). They also kept the Freedom Cup for another year after beating the Springboks and had wrapped up the Bledisloe for another year after defeating the Wallabies (23–20) in the 2nd bledisloe game which was a test match outside the rugby championship. In a warm up game at Twickenham in London, the All Blacks lost to the Springboks (7–35), which became their worst ever defeat in their 120-year history. At the 2023 Rugby World Cup, the All Blacks tasted their first ever defeat in the pool stages when they were beaten by the host nation France (13–27). They defeated all the other teams in their pool, Namibia (71–3), Italy (96–17), Uruguay (73–0), to qualify for the quarter–finals. They defeated Ireland in the quarters (28–24), beat Argentina (44–6) in the semi–final but lost to the Springboks (11–12), who became the first nation to win four World Cups, in the final of the 2023 World Cup tournament. They ended their season with a record of nine wins and three losses. This marked the end of the Ian Foster era.

=== Robertson Era ===
After the conclusion of the 2023 Rugby World Cup tournament, Scott Robertson commenced the role of head coach from November 1, 2023. 

2024

Robertson&#x27;s first game as head coach took place against England in 2024. Robertson&#x27;s All Blacks team defeated England (16–15) at Forsyth Barr Stadium, in Dunedin. A week later in Eden Park, in Auckland, the All Blacks defeated England again (24–17). The All Blacks then travelled to San Diego, California, to face Fiji and defeated them (47–5). In the 2024 Rugby Championship, the All Blacks compiled a 3–3 record as they struggled and were outscored in the last 20 minutes in 5 of the 6 games. They split against Argentina, were swept by South Africa and then went on to sweep Australia. In the All Blacks Northern end of year tour, they beat Japan (64–19) in Yokohama, beat England (24–22) at Allianz Stadium, Twickenham and swept them 3–0 in 2024, beat Ireland (23–13) at the Aviva Stadium and lost to France (29–30) in the Stade de France before bouncing back a week later and defeating Italy (29–11) in Turin to go 4 wins from 5 against the Northern Hemisphere teams. In 2024, Scott Robertson had a 10–4 record in his first season as Head Coach.

==Uniform==
The current New Zealand jersey features a figure-hugging jersey and is entirely black except for sponsors&#x27; logos and the NZRU silver fern on the chest. However, black wasn&#x27;t always New Zealand&#x27;s colours. During the 1884 tour of Australia which was the first overseas New Zealand rugby tour, the team donned a dark blue jersey, with a gold fern insignia on the left of the jumper. In 1893, when the New Zealand Rugby Union was established, they stipulated that the uniform would be a black jersey with silver fern and white knickerbockers, although historic photographs suggest white shorts may have been used instead during these early years. There was a change some time after 1897, and in 1901 the team met New South Wales wearing an all black uniform for the first time - black jersey, a canvas top with no collar, and a silver fern, and black shorts.

In 2006, New Zealand wore an embroidered remembrance poppy on their jersey sleeve when playing France during the end-of-year tour. The poppy honours the ANZAC soldiers who died on the beaches of Gallipoli. Captain Richie McCaw said &quot;We want to honour the overseas service of New Zealanders. It is an important part of our history as a country and a team.&quot;

During the 2011 Rugby World Cup, there was an image of the Webb Ellis Cup embroidered on the sleeve of the All Blacks&#x27; jerseys, with the year &#x27;1987&#x27; below it to signify the team&#x27;s previous world title. Each of the four teams that had won the cup in previous years sported the same detailing on their jerseys.

===Kit suppliers===
Canterbury were kit suppliers to New Zealand from 1924 until 1999, when Adidas paid $70 million to clothe and shoe the All Blacks for five years. Nike also looked at sponsoring New Zealand at this time, but elected to sponsor Tiger Woods instead. In 2003, Adidas renewed this contract and paid the team US$200 million over nine years, expecting New Zealand to win around 75 per cent of their matches. In 2008, this deal was extended to 2019 for an undisclosed amount, In 2017 this was again extended to 2023 in a deal estimated to be worth about $10 million a year.

===Kit sponsors===
Steinlager was the first sponsor to appear on the All Blacks&#x27; jersey, in the left breast of the jersey (on the opposite side to the silver fern), lasting from 1994 to 1999, when Adidas took over as supplier. In 2012, AIG became the first to sponsor on the centre-front of the All Black jersey in a deal estimated to be worth approximately $80 million over five years. AIG extended this sponsorship to 2021 in a deal thought to be worth about $15m a year. After AIG decided not to renew their sponsorship deal with the team, it was announced that the would be the new main sponsor of the All Blacks from 2022, with a 6-year deal reportedly worth more than $120 million.

==Haka==

The All Blacks perform a haka (a Māori challenge) before every international match. The tradition has been closely associated with New Zealand rugby ever since a tour of Australia and the United Kingdom by the New Zealand Natives in 1888 and 1889, although it is likely that the New Zealand team that toured New South Wales in 1884 may also have performed a haka. The 1888–89 New Zealand native team used &quot;Ake Ake Kia Kaha&quot;, and a mocking haka, &quot;Tupoto koe, Kangaru!&quot;, was used by the 1903 team that visited Australia. In 1905, the All Blacks began the tradition of using &quot;Ka Mate&quot;, a haka composed in the 19th century by Te Rauparaha, leader of the Ngāti Toa tribe. The 1924 All Blacks used a specially composed haka, &quot;Ko Niu Tireni&quot;, but later All Blacks reverted to using &quot;Ka Mate&quot;.

In August 2005, before the Tri-Nations test match between New Zealand and South Africa at Carisbrook stadium in Dunedin, the All Blacks performed a new haka, &quot;Kapa o Pango&quot;, specially composed for the occasion by Derek Lardelli and intended to reflect the Polynesian-influenced multicultural make-up of contemporary New Zealand. Lardelli&#x27;s haka was not designed to replace &quot;Ka Mate&quot; as it was only meant to be used for special occasions. &quot;Kapa o Pango&quot; concludes with a move that has been interpreted as a &quot;throat slitting&quot; gesture, which has led to accusations that the haka encourages violence and sends the wrong message to All Blacks fans. However, according to Lardelli, the gesture is meant to represent &quot;drawing vital energy into the heart and lungs&quot;.

In November 2006, at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, Wales, the All Blacks performed the haka in the dressing room prior to the matchinstead of on the field immediately before kick-offfollowing a disagreement with the Welsh Rugby Union, who had wanted Wales to sing their national anthem immediately after the haka. In 2008, New Zealand played Munster at Thomond Park; before the match, Munster&#x27;s four New Zealand players challenged their opponents by performing their own haka before the All Blacks started theirs. On the same tour, Wales responded to New Zealand&#x27;s haka by silently refusing to move afterwards, and the two teams simply stared at each other until the referee forced them to start the game.

==Record==

===Overall===

New Zealand have only ever been beaten by seven test nations (and drawing to an additional nation in Scotland) and two combined teams (the British &amp; Irish Lions, and a World XV) and they are the only international team to have a winning record against every nation they have played. They have won 499 of their 651 test matches (; see table below) and have lost at home only 43 times. Since World Rankings were introduced by World Rugby in October 2003, New Zealand have occupied the number one ranking the majority of the time. In the decade from 2000 to 2009, New Zealand won 100 tests (92 per cent of their total games played).

New Zealand&#x27;s longest winning streak is 18 test victories (a Tier 1 joint world record), achieved between 2015 and 2016. In 2013 they won every test they played during a calendar year. The All Blacks hold the record for most consecutive test wins at home, a 47–match winning streak, achieved between 2009 and 2017. Their longest unbeaten streak is 23 tests (from 1987 to 1990) with one game being drawn.

Their all-time points record for tests stands at 18,626 points for and 8,974 points against (updated 23 November 2024). Many national rugby union teams have suffered their heaviest defeats when playing against New Zealand, these being Argentina (91–8), Fiji (91–0), France (61–10), Ireland (60–0), Japan (145–17), Portugal (108–13), Samoa (101–14), South Africa (57–0), Tonga (102–0, twice) and the British and Irish Lions (38–6). The All Blacks largest test win was (145–17) against Japan in 1995, while their heaviest loss was a (7–35) defeat to the Springboks in 2023.

Below is a summary of New Zealand test results (updated 23 November 2024):

===Rugby World Cup===
New Zealand have won the World Cup three times. They beat France in the final of the 1987 inaugural competition held in New Zealand and Australia, defeated France again in the final of the 2011 tournament, also hosted in New Zealand, and most recently defeated Australia in England in 2015, making them the first team to win the World Cup in consecutive tournaments. In 1991, they lost their semi-final to Australia before winning the playoff for third. In 1995, they reached the final, before losing in extra time to hosts South Africa. They finished in fourth place in 1999, after losing their semi-final and then the third-place playoff game. In 2003, New Zealand were knocked out by hosts Australia in their semi-final, before finishing third. The 2007 World Cup saw their worst tournament, being knocked out in the quarter-finals by the host nation France; until this they were the only team to have reached the semi-finals of every tournament. As a result of the poor performance in the 2007 World Cup the NZRU commissioned a 47-page report to detail the causes of the failure. In 2019, they lost in the semi-finals against England in a (7–19) defeat, and then finishing in third-place after beating Wales in the 3rd spot playoff game (40–17). In 2023, the All Blacks were defeated by the Springboks (11–12) in the final. The All Blacks had won every World Cup pool match they had played in until 8 September 2023 when they lost their first ever pool match in the opening match of the 2023 Rugby World Cup against the host nation France, and have finished top of their pool in 9 out of the 10 tournaments.

New Zealand holds several World Cup records: most World Cup matches (63), most points in one match (145 versus Japan in 1995), most cumulative points over all World Cups (2,888), most tries overall (396), most conversions (289) and also the record for the most points scored in the first half of a knockout game at the Rugby World Cup (29, against France 2015) along with the largest knockout margin (49) in the same match. They currently hold the record for the most consecutive wins at a World Cup, with 18 straight wins, spanning from 2011 to 2019. Several individual players also hold World Cup records, Jonah Lomu for most World Cup tries (15 over two World Cups)(tied with South Africa&#x27;s Bryan Habana), Marc Ellis with most tries in a match (6 versus Japan in 1995), Grant Fox with most points in one tournament (126 in 1987), and Simon Culhane with most points in a single game (45 versus Japan in 1995).

===Tri Nations and The Rugby Championship===
New Zealand&#x27;s only annual tournament is a competition involving the Southern Hemisphere&#x27;s top national teams. From 1996 through 2011, they competed in the Tri Nations against Australia and South Africa. In 2012, Argentina joined the competition, which was renamed The Rugby Championship. New Zealand&#x27;s record of 20 tournament wins (the most recent in 2023) and 103 match wins is well ahead of the other teams&#x27; records. The Bledisloe Cup is contested between New Zealand and Australia, and the Freedom Cup between New Zealand and South Africa, as part of the Tri Nations and The Rugby Championship.

===Notable players===

Nineteen former All Blacks have been inducted into the World Rugby Hall of Fame: Sir Fred Allen, Dan Carter, Don Clarke, Sean Fitzpatrick, Grant Fox, Dave Gallaher, Sir Michael Jones, Ian Kirkpatrick, Sir John Kirwan, Sir Brian Lochore, Jonah Lomu, Richie McCaw, Sir Colin Meads, Graham Mourie, George Nēpia, Sir Bryan Williams, Sir Wilson Whineray, and Joe Warbrick.

Joe Warbrick represented New Zealand on their historic 1884 tour to Australia, but is better known for selecting and captaining the 1888–89 New Zealand Native football team that embarked on a 107-match tour of New Zealand, Australia and the British Isles. The New Zealand Natives were the first New Zealand team to wear black uniforms, and the first to perform a haka.

Dave Gallaher played in New Zealand&#x27;s first ever test match in 1903 and also captained the 1905 Originals. Along with Billy Stead, Gallaher wrote the famous rugby book &quot;The Complete Rugby Footballer&quot;. At the age of only 19, George Nēpia played in all 30 matches on the Invincibles tour of 1924–25. Nēpia played 37 All Blacks games; his last was against the British Isles in 1930.

Sir Fred Allen captained all of his 21 matches for New Zealand, including six tests, between 1946 and 1949. He eventually moved on to coaching New Zealand between 1966 and 1968. New Zealand won all 14 of their test matches with Allen as coach.
Five hall of Fame inductees, including the first New Zealander named to the World Rugby Hall of Fame, played during the 1960s. Don Clarke was an All Black between 1956 and 1964 and during this period he broke the record at the time for All Black test points. Clarke famously scored six penalties in one match – a record at the time – to give New Zealand an 18–17 victory over the British Isles at Dunedin in 1959. Sir Wilson Whineray played 32 tests, captaining New Zealand in 30 of them. He played prop and also number 8 between 1957 and 1965. New Zealand lost only four of their 30 tests with Whineray as captain. On 21 October 2007, Whineray became the first New Zealander to earn induction to the World Rugby Hall of Fame. In Sir Colin Meads&#x27; New Zealand Rugby Museum profile, he is described as &quot;New Zealand&#x27;s equivalent of Australia&#x27;s Sir Donald Bradman or the United States of America&#x27;s Babe Ruth&quot;. Meads, nicknamed &quot;Pinetree&quot;, played 133 games for New Zealand, including 55 tests. In 1999 the New Zealand Rugby Monthly magazine named Meads the New Zealand player of the century. Ian Kirkpatrick played 39 tests, including nine as captain, between 1967 and 1977. He scored 16 tries in his test career, a record at the time.

There were two players in the Hall of Fame to debut in the 1970s one was flanker Graham Mourie. He captained 19 of his 21 tests and 57 of his 61 overall All Blacks matches between 1976 and 1982. Most notably, in 1978 he was captain of the first All Blacks side to complete a Grand Slam over the four Home Nations sides.

The 1987 World Cup champions were coached by Sir Brian Lochore who had represented New Zealand in 25 tests between 1964 and 1971, including 17 as captain. He was knighted in 1999 for his lifetime services to rugby. Four of the 1987 World Cup squad that he had coached are also inductees in the Hall of Fame. Sir John Kirwan played a total of 63 tests between 1984 and 1994, scoring 35 tries, an All Blacks record at the time. In the 1987 World Cup opener against Italy, Kirwan raced 90 meters to score one of the tries of the tournament.
An All Black from 1984 to 1993, Grant Fox was one of New Zealand&#x27;s greatest point-scorers with 1067 points, including 645 test points. Fox played 46 tests, including the 1987 World Cup final against France. Known as The Iceman, Michael Jones was one of the greatest open side flankers of all time. Born in Auckland, New Zealand, Jones first played international rugby for Samoa, then for New Zealand, playing 55 tests between 1987 and 1998. Due to his Christian faith, Jones never played rugby on Sundays, resulting in him not playing in the 1991 World Cup semi-final against Australia, and also in him not being picked for the 1995 World Cup squad.

For many years the most capped test All Black was Sean Fitzpatrick, with 92 appearances. He played in the 1987 World Cup after incumbent Andy Dalton was injured, and was appointed All Blacks captain in 1992, continuing in the role until his retirement in 1997. He played 346 first class rugby matches.

Jonah Lomu is generally regarded as the first true global superstar of rugby union. He was the youngest player ever to appear in a test as an All Black, making his debut at age 19 years, 45 days in 1994. Lomu, a wing, had unique physical gifts; even though he stood and weighed , making him both the tallest and heaviest back ever to play for New Zealand, he could run 100 metres in under 11 seconds. He burst on the international scene in the 1995 Rugby World Cup, scoring seven tries in the competition. Four of those tries came in New Zealand&#x27;s semi-final win over England, including an iconic try in which he bulldozed England&#x27;s Mike Catt on his way to the try line. He added eight more tries in the 1999 Rugby World Cup. Perhaps most remarkably, Lomu played virtually his entire top-level career in the shadow of a serious kidney disorder which ended his test career in 2002 and ultimately led to a transplant in 2004. Even with his career hampered and eventually shortened by his health issues, he scored 37 tries in 63 tests.

===Player records===
The record for most test points for not only New Zealand, but any nation, is held by Dan Carter with 1,598 from 112 tests. He surpassed Andrew Mehrtens&#x27; All Black record total of 967 points from 70 tests in the All Blacks&#x27; win over England on 21 November 2009. On 27 November 2010 Dan Carter scored a penalty against Wales to pass Jonny Wilkinson&#x27;s previous world record of 1,178 points. Carter also holds the record for points against Australia with 366.

The All Blacks&#x27; record test try scorer is Doug Howlett with 49 tries, who overtook Christian Cullen&#x27;s 46 during the 2007 World Cup. The world record for tries in a calendar year is held by Joe Rokocoko, with 17 tries in 2003; he also became the first All Black to score ten tries in his first five tests, as well as the first All Black to score at least two tries in each of four consecutive tests. In test matches, the most capped All Black is Sam Whitelock with 153 caps. The record for most tests as captain is held by Richie McCaw with 110. The youngest All Black in a test match was Jonah Lomu, capped at age 19 years, 45 days, whilst the oldest test player was Ned Hughes at 40 years, 123 days.

==Home grounds==

Like other major rugby nations Argentina, Australia, France and South Africa, New Zealand does not have an official stadium for its national team. Instead, the All Blacks play their test matches at a variety of venues throughout New Zealand.

Prior to the construction of Westpac Stadium in 1999, Wellington&#x27;s test venue was Athletic Park, which had served as the venue for the first All Blacks test match in New Zealand against Great Britain in 1904. The first home test match played outside the main centres of Auckland, Christchurch, Dunedin or Wellington was in 1996 at McLean Park in Napier.

Eden Park and Lancaster Park were upgraded in preparation for the 2011 Rugby World Cup. By that time, the NZRU no longer considered Carisbrook a suitable test venue, and a covered sports stadium was proposed as a replacement. Dunedin City Council approved the new stadium in March 2008, land acquisition proceeded from August to October of that year.

<text>Johann Nikolaus Harnoncourt (6 December 1929 – 5 March 2016) was an Austrian conductor, known for his historically informed performances. He specialized in music of the Baroque period, but later extended his repertoire to include Classical and early Romantic works. Among his best known recordings are those of Bach, whose 193 cantatas he recorded with Gustav Leonhardt.

Starting out as a classical cellist, he founded his own period instrument ensemble, Concentus Musicus Wien, in 1953, and became a pioneer of the Early Music movement. Around 1970, Harnoncourt began conducting opera and concert performances, soon leading international symphony orchestras, and appearing at leading concert halls, operatic venues and festivals. In 2001 and 2003, he conducted the Vienna New Year&#x27;s Concert. Harnoncourt was also the author of several books, mostly on subjects of performance history and musical aesthetics.

== Early life ==

Johann Nikolaus Harnoncourt was born as an Austrian citizen in Berlin, Germany, in 1929. His Austrian mother, Ladislaja née Gräfin von Meran, Freiin von Brandhoven, was the great-granddaughter of the Habsburg Archduke Johann, the 13th child of Emperor Leopold II, making him a descendant of Holy Roman Emperors and other European royalty. His father, Eberhard Harnoncourt, born de la Fontaine Graf d&#x27;Harnoncourt-Unverzagt, was an Austrian engineer working in Berlin who had two children from a previous marriage. Two years after Nikolaus&#x27;s birth, his brother Philipp was born, and also in 1931, the family moved to the Styrian capital Graz, Austria, where they took up residence in their ancestral home, Palais Meran. Eberhard obtained a post in the state government (&quot;Landesregierung&quot;) of Styria. 

Harnoncourt was raised in Graz, and studied music in Vienna. During his youth, he served in the Hitler Youth under duress, where, as he noted:
At the Vienna Music Academy, Harnoncourt studied cello with Paul Grümmer and Emanuel Brabec, and also learned viola da gamba.

== Career ==

Harnoncourt was a cellist with the Vienna Symphony from 1952 to 1969. In 1953, he founded the period-instrument ensemble Concentus Musicus Wien with his wife, Alice Hoffelner, whom he married during the year. The Concentus Musicus Wien was dedicated to performances on period instruments. He played the viola da gamba at this time, as well as the cello. For the Telefunken (later Teldec) label, Harnoncourt recorded Baroque repertoire, beginning with the viol music of Henry Purcell, and extending to include works like Bach&#x27;s &quot;The Musical Offering&quot;, Monteverdi&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;incoronazione di Poppea&quot;, and Rameau&#x27;s &quot;Castor et Pollux&quot;. One of his final recordings with the Concentus Musicus Wien was of Beethoven&#x27;s Symphonies Nos. 4 and 5.

One reason that Harnoncourt left the Vienna Symphony was to become a conductor. 
He made a conducting debut at La Scala, Milan, in 1972/ 73 season, leading a production of Monteverdi&#x27;s &quot;Il ritorno d&#x27;Ulisse in patria&quot; at La Piccola Scala.

In 1971, Harnoncourt established a joint project with conductor Gustav Leonhardt to record all of J.S. Bach&#x27;s cantatas. The Teldec Bach cantata project was eventually completed in 1990 and was the only cantata cycle to use an all-male choir and soloist roster, with the exception of cantatas nos. 51 and 199, which were intended for a female soprano voice. He also made the first recordings in historically informed performance of Bach&#x27;s Mass in B minor (1968) and &quot;St Matthew Passion&quot; (1970). In 2001, an acclaimed and Grammy Award winning recording of the &quot;St Matthew Passion&quot; with the Arnold Schoenberg Choir was released, which included the entire score of the piece in Bach&#x27;s own hand on a CD-ROM. This was his third recording of the work.

Harnoncourt later performed with many orchestras performing on modern instruments, but retaining considerations for historical authenticity in terms of tempi and dynamics, among other issues. He also expanded his repertoire, continuing to play the baroque works, but also championing the Viennese operetta repertoire. He made a benchmark recording of Beethoven&#x27;s symphonies with the Chamber Orchestra of Europe (COE), and recorded Beethoven&#x27;s piano concertos with Pierre-Laurent Aimard and the COE.

Harnoncourt was a guest conductor of the Vienna Philharmonic and made several recordings with the orchestra. Between 1987 and 1991, he conducted four new productions of Mozart operas at the Vienna State Opera (1987–91: &quot;Idomeneo&quot;; 1988–90: &quot;Die Zauberflöte&quot;; 1989: &quot;Die Entführung aus dem Serail&quot;; 1989–91: &quot;Così fan tutte&quot;). He directed the Vienna Philharmonic&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Day concerts in 2001 and 2003.

In 1992, Harnoncourt debuted at the Salzburg Festival conducting a concert with the Chamber Orchestra of Europe. In the following years, he led several concerts with the Chamber Orchestra of Europe, the Vienna Philharmonic and the Concentus Musicus. Harnoncourt also served as the conductor for major opera productions of the Festival: &quot;L&#x27;incoronazione di Poppea&quot; (1993), Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Le nozze di Figaro&quot; (1995 and 2006), &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; (2002, marking also Anna Netrebko&#x27;s international breakthrough as Donna Anna, and 2003) and &quot;La clemenza di Tito&quot; (2003 and 2006), and Purcell&#x27;s &quot;King Arthur&quot; (2004). In 2012, Harnoncourt conducted a new production of &quot;Die Zauberflöte&quot; staged by Jens-Daniel Herzog.

Harnoncourt made his guest-conducting debut with the Concertgebouw Orchestra, Amsterdam in 1975. He continued as a guest conductor with the orchestra, including in several opera productions and recordings. In October 2000, the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra (KCO) named him their &quot;Honorair gastdirigent&quot; (Honorary Guest Conductor). His final appearance with the KCO was in October 2013, leading Bruckner&#x27;s Symphony No. 5.

Other recordings outside of the baroque and classical era repertoire included his 2002 recording of Bruckner&#x27;s Symphony No. 9 with the Vienna Philharmonic. An accompanying second CD contained a lecture by Harnoncourt about the symphony with musical examples, including the rarely heard fragments from the unfinished finale. In 2009, Harnoncourt recorded Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;, taken from live performances at Graz. He was a conductor for the Rudolf Buchbinder&#x27;s recording of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart&#x27;s Piano concertos No. 23 &amp; 25.

On 5 December 2015, one day before his 86th birthday, Harnoncourt announced his retirement via his website. &quot;My bodily strength requires me to cancel my future plans,&quot; he wrote in a hand-written letter inserted into the program on his 86th birthday of a concert by the Concentus Musicus Wien.

=== Styriarte ===

Harnoncourt was the focus of the annual festival of classical music Styriarte, founded in 1985 to tie him closer to his hometown, Graz. He programmed the festival for 31 years. Events have been held at different venues in Graz and in the surrounding region.

== Personal life ==

Harnoncourt met his wife Alice through their mutual interest in historically informed performances of Baroque music and co-founded the Concentus Musicus Wien. Their daughter is the mezzo-soprano Elisabeth von Magnus. Their two surviving sons are Philipp and Franz. Their third son Eberhard, a violin maker, died in 1990 in an automobile accident.

Harnoncourt died on 5 March 2016 in the village of Sankt Georgen im Attergau, north east of Salzburg. His widow Alice, their three adult children, seven grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren survived him. Alice died in July 2022.

<text>Saint Joseph&#x27;s Day, also called the Feast of Saint Joseph or the Solemnity of Saint Joseph, is in Western Christianity the principal feast day of Saint Joseph, husband of the Virgin Mary and legal father of Jesus Christ, celebrated on 19 March. It has the rank of a solemnity in the Catholic Church. It is a feast or commemoration in the provinces of the Anglican Communion, and a feast or festival in the Lutheran Church. Saint Joseph&#x27;s Day is the Patronal Feast day for Poland as well as for Canada, persons named Joseph, Josephine, etc., for religious institutes, schools and parishes bearing his name, and for carpenters. It is also Father&#x27;s Day in some Catholic countries, mainly Spain, Portugal, and Italy. It is not a holy day of obligation for Catholics in the United States.

19 March was dedicated to Saint Joseph in several Western calendars by the 10th century, and this custom was established in Rome by 1479. Pope Pius V extended its use to the entire Roman Rite by his Apostolic Constitution &quot;Quo primum&quot; (14 July 1570). Originally a double of the second class and a feast of precept, it was re-raised to be of precept in 1917 after having this status intermittently lost, and consequently also raised to its current rank of double of the first class (now called a solemnity), having become in the meantime the rank common to all remaining general feasts of precept. Since 1969, Episcopal Conferences may, if they wish, transfer it to a date outside Lent. Even if it occurs inside Lent on the usual date of 19 March, it is still observed as a Solemnity of a Saint—this is one of the few times during Lent the Gloria may be said or sung, the vesture is changed from the purple or violet of Lent to white or gold (as it would be for such a solemnity normally), the Collect and the Eucharistic Prayer&#x27;s Preface and other prayers are from the Solemnity and not Lent, the hymns are more joyful, and the Creed is said. However, the Alleluia is still not used, the Tract being used instead, per Lenten regulations.

Between 1870 and 1955, an additional feast was celebrated in honor of Saint Joseph as Spouse of the Blessed Virgin Mary and Patron of the Universal Church, the latter title having been given to him by Pope Pius IX. Originally celebrated on the third Sunday after Easter with an octave, after &quot;Divino Afflatu&quot; of Saint Pius X (see Reform of the Roman Breviary by Pope Pius X), it was moved to the preceding Wednesday (because Wednesday was the day of the week specifically dedicated to St. Joseph, St. John the Baptist and local patrons). The feast was also retitled The Solemnity of Saint Joseph. This celebration and its accompanying octave were abolished during the modernisation and simplification of rubrics under Pope Pius XII in 1955.

At the same time, Pope Pius XII established an additional Feast of &quot;St. Joseph the Worker&quot;, to be celebrated on 1 May, in order to coincide with the celebration of International Workers&#x27; Day (May Day) in many countries. Until this time, 1 May had been the Feast of the Apostles Saint Philip and James, but that Feast was then moved to the next free day, 11 May (and again to 3 May, in 1969, having become free in the meantime). In the new calendar published in 1969, the Feast of Saint Joseph The Worker, which at one time occupied the highest possible rank in the Church calendar, was reduced to an optional Memorial, the lowest rank for a saint&#x27;s day.

The Eastern Orthodox Church celebrates Saint Joseph on the Sunday after Christmas (with David and James the Just), 26 December (Synaxis of the Mother of God and flight of the Holy Family into Egypt) on the Sunday of the Holy Forefathers (two Sundays before the Nativity) and on the Sunday of the Holy Fathers (Sunday before the Nativity), when he is commemorated together with other ancestors of Jesus and on 19 March.

Popular customs among Christians of various liturgical traditions observing Saint Joseph&#x27;s Day are attending Mass or the Divine Service, wearing red-coloured clothing, carrying dried fava beans that have been blessed, and assembling home altars dedicated to Saint Joseph.

==Christian traditions==
March 19 always falls during Lent, a season traditionally marked by fast and abstinence. Saint Joseph&#x27;s day, however, is a solemnity and per the 1983 Code of Canon Law overrides Friday obligations in the Catholic Church. Previously, per the 1917 Code of Canon Law, the obligation of fasting and abstinence was not dispensed on St. Joseph&#x27;s Day even where it was kept as a Holy Day of Obligation: &quot;On [Sundays] or feasts of precept, the law of abstinence or of abstinence and fast or of fast only ceases, except during Lent, nor is the vigil anticipated; likewise it ceases on Holy [Saturday] afternoon&quot; (1917 Code, Canon 1252 § 4).

If the feast day falls on a Sunday other than Palm Sunday, it is observed on the next available day, usually Monday, 20 March, unless another solemnity (e.g., a church&#x27;s patronal saint) falls on that day. Since 2008, if Saint Joseph&#x27;s Day falls during Holy Week, it is moved to the closest possible day &quot;before&quot; 19 March, usually the Saturday before Holy Week. This change was announced by the Congregation for Divine Worship in &quot;Notitiae&quot; in order to avoid occurrences of the feasts of Saint Joseph and the Annunciation both being moved to just after the Easter octave. This decision does not apply to those using the 1962 Missal according to the provisions of &quot;Summorum Pontificum&quot;; when that missal is used, its particular rubrics, which require the feast to be transferred to the next available date &quot;after&quot; 19 March, must be observed. In practice, the 1962 rubrics lead to the observance of St. Joseph&#x27;s Day on the Tuesday following the Second Sunday of Easter, as the Feast of the Annunciation (which must also be transferred in years when its assigned date, 25 March, falls during either Holy Week or the octave of Easter) is observed on the Monday after the Second Sunday of Easter.

===Italy and San Marino===

In Italy, 19 March is also celebrated as Father&#x27;s Day. In the historical region of Romagna, including the independent Republic of San Marino, bonfires known as the are lit on the eve of Saint Joseph&#x27;s Day; the bonfires are especially popular in Rimini, where they extend the length of the city&#x27;s coastal conurbation from Cattolica to Cesenatico. Bonfires are traditionally lit for Saint Joseph&#x27;s Day in several other places in Italy outside Romagna, such as in Bobbio, Emilia-Romagna, in Matera, Basilicata; in the Val Trebbia, and in Serracapriola, Apulia. are traditionally fried on the bonfires in Itri, Lazio.

In Calabria, , a pasta dish containing chickpeas, is shared among families and neighbours on Saint Joseph&#x27;s Day. The custom, which is known as , may have emerged in the 20th century, or have origins in Calabria&#x27;s medieval feudal society. Rich families invited poorer people from their neighbourhood for a feast at their house. Some of the guests would dress as the Holy Family, sometimes extended to include Joachim and Anne, Mary&#x27;s parents. The hostess would kiss guests&#x27; hands in an act of reverence. was served as the first dish, followed by pan-fried cod and , the dessert typically associated with Saint Joseph in Calabria. After the meal, guests would be given leftovers to take home to their relatives. notably suspended class structures in Calabria, which was particularly afflicted by poverty and hunger, and was a symbol of social solidarity and fraternity.

==== Sicily ====
In Sicily and in many Italian-American communities, giving food to the needy is a Saint Joseph&#x27;s Day custom. In some communities it is traditional to wear red clothing and eat . A traditional Sicilian dish especially associated with Saint Joseph&#x27;s Day is &quot;Maccu di San Giuseppe&quot;, which consists of maccu and various ingredients.

One prominent custom is the Saint Joseph&#x27;s Day altar, which are elaborately decorated with figurines, medals, and votive candles. The altar is divided into three tiers, representing the three persons of the Trinity, with a statue of Joseph at its head. The tables are dressed with food, which are donated to the poor on the solemnity. On the altar, people place flowers, limes, candles, wine, fava beans, specially prepared cakes, breads, and cookies (as well as other meatless dishes), and . Foods are traditionally served containing bread crumbs to represent sawdust since Joseph was a carpenter. Because the feast occurs during Lent, traditionally no meat was allowed on the celebration table.

According to legend, Saint Joseph interceded to relieve a famine in Sicily during the Middle Ages. There was a severe drought at the time, and the people prayed for their patron saint to bring them rain. They promised that if God answered their prayers through Joseph&#x27;s intercession, they would prepare a large feast to honor him. The rain did come, and the people of Sicily prepared a large banquet for their patron saint. The fava bean was the crop which saved the population from starvation and is a traditional part of Saint Joseph&#x27;s Day altars and traditions. On the Sicilian island of Lipari, a variant of the legend says that sailors returning from the mainland encountered a fierce storm that threatened to sink their boat. They prayed to Saint Joseph for deliverance, and when they were saved, they swore to honor the saint each year on his feast day.

In Bagheria, Saint Joseph is even celebrated twice a year, the second time being held especially for people from Bagheria who come back for summer vacation from other parts of Italy or abroad.

===Malta===
In Malta, the set date for the celebration of Saint Joseph is 19 March, but can be moved if necessary to fit into the Lent and Easter season. This has been a day of remembrance in Malta since the 10th century A.D. Most businesses shut down for this day for all the celebrations that occur. The main celebrations are held in Mdina, which is the &quot;old capital&quot; of Malta in the suburbs of the city of Rabat. There are three main events that occur for this day. One of them being special masses in honor of Saint Joseph. Then it follows with colorful processions with music bands in the streets and fireworks at night. The main procession takes place in the evening with the statue of Saint Joseph being carried to the church of Saint Mary of Jesus. The statue represents a high level of workmanship for the figure Joseph had in Jesus&#x27; life. Also, this is one of the public holidays in Malta, known as Jum San Ġużepp. People celebrate mass in the morning, and in the afternoon go for a picnic. It is a liturgical feast that occurs on a Sunday in summer. However, the city of Rabat celebrates the traditional Maltese feast where in the evening a procession is also held with the statue of Saint Joseph. On this day also the city of Żejtun celebrates the day, known as Jum il-Kunsill (Zejtun Council&#x27;s Day), till 2013 was known as Jum iż-Żejtun (Zejtun&#x27;s Day). During this day a prominent person from Żejtun is given the Żejtun Honour (Ġieħ iż-Żejtun). In the past years the Żejtun Parish Church has celebrated these feast days with a procession with the statue of Saint Joseph.

===Spain===

In Spain, Saint Joseph&#x27;s Day is their version of Father&#x27;s Day, which is called &quot;El Dia del Padre&quot;. In some parts of Spain it is celebrated as Falles. They feel that Saint Joseph is a good example of what a father figure should be like, which is why they connect these two days. Since Spain does correlate this day with Father&#x27;s Day, it is tradition for children to cook their fathers breakfast or even give small gifts. It is a &quot;meatless affair&quot;, because it occurs during the Lenten season. Some symbols to represent this day include Jesus holding carpenter tools, baby Jesus, and a staff with lilies. A few things to do on this day to celebrate are attending a special church service, visiting different cathedrals, joining Valencia&#x27;s Falla Festival, and exploring the city, museums and art galleries. The Falla Festival runs for 5 days and ends on 19 March in remembrance of Saint Joseph.

===Poland===
To represent and honor Saint Joseph, Poland has hymns they made. A few of the hymns are &quot;Duszo moja&quot;, &quot;O Jozefie Ukochany&quot;, and &quot;Szczesliwy, Kto Sobie Patrona&quot;. Attitudes differ on whether meat can be eaten during the day; in some quarters, meatless food is to be eaten because it is Lent season, while in others the ranking of the feast as a solemnity means that there is no need to abstain from meat even when the feast falls on a Friday.

===Philippines===
In the Philippines, especially in rice producing provinces like Iloilo, some families maintain the ritual of holding a banquet for the Holy Family. An old man, a young lady, and a small boy, often chosen from among the poor, are honoured as representations of Saint Joseph, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and the Child Jesus, respectively. The three, sometimes dressed like the &quot;santo&quot; (traditional saint image) they each represent, are seated around a table set with the family&#x27;s best silverware and china, and served a variety of courses. Hymns are sung while they are literally spoonfed by senior members of the host family and important guests. The Novena to Saint Joseph is also recited at a nearby temporary altar. The hosts and other participants then seek blessings from the &quot;Holy Family&quot; by paying obeisance to the three individuals (or images of the holy personages they represent), either through kissing icons in the hands of the trio or performing &quot;mano&quot;, all while genuflecting before them. The now-fed &quot;Holy Family&quot; are lastly given donations (monetary or in kind), which they split amongst themselves, as a thank-you gift after the ceremony.

===United States===

In New Orleans, Louisiana, which was a major port of entry for Sicilian immigrants during the late 19th century, the Feast of Saint Joseph is a citywide event. Both public and private Saint Joseph&#x27;s altars are traditionally built, especially in and around the Lake Vista neighborhood. The altars are usually open to any visitor who wishes to pay homage. The food is generally distributed to charity after the altar is dismantled.

There are also parades in honor of Saint Joseph and the Italian population of New Orleans which are similar to the many marching clubs and truck parades of Mardi Gras and Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day. Tradition in New Orleans also holds that by burying a small statue of Saint Joseph upside down in the front yard of a house, that house will sell more promptly. In addition to the above traditions, some groups of Mardi Gras Indians stage their last procession of the season on the Sunday nearest to Saint Joseph&#x27;s Day otherwise known as &quot;Super Sunday,&quot; after which their costumes are dismantled.

Saint Joseph&#x27;s Day is also celebrated in other American communities with high proportions of Italians such as New York City; Utica, NY; Syracuse, NY; Niagara Falls, NY; Rochester, NY; Buffalo, NY; Hawthorne, NJ; Hoboken, NJ; Jersey City, NJ; Kansas City, MO; Chicago, IL Gloucester, Mass.; Hartford, Connecticut; and Providence, Rhode Island, where observance (which takes place just after Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day) often is expressed through &quot;the wearing of the red&quot;, i.e., wearing red clothing or accessories similar to the wearing of green on Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day. Saint Joseph&#x27;s Day tables may also be found in Rockford and Elmwood Park, Illinois.

Americans of Polish ancestry, especially those in the Midwest and New England, who have the name Joseph celebrate Saint Joseph&#x27;s Day (Dzien Swietego Jozefa) as an &quot;imieniny&quot;. As a symbol of ethnic pride, and in solidarity with their Italian counterparts, Polish Catholic parishes often hold Saint Joseph&#x27;s Day feasts known as Saint Joseph&#x27;s Tables or Saint Joseph&#x27;s altars, and display statues and holy cards of Saint Joseph. As the day falls during Lent, these are meatless feasts.

Saint Joseph&#x27;s Day is also the day when the swallows are traditionally believed to return to Mission San Juan Capistrano after having flown south for the winter.

===Canada===
Saint Joseph is the patron saint of Canada. Saint Joseph&#x27;s Oratory in Montreal hosts a novena and special masses to celebrate the feast of Saint Joseph. These events draw thousands of pilgrims to the basilica.

=== England ===
Joseph of Nazareth is remembered in the Church of England with a Festival on 19 March.

<text>Andre Williams, better known as Shy FX, is a British DJ and producer from London. He specialises in drum and bass and jungle music.

==Biography==
Shy FX&#x27;s debut record was &quot;Jungle Love&quot;, released in 1992 on the Permission to Dance label. Soon after, he signed to Sound of the Underground Records (often abbreviated as S.O.U.R.) and in 1994 released the breakthrough ragga jungle track &quot;Original Nuttah&quot; (featuring vocals from MC UK Apachi) which helped to cement his position as a mainstay producer of the jungle/drum &amp; bass scene.

Throughout his career, he has collaborated with T Power, both as Ebony Dubsters and Shy FX and T Power; their 2001 breakthrough track &quot;Shake Ur Body&quot; with vocalist Di (real name Dianne Joseph) was a number 7 hit in the UK Singles Chart. Released on EMI subsidiary Positiva, it gained widespread support from both club and commercial radio DJs and helped to further popularise drum &amp; bass as a mainstream music genre.

The success of &quot;Shake Ur Body&quot; was followed by the duo&#x27;s album &quot;Set It Off&quot;, released in 2002 on Pete Tong&#x27;s label FFRR. Several EPs and single releases followed; by 2005, Shy FX had made the decision to consolidate his releases onto his own label and founded Digital Soundboy Recordings. In collaboration with T Power, they subsequently released the album &quot;Diary of a Digital Sound Boy&quot; on 17 October 2005, featuring the songs &quot;Feelings&quot;, &quot;On the Run&quot; and &quot;Plastic Soul&quot;. Shy FX and T Power also released &quot;Don&#x27;t Wanna Know&quot; featuring Di and MC Skibadee. The song was notably used on the UK television programme &quot;Soccer AM&quot; as part of the &#x27;Skills Skool&#x27; feature.

Shy FX produced &quot;Da Feelin&quot; for Dizzee Rascal&#x27;s 2007 album, &quot;Maths + English&quot;. He also produced &quot;Can&#x27;t Tek No More&quot; on Dizzee Rascal&#x27;s 2009 album, &quot;Tongue N&#x27; Cheek&quot;. His remix of Naughty Boy, Wiley and Emeli Sandé&#x27;s song &quot;Never Be Your Woman&quot; was released as the single rather than the original mix. Shy&#x27;s remix charted at number eight on the UK Singles Chart. He remixed &quot;She Said&quot;, a number 3 UK chart single by Plan B. His remix was released on both the &quot;She Said&quot; single and on the deluxe edition of Plan B&#x27;s &quot;The Defamation of Strickland Banks&quot;.

More recently, he produced &quot;Raver&quot; featuring Kano, Donae&#x27;o and Roses Gabor, plus the UK artist Yasmin&#x27;s first single, &quot;On My Own&quot;. He announced that his album, &quot;Larger Than Life&quot;, was originally scheduled for a 2011 release but has since been renamed &quot;Cornerstone&quot; but did not have a fixed release date.

Williams also produced Yasmin&#x27;s third single &quot;Light Up (The World)&quot;, which features Ms. Dynamite. It peaked at No. 50 in the UK Singles Chart.

DJ Fresh&#x27;s single &quot;Gold Dust&quot; was re-released, with the Shy FX Re-Edit as a single, on 2 December 2012. The extended play includes multiple new remixes.

In 2013, he released a single called &quot;Soon Come&quot; featuring Liam Bailey, famous for his collaboration with Chase &amp; Status on their track &quot;Blind Faith&quot;. The song reached number 55 in the UK Singles Chart. He also released the single &quot;Cloud 9&quot; in 2013, a collaboration with Ms. Dynamite.

In August 2014, Shy FX remixed the title track from London Grammar&#x27;s debut album, &quot;If You Wait&quot;.

For 2014&#x27;s Red Bull Culture Clash, Shy FX joined forces with Chase &amp; Status, David Rodigan and MC Rage to form the soundsystem &#x27;Rebel Sound&#x27;. They went on to win the clash, defeating fellow crews Stone Love, Boy Better Know and A$AP Mob.

==Digital Soundboy label==
Williams and T Power (Marc Royal) started the Digital Soundboy label in 2005, initially releasing their own material but quickly expanding to include the artists Visionary, Benny Page and Breakage. The label subsequently grew its genre coverage to the point where its discography includes electro, drum and bass, jungle, dubstep, house and UK funky releases from dozens of artists. All releases are observable as being in Digital Soundboy&#x27;s &quot;house style&quot;, as is the case with most drum and bass and dubstep labels.

Noted dubstep producers Skream, Benga and Caspa have all released tracks on DSB, as have drum and bass and dubstep crossover artists Breakage, Calibre, DJ Fresh and Redlight (a.k.a. DJ Clipz).

The label ended in December 2015.

<text>In group theory, a dicyclic group (notation Dic&quot;n&quot; or Q4&quot;n&quot;, ) is a particular kind of non-abelian group of order 4&quot;n&quot; (&quot;n&quot; &gt; 1). It is an extension of the cyclic group of order 2 by a cyclic group of order 2&quot;n&quot;, giving the name &quot;di-cyclic&quot;. In the notation of exact sequences of groups, this extension can be expressed as:

:formula_1

More generally, given any finite abelian group with an order-2 element, one can define a dicyclic group.

==Definition==

For each integer &quot;n&quot; &gt; 1, the dicyclic group Dic&quot;n&quot; can be defined as the subgroup of the unit quaternions generated by

:formula_2

More abstractly, one can define the dicyclic group Dic&quot;n&quot; as the group with the following presentation

:formula_3

Some things to note which follow from this definition:
*formula_4
*formula_5
*if formula_6, then formula_7
*formula_8

Thus, every element of Dic&quot;n&quot; can be uniquely written as , where 0 ≤ &quot;m&quot; &lt; 2&quot;n&quot; and &quot;l&quot; = 0 or 1. The multiplication rules are given by
*formula_9
*formula_10
*formula_11
*formula_12
It follows that Dic&quot;n&quot; has order 4&quot;n&quot;.

When &quot;n&quot; = 2, the dicyclic group is isomorphic to the quaternion group &quot;Q&quot;. More generally, when &quot;n&quot; is a power of 2, the dicyclic group is isomorphic to the generalized quaternion group.

==Properties==

For each &quot;n&quot; &gt; 1, the dicyclic group Dic&quot;n&quot; is a non-abelian group of order 4&quot;n&quot;. (For the degenerate case &quot;n&quot; = 1, the group Dic1 is the cyclic group &quot;C&quot;4, which is not considered dicyclic.)

Let &quot;A&quot; = be the subgroup of Dic&quot;n&quot; generated by &quot;a&quot;. Then &quot;A&quot; is a cyclic group of order 2&quot;n&quot;, so [Dic&quot;n&quot;:&quot;A&quot;] = 2. As a subgroup of index 2 it is automatically a normal subgroup. The quotient group Dic&quot;n&quot;/&quot;A&quot; is a cyclic group of order 2.

Dic&quot;n&quot; is solvable; note that &quot;A&quot; is normal, and being abelian, is itself solvable.

==Binary dihedral group==
The dicyclic group is a binary polyhedral group — it is one of the classes of subgroups of the Pin group Pin−(2), which is a subgroup of the Spin group Spin(3) — and in this context is known as the binary dihedral group.

The connection with the binary cyclic group &quot;C&quot;2&quot;n&quot;, the cyclic group &quot;C&quot;&quot;n&quot;, and the dihedral group Dih&quot;n&quot; of order 2&quot;n&quot; is illustrated in the diagram at right, and parallels the corresponding diagram for the Pin group. Coxeter writes the &quot;binary dihedral group&quot; as ⟨2,2,&quot;n&quot;⟩ and &quot;binary cyclic group&quot; with angle-brackets, ⟨&quot;n&quot;⟩.

There is a superficial resemblance between the dicyclic groups and dihedral groups; both are a sort of &quot;mirroring&quot; of an underlying cyclic group. But the presentation of a dihedral group would have &quot;x&quot;2 = 1, instead of &quot;x&quot;2 = &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;; and this yields a different structure. In particular, Dic&quot;n&quot; is not a semidirect product of &quot;A&quot; and , since &quot;A&quot; ∩  is not trivial.

The dicyclic group has a unique involution (i.e. an element of order 2), namely &quot;x&quot;2 = &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;. Note that this element lies in the center of Dic&quot;n&quot;. Indeed, the center consists solely of the identity element and &quot;x&quot;2. If we add the relation &quot;x&quot;2 = 1 to the presentation of Dic&quot;n&quot; one obtains a presentation of the dihedral group Dih&quot;n&quot;, so the quotient group Dic&quot;n&quot;/&lt;&quot;x&quot;2&gt; is isomorphic to Dih&quot;n&quot;.

There is a natural 2-to-1 homomorphism from the group of unit quaternions to the 3-dimensional rotation group described at quaternions and spatial rotations. Since the dicyclic group can be embedded inside the unit quaternions one can ask what the image of it is under this homomorphism. The answer is just the dihedral symmetry group Dih&quot;n&quot;. For this reason the dicyclic group is also known as the binary dihedral group. Note that the dicyclic group does not contain any subgroup isomorphic to Dih&quot;n&quot;.

The analogous pre-image construction, using Pin+(2) instead of Pin−(2), yields another dihedral group, Dih2&quot;n&quot;, rather than a dicyclic group.

==Generalizations==

Let &quot;A&quot; be an abelian group, having a specific element &quot;y&quot; in &quot;A&quot; with order 2. A group &quot;G&quot; is called a generalized dicyclic group, written as Dic(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;y&quot;), if it is generated by &quot;A&quot; and an additional element &quot;x&quot;, and in addition we have that [&quot;G&quot;:&quot;A&quot;] = 2, &quot;x&quot;2 = &quot;y&quot;, and for all &quot;a&quot; in &quot;A&quot;, &quot;x&quot;−1&quot;ax&quot; = &quot;a&quot;−1.

Since for a cyclic group of even order, there is always a unique element of order 2, we can see that dicyclic groups are just a specific type of generalized dicyclic group.

The dicyclic group is the case formula_13 of the family of binary triangle groups formula_14 defined by the presentation:formula_15Taking the quotient by the additional relation formula_16 produces an ordinary triangle group, which in this case is the dihedral quotient formula_17.

<text>Ripon College is a private liberal arts college in Ripon, Wisconsin, United States. As of 2024, the college enrolled around 754 undergraduate students. Nearly 80% of students were Wisconsin residents.

==History==

Ripon College was founded in 1851, although its first class of students did not enroll until 1853. It was first known as Brockway College, named for William S. Brockway, who gave the most, $25, in a fundraising effort.

Ripon&#x27;s first class, four women, graduated in 1867. The college was founded with ties to local churches, but early in its history the institution became secular. In 1868 formal ties with Presbyterian and Congregational churches were cut, but Ripon would retain some ties to its religious past. During the nineteenth century, students were required to attend two church services each Sunday. The first six presidents of Ripon College had clerical backgrounds. Today students are not required to attend religious services.

The National Forensic League was founded at the college in 1925.

==Academics==

Students may choose from 31 majors, a variety of pre-professional advising options and also opt to self-design a major. Off-campus study is highly encouraged; nearly one-third of all Ripon College students elect to spend a semester off-campus on a focused area of study. Ripon has a student-to-faculty ratio of 14:1.

===Catalyst Curriculum===
Students take five Catalyst courses that focus on solving real-world problems. The Catalyst curriculum consists of five seminars spread over three years. After completing the Catalyst curriculum, students receive a certificate in Applied Innovation. Ripon College provides a four-year graduation guarantee to all students who remain in good academic standing, declare a major course of study by the end of sophomore year, and follow an approved course plan.

===Center for Politics and the People===

The Center for Politics and the People was established in spring 2014. The center sponsors scholarship and hosts special events featuring elected officials and policy makers, high-level campaign operatives, academic experts, journalists, prognosticators and citizens representing a spectrum of political views. The center also manages the college&#x27;s annual Career Discovery Tour to Washington, D.C., and helps place students in internships.

=== Center for Career and Professional Development ===
The Center for Career and Professional Development offers resources to students such as workshops, employer visits, job fairs, and assistance with writing a resume. It also helps organize the annual Career Discovery Tour.

=== Summer Opportunity for Advanced Research (SOAR) ===
SOAR is a program offered to students of various disciplines to research alongside professors over the summer while living on campus and partaking in volunteer projects around the local community. It was first offered in summer 2021.

===Badger Boys State===
From 1941 to 2019, the college served as the host site for Badger Boys State, a summer leadership and citizenship program for more than 800 Wisconsin high school juniors that focuses on exploring the mechanics of American government and politics.

=== Masters of Exercise Science ===
The only graduate program offered at the college is a master&#x27;s degree in exercise science, with concentrations in exercise physiology, sport psychology, and sport management. The program was launched in 2024.

==Arts==
The college&#x27;s C.J. Rodman Center for the Arts houses the Departments of Art, Music, and Theater.

===Visual art===
The Art Department manages two gallery spaces, one of which is dedicated to student work and the other to art more broadly. Work by students and professional artists is also shown across campus. A sculpture garden is located adjacent to the building. Two art works of note in the permanent collection of the college are life-size portraits by Anthony van Dyck of Princess Amalia of the House of Orange and Sir Roger Townshend. The Classics department also manages a collection of classical Greek and Roman artifacts, many of which are displayed in the campus library.

===Music===
The college has a music department which offers classes, lessons, and ensembles. Students of any major may participate in the music department and are eligible for music scholarships. The department offers the following ensembles: Orchestra, Symphonic Wind Ensemble, Rally Band, Jazz Ensemble, and three choirs (Chamber Singers, Choral Union, and Concert Choir). All musical ensembles, with the exception of Chamber Singers, are open to students, faculty and staff, and community members to join without auditioning. All musical performances by campus groups are free to students and the public. The program also hosts visiting musicians each semester, and performances are free to all students.

===Theater===
The college&#x27;s theater program produces three productions per year, with students from any major encouraged to act or be involved with set, costume, and makeup design. Each theater major directs a one-act production their senior year, as part of a campus theater festival. Students regularly participate in the Region III Kennedy Center American College Theatre Festival. All theatrical events are free to students and the public.

==Sustainability and the environment==
===Sustainability initiatives===
Ripon College attempts to be a sustainable institution. It has a fleet of campus hybrid vehicles, a recycling program, and uses energy efficient light bulbs.

===Ceresco Prairie Conservancy===
The college is home to the Ceresco Prairie Conservancy, consisting of of native prairie, oak savanna, and wetland habitat in the making. The Ceresco Prairie Conservancy is used by different classes in a number of different disciplines. Trails for walking and snowshoeing throughout this area connect to a municipally run older growth woods nature park, the South Woods, which consists of 55 acres (22.26 ha).

=== Environmental activism by students and faculty ===

A student group, EGOR: The Environmental Group of Ripon, focuses on awareness of environmental issues and contributes to the restoration and preservation of the prairie.

=== Environmental Studies major ===

Students can also major in environmental studies, which is an interdisciplinary program.

==Media==
* &quot;College Days&quot; – a monthly newspaper, published both in print and digitally
* WRPN-FM – a campus radio station with digital broadcasts
* RCTV – a television production group (defunct as of Fall 2022)
* &quot;Parallax&quot; – a literary magazine
* &quot;Crimson&quot; – yearbook that was formerly distributed every spring. The last issue was published in the spring of 2017.

==Student life==

===Clubs===
There are over 60 student clubs on campus, including special interest groups, diversity-based groups, political groups, Greek organizations, and academic honor societies. There is also a Student Senate, a student government that is open to all students to discuss issues and vote on different matters.

===Greek life===

The college has several sorority chapters and fraternities. All of the Greek chapters live in dorms. The only exception, local fraternity Phi Kappa Pi, also known as the Merrimen, had its own house from 1939 until it was razed in 2021.

===Diversity===
People of color compose 16.9% of the student population. The McNair Scholars program supports first generation college students and African American, Native American, and Hispanic students who wish to attend graduate school. The Center for Diversity and Inclusion (CDI), inaugurated in 2015, is a space on campus that centers diversity, including programming such as multicultural events. Student groups that focus on the experiences of racially diverse, culturally diverse, and LGBT students are also active on campus, and are part of a wider Diversity Coalition through the CDI.

===Athletics===

Ripon athletics teams participate in NCAA Division III as part of the Midwest Conference. Conference competition for men includes: cross-country, football, soccer (fall), basketball (winter), swimming (winter), indoor and outdoor track, baseball, and tennis (spring). Conference competition for women includes: cross-country, soccer, tennis, volleyball (fall), basketball (winter), Esports (Fall &amp; Spring) swimming (winter), indoor and outdoor track, and softball (spring).

==Campus facilities==

===Education buildings and offices===
The Ripon College Historic District is on the National Register of Historic Places.

=== Athletic facilities ===
The College&#x27;s athletic facility, the Willmore Center, opened in August 2017. It is a total of 165,000 sq ft. (15329 sq m.). It is open to both community members and members of the College.

Hopp Stadium, the on-campus sports stadium, was opened in fall 2023. The previous sports stadium, Ingalls Field, was not located on campus, and was shared by both Ripon High School and Ripon College.

==Recognition==
For 2023, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked the school tied at #136 in National Liberal Arts Colleges and tied at #38 in Top Performers on Social Mobility. In 2017, it was named #3 on a list of &quot;Best Bang for the Buck Midwest Colleges&quot; by Washington Monthly. In 2024, The Princeton Review listed it as one of the &quot;Best Midwestern Colleges&quot; and as one of &quot;The Best 389 Colleges&quot;, along with being ranked #19 on a list of colleges with &quot;Lots of Greek Life&quot;.

<text>Rocco Francis Marchegiano (September 1, 1923 – August 31, 1969; ), better known as Rocky Marciano (, ), was an American professional boxer who competed from 1947 to 1955. He held the world heavyweight championship from 1952 to 1956, and remains the only heavyweight champion to finish his career undefeated. His six title defenses were against Jersey Joe Walcott (from whom he had taken the title), Roland La Starza, Ezzard Charles (twice), Don Cockell and Archie Moore.

Known for his relentless fighting style, formidable punching power, stamina, and exceptionally durable chin, Marciano is considered one of the greatest heavyweight boxers of all time. Marciano remains the only fighter to have stopped every opponent he ever faced for the world heavyweight title, and shares, with Joe Louis, the highest knockout-to-win percentage in world heavyweight title fights at 85.71%. His career knockout-to-win percentage of 87.8% remains one of the highest in heavyweight boxing history. Marciano is ranked #14 in &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 100 greatest punchers of all time. 
==Early life==
Born Rocco Francis Marchegiano on September 1, 1923, Rocky was raised on the south side of Brockton, Massachusetts. His parents, Pierino Marchegiano and Pasqualina Picciuto, were both immigrants from Italy. His father was from Ripa Teatina, Abruzzo, while his mother was from San Bartolomeo in Galdo, Campania. Marciano had two brothers, Louis (aka Sonny) and Peter, and three sisters, Alice, Concetta and Elizabeth. When he was about 18 months old, Marciano contracted pneumonia, from which he almost died.In his youth, he worked out on homemade weightlifting equipment (later in his life, Marciano was also a client of Charles Atlas) and used a stuffed mailbag that hung from a tree in his back yard as a heavy bag. He attended Brockton High School, where he played both baseball and football. However, he was cut from the school baseball team because he had joined a church league, violating a school rule forbidding players from joining other teams. He dropped out of school after finishing tenth grade.

Marciano then worked as a chute man on delivery trucks for the Brockton Ice and Coal Company. He also worked as a ditchdigger, railroad layer and shoemaker. He was a resident of Hanson, Massachusetts; the house he lived in still stands on Main Street.

During the Second World War, Marciano was drafted into the US Army in March 1943, serving for three years. Stationed in Swansea, Wales, he helped ferry supplies across the English Channel to Normandy. After the war ended, he completed his service in March 1946 at Fort Lewis, Washington.

==Amateur career==
Marciano&#x27;s amateur record was 8–4. While awaiting discharge, Marciano represented the Army and won the 1946 Amateur Armed Forces boxing tournament. His amateur career was briefly interrupted on March 17, 1947, when Marciano stepped into the ring as a professional competitor at the Valley Arena Gardens of Holyoke, Massachusetts, being billed as &quot;Rocky Mackianno of Westover Field&quot;. That night, he knocked out local fighter Lee Epperson in three rounds. In an unusual move, Marciano returned to the amateur ranks and fought in the Golden Gloves All-East Championship Tournament in March 1948. He was controversially beaten by Coley Wallace. He continued to fight as an amateur throughout the spring and competed in the AAU Olympic tryouts in the Boston Garden. There, he knocked out George McInnis, but hurt his hands during the bout and was forced to withdraw from the tournament. That was his last amateur bout.

In late March 1947, Marciano and several friends traveled to Fayetteville, North Carolina, to try out for the Fayetteville Cubs, a farm team for the Chicago Cubs baseball team. Marciano lasted three weeks before being cut. After failing to find a spot on another team, he returned to Brockton and began boxing training with longtime friend Allie Colombo. Al Weill and Chick Wergeles served as his managers and Charley Goldman as his trainer and teacher.

==Professional career==
Although he had one professional fight (against Lee Epperson) on his record, Marciano began fighting permanently as a professional boxer on July 12, 1948. That night, he notched a win over Harry Bilazarian (3–6–0). He won his first 16 bouts by knockout, all before the fifth round and nine before the first round was over. Don Mogard (17–9–1) became the first boxer to last the distance (full 10 rounds scheduled) with &quot;The Rock&quot;, but Marciano won by unanimous decision.

Early in his career, he changed the spelling of his last name, &quot;Marchegiano&quot;. The ring announcer in Providence, Rhode Island, could not pronounce it, so Marciano&#x27;s handler, Al Weill, suggested they create a pseudonym. The first suggestion was Rocky Mack, which Marciano rejected, deciding to go with the more Italian-sounding &quot;Marciano&quot;.

Marciano won three more fights by knockout, and then he met Ted Lowry (58–48–9). Marciano kept his winning streak alive, beating Lowry by unanimous decision. Four more knockout wins then followed, including a five-rounder on December 19, 1949, with Phil Muscato (56–20–0), an experienced heavyweight from Buffalo, New York, being the first &quot;name fighter&quot; Marciano faced.

=== Marciano vs Vingo ===
Three weeks after the Phil Muscato fight, Marciano defeated Carmine Vingo (16–1–0) by a sixth-round knockout in New York. Carmine was a promising prospect who was 16–1, with his loss controversial. Marciano was 24–0 at the time of the fight. The winner would be declared the white hope in the division. Rocky Marciano dropped Vingo in the first and second round, but by the fifth Vingo was gaining momentum. At 1:46 in the sixth round Marciano knocked out Vingo with a right uppercut. Vingo was unconscious and taken to the hospital on a stretcher, as there were no ambulances available. As Vingo was given 50/50 survival odds, a priest administered last rites; however, Vingo pulled through and survived, befriending Marciano later on in life.

===Marciano vs. Roland La Starza===

On March 24, 1950, Marciano fought Roland La Starza, winning by split decision. La Starza may have come closer than any other boxer to defeating Marciano as a professional. The scoring for the bout was 5–4, 4–5, and 5–5. Marciano won on a supplemental point system used by New York and Massachusetts at that time. The scoring system did not award an extra point for a knockdown and Marciano scored a knockdown in the fight. Referee Watson decided the bout, scoring it for Marciano. Both boxers were undefeated before the fight, with La Starza&#x27;s record at 37–0.

===Subsequent bouts===
Marciano scored three more knockouts in a row before a rematch with Lowry (61–56–10), Marciano again winning by unanimous decision. After that, he scored four more knockouts and, after a decision over Red Applegate (11–14–2) in late April 1951, he was showcased on national television for the first time, knocking out Rex Layne (34–1–2) in six rounds on July 12, 1951.

On October 27, 1951, the 28-year-old Marciano took on the great Joe Louis. Despite Louis being well past his prime, Marciano was a 6½-to-5 underdog. Marciano knocked Louis out in the eighth round, sending the former champion collapsing out of the ring in what would be his final fight.

After four more wins in 1952, including knockout victories over former European heavyweight champion Lee Savold (96–37–3) and top contender Harry Matthews (81–3–5), Marciano received a shot at the world title later that year.

===Championship fights===

Marciano, 29, faced the World Heavyweight Champion, Jersey Joe Walcott, in Philadelphia on September 23, 1952. Walcott dropped Marciano in the first round and steadily built a points lead. In the 13th, Walcott used his trademark feint to set up his right hand, but Marciano&#x27;s &quot;Suzie Q&quot; landed first, a powerful right hook causing Walcott to slump to his knees with his arm draped over the ropes. He lay motionless long after he had been counted out and Marciano became the new World Heavyweight Champion. At the time of the stoppage, Walcott was leading on all scorecards, 8–4, 7–5, and 7–4.

His first defense came the following year in May – a rematch against Walcott, now 39, who this time was knocked out in the first round.

His next defense was held five months later, in what would be a rematch with his old rival, Roland La Starza. After building a small lead on the judges&#x27; scorecards all the way through the middle rounds, Marciano eventually gained the upper hand and won the fight by a technical knockout in the 11th round.Then Marciano fought two consecutive bouts against former World Heavyweight Champion and light heavyweight legend Ezzard Charles, who became the only man to ever last a full 15 rounds against Marciano. Marciano won the first fight, held at Yankee Stadium on June 17, 1954, on points. Referee Ruby Goldstein scored the bout 8–5–2 in rounds for the champion. Judge Artie Aidala scored it 9–5–1 for Marciano while judge Harold Barnes had it 8–6–1. Marciano gave Charles a rematch, and the much anticipated fight was held four months later at the same venue. Marciano controlled most of the action during the fight, but was cut badly on the nose at the end of the sixth round. Unable to get the bleeding to stop, and fearing a possible stoppage by the fight doctor, Marciano went in for the finish, and soon succeeded, knocking Charles out in the eighth round.

Marciano&#x27;s next title defense came in May 1955, against British and European Champion Don Cockell in San Francisco. Cockell was knocked out in the ninth round after Marciano had controlled most of the fight.

Marciano&#x27;s final title defense was against the number one contender and light-heavyweight champion, Archie Moore, on September 21, 1955. The bout was originally scheduled for September 20, but because of hurricane warnings, it had to be delayed a day. Marciano was knocked down for a four-count in the second round, but quickly recovered and retained his title with a knockout in round nine.

Marciano announced his retirement on April 27, 1956, aged 32. He finished his career an undefeated champion, with a final record of 49–0, 43 of them ending in knockouts.

==Life after boxing==
Marciano considered a comeback in 1959 when Ingemar Johansson won the Heavyweight Championship from Floyd Patterson on June 26, 1959. After only a month of training in nearly four years, Marciano decided against it and never seriously considered a comeback again.

After his retirement, Marciano entered the world of television, first hosting a weekly boxing show on TV in 1961 and later appearing in the &quot;Combat!&quot; episode &quot;Masquerade&quot;. For a brief period, he worked as a troubleshooting referee in wrestling (Marciano was a good wrestler in high school). He continued as a referee and boxing commentator in boxing matches for many years. He was also active in business as a partner and vice president of Papa Luigi Spaghetti Dens, a San Francisco-based franchise company formed by Joe Kearns and James Braly.

Marciano had two children—a daughter, Mary Anne (born 1952), who died on June 3, 2011, of complications from a respiratory illness and a son, Rocco Kevin (born 1968). Mary Anne had several run-ins with the law in Florida in the 1980s and 1990s, getting arrested and charged with assault and armed robbery after previously serving jail time for cocaine possession. Joey Marciano, a professional baseball player, is a cousin twice removed.

In late July 1969, shortly before his death, Marciano participated in the filming of &quot;The Superfight: Marciano vs. Ali&quot;. The two boxers were filmed sparring, then the film was edited to match a computer simulation of a hypothetical fight between them, each in his prime. It aired on January 20, 1970, with one version having Marciano winning and the second version having Ali winning.

==Personal life==
In 1947, Marciano met Barbra Cousins, daughter of a Brockton police sergeant. The two were married on December 31, 1950. They had a daughter, Mary Ann, and later adopted a son, Rocco Junior.

Marciano was a devout Catholic and often attended Catholic mass during training and before a fight. He once stated &quot;the biggest thrill I can think of would be an audience with the Pope&quot;.

==Death==
On August 31, 1969 (the day before his 46th birthday), Marciano was a passenger in a small private plane, a Cessna 172 heading to Des Moines, Iowa from Chicago Midway. It was night and bad weather had set in. The pilot, Glenn Belz, had only 231 total hours of flying time, 35 of them at night, and had no instrument rating. Belz tried to land the plane at a small airfield outside Newton, Iowa but the aircraft hit a tree two miles short of the runway. Flying with Marciano in the back seat was Frankie Farrell, 28, the oldest son of organized crime figure Lew Farrell. Marciano, Belz, and Farrell were killed on impact.

The National Transportation Safety Board report said, &quot;The pilot attempted an operation exceeding his experience and ability level, continued visual flight rules under adverse weather conditions and experienced spatial disorientation in the last moments of the flight.&quot; Marciano was on his way to give a speech to support his friend&#x27;s son and there was a surprise birthday celebration waiting for him. He had hoped to return in the early morning for his 46th birthday celebration with his wife. He was coming from a dinner in Chicago at STP CEO Andy Granatelli&#x27;s home.

Marciano is interred in a crypt at Forest Lawn Memorial Cemetery in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. His wife died five years later at the age of 46 due to lung cancer and is entombed next to him.

==Legacy==

Marciano holds the record with heavyweight Brian Nielsen for the longest undefeated streak by a heavyweight. He is also the only world heavyweight champion to go undefeated throughout his professional career. Although heavyweight champion Gene Tunney never suffered a defeat at heavyweight and retired as champion, he lost one career fight at light heavyweight, and his longest win streak was 32, with his overall record being 82-1-4(D)-1(NC). Marciano also has the highest knockout percentage of any heavyweight champion in history (over the period of a career) with 87.76%. In his professional career, he was only knocked down twice. The first occurred in his first title fight against Jersey Joe Walcott, and the second occurred against Archie Moore.

Despite his perfect record and retiring as champion, Marciano has sometimes been criticized for the allegedly low quality of opposition he faced during his career. At the time of his first fight with Roland La Starza, some experts believed it was La Starza and not Marciano who deserved the decision.

These criticisms notwithstanding, over the decades Marciano has been ranked highly in several all-time boxing lists. In December 1962, a &quot;Ring&quot; poll of 40 boxing experts placed Marciano as the seventh-best heavyweight of all time. Boxing historian Charlie Rose rated Marciano as the eight-best heavyweight of all time in 1968, while John McCallum&#x27;s survey of boxing historians and writers listed him as the ninth-best all-timer in the division. In 1971, Nat Fleischer, a boxing historian and founder of &quot;The Ring&quot;, named Marciano as the 10th all-time greatest heavyweight champion.

In 1998, &quot;The Ring&quot; named Marciano as the sixth greatest heavyweight champion ever. In 2002, &quot;The Ring&quot; placed him at number 12 on the list of the 80 Best Fighters of the Last 80 Years. In 2003, &quot;The Ring&quot; rated Marciano number 14 on the list of 100 greatest punchers of all time. In 2005, he was named the fifth greatest heavyweight of all time by the International Boxing Research Organization. In 2007, on ESPN.com&#x27;s list of the 50 Greatest Boxers of All Time, Marciano was ranked number 14, and was the 5th highest ranked heavyweight, behind (in order) Muhammad Ali, Joe Louis, Jack Johnson, and Jack Dempsey.

Marciano&#x27;s punch was tested and it was featured in the December 1963 issue of &quot;Boxing Illustrated&quot;: &quot;Marciano&#x27;s knockout blow packs more explosive energy than an armor-piercing bullet and represents as much energy as would be required to spot lift 1000 pounds one foot off the ground.&quot;

Marciano was named fighter of the year by &quot;The Ring&quot; three times. His three championship fights between 1952 and 1954 were named fights of the year by the magazine. Marciano won the BWAA Sugar Ray Robinson Award (then known as the Edward J. Neil Trophy) in 1952. In 2006, an ESPN poll voted Marciano&#x27;s 1952 championship bout against Walcott as the greatest knockout ever. Marciano also received the Hickok Belt for top professional athlete of the year in 1952. Murray Goodman later recalled that Ray Hickok, founder of the award, also presented Rocky with a hundred miniature boxing gloves, which Rocky was selling a week later for $1 a pair. In 1955, he was voted the second most important American athlete of the year.

Marciano is a member of the International Boxing Hall of Fame and the World Boxing Hall of Fame.

A bronze statue of Marciano was planned for a 2009 completion date in his hometown of Brockton, Massachusetts, as a gift to the city by the World Boxing Council. The artist, Mario Rendon, head of the Instituto Universitario de las Bellas Artes in Colima, Mexico, was selected to sculpt the statue. After years of delays in the planning stages, the groundbreaking for the statue was held on April 1, 2012, on the grounds of Brockton High School. The statue was officially unveiled on September 23, 2012, which was the 60th anniversary of Marciano winning the world heavyweight title. A bronze statue of Marciano was also erected in Ripa Teatina, Italy, to celebrate the birthplace of Marciano&#x27;s father.

<text>Shammai (c. 50 BCE – c. 30 CE, , &quot;Šammaʾy&quot;) was a Jewish scholar of the 1st century and an important figure in Judaism&#x27;s core work of rabbinic literature, the Mishnah. Shammai was the most eminent contemporary of the sage and scholar Hillel. 

His teachings mostly agree with those of Hillel, except on three issues. Both were divided over an earlier rabbinic dispute, regarding the actual laying on of hands upon a sacrificial animal on a Festival Day, which Hillel permitted. Their disciples, who had differing views to their masters, disputed many other halakhic matters. The School of Shammai, founded by Shammai, is almost invariably mentioned along with the School of Hillel, founded by Hillel. They differed fundamentally from each other. Although they were contemporaries, Hillel was nearly 60 years old at the time of Shammai&#x27;s birth.

While the terms &quot;liberal&quot; and &quot;conservative&quot; may not perfectly capture the nuances of their positions, Hillel is generally considered to have been more lenient or flexible in his interpretations of Jewish law compared to Shammai. For instance, in matters such as divorce and Sabbath observance, Hillel often took a more permissive approach, emphasizing compassion and practicality. On the other hand, Shammai tended to be more stringent in his interpretations, prioritizing strict adherence to the law.

== History ==
Shammai, along with Hillel his contemporary, took on oversight of the Sanhedrin sometime after Abtalion and Shemayah relinquished power. Shammai&#x27;s school of thought became known as the House of Shammai (, &quot;Beit Shammai&quot;), as Hillel&#x27;s was known as the House of Hillel (&quot;Beit Hillel&quot;). After Menahem the Essene resigned from the office of Av Beit Din (or vice-president) of the Sanhedrin, Shammai was elected to it, Hillel being at the time Nasi (president). After Hillel died, circa 10 CE, Shammai took his place as president, but no vice-president from the minority was elected so that the school of Shammai attained complete ascendancy. During this time Shammai passed &quot;18 ordinances&quot; in conformity with his ideas. The Talmud states that when he passed one of the ordinances, contrary to the opinion of Hillel, the day &quot;was as grievous to Israel as the day when the [golden] calf was made&quot;. According to most opinions, the ordinances, which are listed in an appendix to the ArtScroll edition of the Mishnah of tractate Shabbos, dealt with ritual purity of the Terumah and increased separation between Jews and Gentiles.

== Legacy ==
Hillel&#x27;s grandson Gamaliel succeeded to the position of president after Shammai in 30 CE, but the Sanhedrin remained dominated by the house of Shammai until around 70 CE (see Council of Jamnia). A &quot;voice from heaven&quot; was said to have nullified the legality of the rulings of the house of Shammai, which is why Rabbinical Judaism has followed Hillel.

Shammai took an active part in the political and religious complications of his native land. Of a stern temperament, he cultivated the characteristic of firmness and strictness in law in contrast to the tireless patience which is said to have distinguished Hillel&#x27;s approach. Once, when a gentile came to him and asked to be converted to Judaism (or Noahide monotheism as H. Falk argues) upon the condition of extreme brevity (&quot;on one foot&quot;) which Shammai held to be impossible, he drove the brazen applicant away; whereas Hillel rebuked him gently by saying, &quot;What is hateful to you, do not do to your fellow. This is the whole Torah. The rest is the explanation. Go and learn.&quot; The gentile subsequently converted.

== Religious views ==
Shammai recommended a friendly attitude toward all. His motto was: &quot;Make your study of the Torah a permanent endeavour; speak little, but accomplish much; and receive every man with a cheerful disposition&quot;. He was modest even toward his pupils.

At a personal level, Shammai&#x27;s religious views were known to be strict. He wished to make his son, while still a child, conform to the law regarding fasting on Yom Kippur; he was dissuaded from his purpose only through the insistence of his friends. Once, when his daughter-in-law gave birth to a boy on Sukkot he broke through the roof of the chamber in which she lay in order to make a sukkah of it, so that his new-born grandchild might fulfil the religious obligation of the festival.

In the Sifre it is said that Shammai commented exegetically upon three passages of Scripture: (1) the interpretation of Deuteronomy 20:20; (2) that of II Samuel 12:9; and (3) either the interpretation of &quot;Leviticus&quot; 11:34 (which is given anonymously in Sifra on the passage, but which is the basis for Shammai&#x27;s halakha transmitted in Orlah 2:5), or else the interpretation of &quot;Exodus&quot; 20:8 (&quot;Remember the Sabbath&quot;) (which is given in the Mekhilta in the name of Eleazar ben Hananiah, but which must have originated with Shammai, with whose custom of preparing for the Sabbath it accords).

<doc id="154976" wikidata="Q1890313" url="?curid=154976" title="Responsa">
<text>Responsa (plural of Latin , &#x27;answer&#x27;) comprise a body of written decisions and rulings given by legal scholars in response to questions addressed to them. In the modern era, the term is used to describe decisions and rulings made by scholars in historic religious law.

==In the Roman Empire==
Roman law recognised , i.e., the responses and thoughts of jurists, as one of the sources of (written law), along with laws originating from magistrates, from the Senate, or from the emperor.

A particularly well-known and highly influential example of such &quot;responsa&quot; was the &quot;Digesta&quot; (or &quot;Digests&quot;), in 90 books, the principal work of the prominent second century jurist Salvius Julianus. This was a systematic treatise on civil and praetorian law, consisting of responsa on real and hypothetical cases, cited by many later Roman legal writers.

==In the Catholic Church==
In the Catholic Church, &quot;responsa&quot; are answers of the competent executive authority to specific questions (in Latin, dubia, literally &quot;doubts&quot;) sent by Catholic bishops to the Holy See. &quot;Responsa&quot; given by the Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts which are promulgated as authentic interpretation have the force of law as per canon 16 §2 of the 1983 &quot;Code of Canon Law&quot;. Other &quot;responsa&quot; cannot have this binding force, but nevertheless possess a high authority.

Some &quot;responsa&quot; are given in &quot;Notitiae&quot;, the official journal of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments (CDW). The &quot;responsa&quot; given in &quot;Notitiae&quot; are, according to the CDW, to be considered only as private responses unless they are published in official legal records of the Holy See.

==In Judaism==

In rabbinic literature, the &quot;responsa&quot; are known as &quot;She&#x27;elot u-Teshuvot&quot; ( &quot;questions and answers&quot;), and comprise the body of written decisions and rulings given by poskim (&quot;deciders of Jewish law&quot;). A modern term, used mainly for questions on the internet, is &quot;Ask the rabbi&quot;.

Judaism&#x27;s responsa constitute a special class of rabbinic literature, to be distinguished from the commentaries (&quot;meforshim&quot;)—devoted to the exegesis of the Hebrew Bible, the Mishnah, the Talmud—and from the codes of law which delineate the rules for ordinary incidents of life.

The responsa literature covers a period of 1,700 years—the mode, style, and subject matter have changed as a function of the travels of the Jewish people and of the development of other halakhic literature, particularly the codes.

Responsa play a particularly important role in Jewish law. The questions forwarded are usually practical, and often concerned with new contingencies for which no provision has been made in the codes of law, and the responsa thus supplement the codes. They, therefore, function as a source of law, in a manner similar to legal precedent, in that they are consulted by later decisors (poskim) in their rulings; they are also, in turn, incorporated into subsequent codes.

In addition to requests for halakhic rulings, many of the questions addressed were theoretical in character, particularly among the earlier responsa. The responsa thus contain rulings on ethics, business ethics, the philosophy of religion, astronomy, mathematics, history, geography, as well as interpretations of passages in the Bible, the Mishnah, the Talmud, and the Midrash. Thus, while early Jewish literature has few historical works, many notes on the history of Judaism have been introduced into the responsa.

Responsa thus contain valuable information about the culture of the Jews and the people among whom they lived. Information may also be gleaned about the moral and social relations of the times, occupations, the household, customs, expressions of joy and of sorrow, and recreations, and even games. Older responsa are also important for readings and emendations of the Mishnah and the Talmud.

==In Islam==
A similar use of responsa (here called fatwā) is found in Islam.

<doc id="154985" wikidata="Q327353" url="?curid=154985" title="System administrator">
<text>An IT administrator, system administrator, sysadmin, or admin is a person who is responsible for the upkeep, configuration, and reliable operation of computer systems, especially multi-user computers, such as servers. The system administrator seeks to ensure that the uptime, performance, resources, and security of the computers they manage meet the needs of the users, without exceeding a set budget when doing so.

To meet these needs, a system administrator may acquire, install, or upgrade computer components and software; provide routine automation; maintain security policies; troubleshoot; train or supervise staff; or offer technical support for projects.

==Related fields==
Many organizations staff offer jobs related to system administration. In a larger company, these may all be separate positions within a computer support or Information Services (IS) department. In a smaller group they may be shared by a few sysadmins, or even a single person.

* A database administrator (DBA) maintains a database system, and is responsible for the integrity of the data and the efficiency and performance of the system.
* A network administrator maintains network infrastructure such as switches and routers, and diagnoses problems with these or with the behavior of network-attached computers.
* A security administrator is a specialist in computer and network security, including the administration of security devices such as firewalls, as well as consulting on general security measures.
* A web administrator maintains web server services (such as Apache or IIS) that allow for internal or external access to web sites. Tasks include managing multiple sites, administering security, and configuring necessary components and software. Responsibilities may also include software change management.
* A computer operator performs routine maintenance and upkeep, such as changing backup tapes or replacing failed drives in a redundant array of independent disks (RAID). Such tasks usually require physical presence in the room with the computer, and while less skilled than sysadmin tasks, may require a similar level of trust, since the operator has access to possibly sensitive data.
* An SRE Site Reliability Engineer - takes a software engineering or programmatic approach to managing systems.

== Training ==
Most employers require a bachelor&#x27;s degree in a related field, such as computer science, information technology, electronics engineering, or computer engineering. Some schools also offer undergraduate degrees and graduate programs in system administration.

In addition, because of the practical nature of system administration and the easy availability of open-source server software, many system administrators enter the field self-taught.

Generally, a prospective employee will be required to have experience with the computer systems they are expected to manage. In most cases, candidates are expected to possess industry certifications such as the Microsoft MCSA, MCSE, MCITP, Red Hat RHCE, Novell CNA, CNE, Cisco CCNA or CompTIA&#x27;s A+ or Network+, Sun Certified SCNA, Linux Professional Institute, Linux Foundation Certified Engineer or Linux Foundation Certified System Administrator, among others.

Sometimes, almost exclusively in smaller sites, the role of system administrator may be given to a skilled user in addition to or in replacement of their duties.

== Skills ==
The &quot;subject matter&quot; of system administration includes computer systems and the ways people use them in an organization. This entails a knowledge of operating systems and applications, as well as hardware and software troubleshooting, but also knowledge of the purposes for which people in the organization use the computers.

Perhaps the most important skill for a system administrator is problem solving—frequently under various sorts of constraints and stress. The sysadmin is on call when a computer system goes down or malfunctions, and must be able to quickly and correctly diagnose what is wrong and how best to fix it. They may also need to have teamwork and communication skills; as well as being able to install and configure hardware and software.

Sysadmins must understand the behavior of software in order to deploy it and to troubleshoot problems, and generally know several programming languages used for scripting or automation of routine tasks. A typical sysadmin&#x27;s role is not to design or write new application software but when they are responsible for automating system or application configuration with various configuration management tools, the lines somewhat blur. Depending on the sysadmin&#x27;s role and skillset they may be expected to understand equivalent key/core concepts a software engineer understands. That said, system administrators are not software engineers or developers, in the job title sense.

Particularly when dealing with Internet-facing or business-critical systems, a sysadmin must have a strong grasp of computer security. This includes not merely deploying software patches, but also preventing break-ins and other security problems with preventive measures. In some organizations, computer security administration is a separate role responsible for overall security and the upkeep of firewalls and intrusion detection systems, but all sysadmins are generally responsible for the security of computer systems.

==Duties==
A system administrator&#x27;s responsibilities might include:

* Analyzing system logs and identifying potential issues with computer systems.
* Applying operating system updates, patches, and configuration changes.
* Installing and configuring new hardware and software.
* Adding, removing, or updating user account information, resetting passwords, etc.
* Answering technical queries and assisting users.
* Responsibility for security.
* Responsibility for documenting the configuration of the system.
* Troubleshooting any reported problems.
* System performance tuning.
* Ensuring that the network infrastructure is up and running.
* Configuring, adding, and deleting file systems.
* Ensuring parity between dev, test and production environments.
* Training users
* Plan and manage the machine room environment

In larger organizations, some of the tasks above may be divided among different system administrators or members of different organizational groups. For example, a dedicated individual(s) may apply all system upgrades, a Quality Assurance (QA) team may perform testing and validation, and one or more technical writers may be responsible for all technical documentation written for a company. System administrators, in larger organizations, tend not to be systems architects, systems engineers, or systems designers.

In smaller organizations, the system administrator might also act as technical support, database administrator, network administrator, storage (SAN) administrator or application analyst.

<doc id="154987" wikidata="Q185025" url="?curid=154987" title="Rainier III, Prince of Monaco">
<text>Rainier III (Rainier Louis Henri Maxence Bertrand Grimaldi; 31 May 1923 – 6 April 2005) was Prince of Monaco from 1949 to his death in 2005. Rainier ruled the Principality of Monaco for almost 56 years.

Rainier was born at the Prince&#x27;s Palace of Monaco, the only son of Hereditary Princess Charlotte and Prince Pierre. During his reign, he was responsible for the transformation of Monaco&#x27;s economy, shifting from its traditional casino gambling base to its current status as a tax haven and cultural destination. The Prince also coordinated the substantial reforms of Monaco&#x27;s constitution, which limited the powers of sovereign rule.

Rainier married American film star Grace Kelly in 1956, which generated global media attention. They had three children: Caroline, Albert and Stéphanie. Rainier died in April 2005 from complications relating to a lung infection as a result of frequent smoking; he was succeeded by his son, Albert II.

==Early life==
Rainier was born at Prince&#x27;s Palace in Monaco, the first native-born prince since Honoré IV in 1758. Rainier&#x27;s mother, Charlotte, was the only child of Louis II, Prince of Monaco, and his lover, Marie Juliette Louvet; she was legitimised through formal adoption and subsequently named heiress presumptive to the throne of Monaco. Rainier&#x27;s father, Count Pierre of Polignac, who was half-French and half-Mexican, adopted his wife&#x27;s dynasty, Grimaldi, upon marriage and was made a Prince of Monaco by his father-in-law. Rainier had an older sister, Princess Antoinette, Baroness of Massy. His parents divorced in 1933.

Rainier&#x27;s early education was conducted in England, at the public schools of Summerfields in St Leonards-on-Sea, Sussex, and after 1935 at Stowe School, in Buckinghamshire. Rainier then attended the Institut Le Rosey in Rolle and Gstaad, Switzerland from 1939, before continuing to the University of Montpellier in France, where he obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1943, before studying at Sciences Po Paris in Paris.

In 1944, the day before his 21st birthday, Rainier&#x27;s mother renounced her right to the Monegasque throne and Rainier became Prince Louis&#x27;s direct heir. In World War II, Rainier joined the Free French Army in September 1944, and served under General Joseph de Goislard de Monsabert as a second lieutenant. As a soldier, he witnessed action during the German counter-offensive in Alsace. Rainier received the French Croix de Guerre with bronze star (representing a brigade level citation) and was given the rank of Legion of Honor in 1947. Following his decommission from the French Army, he was promoted by the French government to captain in April 1949 and colonel in December 1954.

Rainier became the Sovereign Prince of Monaco upon the death of his maternal grandfather, Prince Louis II, on 9 May 1949, at the age of 25.

==Reign==

After ascending the throne, Rainier III worked to recoup Monaco&#x27;s lustre, which had become tarnished through financial neglect and scandal (his mother, Princess Charlotte, took a noted jewel thief known as René the Cane as her lover). Upon ascension, the Prince found a treasury that was practically empty. Monaco&#x27;s traditional gambling clientele, largely European aristocrats, found themselves with reduced funds after World War II. Other successful gambling centres had opened to compete with Monaco. To compensate for the loss of income, Rainier decided to promote Monaco as a tax haven, commercial centre, real-estate development opportunity, and international tourist attraction. The early years of his reign saw the overweening involvement of the Greek shipping tycoon Aristotle Onassis, who took control of the Société des Bains de Mer and envisioned Monaco as solely a gambling resort. Prince Rainier regained control of SBM in 1964, effectively ensuring that his vision of Monaco would be implemented.

During his reign, the Societé Monégasque de Banques et de Métaux Précieux, a bank which held a significant amount of Monaco&#x27;s capital, was bankrupted by its investments in a media company in 1955, leading to the resignation of Monaco&#x27;s cabinet. In 1962, Rainier ratified the Principality&#x27;s new constitution, which significantly reduced the power of the sovereign. He had suspended the previous constitution in 1959, saying that it &quot;has hindered the administrative and political life of the country&quot;. The changes ended autocratic rule, placing power with both the Prince and a National Council of eighteen elected members.

At the time of his death, he was the world&#x27;s second longest-serving living head of state, just below the King of Thailand, Bhumibol Adulyadej, and the longest-reigning monarch in Europe.

==Personal life==
In the 1940s and 1950s, Rainier had a ten-year relationship with the French film actress Gisèle Pascal, whom he had met while a student at Montpellier University, and the couple lived at Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat. Rainier&#x27;s sister, Princess Antoinette, wishing her own son to ascend the throne, spread rumors that Pascal was infertile. The rumours combined with a snobbery over Pascal&#x27;s family origins ultimately ended the relationship.

Rainier established a postal museum in 1950: the Museum of Stamps and Coins, in Monaco&#x27;s Fontvieille district by using the collections of the Monegasque princes Albert I and Louis II. The prestigious philatelic collectors organization, Club de Monte-Carlo de l&#x27;Élite de la Philatélie, was established in 1999 under his direct patronage. The club is headquartered at the postal museum, and its membership restricted to institutions and one hundred prestigious collectors. Rainier organized exhibitions of rare and exceptional postage stamps and letters with the club&#x27;s members. 

Throughout his reign, Rainier surveyed all the process of creation of Monaco stamps. He preferred stamps printed in intaglio and the art of engravers Henri Cheffer and Czesław Słania.

Rainier&#x27;s car collection was opened to the public as the Monaco Top Cars Collection in Fontvieille.

===Marriage and family===
The Prince met Academy Award–winning actress Grace Kelly in 1955, during a photocall at the Palace scheduled to support her trip to the Cannes Film Festival. After a year-long courtship described as containing &quot;a good deal of rational appraisal on both sides,&quot; Prince Rainier married Kelly in 1956. 

The union was met with mass attention from the public, and was described as the &quot;wedding of the century&quot; and the &quot;world&#x27;s most anticipated wedding&quot; by the media. The civil ceremony took place at the Palace on 18 April, with the religious wedding being held on 19 April at the Saint Nicholas Cathedral. Rainier wore a military dress of his own design, based on the uniforms of Napoleon Bonaparte. Presided over by Bishop Gilles Barthe, the marriage was broadcast by MGM Studios, and viewed by over 30 million people across the globe. The couple honeymooned in the Mediterranean on their yacht, &quot;Deo Juvante II&quot;.

Princess Grace gave birth to their first child, Princess Caroline, on 23 January 1957. Their second child and heir, Prince Albert, was born on 14 March 1958. Their youngest, Princess Stéphanie, was born 1 February 1965, with all children having been delivered at the Palace.

In 1979, the Prince made his acting debut alongside the Princess in a half-hour independent film, &quot;Rearranged&quot;, produced in Monaco. After its premiere in Monaco, Princess Grace showed it to ABC TV executives in New York in 1982, who expressed interest if extra scenes were shot. However, Grace died in a car crash caused by a cerebral hemorrhage in 1982, making it impossible to expand the film for an American release. After Grace&#x27;s death, Rainier refused to remarry. He established the Princess Grace Foundation-USA in 1982 in her honor, to support fledging American artists.

==Illness and death==


Rainier smoked sixty cigarettes a day. In the last years of his life his health progressively declined. He underwent surgery in late 1999 and 2000, and was hospitalized in November 2002 for a chest infection. He spent three weeks in hospital in January 2004 for what was described as general fatigue. In February 2004, he was hospitalized with a coronary lesion and a damaged blood vessel. In October of that year, he was again in hospital with a lung infection. His son, Hereditary Prince Albert, later appeared on CNN&#x27;s &quot;Larry King Live&quot; and told Larry King that his father was fine, though he was suffering from bronchitis.

On 7 March 2005, he was again hospitalized for a lung infection. On 22 March, he was then moved to the hospital&#x27;s intensive care unit. The following day, it was announced he was on a ventilator, suffering from renal and heart failure. On 26 March, the palace reported that despite intensive ongoing efforts to improve the prince&#x27;s health, he was continuing to deteriorate; however, on 27 March, he was reported to be conscious, his heart and kidney conditions having stabilized. His prognosis remained &quot;very reserved&quot;.

On 31 March 2005, following consultation with the Crown Council of Monaco, the Palais Princier announced that Hereditary Prince Albert would take over the duties of his father as regent since Rainier was no longer able to exercise his princely functions. On 1 April 2005, the Palace announced that Rainier&#x27;s doctors believed his chances of recovery were &quot;slim&quot;. On 6 April, Prince Rainier III died at the Cardiothoracic Centre of Monaco at 6:35 am local time at the age of 81. His son subsequently became the new Prince of Monaco as Albert II.

His funeral was held on 15 April 2005 beside his wife, Princess Grace, at the Cathedral of Our Lady Immaculate, the traditional burial place of princes and princesses of Monaco, and the place where Prince Rainier and Princess Grace had been married in 1956. Rainier&#x27;s death was overshadowed in the media as it occurred shortly after that of Pope John Paul II.

<doc id="154989" wikidata="Q3289889" url="?curid=154989" title="Walden Two">
<text>Walden Two is a utopian novel written by behavioral psychologist B. F. Skinner, first published in 1948. At that time, it was considered as science fiction since science-based methods for altering human behavior were not widespread. Such methods are now known as applied behavior analysis.

The book is controversial because its characters speak of a rejection of free will, including a rejection of the proposition that human behavior is controlled by a non-corporeal entity, such as a spirit or a soul. It embraces the proposition that the behavior of organisms, including humans, is determined by environmental variables, and that systematically altering environmental variables can generate a sociocultural system that very closely approximates utopia.

==Synopsis==
The first-person narrator and protagonist, Professor Burris, a university instructor of psychology, is approached by two young men (one a former student) in the late 1940s. The young men are recent veterans of World War II and, intrigued by utopianism, express interest in an old acquaintance of Burris, named T. E. Frazier, who in the 1930s founded an intentional community. Burris contacts Frazier, who invites them all to stay for several days to experience life in the supposedly utopian community. Venturing to the community, named Walden Two, the young men bring their girlfriends, and Professor Burris brings along his colleague Professor Castle, who teaches philosophy and ethics.

The rest of the book proceeds largely as a novel of ideas, mostly involving Frazier, a smug, talkative, and colorful character, guiding his new visitors around Walden Two and proudly explaining its socio-politico-economic structures and collectivist achievements. A wide range of intellectual topics—behavioral modification, political ethics, educational philosophy, sexual equality (specifically, advocacy for women in the workforce), the common good, historiography, freedom and free will, fascism, American democracy, and Soviet communism—is discussed and often debated among the self-satisfied Frazier, the skeptical and doubting Castle, and the quietly intrigued Burris.

Walden Two operates using a flexible design, by continually experimenting with the most successful, evidence-based strategies to organize the community. Praising Walden Two&#x27;s decision-making system for not being authoritarian, anarchic, or even democratic, Frazier argues that Walden Two thus avoids the way that most societies collapse or grow dysfunctional: by remaining dogmatically rigid in their politics and social structure. Except for a small fluctuating group of community Planners (temporarily including Frazier), Walden Two has no real governing body or power to exercise violent force over its citizens. Each member is apparently self-motivated, with a relaxed work schedule of only four hours of work a day, on average. Any labor performed supports the common good and is accompanied by the freedom to select a fresh new place to work each day. Members then use their remaining free time to engage in creative, intellectual, or recreational activities of their own choosing, while automatically receiving ample food and sleep. The only currency is a simple system of points that buys greater leisure periods in exchange for less desirable forms of work. Certain radically unusual customs of Walden Two include: children raised communally, families being non-nuclear, free love, and personal expressions of thanks regarded as taboo. Such behavior is mandated by the community&#x27;s individually self-enforced &quot;Walden Code&quot;, a guideline that encourages members to credit all individual and other achievements to the larger community. Community counselors are also available to assist with better understanding and following the Code. A rigorous program of &quot;behavioral engineering&quot; is begun at birth and completed during childhood, yet the adults of Walden Two indeed appear to be legitimately peaceful, productive, happy, well-rounded, and self-directed people. 

Excitedly, two of the young visitors sign up and are soon admitted as permanent members. Castle, though, has fostered a growing hunch that Frazier is somehow presenting a sham society or is in fact, secretly, a dictator. Defending the virtues of American-style democracy, he finally confronts Frazier directly, accusing him of despotism, though he has no definitive proof. Frazier rebuts, on the contrary, that the vision for Walden Two is as a place safe from all forms of despotism, even the &quot;despotism of democracy&quot;. Frazier and Burris have pleasant talks in private, with Frazier revealing that other communities loosely associated with Walden Two have now cropped up. Although enticed by Walden Two&#x27;s obvious success as a peaceful community, Burris finds it difficult to look past Frazier&#x27;s irritating pride and boastfulness about the community. Frazier admits his pride but argues that his personality should not influence Burris&#x27;s opinion of Walden Two and Burris&#x27;s own observations. By the end of their stay, the remaining visitors leave the community in a mostly impressed state of wonder, except for Castle, who has stubbornly settled on the idea that, somehow, Frazier is a scoundrel and the community is fraudulent.

During the visitors&#x27; return to the university, Burris ultimately decides in an inspired moment that he wishes to fully embrace the Walden Two lifestyle. Quickly abandoning his professorial post, Burris travels back in a long and spiritually satisfying journey on foot; he is welcomed once again to Walden Two with open arms.

==The community==
The novel describes &quot;an experimental community called Walden Two&quot;. The community is located in a rural area and &quot;has nearly a thousand members&quot;. The community encourages its members &quot;to view every habit and custom with an eye to possible improvement&quot; and to have &quot;a constantly experimental attitude toward everything&quot;. The culture of Walden Two can be changed if experimental evidence favors proposed changes. The community emulates (on a communal scale) the simple living and self-sufficiency that Henry David Thoreau practiced (on an individual scale) at Walden Pond, as described in his 1854 book &quot;Walden&quot;. Walden Two engages in behavioral engineering of young children that aims toward cooperative relationships and the erasure of competitive sentiments. The community has also dissolved the nuclear family through placing the responsibility of child-rearing in the hands of the larger community and not just the child&#x27;s parents or immediate family.

==Community governance==
Walden Two consists of four loose classes or groupings of people by occupation (though they are not akin to strict economic classes): &quot;Planners&quot;, &quot;Managers&quot;, &quot;Workers&quot;, and &quot;Scientists&quot;. Walden Two has a constitution that provides for a &quot;Board of Planners&quot;, which is Walden Two&#x27;s &quot;only government&quot;, though the power they wield only amounts to that, approximately, of community organizers. The idea for the &quot;Board of Planners&quot; was conceived while Walden Two was still in its earliest theoretical stages, and there are &quot;six Planners, usually three men and three women&quot;, who are &quot;charged with the success of the community. They make policies, review the work of the Managers (heads of each area of labor), keep an eye on the state of the nation in general. They also have certain judicial functions.&quot; A Planner &quot;may serve for ten years, but no longer.&quot; A vacancy on the Board of Planners is filled by the Board &quot;from a pair of names supplied by the Managers&quot;. Furthermore, the Walden Two constitution &quot;can be changed by a unanimous vote of the Planners and a two-thirds vote of the Managers&quot;.

Frazier and five other people constitute the current Board of Planners during Burris&#x27;s visit to Walden Two. Planners hold office in staggered, limited terms. They do not rule with any kind of force and are so extremely opposed to creating a cult of personality, system of favoritism, or other possibilities for corruption going against the common good that they do not even publicly announce their office, and, likewise, most of the community members do not bother to know the Planners&#x27; identities. Due to this and also as a result of this, the Planners live as modestly as the other members of the community; ostentatious displays of wealth and status simply have no opportunity to arise from Walden Two&#x27;s egalitarian cultural structure.

Managers, meanwhile, are &quot;specialists in charge of the divisions and services of Walden Two&quot;. A member of the community can &quot;work up to be a Manager – through intermediate positions which carry a good deal of responsibility and provide the necessary apprenticeship&quot;. The Managers are not elected by the members of Walden Two in any kind of democratic process. The method of selecting Managers is not specified, though they are likely appointed by the Board of Planners.

The regular community members are known (though only for official reasons) as Workers, and they have the flexible option of changing their field and location of employment every single day, so as not to grow bored or stagnant during the week with their four-on-average daily hours of work. Available work often includes the necessary physical labor that goes into maintaining a community, such as basic building or repairing projects, cleaning duties, or agricultural work. Labor in Walden Two operates using a simple point system of units called &quot;credits&quot;, in which more menial or unpleasant jobs (such as waste management) earn a Worker a higher number of credits than more relaxing or interesting jobs, ultimately allowing more free time for that Worker.

The final grouping within Walden Two is the Scientists, who conduct experiments &quot;in plant and animal breeding, the control of infant behavior, educational processes of several sorts, and the use of some of [Walden Two&#x27;s] raw materials&quot;. Scientists are the least discussed group in the novel; little is said about the selection, total number, specific duties, or methods of the Scientists, though they presumably carry out the ongoing social experiments that help determine the most beneficial social strategies for the community.

==Thoreau&#x27;s &quot;Walden&quot;==
&quot;Walden Two&quot;&#x27;s title is a direct reference to Henry David Thoreau&#x27;s book &quot;Walden&quot;. In the novel, the Walden Two Community is mentioned as having the benefits of living in a place like Thoreau&#x27;s Walden, but &quot;with company&quot;. It is, as the book says, &#x27;Walden for two&#x27;—meaning a place for achieving personal self-actualization, but within a vibrant community, rather than in a place of solitude. Originally, Skinner indicated that he wanted to title it &quot;The Sun is but a Morning Star&quot;, a quote of the last sentence of Thoreau&#x27;s &quot;Walden&quot;, but the publishers suggested the current title as an alternative.

In theory and in practice, Thoreau&#x27;s Walden Pond experiment and the fictive Walden Two experiment were very different from one another. For instance, Thoreau&#x27;s book &quot;Walden&quot; espouses the virtues of self-reliance at the individual level, while &quot;Walden Two&quot; espouses
# the virtues of self-reliance at the community level, and
# Skinner&#x27;s underlying premise that free will of the individual is weak compared to how environmental conditions shape behavior.

The cover of some editions of &quot;Walden Two&quot; shows the &#x27;O&#x27; filled with yellow ink, with yellow lines radiating from the center of the &#x27;O&#x27;. That Sun-like &#x27;O&#x27; is an allusion to the proposition that &quot;The sun is but a morning star&quot;.

==&quot;News From Nowhere, 1984&quot;==
Skinner published a follow-up to &quot;Walden Two&quot; in an essay titled &quot;News From Nowhere, 1984&quot;. It details the discovery of Eric Blair in the community who seeks out and meets Burris, confessing his true identity as George Orwell. Blair seeks out Frazier as the &#x27;leader&#x27; and the two have discussions which comprise the essay. Blair was impressed by Walden Two&#x27;s &quot;lack of any institutionalized government, religion, or economic system&quot;, a state of affairs that embodied &quot;the dream of nineteenth-century anarchism&quot;.

==Real-world efforts==
Many efforts to create a Walden Two in real life are detailed in Hilke Kuhlmann&#x27;s &quot;Living Walden Two&quot; and in Daniel W. Bjork&#x27;s &quot;B.F. Skinner&quot;.

Some of these efforts include:

* 1953: In Lincoln, Massachusetts, a group of families from the MIT community, led by Ranulf (Rany) Gras and his wife Ann and inspired by Skinner&#x27;s book, formed a corporation and built 23 homes on a lot in what became known as the Brown&#x27;s Wood neighborhood. 
* 1955: In New Haven, Connecticut, a group led by Arthur Gladstone tried to start a community.
* 1966: The Waldenwoods conference was held in Hartland, Michigan, comprising 83 adults and 4 children, coordinated through the Breiland list (a list of interested people who wrote to Skinner and were referred to Jim Breiland).
* 1966: Matthew Israel formed the Association for Social Design (ASD), to promote a Walden Two, which soon found chapters in Los Angeles, Albuquerque, and Washington, D.C.
* 1967: Matthew Israel founded the Morningside House in Arlington, Massachusetts. When it failed, he tried a second time. Israel later went on to found the Judge Rotenberg Center, which has been condemned by the United Nations for the torture of children with disabilities.
* 1967: The Twin Oaks Community was started in Louisa County, Virginia.
* 1969: Keith Miller in Lawrence, Kansas, founded a &#x27;Walden house&#x27; student collective that became the Sunflower House 11.
* 1970: Walden 7, a 1,000-inhabitant community west of Barcelona (Spain), was created as a social and architectural experiment based on &quot;Walden Two&quot;, living in a building designed by Catalan architect Ricardo Bofill.
* 1971: Roger Ulrich started &quot;an experimental community named Lake Village in Kalamazoo, Michigan.&quot;
* 1971: Los Horcones was started in Hermosillo, Mexico.
* 1971: Mary Louise Strum and David Nord started an experimental Jewish faith-based commune named &quot;Jubilee Community&quot; in Westphalia, Texas, based on Skinner&#x27;s Walden Two utopian ideals.
* 1972: Sunflower House 11 was (re)born in Lawrence, Kansas, from the previous experiment.
* 1973: East Wind was started in south-central Missouri.

Twin Oaks is detailed in Kat Kinkade&#x27;s book, &quot;A Walden Two experiment: The first five years of Twin Oaks Community&quot;. Originally started as a Walden Two community, it has since rejected its Walden Two position, however it still uses its modified Planner-Manager system as well as a system of labor credits based on the book.

Los Horcones does not use the Planner-Manager governance system described in &quot;Walden Two.&quot; They refer to their governance system as a &quot;personocracy&quot;. This system has been &quot;developed through ongoing experimentation&quot;. In contrast to Twin Oaks, Los Horcones &quot;has remained strongly committed to an experimental science of human behavior and has described itself as the only true Walden Two community in existence.&quot; In 1989, B. F. Skinner said that Los Horcones &quot;comes closest to the idea of the &#x27;engineered utopia&#x27; that he put forth in &quot;Walden Two&quot;&quot;.

==Cultural engineering==
Skinner wrote about cultural engineering in at least two books, devoting a chapter to it in both &quot;Science and Human Behavior&quot; and &quot;Beyond Freedom and Dignity&quot;. In &quot;Science and Human Behavior&quot; a chapter is titled &quot;Designing a Culture&quot; and expands on this position as well as in other documents. In &quot;Beyond Freedom and Dignity&quot; there are many indirect references to &quot;Walden Two&quot; when describing other cultural designs.

==Criticisms==
Hilke Kuhlmann&#x27;s &quot;Living Walden Two&quot; possesses many subtle and not-so-subtle criticisms of the original &quot;Walden Two&quot; which are related to the actual efforts that arose from the novel. One criticism is that many of the founders of real-life Walden Twos identified with, or wanted to emulate, Frazier, the uncharismatic and implicitly despotic founder of the community.

In a critique of &quot;Walden Two,&quot; Harvey L. Gamble, Jr. asserted that Skinner&#x27;s &quot;fundamental thesis is that individual traits are shaped from above, by social forces that create the environment&quot;, and that Skinner&#x27;s goal &quot;is to create a frictionless society where individuals are properly socialized to function with others as a unit&quot;, and to thus &quot;make the community [Walden Two] into a perfectly efficient anthill&quot;. Gamble writes, &quot;We find at the end of &quot;Walden Two&quot; that Frazier [a founding member of Walden Two]... has sole control over the political system and its policies. It is he who regulates food, work, education, and sleep, and who sets the moral and economic agenda.&quot;

There are several varieties of behaviorism, but only Skinner&#x27;s radical behaviorism has proposed to redesign society. The relevant principles were expounded at length two decades later in &quot;Beyond Freedom and Dignity&quot;.

&quot;Walden Two&quot; was criticized in John Staddon&#x27;s &quot;The New Behaviorism&quot;. Skinner thought &quot;Walden Two&quot; an accomplishment comparable to two science-fiction classics: Aldous Huxley&#x27;s &quot;Brave New World&quot; (1931) and George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; (1949). He assigned all three in his Nat Sci 114 introductory psychology course at Harvard. There is some irony in Skinner&#x27;s choice, because Orwell&#x27;s and Huxley&#x27;s novels are both dystopias. They portray not the supposed benefits of a technological approach to human society, but the evil consequences of either coercive (&quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;) or stealthy (&quot;Brave New World&quot;) efforts to control or gentle human beings. On the contrary, &quot;Walden Two&quot; is supposed to light the technological path to utopia.

Skinner&#x27;s Walden proposal is in a tradition that goes back to Plato&#x27;s philosopher king: a &#x27;legislator&#x27; (monarch) and a set of guardians who are wiser than the common people. The guardians &quot;are to be a class apart, like the Jesuits in old Paraguay, the ecclesiastics in the States of the Church until 1870 and the Communist Party in the U.S.S.R. at the present day,&quot; wrote Bertrand Russell, one of Skinner&#x27;s heroes, in 1946. Not too different from Walden Two&#x27;s Managers and Planners, and Frazier, Skinner&#x27;s avatar and leader of the community. Skinner was quite explicit about the need for technocratic rule: &quot;We must delegate control of the population as a whole to specialists – to police, priests, teachers, therapies, and so on, with their specialized reinforcers and their codified contingencies.&quot;

<text>Nicole Françoise Florence Dreyfus (; 27 April 1932 2024), known professionally as Anouk Aimée () or Anouk, was a French film actress who appeared in 70 films from 1947 until 2019. Having begun her film career at age 14, she studied acting and dance in her early years, besides her regular education. Although the majority of her films were French, she also made films in Spain, the United Kingdom, Italy and Germany, along with some American productions.

Among her films are Federico Fellini&#x27;s &quot;La dolce vita&quot; (1960), after which she was considered a &quot;rising star who exploded&quot; onto the film world. She subsequently acted in Fellini&#x27;s &quot;8½&quot; (1963), Jacques Demy&#x27;s &quot;Lola&quot; (1961), George Cukor&#x27;s &quot;Justine&quot; (1969), Bernardo Bertolucci&#x27;s &quot;Tragedy of a Ridiculous Man&quot; (1981), and Robert Altman&#x27;s &quot;Prêt à Porter&quot; (1994). She won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama and the BAFTA Award for Best Actress and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress for her acting in &quot;A Man and a Woman&quot; (1966). The film &quot;virtually reignited the lush on-screen romance in an era of skeptical modernism&quot;, and brought her international fame.

She won the Award for Best Actress at the Cannes Film Festival for Marco Bellocchio&#x27;s film &quot;A Leap in the Dark&quot; (1980). In 2002, she received an honorary César Award, France&#x27;s national film award. Aimée was known for her &quot;striking features&quot; and beauty, and considered &quot;one of the hundred sexiest stars in film history&quot;, according to a 1995 poll conducted by &quot;Empire&quot; magazine. She often portrayed a femme fatale with a melancholy aura. In the 1960s, &quot;Life&quot; magazine commented: &quot;after each picture her enigmatic beauty lingered&quot; in the memories of her audience, and called her &quot;the Left Bank&#x27;s most beautiful resident&quot;.

==Early years==
Aimée was born in Paris to actor Henry Murray (born Henri Dreyfus; 30 January 1907 – 29 January 1984) and actress Geneviève Sorya (née Durand; 23 June 1912 – 23 March 2008). According to one historian, although some have speculated that her background may be related to Captain Alfred Dreyfus, this has never been confirmed. Her father was Jewish, whereas her mother was Roman Catholic. She was raised Catholic but later converted to Judaism as an adult.

Her early education took place at l&#x27;École de la rue Milton, in Paris; École de Barbezieux; Pensionnat de Bandol; and Institution de Megève. She studied dance at Marseille Opera. During World War II she was a pupil at Mayfield School, East Sussex, but left before taking final exams. She studied theatre in England, after which she studied dramatic art and dance with Andrée Bauer-Thérond.

==Career==

Aimée (then still Françoise Dreyfus) made her film debut, at the age of 14, in the role of Anouk in &quot;La Maison sous la mer&quot; (&quot;The House Under the Sea&quot;, 1946), and she kept the name afterwards. Jacques Prévert, while writing &quot;Les amants de Vérone&quot; (&quot;The Lovers of Verona&quot;, 1949) specifically for her, suggested she take the symbolic last name Aimée, &quot;that would forever associate her with the affective power of her screen roles.&quot; In French, it means &quot;beloved.&quot;

Among her films were Alexandre Astruc&#x27;s &quot;The Crimson Curtain&quot; (&quot;Le Rideau Cramoisi&quot;, 1953), Federico Fellini&#x27;s &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot; (1960), Fellini&#x27;s &quot;8½&quot; (1963), Jacques Demy&#x27;s &quot;Lola&quot; (1961), André Delvaux&#x27;s &quot;One Night... A Train&quot; (&quot;Un Soir, un Train&quot;, 1968), George Cukor&#x27;s &quot;Justine&quot; (1969), Bernardo Bertolucci&#x27;s &quot;Tragedy of a Ridiculous Man&quot; (1981), Robert Altman&#x27;s &quot;Prêt à Porter&quot; (&quot;Ready to Wear&quot;, 1994), and Claude Lelouch&#x27;s &quot;A Man and a Woman&quot; (&quot;Un Homme et une femme&quot;, 1966) — described as a &quot;film that virtually reignited the lush on-screen romance in an era of skeptical modernism.&quot; Words like &quot;regal,&quot; &quot;intelligent&quot;, and &quot;enigmatic&quot; are frequently associated with her, notes one author, giving Aimée &quot;an aura of disturbing and mysterious beauty&quot; that earned her the status of &quot;one of the hundred sexiest stars in film history,&quot; according to a 1995 poll conducted by &quot;Empire Magazine&quot;.

Because of her &quot;striking features&quot; and her beauty, she has been compared to Jacqueline Kennedy. Film historian Ginette Vincendeau has commented that Aimée&#x27;s films &quot;established her as an ethereal, sensitive and fragile beauty with a tendency to tragic destinies or restrained suffering.&quot;

Her abilities as an actress and the photogenic  qualities of her face, its &quot;fine lines, expression of elation and a suggestive gaze,&quot; helped her achieve success in her early films. Émile Savitry made an early portrait of her at 15, holding a kitten on the set of Carné&#x27;s &quot;La Fleur de l&#x27;âge&quot; (1947). Among others of her films of this period were &quot;Pot-Bouille&quot; (1957), &quot;Les Amants de Montparnasse (Montparnasse 19)&quot; (The Lovers of Montparnasse, (1958), and &quot;La tête contre les murs&quot; (&quot;Head Against the Wall&quot;, 1958).

Besides the French cinema, Aimée&#x27;s career included films made in Spain, Great Britain, Italy, and Germany. She achieved worldwide attention in Fellini&#x27;s &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot; (1960) and &quot;Lola&quot; (1961). She appeared again in Fellini&#x27;s &quot;8½&quot;, and would remain in Italy during the first half of the 1960s, making films for a number of Italian directors. Because of her role in &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot;, biographer Dave Thompson describes Aimée as a &quot;rising star who exploded&quot; onto the film world. He adds that singer-songwriter Patti Smith, who in her teens saw the film, began to idolise her, and &quot;dreamed of being an actress like Aimée.&quot;

Aimée&#x27;s greatest success came with the film &quot;A Man and a Woman&quot; (&quot;Un homme et une femme&quot;, 1966) directed by Claude Lelouch. Primarily due to the excellent acting by its stars, Aimée and Jean-Louis Trintignant, and the beautiful musical score, the film became an international success, winning both the Grand Prize at the Cannes Film Festival in 1966 and two Oscars including Best Foreign Language Film. Tabery states that with her &quot;subtle portrayal of the heroine—self-protective, then succumbing to a new love—Aimée seemed to create a new kind of femme fatale.&quot;

Film historian Jurgen Muller adds, &quot;whether one likes the film or not, it&#x27;s still hard for anyone to resist the melancholy aura of Anouk Aimée.&quot; In many of her subsequent films, she would continue to play that type of role, &quot;a woman of sensitivity whose emotions are often kept secret.&quot;

She starred in the American film production of &quot;Justine&quot; (1969), costarring Dirk Bogarde and directed by George Cukor and Joseph Strick. The film contained some nudity, with one writer observing, &quot;Anouk is always impeccable, oozing the sexy, detached air of the elite . . . when she drops these trappings, along with her couture clothing, Anouk&#x27;s naked perfection will annihilate you.&quot;

Photojournalist Eve Arnold, assigned to photograph and write a story about Aimée and her role, spoke to Dirk Bogarde, who had known her since she was fifteen. He said that &quot;She is never so happy as when she is miserable between love affairs,&quot; referencing her recent love affair with Omar Sharif, her co-star in &quot;The Appointment&quot; (1969). Arnold photographed Aimée, who talked about her role as the character Justine. Justine was also Jewish. Arnold recalls one of their talks:
Another American film, &quot;La Brava&quot;, starring Dustin Hoffman, was set to be made in 1984 but was never completed. Hoffman at first decided it would play better if he were in love with a younger girl rather than the original story&#x27;s older woman. &quot;Where are you going to get a good-looking older woman?&quot; he asked. He rejected Faye Dunaway, feeling she was &quot;too obvious.&quot; A month later, after a chance meeting with Aimée in Paris, he changed his mind, telling his producer, &quot;I can fall in love with the older woman. I met Anouk Aimée over the weekend. She looks great.&quot; He begged his producer to at least talk to her: &quot;Come on, get on the phone, say hello to her. . . Just listen to her voice, it&#x27;s great.&quot;

Robert Altman, at another time, wanted to use Aimée in a film to be called &quot;Lake Lugano,&quot; about a woman who was a Holocaust survivor returning long after the war. She &quot;loved the script,&quot; according to Altman. However, she backed out after discussing the part with him more thoroughly:

In 2002, she received an honorary César Award, France&#x27;s national film award, and in 2003 received an Honorary Golden Bear at the Berlin International Film Festival. In the 1960s, &quot;Life&quot; magazine called her &quot;the Left Bank&#x27;s most beautiful resident ... after each picture her enigmatic beauty lingered&quot; in the memories of her audience.

In late 2013, the Cinemania film festival in Montreal, Canada, paid tribute to Aimée&#x27;s career.

Aimée reunited with director Claude Lelouch and co-star Jean-Louis Trintignant for a follow-up to &quot;Un homme et une femme&quot; and its sequel, &quot;A Man and a Woman: 20 Years Later&quot; (&quot;Un homme et une femme, 20 ans deja&quot;, 1986) which is her final film. The result, &quot;The Best Years of a Life&quot; (&quot;Les plus belles années d&#x27;une vie&quot;, 2019), was shown at Cannes out of competition. 

==Personal life==
Aimée was married and divorced four times: Édouard Zimmermann (1949–1950), director Nico Papatakis (1951–1954), actor and musical producer Pierre Barouh (1966–1969), and actor Albert Finney (1970–1978). She had one child, Manuela Papatakis (born 1951), from her second marriage. She died at her home in Paris on 18 June 2024, at the age of 92. She was buried privately at the Saint-Vincent Cemetery in Paris on 25 June.

==Status and legacy==
Aimée was nominated for an Oscar as best actress for her role opposite Jean-Louis Trintignant in &quot;A Man and a Woman&quot;, becoming one of a relatively small number of actors to be nominated for a performance in a foreign film.

&quot;The Guardian&quot; film critic Peter Bradshaw wrote in an obituary for her that &quot;The enigma, sensuality and vulnerability of Aimee&#x27;s screen persona are all there in essence – and above all the loneliness that comes with beauty.&quot; According to Bradshaw, &quot;She had something of the young Joan Crawford, or Marlene Dietrich, or her contemporary, the French model and actress Capucine. Aimée radiated an enigmatic sexual aura flavoured with melancholy, sophistication and worldly reserve&quot; and &quot;had a unique screen presence that was at once alluring and forbidding&quot; He wrote about her role in &quot;La dolce vita&quot; that actress&#x27;s &quot;natural hauteur made her a natural for the role and, with her airy detachment and beauty, could be said almost to have invented Italian cinema&#x27;s modish ennui which Michelangelo Antonioni later developed.&quot;

French Culture Minister Rachida Dati tweeted on X: &quot;We bid farewell to a world-famous icon, to a great actress of French cinema who took on roles for some of the biggest names, such as (Jacques) Demy, Lelouch and (Federico) Fellini.&quot;

<text>A lost literary work (referred throughout this article just as a lost work) is a document, literary work, or piece of multimedia, produced of which no surviving copies are known to exist, meaning it can be known only through reference. This term most commonly applies to works from the classical world, although it is increasingly used in relation to modern works. A work may be lost to history through the destruction of an original manuscript and all later copies.

Works—or, commonly, small fragments of works—have survived by being found by archaeologists during investigations, or accidentally by anybody, such as, for example, the Nag Hammadi library scrolls. Works also survived when they were reused as bookbinding materials, quoted or included in other works, or as palimpsests, where an original document is imperfectly erased so the substrate on which it was written can be reused. The discovery, in 1822, of Cicero&#x27;s &quot;De re publica&quot; was one of the first major recoveries of a lost ancient text from a palimpsest. Another famous example is the discovery of the Archimedes Palimpsest, which was used to make a prayer book almost 300 years after the original work was written. A work may be recovered in a library, as a lost or mislabeled codex, or as a part of another book or codex.

Well known but not recovered works are described by that did survive, such as the &quot;Naturalis Historia&quot; of Pliny the Elder or the &quot;De architectura&quot; of Vitruvius. Sometimes authors will destroy their own works. On other occasions, authors instruct others to destroy their work after their deaths. Such instructions are not always followed: Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot; was saved by Augustus, and Kafka&#x27;s novels by Max Brod. Handwritten copies of manuscripts existed in limited numbers before the era of printing. The destruction of ancient libraries, whether by intent, chance or neglect, resulted in the loss of numerous works. Works to which no subsequent reference is preserved remain unknown.

Deliberate destruction of works may be termed &quot;literary crime&quot; or &quot;literary vandalism&quot; (see book burning).

Most of Burr&#x27;s letters and papers from prior to 1812 were subsequently lost in a shipwreck which resulted in Burr being one of the least understood of the American Founding Fathers, especially given that his, in general, morally upstanding life is often overshadowed by his infamous duel with fellow Founding Father Alexander Hamilton who was the less popular, and less liked, of the two. 
* The &quot;Memoirs&quot; of Lord Byron, destroyed by his literary executors led by John Murray on 17 May 1824.

* Margaret Fuller&#x27;s manuscript on the history of the 1849 Roman Republic was lost in the 1850 shipwreck in which Fuller herself, her husband and her child perished. In Fuller&#x27;s own estimation, as well as of others who saw it, this work, based on her first-hand experience in Rome, might have been her most important work. 
* A schoolmate of Arthur Rimbaud claimed that he lost a notebook of poems by the famous poet, the &quot;Cahier Labarrière&quot;, which reportedly contained about 60 poems (if true, and if all were distinct from his known verse poems, this would represent about as much in volume). Paul Verlaine also mentioned a text called &quot;La Chasse spirituelle&quot;, claiming it to be Rimbaud&#x27;s masterpiece, which was never found (although a fake was published in 1949).
* The first draft of Thomas Carlyle&#x27;s &quot;The French Revolution: A History&quot; was sent to John Stuart Mill, whose maid mistakenly burned it, forcing Carlyle to rewrite it from scratch.

* L. Frank Baum&#x27;s theatre in Richburg, New York, burned to the ground. Among the manuscripts of Baum&#x27;s original plays known to have been lost are &quot;The Mackrummins&quot;, &quot;Matches&quot; (which was being performed the night of the fire), &quot;The Queen of Killarney&quot;, &quot;Kilmourne, or O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s Dream&quot;, and the complete musical score for &quot;The Maid of Arran&quot;, which survives only in commercial song sheets, which include six of the eight songs and no instrumental music.

* During the many years of his career, Mark Twain produced a vast number of pieces, of which a considerable part, especially in his earlier years, was published in obscure newspapers under a great variety of pen names, or not published at all. Joe Goodman, who had been Twain&#x27;s editor when he worked at the Virginia City, Nevada, &quot;Territorial Enterprise&quot;, declared in 1900 that Twain wrote some of the best material of his life during his &quot;Western years&quot; in the late 1860s, but most of it was lost. In addition, many of Twain&#x27;s speeches and lectures have been lost or were never written down. Researchers continue to seek this material, some of which was rediscovered as recently as 1995.
* Although frequently referenced in the Oxford English Dictionary and traceable in several catalogues of libraries and booksellers, no copy of the 1852 book &quot;Meanderings of Memory&quot; by Nightlark could be tracked down.
* The Reverend Francis Kilvert&#x27;s diaries were edited and censored, possibly by his widow, after his death in 1879. In the 1930s, the surviving diaries were passed on to William Plomer, who transcribed them, before returning the originals to Kilvert&#x27;s closest living relative, a niece, who destroyed most of the manuscripts. Plomer&#x27;s own transcription was destroyed in the Blitz. He only learned of the originals&#x27; destruction when he planned to publish a complete edition in the 1950s.
* Jean Sibelius&#x27;s &quot;Karelia Music&quot; was destroyed after its premiere in 1893. What survives today fully are the Karelia Ouverture and the Karelia Suite. Most of the music was reconstructed in 1965 by Kalevi Kuosa, from the original parts that had survived. The parts that hadn&#x27;t survived were those of the violas, cellos, and double basses. Based on Kuosa&#x27;s transcription, the Finnish composers Kalevi Aho and Jouni Kaipainen have individually reconstructed the complete music to Karelia Music.
* The musical score to Gilbert and Sullivan’s 1871 opera Thespis has been mostly lost with only 3 musical passages being known to survive.

* Various parts of Daniel Paul Schreber&#x27;s &quot;Memoirs of My Nervous Illness&quot; (original German title &quot;Denkwürdigkeiten eines Nervenkranken&quot;) (1903) were destroyed by his wife and doctor Flesching for protecting his reputation, which was mentioned by Sigmund Freud as highly important in his essay &quot;The Schreber Case&quot; (1911).
* L. Frank Baum wrote four novels for adults that were never published and disappeared: &quot;Our Married Life&quot; and &quot;Johnson&quot; (1912), &quot;The Mystery of Bonita&quot; (1914), and &quot;Molly Oodle&quot; (1915). Baum&#x27;s son claimed that Baum&#x27;s wife burned these, but this was after being cut out of her will. Evidence that Baum&#x27;s publisher received these manuscripts survives. Also lost are Baum&#x27;s 1904 short stories &quot;Mr. Rumple&#x27;s Chill&quot; and &quot;Bess of the Movies&quot;, as well as his early plays &quot;Kilmourne, or O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s Dream&quot; (opened April 4, 1883) and &quot;The Queen of Killarney&quot; (1883).
* In 1907, August Strindberg destroyed a play, &quot;The Bleeding Hand&quot;, immediately after writing it. He was in a bad mood at the time and commented in a letter that the piece was unusually harsh, even for him.

* Franz Kafka&#x27;s last lover, Dora Diamant, ignored his wishes to have his works destroyed posthumously. Instead she kept some 20 notebooks and 35-36 letters. The Gestapo in 1933 seized all papers in her home, including these notebooks and letters, in their search to find communist propaganda. Only three of these letters have been discovered since. Furthermore, when Max Brod, Kafka&#x27;s literary executor who similarly ignored his wishes, died in 1968, he left Kafka&#x27;s papers to his secretary, who left them to her daughters. The papers then passed into the ownership of the National Library of Israel in 2016. After a lengthy legal dispute between the library and the daughters, many of these papers have yet to be published. 
* Yogananda&#x27;s &quot;Autobiography of a Yogi&quot; quotes extensively from Richard Wright&#x27;s travel diaries in 1935/6. Following Wright&#x27;s death they have become &#x27;lost&#x27;.
* In 1938 George Orwell wrote &quot;Socialism and War&quot;, an &quot;anti-war pamphlet&quot; for which he could not find a publisher. Although many previously unknown letters and other documents relating to Orwell have been discovered in recent years, no trace of this pamphlet has yet come to light. With the beginning of World War II Orwell&#x27;s views on pacifism were to change radically, so he may well have destroyed the manuscript.

<text>Hanging is killing a person by suspending them from the neck with a noose or ligature. Hanging has been a standard method of capital punishment since the Middle Ages, and has been the primary execution method in numerous countries and regions. The first known account of execution by hanging is in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;. Hanging is also a method of suicide.

There are numerous methods of hanging in execution that instigate death either by cervical fracture or by strangulation.

===Short drop===
The short drop is a method of hanging in which the condemned prisoner stands on a raised support, such as a stool, ladder, cart, horse, or other vehicle, with the noose around the neck. The support is then moved away, leaving the person dangling from the rope.

Suspended by the neck, the weight of the body tightens the noose around the neck, effecting strangulation and death. Loss of consciousness is typically rapid and death ensues in a few minutes.

Before 1850, the short drop was the standard method of hanging, and it is still common in suicides and extrajudicial hangings (such as lynchings and summary executions) which lack the specialised equipment and drop-length calculation tables used in the newer methods.
==== Pole method ====

A short-drop variant is the Austro-Hungarian &quot;pole&quot; method, called (literally: strangling gallows), in which the following steps take place:

# The condemned is made to stand before a specialized vertical pole or pillar, approximately in height.
# A rope is attached around the condemned&#x27;s feet and routed through a pulley at the base of the pole.
# The condemned is hoisted to the top of the pole by means of a sling running across the chest and under the armpits.
# A narrow-diameter noose is looped around the prisoner&#x27;s neck, then secured to a hook mounted at the top of the pole.
# The chest sling is released, and the prisoner is rapidly jerked downward by the assistant executioners via the foot rope, thus resulting in strangulation and death. 

This method was later also adopted by the successor states, most notably by Czechoslovakia, where the &quot;pole&quot; method was used as the single type of execution from 1918 until 1954, when the prison hosting Czechoslovakia&#x27;s executions, Pankrác Prison, constructed an indoor gallows that exclusively accommodated short-drop hangings to replace the pole method. Nazi war criminal Karl Hermann Frank, executed in 1946 in Prague, was among approximately 1,000 condemned people executed by the pole hanging method in Czechoslovakia.

===Standard drop===

The standard drop involves a drop of between and came into use from 1866, when the scientific details were published by Irish doctor Samuel Haughton. Its use rapidly spread to English-speaking countries and those with judicial systems of English origin.

It was considered a humane improvement on the short drop because it was intended to be enough to break the person&#x27;s neck, causing immediate unconsciousness and rapid brain death.

This method was used to execute condemned Nazis under United States jurisdiction after the Nuremberg Trials, including Joachim von Ribbentrop and Ernst Kaltenbrunner. In the execution of Ribbentrop, historian Giles MacDonogh records that: &quot;The hangman botched the execution and the rope throttled the former foreign minister for 20 minutes before he expired.&quot; A &quot;Life&quot; magazine report on the execution merely says: &quot;The trap fell open and with a sound midway between a rumble and a crash, Ribbentrop disappeared. The rope quivered for a time, then stood tautly straight.&quot;

===Long drop===

The long-drop process, also known as the measured drop, was introduced to Britain in 1872 by William Marwood as a scientific advance on the standard drop, and further refined by his successor James Berry. Instead of everyone falling the same standard distance, the person&#x27;s height and weight were used to determine how much slack would be provided in the rope so that the distance dropped would be enough to ensure that the neck was broken, but not so much that the person was decapitated. Careful placement of the eye or knot of the noose (so that the head was jerked back as the rope tightened) contributed to breaking the neck.

Prior to 1892, the drop was in the range of , depending on the weight of the body, and was calculated to deliver an energy of , which fractured the neck at either the 2nd and 3rd or 4th and 5th cervical vertebrae. This force resulted in some decapitations, such as the infamous case of Black Jack Ketchum in New Mexico Territory in 1901, owing to a significant weight gain while in custody not having been factored into the drop calculations. Between 1892 and 1913, the length of the drop was shortened to avoid decapitation. After 1913, other factors were also taken into account, and the energy delivered was reduced to about .

The decapitation of Eva Dugan during a botched hanging in 1930 led the state of Arizona to switch to the gas chamber as its primary execution method, on the grounds that it was believed more humane. One of the more recent decapitations as a result of the long drop occurred when Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti was hanged in Iraq in 2007. Accidental decapitation also occurred during the 1962 hanging of Arthur Lucas, one of the last two people put to death in Canada.

Nazis executed under British jurisdiction, including Josef Kramer, Fritz Klein, Irma Grese and Elisabeth Volkenrath, were hanged by Albert Pierrepoint using the variable-drop method devised by Marwood. The record speed for a British long-drop hanging was seven seconds from the executioner entering the cell to the drop. Speed was considered to be important in the British system as it reduced the condemned&#x27;s mental distress.

Long-drop hanging is still practiced as the method of execution in a few countries, including Japan and Singapore.

==As suicide==

Hanging is a common suicide method. The materials necessary for suicide by hanging are readily available to the average person, compared with firearms or poisons. Full suspension is not required, and for this reason, hanging is especially commonplace among suicidal prisoners . A type of hanging comparable to full suspension hanging may be obtained by self-strangulation using a ligature around the neck and the partial weight of the body (partial suspension) to tighten the ligature. When a suicidal hanging involves partial suspension the deceased is found to have both feet touching the ground, e.g., they are kneeling, crouching or standing. Partial suspension or partial weight-bearing on the ligature is sometimes used, particularly in prisons, mental hospitals or other institutions, where full suspension support is difficult to devise, because high ligature points (e.g., hooks or pipes) have been removed.

In Canada, hanging is the most common method of suicide, and in the U.S., hanging is the second most common method, after self-inflicted gunshot wounds. In the United Kingdom, where firearms are less easily available, in 2001 hanging was the most common method among men and the second most commonplace among women (after poisoning).

Those who survive a suicide-via-hanging attempt, whether due to breakage of the cord or ligature point, or being discovered and cut down, face a range of serious injuries, including cerebral anoxia (which can lead to permanent brain damage), laryngeal fracture, cervical spine fracture (which may cause paralysis), tracheal fracture, pharyngeal laceration, and carotid artery injury.

==As human sacrifice==
There are some suggestions that the Vikings practised hanging as human sacrifices to Odin, to honour Odin&#x27;s own sacrifice of hanging himself from Yggdrasil. In Northern Europe, it is widely speculated that the Iron Age bog bodies, many of which show signs of having been hanged, were examples of human sacrifice to the gods.

==Medical effects==
A hanging may induce one or more of the following medical conditions, some leading to death:
* Closure of carotid arteries causing cerebral hypoxia
* Closure of the jugular veins
* Breaking of the neck (cervical fracture) causing traumatic spinal cord injury or even unintended decapitation
* Closure of the airway

The cause of death in hanging depends on the conditions related to the event. When the body is released from a relatively high position, the major cause of death is severe trauma to the upper cervical spine. The injuries produced are highly variable. One study showed that only a small minority of a series of judicial hangings produced fractures to the cervical spine (6 out of 34 cases studied), with half of these fractures (3 out of 34) being the classic &quot;hangman&#x27;s fracture&quot; (bilateral fractures of the pars interarticularis of the C2 vertebra). 

According to &quot;Historical and biomechanical aspects of hangman&#x27;s fracture&quot;, the phrase in the usual execution order, &quot;hanged by the neck until dead&quot;, was necessary. 

The side, or subaural knot, has been shown to produce other, more complex injuries, with one thoroughly studied case producing only ligamentous injuries to the cervical spine and bilateral vertebral artery disruptions, but no major vertebral fractures or crush injuries to the spinal cord. 

In the absence of fracture and dislocation, occlusion of blood vessels becomes the major cause of death, rather than asphyxiation. Obstruction of venous drainage of the brain via occlusion of the internal jugular veins leads to cerebral oedema and then cerebral ischemia. The face will typically become engorged and cyanotic (turned blue through lack of oxygen).
Compromise of the cerebral blood flow may occur by obstruction of the carotid arteries, even though their obstruction requires far more force than the obstruction of jugular veins, since they are seated deeper and they contain blood in much higher pressure compared to the jugular veins.

==Notable practices across the globe==

Hanging has been a method of capital punishment in many countries, and is still used by many countries to this day. Long-drop hanging is mainly used by former British colonies, while short-drop and suspension hanging is common elsewhere, in countries including Iran and Afghanistan. 

===Afghanistan===

Hanging is the most used form of capital punishment in Afghanistan.

===Australia===

Capital punishment was a part of the legal system of Australia from the establishment of New South Wales as a British penal colony, until 1985, by which time all Australian states and territories had abolished the death penalty. In practice, the last execution in Australia was the hanging of Ronald Ryan on 3 February 1967, in Victoria.

During the 19th century, crimes that could carry a death sentence included burglary, sheep theft, forgery, sexual assaults, murder and manslaughter. During the 19th century, there were roughly eighty people hanged every year throughout the Australian colonies for these crimes.

===Bahamas===

The Bahamas employs hanging to execute the condemned, but no executions have been conducted in the country since 2000. As of 2023, there have been some inmates on death row but their sentences have been commuted.

===Bangladesh===

Hanging is the only method of execution in Bangladesh, ever since its independence.

===Brazil===

Death by hanging was the customary method of capital punishment in Brazil throughout its history. Some important national heroes like Tiradentes (1792) were killed by hanging. The last man executed in Brazil was the slave Francisco, in 1876. The death penalty was abolished for all crimes, except for those committed under extraordinary circumstances such as war or military law, in 1890.

===Bulgaria===

Bulgaria&#x27;s national hero, Vasil Levski, was executed by hanging by the Ottoman court in Sofia in 1873. Every year since Bulgaria&#x27;s liberation, thousands come with flowers on the date of his death, 19 February, to his monument where the gallows stood. The last execution was in 1989, and the death penalty was abolished for all crimes in 1998.

===Canada===

Historically, hanging was the only method of execution used in Canada and was in use as possible punishment for all murders until 1961, when murders were reclassified into capital and non-capital offences. The death penalty was restricted to apply only for certain offences to the National Defence Act in 1976 and was completely abolished in 1998. The last hangings in Canada took place on 11 December 1962.

===Egypt===

In 1955, Egypt hanged three Israelis on charges of spying. In 1982 Egypt hanged three civilians convicted of the assassination of Anwar Sadat. In 2004, Egypt hanged five militants on charges of trying to kill the Prime Minister. To this day, hanging remains the standard method of capital punishment in Egypt, which executes more people each year than any other African country.

===Germany===


In the territories occupied by Nazi Germany from 1939 to 1945, strangulation hanging was a preferred means of public execution, although more criminal executions were performed by guillotine than hanging. The most commonly sentenced were partisans and black marketeers, whose bodies were usually left hanging for long periods. There are also numerous reports of concentration camp inmates being hanged. Hanging was continued in post-war Germany in the British and US Occupation Zones under their jurisdiction, and for Nazi war criminals, until well after (western) Germany itself had abolished the death penalty by the Basic Law (constitution) as adopted in 1949. West Berlin was not subject to the Basic Law and abolished the death penalty in 1951. The German Democratic Republic abolished the death penalty in 1987. The last execution ordered by a West German court was carried out by guillotine in Moabit prison in 1949. The last hanging in Germany was the one ordered of several war criminals in Landsberg am Lech on 7 June 1951. The last known execution in East Germany was in 1981 by a pistol shot to the neck.

===Hong Kong===
Even though Hong Kong is now part of China, it has no capital punishment; it is a special administrative region of China. When Hong Kong was still a part of the British Empire, it had hanging as the method of execution. The last person who was executed was a Chinese Vietnamese man who attacked a security guard and another person. This execution occurred in 1966.

===Hungary===

The prime minister of Hungary, during the 1956 Revolution, Imre Nagy, was secretly tried, executed by hanging, and buried unceremoniously by the new Soviet-backed Hungarian government, in 1958. Nagy was later publicly exonerated by Hungary. Capital punishment was abolished for all crimes in 1990.

===India===
Hanging was introduced by the British. All executions in India since independence have been carried out by hanging, although the law provides for military executions to be carried out by firing squad. In 1949, Nathuram Godse, who had been sentenced to death for the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi, was the first person to be executed by hanging in independent India.

The Supreme Court of India has suggested that capital punishment should be given only in the &quot;rarest of rare cases&quot;.

Since 2001, eight people have been executed in India.
* Dhananjoy Chatterjee, convicted for rape and murder in 1991, was executed on 14 August 2004 in Alipore Jail, Kolkata.
* Ajmal Kasab, the lone surviving terrorist of the 2008 Mumbai attacks, was executed on 21 November 2012 in Yerwada Central Jail, Pune. The Supreme Court of India had previously rejected his mercy plea, which was then rejected by the President of India. He was hanged one week later.
* Afzal Guru, a terrorist found guilty of conspiracy in the December 2001 attack on the Indian Parliament, was executed by hanging in Tihar Jail, Delhi on 9 February 2013.
* Yakub Memon was convicted over his involvement in the 1993 Bombay bombings by the Special Terrorist and Disruptive Activities court on 27 July 2007. His appeals and petitions for clemency were all rejected and he was finally executed by hanging on 30 July 2015 in Nagpur jail.
* In March 2020, four prisoners convicted of rape and murder were executed by hanging in Tihar Jail.

===Iran===
Death by hanging is the primary means of capital punishment in Iran, which carries out one of the highest numbers of annual executions in the world. The method used is the short drop, which does not break the neck of the condemned, but rather causes a slower death due to strangulation. It is legal for murder, rape, and drug trafficking unless the criminal pays diyya to the victim&#x27;s family, thus attaining their forgiveness . If the presiding judge deems the case to be &quot;causing public outrage&quot;, he can order the hanging to take place in public at the spot where the crime was committed, typically from a mobile telescoping crane which hoists the condemned high into the air. On 19 July 2005, two boys, Mahmoud Asgari and Ayaz Marhoni, aged 15 and 17 respectively, who had been convicted of the rape of a 13-year-old boy, were hanged at Edalat (Justice) Square in Mashhad, on charges of homosexuality and rape. On 15 August 2004, a 16-year-old girl, Atefeh Sahaaleh (also called Atefeh Rajabi), was executed for having committed &quot;acts incompatible with chastity&quot;.

At dawn on 27 July 2008, the Iranian government executed 29 people at Evin Prison in Tehran. On 2 December 2008, an unnamed man was hanged for murder at Kazeroun Prison, just moments after he was pardoned by the murder victim&#x27;s family. He was quickly cut down and rushed to a hospital, where he was successfully revived.

The conviction and hanging of Reyhaneh Jabbari caused international uproar as she was sentenced to death in 2009 and hanged on 25 October 2014 for murdering a former intelligence officer; according to Jabbari&#x27;s testimony she stabbed him during an attempted rape and then another person killed him.

===Iraq===
Hanging was used under the regime of Saddam Hussein, but was suspended along with capital punishment on 10 June 2003, when a coalition led by the United States invaded and overthrew the previous regime. The death penalty was reinstated on 8 August 2004.

In September 2005, three murderers were the first people to be executed since the restoration. Then on 9 March 2006, an official of Iraq&#x27;s Supreme Judicial Council confirmed that Iraqi authorities had executed the first insurgents by hanging.

Saddam Hussein was sentenced to death by hanging for crimes against humanity on 5 November 2006, and was executed on 30 December 2006 at approximately 6:00 a.m. local time. During the drop, there was an audible crack indicating that his neck was broken, a successful example of a long-drop hanging.

Barzan Ibrahim, the head of the Mukhabarat, Saddam&#x27;s security agency, and Awad Hamed al-Bandar, former chief judge, were executed on 15 January 2007, also by the long-drop method, but Barzan was decapitated by the rope at the end of his fall.

Former vice-president Taha Yassin Ramadan had been sentenced to life in prison on 5 November 2006, but the sentence was changed to death by hanging on 12 February 2007. He was the fourth and final man to be executed for the 1982 crimes against humanity on 20 March 2007. The execution went smoothly.

At the Anfal genocide trial, Saddam&#x27;s cousin Ali Hassan al-Majid (nicknamed Chemical Ali by Iraqis), former defence minister Sultan Hashim Ahmed al-Tay, and former deputy Hussein Rashid Mohammed were sentenced to hang for their role in the Al-Anfal Campaign against the Kurds on 24 June 2007. Al-Majid was sentenced to death three more times: once for the 1991 suppression of a Shi&#x27;a uprising along with Abdul-Ghani Abdul Ghafur on 2 December 2008; once for the 1999 crackdown in the assassination of Grand Ayatollah Mohammad al-Sadr on 2 March 2009; and once on 17 January 2010 for the gassing of the Kurds in 1988; he was hanged on 25 January.

On 26 October 2010, Saddam&#x27;s top minister Tariq Aziz was sentenced to hang for persecuting the members of rival Shi&#x27;a political parties. His sentence was commuted to indefinite imprisonment after Iraqi president Jalal Talabani did not sign his execution order and he died in prison in 2015.

On 14 July 2011, US forces transferred condemned prisoners Sultan Hashim Ahmed al-Tay and two of Saddam&#x27;s half-brothers, Sabawi Ibrahim al-Tikriti and Watban Ibrahim al-Tikriti, to Iraqi authorities for execution. The Iraqi High Tribunal had sentenced Saddam&#x27;s half-brothers to death on 11 March 2009 for their roles in the executions of 42 traders who were accused of manipulating food prices. None of the three men were executed.

It is alleged that Iraq&#x27;s government keeps the execution rate secret, and hundreds may be carried out every year. In 2007, Amnesty International stated that 900 people were at &quot;imminent risk&quot; of execution in Iraq.

===Israel===

Israel has provisions in its criminal law to use the death penalty for extraordinary crimes. It has been used only twice for Israelis, and only one of those executions was by hanging. On 31 May 1962, Nazi leader Adolf Eichmann was captured, taken to Israel and then executed by hanging.

===Japan===

All executions in Japan are carried out by hanging.

On 23 December 1948, Hideki Tojo, Kenji Doihara, Akira Mutō, Iwane Matsui, Seishirō Itagaki, Kōki Hirota, and Heitaro Kimura were hanged at Sugamo Prison by the U.S. occupation authorities in Ikebukuro in Allied-occupied Japan for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and crimes against peace during the Asian-Pacific theatre of World War II.

On 27 February 2004, the mastermind of the Sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway, Shoko Asahara, was found guilty and sentenced to death by hanging. On 25 December 2006, serial killer Hiroaki Hidaka and three others were hanged in Japan. Long-drop hanging is the method of carrying out judicial capital punishment on civilians in Japan, as in the cases of Norio Nagayama, Mamoru Takuma, and Tsutomu Miyazaki. In 2018 Shoko Asahara and several of his cult members were hanged for committing the 1995 sarin gas attack.

===Jordan===
Hanging is the traditional method of capital punishment in Jordan. On 14 August 1993, Jordan hanged two Jordanians convicted of spying for Israel. Sajida al-Rishawi, the &quot;4th bomber&quot; of the 2005 Amman bombings, was executed by hanging alongside Ziad al-Karbouly on 4 February 2015, while she was in the process of appealing her sentence for terrorism offences, in retribution for the immolation of Jordanian pilot Muath Al-Kasasbeh.

=== Kuwait ===
Kuwait has always used hanging for execution. During the Gulf War, Iraqi government officials executed different people for different reasons. After the war, Kuwait hanged Iraqi collaborators. Sometimes the executions are in public. The most recent executions were in 2022.

===Lebanon===
Lebanon hanged two men in 1998 for murdering a man and his sister. However, capital punishment ended up being altogether suspended in Lebanon, as a result of staunch opposition by activists and some political factions.

===Liberia===

On 16 February 1979, seven men convicted of the ritual killing of the popular Kru traditional singer Moses Tweh were publicly hanged at dawn in Harper.

===Malaysia===

Hanging is the traditional method of capital punishment in Malaysia and has been used to execute people convicted of murder, drug trafficking and waging war against the government. The Barlow and Chambers execution was carried out as a result of new tighter drug regulations.

===Pakistan===

In Pakistan, hanging is the most common form of execution.

===Portugal===

The last person executed by hanging in Portugal was Francisco Matos Lobos on 16 April 1842. Before that, it had been a common death penalty.

===Russia===

Hanging was commonly practised in the Russian Empire during the rule of the Romanov dynasty as an alternative to impalement, which was used in the 15th and 16th centuries.

Hanging was abolished in 1868 by Alexander II after serfdom, but was restored by the time of his death and his assassins were hanged. While those sentenced to death for murder were usually pardoned and sentences commuted to life imprisonment, those guilty of high treason were usually executed. This also included the Grand Duchy of Finland and Kingdom of Poland under the Russian crown. Taavetti Lukkarinen became the last Finn to be executed this way. He was hanged for espionage and high treason in 1916.

The hanging was usually performed by short drop in public. The gallows were usually either a stout nearby tree branch, as in the case of Lukkarinen, or a makeshift gallows constructed for the purpose.

After the October Revolution in 1917, capital punishment was, on paper, abolished, but continued to be used unabated against people perceived to be enemies of the regime. Under the Bolsheviks, most executions were performed by shooting, either by firing squad or by a single firearm. In 1943, hanging was restored primarily for German servicemen and native collaborators for atrocities committed against Soviet POWs and civilians. The last to be hanged were Andrey Vlasov and his companions in 1946.

===Singapore===

In Singapore, long-drop hanging is currently used as a mandatory punishment for crimes such as drug trafficking, murder and some types of kidnapping. It was introduced by the British, when they occupied Singapore and neighbouring Malaysia. It has also been used for punishing those convicted of unauthorised discharging of firearms.

===Sri Lanka===

Hanging was abolished in Sri Lanka in 1956, but in 1959 it was brought back and later halted in 1978. In 1975, the day before the execution of Maru Sira, he had been overdosed by the prison guards to prevent him from escaping. On the day of his execution he was unconscious, so when he was brought to the gallows, he was slumped over on the trapdoor with a noose around his neck, and when the executioner pulled the lever, his execution was botched and he strangled.

===Syria===

Syria has publicly hanged people, such as two individuals in 1952, Israeli spy Eli Cohen in 1965, and a number of Jews accused of spying for Israel in 1969.

According to a 19th-century report, members of the Alawite sect centred on Lattakia in Syria had a particular aversion towards being hanged, and the family of the condemned was willing to pay &quot;considerable sums&quot; to ensure its relations were impaled, instead of being hanged. As far as Burckhardt could make out, this attitude was based upon the Alawites&#x27; idea that the soul ought to leave the body through the mouth, rather than leave it in any other fashion.

The Islamic State also used hanging post-mortem, after they executed alleged spies for the western-backed coalition in Deir ez-Zor by cutting their throats in a slaughterhouse, during the Islamic holiday of Eid al-Adha in 2016. They also used shooting, beheading, fire and other methods to execute people during their rule.

===United Kingdom===

As a form of judicial execution in England, hanging is thought to date from the Anglo-Saxon period. Records of the names of British hangmen begin with Thomas de Warblynton in the 1360s; complete records extend from the 16th century to the last hangmen, Robert Leslie Stewart and Harry Allen, who conducted the last British executions in 1964.

Until 1868 hangings were performed in public. In London, the traditional site was at Tyburn, a settlement west of the City on the main road to Oxford, which was used on eight hanging days a year, though before 1865, executions had been transferred to the street outside Newgate Prison, Old Bailey, now the site of the Central Criminal Court.

Three British subjects were hanged after World War II after having been convicted of having helped Nazi Germany in its war against Britain. John Amery, the son of prominent British politician Leo Amery, became an expatriate in the 1930s, moving to France. He became involved in pre-war fascist politics, remained in what became Vichy France following France&#x27;s defeat by Germany in 1940 and eventually went to Germany and later the German puppet state in Italy headed by Benito Mussolini. Captured by Italian partisans at the end of the war and handed over to British authorities, Amery was accused of having made propaganda broadcasts for the Nazis and of having attempted to recruit British prisoners of war for a Waffen SS regiment later known as the British Free Corps. Amery pleaded guilty to treason charges on 28 November 1945 and was hanged at Wandsworth Prison on 19 December 1945. William Joyce, an American-born Irishman who had lived in Britain and possessed a British passport, had been involved in pre-war fascist politics in the UK, fled to Nazi Germany just before the war began to avoid arrest by British authorities and became a naturalised German citizen. He made propaganda broadcasts for the Nazis, becoming infamous under the nickname Lord Haw-Haw. Captured by British forces in May 1945, he was tried for treason later that year. Although Joyce&#x27;s defence argued that he was by birth American and thus not subject to being tried for treason, the prosecution successfully argued that Joyce&#x27;s pre-war British passport meant that he was a subject of the British Crown and he was convicted. After his appeals failed, he was hanged at Wandsworth Prison on 3 January 1946. Theodore Schurch, a British soldier captured by the Nazis who then began working for the Italian and German intelligence services by acting as a spy and informer who would be placed among other British prisoners, was arrested in Rome in March 1945 and tried under the Treachery Act 1940. After his conviction, he was hanged at HM Prison Pentonville on 4 January 1946.

The Homicide Act 1957 created the new offence of capital murder, punishable by death, with all other murders being punishable by life imprisonment.

In 1965, Parliament passed the Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act, temporarily abolishing capital punishment for murder for five years. The Act was renewed in 1969, making the abolition permanent. With the passage of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 and the Human Rights Act 1998, the death penalty was officially abolished for all crimes in both civilian and military cases. Following its complete abolition, the gallows were removed from Wandsworth Prison, where they remained in full working order until that year.

The last woman to be hanged was Ruth Ellis on 13 July 1955, by Albert Pierrepoint who was a prominent hangman in the 20th century in England. The last hangings in Britain took place in 1964, when Peter Anthony Allen was executed at Walton Prison in Liverpool. Gwynne Owen Evans was executed by Harry Allen at Strangeways Prison in Manchester. Both were executed for the murder of John Alan West.

Hanging was also the method used in many colonies and overseas territories.

====Silken rope====
In the UK, some felons are traditionally said to have been executed by hanging with a silken rope:
* Hereditary peers who committed capital offences, as anticipated by the fictional Duke of Denver, brother of Lord Peter Wimsey. The Duke was accused of murder in the novel &quot;Clouds of Witness&quot;, and this execution would have been his fate, after conviction by his peers in a trial in the House of Lords. It has been claimed that the execution of Earl Ferrers in 1760 – the only time a peer was hanged after trial by the House of Lords – was carried out with the normal hempen rope instead of a silk one. The writ of execution does not specify a silk rope be used, and &quot;The Newgate Calendar&quot; makes no mention of the use of such an item – an unusual omission given its highly sensationalist nature.
* Those who have the Freedom of the City of London.

===United States===

Hanging was one means by which Puritans of the Massachusetts Bay Colony enforced religious and intellectual conformity on the whole community. The best known hanging carried out by the Puritans, Mary Dyer, was one of the four executed Quakers known as the Boston martyrs.

Capital punishment in the U.S. varies from state to state; it is outlawed in some states but used in most others. However, the death penalty under federal law is applicable in every state. Hanging is no longer used as a method of execution.

When Black pastor Denmark Vesey of the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church was suspected of plotting to launch a slave rebellion in Charleston, South Carolina in 1822, 35 people, including Vesey, were judged guilty by a city-appointed court and were subsequently hanged, and the church was burned down.

The Dakota War of 1862, also known as the Dakota uprising, led to the largest mass execution in the United States when 38 Sioux Indians, who were facing starvation and displacement, attacked white settlers, for which they were sentenced to death via hanging in Mankato, Minnesota in December 1862. Originally, 303 had been sentenced to hang, but the convictions were reviewed by President Abraham Lincoln and the sentences of all but 38 were commuted. In 2019, Governor Tim Walz issued an historic apology to the Dakota people for the mass hanging and the &quot;trauma inflicted on Native people at the hands of state government&quot;.

A total of 40 suspected Unionists were hanged in Gainesville, Texas, in October 1862. On 7 July 1865, four people involved in the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln—Mary Surratt, Lewis Powell, David Herold, and George Atzerodt—were hanged at Fort McNair in Washington, D.C.
While relatively uncommon, hanging in chains has also been practiced (mainly during the colonial era), the first being a slave after the New York Slave Revolt of 1712. The last hanging in chains was in 1913, of John Marshall in West Virginia for murder. The last public hanging in the United States (not including lynching, one of the last of which was Michael Donald in 1981) took place on 14 August 1936, in Owensboro, Kentucky. Rainey Bethea was executed for the rape and murder of 70-year-old Lischa Edwards. The execution was presided over by the first female sheriff in Kentucky, Florence Shoemaker Thompson.

In California, Clinton Duffy, who served as warden of San Quentin State Prison between 1940 and 1952, presided over ninety executions. He began to oppose the death penalty, and after his retirement, wrote a memoir entitled &quot;Eighty-Eight Men and Two Women&quot; in support of the movement to abolish the death penalty. The book documents several hangings gone wrong and describes how they led his predecessor, Warden James B. Holohan, to persuade the California Legislature to replace hanging with the gas chamber in 1937.

Various methods of capital punishment have been replaced by lethal injection in most states and the federal government. Many states that offered hanging as an option have since eliminated the method. Condemned murderer Victor Feguer became the last inmate to be executed by hanging in the state of Iowa on 15 March 1963. Hanging was the preferred method of execution for capital murder cases in Iowa until 1965, when the death penalty was abolished and replaced with life imprisonment without parole. Barton Kay Kirkham was the last person to be hanged in Utah, preferring it over execution by firing squad. Laws in Delaware were changed in 1986 to specify lethal injection, except for those convicted before 1986 (who were still allowed to choose hanging). If a choice was not made, or the convict refused to choose injection, then hanging would become the default method. This was the case in the 1996 execution of Billy Bailey, the most recent hanging in American history; since then, no Delaware prisoner fit the category, and the state&#x27;s gallows were later dismantled.

====Upright jerker====

The upright jerker is a method of hanging that originated in the United States in the late 19th century. The person to be hanged is jerked into the air by weights and pulleys. It proved to be ineffective at breaking the neck of the condemned, and death by asphyxiation often occurred. In the United States, use of the method ceased in the late 1930s. However, Iran continues to intermittently employ a variant of this method, using a crane rather than a specially-designed mechanism of pulleys. The method has received heavy criticism from human rights organizations and the European Union.

==Inverted hanging, the &quot;Jewish&quot; punishment==

A completely different principle of hanging is to hang the convicted person from their legs, rather than from their neck, either as a form of torture, or as an execution method. In late medieval Germany, this came to be primarily associated with Jews accused of being thieves, called the (). The jurist Ulrich Tengler, in his from 1509, describes the procedure as follows, in the section (&quot;On the punishment of Jews&quot;):

 showed that originally, this type of inverted hanging between two dogs was not a punishment specifically for Jews. Esther Cohen writes:

In Spain 1449, during a mob attack against the Marranos (Jews nominally converted to Christianity), the Jews resisted, but lost and several of them were hanged up by the feet. The first attested German case for a Jew being hanged by the feet is from 1296, in present-day Soultzmatt. Some other historical examples of this type of hanging within the German context are one Jew in Hennegau 1326, two Jews hanged in Frankfurt in 1444, one in Halle in 1462, one in Dortmund in 1486, one in Hanau in 1499, one in Breslau in 1505, one in Württemberg in 1553, one in Bergen in 1588, one in Öttingen in 1611, one in Frankfurt in 1615 and again in 1661, and one condemned to this punishment in Prussia in 1637.

The details of the cases vary widely: In the 1444 Frankfurt cases and the 1499 Hanau case, the dogs were dead prior to being hanged, and in the late 1615 and 1661 cases in Frankfurt, the Jews (and dogs) were merely kept in this torture for half an hour, before being garroted from below. In the 1588 Bergen case, all three victims were left hanging till they were dead, ranging from 6 to 8 days after being hanged. In the Dortmund 1486 case, the dogs bit the Jew to death while hanging. In the 1611 Öttingen case, the Jew &quot;Jacob the Tall&quot; thought to blow up the with gunpowder after having burgled it. He was strung up between two dogs, and a large fire was made close to him, and he expired after half an hour under this torture. In the 1553 Württemberg case, the Jew chose to convert to Christianity after hanging like this for 24 hours; he was then given the mercy to be hanged in the ordinary manner, from the neck, and without the dogs beside him. In the 1462 Halle case, the Jew Abraham also converted after 24 hours hanging upside down, and a priest went up on a ladder and baptised him. For two more days, Abraham was left hanging, while the priest argued with the city council that a true Christian should not be punished in this way. On the third day, Abraham was granted a reprieve, and was taken down, but died 20 days later in the local hospital having meanwhile suffered in extreme pain. In the 1637 case, where the Jew had murdered a Christian jeweller, the appeal to the empress was successful, and out of mercy, the Jew was condemned to be merely pinched with glowing pincers, have hot lead dripped into his wounds, and then be broken alive on the wheel.

Some of the reported cases may be myths, or wandering stories. The 1326 Hennegau case, for example, deviates from the others in that the Jew was not a thief, but was suspected (even though he was a convert to Christianity) of having struck an al fresco painting of Virgin Mary, so that blood had begun to seep down the wall from the painting. Even under all degrees of judicial torture, the Jew denied performing this sacrilegious act, and was therefore exonerated. Then a brawny smith demanded from him a trial by combat, because, supposedly, in a dream the Virgin herself had besought the smith to do so. The court accepted the smith&#x27;s challenge, he easily won the combat against the Jew, who was duly hanged up by the feet between two dogs. To add to the injury, one let him be slowly roasted as well as hanged. This is a very similar story to one told in France, in which a young Jew threw a lance at the head of a statue of the Virgin, so that blood spurted out of it. There was inadequate evidence for a normal trial, but a frail old man asked for trial by combat, and bested the young Jew. The Jew confessed his crime, and was hanged by his feet between two mastiffs.

The features of the earliest attested case, that of a Jewish thief hanged by the feet in Soultzmatt in 1296 are also rather divergent from the rest. The Jew managed somehow, after he had been left to die, to twitch his body in such a manner that he could hoist himself up on the gallows and free himself. At that time, his feet were so damaged that he was unable to escape, and when he was discovered 8 days after he had been hanged, he was strangled to death by the townspeople.

As late as in 1699 in Celle, the courts were sufficiently horrified at how the Jewish leader of a robber gang (condemned to be hanged in the normal manner) declared blasphemies against Christianity, that they made a ruling on the &quot;post mortem&quot; treatment of Jonas Meyer. After three days, his corpse was cut down, his tongue cut out, and his body was hanged up again, but this time from its feet.

===Punishment for traitors===
Guido Kisch writes that the first instance he knows where a person in Germany was hanged up by his feet between two dogs until he died occurred about 1048, some 250 years earlier than the first attested Jewish case. This was a knight called Arnold, who had murdered his lord; the story is contained in Adam of Bremen&#x27;s &quot;History of the Archbishops of Hamburg-Bremen&quot;. Another example of a non-Jew who suffered this punishment as a torture, in 1196 Richard, Count of Acerra, was one of those executed by Henry VI in the suppression of the rebelling Sicilians:

A couple of centuries earlier, in France in 991, a viscount Walter nominally owing his allegiance to the French King Hugh Capet chose, on instigation of his wife, to join the rebellion under Odo I, Count of Blois. When Odo found out he had to abandon Melun after all, Walter was duly hanged before the gates, whereas his wife, the fomentor of treason, was hanged by her feet, causing much merriment and jeers from Hugh&#x27;s soldiers as her clothes fell downwards revealing her naked body, although it is not wholly clear if she died in that manner.

===Elizabethan maritime law===
During Queen Elizabeth I&#x27;s reign, the following was written concerning those who stole a ship from the Royal Navy:

==Hanging by the ribs==

In 1713, Juraj Jánošík, a semi-legendary Slovak outlaw and folk hero, was sentenced to be hanged from his left rib. He was left to slowly die.

The German physician Gottlob Schober (1670–1739), who worked in Russia from 1712, notes that a person could hang from the ribs for about three days prior to expiring, his primary pain being that of extreme thirst. He thought this degree of insensitivity was something peculiar to the Russian mentality.

The Dutch in Suriname were also in the habit of hanging a slave from the ribs, a custom amongst the African tribes from whom they were originally purchased. John Gabriel Stedman stayed in South America from 1772 to 1777 and described the method as told by a witness:

William Blake was specially commissioned to make illustrations to Stedman&#x27;s narrative.

==Grammar==
The standard past tense and past participle form of the verb &quot;hang&quot;, in the sense of this article, is &quot;hanged&quot;, although some dictionaries give &quot;hung&quot; as an alternative.

<doc id="155023" wikidata="Q275456" url="?curid=155023" title="Textual criticism">
<text>Textual criticism is a branch of textual scholarship, philology, and literary criticism that is concerned with the identification of textual variants, or different versions, of either manuscripts (mss) or of printed books. Such texts may range in dates from the earliest writing in cuneiform, impressed on clay, for example, to multiple unpublished versions of a 21st-century author&#x27;s work. Historically, scribes who were paid to copy documents may have been literate, but many were simply copyists, mimicking the shapes of letters without necessarily understanding what they meant. This means that unintentional alterations were common when copying manuscripts by hand. Intentional alterations may have been made as well, for example, the censoring of printed work for political, religious or cultural reasons.

The objective of the textual critic&#x27;s work is to provide a better understanding of the creation and historical transmission of the text and its variants. This understanding may lead to the production of a critical edition containing a scholarly curated text. If a scholar has several versions of a manuscript but no known original, then established methods of textual criticism can be used to seek to reconstruct the original text as closely as possible. The same methods can be used to reconstruct intermediate versions, or recensions, of a document&#x27;s transcription history, depending on the number and quality of the text available.

On the other hand, the one original text that a scholar theorizes to exist is referred to as the urtext (in the context of Biblical studies), archetype or autograph; however, there is not necessarily a single original text for every group of texts. For example, if a story was spread by oral tradition, and then later written down by different people in different locations, the versions can vary greatly.

There are many approaches or methods to the practice of textual criticism, notably eclecticism, stemmatics, and copy-text editing. Quantitative techniques are also used to determine the relationships between witnesses to a text, called textual witnesses, with methods from evolutionary biology (phylogenetics) appearing to be effective on a range of traditions.

In some domains, such as religious and classical text editing, the phrase &quot;lower criticism&quot; refers to textual criticism and &quot;higher criticism&quot; to the endeavor to establish the authorship, date, and place of composition of the original text.

== History ==
Textual criticism has been practiced for over two thousand years, as one of the philological arts. Early textual critics, especially the librarians of Hellenistic Alexandria in the last two centuries BC, were concerned with preserving the works of antiquity, and this continued through the Middle Ages into the early modern period and the invention of the printing press. Textual criticism was an important aspect of the work of many Renaissance humanists, such as Desiderius Erasmus, who edited the Greek New Testament, creating what developed as the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot;. In Italy, scholars such as Petrarch and Poggio Bracciolini collected and edited many Latin manuscripts, while a new spirit of critical enquiry was boosted by the attention to textual states, for example in the work of Lorenzo Valla on the purported Donation of Constantine.

Many ancient works, such as the Bible and the Greek tragedies, survive in hundreds of copies, and the relationship of each copy to the original may be unclear. Textual scholars have debated for centuries which sources are most closely derived from the original, hence which readings in those sources are correct. Although texts such as Greek plays presumably had one original, the question of whether some biblical books, like the Gospels, ever had just one original has been discussed. Interest in applying textual criticism to the Quran has also developed after the discovery of the Sana&#x27;a manuscripts in 1972, which possibly date back to the seventh to eighth centuries.

In the English language, the works of William Shakespeare have been a particularly fertile ground for textual criticism—both because the texts, as transmitted, contain a considerable amount of variation, and because the effort and expense of producing superior editions of his works have always been widely viewed as worthwhile. The principles of textual criticism, although originally developed and refined for works of antiquity and the Bible, and, for Anglo-American Copy-Text editing, Shakespeare, have been applied to many works, from (near-)contemporary texts to the earliest known written documents. Ranging from ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt to the twentieth century, textual criticism covers a period of about five millennia.

== Basic notions and objectives ==
The basic problem, as described by Paul Maas, is as follows:
Maas comments further that &quot;A dictation revised by the author must be regarded as equivalent to an autograph manuscript&quot;. The lack of autograph manuscripts applies to many cultures other than Greek and Roman. In such a situation, a key objective becomes the identification of the first &quot;exemplar&quot; before any split in the tradition. That exemplar is known as the &quot;archetype&quot;. &quot;If we succeed in establishing the text of [the archetype], the &quot;constitutio&quot; (reconstruction of the original) is considerably advanced.&quot;

The textual critic&#x27;s ultimate objective is the production of a &quot;critical edition&quot;. This contains the text that the author has determined most closely approximates the original, and is accompanied by an &quot;apparatus criticus&quot; or critical apparatus. The critical apparatus presents the author&#x27;s work in three parts: first, a list or description of the evidence that the editor used (names of manuscripts, or abbreviations called sigla); second, the editor&#x27;s analysis of that evidence (sometimes a simple likelihood rating),; and third, a record of rejected variants of the text (often in order of preference).

== Process ==

Before inexpensive mechanical printing, literature was copied by hand, and many variations were introduced by copyists. The age of printing made the scribal profession effectively redundant. Printed editions, while less susceptible to the proliferation of variations likely to arise during manual transmission, are nonetheless not immune to introducing variations from an author&#x27;s autograph. Instead of a scribe miscopying his source, a compositor or a printing shop may read or typeset a work in a way that differs from the autograph. Since each scribe or printer commits different errors, reconstruction of the lost original is often aided by a selection of readings taken from many sources. An edited text that draws from multiple sources is said to be &quot;eclectic&quot;. In contrast to this approach, some textual critics prefer to identify the single best surviving text, and not to combine readings from multiple sources.

When comparing different documents, or &quot;witnesses&quot;, of a single, original text, the observed differences are called &quot;variant readings&quot;, or simply &quot;variants&quot; or &quot;readings&quot;. It is not always apparent which single variant represents the author&#x27;s original work. The process of textual criticism seeks to explain how each variant may have entered the text, either by accident (duplication or omission) or intention (harmonization or censorship), as scribes or supervisors transmitted the original author&#x27;s text by copying it. The textual critic&#x27;s task, therefore, is to sort through the variants, eliminating those most likely to be &quot;un&quot;-original, hence establishing a critical text, or critical edition, that is intended to best approximate the original. At the same time, the critical text should document variant readings, so the relation of extant witnesses to the reconstructed original is apparent to a reader of the critical edition. In establishing the critical text, the textual critic considers both &quot;external&quot; evidence (the age, provenance, and affiliation of each witness) and &quot;internal&quot; or &quot;physical&quot; considerations (what the author and scribes, or printers, were likely to have done).

The collation of all known variants of a text is referred to as a variorum, namely a work of textual criticism whereby all variations and emendations are set side by side so that a reader can track how textual decisions have been made in the preparation of a text for publication. The Bible and the works of William Shakespeare have often been the subjects of variorum editions, although the same techniques have been applied with less frequency to many other works, such as Walt Whitman&#x27;s &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot;,
and the prose writings of Edward Fitzgerald.

In practice, citation of manuscript evidence implies any of several methodologies. The ideal, but most costly, method is physical inspection of the manuscript itself; alternatively, published photographs or facsimile editions may be inspected. This method involves paleographical analysis—interpretation of handwriting, incomplete letters and even reconstruction of lacunae. More typically, editions of manuscripts are consulted, which have done this paleographical work already.

== Eclecticism ==
Eclecticism refers to the practice of consulting a wide diversity of witnesses to a particular original. The practice is based on the principle that the more independent transmission histories there are, the less likely they will be to reproduce the same errors. What one omits, the others may retain; what one adds, the others are unlikely to add. Eclecticism allows inferences to be drawn regarding the original text, based on the evidence of contrasts between witnesses.

Eclectic readings also normally give an impression of the number of witnesses to each available reading. Although a reading supported by the majority of witnesses is frequently preferred, this does not follow automatically. For example, a second edition of a Shakespeare play may include an addition alluding to an event known to have happened between the two editions. Although nearly all subsequent manuscripts may have included the addition, textual critics may reconstruct the original without the addition.

The result of the process is a text with readings drawn from many witnesses. It is not a copy of any particular manuscript, and may deviate from the majority of existing manuscripts. In a purely eclectic approach, no single witness is theoretically favored. Instead, the critic forms opinions about individual witnesses, relying on both external and internal evidence.

Since the mid-19th century, eclecticism, in which there is no &quot;a priori&quot; bias to a single manuscript, has been the dominant method of editing the Greek text of the New Testament (currently, the United Bible Society, 5th ed. and Nestle-Åland, 28th ed.). Even so, the oldest manuscripts, being of the Alexandrian text-type, are the most favored, and the critical text has an Alexandrian disposition.

=== External evidence ===
External evidence is evidence of each physical witness, its date, source, and relationship to other known witnesses. Critics will often prefer the readings supported by the oldest witnesses. Since errors tend to accumulate, older manuscripts should have fewer errors. Readings supported by a majority of witnesses are also usually preferred, since these are less likely to reflect accidents or individual biases. For the same reasons, the most geographically diverse witnesses are preferred. Some manuscripts show evidence that particular care was taken in their composition, for example, by including alternative readings in their margins, demonstrating that more than one prior copy (exemplar) was consulted in producing the current one. Other factors being equal, these are the &quot;best&quot; witnesses. The role of the textual critic is necessary when these basic criteria are in conflict. For instance, there will typically be fewer early copies, and a larger number of later copies. The textual critic will attempt to balance these criteria, to determine the original text.

There are many other more sophisticated considerations. For example, readings that depart from the known practice of a scribe or a given period may be deemed more reliable, since a scribe is unlikely on his own initiative to have departed from the usual practice.

=== Internal evidence ===
Internal evidence is evidence that comes from the text itself, independent of the physical characteristics of the document. Various considerations can be used to decide which reading is the most likely to be original. Sometimes these considerations can be in conflict.

Two common considerations have the Latin names &quot;lectio brevior&quot; (shorter reading) and &quot;lectio difficilior&quot; (more difficult reading). The first is the general observation that scribes tended to add words, for clarification or out of habit, more often than they removed them. The second, &quot;lectio difficilior potior&quot; (the harder reading is stronger), recognizes the tendency for harmonization—resolving apparent inconsistencies in the text. Applying this principle leads to taking the more difficult (unharmonized) reading as being more likely to be the original. Such cases also include scribes simplifying and smoothing texts they did not fully understand.

Another scribal tendency is called homoioteleuton, meaning &quot;similar endings&quot;. Homoioteleuton occurs when two words/phrases/lines end with the similar sequence of letters. The scribe, having finished copying the first, skips to the second, omitting all intervening words. &quot;Homoioarche&quot; refers to eye-skip when the &quot;beginnings&quot; of two lines are similar.

The critic may also examine the other writings of the author to decide what words and grammatical constructions match his style. The evaluation of internal evidence also provides the critic with information that helps him evaluate the reliability of individual manuscripts. Thus, the consideration of internal and external evidence is related.

After considering all relevant factors, the textual critic seeks the reading that best explains how the other readings would arise. That reading is then the most likely candidate to have been original.

=== Canons of textual criticism ===

Various scholars have developed guidelines, or &quot;canons&quot; of textual criticism, to guide the exercise of the critic&#x27;s judgment in determining the best readings of a text. One of the earliest was Johann Albrecht Bengel (1687–1752), who in 1734 produced an edition of the Greek New Testament. In his commentary, he established the rule &quot;Proclivi scriptioni praestat ardua&quot;, (&quot;the harder reading is to be preferred&quot;).

Johann Jakob Griesbach (1745–1812) published several editions of the New Testament. In his 1796 edition, he established fifteen critical rules. Among them was a variant of Bengel&#x27;s rule, &quot;Lectio difficilior potior&quot;, &quot;the harder reading is better.&quot; Another was &quot;Lectio brevior praeferenda&quot;, &quot;the shorter reading is better&quot;, based on the idea that scribes were more likely to add than to delete. This rule cannot be applied uncritically, as scribes may omit material inadvertently.

Brooke Foss Westcott (1825–1901) and Fenton Hort (1828–1892) published an edition of the New Testament in Greek in 1881. They proposed nine critical rules, including a version of Bengel&#x27;s rule, &quot;The reading is less likely to be original that shows a disposition to smooth away difficulties.&quot; They also argued that &quot;Readings are approved or rejected by reason of the quality, and not the number, of their supporting witnesses&quot;, and that &quot;The reading is to be preferred that most fitly explains the existence of the others.&quot;

Many of these rules, although originally developed for biblical textual criticism, have wide applicability to any text susceptible to errors of transmission.

=== Limitations of eclecticism ===

Since the canons of criticism are highly susceptible to interpretation, and at times even contradict each other, they may be employed to justify a result that fits the textual critic&#x27;s aesthetic or theological agenda. Starting in the 19th century, scholars sought more rigorous methods to guide editorial judgment. Stemmatics and copy-text editing – while both eclectic, in that they permit the editor to select readings from multiple sources – sought to reduce subjectivity by establishing one or a few witnesses presumably as being favored by &quot;objective&quot; criteria. The citing of sources used, and alternate readings, and the use of original text and images helps readers and other critics determine to an extent the depth of research of the critic, and to independently verify their work.

== Stemmatics ==
=== Overview ===

Stemmatics or stemmatology is a rigorous approach to textual criticism. Karl Lachmann (1793–1851) greatly contributed to making this method famous, even though he did not invent it. The method takes its name from the word &quot;stemma&quot;. The Ancient Greek word and its loanword in classical Latin may refer to &quot;family trees&quot;. This specific meaning shows the relationships of the surviving witnesses (the first known example of such a stemma, albeit without the name, dates from 1827). The family tree is also referred to as a &quot;cladogram&quot;. The method works from the principle that &quot;community of error implies community of origin&quot;. That is, if two witnesses have a number of errors in common, it may be presumed that they were derived from a common intermediate source, called a &quot;hyparchetype&quot;. Relations between the lost intermediates are determined by the same process, placing all extant manuscripts in a family tree or &quot;stemma codicum&quot; descended from a single &quot;archetype&quot;. The process of constructing the stemma is called &quot;recension&quot;, or the Latin &quot;recensio&quot;.

Having completed the stemma, the critic proceeds to the next step, called &quot;selection&quot; or &quot;selectio&quot;, where the text of the archetype is determined by examining variants from the closest hyparchetypes to the archetype and selecting the best ones. If one reading occurs more often than another at the same level of the tree, then the dominant reading is selected. If two competing readings occur equally often, then the editor uses judgment to select the correct reading.

After &quot;selectio&quot;, the text may still contain errors, since there may be passages where no source preserves the correct reading. The step of &quot;examination&quot;, or &quot;examinatio&quot; is applied to find corruptions. Where the editor concludes that the text is corrupt, it is corrected by a process called &quot;emendation&quot;, or &quot;emendatio&quot; (also sometimes called &quot;divinatio&quot;). Emendations not supported by any known source are sometimes called &quot;conjectural&quot; emendations.

The process of &quot;selectio&quot; resembles eclectic textual criticism, but applied to a restricted set of hypothetical hyparchetypes. The steps of &quot;examinatio&quot; and &quot;emendatio&quot; resemble copy-text editing. In fact, the other techniques can be seen as special cases of stemmatics in which a rigorous family history of the text cannot be determined but only approximated. If it seems that one manuscript is by far the best text, then copy text editing is appropriate, and if it seems that a group of manuscripts are good, then eclecticism on that group would be proper.

The Hodges–Farstad edition of the Greek New Testament attempts to use stemmatics for some portions.

=== Phylogenetics ===

Phylogenetics is a technique borrowed from biology, where it was originally named &quot;phylogenetic systematics&quot; by Willi Hennig. In biology, the technique is used to determine the evolutionary relationships between different species. In its application in textual criticism, the text of a number of different witnesses may be entered into a computer, which records all the differences between them, or derived from an existing apparatus. The manuscripts are then grouped according to their shared characteristics. The difference between phylogenetics and more traditional forms of statistical analysis is that, rather than simply arranging the manuscripts into rough groupings according to their overall similarity, phylogenetics assumes that they are part of a branching family tree and uses that assumption to derive relationships between them. This makes it more like an automated approach to stemmatics. However, where there is a difference, the computer does not attempt to decide which reading is closer to the original text, and so does not indicate which branch of the tree is the &quot;root&quot;—which manuscript tradition is closest to the original. Other types of evidence must be used for that purpose.

Phylogenetics faces the same difficulty as textual criticism: the appearance of characteristics in descendants of an ancestor other than by direct copying (or miscopying) of the ancestor, for example where a scribe combines readings from two or more different manuscripts (&quot;contamination&quot;). The same phenomenon is widely present among living organisms, as instances of horizontal gene transfer (or lateral gene transfer) and genetic recombination, particularly among bacteria. Further exploration of the applicability of the different methods for coping with these problems across both living organisms and textual traditions is a promising area of study.

Software developed for use in biology has been applied successfully to textual criticism; for example, it is being used by the Canterbury Tales Project to determine the relationship between the 84 surviving manuscripts and four early printed editions of &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;. Shaw&#x27;s edition of Dante&#x27;s &quot;Commedia&quot; uses phylogenetic and traditional methods alongside each other in a comprehensive exploration of relations among seven early witnesses to Dante&#x27;s text.

=== Limitations and criticism ===

The stemmatic method assumes that each witness is derived from one, and only one, predecessor. If a scribe refers to more than one source when creating her or his copy, then the new copy will not clearly fall into a single branch of the family tree. In the stemmatic method, a manuscript that is derived from more than one source is said to be &quot;contaminated&quot;.

The method also assumes that scribes only make new errorsthey do not attempt to correct the errors of their predecessors. When a text has been improved by the scribe, it is said to be &quot;sophisticated&quot;, but &quot;sophistication&quot; impairs the method by obscuring a document&#x27;s relationship to other witnesses, and making it more difficult to place the manuscript correctly in the stemma.

The stemmatic method requires the textual critic to group manuscripts by commonality of error. It is required, therefore, that the critic can distinguish erroneous readings from correct ones. This assumption has often come under attack. W. W. Greg noted: &quot;That if a scribe makes a mistake he will inevitably produce nonsense is the tacit and wholly unwarranted assumption.&quot;

Franz Anton Knittel defended the traditional point of view in theology and was against the modern textual criticism. He defended an authenticity of the Pericopa Adulterae (John 7:53–8:11), Comma Johanneum (1 John 5:7), and Testimonium Flavianum. According to him, Erasmus in his Novum Instrumentum omne did not incorporate the &quot;Comma&quot; from Codex Montfortianus, because of grammar differences, but used Complutensian Polyglotta. According to him, the &quot;Comma&quot; was known for Tertullian.

The stemmatic method&#x27;s final step is &quot;emendatio&quot;, also sometimes referred to as &quot;conjectural emendation&quot;. But, in fact, the critic employs conjecture at every step of the process. Some of the method&#x27;s rules that are designed to reduce the exercise of editorial judgment do not necessarily produce the correct result. For example, where there are more than two witnesses at the same level of the tree, normally the critic will select the dominant reading. However, it may be no more than fortuitous that more witnesses have survived that present a particular reading. A plausible reading that occurs less often may, nevertheless, be the correct one.

Lastly, the stemmatic method assumes that every extant witness is derived, however remotely, from a single source. It does not account for the possibility that the original author may have revised her or his work, and that the text could have existed at different times in more than one authoritative version.

==Best-text editing==

The critic Joseph Bédier (1864–1938), who had worked with stemmatics, launched an attack on that method in 1928. He surveyed editions of medieval French texts that were produced with the stemmatic method, and found that textual critics tended overwhelmingly to produce bifid trees, divided into just two branches. He concluded that this outcome was unlikely to have occurred by chance, and that therefore, the method was tending to produce bipartite stemmas regardless of the actual history of the witnesses. He suspected that editors tended to favor trees with two branches, as this would maximize the opportunities for editorial judgment (as there would be no third branch to &quot;break the tie&quot; whenever the witnesses disagreed). He also noted that, for many works, more than one reasonable stemma could be postulated, suggesting that the method was not as rigorous or as scientific as its proponents had claimed.

Bédier&#x27;s doubts about the stemmatic method led him to consider whether it could be dropped altogether. As an alternative to stemmatics, Bédier proposed a Best-text editing method, in which a single textual witness, judged to be of a &#x27;good&#x27; textual state by the editor, is emended as lightly as possible for manifest transmission mistakes, but left otherwise unchanged. This makes a Best-text edition essentially a documentary edition. For an example one may refer to Eugene Vinaver&#x27;s edition of the Winchester Manuscript of Malory&#x27;s &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;.

== Copy-text editing ==
When copy-text editing, the scholar fixes errors in a base text, often with the help of other witnesses. Often, the base text is selected from the oldest manuscript of the text, but in the early days of printing, the copy text was often a manuscript that was at hand.

Using the copy-text method, the critic examines the base text and makes corrections (called emendations) in places where the base text appears wrong to the critic. This can be done by looking for places in the base text that do not make sense or by looking at the text of other witnesses for a superior reading. Close-call decisions are usually resolved in favor of the copy-text.

The first published, printed edition of the Greek New Testament was produced by this method. Erasmus, the editor, selected a manuscript from the local Dominican monastery in Basle and corrected its obvious errors by consulting other local manuscripts. The Westcott and Hort text, which was the basis for the Revised Version of the English bible, also used the copy-text method, using the Codex Vaticanus as the base manuscript.

=== McKerrow&#x27;s concept of copy-text ===

The bibliographer Ronald B. McKerrow introduced the term &quot;copy-text&quot; in his 1904 edition of the works of Thomas Nashe, defining it as &quot;the text used in each particular case as the basis of mine&quot;. McKerrow was aware of the limitations of the stemmatic method, and believed it was more prudent to choose one particular text that was thought to be particularly reliable, and then to emend it only where the text was obviously corrupt. The French critic Joseph Bédier likewise became disenchanted with the stemmatic method, and concluded that the editor should choose the best available text, and emend it as little as possible.

In McKerrow&#x27;s method as originally introduced, the copy-text was not necessarily the earliest text. In some cases, McKerrow would choose a later witness, noting that &quot;if an editor has reason to suppose that a certain text embodies later corrections than any other, and at the same time has no ground for disbelieving that these corrections, or some of them at least, are the work of the author, he has no choice but to make that text the basis of his reprint&quot;.

By 1939, in his &quot;Prolegomena for the Oxford Shakespeare&quot;, McKerrow had changed his mind about this approach, as he feared that a later editioneven if it contained authorial correctionswould &quot;deviate more widely than the earliest print from the author&#x27;s original manuscript&quot;. He therefore concluded that the correct procedure would be &quot;produced by using the earliest &#x27;good&#x27; print as copy-text and inserting into it, from the first edition which contains them, such corrections as appear to us to be derived from the author&quot;. But, fearing the arbitrary exercise of editorial judgment, McKerrow stated that, having concluded that a later edition had substantive revisions attributable to the author, &quot;we must accept all the alterations of that edition, saving any which seem obvious blunders or misprints&quot;.

=== W. W. Greg&#x27;s rationale of copy-text ===

Anglo-American textual criticism in the last half of the 20th century came to be dominated by a landmark 1950 essay by Sir Walter W. Greg, &quot;The Rationale of Copy-Text&quot;. Greg proposed:

Greg observed that compositors at printing shops tended to follow the &quot;substantive&quot; readings of their copy faithfully, except when they deviated unintentionally; but that &quot;as regards accidentals they will normally follow their own habits or inclination, though they may, for various reasons and to varying degrees, be influenced by their copy&quot;.

He concluded:

Greg&#x27;s view, in short, was that the &quot;copy-text can be allowed no over-riding or even preponderant authority so far as substantive readings are concerned&quot;. The choice between reasonable competing readings, he said:

Although Greg argued that editors should be free to use their judgment to choose between competing substantive readings, he suggested that an editor should defer to the copy-text when &quot;the claims of two readings ... appear to be exactly balanced. ... In such a case, while there can be no logical reason for giving preference to the copy-text, in practice, if there is no reason for altering its reading, the obvious thing seems to be to let it stand.&quot; The &quot;exactly balanced&quot; variants are said to be &quot;indifferent&quot;.

Editors who follow Greg&#x27;s rationale produce &quot;eclectic&quot; editions, in that the authority for the &quot;accidentals&quot; is derived from one particular source (usually the earliest one) that the editor considers to be authoritative, but the authority for the &quot;substantives&quot; is determined in each individual case according to the editor&#x27;s judgment. The resulting text, except for the accidentals, is constructed without relying predominantly on any one witness.

=== Greg–Bowers–Tanselle ===

W. W. Greg did not live long enough to apply his rationale of copy-text to any actual editions of works. His rationale was adopted and significantly expanded by Fredson Bowers (1905–1991). Starting in the 1970s, G. Thomas Tanselle vigorously took up the method&#x27;s defense and added significant contributions of his own. Greg&#x27;s rationale as practiced by Bowers and Tanselle has come to be known as the &quot;Greg–Bowers&quot; or the &quot;Greg–Bowers–Tanselle&quot; method.

==== Application to works of all periods ====

In his 1964 essay, &quot;Some Principles for Scholarly Editions of Nineteenth-Century American Authors&quot;, Bowers said that &quot;the theory of copy-text proposed by Sir Walter Greg rules supreme&quot;. Bowers&#x27;s assertion of &quot;supremacy&quot; was in contrast to Greg&#x27;s more modest claim that &quot;My desire is rather to provoke discussion than to lay down the law&quot;.

Whereas Greg had limited his illustrative examples to English Renaissance drama, where his expertise lay, Bowers argued that the rationale was &quot;the most workable editorial principle yet contrived to produce a critical text that is authoritative in the maximum of its details whether the author be Shakespeare, Dryden, Fielding, Nathaniel Hawthorne, or Stephen Crane. The principle is sound without regard for the literary period.&quot; For works where an author&#x27;s manuscript survived—a case Greg had not considered—Bowers concluded that the manuscript should generally serve as copy-text. Citing the example of Nathaniel Hawthorne, he noted:

Following Greg, the editor would then replace any of the manuscript readings with substantives from printed editions that could be reliably attributed to the author: &quot;Obviously, an editor cannot simply reprint the manuscript, and he must substitute for its readings any words that he believes Hawthorne changed in proof.&quot;

==== Uninfluenced final authorial intention ====

McKerrow had articulated textual criticism&#x27;s goal in terms of &quot;our ideal of an author&#x27;s fair copy of his work in its final state&quot;. Bowers asserted that editions founded on Greg&#x27;s method would &quot;represent the nearest approximation in every respect of the author&#x27;s final intentions.&quot; Bowers stated similarly that the editor&#x27;s task is to &quot;approximate as nearly as possible an inferential authorial fair copy.&quot; Tanselle notes that, &quot;Textual criticism ... has generally been undertaken with a view to reconstructing, as accurately as possible, the text finally intended by the author&quot;.

Bowers and Tanselle argue for rejecting textual variants that an author inserted at the suggestion of others. Bowers said that his edition of Stephen Crane&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Maggie&quot;, presented &quot;the author&#x27;s final and uninfluenced artistic intentions.&quot; In his writings, Tanselle refers to &quot;unconstrained authorial intention&quot; or &quot;an author&#x27;s uninfluenced intentions.&quot; This marks a departure from Greg, who had merely suggested that the editor inquire whether a later reading &quot;is one that the author can reasonably be supposed to have substituted for the former&quot;, not implying any further inquiry as to &quot;why&quot; the author had made the change.

Tanselle discusses the example of Herman Melville&#x27;s &quot;Typee&quot;. After the novel&#x27;s initial publication, Melville&#x27;s publisher asked him to soften the novel&#x27;s criticisms of missionaries in the South Seas. Although Melville pronounced the changes an improvement, Tanselle rejected them in his edition, concluding that &quot;there is no evidence, internal or external, to suggest that they are the kinds of changes Melville would have made without pressure from someone else.&quot;

Bowers confronted a similar problem in his edition of &quot;Maggie&quot;. Crane originally printed the novel privately in 1893. To secure commercial publication in 1896, Crane agreed to remove profanity, but he also made stylistic revisions. Bowers&#x27;s approach was to preserve the stylistic and literary changes of 1896, but to revert to the 1893 readings where he believed that Crane was fulfilling the publisher&#x27;s intention rather than his own. There were, however, intermediate cases that could reasonably have been attributed to either intention, and some of Bowers&#x27;s choices came under fire—both as to his judgment, and as to the wisdom of conflating readings from the two different versions of &quot;Maggie&quot;.

Hans Zeller argued that it is impossible to tease apart the changes Crane made for literary reasons and those made at the publisher&#x27;s insistence:

Bowers and Tanselle recognize that texts often exist in more than one authoritative version. Tanselle argues that:

He suggests that where a revision is &quot;horizontal&quot; (&quot;i.e.&quot;, aimed at improving the work as originally conceived), then the editor should adopt the author&#x27;s later version. But where a revision is &quot;vertical&quot; (&quot;i.e.&quot;, fundamentally altering the work&#x27;s intention as a whole), then the revision should be treated as a new work, and edited separately on its own terms.

==== Format for apparatus ====

Bowers was also influential in defining the form of critical apparatus that should accompany a scholarly edition. In addition to the &quot;content&quot; of the apparatus, Bowers led a movement to relegate editorial matter to appendices, leaving the critically established text &quot;in the clear&quot;, that is, free of any signs of editorial intervention. Tanselle explained the rationale for this approach:

Some critics believe that a clear-text edition gives the edited text too great a prominence, relegating textual variants to appendices that are difficult to use, and suggesting a greater sense of certainty about the established text than it deserves. As Shillingsburg notes, &quot;English scholarly editions have tended to use notes at the foot of the text page, indicating, tacitly, a greater modesty about the &quot;established&quot; text and drawing attention more forcibly to at least some of the alternative forms of the text&quot;.

==== The MLA&#x27;s CEAA and CSE ====

In 1963, the Modern Language Association of America (MLA) established the Center for Editions of American Authors (CEAA). The CEAA&#x27;s &quot;Statement of Editorial Principles and Procedures&quot;, first published in 1967, adopted the Greg–Bowers rationale in full. A CEAA examiner would inspect each edition, and only those meeting the requirements would receive a seal denoting &quot;An Approved Text.&quot;

Between 1966 and 1975, the Center allocated more than $1.5 million in funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities to various scholarly editing projects, which were required to follow the guidelines (including the structure of editorial apparatus) as Bowers had defined them. According to Davis, the funds coordinated by the CEAA over the same period were more than $6 million, counting funding from universities, university presses, and other bodies.

The Center for Scholarly Editions (CSE) replaced the CEAA in 1976. The change of name indicated the shift to a broader agenda than just American authors. The center also ceased its role in the allocation of funds. The center&#x27;s latest guidelines (2003) no longer prescribe a particular editorial procedure.

== Application to religious documents ==

=== Book of Mormon ===

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) includes the Book of Mormon as a foundational reference. LDS members typically believe the book to be a literal historical record.

Although some earlier unpublished studies had been prepared, not until the early 1970s was true textual criticism applied to the Book of Mormon. At that time BYU Professor Ellis Rasmussen and his associates were asked by the LDS Church to begin preparation for a new edition of the Holy Scriptures. One aspect of that effort entailed digitizing the text and preparing appropriate footnotes; another aspect required establishing the most dependable text. To that latter end, Stanley R. Larson (a Rasmussen graduate student) set about applying modern text critical standards to the manuscripts and early editions of the Book of Mormon as his thesis project—which he completed in 1974. To that end, Larson carefully examined the Original Manuscript (the one dictated by Joseph Smith to his scribes) and the Printer&#x27;s Manuscript (the copy Oliver Cowdery prepared for the Printer in 1829–1830), and compared them with the first, second, and third editions of the Book of Mormon to determine what sort of changes had occurred over time and to make judgments as to which readings were the most original. Larson proceeded to publish a useful set of well-argued articles on the phenomena which he had discovered. Many of his observations were included as improvements in the 1981 LDS edition of the Book of Mormon.

By 1979, with the establishment of the Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies (FARMS) as a California non-profit research institution, an effort led by Robert F. Smith began to take full account of Larson&#x27;s work and to publish a Critical Text of the Book of Mormon. Thus was born the FARMS Critical Text Project which published the first volume of the 3-volume Book of Mormon Critical Text in 1984. The third volume of that first edition was published in 1987, but was already being superseded by a second, revised edition of the entire work, greatly aided through the advice and assistance of then Yale doctoral candidate Grant Hardy, Dr. Gordon C. Thomasson, Professor John W. Welch (the head of FARMS), Professor Royal Skousen, and others too numerous to mention here. However, these were merely preliminary steps to a far more exacting and all-encompassing project.

In 1988, with that preliminary phase of the project completed, Professor Skousen took over as editor and head of the FARMS Critical Text of the Book of Mormon Project and proceeded to gather still scattered fragments of the Original Manuscript of the Book of Mormon and to have advanced photographic techniques applied to obtain fine readings from otherwise unreadable pages and fragments. He also closely examined the Printer&#x27;s Manuscript (owned by the Community of Christ—RLDS Church in Independence, Missouri) for differences in types of ink or pencil, in order to determine when and by whom they were made. He also collated the various editions of the Book of Mormon down to the present to see what sorts of changes have been made through time.

Thus far, Professor Skousen has published complete transcripts of the Original and Printer&#x27;s Manuscripts, as well as a six-volume analysis of textual variants. Still in preparation are a history of the text, and a complete electronic collation of editions and manuscripts (volumes 3 and 5 of the Project, respectively). Yale University has in the meantime published an edition of the Book of Mormon which incorporates all aspects of Skousen&#x27;s research.

=== Hebrew Bible ===

Textual criticism of the Hebrew Bible compares manuscript versions of the following sources (dates refer to the oldest extant manuscripts in each family):

As in the New Testament, changes, corruptions, and erasures have been found, particularly in the Masoretic texts. This is ascribed to the fact that early &quot;soferim&quot; (scribes) did not treat copy errors in the same manner later on.

There are three separate new editions of the Hebrew Bible currently in development: &quot;Biblia Hebraica Quinta&quot;, the &quot;Hebrew University Bible&quot;, and the &quot;Hebrew Bible: A Critical Edition&quot; (formerly known as the &quot;Oxford Hebrew Bible&quot;). &quot;Biblia Hebraica Quinta&quot; is a diplomatic edition based on the Leningrad Codex. The &quot;Hebrew University Bible&quot; is also diplomatic, but based on the Aleppo Codex. The &quot;Hebrew Bible: A Critical Edition&quot; is an eclectic edition.

=== New Testament ===
Early New Testament texts include more than 5,800 Greek manuscripts, 10,000 Latin manuscripts and 9,300 manuscripts in various other ancient languages (including Syriac, Slavic, Ethiopic and Armenian). The manuscripts contain approximately 300,000 textual variants, most of them involving changes of word order and other comparative trivialities. As according to Wescott and Hort:

With regard to the great bulk of the words of the New Testament, as of most other ancient writings, there is no variation or other ground of doubt, and therefore no room for textual criticism... The proportion of words virtually accepted on all hands as raised above doubt is very great, not less, on a rough computation, than seven eights of the whole. The remaining eighth therefore, formed in great part by changes of order and other comparative trivialities, constitutes the whole area of criticism.

Since the 18th century, Protestant New Testament scholars have argued that textual variants by themselves have not affected doctrine. Evangelical theologian D. A. Carson has claimed: &quot;nothing we believe to be doctrinally true, and nothing we are commanded to do, is in any way jeopardized by the variants. This is true for any textual tradition. The interpretation of individual passages may well be called in question; but never is a doctrine affected.&quot;

Historically, attempts have been made to sort new New Testament manuscripts into one of three or four theorized text-types (also styled unhyphenated: text types), or into looser clusters.

However, the sheer number of witnesses presents unique difficulties, chiefly in that it makes stemmatics in many cases impossible, because many copyists used two or more different manuscripts as sources. Consequently, New Testament textual critics have adopted eclecticism. the most common division today is as follows:

=== Quran ===
Textual criticism of the Quran is a beginning area of study, as Muslims have historically disapproved of higher criticism being applied to the Quran. In some countries textual criticism can be seen as apostasy.

Amongst Muslims, the original Arabic text is commonly considered to be the final revelation, revealed to Muhammad from AD 610 to his death in 632. In Islamic tradition, the Quran was memorised and written down by Muhammad&#x27;s companions and copied as needed.

The Quran is believed to have had some oral tradition of passing down at some point. Differences that affected the meaning were noted, and around AD 650 Uthman began a process of standardization, presumably to rid the Quran of these differences. Uthman&#x27;s standardization did not eliminate the textual variants.

In the 1970s, 14,000 fragments of Quran were discovered in the Great Mosque of Sana&#x27;a, the Sana&#x27;a manuscripts. About 12,000 fragments belonged to 926 copies of the Quran, the other 2,000 were loose fragments. The oldest known copy of the Quran so far belongs to this collection: it dates to the end of the seventh to eighth centuries.

The German scholar Gerd R. Puin has been investigating these Quran fragments for years. His research team made 35,000 microfilm photographs of the manuscripts, which he dated to early part of the eighth century. Puin has not published the entirety of his work, but noted unconventional verse orderings, minor textual variations, and rare styles of orthography. He also suggested that some of the parchments were palimpsests which had been reused. Puin believed that this implied an evolving text as opposed to a fixed one.

In an article in the 1999 &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot;, Gerd Puin is quoted as saying that:

Canadian Islamic scholar, Andrew Rippin has likewise stated:
For these reasons, some scholars, especially those who are associated with the Revisionist school of Islamic studies, have proposed that the traditional account of the Quran&#x27;s composition needs to be discarded and a new perspective on the Quran is needed. Puin, comparing Quranic studies with Biblical studies, has stated:
In 2015, some of the earliest known Quranic fragments, containing 62 out of 6236 verses of the Quran and with proposed dating from between approximately AD 568 and 645, were identified at the University of Birmingham. David Thomas, Professor of Christianity and Islam, commented:
David Thomas pointed out that the radiocarbon testing found the death date of the animal whose skin made up the Quran, not the date when the Quran was written. Since blank parchment was often stored for years after being produced, he said the Quran could have been written as late as 650–655, during the Quranic codification under Uthman.

Marijn van Putten, who has published work on idiosyncratic orthography common to all early manuscripts of the Uthmanic text type has stated and demonstrated with examples that due to a number of these same idiosyncratic spellings present in the Birmingham fragment (Mingana 1572a + Arabe 328c), it is &quot;clearly a descendant of the Uthmanic text type&quot; and that it is &quot;impossible&quot; that it is a pre-Uthmanic copy, despite its early radiocarbon dating. Similarly, Stephen J. Shoemaker has also argued that it is extremely unlikely that the Birmingham manuscript was a pre-Uthmanic manuscript.

=== Talmud ===
Textual criticism of the Talmud has a long pre-history but has become a separate discipline from Talmudic study only recently. Much of the research is in Hebrew and German language periodicals.

== Application to other texts ==
=== Classical texts ===
Textual criticism originated in the classical era and its development in modern times began with classics scholars, in an effort to determine the original content of texts like Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot;. There are far fewer witnesses to classical texts than to the Bible, so scholars can use stemmatics and, in some cases, copy text editing. However, unlike the New Testament where the earliest witnesses are within 200 years of the original, the earliest existing manuscripts of most classical texts were written about a millennium after their composition. All things being equal, textual scholars expect that a larger time gap between an original and a manuscript means more changes in the text.

=== &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; ===
== Legal protection ==
Scientific and critical editions can be protected by copyright as works of authorship if enough creativity/originality is provided. The mere addition of a word, or substitution of a term with another one believed to be more correct, usually does not achieve such level of originality/creativity. All the notes accounting for the analysis and why and how such changes have been made represent a different work autonomously copyrightable if the other requirements are satisfied. In the European Union critical and scientific editions may be protected also by the relevant neighboring right that protects critical and scientific publications of public domain works as made possible by art. 5 of the Copyright Term Directive. As of 2011 not all EU member States had transposed art. 5 into national law.

==Digital textual scholarship==
Digital textual criticism is a relatively new branch of textual criticism working with digital tools to establish a critical edition. The development of digital editing tools has allowed editors to transcribe, archive and process documents much faster than before. Some scholars claim digital editing has radically changed the nature of textual criticism; but others believe the editing process has remained fundamentally the same, and digital tools have simply made aspects of it more efficient.

=== History ===
From its beginnings, digital scholarly editing involved developing a system for displaying both a newly &quot;typeset&quot; text and a history of variations in the text under review. Until about halfway through the first decade of the twenty-first century, digital archives relied almost entirely on manual transcriptions of texts. Notable exceptions are the earliest digital scholarly editions published in Budapest in the 1990s. These editions contained high resolution images next to the diplomatic transcription of the texts, as well as a newly typeset text with annotations. These old websites are still available at their original location. Over the course of the early twenty-first century, image files became much faster and cheaper, and storage space and upload times ceased to be significant issues. The next step in digital scholarly editing was the wholesale introduction of images of historical texts, particularly high-definition images of manuscripts, formerly offered only in samples.

=== Methods ===
In view of the need to represent historical texts primarily through transcription, and because transcriptions required encoding for every aspect of text that could not be recorded by a single keystroke on the QWERTY keyboard, encoding was invented. Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) uses encoding for the same purpose, although its particulars were designed for scholarly uses in order to offer some hope that scholarly work on digital texts had a good chance of migrating from aging operating systems and digital platforms to new ones and the hope that standardization would lead to easy interchange of data among different projects.

=== Software ===
Several computer programs and standards exist to support the work of the editors of critical editions. These include
* The Text Encoding Initiative. The Guidelines of the TEI provide much detailed analysis of the procedures of critical editing, including recommendations about how to mark up a computer file containing a text with critical apparatus. See especially the following chapters of the Guidelines: 10. Manuscript Description, 11. Representation of Primary Sources, and 12. Critical Apparatus.
* Juxta is an open-source tool for comparing and collating multiple witnesses to a single textual work. It was designed to aid scholars and editors examine the history of a text from manuscript to print versions. Juxta provides collation for multiple versions of texts that are marked up in plain text or TEI/XML format.
* The EDMAC macro package for Plain TeX is a set of macros originally developed by John Lavagnino and Dominik Wujastyk for typesetting critical editions. &quot;EDMAC&quot; stands for &quot;EDition&quot; &quot;MACros.&quot; EDMAC is in maintenance mode.
* The ledmac package is a development of EDMAC by Peter R. Wilson for typesetting critical editions with LaTeX. ledmac is in maintenance mode.
* The eledmac package is a further development of ledmac by Maïeul Rouquette that adds more sophisticated features and solves more advanced problems. eledmac was forked from ledmac when it became clear that it needed to develop in ways that would compromise backward-compatibility. eledmac is maintenance mode.
* The reledmac package is a further development of eledmac by Maïeul Rouquette that rewrittes many part of the code in order to allow more robust developments in the future. In 2015, it is in active development.
* ednotes, written by Christian Tapp and Uwe Lück is another package for typesetting critical editions using LaTeX.
* Classical Text Editor is a word-processor for critical editions, commentaries and parallel texts written by Stefan Hagel. CTE is designed for use on the Windows operating system, but has been successfully run on Linux and OS/X using Wine. CTE can export files in TEI format. CTE is currently (2014) in active development.
* Critical Edition Typesetter by Bernt Karasch is a system for typesetting critical editions starting from input into a word-processor, and ending up with typesetting with TeX and EDMAC. Development of CET seems to have stopped in 2004.
* ekdosis ekdosis is a LuaLaTeX package developed by Robert Alessi. It is designed for multilingual critical editions. It can be used to typeset texts and different layers of critical notes in any direction accepted by LuaTeX. Texts can be arranged in running paragraphs or on facing pages, in any number of columns which in turn can be synchronized or not. In addition to printed texts, ekdosis can convert .tex source files so as to produce TEI xml-compliant critical editions. See also on CTAN.
