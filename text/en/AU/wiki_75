<text>Nickelodeon (occasionally shortened to Nick) is an American pay television channel and the flagship property of the Nickelodeon Group, a subdivision of the Paramount Media Networks division of Paramount Global. Launched on April 1, 1979, as the first cable channel for children, the channel is primarily aimed at children and adolescents aged 2 to 17, along with a broader family audience through its program blocks.

The channel began life as a test broadcast on December 1, 1977, as part of QUBE, an early cable television system broadcast locally in Columbus, Ohio. The channel, now named Nickelodeon, launched to a new nationwide audience on April 1, 1979, with &quot;Pinwheel&quot; as its inaugural program. The network was initially commercial-free and remained without advertising until 1984. Nickelodeon gained a new facelift regarding programming and image that fall, and its ensuing success led to it and its sister networks MTV and VH1 being sold to Viacom in 1985.

Nickelodeon has expanded its franchise through several sister channels and programming blocks. Nick Jr. launched as preschool morning block on January 4, 1988, and was eventually spun-off into a separate channel in 2009. Nicktoons, based on the flagship branding for its original animated series, launched as a standalone channel in 2002. Noggin, an interactive educational brand created in partnership with Sesame Workshop, existed as a channel from 1999 to 2009 and as a mobile streaming service from 2015 to 2024. Two blocks aimed at teenage audiences, Nickelodeon&#x27;s TEENick and Noggin&#x27;s The N, were merged to form the TeenNick channel in 2009.

, Nickelodeon is available to approximately 70 million pay television households in the United States, down from its peak of 101 million households in 2011.

== History ==

The channel&#x27;s name comes from the first five-cent movie theaters called nickelodeons. Its history dates back to December 1, 1977, when Warner Cable Communications launched the first 2-way interactive cable system, QUBE, in Columbus, Ohio. The C-3 cable channel carried &quot;Pinwheel&quot; daily from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time, and the channel was labelled &quot;Pinwheel&quot; on remote controllers, as it was the only program broadcast. Initially scheduled for a February 1979 launch, Nickelodeon launched on April 1, 1979, initially distributed to Warner Cable systems via satellite on the RCA Satcom-1 transponder. Originally commercial-free, advertising was introduced in January 1984.

== Programming ==

Programming seen on Nickelodeon includes animated series (such as &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;, &quot;The Loud House&quot;, &quot;Middlemost Post&quot;, &quot;The Patrick Star Show&quot;, &quot;Kamp Koral: SpongeBob&#x27;s Under Years&quot;, &quot;The Smurfs&quot;, &quot;Rugrats&quot; and &quot;Monster High&quot;), live-action, scripted series (such as &quot;Danger Force&quot;, &quot;Tyler Perry&#x27;s Young Dylan&quot; and &quot;That Girl Lay Lay&quot;), and original made-for-TV movies, while the network&#x27;s daytime schedule is dedicated to shows targeting preschoolers (such as &quot;Bubble Guppies&quot;, &quot;Paw Patrol&quot;, and &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues &amp; You!&quot;).

A re-occurring program was bi-monthly special editions of &quot;Nick News with Linda Ellerbee&quot;, a news magazine series aimed at children that debuted in 1992 as a weekly series and ended in 2015. In June 2020, Nickelodeon announced that they would bring back &quot;Nick News&quot; in a series of hour-long specials. The first installment, Kids, Race and Unity: A Nick News Special premiered on June 29, 2020, and was hosted by R&amp;B musician Alicia Keys.

Since 2021, Nickelodeon has aired at least one live National Football League game a year, produced by corporate sibling CBS Sports and incorporating elements unique to Nickelodeon into the broadcast such as green slime in the end zone and SpongeBob SquarePants&#x27; face superimposed on the netting of the goalposts. Nickelodeon also carries the weekly shoulder program &quot;NFL Slimetime&quot; during the season which includes similar graphics. Nickelodeon offered the first alternate broadcast of a Super Bowl in 2024 when it aired a &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;-themed simulcast of CBS&#x27; coverage.

=== Nicktoons ===

Nicktoons is the branding for Nickelodeon&#x27;s original animated television series. Until 1991, the animated series that aired on Nickelodeon were largely imported from foreign countries, with some original animated specials that were also featured on the channel up to that point. Though the Nicktoons branding has infrequently been used by the network itself since the 2002 launch of the channel of the same name, original animated series continue to make up a substantial portion of Nickelodeon&#x27;s lineup. Roughly, six to seven hours of these programs are seen on the weekday schedule, and around nine hours on weekends, including a dedicated weekend morning animation block.

In 2006, the channel struck a deal with DreamWorks Animation to develop the studio&#x27;s animated films into television series (such as &quot;The Penguins of Madagascar&quot;). Since the early 2010s, Nickelodeon Animation Studio has also produced series based on preexisting IP purchased by Paramount, such as &quot;Winx Club&quot; and &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;.

=== Movies ===

Nickelodeon has produced a variety of original made-for-TV movies, which usually premiere in weekend evening timeslots or on school holidays. Nickelodeon also periodically acquires theatrically released feature films for broadcast on the channel.

The channel occasionally airs feature films produced by the network&#x27;s Nickelodeon Movies film production division (whose films are distributed by sister company Paramount Pictures). Although the film division bears the Nickelodeon brand name, the channel does not have access to most of the movies produced by its film unit. The majority of the live-action feature films produced under the Nickelodeon Movies banner are licensed for broadcast by various free-to-air and pay television outlets within the United States other than Nickelodeon (although the network has aired a few live-action Nickelodeon Movies releases such as &quot;Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging&quot; and &quot;Good Burger&quot;).

Nickelodeon also advertises hour-long episodes of its original series as movies; though the &quot;TV movie&quot; versions of Nickelodeon&#x27;s original series differ from traditional television films in that they have shorter running times (approximately 45 minutes, as opposed to 75–100 minute run times that most television movies have), and use a traditional multi-camera setup for regular episodes (unless the program is originally shot in the single-camera setup common of films) with some on-location filming.

In 2002, Nickelodeon entered a long-standing broadcast partnership with Mattel to air films and specials based on the toy company&#x27;s Barbie (and later Monster High) dolls. The first Barbie movie to air on Nickelodeon was &quot;Barbie as Rapunzel&quot; on November 24, 2002. The Barbie and Monster High films are usually aired under a brokered format in which Mattel purchases the time in order to promote the release of their films on DVD within a few days of the Nickelodeon premiere, an arrangement possible as Nickelodeon does not have to meet the Federal Communications Commission rules which disallow that arrangement for broadcast channels due to regulations banning paid programming to children.

=== Programming blocks ===

==== Current ====
* Nick Jr. – Nickelodeon currently broadcasts shows targeted at preschool-aged children on Monday through Fridays from 7 a.m. to 2 p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time (7:00 to 10:00 a.m. during the summer months, other designated school break periods, and on national holidays). The block primarily targets audiences of preschool age as Nickelodeon&#x27;s usual audience of school-aged children are in school during the block&#x27;s designated time period. Programs currently seen in this block include &quot;Paw Patrol&quot;, &quot;Peppa Pig&quot; (from the UK), &quot;Blaze and the Monster Machines&quot;, &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Mystery Playdate&quot;, &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues &amp; You!&quot;, &quot;Santiago of the Seas&quot;, and &quot;Baby Shark&#x27;s Big Show!&quot;.
* Nick at Nite – Nickelodeon&#x27;s nighttime programming service, which premiered on July 1, 1985, and broadcasts from prime time to early morning (the block&#x27;s air time varies each night). Originally featured classic sitcoms from the 1950s and 1960s such as &quot;The Donna Reed Show&quot;, &quot;Mr. Ed&quot; and &quot;Lassie&quot;, programming eventually shifted towards repeats of popular sitcoms from the 1980s to the 2000s such as &quot;Home Improvement&quot;, &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; and &quot;Roseanne&quot;. In 1996, a pay television channel, TV Land (formerly Nick at Nite&#x27;s TV Land, until 1997) based on the block, launched with a similar format of programs. Nick at Nite has also occasionally incorporated original scripted and competition series, with some in recent years produced through its parent network&#x27;s Nickelodeon Productions unit. As of 2021, programming on Nick at Nite consists entirely of acquired shows such as &quot;Full House&quot;, &quot;Friends&quot;, &quot;Mom&quot; and &quot;Young Sheldon&quot;. Since 2004, Nielsen has broken out the television ratings of Nick at Nite and Nickelodeon as two separate networks.

==== Former ====
* SNICK – &quot;SNICK&quot; (short for &quot;Saturday Night Nickelodeon&quot;) was the network&#x27;s first dedicated Saturday primetime block that aired from 8:00 to 10:00 p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time. Geared toward preteens and teenagers, it debuted on August 15, 1992 (with the initial lineup featuring two established series that originally aired on Sundays, &quot;Clarissa Explains It All&quot; and &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot;, and two new series, &quot;Roundhouse&quot; and &quot;Are You Afraid of the Dark?&quot;). The block mainly featured live-action series (primarily comedies), although it periodically featured animated series. SNICK was discontinued on January 29, 2005, and was replaced the following week (February 5, 2005) by a Saturday night edition of the TEENick block.
* Nick in the Afternoon – &quot;Nick in the Afternoon&quot; was a daytime block that ran on weekday afternoons during the summer months from 1995 to 1997, and aired in an extended format until December for its final year in 1998. It was hosted by Stick Stickly, a Mr. Bill-like popsicle stick character (puppeteered by Rick Lyon and voiced by actor Paul Christie, who would later voice the Noggin mascot Moose A. Moose). The block was replaced for Summer 1999 by &quot;Henry and June&#x27;s Summer&quot; (hosted by the animated hosts of the anthology series &quot;KaBlam!&quot;). From 2011 to 2012, Stick Stickly returns to television for TeenNick&#x27;s &quot;The &#x27;90s Are All That&quot; to host &quot;U-Pick with Stick&quot; on Friday nights as a concept of user-chosen programming.
* U-Pick Live – &quot;U-Pick Live&quot; (originally branded as &quot;U-Pick Friday&quot; from 1999 to late 2000, and originally hosted by the Henry and June characters from &quot;KaBlam!&quot;) was a block that aired weekday afternoons from 5:00 to 7:00 p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time from October 14, 2002, to May 27, 2005, which was broadcast from studios in New York City&#x27;s Times Square district, where Nickelodeon is headquartered. Using a similar concept that originated in 1994 with the Nick in the Afternoon block, &quot;U-Pick Live&quot; allowed viewer interaction in selecting the programs (usually cartoons) that would air on the block via voting on the network&#x27;s website.
* TEENick – &quot;TEENick&quot; was a teenage-oriented block that ran from March 4, 2001, to February 1, 2009, which ran on Sundays from 6:00 to 9:00 p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time; a secondary block on Saturdays launched in 2005, taking over the 8:00 to 10:00 p.m. Eastern/Pacific timeslot long held by SNICK. It was originally hosted by Nick Cannon, and then by Jason Everhart (aka &quot;J. Boogie&quot;). Beginning in January 2007, Noggin&#x27;s own teenage-targeted block The N ran a spin-off block called &quot;TEENick on The N.&quot; The TEENick name, which was removed on February 1, 2009, later became the name of the channel TeenNick on September 28, 2009.
* ME:TV – &quot;ME:TV&quot; was a short-lived live hosted afternoon block that ran during summer 2007, which ran on weekday afternoons from 2:00 to 6:00 p.m. Eastern/Pacific Time.
* Nick Saturday Nights – a primetime live-action block airing from 8:00 to 9:30 p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time. It was introduced on September 22, 2012, as &quot;Gotta See Saturday Nights&quot;. Recent episodes of certain original series may air when no new episodes are scheduled to air that week. Premieres of the network&#x27;s original made-for-TV movies also occasionally aired during the primetime block, usually in the form of premiere showings. Saturday premieres were discontinued for the time being on December 11, 2021.
* Nick Studio 10 – &quot;Nick Studio 10&quot; was a short-lived late afternoon programming block that ran from February 18 to June 17, 2013, which ran weekdays from 4:00 to 6:00 p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time. The block featured wraparound segments based on episodes of the network&#x27;s animated series, which were shown in an off-the-clock schedule due to the segments that aired following each program&#x27;s individual acts.
* That New Thursday Night – a live-action comedy block airing from 7:00 to 8:00 p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time. The schedule features &quot;Danger Force,&quot; &quot;Tyler Perry&#x27;s Young Dylan&quot;, &quot;That Girl Lay Lay&quot;, &quot;The Really Loud House,&quot; and &quot;Erin &amp; Aaron&quot; (all first-run episodes are cycled on the schedule, giving it a variable schedule). It was discontinued on June 29, 2023.
* AfterToons – an animation block airing weekday afternoons and featuring new episodes of a rotating selection of Nickelodeon animated series. The series featured are &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;, &quot;The Loud House&quot;, &quot;The Patrick Star Show&quot;, &quot;Big Nate&quot;, &quot;Rugrats&quot;, and &quot;The Smurfs&quot;. It was discontinued on November 24, 2023.

==== Special events ====
* Nickelodeon Kids&#x27; Choice Awards – The &quot;Kids&#x27; Choice Awards&quot; are a 90-minute-long annual live awards show held on the fourth Saturday night in March (formerly the first Saturday in April until 2008, but returned in 2011). The award show (whose winners are selected by Nickelodeon viewers though voting on the channel&#x27;s website and through text messaging) honors popular television series and movies, actors, athletes and music acts, with winners receiving a hollow orange blimp figurine (one of the logo outlines used for much of the network&#x27;s &quot;splat logo&quot; era from 1984 to 2009).
* Nickelodeon Kids&#x27; Choice Sports – A spin-off of the &quot;Kids&#x27; Choice Awards&quot;, &quot;Kids Choice Sports&quot; is held in July with the same KCA voting procedures and differing categories for team sports and athlete achievements for the past year (featuring categories such as &quot;Best Male Athlete&quot;, &quot;Best Female Athlete&quot;, &quot;King Of Swag&quot;, and &quot;Queen Of Swag&quot;), along with the award featuring a sports-specific purple mohawk. Its inaugural ceremony aired on July 17, 2014.
* Nickelodeon HALO Awards – The HALO Awards features five ordinary teens who are Helping And Leading Others (HALO). Its inaugural ceremony aired on December 11, 2009. The awards show is hosted by Nick Cannon and airs on Nickelodeon and TeenNick every November/December until 2017.
* Worldwide Day of Play – The &quot;Worldwide Day of Play&quot; is an annual event held on a Saturday afternoon in late September that began on October 2, 2004, to mark the conclusion of the &quot;Let&#x27;s Just Play&quot; campaign launched that year, which are both designed to influence kids to exercise and participate in outdoor activities; schools and educational organizations are also encouraged to host local events to promote activity among children during the event. Nickelodeon and its sister channels (except for the Pacific and Mountain Time Zone feeds and the Nick 2 Pacific feed that is distributed to the Eastern and Central Time Zones), some of the network&#x27;s international channels and associated websites are suspended (with a message encouraging viewers to participate in outdoor activities during the period) from 12:00 to 3:00 p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time on the day of the event. Since 2010, the Worldwide Day of Play event became part of The Big Help program, as part of an added focus on healthy lifestyles in addition to the program&#x27;s main focus on environmental issues.

==== Blocks on broadcast networks ====
*Untitled UPN block – In 1998, Viacom&#x27;s UPN entered into discussions with the network to produce a new block, but nothing ultimately materialized.
*Nickelodeon en Telemundo – On November 9, 1998, Telemundo introduced a daily block of Spanish dubs of Nickelodeon&#x27;s series (such as &quot;Rugrats&quot;, &quot;Aaahh!!! Real Monsters&quot;, &quot;Hey Arnold!&quot;, &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot;, and &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot;); the weekday edition of the block ran until September 5, 2000, when it was relegated to weekends in order to make room for the morning news program &quot;Hoy En El Mundo&quot;. Nickelodeon&#x27;s contract with Telemundo ended in November 2001, after the network was acquired by NBC, though certain programs would return in 2004 as part of the Telemundo Kids block.

*Nick on CBS/Nick Jr. on CBS – On September 14, 2002, Nickelodeon began producing a two-hour Saturday morning block for CBS (which was co-owned with Nickelodeon at the time as a result of then-network parent Viacom&#x27;s 1999 acquisition of CBS) to comply with the Children&#x27;s Television Act. The block featured episodes of series such as &quot;As Told by Ginger&quot;, &quot;The Wild Thornberrys&quot;, &quot;Rugrats&quot;, &quot;Hey Arnold!,&quot; and &quot;Pelswick&quot; which premiered on most CBS stations. The block was retooled in 2004 as a preschool-oriented block featuring Nick Jr. shows (such as &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot;, &quot;Dora the Explorer,&quot; and &quot;Little Bill&quot;); &quot;Nick Jr. on CBS&quot; was replaced in September 2006 by the KOL Secret Slumber Party block (produced by DIC Entertainment, which was subsequently acquired by Canada-based Cookie Jar (now WildBrain), as a result of CBS and Viacom&#x27;s split into separate companies at the end of 2005, but re-merged in late 2019.

== Related networks and services ==

=== Current sister channels ===
==== Nick Jr. Channel ====

Nick Jr. Channel (sometimes shortened to Nick Jr.) is a pay television network aimed mainly at children between 2 and 6 years of age. It features a mix of current and former preschool-oriented programs from Nickelodeon, as well as some shows that are exclusive to the channel. The Nick Jr. Channel launched on September 28, 2009, as a spin-off of Nickelodeon&#x27;s preschool programming block of the same name, which had aired since January 4, 1988. The channel replaced Noggin, which was relaunched as a streaming service in 2015 and acts as a separate sister brand. Noggin&#x27;s programming is distinct from the Nick Jr. channel&#x27;s; it mainly carried preteen-oriented programs at its launch, and its 2015 streaming service features a variety of exclusive series. On October 1, 2012, the Nick Jr. Channel introduced NickMom, a four-hour nighttime block aimed at parents, which ran until September 28, 2015. While traditional advertising appeared on the channel during the NickMom block, the network otherwise only runs programming promotions and underwriter-style sponsorships in lieu of regular commercials.

==== Nicktoons ====
Nicktoons is a pay television network that launched on May 1, 2002, as Nicktoons TV; it was renamed Nicktoons in April 2003 and rebranded as Nicktoons Network in September 2005 before reverting to its previous name in September 2009. The network airs a mix of newer live-action and animated shows from Nickelodeon such as &quot;Henry Danger&quot;, &quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot;, &quot;The Loud House&quot;, &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;, and &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; alongside original series airing exclusively on Nicktoons.

==== TeenNick ====

TeenNick is a pay television network that is aimed at adolescents and young adults, named after the TEENick block that aired on Nickelodeon from March 2001 to February 2009. The channel merged programming from the TEENick block with The N, a former block on Noggin. Although TeenNick has more relaxed program standards than the other Nickelodeon channels (save for Nick at Nite and the NickMom block on Nick Jr.) – allowing for moderate profanity, suggestive dialogue and some violent content – the network has shifted its lineup almost exclusively towards current and former Nickelodeon series (including some that are burned off due to low ratings on the flagship channel) that have stricter content standards. It also airs some acquired sitcoms and drama series.

==== NickMusic ====
NickMusic is a pay television network in the United States featuring music videos from artists appealing to Nickelodeon&#x27;s target audience. It launched on the channel space formerly held by MTV Hits on September 9, 2016.

Like its sibling music video-only networks BET Jams, BET Soul, and CMT Music, NickMusic is based on an automated &quot;wheel&quot; schedule that was introduced during the early years of MTV2. A new loop starts at 6 a.m. Eastern Time, and is then repeated at 2 p.m. and 10 p.m. Lyric videos are sometimes substituted due to content concerns with the artist&#x27;s actual music video.
The network launched on May 1, 2002, as &quot;MTV Hits&quot;, with its programming composed entirely of music videos. As with MTV Jams, the network was named for a daily program on MTV; in this case, &quot;MTV Hits&quot;, which was that network&#x27;s main pop music video program. The network composed of current hit music videos, along with a few older videos from earlier in the year, as well as a few from the late 1990s. As both MTV Hits and NickMusic, the network has maintained a commercial-free format, other than internal promotions for Nickelodeon or MTV and MTV-branded properties.

The network has no individual or original programs; &quot;TeenNick Top 10&quot;, a program shared with TeenNick, was cancelled in mid-2018. In electronic program listings, the titles of each &#x27;block&#x27; merely delineate an hour in those listings and outside those titles denoting video theming, have no on-air mention. The network&#x27;s specific theming to younger pop artists has also been underplayed as of 2024, due to various cuts at Paramount Global and the network&#x27;s complete disassociation from further developing &quot;triple threat&quot; stars due to personnel and industry changes.

=== Former sister channels ===

* Nickelodeon Games and Sports for Kids (commonly branded as Nickelodeon GAS or Nick GAS), was a pay television network that launched on March 1, 1999, as part of the suite of high-tier channels launched by MTV Networks. It ran a mix of game shows and other competition programs from Nickelodeon (essentially formatted as a children&#x27;s version of—and Viacom&#x27;s answer to—the Game Show Network). The channel formally ceased operations on December 31, 2007, and it was replaced by a short-lived 24-hour version of Noggin&#x27;s teen-oriented block The N. However, an automated loop of Nick GAS continued to be carried on Dish Network due to unknown factors until April 23, 2009.
* NickMom (stylized as nickmom) was a programming block launched on October 1, 2012, airing in the late night hours on the Nick Jr. Channel. The block aired its own original programming aimed at parents until 2014, then began to carry acquired films and sitcoms. Due to Viacom&#x27;s 2015 cutbacks involving acquired programming and low ratings, the NickMom block and associated website were discontinued in the early morning hours of September 28, 2015.

* Nick 2 was the off-air brand for a secondary timeshift channel of Nickelodeon formerly available on the high-tier packages exclusively on cable providers as a complement to the main Nickelodeon feed, repackaging Nickelodeon&#x27;s Eastern and Pacific Time Zone feeds for the appropriate time zone – the Pacific feed was distributed to the Eastern and Central Time Zones, and the Eastern feed was distributed to the Pacific and Mountain Time Zones – resulting in the difference in local airtimes for a particular program between two geographic locations being three hours at most, allowing viewers a second chance to watch a program after its initial airing on the Eastern Time Zone feed or to watch the show ahead of its airing on the Pacific Time Zone feed of the main channel (for example, the Nick at Nite block would respectively start at 9:00 p.m (Sundays-Fridays) &amp; At 10:30 p.m (Saturdays) Eastern on Nick 2 Pacific or 12:00 p.m. (weekdays) 10:00 a.m (weekends) Pacific weeknights on Nick 2 Eastern). Nick 2 would never broadcast in high definition, but the exception is through Xfinity&#x27;s IPTV services. The service existed from around 2000 until November 2018, launching as Nick TOO. The timeshift channel was originally offered as part of the MTV Networks Digital Suite, a slate of channels exclusive to high-tier cable packages (many of the networks also earned satellite carriage over time), and was the only American example of two feeds of a non-premium service being provided to cable and IPTV providers. A Nick TOO logo was used on the channel until 2004, when MTV Networks decided to stop using customized branding on the feed (a logo for Nick 2 was only used for identification purposes on electronic program guides as a placeholder image); most television listings thus showed the additional channel under the brandings &quot;Nick Pacific (NICKP)/Nick West (NICKW),&quot; or &quot;Nick East (NICKE).&quot; DirecTV and Dish Network also offer both Nickelodeon feeds, though they carry both time zone feeds of most of the children&#x27;s networks that the providers offer by default. Viacom Media Networks discontinued the Nick 2 digital cable service on November 22, 2018, likely due to video on demand options making timeshift channels for the most part superfluous. Both time zone feeds continue to be offered on Xfinity as well as satellite providers, unbranded.
* NickRewind (TeenNick block) On July 25, 2011, TeenNick began airing &quot;The &#x27;90s Are All That&quot;, renamed &quot;The Splat&quot; in October 2015, a block of Nickelodeon&#x27;s most popular 1990s programming, targeting the network&#x27;s target demographic from that era. After several name changes, the block was finally called &quot;NickRewind&quot; and focused on programming from the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s (mainly the latter two), and aired nightly. On January 31, 2022, the block was discontinued, with TeenNick&#x27;s overnight programming mainly consisting of regular reruns.

=== Nickelodeon Games ===
Nickelodeon Games (formerly Nick Games from 2002 to 2009, from 1997 to 2002, Nickelodeon Software, and from 1993 to 1997, Nickelodeon Interactive) is the video gaming division of Nickelodeon. It was originally a part of Viacom Consumer Products, with early games being published by Viacom New Media. They started a long-standing relationship with game publisher THQ. THQ&#x27;s relationship with the network started off when THQ published their &quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy&quot; game for Nintendo consoles in 1992, followed by a full-fledged console deal in 1998 with several &quot;Rugrats&quot; titles, and expanded in 2001, when THQ acquired some of the assets from Mattel Interactive, namely the computer publishing rights, and all video game rights to &quot;The Wild Thornberrys&quot;. Nickelodeon also worked, alongside THQ on an original game concept, &quot;Tak and the Power of Juju&quot;.

=== Nick.com ===

Nick.com is Nickelodeon&#x27;s main website, which launched in October 1995 as a component of America Online&#x27;s Kids Only channel before eventually moving to the full World Wide Web. It provides content, as well as video clips and full episodes of Nickelodeon series available for streaming. The website&#x27;s popularity grew to the point where in March 1999, Nick.com became the highest rated website among children aged 6–14 years old. Nickelodeon used the website in conjunction with television programs which increased traffic. In 2001, Nickelodeon partnered with Networks Inc. to provide broadband video games for rent from Nick.com; the move was a further step in the multimedia direction that the developers wanted to take the website. Skagerlind indicated that over 50% of Nick.com&#x27;s audience were using a high speed connection, which allowed them to expand the gaming and video streaming options on the website.

=== Mobile apps ===
Nickelodeon released a free mobile app for smartphones and tablet computers operating on the Apple and Android platforms in February 2013. Like Nick.com, a TV Everywhere login code provided by participating subscription providers is required to view individual episodes of the network&#x27;s series. In December 2023, it was announced the app will be discontinued.

Nickelodeon Magazine was a print magazine that was launched in 1993; the channel had previously published a short-lived magazine effort in 1990. &quot;Nickelodeon Magazine&quot; incorporated informative non-fiction pieces, humor (including pranks and parodical pieces), interviews, recipes (such as green slime cake), and a comic book section in the center of each issue featuring original comics by leading underground cartoonists as well as strips about popular Nicktoons. It ceased publication after 16 years in December 2009, citing a sluggish magazine industry. A new version of the magazine was published by Papercutz from June 2015 to mid-2016.

=== Nick Radio ===
Nick Radio was a radio network that launched on September 30, 2013, in a partnership between both the network and iHeartMedia (then called Clear Channel Communications), which distributed the network mainly via its iHeartRadio web platform and mobile app. Its programming was also streamed via the Nick.com website and on New York City radio station WHTZ as a secondary HD channel. Nick Radio focused on Top 40 and pop music (geared towards the network&#x27;s target audience of children, with radio edits of some songs incorporated due to inappropriate content), along with celebrity interview features. In addition to regular on-air DJs, Nick Radio also occasionally featured guest DJ stints by popular artists as well as stars from Nickelodeon&#x27;s original series.

Nick Radio shut down without warning on July 31, 2019, and was replaced by Hit Nation Junior, likely due to the network&#x27;s general failure to establish any sustained &quot;triple threat&quot; artists/actors throughout the 2010s, along with the general failure of the children&#x27;s-only radio format in the streaming age.

== Themed experiences and hotels ==

=== Nickelodeon Universe ===

Nickelodeon Universe at the Mall of America is the first indoor Nickelodeon theme park in the United States. Before being re-themed to Nickelodeon in 2007, the park was themed as &quot;Camp Snoopy&quot; and &quot;The Park at MoA.&quot; The theme park contains a variety of Nickelodeon-themed rides, including: SpongeBob SquarePants: Rock Bottom Plunge, Fairly Odd Coaster, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shell Shock.

Nickelodeon and Triple Five Group opened a second Nickelodeon Universe theme park in the American Dream Meadowlands complex on October 25, 2019. Upon opening, it became the largest indoor theme park in the western hemisphere, unseating the Mall of America&#x27;s Nickelodeon Universe which had the title from 2008 to 2019.

On August 18, 2009, Nickelodeon and Southern Star Amusements announced that it would build a Nickelodeon Universe in New Orleans, Louisiana on the site of the former Six Flags New Orleans by the end of 2010, which was set to be the first outdoor Nickelodeon Universe theme park. On November 9, 2009, Nickelodeon announced that it had ended the licensing agreement with Southern Star Amusements.

* Nickelodeon Land opened on May 4, 2011, at Blackpool Pleasure Beach, featuring several rides based on Nickelodeon series including &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Dora the Explorer,&quot; and &quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot;.
* Nickelodeon Land opened in September 2015 at Sea World, featuring multiple rides based on Nickelodeon programs including a SpongeBob junior roller coaster, and a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles-themed flyer.

* Nickelodeon Playtime/Nickelodeon Adventure are two themed children&#x27;s entertainment centers in Essex, England and Shenzhen, China. Play areas and attractions in these centers are immersively themed to &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;, &quot;Paw Patrol&quot;, and additional Nickelodeon shows.
Closed areas

* Nickelodeon Universe was also an area inside of Paramount&#x27;s Kings Island featuring Nickelodeon-themed rides and attractions. It was one of the largest sections in the park and was voted &quot;Best Kid&#x27;s Area&quot; by &quot;Amusement Today&quot; magazine from 2001 until its closure in 2009 after the park&#x27;s sale to Cedar Fair (the Paramount Parks ended up with CBS Corporation in the 2006 CBS/Viacom split, which CBS immediately sold off as soon as possible as non-critical surplus assets for that company).
* Nickelodeon Studios was an attraction at the Universal Orlando Resort that opened on June 7, 1990, and housed production for many Nickelodeon programs (including &quot;Clarissa Explains It All&quot;, &quot;What Would You Do?&quot; and &quot;All That&quot;). It closed on April 30, 2005, after Nickelodeon&#x27;s production facilities were moved to New York City and Burbank, California. The building that formerly housed it was recently occupied by the Blue Man Group Sharp Aquos Theatre, closed in February 2021. Another Nickelodeon-themed attraction at the park, Jimmy Neutron&#x27;s Nicktoon Blast, opened in 2003 but closed in 2011 to make way for the new ride &quot;Despicable Me: Minion Mayhem&quot;. In 2012, a store based on SpongeBob SquarePants opened in &quot;Woody Woodpecker&#x27;s Kidzone&quot;, replacing Universal&#x27;s Cartoon Store.
* Nickelodeon Central was an area inside of the Paramount Parks properties, including California&#x27;s Great America, Carowinds, Kings Dominion, Canada&#x27;s Wonderland, and Dreamworld that featured shows, attractions and themes featuring Nickelodeon characters, all of which were wound down when CBS Corporation was given ownership of the theme parks in the Viacom/CBS split and eventually sold most of the properties to Cedar Fair without renewal of the Nickelodeon licensing agreements. The only Nickelodeon Central remaining in existence was at Dreamworld in Australia, which is not under Cedar Fair ownership. The license was revoked in 2011 and became &quot;Kid&#x27;s World&quot; and later DreamWorks Experience.
* Nickelodeon Blast Zone was an area in Universal Studios Hollywood that featured several attractions inspired by Nickelodeon shows. The four attractions that were present in the area were &quot;Nickelodeon Splash&quot;, a waterpark-style area, &quot;The Wild Thornberrys Adventure Temple&quot;, a jungle-themed foam ball play area, and &quot;Nick Jr. Backyard&quot;, a medium-sized toddler playground. It ran from 2001 to 2007 and was rethemed as &quot;The Adventures of Curious George&quot; which closed in 2008 to make way for The Wizarding World of Harry Potter (Universal Studios Hollywood). Adjacent to Nickelodeon Blast Zone was the &quot;Panasonic Theatre&quot; which housed Totally Nickelodeon, an audience-participated game show which ran from 1997 to 2000. &quot;Rugrats Magic Adventure&quot; replaced the game show in 2001, but closed in 2002 to make way for Shrek 4-D which ran from May 2003 to August 2017. It closed to make way for DreamWorks Theatre Featuring Kung Fu Panda which opened on June 15, 2018.
* Nickelodeon Splat City was an area inside California&#x27;s Great America (from 1995 to 2002), Kings Island (from 1995 to 2000) and Kings Dominion (from 1995 to 1999), that featured messy- and water-themed attractions. The slime refinery theme was carried out in the attractions such as the &quot;Green Slime Zone Refinery&quot;, the &quot;Crystal Slime Mining Maze&quot;, and the &quot;Green Slime Transfer Truck&quot;. All of these areas were later transformed into either Nickelodeon Central or Nickelodeon Universe before being discontinued as mentioned above when sold off by CBS Corporation.

=== Hotel brands ===
* Nickelodeon Suites Resort was a Nickelodeon-themed hotel in Orlando, Florida, located near the Universal Orlando Resort and from Walt Disney World. The hotel originally opened in 1999, and re-opened under its Nickelodeon re-theming in 2005. It included one-to-three bedroom themed kid suites, a water park area, arcade, and various forms of entertainment themed after Nickelodeon shows. It also contained a Nick at Nite-themed lounge area for adults. The property was re-themed to &quot;Holiday Inn Resort Orlando Suites&quot; on June 1, 2016.
* Nickelodeon Resorts by Marriott was a proposed hotel chain similar to the Nickelodeon Suites Resort, featuring a waterpark area and 650 hotel rooms. Announced in 2007, the first location was scheduled to open in San Diego in 2010, however, the plans were canceled in 2009. Plans for the remaining 19 hotels originally slated to open remain unclear.
* Nickelodeon Hotels &amp; Resorts is a hotel chain that opened its first location in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic in 2016, in association with Karisma Hotels and Resorts. The second location opened in Riviera Maya, Mexico in 2021. A third location is in development for a 2025 opening, and will be connected to the Land of Legends theme park in Antalya, Turkey. A fourth location is in development for Everest Place in Orlando, Florida for a 2026 opening, and a fifth location is currently in development for a 2027 opening in Garden Grove, California.

=== Cruises ===
* Nickelodeon at Sea is a series of Nickelodeon-themed cruise packages in partnership with Norwegian Cruise Line. They feature special amenities and entertainment themed to various Nickelodeon properties. This was later removed in 2015.
* Norwegian Cruise Line also hosted some Nickelodeon Cruises on the Norwegian Jewel and Norwegian Epic liners, as part of Nickelodeon at Sea.

== International ==

Between 1993 and 1995, Nickelodeon opened international channels in the United Kingdom, Australia, and Germany; by the later year, the network had provided its programming to broadcasters in 70 countries. Since the mid-1990s and early 2000s, Nickelodeon as a brand has expanded into include language- or culture-specific channels for various other territories in different parts of the world including Europe, Asia, Oceania, and Canada, and has licensed some of its cartoons and other content, in English and local languages, to free-to-air networks and subscription channels such as KI.KA and Super RTL in Germany, RTÉ Two (English language) and TG4 (Irish language) in Ireland, YTV (in English) and Vrak.TV (in French, defunct) in Canada, Canal J in France, Alpha Kids in Greece, CNBC-e in Turkey and Network 10&#x27;s localised version of Nickelodeon in Australia.

<text>Alta Verapaz () is a department in the north central part of Guatemala. The capital and chief city of the department is Cobán. Verapaz is bordered to the north by El Petén, to the east by Izabal, to the south by Zacapa, El Progreso, and Baja Verapaz, and to the west by El Quiché.

Also in Alta Verapaz are the towns of Chisec, San Pedro Carchá and San Cristóbal Verapaz.

== History==

In pre-Columbian times, this area was part of the Maya civilization. When the Spanish Conquistadores came in the 1520s they conquered the central and southern highlands of Guatemala, but were driven back from this region by fierce native resistance. Unknown to the history books of this region, local oral history speaks of a former slave ship capsizing prior to the Spaniards arriving upon this area. The former African slaves moved inland, and joined forces with the local indigenous people to fight and maintain their freedom. Spanish friars succeeded in converting the area to Christianity, and named the area &quot;Verapaz&quot; meaning &quot;True Peace&quot;. In the 19th century this became an important coffee producing region as well as a sugar cane plantation during prior centuries. A museum exists today highlighting the sugar plantation history. In this region of Guatemala, families that trace back their heritage before the Spanish conquest, can trace back their Mayan features and curly hair to that local oral history. Majority of pre-Columbian heritage is seen with straight black hair throughout Guatemala.

The department was called Vera Paz by the British in the 19th century. In 1850, the department had an estimated population of 66,000.

As a result of the Mexican Drug War, the Los Zetas drug cartel members overtook much of the department and occupied many towns in December 2010. The Guatemalan government declared a state of siege on December 19, 2010, to reclaim the department, allowing the military and police forces to search and arrest any suspects without a warrant, and at least sixteen buildings were searched.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Cobán&quot; comes from Q&#x27;eqchi&#x27; (between clouds)

== History ==
=== Order of Preachers in the Vera Paz ===


Between 1530 and 1531, captain on his way to Ciudad Real accidentally discovered the lagoon and hill of . People of that place had historically traded with all the people that the Spaniards had conquered, so, knowing what was coming, they sought refuge in the jungle. The Spaniards tried in vain to conquer the lacandones: from Nueva España Juan Enríquez de Guzman tried; from the Yucatán Peninsula, Francisco de Montejo tried; Pedro de Alvarado attempted it from Guatemala along with captain Francisco Gil Zapata and, finally, Pedro Solórzano from Chiapas. That is when the Order of Preachers tried to convert the Tezulutlán &quot;War Zone&quot; into a peaceful region.

In the meantime, after a series of setbacks in La Española, the island Audiencia allowed Bartolomé de las Casas to accept Friar Tomás de Berlanga&#x27;s invitation to go to Nueva Granada in 1534, where he had just been appointed as Bishop. Both sailed toward Panama, to then continued to Lima, but during the trip a storm tossed their ship to Nicaragua, where Las Casas chose to remain in the Granada convent. in 1535, he proposed to the King and the Council of the Indies to start a peaceful colonization of the unexplored rural zones in the Guatemala region; however, in spite of Bernal Díaz de Luco and Mercado de Peñaloza intentions to help him, his suggestion was rejected. In 1536 Nicaraguan governor Rodrigo de Contreras organized a military expedition, but Las Casas was able to postpone it by a couple of years after he notified queen Isabel de Portugal, wife of Carlos V. Given the authorities&#x27; hostility, Las Casas left Nicaragua and went to Guatemala.

In November 1536, Las Casas settled in Santiago de Guatemala, then the capital of Guatemala; a few months later, his friend, bishop Juan Garcés, invited him to move to Tlascala, but after a few weeks he came back to Guatemala. On May 2, 1537, governor Alonso de Maldonado granted him the Tezulutlán Capitulations - a written commitment ratified on July 6, 1539, by Antonio de Mendoza, México Viceroy- in which everybody agreed that Tezulutlán natives, once conquered, would not be given as encomienda but would be King&#x27;s subjects. Las Casas, along with friars Rodrigo de Landa, Pedro Angulo and Luis de Cancer, looked for four Christian natives and taught them Christian hymns where the Gospel&#x27;s basic principles were explained. Luis de Cancer visited the cacique of Sacapulas and was able to perform the first baptisms among his people. Later, Las Casas lead a retinue to bring girts to the cacique, who was so impressed that he decided to convert and become his people preacher. The cacique was baptized with the name of Don Juan and the natives granted permission to build a small church; however, Cobán, another cacique, burned the church. Don Juan, along sixty men, Las Casas and Pedro Angulo, went to talk to Cobán&#x27;s people and convinced them of their good intentions; Don Juan even took the initiative to marry one of his daughters with cacique Cobán by the Catholic Church.

In 1539 pope Paul III authorized the diocese of Ciudad Real; that year, Alonso de Maldonado—under pressure by Spanish settlers—began a military campaign in Tezulutlán [...] gave all the natives in encomiendas. This flagrant violation of the Capitulations enraged Las Casas, who traveled to Spain to denounce it before king Charles V. On January 9, 1540, a royal document was issues which the were ratified and gave the region to the protection of the Order of Preachers. On October 17 of that year, Cardinal García de Loaysa -then president of the Indias Council- ordered the México Audiencia to comply with these laws. The Capitulations were officially published on January 21, 1541, in the church of Sevilla.

Las Casas was appointed bishop of Chiapas in 1544, but he tried to apply the new ways in his diocese, they were flatly rejected by the encomenderos. In 1545, Guatemala bishop Francisco Marroquín visited Tezulutlán and met with the preachers. Back in the city of Gracias a Dios, where the Audiencia de los Confines had its main office- met with Las Casas and with Nicaragua bishop Antonio de Valdivieso. There was a lot of tension between Marroquín and Las Casas in this meeting The conflict moved on to Ciudad de México and finally everybody agreed to favor the freedom of the natives; however, this could not be accomplished for the Lacandon Jungle would not be conquered for another two century, becoming the rebel maya people favorite hideout.

Las Casas and Angulo founded Rabinal, and the city of Cobán was the center of the new Catholic doctrine. A few years later, the natives started settling following the Spanish model and several towns were settled, like Tactic. The name &quot;War zone&quot; was change for &quot;Vera Paz&quot; (true peace), name that became official in 1547. Cobán received the title of an imperial city by Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor and in 1599 Cobán became bishop&#x27;s see. It was briefly known during this period as Ciudad Imperial (Spanish for &quot;Imperial City&quot;) in Charles&#x27;s honor.

=== Independence and German settlers ===

As of 1850, Cobán population was estimated to be at 12000. Ca. 1890, British archeologist Alfred Percival Maudslay and his wife moved to Guatemala, and visited Cobán. Around the time the Maudslays visited Verapaz, a German colony had settled in the area thanks to generous concessions granted by liberal presidents Manuel Lisandro Barillas Bercián, José María Reyna Barrios and Manuel Estrada Cabrera. The Germans had a very united and solid community and had several activities in the German Club (Deutsche Verein), in Cobán, which they had founded in 1888. Their main commercial activity was coffee plantations. Maudslay described the Germans like this: &quot;There is a larger proportion of foreigners in Coban than in any other town in the Republic: they are almost exclusively Germans engaged in coffee-planting, and some few of them in cattle-ranching and other industries; although complaints of isolation and of housekeeping and labour troubles are not unheard of amongst them, they seemed to me to be fortunate from a business point of view in the high reputation that the Vera Paz coffee holds in the market, and the very considerable commercial importance which their industry and foresight has brought to the district; and, from a personal point of view, in the enjoyment of a delicious climate in which their rosy-cheeked children can be reared in health and strength, and in all the comforts which pertain to a life half European and half tropical. Hotels or fondas appear to be scarce; but the hospitality of the foreign residents is proverbial.&quot;

The city was developed by German coffee growers towards the end of the 19th century and was operated as a largely independent dominion until WWII. In 1888 a German club was founded and in 1935 a German school opened its doors in Cobán. Until 1930, about 2000 Germans populated the city. In 1941, all Germans were expelled by the Guatemalan government, led at the time by Jorge Ubico because of pressure from the United States; it has also been suggested Ubico&#x27;s motivation was to seize control of the vast amounts of land Germans owned in the area. Many ended up in internment camps in Texas and were later traded for American POW&#x27;s held in Germany. A sizable resident German population persists though most having been completely assimilated into the Guatemalan culture through intermarriage. Multiple German architectonic elements can still be appreciated throughout Cobán.

The Germans also set up Ferrocarril Verapaz, a railway which connected Cobán with Lake Izabal, operated from 1895 until 1963 and was a symbol for the wealth in this coffee-growing region those days.

===Franja Transversal del Norte===


The Northern Transverse Strip was officially created during the government of General Carlos Arana Osorio in 1970, by Legislative Decree 60–70, for agricultural development. The decree literally said: &quot;It is of public interest and national emergency, the establishment of Agrarian Development Zones in the area included within the municipalities: San Ana Huista, San Antonio Huista, Nentón, Jacaltenango, San Mateo Ixtatán, and Santa Cruz Barillas in Huehuetenango; Chajul and San Miguel Uspantán in Quiché; Cobán, Chisec, San Pedro Carchá, Lanquín, Senahú, Cahabón and Chahal, in Alta Verapaz and the entire department of Izabal.&quot;

===21st century: African oil palm===


There is a large demand within Guatemala and some of its neighbors for edible oils and fats, which would explain how the African oil palm became so prevalent in the country in detriment of other oils, and which has allowed new companies associated to large capitals in a new investment phase that can be found particularly in some territories that form the Northern Transversal Strip of Guatemala. The investors are trying to turn Guatemala into one of the main palm oil exporters, in spite of the decline on its international price. The most active region is found in Chisec and Cobán, in Alta Verapaz Department; Ixcán in Quiché Department, and Sayaxché, Petén Department, where Palmas del Ixcán, S.A. (PALIX) is located, both with its own plantation and those of subcontractors. Another active region is that of Fray Bartolomé de las Casas and Chahal in Alta Verapaz Department; El Estor and Livingston, Izabal Department; and San Luis, Petén, where Naturaceites operates.

==Climate==
Cobán has a subtropical climate highland (Köppen: &quot;Cfb/Cwb&quot;).

== Culture ==

Each year at the end of July, a festival of Guatemala&#x27;s native peoples is held here, &quot;La Fiesta Nacional Indígena de Guatemala&quot; (Festival Folklórico). The festivities include a beauty contest for Guatemala&#x27;s indigenous women, the winner of which is crowned with the title &quot;Rabin Ahau&quot;, which means &quot;the Daughter of the King&quot; in Q&#x27;eqchi&#x27;. The dominant ethnicity here is Q&#x27;eqchi&#x27; Mayan and the language of Q&#x27;eqchi&#x27; is widely spoken in town, especially in and around the markets where farmers from the surrounding hills sell their products. The departmental fair is held in Cobán and begins on the last Sunday in July and continues for a week. Every year, the international half-marathon of Cobán is held during the month of May; 4,000 runners gather in Cobán to take part of the event that has become the landmark event for the region. The annual religious festival &quot;(fiesta titular)&quot; is on August 4 and dedicated to Santo Domingo de Guzman.

==Sports==
Cobán Imperial Football Club is one of the traditional clubs of Guatemala and became Guatemala League champions for the first time in 2004. The club plays in the Guatemalan national league. They play their home games in the Estadio Verapaz.
Cobán is also known for their basketball history. The youth leagues are the best in the country.

==Tourism==
Cobán is surrounded by mountains laden with orchids. The rare Monja blanca orchid is the departmental symbol. Nature reserves in or near Cobán include Las Victorias National Park, San José la Colonia National Park, Laguna Lachuá National Park, and &quot;Biotopo Mario Dary Rivera&quot;. There can be found multiple caves, waterfalls and forests which are home to the rare Quetzal. Thus, Cobán has become a popular spot for eco-tourism.

Additional popular tourist spots in the city of Cobán include the El Calvario Church, the Dieseldorff coffee plantation, Plaza Magdalena Shopping Center and Coban&#x27;s central plaza.

<text>John Towner Williams (born February 8, 1932) is an American composer and conductor. In a career that has spanned seven decades, he has composed some of the most popular, recognizable, and critically acclaimed film scores in cinema history. He has a distinct sound that mixes romanticism, impressionism and atonal music with complex orchestration. He is best known for his collaborations with Steven Spielberg and George Lucas and has received numerous accolades including 26 Grammy Awards, five Academy Awards, seven BAFTA Awards, three Emmy Awards and four Golden Globe Awards. With 54 Academy Award nominations, he is the second-most nominated person, after Walt Disney, and is the oldest Oscar nominee in any category, at 91 years old.

Williams&#x27;s early work as a film composer includes &quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot; (1967), &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips&quot; (1969), &quot;Images&quot; and &quot;The Cowboys&quot; (both 1972), &quot;The Long Goodbye&quot; (1973) and &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot; (1974). He has collaborated with Spielberg since &quot;The Sugarland Express&quot; (1974), composing music for all but five of his feature films. He received five Academy Awards for Best Score for &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; (1971), &quot;Jaws&quot; (1975), &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977), &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; (1982) and &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; (1993). Other memorable collaborations with Spielberg include &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; (1977), the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; franchise (1981–2023), &quot;Hook&quot; (1991), &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; (1993), &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; (1998), &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot; (2002), &quot;War Horse&quot; (2011), &quot;Lincoln&quot; (2012), and &quot;The Fabelmans&quot; (2022). He also scored &quot;Superman&quot; (1978), the first two &quot;Home Alone&quot; films (1990–1992), and the first three &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films (2001–2004).

Williams has also composed numerous classical concertos and other works for orchestral ensembles and solo instruments. He served as the Boston Pops&#x27; principal conductor from 1980 to 1993 and is its laureate conductor. Other works by Williams include theme music for the 1984 Summer Olympic Games; &quot;NBC Sunday Night Football;&quot; &quot;The Mission&quot; theme (used by NBC News and Seven News in Australia); and the television series &quot;Lost in Space&quot;, &quot;Land of the Giants&quot; and &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;.

Among other accolades, he has received the Kennedy Center Honor in 2004, the National Medal of the Arts in 2009 and the AFI Life Achievement Award in 2016. He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1998, the Hollywood Bowl&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 2000 and the American Classical Music Hall of Fame in 2004. He has composed the score for nine of the top 25 highest-grossing films at the U.S. box office. In 2022, Williams was appointed an Honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) by Queen Elizabeth II, &quot;for services to film music&quot;. In 2005, the American Film Institute placed Williams&#x27;s score to &quot;Star Wars&quot; first on its list AFI&#x27;s 100 Years of Film Scores; his scores for &quot;Jaws&quot; and &quot;E.T.&quot; also made the list. The Library of Congress entered the &quot;Star Wars&quot; soundtrack into the National Recording Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Early life==
John Towner Williams was born in Flushing, Queens, New York City, to Esther (née Towner) and Johnny Williams, a jazz drummer and percussionist who played with the Raymond Scott Quintet. He has an older sister, Joan, and two younger brothers, Jerry and Don, who play on his film scores. Williams said of his lineage: &quot;My father was a Maine man—we were very close. My mother was from Boston. My father&#x27;s parents ran a department store in Bangor, Maine, and my mother&#x27;s father was a cabinetmaker.&quot; Johnny Williams collaborated with Bernard Herrmann, and his son sometimes joined him in rehearsals.

In 1948, the Williams family moved to Los Angeles where John attended North Hollywood High School, graduating in 1950. He later attended the University of California, Los Angeles, and studied composition privately with the Italian composer Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco. Williams also attended Los Angeles City College for one semester, as the school had a Studio Jazz Band. In 1951, Williams joined the U.S. Air Force, where he played the piano and bass and conducted and arranged music for the U.S. Air Force Band as part of his assignments. In a 2016 interview with the U.S. Air Force Band, he recounted having attended basic training at Lackland Air Force Base, after which he served as a pianist and bass player, with secondary duties of making arrangements for three years. In March 1952, he was assigned to the Northeast Air Command 596th Air Force Band, stationed at Pepperrell Air Force Base in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland. He also attended music courses at the University of Arizona as part of his service.

In 1955, following his Air Force service, Williams moved to New York City and entered Juilliard, where he studied piano with Rosina Lhévinne. He was originally set on becoming a concert pianist, but after hearing contemporary pianists like John Browning and Van Cliburn perform, he switched his focus to composition. &quot;It became clear,&quot; he recalled, &quot;that I could write better than I could play.&quot; During this time Williams worked as a pianist in many of the city&#x27;s jazz clubs.

==Early career==
After his studies at Juilliard and the Eastman School of Music, Williams went to Los Angeles where he began working as an orchestrator at film studios. Williams worked with such composers as Franz Waxman, Bernard Herrmann and Alfred Newman, and with fellow orchestrators Conrad Salinger and Bob Franklyn.

Williams was also a studio pianist and session musician, performing on scores by such composers as Jerry Goldsmith, Elmer Bernstein and Henry Mancini. One of his first jobs was working under mentor Alfred Newman with an uncredited role in the orchestra for the 1956 film &quot;Carousel&quot;, which also coincidentally starred his soon-to-be wife Barbara Ruick.

With Mancini, he recorded the scores of &quot;Peter Gunn&quot; (1959), &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot; (1961), &quot;Days of Wine and Roses&quot; (1962) and &quot;Charade&quot; (1963), and played the piano part of the guitar-piano ostinato in Mancini&#x27;s &quot;Peter Gunn&quot; title theme. With Elmer Bernstein, he performed on the scores of Alexander Mackendrick&#x27;s &quot;Sweet Smell of Success&quot; (1957) and Robert Mulligan&#x27;s &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; (1962). Williams was also the pianist on the scores of Billy Wilder&#x27;s &quot;The Apartment&quot; (1960) Jerome Robbins and Robert Wise&#x27;s &quot;West Side Story&quot; (1961), and Blake Edwards &quot;The Great Race&quot; (1966).

Known as Johnny Williams during this period, he released several jazz albums under this name, including &quot;Jazz Beginnings&quot;, &quot;World on a String,&quot; and &quot;The John Towner Touch&quot;. Williams also served as music arranger and bandleader for a series of popular music albums with the singers Ray Vasquez and Frankie Laine.

==Film and television scoring==
While fluent in many 20th-century musical languages, Williams&#x27;s most familiar style is neoromanticism. Williams&#x27;s score for &quot;Star Wars&quot; is often described as Wagnerian as it makes use of the leitmotif, a musical phrase associated with a place, character or idea. Williams downplays the influence of Wagner: &quot;People say they hear Wagner in &quot;Star Wars&quot;, and I can only think, It&#x27;s not because I put it there. Now, of course, I know that Wagner had a great influence on Korngold and all the early Hollywood composers. Wagner lives with us here—you can&#x27;t escape it. I have been in the big river swimming with all of them.&quot;

=== 1954–1973: Rise to prominence ===
Williams wrote his first film composition in 1952 while stationed at Pepperrell Air Force Base for a promotional film titled &quot;You Are Welcome&quot;, created for the Newfoundland tourist information office. Williams&#x27;s first feature film composition was for &quot;Daddy-O&quot; (1958), and his first screen credit came two years later in &quot;Because They&#x27;re Young&quot;. Williams also composed music for television, &quot;Bachelor Father&quot; (1957–59), the &quot;Kraft Suspense Theatre&quot; (1963–65), &quot;Lost in Space&quot; (1965–68), &quot;The Time Tunnel&quot; (1966–67) and &quot;Land of the Giants&quot; (1968-70), the last three created by the prolific producer Irwin Allen. He also worked on several episodes of &quot;M Squad&quot; (1957-1960) and &quot;Checkmate&quot; (1960–1962) and the pilot episode of &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; (1964–67).

Williams called William Wyler&#x27;s &quot;How to Steal a Million&quot; (1966) &quot;the first film I ever did for a major, super-talent director&quot;. Williams received his first Oscar nomination for his score for &quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot; (1967) and was nominated again for &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips&quot; (1969). His first Oscar was for Scoring: Adaptation and Original Song Score, for &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; (1971). He scored Robert Altman&#x27;s psychological thriller &quot;Images&quot; (1972) and his neo-noir &quot;The Long Goodbye&quot; (1973), based on the novel of the same name by Raymond Chandler. Pauline Kael wrote that &quot;Altman does variations on Chandler&#x27;s theme the way the John Williams score does variations the title song, which is tender in one scene, a funeral dirge in another. Williams&#x27; music is a parody of the movies&#x27; frequent overuse of a theme, and a demonstration of how adaptable a theme can be.&quot; Altman, known for giving actors free rein, had a similar approach to Williams, telling him &quot;Do whatever you want. Do something you haven&#x27;t done before.&quot; His prominence grew in the early 1970s thanks to his work for Irwin Allen&#x27;s disaster films; he scored &quot;The Poseidon Adventure&quot; (1972), &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot; and &quot;Earthquake&quot; (both 1974). Williams named his &quot;Images&quot; score as a favorite; he recalls &quot;the score used all kinds of effects for piano, percussion, and strings. It had a debt to Varèse, whose music enormously interested me. If I had never written film scores, if I had proceeded writing concert music, it might have been in this vein. I think I would have enjoyed it. I might even have been fairly good at it. But my path didn&#x27;t go that way.&quot; As it happened, Williams&#x27;s scores for &quot;The Reivers&quot; (1969) and &quot;The Cowboys&quot; (1972) shaped the path his career went.

=== 1974–present: Collaborations with Steven Spielberg ===
Williams&#x27;s scores for &quot;The Reivers&quot; and &quot;The Cowboys&quot; impressed a young Steven Spielberg, who was getting ready to direct his feature debut, &quot;The Sugarland Express&quot; (1974) and requested the composer for &quot;The Reivers&quot;. Williams recalled, &quot;I met what looked to be this seventeen-year-old kid, this very sweet boy, who knew more about film music than I did—every Max Steiner and Dimitri Tiomkin score. We had a meeting in a fancy Beverly Hills restaurant, arranged by executives. It was very cute—you had the feeling Steven had never been in a restaurant like that before. It was like having lunch with a teen-age kid, but a brilliant one.&quot; They reunited a year later for &quot;Jaws&quot;. Spielberg used Williams&#x27;s theme for &quot;Images&quot; as a temp track while editing &quot;Jaws&quot;. When Williams played his main theme for &quot;Jaws&quot;, based on the alteration of two notes, Spielberg initially thought it was a joke. Williams explained that &quot;the sophisticated approach you would like me to take isn&#x27;t the approach you took with the film I just experienced.&quot; After hearing variations on the theme, Spielberg agreed: &quot;sometimes the best ideas are the most simple ones.&quot; The score earned Williams his second Academy Award, his first for Best Original Score. Its ominous two-note ostinato has become a shorthand for approaching danger. (Williams&#x27;s score is more complex than the two-note theme; it contains echoes of Debussy&#x27;s and Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot;.)

Shortly thereafter, Spielberg and Williams began a two-year collaboration on &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;. They crafted the distinctive five-note motif that functions both in the score and in the story as the communications signal of the film&#x27;s extraterrestrials. Darryn King writes that &quot;One moment in that film captures some of Spielberg and Williams&#x27;s alchemy: the musical dialogue between the humans and the otherworldly visitors, itself an artistic collaboration of sorts.&quot; Pauline Kael wrote of the scene: &quot;the earthlings are ready with a console, and they greet the great craft with an oboe solo variation on the five-note theme; the craft answers in deep, tuba tones. The dialogue becomes blissfully garrulous ... there is a conversational duet: the music of the spheres.&quot; Williams says the first three notes of the theme are resolved, making the next two surprising, adding &quot;I realized that 20 years after the fact.&quot;

Spielberg chose Williams to score &quot;1941&quot; (1979) and &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; (1981). For the latter, Williams wrote the rousing &quot;The Raiders March&quot; for the film&#x27;s hero, Indiana Jones, as well as separate themes to represent the eponymous Ark of the Covenant, Jones&#x27;s love interest Marion Ravenwood and the Nazi villains. Additional themes were written and featured in his scores for &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot; (1984), &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot; (1989), &quot;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot; (2008) and &quot;Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny&quot; (2023). Spielberg emphasized the importance of Williams&#x27;s score to the Indiana Jones pictures: &quot;Jones did not perish, but listened carefully to the &quot;Raiders&quot; score. Its sharp rhythms told him when to run. Its slicing strings told him when to duck. Its several integrated themes told adventurer Jones when to kiss the heroine or smash the enemy. All things considered, Jones listened ... and lived.&quot; Williams&#x27;s soaring score for Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; (1982) won him a fourth Oscar. Spielberg liked Williams&#x27;s music for the climactic chase so much that he edited the film to match it.

The Spielberg-Williams collaboration resumed in 1987 with &quot;Empire of the Sun&quot; and continued with &quot;Always&quot; (1989), &quot;Hook&quot; (1991), &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; (1993) and its sequel &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot; (1997), &quot;Amistad&quot; (1997) and &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; (1998). Williams also contributed the theme music for, and scored several episodes of, Spielberg&#x27;s anthology television series &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; (1985). &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; (1993) proved to be a challenge for Williams; after viewing the rough cut with Spielberg, he was so overcome with emotion that he was hesitant to score the film. He told Spielberg, &quot;I really think you need a better composer than I am for this film.&quot; Spielberg replied, &quot;I know, but they&#x27;re all dead.&quot; Williams asked classical violinist Itzhak Perlman to play the main theme for the film. Williams garnered his fourth Oscar for Best Original Score, his fifth overall.

Williams scored Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;A.I. Artificial Intelligence&quot;, based on an unfinished project Stanley Kubrick asked Spielberg to direct. A. O. Scott argued that the movie represented new directions for director and composer, writing that Spielberg created &quot;a mood as layered, dissonant and strange as John Williams&#x27;s unusually restrained, modernist score&quot;. Williams wrote scores inspired by jazz for Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot; (2002), which allowed him to tip his hat to Henry Mancini, as well as &quot;The Terminal&quot; (2004). His 2005 score for Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; allowed him to tip his hat to the scores for classic monster movies. That same year, he scored Spielberg&#x27;s epic historical drama film &quot;Munich&quot;.

In 2011, after a three-year hiatus from film scoring, Williams composed the scores for Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; and &quot;War Horse&quot;. The former was his first score for an animated film, and he employed various styles, including &quot;1920s, 1930s European jazz&quot; for the opening credits and &quot;pirate music&quot; for the maritime battles. Both scores received overwhelmingly positive reviews and earned Academy Award nominations, the latter also being nominated for a Golden Globe. The Oscar nominations were Williams&#x27;s 46th and 47th, making him the most nominated musician in Academy Award history (having previously been tied with Alfred Newman&#x27;s 45 nominations) and the second most nominated overall, behind Walt Disney. Williams won an Annie Award for his score for &quot;Tintin&quot;. In 2012, he scored Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Lincoln&quot;, for which he received his 48th Academy Award nomination. He was also set to write the score for &quot;Bridge of Spies&quot; that year, which would have been his 27th collaboration with Spielberg, but in March 2015, it was announced that Thomas Newman would score it instead, as Williams&#x27;s schedule was interrupted by a minor health issue. This was the first Spielberg film since &quot;The Color Purple&quot; (1985) not scored by Williams. Williams composed the scores for Spielberg&#x27;s fantasy &quot;The BFG&quot; and his drama &quot;The Post&quot; (2017).

In 2019, Williams served as music consultant for Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;West Side Story&quot; (2021) and scored his semi-autobiographical &quot;The Fabelmans&quot; (2022). In June 2022, Williams announced that &quot;Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny&quot;, scheduled for a 2023 release, would likely be his last film score as he planned to retire from film and focus on solely composing concert music. However, he reversed this decision by January 2023, stating that he had at least &quot;10 more years to go. I&#x27;ll stick around for a while!&quot;. He compared the decision to Spielberg&#x27;s father Arnold, who had worked in his field until he was 100.

=== &quot;Star Wars&quot; and other franchises ===
Spielberg recommended Williams to his friend George Lucas, who needed a composer for his space opera &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977). Williams delivered a grand symphonic score influenced by Gustav Holst&#x27;s orchestral suite &quot;The Planets&quot;, as well as Richard Strauss, Antonín Dvořák, and Golden Age Hollywood composers Max Steiner and Erich Wolfgang Korngold. The Star Wars theme is among the most widely recognized in film history, and the &quot;Force Theme&quot; and &quot;Princess Leia&#x27;s Theme&quot; are well-known examples of leitmotif. The score was immensely successful—it remains the highest grossing non-popular music recording of all time—and won Williams a second Academy Award for Best Original Score. In 1980, Williams returned to score &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, introducing &quot;The Imperial March&quot; as the theme for Darth Vader and the Galactic Empire, &quot;Yoda&#x27;s Theme&quot;, and &quot;Han Solo and the Princess&quot;. The original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy concluded with &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, for which Williams provided the &quot;Emperor&#x27;s Theme&quot;, &quot;Parade of the Ewoks&quot;, and &quot;Luke and Leia&quot;. Both scores earned him Academy Award nominations.

In 1999, Lucas launched the first of three prequels to the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy. Williams was asked to score all three, starting with &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;. Along with themes from the previous films, Williams created new themes for 2002&#x27;s &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot; and 2005&#x27;s &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot;. Most notable of these was &quot;Duel of the Fates&quot;, an aggressive choral composition in the style of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Requiem&quot;, using harsh Sanskrit lyrics that broadened the style of music used in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; films. It used vocal melodies instead of his usual compositions using brass instruments. Also of note was &quot;Anakin&#x27;s Theme&quot;, which begins as an innocent childlike melody and morphs insidiously into a quote of the sinister &quot;Imperial March&quot;. For &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot;, Williams composed &quot;Across the Stars&quot;, a love theme for Padmé Amidala and Anakin Skywalker (mirroring the love theme composed for &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;). The final installment &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot; combined many of the themes created for the series&#x27; previous films, including &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s Theme&quot;, &quot;The Imperial March&quot;, &quot;Across the Stars&quot;, &quot;Duel of the Fates&quot;, &quot;The Force Theme&quot;, &quot;Rebel Fanfare&quot;, &quot;Luke&#x27;s Theme&quot;, and &quot;Princess Leia&#x27;s Theme&quot;, as well as new themes for General Grievous and the film&#x27;s climax, titled &quot;Battle of the Heroes&quot;.

Williams scored the first three film adaptations of J. K. Rowling&#x27;s &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series. The most important theme from Williams&#x27;s scores for the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films, &quot;Hedwig&#x27;s Theme&quot;, was also used in the fourth through eighth films. Like the main themes from &quot;Jaws&quot;, &quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;Superman&quot;, and &quot;Indiana Jones&quot;, fans have come to identify the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films with Williams&#x27;s themes. Williams was asked to return to score the film franchise&#x27;s final installment, &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2&quot;, but director David Yates said that &quot;their schedules simply did not align&quot;, as he would have had to provide Williams with a rough cut of the film sooner than was possible.

In 2013, Williams expressed interest in working on the &quot;Star Wars&quot; sequel trilogy, saying: &quot;Now we&#x27;re hearing of a new set of movies coming in 2015, 2016 ... so I need to make sure I&#x27;m still ready to go in a few years for what I hope would be continued work with George.&quot; In 2015, Williams scored &quot;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot;, earning him his 50th Academy Award nomination. In 2017, he wrote the music for &quot;Star Wars: The Last Jedi&quot;, the eighth episode of the saga. Williams contributed &quot;The Adventures of Han&quot; and several additional demos for the 2018 standalone &quot;Star Wars&quot; film &quot;&quot;, while John Powell wrote the film&#x27;s original score and adapted Williams&#x27;s music.

In March 2018, Williams announced that following &quot;Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker&quot; (2019), he would retire from composing music for the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise: &quot;We know J. J. Abrams is preparing one &quot;Star Wars&quot; movie now that I will hopefully do next year for him. I look forward to it. It will round out a series of nine, that will be quite enough for me.&quot; Williams also makes a cameo in the film as Oma Tres, a Kijimi bartender. In July 2018, Williams composed the main musical theme for Disneyland and Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios theme park attraction &quot;Star Wars: Galaxy&#x27;s Edge&quot;. William Ross, who conducted the symphonic recording of the theme with the London Symphony Orchestra on Williams&#x27;s behalf, additionally arranged Williams&#x27;s original composition in different musical contexts for use, recording nearly an hour of musical material at Abbey Road Studios in November 2018. Williams won the Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Composition for his &quot;Star Wars: Galaxy&#x27;s Edge Symphonic Suite&quot;. In 2022, he contributed the theme music for the &quot;Star Wars&quot; miniseries &quot;Obi-Wan Kenobi&quot;, which was subsequently adapted further by William Ross.

=== Other film and television works ===
Williams scored Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s final film, &quot;Family Plot&quot; (1976), as well as John Guillermin&#x27;s &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot; (1974), Clint Eastwood&#x27;s &quot;The Eiger Sanction&quot; (1975), John Frankenheimer&#x27;s &quot;Black Sunday&quot; (1977), John Badham&#x27;s &quot;Dracula&quot; (1979), Allan Arkush&#x27;s &quot;Heartbeeps&quot; (1981) and Frank Perry&#x27;s &quot;Monsignor&quot; (1982). He also contributed the Oscar and Golden Globe nominated song &quot;If We Were in Love&quot; (with lyrics by Alan &amp; Marilyn Bergman) to Franklin J. Schaffner&#x27;s &quot;Yes, Giorgio&quot; (1982).

For &quot;Family Plot&quot;, Hitchcock told Williams to remember one thing: &quot;Murder can be fun.&quot; He tipped his hat to Hitchcock&#x27;s frequent composer, Bernard Herrmann, and Hitchcock was pleased with the result. Williams would follow a similar approach when scoring Brian de Palma&#x27;s &quot;The Fury&quot; (1978). Kael called Williams &quot;a major collaborator&quot; on the film, writing that he had &quot;composed what may be as apt and delicately varied a score as any horror movie has ever had. He scares us without banshee melodramatics. He sets the mood under the opening titles: otherworldly, seductively frightening. The music cues us in.&quot;

That same year, Williams scored Richard Donner&#x27;s &quot;Superman&quot; (1978). Donner reportedly interrupted the demo premiere of the opening title by running onto the soundstage, exclaiming, &quot;The music actually says &#x27;Superman&#x27;!&quot; King writes that &quot;Donner had a theory that the three-note motif in the main theme—the one that makes you want to punch the air in triumph—is a musical evocation of &#x27;SU-per-MAN!. When asked if there was anything to that, Williams replied &quot;There&#x27;s &quot;everything&quot; to that.&quot; The score&#x27;s heroic and romantic themes, particularly the main march, the Superman fanfare and the love theme, &quot;Can You Read My Mind?&quot;, appeared in the subsequent Salkind/Cannon film sequels as well as &quot;Superman Returns&quot; (2006). The main march is set to return as part of John Murphy&#x27;s score to James Gunn&#x27;s &quot;Superman&quot; (2025), the first film of the DC Universe.

In 1985, NBC commissioned Williams to compose a television news music package for various network news spots. The package, which Williams named &quot;The Mission&quot;, consists of four movements, two of which are still used heavily by NBC today for &quot;Today&quot;, &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; and &quot;Meet the Press&quot;. In 1987, Williams scored George Miller&#x27;s &quot;The Witches of Eastwick&quot; (1987). In his Oscar-nominated score for Lawrence Kasdan&#x27;s &quot;The Accidental Tourist&quot; (1988), Williams developed the two main theme sections in different ways, turning the mood lighter or darker through orchestration and an unexpected use of synthesizers.

Other frequent collaborations with directors include Martin Ritt (&quot;Pete &#x27;n&#x27; Tillie&quot; (1972), &quot;Conrack&quot; (1974) and &quot;Stanley &amp; Iris&quot; (1990)), Mark Rydell (&quot;The Reivers&quot; (1969), &quot;The Cowboys&quot; (1972), &quot;Cinderella Liberty&quot; (1973) and &quot;The River&quot; (1984)), Oliver Stone (&quot;Born on the Fourth of July&quot; (1989), &quot;JFK&quot; (1991) and &quot;Nixon&quot; (1995)), and Chris Columbus (the first two &quot;Home Alone&quot; films (1990–1992), &quot;Stepmom&quot; (1998) and the first two &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films (2001-2002). Additional films Williams scored during this period include Harry Winer&#x27;s &quot;SpaceCamp&quot; (1986), Alan J. Pakula&#x27;s &quot;Presumed Innocent&quot; (1990), Ron Howard&#x27;s &quot;Far and Away&quot; (1992), Sydney Pollack&#x27;s &quot;Sabrina&quot; (1995), Barry Levinson&#x27;s &quot;Sleepers&quot; (1996), John Singleton&#x27;s &quot;Rosewood&quot; and Jean-Jacques Annaud&#x27;s &quot;Seven Years in Tibet&quot; (1997), Alan Parker&#x27;s &quot;Angela&#x27;s Ashes&quot; (1999), Roland Emmerich&#x27;s &quot;The Patriot&quot; (2000) and Rob Marshall&#x27;s &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; (2005).

Williams scored the 2013 film &quot;The Book Thief&quot;, his first collaboration with a director other than Spielberg since 2005. The score earned him an Academy Award, Golden Globe and BAFTA nominations and a Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Composition. It was his 44th nomination for Best Original Score (and 49th overall), setting a new record for the most nominations in that category (he tied Alfred Newman&#x27;s record of 43 nominations in 2013). In 2017, Williams scored the animated short film &quot;Dear Basketball&quot;, directed by Glen Keane and based on a poem by Kobe Bryant. In 2023, he was commissioned by ESPN to write an original composition titled &quot;Of Grit and Glory&quot; for the 2023 College Football Playoff National Championship.

==Classical works and conducting==
=== Boston Pops Orchestra ===
From 1980 to 1993, Williams served as the Boston Pops Orchestra&#x27;s principal conductor, succeeding Arthur Fiedler. Williams never met Fiedler in person but spoke to him by telephone. His arrival as the Pops&#x27; new leader in the spring of 1980 allowed him to devote part of the Pops&#x27; first PBS broadcast of the season to presenting his new compositions for &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;. Williams almost ended his tenure with the Pops in 1984 when some players hissed while sight-reading a new Williams composition in rehearsal; Williams abruptly left the session and tendered his resignation. He initially cited mounting conflicts with his film composing schedule but later admitted a perceived lack of discipline in, and respect from, the Pops&#x27; ranks, culminating in this latest instance. After entreaties by the management and personal apologies from the musicians, Williams withdrew his resignation and continued as principal conductor for nine more years. In 1995, he was succeeded by Keith Lockhart, the former associate conductor of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra and Cincinnati Pops Orchestra. Williams is now the Pops&#x27; laureate conductor, thus maintaining his affiliation with its parent Boston Symphony Orchestra. Williams leads the Pops on several occasions each year, particularly during their Holiday Pops season and typically for a week of concerts in May. He conducts an annual Film Night at both Boston Symphony Hall and Tanglewood, where he frequently enlists the Tanglewood Festival Chorus.

=== Compositions ===

Williams has written many concert pieces, including a symphony; a sinfonietta for wind ensemble; a concerto for horn written for Dale Clevenger, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra&#x27;s principal horn; a concerto for clarinet written for Michele Zukovsky, the Los Angeles Philharmonic&#x27;s principal clarinetist, in 1991; a cello concerto premiered by Yo-Yo Ma and the Boston Symphony Orchestra at Tanglewood in 1994; concertos for the flute and violin recorded by the London Symphony Orchestra; and a trumpet concerto, which was premiered by The Cleveland Orchestra and their principal trumpet Michael Sachs in September 1996. His bassoon concerto, &quot;The Five Sacred Trees&quot;, which was premiered by the New York Philharmonic and principal bassoon player Judith LeClair in 1995, was recorded for Sony Classical by Williams with LeClair and the London Symphony Orchestra. His &quot;Violin Concerto No. 2&quot; was written for and premiered by Anne-Sophie Mutter and the Boston Symphony Orchestra at Tanglewood in 2021, with Williams conducting.

Williams composed the &quot;Liberty Fanfare&quot; for the Statue of Liberty&#x27;s rededication; &quot;We&#x27;re Lookin&#x27; Good!&quot; for the Special Olympics in celebration of the 1987 International Summer Games; and themes for the 1984, 1988, 1996 and 2002 Olympic Games. One of his concert works, &quot;Seven for Luck&quot;, for soprano and orchestra, is a seven-piece song cycle based on the texts of former U.S. poet laureate Rita Dove. It had its world premiere by the Boston Symphony under Williams with soprano Cynthia Haymon.
Williams makes annual appearances with the Los Angeles Philharmonic at the Hollywood Bowl, and took part as conductor and composer in the orchestra&#x27;s opening gala concerts for the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2003, which included the premiere of his piece &quot;Soundings&quot;. In 2004, he served as the Grand Marshal for the Rose Parade and conducted &quot;The Star Spangled Banner&quot; at the Rose Bowl Game. In April 2005, Williams and the Boston Pops performed the &quot;Throne Room Finale&quot; from &quot;Star Wars&quot; at opening day in Fenway Park as the Boston Red Sox, having won their first World Series championship since 1918, received their championship rings. For Game 1 of the 2007 World Series, Williams conducted a brass-and-drum ensemble in a new dissonant arrangement of &quot;The Star Spangled Banner&quot;. He composed the quartet &quot;Air and Simple Gifts&quot; for the first inauguration of Barack Obama. The piece is based on the hymn &quot;Simple Gifts&quot;, made famous by Aaron Copland in &quot;Appalachian Spring&quot;. Williams chose the theme because he knew Obama admired Copland. It was performed by Yo-Yo Ma, violinist Itzhak Perlman, pianist Gabriela Montero and clarinetist Anthony McGill.

Williams has guest conducted &quot;The President&#x27;s Own&quot; United States Marine Band on several occasions, who commissioned him in 2013 to write &quot;Fanfare for The President&#x27;s Own&quot; (his first concert band work since his sinfonietta for wind ensemble) in honor of their 215th anniversary. In 2023, Williams was made an honorary U.S. Marine at the conclusion of his fifth concert with the Marine Band at the Kennedy Center in Washington DC.

In 2021, Williams conducted the world premiere of &quot;Overture to the Oscars&quot; at Tanglewood&#x27;s 2021 &quot;Film Night&quot;. This was followed in 2022 by a &quot;Fanfare for Solo Trumpet&quot;, written for the reopening of David Geffen Hall, and &quot;Centennial Overture&quot;, written in celebration of the 100th Anniversary of the Hollywood Bowl. He is currently completing a piano concerto for Emanuel Ax.

=== Conductor ===
In February 2004, April 2006, and September 2007, Williams conducted the New York Philharmonic at Avery Fisher Hall in New York City. The initial program was intended to be a one-time special event, and featured Williams&#x27;s medley of Oscar-winning film scores first performed at the previous year&#x27;s Academy Awards. Its unprecedented popularity led to two concerts in 2006, fundraising gala events featuring personal recollections by Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg. Continued demand fueled three more concerts in 2007, which all sold out. These featured a tribute to the musicals of Stanley Donen and served as the New York Philharmonic season&#x27;s opening event. After a three-season absence, Williams conducted the Philharmonic once again in October 2011.
After over a ten year break, Williams returned to New York in 2022 to conduct the Philadelphia Orchestra for a benefit concert at Carnegie Hall, with special guest violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter. The next year, he was feted at a gala at David Geffen Hall by Spielberg, celebrating their nearly fifty-year collaboration. In 2024, he returned to headline another gala at Carnegie Hall with the Philadelphia Orchestra, this time with Yo-Yo Ma as his special guest.

Williams also conducted the National Symphony Orchestra, the U.S. Army Herald Trumpets, the Joint Armed Forces Chorus, and the Choral Arts Society of Washington in his new arrangement of &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; for the anthem&#x27;s 200th anniversary. The performance was held at &quot;A Capitol Fourth&quot;, an Independence Day celebration concert in Washington, D.C., on July 4, 2014. On April 13, 2017, at Star Wars Celebration Orlando, Williams performed a surprise concert with the Orlando Philharmonic Orchestra featuring &quot;Princess Leia&#x27;s Theme&quot; (a tribute to the recently deceased Carrie Fisher), &quot;The Imperial March&quot; and &quot;Main Title&quot;, followed by George Lucas saying, &quot;The secret sauce of Star Wars, the greatest composer-conductor in the universe, John Williams&quot;.
Anne-Sophie Mutter, introduced to Williams by their mutual friend André Previn, collaborated with Williams on an album, &quot;Across the Stars&quot;, on which Mutter played themes and pieces from Williams&#x27;s film scores in his new arrangements for violin. It was released in August 2019. The Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra invited Williams to lead concerts in January 2020, his first engagement with a European orchestra, for an all-Williams concert featuring Mutter as soloist. The concert included many pieces from &quot;Across the Stars&quot;. The resulting concert album, &quot;John Williams in Vienna&quot;, became the bestselling orchestral album of 2020, reaching the top 10 in many countries and topping the U.S. and UK classical charts. The orchestra also commissioned a new procedural from Williams for their annual , replacing the 1924 fanfare by Richard Strauss.

Williams conducted the Berlin Philharmonic from October 14–16, 2021, marking his second engagement with a European orchestra and his first with the Berlin Philharmonic. In 2022, in celebration of his 90th birthday, Williams conducted the Vienna Philharmonic in March, and was honored on August 20 with a tribute at Tanglewood. The tribute at Tanglewood featured James Taylor, Yo-Yo Ma, and Branford Marsalis. The Boston Symphony Orchestra performed some of Williams&#x27; best-known music, with Williams conducting the &quot;Raiders March&quot; from the Indiana Jones movies at the end of the show. Williams made a surprise appearance at the U.S. premiere of the &quot;Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny&quot; (2023) on June 15, where he conducted themes with a live symphony orchestra. Also present were Spielberg, Lucas, Harrison Ford, and James Mangold. Later that year, he conducted the Saito Kinen Orchestra in Matsumoto and Tokyo, Japan, marking his return to the country for the first time in over thirty years.

==Personal life==
In 1956, Williams married Barbara Ruick, an American actress and singer, and they remained married until her death in 1974. The couple had three children: Jennifer (Jenny) Williams Gruska (b. 1956), Mark Towner Williams (b. 1958), and Joseph Williams (b. 1960); the last is best known as the lead singer of Toto. In 1980, Williams married Samantha Winslow, a photographer.

== Awards, recognition and legacy ==
Williams is regarded as one of the most influential film composers. His work has influenced other composers of film, popular, and contemporary classical music. Norwegian composer Marcus Paus argues that Williams&#x27; &quot;satisfying way of embodying dissonance and avant-garde techniques within a larger tonal framework&quot; makes him &quot;one of the great composers of any century&quot;. Similarly, his film music has clear influences from other classical and film composers, including Holst, Stravinsky, Korngold, and others. But while many have specifically referenced the similarities, these are generally attributed to the natural influence of one composer on another. The &quot;Boston Globe&quot; named Williams as &quot;the most successful composer of film music in the history of the medium&quot;.

Williams has been nominated for 54 Academy Awards, winning five; six Emmy Awards, winning three; 25 Golden Globe Awards, winning four; 71 Grammy Awards, winning 26; and has received seven British Academy Film Awards. With 54 Oscar nominations, Williams currently holds the record for the most Oscar nominations for a living person and is the second most nominated person in Academy Awards history behind Walt Disney&#x27;s 59. Williams is the only person to be nominated for an Academy Award in seven different decades (the 1960s, 70s, 80s, 90s, 2000s, 2010s, and 2020s). He is also the oldest person, at age 91, ever to be nominated for an Academy Award. Forty-eight of Williams&#x27;s Oscar nominations are for Best Original Score and five are for Best Original Song. He won four Oscars for Best Original Score (&quot;Jaws&quot;, &quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;, &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot;) and one for Best Scoring: Adaptation and Original Song Score &quot;(Fiddler on the Roof)&quot;.

Williams was the subject of an hour-long documentary for the BBC in 1980, and was featured in a report on &quot;20/20&quot; in 1983. He has received several academic honors, including an Honorary Doctorate of Music from Berklee College of Music in 1980, as well as Honorary Doctor of Music degrees from Boston College in 1993, from Harvard University in 2017, and from the University of Pennsylvania in 2021. Williams was made an honorary brother of Kappa Kappa Psi at Boston University in 1993, upon his impending retirement from the Boston Pops. Since 1988, Williams has been honored with 15 Sammy Film Music Awards, the longest-running awards for film music recordings. In 2000, Williams received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

Williams has been inducted into the American Classical Music Hall of Fame and the Hollywood Bowl Hall of Fame. Williams was honored with the annual Richard Kirk award at the 1999 BMI Film and TV Awards, recognizing his contribution to film and television music. In 2004, he received a Kennedy Center Honor. He won a Classic Brit Award in 2005 for his soundtrack work of the previous year. Williams has won the Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Composition for his scores for &quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;, &quot;Superman&quot;, &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;, &quot;Angela&#x27;s Ashes&quot;, &quot;Munich&quot;, &quot;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot;, and &quot;The Book Thief&quot;. The competition includes not only composers of film scores, but also composers of instrumental music of any genre, including composers of classical fare such as symphonies and chamber music.

In 2003, the International Olympic Committee accorded Williams its highest individual honor, the Olympic Order. In 2009, Williams received the National Medal of Arts in the White House in Washington, D.C., for his achievements in symphonic music for films, and &quot;as a pre-eminent composer and conductor [whose] scores have defined and inspired modern movie-going for decades&quot;. In 2012, Williams received the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music. In 2013, Williams was presented with the Ken Burns Lifetime Achievement Award. In 2016, Williams was made a &quot;Chevalier De L&#x27;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres&quot; – Government of France In 2018, the performing rights organization Broadcast Music, Inc. established The John Williams Award, of which Williams became the first recipient. That same year, Williams received the Grammy Trustees Award, a Special Merit Award presented to individuals who, during their careers in music, have made significant contributions other than performance (and some performers through 1983) to the field of recording. He additionally received a President&#x27;s Medal award from The Juilliard School and announced during the ceremony that he intended to bequeath his entire library of concert and film music scores, as well as his sketchbooks, to the college.

In 2020, Williams won the Grammy Award for &quot;Best Instrumental Composition&quot; for composing &quot;Star Wars: Galaxy&#x27;s Edge Symphonic Suite&quot;, and he received his 52nd Oscar nomination for &quot;Best Original Score&quot; at the 92nd Academy Awards for &quot;Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.&quot; In 2020, Williams received the Gold Medal of the Royal Philharmonic Society as well as the Princess of Asturias Award for the Arts (jointly with Ennio Morricone). In 2022, Williams was appointed an Honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) by Queen Elizabeth II, &quot;for services to film music&quot;, one of the final two honorary knighthoods awarded during the Queen&#x27;s seventy-year reign. In 2024, Williams was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Letters (jointly with Terence Blanchard) and received the Disney Legends award at the Honda Center in August of the same year.

<doc id="154556" wikidata="Q370293" url="?curid=154556" title="John Williams (guitarist)">
<text>John Christopher Williams (born 24 April 1941) is an Australian-born classical guitarist renowned for his ensemble playing as well as his interpretation and promotion of the modern classical guitar repertoire. In 1973, he shared a Grammy Award in the Best Chamber Music Performance category with fellow guitarist Julian Bream for &quot;Together&quot; (released in the US as &quot;Julian and John (Works by Lawes, Carulli, Albéniz, Granados)&quot;). Guitar historian Graham Wade has said that &quot;John is perhaps the most technically accomplished guitarist the world has seen.&quot;

== Early life ==
John Williams is an only child who was born on 24 April 1941 in Melbourne to an English father, Len Williams, who bought John, at age four, his first guitar with a modified neck. Len would later found the Spanish Guitar Centre in London, England. John&#x27;s mother Melaan (&quot;née&quot; Ah Ket) was the daughter of William Ah Ket, the first Australian barrister of Chinese heritage. In 1952, the family moved to England, where John attended Friern Barnet Grammar School, London. 

Williams was initially taught guitar by his father, who was a musically disciplined and accomplished classical guitarist. From the age of 11, Williams attended summer courses with Andrés Segovia at the Accademia Musicale Chigiana in Siena, Italy. He attended the Royal College of Music in London, from 1956 to 1959, studying piano because the college did not have a guitar section. In 1958, when he was 17 years old, he made his musical debut performing publicly at London&#x27;s Wigmore Hall. Upon graduating from his college, he was invited to create and then to run their guitar department for its first two years of life. Williams maintains links with the college (and also with the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester).

== Classical guitarist ==
Since his first professional performance at the Wigmore Hall in London on 6 November 1958, Williams has performed throughout the world and has made regular appearances on radio and TV. He has extended the repertoire by commissioning guitar concertos from composers such as Peter Sculthorpe, Stephen Dodgson, André Previn, Patrick Gowers, Richard Harvey, and Steve Gray. Williams has recorded albums of duets with fellow guitarists Julian Bream and Paco Peña.

Williams is a visiting professor and honorary member of the Royal Academy of Music in London.

Williams mostly uses Greg Smallman guitars, after using Spanish Fleta during the 1970s.

== Thoughts on guitar education and teaching ==
Williams has expressed his frustration and concern with guitar education and teaching, that it is too one-sided, i.e., focusing only on solo playing, instead of giving guitar students a better education, including ensemble playing, sight-reading and a focus on phrasing and tone production and variation. Williams notes that &quot;students [are] preoccupied with fingerings and not notes, much less sounds&quot;; some are able &quot;to play [...] difficult solo works from memory&quot;, but &quot;have a very poor sense of ensemble [playing] or timing&quot;. He notes that students play works from the solo repertoire that are often too difficult, so that the teachers often put more &quot;emphasis [...] on getting through the notes rather than playing the real substance of each note&quot;. To encourage phrasing, tone production and all-around musicianship, Williams arranges for students to play together in ensembles, choosing works from the existing classical music repertoire, such as the &quot;easier Haydn String Quartets&quot;.

== Other musical genres ==
Although Williams is best known as a performing classical guitarist, he has explored many different musical genres, as well as being a composer and arranger. 

Williams is perhaps best known to the general public for his recording of the Stanley Myers piece &quot;Cavatina&quot;. The piece originally included only the first few bars of the tune as it is known today, but at Williams&#x27; request Myers rewrote and expanded it into the better-known guitar arrangement. After this transformation, it was used for a film, &quot;The Walking Stick&quot;, in 1970. In 1973, Cleo Laine wrote lyrics and recorded it as the song &quot;He Was Beautiful&quot; accompanied by Williams. The guitar instrumental version became a worldwide hit single when it was used as the theme tune to the Oscar-winning film &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; (1978).

Between 1978 and 1984, Williams was a member of the instrumental fusion group Sky, with whom he recorded six successful albums and scored a UK Top Five single with &quot;Toccata&quot;. At the invitation of producer Martin Lewis, he created a highly acclaimed classical-rock fusion duet with rock guitarist Pete Townshend of The Who on Townshend&#x27;s anthemic &quot;Won&#x27;t Get Fooled Again&quot; for the 1979 Amnesty International benefit show &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball&quot;. The duet featured on the resulting album and the film version of the show, bringing Williams to the broader attention of the rock audience.

== Personal life ==
Williams and his third wife, artist Kathy Panama (whom he married on New Year&#x27;s Eve 2000), reside in London (Hampstead) and Cornwall. He has a daughter, Kate Williams, who is an established jazz pianist. He also has a son, Charlie, by his second wife, the television presenter Sue Cook.

== Discography ==
== Awards and recognitions ==
Williams was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1980, and an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) in the 1987 Australia Day Honours, &quot;For service to music&quot;.

===Bernard Heinze Memorial Award===
The Sir Bernard Heinze Memorial Award is given to a person who has made an outstanding contribution to music in Australia.

<text>Marks and Spencer plc (commonly abbreviated to M&amp;S and colloquially known as Marks or Marks &amp; Sparks) is a major British multinational retailer based in London, England, that specialises in selling clothing, beauty products, home products and food products. It is listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.

M&amp;S was founded in 1884 by Michael Marks and Thomas Spencer in Leeds. Through its television advertising it asserts the exclusive nature and luxury of its food and beverages. It also offers an online food delivery service through a joint venture with Ocado.

In 1998, the company became the first British retailer to make a pre-tax profit of over £1 billion, although it then went into a sudden slump taking the company and its stakeholders by surprise. In November 2008 the company began to sell branded goods such as Kellogg&#x27;s corn flakes. In November 2009, it was announced that Marc Bolland, formerly of Morrisons, would take over as chief executive from executive chairman Sir Stuart Rose. In the early 21st century clothing sales fell, while food sales increased, after the company dropped its traditional St. Michael brand. 

On 22 May 2018, the company announced that it would close over 100 stores by 2022 in a &quot;radical&quot; plan. On 18 August 2020, M&amp;S stated that they would cut 7,000 jobs over the next three months owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. In May 2021, the company announced plans to close another 30 shops over the next 10 years as part of its turnaround plan. In its 2024 results the company stated that it was aiming at reducing locations to 180 full-line and 420 food stores in the UK, commenting that legacy stores were more expensive to operate.

==History==
===Establishment===

The company was founded by a partnership between Michael Marks, a Polish Jew born in Slonim (now Belarus), who had migrated to Leeds, England in the early 1880s, and Thomas Spencer, a cashier from the English market town of Skipton in North Yorkshire. Marks worked for a company in Leeds called Barran, which employed Jewish migrants (see Sir John Barran, 1st Baronet). In 1884, he met Isaac Jowitt Dewhirst while looking for work. Dewhirst lent Marks £5 (), which he used to establish his penny bazaar on Kirkgate Market in Leeds. 

Dewhirst also taught him a little English. Dewhirst&#x27;s cashier was Thomas Spencer, a bookkeeper, whose second wife, Agnes, helped improve Marks&#x27;s English. In 1894, when Marks acquired a permanent stall in the Leeds covered market, he invited Spencer to become his partner.

In 1901, Marks moved to the Birkenhead open market in North West England, amalgamating his business with Spencer&#x27;s. In 1903, the two men were allocated stall numbers 11 and 12 in the centre aisle; there they opened the penny bazaar. The company left Birkenhead Market on 24 February 1923.

The next few years saw Michael Marks and Tom Spencer move the original Leeds penny bazaar to 20, Cheetham Hill Road, Manchester, and they also opened market stalls in many locations around the North West of England. Spencer died in 1905, and Marks in 1907; Michael Marks&#x27; son Simon became chairman in 1916. Under Simon Marks the company acquired other chains of penny bazaars, growing into a retail empire.
===Domestic growth===
Textiles were first sold in 1926, and food from 1931. Marks and Spencer, known colloquially as &quot;Marks and Sparks&quot;, or &quot;M&amp;S&quot;, made its reputation until the 1990s with a policy of selling 99% British-made goods. It entered into long-term relationships with British manufacturers, and sold clothes under the &quot;St Michael&quot; brand, after Michael Marks, which was introduced in 1928, and extended to food in 1941, replacing all other brands by 1956. It also accepted the return of unwanted items, giving a full cash refund if the receipt was shown, no matter how long ago the product was purchased, which was unusual for the time.
During the Second World War in 1941, M&amp;S staff raised £5,000 to pay for a Supermarine Spitfire fighter aircraft called &quot;The Marksman&quot;.
By 1950, virtually all goods were sold under the &quot;St Michael&quot; label. M&amp;S lingerie, women&#x27;s clothes and girls&#x27; school uniform were branded under the &quot;St Margaret&quot; label until the whole range of general merchandise became &quot;St Michael&quot;. Simon Marks, son of Michael Marks, died in 1964, after fifty-six years&#x27; service. Israel Sieff, the son-in-law of Michael Marks, took over as chairman and in 1968 John Salisse became a company director. A cautious international expansion began with the introduction of Asian food in 1974. M&amp;S opened stores in continental Europe in 1975 and in Ireland four years later.

The company put its main emphasis on quality, including a 1957 stocking size measuring system. In 1948, it established a Food Technology department. Staff in the canteens and cafeterias had hygiene training by the mid-1950s. For most of its history, it also had a reputation for offering fair value for money. When this reputation began to waver, it encountered serious difficulties. Arguably, M&amp;S has historically been an iconic retailer of &#x27;British Quality Goods&#x27;.

The uncompromising attitude towards customer relations was summarised by the 1953 slogan: &quot;The customer &quot;is&quot; always and completely right!&quot;

Energy efficiency was improved by the addition of thermostatically controlled refrigerators in 1963.

M&amp;S began selling Christmas cakes and Christmas puddings in 1958. In an effort to improve the quality of their Swiss rolls, they hired the food expert Nat Goldberg, who made a major improvement across their entire cake range, which had lost the public&#x27;s favour a few years earlier. As a later measure to improve food quality, food labelling was improved and &quot;sell by dates&quot; were phased in between 1970 and 1972.

Smoking was banned as a fire hazard from all M&amp;S shops in 1959.

===Terror attack===
The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine bombed the Oxford Street store of Marks &amp; Spencer in London on 18 July 1969.

===International expansion===
In 1972, Marcus Sieff became chairman, remaining in place until 1984, and emphasising the importance of good staff relations to the tradition of the store while extending staff benefits to areas such as restaurants and chiropody.

Marks &amp; Spencer expanded into Canada in 1973, and at one point had 47 stores. Despite efforts to improve its image, the chain was never able to move beyond its reputation there as a stodgy retailer, one that catered primarily to senior citizens and expatriate Britons. The shops in Canada were smaller than British outlets, and did not carry the same selection. In the late 1990s, further efforts were made to modernise them and also expand the customer base. Unprofitable locations were closed. Nevertheless, the Canadian operations continued to lose money, and the last 38 shops in Canada were closed in 1999.

Expansion into France began with shops opening in Paris at Boulevard Haussmann and Lyon in 1975, followed by a second Paris shop at Rosny 2 in 1977. Further expansion into other French and Belgian cities followed into the 1980s. Although the Paris shops remained popular and profitable, the Western European operation as a whole did not fare as well and eighteen shops were sold in 2001. In April 2011, M&amp;S changed direction again, with a plan to reopen a store that would sell food as well as clothing. In addition, the group opened several food outlets throughout Paris. The first branch opened on 24 November 2011, on the Champs-Élysées in a ceremony attended by the company&#x27;s CEO Marc Bolland, the model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, and the British Ambassador to France, Sir Peter Westmacott.

In 1988, the company acquired Brooks Brothers, an American clothing company and Kings Food Markets, a US food chain.

In early 1980, M&amp;S became the first British supermarket chain to sell packaged sandwiches, beginning with five shops. Demand was so high that M&amp;S enlisted suppliers to industrialise the process, and other supermarkets followed. By 1990, the British sandwich industry was worth £1 billion.

===21st century===
====Financial decline====

M&amp;S&#x27;s profits peaked in the financial year 1997–1998. At the time it was seen as a continuing success story, but with hindsight it is considered that during Sir Richard Greenbury&#x27;s tenure as head of the company, profit margins were pushed to untenable levels, and the loyalty of its customers was seriously eroded. Another factor was the company&#x27;s refusal until 2001 to accept any credit cards except its own chargecard. These factors combined to send M&amp;S into a sudden slump: its profits fell from more than a billion pounds in 1997 and 1998, to £145 million in the year ended 31 March 2001.

In 2002, with changes in its business focus such as accepting credit cards, the introduction of the &quot;Per Una&quot; clothing range designed by George Davies, and a redesign of its underlying business model, profits recovered somewhat. In 2004, M&amp;S was in the throes of an attempted takeover by Arcadia Group and BHS boss, Philip Green. On 12 July a recovery plan was announced which would involve selling off its financial services business M&amp;S Money to HSBC Bank, buying control of the &quot;Per Una&quot; range, closing the Gateshead Lifestore and stopping the expansion of its Simply Food line of shops. Philip Green withdrew his takeover bid after failing to get sufficient backing from shareholders.

In February 2007, M&amp;S announced the opening of the world&#x27;s largest M&amp;S shop outside the UK at Dubai Festival City. On 2 October 2008, M&amp;S opened its first mainland China shop which is in Shanghai. Problems with the supply chain for the first few months of opening led Stuart Rose, M&amp;S chairman, to describe failures in &quot;basic shopkeeping&quot;.

====Restructuring====

Twenty-two unprofitable and minor food stores, including branches in Ripon and Balham, were closed in early 2009 as part of a cost-cutting measure. In August 2010, it was confirmed that the Grantham branch of M&amp;S would close, along with two other Lincolnshire branches in Skegness and Scunthorpe, owing to low sales in these older format stores. These decisions met with protests from the local communities and petitions were signed in support of retaining the stores, although the closures went ahead.

The Retail Knowledge Bank conducted an audit of the company&#x27;s brands in August 2010, and revealed that sales of womenswear were at a 10-year low. &quot;Drapers&quot; magazine claimed that Per Una was the only clothing brand not at risk of being axed while Marc Bolland, the chief executive, considered which brands would be retained.

On 9 November 2010, Bolland revealed plans to strengthen the company&#x27;s overall brand image and targeting sales of between £800 million and £1 billion for which company will increase capital expenditure to £850 million to £900 million over the next three years to fund the plans. The plan also involved the discontinuation of its &#x27;Portfolio&#x27; fashion brand and the sale of electrical products. The company announced a new marketing strapline, &#x27;Only at M&amp;S&#x27;, and that it would revamp its website. Bolland ordered a new store design in May 2011, and it was announced that the company would spend around £600 million between 2011 and 2014 on its UK stores.

In May 2013, the &quot;Best of British&quot; range was launched along with an overhaul of &quot;Per Una&quot; and &quot;Indigo&quot;. Patrick Bousquet-Chavanne became the marketing director, succeeding Steven Sharp in July. Bolland vowed to bring &quot;quality and style back&quot;. In November 2013, it was revealed that Bill Adderley, founder of homeware chain Dunelm Group, had built a £250 million stake in M&amp;S over the past 18 months. This disclosure was made under stock market rules which require any holding larger than a 3 per cent share to be made public.

On 7 January 2016, it was announced that Marc Bolland, who has been CEO since 2010, would step down on 2 April 2016, and be replaced by Steve Rowe, head of clothing, and previously head of the food business. In 2018, Stuart Machin was appointed managing director of Food to lead the transformation of the food business. On 28 June 2024, the company announced that it would be launching a new service for clothing repairs and alterations in partnership with the Sojo company.

====Store culls====
Some 30 stores were identified for closure in 2015–2016. Several smaller stores were identified for closure in November 2017. On 31 January 2018, another fourteen stores were identified for closure in April 2018, and eight other stores were earmarked for closure later, pending consultation. On 23 May 2018, M&amp;S managers confirmed that 14 more shops were to be closed and another 86 were under investigation, and thus put on notice, because of falling corporate sales and customer footfall. This would take the total to over 100 closing by 2022, On 15 January 2019, the company named the next wave of 17 stores earmarked for closure. In May 2021, the company announced plans to close another 30 shops over the next 10 years as part of its turnaround plan, and in September 2021 it was confirmed that half of the French stores had been closed due to supply chain issues arising from Brexit. In its results for the 52 weeks ending on 30 March 2024, the company stated that it was aiming at having 180 full-line and 420 food stores in the UK, commenting that legacy stores were more expensive to operate.

In March 2021, M&amp;S announced it intended to redevelop its largest store, the Marble Arch branch on Oxford Street in London, replacing it with a 10-storey building with two-and-a-half floors of shop space below several floors of offices. Despite protests from groups including Save Britain&#x27;s Heritage, The Twentieth Century Society and Create Streets, the plans were approved by Westminster City Council in November 2021, and Mayor of London Sadiq Khan chose not to intervene. However, in April 2022, Communities Secretary Michael Gove blocked the plans to allow time for the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities to review the proposed redevelopment. In June 2022, Gove ordered a public enquiry into the plans; M&amp;S said it was &quot;bewildered&quot; by his &quot;baseless&quot; decision. A two-week planning enquiry, starting in October 2022, looked at whether the project complied with planning rules concerning heritage and the historic environment and also address environmental concerns, notably the release of almost 40,000 tonnes of embodied carbon into the atmosphere caused by the construction of the replacement structure. In July 2023, Gove rejected the plans to demolish and redevelop the store saying it conflicted with policies on heritage and design, and involved significant embodied carbon impact and waste. As well as overruling Westminster City Council and the Mayor of London, Gove also overruled his planning inspector, David Nicholson, who had recommended the project should go ahead due to its importance to the viability of the Oxford Street area. M&amp;S CEO Stuart Machin, calling the decision &quot;utterly pathetic&quot; and a &quot;shortsighted act of self-sabotage&quot;. M&amp;S subsequently launched a legal challenge against Gove&#x27;s decision. In November 2023, the High Court allowed M&amp;S to proceed with a judicial review, and after a two-day hearing on 13–14 February 2024, Gove&#x27;s decision to block demolition was quashed by a High Court judge on 1 March 2024. In December 2024, Gove&#x27;s successor Angela Rayner approved the store&#x27;s demolition, citing the advantages of a concentrated development in a highly accessible location, the employment and regeneration benefits, and &quot;potential harm to the vitality and viability&quot; of London&#x27;s West End if permission had been refused.

====New management====
In May 2021, Machin&#x27;s remit had expanded as he was appointed joint Chief Operating Officer taking oversight responsibility for Store and Central Operations, Property, Store Development, Technology, People and the Island of Ireland whilst remaining the Food Managing Director. In March 2022, it was announced that chief executive (CEO) Steve Rowe would step down after six years in role. Rowe stayed on as an advisor before officially leaving the company in July 2022. Machin was announced as his successor as CEO, with Katie Bickerstaffe assisting as co-CEO.

====Recent history====
In July 2022, the company agreed to buy the logistics firm Gist Limited for £145 million. In November 2022, it was reported that the company had acquired the intellectual property developed by collapsed fashion marketplace Thread, and hired some former Thread staff including co-founder Kieran O&#x27;Neill, with the aim of adding personalised recommendations to the M&amp;S website.

===Archives===
The M&amp;S company archive is held in the Michael Marks Building at the University of Leeds. The archive has permanent museum-style displays and hosts temporary exhibitions.

==Corporate affairs==
===Head office locations===

The headquarters of M&amp;S had been since 1957 at Michael House, 55 Baker Street, London. This had formerly been the Baker Street Bazaar which had been destroyed in a fire in 1940. The site was redeveloped by M&amp;S, under the direction of the then Sir Simon Marks, as the company had outgrown its previous Bayswater HQ. In 2004, the company moved to a new headquarters designed by Mossessian &amp; Partners at Waterside House, in Paddington Basin, London.

As well as the main offices in London, there are a number of other head office sites across the UK; Stockley Park (IT Services), Salford Quays (Marks &amp; Spencer Shared Services Ltd. which provides human resources, and finance administration) and Chester (M&amp;S Bank joint venture and Retail Customer Services).

The company has overseas sourcing offices in Malaysia, Hong Kong, Thailand, India, Bangladesh, Turkey, mainland China, Ireland, Italy, Indonesia, and Sri Lanka.

===Financial performance===
Financial performance has been as follows:
&quot;Until 1999 M&amp;S&#x27;s financial year ended on 31 March. Since then, the company has changed to reporting for 52- or 53-week periods, ending on variable dates.&quot;

===Social and environmental policy===
====&quot;Look Behind the Label&quot;====
In 2006, the &quot;Look Behind the Label&quot; marketing campaign was introduced. The aim of this campaign was to highlight to customers the various ethical and environmentally friendly aspects of the production and sourcing methods engaged in by M&amp;S including: Fairtrade products, sustainable fishing and environmentally friendly textile dyes. All coffee and tea sold in M&amp;S stores is now Fairtrade. In addition, the company offers clothing lines made from Fairtrade cotton in selected departments.
On 15 January 2007, M&amp;S launched an initiative known as &quot;Plan A&quot;, to dramatically increase the environmental sustainability of the business within five years and expected to cost £200 million.

The plan covers &quot;100 commitments over five years to address the key social and environmental challenges facing M&amp;S today and in the future&quot; with the tag-line &quot;Because there is no Plan B&quot;. The commitments span five themes: climate change, waste, sustainable raw materials, &#x27;fair partnership&#x27; and health, with the aim that, by 2012, it will:
* Become carbon neutral
* Send no waste to landfill
* Extend sustainable sourcing
* Help improve the lives of people in their supply chain
* Help customers and employees live a healthier life-style

Despite an 18% fall in the share price in January 2008, following the publication of their latest trading statement, the company confirmed that they would be continuing with the plan, saying that there were &#x27;compelling commercial—as well as moral—reasons to do so&#x27;.

M&amp;S introduced a reusable hessian bag in 2007 as part of the plan, aiming to reduce the number of plastic bags used within five years. This was followed in May 2008 by the introduction of a 5p charge for standard sized carrier bags used for food purchases (before this charge became compulsory). All profits from the sale of food bags originally went to the charity Groundwork UK; M&amp;S launched the &quot;Forever Fish&quot; campaign in June 2011 and switched funding to that campaign to promote protection of marine wildlife in the UK.

While becoming carbon neutral the company has committed to use carbon offsetting only as a last resort, restricted to cases &quot;where it is required by government or where the technology for green air or road transport will not be available for the foreseeable future&quot;.

As of August 2008, M&amp;S had three wind turbines in operation, one at Methlick and two near Strichen, which generate enough power to supply three stores via the National Grid. In April 2009, the company began purchasing 2.6 TWh of renewable energy (wind and hydroelectric) from Npower, enough to power all Marks &amp; Spencer stores and offices in England and Wales.

In 2012, the company was awarded European Business Award for the Environment (Management category) by the European Union for Plan A.

====Charity work====
M&amp;S has sold a wide range of charitable women&#x27;s clothes for Breakthrough Breast Cancer for many years and the Ashbourne store collected a total of £2,000 for a local hospital&#x27;s new ECG machine in 2010. In 2011 M&amp;S launched a clothes recycling initiative in partnership with Oxfam.

In 2015, M&amp;S partnered with community investment platform Neighbourly to help them distribute unsold surplus food and non-food items to small charities and community groups in the UK and Ireland. In March 2020, M&amp;S made a £100,000 donation to the Neighbourly Community Fund and a £100,000 donation to the National Emergencies Trust Coronavirus Appeal to help communities affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Stores==
===UK and Ireland===

The largest shop is near Marble Arch, on Oxford Street in London, which has around of shop floor (as noted above, a proposed redevelopment of this store was blocked in April 2022, and then successfully appealed in February 2024). The second largest is in Cheshire Oaks, Ellesmere Port, which is the largest store outside of London. The third largest shop is at the Gemini Retail Park in Warrington. In 1999 M&amp;S opened its shop in Manchester&#x27;s Exchange Square, which was destroyed in the 1996 Manchester bombing and rebuilt. At re-opening, it was the largest M&amp;S shop with of retail space, but half was subsequently sold to Selfridges, the company&#x27;s second site in Manchester. The smallest branch is a &#x27;Marks &amp; Spencer Penny Bazaar&#x27; clearance outlet located in the Grainger Market in Newcastle upon Tyne.

M&amp;S has opened a number of stores at out of town locations since a trend to build shopping centres away from town centres became popular in the 1980s. The first was at the MetroCentre, Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, which opened in 1986. Another notable example is the store at the Merry Hill Shopping Centre at Brierley Hill, West Midlands. This store opened on 23 October 1990 shortly after the closure of stores in the nearby town centres of Dudley and West Bromwich; the Merry Hill store was not originally intended to replace these two town centre stores, but both the Dudley and West Bromwich stores had experienced a downturn in trade as the opening of the Merry Hill store loomed, and both stores were closed on 25 August 1990.

Before Christmas 2006, twenty-two M&amp;S shops were open for 24-hour trading including stores at Bolton, Middlebrook and at the Abbey Centre, Newtownabbey, Northern Ireland.

In the Republic of Ireland, the company operates 17 stores employing 2,000 employees. Irish stores stock a range of Irish branded M&amp;S products and M&amp;S products part of its global network. As of September 2021, M&amp;S Ireland stores are restructuring their product line for the Irish market due to EU-UK trade issues, with up to 800 products due to be dropped in Ireland. Furthermore, M&amp;S Ireland confirmed it will increase the amount of Irish goods stocked at its stores.

===International===

The company reopened its store in Paris on 24 November 2011, following the launch of a new French website on 11 October 2011. In the Philippines, the Rustans Group of Companies serves as the official franchise partner and operates a total of 18 M&amp;S shops, the largest of which is located in Greenbelt Mall. A new store opened on 17 April 2013 in Kalverstraat in Amsterdam, Netherlands, more than 10 years after closure of the previous store. On 17 September 2013 the British ambassador to the Netherlands, Sir Geoffrey Adams, opened the first Dutch Marks &amp; Spencer Food pilot store at a BP petrol station in Bijleveld beside the A12 motorway. There are over 300 stores in some 40 overseas locations.

On 11 November 2013, Marks &amp; Spencer announced &quot;that it is set to have about 80 stores open in the [Indian] region by 2016 as part of its strategy to become a leading international, multichannel retailer&quot; with partner Reliance Retail. It opened a flagship store in Bandra in Mumbai. M&amp;S sales of lingerie accounts for more than a fifth of the sales in the Indian market, with total lingerie sales increasing by a third during the last six months of 2013. In May 2014 Marks &amp; Spencer announced that their intention was now to open 100 stores in the country by 2016.

In the Netherlands, as of 2015, M&amp;S had a supermarket in the expensive Kalverstraat shopping street in Amsterdam, as well as a larger store including clothing in The Hague. A number of BP petrol stations in the Western area of the Netherlands included M&amp;S convenience food stores. In 2016, M&amp;S was due to open a much larger store in Amsterdam, with a direct underground link to a new metro station. However, in November 2016 the company announced that they were closing all of their stores on the European mainland, something that did not actually happen. Nevertheless, they closed both of their stores in the Netherlands.

Marks &amp; Spencer owns 51 stores in Turkey as of 2022. Fiba Retail is the sole agent authorised to open Marks &amp; Spencer stores in Turkey and Ukraine region.

Stores in the territories of Hong Kong and Macau were sold in early 2018 to Al-Futtaim Group, a Dubai-based long-term franchise partner.

In September 2021, M&amp;S confirmed the closure of 11 stores in France and ended its partnership with SFH, saying it was &quot;near impossible for us to serve fresh and chilled products to customers&quot; following the UK&#x27;s exit from the European Union. The company would still operate nine smaller stores in or near major travel hubs.

==Store formats==
===Full line stores===
M&amp;S core shops typically feature a selection of the company&#x27;s clothing, homeware and beauty ranges and an M&amp;S Foodhall (formerly Simply Food). The range of clothing sold and the space given to it depends on the location and customer demographic (an example would be that some London shops do not stock the Classic Collection, but stock Limited Edition and a full Autograph range). Select locations feature an M&amp;S Café. The current store format was designed by Urban Salon Architects in 2009.

===Food hall (in-store)===
All the St Michael Food hall supermarkets were renamed &quot;M&amp;S Food hall&quot; when Marks &amp; Spencer dropped the &quot;St Michael&quot; brand in 2000. Each M&amp;S Foodhall sells groceries, which historically were all under the Marks &amp; Spencer brand. However, in 2006 the company began selling a limited range of other brands, such as Coca-Cola and Stella Artois, without reducing the number of M&amp;S goods they sold. This marked the first time in its 125-year history that Marks &amp; Spencer had sold any brands other than its own.

M&amp;S introduced self-checkout tills in the food halls of a small number of trial stores in 2002. Self-service checkouts were implemented in the general merchandise sections in three trial stores in 2006.

In 2019, M&amp;S launched five new Food renewal stores. This was part of the transformation of the Food business, led by Managing Director Stuart Machin, to have bigger Food stores with &quot;the mind of a supermarket and the soul of a fresh market&quot;.

===Home stores===
In 2007, M&amp;S announced that new, dedicated shops for home furnishings were to be launched. Shops have been opened in Cheltenham in Gloucestershire, Royal Tunbridge Wells in Kent, Lisburn Sprucefield in Northern Ireland, and in the Barton Square section of The Trafford Centre, Manchester.

===Outlet stores===
The outlet division offers M&amp;S products, with the majority of them discounted at least 30% from the original selling price. The first of these stores opened at Ashford in Kent in 2000, and by 2020 there were 25. Many of the outlet shops are in retail parks and outlet centres, although others are high street shops such as the one in Woolwich, South London.

===M&amp;S Foodhall (standalone)===
M&amp;S launched a convenience format, branded &quot;Simply Food&quot; in 2001, with the first stores opening in Twickenham and Surbiton. The stores predominantly sell food, although some larger stores also stock a small selection of general merchandise. A number of these are run under franchise agreements:
* SSP Group runs the stores at mainline railway stations and airports.
* Moto has stores at many of its motorway service areas.
* BP has petrol stations with &quot;Simply Food&quot; offerings.

Orders from M&amp;S accounted for more than half of Uniq&#x27;s food product supplies to UK retailers in 2010, after several years&#x27; service as a major M&amp;S food product supplier.

In 2011 it was noted that M&amp;S were operating express pricing; i.e., charging more in their Simply Food branches than in regular branches. A spokesperson stated that &quot;prices are a little higher than at our high street stores but this reflects the fact that these stores are open longer and are highly convenient for customers on the move&quot;.

The Simply Food brand was phased out in stand-alone larger stores after the rebrand in 2015 and the stores are now branded as &quot;M&amp;S Foodhall&quot;.

In March 2019, M&amp;S announced that they would open more supermarket-sized food halls, with a floor area of between , that would stock their full food range, in order to attract more families looking to do a weekly shop. M&amp;S also lowered the price of over 1000 of their popular lines to compete with their larger supermarket rivals such as Tesco and Sainsbury&#x27;s.

===Online services===
Online food deliveries began with trials in 2017. In 2019, M&amp;S paid up to £750 million (dependent on future performance) for 50% of online retailer Ocado Retail Ltd, displacing Waitrose as Ocado&#x27;s retail partner. Since 2020, customers are directed to Ocado&#x27;s website where they can order food and selected clothing items. In February 2024, it was reported that M&amp;S did not intend to pay the final £191 million instalment to Ocado, after performance targets were not met in 2023.

The online flower service was accused of unfair trading and using Google to piggy-back advertise on online searches aimed at Interflora online in 2010.

==Other services==
In addition to the main retail business, M&amp;S partners with other companies to provide additional M&amp;S-branded services: 
* M&amp;S Bank – financial services and credit products, operated by HSBC UK
* M&amp;S Energy – domestic gas and electricity supply, operated by Octopus Energy
* M&amp;S Opticians – operated by Owl Optical

==Product line history==
The &quot;St Michael&quot; brand was introduced by Simon Marks in 1928 in honour of his father and co-founder of Marks &amp; Spencer, Michael Marks. By 1950, virtually all goods were sold under the St Michael brand. M&amp;S lingerie, women&#x27;s clothing and girls&#x27; uniform had been branded as &quot;St Margaret&quot; until 1950, when the whole range of general merchandise became St Michael. The St Michael brand was retired in 2000 but returned to a limited extent as an emblem in 2021.

The synthetic fibre Tricell was first used in 1957 and lasted until the 1970s. Another synthetic fibre called Courtelle was first launched, nationally, by Marks &amp; Spencer during 1960 and lasted well into the 1970s. Machine washable wool first appeared in 1972, and Lycra hosiery first came in during 1986.

&quot;Per Una&quot; was launched on 28 September 2001 as a joint venture between M&amp;S and Next founder George Davies with the contribution of Julie Strang. The &quot;Per Una&quot; brand has been a major success for the company, and in October 2004, M&amp;S bought the brand in a £125 million, two-year service contract with Davies. He was to stay on for at least two years to run the company, with 12 months notice required if he wished to leave.

In 2004, Sir Stuart Rose axed a number of brands including the menswear brand &quot;SP Clothing&quot;, the &quot;View From&quot; sportswear range, the David Beckham children&#x27;s range &quot;DB07&quot; and several food lines, as he thought the company&#x27;s stock inventory management had become &#x27;too complicated&#x27;. A version of Per Una aimed at teenagers, &quot;Per Una Due&quot;, was also discontinued, despite having launched earlier in the year, owing to poor sales.

The company began to sell branded goods such as Kellogg&#x27;s corn flakes in November 2008. Following a review by Marc Bolland in 2011, M&amp;S confirmed it would begin to reduce the number of branded items on sale, instead offering only those that it did not have an M&amp;S alternative for.

In January 2021, Marks &amp; Spencer purchased the Jaeger fashion brand from its administrators. The £5 million deal was part of the firm&#x27;s strategy to boost its clothing division with new names. However, it did not include Jaeger&#x27;s 63 shops and 13 concessions.

==Marketing==
===Early 2000s===

During the height of the company&#x27;s troubles at the beginning of the 21st century, the &quot;St Michael&quot; brand used as the selling label for all M&amp;S products was discontinued in favour of &quot;Marks &amp; Spencer&quot; and a new logo in the Optima typeface was introduced and began to appear in place of &quot;St Michael&quot; on product packaging. The same logo was also applied to store fascias and carrier bags. The &quot;St Michael&quot; name was subsequently adopted as a &#x27;quality guarantee&#x27; and appeared as the &quot;St Michael Quality Promise&quot; on the back of food products, on the side of delivery vehicles and on in-store ordering receipts.

===Your M&amp;S===

When Steve Sharp joined as marketing director in 2004, after being hired by Stuart Rose, he introduced a new promotional brand under the &quot;Your M&amp;S&quot; banner, with a corresponding logo.

===High-profile media campaigns===
M&amp;S has run newspaper and/or magazine advertisements since the early 1950s, but the introduction of some famous stars including Twiggy and David Jason in television advertisements helped raise the company&#x27;s profile. Twiggy first appeared in 1967, returning later in 1995 and 2005. Anne Grierson featured in advertisements during the late 1950s and most of the 1960s. In later years, Erin O&#x27;Connor, Myleene Klass, David Beckham, Antonio Banderas, Claudia Schiffer, Helena Christensen, Tatjana Patitz, Lisa Snowdon, Dannii Minogue, V V Brown, and Carmen Kass have featured in advertisements. John Sergeant, David Jason and Joanna Lumley have either appeared in or voiced over advertisements since 2008.

Advertisements from the 2000s had the tag-line &quot;This is not just food, this is M&amp;S food&quot; and featured slow motion, close-up footage of various food products, described in a sultry voice-over by Dervla Kirwan, to an enticing instrumental song — including Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s &quot;Albatross&quot; as well as Santana&#x27;s &quot;Samba Pa Ti&quot;, Olly Murs&#x27; &quot;Busy&quot;, Groove Armada&#x27;s &quot;At the River&quot; or Spandau Ballet&#x27;s &quot;True&quot;. These advertisements were referred to by some sections of the media as &quot;food porn&quot;, with a number of other companies copying the idea, such as Aldi and, subsequently, Waitrose.

The 2009 TV advertising campaign drew complaints, leading to national press coverage, regarding sexism.

In 2010, it was confirmed that Dannii Minogue would be one of the new faces of Marks &amp; Spencer. She filmed her first commercial in South Africa, which featured Cheryl Lynn&#x27;s &quot;Got to Be Real&quot;, for their Spring campaign that aired on 24 March. In August 2011, M&amp;S announced the new faces of their campaigns would be Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Ryan Reynolds, and David Gandy.

Marks &amp; Spencer released a series of planned television adverts in July 2011, featuring Twiggy, Minogue and V V Brown, as it started its corporate image revamp. It confirmed that Twiggy, Lisa Snowdon, and Jamie Redknapp would return for future advertising.

On 31 March 2014, M&amp;S launched the new iteration of its &#x27;Leading Ladies&#x27; marketing campaign featuring Emma Thompson, Annie Lennox, Rita Ora and Doreen Lawrence.

In 2024, Alex Scott became the sportswear ambassador at M&amp;S.

===Digital marketing===
Marks &amp; Spencer announced its &quot;Technology Transformation Programme&quot; in 2018 focusing on business growth using digital marketing.

==Criticism and controversies ==
===Anti-Israel protests===
Marks &amp; Spencer has been repeatedly targeted and boycotted by anti-Israel protestors during the Arab League boycott of Israel. In 2014, it was reported that the Marble Arch branch was picketed weekly by protesters objecting to the sale of Israeli goods.

=== Animal welfare ===

Marks &amp; Spencer is a member of the RSPCA Assured food labelling scheme that claims &quot;any animals involved in a product&#x27;s production have been reared to the RSPCA&#x27;s strict farm animal welfare standards&quot;. The scheme has been subject to controversy due to animal abuse being captured by hidden cameras at farms, with the RSPCA president calling it &quot;utterly indefensible&quot;.

Instances of animal neglect and abuse have been reported in the Marks &amp; Spencer supply chain. In July 2022, secret cameras caught lame animals &quot;unable to get up to reach water&quot; as workers killed goats &quot;of no value&quot; at an intensive farm producing cheese and milk for M&amp;S. Animals were seen with overgrown hooves and piles of dead goats were observed outside the property.

In April 2024, &quot;The Guardian&quot; obtained footage of pigs from RSPCA Assured farms at a slaughterhouse being hit in the face by workers with a paddle before entering a gas chamber to die. The RSPCA reviewed the footage and said the hitting any animals was completely unacceptable and they would launch an immediate investigation. 

In May 2024, footage emerged from several intensive RSPCA Assured farms in the M&amp;S supply chain showing sick, dying and dead hens alongside living ones. M&amp;S suspended one of the farms.

In September 2024, &quot;The Independent&quot; released footage from an M&amp;S dairy RSPCA Assured farm which had previously featured in advertising. Workers were observed mistreating cows, striking them with poles and kicking them. In one incident, a worker was seen jabbing a cow with a screwdriver. The farm was suspended from the RSPCA Assured scheme once the footage emerged.

===Comprehensive Spending Review===

In October 2010, chairman Sir Stuart Rose was a signatory to a controversial letter to &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; which claimed that &quot;The private sector should be more than capable of generating additional jobs to replace those lost in the public sector, and the redeployment of people to more productive activities will improve economic performance, so generating more employment opportunities&quot;, despite recent job cuts of 1,000 staff.

===Contactless payment issues===
Some Marks &amp; Spencer customers claim that the chain&#x27;s contactless payment terminals have taken money from cards other than the ones intended for payment. Contactless cards are supposed to be within about 4 cm of the front of the terminal to work. M&amp;S investigated the incident and confirmed the new system had been extensively tested and was robust. It had recently rolled out the contactless payments system, provided by Visa Europe, to 644 UK stores.

===Muslim checkout-staff policy===
In December 2013, Marks &amp; Spencer announced that Muslim checkout staff in the UK could refuse to sell pork products or alcohol to customers at their till. The policy was announced after at least one news outlet reported that customers waiting with goods that included pork or alcohol were refused service, and were told by a Muslim checkout worker to wait until another till became available. The policy applied across all 703 UK M&amp;S stores and prompted a strong backlash by customers.

A company spokesman subsequently apologised and stated that they will attempt to reassign staff whose beliefs may impact their work to different departments, such as clothing.

===Hijab as school uniform===
Marks &amp; Spencer introduced a hijab in its section of school uniforms in late 2018 and subsequently faced a backlash and boycott from some customers; the product is stocked for girls as young as three.

===Holly Willoughby===
In September 2018, television presenter and model Holly Willoughby became the company&#x27;s new brand ambassador along with her &#x27;Must Have&#x27; collection which launched on 27 September 2018. However, the company failed to order sufficient stock and many customers were left disappointed.

<text>Antioch University is a private university with multiple campuses in the United States and online programs. It is the continuation of Antioch College, which was founded in 1852. Antioch College&#x27;s first president was politician, abolitionist, and education reformer Horace Mann. In 1977, the college network was re-incorporated as Antioch University to reflect its growth across the country into numerous graduate education programs. It operates five campuses located in four states, as well as an online division and the Graduate School of Leadership and Change. All campuses of the university are regionally accredited by the Higher Learning Commission. 

The university&#x27;s five campuses are located in Yellow Springs, Los Angeles, Santa Barbara, California, Keene, New Hampshire, and Seattle. Antioch University suspended operations of Antioch College in 2008 and later sold the campus and a license to use the name &quot;Antioch College&quot; in 2009. Since then, the college has had no affiliation with the university. 

Antioch University Midwest was also located in Yellow Springs, and remains part of the university, but it closed in 2020. However, university administration, Antioch University Online, and Antioch University’s Graduate School of Leadership &amp; Change remained headquartered at the Yellow Springs location.

==History==
===19th century===
Antioch College was incorporated in Ohio in 1852 and accredited by the Higher Learning Commission in 1927. In 1977, Antioch College changed its name to &quot;Antioch University&quot;, having extended its operations beyond the college and beyond Ohio, mostly in graduate level programs.

In the early 1850s, Rebecca Pennell offered a course on teaching methods which was the first of its kind, and John Burns Weston, class of 1857, established a long-standing precedent by being both student and faculty simultaneously. He taught Greek language and literature for 20 years and remained a lifelong student.

Antioch College president Arthur Morgan launched Antioch&#x27;s unique program of work and study, including student government and changing the nature of the admissions procedure, which he moved away from exams and towards more personal information on prospective students. Senior exams were graded &quot;honors&quot; or &quot;pass&quot;, and students who failed could retake the exam. Morgan remained at Antioch College until 1933, when he became director of the Tennessee Valley Authority.

Antioch College&#x27;s first president was Horace Mann, regarded by most historians as the father of public education in the United States. 

===20th century===
Antioch College began a period of rapid expansion in 1964 with the acquisition of the Putney School of Education in Vermont. The campus evolved and moved several times; now it is called Antioch University New England and is located in Keene, New Hampshire. 

By 1972, another 23 campuses and centers had been opened, and the college bylaws were revised to define Antioch as a network, not a college. Even as centers began to close, new centers continued to open; 38 centers would be opened by the end of 1979, including Antioch University School of Law in Washington, D.C. 

In 1977, the Antioch College board of trustees voted to change its corporate name to Antioch University. It continued to operate Antioch College as a division of the university along with the other campuses and centers. From 1978 to 1994, the president of the Antioch College campus also served as the chancellor of Antioch University. 

===21st century===
In 2007, the Antioch University board of trustees announced that they would suspend operations of Antioch College the following year and that they intended to re-open the college in four years. It was their belief that four years would give the university the necessary time to develop and execute a plan for rebuilding Antioch College in a manner that would both honor its legacy and secure its future.

There was considerable controversy among members of the Antioch College alumni group about the decision to suspend operations at the college. Subsequently, a group of Antioch College alumni, headed by the Antioch College Alumni Board, expressed interest in purchasing the college from the university and re-opening the college as an independent institution. The alumni group formed the Antioch College Continuation Corporation as the vehicle for negotiating and owning the college. After two years of negotiations, the parties agreed to terms of an asset purchase agreement which was signed at a closing ceremony on September 4, 2009. In the transaction, Antioch College Continuation Corporation purchased from the university the college campus in Yellow Springs, Ohio, along with an exclusive license to use the university&#x27;s registered trade name &quot;Antioch College&quot;. However, Antioch University continues to own the trade name and any other use of the word &quot;Antioch&quot; within higher education.

In 2008, due to financial exigency, Antioch University closed the Antioch College campus in Yellow Springs. In 2009, a number of Antioch College alumni formed a new Ohio corporation, Antioch College Continuation Corporation, which purchased from the university the college campus along with an exclusive license to use the university&#x27;s registered trade name &quot;Antioch College&quot;. The new independent Antioch College opened in 2011. Since then, Antioch University and Antioch College have operated as wholly separate, non-affiliated institutions.

In 2010, the college was sanctioned by the American Association of University Professors &quot;for infringement of governance standards&quot;.

From its inception, racial and gender equality, independent study, and independent thinking were integral parts of Antioch College. Six students were accepted for the first quarter: four men and two women who came to share the same college classrooms for the first time in the U.S. The notion of gender equality extended also to the faculty. Antioch College was the first U.S. college to designate a woman as full professor, and the original faculty included seven men and two women. In 1863, the college instituted the policy that no applicant was to be rejected on the basis of race.

==Campuses==
===Antioch University Los Angeles===
Antioch University Los Angeles, also known as AULA, was founded in 1972. The school is actually located in Culver City, California, having moved from prior locations at Fairfax Ave and Santa Monica in Los Angeles, on Rose Avenue in Venice, California, and on Fiji Way in Marina del Rey, California. AULA had 924 students as of 2020, with most students being post-baccalaureate and at least 40 percent of undergraduates being enrolled part-time.

===Antioch University Santa Barbara===
Antioch University Santa Barbara, also known as AUSB, had 276 students as of 2020, with most being post-baccalaureate and at least 40 percent of undergraduates being enrolled part-time. About 99% are under 25, and about 97% are in-state residents. 

===Antioch University Seattle===
Founded in 1975 and was located on 6th Avenue in Seattle, and later moved to now defunct 3rd Avenue in Downtown Seattle Antioch University Seattle had 735 students as of 2020, with most students being post-baccalaureate and at least 40 percent of undergraduates being enrolled part-time.

===Antioch University-New England===
Though founded as Antioch Putney Graduate School in 1964, Antioch University New England has been located at its present campus in Keene, New Hampshire, since 1994. There were 895 students enrolled as of 2020, and this campus is exclusively graduate. All 11 graduate programs are all on-campus only, with none being offered online. 32% of students are part time.

===Antioch University Online===
While called a separate &quot;campus&quot; by the university, the school is 100% online with no on-campus learning required. The online school has over 100 students, and offers both bachelors and masters level programs.

===Antioch University Graduate School of Leadership and Change===
Also considered a separate campus by the university, the Antioch University Graduate School of Leadership and Change (GSLC) was officially established in 2015, but has its roots in the university&#x27;s PhD in Leadership and Change offered since 2002. The school has approximately 168 active students.

===Antioch University Midwest ===

Antioch University Midwest (AUM) was located in Yellow Springs, Ohio. Antioch University Midwest was known as Antioch University McGregor and founded in 1988 as the School of Adult and Experiential Learning at Antioch College.

Yellow Springs was the home campus for many of the university&#x27;s low-residency programs, which attract students from across the country, including its PhD in Leadership and Change, its EdD in Education and Professional Practice, and its master&#x27;s degree in Clinical Mental Health Counseling. AUM&#x27;s functions were absorbed into AU Online, and its building put up for sale. However, university administration, AU Online and AU&#x27;s Graduate School of Leadership &amp; Change remained headquartered in Yellow Springs, leaving about 25 employees.

<text>Xalapa or Jalapa (, ), officially Xalapa-Enríquez (), is the capital city of the Mexican state of Veracruz and the name of the surrounding municipality. In the 2020 census the city reported a population of 443,063 and the municipality of which it serves as municipal seat reported a population of 488,531. The municipality has an area of 118.45 km2. Xalapa lies near the geographic center of the state and is the second-largest city in the state after the city of Veracruz to the southeast.

== Etymology ==

The name &quot;Xalapa&quot; comes from the Classical Nahuatl roots (, &#x27;sand&#x27;) and (, &#x27;place of water&#x27;), which means approximately &#x27;spring in the sand&#x27;. It&#x27;s classically pronounced in Nahuatl, although the final /n/ is often omitted. This was adopted into Spanish as &quot;Xalapa&quot;.

The complete name of the city is &quot;Xalapa-Enríquez&quot;, bestowed in honor of a governor from the 19th century, Juan de la Luz Enríquez. The city&#x27;s nickname, &quot;City of Flowers&quot; (), was given by Alexander von Humboldt, who visited the city 10 February 1804. The reference is also related to the city&#x27;s older colonial history. According to folklore, the Spanish believed that Jalapa was the birthplace and home of the world&#x27;s most beautiful woman, , which literally means &#x27;little flower&#x27;. The residents of Xalapa are called or , which is also the name given to the popular large peppers cultivated in this area.

==History==
The Totonacs first established themselves around Macuiltepetl (&quot;fifth mountain&quot; in Nahuatl). This extinct volcano received its name because the Aztecs used it as the fifth reference mountain to get to the gulf of Mexico&#x27;s shores. Today it is preserved in a park. During the 14th century, four indigenous peoples settled in the territory today known as Xalapa. Each built a small village: Xalitic (in the sand) was founded by the Totonacas; in the northeast Tecuanapan (river of the beasts) was founded by the Toltecas, and Tlalnecapan was founded by the Teochichimecas.

Around 1313, the four villages grew together and joined, forming one large village named Xallapan. Moctezuma Ilhuicamina, the fifth Aztec emperor, invaded the territory during the second half of the 15th century. All the land was ruled as part of the Aztec Empire before the arrival and conquest of the Spanish conquistadores.

In 1519 Hernán Cortés passed through en route to Tenochtitlan. In 1555 Spanish Franciscans completed construction of a convent, an important event in the Nueva España of that time.
When the Spanish invaded, Xalapa was barely populated. The population rose after the conquest and colonial settlement. When the Spanish improved the Mexico-Orizaba-Veracruz route, Xalapa declined in importance as a transport hub, and its population stagnated in the 17th century.

From 1720 on Xalapa became increasingly important, due to trade with merchants from New Spain arriving to buy and sell the products of the peninsula. Numerous Spanish families from the nearby towns settled in Xalapa, so by 1760 the population had increased to over 1,000 inhabitants, including mestizo and Spanish. Among local items of commerce were botanical medicines particularly ipomoea purga source of a drug known in English as Jalap. The growth of Xalapa in population, culture, commerce and importance, increased dramatically in the 18th century. Responding to residents&#x27; requests, Carlos IV of Spain declared Xalapa a town on 18 December 1791.

In 1772, construction of Xalapa Cathedral began. On 18 May 1784, José María Alfaro got the first air balloon in the Americas, airborne, in Xalapa. Due to the abundance of flowers growing in the region, Alexander von Humboldt, who visited the town on 10 February 1804, christened it the &quot;city of the flowers&quot;.

On 29 November 1830 by decree, Xalapa was named a city. In 1843, Don Antonio María de Rivera founded the Normal School of Xalapa to train teachers. Today it operates as a preparatory school for students going to college.

In 1847, during the Mexican–American War, Mexican general Antonio López de Santa Anna attempted to defeat the opposing forces near Xalapa in the Battle of Cerro Gordo. He led an army of more than 12,000 soldiers. Mexican troops suffered many casualties; around a thousand were killed and three thousand wounded on 18 April 1847. The US invaders occupied the city the following day. Among them was Lt. Ulysses S. Grant, later the commanding general of the Union armies in the American Civil War. Grant&#x27;s letters call Jalapa &quot;decidedly the most beautiful place I ever saw in my life&quot; and its climate &quot;the best in the world.&quot;
Xalapeños such as Ambrosio Alcalde and Antonio García fought hard to defend the city of Veracruz, but were taken prisoner. They were released and paroled, but after rejoining the fighting against the US, they were recaptured near Teocelo, taken to Xalapa, sentenced to death and executed on 24 November 1847. Today these two men are remembered as martyrs. An obelisk commemorates their sacrifice, between San Jose Church and Alcalde Market, named for Ambrosio Alcalde. US forces marched on to capture Mexico City and departed after the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.

In November 1862 Xalapa was attacked in the French invasion; foreigners temporarily took control of the state capital. On 27 November 1867 the corpse of emperor Maximilian I of Mexico, who had been executed in Querétaro, arrived and was held in San José, attended by the priest José María y Daza, then transferred to Veracruz the following day. The remains were shipped back to Austria for burial.
In 1885 General Juan de la Luz Enríquez increased the influence of Xalapa when he moved some legislative authority from Orizaba to Xalapa, in accordance with a decree issued in June 1884 by provisional Governor Juan Manuel Fernández de Jáuregui. Enríquez and Swiss teacher Enrique C. Rébsamen in 1886 founded the Normal School in Xalapa, the first school of this type in the country. Enríquez died in 1892, but the construction of the Normal School and founding of its other schools led to Xalapa becoming known as a center of learning, the &quot;Athens of Veracruz&quot;.

On 18 May 1911, Francisco I. Madero visited Xalapa. On 21 June of the same year a minor conflict occurred between federal forces and revolutionaries.

<doc id="154568" wikidata="Q355952" url="?curid=154568" title="Billy Backus">
<text>Billy Backus, (born March 5, 1943) is an American former World Welterweight Champion professional boxer. In the summer of 2006 Backus retired from his correctional facility job and moved to South Carolina.

== Early boxing career ==

Backus, who is the nephew of boxing legend and former world champion Carmen Basilio, started his career by winning only 7 of his first 19 bouts. In 1964, things looked promising when he won four bouts in a row, but then he suffered a three fight losing streak. At this point of his career, he had a record of 8 wins, 7 losses and 3 draws and he retired from boxing. To make things worse, he had lost his last fight, against Rudy Richardson, on his twenty-second birthday.

== Rise to prominence ==

Backus resumed his boxing career in 1966, but probably never in his wildest dreams could he have envisioned what happened next: in his comeback bout, he knocked out Tod Purtell in the first round, and that marked his embarcation on a seven-fight winning streak that included avenging an earlier loss to Dick French. That streak was broken by a defeat at the hands of Percy Pugh in New Orleans, but soon he started on another winning streak, eight in a row, including two over Pugh. Then, Pugh broke his winning streak once again, beating him in 15 rounds, once again at New Orleans. After splitting two fights with Jerry Pellegrini and drawing in four rounds with Ricky Ortiz, Backus embarked on another winning streak, including an eight-round knockout over Ortiz in a rematch.

== World Welterweight Title Bout ==

After that last streak, Backus was ranked among the top ten Welterweight challengers of the world at number 10. The year was 1970 and Mexico&#x27;s José Nápoles had earned the right to make an optional defense of his world title (meaning he could pick any challenger among the top ten to defend against). His management, figuring they&#x27;d have an easy fight ahead of them, picked Backus as the challenger for this optional title bout. But Backus landed a punch that opened a cut over Nápoles&#x27; eye in round one, causing Nápoles to bleed profusely, and the fight was stopped in round four. Since the cut had been ruled to be caused by a punch, Backus was declared winner by a technical knockout, and he had realized a dream that many fans never thought he would: he had become the world&#x27;s Welterweight champion. His uncle Basilio, watching from ringside, said: &quot;Billy winning the world title is the best thing ever to happen in my life, even better than me winning the world title.&quot;

Billy won two non-title fights, including one over Robert Gallois in Paris, and then had a rematch with Nápoles in Los Angeles. This time Nápoles returned the favor, knocking Backus out in the eighth round and regaining his title.

== Career decline ==

He finished 1971 with a ten-round decision win over Jose Gabino, and went 3–2 in 1972, losing two fifteen-round decisions to world title challenger Hedgemon Lewis. He lost 3 of 4 bouts in 1973, and went on a European tour in 1974, winning 2 and losing 2 in Paris and Berlin. In 1975, he went to Australia and lost by a knockout in five to Rocky Mattioli, and then he came back to the States, where he beat Marc Gervais by a knockout in ten. This marked the start of another 9 fight winning streak, which led the WBA to make him their number one challenger. After drawing in twelve rounds with Everaldo Acosta Acevedo, he had a chance at regaining the world welterweight title when faced against world champion Pipino Cuevas of Mexico, once again in Los Angeles. After losing by quitting on his stool in the first round, Backus then announced his retirement from boxing for good.

Although he isn&#x27;t a member of the International Boxing Hall of Fame (unlike his uncle Basilio, who is), in 1990, Ed Brophy and some Canastota businessmen came up with the idea to build the hall of fame in Canastota, to honor Canastota&#x27;s two native world champions: Basilio and Backus.

In 2010, the award nominated &quot;Title Town USA, Boxing in Upstate New York&quot; by noted historian Mark Allen Baker was published by The History Press in 2010 and supports Canastota, New York as the epicenter of Upstate New York&#x27;s rich boxing heritage. The book includes chapters on both Carmen Basilio and Billy Backus. The introduction was written by Edward P. Brophy, Executive Director of the International Boxing Hall of Fame .

Backus had a final record of 48 wins, 20 losses and 5 draws, with 22 wins by knockout.

<doc id="154576" wikidata="Q830457" url="?curid=154576" title="Cloud cover">
<text>Cloud cover (also known as cloudiness, cloudage, or cloud amount) refers to the fraction of the sky obscured by clouds on average when observed from a particular location. Okta is the usual unit for measurement of the cloud cover. The cloud cover is correlated to the sunshine duration as the least cloudy locales are the sunniest ones while the cloudiest areas are the least sunny places, as clouds can block sunlight, especially at sunrise and sunset where sunlight is already limited.


The global cloud cover averages around 67-68%, though it ranges from 56% to 73% depending on the minimum optical depth considered (lower when optical depth is large, and higher when it is low, such that subvisible cirrus clouds are counted). Average cloud cover is around 72% over the oceans, with low seasonal variation, and about 55% above land, with significant seasonal variation.

== Role in the climate system ==

Clouds play multiple critical roles in the climate system and diurnal cycle. In particular, being bright objects in the visible part of the solar spectrum, they efficiently reflect light to space and thus contribute to the cooling of the planet, as well as trapping remaining heat at night. Cloud cover thus plays an important role in the energetic balance of the atmosphere and a variation of it is a factor and consequence of and to the climate change expected by recent studies.

== Variability ==
Cloud cover values only vary by 3% from year-to-year averages, whereas the local, day-to-day variability in cloud amounts typically rises to 30% over the globe. Land is generally covered by 10-15% less cloud than the oceans, because the seas are covered with water, allowing for more evaporation.

Lastly, there is a latitudinal variation in the cloud cover. Areas around 10-15% below the global mean can be found around 20°N and 20°S, due to an absence of equatorial effects and strong winds reducing cloud formation. On the other hand, in the storm regions of the Southern Hemisphere midlatitudes were found to have with 15–25% more cloudiness than the global mean at 60°S. On average, about 67% of the entire Earth is cloud-covered at any moment.

On a continental scale, it can be noticed based upon a long-term satellite recording of cloudiness data that on a year-mean basis, Europe, North America, South America and Asia are dominated by cloudy skies due to the westerlies, monsoon or other effects. On the other hand, Africa, the Middle East and Australia are dominated by clear skies due to their continentality and aridity.

On a regional scale, some exceptionally humid areas of Earth experience cloudy conditions virtually all time such as South America&#x27;s Amazon Rainforest while some highly arid areas experience clear-sky conditions virtually all the time such as Africa&#x27;s Sahara Desert.

== Altitude of typical cloud cover ==

Although clouds can exist within a wide range of altitudes, typical cloud cover has a base at approximately 4,000m and extends up to an altitude of about 5,000m. Clouds height can vary depending on latitude; with cloud cover in polar latitudes being slightly lower and in tropical regions the cloud cover may extend up to 8,000m. The type of cloud is also a factor, with low cumulus clouds sitting at 300–1,500m while high cirrus clouds at 5,500-6,500m.

<text>The Olympia (; commonly known as L&#x27;Olympia or in the English-speaking world as Olympia Hall) is a concert venue in the 9th arrondissement of Paris, France, located at 28 Boulevard des Capucines, equally distancing Madeleine church and Opéra Garnier, north of Vendôme square. Its closest métro/RER stations are , , , and .

The hall was opened in 1893 by one of the two co-creators of the Moulin Rouge venue, and saw many opera, ballet, and music hall performances. Theatrical performances declined in the late 1920s and the Olympia was converted into a cinema, before re-opening as a venue in 1954 with Bruno Coquatrix as executive director. Since the 1960s, it has been a popular venue for rock bands.

The Olympia was threatened with demolition in the early 1990s, but saved by a preservation order. Inevitably included in a group of buildings that were part of an extensive renovation project, the entire edifice was demolished and rebuilt in 1997. The venue&#x27;s facade and its interior were preserved. Vivendi acquired the Olympia in 2001 and it remains a popular venue. The venue is easily recognized by the giant white-on-red glowing letters announcing its name.

==History==
===Origins===
In 1880, the entrepreneur Joseph Oller purchased grounds and converted them into a horse racing venue. In 1882, he created innovative mechanisms to interact the exit of the horses with the distribution of tickets.

In 1888, with the money earned from these investments, he imported a wooden roller coaster from England. In the same year, Oller collaborated with Charles Zidler to build the roller coaster in the courtyard on 28 Boulevard des Capucines in the 9th arrondissement of Paris, near the Opéra Garnier, at the time of Baron Haussmann&#x27;s urban renovation. Named the &quot;Montagnes Russes&quot;, it would be considered one of the first wider amusement parks in history. In 1889, Oller and Zidler co-founded the Moulin Rouge in Pigalle.

In 1892, the Prefect of Police feared a conflagration and ordered the &quot;Montagnes Russes&quot;″ closure and ban. It was then demolished. In that year, supervised by architect Léon Carle, a steel building foundation was constructed and erected in the same place. The interior fittings were conceived by decorators and painters Charles Toché, Marcel Jambon, and Etienne Cornellier. It contained panels in Sarreguemines&#x27; faience, and the murals highlighted painting technique marouflage, illustrating English castles and landscapes, echoing the dominant popular style. The Baccarat crystal glass company created the girandoles and chandeliers, while the electrical installation work was carried out by the company &quot;Eclairage Electrique&quot;. Oller&#x27;s primary intention was to propose a defining location of luxury and glamor in Paris.

===Opening and early years===
On 12 April 1893, the 2,000 capacity venue named L&#x27;Olympia was inaugurated as the first Parisian music hall, featuring acrobats, cross-dressers, and a can-can dance performance of La Goulue. The Olympia&#x27;s gala opening reception drew Paris&#x27; wealthiest, the aristocratic, and powerful people. Admission was restricted to a chosen few, the prince–princess, baron–baroness, and count. It also featured the Duke of Morny and figures from the sporting-club, Le Mirliton cabaret, and the jockey-club of the &quot;rue Royale&quot;.

In a city that only had &quot;cafés-concerts&quot;, the Olympia with its spacious hall attracted all Parisians enjoying ventriloquists, juggler acts, and numerous ballets and revues. The music hall staged operettas and also pantomimes. Loie Fuller, La Goulue, Leopoldo Fregoli, Dranem, Ouvrard, and Mistinguett were regularly billed at the venue. The Olympia was a &quot;first-class theater&quot;, although it retained the colloquial atmosphere of the &quot;cafés-concerts&quot; in its large surface area divided into two themes, concert, and theater. To differentiate itself from the Folies Bergère, the Olympia imposed itself a different scheduling system by presenting its new ballet creations over a duration of weeks rather than months, alternating with the oldest ones revamped. The &quot;ballet blanc&quot; was the first Olympia&#x27;s ballet. The venue demonstrated the dominance of the striptease pantomime &quot;Le Coucher de la Mariée&quot;, which became the &quot;longest-running and most profitable show in the 1890s&quot;. Along with the Folies Bergère, the Olympia scheduled appearances by some &quot;stars&quot; such as La Belle Otero, Émilienne d&#x27;Alençon, and Liane de Pougy.

In 1895, Oller, overflowing with activities, opened a museum of wax&#x27;s mannequins in the basements of the Olympia, representing a visual history of the world from the Passion of Christ to the French Revolution, until the modernity of that time.

However, in 1896, Oller found no more challenge in his multiple projects, and boredom took over. He named chief conductor Oscar de Lagoanaire as director of the music hall, which became a business failure. That same year, the screenings of the first films of the Lumière brothers were scheduled, which were new technologies at that time.

===Development===

In 1898, brothers Émile and Vincent Isola, two magicians who began a career as Paris&#x27; venue executive directors, became the commercial tenants of the Olympia, as well as of the most popular theaters in the city, such as the Folies Bergère in 1901 and the Gaîté-Lyrique in 1903. The Isola brothers brought attractions from all over the world to Olympia, playing host to multiple entertainment types, and increased the proportion and the spectacular. There were extravagant circus-themed parties with clowns, Contortionists, and the inclusion of exotic singing and dancing. The venue also featured acrobatic performances and wild animals such as seals, monkeys, elephants, and zebras. Furthermore, the French author Colette mimed entirely naked.

Ballets, pantomimes, and operettas became more prominent with larger productions, which led to the Olympia becoming a direct rival to the Opéra Garnier, notably with ballets as Charles Lecocq&#x27;s &quot;Barbe-bleue&quot; and Henri Hirschmann&#x27;s Néron in 1898, and Paul Vidal&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Impératrice&quot; in 1901. Despite the success of the ballets attested by &quot;La Belle Aux Cheveux d&#x27;Or&quot; and Sardanapale, the preferences of Émile and Vincent Isola settled firmly towards operettas, especially revues. Of the few ballets appearances, a limited number of restaged productions from Louis Ganne ensued at the Olympia, such as &quot;Au Japon&quot; in 1903, performed for the first time at London&#x27;s Alhambra. &quot;Phryné&quot; was restaged in 1904, initially performed at the Folies Bergère and at Royan&#x27;s Casino. The revues at the Olympia were choreographed by prominent figures, as Alfredo Curti, exemplified by &quot;Olympia Revue&quot; in 1903 and &quot;Au Music-Hall&quot; in 1905.

In 1905, Paul Ruez was appointed manager for the venue. Two ballet productions, &quot;Les Saisons de la Parisienne&quot; and &quot;Vers Les Etoiles&quot; were created in 1905 and 1906 respectively. Although spectacular, it had only lesser pantomime-ballet influences and received mixed reviews.

In 1908, Victor de Cottens and H. B. Marinelli took over as the directors of the music hall. In 1908, &quot;Trianon Ballet&quot;, and in 1909, &quot;Les Aventures de Mlle Clo-Clo&quot;, were ballets about flirting.
Choreographed by Curti, &quot;Paquita&quot;, and &quot;L&#x27;Enlèvement de Psyché&quot; debuted on the London stage in 1909 and 1910, respectively, while &quot;Papillon d&#x27;Or&quot; was first performed at the Empire Theater with music composed by Leopold Wenzel. In 1911, Cottens and H. B. Marinelli left their responsibilities which concluded fourteen ballets staged since the arrival of Ruez. That year, &quot;Nitokris&quot; was the last pantomime-ballet staged at the Olympia .
In 1911, Jacques Charles was trained by both brothers and worked his way up through the Olympia, and became the new executive director, then transformed it into a temple of the revue, entering the &quot;most luxurious period of the place&quot;. From 1911 to 1913, three revues included choreographic segments by Léo Staats, which featured dance performances of Natalia Trouhanowa and Stacia Napierkowska. By 1912, the Olympia presented a number of American music hall performers, and also French singers such as Lucienne Boyer, Mistinguett, Damia, Fréhel, Georgius, and Yvonne Printemps. In 1913, a ballet was staged at the Olympia, called &quot;Les Franfreluches de L&#x27;Amour&quot;. Léon Volterra was initially an employee at a car dealership and then joined Charles to began as a programs seller. Volterra negotiated to take charge of the program&#x27;s sales of Olympia&#x27;s first dance hall called &quot;Le Palais de la Danse&quot;, becoming increasingly wealthier.

The Olympia closed its doors for a short period at the beginning of the First World War, while Oller, still the commercial property landlord, struggled financially due to late rent payments and non-payments. Volterra partnered with Olympia chief conductor Raphael Beretta to manage stage shows, giving money to Oller, who &quot;expressly agreed-upon&quot; and Charles&#x27; tenant agency, then reopened the music hall one month after the First Battle of the Marne. By then, the revue became the preferred theatrical production choice, and ballet waned in popularity. In 1914, Charles left the Olympia and went to war; he was then wounded on the front lines of the First Battle of Champagne.

In 1915, Volterra and Beretta purchased the Olympia with their financial gains, highlighting &quot;chansons&quot; with performers such as Boyer, Damia, and Fréhel. The following year, both bought the Casino de Paris and the Folies Bergère. As the bombs dropped from the Zeppelins intensified overnight, Paris shut down its activities, including the Olympia. In 1917, Volterra was fired, leaving the Olympia with a generated personal profit of 1&quot;million de francs&quot;.

In 1918, at the end of the war, comedian Paul Franck had been entrusted with the business operation of the music hall and was appointed executive director. In 1922, Olympia&#x27;s founder Oller died a rich man. Franck revealed new talents, such as Marie Dubas, and brought back on stage artists from the early century that people wished to see again. In 1928, Franck left the music hall, which marked the end of the &quot;golden era&quot;.

===Movie theater===
By 1929, the music hall had turned into a stagnant concept, while sound film began its ascent in France. Then came the consequences of the global economic and financial crisis of the Great Depression, which forced Olympia into bankruptcy.

Born in Tunisia, Jacques Haïk was the Importer and distributor of Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s films in France and the inventor of his nickname, &quot;Charlot&quot;, in the country. While the crisis steadily deepened in France, Haïk purchased the Olympia and completely transformed the place into a movie theater (cinema).

On 11 April 1930, the venue reopened to the public, under the name &quot;Olympia–&quot;Théâtre&quot; Jacques Haïk&quot;, followed by a screening of Clarence Brown&#x27;s silent film, &quot;The Trail of &#x27;98&quot;. The theater explored the French cinema of the 1930s, celebrating filmmakers such as Jean Renoir, Maurice Tourneur, and Henry Wulschleger. However, the French Courvoisier bank went bankrupt due to the financial crisis. In 1931, Haïk lost all of his real estate companies but returned to film production, built several theaters starting in 1934, and regained a healthy financial situation over the years. On 6 December 1935, the Olympia &quot;Théâtre&quot; Jacques Haïk was selected by the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer during The Great MGM Season—to the detriment of the theater Madeleine—to broadcast a substantial number of film series ending after France&#x27;s release of Robert Z. Leonard&#x27;s &quot;The Great Ziegfeld&quot; in September 1936. Then, MGM moved to &quot;Le Paris&quot; movie theater on the Champs-Élysées avenue.

Subsequently, the responsibility for the business operation of the Olympia, in its configuration of a movie theater, moved away into a new commercial film company called Gaumont Franco-Film Aubert, then later Pathé, and was finally acquired by entrepreneur Léon Siritzky.

On 9 February 1938, the restyled Olympia movie theater was inaugurated in a gala event with an exclusive screening of &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; by Renoir.

====Nazi spoliation====
In the summer of 1940, the Nazis invaded French towns, villages, and Paris, followed by the plundering of cultural heritage, especially the French of Jewish faith. Being Jewish, Haïk left Paris for North Africa while the Nazis confiscated his property, films and took control of his company &quot;Les Films Régent&quot; that he had created in 1934. In mid-October 1940, four hundred and seventeen movie theaters were open in Paris, while the seven hundred and thirty-six closed were included in the Aryanization process, along with those of Siritzky. Siritzky, who also controlled the business operations of movie theaters such as the Marivaux, Max Linder César, and Moulin Rouge, received an invitation to tender from &quot;Société des cinémas de l&#x27;Est&quot; (SOGEC), led by German film producer and Continental Films executive director, Alfred Greven. The &quot;Société des cinémas de l&#x27;Est&quot; acquired the totality of Siritzky&#x27;s business, including the Olympia. Sorbonne&#x27;s professor Andre Kaspi wrote that Siritzky left France for the United States after the transaction, from which he pocketed 18&quot;millions de francs&quot;. The Olympia movie theater continued its activity during the occupation of France and broadcast German films by Tobis, Continental Films, as well as French production films by Henri Decoin, Robert Vernay, and Christian-Jaque. The venue also provided shelter for German soldiers.

====Military requisition====
In mid-August 1944, at the Liberation of Paris, the American troops requisitioned the Olympia for two years.

In 1945, at the end of the war, Haïk returned to Paris and battled to recuperate his companies, films, and movie theaters still spoliated by Germany.

====Restitution====
In January 1946, the Olympia was restituted to him after a judgment by the &quot;tribunal de commerce&quot; (commercial courts).

On 24 July 1946, it was reopened for public screenings with the Archie Mayo film &quot;Crash Dive&quot;. Throughout the years, the theater hosted a series of films by Alfred Hitchcock and films from French producers such as Julien Duvivier and Claude Autant-Lara. By 1949, however, Olympia&#x27;s occupancy rates marked a steady decline, due to the rivalry between Paris&#x27; movie theaters and the declining importance of films, despite the success of a few blockbusters, and even under the supervision of the executive administrator Pierre Vercel. Haïk died in 1950.

At that time, Bruno Coquatrix was executive director at Comédie-Caumartin and endured artistic and commercial failures there. He was the impresario of Édith Piaf in the 1940s and was also a songwriter, conductor, and jazz saxophonist. He was also known to be the agent of Léo Marjane and Lucienne Boyer.

In 1952, Coquatrix signed a commercial lease agreement with Jeanne Haïk, owner of the Olympia and director of her late husband&#x27;s businesses. The Olympia was in a &quot;pitiful state&quot; when Coquatrix took over as a manager and executive director. Nevertheless, he continued using it as a cinema and created operettas there in 1953. However, the downward trend of attendance signaled an impending bankruptcy.

===Rebirth of the music hall===

On 5 February 1954, Coquatrix revived it as a 2,000-seat music hall with a grand re-opening organized by Lucienne Delyle and Aimé Barelli, who presented that evening a singer unknown at the time, Gilbert Bécaud, who sang three songs. During the summer of 1954, Coquatrix convinced Jean-Michel Boris, aged twenty-one, to join his new team as a machinist and electrician.

In 1955, renowned jazz musicians as Billie Holiday, Sidney Bechet, Louis Armstrong, and Ella Fitzgerald were received every Wednesday and Saturday at the Olympia. Bécaud returned at the Olympia, where he caused the first scenes of &quot;collective hysteria&quot;. By then, the music hall mixed musical genres where tradition and innovation converged. A single music hall show encompassed, attractions, beginner singers, confirmed singers, and highest-ranked entertainers. Coquatrix partnered with Lucien Morisse and Eddie Barclay to hold regular auditions in the original billiard room (emptied of its billiard tables), scrolling through fifteen to fifty unknown artists whose careers &quot;were played out in thirty seconds&quot;.

In 1959, Boris was appointed artistic director of the Olympia.

In 1961, the Olympia was close to filing for bankruptcy, but Piaf came to help Coquatrix with the assistance of actor Jacques Tati. The music hall was saved by the performance of Piaf heading the bill for three months in a row—including some offered for free to Coquatrix—accompanied with live shows by Tati provided at the entrance of the venue and on stage.

In 1972, Alan Stivell popularized the style of Celtic music in France by playing at the Olympia, paving the way for Glenmor, Dan Ar Braz, and Tri Yann. The venue also initiated the first steps of Francis Cabrel, Alain Souchon, Paul Anka, and Louis Chedid.

On 1 April 1979, Coquatrix died, and consequently &quot;Olympia–Bruno Coquatrix&quot; became a registered trademark, although he was never the owner of the venue. Following his death, Paulette Coquatrix, and Patricia, their daughter, began to control at equal shares the business operations of the Olympia. That same year, Boris was named executive director of the Olympia.

By 1990, &quot;Société Générale&quot; took ownership of the building of the Olympia. Subsequently, it went into another slow decline and was in danger of being torn down and turned into a parking lot. Another project was also mentioned to rebuild a scaled-down version of the Olympia after demolition, but Boris, who was at the head of a support committee, went to negotiate with the &quot;Société Générale&quot;″s CEO. In 1991, France&#x27;s then culture minister, Jack Lang, issued a preservation order for the Olympia to interrupt the pre-established plan of the &quot;Société Générale&quot;. After that, politician Jacques Toubon had objected to the procedure, which canceled Olympia&#x27;s protection. A contestation and continued support from French artists and Lang ensued to maintain the building&#x27;s historic integrity, which led to Olympia&#x27;s sustainability through a preservation order established on 7 January 1993.

===Demolition and reconstruction===
In 1995, as part of the real estate project initiated in 1993, which required 1&quot;milliard&quot; of new francs of investment, the Edouard-VII area in the 9th arrondissement, where the Olympia was located, began to undergo &quot;a radical&quot; demolition and reconstruction.

On 14 April 1997, a gala evening was broadcast live on television with reputed French singers, in honor of the Olympia and support of the following months of closure. In Spring 1997, the demolition of the Olympia began. The architecture firms Anthony-Emmanuel Bechu, and Fernando Urquijo–Gino Valle–Giorgio Macola were appointed to manage the reconstruction project. It was rebuilt identically in seven months, keeping its original facade and the grandeur of its famous red interior, as well as the bar and the mosaics. The Olympia was relocated eight meters beneath its previous location. Nevertheless, the entrance to the venue remained in the same place, leading to the hall, which has retained its same seating capacity. The venue&#x27;s original acoustic was studied and preserved, as its aesthetics including its midnight blue ceiling and black walls. The cost of demolition, reconstruction and renovation of the Olympia was 100 &quot;millions&quot; of new francs.

On 30 April 1999, the real estate subsidiary of the &quot;Société Générale&quot; at the origin of the project, delivered the large commercial properties (including the Théâtre Édouard VII) to its buyer, the &quot;Société Foncière Lyonnaise&quot;, a subsidiary of Commercial Union, for an amount of 2,15&quot;milliards&quot; of new francs. As a result, the &quot;Société Foncière Lyonnaise&quot; became the owner of the Olympia&#x27;s building. The vast real estate transaction &quot;almost signed the death warrant of the Olympia&quot;.

On 17 July 2001, Boris retired as artistic director of the music hall.

In August 2001, Paulette and Patrica Coquatrix sold the brand &quot;Olympia&quot; to Vivendi&#x27;s chief executive Jean-Marie Messier. With the tensions tearing the heirs apart, Messier also bought the &quot;fonds de commerce&quot; (goodwill and stock in trade and intangible assets) from its owner, the &quot;Société Générale&quot;, as well as the percentage from Paulette Coquatrix and her daughter (both were &quot;fonds de commerce&quot;″s tenants). Messier was the sole initiator of the &quot;astronomical amount&quot; of money that transited, which sparked an investigation by the Fisc. At this point, the &quot;Société Foncière Lyonnaise&quot; retained ownership of the building, but negotiations continued during August, as Vivendi attempted to acquire it. By October 2001, the buyout was completed. Vivendi Universal Entertainment bought the building, corresponding to the remaining twenty percent. Since then, the business unit Vivendi Village has been the sole owner and supervise the commercial operations of the Olympia.

In 2002, Arnaud Delbarre was named as executive director of the Olympia by Universal Music France&#x27;s &quot;Président-directeur général&quot;, Pascal Nègre.

In 2008, the Olympia was cited as &quot;one of the world&#x27;s four or five most modern performance halls.&quot;

In late June 2015, Delbarre, aged fifty-seven years, resigned from office, concluding with an activity of three hundred shows per year at the Olympia, comparatively to two hundred when he arrived in 2002. By 2015, the venue, which was considered profitable, drew 700,000 attendees per year.

In 2016, Simon Gillham, chairman of Vivendi Village, became president of the Olympia. On 30 November 2016, Olympia was used for movie projection again, with the premiere of the biopic &quot;Dalida&quot;. The screening was significant in France and was broadcast live in 220 other venues from the country and Belgium.

==Renovations==
===1930===
Haïk engaged three architects for a significant renovation and remodeling of the music hall into a movie theater. Paul Farge was responsible for coordinating and monitoring works, while Gabriel Morice supervised the work of the structural system within the building. In coordination with Farge, Jean-Paul Mongeaud was responsible for designing and constructing the new neon lights facade displayed twelve meters high and eight meters wide. The neon tubes whose curves were drawn by Mongeaud were elaborated and created by engineer Fonsèque from Paz and Silva company. The two neon side panels, integrating over the facade&#x27;s entire height, were also created by Paz and Silva. The facade, illuminated in red, blue, and green encompassing four hundred meters of neon tubes, was the most significant illuminated sign in Europe and a reference for that time. A blacksmith artisan created the ornamental steel structure of the facade. Pelegry and Lavignac, responsible for the interior decorations of the Plaza Athénée and Théâtre des Folies-Wagram, designed the ceilings and wall decorations in accordance with Farge. The theater featured quality acoustic, indirect lighting, and Gallay brand velvet armchairs mingling dark green and light green. A Cavaillé-Coll organ was placed there. The Olympia–Théâtre Jacques Haïk was equipped with a modern sound installation for that time, which Western Electric installed, and the air conditioning was assigned to Willis Carrier.

===1938===
Siritzky undertook a renovation to highlight the facade of the Olympia as a movie theater. Architects Fernand Colin, Ruillier, and Vladimir Scob, decided to demolish the facade from the ground floor level to the second floor on a height of twelve meters, then fitted the roof with a massive steel fairing inspired by the bow of a ship and the exterior entrance was redesigned. The facade was adorned with one thousand five hundred meters of neon lights and fifteen thousand lamps using two thousand amperes. The theater was described as &quot;sumptuous&quot; with &quot;modern-harmonious lines&quot; benefiting from intense electric lighting.

===1954===
Coquatrix had decided to have the exterior facade of the venue redone, thus making it possible to announce the names of the artists in capital letters updated every day below the signage of the Olympia. The lettering &quot;Olympia&quot; and the artists&#x27; names illuminated in red neon lighting, were designed according to the taste of Coquatrix. The octagon shape of the &quot;O&quot; was inspired by the aerial view of the Paris&#x27; ring road.

===1956===
The interior layout was envisioned by Henri Rigal, also responsible for the decoration of Le Lido. Then later, only the armchairs have been regularly replaced throughout the years.

===2019===
In 2019, the Olympia opened to the public the authentic original billiard room, which served as an audition area under the direction of Coquatrix. Classified as &quot;Monument historique&quot;, the billiard room in Teal blue of 130 m2 (1399 ft2) has been preserved and renovated, keeping its ceramics and mural panels depicting British landscapes such as Falls of Clyde, Warwick Castle, Tower of London, adorned with carved woodwork. In the early years of the Olympia, the billiard room was one of Edward VII&#x27;s preferred places in Paris.

==Notable performances==

In 1900, the quick-change artist Fregoli would have remained at the top of the bill for seven months.

Édith Piaf achieved great acclaim at the Olympia giving several series of recitals from January 1955 until October 1962. At the end of her life and in poor health, Piaf made two performances per evening for three months.

Dalida was the most commercially successful solo performer at the Olympia. Her first performance in the hall was in early 1956 at auditions held by Eddie Barclay and Bruno Coquatrix. It was then when she was discovered and chosen to sign a contract. Later that year she supported Charles Aznavour for his concert. Her own first concert there was in 1959. After that she would perform in Olympia every three to four years, singing for 30 nights in row, completely sold-out in 1961, 1964, 1967, 1971, 1974, 1977, 1981. Her last Olympia appearance was in 1981, and in 1983 the hall went bankrupt. Releasing &quot;Olympia 67&quot; after her 1967 Olympia concert, she started releasing albums named for Olympia concerts, a style followed by other singers. She continued doing that until her last concert in Olympia, &quot;Olympia 81&quot;. &quot;Olympia 71&quot;, &quot;Olympia 74&quot;, and &quot;Olympia 77&quot; are live albums.

Jacques Brel&#x27;s &quot;1961&quot; and &quot;1964&quot; concerts at L&#x27;Olympia are legendary and preserved to this day on new CD releases. In October 1966, Brel gave a series of farewell concerts from the Olympia stage. A 1962 Marlene Dietrich concert was also broadcast from the Olympia.

Before going to America, the Beatles performed eighteen days (16 January – 4 February 1964) of concerts at the Olympia Theatre, playing two and sometimes three shows a day. They were staying at the Hotel George V and after returning at the end of their first day, they were told that &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; had reached number one in America.

In 1967, Egyptian singer Umm Kulthum performed a five-hour Olympia show.

On 3–4 May 1972 the Grateful Dead played two concerts here as part of their first major European tour. Both shows were recorded and songs from each were released on their 1972 live album &quot;Europe &#x27;72&quot;. In May 1975, Fripp &amp; Eno performed one of their rare instrumental loop sets at the Olympia, with tape recordings of the event being released thirty-six years later as &quot;May 28, 1975 Olympia Paris, France&quot;.

Julio Iglesias was on the stage in 1981 for his album De Niña a Mujer when a horde of woman fans came on the stage to get his autograph and trampled him onto the floor.

Jeff Buckley, long an admirer of Piaf, gave what he considered the finest performance of his career there in 1995, which was later released in 2001 on &quot;Live at L&#x27;Olympia&quot;.

Dave Gahan&#x27;s performance was released on the 2004 DVD, &quot;Live Monsters&quot;.

<text>Shortwave radiation (SW) is thermal radiation in the optical spectrum, including visible (VIS), near-ultraviolet (UV), and near-infrared (NIR) spectra.

There is no standard cut-off for the near-infrared range; therefore, the shortwave radiation range is also variously defined. It may be broadly defined to include all radiation with a wavelength of 0.1μm and 5.0μm or narrowly defined so as to include only radiation between 0.2μm and 3.0μm.

There is little radiation flux (in terms of W/m2) to the Earth&#x27;s surface below 0.2μm or above 3.0μm, although photon flux remains significant as far as 6.0μm, compared to shorter wavelength fluxes. UV-C radiation spans from 0.1μm to .28μm, UV-B from 0.28μm to 0.315μm, UV-A from 0.315μm to 0.4μm, the visible spectrum from 0.4μm to 0.7μm, and NIR arguably from 0.7μm to 5.0μm, beyond which the infrared is thermal.

Shortwave radiation is distinguished from &quot;longwave radiation&quot;. Downward shortwave radiation is related to solar irradiance and is sensitive to solar zenith angle and cloud cover.

<text>Hilbert&#x27;s problems are 23 problems in mathematics published by German mathematician David Hilbert in 1900. They were all unsolved at the time, and several proved to be very influential for 20th-century mathematics. Hilbert presented ten of the problems (1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 13, 16, 19, 21, and 22) at the Paris conference of the International Congress of Mathematicians, speaking on August 8 at the Sorbonne. The complete list of 23 problems was published later, in English translation in 1902 by Mary Frances Winston Newson in the &quot;Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society&quot;. Earlier publications (in the original German) appeared in &quot;Archiv der Mathematik und Physik&quot;.

Of the cleanly formulated Hilbert problems, numbers 3, 7, 10, 14, 17, 18, 19, 21, and 20 have resolutions that are accepted by consensus of the mathematical community. Problems 1, 2, 5, 6, 9, 11, 12, 15, and 22 have solutions that have partial acceptance, but there exists some controversy as to whether they resolve the problems. That leaves 8 (the Riemann hypothesis), 13 and 16 unresolved. Problems 4 and 23 are considered as too vague to ever be described as solved; the withdrawn 24 would also be in this class.

== The 24th problem ==
Hilbert originally included 24 problems on his list, but decided against including one of them in the published list. The &quot;24th problem&quot; (in proof theory, on a criterion for simplicity and general methods) was rediscovered in Hilbert&#x27;s original manuscript notes by German historian Rüdiger Thiele in 2000.

== Nature and influence of the problems ==
Hilbert&#x27;s problems ranged greatly in topic and precision. Some of them, like the 3rd problem, which was the first to be solved, or the 8th problem (the Riemann hypothesis), which still remains unresolved, were presented precisely enough to enable a clear affirmative or negative answer. For other problems, such as the 5th, experts have traditionally agreed on a single interpretation, and a solution to the accepted interpretation has been given, but closely related unsolved problems exist. Some of Hilbert&#x27;s statements were not precise enough to specify a particular problem, but were suggestive enough that certain problems of contemporary nature seem to apply; for example, most modern number theorists would probably see the 9th problem as referring to the conjectural Langlands correspondence on representations of the absolute Galois group of a number field. Still other problems, such as the 11th and the 16th, concern what are now flourishing mathematical subdisciplines, like the theories of quadratic forms and real algebraic curves.

There are two problems that are not only unresolved but may in fact be unresolvable by modern standards. The 6th problem concerns the axiomatization of physics, a goal that 20th-century developments seem to render both more remote and less important than in Hilbert&#x27;s time. Also, the 4th problem concerns the foundations of geometry, in a manner that is now generally judged to be too vague to enable a definitive answer.

The 23rd problem was purposefully set as a general indication by Hilbert to highlight the calculus of variations as an underappreciated and understudied field. In the lecture introducing these problems, Hilbert made the following introductory remark to the 23rd problem:

The other 21 problems have all received significant attention, and late into the 20th century work on these problems was still considered to be of the greatest importance. Paul Cohen received the Fields Medal in 1966 for his work on the first problem, and the negative solution of the tenth problem in 1970 by Yuri Matiyasevich (completing work by Julia Robinson, Hilary Putnam, and Martin Davis) generated similar acclaim. Aspects of these problems are still of great interest today.

==Knowability==
Following Gottlob Frege and Bertrand Russell, Hilbert sought to define mathematics logically using the method of formal systems, i.e., finitistic proofs from an agreed-upon set of axioms. One of the main goals of Hilbert&#x27;s program was a finitistic proof of the consistency of the axioms of arithmetic: that is his second problem.

However, Gödel&#x27;s second incompleteness theorem gives a precise sense in which such a finitistic proof of the consistency of arithmetic is provably impossible. Hilbert lived for 12 years after Kurt Gödel published his theorem, but does not seem to have written any formal response to Gödel&#x27;s work.

Hilbert&#x27;s tenth problem does not ask whether there exists an algorithm for deciding the solvability of Diophantine equations, but rather asks for the &quot;construction&quot; of such an algorithm: &quot;to devise a process according to which it can be determined in a finite number of operations whether the equation is solvable in rational integers&quot;. That this problem was solved by showing that there cannot be any such algorithm contradicted Hilbert&#x27;s philosophy of mathematics.

In discussing his opinion that every mathematical problem should have a solution, Hilbert allows for the possibility that the solution could be a proof that the original problem is impossible. He stated that the point is to know one way or the other what the solution is, and he believed that we always can know this, that in mathematics there is not any &quot;ignorabimus&quot; (statement whose truth can never be known). It seems unclear whether he would have regarded the solution of the tenth problem as an instance of ignorabimus.

On the other hand, the status of the first and second problems is even more complicated: there is no clear mathematical consensus as to whether the results of Gödel (in the case of the second problem), or Gödel and Cohen (in the case of the first problem) give definitive negative solutions or not, since these solutions apply to a certain formalization of the problems, which is not necessarily the only possible one.

==Follow-ups==
Since 1900, mathematicians and mathematical organizations have announced problem lists but, with few exceptions, these have not had nearly as much influence nor generated as much work as Hilbert&#x27;s problems.

One exception consists of three conjectures made by André Weil in the late 1940s (the Weil conjectures). In the fields of algebraic geometry, number theory and the links between the two, the Weil conjectures were very important. The first of these was proved by Bernard Dwork; a completely different proof of the first two, via ℓ-adic cohomology, was given by Alexander Grothendieck. The last and deepest of the Weil conjectures (an analogue of the Riemann hypothesis) was proved by Pierre Deligne. Both Grothendieck and Deligne were awarded the Fields medal. However, the Weil conjectures were, in their scope, more like a single Hilbert problem, and Weil never intended them as a programme for all mathematics. This is somewhat ironic, since arguably Weil was the mathematician of the 1940s and 1950s who best played the Hilbert role, being conversant with nearly all areas of (theoretical) mathematics and having figured importantly in the development of many of them.

Paul Erdős posed hundreds, if not thousands, of mathematical problems, many of them profound. Erdős often offered monetary rewards; the size of the reward depended on the perceived difficulty of the problem.

The end of the millennium, which was also the centennial of Hilbert&#x27;s announcement of his problems, provided a natural occasion to propose &quot;a new set of Hilbert problems&quot;. Several mathematicians accepted the challenge, notably Fields Medalist Steve Smale, who responded to a request by Vladimir Arnold to propose a list of 18 problems (Smale&#x27;s problems).

At least in the mainstream media, the &quot;de facto&quot; 21st century analogue of Hilbert&#x27;s problems is the list of seven Millennium Prize Problems chosen during 2000 by the Clay Mathematics Institute. Unlike the Hilbert problems, where the primary award was the admiration of Hilbert in particular and mathematicians in general, each prize problem includes a million-dollar bounty. As with the Hilbert problems, one of the prize problems (the Poincaré conjecture) was solved relatively soon after the problems were announced.

The Riemann hypothesis is noteworthy for its appearance on the list of Hilbert problems, Smale&#x27;s list, the list of Millennium Prize Problems, and even the Weil conjectures, in its geometric guise. Although it has been attacked by major mathematicians of our day, many experts believe that it will still be part of unsolved problems lists for many centuries. Hilbert himself declared: &quot;If I were to awaken after having slept for a thousand years, my first question would be: Has the Riemann hypothesis been proved?&quot;

In 2008, DARPA announced its own list of 23 problems that it hoped could lead to major mathematical breakthroughs, &quot;thereby strengthening the scientific and technological capabilities of the DoD&quot;. The DARPA list also includes a few problems from Hilbert&#x27;s list, e.g. the Riemann hypothesis.

<doc id="154602" wikidata="Q384546" url="?curid=154602" title="Gurney Halleck">
<text>Gurney Halleck is a fictional character in the &quot;Dune&quot; universe created by Frank Herbert. He is a major character in Herbert&#x27;s &quot;Dune&quot; (1965) and &quot;Children of Dune&quot; (1976) as the War Master of House Atreides, acting as mentor, friend, and advisor to Paul Atreides. He also appears in some of the prequel/sequel novels by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson.

Gurney is portrayed by Patrick Stewart in the 1984 David Lynch film &quot;Dune&quot;. P. H. Moriarty plays the role in the 2000 Sci-Fi Channel TV miniseries &quot;Frank Herbert&#x27;s Dune&quot; and its 2003 sequel, &quot;Frank Herbert&#x27;s Children of Dune&quot;. The character is portrayed by Josh Brolin in the 2021 Denis Villeneuve film &quot;Dune&quot; and its 2024 sequel &quot;&quot;.

==Characteristics==
Halleck is a talented minstrel skilled in the use of the baliset. His jawline bears a scar from an inkvine whip wound inflicted by Glossu Rabban in the Harkonnen slave pits. A loyal friend to Duke Leto Atreides and his concubine Lady Jessica, many years after Leto&#x27;s death it is suggested in &quot;Children of Dune&quot; that Gurney and Jessica have become lovers. Leto&#x27;s son Paul Atreides refers to him as &quot;Gurney the valorous&quot; in &quot;Dune&quot;, and Duke Leto comments that Paul has named Gurney well.

==Appearances==
===&quot;Dune&quot; novels===
Halleck is Paul&#x27;s weapons teacher, as well as a skilled musician. He is one of Leto&#x27;s chief officers, and serves alongside Duncan Idaho as the Weapons Master of House Atreides. According to &quot;Dune&quot;, Gurney was trained by &quot;the best fighters in the universe&quot;, and alongside Idaho and Thufir Hawat gave Leto a war council almost unparalleled in the Imperium. He manages to survive the fall of House Atreides on Arrakis with 73 men. In the years after the attack, he falls in with the melange smugglers, eventually becoming a powerful figure. His smugglers fall for a Fremen trap—a fake hoard of spice—and are almost killed before Paul, now the Fremen leader &quot;Muad&#x27;Dib&quot;, recognizes him. Halleck later becomes Jessica&#x27;s loyal chief officer after nearly killing her, mistakenly believing she betrayed Duke Leto.

In &quot;Children of Dune&quot;, Gurney returns to Arrakis with Jessica from Caladan. He coordinates a purging of dissidents along with Fremen leader Stilgar, an operation that he kept secret. He goes to the sietch Jacurutu under what he believes are Jessica&#x27;s orders to test that Paul&#x27;s son Leto II has not fallen to Abomination. When the Fremen Namri reveals that the testing was ordered by Alia, he kills the man and escapes, sending a message to Duncan to set off the course of events that will force Stilgar to act. He takes temporary shelter with a new batch of smugglers before stealing an ornithopter. With it, he escapes to a rebel sietch, where Leto II and The Preacher arrive. Leto II takes him to Shuloch. After Leto II returns to Arrakeen and takes the throne, Gurney is assigned to Sietch Tabr as part of Stilgar&#x27;s council.

===Prequels and sequels===
Gurney&#x27;s character is further explored in the &quot;Prelude to Dune&quot; prequels (1999–2001) written by Brian Herbert, Frank Herbert&#x27;s son, and Kevin J. Anderson.

According to the prequels, Gurney Halleck was born on Giedi Prime, the homeworld of House Harkonnen. After an incident with the local militia and the murder of his sister, he escaped Giedi Prime and aligned himself with the rogue House Vernius. Eventually, after a string of conflicts and the death of Earl Dominic Vernius, Gurney Halleck arrived at the Atreides homeworld of Caladan seeking the exiled Prince Rhombur Vernius. After helping reclaim the planet Ix for House Vernius, Halleck served House Atreides, eventually becoming Paul Atreides&#x27; weapons teacher.

In &quot;&quot; (1985) it is revealed that the Tleilaxu Master Scytale possesses a hidden nullentropy capsule containing cells carefully and secretly collected by the Tleilaxu for millennia, including the cells of Paul Atreides, Duke Leto, Jessica, and Gurney. A ghola of Gurney is &quot;conceived&quot; in &quot;Sandworms of Dune&quot; (2007), a sequel to the original Frank Herbert series written by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson, but is killed during gestation in an act of sabotage.

==In adaptations==
Gurney is portrayed by Patrick Stewart in the 1984 David Lynch film &quot;Dune&quot;. P. H. Moriarty plays the role in the 2000 Sci-Fi Channel TV miniseries &quot;Frank Herbert&#x27;s Dune&quot; and its 2003 sequel, &quot;Frank Herbert&#x27;s Children of Dune&quot;. The character is portrayed by Josh Brolin in the 2021 Denis Villeneuve film &quot;Dune&quot;, who reprised the role in the 2024 sequel &quot;&quot;.

==Merchandising==
A line of &quot;Dune&quot; action figures, styled after David Lynch&#x27;s film, was released in 1984 by toy company LJN to lackluster sales. A figure of Gurney previewed in LJN&#x27;s catalog was never produced.

<doc id="154609" wikidata="Q212773" url="?curid=154609" title="Antigua Guatemala">
<text>Antigua Guatemala (), commonly known as Antigua or La Antigua, is a city in the central highlands of Guatemala. The city was the capital of the Captaincy General of Guatemala from 1543 through 1773, with much of its Baroque-influenced architecture and layout dating from that period. These characteristics had it designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1979. Antigua Guatemala serves as the capital of the homonymous municipality and the Sacatepéquez Department.

== Population ==
The city had a peak population of some 65,000 in the 1770s; the bulk of the population moved away in the late 18th century after the 1773 Guatemala earthquake. Despite significant population growth in the late 20th century, the city had only reached half that number by the 1990s. At the time of the 2007 census, the city had 34,685 inhabitants. 

== History ==
&quot;Antigua Guatemala&quot; means &quot;Old Guatemala&quot; and was the third capital of Guatemala, formerly called &quot;Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala&quot;.

The first capital of Guatemala was founded on the site of a Kaqchikel-Maya city, named Iximche, on Monday, July 25, 1524—the day of Saint James—and therefore named Ciudad de Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala (City of Saint James of the Knights of Guatemala). According to Catholic Tradition, St. James (Santiago) became the patron saint of the city.

After several Kaqchikel uprisings, the capital was moved to a more suitable site in the Valley of Almolonga (place of water) on November 22, 1527, and kept its original name. This new city was located on the site of present-day San Miguel Escobar, which is a neighborhood in the municipality of Ciudad Vieja. This city was destroyed on September 11, 1541, by a devastating lahar from the Volcán de Agua. As a result, the colonial authorities decided to move the capital once more, this time away to the Panchoy Valley. So, on March 10, 1543, the Spanish conquistadors founded present-day Antigua, and again, it was named Santiago de los Caballeros. For more than 200 years, it served as the seat of the military governor of the Spanish colony of Guatemala, a large region that included almost all of present-day Central America and the southernmost State of Mexico: Chiapas.

Santiago de los Caballeros was the third seat of the capital called kingdom of Guatemala, which included the current states of Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica, besides modern state of Chiapas in Mexico. After a flood destroyed the second city, located in the Valley of Almolonga, on the slopes of Volcán de Agua, a new city was built in 1543 in the Valley of Panchoy, and it was established as head of the Real Audiencia of Guatemala in 1549.

The city was laid out in a square pattern, with streets running north to south and from east to west, with a central square. Both church and government buildings were designated important places around the central plaza. Between 1549 and 1563, property southeast of the square was sold to the crown and occupied by the first president of the Real Audiencia de los Confines: the lawyer Alonso Lopez Cerrato, who also served as governor and captain general. The original building was small and paneled with portal, tile roof, and adobe walls. The city is surrounded by three enormous volcanoes and mountains, plains and hills. This territory was called Valley of Guatemala and had 73 villages, two towns and the city of Santiago de los Caballeros.

Due to constant problems between the conquerors and the representatives of the crown sent by the king of Spain, the Audiencia de los Confines was abolished in 1565. In 1570 the assembly was restored, this time independent of the viceroy of Mexico, and was called Audiencia of Guatemala.

The Franciscan friars were the first to move into the valley Panchoy, the new capital of the Kingdom of Guatemala, and built a chapel on the site where later the Church Escuela de Cristo would be erected. This primitive chapel was destroyed in 1575 by an earthquake and during the next ten years collections were made to build the new complex, two blocks from the previous one. The Franciscan complex became a major cultural and religious center for the entire Captaincy General of Guatemala. Theologians, jurists, philosophers, physicists, and mathematicians studied in the school of San Buenaventura, which was located where the monastery ruins are. Notable students included Cristóbal de Villalpando, Thomas Merlo, and Alonso de Paz.
The first building of a cathedral was begun in 1545 with the debris brought from the destroyed settlement in the valley of Almolonga; however, its construction was hampered by frequent earthquakes throughout the years. The city was the final resting place of the great Spanish chronicler Bernal Díaz del Castillo, and his remains were interred in one of the churches that was eventually ruined by earthquakes.

The construction of the royal houses for the residence of the Captain General and the members of the Real Audiencia started in 1558; the complex also included the Royal Treasury, jail, Army quarters, the Hall of Arms, and the housing of Audiencia members.

In the sixteenth century, there were several important earthquakes on the following dates: 
*March 21, 1530 
*September 11, 1541 
*1565 (exact date unknown)
*1575 (exact date unknown)
*November 30, 1577 
*December 23, 1585

In 1566 King Felipe II of Spain gave it the title of &quot;Muy Noble y Muy Leal&quot; (&quot;Very Noble and Very Loyal&quot;).

=== 17th-century events ===
The Jesuits founded the school of &quot;San Lucas of the Society of Jesus&quot; in 1608, which became famous and was unrivaled in terms of literature and grammar lessons; it was attended by the elite nobles of the city society, such as Francisco Antonio Fuentes y Guzman, the chronicler Francisco Vázquez, and Pedro Betancourt. On 18 July 1626, the Jesuit temple was inaugurated; along with the rest of the city, it suffered and was damaged by continuous earthquakes that struck the city between the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries.

The monks of San Juan de Dios founded their hospital and monastery in 1636 and thereafter were in charge of the hospitals in the Kingdom of Guatemala. Their hospitals were: 
*San Alejo: for indigenous people
*San Pedro: for ecclesiastical personnel
*Santiago: for Spanish and mulattos 
*San Lázaro 
*San Juan de Dios: in 1667 the hospital of San Alejo was delivered to the Brothers of San Juan de Dios by the Dominicans who had managed it until then; in 1685, San Alejo and Santiago hospitals joined together, forming the Hospital San Juan de Dios.

The temple of the Escuela de Cristo -School of Christ- was founded in the parish of Our Lady of Remedios in 1664 and from 1689 onward it was known as the Congregation of San Felipe de Neri. Meanwhile, around 1690, the Jesuits founded another school: the &quot;San Francisco de Borja&quot; where the poet and priest Rafael Landivar, S.J., eventually would study and serve as principal.

==== Saint Hermano Pedro ====
Pedro de San José Betancourt came to Guatemalan land in 1650 from his native Tenerife. Upon arrival he suffered a serious illness, during which he had the first opportunity to be with the poor and dispossessed. After his recovery he wanted to pursue ecclesiastical studies but unable to do so, professed as a Franciscan tertiary in the Convent of San Francisco in Santiago de los Caballeros. He founded shelters for the poor, indigenous, and homeless, and founded the Order of the Brothers of Our Lady of Bethlehem in 1656, to serve the poor. Santo Hermano Pedro wrote several books, including: Instruction De la Cruz&#x27;s brother, Crown of the Passion of Jesus Christ our good or Rules Confraternity Betlemitas. He is considered the great evangelist of the West Indies, just as San Francisco Javier is to the East Indies. Brother Pedro attended to the poor, sick, orphaned, and dying, and was an early promoter of Human Rights. Additionally, he was the first literacy advocate in America, and the Order of Betlemitas in turn was the first religious order born in the Americas. The Santo Hermano Pedro was a man ahead of his time, both in his methods of teaching reading and writing to the illiterate and in medical patient treatment.

==== Royal and pontifical University of San Carlos Borromeo ====

Francisco Marroquín, first bishop of Guatemala, sent the Spanish King a letter in 1548, asking for a superior education institution for Guatemala, but the letter went unanswered. Towards the end of his life, in 1562, Marroquín left some money in his will to establish a school -which eventually was the &quot;Santo Tomás de Aquino school&quot;- where grammar, arts, philosophy, and theology would be taught. Poor Spanish children would be the beneficiaries of this pious work, as they could not travel to those cities where there were universities already, such as México City in the New Spain. Historian John Tate Lanning said regarding this that, &quot;Marroquín&#x27;s testament is so famous, that many people who have not even laid eyes on it say that there are things in the document that are really not in it. Marroquín never talks about a University, much less establishing one...&quot; On the other hand, there is indeed a document from Mayor Pedro Crespo Suarez, who left twenty thousand pesos after his death to set up classes in the university that &quot;was being asked of the crown&quot;.

The Jesuits opposed a university establishment, given that they did not like the idea of having the other regular clergy orders -Mercedarians, Franciscans and Order of Preachers- taking the initiative in religious and educational issues. In August 1655, the Society of Jesus had bought the whole lot from the Díaz del Castillo family and by then, their San Lucas School was well known in the region and it even granted two university degrees. In 1653, the San Lucas School had a staff of only thirteen priests, a very small number compared to the size of the building; the Jesuits, however, made a major impact on the cultural and educational life in the Capitanía General of Guatemala. The school was the city&#x27;s most prestigious, and from it graduated most of the elite members of society of the time. Most of its students were secular and went on to get the best positions in the country.

After several decades, petitions, and lawsuits, King Carlos II expedited a royal decree, on January 31, 1676, allowing Capitanía General of Guatemala to establish its university or &quot;General Study.&quot; After a lengthy and cumbersome organizational process that lasted five years, the university started classes on January 7, 1681, with more than sixty registered students under President Doctor José de Baños y Soto Mayor, Cathedral archdeacon, King of Spain preacher and Doctor from the University of Osuna. The university began its activities under the protection of Saint Carlos Borromeo, and its norms and regulations were copied from those of the México University which, in turn, were adapted from those of the Universidad de Salamanca in Spain.

The first classes given in the university were:
*Canonic law
*Medicine
*Scholastic theology
*Moral theology
*Languages

The Royal University of San Carlos Borromeo became pontifical via the papal bull of Pope Innocent XI, issued and dated 18 June 1687.

=== 18th-century events ===

==== San Miguel Earthquake====

The strongest earthquakes experienced by the city of Santiago de los Caballeros before its final move in 1776 were the San Miguel earthquakes in 1717. At that time, the power of the Catholic Church over the Spanish Empire&#x27;s citizens was absolute and any natural disaster was considered as divine punishment. In the city, people also believed that the proximity of the Volcán de Fuego (English: Volcano of Fire) was the cause of earthquakes; the great architect Diego de Porres even said that all the earthquakes were caused by volcano explosions.

On August 27 there was a strong eruption of Volcán de Fuego, which lasted until August 30; the residents of the city asked for help to Santo Cristo of the cathedral and to the Virgen del Socorro who were sworn patrons of the Volcan de Fuego. On August 29, a Virgen del Rosario procession took to the streets after a century without leaving her temple, and there were many more holy processions until 29 September, the day of San Miguel. Early afternoon earthquakes were minor, but at about 7:00 p.m. there was a strong earthquake that forced residents to leave their homes; tremors and rumblings followed until four o&#x27;clock. The neighbors took to the streets and loudly confessed their sins, bracing for the worst.

The San Miguel earthquake damaged the city considerably, to the point that some rooms and walls of the Royal Palace were destroyed. There was also a partial abandonment of the city, food shortages, lack of manpower, and extensive damage to the city infrastructure, not to mention numerous dead and injured. These earthquakes made the authorities consider moving to a new city less prone to seismic activity. City residents strongly opposed the move, and even took to the Royal Palace in protest; in the end, the city did not move, but the number of troops of the Army Battalion required to maintain order was considerable. The damage to the palace was repaired by Diego de Porres, who finished repairs in 1720, although there are indications that there was additional work done by Porres until 1736.

==== San Casimiro earthquake ====
On March 4, 1751, the San Casimiro earthquake destroyed the city of Santiago de Guatemala once more. The church roof of the Society of Jesus complex fell to the ground, forcing the Jesuits once again to ask for help from the parishioners to rebuild. Once again, the building was among the most beautiful in the city when the repairs were completed. In fact, a period of prosperity began after the San Casimiro earthquake, as the city saw major improvements such as street embellishment and the introduction of a tap water system. A new City Hall was built, and on July 17, 1753, work on the Jesuit plaza in front of the church was finished.

==== Santa Marta earthquake ====

On 12 June 1773 Captain General Martín de Mayorga was inaugurated, and alongside Cortés y Larráz and the regular clergy vicars, were the top authorities in the Kingdom of Guatemala and would be the main characters in the events that followed the 1773 earthquakes.

In 1773, the Santa Marta earthquakes destroyed much of the town, which led to the third change in location for the city. The Spanish Crown ordered, in 1776, the removal of the capital to a safer location, the Valley of the Shrine, where Guatemala City, the modern capital of Guatemala, now stands. This new city did not retain its old name and was christened Nueva Guatemala de la Asunción (New Guatemala of the Assumption), and its patron saint is Our Lady of the Assumption. The badly damaged city of Santiago de los Caballeros was ordered abandoned, although not everyone left, and was thereafter referred to as la Antigua Guatemala (the Old Guatemala).

The Santa Marta earthquake practically demolished the church and sections of the convent of the Society of Jesus. Its cloisters and towers were in ruins, the walls were at dangerous angles, and the &quot;Casa de Ejercicios&quot; was turned into rubble. By a Royal decree of July 21, 1775, the city move to the &quot;Virgin valley&quot; was authorized. This was a final order that had to be obeyed by all the people, who started to move slowly, starting on December of that year. In order to build the new city it was necessary to get construction material from the old abandoned churches in Santiago de Guatemala. However, in the case of the Society of Jesus church, there was strong opposition from the neighbors to any possible dismantling of the structure since they considered that it could still be repaired.

=== 19th-century events ===

==== After the capital moved to La Ermita ====
After the independence of Guatemala from Spain in 1821, the Jesuit complex became public property once again and was in several lawsuits that lasted until 1829, when the regular clergy and the conservative Aycinena clan were expelled from Central America after the invasion of liberal general Francisco Morazán and the establishment of a secular government. The new liberal government decreed that all the confiscated Catholic church possessions had to be turned into elementary schools and university classrooms.

As of 1850, Antigua had an estimated population of 9,000. and by 1865, the building was functioning as a vapor activated thread mill, but it was not profitable due to a lack of expert technicians and raw material; and by 1872, the Jesuits were once again expelled from Guatemala by the liberal regime of Justo Rufino Barrios.

In 1884 City Hall made an announcement that it intended to transform the old Society of Jesus buildings into a market, in spite of the strong opposition from the neighbors that already had small shops on the plaza. It was not until 1912 that a market was placed in the complex.

=== 20th-century events ===

In April 1920, during the very last days of Manuel Estrada Cabrera regime, prince Wilhelm of Sweden visited Antigua, Guatemala and wrote about his impressions of the city in his book &quot;Between Two Continents&quot;. His book is an objective description of the terrible conditions the road and the ruins used to be in: &quot;For some little way outside Guatemala City it was a fairly decent car ride, but then the roads began developing sand drifts, and later, rockfalls of tumbled stone as two years earlier, the country had been devastated by a powerful earthquake and government corruption made the recovery impossible&quot;. &quot;The hills grew steeper and steeper, the jolting more pronounced and the stones even sharper; besides, on top of the road was a two-foot layer of dust which hid the pitfalls but did not detract from their effect&quot;. &quot;Along the way, they passed long lines of Indians on their way to Guatemala City, carrying their heavy burdens with apparent ease; men, women and children carried something in the way of a load, and they all carried it quickly. With respect to traffic, it was almost non-existent, aside from mule-pulled wagons&quot;.

After passing Mixco, the road proceeded more steeply upward, with a precipitous drop on one side and sheer cliff rising on the other; here and there a cross stood by the wayside, marking the spot where some traveler had died. After reaching the highest point, they started down towards Antigua. The city was in sight when a person in uniform planted himself in front of the car; it turned out to be the city commandant, along with six soldiers with wooden guns. Compared to Guatemala City at the time, Antigua was quite nicely kept, although all the churches were equally dilapidated and left entirely to themselves, as rebuilding since 1773 was confined to the strictly necessary. For the most part, only blank walls and shattered domes remained to greet the visitor by 1920, and some of the churches were in pitiful conditions. In Santa Clara, for example, a mule was grazing, and in the Church of Grace a native family had taken up its quarters, along with their varied collection of domestic animals.

But there were other monuments in decent shape: 
*The Escuela de Cristo was one of the best preserved churches and was united with a convent that was still standing. The priest that received the Prince and his three companions told them that all the silver and gold from the church had already been sold by his predecessors, so that he, to his extreme regret, was unable to sell any to them.
*The old Capuchin monastery with its many underground passages from the monks&#x27; cells to those of the nuns was worth a visit, especially one part where the cells were built in a circle surrounding a central common chamber.

=== UNESCO World Heritage Site ===
Because of its outstanding Spanish Baroque-influenced architecture, layout, churches, and ruins, and the city&#x27;s importance during the early colonial period of the country, Antigua Guatemala was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1979.

== Antigua Guatemala in the 21st century ==

Central Park – Parque Central – is the heart of the city, with the reconstructed fountain there acting as a popular gathering spot. To the north of the Central Park is the Arco de Santa Catalina, one of the most recognizable architectural landmarks of Antigua.

La Antigua is noted for its very elaborate religious celebrations during Lent (Cuaresma), leading up to Holy Week (&quot;Semana Santa&quot;) and Easter (&quot;Pascua&quot;). Each Sunday during Lent, one of the local parishes sponsors a Procession through the streets of Antigua. Elaborate and artistic carpets, predominantly made of dyed sawdust, flowers, pine needles, and even fruits and vegetables, adorn the processions&#x27; paths. 

Due to its popularity among tourists and its very well-developed tourism infrastructure, Antigua Guatemala is often used as a central location from which to visit other tourist areas in Guatemala and Central America. Cruise ships that dock at Guatemalan ports offer trips to Antigua from both the Pacific and Atlantic. Antigua also holds a sizeable retirement community of expatriates from the US and Europe. 

==Economy==
Historically, the area was considered to be one of the finest agriculturally in Guatemala. Tourism is the main driver of the economy. Antigua is also a coffee-producing region of Anacafé.

==Language schools==

Antigua is known as a destination for people who want to learn Spanish through immersion. There are many Spanish language schools in Antigua, and it is one of the most popular and best recognized centers for studying the Spanish language by students from Europe, Asia, and North America. Language institutes are one of the primary industries of Antigua, along with tourism.

==Sports==

Antigua GFC football club plays in the Guatemalan top division. Their home stadium is the Estadio Pensativo, which has a capacity of 10,000. They are nicknamed &quot;Los panzas verdes&quot; (&quot;Green bellies&quot;) and have been successful nationally, having won the title four times since 2015.

==Cuisine==

There are many restaurants in Antigua. Small eateries can be found at the Antigua marketplace next to the central bus stop, where you will find traditional Guatemalan dishes such as the traditional/Chapin breakfast, for example: refried beans, fried egg, fried plantain, and fresh cheese, served with handmade tortillas. Throughout Antigua you can find many cuisines from around the world: Mediterranean, Italian, Asian, American, and British pies and French pastries.

==Health==

Antigua is served by two main hospitals, Hospital Nacional Pedro de Bethancourt and a Guatemalan Institute of Social Security hospital. Emergency medical services are provided by Bomberos Municipales (Guatemala) and Bomberos Voluntarios (Guatemala), who have both previously worked with LFR International to improve prehospital care.

==Ecology==

Three large volcanoes dominate the horizon around Antigua. The most commanding, to the south of the city, is the Volcán de Agua or &quot;Volcano of Water&quot;, some high. When the Spanish arrived, the inhabitants of the area, Kakchikel Mayas, called it Hunapú (and they still do). However, it became known as Volcán de Agua after a lahar from the volcano buried the second site of the capital, which prompted the Spanish authorities to move the capital to present-day Antigua. The original site of the second capital is now the village San Miguel Escobar.

To the west of the city are a pair of peaks, Acatenango, which last erupted in 1972, some high, and the Volcán de Fuego or &quot;Volcano of Fire&quot;, some high. &quot;Fuego&quot; is famous for being almost constantly active at a low level. Steam and gas issue from its top almost daily, while a larger eruption occurred in September 2012.

==Tourism==
Antigua is a growing tourist destination in Guatemala as it is close to Guatemala City but is much calmer and safer, with more tourist oriented activities. It is possible to take buses from Antigua to many parts of Guatemala. Many travel agencies offer shuttles to the main tourist places: Monterrico beach, Atitlan Lake, Coban, Lanquín (Semuc Champey), or Tikal, though the transportation is more central in Guatemala City. Antigua is also known for its chocolate makers.

===Spanish Colony monuments===
Before it was declared a National Monument by president Jorge Ubico on March 30, 1944, the city ruins were practically abandoned. The following galleries show images of the destruction of the structures due to earthquakes and abandonment. There were other churches, such as Nuestra Señora del Carmen and the Society of Jesus, that endured the 1773 earthquake relatively well, but they were abandoned and the earthquakes from 1917 to 1918 and 1976 destroyed them. In the particular case of de San Francisco El Grande church, it was in good structural condition after the 1773 and 1917 earthquakes, and it was rebuilt in 1967 when the Franciscans returned to Guatemala. This eventually protected the structure from significant damage in the 1976 earthquake. Finally, La Merced church was practically new in 1773, and it has withstood time and earthquakes since; the church was not abandoned in 1776, but it was indeed abandoned in 1829 when the Mercedarians were expelled from Central America by general Francisco Morazán, along with the rest of regular clergy and the conservative party members and Aycinena family.

===Holy Week===
The most traditional processions are:

=== Art ===
Antigua is also home to the National Museum of Guatemalan Art, which is housed in the Palace of the Captaincy General, a UNESCO-designated World Heritage Site dating to the 16th century.

==In films==

===&quot;The New Adventures of Tarzan&quot; (1935)===


In 1935, the film &quot;The New Adventures of Tarzan&quot; was filmed on location in Guatemala, taking advantage of the help from the United Fruit Company and president Jorge Ubico. The places where the filming was made were:

*Chichicastenango: scenes of a native town where the explorers first met.
*Antigua Guatemala: The Green Goddess temple
*Río Dulce
*Puerto Barrios: arrival and departure of the boats carrying the explorers
*Tikal: jungle scenes
*Quiriguá: Mayan city where they get lectured on the Maya civilization
*Guatemala City: then luxurious Palace Hotel was used to shoot the scenes of the hotel in the imaginary town of At Mantique

===&quot;The Border&quot;: 1982===
The initial earthquake sequences from the Jack Nicholson film &quot;The Border&quot; were filmed in Antigua Guatemala, specifically in La Recoleccion Architectural Complex.

==Climate==
Antigua Guatemala has a subtropical highland climate (Köppen: &quot;Cwb&quot;).
==Geographic location==

Antigua Guatemala is surrounded by the municipalities of Sacatepéquez:

<text>Sacatepéquez () is one of the 22 departments of Guatemala. The name comes from Sacatepéquez, a city from November 21, 1542, until July 29, 1773, when it was destroyed by the 1773 Guatemalan Earthquake (Santa Marta Earthquake). Sacatepéquez means &quot;grasshill&quot; in the Nahuatl language. The capital of Sacatepéquez is Antigua Guatemala. Other important cities include Ciudad Vieja and San Lucas Sacatepéquez, which also hosts a marketplace and is a culinary attraction. The Chajoma were a group of indigenous people who were Kaqchikel speaking Maya, they identified Mixco Viejo as their capital, and spread throughout the Sacatepequez Department until their capital was moved to Ciudad Vieja, in Antigua.

== Name==

Sacatepéquez has also been spelled &quot;Zacatepeques&quot;.

==Population==

Sacatepéquez Department has a population of 330,469 (2018 census). 40.2% of the population identifies as Maya, with 37.7% belonging to the Kaqchikel Maya. In 1850, the area had a population of an estimated 56,000. The southern area, which is closer to Guatemala City, has the largest population. 

== Municipalities ==

# Antigua Guatemala
# Ciudad Vieja
# Jocotenango
# Magdalena Milpas Altas
# Pastores
# San Antonio Aguas Calientes

# San Lucas Sacatepéquez
# San Miguel Dueñas
# Santiago Sacatepéquez
# Santa Catarina Barahona
# Santa Lucía Milpas Altas
# Santa María de Jesús
# Santo Domingo Xenacoj
# Sumpango

==Geography==

The area is mountainous, with what the British described, in 1850, as a &quot;mild climate.&quot; Guatemala hosts a chain of active and dormant volcanoes, with those in Sacatepequez including Acatenago, Volcan De Agua (Volcano of Water), and Volcan de Fuego (Volcano of Fire). Jocotes, a fruit of the cashew family, grow in the region.

==Economy==

The more populated areas produce fruit and various crops, including maize. Livestock is also raised, with trade going towards Guatemala City. The southern area of the department produces coffee, sugar, tobacco, and cotton. As of 1850, products were being shipped out of Iztapa. Although Guatemala is able to produce cash crops such as bananas and textiles, 72% of people living in rural areas live in poverty with 31% of them reaching extreme poverty.

== Culture ==

=== Art ===
Sacatepéquez is also home to the National Museum of Guatemalan Art, which is located in Antigua Guatemala.

<text>In mathematics, a negative number is the opposite of a positive real number. Equivalently, a negative number is a real number that is less than zero. Negative numbers are often used to represent the magnitude of a loss or deficiency. A debt that is owed may be thought of as a negative asset. If a quantity, such as the charge on an electron, may have either of two opposite senses, then one may choose to distinguish between those senses—perhaps arbitrarily—as &quot;positive&quot; and &quot;negative&quot;. Negative numbers are used to describe values on a scale that goes below zero, such as the Celsius and Fahrenheit scales for temperature. The laws of arithmetic for negative numbers ensure that the common-sense idea of an opposite is reflected in arithmetic. For example, −(−3) = 3 because the opposite of an opposite is the original value.

Negative numbers are usually written with a minus sign in front. For example, −3 represents a negative quantity with a magnitude of three, and is pronounced and read as &quot;minus three&quot; or &quot;negative three&quot;. Conversely, a number that is greater than zero is called &quot;positive&quot;; zero is usually (but not always) thought of as neither positive nor negative. The positivity of a number may be emphasized by placing a plus sign before it, e.g. +3. In general, the negativity or positivity of a number is referred to as its sign.

Every real number other than zero is either positive or negative. The non-negative whole numbers are referred to as natural numbers (i.e., 0, 1, 2, 3...), while the positive and negative whole numbers (together with zero) are referred to as integers. (Some definitions of the natural numbers exclude zero.)

In bookkeeping, amounts owed are often represented by red numbers, or a number in parentheses, as an alternative notation to represent negative numbers.

Negative numbers were used in the &quot;Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art&quot;, which in its present form dates from the period of the Chinese Han dynasty (202 BC – AD 220), but may well contain much older material. Liu Hui (c. 3rd century) established rules for adding and subtracting negative numbers. By the 7th century, Indian mathematicians such as Brahmagupta were describing the use of negative numbers. Islamic mathematicians further developed the rules of subtracting and multiplying negative numbers and solved problems with negative coefficients. Prior to the concept of negative numbers, mathematicians such as Diophantus considered negative solutions to problems &quot;false&quot; and equations requiring negative solutions were described as absurd. Western mathematicians like Leibniz held that negative numbers were invalid, but still used them in calculations.

==Introduction==
===The number line===

The relationship between negative numbers, positive numbers, and zero is often expressed in the form of a number line:

Numbers appearing farther to the right on this line are greater, while numbers appearing farther to the left are lesser. Thus zero appears in the middle, with the positive numbers to the right and the negative numbers to the left.

Note that a negative number with greater magnitude is considered less. For example, even though (positive) is greater than (positive) , written

negative is considered to be less than negative :
===Signed numbers===

In the context of negative numbers, a number that is greater than zero is referred to as positive. Thus every real number other than zero is either positive or negative, while zero itself is not considered to have a sign. Positive numbers are sometimes written with a plus sign in front, e.g. denotes a positive three.

Because zero is neither positive nor negative, the term nonnegative is sometimes used to refer to a number that is either positive or zero, while nonpositive is used to refer to a number that is either negative or zero. Zero is a neutral number.

===As the result of subtraction===
Negative numbers can be thought of as resulting from the subtraction of a larger number from a smaller. For example, negative three is the result of subtracting three from zero:

In general, the subtraction of a larger number from a smaller yields a negative result, with the magnitude of the result being the difference between the two numbers. For example,

since .

==Everyday uses of negative numbers==

===Sport===

* Goal difference in association football and hockey; points difference in rugby football; net run rate in cricket; golf scores relative to par.
* Plus-minus differential in ice hockey: the difference in total goals scored for the team (+) and against the team (−) when a particular player is on the ice is the player&#x27;s +/− rating. Players can have a negative (+/−) rating.
* Run differential in baseball: the run differential is negative if the team allows more runs than they scored.
* Clubs may be deducted points for breaches of the laws, and thus have a negative points total until they have earned at least that many points that season.
* Lap (or sector) times in Formula 1 may be given as the difference compared to a previous lap (or sector) (such as the previous record, or the lap just completed by a driver in front), and will be positive if slower and negative if faster.
* In some athletics events, such as sprint races, the hurdles, the triple jump and the long jump, the wind assistance is measured and recorded, and is positive for a tailwind and negative for a headwind.

===Science===
* Temperatures which are colder than 0 °C or 0 °F. 
* Latitudes south of the equator and longitudes west of the prime meridian.
* Topographical features of the earth&#x27;s surface are given a height above sea level, which can be negative (e.g. the surface elevation of the Dead Sea or Death Valley, or the elevation of the Thames Tideway Tunnel).
* Electrical circuits. When a battery is connected in reverse polarity, the voltage applied is said to be the opposite of its rated voltage. For example, a 6-volt battery connected in reverse applies a voltage of −6 volts.
* Ions have a positive or negative electrical charge.
* Impedance of an AM broadcast tower used in multi-tower directional antenna arrays, which can be positive or negative.

===Finance===
* Financial statements can include negative balances, indicated either by a minus sign or by enclosing the balance in parentheses. Examples include bank account overdrafts and business losses (negative earnings).
* The annual percentage growth in a country&#x27;s GDP might be negative, which is one indicator of being in a recession.
* Occasionally, a rate of inflation may be negative (deflation), indicating a fall in average prices.
* The daily change in a share price or stock market index, such as the FTSE 100 or the Dow Jones.
* A negative number in financing is synonymous with &quot;debt&quot; and &quot;deficit&quot; which are also known as &quot;being in the red&quot;.
* Interest rates can be negative, when the lender is charged to deposit their money.

===Other===
* The numbering of stories in a building below the ground floor.
* When playing an audio file on a portable media player, such as an iPod, the screen display may show the time remaining as a negative number, which increases up to zero time remaining at the same rate as the time already played increases from zero.
* Television game shows:
** Participants on &quot;QI&quot; often finish with a negative points score.
** Teams on &quot;University Challenge&quot; have a negative score if their first answers are incorrect and interrupt the question. 
** &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; has a negative money score – contestants play for an amount of money and any incorrect answer that costs them more than what they have now can result in a negative score.
** In &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;&#x27;s pricing game Buy or Sell, if an amount of money is lost that is more than the amount currently in the bank, it incurs a negative score.
* The change in support for a political party between elections, known as swing.
* A politician&#x27;s approval rating.
* In video games, a negative number indicates loss of life, damage, a score penalty, or consumption of a resource, depending on the genre of the simulation.
* Employees with flexible working hours may have a negative balance on their timesheet if they have worked fewer total hours than contracted to that point. Employees may be able to take more than their annual holiday allowance in a year, and carry forward a negative balance to the next year.
* Transposing notes on an electronic keyboard are shown on the display with positive numbers for increases and negative numbers for decreases, e.g. &quot;−1&quot; for one semitone down.

==Arithmetic involving negative numbers==
The minus sign &quot;−&quot; signifies the operator for both the binary (two-operand) operation of subtraction (as in ) and the unary (one-operand) operation of negation (as in , or twice in ). A special case of unary negation occurs when it operates on a positive number, in which case the result is a negative number (as in ).

The ambiguity of the &quot;−&quot; symbol does not generally lead to ambiguity in arithmetical expressions, because the order of operations makes only one interpretation or the other possible for each &quot;−&quot;. However, it can lead to confusion and be difficult for a person to understand an expression when operator symbols appear adjacent to one another. A solution can be to parenthesize the unary &quot;−&quot; along with its operand.

For example, the expression may be clearer if written (even though they mean exactly the same thing formally). The subtraction expression is a different expression that doesn&#x27;t represent the same operations, but it evaluates to the same result.

Sometimes in elementary schools a number may be prefixed by a superscript minus sign or plus sign to explicitly distinguish negative and positive numbers as in
===Addition===
Addition of two negative numbers is very similar to addition of two positive numbers. For example,

The idea is that two debts can be combined into a single debt of greater magnitude.

When adding together a mixture of positive and negative numbers, one can think of the negative numbers as positive quantities being subtracted. For example:

In the first example, a credit of is combined with a debt of , which yields a total credit of . If the negative number has greater magnitude, then the result is negative:

Here the credit is less than the debt, so the net result is a debt.

===Subtraction===
As discussed above, it is possible for the subtraction of two non-negative numbers to yield a negative answer:

In general, subtraction of a positive number yields the same result as the addition of a negative number of equal magnitude. Thus

and
On the other hand, subtracting a negative number yields the same result as the addition a positive number of equal magnitude. (The idea is that &quot;losing&quot; a debt is the same thing as &quot;gaining&quot; a credit.) Thus

and
===Multiplication===

When multiplying numbers, the magnitude of the product is always just the product of the two magnitudes. The sign of the product is determined by the following rules:
* The product of one positive number and one negative number is negative.
* The product of two negative numbers is positive.
Thus

and

The reason behind the first example is simple: adding three &#x27;s together yields :

The reasoning behind the second example is more complicated. The idea again is that losing a debt is the same thing as gaining a credit. In this case, losing two debts of three each is the same as gaining a credit of six:

The convention that a product of two negative numbers is positive is also necessary for multiplication to follow the distributive law. In this case, we know that

Since , the product must equal .

These rules lead to another (equivalent) rule—the sign of any product &quot;a&quot; × &quot;b&quot; depends on the sign of &quot;a&quot; as follows:
* if &quot;a&quot; is positive, then the sign of &quot;a&quot; × &quot;b&quot; is the same as the sign of &quot;b&quot;, and
* if &quot;a&quot; is negative, then the sign of &quot;a&quot; × &quot;b&quot; is the opposite of the sign of &quot;b&quot;.
The justification for why the product of two negative numbers is a positive number can be observed in the analysis of complex numbers.

===Division===
The sign rules for division are the same as for multiplication. For example,
and

If dividend and divisor have the same sign, the result is positive, if they have different signs the result is negative.

==Negation==

The negative version of a positive number is referred to as its negation. For example, is the negation of the positive number . The sum of a number and its negation is equal to zero:

That is, the negation of a positive number is the additive inverse of the number.

Using algebra, we may write this principle as an algebraic identity:

This identity holds for any positive number . It can be made to hold for all real numbers by extending the definition of negation to include zero and negative numbers. Specifically:
* The negation of 0 is 0, and
* The negation of a negative number is the corresponding positive number.
For example, the negation of is . In general,
The absolute value of a number is the non-negative number with the same magnitude. For example, the absolute value of and the absolute value of are both equal to , and the absolute value of is .

==Formal construction of negative integers==

In a similar manner to rational numbers, we can extend the natural numbers N to the integers Z by defining integers as an ordered pair of natural numbers (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;). We can extend addition and multiplication to these pairs with the following rules:

We define an equivalence relation ~ upon these pairs with the following rule:

This equivalence relation is compatible with the addition and multiplication defined above, and we may define Z to be the quotient set N²/~, i.e. we identify two pairs (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) and (&quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;) if they are equivalent in the above sense. Note that Z, equipped with these operations of addition and multiplication, is a ring, and is in fact, the prototypical example of a ring.

We can also define a total order on Z by writing
This will lead to an &quot;additive zero&quot; of the form (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;a&quot;), an &quot;additive inverse&quot; of (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) of the form (&quot;b&quot;, &quot;a&quot;), a multiplicative unit of the form (&quot;a&quot; + 1, &quot;a&quot;), and a definition of subtraction

This construction is a special case of the Grothendieck construction.

===Uniqueness===
The additive inverse of a number is unique, as is shown by the following proof. As mentioned above, an additive inverse of a number is defined as a value which when added to the number yields zero.

Let &quot;x&quot; be a number and let &quot;y&quot; be its additive inverse. Suppose &quot;y′&quot; is another additive inverse of &quot;x&quot;. By definition,
formula_1

And so, &quot;x&quot; + &quot;y′&quot; = &quot;x&quot; + &quot;y&quot;. Using the law of cancellation for addition, it is seen that &quot;y′&quot; = &quot;y&quot;. Thus &quot;y&quot; is equal to any other additive inverse of &quot;x&quot;. That is, &quot;y&quot; is the unique additive inverse of &quot;x&quot;.

==History==

For a long time, understanding of negative numbers was delayed by the impossibility of having a negative-number amount of a physical object, for example &quot;minus-three apples&quot;, and negative solutions to problems were considered &quot;false&quot;.

In Hellenistic Egypt, the Greek mathematician Diophantus in the 3rd century AD referred to an equation that was equivalent to formula_2 (which has a negative solution) in &quot;Arithmetica&quot;, saying that the equation was absurd. For this reason Greek geometers were able to solve geometrically all forms of the quadratic equation which give positive roots, while they could take no account of others.

Negative numbers appear for the first time in history in the &quot;Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art&quot; (九章算術, &quot;Jiǔ zhāng suàn-shù&quot;), which in its present form dates from the Han period, but may well contain much older material. The mathematician Liu Hui (c. 3rd century) established rules for the addition and subtraction of negative numbers. The historian Jean-Claude Martzloff theorized that the importance of duality in Chinese natural philosophy made it easier for the Chinese to accept the idea of negative numbers. The Chinese were able to solve simultaneous equations involving negative numbers. The &quot;Nine Chapters&quot; used red counting rods to denote positive coefficients and black rods for negative. This system is the exact opposite of contemporary printing of positive and negative numbers in the fields of banking, accounting, and commerce, wherein red numbers denote negative values and black numbers signify positive values. Liu Hui writes:
The ancient Indian &quot;Bakhshali Manuscript&quot; carried out calculations with negative numbers, using &quot;+&quot; as a negative sign. The date of the manuscript is uncertain. LV Gurjar dates it no later than the 4th century, Hoernle dates it between the third and fourth centuries, Ayyangar and Pingree dates it to the 8th or 9th centuries, and George Gheverghese Joseph dates it to about AD 400 and no later than the early 7th century,

During the 7th century AD, negative numbers were used in India to represent debts. The Indian mathematician Brahmagupta, in &quot;Brahma-Sphuta-Siddhanta&quot; (written c. AD 630), discussed the use of negative numbers to produce a general form quadratic formula similar to the one in use today.

In the 9th century, Islamic mathematicians were familiar with negative numbers from the works of Indian mathematicians, but the recognition and use of negative numbers during this period remained timid. Al-Khwarizmi in his &quot;Al-jabr wa&#x27;l-muqabala&quot; (from which the word &quot;algebra&quot; derives) did not use negative numbers or negative coefficients. But within fifty years, Abu Kamil illustrated the rules of signs for expanding the multiplication formula_3, and al-Karaji wrote in his &quot;al-Fakhrī&quot; that &quot;negative quantities must be counted as terms&quot;. In the 10th century, Abū al-Wafā&#x27; al-Būzjānī considered debts as negative numbers in &quot;A Book on What Is Necessary from the Science of Arithmetic for Scribes and Businessmen&quot;.

By the 12th century, al-Karaji&#x27;s successors were to state the general rules of signs and use them to solve polynomial divisions. As al-Samaw&#x27;al writes:
the product of a negative number—&quot;al-nāqiṣ&quot; (loss)—by a positive number—&quot;al-zāʾid&quot; (gain)—is negative, and by a negative number is positive. If we subtract a negative number from a higher negative number, the remainder is their negative difference. The difference remains positive if we subtract a negative number from a lower negative number. If we subtract a negative number from a positive number, the remainder is their positive sum. If we subtract a positive number from an empty power (&quot;martaba khāliyya&quot;), the remainder is the same negative, and if we subtract a negative number from an empty power, the remainder is the same positive number.

In the 12th century in India, Bhāskara II gave negative roots for quadratic equations but rejected them because they were inappropriate in the context of the problem. He stated that a negative value is &quot;in this case not to be taken, for it is inadequate; people do not approve of negative roots.&quot;

Fibonacci allowed negative solutions in financial problems where they could be interpreted as debits (chapter 13 of &quot;Liber Abaci&quot;, 1202) and later as losses (in &quot;Flos&quot;, 1225).

In the 15th century, Nicolas Chuquet, a Frenchman, used negative numbers as exponents but referred to them as &quot;absurd numbers&quot;.

Michael Stifel dealt with negative numbers in his 1544 AD &quot;Arithmetica Integra&quot;, where he also called them &quot;numeri absurdi&quot; (absurd numbers).

In 1545, Gerolamo Cardano, in his &quot;Ars Magna&quot;, provided the first satisfactory treatment of negative numbers in Europe. He did not allow negative numbers in his consideration of cubic equations, so he had to treat, for example, formula_4 separately from formula_5 (with formula_6 in both cases). In all, Cardano was driven to the study of thirteen types of cubic equations, each with all negative terms moved to the other side of the = sign to make them positive. (Cardano also dealt with complex numbers, but understandably liked them even less.)

<text>Drenagh is a 19th-century house and gardens in Limavady, County Londonderry, Northern Ireland. Drenagh has been the home of the McCausland family since 1729, and the present house was built in 1835. It was the first major work by Charles Lanyon, known for his work in Belfast. The gardens include features from the 18th century, as well as an extensive 19th-century Italian garden and elements added in the 1960s. The house is a Grade A listed building.

==History==
The Drenagh estate, then known as Fruithill, was acquired from the Bishopric of Derry by William Conolly (1662-1729), a wealthy self-made man and speaker of the Irish Parliament. By his will he left his interest in the property to his agent Robert McCausland “as an acknowledgment for the faithful service he has done me”, and the bequest allowed the McCauslands to establish themselves as county gentry. McCausland was the grandson of Baron Alexander McAuslane who had settled in the Strabane area in the 1540s, and he named his first son (by his wife Hannah, née Moore) Conolly McCausland for his employer. In the 1730s Robert McCausland built the first house at Fruithill, located to the south-east of the present building, and in the 1790s this house was extended. Nothing remains of this house, though a walled garden remains from this period as well as elements of the demesne landscape.

Conolly McCausland married the heiress Elizabeth Gage and had a son, also Conolly McCausland, who married Theodosia Mahon from Strokestown, County Roscommon. This second Conolly McCausland approached architect John Hargrave to design a new house, but only the gate lodge was built prior to the deaths of McCausland and Hargrave. In 1836 their son, Marcus McCausland (1787-1862), commissioned Sir Charles Lanyon to build the present house. Marcus and his wife, Marianne (née Tyndall) produced an heir, Conolly Thomas McCausland (1828-1902).

Conolly Thomas McCausland was High Sheriff of County Londonderry in 1866. He married Laura St John, daughter of the 15th Baron St John of Bletso. Their son, Maurice Marcus McCausland (1872-1938), lived through the Irish Land Acts, whereby the Government compulsorily purchased 75% of the estate. Their daughter, Laura, married Reginald Gibbs and was the mother of Michael McCausland Gibbs (1900-1962), an eminent Anglican clergyman.

Maurice&#x27;s son, Conolly Robert McCausland (1906-1968) fought in the Second World War and was reportedly so deeply moved by what he had witnessed that he was received into the Roman Catholic faith, despite knowing he had signed a codicil to his father&#x27;s will barring him from inheriting should he become a Catholic. The will was contested and was found valid, although the codicil applied only to Conolly Robert, not to any of his direct descendants. So, upon the death of Conolly Robert McCausland in 1968, his son Marcus Edgcumbe McCausland (1933-1972) inherited Drenagh. On 4 March 1972, this same Captain Marcus McCausland, aged 39, a retired Catholic member of the Ulster Defence Regiment, became the first UDR soldier murdered by the Official Irish Republican Army (OIRA). He was shot dead by the Braehead Road in Derry. In 2014, the McCausland family were forced to place Drenagh on the market, but following the partial sale of the estate the family were able to retain ownership of Drenagh.

On 5 May 1943 a Royal Air Force Vickers Wellington (LB241) crashed on the estate grounds shortly after taking off from RAF Limavady; all six crew died.

==Gardens==
The wooded demesne dates from the 18th century and is partly walled. There are terraced gardens in the Italian style, an arboretum, and a fountain inspired by one at the Villa d&#x27;Este, near Rome. The Moon Garden and Orbit Garden date from the 1960s and show Chinese and Arts &amp; Crafts influences. The site is included on the Register of Parks, Gardens and Demesnes of Special Historic Interest.

<doc id="154622" wikidata="Q7157559" url="?curid=154622" title="Peace thru Vandalism">
<text>Peace thru Vandalism is the debut EP by the American punk rock band The Vandals, released in 1982 by Epitaph Records. It was one of the first releases to be put out by the Epitaph label, founded in 1981 by Brett Gurewitz of Bad Religion. The EP was later released in 1989 on Restless Records featuring the original authorship of the songs as a
Vinyl, 12&quot;, EP, 33⅓ RPM, Reissue as well as The EP being re-released by Time Bomb Recordings in 1989 as a CD that also included the band&#x27;s first LP, &quot;When in Rome Do as the Vandals&quot;. The CD release is titled &quot;Peace Thru Vandalism / When in Rome Do as The Vandals&quot;.

The EP introduced the band&#x27;s style of fast punk rock with humorous, tongue-in-cheek lyrics and subject matter. This style would continue throughout the band&#x27;s career, as they have always shown a preference for lighthearted humor over serious or controversial subjects such as political and social issues. At the time of the EP&#x27;s release this was a somewhat novel concept, as most punk bands in the Los Angeles and Orange County areas focused on politics, social and personal issues in their music.

==Subject matter==
Several of the songs on the EP deal with events from the band members&#x27; own lives, but presented in a humorous and lighthearted manner. &quot;Urban Struggle&quot; depicts the constant fighting that would occur in the early 1980s Los Angeles/Orange County music scene between the punk rock fans who congregated at a Costa Mesa, California club called the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest and the country music fans who gathered at nearby Zubie&#x27;s. The song received radio airplay on KROQ-FM&#x27;s Rodney on the ROQ program and was the band&#x27;s first minor &quot;hit&quot; in the punk community. &quot;The Legend of Pat Brown&quot; is about a Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest patron who was arrested after he ran over two police officers, while &quot;Pirate&#x27;s Life&quot; tells of riding the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disneyland while taking the drug LSD. &quot;H.B. Hotel&quot; is a cover of the Elvis Presley song &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot; with parodied lyrics. Perhaps the most well-known song from the EP is &quot;Anarchy Burger (Hold the Government),&quot; which became something of an anthem for the band and was played at their shows well into the late 1990s. The song gained renewed interest when it was mentioned in the 2002 Vin Diesel movie &quot;xXx&quot;. The track &quot;Urban Struggle&quot; has been featured in the film &quot;SLC Punk!&quot; and the show &quot;Jackass&quot;, followed by the second film and .

<doc id="154625" wikidata="Q4019392" url="?curid=154625" title="When in Rome Do as The Vandals">
<text>When in Rome Do as The Vandals is the first album by the Huntington Beach punk rock band The Vandals, released in 1984 by National Trust Records, Its title is a play on the phrase &quot;&quot;, as the Vandals was also the name of a Germanic tribe which had invaded the Roman Empire and helped lead to its destruction. The album&#x27;s cover played on this theme by showing the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in a state of destruction. It was the band&#x27;s last recording with vocalist Stevo, who left the band shortly after due to personality conflicts with some of the other members.

On the original LP release Brent Turner is credited as having performed all of the bass tracks, but by the time of its release Chalmer Lumary had joined the band on the bass position. Chalmer&#x27;s name and photo are therefore included on the album sleeve along with those of the other members. The album sleeve also lists the seventh track as being &quot;It&#x27;s Not Unusual,&quot; a cover of a song by Burt Bacharach. The label on the LP itself, however, correctly lists this track as being a cover of &quot;Hocus Pocus&quot; by the band Focus. The sleeve also lists the album&#x27;s sixth track as being spelled &quot;Viking Suite,&quot; although the label again corrects this error by spelling it &quot;Viking Suit&quot; (as it is pronounced in the song&#x27;s lyrics).

The album was re-released in 1989 in CD format along with the band&#x27;s debut EP &quot;Peace thru Vandalism&quot; as &quot;Peace Thru Vandalism / When in Rome Do as The Vandals&quot;. The CD version was released by Restless Records (later reissued by Time Bomb Recordings) and correctly lists the song titles as described above.

<text>Glenveagh ( ; ) is the second-largest national park in all of Ireland. Located in County Donegal, it includes: Glenveagh Castle and its grounds; Lough Veagh; and much of the Derryveagh Mountains. National parks in Ireland conform to IUCN standards. As of 2024, Glenveagh is the only national park anywhere in Ulster, the northern province in Ireland.

==Geography==
The park covers 170 square kilometres and includes much of the Derryveagh Mountains, Lough Veagh and Glenveagh Castle on its shores. The castle gardens display a multitude of exotic and delicate plants.
==History==
Captain John George Adair (1823–1885), an Anglo-Irish businessman, built Glenveagh Castle and founded the Glenveagh estate. Adair came into dispute with his Irish Catholic tenants over hunting and fishing rights and trespassing sheep. During the 1861 famine, Adair evicted 44 families (224 people total) from their blackhouses on his land, earning him the nickname &quot;Black Jack Adair&quot;.

The estate passed to his wife Cornelia Adair. It was then bought by Arthur Kingsley Porter in 1929, before being bought by Henry Plumer McIlhenny in 1937. McIlhenny bequeathed Glenveagh to the Irish state in the 1970s, but continued to use the castle as a part-time residence until 1982.

The park is home to the largest herd of red deer in Ireland and the formerly extirpated golden eagle were reintroduced into the park in 2000. In winter 2018 and spring 2019, many native and non-native trees and plants were cleared from the park, and the water and pipe system was updated.

<text>Slippery When Ill is the second album by the Huntington Beach punk rock band The Vandals, released jointly in 1989 by Restless Records and Sticky Fingers Records. It was their first album to include Dave Quackenbush on vocals, who would remain the band&#x27;s singer for the rest of their career. The album was something of a departure from the punk rock formula of their previous releases, fusing a country and western style with their humorous brand of punk. The result was a sound the band called &quot;cow punk&quot; which somewhat mocked the resurgence in popularity of country music in their native Huntington Beach. Two exceptions were the songs &quot;Shi&#x27;ite Punk&quot; and &quot;(Illa Zilla) Lady Killa,&quot; which relied heavily on scratch boxes. The latter song was a re-recording of the song &quot;Ladykiller&quot; from the band&#x27;s previous album &quot;When in Rome Do as the Vandals&quot; with slightly altered lyrics.

Robbie Allen is credited in the album&#x27;s liner notes as having performed all of the bass tracks on the album, but by the time of its release original member Joe Escalante had moved from Drums into the bass position. Escalante had played drums on the album, but when he switched to bass Doug Mackinnon joined the band as their new drummer. The photo in the album&#x27;s liner notes indicates Escalante as the band&#x27;s bass player and MacKinnon as their drummer.

The exact date of release for this album is unknown, with some sources indicating it was released in late 1988.

Most of the album&#x27;s songs were re-issued in 1999 by Kung Fu Records on the album &quot;The Vandals Play Really Bad Original Country Tunes&quot;. The song &quot;Shi&#x27;ite Punk&quot; was re-issued in 2000 on the anniversary re-release of their 1990 album &quot;Fear of a Punk Planet&quot;, also on Kung Fu Records.

<text>Fear of a Punk Planet is the third album by the southern California punk rock band The Vandals, originally released in 1990 by Triple X Records. It was their first album to include the lineup of Dave Quackenbush, Warren Fitzgerald, Joe Escalante and Josh Freese, solidifying the band&#x27;s roster after several years of fluctuation. This lineup would remain intact for the rest of the band&#x27;s career, and for this reason &quot;Fear of a Punk Planet&quot; is considered by many fans to be the first proper album by the &quot;new&quot; Vandals. The album returned the band to their punk rock sound, after having played mostly in a country style on their previous album &quot;Slippery When Ill&quot;. The band would stick to a punk rock formula throughout the rest of their career. The album&#x27;s title called to mind the rap album &quot;Fear of a Black Planet&quot; by Public Enemy, released that same year. It featured guest appearances by Dweezil and Moon Unit Zappa, Scott Thunes and Kelsey Grammer. An independent music video was filmed for the album&#x27;s first track, &quot;Pizza Tran.&quot;

The album was re-released with bonus tracks in 2000 by the band&#x27;s own label Kung Fu Records in order to celebrate its tenth anniversary.

All Music Guide published a mostly positive review by Victor W. Valdivia, who commented &quot;Even if the constant juvenile humor grates after a while, the Vandals are still more composed and entertaining than most.&quot;

<doc id="154636" wikidata="Q2655346" url="?curid=154636" title="Oi to the World!">
<text>Oi to the World! is a Christmas album by the southern California punk rock band the Vandals. It was released in 1996 by their label Kung Fu Records, who also re-released it in 2000 with altered artwork and a bonus track. It was the band&#x27;s sixth full-length studio album and presented holiday-themed songs written and performed with the tongue-in-cheek humor for which the band is known.

Because Kung Fu Records itself had been formed in 1996 and was at this point still a small label, the original pressing of the album was somewhat limited and it remained relatively obscure for several years (the band&#x27;s major studio albums at this time were being released by Nitro Records). The Vandals maintained a close friendship with fellow Orange County band No Doubt, who covered the album&#x27;s title track &quot;Oi to the World&quot; for the Christmas compilation album &quot;A Very Special Christmas 3&quot; in 1997. Their version, which was produced by Vandals guitarist Warren Fitzgerald, received mainstream exposure and popularity and spawned a music video. Partly thanks to the exposure brought by association with No Doubt (with whom the Vandals also toured), fan interest in &quot;Oi to the World!&quot; increased and in 2000 Kung Fu Records, which by now had grown in size, re-released the album with new artwork and a bonus overture, as well as a new intro for the title track.

Because Vandals full-time drummer Josh Freese was involved with other musical projects at the time of the album&#x27;s recording, a number of fill-in drummers were recruited to play most of the drum tracks on the album: Brooks Wackerman of Infectious Grooves, Suicidal Tendencies and future drummer of Bad Religion, Erik Sandin of NOFX, and Rat Scabies of The Damned. Freese did play on three of the album&#x27;s tracks, and both his brother Jason Freese and father Stan Freese also appeared playing horns. The original release was dedicated to the memory of Pat Brown, a friend of the band during their formative years and subject of their 1982 song &quot;The Legend of Pat Brown&quot;. He had died in 1996.

Almost every year since the album&#x27;s release the Vandals have played a traditional &quot;Winter Formal&quot; concert in Anaheim during the holiday season, at which they perform &quot;Oi to the World!&quot; nearly in its entirety. Other than at this special show songs from the album are rarely performed in concert, with the exception of &quot;Oi to the World&quot;, which has become a regular part of their setlist.

== Reception ==

Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave the album a negative review, remarking that &quot;If you do happen to enjoy their ridiculously stupid jokes, &quot;Oi to the World&quot; is nearly as fun as anything else in their catalog, even though you might admit their fast, goofy, and essentially tuneless songs are beginning to wear a bit thin.&quot;

<doc id="154638" wikidata="Q3835185" url="?curid=154638" title="Live Fast, Diarrhea">
<text>Live Fast, Diarrhea is the fourth studio album by the southern California punk rock band The Vandals, released in 1995 by Nitro Records. It was the band&#x27;s first album for Nitro, a label started and co-owned by Dexter Holland and Greg Kriesel of The Offspring. It was also the first to be produced by Vandals guitarist Warren Fitzgerald, who would continue to produce most of their albums throughout their career, and the first to include Brooks Wackerman, who often substituted for regular drummer Josh Freese. It was a breakthrough release for the band, who would release three more albums on Nitro before moving to their own label Kung Fu Records in 2002.

The album&#x27;s title is a play on the saying &quot;live fast, die young,&quot; a popular phrase in the punk community of the late 1970s and early 1980s. The album cover is a drawing by Fitzgerald of a man shooting a pistol at an airplane, with the title misspelled as &quot;diarrea.&quot; The artwork in the liner notes includes a memo stating that the band may absolutely not use this picture on the cover. This seems to indicate that the drawing was intended as a concept for an actual photo of a man shooting at a plane, but that someone, possibly at the record label, forbade the band from using such a photo, so they simply substituted the concept drawing.

An independent music video was filmed for the song &quot;I Have a Date,&quot; which is a cover of a song by a relatively obscure Orange County punk band called The Simpletones. &quot;Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious&quot; is also a cover, of a song from the Disney movie &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;. On the track there is a musical nod to Bad Religion&#x27;s &#x27;Fuck Armageddon, This is Hell&#x27; in the intro and &#x27;We&#x27;re Only Going To Die&#x27; in the breakdown of this song. Other references to Disney occur in the songs &quot;Get in Line,&quot; which describes the experience of waiting in line at a theme park ride and includes an unmistakable message from a Disneyland attraction, and &quot;Power Mustache,&quot; which deals with an employee grooming policy at Disneyland. Several of the band members visited Disneyland frequently as youths, and this was not the first time they had referenced it in song. &quot;Ape Shall Never Kill Ape&quot; is also a film reference, to the original &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;.

Both the album and band gained increased attention thanks to an episode of the popular television show &quot;The X-Files&quot; which aired on June 10, 1995 (episode 3x03: &quot;D.P.O.&quot;). Actor Giovanni Ribisi plays a teenager in a small town who has the power to control electricity and summon lightning, and wears a number of Vandals T-shirts throughout the episode. The final scene shows Ribisi&#x27;s character incarcerated but using his power to change the channels on a television while the Vandals song &quot;Live Fast, Diarrhea&quot; plays. According to the band the idea to include their music came from &quot;X-Files&quot; creator Chris Carter, who was a longtime fan of punk rock and also a friend of band member Joe Escalante.

==Reception==

AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album 1-and-a-half stars, stating that &quot;the Vandals haven&#x27;t grown up at all on their fifth album&quot; and that &quot;neither their humor nor their musical skills have developed past the junior-high level, as they still pound out three-chord punk at a fast clip, shouting out jokey vulgarities.&quot;

<text>Congleton is a market town and civil parish in Cheshire East, Cheshire, England. It is on the River Dane, south of Manchester and north of Stoke on Trent. At the 2021 census, the parish had a population of 28,497 and the built-up area had a population of 30,005.

==Toponymy==
The town&#x27;s name is of unknown origin. The first recorded reference to it was in 1282, when it was spelt &quot;Congelton&quot;. The element &quot;Congle&quot; might relate to the old Norse &quot;kang&quot; meaning a bend, followed by the Old English element &quot;tun&quot; meaning settlement.

==History==
The first settlements in the Congleton area were Neolithic. Stone Age and Bronze Age artefacts have been found in the town. Congleton was once thought to have been a Roman settlement, although there is no archaeological or documentary evidence to support this. Congleton became a market town after Vikings destroyed nearby Davenport.

Godwin, Earl of Wessex held the town in the Saxon period. The town is mentioned in the Domesday Book, where it is listed as &quot;Cogeltone: Bigot de Loges&quot;. William the Conqueror granted the whole of Cheshire to his nephew the Earl of Chester who constructed several fortifications including the town&#x27;s castle in 1208. In the 13th century, Congleton belonged to the de Lacy family. Henry de Lacy, 3rd Earl of Lincoln granted the town its first charter in 1272, enabling it to hold fairs and markets, elect a mayor and ale taster, have a merchant guild and behead known criminals.

In 1451, the River Dane flooded, destroying a number of buildings, the town&#x27;s mill and a wooden bridge. The river was diverted, and the town was rebuilt on higher ground.

Congleton became known for bear-baiting and cockfighting in the 1620s, when they were popular sports. The town was unable to attract large crowds to its bear-baiting contests and lacked the money to pay for a new, more aggressive bear. A legend tells that Congleton spent the money they were going to spend on a bible on a bear; this legend is only partly true as only part of the fund to buy a new bible was used to buy a new bear. The legend earned Congleton the nickname Beartown. The chorus of 20th-century folk song &quot;Congleton Bear&quot;, by folk artist John Tams, runs:
:Congleton Rare, Congleton Rare
:Sold the Bible to buy a bear.

During the Civil War, former mayor and lawyer John Bradshaw became president of the court which sent Charles I to his execution in 1649. His signature as Attorney General was the first on the king&#x27;s death warrant. A plaque on Bradshaw House in Lawton Street commemorates him. Almost opposite the town hall, the White Lion public house bears a blue plaque, placed by the Congleton Civic Society, which reads: &quot;The White Lion, built 16–17th century. Said to have housed the attorney&#x27;s office where John Bradshaw, regicide, served his articles.&quot;
King Edward I granted permission to build a mill. Congleton became an important centre of textile production, especially leather gloves and lace. Congleton had an early silk throwing mill, the Old Mill built by John Clayton and Nathaniel Pattison in 1753. More mills followed, and cotton was also spun. The town&#x27;s prosperity depended on tariffs imposed on imported silk. When tariffs were removed in the 1860s, the empty mills were converted to fustian cutting. A limited silk ribbon weaving industry survived into the 20th century, and woven labels were still produced in the 1990s. Many mills survive as industrial or residential units.
In 1881, in order to improve the water supply to the town, a pumping station was built on Forge Lane to draw water from the springs in Forge Wood and pump it up to a water tower at the top of the hill. The red and yellow brick water tower was designed by the engineer William Blackshaw. A second adjacent tower was constructed later.

Congleton Town Hall was designed in the Gothic style by Edward William Godwin. It was completed in 1866.

The current hospital in Congleton was opened by the Duke of York on 22 May 1924.

In 1920 , the Marie Hall home for boys was established in West House, an 18th-century house on West Road, as a branch of the National Children’s Home. It became an approved school in 1935 and was renamed Danesford School. It was converted into a Community Home with Education in 1973, run jointly by NCH and Cheshire County Council. Danesford has since closed, and the Grade II listed buildings have been converted for residential use.

Congleton elected its first Lady Mayor in November 1945.

During the celebration marking 700 years of Congleton&#x27;s Charter in 1972 Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip visited Congleton in May, this was the first visit by a reigning monarch since the visit of King George V and Queen Mary in 1913.

In 1983 Princess Michael of Kent visited Congleton.

During the celebration marking 700 years of Mayoralty in Congleton in 2018 the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall visited the town.

In 2019 the serial rapist Joseph Mccann was arrested on a country lane in Congleton after a nationwide manhunt for him.

In 2022 a celebration marked the 750th anniversary of Congleton&#x27;s first charter. An ale taster was appointed as part of the celebrations.

In 2023 part of the Congleton town centre was regenerated as part of the Congleton Market Quarter project. The regenerated part of Congleton town centre is named the &quot;Congleton Market Quarter&quot; and opened in November 2023. Another phase of expansion for the &quot;Congleton Market Quarter&quot; was announced in December 2024, and due for completion in March 2025.

On 28 September 2024 Congleton appointed its first female town crier.

==Governance==
There are two tiers of local government covering Congleton, at civil parish (town) and unitary authority level: Congleton Town Council and Cheshire East Council. The town council is based at Congleton Town Hall on High Street.

The Congleton parliamentary constituency is a county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It includes the towns of Congleton, Alsager, Holmes Chapel, and Sandbach. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first-past-the-post system of election. The current MP is Sarah Russell of the Labour Party, the previous incumbent was Fiona Bruce of the Conservative Party.

===Administrative history===
Congleton was historically one of twelve townships within the ancient parish of Astbury, and formed part of the Northwich hundred of Cheshire. From the 17th century onwards, parishes were gradually given various civil functions under the poor laws, in addition to their original ecclesiastical functions. In some cases, including Astbury, the civil functions were exercised by each township separately rather than the parish as a whole. In 1866, the legal definition of &#x27;parish&#x27; was changed to be the areas used for administering the poor laws, and so Congleton became a civil parish.

The Congleton township was granted a municipal charter making it a borough by Henry de Lacy, 3rd Earl of Lincoln. The charter itself is not dated, but is generally assumed to have been issued in 1272, the same year that Lacy became Earl of Lincoln. The borough was reformed to become a municipal borough in 1836 under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, which standardised how most boroughs operated across the country. In 1837, the government&#x27;s boundary commissioners recommended that Buglawton should be brought within the borough boundaries, but their recommendations were not implemented. Buglawton was eventually absorbed into the borough in 1936.

The municipal borough of Congleton was abolished in 1974. Its area became part of a larger Congleton borough which also covered nearby towns and surrounding rural areas. No successor parish was created for the area of the old municipal borough at the time of the 1974 reforms, but a new parish of Congleton was subsequently created in 1980, with its parish council taking the name Congleton Town Council.

In 2009, Cheshire East Council was created, taking over the functions of the borough council and Cheshire County Council, which were both abolished.

==Geography==
Mossley is sometimes classed as the wealthier part of town. Hightown is located in Mossley. West Heath is an estate built in the early 1960s to the early 1980s. Lower Heath lies to the north of the town. There is also the town centre.

Congleton is in the valley of the River Dane. South of the town lies an expanse of green space known locally as Priesty Fields which forms a green corridor right into the heart of the town – a rare feature in English towns. Folklore says that Priesty Fields gained its name as there was no priest performing services within the town. The nearest priest was based at the nearby village of Astbury. It is told that the priest would walk along an ancient medieval pathway which ran between the fields at the Parish Church in Astbury and St Peter&#x27;s Church in Congleton.

==Economy==
The principal industries in Congleton include the manufacture of airbags and golf balls. There are light engineering factories near the town and sand extraction occurs on the Cheshire Plain.

One of the most prominent industries during the nineteenth century onwards was Berisfords Ribbons, established in 1858. It was founded by Charles Berisford and his brothers Francis and William. The brothers leased part of Victoria Mill, on Foundry Bank, owning the entire factory by 1872. By 1898, the company had offices in London, Manchester, Leeds and Bristol.

Congleton Market operates every Tuesday and Saturday from the Bridestones Centre.

Until about 2000, Super Crystalate balls, made of crystalate, were manufactured by The Composition Billiard Ball Company in Congleton. The company was then sold by its owner to Saluc S.A., the Belgian manufacturer of Aramith Balls. The name Super Crystalate was retained, but the manufacturing process was integrated into the standard process used for Aramith balls.

==Culture==

The National Trust Tudor house Little Moreton Hall is south-west of the town.

Congleton Park is located along the banks of the River Dane, just north-east of the town centre. Town Wood, on the northern edge of the park, is a Grade A Site of Biological Interest and contains many nationally important plants. Congleton Paddling Pool was built in the 1930s and is open in the summer months. Astbury Mere Country Park lies just to the south-west of the town centre, on the site of a former sand quarry. The lake is used for fishing and sailing and, despite its name, is actually in the West Heath area of Congleton, with the boundary between Congleton and Newbold Astbury parishes lying further to the south.

The independently run 300 seat Daneside Theatre is on Park Road. The 400-seat Clonter Opera Theatre is based in the village of Swettenham Heath, north of Congleton. Founded in 1971, Congleton Choral Society is a mixed voice choir which regularly performs choral works at Congleton Town Hall and other venues around the town.

Congleton Museum is on Market Square, in the centre of town. It was established in 2002 and is dedicated to Congleton&#x27;s industrial history. It also contains an ancient log boat and gold and silver coin hoards. Congleton Tourist Information Centre is on the town&#x27;s High Street.
The town annually hosts a food and drink festival, which promotes locally sourced produce/cuisine, with a jazz and blues festival which showcases acts from across the UK. In 2019, Congleton held its first annual pride event.

Congleton hosts two annual musical festivals, Congleton Jazz and Blues and Congleton Unplugged.

The town once hosted the Congleton Carnival a one-day carnival which was hosted once every two years. In the past the carnival was regarded as one of the best local carnivals in England, and used to last for up to three days and feature floats and live music among another attractions.

For six months in summer 2011 Congleton hosted an event called &quot;Bearmania&quot;, in which over sixty 5-foot fibreglass sculptures where placed around the town. Over 26,000 people came to see the bears during &quot;Bearmania&quot;.

===Media===
There is one weekly local newspaper: the locally owned and financed &quot;Congleton Chronicle&quot;. The evening newspaper &quot;The Sentinel&quot;, based in Stoke-on-Trent, also covers the town although less so than in the past. Local radio is broadcast from nearby Macclesfield-based Silk Radio, Hits Radio Staffordshire &amp; Cheshire and Greatest Hits Radio Staffordshire &amp; Cheshire from Stoke-on-Trent and BBC Radio Stoke. Community radio is provided by Moorlands Radio in Leek and Canalside Community Radio in Bollington.

Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC North West and ITV Granada. Television signals are received from the Winter Hill and the local relay transmitters.

Congleton did have its own community radio station Beartown FM, but this has now closed. There is an internet-only radio station, Congleton Radio, which started broadcasting on 25 June 2022.

Congleton is home to the third oldest rugby union club in the country, dating back to 1860. Currently fielding a mini and junior section and three adult sides, the club held the world record for the longest continuous game of rugby ever played, at 24 hours, 30 minutes and 6 seconds. The club has also pioneered the development of &#x27;walking rugby&#x27; for more senior players and has re-established a ladies&#x27; team, having previously had two of its women players represent England.

The Macclesfield Canal, completed in 1831, passes through the town. It runs from Marple Junction at Marple, where it joins the Upper Peak Forest Canal, southwards (through Bollington and Macclesfield), before arriving at Bosley. Having descended the 12 Bosley Locks over the course of about a mile (1.6 km), the canal continues through Congleton to a junction with the Hall Green Branch of the Trent &amp; Mersey Canal at Hall Green.

<doc id="154642" wikidata="Q3988903" url="?curid=154642" title="The Quickening (The Vandals album)">
<text>The Quickening is the fifth studio album by the southern California punk rock band The Vandals, released in 1996 by Nitro Records. Much of the album is characterized by themes of nihilism and teen angst, but presented with the tongue-in-cheek humor for which the band is known.

Both the band and the album attracted increased attention due to their involvement with the film &quot;Glory Daze&quot;. The Vandals recorded several songs for the film&#x27;s soundtrack, including the main theme, and the soundtrack album was released on their Kung Fu Records label that had been started by guitarist Warren Fitzgerald and bassist Joe Escalante earlier that year.

An independent music video was filmed for the song &quot;It&#x27;s a Fact&quot; and two versions were released: one with clips from the movie and one without. Because drummer Josh Freese was not available due to other commitments, regular substitute Brooks Wackerman appears in the video as the band&#x27;s drummer.

== Recording labels ==
Several studios were involved in the release of The Quickening, the album was produced by Warren Fitzgerald and recorded in early part of 1996 at various studios including Front Page Studios, Paramount Studios, Formula One Studios and the Planet of the Tapes Studios.

The album was released on July 15, 1996, by Nitro Records.

<doc id="154647" wikidata="Q6188299" url="?curid=154647" title="Jesus music">
<text>Jesus music, known as gospel beat music in the United Kingdom, is a style of Christian music that originated on the West Coast of the United States in the late 1960s and early 1970s. This musical genre developed in parallel to the Jesus movement. It outlasted the movement that spawned it and the Christian music industry began to eclipse it and absorb its musicians around 1975.

==History==
Jesus music primarily began in population centers of the United States where the Jesus movement was gaining momentum—Southern California (especially Costa Mesa and Hollywood), San Francisco, Seattle, and Chicago—around 1969–70. Large numbers of hippies and street musicians began converting to born-again Christianity. A number of these conversions, especially in southern California, were due largely to the outreach of Lonnie Frisbee and Pastor Chuck Smith of Calvary Chapel in Costa Mesa. In the aftermath of such conversions, these musicians continued playing the same styles of music that they had been playing prior to their conversion, though they now infused their lyrics with a Christian message. Of the many bands and artists that came out of this time-period, some became leaders within the Jesus movement. Most notably among them Larry Norman, Barry McGuire, Love Song, Second Chapter of Acts, Randy Stonehill, Randy Matthews, and during the mid-1970s, Keith Green.

Much of the music
was a blend of

folk music and folk rock
(Children of the Day, Paul Clark, Nancy Honeytree, Mark Heard, Noel Paul Stookey, Karen Lafferty, Debby Kerner &amp; Ernie Rettino),
soft rock (Chuck Girard, Tom Howard, Phil Keaggy, Scott Wesley Brown, Kelly Willard),
R&amp;B (Andraé Crouch (and the Disciples)),
soul music/jazz fusion (Sweet Comfort Band),
country rock (Bethlehem, Daniel Amos, Gentle Faith, The Talbot Brothers: John Michael and Terry Talbot, The Way), Ron Salsbury and JC Power Outlet
and hard rock (Agape, All Saved Freak Band, Petra, Resurrection Band, Servant).

Initially, the music tended to be relatively simple, as it drew largely on guitar-based folk and folk-rock influences. The message also seemed to be relatively simple, as the songwriters attempted to present the value of a Christ-centered spiritual experience without evoking the vocabulary or other trappings of ecclesiastical religion. Rather than quoting religious cliches or King James Bible verses, they used storytelling, allegory, imagery, and complex metaphors, often with a colloquial language that flustered conservatives.

In addition to the basic message of salvation, the lyrics often reflected the expectation of the imminent Second Coming of Christ prominent in evangelical circles at the time, reflected and heightened by the publication of &quot;The Late, Great Planet Earth&quot;. Larry Norman voiced this in his song &quot;I Wish We&#x27;d All Been Ready&quot;, singing &quot;There&#x27;s no time to change your mind/The Son has come and you&#x27;ve been left behind.&quot;

Despite the message, the music was described by many as &quot;worldly&quot; at best or as &quot;the Devil&#x27;s music&quot; in the worst case. This latter position was held by conservatives such as Bill Gothard as taught in his Basic Youth Conflicts Seminars. These were some of the main factors that caused many U.S. churches to largely reject the movement and these artists at the time. This suited many artists as they wanted to bring Jesus to non-Christians, not only to church youth.
Larry Norman addressed this culture clash in his 1972 song, &quot;Why Should The Devil Have All the Good Music?&quot;

On the West Coast of the United States, Jesus music festivals began to emerge in the summer months of the early 1970s, featuring many of the artists listed above. While the music was often loud and the venue similar to the Monterey Pop Festival and Woodstock, the atmosphere was decidedly different and attracted large crowds of camping families as well as teenagers and young adults.

By 1973, Jesus music was receiving enough attention inside the mainstream media that an industry began to emerge. By the mid-1970s, the phrase &quot;contemporary Christian music&quot; (CCM) had been coined by Ron Moore and the first edition of &quot;CCM Magazine&quot; was published in July 1977. CCM now was a combination of traditional gospel music, Southern gospel music, Jesus music artists, and in some cases a style of big-band music with Christian lyrics. By 1976, it was apparent that a new generation of performers who had grown up in the church wanted to play non-secular pop and rock music for other Christians. By the end of the 1970s the term &quot;Jesus music&quot; fell out of use as &quot;the movement&quot; was replaced by &quot;the industry&quot;.

==Outside California==
In the United Kingdom, Parchment, Roger and Jan, Judy McKenzie, Malcolm and Alwyn, Garth Hewitt, Graham Kendrick, Dave and Dana, Len Magee, Adrian Snell, etc. were some of the most notable agents of the gospel beat.

Jesus People USA is an intentional community and ministry, currently located on the North Side of Chicago. Two of the first influences of JPUSA were Cornerstone magazine and Resurrection Band.
Jim Palosaari was one of Britain&#x27;s influential Jesus people and one of the founders of the group that became JPUSA, Servant&#x27;s Highway Ministries, and Greenbelt festival in England, the largest Christian rock festival in the world.

<doc id="154649" wikidata="Q3511031" url="?curid=154649" title="Khalistan movement">
<text>The Khalistan movement is a separatist movement seeking to create a homeland for Sikhs by establishing an ethno-religious sovereign state called Khalistan () in the Punjab region. The proposed boundaries of Khalistan vary between different groups; some suggest the entirety of the Sikh-majority Indian state of Punjab, while larger claims include Pakistani Punjab and other parts of North India such as Chandigarh, Haryana, and Himachal Pradesh. Shimla and Lahore have been proposed as the capital of Khalistan.

The call for a separate Sikh state began during the 1930s, when British rule in India was nearing its end. In 1940, the first explicit call for Khalistan was made in a pamphlet titled &quot;Khalistan&quot;. With financial and political support from the Sikh diaspora, the movement flourished in the Indian state of Punjab – which has a Sikh-majority population – continuing through the 1970s and 1980s, and reaching its zenith in the late 1980s. The Sikh separatist leader Jagjit Singh Chohan said that during his talks with Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the latter affirmed his support for the Khalistan movement in retaliation for the 1971 Indo-Pakistan war, which resulted in the secession of Bangladesh from Pakistan.

The separatist insurgency in Punjab started in the early 1980s. Several Khalistani groups were involved in the armed insurgency, including Babbar Khalsa and Khalistan Commando Force, among others. In 1986, Khalistan Commando Force took responsibility for the assassination of General Arun Vaidya, in retaliation for 1984&#x27;s Operation Blue Star. By the mid-1990s, the
insurgency petered out, with the last major incident being the assassination of Chief Minister Beant Singh, who was killed in a bomb blast by a member of Babbar Khalsa. The movement failed to reach its objective for multiple reasons, including violent police crackdowns on separatists, factional infighting, and disillusionment from the Sikh population.

There is some support within India and the Sikh diaspora, with yearly demonstrations in protest of those killed during Operation Blue Star. In early 2018, some militant groups were arrested by police in Punjab, India. Former Chief Minister of Punjab Amarinder Singh claimed that the recent extremism is backed by Pakistan&#x27;s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and &quot;Khalistani sympathisers&quot; in Canada, Italy, and the UK. Shiromani Akali Dal (Amritsar) is currently the only pro-Khalistan party recognised by the Election Commission of India. As of 2024, two seats in the Indian Parliament are held by Amritpal Singh, an incarcerated pro-Khalistan activist, and Sarabjeet Singh Khalsa, who is the son of the assassin of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.

== Pre-1950s ==
Sikhs have been concentrated in the Punjab region of South Asia. Before its conquest by the British, the region around Punjab had been ruled by the confederacy of Sikh Misls. The Misls ruled over the eastern Punjab from 1733 to 1799, until their confederacy was unified into the Sikh Empire by Maharajah Ranjit Singh from 1799 to 1849.

At the end of the Second Anglo-Sikh War in 1849, the Sikh Empire was dissolved into separate princely states and the British province of Punjab. In newly conquered regions, &quot;religio-nationalist movements emerged in response to British ″divide and rule″ administrative policies, the perceived success of Christian missionaries converting Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims, and a general belief that the solution to the downfall among India&#x27;s religious communities was a grassroots religious revival.&quot;

As the British Empire began to dissolve in the 1930s, Sikhs made their first call for a Sikh homeland. When the Lahore Resolution of the Muslim League demanded Punjab be made into a Muslim state, the Akalis viewed it as an attempt to usurp a historically Sikh territory. In response, the Sikh party Shiromani Akali Dal argued for a community that was separate from Hindus and Muslims. The Akali Dal imagined Khalistan as a theocratic state led by the Maharaja of Patiala with the aid of a cabinet consisting of the representatives of other units. The country would include parts of present-day Punjab, India, present-day Punjab, Pakistan (including Lahore), and the Simla Hill States.

=== Partition of India, 1947 ===

Before the 1947 partition of India, Sikhs were not in majority in any of the districts of pre-partition British Punjab Province other than Ludhiana (where Sikhs formed 41.6% of the population). Rather, districts in the region had a majority of either the Hindus or Muslims depending on its location in the province.

British India was partitioned on a religious basis in 1947, where the Punjab province was divided between India and the newly created Pakistan. As result, a majority of Sikhs, along with the Hindus, migrated from the Pakistani region to India&#x27;s Punjab, which included present-day Haryana and Himachal Pradesh. The Sikh population, which had gone as high as 19.8% in some Pakistani districts in 1941, dropped to 0.1% in Pakistan, and rose sharply in the districts assigned to India. However, they would still be a minority in the Punjab province of India, which remained a Hindu-majority province.

=== Sikh relationship with Punjab (via Oberoi) ===
Sikh historian Harjot Singh Oberoi argues that, despite the historical linkages between Sikhs and Punjab, territory has never been a major element of Sikh self-definition. He makes the case that the attachment of Punjab with Sikhism is a recent phenomenon, stemming from the 1940s. Historically, Sikhism has been pan-Indian, with the Guru Granth Sahib (the main scripture of Sikhism) drawing from works of saints in both North and South India, while several major seats in Sikhism (e.g. Takht Sri Patna Sahib in Bihar and Hazur Sahib in Maharashtra) are located outside of Punjab.

Oberoi makes the case that Sikh leaders in the late 1930s and 1940s realized that the dominance of Muslims in Pakistan and of Hindus in India was imminent. To justify a separate Sikh state within the Punjab, Sikh leaders started to mobilize meta-commentaries and signs to argue that Punjab belonged to Sikhs and Sikhs belong to Punjab. This began the territorialization of the Sikh community.

This territorialization of the Sikh community would be formalized in March 1946, when the Sikh political party of Akali Dal passed a resolution proclaiming the natural association of Punjab and the Sikh religious community. Oberoi argues that despite having its beginnings in the early 20th century, Khalistan as a separatist movement was never a major issue until the late 1970s and 1980s when it began to militarize.

==1950s to 1970s==

There are two distinct narratives about the origins of the calls for a sovereign Khalistan. One refers to the events within India itself, while the other privileges the role of the Sikh diaspora. Both of these narratives vary in the form of governance proposed for this state (e.g. theocracy vs democracy) as well as the proposed name (i.e. Sikhistan vs Khalistan). Even the precise geographical borders of the proposed state differs among them although it was generally imagined to be carved out from one of various historical constructions of the Punjab.

=== Emergence in India ===

Established on 14 December 1920, Akali Dal was a Sikh political party that sought to form a government in Punjab.

Following the 1947 independence of India, the Punjabi Suba movement, led by the Akali Dal, sought the creation of a province (&quot;suba&quot;) for Punjabi people. The Akali Dal&#x27;s maximal position of demands was a sovereign state (i.e. Khalistan), while its minimal position was to have an autonomous state within India. The issues raised during the Punjabi Suba movement were later used as a premise for the creation of a separate Sikh country by proponents of Khalistan.

As the religious-based partition of India led to much bloodshed, the Indian government initially rejected the demand, concerned that creating a Punjabi-majority state would effectively mean yet again creating a state based on religious grounds.

On 7 September 1966, the &quot;Punjab Reorganisation Act&quot; was passed in Parliament, implemented with effect beginning 1 November 1966. Accordingly, Punjab was divided into the state of Punjab and Haryana, with certain areas to Himachal Pradesh. Chandigarh was made a centrally administered Union territory. While the Union Government led by Indira Gandhi agreed with the creation of Punjab state but refused to make Chandigarh as its capital and also refused to make it autonomous. The outcome of the Punjabi Suba movement failed to meet demands of its leaders.

====Anandpur Resolution====

As Punjab and Haryana now shared the capital of Chandigarh, resentment was felt among Sikhs in Punjab. Adding further grievance, a canal system was put in place over the rivers of Ravi, Beas, and Sutlej, which flowed through Punjab, in order for water to also reach Haryana and Rajasthan. As result, Punjab would only receive 23% of the water while the rest would go to the two other states. The fact that the issue would not be revisited brought on additional turmoil to Sikh resentment against Congress.

The Akali Dal was defeated in the 1972 Punjab elections. To regain public appeal, the party put forward the Anandpur Sahib Resolution in 1973 to demand radical devolution of power and further autonomy to Punjab. The resolution document included both religious and political issues, asking for the recognition of Sikhism as a religion separate from Hinduism, as well as the transfer of Chandigarh and certain other areas to Punjab. It also demanded that power be radically devolved from the central to state governments.

The document was largely forgotten for some time after its adoption until gaining attention in the following decade. In 1982, the Akali Dal and Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale joined hands to launch the Dharam Yudh Morcha in order to implement the resolution. Thousands of people joined the movement, feeling that it represented a real solution to such demands as larger shares of water for irrigation and the return of Chandigarh to Punjab.

===Emergence in the diaspora===
According to the &#x27;events outside India&#x27; narrative, particularly after 1971, the notion of a sovereign and independent state of Khalistan began to get popularized among Sikhs in North America and Europe. One such account is provided by the Khalistan Council which had moorings in West London, where the Khalistan movement is said to have been launched in 1970.

Davinder Singh Parmar migrated to London in 1954. According to Parmar, his first pro-Khalistan meeting was attended by less than 20 people and he was labelled as a madman, receiving only one person&#x27;s support. Parmar continued his efforts despite the lack of following, eventually raising the Khalistani flag in Birmingham in the 1970s. In 1969, two years after losing the Punjab Assembly elections, Indian politician Jagjit Singh Chohan moved to the United Kingdom to start his campaign for the creation of Khalistan. Chohan&#x27;s proposal included Punjab, Himachal, Haryana, as well as some parts of Rajasthan.

Parmar and Chohan met in 1970 and formally announced the Khalistan movement at a London press conference, though being largely dismissed by the community as fanatical fringe without any support.

==== Chohan in Pakistan and US ====

Following the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, Chohan visited Pakistan as a guest of such leaders as Chaudhuri Zahoor Elahi. Visiting Nankana Sahib and several historical gurdwaras in Pakistan, Chohan utilized the opportunity to spread the notion of an independent Sikh state. Widely publicized by Pakistani press, the extensive coverage of his remarks introduced the international community, including those in India, to the demand of Khalistan for the first time. Though lacking public support, the term &quot;Khalistan&quot; became more and more recognizable. According to Chohan, during a talk with Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto of Pakistan, Bhutto had proposed to make Nankana Sahib the capital of Khalistan.

On 13 October 1971, visiting the United States at the invitation of his supporters in the Sikh diaspora, Chohan placed an advertisement in the &quot;New York Times&quot; proclaiming an independent Sikh state. Such promotion enabled him to collect millions of dollars from the diaspora, eventually leading to charges in India relating to sedition and other crimes in connection with his separatist activities.

==== Council of Khalistan ====
After returning to India in 1977, Chohan travelled to Britain in 1979. There, he would establish the Council of Khalistan, declaring its formation at Anandpur Sahib on 12 April 1980. Chohan designated himself as President of the Council and Balbir Singh Sandhu as its Secretary General.

In May 1980, Chohan travelled to London to announce the formation of Khalistan. A similar announcement was made in Amritsar by Sandhu, who released stamps and currency of Khalistan. Operating from a building termed &quot;Khalistan House&quot;, Chohan named a Cabinet and declared himself president of the &quot;Republic of Khalistan,&quot; issuing symbolic Khalistan &#x27;passports,&#x27; &#x27;postage stamps,&#x27; and &#x27;Khalistan dollars.&#x27; Moreover, embassies in Britain and other European countries were opened by Chohan. It is reported that, with the support of a wealthy Californian peach magnate, Chohan opened an Ecuadorian bank account to further support his operation. As well as maintaining contacts among various groups in Canada, the US, and Germany, Chohan kept in contact with the Sikh leader Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale who was campaigning for a theocratic Sikh homeland.

The globalized Sikh diaspora invested efforts and resources for Khalistan, but the Khalistan movement remained nearly invisible on the global political scene until the Operation Blue Star of June 1984.

====Operation Blue Star and impact====
In later disclosures from former special secretary G.B.S. Sidhu of the Research and Analysis Wing (R&amp;AW), the foreign-intelligence agency of India, R&amp;AW itself helped &quot;build the Khalistan legend,&quot; actively participating in the planning of Operation Blue Star. While posted in Ottawa, Canada in 1976 to look into the &quot;Khalistan problem&quot; among the Sikh diaspora, Sidhu found &quot;nothing amiss&quot; during the three years he was there, stating that &quot;Delhi was unnecessarily making a mountain of a molehill where none existed,&quot; that the agency created seven posts in West Europe and North America in 1981 to counter non-existent Khalistan activities, and that the deployed officers were &quot;not always familiar with the Sikhs or the Punjab issue.&quot; He described the secessionist movement as a &quot;chimera&quot; until the army operation, after which the insurgency would start.

According to a &quot;New York Times&quot; article written just a few weeks after the operation, &quot;Before the raid on the Golden Temple, neither the Government nor anyone else appeared to put much credence in the Khalistan movement. Mr. Bhindranwale himself said many times that he was not seeking an independent country for Sikhs, merely greater autonomy for Punjab within the Indian Union... One possible explanation advanced for the Government&#x27;s raising of the Khalistan question is that it needs to take every opportunity to justify the killing in Amritsar and the invasion of the Sikhs&#x27; holiest shrine.&quot;

Khushwant Singh had written that &quot;considerable Khalistan sentiment seems to have arisen since the raid on the temple, which many Sikhs, if not most, have taken as a deep offense to their religion and their sensibilities,&quot; referring to the drastic change in community sentiments after the army attack.

== Late 1970s to 1983 ==

===Delhi Asian Games (1982)===

The Akali leaders, having planned to announce a victory for Dharam Yudh Morcha, were outraged by the changes to the agreed-upon settlement. In November 1982, Akali leader Harchand Singh Longowal announced that the party would disrupt the 9th annual Asian Games by sending groups of Akali workers to Delhi to intentionally get arrested. Following negotiations between the Akali Dal and the government failed at the last moment due to disagreements regarding the transfer of areas between Punjab and Haryana.

Knowing that the Games would receive extensive coverage, Akali leaders vowed to overwhelm Delhi with a flood of protestors, aiming to heighten the perception of Sikh &quot;plight&quot; among the international audience. A week before the Games, Bhajan Lal, Chief Minister of Haryana and member of the INC party, responded by sealing the Delhi-Punjab border, and ordering all Sikh visitors travelling from to Delhi from Punjab to be frisked. While such measures were seen as discriminatory and humiliating by Sikhs, they proved effective as Akali Dal could only organize small and scattered protests in Delhi. Consequently, many Sikhs who did not initially support Akalis and Bhindranwale began sympathizing with the Akali Morcha.

Following the conclusion of the Games, Longowal organised a convention of Sikh veterans at the Darbar Sahib. It was attended by a large number of Sikh ex-servicemen, including Major General Shabeg Singh who subsequently became Bhindranwale&#x27;s military advisor.

== 1984 ==

===Increasing militant activity===
Widespread murders by followers of Bhindranwale occurred in 1980s&#x27; Punjab. Armed Khalistani militants of this period described themselves as &quot;kharku.&quot;

On its own, the year 1984 (from 1 January to 3 June) saw 775 violent incidents, resulting in 298 people killed and 525 injured.

Though it was common knowledge that those responsible for such bombings and murders were taking shelter in gurdwaras, the INC Government of India declared that it could not enter these places of worship, for the fear of hurting Sikh sentiments. Even as detailed reports on the open shipping of arms-laden trucks were sent to Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, the Government choose not to take action. Finally, following the murder of six Hindu bus passengers in October 1983, emergency rule was imposed in Punjab, which would continue for more than a decade.

=== Constitutional issues ===
The Akali Dal began more agitation in February 1984, protesting against Article 25, clause (2)(b), of the Indian Constitution, which ambiguously explains that &quot;the reference to Hindus shall be construed as including a reference to persons professing the Sikh, Jaina, or Buddhist religion,&quot; while also implicitly recognizing Sikhism as a separate religion: &quot;the wearing and carrying of kripans [&quot;sic&quot;] shall be deemed to be included in the profession of the Sikh religion.&quot; Even today, this clause is deemed offensive by many religious minorities in India due to its failure to recognise such religions separately under the constitution.

Members of the Akali Dal demanded that the removal of any ambiguity in the Constitution that refers to Sikhs as Hindu, as such prompts various concerns for the Sikh population, both in principle and in practice. For instance, a Sikh couple who would marry in accordance to the rites of their religion would have to register their union either under the &quot;Special Marriage Act, 1954&quot; or the &quot;Hindu Marriage Act, 1955&quot;. The Akalis demanded replacement of such rules with laws specific to Sikhism.

=== Operation Blue Star ===

Operation Blue Star was an Indian military operation ordered by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, between 1 and 8 June 1984, to remove militant religious leader Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale and his armed followers from the buildings of the Harmandir Sahib complex (aka the Golden Temple) in Amritsar, Punjabthe most sacred site in Sikhism.

In July 1983, Akali Dal President Harchand Singh Longowal had invited Bhindranwale to take up residence at the sacred temple complex, which the government would allege that Bhindranwale would later make into an armoury and headquarters for his armed uprising.

Since the inception of the Dharam Yudh Morcha to the violent events leading up to Operation Blue Star, Khalistani militants had directly killed 165 Hindus and Nirankaris, as well as 39 Sikhs opposed to Bhindranwale, while a total of 410 were killed and 1,180 injured as a result of Khalistani violence and riots.

As negotiations held with Bhindranwale and his supporters proved unsuccessful, Indira Gandhi ordered the Indian Army to launch Operation Blue Star. Along with the Army, the operation would involve Central Reserve Police Force, Border Security Force, and Punjab Police. Army units led by Lt. Gen. Kuldip Singh Brar (a Sikh), surrounded the temple complex on 3 June 1984. Just before the commencement of the operation, Lt. Gen. Brar addressed the soldiers:

However, none of the soldiers opted out, including many &quot;Sikh officers, junior commissioned officers and other ranks.&quot; Using a public address system, the Army repeatedly demanded the militants to surrender, asking them to at least allow pilgrims to leave the temple premises before commencing battle.

Nothing happened until 7:00 pm (IST). The Army, equipped with tanks and heavy artillery, had grossly underestimated the firepower possessed by the militants, who attacked with anti-tank and machine-gun fire from the heavily fortified Akal Takht, and who possessed Chinese-made, rocket-propelled grenade launchers with armour-piercing capabilities. After a 24-hour shootout, the army finally wrested control of the temple complex.

Bhindranwale was killed in the operation, while many of his followers managed to escape. Army casualty figures counted 83 dead and 249 injured, although Rajiv Gandhi would later admit that over 700 Indian soldiers died. According to the official estimate presented by the Indian Government, the event resulted in a combined total of 493 militant and civilian casualties, as well as the apprehension of 1592 individuals. Independent estimates say over 5,000 civilians and only 200 militants.

U.K. Foreign Secretary William Hague attributed high civilian casualties to the Indian Government&#x27;s attempt at a full frontal assault on the militants, diverging from the recommendations provided by the U.K. Military. Opponents of Gandhi also criticised the operation for its excessive use of force. Lieutenant General Brar later stated that the Government had &quot;no other recourse&quot; due to a &quot;complete breakdown&quot; of the situation: state machinery was under the militants&#x27; control, declaration of Khalistan was imminent, and Pakistan would have come into the picture declaring its support for Khalistan.

Nonetheless, the operation did not crush Khalistani militancy, as it continued.

According to the Mitrokhin Archive, in 1982 the Soviets used a recruit in the New Delhi residency named &quot;Agent S&quot; who was close to Indira Gandhi as a major channel for providing her disinformation regarding Khalistan. Agent S provided Indira Gandhi with false documents purporting to show Pakistani involvement to create religious disturbances and allegedly initiate a Khalistan conspiracy. After Rajiv Gandhi&#x27;s visit to Moscow in 1983, the Soviets persuaded him that the US was engaged in secret support for the Sikhs. By 1984, according to Mitrokhin, the disinformation the Soviets provided had influenced Indira Gandhi to pursue Operation Blue Star.

=== Assassination of Indira Gandhi and anti-Sikh riots ===

On the morning of 31 October 1984, Indira Gandhi was assassinated in New Delhi by her two personal security guards Satwant Singh and Beant Singh, both Sikhs, in retaliation for Operation Blue Star. The assassination triggered the 1984 anti-Sikh riots across North India. While the ruling party, Indian National Congress (INC), maintained that the violence was due to spontaneous riots, its critics have alleged that INC members themselves had planned a pogrom against the Sikhs.

The Nanavati Commission, a special commission created to investigate the riots, concluded that INC leaders (including Jagdish Tytler, H. K. L. Bhagat, and Sajjan Kumar) had directly or indirectly taken a role in the rioting incidents. Union Minister Kamal Nath was accused of leading riots near Rakab Ganj, but was cleared due to lack of evidence. Other political parties strongly condemned the riots. Two major civil-liberties organisations issued a joint report on the anti-Sikh riots, naming 16 significant politicians, 13 police officers, and 198 others, accused by survivors and eyewitnesses.

== 1985 to present day ==

=== 1985 ===

====Rajiv-Longowal Accord====

Many Sikh and Hindu groups, as well as organisations not affiliated to any religion, have attempted to establish peace between the Khalistan proponents and the Government of India. Akalis continued to witness radicalization of Sikh politics, fearing disastrous consequences. In response, President Harchand Singh Longowal reinstated the head of the Akali Dal and pushed for a peace initiative that reiterated the importance of Hindu-Sikh amity, condemning Sikh extremist violence, therefore declaring that the Akali Dal was not in favor of Khalistan.

In 1985, the Government of India attempted to seek a political solution to the grievances of the Sikhs through the Rajiv-Longowal Accord, which took place between Longowal and Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. The Accordrecognizing the religious, territorial, and economic demands of the Sikhs that were thought to be non-negotiable under Indira Gandhi&#x27;s tenureagreed to establish commissions and independent tribunals in order to resolve the Chandigarh issue and the river dispute, laying the basis for Akali Dal&#x27;s victory in the coming elections.

Though providing a basis for a return to normality, Chandigarh evidently remained an issue and the agreement was denounced by Sikh militants who refused to give up the demand for an independent Khalistan. These extremists, who were left unappeased, reacted by assassinating Longowal. Such behavior lead to the dismissal of negotiations, whereby both Congress and the Akali parties accused each other of aiding terrorism.

The Indian Government pointed to the involvement of a &quot;foreign hand,&quot; referring to Pakistan&#x27;s abetting of the movement. Punjab noted to the Indian Government that militants were able to obtain sophisticated arms through sources outside the country and by developing links with sources within the country. As such, the Government believed that large illegal flows of arms were flowing through the borders of India, with Pakistan being responsible for trafficking arms. India claimed that Pakistan provided sanctuary, arms, money, and moral support to the militants, though most of the accusations were based on circumstantial evidence.

====Air India Flight 182====
Air India Flight 182 was an Air India flight operating on the Montréal-London-Delhi-Bombay route. On 23 June 1985, a Boeing 747 operating on the route was blown up by a bomb mid-air off the coast of Ireland. A total of 329 people aboard were killed, 268 Canadian citizens, 27 British citizens and 24 Indian citizens, including the flight crew. On the same day, an explosion due to a luggage bomb was linked to the terrorist operation and occurred at the Narita Airport in Tokyo, Japan, intended for Air India Flight 301, killing two baggage handlers. The entire event was inter-continental in scope, killing 331 people in total and affected five countries on different continents: Canada, the United Kingdom, India, Japan, and Ireland.

The main suspects in the bombing were members of a Sikh separatist group called the Babbar Khalsa, and other related groups who were at the time agitating for a separate Sikh state of Khalistan in Punjab, India. In September 2007, the Canadian Commission of Inquiry investigated reports, initially disclosed in the Indian investigative news magazine &quot;Tehelka&quot;, that a hitherto unnamed person, Lakhbir Singh Rode, had masterminded the explosions. However, in conclusion two separate Canadian inquiries officially determined that the mastermind behind the terrorist operation was in fact the Canadian, Talwinder Singh Parmar.

Several men were arrested and tried for the Air India bombing. Inderjit Singh Reyat, a Canadian national and member of the International Sikh Youth Federation who pleaded guilty in 2003 to manslaughter, would be the only person convicted in the case. He was sentenced to fifteen years in prison for assembling the bombs that exploded on board Air India Flight 182 and at Narita Airport.

=== Late 1980s ===

In 1986, when the insurgency was at its peak, the Golden Temple was again occupied by militants belonging to the All India Sikh Students Federation and Damdami Taksal. The militants called an assembly (Sarbat Khalsa) and, on 26 January, they passed a resolution (&quot;gurmattā&quot;) in favour of the creation of Khalistan. However, only the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) had the authority to appoint the &quot;jathedar&quot;, the supreme religio-temporal seat of the Sikhs. The militants thus dissolved the SGPC and appointed their own jathedar, who turned out to refuse their bidding as well. Militant leader Gurbachan Singh Manochahal thereby appointed himself by force.

On 29 April 1986, an assembly of separatist Sikhs at the Akal Takht made a declaration of an independent state of Khalistan, and a number of rebel militant groups in favour of Khalistan subsequently waged a major insurgency against the Government of India. A decade of violence and conflict in Punjab would follow before a return to normality in the region. This period of insurgency saw clashes of Sikh militants with the police, as well as with the Nirankaris, a mystical Sikh sect who are less conservative in their aims to reform Sikhism.

The Khalistani militant activities manifested in the form of several attacks, such as the 1987 massacre of 32 Hindu bus passengers near Lalru, and the 1991 killing of 80 train passengers in Ludhiana. Such activities continued on into the 1990s as the perpetrators of the 1984 riots remained unpunished, while many Sikhs also felt that they were being discriminated against and that their religious rights were being suppressed.

In the parliamentary elections of 1989, Sikh separatist representatives were victorious in 10 of Punjab&#x27;s 13 national seats and had the most popular support. The Congress cancelled those elections and instead hosted a Khaki election. The separatists boycotted the poll. The voter turnout was 24%. The Congress won this election and used it to further its anti-separatist campaign. Most of the separatist leadership was wiped out and the moderates were suppressed by end of 1993.

=== 1990s ===
Indian security forces suppressed the insurgency in the early 1990s, while Sikh political groups such as the Khalsa Raj Party and SAD (A) continued to pursue an independent Khalistan through non-violent means. Whereas to take iron from the terrorists in the village Bhikhiwind, district Tarn Taran &#x27;Sandhu&#x27; family fought everyday like the last day and defeated terrorists several times. One such incident was on 30 September 1990, when about 200 terrorists attacked Balwinder Singh&#x27;s house. In retaliation, the Sandhu family using weapons provided by state police killed several and compiled the rest of the terrorists to run away. The Family awarded the Shaurya Chakra to show most conspicuous bravery, indomitable courage.

In August 1991, Julio Ribeiro, then-Indian Ambassador to Romania, was attacked and wounded at Bucharest in an assassination attempt by gunmen identified as Punjabi Sikhs. Sikh groups also claimed responsibility for the 1991 kidnapping of Liviu Radu, the Romanian chargé d&#x27;affaires in New Delhi. This appeared to be in retaliation for Romanian arrests of Khalistan Liberation Force members suspected of the attempted assassination of Ribeiro. Radu was released unharmed after Sikh politicians criticised the action.

In October 1991, the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that violence had increased sharply in the months leading up to the kidnapping, with Indian security forces or Sikh militants killing 20 or more people per day, and that the militants had been &quot;gunning down&quot; family members of police officers. Scholar Ian Talbot states that all sides, including the Indian Army, police and the militants, committed crimes like murder, rape and torture.

From 24 January 1993 to 4 August 1993, Khalistan was a member of the NGO Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization. The membership was permanently suspended on 22 January 1995.

On 31 August 1995, Chief Minister Beant Singh was killed in a suicide bombing, for which the pro-Khalistan group Babbar Khalsa claimed responsibility. Security authorities, however, reported the group&#x27;s involvement to be doubtful. A 2006 press release by the Embassy of the United States in New Delhi indicated that the responsible organisation was the Khalistan Commando Force.

While the militants enjoyed some support among Sikh separatists in the earlier period, this support gradually disappeared. The insurgency weakened the Punjab economy and led to an increase in violence in the state. With dwindling support and increasingly-effective Indian security troops eliminating anti-state combatants, Sikh militancy effectively ended by the early 1990s.

=== 2000s ===

==== Retribution ====
There have been serious charges levelled by human rights activists against Indian Security forces (headed by Sikh police officer, K. P. S. Gill), claiming that thousands of suspects were killed in staged shootouts and thousands of bodies were cremated/disposed of without proper identification or post-mortems. Human Rights Watch reported that, since 1984, government forces had resorted to widespread human rights violations to fight the militants, including: arbitrary arrest, prolonged detention without trial, torture, and summary executions of civilians and suspected militants. Family members were frequently detained and tortured to reveal the whereabouts of relatives sought by the police. Amnesty International has alleged several cases of disappearances, torture, rape, and unlawful detentions by the police during the Punjab insurgency, for which 75–100 police officers had been convicted by December 2002.

==== 2010s ====
Activities in the 2010s by Khalistani militants include the Tarn Taran blast, in which a police crackdown arrested 4 terrorists, one of whom revealed they were ordered by Sikhs for Justice to kill multiple Dera leaders in India. Pro-Khalistan organisations such as Dal Khalsa are also active outside India, supported by a section of the Sikh diaspora. As of 25 December, there also have been inputs by multiple agencies about a possible attack in Punjab by Babbar Khalsa and Khalistan Zindabad Force, according to Indian Media sources, are allegedly in contact with their Pakistani handlers and are trying to smuggle arms across the border.

In November 2015, a congregation of the Sikh community (i.e. a Sarbat Khalsa) was called in response to recent unrest in the Punjab region. The Sarbat Khalsa adopted 13 resolutions to strengthen Sikh institutions and traditions. The 12th resolution reaffirmed the resolutions adopted by the Sarbat Khalsa in 1986, including the declaration of the sovereign state of Khalistan.

Moreover, signs in favour of Khalistan were raised when SAD (Amritsar) President Simranjeet Singh Mann met with Surat Singh Khalsa, who was admitted to Dayanand Medical College &amp; Hospital (DMCH). While Mann was arguing with ACP Satish Malhotra, supporters standing at the main gate of DMCH raised Khalistan signs in the presence of heavy police force. After a confrontation with the police authorities that lasted about 15–20 minutes, Mann was allowed to meet Khalsa along with ADCP Paramjeet Singh Pannu.

Maintaining persistent connection their culture and religion, the Sikh diaspora outside India is seen increasingly supporting the movement by means of financial support, propaganda and political lobbying in the countries they reside and taking a prominent role in driving the movement. Emboldened by expansive political and financial ties, the Diaspora has used gurudwaras, among other available establishments as such, to disperse financial and diplomatic aid to the movement in Punjab and modern communication modes such as the internet and social media to rally support for it.

Recently, many signs have been raised in several places in support of the Khalistan movement, although the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB) reports that Sikhs who support Khalistan may themselves be detained and tortured. Notably, on the 31st anniversary of Operation Bluestar, pro-Khalistan signs were raised in Punjab, resulting in 25 Sikh youths being detained by police. Pro-Khalistan signs were also raised during a function of Punjabi Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal. Two members of SAD-A, identified as Sarup Singh Sandha and Rajindr Singh Channa, raised pro-Khalistan and anti-Badal signs during the chief minister&#x27;s speech.

In retrospect, the Khalistan movement has failed to reach its objectives in India due to several reasons:
* Heavy Police crackdown on the separatists under the leadership of Punjab Police chief KPS Gill. Several militant leaders were killed and others surrendered and rehabilitated.
* Gill credits the decline to change in the policies by adding provision for an adequate number of police and security forces to deal with the militancy. The clear political will from the government without any interference.
* Lack of a clear political concept of &#x27;Khalistan&#x27; even to the extremist supporters. As per Kumar (1997), the name which was wishful thinking only represented their revulsion against the Indian establishment and did not find any alternative to it.
* In the later stages of the movement, militants lacked an ideological motivation.
* The entry of criminals and government loyalists into its ranks further divided the groups.
* Loss of sympathy and support from the Sikh population of Punjab.
* The divisions among the Sikhs also undermined this movement. According to Pettigrew non-Jat urban Sikhs did not want to live in a country of &quot;Jatistan.&quot; Further division was caused as the people in the region traditionally preferred police and military service as career options. The Punjab Police had a majority of Jat Sikhs and the conflict was referred as &quot;Jat against Jat&quot; by Police Chief Gill.
* Moderate factions of Akali Dal led by Prakash Singh Badal reclaimed the political positions in the state through all three assembly (namely parliamentary) and SGPC elections. The dominance of traditional political parties was reasserted over the militant-associated factions.
* The increased vigilance by security forces in the region against rise of separatist elements.
* The confidence building measures adopted by the Sikh community helped in rooting out the Khalistan movement.

Simrat Dhillon (2007), writing for the Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies, noted that while a few groups continued to fight, &quot;the movement has lost its popular support both in India and within the Diaspora community.&quot;

==== 2020s ====

In 2021, the secessionist group, Sikhs for Justice (SFJ), began an unofficial, non binding, ongoing &quot;referendum&quot; regarding the potential creation of a Khalistan state which would include the entire states of Punjab, Haryana, and Himachal Pradesh, and several districts of other Indian states. Numerous referendum votes have been held in various locations including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Italy, England, and the United States. Hundreds of thousands of Sikhs have partaken in these votes according to various news reports. 

During a Khalistan referendum vote held in Melbourne, Australia in January 2023 , two separate brawls broke out between Khalistan supporters and pro-India demonstrators, leading to two people being injured and two Sikh men being arrested. The Victoria Police Department issued statements afterwards:“During the fight, flag poles were used by several men as weapons which caused physical injuries to multiple victims in which two victims were treated at the scene by paramedics” and “As a result of each incident a 34-year-old man and a 39-year-old man were arrested, and each issued with a penalty notice for riotous behaviour.” Australia&#x27;s High Commissioner to India Barry O&#x27;Farrell condemned the incident.

In February 2022, Deepak Punj, a Brampton radio host and a vocal critic of the Khalistan movement, was assaulted by three belligerent men who warned him &quot;against speaking about Deep Sidhu and Khalistan&quot;. In a statement to &quot;The Globe and Mail,&quot; Punj claimed &quot;one of them pulled a gun on me, and the other hit me on the head with a beer bottle&quot;. Brampton Mayor Patrick Brown condemned the attack, stating &quot;no one in the media should face violence or intimidation.&quot; Peel Police subsequently launched an investigation.

In August 2022, Amritpal Singh, a self styled radical Indian preacher, came to prominence after being appointed as the head of Waris Punjab De (a Sikh political organization which lent support to pro-Khalistan figures and groups) immediately after Deep Sidhu&#x27;s death (a succession described as illegitimate by the relatives and some associates of Sidhu). He subsequently embarked on a campaign and numerous preaching tours advocating for the creation of Khalistan and for Sikhs to receive baptism, imbibe religious austerities, and to shun drugs and other vices. He glorified the use of violence and weapons during public events. On 18 March 2023, Indian authorities initiated a crackdown on Waris Punjab De, alleging the organization&#x27;s involvement in attempted murder, attacks on police personnel, and spreading disharmony in Punjab. An extensive manhunt for Singh ensued, who absconded and managed to evade police capture for 35 days. He was arrested on 23 April 2023.

Numerous protests, particularly among diaspora Sikhs, occurred in the aftermath of the Indian police&#x27;s manhunt for Singh. While many transpired without incident, numerous violent attacks were reported in various locations. A mob of protesters attacked the Indian consulate in San Francisco, another mob attacked the Indian High Commission office in London and attempted to pull down the Indian flag off a pole, broke windows, and inflicted minor injuries on security staff. The NIA claimed that a group of protesters in San Francisco were exhorted to kill all representatives of the Indian government. On 21 March 2023, two men poured flammable material in the entrance of the consulate and attempted to set the San Francisco consulate on fire. In Washington, Khalistan supporters verbally intimidated and physically assaulted an Indian journalist covering the protests. In a Surrey protest, Sameer Kaushal, a journalist, was allegedly assaulted and harassed by Khalistan supporters. In the aftermath of the Surrey protest, Surrey RCMP spokesperson Cpl. Vanessa Munn confirmed police were investigating alleged assault involving a different victim and that the RCMP was seeking witnesses and video evidence. She stated “There is an assault investigation into the assault of one person who was in the crowd and did appear to be swarmed and assaulted by multiple people”. The Indian Ambassador to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu was threatened with assassination by Khalistanis.

On 18 June 2023, Hardeep Singh Nijjar was shot dead in the parking lot of a Sikh temple in Surrey, British Columbia. Nijjar was allegedly the head of two pro-Khalistan organisations in Canada, and had been accused by the Indian Government of orchestrating targeted killings in India, for which it unsuccessfully sought his extradition. 

On 2 July 2023, Khalistani supporters set the Indian consulate in San Francisco on fire. The arson attempt was promptly suppressed by the San Francisco Fire Department, resulting in limited damage to the building and no injuries to the staffers present. The incident was condemned by the State Department&#x27;s spokesman Matthew Miller. A video of the incident was released on Twitter by Khalistani supporters, suggesting the attack was retaliation for the recent death of Hardeep Singh Nijjar. Nijjar&#x27;s death sparked protests among sections of the Sikh diaspora; posters promoting these events alleged that Indian diplomats played a role in the death. The posters were condemned by Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Melanie Joly who assured the safety of Indian diplomats and buildings. 

According to a &quot;Globe and Mail&quot; report published one year after Nijjar&#x27;s death, some Canadian security officials did not believe there was sufficient evidence to arrest Nijjar, and accused Indian intelligence officials of &quot;having a reputation for torqueing evidence to fit with political objectives&quot;. However, the report also stated that interviews with Nijjar&#x27;s associates and his own disclosures, revealed that &quot;he was steeped in Sikh extremism&quot;, made speeches calling for violence against Indian adversaries, had relations with the architects of the 1995 assassination of Punjab&#x27;s chief minister Beant Singh, was photographed in Pakistan with an AK-47 and had a close relationship with Jagtar Singh Tara — head of the Babbar Khalsa International and other militant outfits, had &quot;underworld associates&quot; and relations with members of the Khalistan Tiger Force, and led several men in weapons, GPS, and target practice in Lower Mainland BC. 

On 1 September 2024, the organization, Sikhs for Justice, held a rally in Toronto. Floats within the parade glorified Dilawar Singh Babbar, a suicide bomber affiliated with Babbar Khalsa International (a banned organization in Canada), who killed former Punjab chief minister Beant Singh and numerous other bystanders. A sign at the rally read &quot;Beanta Bombed to Death&quot;. SFJ described Babbar as a &quot;human bomb&quot;. SFJ&#x27;s general counsel in a statement said:&quot;We are all offspring of Dilawar. At that time in 1995, the choice of weapon was a bomb, but we have choice of ballot today.” Some attendees chanted &quot;Kill India&quot; at the rally.

In October 2024, Rishi Nagar, a Canadian radio host of &quot;Calgary Red FM&quot;, reported on an incident at Gurdwara Dashmesh Culture Centre, a Sikh temple in Calgary, in which two men were arrested on various firearms related charges, including unauthorized possession of a firearm and pointing a firearm; multiple guns were seized by the police at the site. Following the report, Nagar was assaulted by two men. The attack left Nagar with severe injuries to his eye. Nagar attributed the assault to Khalistani elements stating “The pro-Khalistan people attacked me” . Calgary Police&#x27;s Staff Sergeant John Guigon described the assault as “particularly troubling to us when a member of the media gets attacked in a democracy”. &quot;Calgary Red FM&quot; stated that Nagar &quot;faced some blowback for his opposition to the Khalistan movement&quot;. Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre and Alberta premier Danielle Smith condemned the attack.

Chandra Arya, a Canadian Liberal MP, denounced attacks on journalists perpetrated by Khalistan supporters. In the House of Commons, he criticized the attacks on Nagar, Punj, and Kaushal. Arya further stated “I call on law enforcement agencies to take notice of Khalistani extremism with all seriousness it deserves.” Mocha Bezirgan, a journalist, has also received death threats for his coverage on Khalistani extremism.

In November 2024, Khalistani demonstrators attacked people outside the Hindu Sabha Mandir in Brampton with flag poles and sticks. In a video circulated in social media, individuals holding pro-Khalistan flags were seen running into the temple property and striking people within their vicinity. Justin Trudeau, Pierre Poilievre, and Jagmeet Singh, along with other Canadian politicians, condemned the incident. As a result of the violence, Brampton Mayor Patrick Brown announced he that he intended to introduce a motion at city council to prohibit protests outside places of worship in Brampton. An off duty Peel Police sergeant Harinder Sohi was suspended from duty for participating in the protest. Sohi was filmed holding a Khalistan flag outside the temple. In another social media post, a police officer was seen charging at a temple-goer and punching him, seemingly without provocation. The &quot;Toronto Star&quot; reached out to Peel Police who claimed they were aware of the video and &quot;looking into it&quot;. Prior to the melee at the temple, the Indian consulate announced a visit to the temple to assist elderly members of the Indian diaspora with their pensions and to them issue life certificates. Most beneficiaries of the consular service were Sikh diaspora members. Sikhs for Justice subsequently began a protest, alleging the Indian consulate intended to spy on Sikhs and collect intelligence on the separatist movement. Inderjeet Singh Gosal, Sikhs for Justice Khalistan Referendum co-ordinator for Canada, who organized the protest stated: &quot;This is not a Hindu and Sikh battle. This is strictly Sikhs versus the Indian government [...] Any place they (consular officials) go, we’ve been protesting there.&quot; Gosal was arrested on 8 November 2024 and charged with assault with a weapon. 

===== Electoral performance of pro-Khalistan parties and candidates =====

In the 2022 Punjab Legislative Assembly election, the Shiromani Akali Dal (Amritsar), a splinter group of the Shiromani Akali Dal, and the only pro Khalistan party in India, contested 81 out of the 117 seats in the Punjab Legislative Assembly and received 386,176 votes or 2.48% of the vote share. SAD(A) received 49,260 votes (0.3% of the vote share) in the 2017 Legislative Assembly election. 

Simranjit Singh Mann, head of the SAD(A), won the Sangrur Lok Sabha by-election held in June 2022, receiving 253,154 votes in the constituency or 35.61% of the vote share. However, Mann went on to lose the 2024 Sangrur Lok Sabha election, receiving 187,246 votes or 18.55% of the vote share.

In the 2024 Indian general election in Punjab, thirteen parliamentary constituencies were contested. Two MP candidates associated with the Khalistan movement, Amritpal Singh and Sarabjeet Singh Khalsa, won in their respective constituencies and were subsequently elected as Indian Members of Parliament. SAD(A) ran candidates in 12 out of 13 constituencies, but did not win any race. They received over 500,000 votes in the election. 
== Militancy ==
During the late 1980s and the early 1990s, there was a dramatic rise in radical State militancy in Punjab. The 1984 military Operation Blue Star in the Golden Temple in Amritsar offended many Sikhs. The separatists used this event, as well as the following 1984 anti-Sikh riots, to claim that the interest of Sikhs was not safe in India and to foster the spread of militancy among Sikhs in Punjab. Some sections of the Sikh diaspora also began join the separatists with financial and diplomatic support.

A section of Sikhs turned to militancy in Punjab and several Sikh militant outfits proliferated in the 1980s and 1990s. Some militant groups aimed to create an independent state through acts of violence directed at members of the Indian government, army, or forces. A large numbers of Sikhs condemned the actions of the militants. According to anthropological analysis, one reason young men had for joining militant and other religious nationalist groups was for fun, excitement, and expressions of masculinity. Puri, Judge, and Sekhon (1999) suggest that illiterate/under-educated young men, lacking enough job prospects, had joined pro-Khalistan militant groups for the primary purpose of &quot;fun.&quot; They mention that the pursuit of Khalistan itself was the motivation for only 5% of &quot;militants.&quot;

=== Militant groups ===

There are several militant Sikh groups, such as the Khalistan Council, that are currently functional and provides organization and guidance to the Sikh community. Multiple groups are organized across the world, coordinating their military efforts for Khalistan. Such groups were most active in 1980s and early 1990s, and have since receded in activity. These groups are largely defunct in India but they still have a political presence among the Sikh diaspora, especially in countries such as Pakistan where they are not proscribed by law.

Most of these outfits were crushed by 1993 during the counter-insurgency operations. In recent years, active groups have included Babbar Khalsa, International Sikh Youth Federation, Dal Khalsa, and Bhindranwale Tiger Force. An unknown group before then, the Shaheed Khalsa Force claimed credit for the marketplace bombings in New Delhi in 1997. The group has never been heard of since.

Major pro-Khalistan militant outfits include:
* Babbar Khalsa International (BKI)
** Listed as a terrorist organisation in the European Union, Canada, India, and UK.
** Included in the Terrorist Exclusion List of the U.S. Government in 2004.
** Designated by the US and the Canadian courts for the bombing of Air India Flight 182 on 27 June 2002.
* Bhindranwala Tiger Force of Khalistan (BTFK; aka Bhindranwale Tiger Force, BTF)
** This group appears to have been formed in 1984 by Gurbachan Singh Manochahal.
** Seems to have disbanded or integrated into other organisations after the death of Manochahal.
** Listed in 1995 as one of the 4 &quot;major militant groups&quot; in the Khalistan movement.
* Khalistan Commando Force (KCF)
** Formed by the Sarbat Khalsa in 1986. It does not figure in the list of terrorist organisations declared by the U.S. Department of State (DOS).
** According to the DOS and the Assistant Inspector General of the Punjab Police Intelligence Division, the KCF was responsible for the deaths of thousands in India, including the 1995 assassination of Chief Minister Beant Singh.
* Khalistan Liberation Army (KLA)
** Reputed to have been a wing of, associated with, or a breakaway group of the Khalistan Liberation Force.
* Khalistan Liberation Force
** Formed in 1986
** Believed to be responsible for several bombings of civilian targets in India during the 1980s and 1990s, sometimes in conjunction with Islamist Kashmir separatists.
* Khalistan Zindabad Force (KZF)
** Listed as a terrorist organisation by the EU.
** Last major suspected activity was a bomb blast in 2006 at the Inter-State Bus Terminus in Jalandhar.
* International Sikh Youth Federation (ISYF), based in the United Kingdom.
* All India Sikh Students Federation (AISSF)
* Dashmesh Regiment
* Shaheed Khalsa Force

=== Abatement ===

The U.S. Department of State found that Sikh extremism had decreased significantly from 1992 to 1997, although a 1997 report noted that &quot;Sikh militant cells are active internationally and extremists gather funds from overseas Sikh communities.&quot;

In 1999, Kuldip Nayar, writing for Rediff.com, stated in an article, titled &quot;It is fundamentalism again&quot;, that the Sikh &quot;masses&quot; had rejected terrorists.
By 2001, Sikh extremism and the demand for Khalistan had all but abated.

Reported in his paper, titled &quot;From Bhindranwale to Bin Laden: Understanding Religious Violence&quot;, Director Mark Juergensmeyer of the Orfalea Centre for Global &amp; International Studies, UCSB, interviewed a militant who said that &quot;the movement is over,&quot; as many of his colleagues had been killed, imprisoned, or driven into hiding, and because public support was gone.

== Outside of India ==
Operation Blue Star and its violent aftermaths popularized the demand for Khalistan among many Sikhs dispersed globally. Involvement of sections of Sikh diaspora turned out to be important for the movement as it provided the diplomatic and financial support. It also enabled Pakistan to become involved in the fueling of the movement. Sikhs in UK, Canada and USA arranged for cadres to travel to Pakistan for military and financial assistance. Some Sikh groups abroad even declared themselves as the Khalistani government in exile.

Sikh places of worship, gurdwaras, provided the geographic and institutional coordination for the Sikh community. Sikh political factions have used the gurdwaras as a forum for political organization. The gurdwaras sometimes served as the site for mobilization of diaspora for Khalistan movement directly by raising funds. Indirect mobilization was sometimes provided by promoting a stylized version of conflict and Sikh history. The rooms in some gurdwara exhibit pictures of Khalistani leaders along with paintings of martyrs from Sikh history.

Gurdwaras also host speakers and musical groups that promote and encourage the movement. Among the diasporas, Khalistan issue has been a divisive issue within gurdwaras. These factions have fought over the control of gurdwaras and their political and financial resources. The fights between pro and anti-Khalistan factions over gurdwaras often included violent acts and bloodshed as reported from UK and North America. The gurdwaras with Khalistani leadership allegedly funnel the collected funds into activities supporting the movement.

Different groups of Sikhs in the diaspora organize the convention of international meetings to facilitate communication and establish organizational order. In April 1981 the first &quot;International Convention of Sikhs,&quot; was held in New York and was attended by some 200 delegates. In April 1987 the third convention was held in Slough, Berkshire where the Khalistan issue was addressed. This meeting&#x27;s objective was to &quot;build unity in the Khalistan movement.&quot;

All these factors further strengthened the emerging nationalism among Sikhs. Sikh organizations launched many fund-raising efforts that were used for several purposes. After 1984 one of the objectives was the promotion of the Sikh version of &quot;ethnonational history&quot; and the relationship with the Indian state. The Sikh diaspora also increased their efforts to build institutions to maintain and propagate their ethnonational heritage. A major objective of these educational efforts was to publicize a different face to the non-Sikh international community who regarded the Sikhs as &quot;terrorists&quot;.

In 1993, Khalistan was briefly admitted in the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization, but was suspended in a few months. The membership suspension was made permanent on 22 January 1995.

Edward T.G. Anderson, an associate professor in history, describes the Khalistan movement outside India as follows:

===Pakistan===
Pakistan has long aspired to dismember India through its &quot;Bleed India&quot; strategy. Even before the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, then a member of the military regime of General Yahya Khan, stated, &quot;Once the back of Indian forces is broken in the east, Pakistan should occupy the whole of Eastern India and make it a permanent part of East Pakistan... Kashmir should be taken at any price, even the Sikh Punjab and turned into Khalistan.&quot;

The Sikh separatist leader Jagjit Singh Chohan said that during his talks with Pakistani prime minister that Zulfikar Ali Bhutto affirmed &quot;we&#x27;ll help you and make it the capital of Khalistan&quot;; Bhutto wanted revenge over Bangladesh.

General Zia-ul Haq, who succeeded Bhutto as the Head of State, attempted to reverse the traditional antipathy between Sikhs and Muslims arising from the partition violence by restoring Sikh shrines in Pakistan and opening them for Sikh pilgrimage. The expatriate Sikhs from England and North America that visited these shrines were at the forefront of the calls for Khalistan. During the pilgrims&#x27; stay in Pakistan, the Sikhs were exposed to Khalistani propaganda, which would not be openly possible in India.

The ISI chief, General Abdul Rahman, opened a cell within ISI with the objective of supporting the &quot;[Sikhs&#x27;]...freedom struggle against India&quot;. Rahman&#x27;s colleagues in ISI took pride in the fact that &quot;the Sikhs were able to set the whole province on fire. They knew who to kill, where to plant a bomb and which office to target.&quot; General Hamid Gul argued that keeping Punjab destabilized was equivalent to the Pakistan Army having an extra division at no cost. Zia-ul Haq, on the other hand, consistently practised the art of plausible denial. The Khalistan movement was brought to a decline only after India fenced off a part of the Punjab border with Pakistan and the Benazir Bhutto government agreed to joint patrols of the border by Indian and Pakistani troops.

In 2006, an American court convicted Khalid Awan, a Muslim and Canadian of Pakistani descent, of &quot;supporting terrorism&quot; by providing money and financial services to the Khalistan Commando Force chief Paramjit Singh Panjwar in Pakistan. KCF members had carried out deadly attacks against Indian civilians causing thousands of deaths. Awan frequently travelled to Pakistan and was alleged by the U.S. officials to have links to Sikh and Muslim extremists, as well as Pakistani intelligence.

In 2008, India&#x27;s Intelligence Bureau indicated that Pakistan&#x27;s Inter-Services Intelligence organisation was trying to revive Sikh militancy.

=== United States ===
&quot;The New York Times&quot; reported in June 1984 that Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi conveyed to Helmut Schmidt and Willy Brandt, both of them being former Chancellors of West Germany, that United States&#x27; Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) was involved in causing unrest in Punjab. It also reported that &quot;The Indian Express&quot; quoted anonymous officials from India&#x27;s intelligence establishment as saying that the CIA &quot;masterminded&quot; a plan to support the acolytes of Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, who died during Operation Blue Star, by smuggling weapons for them through Pakistan. The United States embassy denied this report&#x27;s findings.

According to B. Raman, former Additional Secretary in the Cabinet Secretariat of India and a senior official of the Research and Analysis Wing, the United States initiated a plan in complicity with Pakistan&#x27;s General Yahya Khan in 1971 to support an insurgency for Khalistan in Punjab.

In 2023, the United States alleged a plot by the Indian government to assassinate the New York–based Sikh separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a spokesperson for the pro-Khalistan group Sikhs for Justice. On November 29, 2023, an Indian government employee was the target of an indictment in New York for their alleged role in the assassination plot.

===Canada===
Immediately after Operation Blue Star, authorities were unprepared for how quickly extremism spread and gained support in Canada, with extremists &quot;...threatening to kill thousands of Hindus by a number of means, including blowing up Air India flights.&quot; Canadian Member of Parliament Ujjal Dosanjh, a moderate Sikh, stated that he and others who spoke out against Sikh extremism in the 1980s faced a &quot;reign of terror&quot;.

On 18 November 1998, the Canada-based Sikh journalist Tara Singh Hayer was gunned down by suspected Khalistani militants. The publisher of the &quot;Indo-Canadian Times&quot;, a Canadian Sikh and once-vocal advocate of the armed struggle for Khalistan, he had criticised the bombing of Air India Flight 182, and was to testify about a conversation he overheard concerning the bombing. On 24 January 1995, Tarsem Singh Purewal, editor of Britain&#x27;s Punjabi-language weekly &quot;Des Pardes&quot;, was killed as he was closing his office in Southall. There is speculation that the murder was related to Sikh extremism, which Purewal may have been investigating. Another theory is that he was killed in retaliation for revealing the identity of a young rape victim.

Terry Milewski reported in a 2007 documentary for the CBC that a minority within Canada&#x27;s Sikh community was gaining political influence even while publicly supporting terrorist acts in the struggle for an independent Sikh state. In response, the World Sikh Organization of Canada (WSO), a Canadian Sikh human rights group that opposes violence and extremism, sued the CBC for &quot;defamation, slander, and libel&quot;, alleging that Milewski linked it to terrorism and damaged the reputation of the WSO within the Sikh community. In 2015, however, the WSO unconditionally abandoned &quot;any and all claims&quot; made in its lawsuit.

Canadian journalist Kim Bolan has written extensively on Sikh extremism. Speaking at the Fraser Institute in 2007, she reported that she still received death threats over her coverage of the 1985 Air India bombing.

In 2008, a CBC report stated that &quot;a disturbing brand of extremist politics has surfaced&quot; at some of the Vaisakhi and the Buddhist Vesak parades in Canada, and The Trumpet agreed with the CBC assessment. Two leading Canadian Sikh politicians refused to attend the parade in Surrey, saying it was a glorification of terrorism. In 2008, Dr. Manmohan Singh, Prime Minister of India, expressed his concern that there might be a resurgence of Sikh extremism.

There has been some controversy over Canada&#x27;s response to the Khalistan movement. After Amarinder Singh&#x27;s refusal to meet Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in 2017, calling him a &quot;Khalistani sympathizer&quot;, Singh ultimately met with Trudeau on 22 February 2018 over the issue. Trudeau assured Singh that his country would not support the revival of the separatist movement. Shiromani Akali Dal President Sukhbir Badal was quoted saying Khalistan is &quot;no issue, either in Canada or in Punjab&quot;.

A 2020 report by Canadian ex-journalist Terry Milewski criticized the Khalistan movement as driven by the Pakistani government, and as a threat to Canadian interests.

In September 2023, while speaking to the Canadian parliament, Justin Trudeau accused India of being involved in the slaying of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a prominent advocate of the Khalistan separatist movement who had been killed by masked gunmen in Surrey, British Columbia. Although Nijjar had been accused by India of having links to terrorism, India denied any involvement in his death. A subsequent diplomatic row followed, with both countries expelling multiple diplomatic staff in 2023 and 2024. Canada has not shared evidence of Indian involvement in the killing of Nijar, citing the need to protect sensitive intelligence sources and methods.

===United Kingdom===

In February 2008, BBC Radio 4 reported that the Chief of the Punjab Police, NPS Aulakh, alleged that militant groups were receiving money from the British Sikh community. The same report included statements that although the Sikh militant groups were poorly equipped and staffed, intelligence reports and interrogations indicated that Babbar Khalsa was sending its recruits to the same terrorist training camps in Pakistan used by Al Qaeda.

Lord Bassam of Brighton, then Home Office minister, stated that International Sikh Youth Federation (ISYF) members working from the UK had committed &quot;assassinations, bombings, and kidnappings&quot; and were a &quot;threat to national security.&quot;
The ISYF is listed in the UK as a &quot;Proscribed Terrorist Group&quot; but it has not been included in the list of terrorist organisations by the United States Department of State. It was also added to the US Treasury Department terrorism list on 27 June 2002.

Andrew Gilligan, reporting for the &quot;London Evening Standard&quot;, stated that the Sikh Federation (UK) is the &quot;successor&quot; of the ISYF, and that its executive committee, objectives, and senior members ... are largely the same.
The &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot; reported in February 2008 that Dabinderjit Singh was campaigning to have both the Babbar Khalsa and International Sikh Youth Federation de-listed as terrorist organisations. It also stated of Public Safety Minister Stockwell Day that &quot;he has not been approached by anyone lobbying to delist the banned groups&quot;. Day is also quoted as saying &quot;The decision to list organizations such as Babbar Khalsa, Babbar Khalsa International, and the International Sikh Youth Federation as terrorist entities under the Criminal Code is intended to protect Canada and Canadians from terrorism.&quot; There are claims of funding from Sikhs outside India to attract young people into these pro-Khalistan militant groups.

<doc id="154660" wikidata="Q193656" url="?curid=154660" title="Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston">
<text>Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston (20 October 1784 – 18 October 1865), known as Lord Palmerston, was a British statesman and politician who served as prime minister of the United Kingdom from 1855 to 1858 and from 1859 to 1865. A member of the Tory, Whig and Liberal parties, Palmerston was the first Liberal prime minister. He dominated British foreign policy from 1830 to 1865, when Britain stood at the height of its imperial power.

He held office almost continuously from 1807 until his death in 1865. He began his parliamentary career as a Tory, defected to the Whigs in 1830, and became the first prime minister from the newly formed Liberal Party in 1859. He was highly popular with the British public. David Brown argues that &quot;an important part of Palmerston&#x27;s appeal lay in his dynamism and vigour&quot;.

Temple succeeded to his father&#x27;s Irish peerage (which did not entitle him to a seat in the House of Lords, leaving him eligible to sit in the House of Commons) as the 3rd Viscount Palmerston in 1802. He became a Tory MP in 1807. From 1809 to 1828 he was Secretary at War, organising the finances of the army. He first attained Cabinet rank in 1827, when George Canning became prime minister, but he resigned from office one year later. He was Foreign Secretary 1830–1834, 1835–1841 and 1846–1851. In this office, Palmerston responded effectively to a series of conflicts in Europe.

In 1852, the Earl of Aberdeen formed a coalition government. The Peelites insisted that Lord John Russell be foreign secretary, forcing Palmerston to take the office of home secretary. As home secretary Palmerston enacted various social reforms, although he opposed electoral reform. When Aberdeen&#x27;s coalition fell in 1855 over its handling of the Crimean War, Palmerston was the only man able to sustain a majority in Parliament, and he became prime minister. He had two periods in office, 1855–1858 and 1859–1865, before his death at the age of 80 years, a few months after victory in a general election in which he had obtained an increased majority. Palmerston is considered to have been the &quot;first truly popular&quot; prime minister. He remains the most recent British prime minister to die in office.

Palmerston masterfully controlled public opinion by stimulating British nationalism. Although Queen Victoria and most of the political leadership distrusted him, he received and sustained the favour of the press and the populace, from whom he received the affectionate sobriquet &quot;Pam&quot;. Palmerston&#x27;s alleged weaknesses included mishandling of personal relations, and continual disagreements with the Queen over the royal role in determining foreign policy.

Historians rank Palmerston as one of the greatest foreign secretaries, due to his handling of great crises, his commitment to the balance of power (which provided Britain with decisive agency in many conflicts), and his commitment to British interests. His policies in relation to India, China, Italy, Belgium and Spain had extensive long-lasting beneficial consequences for Britain. However, Palmerston&#x27;s leadership during the Opium Wars was questioned and denounced by other prominent statesmen such as William Ewart Gladstone. The consequences of the conquest of India have been reconsidered by more recent scholarship weighing the burdens placed on India in colonial rule and British uncertainty on proper governance. The consequences of his policies towards France, the Ottoman Empire, and the United States proved more ephemeral.

==Early life: 1784–1806==

Henry John Temple was born in his family&#x27;s Westminster house to the Irish branch of the Temple family on 20 October 1784. His family derived their title from the Peerage of Ireland, although he rarely visited Ireland. His father was Henry Temple, 2nd Viscount Palmerston (1739–1802), an Anglo-Irish peer, and his mother was Mary (1752–1805), a daughter of Benjamin Mee, a London merchant. From 1792 to 1794, he accompanied his family on a long Continental tour. While in Italy, Palmerston acquired an Italian tutor, who taught him to speak and write fluent Italian. The family owned a huge country estate in the north of County Sligo in the northwest of Ireland.

He was educated at Harrow School (1795–1800). Admiral Sir Augustus Clifford, 1st Bt., was a fag to Palmerston, Viscount Althorp and Viscount Duncannon and later remembered Palmerston as by far the most merciful of the three. Temple was often engaged in school fights and fellow Old Harrovians remembered Temple as someone who stood up to bullies twice his size. Henry Temple&#x27;s father took him to the House of Commons in 1799, where the young Palmerston shook hands with the prime minister, William Pitt the Younger.

Temple was then at the University of Edinburgh (1800–1803), where he learnt political economy from Dugald Stewart, a friend of the Scottish philosophers Adam Ferguson and Adam Smith. Temple later described his time at Edinburgh as producing &quot;whatever useful knowledge and habits of mind I possess&quot;. Lord Minto wrote to the young Palmerston&#x27;s parents that Henry Temple was well-mannered and charming. Stewart wrote to a friend, saying of Temple: &quot;In point of temper and conduct he is everything his friends could wish. Indeed, I cannot say that I have ever seen a more faultless character at this time of life, or one possessed of more amiable dispositions.&quot;

Henry Temple succeeded his father to the title of Viscount Palmerston on 17 April 1802, before he had turned 18. He also inherited a vast country estate in the north of County Sligo in the west of Ireland. He later built Classiebawn Castle on this estate. Palmerston went to St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge (1803–1806). As a nobleman, he was entitled to take his MA without examinations, but Palmerston wished to obtain his degree through examinations. This was declined, although he was allowed to take the separate college examinations, where he obtained first-class honours.

After war was declared on France in 1803, Palmerston joined the Volunteers mustered to oppose a French invasion, being one of the three officers in the unit for St John&#x27;s College. He was also appointed Lieutenant-Colonel Commandant of the Romsey Volunteers. When the Volunteers were subsumed into the Local Militia, he commanded the South-West Hampshire Local Militia from March 1809 to April 1816. Based at Romsey the regiment assembled for two weeks&#x27; training each year.

==Early political career: 1806–1809==

In February 1806, Palmerston was defeated in the election for the University of Cambridge constituency. In November he was elected for Horsham but was unseated in January 1807, when the Whig majority in the Commons voted for a petition to unseat him.

Due to the patronage of Lord Chichester and Lord Malmesbury, Palmerston was given the post of Junior Lord of the Admiralty in the ministry of the Duke of Portland. He stood again for the Cambridge seat in May, but lost by three votes after he advised his supporters to vote for the other Tory candidate in the two-member constituency so as to ensure a Tory was elected.

Palmerston entered Parliament as Tory MP for the pocket borough of Newport on the Isle of Wight in June 1807.

On 3 February 1808, he spoke in support of confidentiality in the working of diplomacy, and of the bombardment of Copenhagen and the capture and destruction of the Royal Danish Navy by the Royal Navy in the Battle of Copenhagen. Denmark was neutral but Napoleon had recently agreed with the Russians in the Treaty of Tilsit to build a naval alliance against Britain, including using the Danish navy for invading Britain. Pre-empting this, the British offered Denmark the choice of temporarily handing over its navy until the war&#x27;s end or the destruction of their navy. The Danes refused to comply and so Copenhagen was bombarded. Palmerston justified the attack by peroration with reference to the ambitions of Napoleon to take control of the Danish fleet:

it is defensible on the ground that the enormous power of France enables her to coerce the weaker state to become an enemy of England... It is the law of self-preservation that England appeals for the justification of her proceedings. It is admitted by the honourable gentleman and his supporters, that if Denmark had evidenced any hostility towards this country, then we should have been justified in measures of retaliation... Denmark coerced into hostility stands in the same position as Denmark voluntarily hostile, when the law of self-preservation comes into play...Does anyone believe that Buonaparte will be restrained by any considerations of justice from acting towards Denmark as he has done towards other countries? ... England, according to that law of self-preservation which is a fundamental principle of the law of nations, is justified in securing, and therefore enforcing, from Denmark a neutrality which France would by compulsion have converted into an active hostility.

In a letter to a friend on 24 December 1807, he described the late Whig MP Edmund Burke as possessing &quot;the palm of political prophecy&quot;. This would become a metaphor for his own career in divining the course of imperial foreign policy.

==Secretary at War: 1809–1828==

Palmerston&#x27;s speech was so successful that Spencer Perceval, who formed his government in 1809, asked him to become Chancellor of the Exchequer, then a less important office than it was to become later. But Palmerston preferred the non-cabinet office of Secretary at War, charged exclusively with the financial business of the army. He served in that post for almost 20 years.

On 1 April 1818, a retired officer on half-pay, Lieutenant David Davies, who had a grievance about his application from the War Office for a pension and was also mentally ill, shot Palmerston as he walked up the stairs of the War Office. The bullet only grazed his back and the wound was slight. After learning of Davies&#x27; illness, Palmerston paid for his legal defence at the trial, and Davies was sent to Bethlem Royal Hospital.

After the suicide of Lord Castlereagh in 1822, Lord Liverpool, who was Prime Minister had to hold together the Tory Cabinet which began to split along political lines. The more liberal wing of the Tory government made some ground, with George Canning becoming Foreign Secretary and Leader of the House of Commons, William Huskisson advocating and applying the doctrines of free trade, and Catholic emancipation emerging as an open question. Although Palmerston was not in the Cabinet, he cordially supported the measures of Canning and his friends.

Upon the retirement of Lord Liverpool in April 1827, Canning was called to be prime minister. The more conservative Tories, including Sir Robert Peel, withdrew their support, and an alliance was formed between the liberal members of the late ministry and the Whigs. The post of Chancellor of the Exchequer was offered to Palmerston, who accepted it, but this appointment was frustrated by some intrigue between King George IV and John Charles Herries. Lord Palmerston remained Secretary at War, though he gained a seat in the cabinet for the first time. The Canning administration ended after only four months on the death of the Prime Minister, and was followed by the ministry of Lord Goderich, which barely survived the year.

The Canningites remained influential, and the Duke of Wellington hastened to include Palmerston, Huskisson, Charles Grant, William Lamb, and the Earl of Dudley in the government he subsequently formed. However, a dispute between Wellington and Huskisson over the issue of parliamentary representation for Manchester and Birmingham led to the resignation of Huskisson and his allies, including Palmerston. In the spring of 1828, after more than twenty years continuously in office, Palmerston found himself in opposition.

On 26 February 1828, Palmerston delivered a speech in favour of Catholic emancipation. He felt that it was unseemly to relieve the &quot;imaginary grievances&quot; of the Dissenters from the established church while at the same time &quot;real afflictions pressed upon the Catholics&quot; of Great Britain. Palmerston also supported parliamentary reform. One of his biographers has stated that: &quot;Like many Pittites, now labelled tories, he was a good whig at heart.&quot; The Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829 finally passed Parliament in 1829 when Palmerston was in the opposition. The Great Reform Act passed Parliament in 1832.

==Opposition: 1828–1830==
Following his move to opposition Palmerston appears to have focused closely on foreign policy. He had already urged Wellington into active interference in the Greek War of Independence, and he had made several visits to Paris, where he foresaw with great accuracy the impending overthrow of the Bourbons. On 1 June 1829 he made his first great speech on foreign affairs.
in September 1830, Wellington tried to induce Palmerston to re-enter the cabinet, but he refused to do so without Lord Lansdowne and Lord Grey, two notable Whigs. This can be said to be the point in 1830, when his party allegiance changed. In November 1830 he accepted an offer from Lord Grey to join his new government as Foreign Secretary.

==Foreign Secretary: 1830–1841==
Palmerston entered the office of Foreign Secretary with great energy and continued to exert his influence there for twenty years; he held it from 1830 to 1834 (his apprentice years), 1835 to 1841, and 1846 to 1851. Basically, Palmerston was responsible for the whole of British foreign policy from the time of the French and Belgian Revolutions of 1830 until December 1851. His abrasive style would earn him the nickname &quot;Lord Pumice Stone&quot;, and his manner of dealing with foreign governments who crossed him, especially in his later years, was the original &quot;gunboat diplomacy&quot;.

===Crises of 1830===
The Revolutions of 1830 gave a jolt to the settled European system that had been created in 1814–1815. The United Kingdom of the Netherlands was rent in half by the Belgian Revolution, the Kingdom of Portugal was the scene of civil war, and the Spanish were about to place an infant princess on the throne. Poland was in arms against the Russian Empire, while the northern powers (Russia, Prussia, and Austria) formed a closer alliance that seemed to threaten the peace and liberties of Europe. Polish exiles called on Britain to intervene against Russia during the November Uprising of 1830.

Palmerston&#x27;s overall policy was to safeguard British interests, maintain peace, keep the balance of power, and retain the status quo in Europe. He had no grievance against Russia and while he privately sympathised with the Polish cause, in his role as foreign minister he rejected Polish demands. With serious trouble simultaneously taking place in Belgium and Italy, and lesser issues in Greece and Portugal, he sought to de-escalate European tensions rather than aggravate them, favouring a policy of universal non-interventionism. He therefore focused chiefly on achieving a peaceful settlement of the crisis in Belgium.

===Belgium===
William I of the Netherlands appealed to the great powers that had placed him on the throne after the Napoleonic Wars to maintain his rights. The London Conference of 1830 was called to address this question. The British solution involved the independence of Belgium, which Palmerston believed would greatly contribute to the security of Britain, but any solution was not straightforward. On the one hand, the reactionary powers were anxious to defend William I; on the other, many Belgian revolutionaries, like Charles de Brouckère and Charles Rogier, supported the reunion of the Belgian provinces to France, whereas Britain favoured Dutch, not French influence, on an independent state.

The British policy which emerged was a close alliance with France, but one subject to the balance of power on the Continent, and in particular the preservation of Belgian independence. If the reactionary powers supported William I by force, they would encounter the resistance of France and Britain united in arms. If France sought to annex Belgium, it would forfeit the British alliance and find herself opposed by the whole of Europe. In the end the British policy prevailed. Although the continent had been close to war, peace was maintained on London&#x27;s terms and Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg, the widower of a British princess, was placed upon the throne of Belgium. Fishman says that the London Conference was &quot;an extraordinarily successful conference&quot; because it &quot;provided the institutional framework through which the leading powers of the time safeguarded the peace of Europe.&quot;

Thereafter, despite a Dutch invasion and French counter-invasion in 1831, France and Britain framed and signed a treaty settlement between Belgium and the Netherlands, inducing the three reactionary powers to accede to it as well; while in Palmerston&#x27;s second period of office, as his authority grew, he was able to finally settle relations between Belgium and Holland with a treaty in 1838–1839 - now asserting his (and British) independence by leaning rather more towards the Netherlands and the reactionary powers, and against the Belgium/French axis.

===France, Spain, and Portugal, 1830s===
In 1833 and 1834, the youthful Queens Isabella II of Spain and Maria II of Portugal were the representatives and the hope of the constitutional parties of their countries. Their positions were under some pressure from their absolutist kinsmen, Dom Miguel of Portugal and Don Carlos of Spain, who were the closest males in the lines of succession. Palmerston conceived and executed the plan of a Quadruple Alliance of the constitutional states (Britain, France, Spain &amp; Portugal) to serve as a counterpoise to the reactionary alliance. A treaty for the pacification of the Peninsula was signed in London on 22 April 1834 and, although the struggle was somewhat prolonged in Spain, it accomplished its objective.

France had been a reluctant party to the treaty, and never executed its role in it with much zeal. Louis Philippe was accused of secretly favouring the Carlists – the supporters of Don Carlos – and he rejected direct interference in Spain. It is probable that the hesitation of the French court on this question was one of the causes of the enduring personal hostility Palmerston showed towards the French king thereafter, though that sentiment may well have arisen earlier. Although Palmerston wrote in June 1834 that Paris was &quot;the pivot of my foreign policy&quot;, the differences between the two countries grew into a constant but sterile rivalry that brought benefit to neither.

===Balkans and Near East: defending Turkey, 1830s===
Palmerston was greatly interested by the Eastern question. During the Greek War of Independence he had energetically supported the Greek cause and backed the Treaty of Constantinople that gave Greece its independence. However, from 1830 the defence of the Ottoman Empire became one of the cardinal objects of his policy. He believed in the regeneration of Turkey, as he wrote to Henry Bulwer (Lord Dalling): &quot;All that we hear about the decay of the Turkish Empire, and its being a dead body or a sapless trunk, and so forth, is pure unadulterated nonsense.&quot;

His two great aims were to prevent Russia establishing itself on the Bosporus and to prevent France doing likewise on the Nile. He regarded the maintenance of the authority of the Sublime Porte as the chief barrier against both these developments.
Palmerston had long maintained a suspicious and hostile attitude towards Russia, whose autocratic government offended his liberal principles and whose ever-growing size challenged the strength of the British Empire. He was angered by the 1833 Treaty of Hünkâr İskelesi, a mutual assistance pact between Russia and the Ottomans, but was annoyed and hostile towards David Urquhart, the creator of the Vixen affair, running the Russian blockade of Circassia in the mid-1830s.

For his part, David Urquhart considered Palmerston a &quot;mercenary of Russia&quot; and founded the &quot;Free Press&quot; magazine in London, where he constantly promoted these views. The permanent author of this magazine was Karl Marx, who stated &quot;from the time of Peter the Great until the Crimean War, there was a secret agreement between the London and St. Petersburg offices, and that Palmerston was a corrupt tool of the Tsar&#x27;s policy&quot;

Despite his popular reputation he was hesitant in 1831 about aiding the Sultan Mahmud II, who was under threat from Muhammad Ali, the wali of Egypt. Later, after Russian successes, in 1833 and 1835 he made proposals to afford material aid, which were overruled by the cabinet. Palmerston held that &quot;if we can procure for it ten years of peace under the joint protection of the five Powers, and if those years are profitably employed in reorganizing the internal system of the empire, there is no reason whatever why it should not become again a respectable Power&quot; and challenged the metaphor that an old country, such as Turkey should be in such disrepair as would be warranted by the comparison: &quot;Half the wrong conclusions at which mankind arrive are reached by the abuse of metaphors, and by mistaking general resemblance or imaginary similarity for real identity.&quot; However, when the power of Muhammad Ali appeared to threaten the existence of the Ottoman dynasty, particularly given the death of Sultan Mahmud II on 1 July 1839, he succeeded in bringing the great powers together to sign a collective note on 27 July pledging them to maintain the independence and integrity of the Turkish Empire in order to preserve the security and peace of Europe. However, by 1840 Muhammad Ali had occupied Syria and won the Battle of Nezib against the Turkish forces. Lord Ponsonby, the British ambassador at Constantinople, vehemently urged the British government to intervene. Privately, Palmerston explained his views on Muhammad Ali to Lord Granville thus: &quot;Coercion of Mehemet Ali by England if war broke out might appear partial and unjust; but we are partial; and the great interests of Europe require that we should be so...No ideas therefore of fairness towards Mehemet ought to stand in the way of such great and paramount interests.&quot; Having closer ties to the wali than most, France refused to be a party to coercive measures against him despite having signed the note in the previous year.

Palmerston, irritated at France&#x27;s Egyptian policy, signed the London Convention of 15 July 1840 in London with Austria, Russia, and Prussia – without the knowledge of the French government. This measure was taken with great hesitation, and strong opposition on the part of several members of the cabinet. Palmerston forced the measure through in part by declaring in a letter to the prime minister, Lord Melbourne, that he would resign from the ministry if his policy were not adopted.
The London Convention granted Muhammad Ali hereditary rule in Egypt in return for withdrawal from Syria and Lebanon, but was rejected by the pasha. The European powers intervened with force, and the bombardment of Beirut, the fall of Acre, and the total collapse of Muhammad Ali&#x27;s power followed in rapid succession. Palmerston&#x27;s policy was triumphant, and the author of it had won a reputation as one of the most powerful statesmen of the age.

In September 1838, Palmerston appointed a British consul in Jerusalem, without the conventional consultation of the Board of Trade, and gave instruction to assist with the construction of an Anglican church in the city, under the prompting influences of Lord Shaftesbury, a prominent Christian Zionist.

===China: First Opium War===

China restricted outside trade under the Canton System to only one port and refused all official diplomatic relations except to tributary countries. In 1833–1835, as London ended the East India Company&#x27;s monopoly on trade with China, both Tory and Whig governments sought to maintain peace and good trade relations. However Lord Napier wanted to provoke a revolution in China that would open trade. The Foreign Office, led by Palmerston, stood opposed and sought peace. The Chinese government refused to change, and interdicted the British smugglers bringing in opium from India, which was banned in China. Britain responded with military force in the First Opium War, 1839–1842, which ended in a decisive British victory. Under the Treaty of Nanjing, China paid an indemnity and opened five treaty ports to world trade. In those ports there would be extraterritorial rights for British citizens. Palmerston thus achieved his main goals of diplomatic equality and opening China to trade. However his angry critics focused on the immorality of the opium trade.

Palmerston&#x27;s biographer, Jasper Ridley, outlines the government&#x27;s position:
:Conflict between China and Britain was inevitable. On the one side was a corrupt, decadent and caste-ridden despotism, with no desire or ability to wage war, which relied on custom much more than force for the enforcement of extreme privilege and discrimination, and which was blinded by a deep-rooted superiority complex into believing that they could assert their supremacy over Europeans without possessing military power. On the other side was the most economically advanced nation in the world, a nation of pushing, bustling traders, of self-help, free trade, and the pugnacious qualities of John Bull.

An entirely opposite British viewpoint was promoted by humanitarians and reformers such as the Chartists and religious nonconformists led by young William Ewart Gladstone. They argued that Palmerston was only interested in the huge profits it would bring Britain, and was totally oblivious to the horrible moral evils of opium which the Chinese government was valiantly trying to stamp out.

Meanwhile, he manipulated information and public opinion to enhance his control of his department, including controlling communications within the office and to other officials. He leaked secrets to the press, published selected documents, and released letters to give himself more control and more publicity, all the while stirring up British nationalism. He feuded with &quot;The Times&quot;, edited by Thomas Barnes, which did not play along with his propaganda ploys.

==Marriage==

In 1839, Palmerston married his mistress of many years, the noted Whig hostess Emily Lamb, widow of Peter Leopold Louis Francis Nassau Clavering-Cowper, 5th Earl Cowper (1778–1837) and sister of William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne, prime minister (1834 and 1835–1841). They had no legitimate children, although at least one of Lord Cowper&#x27;s putative children, Lady Emily Cowper, the wife of Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury, was widely believed to have been fathered by Palmerston. Palmerston resided at Brocket Hall in Hertfordshire, his wife&#x27;s inheritance. His London townhouse was Cambridge House on Piccadilly in Mayfair.

Emily&#x27;s son-in-law, Lord Shaftesbury wrote: &quot;His attentions to Lady Palmerston, when they both of them were well stricken in years, were those of a perpetual courtship. The sentiment was reciprocal; and I have frequently seen them go out on a morning to plant some trees, almost believing that they would live to eat the fruit, or sit together under the shade.&quot;

Young Queen Victoria found it unseemly that people in their 50s could marry, but the Cowper-Palmerston marriage according to biographer Gillian Gill:
:was an inspired political alliance as well as a stab at personal happiness. Harry and Emily were supremely well-matched. As the husband of a beautiful, charming, intelligent, rich woman whose friends were the best people in society, Palmerston at last had the money, the social setting, and the personal security he needed to get to the very top of British politics. Lady Palmerston made her husband happy, as he did her, and she was a political power in her own right. In the last and most successful decades of Palmerston&#x27;s life, she was his best advisor and most trusted amanuensis. Theirs was one of the great marriages of the century.

==Opposition: 1841–1846==
Within a few months Melbourne&#x27;s administration came to an end (1841) and Palmerston remained out of office for five years. The crisis was past, but the change which took place by the substitution of François Guizot for Adolphe Thiers in France, and of Lord Aberdeen for Palmerston in Britain kept the peace. Palmerston believed that peace with France was not to be relied on, and indeed that war between the two countries was sooner or later inevitable. Aberdeen and Guizot inaugurated a different policy: by mutual confidence and friendly offices, they entirely succeeded in restoring the most cordial understanding between the two governments, and the irritation which Palmerston had inflamed gradually subsided. During the administration of Sir Robert Peel, Palmerston led a retired life, but he attacked with characteristic bitterness the Webster-Ashburton Treaty of 1842 with the United States. It resolved several Canadian boundary disputes with the United States, particularly the border between New Brunswick and the State of Maine and between Canada and the State of Minnesota from Lake Superior and the Lake of the Woods. Much as he criticised it, the treaty successfully closed the border questions with which Palmerston had long been concerned.

Palmerston&#x27;s reputation as an interventionist and his unpopularity with the Queen were such that Lord John Russell&#x27;s attempt in December 1845 to form a ministry failed because Lord Grey refused to join a government in which Palmerston would direct foreign affairs. A few months later, however, the Whigs came to power and returned Palmerston to the Foreign Office (July 1846). Russell replied to critics that Palmerston&#x27;s policies had &quot;a &quot;tendency&quot; to produce war&quot; but that he had advanced British interests without a major conflict, if not entirely peaceably.

==Foreign Secretary: 1846–1851==
Palmerston&#x27;s years as foreign secretary, 1846–1851, involve dealing with violent upheavals all over Europe – he has been dubbed &quot;the gunpowder minister&quot; by biographer David Brown.

===France and Spain, 1845===
The French government regarded the appointment of Palmerston as a certain sign of renewed hostilities. They availed themselves of a dispatch in which he had put forward the name of a Coburg prince as a candidate for the hand of the young queen of Spain as a justification for a departure from the engagements entered into between Guizot and Lord Aberdeen. However little the conduct of the French government in this transaction of the Spanish marriages can be vindicated, it is certain that it originated in the belief that in Palmerston France had a restless and subtle enemy. The efforts of the British minister to defeat the French marriages of the Spanish princesses, by an appeal to the Treaty of Utrecht and the other powers of Europe, were wholly unsuccessful; France won the game, though with no small loss of honourable reputation.

Historian David Brown rejects the traditional interpretation to the effect that Aberdeen had forged an entente cordiale with France in the early 1840s whereupon the belligerent Palmerston after 1846 destroyed that friendly relationship. Brown argues that as foreign secretary from 1846 to 1851 and subsequently as prime minister, Palmerston sought to maintain the balance of power in Europe, sometimes even aligning with France to do so.

===Irish Famine===
As an Anglo-Irish absentee landlord, Palmerston evicted 2,000 of his Irish tenants for non-payment of rent during the Great Irish Famine that ravaged Ireland in the late 1840s. He financed the emigration of starving Irish tenants across the Atlantic to North America as did Petty-Fitzmaurice (Lord Lansdowne) to equal notoriety. Palmerston asserted that &quot;... any great improvement in the social system of Ireland must be founded upon an extensive change in the present state of agrarian occupation [through] a long continued and systematic ejectment of Small holders and of Squatting Cottiers.&quot;

===Support for revolutions abroad===
The Revolutions of 1848 spread like a conflagration through Europe, and shook every throne on the Continent except those of Russian Empire, Ottoman Empire, Spain, and Belgium. Palmerston sympathised openly with the revolutionary party abroad. In particular, he was a strong advocate of national self-determination, and stood firmly on the side of constitutional liberties on the Continent. Despite this, he was bitterly opposed to Irish independence, and deeply hostile to the Young Ireland movement.

===Italian independence===
No state was regarded by him with more aversion than Austria. Yet, his opposition to Austria was chiefly based upon its occupation of northeastern Italy and its Italian policy. Palmerston maintained that the existence of Austria as a great power north of the Alps was an essential element in the system of Europe. Antipathies and sympathies had a large share in the political views of Palmerston, and his sympathies had ever been passionately awakened by the cause of Italian independence. He supported the Sicilians against King Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies, and even allowed arms to be sent them from the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich. Although he had endeavoured to restrain King Charles Albert of Sardinia from his rash attack on the superior forces of Austria, he obtained for him a reduction of the penalty of defeat. Austria, weakened by the revolution, sent an envoy to London to request the mediation of Britain, based on a large cession of Italian territory. Palmerston rejected the terms he might have obtained for Piedmont. After a couple of years this wave of revolution was replaced by a wave of reaction.

===Hungarian independence===
In Hungary, the 1848 war for independence from the Austrian Empire, ruled by the Habsburg dynasty, was defeated by the joint army of Austrian and Russian forces. Prince Schwarzenberg assumed the government of the empire with dictatorial power. In spite of what Palmerston termed his judicious bottle-holding, the movement he had encouraged and applauded, but to which he could give no material aid, was everywhere subdued. The British government, or at least Palmerston as its representative, was regarded with suspicion and resentment by every power in Europe, except the French republic. Even that was shortly afterwards to be alienated by Palmerston&#x27;s attack on Greece. When Lajos Kossuth, the Hungarian democrat and leader of its constitutionalists, landed in England in 1851 to wide applause, Palmerston proposed to receive him at Broadlands, a design which was only prevented by a peremptory vote of the cabinet.

===Royal and parliamentary reaction to 1848===
This state of things was regarded with the utmost annoyance by the British court and by most of the British ministers. On many occasions, Palmerston had taken important steps without their knowledge, which they disapproved. Over the Foreign Office he asserted and exercised an arbitrary dominion, which the feeble efforts of the premier could not control. The Queen and the Prince Consort did not conceal their indignation at the fact that they were held responsible for Palmerston&#x27;s actions by the other courts of Europe.

When Benjamin Disraeli attacked Palmerston&#x27;s foreign policy, the foreign minister responded to a five-hour speech by Thomas Chisholm Anstey with a five-hour speech of his own, the first of two great speeches in which he laid out a comprehensive defence of his foreign policy and of liberal interventionism more generally. Arguing for domestic political effect, Palmerston declaimed:
:I hold that the real policy of England... is to be the champion of justice and right, pursuing that course with moderation and prudence, not becoming the Quixote of the world, but giving the weight of her moral sanction and support wherever she thinks that justice is, and whenever she thinks that wrong has been done.
:Therefore I say that it is a narrow policy to suppose that this country or that is to be marked out as the eternal ally or the perpetual enemy of England. We have no eternal allies, and we have no perpetual enemies. Our interests are eternal and perpetual, and those interests it is our duty to follow.

Russell and the Queen both hoped that the other would take the initiative and dismiss Palmerston; the Queen was dissuaded by her husband Prince Albert, who took the limits of constitutional power very seriously, and Russell by Palmerston&#x27;s prestige with the people and his competence in an otherwise remarkably inept Cabinet.

===Don Pacifico affair===

In 1847, the home of Don Pacifico, a Gibraltarian merchant living in Athens, Greece, was attacked by an antisemitic mob, which included the sons of a Greek government minister. The Greek police did not intervene in the attack, despite being present. Because Don Pacifico was a British subject, the British government expressed concern. In January 1850, Palmerston took advantage of Don Pacifico&#x27;s claims on the Greek government, and blockaded the port of Piraeus in the Kingdom of Greece. As Greece was under the joint protection of three powers, Russia and France protested against its coercion by the British fleet.

After a memorable debate on 17 June, Palmerston&#x27;s policy was condemned by a vote of the House of Lords. The House of Commons was moved by John Arthur Roebuck to reverse the rebuke, which it did on 29 June by a majority of 46, after having heard from Palmerston on 25 June. This was the most eloquent and powerful speech he ever delivered, wherein he sought to vindicate not only his claims on the Greek government for Don Pacifico, but his entire administration of foreign affairs.

It was in this speech, which lasted for five hours, that Palmerston made the well-known declaration that a British subject ought everywhere to be protected by the strong arm of the British government against injustice and wrong; comparing the reach of the British Empire to that of the Roman Empire, in which a Roman citizen could walk the earth unmolested by any foreign power. This was the famous &quot;civis romanus sum&quot; (&quot;I am a citizen of Rome&quot;) speech. After this speech, Palmerston&#x27;s popularity had never been greater.

===Crossing the Queen and resigning, 1851===
Notwithstanding his parliamentary triumph in the Don Pacifico affair, many of his own colleagues and supporters criticised the spirit in which the foreign relations of the Crown were carried on. The Queen addressed a minute to the Prime Minister in which she recorded her dissatisfaction at the manner in which Palmerston evaded the obligation to submit his measures for the royal sanction as failing in sincerity to the Crown. This minute was communicated to Palmerston, who accepted its criticisms.

On 2 December 1851, Louis Napoleon – who had been elected President of France in 1848 – carried out a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; by dissolving the National Assembly and arresting the leading republicans. Palmerston privately congratulated Napoleon on his triumph, noting that Britain&#x27;s constitution was rooted in history but that France had had five revolutions since 1789, with the French Constitution of 1848 being a &quot;day-before-yesterday tomfoolery which the scatterbrain heads of Marrast and Tocqueville invented for the torment and perplexity of the French nation&quot;. However, the Cabinet decided that Britain must be neutral, and so Palmerston requested his officials to be diplomatic. Palmerston&#x27;s widespread support among the press, educated public opinion, and ordinary Britons caused apprehension and distrust among other politicians and angered the Court. Prince Albert complained Palmerston had sent a dispatch without showing the sovereign. Protesting innocence, Palmerston resigned. Palmerston was weakened because Parliament, where he had great support, was not in session. Palmerston continued to have wide approval among the newspapers, elite opinion, and the middle class voters. His popularity led to distrust among rivals and especially at the Royal Court. His fall demonstrates the lack of power of public opinion in a pre-democratic era. However, Palmerston kept his public support and the growing influence of public opinion steadily increased his political strength in the 1850s and 1860s.

==Home Secretary: 1852–1855==
After a brief period of Conservative minority government, the Earl of Aberdeen became Prime Minister (in office 19 December 1852 – 30 January 1855) in a coalition government of Whigs and Peelites (with Russell taking the role of Foreign Secretary and Leader of the House of Commons). It was regarded as impossible for them to form a government without Palmerston, so he was made Home Secretary (28 December 1852). Many people considered this a curious appointment because Palmerston&#x27;s expertise was so obviously in foreign affairs. A story recounts that after a great wave of strikes swept Northern England, the Queen summoned Palmerston to discuss the situation. When she enquired after the latest news, Palmerston allegedly replied: &quot;There is no definite news, Madam, but it seems certain that the Turks have crossed the Danube&quot;.

===Social reform===
Palmerston passed the Factory Act 1853, which removed loopholes in previous Factory Acts and outlawed all labour by young persons between 6pm and 6am. He attempted to pass a Bill that confirmed the rights of workers to combine, but the House of Lords rejected it. He introduced the Truck Act which stopped the practice of employers paying workmen in goods instead of money, or forcing them to purchase goods from shops owned by the employers. In August 1853, Palmerston introduced the Smoke Abatement Act in order to combat the increasing smoke from coal fires, a problem greatly aggravated by the Industrial Revolution. He also oversaw the passage of the Vaccination Act 1853 into law, which was introduced as a private member&#x27;s bill, and which Palmerston persuaded the government to support. The Act made vaccination of children compulsory for the first time. Palmerston outlawed the burying of the dead in churches. The right to bury the dead in churches was held by wealthy families whose ancestors had purchased the right in the past. Palmerston opposed this practice on public-health grounds and ensured that all bodies were buried in a churchyard or public cemetery.

===Penal reform===
Palmerston reduced the period in which prisoners could be held in solitary confinement from eighteen months to nine months. He also ended transportation to Tasmania for prisoners by passing the Penal Servitude Act 1853, which also reduced the maximum sentences for most offences. Palmerston passed the Reformatory Schools Act 1854 which gave the Home Secretary powers to send juvenile prisoners to a reformatory school instead of to prison. He was forced to accept an amendment which ensured that the prisoner had to have spent at least three months in jail first. When in October 1854 Palmerston visited Parkhurst gaol and conversed with three boy inmates, he was impressed by their behaviour and ordered that they be sent to a reformatory school. He found the ventilation in the cells unsatisfactory and ordered improvement.

Palmerston strongly opposed Lord John Russell&#x27;s plans for giving the vote to sections of the urban working-classes. When the Cabinet agreed in December 1853 to introduce a bill during the next session of Parliament in the form which Russell wanted, Palmerston resigned. However, Aberdeen told him that no definite decision on reform had been taken and persuaded Palmerston to return to the Cabinet. The electoral Reform Bill did not pass Parliament that year.

===Crimean War===
Palmerston&#x27;s exile from his traditional realm of the Foreign Office meant he did not have full control over British policy during the events precipitating the Crimean War of 1853–1856. One of his biographers, Jasper Ridley, argues that had he been in control of foreign policy at this time, war in the Crimea would have been avoided. Palmerston argued in Cabinet, after Russian troops concentrated on the Ottoman border in February 1853, that the Royal Navy should join the French fleet in the Dardanelles as a warning to Russia. He was overruled, however.

In May 1853, the Russians threatened to invade the principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia unless the Ottoman sultan acceded to their demands. Palmerston argued for immediate decisive action - that the Royal Navy should be sent to the Dardanelles to assist the Turkish navy and that Britain should inform Russia of London&#x27;s intention to go to war if the Imperial Russian Army invaded the principalities. However, Aberdeen objected to all of Palmerston&#x27;s proposals. After prolonged arguments, a reluctant Aberdeen agreed to send a fleet to the Dardanelles but objected to Palmerston&#x27;s other proposals. The Russian Emperor, Nicholas I, was annoyed by Britain&#x27;s actions but they did not deter him. When the British fleet arrived at the Dardanelles the weather was rough, so the fleet took refuge in the outer waters of the straits (June 1853). The Russians saw this as a violation of the Straits Convention of 1841; they invaded the two principalities in July 1853. Palmerston interpreted this as the result of British weakness and thought that if the Russians had been told that if they invaded the principalities the British and French fleets would enter the Bosphorus or the Black Sea, they would have been deterred. In Cabinet, Palmerston argued for a vigorous prosecution of the war against Russia by Britain, but Aberdeen objected, as he wanted peace. British public opinion supported the Turks, and with Aberdeen becoming steadily unpopular, Lord Dudley Stuart in February 1854 noted, &quot;Wherever I go, I have heard but one opinion on the subject, and that one opinion has been pronounced in a single word, or in a single name – Palmerston.&quot;

On 28 March 1854, Britain and France declared war on Russia for refusing to withdraw from the principalities. The war progressed slowly, with no Anglo-French gains in the Baltic and slow coalition gains in Crimea at the long Siege of Sevastopol (1854–1855). Dissatisfaction with the conduct of the war grew amongst the public in Britain and in other countries, aggravated by reports of fiascos and failures, especially the mismanagement of the heroic Charge of the Light Brigade at the Battle of Balaclava (25 October 1854). The health and living conditions of the British soldiers became notorious and the press, with correspondents in the field, made the most of the situation. Tories demanded an accounting of all soldiers, cavalry and sailors sent to the Crimea and accurate figures as to the number of casualties. When Parliament passed a bill to investigate by a vote of 305 to 148, Aberdeen said he had lost a vote of no confidence and resigned as prime minister on 30 January 1855.

== Prime Minister: 1855–1858 ==
=== Appointment and cabinet ===
Queen Victoria deeply distrusted Palmerston and first asked Lord Derby to accept the premiership. Derby offered Palmerston the office of Secretary of State for War, which he accepted under the condition that Lord Clarendon remain as Foreign Secretary. Clarendon refused, and so Palmerston rejected Derby&#x27;s offer; Derby subsequently gave up trying to form a government. The Queen sent for Lord Lansdowne but (aged 74) he was too old to accept: so she asked Russell; but none of his former colleagues except Palmerston wanted to serve under him. Having exhausted the possible alternatives, the Queen invited Palmerston to Buckingham Palace on 4 February 1855 to form a government.

Aged 70 years, 109 days, Palmerston became the oldest person in British political history to be appointed Prime Minister for the first time. As of 2024 no Prime Minister entering 10 Downing Street for the first time since Palmerston has surpassed his record. Clarendon continued at the foreign office and William Gladstone was appointed to the Exchequer. The War Department was reorganised and the position of &quot;Secretary at War&quot; was merged with the position of Secretary of State for the Colonies. However, when a committee of inquiry chaired by MP John Roebuck was established to examine the misdirection of the war in Crimea became evident, Palmerston was forced to &quot;practically accept&quot; it and this immediately led to the resignations of Lord Herbert, Gladstone and Clarendon. In turn their position were taken over with G. C. Lewis at the Exchequer, Sir Charles Wood as First Lord of the Admiralty and Russell at the Foreign Office.

The public welcomed Palmerston&#x27;s appointment as Prime Minister, believing he would safeguard Britain&#x27;s war aims and national honour. However, political circles were less enthusiastic: John Bright was critical and dismissive: &quot;Palmerston Prime Minister? What a hoax! the aged charlatan ambition.” However Lady Cowper noted, “I fear he is not popular, except out of doors among the people, who say he is a true Englishman.” Though some doubted his abilities, he was respected among the ruling elite and admired by the middle classes. MPs initially resisted his premiership, rejecting his request to forgo the inquiry into the war&#x27;s conduct. Benjamin Disraeli exaggerated Palmerston’s frailties, calling him &quot;an imposter… an old painted pantaloon, very deaf, very blind, and with false teeth which would fall out of his mouth when speaking.&quot; In reality, while his eyesight weakened and gout troubled him, he retained remarkable stamina, often outlasting colleagues in Parliament, riding to hounds, and taking long country walks. Despite concerns, he proved resilient, defying expectations and leading with energy.

===Ending the Crimean War===

Palmerston took a hard line on the war; he wanted to expand the fighting, especially in the Baltic where St. Petersburg could be threatened by superior British naval power. His goal was to permanently reduce the Russian threat to Europe. If Sweden and Prussia were willing to join, Russia would stand alone. However, France, which had sent far more soldiers to the war than Britain, and had suffered far more casualties, wanted the war to end, as did Austria. In March 1855 the old Tsar died and was succeeded by his son, Alexander II, who wished to make peace. However, Palmerston found the peace terms too soft on Russia and so persuaded Napoleon III to break off the peace negotiations until Sevastopol could be captured, putting the allies in a stronger negotiating position. In September Sevastopol finally surrendered and the allies had full control of the Black Sea theatre. Russia came to terms. On 27 February 1856 an armistice was signed and after a month&#x27;s negotiations an agreement was signed at the Congress of Paris. Palmerston&#x27;s demand for a demilitarised Black Sea was secured, although his wish for the Crimea to be returned to the Ottomans was not. The peace treaty was signed on 30 March 1856. In April 1856 Palmerston was appointed to the Order of the Garter by Victoria.

===Arrow controversy and the Second Opium War===
In October 1856, the Chinese seized the pirate ship &quot;Arrow&quot;, and in the process, according to the local British official Harry Smith Parkes, insulted the British flag. When the Chinese Commissioner Ye Mingchen refused to apologise, the British shelled his compound. The commissioner retaliated with a proclamation that called on the people of Canton to &quot;unite in exterminating these troublesome English villains&quot; and offered a $100 bounty for the head of any Englishman. The British factories outside the city were also burned to the ground by incensed locals. Palmerston supported Parkes while in Parliament the British policy was strongly attacked on moral grounds by Richard Cobden and William Ewart Gladstone. Playing the patriotism card, Palmerston said that Cobden demonstrated &quot;an anti-English feeling, an abnegation of all those ties which bind men to their country and to their fellow countrymen, which I should hardly have expected from the lips of any member of this House. Everything that was English was wrong, and everything that was hostile to England was right.&quot; He went on to say that if a motion of censure was carried it would signal that the House had voted to &quot;abandon a large community of British subjects at the extreme end of the globe to a set of barbarians – a set of kidnapping, murdering, poisoning barbarians.&quot; The censure motion was carried by a majority of sixteen and the election of 1857 followed. Palmerston&#x27;s stance proved popular among a large section of the workers, the growing middle classes and the country&#x27;s commercial and financial interests. With the expanded franchise, his party swept on a wave of popular feeling to a majority of 83, the largest since 1835. Cobden and John Bright lost their seats.

In China, the Second Opium War (1856–1860) was another humiliating defeat for a Qing dynasty, already reeling as a result of the domestic Taiping Rebellion. After winning the election, Palmerston pursued a decisive resolution to the conflict in China. While he had defended Governor John Bowring&#x27;s actions in the Arrow incident but agreed with the Cabinet that Bowring had mishandled the situation and replaced him with Lord Elgin. Elgin issued an ultimatum to the Chinese official Yeh, demanding compensation for British losses in Canton. Yeh responded diplomatically but maintained his justification for his actions. Elgin, nonetheless, declared war and, by February 1858, Palmerston announced in the House of Commons that Canton had been stormed and captured. Yeh was arrested, disguised as a coolie, and sent to India as a prisoner of state, treated with deference but confined in a luxurious villa near Calcutta, where he died a year later. The conflict was concluded at the Treaty of Tientsin. In 1860, following a reconciliation with Napoleon III and strengthening of Anglo-French relation, a joint expedition was launched into China by British and French forces under the commands of General Sir Hope Grant and Count Palikao. After a series of successful battles, Peking was captured.

===Domestic policy===

After the election, Palmerston&#x27;s government introduced a divorce bill following years of delay and as a display of Palmerston&#x27;s political power after winning a majority in the Commons. The bill&#x27;s passage would ultimately improve the government&#x27;s reputation. The objective was to establish a new divorce court and simplify the process of obtaining a divorce. However, the government chose to retain the “double standard” in divorce laws, likely to avoid controversy. Palmerston passed the Matrimonial Causes Act 1857, which for the first time made it possible for courts to grant a divorce and removed divorce from the jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical courts. The opponents in Parliament, who included Gladstone, were the first in British history to try to kill a bill by filibuster. Nonetheless, Palmerston was determined to get the bill through, which he did.

During his first term as prime minister, Palmerston championed education reform. He supported attempts to review school curriculums and placed emphasis on the importance of making subjects such as science, modern languages and mathematics primary in schools in order to make education relevantly cater to the &quot;needs of the time&quot;. In 1855, he proposed establishing more schools to serve this purpose. He strongly backed the introduction of drill, rifle practice, cricket, and football in major public schools. Legislation passed between 1855 and 1857 allowed local authorities to send children of those on outdoor relief and vagrant children to industrial schools, which received government grants from 1856. Another Act in 1857 permitted local authorities to provide grants to reformatory schools. Despite the failure of Lord Granville&#x27;s ambitious national education plans, which Palmerston&#x27;s cabinet supported, Palmerston acknowledged the growing role of the Privy Council in education. By 1857, its grants had reached half a million pounds annually. To reinforce this responsibility, he established the position of Vice-President of the Council, ensuring direct parliamentary oversight of educational matters.

Palmerston also initiated a series of &quot;modest&quot; reforms at opening up and improving the Civil Service, through the introduction of competitive entry, which was recommended by the Northcote–Trevelyan Report of 1854. However, he was not enthusiastic about replacing the patronage system with competitive examinations for civil service appointments in the 1850s. He acknowledged the advantages but argued that success in exams mainly tested memory and study habits rather than overall suitability for office. In an letter to Lord Clarendon on December 16 1855, he wrote that while he believed ministers should decide on exams for their departments, he recommended mathematical testing, particularly in Euclid, for diplomats. He opposed open entry into government jobs through exams, fearing widespread disappointment due to limited positions. He also criticised irrelevant exam questions, such as asking police candidates about Russian policy in the Balkans.

Palmerston&#x27;s government also passed the Burial Act 1857 which disallowed the Church of England to reuse graves, regulated where and how the deceased may buried, offered exhumation for remains, and made it illegal to disturb a grave despite not make it illegal to steal a dead corpse and although constituted the opening of a grave as an offence. Palmerston was considered progressive in law reform, introducing significant legislation despite legal conservatism. He introduced the Joint Stock Companies Act 1856 which enabled limited liability companies without private Acts of Parliament. In an era with fewer statutes, his reforms were far-reaching. He was neither obstructionist nor overly conservative in legal matters. This approach mirrored his commitment to public health improvements.

Palmerston later appointed William Cowper, who had led the General Board of Health since 1855, to become its first official parliamentary head for education. The Board of Health faced controversy due to Edwin Chadwick&#x27;s bureaucratic Benthamism and opposition to central control, but was later replaced. Palmerston initially kept Sir Benjamin Hall, a champion of localism, in charge but later appointed Cowper, who brought in John Simon as the first Chief Medical Officer. Simons’ official biographer noted that “its chief, Lord Palmerston… possessed a genuine social concern, and the responsible minister, William Cowper… proved zealous, competent and knowledgeable.”  Palmerston had a genuine concern for social issues, unlike his Tory predecessors and later successors. When the Board faced abolition, Palmerston alongside sanitary reformer Arthur Helps sought to preserve its work by transferring medical functions to the Privy Council which initially failed. The measure was temporarily enacted in 1858 by the Tories. Palmerston later secured its permanent ratification in 1859 by a small majority.

=== Indian Mutiny of 1857 ===
In June news came to Britain of the Indian Rebellion of 1857. On 19 May, mentions of the rebellion was raised by Lord Ellenborough during a debate in the House of Lords, in which he questioned the Secretary of State for War, Lord Panmure, on whether he &quot;recently viewed&quot; the news of the uprising. Panmure replied that &quot;intelligence recently received from India had not been such as to create any apprehension in the minds of Her Majesty&#x27;s Ministers for the safety pf our Indian empire.&quot; Palmerston, who by now was highly popular among the British public and seen as &quot;invincible&quot; due to him leading the government through in times of crisis, did not took the rebellion seriously and was initially sceptical of British troops being defeated by what he considered &quot;native rabble&quot;. He particularly opposed the Governor-General, Lord Canning&#x27;s attempts divert troops heading to China back to India. When the severity of the situation began to unravel, Palmerston was immediate in sending troops to quell the revolt that many at home believed that it would leave no soldiers to defend Britain itself from invasion. Palmerston approved a suggestion to set a date for a day of &quot;National Prayer and Humiliation&quot; following a precedent established during the Crimean War. The Queen approved of the proposal and Palmerston planned the day alongside the Archbishop of Canterbury, John Bird Sumner on October 7. Palmerston sent Sir Colin Campbell and reinforcements to India. Palmerston also agreed to transfer the authority of the East India Company to the Crown. Within three months of the rebellion around 30,000 troops were deployed to India. At the urging of the Queen, Palmerston consulted with the Duke of Cambridge on further measures and sent two regiments of foot to Madras and two companies of artillery to each province. Much of the fighting, prior to the arrival of reinforcements, were carried by the army stationed in India and within months Delhi was captured by company forces and reinforcements from the mutineers. A bill was introduced to Parliament to alter the governance of India, which by then have been under the rule of the EIC, that would bring the control of Indian affairs under the oversight of a Board of Control under the British government. The bill was passed by a unexpectedly large majority of 145. This was enacted in the Government of India Act 1858. This ended company rule in India which was established in 1757.

=== Orsini affair and resignation ===
After the Italian republican Felice Orsini tried to assassinate the French emperor with a bomb made in Britain, the French were outraged (see Orsini affair). The French demanded that no such people be granted asylum in the country and the French ambassador was ordered to make presentations regarding the incident to Parliament. In order to preserve good relations with France, Palmerston introduced a Conspiracy to Murder bill, which made it a felony to plot in Britain to murder someone abroad. The condemnation of British conduct were spread by the French media and the use of bitter tongue by French army officers when receiving the French emperor as a delegacy, led to anger among the British public. Lord Derby took the advantage of exploiting the resentment of the British people to propose a amendment to the bill. At first reading, the Conservatives voted for it but at second reading they voted against it. Palmerston lost by nineteen votes. Therefore, in February 1858 he was forced to resign.

==Opposition: 1858–1859==
The Conservatives lacked a majority, and Russell introduced a resolution in March 1859 arguing for widening the franchise, which the Conservatives opposed but which was carried. Parliament was dissolved and a general election ensued, which the Whigs won. Palmerston rejected an offer from Disraeli to become Conservative leader, but he attended the meeting of 6 June 1859 in Willis&#x27;s Rooms at St James&#x27;s Street, where the Liberal Party was formed. The Queen asked Lord Granville to form a government, but although Palmerston agreed to serve under him, Russell did not. Therefore, on 12 June the Queen asked Palmerston to become prime minister. Russell and Gladstone agreed to serve under him.

==Prime Minister: 1859–1865==

Historians usually regard Palmerston, starting in 1859, as the first Liberal prime minister.

=== Domestic policy ===
In his last premiership, Palmerston oversaw the passage of important legislation. The Offences against the Person Act 1861 codified and reformed the law, and was part of a wider process of consolidating criminal law. The Companies Act 1862 was the basis of modern company law. Palmerston established the Newcastle Commission in 1859 which looked into the inadequacies of public education and led to increases in school funding in the Revised Code of 1862. The Union Chargeability Act 1865 which consolidated local parishes into unions and broadened bases that provided for the relief of the poor. Palmerston&#x27;s policies toward Ireland was more based on practical sense rather than radical change. He was firmly opposed to a measure by Gladstone that would have created a legal fixture on land tenure. In 1860, Landlord and Tenant Law Amendment Act 1860 was extended to Ireland in which the landlord and tenant agreed that compensation could be fixed by a government valuer can be secured in the form of an annuity.

In 1860, provisions contained in the Factories Act were extended to bleaching and dyeing work, while authority was given to provide analysts of drink and food. An Act was passed that provided for the inspection of gas-works. Another Act provided for further mine-inspection while making it penal, as noted by one study, &quot;to employ boys under twelve not attending school and unable to read and write.&quot; An Act of 1861 extended the mandatory provisions of the Factories Act to lace-works, while an Act was passed the following year for restricting the employment of women and children in open-air bleaching, along with an Act (as one study noted) &quot;for making illegal a coal-mine with a single shaft, or with shafts separated by less than a specified space.&quot; A Bakehouses Registration Act included provisions such as specifying minimum age of employees occupied between certain hours, while another Act gave a magistrate authority, as one observer noted, &quot;to decide on the wholesomeness or unwholesomeness of food brought before him by an Inspector.&quot; In 1864, the Factories Act was extended to various additional trades.

Palmerston held orthodox views regarding crime and poverty, shaped by ideas he espoused since his youth. In 1862 a wave of violent crime took place in London and when the public demanded harsher punishments, he abandoned penal reforms as that he himself introduced as Home Secretary. He urged his own Home Secretary Sir George Grey to introduce flogging for robbery and abolish the ticket-of-leave system, though the latter was only restricted rather than removed. A statute was passed in 1863 that added flogging as an additional punishment for violent robbery known as the Garroters Act. He supported the death penalty for murder but oversaw the abolition of capital punishment for attempted murder under the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act. In 1864, he protested the commutation of Victor Townley&#x27;s death sentence, denouncing the &quot;benevolence-mongers&quot; and arguing that &quot;if a man were sane enough not to commit suicide, he was sane enough to refrain from killing others&quot;. He opposed author Charles Dickens&#x27; campaign to end public executions, believing they had a deterrent effect. His views on poverty remained rooted in Malthusian principles, opposing excessive public relief during the Lancashire Cotton Famine. He also dismissed efforts to rehabilitate prostitutes, considering their existence a protection for &quot;respectable women.&quot; Though not against all reforms, he resisted those that threatened the dominance of the landed aristocracy, which he saw as vital to Britain&#x27;s stability.

Palmerston&#x27;s second government was notable for its active and productive legislative work, which was able to absolved it of any charge of useless indolence, despite Palmerston and his cabinet not introducing far reaching innovative reform. The parliamentary budgets introduced by Gladstone were enough to demonstrate the effectiveness of the ministry and the annual Queen&#x27;s Speeches at the end of each parliamentary session, showed promising modest reforms by both houses of parliament that were exceptionally useful such as prisons bills, partnership liability bills, crime chargeability bills and so on. His Lord Chancellor Lord Westbury, proved to be one of the &quot;greatest of the modern reform Lord Chancellors&quot; with rigorous attempts at reform the legal system, despite falling short on his ambitions with his plans for land transfers and title registration not being fully realised.

Unlike any of his reform-minded colleagues, Palmerston opposed further extending the vote, which lead many even in his own cabinet to accuse him of being a &quot;Tory in disguise&quot;. According to biographer Lloyd Charles Sanders, the fact that Palmerston held &quot;such a body of men together until his death, with less than average number of resignations, is perhaps the greatest of his feats as a parliamentary manager.&quot; Russell&#x27;s support for lowering the voting franchise and redistribution of seats proved to be less urgent compared to the Gladstone&#x27;s tense opposition to increasing military expenditure. Palmerston resolved the situation by allowing Russell to introduce a reform bill, which lowered the voting franchise from £10 to £6 and redistributed 25 parliamentary seats. However, a lack of public interest and disinterest from Parliament itself led to the bill&#x27;s eventual demise in committee. Following the bill&#x27;s failure, Benjamin Disraeli pointed that Palmerston was &quot;not so much in support of, as about&quot; the reform bill and in Palmerston&#x27;s reports to the Queen he made &quot;little or no attempt to conceal his satisfaction as its approaching demise.&quot;

Palmerston faced scandal over revelations of alleged abuses of patronage and scrutiny concerning a number of misdeeds done by Lord Westbury during his final months as lord chancellor. Several instances of patronage abuse were proven though the case against Westbury on charges of personal corruption fell short due to lack of evidence. The controversy did not impact the government which was shown during the election of 1865 when the public returned the government with a substantial majority. Palmerston&#x27;s own handling of patronage—both secular and ecclesiastical—according to Lord Shaftesbury were &quot;compelling&quot;. His appointments of bishops for ecclesiastical positions were controversial among the High church faction and Bishop Samuel Wilberforce, who opposed Palmerston&#x27;s appointments due to many of the bishops belonging to the Evangelical wing of the Church of England, known as &quot;Shaftesbury bishops&quot;. In 1859, Palmerston&#x27;s alliance with the Peelites led to his appointments becoming more inclusive which favoured candidates based on merit regardless of theological affiliation.

=== Foreign policy ===
Foreign policy continued to be his main strength; he thought that he could shape if not control all of European diplomacy, especially by using France as a vital ally and trade partner. However, historians often characterise his method as bluffing more than decisive action.
Some people called Palmerston a womaniser; &quot;The Times&quot; named him Lord Cupid (on account of his youthful looks), and he was cited, at the age of 79, as co-respondent in an 1863 divorce case, although it emerged that the case was nothing more than an attempted blackmail.

===Relationship with Gladstone===
Although Palmerston and William Ewart Gladstone treated each other respectfully, they disagreed fundamentally over Church appointments, foreign affairs, defence and reform; Palmerston&#x27;s greatest problem during his last premiership was how to handle his Chancellor of the Exchequer. The MP Sir William Henry Gregory was told by a member of the Cabinet that &quot;at the beginning of each session and after each holiday, Mr Gladstone used to come in charged to the muzzle with all sorts of schemes of all sorts of reforms which were absolutely necessary in his opinion to be immediately undertaken. Palmerston used to look fixedly at the paper before him, saying nothing until there was a lull in Gladstone&#x27;s outpouring. He then rapped the table and said cheerfully: &#x27;Now, my Lords and gentlemen, let us go to business&#x27;.&quot; Palmerston told Lord Shaftesbury: &quot;Gladstone will soon have it all his own way and whenever he gets my place we shall have strange doings&quot;. He told another friend that he thought Gladstone would wreck the Liberal Party and end up in a madhouse.

When in May 1864 the MP Edward Baines introduced a Reform Bill in the Commons, Palmerston ordered Gladstone to not commit himself and the government to any particular scheme. Instead Gladstone said in his speech in the Commons that he did not see why any man should not have the vote unless he was mentally incapacitated, but added that this would not come about unless the working class showed an interest in reform. Palmerston believed that this was incitement to the working class to begin agitating for reform and told Gladstone: &quot;What every Man and Woman too have a Right to, is to be well governed and under just Laws, and they who propose a change ought to shew that the present organization does not accomplish those objects&quot;.

French intervention in Italy had created an invasion scare and Palmerston established a Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom which reported in 1860. It recommended a huge programme of fortifications to protect the Royal Navy Dockyards and ports, which Palmerston vigorously supported. Objecting to the enormous expense, Gladstone repeatedly threatened to resign as Chancellor when the proposals were accepted. Palmerston said that he had received so many resignation letters from Gladstone that he feared that they would set fire to the chimney.

=== Finances ===
The financial policy of Palmerston&#x27;s government was heavily centred around the budgets of Gladstone and was marked by tensions between Palmerston and Gladstone. Palmerston, who feared an imminent French invasion, wanted substantial increases in military defences, which clashed with Gladstone&#x27;s committed to reducing public spending and pursuing free trade principles. One of the major fiscal measures proposed by Gladstone was the repeal of paper duties, a proposal which encountered stiff opposition from Palmerston within the Cabinet, who was not in favour of removing such duties, and from the House of Lords, which ultimately rejected the measure. Palmerston privately viewed the rejection of the repeal as a beneficial act, stating that the Lords had &quot;performed a good public service&quot; by blocking the measure.

In addition to paper duties, Gladstone&#x27;s budget of 1860 also introduced the first graduated income tax in Britain with renewing at varying rate (ten pence in the pound for incomes above £150 and seven pence for incomes above £100) and extended the license system to include wine-refreshment houses. The reform was in line with Gladstone&#x27;s broader goal of reducing protectionist measures and promoting free trade policies. Gladstone expected increased receipts in the future from reduced duties, however, he retained full duties on sugar and tea was income tax placed at ten pence. However, the Budget was not without controversy. While Gladstone celebrated the measures within the budget as a triumph, Palmerston remained focused on national defence, which was at odds with Gladstone&#x27;s fiscal austerity. The conflict between the two men was especially evident in their differing views on public expenditure. Palmerston wanted funding for ironclad warships and fortifications to protect Britain&#x27;s coastal ports, such as Portsmouth and Plymouth, which he considered crucial for national security.

Overall, the budget was hailed as the greatest &quot;free trade budget&quot; since Sir Robert Peel&#x27;s time. During this period, exports of home produce surged from £113 million in 1842 to £363 million in 1865 while imports grew from £65 million to £181 million. The import of essential goods like butter, bacon, and rice which were negligible at 8,355 cwts in 1842, surged to an 713,346 cwts high by 1865. Similarly, egg imports soared from under one million to nearly four million. The export of foreign and colonial produce experienced an equal increase, from £18 million in 1842 to £52 million by 1865. The expansion of exports in manufactured goods also increased with cotton exports almost tripling, while machinery exports growing by tenfold, woollen yarn exports increasing eightfold, and items like linen, silk, hardware, leather, and iron and steel showed exponential growth, with many of these sectors seeing four to sixfold increases. Haberdashery also exports multiplied sevenfold. These advancements were bolstered by the repeal of the navigation laws, which facilitated a threefold increase in British shipping tonnage entered with cargo, from 5.4 million tons in 1842 to 17.4 million in 1865. Foreign tonnage also surged, growing from 1.9 million to 7.5 million tons during the same period. The steamship industry, a testament to technological progress, saw tonnage rise from 186,687 in 1851 to 823,533 by 1865, more than quadrupling.

Gladstone, however, increasingly found it difficult to reconcile his role as Chancellor with the pressure to fund Palmerston&#x27;s defence initiatives. The growing defence budget, including proposed expenditures for the military, led to frequent clashes between the two. Gladstone felt that the increasing military costs were excessive and detrimental to the nation&#x27;s finances. At one point, he even threatened to resign on multiple occasions over the issue, expressing his frustration with Palmerston&#x27;s disregard for fiscal discipline. Despite these tensions, Palmerston remained steadfast in his belief that military preparedness was paramount, going so far as to tell the Queen that it would be better to lose Gladstone than to compromise Britain&#x27;s defence capabilities.

===Relationship with Lord Lyons===
During the advent and occurrence of the American Civil War, the British Ambassador to the United States was Palmerston&#x27;s close friend and ally Richard Lyons, 2nd Baron Lyons. Palmerston had first appointed Richard Lyons to the Foreign Service in 1839, and was a close friend of his father, Edmund Lyons, 1st Baron Lyons, with whom he had vehemently advocated increased aggression in the Crimean War. Palmerston and Lyons both had similar sociopolitical sympathies: both advocated monarchy and foreign interventionism. Throughout the American Civil War, Palmerston and Richard Lyons maintained an extensive confidential correspondence. Their actions were responsible for the peaceful resolution of the Trent Affair. When Lyons resigned from the position of American Ambassador, Palmerston attempted to persuade him to return, but Lyons declined the offer.

===American Civil War===

Palmerston&#x27;s sympathies in the American Civil War (1861–1865) were with the secessionist Confederate States of America. Although a professed opponent of the Atlantic slave trade and slavery, he held a lifelong hostility towards the United States, and believed a dissolution of the Union would enhance British power. Additionally, the Confederacy &quot;would afford a valuable and extensive market for British manufactures&quot;.

Britain issued a at the beginning of the Civil War on 13 May 1861. The Confederacy was recognised as a belligerent but it was too premature to recognise it as a sovereign state. The United States Secretary of State, William Seward, threatened to treat as hostile any country which recognised the Confederacy. Britain depended more on American corn than Confederate cotton, and a war with the U.S. would not be in Britain&#x27;s economic interest. Palmerston ordered reinforcements sent to the Province of Canada because he was convinced the North would make peace with the South and then invade Canada. He was very pleased with the Confederate victory at the First Battle of Bull Run in July 1861, but 15 months later he felt: ...the American War... has manifestly ceased to have any attainable object as far as the Northerns are concerned, except to get rid of some more thousand troublesome Irish and Germans. It must be owned, however, that the Anglo-Saxon race on both sides have shown courage and endurance highly honourable to their stock.

The &quot;Trent&quot; Affair in November 1861 produced public outrage in Britain and a diplomatic crisis. A U.S. Navy warship stopped the British steamer &quot;Trent&quot; and seized two Confederate envoys &quot;en route&quot; to Europe. Palmerston called the action &quot;a declared and gross insult&quot;, demanded the release of the two diplomats and ordered 3,000 troops to Canada. In a letter to Queen Victoria on 5 December 1861 he said that if his demands were not met: Great Britain is in a better state than at any former time to inflict a severe blow upon and to read a lesson to the United States which will not soon be forgotten. In another letter to his foreign secretary, he predicted war between Britain and the Union:
It is difficult not to come to the conclusion that the rabid hatred of England which animates the exiled Irishmen who direct almost all the Northern newspapers, will so excite the masses as to make it impossible for Lincoln and Seward to grant our demands; and we must therefore look forward to war as the probable result.
In fact, Irishmen did not control any major newspapers in the North, and the U.S. decided to release the prisoners rather than risk war. Palmerston was convinced the presence of troops in Canada persuaded the U.S. to acquiesce.

After President Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s announcement in September 1862 that he would issue an Emancipation Proclamation in ninety days, the cabinet debated intervention as a humanitarian move to stop a likely race war. At the same time however there was a cabinet crisis in France over the overthrow of the Greek king and the growing Eastern question with regard to Russia. The British Government had to determine whether the situation in North America or the containment of Russia was more urgent. The decision was to give priority to threats closer to home and to decline France&#x27;s suggestion of a joint intervention in America; the threatened race war over slavery never happened. Palmerston rejected all further efforts of the Confederacy to gain British recognition.
The long-term issue between Britain and the United States was the supply of blockade runners loaded with British arms or construction of commerce raiders for the Confederate war effort. The U.S. accused Britain of being complicit in gunrunning and sales of warships by private firms to the Confederacy that actually sustained the war by two years. This was later evidenced by Palmerston&#x27;s refusal to stop firms from selling arms and ships on the basis that it had a right to sell such things to both sides as a neutral country, even though the South was still part of the U.S. (as ruled in &quot;Texas v. White&quot; in 1869 by the U.S. Supreme Court). As such, many Americans viewed the British as interfering with American affairs and indirectly committing an act of war against the U.S.

The raiding ship CSS &quot;Alabama&quot;, built in the British port of Birkenhead, was another difficulty for Palmerston. On 29 July 1862, a law officer&#x27;s report he had commissioned advised him to detain &quot;Alabama&quot;, as its construction was a breach of Britain&#x27;s neutrality. Palmerston ordered &quot;Alabama&quot; detained on 31 July, but it had already put to sea before the order reached Birkenhead. In her subsequent cruise, &quot;Alabama&quot; captured or destroyed many Union merchant ships, as did other raiders fitted out in Britain. This was the basis of the postwar &quot;Alabama&quot; claims for damages against Britain, which Palmerston refused to pay. After his death, Gladstone acknowledged the U.S. claim and agreed to arbitration, paying out $15,500,000 in damages. However, no compensation for damages done to the U.S. by British-built blockade runners carrying arms supplies to the Confederacy was offered.

===Denmark===
The Prussian Prime Minister Otto von Bismarck wanted to annex the Danish Duchy of Schleswig and the neighboring German Duchy of Holstein, whose Duke was the King of Denmark, chiefly for its port of Kiel, and had an alliance with Austria for this purpose. This was part of the longstanding Schleswig–Holstein question. In a speech to the Commons on 23 July 1863, Palmerston said the British government, like those of France and Russia, wished that &quot;the independence, the integrity, and the rights of Denmark may be maintained. We are convinced—I am convinced at least—that if any violent attempt were made to overthrow those rights and interfere with that independence, those who made the attempt would find in the result that it would not be Denmark alone with which they would have to contend&quot;. Palmerston&#x27;s stance derived from the traditional belief that France was the greater threat to Britain and was much stronger than Austria and Prussia. In any case, France and Britain were at odds over Poland, and Paris refused to cooperate with London on the Danish crisis. Public opinion in Britain was strongly pro-Danish, thanks especially to the Danish princess who married the Prince of Wales. However Queen Victoria was intensely pro-German and strongly urged against threatening war. Palmerston himself favoured Denmark but he also had long been pacifistic in this matter and did not want Britain to become militarily involved.

For five months Bismarck did nothing. However, in November the Danish government instituted a new constitution whereby Schleswig was bound closer to Denmark. By the year&#x27;s end, the Prussian and Austrian armies had occupied Holstein and were massing on the River Eider, the border with Schleswig. On 1 February 1864, the Prussian-Austrian armies invaded Schleswig, and ten days afterwards the Danish government requested British help to resist this. Russell urged Palmerston to send a fleet to Copenhagen and persuade Napoleon III that he should mobilise his French soldiers on the borders of Prussia.

Palmerston replied that the fleet could not do much to assist the Danes in Copenhagen and that nothing should be done to persuade Napoleon to cross the Rhine. Britain had a small army and it had no powerful ally to help. Bismarck remarked that the Royal Navy lacked wheels—it was powerless on land where the war would be fought. In April Austria&#x27;s navy was on its way to attack Copenhagen. Palmerston told the Austrian ambassador that if his fleet entered the Baltic to attack Denmark the result would be war with Britain. The ambassador replied that the Austrian navy would not enter the Baltic and it did not do so.

Palmerston accepted Russell&#x27;s suggestion that the war should be settled at a conference, but at the ensuing London Conference of 1864 in May and June the Danes refused to accept their loss of Schleswig-Holstein. The armistice ended on 26 June and Prussian-Austrian troops quickly invaded more of Denmark. On 25 June the Cabinet was against going to war to save Denmark, and Russell&#x27;s suggestion to send the Royal Navy to defend Copenhagen was only carried by Palmerston&#x27;s vote. Palmerston, however, said the fleet could not be sent in view of the deep division in the Cabinet.

On 27 June, Palmerston gave his statement to the Commons and said Britain would not go to war with the German powers unless the existence of Denmark as an independent power was at stake or Denmark&#x27;s capital was threatened. The Conservatives replied that Palmerston had betrayed the Danes and a vote of censure in the House of Lords was carried by nine votes. In the debate in the Commons the Conservative MP General Jonathan Peel said: &quot;It is come to this, that the words of the Prime Minister of England, uttered in the Parliament of England, are to be regarded as mere idle menaces to be laughed at and despised by foreign powers.&quot; Palmerston replied in the last night of the debate: &quot;I say that England stands as high as she ever did and those who say she had fallen in the estimation of the world are not the men to whom the honour and dignity of England should be confided&quot;.

The vote of censure was defeated by 313 votes to 295, with Palmerston&#x27;s old enemies in the pacifist camp, Cobden and Bright, voting for him. The result of the vote was announced at 2:30 in the morning, and when Palmerston heard the news he ran up the stairs to the Ladies&#x27; Gallery and embraced his wife. Disraeli wrote: &quot;What pluck to mount those dreadful stairs at three o&#x27;clock in the morning, and eighty years of age!&quot;

In a speech at his constituency at Tiverton in August, Palmerston told his constituents:

I am sure every Englishman who has a heart in his breast and a feeling of justice in his mind, sympathizes with those unfortunate Danes (cheers), and wishes that this country could have been able to draw the sword successfully in their defence (continued cheers); but I am satisfied that those who reflect on the season of the year when that war broke out, on the means which this country could have applied for deciding in one sense that issue, I am satisfied that those who make these reflections will think that we acted wisely in not embarking in that dispute. (Cheers.) To have sent a fleet in midwinter to the Baltic every sailor would tell you was an impossibility, but if it could have gone it would have been attended by no effectual result. Ships sailing on the sea cannot stop armies on land, and to have attempted to stop the progress of an army by sending a fleet to the Baltic would have been attempting to do that which it was not possible to accomplish. (Hear, hear.) If England could have sent an army, and although we all know how admirable that army is on the peace establishment, we must acknowledge that we have no means of sending out a force at all equal to cope with the 300,000 or 400,000 men whom the 30,000,000 or 40,000,000 of Germany could have pitted against us, and that such an attempt would only have insured a disgraceful discomfiture—not to the army, indeed, but to the Government which sent out an inferior force and expected it to cope successfully with a force so vastly superior. (Cheers.) ... we did not think that the Danish cause would be considered as sufficiently British, and as sufficiently bearing on the interests and the security and the honour of England, as to make it justifiable to ask the country to make those exertions which such a war would render necessary.

Europe&#x27;s leaders were unable to settle the matter by peaceful compromise. Palmerston&#x27;s biographer William Baring Pemberton argued that his &quot;failure to understand Bismarck lies at the root of his misunderstanding of the Schleswig-Holstein question, and it derived from an old man&#x27;s inability to adapt himself to a changing world&quot;. Thus Britain was militarily unable to stop Bismarck&#x27;s armies and misunderstood Bismarck&#x27;s ambitions. Russian historian V. N. Vinogradov writes: &quot;In place of the former insight came bias in judgments and stubbornness in defending outdated views. Palmerston continued to consider Prussia &#x27;an instrument in the hands of Austria&#x27;, its army weak and doomed to defeat, and its public to consist of romantically minded students and dreamy professors. And Otto von Bismarck quietly annexed the two Duchies to Prussia, and at the same time the County of Lauenburg&quot;.

===Electoral victory===
Palmerston won another general election in July 1865, increasing his majority. The leadership of Palmerston was a great electoral asset to the Liberal Party. He then had to deal with the outbreak of Fenian violence in Ireland. Palmerston ordered the Viceroy of Ireland, Lord Wodehouse, to take measures against this, including a possible suspension of trial-by-jury and a monitoring of Americans travelling to Ireland. He believed that the Fenian agitation was caused by America. On 27 September 1865 he wrote to the Secretary for War:
The American assault on Ireland under the name of Fenianism may be now held to have failed, but the snake is only scotched and not killed. It is far from impossible that the American conspirators may try and obtain in our North American provinces compensation for their defeat in Ireland.

He advised that more armaments be sent to Canada and more troops be sent to Ireland. During these last few weeks of his life, Palmerston pondered on developments in foreign affairs. He began thinking of a new friendship with France as &quot;a sort of preliminary defensive alliance&quot; against the United States and looked forward to Prussia becoming more powerful as this would balance against the growing threat from Russia. In a letter to Russell he warned that Russia &quot;will in due time become a power almost as great as the old Roman Empire ... Germany ought to be strong in order to resist Russian aggression.&quot;

At eighty, Palmerston continued leading the country, though despite being acutely aware of the changing tides that would define the coming age. Reflecting on his eventual successor, Palmerston predicted that Gladstone would soon take over, saying &quot;Gladstone will soon have it all his own way; and whenever he gets my place, we shall have strange doings&quot;. In July, he gave his last formal speech regarding the services provided by members of private businesses. Palmerston traveled to his constituency of Tiverton, where he engaged in a &quot;one more brush&quot; with the Chartist butcher Mr. Rowcliffe. Concerns over a weak voice quickly disintegrated following his performance.

==Death==
Palmerston enjoyed robust health in old age, living at Romsey in his home Foxhills, built in about 1840. On 12 October 1865, he caught a chill. Instead of retiring immediately to bed, Palmerston spent an hour and a half dawdling. He then had a violent fever but his condition stabilised for the next few days. However, on the night of 17 October, his health worsened, and when his doctor asked him if he believed in regeneration of the world through Jesus Christ, Palmerston replied: &quot;Oh, surely.&quot; His last words were, &quot;That&#x27;s Article 98; now go on to the next.&quot; (He was thinking about diplomatic treaties.) An apocryphal version of his last words is: &quot;Die, my dear doctor? That is the last thing I shall do.&quot; He died at 10:45 am on Wednesday, 18 October 1865, two days before his eighty-first birthday. Although Palmerston wanted to be buried at Romsey Abbey, the Cabinet insisted that he should have a state funeral and be buried at Westminster Abbey, which he was, on 27 October 1865. He was the fifth person not of royalty to be granted a state funeral (after Robert Blake, Sir Isaac Newton, Lord Nelson, and the Duke of Wellington).

Queen Victoria wrote after his death that though she regretted his passing, she had never liked or respected him: &quot;Strange, and solemn to think of that strong, determined man, with so much worldly ambition – gone! He had often worried and distressed us, though as Pr. Minister he had behaved &quot;very well&quot;.&quot; Florence Nightingale reacted differently upon hearing of his death: &quot;He will be a great loss to us. Tho&#x27; he made a joke when asked to do the right thing, he always did it. No one else will be able to carry things thro&#x27; the Cabinet as he did. I shall lose a powerful protector...He was so much more in earnest than he appeared. He did not do himself justice.&quot;

Having no male heir, his Irish viscountcy became extinct upon his death, but his property was inherited by his stepson William Cowper-Temple (later created the 1st Baron Mount Temple), whose inheritance included a estate in the north of County Sligo in the west of Ireland, on which his stepfather had commissioned the building of the incomplete Classiebawn Castle.

==Legacy==
As the exemplar of British nationalism, he was &quot;the defining political personality of his age.&quot;

Historian Norman Gash endorses Jasper Ridley&#x27;s characterisation of Palmerston:
:Fundamentally he was a professional politician, shrewd, cynical, resilient; tough and sometimes unscrupulous; quick to seize opportunities; always ready either to abandon an impossible cause or bide his time for a more favourable opportunity. He liked power, he needed his salary, he enjoyed office, he worked hard. In later life he took an increasing pleasure in the game of politics, and ultimately became an adroit and successful prime minister... in the end he became one of the great Victorian public personalities, a legend in his own lifetime, the personification of an England that was already passing away.

Historian Algernon Cecil summed up his greatness:
: Palmerston placed his trust... in the Press which he was at pains to manipulate; in Parliament, which he learnt better than any man then living to manage; and the Country, whose temper he knew how to catch and the weight of his name and resources he brought to bear upon every negotiation with a patriotic effrontry that has never been excelled.

Palmerston has traditionally been viewed as &quot;a Conservative at home and a Liberal abroad&quot;. He believed that the British constitution as secured by the Glorious Revolution of 1688 was the best which human hands had made, with a constitutional monarchy subject to the laws of the land but retaining some political power. He supported the rule of law and opposed further democratisation after the Reform Act 1832. He wished to see this liberal system of a mixed constitution in-between the two extremes of absolute monarchy and republican democracy replace the absolute monarchies on the Continent. More recently some historians have seen his domestic policies as prime minister as not merely liberal but genuinely progressive by the standards of his era.

It is in foreign affairs that Palmerston is chiefly remembered. Palmerston&#x27;s principal aim in foreign policy was to advance British national interests. Palmerston is famous for his patriotism. Lord John Russell said that &quot;his heart always beat for the honour of England&quot;. Palmerston believed it was in Britain&#x27;s interests that liberal governments be established on the Continent. He also practised brinkmanship and bluff in that he was prepared to threaten war to achieve Britain&#x27;s interests.

When in 1886 Lord Rosebery became foreign secretary in the Third Gladstone ministry, John Bright, a longstanding radical critic of Palmerston, asked Rosebery if he had read about Palmerston&#x27;s policies as foreign secretary. Rosebery replied that he had. &quot;Then&quot;, said Bright, &quot;you know what to avoid. Do the exact opposite of what he did. His administration at the Foreign Office was one long crime.&quot;

In contrast the Marquess of Lorne, a son-in-law of Queen Victoria, said of Palmerston in 1866: &quot;He loved his country and his country loved him. He lived for her honour, and she will cherish his memory.&quot;

In 1889, Gladstone recounted a story of when &quot;a Frenchman, thinking to be highly complimentary, said to Palmerston: &#x27;If I were not a Frenchman, I should wish to be an Englishman&#x27;; to which Pam coolly replied: &#x27;If I were not an Englishman, I should wish to be an Englishman. When Winston Churchill campaigned for rearmament in the 1930s, he was compared to Palmerston in warning the nation to look to its defences. The policy of appeasement led General Jan Smuts to write in 1936 that &quot;we are afraid of our shadows. I sometimes long for a ruffian like Palmerston or any man who would be more than a string of platitudes and apologies.&quot;

He was an avowed abolitionist whose attempts to abolish the slave trade was one of the most consistent elements of his foreign policy. His opposition to the slave trade created tensions with South American countries and the United States over his insistence that the Royal Navy had the right to search the vessels of any country if they suspected the vessels were being used in the Atlantic slave trade.

Historian A. J. P. Taylor has summarised his career by emphasising the paradoxes:
:For twenty years junior minister in a Tory government, he became the most successful of Whig Foreign Secretaries; though always a Conservative, he ended his life by presiding over the transition from Whiggism to Liberalism. He was the exponent of British strength, yet was driven from office for truckling to a foreign despot; he preached the Balance of Power, yet helped to inaugurate the policy of isolation and of British withdrawal from Europe. Irresponsible and flippant, he became the first hero of the serious middle-class electorate. He reached high office solely through an irregular family connection; he retained it through skilful use of the press—the only Prime Minister to become an accomplished leader-writer.

Palmerston is also remembered for his light-hearted approach to government. He is once said to have claimed of a particularly intractable problem relating to Schleswig-Holstein, that only three people had ever understood the problem: one was Prince Albert, who was dead; the second was a German professor, who had gone insane; and the third was himself, who had forgotten it.

&quot;The Life of Lord Palmerston up to 1847&quot; was written by Henry Bulwer, 1st Baron Dalling and Bulwer, volumes I and II (1870), volume III edited and partly written by Evelyn Ashley (1874), after the author&#x27;s death. Ashley completed the biography in two more volumes (1876). The whole work was reissued in a revised and slightly abridged form by Ashley in 2 volumes in 1879, with the title &quot;The Life and Correspondence of Henry John Temple, Viscount Palmerston&quot;; the letters are judiciously curtailed, but unfortunately without indicating where the excisions occur; the appendices of the original work are omitted, but much fresh matter is added, and this edition is undoubtedly the standard biography.

The popular Victorian novelist
Anthony Trollope published a very readable memoir of Palmerston, one of his political heroes, in 1882.
