<text>Wadena ( ) is a city in Otter Tail and Wadena counties in the state of Minnesota. It is about one hundred sixty miles northwest of the Minneapolis – Saint Paul metro area. The population was 4,325 at the 2020 census. It is the county seat of Wadena County.

Wadena is an agricultural community and serves as a region hub for the Tri county area. Wadena is located at the crossroads of Highway 10 and Highway 71.

==History==
The first permanent settlement at Wadena was made in 1871. The city is named after Chief Wadena, an Ojibwe Indian chief of the late 19th century in northwestern Minnesota. A post office has been in operation at Wadena since 1873. Wadena was incorporated in 1881. Four properties in Wadena are listed on the National Register of Historic Places: the Commercial Hotel built circa 1885, the Wadena Fire and City Hall built in 1912, the Northern Pacific Passenger Depot built in 1915, and the Peterson-Biddick Seed and Feed Company built 1916–1936.

===2010 tornado===

On June 17, 2010, Wadena was hit by an EF-4 tornado that cut a quarter-mile-wide path of destruction through the town. The Wadena tornado was part of the largest single day tornado outbreak in Minnesota state history, 48 tornados were recorded that day. The tornado that struck Wadena was over a mile wide at its peak, packed winds of up to 170 miles per hour, and was on the ground for about 10 miles. At least 232 homes were damaged in the city accounting for roughly 30% of homes in the city. Though no one in the town was killed, 34 people were treated for injuries at local hospitals. The Community Center was damaged &quot;beyond repair&quot;, and the high school was also severely damaged. Both were later torn down and rebuilt. The city continues to recover with roughly 20 lots abandoned throughout the city. City officials are encouraging rebuilding by offering tax free land incentives. The Wadena Tornado was covered extensively on the December 1, 2010, episode of the Discovery Channel series &quot;Storm Chasers&quot;.

In the aftermath of the tornado, students from the high school attended classes at the Wadena campus of Minnesota State Community and Technical College, at a school that was previously no longer in use in nearby Deer Creek (Deer Creek having consolidated with Wadena in 1991), and at the Wadena Elementary School. In order to accommodate the high school students, some early childhood classes at the Elementary School were further moved to Saint Ann&#x27;s Catholic School. Outdoor athletics were largely unaffected, but home volleyball and basketball games were played in the Elementary School gymnasium. In fall of 2012, a new Middle-High School was opened.

<doc id="150644" wikidata="Q1986513" url="?curid=150644" title="White Bear Lake, Minnesota">
<text>White Bear Lake is a city in Ramsey County in the state of Minnesota, United States. A small portion of the city also extends into Washington County. The population was 24,883 at the 2020 census. The city is located on White Bear Lake, one of the largest lakes in the Minneapolis–Saint Paul metropolitan area. The lake is a large lake that is home to many different species of fish including largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, northern pike, and a variety of other species.

==Origin of name==
The city is named after its largest lake, White Bear Lake. American writers have delivered differing versions of the legend that explains the origin of the name. In her book &quot;Indian Legends of Minnesota&quot;, Mrs. Carl T. Thayer writes that &quot;It is said that a Sioux maiden fell in love with a Chippewa brave. She, the daughter of the Chief, on learning that her father planned war against the Chippewa, ran to her lover and warned him. The brave went alone into the Sioux village to ask for peace and the hand of the maiden. Before the Chief would agree, the Chippewa would have to do a brave deed.&quot;
&quot;The lovers usually met on Manitou Island. One day, as the brave approached the Island, anticipating a meeting with his beloved, he saw, to his horror, a great white bear attacking her. He dashed to her rescue. Freed, she ran to get help from her father and the other Sioux. Returning, they saw the brave sink his knife into the bear. But too late, they both fell to the ground dead. Slowly, as they watched, the spirits of the brave and the bear rose from their prone bodies. It is said that even today, as night falls, the spirits of the bear and the brave wander the Island eternally in search of each other.&quot;
In Mark Twain&#x27;s memoir &quot;Life on the Mississippi&quot;, he offers a different ending, relaying that &quot;… the warrior, with one plunge of the blade of his knife, opened the crimson sluices of death, and the dying bear relaxed his hold. &quot;That night, there was no more sleep for the band or the lovers, and as the young and the old danced about the carcass of the dead monster, the gallant warrior was presented with another plume, and ere another moon had set he had a living treasure added to his heart. Their children for many years played upon the skin of the white bear – from which the lake derives its name, and the maiden and the brave remembered long the fearful scene and rescue that made them one, for Kis-se-me-pa and Ka-go-ga could never forget their fearful encounter with the huge monster that came so near sending them to the happy hunting ground.&quot;

==History==

The railroad was the largest man-made happening in White Bear Lake. On September 10, 1868, the Lake Superior and Mississippi Railroad officially opened the extension to White Bear Lake. This was a gala occasion. Ten platform cars of 300 men and four passenger cars for 200 ladies made the trip from St. Paul.

By 1874, Mark Twain had included White Bear Lake as the resort in his &quot;Life on the Mississippi.&quot; The &quot;American Travelers Journal&quot; 1881 proclaimed, &quot;One of the most popular resorts in the magic northlands is White Bear Lake.&quot; Barnum&#x27;s hotel became the Leip House, featuring a ballroom, billiard room, dancing pavilion, bowling alley, and boats. F.C. Williams opened the Williams House on the Murray property on Lake Avenue. James Waters opened the White Bear House at the depot. In 1879, the Ramaley Pavilion was opened and described as &quot;perhaps the finest structure around the lake&quot; (Breeze 1890). There was Lake Side Cottage on Lake north of 6th and &quot;Château gay.&quot; Shady Side, Bachelor&#x27;s Rest and Hotel Benson were three of the resorts at Bald Eagle Lake.
The Cottage Park summer residents built a club house in 1881 where they had their meals, entertainment and social life. In 1881, the Manitou Implement Co. developed the Island for cottages with the added important feature of water works. The &quot;Fillebrown&quot; house on Lake Avenue was built in 1879 by C.P. Noyes. It was purchased in 1881 by Judge George Young and in 1905 purchased by the J. Walter Fillebrown family who donated the house to the White Bear Lake Area Historical Society in the 1970s.

The City of White Bear Lake was incorporated on October 11, 1921.

In 1940, Nellie Geraldine Best painted a tempera mural, &quot;Early Voyageurs at Portage&quot;, as part of the WPA&#x27;s nationwide mural project for the post office in White Bear Lake, Minnesota. The location of this mural is unknown. It may have been removed during a post office remodeling.

White Bear Lake High School and Mariner High School merged in 1983 to form White Bear Lake Area High School. There are still two buildings, the North Campus and South Campus, which are now White Bear Lake High School (North Campus building) and Mariner Middle School (South Campus building). North Campus (White Bear Lake High School) held classes for freshman and sophomores while South Campus (the former Mariner High School) held classes for juniors and seniors. The two buildings had a combined total of about 3,000 students.

The murder of three-year-old Dennis Jurgens in 1965 at the hands of his adoptive mother, Lois Jurgens, was arguably the biggest scandal to hit the town with her conviction in 1987. The story was recounted in Barry Siegel&#x27;s true crime novel &quot;A Death in White Bear Lake.&quot;

In 1953, the Lakeshore Players Community Theater was organized. Lakeshore Players formerly operated out of a former church building constructed in 1889, at 4820 Stewart Avenue. In 2018 they moved to a new building in 2018 next to the White Bear Center for the Arts.

The &quot;White Bear Center for the Arts&quot; was officially organized on May 16, 1968 and moved to their new location at 4971 Long Avenue in the fall of 2013.

The White Bear Lake Area Historical Society was incorporated on September 25, 1970 and gathers, preserves and shares the stories of the five communities that touch the shore of White Bear Lake – Birchwood, Dellwood, Mahtomedi, White Bear Lake, and White Bear Township.

<text>Redwood Falls is a city in Redwood County, located along the Redwood River near its confluence with the Minnesota River, in the U.S. state of Minnesota. The population was 5,102 at the 2020 census. It is the county seat.

==History==
As the immigrant and the Euro-American population of the North American east coast region grew, population pressures affected people far inland. People moved west to find new homes as more and more land was used by farmers. The Minnesota area is the ancestral homeland of the several Dakota peoples, who consisted of the loosely confederated &quot;Oceti sakowin&quot; (Seven Council Fires). By 1700, Ojibwe, who spoke an Anishinaabe language, had also come to what is now Minnesota from the further east around the Great Lakes. At times they came into conflict with the Dakota over land and resources and began to push them to the west.

===19th century===

By the mid-19th century, the traditional Dakota yearly cycle of farming, hunting, fishing, and gathering wild rice had been disrupted by cultural changes. Permanent farms were established by European-American settlers, changing habitat. In addition, they removed forests in eastern Minnesota for timber and to develop farmland. Wild game such as bison, elk, whitetail deer, and bear had been hunted so intensively that populations were much reduced compared to the centuries before Euro-American settlement. Dakota people relied on the sale of valuable furs to American traders to earn cash needed to buy necessities.

To encourage the Dakota to bring in more furs, traders offered merchandise on credit. It is not clear that the Dakota well understood the concept of credit, but they grew to depend on trade goods for metal tools and other items.

Pressure from traders who wanted to be paid and concern from government officials about the ability of the Dakota to earn the money they needed, led to the 1851 Treaty of Traverse des Sioux. The federal government wanted to extinguish Native American land title to tracts of land and offered the people annuities of money and goods in exchange. The Dakota agreed to live on a twenty-mile-wide reservation centered on a 75-mile stretch of the upper Minnesota River. Annuity payments for the Dakota were late in the summer of 1862, an example of a pattern of poor delivery of payments and supplies to them.

The site of the future town of Redwood Falls was within the Dakota reservation area along the lower Minnesota River. The war of 1862 was a small segment in Sioux history of conflict with European Americans. Corruption and malfeasance by the Bureau of Indian Affairs resulted in delays of payments of annuities and supplies of promised supplies, causing great hardships for the Dakota. In addition, they struggled with the effects of the relocation and inability to adjust to settled subsistence farming.

An August 4, 1862 confrontation between soldiers and Dakota men led the Indian Agency near Granite Falls to distribute provisions to the tribe on credit to avoid violence. At the Lower Agency at Redwood, however, things were handled differently. At an August 15, 1862 meeting attended by Dakota representatives, Indian Agent Thomas Galbraith, and representatives of the traders, the traders resisted pleas to distributing provisions held in agency warehouses to starving Dakota until the annuity payments arrived. In 1862, U.S. officials in Minnesota were distracted by the U.S. Civil War, payments did not arrive, and the suffering of the Dakota was severe. Some young Dakota took action to claim what they were owed, killing several people in the process. This began the Dakota War of 1862.

As a result of the war, the U.S. government hanged 38 participants and attempted to expel the Dakota people from Minnesota altogether. But it ended up maintaining the Lower Sioux Indian Reservation in Redwood County. Over time, the Dakota lost control of much of the land first set aside in 1851.

In 1864, Sam McPhail, a colonel who had commanded US troops in the war and was a land speculator, claimed the land where Redwood Falls was developed. He hired men to use lumber from the Dakota reservation to build a fortified house and surrounded it with a sod stockade eight feet tall. McPhail published the &quot;Redwood Falls Patriot&quot; from 1866 to 1869. He was a probate judge and first Redwood County attorney. In 1872, he donated land for the county courthouse as Redwood Falls was designated as the county seat.

Among settlers who joined McPhail in 1864 was John St. George Honner. Honner claimed land north of Redwood Falls. The house he built in 1869 still stands in North Redwood and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Honner was appointed as the first postmaster and also served as a county official. Active in electoral politics, he served as a representative and later as a senator in the state legislature between 1866 and 1874. Honner operated a granite quarry near North Redwood and supplied the stone for the county courthouse.

===20th century to present===
After World War II, Redwood Falls was home to the Minnesota Inventors Congress. Started in 1958 to encourage innovation and entrepreneurship and attract industry to town, MIC held a juried exhibition each year. It also sponsored a contest for student inventors and a parade for the city. After a 58-year run, the MIC was ended in 2014 due to a lack of funding.

The city of Redwood Falls took over Alexander Ramsey Park in 1958 from the state of Minnesota. Ramsey had been one of the least used and least developed state parks. It has been improved as the largest municipal park in Minnesota.

The cities of North Redwood and Redwood Falls merged in 1996; they are now known as the single entity, Redwood Falls. In 2010 Native Americans composed more than 6% of the population in the city.

<text>Crosby is a town in Amite and Wilkinson counties, Mississippi, United States. It is part of the McComb, Mississippi micropolitan statistical area. Its population was 242 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Crosby was originally named Dayton in 1884, as a tribute to landowner David Day, who provided a right-of-way for the Yazoo and Mississippi Valley Railroad (Y&amp;MV). In 1900, the population of Dayton was 30.

By 1916, the Foster Creek Lumber Company had acquired around of timberland in Wilkinson and Amite Counties, which included Dayton. At that time, two Stephenson brothers from Michigan were building several sawmills in south Mississippi and purchased the Foster Creek Lumber Company landholdings. The Stephenson brothers had a new sawmill constructed as well as a new town that included modern homes, a commissary, and post office near the Y&amp;MV railroad. The old town of Dayton was moved to the new town which was renamed Stephenson. By July 1917, the sawmill was completed and started processing lumber. Because the Stephenson brothers were most interested in building sawmills rather than operating them, they sold their interest in the Foster Creek Lumber and Manufacturing Company in 1918.

The Foster Creek Lumber Company sawmill at Stephenson continued to operate through the 1920s. Because the company was heavily mortgaged, it was negatively impacted by the Great Depression in 1929, and the sawmill closed in 1931.

In January 1934, L.O.

<text>Shaw is a city in Bolivar and Sunflower counties, Mississippi, United States, located in the Mississippi Delta region. The name was derived from an old Indian tribe northeast of this region. The population was 1,952 at the 2010 census.

==History==
On June 30, 1914, Jack Farmer, an African-American resident of Shaw, was being sought by a white posse for allegedly murdering Earl Chase, a white man, also a resident of Shaw. Two deaths took place during the intense search: Jennie Collins, an African-American woman thought to have assisted Farmer in his flight, and James Jolly, a member of the posse who was mistaken for Farmer in the darkness. Both were shot and killed as the posse swept through a local swamp where Farmer was believed to be hiding. Farmer was never located.

Shaw gained national attention in 1971 when a group of local residents led by Andrew Hawkins sued the town for violating their Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection under the law. In &quot;Hawkins v. Town of Shaw&quot;, the residents claimed the town had discriminated against black neighborhoods in the way it distributed public services, noting that while 99 percent of homes occupied by whites had access to sewers, only 80 percent of black-occupied homes had sewer access. Water pressure was also lower in black neighborhoods. The Fifth Circuit Court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, and ordered Shaw to equalize access to public services such as fire hydrants, water mains, lighting, sewers and street paving. The ruling was considered a watershed civil rights victory, with some commentators comparing it to &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;. However, the case did not encourage a wave of similar lawsuits in other jurisdictions.

==Geography==
Shaw is almost entirely in Bolivar County, with a small portion extending east into adjacent Sunflower County. In the 2000 census, all of the city&#x27;s 2,313 residents lived in Bolivar County.

<text>Baldwyn is a city in Lee and Prentiss counties, Mississippi, United States. It is located in the northern part of the Tupelo micropolitan area. Founded in 1860, the population was 3,071 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Located five miles north of Guntown, the main street of Baldwyn runs along the county line of Lee and Prentiss counties. It has the unusual distinction of having been incorporated in four counties.

Lee county was formed from parts of Itawamba and Pontotoc on October 26, 1866, while Tishomingo was divided into Alcorn, Prentiss, and Tishomingo on April 15, 1870.

Baldwyn is an outgrowth of the village of Carrollville: when the Mobile and Ohio Railroad was being built during the years of 1848 to 1861, it missed Carrollville by one and one-half miles and the citizens moved to the new town of Baldwyn, which was named for the civil engineer who surveyed the road through the town. Tishomingo, chief of the Chickasaw nation, lived at Carrollville but died near Little Rock, Arkansas, in 1839 of smallpox while being moved west with his tribe.

<text>The Columbia Symphony Orchestra was an orchestra formed by Columbia Records for the purpose of making recordings. In the 1950s, it provided a vehicle for some of Columbia&#x27;s better known conductors and recording artists to record using only company resources. The musicians in the orchestra were contracted as needed for individual sessions and consisted of free-lance artists and often members of either the New York Philharmonic or the Los Angeles Philharmonic, depending on whether the recording was being made in Columbia&#x27;s East Coast or West Coast studios.

==Early history==
Some of the first recordings featuring the Columbia Symphony Orchestra were made in New York in February 1913. Felix Weingartner made five acoustic sides in New York with the soprano Lucille Marcel (the third of his five marriages) Only one take was subsequently issued, &quot;Ave Maria&quot; from Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Otello&quot; on Columbia US A-5482, matrix number 36622. The other unissued takes included two of Weingartner&#x27;s own songs, &quot;Vergangenheit&quot; and &quot;Welke Rose&quot;, Schumann&#x27;s &quot;Die Lotosblume&quot;, op. 25, no. 7 and Olga von Radecki&#x27;s &quot;Frisches Grun&quot;.

Frank Bridge made a single (unissued) take of Grieg&#x27;s &quot;Shepherd Boy&quot;, op. 54 with the orchestra for Columbia UK on matrix AX 268, in London on 14 December 1923.

The composer and conductor Robert Hood Bowers made around 15 double-sided 78 rpm recordings with the orchestra in September 1927.

During a recording session in March 1932 with Weingartner and the British Symphony Orchestra in London&#x27;s Westminster Central Hall, a single unissued take was made of the Waltz from Leo Delibes&#x27; ballet &quot;Naïla&quot;, although the conductor is unnamed.

Howard D. Barlow (May 1, 1892 – January 31, 1972) made a recording of Deems Taylor&#x27;s suite &quot;Through the Looking Glass&quot; with the Columbia Symphony Orchestra in New York in November 1938. Released on Columbia Masterworks set M-350.

==Conductors==
Over the decades, several noted conductors and soloists collaborated with the Columbia Symphony Orchestra including:

===Alfredo Antonini===
From 1941 until 1971 Alfredo Antonini also served as a principal conductor of the CBS Symphony Orchestra while collaborating with noted soloists including Richard Tucker. In 1972 he was cited with an Emmy Award for conducting the orchestra in the television premier of Ezra Laderman&#x27;s opera &quot;And David Wept.&quot; 

===Howard Barlow===
in the later part of the 1930s, Howard Barlow joined forces with the orchestra which was known at the time as the CBS Symphony Orchestra within the Columbia Broadcasting System. Together, they recorded Deems Taylor&#x27;s &quot;Through the Looking Glass Suite&quot;, Op. 12. By 1940, they joined forces once again in a recording of Bach&#x27;s Air on the G String from the Suite No. 3 for Orchestra and the Bouree from Bach&#x27;s Suite No. 3 for Unaccompanied Cello. Additional recordings with the orchestra included: Franz Schubert&#x27;s Symphony No. 2 in B flat major, D. 125 and selections from Engelbert Humperdinck&#x27;s &quot;Hansel und Gretel Suite&quot;.

===Thomas Beecham===
In 1949, Sir Thomas Beecham made a series of recordings in Columbia Records&#x27; 30th Street Studios in New York City with a completely different pickup group, which was also called the Columbia Symphony Orchestra. Later reissued by Sony on CD, the recordings include &quot;Dance of the Hours&quot; from the opera &quot;La Gioconda&quot; by Amilcare Ponchielli, the overture to &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot; by Otto Nicolai, &quot;Carmen Suite&quot; by Georges Bizet, and &quot;Capriccio Italien&quot; by Peter Tchaikovsky.

===Leonard Bernstein===

Leonard Bernstein conducted the orchestra and also played the piano solos, in Maurice Ravel&#x27;s Piano Concerto in G and George Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot;. These were released by Columbia in stereo on LP and later reissued by Sony on CD. In addition, Bernstein also joined forces with the orchestra in collaboration with Glenn Gould in a performance of Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 2 in B Flat Major, Op. 19 and Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s Keyboard Concerto No. 1 in D Minor, BWV 1052 for Columbia Masterworks in 1957

===Fausto Cleva===
During his tenure at the Metropolitan Opera in 1959, Fausto Cleva led the Columbia Symphony Orchestra and the noted tenor Richard Tucker in a recording of several popular arias by Giacomo Puccini.

===Aaron Copland===
In the early 1960s, the composer Aaron Copland joined forces with the swing clarinetist Benny Goodman and the concert bass-baritone William Warfield to record his Clarinet Concerto along with his arrangement of &quot;Old American Songs&quot; in collaboration with the Columbia Symphony Orchestra.

===Robert Craft===
From 1955 onwards, he made many recordings with the CSO, in CBS-projects that were intended to record the Second Viennese School for the first time integrally. In this period, Robert Craft also produced most of the Varèse works with the Columbia Ensemble.

===Vladimir Golschmann===
Vladimir Golschmann also collaborated with the Columbia Symphony Orchestra in several historic recordings with the young pianist Glenn Gould. Included among their collaborations were recordings of Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s Keyboard Concerti: No. 2, No. 3, No. 4, No. 5 &amp; No. 7, as well as the Beethoven Piano Concerto No. 1 during the 1950s.

===Alexander Schneider===
Alexander Schneider paired with Rudolf Serkin and the Columbia Symphony Orchestra during the 1950s in a recording of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart&#x27;s: Piano Concerto No. 21 in C major, K. 467 and Piano Concerto No. 27 in B flat major, K. 595.

===Igor Stravinsky===
Igor Stravinsky made many recordings of his own compositions with an incarnation of this orchestra, mainly musicians from the Los Angeles Festival Orchestra founded by Franz Waxman. Among the works in which Stravinsky conducted the orchestra are &quot;Apollon musagète&quot;; &quot;Le baiser de la fée&quot;; &quot;The Firebird&quot; – suite and complete ballet; Mass; &quot;Mavra&quot;; &quot;Les noces&quot;; &quot;Orpheus&quot;; &quot;Perséphone&quot;; &quot;Petrushka&quot; – suite and complete ballet; &quot;Pulcinella&quot; – suite and complete ballet; &quot;The Rake&#x27;s Progress&quot;; &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot;; the Symphony in E flat; the Symphony in Three Movements and the Violin Concerto; as well as several shorter pieces.

In 1977, a recording of the Columbia Symphony Orchestra playing the &quot;Sacrificial Dance&quot; from &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot;, conducted by Stravinsky, was selected by NASA to be included on the Voyager Golden Record, a gold-plated copper record that was sent into space on the Voyager space craft. The record contained sounds and images which had been selected as examples of the diversity of life and culture on Earth.

===George Szell===
In the 1960s George Szell also joined forces with the Columbia Symphony Orchestra and Robert Casadesus for a recording of several piano concertos by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart including: Concerto No. 22 in E flat major, K. 482 and Concerto No. 23 in A major, K. 488 for Columbia Masterworks (ML5594, 1960).

===Bruno Walter===
Among the best-known recordings the orchestra made were with the conductor Bruno Walter, who recorded interpretations of Beethoven, Brahms, Bruckner, Mahler and Mozart symphonies. With this orchestra, Walter made his only stereo recording of Mahler&#x27;s Symphony No. 9, which he had conducted at its world premiere.

==Other recordings==
The term Columbia Symphony Orchestra was also used when, for contractual reasons, another orchestra could not appear under its own name. Many Los Angeles Philharmonic musicians also played under the Columbia Symphony name, and some reports mention that the entire Philharmonic frequently played as the Columbia Symphony when recorded on the west coast.

==CBS Symphony Orchestra==
There was also the Columbia Broadcasting Symphony Orchestra, sometimes called the CBS Symphony Orchestra. This group was formed to perform on CBS Radio broadcasts and also made 78-rpm recordings for Columbia Records during the 1940s. It was frequently conducted by Howard Barlow, who later became the music director of &quot;The Voice of Firestone&quot; radio and television programs. One of the Columbia Records releases by the CBS Symphony with Barlow conducting was the &quot;Indian Suites&quot; by Edward MacDowell, recorded on May 15, 1939; this recording can be heard on YouTube. The composer Bernard Herrmann conducted the orchestra for some broadcasts, especially &quot;The Mercury Theatre on the Air&quot; and &quot;The Campbell Playhouse&quot; programs presented by Orson Welles. 

==Columbia Concert Orchestra==

In addition, CBS&#x27; Columbia Concert Orchestra recorded both classical and popular music for Columbia Masterworks in the 1920s-1950s. Live concerts by the orchestra were also broadcast throughout the United States and to South America via shortwave radio over the International Radio Station WCBX in New York City and the International Radio Station WCAB in Philadelphia from 1939-1940 during World War II. Included among the noted collaborators were such operatic luminaries as: Eileen Farrell, Lily Pons, Paul Robeson and Richard Tucker under the direction of several conductors including: Alfredo Antonini, Emanuel Balaban, Howard Barlow, Bernard Herrmann, Andre Kostelanetz, Charles Lichter and Alexander Semmler.

<text>Sherman is a town which straddles Lee, Pontotoc, and Union counties in Mississippi. The population was 600 at the 2020 census.

==History==
In 1840 Reuben Jones and John Witt settled what is now the Sherman community fourteen miles northeast of Pontotoc, however the town owes its formation and growth to the building of the old Kansas City, Memphis and Birmingham Railroad. When the operation of trains was begun on the newly built railroad in 1886 a station was established and named Sherman by a resident who had formerly lived in Sherman, Texas. R.P. Kelly built the first home in the spring of 1886. Other citizens and businessmen of the town were John Witt, J.E. Wade, and John Johnson.

The Mississippi Normal Institute was founded in 1889 by Professor J.N. Davis and a boarding house was maintained in connection with the institute. The institute flourished for several years with an enrollment of 300 but with the development of the public school system its patronage dwindled and about 1903 it was consolidated with the public school at Sherman.

The following excerpt from the &quot;Pontotoc Democrat&quot; of September 19, 1890, describes the town: &quot;Ninety-four miles from Memphis, 158 miles from Birmingham on the K C M &amp; B Railroad is the thriving little town of Sherman. Her population has almost doubled in the last twelve months. She is surrounded by the best fanning lands in the State. She has 35 dwellings, 6 stores, 2 doctors, no graveyards, a ~40,000 school building and destined to be the Jupiter in the educational world.”

<doc id="150695" wikidata="Q208331" url="?curid=150695" title="Saint Olaf">
<text>Saint Olaf ( – 29 July 1030), also called Olaf the Holy, Olaf II, Olaf Haraldsson, and Olaf the Stout, was King of Norway from 1015 to 1028. Son of Harald Grenske, a petty king in Vestfold, Norway, he was posthumously given the title &quot;Rex Perpetuus Norvegiae&quot; () and canonised at Nidaros (Trondheim) by Bishop Grimketel, one year after his death in the Battle of Stiklestad on 29 July 1030. His remains were enshrined in Nidaros Cathedral, built over his burial site. His sainthood encouraged the widespread adoption of Christianity by Scandinavia&#x27;s Vikings/Norsemen.

Pope Alexander III confirmed Olaf&#x27;s local canonisation in 1164, making him a recognised saint of the Catholic Church, and Olaf started to be known as &quot;Rex Perpetuus Norvegiae&quot; – &quot;eternal king of Norway&quot;. Following the Reformation, he was a commemorated historical figure among some members of the Lutheran and Anglican Communions.

The saga of Olav Haraldsson and the legend of Olaf the Saint became central to a national identity. Especially during the period of romantic nationalism, Olaf was a symbol of Norwegian independence and pride. Saint Olaf is symbolised by the axe in Norway&#x27;s coat of arms and Olsok (29 July) is still his day of celebration. Many Christian institutions with Scandinavian links as well as Norway&#x27;s Order of St. Olav are named after him.

== Name ==
Olaf&#x27;s Old Norse name is &quot;Óláfr Haraldsson&quot; . During his lifetime he was known as Olaf &quot;the fat&quot; or &quot;the stout&quot; or simply as Olaf &quot;the big&quot; (&quot;Ólafr digri&quot; ; Modern Norwegian &quot;Olav Digre&quot;). He was also called Olaf &#x27;the Lawbreaker&#x27; for his many brutal ways of converting the Norwegian populace. In modern Norway he is commonly called &quot;Olav den hellige&quot; (Bokmål; Olaf the Holy) or &quot;Heilag-Olav&quot; (Nynorsk; the Holy Olaf) in recognition of his sainthood.

Olaf Haraldsson had the given name &quot;Óláfr&quot; in Old Norse (etymology: &quot;Anu-&quot; &quot;forefather&quot;, -laibaR &quot;—&quot;&quot;heir&quot;). &quot;Olav&quot; is the modern equivalent in Norwegian, formerly often spelt &quot;Olaf&quot;. His name in Icelandic is &quot;Ólafur&quot; , in Faroese &quot;Ólavur&quot;, in Danish &quot;Olav&quot;, in Swedish &quot;Olof&quot;, and in Finnish &quot;Olavi&quot;. Olave was the traditional spelling in England, preserved in the name of medieval churches dedicated to him. Other names, such as &quot;Óláfr hinn helgi&quot;, &quot;Olavus rex&quot;, and Olaf are used interchangeably (see the &quot;Heimskringla&quot; of Snorri Sturluson). He is sometimes called &quot;Rex Perpetuus Norvegiae&quot; (), a designation which goes back to the 13th century.

== Background ==
Olaf Haraldsson is attested having been born in Ringerike, yet Ringerike must not be conflated with the modern notion of the district named after the legendary Ringerike of Ivar Vidfamne and Sigurd Hring, which may be regarded as the confederation of five petty kingdoms conferring with the five kings that established Olaf Haraldson as their High King at Hringsakri according to Saint Olafs Saga, King Hrœrekr, King Guðrøðr, King Hring and two others of less certain identity. Olaf Haraldsson did not become King of Norway until the Battle of Nesjar. 

Olaf Haraldsson was the son of Åsta Gudbrandsdatter and Harald Grenske, a petty king in Vestfold. According to later Icelandic sagas, Harald Grenske was the son of Gudrød Bjørnsson, son of King Bjørn Farmann in Vestfold, who was in turn son of King Harald I Fairhair Halvdansson. The latter had unified Norway as one Kingdom, establishing a feudalist structure with the kingship far less dependent on local rulers. Thus, according to the sagas, Olaf was a great-great-grandson in the male line of the founder of the Norwegian kingdom. Harald Grenske died when Åsta Gudbrandsdatter was pregnant with Olaf. Åsta later married Sigurd Syr, with whom she had other children, including Harald Hardrada, who later reigned as king of Norway. 

The petty kings of Ringerike seem to have had some claims to the High Kingship of the Commonwealth of Uppsala posing a possible threat to the royal House of Munsö under King Olof Skötkonung. The Earls of Hlaðir and the petty kings of Hringerike had been in conflict since at least King Harald Fairhair assumed power of all of Norway.

Many texts have information about Olaf Haraldsson. The oldest is the &quot;Glælognskviða&quot; or &quot;Sea-Calm Poem&quot;, composed by Þórarinn loftunga, an Icelander. It praises Olaf and mentions some of the famous miracles attributed to him. The Norwegian synoptic histories also mention Olaf. These include the (), the &quot;Historia Norwegiae&quot; (–1175) and a Latin text, &quot;Historia de Antiquitate Regum Norwagiensium&quot; by Theodoric the Monk (–1188).

Icelanders also wrote extensively about Olaf and there are several Icelandic sagas about him, including &quot;Fagrskinna&quot; () and &quot;Morkinskinna&quot; (). &quot;Heimskringla&quot; (), by Snorri Sturluson, largely bases its account of Olaf on the earlier &quot;Fagrskinna&quot;. The sources seem to say that he had been raised in the Norse pagan religion, but converted to Christ early in his adulthood. The &quot;Oldest Saga of St. Olaf&quot; () is important to scholars for its constant use of skaldic verses, many of which are attributed to Olaf himself.

Finally, many hagiographic sources describe St. Olaf, but these focus mostly on miracles attributed to him and cannot be used to accurately recreate his life. A notable one is &quot;The Passion and the Miracles of the Blessed Olafr&quot;.

== Reign ==

A widely used account of Olaf&#x27;s life is found in &quot;Heimskringla&quot; from . Although its facts are dubious, the saga recounts Olaf&#x27;s deeds as follows:
 In 1008, Olaf landed on the Estonian island of Saaremaa (Osilia). The Osilians, taken by surprise, had at first agreed to Olaf&#x27;s demands, but then gathered an army during the negotiations and attacked the Norwegians. Olaf nevertheless won the battle.

It is said that Olaf participated alongside fellow Viking Thorkell the Tall in the siege of Canterbury in 1011.

Olaf sailed to the southern coast of Finland sometime in 1008. The journey resulted in the Battle at Herdaler, where Olaf and his men were ambushed by the Finns in the woods. Olaf lost many men but made it back to his boats. He ordered his ships to depart despite a rising storm. The Finns pursued them and made the same progress on land as Olaf and his men made on water. Despite these events they survived. The exact location of the battle is uncertain and the Finnish equivalent of Herdaler is unknown, but it has been suggested that it could be in Uusimaa, probably near present-day Ingå.

As a teenager Olaf went to the Baltic, then to Denmark and later to England. Skaldic poetry suggests he led a successful seaborne attack that took down London Bridge, though Anglo-Saxon sources do not confirm this. This may have been in 1014, restoring London and the English throne to Æthelred the Unready and removing Cnut. According to Snorri&#x27;s Heimskringla, the attack happened soon after the death of Sweyn Forkbeard with the city being held by Danish forces. Snorri&#x27;s account claims that Olaf assisted Æthelred in driving the Danes out of England. Olaf is also said by Snorri to have aided the sons of Æthelred after his death. Olaf is said to have won battles but been unable to assist Æthelred&#x27;s sons in driving Cnut out. After this, he set his sights on Norway.

Olaf saw it as his calling to unite Norway into one kingdom, as Harald Fairhair had largely succeeded in doing. On the way home he wintered with Duke Richard II of Normandy. Marauding Vikings had conquered this region in 881. Richard was himself an ardent Christian, and the Normans had also previously converted to Christianity. Before leaving, Olaf was baptised in Rouen in the pre-Romanesque Notre-Dame Cathedral by Richard&#x27;s brother Robert the Dane, archbishop of Normandy.

Olaf returned to Norway in 1015 and declared himself king, obtaining the support of the five petty kings of the Norwegian Uplands. In 1016 at the Battle of Nesjar he defeated Earl Sweyn, one of the earls of Lade and hitherto the &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of Norway. He founded the town of Borg, later known as Sarpsborg, by the waterfall Sarpsfossen in Østfold county. Within a few years he had won more power than any of his predecessors on the throne had enjoyed.

Olaf annihilated the petty kings of the south, subdued the aristocracy, asserted his suzerainty in the Orkney Islands, and conducted a successful raid on Denmark. He made peace with King Olof Skötkonung of Sweden through Þorgnýr the Lawspeaker, and was for some time engaged to Olof&#x27;s daughter, Ingegerd, though without Olof&#x27;s approval. In 1019 Olaf married Astrid Olofsdotter, King Olof&#x27;s illegitimate daughter and the half-sister of his former fiancée. The union produced a daughter, Wulfhild, who married Ordulf, Duke of Saxony in 1042.

In 1026 he participated in the Battle of the Helgeå. In 1029 the Norwegian nobles, seething with discontent, supported the invasion of King Cnut the Great of Denmark. Olaf was driven into exile in Kievan Rus. He stayed for some time in the Swedish province of Nerike, where, according to local legend, he baptised many locals. In 1029, King Cnut&#x27;s Norwegian regent, Jarl Håkon Eiriksson, was lost at sea and Olaf seized the opportunity to win back the kingdom. Given military and logistical support by the Swedish king Anund Jacob he tried to bypass the formidable &quot;Øresundfleet&quot; of the Danish king by traveling across the Jämtland-mountains to take Nidaros, the Norwegian capital at the time, in 1030. However, Olaf was killed in Battle of Stiklestad on 29 July 1030, where some of his own subjects from central and northern Norway took arms against him. The exact position of Saint Olaf&#x27;s grave in Nidaros has been unknown since 1568, due to the effects of the Lutheran iconoclasm in 1536–37.

King Cnut, though distracted by the task of governing England, ruled Norway for five years after Stiklestad, with his son Svein and Svein&#x27;s mother Ælfgifu (known as &quot;Álfífa&quot; in Old Norse sources) as regents. But their regency was unpopular, and when Olaf&#x27;s illegitimate son Magnus (&#x27;the Good&#x27;) laid claim to the Norwegian throne, Svein and Ælfgifu were forced to flee.

== Christianising ==
Olaf has traditionally been seen as leading the Christianisation of Norway, but most scholars of the period now believe that Olaf had little to do with the process. Olaf brought with him Grimketel, who is usually credited with helping him create episcopal sees and further organising the Norwegian church, but Grimketel was only a member of Olaf&#x27;s household and no permanent sees were created until c. 1100. Also, Olaf and Grimketel most likely did not introduce new ecclesiastical laws to Norway; these were ascribed to Olaf at a later date. Olaf most likely did try to bring Christianity to the interior of Norway, where it was less prevalent.

Questions have also been raised about the nature of Olaf&#x27;s Christianity. Modern historians generally agree that Olaf was inclined to violence and brutality, and note that earlier scholars often neglected this side of his character. It seems that, like many Scandinavian kings, Olaf used his Christianity to gain more power for the monarchy and centralise control in Norway. The skaldic verses attributed to Olaf do not speak of Christianity at all, but use pagan references to describe romantic relationships.

In his book &quot;The Conversion of Scandinavia&quot;, Anders Winroth argues that there was a &quot;long process of assimilation, in which the Scandinavians adopted, one by one and over time, individual Christian practices.&quot; Winroth does not claim that Olaf was not Christian, but argues that we cannot think of any Scandinavians as fully converting as portrayed in the later hagiographies or sagas. Olaf himself is portrayed in later sources as a saintly miracle-working figure to help support this quick view of conversion for Norway, but the historical Olaf did not act this way, as seen especially in the skaldic verses attributed to him.

== Sainthood ==

Olaf swiftly became Norway&#x27;s patron saint; Bishop Grimketel performed his canonisation only a year after his death. The cult of Olaf unified the country and consolidated the Christianisation of Norway. He is also recognized as the patron saint of the Faroe Islands.

Owing to Olaf&#x27;s later status as Norway&#x27;s patron saint, and to his importance in later medieval historiography and in Norwegian folklore, it is difficult to assess the historical Olaf&#x27;s character. Judging from the bare outlines of known historical facts, he appears to have been a fairly unsuccessful ruler, whose power was based on an alliance with the much more powerful King Cnut the Great; who was driven into exile when he claimed power of his own; and whose attempt at a reconquest was swiftly crushed.

This calls for an explanation of the status he gained after his death. Three factors are important: the later myth surrounding his role in the Christianisation of Norway, the various dynastic relationships among the ruling families, and the need for legitimisation in a later period.

=== Conversion of Norway ===
Olaf Haraldsson and Olaf Tryggvason (Olaf Haraldsson&#x27;s godfather) are both traditionally regarded as the driving forces behind Norway&#x27;s final conversion to Christianity. But large stone crosses and other Christian symbols suggest that at least Norway&#x27;s coastal areas were deeply influenced by Christianity long before Olaf&#x27;s time; with one exception, all of Norway&#x27;s rulers since Håkon the Good (c. 920–961) were Christians (however Håkon later reverted to Heathenism as an apostate ), as was Olaf&#x27;s main opponent, Cnut the Great. What seems clear is that Olaf made efforts to establish a church organization on a broader scale than before, among other things by importing bishops from England, Normandy and Germany, and that he tried to enforce Christianity in the inland areas, which had the least communication with the rest of Europe, and which economically were more strongly based on agriculture, so that the inclination to hold on to the former fertility cult was stronger than in the more diversified and expansive western parts of Norway.

Many believe Olaf introduced Christian law into Norway in 1024, based upon the Kuli stone, but this stone is hard to interpret. The codification of Christianity as the legal religion of Norway was attributed to Olaf, and his legal arrangements for the Church of Norway came to stand so high in the Norwegian people&#x27;s and clergy&#x27;s eyes that when Pope Gregory VII attempted to make clerical celibacy binding on the priests of Western Europe in 1074–75, Norwegians largely ignored it, since there was no mention of clerical celibacy in Olaf&#x27;s legal code for their church. Only after Norway was made a metropolitan province with its own archbishop in 1153—making the Norwegian church, on the one hand, more independent of its king, but on the other hand, more directly responsible to the Pope—did canon law gain a greater prominence in the life and jurisdiction of the Norwegian church.

=== Olaf&#x27;s dynasty ===
For various reasons, most importantly the death of King Cnut the Great in 1035 but perhaps also a certain discontent among Norwegian nobles with Danish rule in the years after Olaf&#x27;s death in 1030, Olaf&#x27;s illegitimate son with the concubine Alvhild, Magnus the Good, assumed power in Norway, and eventually also in Denmark. Numerous Danish churches were dedicated to Olaf during his reign, and the sagas give glimpses of the young king&#x27;s efforts to promote the cult of his deceased father. This became typical of Scandinavian monarchies. In pagan times, Scandinavian kings derived their right to rule from their claims of descent from the Norse god Odin, or in the case of the kings of the Swedes at Old Uppsala, from Freyr. In Christian times this legitimation of a dynasty&#x27;s right to rule and its national prestige was based on its descent from a saintly king. Thus the kings of Norway promoted the cult of St. Olaf, the kings of Sweden the cult of St. Erik and the kings of Denmark the cult of Saint Canute, just as in England the Norman and Plantagenet kings promoted the cult of St. Edward the Confessor at Westminster Abbey, their coronation church.

=== Saint Olaf ===
==== Liturgical cult ====


Sigrid Undset noted that Olaf was baptised in Rouen, the capital of Normandy, and suggested that Olaf may have used priests of Norman descent for his missionaries. Normans were somewhat familiar with the culture of the people they were to convert and in some cases may have been able to understand the language. Among the bishops Olaf is known to have brought with him from England was Grimketel (). He was probably the only one of the missionary bishops left in the country at the time of Olaf&#x27;s death, and he stood behind the translation and beatification of Olaf on 3 August 1031. Grimketel later became the first bishop of Sigtuna in Sweden.

At this time, local bishops and their people recognised and proclaimed a person a saint, and a formal canonisation procedure through the papal curia was not customary; in Olaf&#x27;s case, this did not happen until 1888. But Olaf II died before the East-West Schism and a strict Roman Rite was not well-established in Scandinavia at the time. He is also venerated in the Eastern Orthodox Church.

Grimketel was later appointed bishop in the diocese of Selsey in southeastern England. This is probably why the earliest traces of a liturgical cult of Olaf are found in England. An office, or prayer service, for Olaf is found in the so-called &quot;Leofric collectar&quot; (c. 1050), which Bishop Leofric of Exeter bequeathed in his last will and testament to Exeter Cathedral. This English cult seems to have been short-lived.

Writing around 1070, Adam of Bremen mentions pilgrimage to St. Olaf&#x27;s shrine in Nidaros, but this is the only firm trace we have of a cult of St. Olaf in Norway before the mid-12th century. By this time he was also being called &quot;Norway&#x27;s Eternal King&quot;. In 1152/3, Nidaros was separated from Lund as the archbishopric of Nidaros. It is likely that whatever formal or informal veneration of Olaf as a saint may have existed in Nidaros before that was emphasised and formalised on this occasion.

Miracles performed by St. Olaf appear for the first time in Þórarinn loftunga&#x27;s skaldic poem &quot;Glælognskviða&quot;, or &quot;Sea-Calm Poem&quot;, from about 1030–34. One is the killing and throwing onto a mountain of a sea serpent still visible on the cliffside. Another took place on the day of his death, when a blind man regained his sight after rubbing his eyes with hands stained with Olaf&#x27;s blood.

The texts used for the liturgical celebration of St. Olaf during most of the Middle Ages were probably compiled or written by Eystein Erlendsson, the second Archbishop of Nidaros (1161–1189). The nine miracles reported in &quot;Glælognskviða&quot; form the core of the catalogue of miracles in this office.

St. Olaf was widely popular throughout Scandinavia. Numerous churches in Norway, Sweden, and Iceland were dedicated to him. His presence was even felt in Finland and many travelled from all over the Norse world in order to visit his shrine. Apart from the early traces of a cult in England, there are only scattered references to him outside the Nordic area.

Several churches in England were dedicated to him (often as &quot;St Olave&quot;); the name was presumably popular with Scandinavian immigrants. St Olave&#x27;s Church, York, is referred to in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; for 1055 as the place of burial of its founder, Earl Siward. This is generally accepted to be the earliest datable church foundation dedicated to Olaf and is further evidence of a cult of St. Olaf in the early 1050s in England. St Olave Hart Street in the City of London is the burial place of Samuel Pepys and his wife. Another St. Olave&#x27;s Church south of London Bridge gave its name to Tooley Street and to the &quot;St Olave&#x27;s Poor Law Union&quot;, later the Metropolitan Borough of Bermondsey: its workhouse in Rotherhithe became St Olave&#x27;s Hospital and then an old people&#x27;s home a few hundred metres from &quot;St Olav&#x27;s Church&quot;, which is the Norwegian Church in London. It also led to the naming of St Olave&#x27;s Grammar School, which was established in 1571 and was in Tooley Street until 1968, when it moved to Orpington, Kent. The village of St Olaves in Norfolk bears the name as it is the location of the remains of a 13th-century Augustinian priory dedicated to Olaf.

St. Olaf was also, together with the Mother of God, the patron saint of the chapel of the Varangians, the Scandinavian warriors who served as the bodyguard of the Byzantine emperor. This church is believed to have been near the church of Hagia Irene in Constantinople. The icon of the Madonna Nicopeia, presently in St. Mark&#x27;s Basilica in Venice, which is believed to have been traditionally carried into combat by the Byzantine military forces, is believed to have been kept in this chapel in times of peace. Thus St. Olaf was also the last saint venerated by both the Western and Eastern churches before the Great Schism.

The basilica of Sant&#x27;Ambrogio e Carlo al Corso in Rome has a Chapel of St Olav. Its altarpiece contains a painting of the saint, shown as a martyr king defeating a dragon, representing victory over his pagan past. It was originally a gift presented to Pope Leo XIII in 1893 for the golden jubilee of his ordination as a bishop by Norwegian nobleman and papal chamberlain Baron Wilhelm Wedel-Jarlsberg. The chapel was restored in 1980 and reinaugurated by Bishop John Willem Gran, bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Oslo.

In Germany, there used to be a shrine of St. Olaf in Koblenz. It was founded in 1463 or 1464 by Heinrich Kalteisen at his retirement home, the Dominican Monastery in the &quot;Altstadt&quot; (&quot;Old City&quot;) neighborhood of Koblenz. He was the Archbishop of Nidaros in Norway from 1452 to 1458. When he died in 1464, he was buried in front of the shrine&#x27;s altar. However, the shrine did not last: the Dominican Monastery was secularized in 1802 and bulldozed in 1955. Only the &quot;Rokokoportal&quot; (&quot;Rococo Portal&quot;), built in 1754, remains to mark the spot.

In the Faroe Islands, the day of St. Olaf&#x27;s death is celebrated as Ólavsøka, a nation-wide holiday.

Recently the pilgrimage route to Nidaros Cathedral, the site of St. Olaf&#x27;s tomb, has been reinstated. The route is known as The Pilgrim&#x27;s Way (&quot;Pilegrimsleden&quot;). The main route, approximately 640 km long, starts in the ancient part of Oslo and heads north, along Lake Mjosa, up the Gudbrandsdal Valley, over Dovrefjell and down the Orkdalen Valley, ending at Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim. A Pilgrim&#x27;s Office in Oslo gives advice to pilgrims, and a Pilgrim Centre in Trondheim, under the aegis of the Cathedral, awards certificates to pilgrims when they complete their journeys. However, the relics are no longer exposed in the cathedral, and it is not sure where exactly in the cathedral crypt his remains are buried.

==== Folklore ====
For centuries, Olaf figured in folk traditions as a slayer of trolls and giants, and as a protector against malicious forces. He was said to have healing power, which attracted people to his shrine, and various springs were claimed to have sprung forth where he or his body had been. Around the 12th century, folk traditions and iconography of Olaf absorbed elements of the gods Thor and Freyr from Norse mythology. Like Freyr, he became associated with fertility, which led to his adoption as a patron saint by farmers, fishermen, sailors and merchants of the Hanseatic League, who turned to him for good yield and protection. From Thor, he inherited the quick temper, physical strength and merits of a giant-slayer.

Popular tradition also made marks in the ecclesiastical material. Early depictions of Olaf portray him as clean-shaven, but after 1200 he appears with a red beard, which may have been absorbed from Thor. The &quot;Passio a miracule beati Olavi&quot;, the official record of Olaf&#x27;s miracles, contains an episode where Olaf helps a man escape from the &quot;huldrefolk&quot;, the &quot;hidden people&quot; of Norwegian folklore.

==== In Normandy ====
In Normandy, Saint Olaf represents an important figure and was chosen unofficially as the patron saint of the Normans, this term mainly designating the inhabitants of continental Normandy and of the Channel Islands, but also on a larger scale the inhabitants of the former Viking territories, namely the Scandinavian countries and, even more so, Norway. This choice can be explained by the time in which Olaf lived and when the exchanges between Normandy and the Scandinavian countries were common. There were also many kinships between the inhabitants of the brand new Norman state, as illustrated by the choice of Archbishop Robert II for the baptism of Olaf.

The normand flag with a Scandinavian cross, which recalls the Scandinavian origins of Normandy, has been baptized &quot;Cross of Saint Olav&quot; (or &quot;Cross of Saint Olaf&quot;) in honor of the saint.

Baptized in Rouen by the brother of a Duke of Normandy, a church in Rouen is dedicated to Saint-Olaf. The Norwegian Saint-Olaf Church was built in 1926, rue Duguay-Trouin, near the home of the Scandinavian sailors. The Norwegian Seamen&#x27;s Mission wanted to build a Lutheran place of worship for visiting sailors.

A bone from Saint Olaf&#x27;s arm is kept as a relic in the crypt of Rouen Cathedral.

In 2014 the city and the diocese of Rouen celebrated the millennium of the baptism of Saint Olav with the Norwegian representatives of the Catholic Church and the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Norway.

In Normandy, July 29 is the occasion of local cultural festivals which generally highlight the Norse heritage of Normandy. In some Norman parishes, Mass is celebrated on this day in honor of the saint and to mark the historical links that unite Normandy and Scandinavia.

A statue of a young Olaf Haraldsson can be found erected in front of the Stave Church replica in the Norway Pavilion in Walt Disney World&#x27;s Epcot.

<text>The NBC Symphony Orchestra was a radio orchestra conceived by David Sarnoff, the president of the Radio Corporation of America, the parent corporation of the National Broadcasting Company especially for the conductor Arturo Toscanini. The NBC Symphony Orchestra performed weekly radio broadcast concerts with Toscanini and other conductors and several of its players served in the house orchestra for the NBC Radio Network. NBC encouraged the public’s perception of the Orchestra as a full-time organization exclusively at Toscanini’s beck and call, but Fortune disclosed in 1938 that these instrumentalists played other radio—and, later, television—broadcasts: “the Toscanini concerts have been allocated only fifteen of the thirty hours a week each man works, including rehearsals.”

The orchestra&#x27;s first broadcast was on November 13, 1937, and it continued until disbanded in April 1954. A new ensemble, independent of the network, called the Symphony of the Air, followed. It was made up of former members of the NBC Symphony Orchestra and performed from 1954 to 1963, particularly under Leopold Stokowski.

==History==
Tom Lewis, in the &quot;Organization of American Historians Magazine of History&quot;, described NBC&#x27;s plan for cultural programming and the origin of the NBC Symphony:
:David Sarnoff, who had first proposed the &quot;radio music box&quot; in 1916 so that listeners might enjoy &quot;concerts, lectures, music, recitals&quot;, felt that the medium was failing to do this. By 1937, RCA had recovered enough from the effects of the Depression for it to make a dramatic commitment to cultural programming. Sarnoff proposed to create a radio orchestra and hire Arturo Toscanini to conduct it. Toscanini had recently resigned from the New York Philharmonic at age 69 and was considering retirement; Sarnoff sent Samuel Chotzinoff as an emissary to Italy and he managed to convince the wary Toscanini to accept Sarnoff&#x27;s offer. On Christmas night, 1937, the NBC Symphony Orchestra gave its first performance with Toscanini in an entirely refurbished studio at NBC located in the RCA Building. &quot;The National Broadcasting Company is an American business organization. It has employees and stockholders. It serves their interests best when it serves the public best.&quot; That Christmas night, and whenever the NBC orchestra played over the next 17 years, he was right.
Sarnoff devoted considerable effort and resources to create an orchestra of the first rank for Toscanini and NBC. Artur Rodziński, an orchestra builder and musical task master in his own right, was engaged to mold and train the new orchestra in anticipation of the arrival of Toscanini. It offered the highest salaries of any orchestra at the time and a 52-week contract. Prominent musicians from major orchestras around the country were recruited and the conductor Pierre Monteux was hired as well to work with the orchestra in its formative months. A new large broadcast studio was built for the orchestra at NBC&#x27;s Radio City Studios in Rockefeller Center, New York, Studio 8-H. In addition to creating prestige for the network, there has been speculation that one of the reasons NBC created the orchestra was to deflect a congressional inquiry into broadcasting standards.

The orchestra&#x27;s first broadcast concert aired on November 13, 1937, under the direction of Monteux. Toscanini conducted ten concerts that first season, making his NBC debut on December 25, 1937. In addition to weekly broadcasts on the NBC Red and Blue networks, the NBC Symphony Orchestra made many recordings for RCA Victor. Televised concerts began in March 1948 and continued until March 1952. During the summer of 1950, NBC converted Studio 8-H into a television studio (the broadcast home of NBC&#x27;s late-night comedy program &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; since 1975) and moved the broadcast concerts to Carnegie Hall, where many of the orchestra&#x27;s recording sessions and special concerts had already taken place.

For the new ensemble, many NBC staff musicians were auditioned by Rodzinski and Chotzinoff, along with about 700 members of other orchestras or chamber-music groups; 31 NBC players were retained in the new orchestra. The American Federation of Musicians union minimum for such staff work at NBC was $105 weekly, but many instrumentalists were paid considerably more. Fortune magazine disclosed that the NBC&#x27;s extra cost for all the above-scale musicians, plus Toscanini’s salary—as compared with a typical staff conductor’s—amounted to about $250K more than an orchestra of union-scale players under typical staff conductors.

Leopold Stokowski served as principal conductor from 1941 to 1944 on a three-year contract following a dispute between Toscanini and NBC. During this time Toscanini continued to lead the orchestra in a series of public benefit concerts for war relief. He returned as Stokowski&#x27;s co-conductor for the 1942–43 and 1943–44 seasons, resuming full control thereafter. Upon Toscanini&#x27;s retirement in the spring of 1954, NBC officially disbanded the orchestra, much to Toscanini&#x27;s distress, though it continued for several years independent of NBC, as the Symphony of the Air. Toscanini&#x27;s final broadcast concert with the orchestra took place at Carnegie Hall on April 4, 1954, and he conducted the orchestra for the last time during RCA Victor recording sessions held June 3 and 5, 1954.

===Musicians===
Some notable musicians who were members of the orchestra include violinists Samuel Antek, Leonid Bolotine, Henry Clifton, Felix Galimir, Josef Gingold, Daniel Guilet (concertmaster 1952–54), Harry Lookofsky, Mischa Mischakoff (concertmaster 1937–1952), Albert Pratz, David Sarser, Oscar Shumsky, Benjamin Steinberg, Herman Spielberg, Boris Koutzen and Andor Toth; violists Carlton Cooley, Milton Katims, William Primrose, and Tibor Serly; cellists Frank Miller, Leonard Rose, Harvey Shapiro, Alan Shulman, George Koutzen and David Soyer; double bassists Homer Mensch and Oscar G. Zimmerman; flutists Carmine Coppola, D. Antoinette Handy, Arthur Lora and Paul Renzi; clarinetists Augustin Duques, Al Gallodoro, David Weber and Alexander Williams; trombonist Norberto (Robert) Paolucci; saxophonist Frankie Trumbauer; oboists Robert Bloom, Paolo Renzi and Chauncey Vernon Kelley, Jr.; bassoonists Elias Carmen, Benjamin Kohon, William Polisi, Leonard Sharrow and Arthur Weisberg; French horn players Arthur Berv, Harry Berv, Jack Berv and Albert Stagliano; Harry Glantz, Bernard Baker, and Raymond Crisara trumpets and tuba player William Bell, among others.

Not all of the NBC Symphony performers were under full-time contracts to NBC. In the early 1950s, for example, only about 55 of these musicians were salaried; the rest were hired under per-service contracts (in line with Local 802 American Federation of Musicians wage scales) to bring the orchestra&#x27;s performing and recording strength up to the 85 to 100 seen in period photographs and video footage. Even for the salaried members, NBC Symphony duties constituted barely half of their work obligations for NBC; these musicians played in orchestras for other NBC radio and television programs, with many of the wind players also serving with the Cities Service &quot;Band of America&quot; conducted by Paul Lavalle.

==Sponsorship==
In the first several seasons the NBC Symphony broadcasts were &quot;sustaining&quot; programs, meaning that they were paid for and presented by NBC itself. In later years the broadcasts were commercially sponsored, primarily by General Motors. Under GM&#x27;s sponsorship the NBC Symphony broadcasts went out under the title of General Motors Symphony of the Air, not to be confused with the later orchestra of the same name. Other sponsors included the House of Squibb, the Reynolds Metals Company, and the Socony Vacuum Oil Company (Mobil).

==Recordings==
RCA Victor began making studio recordings of Toscanini conducting the NBC Symphony Orchestra for commercial release early in 1938; Mozart&#x27;s Symphony No. 40, Haydn&#x27;s Symphony No. 88, Rossini&#x27;s &quot;William Tell&quot; Overture and the second and third movements from Beethoven&#x27;s String Quartet, Op. 135, were among the first works to be recorded. The orchestra recorded initially in Studio 8-H, but RCA Victor producer Charles O&#x27;Connell soon decided to hold most of the studio recording sessions in Carnegie Hall. However, many live broadcast performances originating in Studio 8H were also released on records, and subsequently on CD. The dry acoustics of Studio 8-H, designed for broadcasting, were found to be less than ideal for recording. Acoustical modifications began in 1939 were thought to have greatly improved the sound of Studio 8H; although most NBC Symphony recording sessions were shifted to Carnegie Hall in 1940, the orchestra recorded in 8-H sporadically as late as June 1950, after which the studio was converted for television broadcasting. From the autumn of 1950 until June 1954, all NBC Symphony radio broadcasts and RCA Victor recording sessions took place in Carnegie Hall.

RCA Victor released the orchestra&#x27;s recordings on its flagship Red Seal label on the then-standard 78-rpm record format. In 1950, a 1945 recording of Ferde Grofé&#x27;s &quot;Grand Canyon Suite&quot; became the NBC Symphony&#x27;s first LP release (LM-1004). A mainstay of RCA Victor&#x27;s Red Seal catalog through the 1950s, most of the Toscanini/NBC Symphony recordings were reissued on the lower-priced RCA Victrola label to celebrate Toscanini&#x27;s centenary in 1967. In the 1980s, RCA began digitally remastering recordings of the orchestra for release on compact disc. A complete reissue of all Toscanini&#x27;s RCA Victor recordings was released on CD and cassette between 1990 and 1992 and again in 2012. Later advances in digital technology has led RCA (now owned by Sony Music) to claim further enhancement of the sound of the magnetic tapes for later reissues, changing original equalization balances and adding acoustical enhancement, but critics are divided in their judgment. RCA Victor has only reissued recordings that were personally approved by Toscanini, including some broadcast performances such as the seven complete operas he conducted at NBC between 1944 and 1954; however, several other labels have released discs taken from off-the-air recordings of NBC broadcast concerts. Toscanini&#x27;s final two broadcast programs, in the spring of 1954, were experimentally recorded in stereo, but he did not approve their release; many years passed before they were finally issued unofficially by labels other than RCA Victor. Recorded in rather primitive and &quot;minimalist&quot; two-channel sound, the stereo antiphonal effect is striking (if crude); but the complete performance from March 21, 1954, of the Tchaikovsky Symphony No. 6 (&quot;Pathetique&quot;) is not entirely stereo as the master 2-track tape of the entire &#x27;Allegro molto vivace&#x27; third movement had apparently been lost; an artificial stereo synthesis is substituted. The missing portion of the stereo recording of the third movement was later found.

The complete series of ten NBC Symphony telecasts has been issued on VHS and LaserDisc by RCA in 1990 and on DVD by Testament in 2006. While the videos derive from kinescopes, the sound tracks were carefully synchronized from the highest fidelity transcriptions and tapes that exist.

One of the NBC Symphony Orchestra&#x27;s most ambitious projects was the recording of the 13-hour musical score for NBC Television&#x27;s 1952–53 series &quot;Victory at Sea&quot;. Robert Russell Bennett conducted the orchestra in his arrangements of Richard Rodgers&#x27; musical themes for the 26 documentary programs (recorded in Rockefeller Center&#x27;s Center Theatre). The series is currently available on DVD. The first RCA Victor LP of excerpts was recorded by Bennett and the NBC SO musicians in July 1953. Bennett would later lead stereo recordings of volume 2 in 1957, a re-make of volume 1 in 1959, and a concluding volume 3 in 1961, conducting the RCA Victor Symphony Orchestra (members of the Symphony of the Air). RCA has reissued all of these recordings on CD.

In 1954, shortly after the orchestra&#x27;s final concerts with Toscanini, Stokowski made stereo recordings for RCA Victor of excerpts from Prokofiev&#x27;s ballet &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; and Gian Carlo Menotti&#x27;s ballet &quot;Sebastian&quot;. The recordings were originally issued (monophonically) as &quot;Leopold Stokowski and his orchestra&quot;, but reissued as &quot;members of the NBC Symphony Orchestra&quot;. On April 6, 1954, just two days after Toscanini&#x27;s final concert with the orchestra, Guido Cantelli made a recording in Carnegie Hall of César Franck&#x27;s Symphony in D minor. Though the performance was recorded in stereo, RCA Victor initially issued the recording in mono. The label finally issued the stereo version in 1978.

==Symphony of the Air==
After the NBC Symphony Orchestra disbanded, some members went on to play with other orchestras, such as Frank Miller (principal cello) and Leonard Sharrow (principal bassoon) with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. However, many former NBC Symphony members, in an attempt to stay together and preserve the orchestra, regrouped as a new ensemble called the &quot;Symphony of the Air&quot;. They made their first recording on September 21, 1954, and gave their first public concert at the United Nations 9th Anniversary Celebration on October 24. On November 14, they appeared on the acclaimed &quot;Omnibus&quot; TV program in which Leonard Bernstein, making his first television appearance, discussed Beethoven&#x27;s Fifth Symphony, and Bernstein led the Symphony of the Air during its first season. With an Asian tour under the auspices of the State Department and an attendance of 60,000 at concerts in the Catskills that summer, the first season was a huge success.

In 1957, Symphony of the Air concerts or recordings used 80% or more veteran NBC Symphony musicians. Some 70 of the 75 players having steady &quot;binder contracts&quot; were former NBC players; when more were needed for an engagement, it was reported &quot;the SOA tries whenever possible to obtain ex-NBC musicians on a free-lance basis.&quot;

In 1960, the CBS Television network also featured the Symphony of the Air in its televised prime-time special &quot;Spring Festival of Music&quot; under the direction of the conductor Alfredo Antonini. In collaboration with the concert pianist John Browning, producer Robert Herridge and director Roger Englander, the orchestra presented a virtuoso live presentation of Sergei Rachmaninoff&#x27;s Second Piano Concerto.

For nearly a decade, the Symphony of the Air performed many concerts led by Stokowski, the orchestra&#x27;s music director from 1955. The orchestra recorded widely (on RCA Victor, Columbia, Vanguard and United Artists) under leading conductors, including Stokowski, Bernstein, Monteux, Fritz Reiner, Bruno Walter, Kirill Kondrashin, Sir Thomas Beecham, Alfred Wallenstein and Josef Krips. Only once more did they use their old name, the NBC Symphony Orchestra, in the 1963 telecast of Gian Carlo Menotti&#x27;s written-for-television opera, &quot;Amahl and the Night Visitors&quot;, with an all-new cast. The orchestra disbanded in 1963.

<text>Luis Barahona de Soto (1548 – 5 November 1595) was a Spanish poet.

Born at Lucena (Cordoba), he was educated at Granada, and practised as a physician at Archidona (Málaga). His major work is the &quot;Primera parte de la Angélica&quot; (1586), a continuation of the &quot;Orlando furioso&quot;. The second part of the poem was long believed to be lost, but fragments of it have been identified in the anonymous &quot;Diálogos de la monteria&quot;, first printed in 1890; the &quot;Diálogos&quot; also embody fragments of a poem by Barahona entitled &quot;Los Principios del mundo&quot;, and many graceful lyrics by the same writer have been published by Francisco Rodríguez Marín.

Miguel de Cervantes describes Barahona as &quot;one of the best poets not only in Spain, but in the whole world&quot;; this is friendly hyperbole. Nevertheless Barahona has poetic imagination, ingenious fancy, and an exceptional mastery of the methods transplanted to Spain from Italy. His &quot;Angélica&quot; has been reproduced in facsimile (New York, 1904) by Archer M Huntington.

The Centralia R-VI School District operates four schools: Chance Elementary School (grades PK-2), Centralia Intermediate School (grades 3–5), Chester Boren Middle School (grades 6–8), and Centralia High School (grades 9–12). Centralia Intermediate School is the newest building of the four, having opened for classes in August 2009. It was constructed in order to deal with the district&#x27;s increasing enrollment. This new technology-rich building contains 15 classrooms, each with 12 computers.

The town has a lending library, the Centralia Public Library.

== History ==

=== City origin ===
Centralia was laid out in 1857 and was named after its central location on the North Missouri Railroad from St. Louis to Ottumwa, Iowa, and from the fact that it was located near the center of a vast prairie between Mexico and Huntsville, and between Columbia and Paris.

=== Civil War ===
On September 27, 1864, 22 unarmed Union soldiers returning home on leave were pulled from a train in Centralia and executed by Confederate bushwhackers under William T. &quot;Bloody Bill&quot; Anderson. A Union force pursuing the guerrillas was ambushed, and about 150 were killed. The incident came to be known as the Centralia Massacre.

=== The A.B. Chance Company ===
The A.B. Chance Company was founded in 1907 by Albert Bishop Chance. He invented the first practical earth anchor. The company played a vital role in the growth of Centralia. Over the course of nearly 120 years, Chance has delivered pole line hardware, switches, cutouts and fuse links in addition to anchors, foundations, hot line tools, fiberglass and rubber products to the world-wide electricity transmission and distribution industry. Acquired by Hubbell in 1994, the Chance brand is manufactured in Centralia, Missouri.

The company still plays a major role in Centralia&#x27;s economy with employing 860 people.

===Registered Historic Places===

The following Centralia locations have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places:
* Albert Bishop Chance House and Gardens
* Chatol

== Anchor Fest ==

Due to Centralia&#x27;s rich history in earth anchors, there is a yearly celebration traditionally held the weekend after Memorial Day. It is looked at as a great time of year to kick off the summer and have fun enjoying the rides, great food, funnel cakes, arts and crafts and of course live music. There is also a parade of high school bands, local organizations, tractors and classic cars.

== Media ==
Centralia is located within the Columbia/Jefferson City television and radio markets. As such, stations from those cities can be picked up here. Centralia is also home to two radio stations: K-Love affiliate KMFC 92.1 FM (with translator K293CI 106.5 FM in Columbia) owned by Educational Media Foundation; and Radio 74 Internationale affiliate KSDC-LP 94.9 FM owned by nearby Sunnydale Adventist Academy.

<doc id="150708" wikidata="Q968021" url="?curid=150708" title="Monett, Missouri">
<text>Monett is the most-populous city in Barry and Lawrence counties in the U.S. state of Missouri. The city is located in the Ozarks, just south of Interstate 44 between Joplin and Springfield. According to the 2020 census, the population of the town was estimated to be 9,576 individuals.

==History==
Southwest Missouri, including the area of what is now Monett, was inhabited by Native Americans of the Osage Nation until their forced removal to Indian Territory.

===Settlement: 1870-1900===

Monett was created as a railroad town by the St. Louis–San Francisco Railway (&quot;Frisco Line&quot;), which was extended into the area in 1870, and a branch line going to Paris, Texas, was built. Both lines are still in existence and operated by the BNSF Railway. During this time the area went through several names including Kings Prairie Depot, Plymouth, Plymouth Junction (when the southern branch was built in 1880), Gonten (named for the local postmaster because the Post Service said there were other Plymouths); and finally, Monett in 1887 when the area was formally platted and the Monett name was applied to the post office. It was named for Henry Monett who was a popular general station agent for various railroads including the New York, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad (&quot;Nickel Plate Railroad&quot;) before becoming an agent for the New York Central Railroad shortly before his death at the age of 35 in 1888.
The community was very much noted for being a rail town and had a Harvey House operating at the Frisco train station from 1896 until 1930. The community in the Ozark Mountains also had a thriving fruit business and was nicknamed the &quot;Strawberry Capital of the Midwest.&quot; The Ozark Fruit Growers Association building, which was built in 1927, is part of the Downtown Monett Historic District and is on the National Register of Historic Places.
The David W. Courdin House, Downtown Monett Historic District, and Waldensian Church and Cemetery of Stone Prairie are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

In 1894, a lynching and race riot took place in Monett before the violence spread to Pierce City and other southwestern Missouri towns. Monett became a sundown town, banning African Americans from living or staying there after dark, with a sign across the main street saying: &quot;Nigger, don&#x27;t let the sun go down.&quot; A newspaper in another Missouri town reported in 1906 that &quot;Monett, Pierce City, Rogers, Ark., and several other towns around here have driven the negros out.&quot; When Pierce City drove out its African American population in an act of ethnic cleansing, the &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; said the town had been &quot;Monettized&quot;.

===20th century===
From about 1908 through 1911, Monett investors led by L. B. Durnil and U. S. Barnsley sought to build an airplane. Their most successful attempt was the DeChenne airplane. The DeChenne airplane gave its first public demonstration flight in Monett on July 4, 1911, flown by Monett pharmacist Logan McKee. It then made an exhibition tour in Oklahoma and Texas.

The population had reached 4,177 by 1910, due in large part to the railroad and its roundhouse. By 1937, a promotional pamphlet reported one out of eight people in Monett worked for the railroad.

In a postwar industrialization effort, the Monett Industrial Development Corporation brought light industry to the town, further diversifying the local and broader economy. This diversification nearly doubled the population during the century, to 7,396 by 2000.

===21st century===
Through a combination of private investment and public resources, numerous restoration and revitalization projects have been undertaken in the historic downtown to restore its architectural quality, upgrade the infrastructure, drive local business success, and improve the quality of life.

In 2018, Missouri Governor Eric Greitens and Senator Roy Blunt announced an &quot;Opportunity Zone&quot; in Monett, allocating state and federal tax incentives for businesses that invest in the areas designated. In 2018, Monett adopted the complete streets policy, the 39th city in Missouri to do so.

Waynesville-St. Robert Regional Airport (Forney Field) serves the community with air service. Although it is located within Fort Leonard Wood, it is jointly run by the cities of Waynesville and St. Robert and is available for civilian use by private pilots and scheduled commercial passenger service.

An airfield in Richland&#x27;s industrial park is available for private pilots but has no scheduled commercial service.

The major east–west route is Interstate 44; before that, the main highway was U.S. Route 66, which still exists as a scenic route through the area and passes through Devil&#x27;s Elbow, St. Robert, Waynesville, Buckhorn, and Hazelgreen. Names for U.S. Route 66 vary - at different places, it is called Teardrop Road, Highway Z, Old Route 66, Historic Route 66, and Highway 17. State-posted signs mark most of the alignment of the road.

Major north–south routes near Richland include:

* Missouri Route 133 runs north from Interstate 44, exit 145, approximately two miles east of Hazelgreen to Richland, Swedeborg, Crocker, and about two miles west of Dixon, then north out of the county.
* Missouri Route 7 runs north from Interstate 44, exit 150, about three miles west of Buckhorn to Richland, then north out of the county toward the Lake of the Ozarks region.
* Missouri Route T runs north from Missouri Route 17 at Waynesville to Swedeborg, where it meets and ends at Route 133 about halfway between Richland and Crocker.

== Media ==
Pulaski County has one weekly print newspaper, as well as an online internet daily newspaper. The county also has two internet discussion sites, the Pulaski County Web and Pulaski County Insider. 
The weekly newspaper, the &quot;Dixon Pilot&quot;, regularly covers the Pulaski County area.

KFBD-FM and its AM sister station, KJPW, are the dominant news radio providers in the Pulaski County area, which includes Fort Leonard Wood, Waynesville, and St. Robert. These stations compete with the only other station broadcasting from Pulaski County, KFLW Radio, owned by the Lebanon Daily Record and working locally from the St. Robert offices of the &quot;Pulaski County Mirror&quot; weekly newspaper.

Gatehouse Media is the central printing plant for three Gatehouse newspapers in nearby counties, the daily &quot;Camden Lake Sun Leader&quot; and &quot;Rolla Daily News&quot; as well as the weekly &quot;St. James Leader-Journal&quot;.

The content of the weekly &quot;Fort Leonard Wood Guidon&quot; is produced under the auspices of Army Public Affairs at Fort Leonard Wood, but printed under contract by the &quot;Springfield News-Leader&quot;, a Gannett-owned newspaper which produces and sells advertisements in the &quot;Guidon&quot;.

The &quot;Pulaski County Daily News&quot; internet newspaper is privately owned by a Waynesville resident.

The &quot;Pulaski County Insider&quot; is run and maintained by a businessman from St. Robert and hosted by a Potosi resident.

== Education ==
The city of Richland and surrounding rural areas are served by the Richland R-IV School District, which extends into rural parts of adjacent counties.

The Richland High School academic team is known statewide for its 13 Class 2A state titles in the last 14 years. The team has currently won seven in a row.

<text>Cape Girardeau ( , ; colloquially referred to as &quot;Cape&quot;) is a city in Cape Girardeau and Scott Counties in the U.S. state of Missouri. At the 2020 census, the population was 39,540, making it the 17th-largest in the state. The city is one of two principal cities of the Cape Girardeau, MO-IL Metropolitan Statistical Area, which encompasses Alexander County, Illinois, Bollinger County, Missouri and Cape Girardeau County, Missouri and has a population of 97,517. The sliver of the city located in Scott County is part of the Sikeston Micropolitan Statistical Area, and the entire city forms the core of the Cape Girardeau-Sikeston Combined Statistical Area.

The city is the economic center of Southeast Missouri and also the home of Southeast Missouri State University. It is located approximately southeast of St. Louis and north of Memphis.

==History==

The city is named after Jean Baptiste de Girardot, who established a temporary trading post in the area around 1733. He was a French soldier stationed at Kaskaskia between 1704 and 1720 in the French colony of &quot;La Louisiane&quot;. The &quot;Cape&quot; in the city name referred to a rock promontory overlooking the Mississippi River; it was later destroyed by railroad construction. As early as 1765, a bend in the Mississippi River, about south of the French village of Ste. Genevieve, had been referred to as Cape Girardot or Girardeau (both pronounced the same in French).

The settlement of Girardeau is said to date from 1793 when the Spanish government, which had acquired Louisiana in 1764 following the French defeat in the Seven Years&#x27; War, granted Louis Lorimier, a French-Canadian, the right to establish a trading post. This gave him trading privileges and a large tract of land surrounding his post. Lorimier was made commandant of the district and prospered from the returns on his land sales and trade with indigenous peoples, such as the Ozark Bluff Dwellers and the Mississippian people.

Also in 1793, Baron Carondelet granted land near Cape Girardeau to the Black Bob Band of the Hathawekela Shawnee, who had migrated from across the Mississippi River. The Band became known as the Cape Girardeau Shawnee. They successfully resisted removal to Indian Territory with the rest of the Shawnee tribe until 1833.

In 1799, American settlers founded the first English school west of the Mississippi River in Cape Girardeau at a landmark called Mount Tabor, named by the settlers for the Biblical Mount Tabor.

The town of Cape Girardeau was incorporated in 1808, prior to Missouri statehood. It was reincorporated as a city in 1843. The advent of the steamboat in 1835 and related river trade stimulated the development of Cape Girardeau as the biggest port on the Mississippi River between St. Louis, Missouri and Memphis, Tennessee.

During the Civil War, the city was the site of the Battle of Cape Girardeau on April 26, 1863. The Union and Confederate armies engaged in a minor four-hour skirmish, each sustaining casualties generally believed to be in the low double-digits.

For years travelers had to use ferries to cross the Mississippi River from Cape Girardeau. In September 1928 a bridge was completed between Missouri and Illinois. Built to accommodate cars, it was wide under standards of the time.

The Old Federal Courthouse, located at Broadway and Fountain Streets and built in the late 1940s, was the subject of a U.S. Supreme Court case when it was being developed. In &quot;United States v. Carmack&quot;, 329 U.S. 230 (1946), the Court upheld the federal government&#x27;s authority under the Condemnation Act of 1888 to seize land owned by a state or locality.

On May 21, 1949, a large tornado ripped through the city, killing 22 people, hospitalizing 72, and injuring hundreds of people. Temporary shelters were established at Cape Central High School, St. Mary&#x27;s High School, John Cobb School, and the Knights of Columbus Hall. 

In December 2003, the &quot;Old Bridge&quot; was succeeded by a new four-lane cable-stayed bridge crossing the Mississippi River at Cape Girardeau. Its official name is &quot;The Bill Emerson Memorial Bridge.&quot;, honoring former U.S. Rep. Bill Emerson (R-Mo.) The two towers of the bridge reach a height of approximately . The &quot;Old Bridge&quot; was demolished after the Emerson Bridge opened.

The City of Cape Girardeau was recognized in January 2008 by First Lady Laura Bush as a Preserve America Community for its work in surveying and protecting historic buildings.

The city is known to some as &quot;The City of Roses&quot; because of a stretch of highway that was once lined with dozens of rose bushes. Although there used to be many prominent rose gardens around the community, few of these gardens have been maintained. The city is also known as &quot;Cape Girardeau: Where the River Turns a Thousand Tales,&quot; due to the history of the town and the Mississippi River.

===Historic landmarks===

Numerous murals commemorate the city&#x27;s history. The largest is the Mississippi River Tales Mural, located on the city&#x27;s downtown floodwall. Covering nearly , it spans the length of the downtown shopping district and features 24 panels. Behind the floodwall lies the Riverfront Park of Cape Girardeau Missouri, where riverboats dock and visitors can view the Mississippi River.

There are 39 historic sites in Cape Girardeau that are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Of these, eight are historic districts, such as Cape Girardeau Commercial Historic District, which was listed in 2000 and includes multiple contributing properties. The growth of the town can be documented through Sanborn maps, over 80 of which are available online. Other landmarks include the Fort D Historic Site and the Confederate War Memorial.

Among the city&#x27;s older cemeteries are Apple Creek Cemetery, Salem Cemetery, and Old Lorimier Cemetery.

<text>Lee&#x27;s Summit is a city in the U.S. state of Missouri and is a suburb in the Kansas City metropolitan area. It resides in Jackson County (predominantly) as well as Cass County. As of the 2020 census, its population was 101,108, making it the 6th most populous city in both Missouri and the Kansas City metropolitan area. It is the most populous city in the state that is not also a county seat.

==History==

The &quot;Town of Strother&quot; (not to be confused with a town of the same name in Monroe County) was founded by William Bullitt Howard in October 1865. He named it for his wife, Maria D. Strother, the daughter of William D. Strother formerly of Bardstown, Kentucky. Howard came to Jackson County in 1842 from Kentucky, married Maria in 1844, and by 1850 he and Maria had and a homestead 5 miles (8 km) north of town. Howard was arrested for being a Confederate in October 1862, near the beginning of the Civil War, and after being paroled he took his family back to Kentucky for the duration of the war. After the war ended he returned and, knowing that the Missouri Pacific Railroad was surveying a route in the area, platted the town with in the fall of 1865 as the town of Strother.

In November 1868, the town&#x27;s name was changed to the &quot;Town of Lee&#x27;s Summit&quot;, most likely to honor early settler Dr. Pleasant John Graves Lea, who had moved to Jackson County in 1849 from Bradley County, Tennessee. Lea was listed as the postmaster of nearby Big Cedar in the 1855 &quot;United States Official Postal Guide&quot;. Dr. Lea was killed in August 1862 by Kansas Jayhawkers (or Redlegs).

When the surveyors for the Missouri Pacific Railroad came through, the local people and the railroad wanted to name the town in Dr. Lea&#x27;s honor. He had a farm on the highest point and near the path of the tracks, and his murder had taken place near the site of the proposed depot. So they chose the name of &quot;Lea&#x27;s Summit&quot;, the &quot;summit&quot; portion to reflect its highest elevation on the Missouri Pacific Railroad between St. Louis and Kansas City. But they misspelled the name &quot;Lees Summit&quot; (with two &quot;e&#x27;s&quot;; &quot;Lee&quot; instead of &quot;Lea&quot;; and leaving out the apostrophe) on a boxcar that was serving as a station and donated by the Missouri Pacific, then a sign next to the tracks, and finally in the printed time schedule for the railroad. It may be that this misspelling stuck and the name has remained &quot;Lee&#x27;s Summit&quot; ever since.

Since the name was already being circulated and published with two &quot;e&#x27;s&quot;, the town petitioned the state legislature and incorporated its name in 1868 as: &quot;Town of Lee&#x27;s Summit&quot;.

The spelling is unusual because apostrophes are typically not included in place names due to potential confusion regarding whether the place is owned by the namesake person. Most possessive place names lack an apostrophe, such as Harpers Ferry, West Virginia.

The growth of the town can be studied through historic Sanborn maps, which document building types and uses in the city during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

In 1913, R. A. Long, the owner of a lumber company, began building his estate, named Longview Farm, on the western edge of the city and into part of Kansas City. When complete, it had a mansion, five barns and 42 buildings in the . Harrison Metheny, grandfather of jazz legend Pat Metheny, was an electrician during the construction of Longview Farm. The farm also had a church, Longview Chapel Christian Church, which was completed in 1915. It soon became internationally known as a showplace farm. Today, one of the horse barns is home to Longview Farm Elementary. The church and mansion are on the National Register of Historic Places. Other parts of the farm have been turned into Longview Lake, Longview Community College, and a development called New Longview. Lee&#x27;s Summit is also home to Missouri Town 1855 and Lee&#x27;s Summit Historical Cemetery.

It ran through southeast Linn County, prompting new towns such as Marceline. The completed line was absorbed into the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railway. The first land parcel in what became the town was sold in January 1888, and the town was incorporated two months later. By the end of the year, it had a railway roundhouse and yard.

In March 1903, the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railway divided the line into two districts, with the Missouri district headquarters in Marceline. 

The town was named after Marcelina, the wife of a railroad man. A post office called Marceline has operated since 1887.

Marceline is most famous as the boyhood home of Walt Disney and for the original Main Street, U.S.A. It hosts the Walt Disney Hometown Museum.

<text>Springfield is the third most populous city in the U.S. state of Missouri and the county seat of Greene County. The city&#x27;s population was 169,176 at the 2020 census. It is the principal city of the Springfield metropolitan area, which had an estimated population of 487,061 in 2022 and includes the counties of Christian, Dallas, Greene, Polk, and Webster, The city sits on the Springfield Plateau of the Ozarks, which ranges from nearly-level to rolling hills. Springfield is the largest city in the Ozarks.

Springfield&#x27;s nicknames include &quot;Queen City of the Ozarks&quot; and &quot;The Birthplace of Route 66&quot;. The city has been called the &quot;Buckle of the Bible Belt&quot; due to its association with evangelical Christianity. The city is the headquarters for Bass Pro Shops and the adjoining Wonders of Wildlife Museum &amp; Aquarium. It is also home to O&#x27;Reilly Auto Parts, which began as a family business with 13 employees in 1957. Springfield is close to Wilson&#x27;s Creek National Battlefield and is along the national historic Trail of Tears. In 2020, Springfield&#x27;s largest ethnicities were 87.6% White, 4% Black, and 5% two or more races, placing it among the least diverse cities in the United States. The city is a regional center of medical care, with the two largest hospitals, CoxHealth and Mercy, being the largest employers in the city. Springfield hosts several universities and colleges, including Missouri State University, Drury University, and Evangel University. Springfield is an important regional center for distribution, logistics, and manufacturing.

==Toponymy==
The origin of the city&#x27;s name is unclear, but the most common view is that it was named by migrants from Springfield, Massachusetts. One account is that James Wilson, who lived in the new settlement, offered free whiskey to anyone who would vote for the name Springfield, after his hometown in Massachusetts.

&quot;Springfield Express&quot; editor J. G. Newbill said in the November 11, 1881, issue: &quot;It has been stated that this city got its name from the fact of a spring and field being near by just west of town. But such is not a correct version. When the authorized persons met and adopted the title of the &#x27;Future Great&#x27; of the Southwest, several of the earliest settlers had handed in their favorite names, among whom was Kindred Rose, who presented the winning name in honor of his hometown, Springfield, Tennessee.&quot; In 1883, historian R. I. Holcombe wrote: &quot;The town took its name from the circumstance of there being a spring under the hill, on the creek, while on top of the hill, where the principal portion of the town lay, there was a field.&quot;

==History==
===Early settlement===
Native American peoples had long lived in this area. In the 1830s, the native Osage Nation, the Kickapoo people from Indiana, and the Lenape (Delaware) from the mid-Atlantic coast had settled in this general area trying to evade encroachment by European Americans on their lands. The Osage had been the dominant tribe for more than one century in the larger region.

On the southeastern side of the town in 1812, about 500 Kickapoo built a small village of about 100 wigwams. They abandoned the site in 1828.

Ten miles south of the site of Springfield, the Lenape had built a substantial community of houses that borrowed elements of Anglo colonial style from the mid-Atlantic, where some of their people had migrated from.

The first European-American settlers to the area were John Polk Campbell and his brother, who reached this area in 1829 from Tennessee. Campbell chose the area because of the presence of a natural well that flowed into a small stream. He staked his claim by carving his initials in a tree. Campbell was joined by settlers Thomas Finney, Samuel Weaver, and Joseph Miller. They cleared the land of trees to develop it for farms. A small general store was soon opened.

In 1833, the southern part of the state was named Greene County after Revolutionary War hero General Nathanael Greene. Campbell Township was one of the seven original townships organized on March 11, 1833, when Greene County was much larger.

An 1876 map shows its boundaries include all the sections in T29N and R21 and 22W. It was bounded by Center Township on the west, Robberson, and Franklin Townships on the north, Taylor Township on the east, and Wilson and Clay Townships on the south. (Later, Campbell was split into Campbell No. 1 Township and Campbell No. 2 Township, then into North Campbell No. 1 Township, North Campbell No. 2 Township, and North Campbell No. 3 Township.)

The county seat of Springfield is located in Campbell Township due to the efforts of John Polk Campbell. The township is named after John Polk Campbell, who donated the land for Springfield&#x27;s public square and platted the town site. In 1835 he deeded 50 acres of land to the legislature for the creation of a county seat. Campbell laid out city streets and lots. The town was incorporated in 1838. In 1878, the town got its nickname as the &quot;Queen City of the Ozarks&quot;.

The United States government enforced Indian removal during the 1830s, forcing land cessions in the Southeast and other areas, and relocating tribes from east of the Mississippi River to Indian Territory. This later developed as the state of Oklahoma in 1908.

During the 1838 relocation of most of the Cherokee, the Trail of Tears passed through Springfield to the west, along the Old Wire Road.

===Civil War===
By 1861, Springfield&#x27;s population had grown to approximately 2,000, and it had become an important commercial hub. In the late 1850s, telegraph lines, previously connected only as far as St. Louis, reached Springfield. News from points further west was brought to Springfield overland. It was sent by telegraph to what was then called the New York Associated Press.

At the start of the American Civil War, Springfield was divided in its loyalty. It had been settled by people from both the North and South, including slaveholders. It also attracted many German immigrants in the mid-19th century, who tended to support the Union.

The Union and Confederate armies both recognized the city&#x27;s strategic importance and sought to control it. They fought the Battle of Wilson&#x27;s Creek on August 10, 1861, a few miles southwest of town. The battle was a Confederate victory, and Nathaniel Lyon was killed here, the first Union General to die in the Civil War. Union troops retreated to the nearby town of Lebanon to regroup. When they returned, they found that most of the Confederate army had withdrawn.

On October 25, 1861, Union Major Charles Zagonyi led an attack against the remaining Confederates in the area, in a battle known as the First Battle of Springfield, or Zagonyi&#x27;s Charge. Zagonyi&#x27;s men removed the Confederate flag from Springfield&#x27;s public square and returned to camp. It was the only Union victory in southwestern Missouri in 1861. The increased military activity in the area set the stage for the Battle of Pea Ridge in northern Arkansas in March 1862.

On January 8, 1863, Confederate forces under General John S. Marmaduke advanced to take control of Springfield and an urban fight ensued. But that evening, the Confederates withdrew. This became known as the Second Battle of Springfield. Marmaduke sent a message to the Union forces asking that Confederate casualties have a proper burial. The city remained under Union control for the remainder of the war. The US army used Springfield as a supply base and central point of operation for military activities in the area.

Promptly after the Civil War ended on July 21, 1865, Wild Bill Hickok shot and killed Davis Tutt in a shootout over a disagreement about a debt Tutt claimed Hickok owed him. During a poker game at the former Lyon House Hotel, in response to the disagreement over the amount, Tutt had taken Hickok&#x27;s watch, which Hickok immediately demanded be returned. Hickok warned that Tutt had better not be seen wearing that watch, then spotted him wearing it in Park Central Square, prompting the gunfight.

On January 25, 1866, Hickok was still in Springfield when he witnessed a Springfield police officer, John Orr, shoot and kill James Coleman after Coleman interfered with the arrest of Coleman&#x27;s friend Bingham, who was drunk and disorderly. Hickok provided testimony in the case. Orr was arrested, released on bail, and immediately fled the country. He was never brought to trial or heard from again.

====Lynchings====

From the period after Reconstruction into the early 20th century, lynchings of freedmen and their descendants occurred in some cities and counties in Missouri, particularly in former slaveholding areas.

On April 14, 1906, a white mob broke into the Springfield county jail, and lynched two black men, Horace Duncan and Fred Coker, for allegedly sexually assaulting Mina Edwards, a white woman. Later they returned to the jail, where other African-American prisoners were being held, and pulled out Will Allen, who had been accused of murdering a white man. All three suspects were hanged from the Gottfried Tower, which held a replica of the Statue of Liberty

Their bodies were burned in the courthouse square by a mob of more than 2,000 white residents. Judge Azariah W. Lincoln called for a grand jury, but no one was prosecuted. The proceedings were covered by national newspapers, including the &quot;New York Times&quot; and &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;.

Duncan&#x27;s and Coker&#x27;s employer testified that they were at his business at the time of the crime against Edwards, and other evidence suggested that they and Allen were all innocent. These three are the only recorded lynchings in Greene County.

But the extrajudicial murders were part of a pattern of discrimination, repeated violence and intimidation of African Americans in this city and southwest Missouri from 1894 to 1909, in an attempt to expel them from the region. Whites in the bordering Lawrence County also lynched three African-American men in this period. After the mass lynching in Springfield, many African Americans left the region.

A historic plaque on the southeast corner of the Springfield courthouse square commemorates Duncan, Coker, and Allen, the three victims of mob violence.

===Country music===
Four nationally broadcast television series originated from the city between 1955 and 1961: &quot;Ozark Jubilee&quot; and its spin-off, &quot;Five Star Jubilee&quot;; &quot;Talent Varieties&quot;; and &quot;The Eddy Arnold Show&quot;. All were carried live by ABC except for &quot;Five Star Jubilee&quot; on NBC. They were produced by Springfield&#x27;s Crossroads TV Productions, owned by Ralph D. Foster.

Many of the biggest names in country music frequently visited or lived in Springfield at the time. City officials estimated the programs meant about 2,000 weekly visitors and &quot;over $1,000,000 in fresh income.&quot;

Staged at the Jewell Theatre (demolished in 1961), &quot;Ozark Jubilee&quot; is the first national country music TV show to feature top stars and attract a significant viewership. &quot;Five Star Jubilee&quot;, produced from the Landers Theatre, was the first network color television series to originate outside of New York City or Hollywood. Springfield&#x27;s NBC affiliate, KYTV-TV (which helped produce the program), was not equipped to broadcast in color and aired the show in black-and-white.

The ABC, NBC and Mutual radio networks all carried country music shows nationally from Springfield during the decade, including KWTO&#x27;S &quot;Korn&#x27;s-A-Krackin″&quot; (Mutual).

In the early hours on the morning of June 5, 1993, 59-year-old country singer Conway Twitty died at a hospital in Springfield of a ruptured blood vessel after collapsing on a tour bus during the end of his concert.

===The Ozark Hillbilly Medallion===
The Springfield Chamber of Commerce once presented visiting dignitaries with an &quot;Ozark Hillbilly Medallion&quot; and a certificate proclaiming the honoree a &quot;hillbilly of the Ozarks&quot;. On June 7, 1953, U.S. President Harry Truman received the medallion after a breakfast speech () at the Shrine Mosque for a reunion of the 35th Division. Other recipients included US Army generals Omar Bradley and Matthew Ridgway, US Representative Dewey Short, J. C. Penney, Johnny Olson, Ralph Story and disc jockey Nelson King.

=== Cultural organizations ===

The Ozarks Lyric Opera (formerly the Springfield Regional Opera) has operated in the city for nearly 40 years. In its history, the opera has performed various well known shows, such as The Barber of Seville, La bohème and Carmen.

The Springfield Ballet was founded in 1978 as a not-for-profit to bring ballet to the region. The first performance was held at the Springfield Art Museum in November 1976, and the first public performance in March 1977. The ballet currently performs at the Landers Theatre in downtown Springfield, and has performed with the Springfield Symphony for holiday programs.

The Springfield Little Theatre was founded in 1934 and purchased the Landers Theatre in 1970 for its permanent performance venue. The theatre is the oldest civic theatre in Missouri and one of the oldest in the Midwest, attended by 60,000 people yearly. The venue has been the setting for performances by actors such as Kathleen Turner, Tess Harper, and Lucas Grabeel.

The Springfield Symphony was founded in 1935 and is one of the oldest arts organizations in the city. The symphony was one of the founding members of the American Symphony Orchestra League, now known as the League of American Orchestras, the largest international body for symphonies and orchestras. The symphony performs monthly at Juanita K. Hammons Hall on the Missouri State University campus.

The Springfield Art Museum was started by a small group of women, headed by Deborah D. Weisel. Within two years of its original founding as an art study club, the museum had been formed and began showing traveling exhibitions from cities like New York and Philadelphia. In 1948, the museum was handed into the control of the city. In 2018, a 30-year plan was revealed with the intent of updating the museum to be comparable to the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City and Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Northwest Arkansas, capitalizing on its central location in the city and adjacent park space.

The GLO Center is the LGBTQIA+ community center for Springfield and the Ozarks. Founded in 1996, it is the oldest operating LGBTQIA+ center in Missouri, and the only of its kind in southwest Missouri.

In 1938, a Springfield flag was made official. It resembled the flag of St. Louis (which was later replaced by a new flag). In 2017, the Springfield Flag Movement proposed a new flag for Springfield, arguing that the current flag is disconnected from modern Springfield culture, as it &quot;doesn&#x27;t speak to the unique history and identity of Springfield&quot;. On January 10, 2022, Springfield&#x27;s city council voted 7–2 in favor of adopting the Springfield Flag Movement&#x27;s proposed flag as the official city flag. The new flag was officially adopted by the city on March 1, 2022.

The event also holds a 6.6 kilometer run. The 2018 festival lasted two days and was attended by 56,000 people.

The Japanese Fall Festival usually takes place in September at the Springfield Botanical Gardens in Nathanael Greene Park. The event is put on by the Sister Cities Association and commemorates Japanese culture, often involving visitors from Springfield&#x27;s sister city of Isesaki, offering Japanese tea, giving live performances and selling traditional items like Bonsai and kimono dresses. Springfield in turns sends local groups to Isesaki&#x27;s city festival each year.

US 66 and US 166 formerly passed through Springfield, and sections of historic US 66 can still be seen in the city. US 166&#x27;s eastern terminus was once in the northeast section of the city, and US 60 (westbound) originally ended in downtown Springfield. US 60 now goes through town on James River Freeway. In mid-November 2013, the city began discussing plans to upgrade sections of Schoolcraft Freeway (US 65) and James River Freeway (US 60) through the city to an auxiliary route of Interstate 44. The main reason is to minimize confusion should there be an incident on I-44 as a detour route. In early 2023, plans were announced to widen James River Freeway to 6 lanes, 3 lanes each way, and designate the Schoolcraft Freeway and James River Freeway to possibly I-244.

As late as 1949 the Missouri Pacific had a short branch line connection from the company&#x27;s Springfield station to Crane, whereupon connections could be made to the &quot;Southern Scenic&quot; on the railroad&#x27;s Kansas City to Newport, Arkansas, line.

The Frisco was absorbed by the Burlington Northern (BN) in 1980, and in 1994 the BN merged with the Santa Fe, creating the current Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) Railway. BNSF has three switch yards (two small) in Springfield. Mainlines to and from Kansas City, St. Louis, Memphis, and Tulsa converge at the railroad&#x27;s yard facility in northern Springfield. In October 2006, BNSF announced plans to upgrade its Tulsa and Memphis mainlines into Springfield to handle an additional four to six daily intermodal freight trains between the West Coast and the Southeast.

== History ==
This location had a major incident during the historic march of Zion&#x27;s Camp in 1834 when a contingent of about 200 Mormon believers, marching to rescue their brethren in Jackson County, faced an angry mob of more than 300. Near two forks of Fishing River, a terrible fight was about to start when a severe thunderstorm rolled in suddenly and put the mob to flight. Zion&#x27;s Camp was able to move forward unharmed. Historical markers to the incident are located nearby.

=== 1880s to 1910s ===
The town was founded because of the natural spring water that gushed from the depths of the earth. The spring was accidentally discovered in 1880 by a Black farmer, Travis Mellion, when his daughter Opal fell ill with scrofula, a form of cervical tuberculosis. He asked for advice from nearby campers, and they suggested the spring that oozed from the bank of the Fishing River. Water was brought to his daughter and in a few weeks, her health improved noticeably, and she eventually recovered. A log-cabin farmer, Frederick Kugler, also begin to treat his rheumatic knees and a recurring sore from a Civil War wound, and he soon recovered.

Rev. John Van Buren Flack traveled there in 1880 after hearing about the medicinal values of the spring water. The spring belonged to land owner Anthony W. Wyman. After Flack investigated the water sources, he advised Wyman to have the land platted, water analyzed, and to begin advertising the cures the water held. Flack built a home on a tract that Wyman had platted and opened the town&#x27;s first dry goods store and the first church. The spring was named Excelsior after a popular Longfellow poem, which later changed to Siloam.

On August 17, 1880, Flack and Wyman partnered together to form the community of Excelsior. The post office at the time denied that town name, as there was already one in southern Missouri, so it was named Vigniti. The city kept the name until 1882, when it was renamed Excelsior Springs.

Within one year, nearly two hundred households were built in the valley and the nearby hillsides. The springs proved successful and brought many new people to the area, who camped out in tents or in covered wagons. On February 7, 1881, the town received the designation of village. On July 12, 1881, the community was incorporated as a fourth class city, bringing several hotels, boarding houses, churches, schools, an opera house, livery stables, and stores.

In 1881, a second mineral spring was found by Captain J.L. Farris, first called Empire Spring but renamed Regent Spring. A third, Relief Spring, was discovered at the basin in the Fishing River. Many springs were soon discovered in the area, the most prominent being the Relief, Superior, and Saratoga springs. A pump was installed at the Siloam Spring, and steps from Broadway Street and the city&#x27;s first hotel, the Excelsior, were constructed. Soon a small wooden bridge was built over the Fishing River to an undeveloped peninsula used for visitors to relax while exploring the spring. No city in Missouri had boomed as much as Excelsior Springs had in its first year.

The city&#x27;s first hotel, the Excelsior, was built with a foundation of , and locals wondered if a hotel that size would ever be filled to capacity. The Excelsior opened on March 1, 1881, and quickly filled with many visitors seeking the medicinal waters, including from St. Louis, St. Joseph, Kansas City, and Leavenworth. The hotel led until the first Elms Hotel was built and opened in 1888.
In 1887, the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul railroad extended its line from Chicago to Kansas City via Excelsior Springs. This brought a larger influx of visitors to the growing city. By this time, the Relief Springs and Land Company had been formed primarily to advertise and pique the interest of outsiders. The company acquired of land surrounding the city and the Fishing River. The historic Elms Hotel&#x27;s foundation was soon poured. The Music Hall, a state-of-the-art theater for the time, was built nearby with a seating capacity of 1,320 people. An amusement pavilion was erected but was soon changed into a bottling works facility. A larger pavilion with benches and hooks for cups was placed at Siloam Spring where visitors could partake in the water; soon these mugs became stained by the high iron content of the water. Partnered with the Milwaukee Railroad, the city began to advertise their resort status nationwide. In 1897, the city received its first telephone service.
Discovery of new waters continued around the area. W.P. Mason of the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute analyzed them. His finding reported the Siloam and Regent spring waters to have bicarbonates of iron and manganese, a rare combination that had only been found in four springs in the entire continent of Europe, and Excelsior Springs held the only two known in the United States. The rarity of having 20 separate mineral springs within the area gave Excelsior Springs the reputation of having the world&#x27;s greatest collection of mineral waters.

Other minerals found in the springs were Saline-Sulphur, Soda-Bicarbonate, and Calcic-Bicarbonate (also known as Lithia). Mineral water resorts of the time rarely held such variety, most only mineral water baths, but Excelsior Springs held four distinct types of treatment within the region of tonic, alternative, and eliminative treatments, along with the mineral water baths. The city received international attention in 1893 at the Chicago&#x27;s World Fair when medals were awarded for the iron-manganese water from the Regent Spring and Soterian ginger ale.

In October 1893, more train service was installed with the opening of the Sulpho-Saline route connecting to the Wabash Railroad. Fires destroyed the Excelsior Hotel and the Elms Hotel, leaving only boarding houses to take in visitors. Plans were soon drawn for the rebuilding of the Elms Hotel. The &quot;Second&quot; Elms Hotel was finished in 1908, but was soon destroyed again by fire. The third and present-day Elms Hotel was constructed in 1912. Also built were the Wholf&#x27;s Tavern (later renamed Royal Hotel) and Snapp Hotel (later renamed Oaks Hotel). By 1909, the growing city had 14 modern hotels and about 200 boarding and rooming houses.

The development of a park system was approved, costing . This brought the Excelsior Springs Golf Course and the construction of many structures including the Masonic Hall, auditorium, Odd Fellows Building, and Morse buildings. Hourly transportation on the Kansas City interurban railroad began in January 1912. The expansion of public utilities and a system of highways connecting Excelsior Springs and Kansas City helped the city thrive.

=== 1930s to present day ===
The Great Depression did not have the impact on Excelsior Springs as it had on several other communities, surviving mostly due to its health resort status. Between 1930 and 1940, the town gained 370 citizens, reporting 4,800 total at the end of the decade, when populations in most other small towns were declining.

In November 1931, an intense gun battle happened at the historic Elms Hotel. Four robbers attempted to hold up the hotel, fled by automobile, and were followed by local law enforcement. Gunshots were exchanged in the hotel lobby and veranda. The four criminals fled to nearby Kansas City, but were later apprehended.

In 1932, Mafia gangster Lonnie Affronti shot Azalea Ross and her husband in an ambush shoot-out on Route 10. Ross was the chief witness in a narcotics trial against Affronti. The gangland aided in hiding Affronti for five years before he was captured in Brooklyn, New York, in 1937. One of his accomplices during the shootout, Charley Harvey, was apprehended and killed himself in the city jail a short time later.
The present city hall, the Hall of Waters, was constructed between 1936 and 1938 by architects Keene &amp; Simpson above the Siloam and Sulpho-Saline Springs. Citizens gathered on May 27, 1936, among national attention when the cornerstone of the Hall of Waters was lowered in place. CBS transmitted the event to 62 stations across the country. The local newspaper recorded many well-known names of the present time, including Hollywood B-movie actress Evalyn Knapp, artist Thomas Hart Benton, and author Homer Croy.

In 1937 the structure was partially complete, and the water bar in the lower level opened, providing mineral waters to health-seekers and visitors alike. In the following months the mineral water pool was opened, along with male and female hydrotherapy departments. A two-story hall had also been erected where the minerals were made available at fountains. The first floor contained the women&#x27;s bath department, sunroom, covered porch, grand foyer, management office for the springs, and the chamber of commerce.

The swimming pool was large enough by standards for championship meets. In the south wing were the special hydrotherapy departments devoted to research for the waters&#x27; medicinal values. The bottling department was located on the east side of the north wing, which shipped five varieties of bottled mineral water to locations all over the world.

On Election Day 1948, Harry S. Truman spent the night at the Elms Hotel when it appeared that he was losing his re-election bid to Republican Thomas E. Dewey. However, in the early morning, he was awakened by his aides informing him that he had, in fact, won the election. He was whisked away to Kansas City. He later was photographed at Union Station in St. Louis holding a copy of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; that famously mistakenly proclaimed &quot;Dewey Defeats Truman&quot;.

Flooding issues in 1955 prompted construction of a dike, which resulted in the elimination of the stone terraces and walkways at Siloam Park, to protect the Hall of Waters from further flood damage by the nearby Fishing River. There were subsequent floods in the late 1960s, 1993, and 2015.

The late 1950s and early 1960s were difficult for the city due to the severe decline in popularity of the resort spa town. By 1967, the bottling operations had lost $25,000, and the city decided it was time to put its mineral water history behind and move forward. , however, Excelsior Springs has licensed the rights to the mineral water to Excelsior Springs Bottling Company to allow for commercial bottling and distribution of the historic water.

The National Register of Historic Places includes the Elms Hotel, Hall of Waters, the Colonial Hotel, The Elms Historic District, Excelsior Springs Hall of Waters Commercial East Historic District, Excelsior Springs Hall of Waters Commercial West Historic District, First Methodist Church, Ligon Apartments, Watkins Mill, and Wyman School.

<text>Independence is the county seat of Jackson County, Missouri, United States. It is a satellite city of Kansas City, Missouri, and is the largest suburb on the Missouri side of the Kansas City metropolitan area. In 2020, it had a total population of 123,011, making it the fifth-most populous city in Missouri.

Independence is known as the &quot;Queen City of the Trails&quot; because it was a point of departure for the California, Oregon, and Santa Fe Trails. It is the hometown of U.S. President Harry S. Truman, with the Truman Presidential Library and Museum, and the gravesites of Truman and First Lady Bess Truman. The city is sacred to the Latter Day Saint movement, as the home of Joseph Smith&#x27;s 1831 Temple Lot, and the headquarters of several Mormon denominations.

==History==
Independence was originally inhabited by Missouri and Osage Native Americans, followed by the Spanish and a brief French tenure. It became part of the United States with the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. Lewis and Clark recorded in their journals that they stopped in 1804 to pick plums, raspberries, and wild apples at a site that would later form part of the city. Independence was also a stopping point for the &quot;Donner Party&quot;, an ill-fated group of 19th-century wagon train emigrants whose westward journey along the California Trail ended in disaster, spawning one of the most well known and taboo stories of pioneer-era America.

Named after the Declaration of Independence, Independence was founded on March 29, 1827, and quickly became an important frontier town. Independence was the farthest point westward on the Missouri River where the steamboats or other cargo vessels could travel, due to the convergence of the Kansas River with the Missouri River approximately six miles west of town, near the current Kansas-Missouri border. Independence immediately became a jumping-off point for the emerging fur trade, accommodating merchants and adventurers beginning the long trek westward on the Santa Fe Trail.
In 1831, members of the Latter Day Saint movement began moving to the Jackson County, Missouri area. Shortly thereafter, founder Joseph Smith declared a spot west of the Courthouse Square to be the place for his prophesied temple of the New Jerusalem, in expectation of the Second Coming of Christ. Tension grew with local Missourians until the Latter Day Saints were driven from the area in 1833, the beginning of a conflict which culminated in the 1838 Mormon War. Several branches of this movement gradually returned to the city beginning in 1867, with many making their headquarters there. These include the Community of Christ (formerly the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints), the Church of Christ (Temple Lot), the Church of Jesus Christ (Cutlerite) and the Restoration Branches.

Independence saw great prosperity from the late 1830s through the mid-1840s, while the business of outfitting pioneers boomed. Between 1848 and 1868, it was a hub of the California Trail. On March 8, 1849, the Missouri General Assembly granted a home-rule charter to the town and on July 18, 1849, William McCoy was elected as its first mayor. In the mid-19th century an Act of the United States Congress defined Independence as the start of the Oregon Trail.


Two important Civil War battles occurred at Independence: the first on August 11, 1862, when Confederate soldiers took control of the town, and the second in October 1864, which resulted in a Union victory. The war took its toll on Independence, and the town was never able to regain its previous prosperity, although a flurry of building activity took place soon after the war. The rise of nearby Kansas City also contributed to the town&#x27;s relegation to a place of secondary prominence in Jackson County, though Independence has retained its position as county seat to the present day.

United States President Harry S. Truman grew up in Independence and, in 1922, was elected judge of the Court of Jackson County, Missouri (an administrative, not judicial, post). Although he was defeated for reelection in 1924, he won back the office in 1926 and was reelected in 1930. Truman performed his duties diligently, and won personal acclaim for several popular public works projects, including an extensive series of fine roads for the growing use of automobiles, the building of a new County Court building in Independence, and a series of 12 &quot;Madonna of the Trail&quot; monuments to pioneer women dedicated across the country in 1928 and 1929. He would later return to the city after two terms as president. His wife, First Lady Bess Truman, was born and raised in Independence, and both are buried there. The Harry S. Truman National Historic Site (Truman&#x27;s home) and the Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum are both located in Independence, as is one of Truman&#x27;s boyhood residences.

<text>Sugar Creek is a city in both Jackson and Clay Counties in Missouri in the United States. The population was 3,271 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Kansas City metropolitan area.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

==History==

Like many cities along the Missouri River, Sugar Creek shows evidence of having once been the home of the Osage people. The city takes its name from nearby Sugar Creek.

On June 25, 1804, the Lewis and Clark Expedition camped on an island in the Missouri River opposite what is modern day Sugar Creek.

In the mid-1800s, the area now known as Sugar Creek served as an important link in America&#x27;s westward expansion. Known as Upper Independence Landing originally, the territory along the Missouri River served as a port to receive supplies for early pioneers. It was renamed Wayne City Landing after an army lieutenant, Anthony Wayne. Wayne City, which is now on the national historic register, also received travelers who were headed west along the Oregon, California and Santa Fe Trails. In 1850, the first railroad west of the Mississippi River was constructed to join Wayne City and nearby Independence, Missouri.

From the early 1890s to the 1930s, the Sugar Creek area was home to a first-class pleasure resort, Fairmount Park. Among the park&#x27;s attractions were a hotel, theater, lake, and carnival rides, including a roller coaster that at one time was the world&#x27;s largest. A streetcar line brought visitors to the park from nearby Kansas City.

In 1903, Standard Oil of Indiana purchased land at the northern edge of the city. A new oil refinery was opened a year later and quickly spurred growth in the townsite of Sugar Creek. A number of immigrants from Eastern Europe came to work in the plant, and by 1918, the town had grown to more than 800 residents.

Shortly after World War I, businessmen and residents founded the Sugar Creek Improvement Association. The Association installed streetlights, set city limits and petitioned for incorporation as a city. On November 15, 1920, the City of Sugar Creek was officially born. The new town consisted of and had a population of around 1,800 residents. The city continued to grow and prosper in its early years. In 1958, an additional were annexed on the eastern side of the city, bringing new opportunities for development.

The Liberty Bend Bridge, in northeastern Sugar Creek, carries Route 291 across the Missouri River. The northbound bridge was built in 1949 when a new channel for the river was completed, and replaced the 1927 Liberty Bend Bridge which was about two miles to the north and crossed over the former river channel. Construction began in 1996 on the southbound bridge, which opened in 2001, and the northbound bridge was completely rehabilitated. It was part of an upgrade that changed Route 291 into a four-lane divided highway.

In the 2000s, BP America was involved in over 24 multimillion-dollar lawsuits for extreme polluting and causing unusual cancers in many people caused by its predecessors Amoco and Standard Oil at its Sugar Creek refinery which closed in 1982.

<text>Cameron is a city in Clinton, DeKalb and Caldwell counties in the U.S. state of Missouri. The population was 8,513 at the 2020 census.

The Clinton and Caldwell counties portion of Cameron are part of the Kansas City, MO–KS Metropolitan Statistical Area, while the DeKalb County portion is part of the St. Joseph, MO–KS Metropolitan Statistical Area. The city as a whole is a part of the Kansas City-Overland Park-Kansas City Combined Statistical Area.

== History ==
In 1854, Samuel McCorkle platted the town of Somerville. When the Hannibal and St. Joseph Railroad (a line whose founders included the father of Mark Twain and which was to deliver the first mail of the Pony Express) proposed coming through the area, the line claimed the area around Somerville was too steep for the rail, so he platted a new community 1.5 miles to the west in what is now Downtown Cameron just one year after the founding of Sommerville in 1855 . Since the Hannibal and St.Joseph Railroad Company could not come through Sommerville McCorkle had Judge Stokes and his son Edmund D. Stokes move all the buildings from Sommerville to the new town of Cameron that was named for the maiden name of his wife, Malinda Cameron. McCorkle Park is still Cameron&#x27;s centerpiece park.

During the 1860s, as fierce competition raged for the starting point of the First transcontinental railroad, there was competition to get the Hannibal &amp; St. Joseph (which at the time was the farthest west railroad connected to the main rail network) to cross the Missouri River. Omaha, Nebraska was to win the fight when the Union Pacific started the railroad west from there. However, there was no bridge connecting it to the rest of the network.

Kansas City, Missouri was able to convince the railroad to bypass its rivals in St. Joseph, Leavenworth, Kansas, Atchison, Kansas and Parkville, Missouri to create the &quot;Cameron Branch&quot; of the railroad. The construction of the Hannibal Bridge in Kansas City (which was to beat Omaha in any bids to cross the Missouri) was to propel that city into being the dominant city in the region.

Cameron was to enjoy a surge in its population because of the cutoff, with its population growing from 100 in 1859 to 3,000.

Cameron was a college town from 1883 until 1930. Founded as the Cameron Institute, it became Missouri Wesleyan College, operated by the Methodist Church until 1930. A building on the campus would become Cameron High School until being torn down in the 1960s, when a new high school was built on a site a few blocks south; the campus grounds are now used as parking for the nearby football field.

Cameron gained prominence in the 1980s and 1990s after Cameron area resident Bob F. Griffin served more than 15 years as Speaker of the Missouri House of Representatives—the longest of any representative. Among the pork barrel legislation he was to bring to the town were the Missouri Veterans Home and the Western Missouri Correctional Center, the latter of which is the city&#x27;s largest employer, with 700 employees. A street in the town is named &quot;Bob Griffin Road,&quot; though the road remains (as of June 2016) unpaved for most of its length. Griffin eventually served four years in prison for corruption.

Cameron&#x27;s character has evolved with the intersection of limited access highways. It has expanded to the north towards and past U.S. Route 36 (which in 2007 was proposed to be part of Interstate 72). It has also expanded to the east towards Interstate 35.

== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

===Unusual street grid===
More than two thirds of the community is in Clinton County, south of NE Platte/8th Street/County Road 56. This area includes the original olde town center, Cameron High School and Veterans Home. The area north of the street in DeKalb includes the Crossroads Correctional Center and Western Missouri Correctional Center, and the shopping centers next to U.S. 36. In addition, portions of the community stretch east to the Caldwell County line. The north-south-east division creates an unusual street grid naming system in which some streets in the northern part of Cameron in DeKalb follow that county&#x27;s naming structure of Southeast Rogers Road, Southeast Summit Road, Southeast Pence Road, etc. while roads in the south of Cameron in northern Clinton County have road names of Northeast 358th Street, Northeast 348th Street, etc. These latter street names and directions represent a continuation of the street system for Kansas City. With Caldwell County on the east side of Cameron, that means that street name extensions in Caldwell County on the far east side have a prefix of Northwest such as Northwest Old Highway 36. In one instance just outside the city limits, Southeast Oregon Road in Dekalb County becomes Northwest Oregon Road in Caldwell County when heading east from Cameron.

===Climate===
Cameron experiences a humid continental climate, with cold and snowy winters and hot and humid summers. Extreme weather, such as thunderstorms and tornadoes, can and have occurred in Cameron. Snow falls during the winter months, while late spring and early summer are the wettest time of the year.

<doc id="150741" wikidata="Q957490" url="?curid=150741" title="Sullivan, Missouri">
<text>Sullivan is a city that straddles the border of Franklin and Crawford counties in the U.S. state of Missouri. The population was 6,906 at the 2020 census.

==History==
On January 28, 1839, 120 acres were conveyed by the U.S. Government to Garretson (also spelled Garrison) P. Hardy. Purchased according to provisions of the Act of Congress for the sale of public lands (dated April 1820). Then in June 1848, Garretson sold the acreage to William &amp; Mary Smith for $150. In June 1856, Stephen &amp; Dorcas Sullivan purchased the acreage, plus an additional 49 acres from Smith for the sum of $400. This was the future site of the original town. On July 25, 1856, when a post office was established in present-day Sullivan, the local postmaster named the place &quot;Mount Helicon&quot;. This short-lived name was after an actual mountain in Greece that was the mythical sanctuary of the Muses. In 1859, Stephen Sullivan donated ground for railroad right-of-way and built the depot himself. The railroad named the station “Sullivan” prompting the post office to change to Sullivan.

Between 1920 and 1960 the city grew from 900 to more than 4,000 residents, making Sullivan the second fastest-growing city in the state during that time.

The Maj. Gen. William S. Harney Summer Home was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.

==Geography==
Sullivan is located on the Franklin-Crawford county line at the intersection of Interstate 44 and Missouri Route 185. The Meramec River flows through Meramec State Park just to the east of the city.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

==Government==
Governed by a Mayor and six members of the Board of Aldermen and assisted by a City Administrator, the City oversees a budget of $25 million. The City of Sullivan provides services in the areas of electric distribution, water, sewer, streets, aviation, parks and recreation, engineering, economic development, solid waste collection and law enforcement with a total of 60 full-time employees. The city operates on a very solid financial basis as demonstrated in its reserves. The local tax levy of 43.39 cents and utility rates are among the lowest in the area. A two cent sales tax for general revenue, capital improvements, and transportation provides the largest revenue source.

The Board of Aldermen meets at 7:00 p.m. on the first and third Tuesday of each month. The Board relies on the aid and counsel of numerous boards and commissions, including the Planning &amp; Zoning, Airport Board, Industrial Development Authority and Board of Adjustment that meet as needed. The Planning and Zoning Commission meets on the second Tuesday of each month at 7:00 p.m.

==Demographics==
As late as 1990, Sullivan allegedly had a sundown town sign warning Blacks against being present in Sullivan after dark. While Missouri is 11.6% Black according to the US census definition, in the 2010 census 0.2% of the population of Sullivan was Black. In 2014, a group of 15 white schoolgirls blackened their faces for a game of powderpuff football, prompting national media coverage. A few months prior, as protests took place in Ferguson, MO after the police killing of Michael Brown, the KKK held a rally in the Sullivan area, prompting the town&#x27;s mayor to write a formal denouncement of racial bigotry in the area. Attempting to overcome past prejudices, the Sullivan Chamber of Commerce selected Stefan Wehmeyer, an African American, as the community&#x27;s 2017 Man of the Year. Later that year to open Life House Youth Center, a non-profit youth center that assists children with homework, learning, counseling, socializing, and sports/exercise etc. It has a game room with video and board games along with a fenced off basketball/volleyball court. Amenities and services are open to all children between the ages of 10-17 free of charge.

As of 2024, Tougaloo College maintains Sullivan&#x27;s listing as a sundown town. However, the college&#x27;s assessment reads that Sullivan is &quot;probably not [still a sundown town], although very few Black people.&quot;
